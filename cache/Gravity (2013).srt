24
00:02:04,018 --> 00:02:05,564
<i>Ok, let me tell you a story.</i>

25
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:07,073
<i>It was ninety-six.</i>

26
00:02:07,218 --> 00:02:09,174
<i>I had been up here for 42 days.</i>

27
00:02:09,622 --> 00:02:11,453
<i>Every time I passed over Texas,</i>

28
00:02:11,477 --> 00:02:12,579
<i>I looked down,</i>

29
00:02:12,603 --> 00:02:14,998
<i>knowing that Mrs. Kowalski
was looking up,</i>

30
00:02:15,022 --> 00:02:16,218
<i>thinking of me.</i>

31
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:19,113
<i>6 weeks I am blowing kisses at that woman.</i>

32
00:02:19,687 --> 00:02:22,952
<i>Then we land at Edwards and I find out
that she is run off with this lawyer.</i>

33
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:24,549
<i>So, I packed my car,</i>

34
00:02:24,573 --> 00:02:26,255
<i>and I headed to Tijuana.</i>

35
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,077
<i>You have told this story, Kowalski.</i>

36
00:02:28,247 --> 00:02:29,471
<i>As Houston recalls,</i>

37
00:02:29,495 --> 00:02:31,943
<i>she... took off in your 74' GTO.</i>

38

<i>Engineering requests fuel status

<i>Five hours off the reservation</i>

40
00:02:37,836 --> 00:02:39,561
<i>and I show 30 percent drain.</i>

41
00:02:39,824 --> 00:02:41,624
<i>Give my compliments to Engineering.</i>

42
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:44,539
<i>Except for a slight malfunction
in the nulling of the roll axis,</i>

43
00:02:44,584 --> 00:02:47,015
<i>this jetpack is one prime piece of thrust.</i>

44
00:02:48,115 --> 00:02:49,555
<i>Engineering says thank you.</i>

45
00:02:49,597 --> 00:02:52,175
<i>Tell them I still prefer
my 67' Corvette, though.</i>

46
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:55,450
<i>Speaking of which, did I ever tell you...
We know the Corvette story, Matt.</i>

47
00:02:55,955 --> 00:02:57,250
<i>Even Engineering?</i>

48
00:02:57,352 --> 00:02:59,124
<i>Especially Engineering.</i>

49

<i>Shariff, what's your status?</i>

53
00:03:08,483 --> 00:03:12,203
<i>Nearly there.
Replacing battery module A-one and C.</i>

54
00:03:14,253 --> 00:03:15,944
<i>Could you be a little more specific?</i>

55
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:18,402
<i>Indeterminate estimates
make Houston anxious.</i>

56
00:03:18,914 --> 00:03:20,021
<i>No, no, no, Houston.</i>

57
00:03:20,045 --> 00:03:21,320
<i>Don't be anxious.</i>

58
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:23,478
<i>Anxiety is not good for the heart.</i>

59

<i>System is ready to reactivate.</i>

60

<i>Hubble telescope engaged.</i>

61
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:30,389
<i>Upgrade fully functional.</i>

62
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:33,405
<i>That applause you hear is for you Shariff.</i>

63
00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:34,661
<i>Congratulations.</i>

64
00:03:35,107 --> 00:03:36,643
<i>Kick back, take the rest of the day off.</i>

65
00:03:41,677 --> 00:03:45,842
<i>Matt, do you have a visual on just what
Mission Specialist Shariff is doing up there?</i>

66
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,491
<i>He appears to be doing
some form of the Macarena.</i>

67
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:53,315
<i>But that would be just a best-guess
scenario on my part.</i>

68
00:03:53,676 --> 00:03:55,306
<i>Dr. Stone, Houston.</i>

69
00:03:55,686 --> 00:03:58,575
<i>Medical now have you with
a temperature drop to 35.9</i>

70
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,583
<i>and a heart rate rise to 70.</i>

71
00:04:01,748 --> 00:04:02,939
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

72
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,013
<i>Houston, I am fine.</i>

73
00:04:05,484 --> 00:04:08,396
<i>It's just keeping your lunch down
in zero-G is harder than it looks.</i>

74
00:04:09,602 --> 00:04:13,243
<i>Dr. Stone, Medical is asking
if you want to return to Explorer.</i>

75
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,481
<i>Negative.</i>

76
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:16,707
<i>We have been here a week, Houston.
Let's just finish this.</i>

77
00:04:17,205 --> 00:04:18,297
<i>Card is up.</i>

78
00:04:19,423 --> 00:04:20,723
<i>No, that's a negative.</i>

79
00:04:20,924 --> 00:04:23,732
<i>I am afraid we are getting
nothing on this end, Doctor.</i>

80
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:25,915
<i>Try again.</i>

81
00:04:26,658 --> 00:04:28,056
<i>No, still nothing.</i>

82
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:32,635
<i>Houston, can you
please turn that music off?</i>

83
00:04:32,947 --> 00:04:34,180
<i>Kowalski?</i>

84
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:35,899
<i>Not a problem.</i>

85
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:37,680
<i>Thank you, Kowalski.</i>

86
00:04:41,354 --> 00:04:42,415
<i>Now, Houston?</i>

87
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:44,241
<i>That's a negative.</i>

88
00:04:44,913 --> 00:04:46,858
<i>Could Houston be misinterpreting the data?</i>

89
00:04:47,973 --> 00:04:49,788
<i>Well, we are not receiving any data.</i>

90
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:54,413
<i>Engineering is recommending
a vis check for component damage.</i>

91
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,608
<i>Let me see what's going on.</i>

92
00:04:58,993 --> 00:05:00,219
<i>What have we got?</i>

93
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:10,955
<i>Visual examination doesn't
reveal any damaged components.</i>

94
00:05:11,087 --> 00:05:13,385
<i>The problem must be originating
from the comms panel.</i>

95
00:05:14,108 --> 00:05:15,916
<i>Yeah, that seems to be the case.</i>

96
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:19,552
<i>Engineering admits that you
warned us that this could happen.</i>

97
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:22,724
<i>That's as close to an apology
as you are going to get from them.</i>

98
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:24,399
<i>We should have listened to you Doc.</i>

99
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:27,339
<i>Well, looks like we are going
to have to improvise.</i>

100
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:28,580
<i>I am on it.</i>

101
00:05:29,905 --> 00:05:31,605
<i>How long do you think it will take you?</i>

102
00:05:31,815 --> 00:05:32,755
<i>One hour.</i>

103
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:34,932
<i>Outstanding.</i>

104
00:05:35,308 --> 00:05:38,073
<i>Installing your system in the Hubble
is the purpose of this mission</i>

105
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:40,260
<i>and so we appreciate
your patience Doctor.</i>

106
00:05:41,193 --> 00:05:44,228
<i>Kowalski, we... we know you don't care
about things like this,</i>

107
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:47,445
<i>but, for your information this delay
is not gonna be long enough</i>

108
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,060
<i>for you to break Anatoly
Solovyev's spacewalking record.</i>

109
00:05:50,331 --> 00:05:53,252
<i>It seems like you are gonna be left...
Seventy-five minutes shy?</i>

110
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:55,752
<i>Never crossed my mind.</i>

111
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,336
<i>Matt...</i>

112
00:05:58,361 --> 00:05:59,696
<i>it's been a privilege.</i>

113
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:01,931
<i>Right back at you, Houston.</i>

114
00:06:02,704 --> 00:06:04,212
<i>Enjoy your last walk.</i>

115
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:08,162
<i>Am I a go to assist Dr. Stone
in removing the panel?</i>

116
00:06:08,593 --> 00:06:10,888
<i>Assistance appreciated.
Permission granted.</i>

117
00:06:11,184 --> 00:06:12,334
<i>Thank you Houston.</i>

118
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:14,696
<i>Mind if I join the fun?</i>

119
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,967
<i>Certainly.</i>

120
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:17,188
<i>How you feeling?</i>

121
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,875
<i>Like a Chihuahua
that's being tumble dried.</i>

122
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:23,429
<i>Well, it's been a rough week.</i>

123
00:06:24,587 --> 00:06:26,583
<i>If it makes you feel any better,
I coughed up everything but,</i>

124
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:28,638
<i>my kidneys on my first ride.</i>

125
00:06:29,686 --> 00:06:30,661
<i>Shit.</i>

126
00:06:37,236 --> 00:06:38,161
<i>Sorry.</i>

127
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,997
<i>I am used to a basement lab in a hospital

<i>Thank you.</i>

129
00:06:45,494 --> 00:06:47,437
<i>Well, you are the genius up here.</i>

130
00:06:47,461 --> 00:06:48,970
<i>I only drive the bus.</i>

131
00:06:49,157 --> 00:06:50,056
<i>Yeah, well..</i>

132
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:53,751
<i>Call me a genius if I can get
this board initialized in the next hour.</i>

133
00:06:54,235 --> 00:06:55,737
<i>Explorer, this is Houston.</i>

134
00:06:56,235 --> 00:06:57,445
<i>Go ahead, Houston.</i>

135
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,699
<i>NORAD reports a Russian satellite</i>

<i>Should we...
Should we be worried?</i>

143

<i>No, let's let the boys down
there worry for us.</i>

<i>Explorer, engage arm

<i>Stand by for arm maneuver.</i>

146
00:07:27,131 --> 00:07:29,171
<i>So doc, now that you work for NASA,</i>

147

<i>how do you like us?</i>

148
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,560
<i>Kind of like winning the lottery?</i>

149
00:07:33,138 --> 00:07:36,091
<i>I was just happy that
they didn't cut the funding to my research.</i>

150
00:07:36,116 --> 00:07:37,197
<i>How long was your training?</i>

to scan the edge of the universe.</i>

157
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:50,652
<i>It's designed for hospital use,
but this one is a prototype.</i>

158
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:52,660
<i>Stand by for locking.</i>

159
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:53,836
<i>Listen...</i>

160
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:56,003
<i>they don't bankroll prototypes.</i>

161
00:07:56,908 --> 00:07:58,550
<i>Even for your pretty blue eyes.</i>

162
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,343
<i>Well,</i>

163
00:08:00,726 --> 00:08:02,077
<i>my eyes are brown.</i>

164
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:05,921
<i>Right now, your eyes are bloodshot.</i>

165
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:07,851
<i>Kowalski!</i>

166
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:09,759
<i>Is this great or what?</i>

167
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:17,216
<i>And to think he went to Harvard.</i>

168
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:21,568
<i>You got to admit one thing.</i>

169
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:24,458
<i>Can't beat the view.</i>

170
00:08:29,053 --> 00:08:30,950
<i>So, what do you like
about being up here?</i>

171
00:08:33,493 --> 00:08:34,457
<i>The silence.</i>

172
00:08:36,586 --> 00:08:37,958
<i>I could get used to it.</i>

173
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:00,208
<i>Terrific.</i>

174
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:02,085
<i>Houston, from first inspection,</i>

<i>Am I a go to cut link to auxiliary?</i>

177
00:09:06,737 --> 00:09:08,035
<i>You are the expert, doctor.</i>

178
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:09,148
<i>It's your call.</i>

179
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,266
<i>Houston, I have a bad feeling
about this mission.</i>

180
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:13,439
<i>Please elaborate.</i>

181
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,649
<i>It's the same feeling I had
about Mardi Gras in 1987.</i>

182
00:09:18,295 --> 00:09:19,588
<i>That is affirmative.</i>

183
00:09:19,613 --> 00:09:22,591
<i>Surprisingly, Control hasn't heard
the Mardi Gras story.</i>

184
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:24,495
<i>Please proceed.</i>

185
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,779
<i>Well, it's day one and I am bumping
my way down Bourbon Street</i>

186
00:09:27,823 --> 00:09:30,053
<i>looking for a sister of a friend of mine.</i>

187
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:34,084
<i>Streets are full of people, I am thinking
there is no way I am gonna find this girl.</i>

188
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:35,451
<i>Proceeding to override.</i>

189
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:37,398
<i>Then all of the sudden I look up,</i>

190
00:09:37,594 --> 00:09:39,650
<i>and there she is
and I am about to yell out,</i>

191
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:41,486
<i>and I see she is holding hands
with some short,</i>

192
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,103
<i>hairy guy in board
shorts and a Margaritaville shirt.</i>

193
00:09:44,862 --> 00:09:46,134
<i>And then I realize,</i>

194
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,705
<i>that this guy is not a guy.</i>

195
00:09:48,315 --> 00:09:49,989
<i>That my girl is holding hands with...</i>

196
00:09:50,014 --> 00:09:52,447
<i>ISS, this is Houston.
Proceed Houston.</i>

197
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:54,830
<i>Explorer, this is Houston.
Go ahead Houston.</i>

198
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,042
<i>Mission abort.</i>

199
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:57,878
<i>Repeat. Mission abort.</i>

200
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,855
<i>Initiate emergency disconnect from Hubble.</i>

00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,510
<i>Copy all Houston and in work.</i>

204
00:10:05,674 --> 00:10:07,442
<i>Matt, immediate return to Explorer.</i>

205
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:10,058
<i>Repeat, immediate return to Explorer.
Copy.</i>

206
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:12,609
<i>Explorer prep airlock.
Airlock engaged,</i>

207
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:14,498
<i>Ready to receive.
Houston elaborate.</i>

208
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:17,529
<i>Debris from the missile strike
has caused a chain reaction,</i>

209
00:10:17,598 --> 00:10:20,052
<i>hitting other satellites
and creating new debris.</i>

210

<i>Traveling faster than a high-speed
bullet up towards your altitude.</i>

211

<i>All copy?
Copy all.</i>

212
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:27,461
<i>Put a bow on it, Dr. Stone.</i>

213
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,520
<i>I can't.</i>

214
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:30,666
<i>The board is still initializing.</i>

215
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,392
<i>I am not gonna ask you again.
One second.</i>

216
00:10:33,705 --> 00:10:35,424
<i>Not one second.
Now!</i>

217
00:10:35,682 --> 00:10:36,705
<i>Shut it down.</i>

218
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,557
<i>That's an order.</i>

219
00:10:39,313 --> 00:10:40,292
<i>Ok, I am sorry.</i>

220
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:41,955
<i>I am sorry, I am done.
I am done.</i>

221
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:44,564
<i>Kowalski, initiate emergency
disconnect from the Hubble.</i>

222
00:10:44,632 --> 00:10:46,998
<i>Alright Shariff, let's do this.
Roger Matt.</i>

<i>Houston update.</i>

224
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:50,444
<i>Well, we have a full on chain reaction.</i>

225
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:53,321
<i>It's been confirmed that it's
the unintentional side effect</i>

226

<i>of the Russians striking
one of their own satellites.</i>

227
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:57,645
<i>They shot down their own satellite?</i>

228
00:10:57,669 --> 00:10:58,964
<i>Right of disposal.</i>

229
00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:00,731
<i>Most likely a spy sat gone bad.</i>

230
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,028
<i>Now it's shrapnel.</i>

231
00:11:02,113 --> 00:11:04,035
<i>Explorer, ready to disengage HST.</i>

232

<i>Locks releasing in three... two... one.</i>

233

<i>Explorer, new data coming through.</i>

234
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:11,951
<i>What's the blowback, Houston?</i>

235
00:11:12,281 --> 00:11:13,352
<i>It's not good.</i>

236
00:11:13,451 --> 00:11:15,110
<i>Most of our systems are gone.</i>

237
00:11:15,494 --> 00:11:18,875
<i>Debris chain reaction
is out of control and rapidly expanding.</i>

238
00:11:19,064 --> 00:11:21,923
<i>Multiple satellites are down,
and they keep on falling.</i>

239

<i>Define 'multiple satellites.</i>

00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:44,323
<i>Explorer, this is Kowalski,

<i>Debris is from a BSE sat.
Heads up!</i>

250
00:11:46,548 --> 00:11:49,939
<i>To repeat, I have...

256
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,939
<i>Explorer, permission to retrieve Dr. Stone.</i>

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,584
<i>Need some help there, Matt?
No, don't wait for us.</i>

00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:45,561
Kowalski, I have a visual.

310
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:48,417
I have... have a visual of Explorer.

311
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:50,503
With north at...

312
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,368
at 12 o'clock

313
00:14:53,219 --> 00:14:54,507
and the shuttle is at...

314
00:14:55,038 --> 00:14:56,531
at the center of the dial.

315
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:00,841
I can see...
I can see the Chinese station.

316
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:04,302
No, it's the International Space Station.

317
00:15:05,476 --> 00:15:06,880
ISS is at...

318
00:15:08,521 --> 00:15:10,250
ISS is at 7 o'clock.

319
00:15:18,903 --> 00:15:20,661
Lieutenant Kowalski, do you copy?

320
00:15:26,537 --> 00:15:28,529
<i>Explorer, do you...
do you copy?</i>

321
00:15:37,616 --> 00:15:39,458
<i>Houston, do you copy?</i>

322
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,933
<i>Houston this is...</i>

323
00:15:45,957 --> 00:15:47,646
<i>Mission Specialist Ryan Stone.</i>

324
00:15:47,671 --> 00:15:49,966
<i>I am off structure and I am drifting.</i>

325
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,114
<i>Do you copy?</i>

326
00:15:57,743 --> 00:15:58,701
<i>Anyone?</i>

327
00:16:03,202 --> 00:16:04,255
<i>Anybody?</i>

328
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:08,443
<i>Do you copy?</i>

329
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:13,820
<i>Please copy.</i>

330
00:16:16,537 --> 00:16:17,451
<i>Please.</i>

331
00:16:37,742 --> 00:16:40,860
<i>Dr. Stone, do you copy?
Yeah, Lieutenant Kowalski, yes.</i>

332
00:16:41,196 --> 00:16:43,358
<i>Yes, Lieutenant Kowalski.
Repeat, do you copy?</i>

333
00:16:43,383 --> 00:16:45,227
<i>Yes, yes, I copy, I am here!</i>

334
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,992
<i>I am here.
Flash your light!</i>

335
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,539
<i>My light. my light.
Flash it so I can see you.</i>

336
00:16:50,297 --> 00:16:51,156
<i>Ok.</i>

337
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:53,768
<i>I...</i>

338
00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:55,419
<i>Ok, ok.</i>

339
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,921
<i>Here, here.
Alright.</i>

340
00:16:56,945 --> 00:16:58,191
<i>Am here.
There you are.</i>

341
00:16:58,278 --> 00:16:59,302
<i>Hang on tight.</i>

342
00:16:59,693 --> 00:17:01,074
<i>Report your status.</i>

343
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,052
<i>I am fine, fine.</i>

344
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:04,119
<i>I am alright.</i>

345
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:05,662
<i>Your status.
Give me your readings.</i>

346
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:07,865
<i>3... 3...</i>

347
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:09,797
<i>3.6 PSI.</i>

348
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,227
<i>Your O2, give me your O2.</i>

349
00:17:12,805 --> 00:17:14,211
<i>Oxygen is going down.</i>

350
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,564
<i>It's going down fast.</i>

351
00:17:15,588 --> 00:17:16,696
<i>It's going down fast, 9.</i>

352
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:18,906
<i>No, 8-8 percent.</i>

353
00:17:18,931 --> 00:17:20,478
<i>Ok, you are breathing too fast.
83.9 percent.</i>

354
00:17:20,505 --> 00:17:22,877
<i>You are burning oxygen,
and we don't want to do that.</i>

355
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:24,615
<i>We want to relax. Copy?</i>

356
00:17:25,107 --> 00:17:26,693
<i>Ok, sorry. Yes, copy, copy.</i>

357
00:17:26,718 --> 00:17:27,826
<i>Alright. Nearly there.</i>

358
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,006
<i>Please hurry.</i>

359
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:32,623
<i>You can holster
that torch, Dr. Stone.</i>

360
00:17:32,647 --> 00:17:33,624
<i>Sorry.</i>

361
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:34,506
<i>Sorry.</i>

362
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:40,923
<i>Got you. Alright.</i>

363
00:17:41,283 --> 00:17:43,337
<i>Now, I am gonna tether you to me.</i>

364
00:17:45,562 --> 00:17:48,558
<i>I know, you never realized how
devastatingly good-looking I am.</i>

365
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,616
<i>But I need you to stop staring
and help me with the tether.</i>

366
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:53,894
<i>Ok?</i>

367
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,014
<i>Ok, ok.</i>

368
00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:58,201
<i>I got it.</i>

369
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,612
<i>Alright, here we go.</i>

370
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:02,075
<i>Alright.</i>

371
00:18:02,138 --> 00:18:04,723
<i>Now, to clear you from the jets,
I am gonna give you a little push.</i>

372
00:18:04,748 --> 00:18:06,137
<i>No, no, no, no. No, no, no.
Not a push.</i>

373
00:18:06,183 --> 00:18:07,425
<i>No, no.
A nudge.</i>

374
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,227
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Damn it, no! No!</i>

375
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,211
<i>See?</i>

376
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:20,546
<i>Where you go I go.</i>

377
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,588
<i>Better.</i>

378
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:29,830
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

379
00:18:32,338 --> 00:18:33,517
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

380
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:34,726
<i>I know what you mean.</i>

381
00:18:35,943 --> 00:18:36,812
<i>Damn it.</i>

382
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:38,435
<i>You are burning oxygen.</i>

383
00:18:39,442 --> 00:18:41,984
<i>We are going back to the shuttle.
How is that for a plan?</i>

384
00:18:42,008 --> 00:18:42,974
<i>Copy?</i>

385
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:43,861
<i>Fuck!</i>

386
00:18:44,443 --> 00:18:45,671
<i>Right. Copy that.</i>

387
00:18:46,862 --> 00:18:48,604
<i>Houston, in the blind.
This is Kowalski.</i>

388
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,627
<i>Dr. Stone and I are gonna
make our way back to base.</i>

389
00:18:50,824 --> 00:18:53,807
<i>Can you get the Explorer
to prepare the airlock for arrival? Copy.</i>

390
00:18:55,555 --> 00:18:57,651
<i>Houston, this is Kowalski.
How do you copy?</i>

391
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:00,906
<i>Houston, in the blind.
This is Kowalski.</i>

392
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,508
<i>They can't hear us.
We don't know that.</i>

393
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:04,861
<i>That's why we keep talking.</i>

394
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:07,720
<i>If somebody is listening,
they might just save your life.</i>

395
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:10,346
<i>Set your watch for 90 minutes.</i>

396
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,495
<i>Why 90?</i>

397
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:15,818
<i>Well, Houston clocked that debris
at 50,000 miles an hour.</i>

398
00:19:16,326 --> 00:19:19,576
<i>If you factor in our current orbit,
then I figure we got about 90 minutes</i>

399
00:19:19,732 --> 00:19:21,389
<i>before we get our asses kicked again.</i>

400
00:19:21,504 --> 00:19:23,150
<i>O2 down to 6 percent.</i>

401
00:19:24,378 --> 00:19:25,253
<i>Ok.</i>

402
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:28,128
<i>Pretty scary shit being
untethered up here, isn't it?</i>

403
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,419
<i>Yeah, pretty scary shit.</i>

404
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,005
<i>Well, you did alright.</i>

405
00:19:37,281 --> 00:19:39,046
Well, you were not so bad yourself.

406
00:19:43,217 --> 00:19:45,476
<i>Houston, in the blind.
This is Kowalski.</i>

407
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:48,509
<i>Our current location
is approximately...</i>

408
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:51,177
<i>900 meters out from the Explorer.</i>

409
00:19:51,881 --> 00:19:56,112
<i>Dr. Stone and I would like to retrieve
the body of Mission Specialist Shariff</i>

410
00:19:56,684 --> 00:19:58,185
<i>and return it to the shuttle.</i>

411
00:19:58,209 --> 00:19:59,990
<i>Am I a go to retrieve?</i>

412
00:20:03,062 --> 00:20:04,216
<i>Roger that.</i>

413
00:20:04,641 --> 00:20:06,203
Where is he?
Where is he?

414
00:20:34,226 --> 00:20:36,076
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

415
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:41,597
<i>Grab him!</i>

416
00:20:44,987 --> 00:20:45,983
<i>Grab him!</i>

417
00:20:46,584 --> 00:20:48,089
<i>I am trying, I am trying!</i>

418
00:20:52,616 --> 00:20:54,699
<i>You are pulling me away.
Got... I got him!</i>

419
00:20:55,178 --> 00:20:57,403
<i>Clutch him like he is your Valentine.
I got him.</i>

420
00:20:57,428 --> 00:21:00,279
<i>I can't engage my thrust with you
two yo-yoing around.</i>

421
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,082
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

422
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,907
<i>Here is hoping you have a hell
of an insurance policy, Houston.</i>

423
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:38,368
<i>The damages to Explorer...</i>

424
00:21:38,937 --> 00:21:40,245
<i>are catastrophic.</i>

425
00:21:41,172 --> 00:21:42,828
<i>Will commence search for survivors.</i>

426
00:21:42,853 --> 00:21:44,780
<i>O2 down to 5 percent.</i>

427
00:21:45,528 --> 00:21:47,521
<i>Alright, here we go.
Careful of the edges!</i>

428
00:21:56,821 --> 00:21:58,056
<i>Here. Here!</i>

429
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:51,951
<i>Houston in the blind.
To confirm.</i>

430
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,861
<i>Mission Specialist Dr. Stone</i>

431
00:22:54,885 --> 00:22:56,471
<i>and Mission Commander Matthew Kowalski</i>

432
00:22:56,472 --> 00:22:59,430
<i>are the sole survivors
of the STS-1-5-7.</i>

433
00:23:02,457 --> 00:23:04,026
<i>I apologize for not complying.</i>

434
00:23:04,027 --> 00:23:06,304
<i>I should have stopped working as
soon as you instructed me to.</i>

435
00:23:06,305 --> 00:23:07,990
<i>We were gonna get hit no matter what.</i>

436
00:23:08,373 --> 00:23:10,297
<i>There was nothing you could
do to change that.</i>

437
00:23:14,812 --> 00:23:15,507
<i>Hey?</i>

438
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,069
<i>Yes.</i>

439
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,677
<i>Alright.</i>

440
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,565
<i>We have to make our
way to the Space Station.</i>

441
00:23:22,997 --> 00:23:24,184
<i>Over there.</i>

442
00:23:26,011 --> 00:23:29,098
<i>It's a bit of a hike, but we need
to use their escape pod,</i>

443
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:31,250
<i>the Soyuz, to get back to Earth.</i>

444
00:23:31,632 --> 00:23:32,622
<i>Agreed?</i>

445
00:23:34,285 --> 00:23:35,527
<i>Dr. Stone,</i>

446
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:37,652
<i>agreed?</i>

447
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:39,823
<i>Agreed.</i>

448
00:23:40,699 --> 00:23:42,609
<i>Alright. After you.</i>

449
00:23:45,106 --> 00:23:46,107
<i>Oh, God.</i>

450
00:23:56,155 --> 00:23:58,204
<i>Houston, in the blind.
This is Kowalski.</i>

451
00:23:58,913 --> 00:24:02,358
<i>Dr. Stone and I have determined
to proceed to ISS</i>

452
00:24:02,677 --> 00:24:05,430
<i>and use one of their Soyuz for re-entry.</i>

453
00:24:06,315 --> 00:24:08,146
<i>ISS, if you hear us...</i>

454
00:24:09,395 --> 00:24:11,178
<i>we could sure use a rescue mission.</i>

455
00:24:25,395 --> 00:24:27,162
<i>O2 down to 2 percent.</i>

456

<i>We are getting there.</i>

457
00:24:30,863 --> 00:24:32,217
<i>Beautiful, don't you think?</i>

458
00:24:34,018 --> 00:24:34,905
<i>What?</i>

459
00:24:35,596 --> 00:24:36,936
<i>The sunrise.</i>

460
00:24:38,734 --> 00:24:40,491
<i>That's what I am gonna miss the most.</i>

461
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:47,890
<i>So where is home, Dr. Stone?</i>

462
00:24:51,225 --> 00:24:53,116
<i>Ryan, where is home?</i>

463
00:24:55,081 --> 00:24:56,046
<i>Home?</i>

464
00:24:57,472 --> 00:24:58,485
<i>Down there.</i>

465
00:24:59,143 --> 00:25:00,159
<i>Mother Earth.</i>

466
00:25:01,238 --> 00:25:02,659
<i>Where do you pitch you tent?</i>

467
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,327
<i>Lake Zurich.</i>

468
00:25:08,264 --> 00:25:09,474
<i>Where the hell is that?</i>

469
00:25:12,996 --> 00:25:13,873
<i>Illinois.</i>

470
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:15,304
<i>Illinois.</i>

471
00:25:15,591 --> 00:25:16,911
<i>Central Time Zone.</i>

472
00:25:18,397 --> 00:25:20,024
<i>That would make it roughly...</i>

473
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,114
<i>8 p.m.</i>

474
00:25:22,644 --> 00:25:25,565
<i>What are the good people of Lake
Zurich doing at 8 o'clock?</i>

475
00:25:27,363 --> 00:25:28,534
<i>I don't know.</i>

476
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,581
<i>I am not gonna make it.
I am slowing you down.</i>

477
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:33,370
<i>What would you be doing?</i>

478
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:37,502
<i>Come on, Ryan.</i>

479
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:39,877
<i>It's 8 o'clock.</i>

480
00:25:40,618 --> 00:25:43,314
<i>You have just left the hospital
after an 18 hour shift.</i>

481
00:25:44,635 --> 00:25:45,822
<i>Driving home.</i>

482
00:25:49,585 --> 00:25:50,642
<i>The radio.</i>

483
00:25:52,866 --> 00:25:54,208
<i>I listen to the radio.</i>

484
00:25:55,271 --> 00:25:57,305
<i>There we go.
Let me guess.</i>

485
00:25:57,686 --> 00:25:58,670
<i>NPR?</i>

486
00:25:59,294 --> 00:26:00,297
<i>Classical?</i>

487
00:26:00,818 --> 00:26:01,829
<i>Top 40?</i>

488
00:26:05,427 --> 00:26:06,181
<i>Anything.</i>

489
00:26:06,261 --> 00:26:08,623
<i>I don't care, as long as they don't talk.
I just drive.</i>

490
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,272
<i>And where are you driving to?</i>

491
00:26:16,256 --> 00:26:17,411
<i>I just drive.</i>

492
00:26:18,658 --> 00:26:20,272
<i>What do you miss down there?</i>

493
00:26:22,107 --> 00:26:23,522
<i>Is there a Mr. Stone?</i>

494
00:26:25,331 --> 00:26:26,053
<i>No.</i>

495
00:26:27,078 --> 00:26:28,383
<i>Nobody special?</i>

496
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:33,420
<i>Somebody down there looking up,</i>

497
00:26:34,032 --> 00:26:35,250
<i>thinking about you?</i>

498
00:26:37,874 --> 00:26:38,930
<i>Ryan?</i>

499
00:26:46,232 --> 00:26:47,566
<i>I had a daughter.</i>

500
00:26:58,802 --> 00:27:00,039
<i>She was four.</i>

501
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,861
<i>She was at school playing tag.</i>

502
00:27:05,018 --> 00:27:07,304
<i>Slipped, hit her head and that was it.</i>

503
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:11,355
<i>Stupidest thing.</i>

504
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:20,472
<i>I was driving when I got the call, so...</i>

505
00:27:21,989 --> 00:27:24,003
<i>Ever since then, that's what I do.</i>

506
00:27:25,586 --> 00:27:26,716
<i>I wake up.</i>

507
00:27:28,005 --> 00:27:29,177
<i>I go to work.</i>

508
00:27:29,973 --> 00:27:31,420
<i>And I just drive.</i>

509
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,560
<i>O2 down to 1 percent.</i>

510
00:28:13,339 --> 00:28:15,324
<i>Well, I have got good news and bad news.</i>

511
00:28:15,516 --> 00:28:17,434
<i>The good news is, we are about
five minutes</i>

512
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:20,328
<i>from the ISS and I know where
the Russians stash their vodka.</i>

513
00:28:20,748 --> 00:28:23,322
<i>And that is good, because
I am running on fumes here.</i>

514
00:28:24,524 --> 00:28:28,196
<i>The bad news is, I am gonna be about
10 minutes short of breaking Anatoly's record,</i>

515
00:28:28,384 --> 00:28:29,345
<i>and...</i>

516
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:31,313
<i>I...
What?</i>

517
00:28:31,754 --> 00:28:34,634
<i>I am redlining my O2 tank pressure is low.</i>

518
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:37,749
<i>Your tank is out of oxygen
but you still have it in your suit.</i>

519
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,552
<i>Got it.</i>

520
00:28:38,577 --> 00:28:40,202
<i>So you have to sip, not gulp.</i>

521
00:28:41,307 --> 00:28:43,084
<i>Wine, not beer.</i>

522
00:28:43,108 --> 00:28:44,600
<i>Sip, Ryan.</i>

523
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,562
<i>Houston, in the blind,
we have a visual of the ISS.</i>

524
00:28:48,746 --> 00:28:52,257
<i>The station must have been evacuated
because the first Soyuz is missing.</i>

525
00:28:52,551 --> 00:28:56,536
<i>The second Soyuz exhibits surface damage,
and its chute has been deployed.</i>

526
00:28:57,031 --> 00:28:59,726
<i>Any use as an escape pod
for re-entry</i>

527
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,054
<i>is impossible.</i>

528
00:29:01,201 --> 00:29:03,199
<i>Shouldn't we be turning we are drifting again.</i>

529
00:29:03,645 --> 00:29:06,332
<i>Not yet.
I was not kidding about those fumes.</i>

530
00:29:06,551 --> 00:29:08,559
<i>This can has one or two good thrusts left...</i>

531
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,152
<i>if we are lucky.</i>

532
00:29:22,979 --> 00:29:24,074
<i>Steady.</i>

533
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:34,839
<i>Aim.</i>

534
00:29:36,064 --> 00:29:36,845
<i>Fire!</i>

535
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:44,963
<i>Brake! Brake!
You have to brake!</i>

536
00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:46,849
<i>I can't, the can is empty.</i>

537
00:29:47,326 --> 00:29:49,403
<i>We are gonna hit hard!
Grab a hold of anything you can!</i>

538
00:30:01,285 --> 00:30:02,394
<i>What do I do?</i>

539
00:30:03,914 --> 00:30:04,917
<i>What do I do?</i>

540
00:30:14,597 --> 00:30:15,368
<i>Ryan!</i>

541
00:30:20,442 --> 00:30:22,225
<i>The tether broke, I am detached!</i>

542
00:30:22,878 --> 00:30:24,019
<i>I am detached!</i>

543
00:30:24,044 --> 00:30:25,104
<i>Grab a hold!</i>

544
00:30:27,907 --> 00:30:29,047
<i>Grab anything!</i>

545
00:30:45,341 --> 00:30:46,038
<i>Ryan!</i>

546
00:30:48,427 --> 00:30:49,419
<i>Give me five!</i>

547
00:30:50,023 --> 00:30:51,039
<i>I have got you.</i>

548
00:30:51,222 --> 00:30:52,721
<i>I have got you.
Right here,</i>

549
00:30:56,499 --> 00:30:57,385
<i>Shit!</i>

550
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:00,136
<i>No, no. No, no, no, no, no.</i>

551
00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:02,674
<i>Got you.</i>

552
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:12,900
<i>Got you.</i>

553
00:31:16,201 --> 00:31:18,891
<i>You just hold on..
And I am gonna start pulling you in.</i>

554
00:31:19,443 --> 00:31:21,361
<i>Hey, Doc.
Just hold on, hang on.</i>

555
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:22,965
<i>I am gonna pull you in.</i>

556
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,470
<i>Ryan, listen.
I am gonna pull you in.</i>

557
00:31:24,495 --> 00:31:26,032
<i>You have to let me go.
No.</i>

558
00:31:26,057 --> 00:31:28,690
<i>The ropes are too loose.
I am pulling you with me.</i>

559
00:31:28,715 --> 00:31:30,043
<i>You have to let me go,</i>

560
00:31:30,207 --> 00:31:32,277
<i>or we both die.
I am not letting you go, we are fine!</i>

561
00:31:33,306 --> 00:31:34,106
<i>No.</i>

562
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:42,314
<i>Ryan, let me go.
No. No.</i>

563
00:31:43,032 --> 00:31:45,552
<i>You are not going anywhere.
You are not going anywhere.</i>

564
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:47,143
<i>It's not up to you.</i>

565
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:48,400
<i>No, no, no, no...</i>

566
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,536
<i>Please don't do this.</i>

567
00:31:50,546 --> 00:31:51,875
<i>Please don't do this.</i>

568
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:57,167
<i>Please don't, Matt.
Please don't do this.</i>

569
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,585
<i>You are gonna make it, Ryan.</i>

570
00:32:03,196 --> 00:32:04,246
<i>No!</i>

571
00:32:25,857 --> 00:32:28,927
<i>I had you. I had you!
I had you.</i>

572
00:32:45,016 --> 00:32:46,455
<i>Ryan, do you hear me?</i>

573
00:32:49,377 --> 00:32:50,373
<i>Do you copy?</i>

574
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,047
<i>My CO2 alarm went off.</i>

575
00:32:53,194 --> 00:32:56,438
<i>My CO2 alarm went off.
Look, you need to board the station.</i>

576
00:32:57,603 --> 00:32:58,883
<i>Do you see the airlock?</i>

577
00:33:08,512 --> 00:33:09,585
<i>Hey Ryan,</i>

578
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,668
<i>you copy?</i>

579
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,281
<i>Look for the airlock.</i>

580
00:33:18,343 --> 00:33:20,429
<i>It's above you, next to the Zarya module.</i>

581
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:25,491
<i>You see it?</i>

582
00:33:26,022 --> 00:33:26,944
<i>Yes.</i>

583
00:33:27,163 --> 00:33:28,328
<i>Yes, I see it.</i>

584
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:30,342
<i>I see it.
Alright, good.</i>

585
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:32,256
<i>That's where you want to go.</i>

586
00:33:32,981 --> 00:33:34,637
<i>Now you are getting lightheaded, right?</i>

587
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:36,665
<i>Yeah.
Yes.</i>

588
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,567
<i>That's because you are breathing CO2.</i>

589
00:33:39,715 --> 00:33:41,403
<i>You are losing consciousness.</i>

590
00:33:41,805 --> 00:33:42,927
<i>You need to board the station.</i>

591
00:33:43,181 --> 00:33:44,081
<i>Ok.</i>

592
00:33:45,528 --> 00:33:48,120
<i>That second Soyuz
is too damaged for re-entry,</i>

593
00:33:48,145 --> 00:33:50,839
<i>but it's perfectly fine
for a little Sunday drive.</i>

594
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,564
<i>Sunday drive?</i>

595
00:33:53,344 --> 00:33:54,462
<i>Look to the west.</i>

596
00:33:56,302 --> 00:33:57,744
<i>You see that dot in the distance?</i>

597
00:33:58,341 --> 00:33:59,817
<i>That's a Chinese station.</i>

598
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:00,906
<i>Yes.</i>

599
00:34:01,108 --> 00:34:03,628
<i>You are gonna take the Soyuz,
and you are gonna cruise over there.</i>

600
00:34:05,341 --> 00:34:07,755
<i>Chinese lifeboat is a Shenzhou.</i>

601
00:34:08,774 --> 00:34:10,203
<i>I have never flown a Shenzhou.</i>

602
00:34:10,227 --> 00:34:11,485
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

603
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:14,212
<i>Its re-entry protocol is identical to the Soyuz.</i>

604
00:34:15,709 --> 00:34:16,743
<i>Ok.</i>

605
00:34:19,163 --> 00:34:20,853
<i>You never flown the Soyuz either?</i>

606
00:34:21,676 --> 00:34:23,166
<i>Only a simulator.</i>

607
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,118
<i>Well, then you know.</i>

608
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:29,062
<i>But I crashed it.</i>

609
00:34:29,637 --> 00:34:31,741
<i>It's a simulator,
that's what it's designed for.</i>

610
00:34:35,214 --> 00:34:36,187
<i>Every time.</i>

611
00:34:36,844 --> 00:34:38,143
<i>I crashed it every time.</i>

612
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:40,108
<i>You point the damn thing at Earth.</i>

613
00:34:40,132 --> 00:34:41,682
<i>It's not rocket science.</i>

614
00:34:42,913 --> 00:34:44,077
<i>And by this time tomorrow,</i>

615
00:34:44,102 --> 00:34:46,639
<i>you are gonna be back in Lake Zurich
with a hell of a story to tell.</i>

616
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:48,875
<i>You copy?</i>

617
00:34:50,884 --> 00:34:52,120
<i>Ryan, you copy?</i>

618
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:54,820
<i>I am gonna take the
Soyuz and come get you.</i>

619
00:34:54,845 --> 00:34:56,680
<i>No, you are not.
I am coming to get you</i>

620
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,265
<i>No, I have got too much of a head start on you.
I am coming to get you.</i>

621
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,176
<i>I am afraid that ship already sailed.</i>

622
00:35:02,823 --> 00:35:04,747
<i>Ryan, you are gonna have to learn to let go.</i>

623
00:35:06,268 --> 00:35:08,192
<i>But I...
I want to hear you say you are gonna make it...</i>

624
00:35:10,945 --> 00:35:12,483
<i>Come on Ryan, say it.</i>

625
00:35:14,642 --> 00:35:15,893
<i>I am gonna make it.</i>

626
00:35:16,042 --> 00:35:17,061
<i>Alright.</i>

627
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:18,327
<i>Keep going.</i>

628
00:35:19,412 --> 00:35:21,974
<i>What kind of name is Ryan for a girl?</i>

629
00:35:24,036 --> 00:35:25,319
<i>Dad wanted a boy.</i>

630
00:35:25,343 --> 00:35:27,232
<i>Are you close to the airlock?</i>

631
00:35:29,068 --> 00:35:29,907
<i>Not yet.</i>

632
00:35:30,165 --> 00:35:31,398
<i>Keep going.</i>

633
00:35:32,373 --> 00:35:34,561
<i>So now that we have some distance between us...</i>

634
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,040
<i>you are attracted to me, right?</i>

635
00:35:37,064 --> 00:35:38,538
<i>What?
Well...</i>

636
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,410
<i>people say I have beautiful blue eyes.</i>

637
00:35:45,941 --> 00:35:47,219
<i>You have beautiful...</i>

638
00:35:47,918 --> 00:35:49,462
<i>You have beautiful blue eyes.</i>

639
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,168
<i>I have brown eyes.</i>

640
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,309
<i>You want to know the good news?</i>

641
00:35:56,848 --> 00:35:57,618
<i>What?</i>

642
00:35:57,796 --> 00:35:59,545
<i>I am gonna break Anatoly's record,</i>

643
00:35:59,906 --> 00:36:02,426
<i>and I think mine is gonna stand for a long,
long time.</i>

644
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,130
<i>No.</i>

645
00:36:03,616 --> 00:36:05,163
<i>I am coming to get you.</i>

646
00:36:08,171 --> 00:36:10,419
<i>Oh, my God.
What? What?</i>

647
00:36:14,154 --> 00:36:15,202
<i>Hey Ryan?</i>

648
00:36:15,851 --> 00:36:16,686
<i>Yeah?</i>

649
00:36:17,224 --> 00:36:19,201
<i>You should see the sun on the Ganges.</i>

650
00:36:22,127 --> 00:36:23,334
<i>It's amazing.</i>

651
00:40:49,411 --> 00:40:51,315
Where are you?
Where are you?

652
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:54,248
Comms. Comms.
There you are, Ok.

653
00:41:05,456 --> 00:41:07,006
Matt, this is Ryan, copy.

654
00:41:10,315 --> 00:41:12,505
Matt, this is Ryan, copy.

655
00:41:16,002 --> 00:41:19,310
Matt, I made it, I am here, I am on the station.
Do you copy?

656
00:41:25,782 --> 00:41:27,436
Come on, Matt, talk to me.

657
00:41:28,193 --> 00:41:30,169
Tell me where you are, give me your position.

658
00:41:31,724 --> 00:41:34,708
Where are you? Give me a visual.
Just tell me what you see.

659
00:41:39,985 --> 00:41:42,881
Come on. You have been yammering
since we left Cape Canaveral,

660
00:41:42,906 --> 00:41:44,816
and now you decide to shut up?
Talk to me.

661
00:41:44,942 --> 00:41:47,803
Just say something, say anything!
I don't care!

662
00:41:54,055 --> 00:41:54,976
Hey...

663
00:41:56,854 --> 00:42:00,017
Tell me about Mardi Gras.
Tell me about the hairy guy?

664
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:01,965
Tell me what happened.

665
00:42:02,466 --> 00:42:04,512
What happened to the hairy guy?

666
00:42:11,034 --> 00:42:12,221
Please talk to me.

667
00:42:16,908 --> 00:42:18,041
Please.

668
00:42:34,055 --> 00:42:35,569
Houston, in the blind...

669
00:42:38,185 --> 00:42:41,923
this is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone
reporting from the ISS.

670
00:42:44,221 --> 00:42:46,193
All communications
with Mission Commander

671
00:42:46,217 --> 00:42:48,220
Matthew Kowalski have been lost.

672
00:42:51,935 --> 00:42:53,803
Radio transmission absent.

673
00:42:56,134 --> 00:42:57,803
Visuals nonexistent.

674
00:43:00,623 --> 00:43:01,734
To confirm,

675
00:43:02,756 --> 00:43:05,350
I, Ryan Stone, am the sole survivor

676
00:43:06,238 --> 00:43:08,374
of STS-1-5-7.

677
00:43:22,261 --> 00:43:23,027
What now?

678
00:45:04,027 --> 00:45:04,815
Ok.

679
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:05,828
Where is it?

680
00:45:06,344 --> 00:45:07,890
Where is the power?
Here you are.

681
00:45:11,722 --> 00:45:12,906
Great, just like training.

682
00:45:14,328 --> 00:45:15,307
Undocking.

683
00:45:16,344 --> 00:45:17,244
Undocking.

684
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:19,284
Red.

685
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:27,383
Ok.

686
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,590
Ok, where is it?

687
00:45:30,415 --> 00:45:31,376
Where is it?

688
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:33,134
Come on.

689
00:45:34,348 --> 00:45:34,986
Ok.

690
00:45:38,766 --> 00:45:41,091
Ok, I remember this, I remember this.

691
00:45:56,027 --> 00:45:57,996
You don't have four minutes.
We are going manual

692
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:00,878
Come on.

693
00:46:01,699 --> 00:46:02,395
Ok.

694
00:46:03,368 --> 00:46:06,255
Active. Activate, undock.

695
00:46:34,913 --> 00:46:36,815
7 minutes to get out of here.

696
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:45,100
Alright, ok.

697
00:47:01,313 --> 00:47:02,675
What? What, what?

698
00:47:12,487 --> 00:47:14,455
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

699
00:47:43,884 --> 00:47:45,775
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

700
00:47:55,683 --> 00:47:57,714
Come on, come on, come on!

701
00:47:57,984 --> 00:47:59,217
Come on!

702
00:47:59,492 --> 00:48:01,475
Come on, come on, come on!

703
00:48:02,408 --> 00:48:04,033
That's right, that's right, right, right, right.

704
00:48:04,703 --> 00:48:07,040
That's right, that's right, that's right,
that's right, that's right.

705
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,056
Come on.

706
00:48:47,328 --> 00:48:48,095
Great.

707
00:49:34,425 --> 00:49:37,064
Clear skies with a chance of satellite debris.

708
00:50:51,188 --> 00:50:54,328
Ok, we detach this, and we go home.
Piece of cake.

709
00:51:20,899 --> 00:51:21,883
Ok.

710
00:51:26,182 --> 00:51:27,533
Ok, what do we have?

711
00:51:28,307 --> 00:51:29,557
Ok, alright.

712
00:51:40,815 --> 00:51:41,655
Shit.

713
00:51:49,921 --> 00:51:51,022
Ok, come on.

714
00:51:51,497 --> 00:51:52,498
Come on, come on.

715
00:51:53,171 --> 00:51:53,983
Alright.

716
00:53:25,026 --> 00:53:26,487
I hate space.

717
00:53:47,025 --> 00:53:48,188
Shut up.

718
00:53:52,943 --> 00:53:53,657
Ok.

719
00:54:02,089 --> 00:54:02,868
Alright.

720
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:09,210
That's good.

721
00:54:11,012 --> 00:54:11,689
Ok.

722
00:54:13,525 --> 00:54:14,923
Let's stabilize you.

723
00:54:30,515 --> 00:54:31,493
Ok.

724
00:54:33,124 --> 00:54:35,477
Let's go visit the Chinese station.

725
00:54:36,943 --> 00:54:38,290
Houston, in the blind,

726
00:54:38,711 --> 00:54:40,473
Tiangong is approximately,

727
00:54:40,497 --> 00:54:41,892
100 kilometers...

728
00:54:42,348 --> 00:54:44,239
to the west,

729
00:54:44,612 --> 00:54:46,187
and I am off its...

730
00:54:46,211 --> 00:54:47,606
course by about...

731
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:51,590
30 degrees. I will correct trajectory.

732
00:55:14,179 --> 00:55:14,836
Ok.

733
00:55:16,211 --> 00:55:16,914
Ok.

734
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:18,808
Ok.

735
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,725
I will engage S-Ka-Dae in five.

736
00:55:23,952 --> 00:55:24,589
Four.

737
00:55:24,744 --> 00:55:25,352
Three.

738
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:26,146
Two.

739
00:55:26,311 --> 00:55:27,011
One.

740
00:55:41,851 --> 00:55:44,011
What's happening, what's happening?
Come on, come on.

741
00:55:47,268 --> 00:55:48,027
One.

742
00:56:02,794 --> 00:56:04,027
Come on, come on.

743
00:56:08,842 --> 00:56:10,303
You got to be kidding me.

744
00:56:11,059 --> 00:56:12,727
You got to be kidding me!

745
00:56:17,572 --> 00:56:19,363
No!
Don't you fuck...

746
00:56:29,401 --> 00:56:30,547
<i>Houston, in the blind.</i>

747
00:56:31,528 --> 00:56:33,789
<i>Houston, in the blind, this is Dr. Ryan Stone.</i>

Is this Tiangong? Copy.

763

Dr. Ryan Stone, I need help.

I am...

777
00:58:00,451 --> 00:58:01,452
Those are dogs.

778
00:58:03,061 --> 00:58:04,392
They are calling from Earth.

779
00:58:07,886 --> 00:58:09,256
They are calling from Earth.

780

782
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:31,371
Your dogs. Dogs,

783
00:58:31,395 --> 00:58:34,243
you know. Woof, woof. Dogs.

784
00:59:18,944 --> 00:59:20,460
Oh, I am gonna die, Aningaaq.

785
00:59:23,514 --> 00:59:25,091
I know, we are all gonna die.

786
00:59:25,115 --> 00:59:26,490
Everybody knows that.

787
00:59:27,122 --> 00:59:29,060
But I am gonna die today.

788
00:59:32,122 --> 00:59:33,183
Funny, that.

You know, to know...

790
00:59:38,584 --> 00:59:41,005
But the thing is, it's that I am still scared.

791
00:59:41,964 --> 00:59:43,427
I am really scared.

792
00:59:46,554 --> 00:59:48,014
Nobody will mourn for me,

793
00:59:48,039 --> 00:59:49,733
no one will pray for my soul.

794
00:59:53,376 --> 00:59:54,858
Will you mourn for me?

795
00:59:56,673 --> 00:59:58,108
Will you say a prayer for me?

796
00:59:59,339 --> 01:00:00,530
Or is it too late?

797
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:07,217
I mean, I would say one for myself,

798
01:00:07,241 --> 01:00:08,983
but I have never prayed in my life, so...

799
01:00:10,837 --> 01:00:12,287
Nobody ever taught me how.

800
01:00:16,815 --> 01:00:18,514
Nobody ever taught me how.

801
01:00:30,275 --> 01:00:31,412
A baby.

802
01:00:44,461 --> 01:00:46,069
There is a baby with you?

803
01:00:49,492 --> 01:00:51,139
Is that a lullaby you are singing?

804
01:00:54,295 --> 01:00:55,733
That's so sweet.

805
01:00:58,577 --> 01:01:00,357
I used to sing to my baby.

806
01:01:04,556 --> 01:01:06,264
I hope I see her soon.

807
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:19,652
That's nice, Aningaaq.
Keep singing, just like that.

808
01:02:21,926 --> 01:02:23,973
Sing me to sleep and I will sleep.

809
01:02:26,357 --> 01:02:29,504
Keep singing.
And sing and sing.

810
01:02:59,922 --> 01:03:01,803
No, no, no, don't!

811
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:47,441
Check your watch.
13 hours and 11 minutes.

812
01:03:47,692 --> 01:03:49,972
Call Anatoly and tell him he is been bumped.

813
01:03:50,769 --> 01:03:52,808
It's a little gloomy in here, isn't it?
How did you?

814
01:03:53,108 --> 01:03:55,657
Trust me, it's a hell of a story.
But how...

815
01:03:58,399 --> 01:03:59,528
That's better.

816
01:04:00,441 --> 01:04:01,701
I found a little extra...

817
01:04:02,161 --> 01:04:03,880
a little extra battery power.

818
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,317
It helps that I didn't
have you around to distract me.

819
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:08,036
I have to say.

820
01:04:09,016 --> 01:04:11,067
I am glad to see you, I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

821
01:04:11,385 --> 01:04:12,736
Did you find the vodka?

822
01:04:13,605 --> 01:04:14,465
You...

823
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:16,372
You never told me where...
Oh well.

824
01:04:16,397 --> 01:04:17,445
Where it was so...

825
01:04:23,514 --> 01:04:24,515
To Anatoly.

826
01:04:25,326 --> 01:04:26,641
Na zdorovje.

827
01:04:32,292 --> 01:04:33,274
No?

828
01:04:33,555 --> 01:04:34,492
Alright.

829
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,526
Let's get out of here.

830
01:04:38,711 --> 01:04:40,737
The Chinese station is about
a hundred miles.

831
01:04:40,983 --> 01:04:42,883
Just a little Sunday drive.

832
01:04:43,515 --> 01:04:44,951
We can't.
Sure we can.

833
01:04:45,308 --> 01:04:46,863
There is no fuel, I tried everything.

834
01:04:46,888 --> 01:04:48,873
Well, there is always something we can do.

835
01:04:49,049 --> 01:04:50,378
I tried everything.

836
01:04:50,503 --> 01:04:52,269
Did you try the soft landing jets?

837
01:04:52,441 --> 01:04:53,794
They are for landing. So...

838
01:04:53,818 --> 01:04:55,338
Well, landing is launching.
It's the same thing.

839
01:04:55,362 --> 01:04:56,901
Didn't you learn about that in training?

840
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,166
I never got to land the simulator.
I told you that.

841
01:04:59,191 --> 01:05:00,134
But you know about it.

842
01:05:00,158 --> 01:05:01,875
And I crashed it every time.
Listen.

843
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:03,697
Do you want to go back,
or do you want to stay here?

844
01:05:07,346 --> 01:05:08,993
I get it, it's nice up here.

845
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,522
You can just...

846
01:05:14,416 --> 01:05:16,284
shut down all the systems,

847
01:05:17,353 --> 01:05:18,830
turn out all the lights...

848
01:05:20,327 --> 01:05:22,494
and just close your eyes
and tune out everybody.

849
01:05:23,664 --> 01:05:25,213
There is nobody up here that can hurt you.

850
01:05:26,098 --> 01:05:27,174
It's safe.

851
01:05:31,002 --> 01:05:33,236
I mean, what's the point of going on?
What's the point of living?

852
01:05:38,422 --> 01:05:39,632
Your kid died.

853
01:05:40,203 --> 01:05:41,836
Doesn't get any rougher than that.

854
01:05:44,809 --> 01:05:46,765
But still, it's a matter of what you do now.

855
01:05:48,883 --> 01:05:51,732
If you decide to go,
then you got to just get on with it.

856
01:05:52,853 --> 01:05:54,818
Sit back, enjoy the ride.

857
01:05:55,914 --> 01:05:59,475
You got to plant both your feet on
the ground and start living life.

858
01:05:59,779 --> 01:06:03,154
How did you get here?
I am telling you, it's a hell of a story.

859
01:06:03,984 --> 01:06:04,991
Hey, Ryan?

860
01:06:05,108 --> 01:06:06,186
What?

861
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:08,474
It's time to go home.

862
01:06:52,501 --> 01:06:53,534
Landing...

863
01:06:55,973 --> 01:06:56,959
Landing...

864
01:06:57,253 --> 01:06:59,542
Landing is launching.

865
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:01,690
I said...

866
01:07:15,908 --> 01:07:17,188
Ok, landing, landing.

867
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:18,915
Landing is green.

868
01:07:29,932 --> 01:07:30,724
Ok.

869
01:07:32,884 --> 01:07:33,746
Ok,

870
01:07:34,708 --> 01:07:36,403
landing.
Alright.

871
01:07:37,207 --> 01:07:37,792
Ok.

872
01:07:37,886 --> 01:07:41,793
Soft landing jets trigger automatically
at 3 meters before landing, so...

873
01:07:44,947 --> 01:07:47,005
You are a clever son of a bitch, Matt.

874
01:07:47,193 --> 01:07:48,277
I need to...

875
01:07:49,254 --> 01:07:51,597
I need to get rid of the B.O and...

876
01:07:51,738 --> 01:07:53,109
the engine module.

877
01:07:54,865 --> 01:07:55,839
Right.
Ok.

878
01:07:56,988 --> 01:07:57,754
Ok.

879
01:07:59,973 --> 01:08:00,777
Ok.

880
01:08:03,958 --> 01:08:05,564
Tri-module separation.

881
01:08:06,993 --> 01:08:07,809
Go.

882
01:08:22,571 --> 01:08:23,325
Ok.

883
01:08:24,756 --> 01:08:26,606
Houston, here is the tricky part.

884
01:08:27,396 --> 01:08:28,989
Soyuz has to think

885
01:08:29,718 --> 01:08:31,053
we are 3 meters...

886
01:08:31,819 --> 01:08:33,085
off the Earth.

887
01:08:34,129 --> 01:08:35,015
Alright.

888
01:08:35,952 --> 01:08:36,632
Ok.

889
01:08:37,128 --> 01:08:38,097
Hey Matt?

890
01:08:38,822 --> 01:08:42,222
Since I had to listen to endless
hours of your storytelling this week,

891
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,813
I need for you to do me a favor.

892
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:47,611
You are gonna see a little girl,

893
01:08:47,635 --> 01:08:48,696
with brown hair,

894
01:08:49,282 --> 01:08:51,386
very messy, lots of knots.

895
01:08:52,058 --> 01:08:53,790
She doesn't like to brush it.

896
01:08:54,496 --> 01:08:55,602
That's ok.

897
01:08:56,415 --> 01:08:57,693
Her name is Sarah.

898
01:08:58,966 --> 01:09:00,572
Can you please tell her

899
01:09:01,684 --> 01:09:03,587
that Mama found her red shoe?

900
01:09:04,956 --> 01:09:07,047
She was so worried about that shoe, Matt.

901
01:09:07,936 --> 01:09:09,571
But it was just right under the bed.

902
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:16,242
Give her a big hug and a big kiss for me,

903
01:09:16,267 --> 01:09:17,984
and tell her that Mama misses her.

904
01:09:19,157 --> 01:09:21,022
You tell her that she is my angel.

905
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:23,763
And she makes me so proud.

906
01:09:23,788 --> 01:09:25,288
So, so proud.

907
01:09:30,397 --> 01:09:32,273
And you tell her that I am not quitting.

908
01:09:39,859 --> 01:09:41,678
You tell her that I love her, Matt.

909
01:09:42,877 --> 01:09:45,038
You tell her that I love her so much.

910
01:09:47,968 --> 01:09:49,534
Can you do that for me?

911
01:09:52,348 --> 01:09:53,471
Roger that?

912
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:56,870
Here we go.

913
01:10:34,135 --> 01:10:36,120
<i>You are losing altitude, Tiangong.</i>

914
01:10:39,237 --> 01:10:42,198
<i>You keep dropping and you are gonna
kiss the atmosphere.</i>

915
01:10:43,569 --> 01:10:46,253
<i>But not without me,
because you are my last ride.</i>

916
01:10:47,859 --> 01:10:48,526
<i>Ok.</i>

917
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:50,933
<i>Wait.</i>

918
01:10:58,731 --> 01:10:59,511
<i>5.</i>

919
01:11:01,277 --> 01:11:02,027
<i>4.</i>

920
01:11:03,596 --> 01:11:04,324
<i>3.</i>

921
01:11:05,757 --> 01:11:07,105
<i>No more just driving.</i>

922
01:11:09,111 --> 01:11:10,222
<i>Let's go home.</i>

923
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:18,643
<i>Steady.
Ok, come on, come on.</i>

924
01:11:19,777 --> 01:11:20,778
<i>Steady, steady.</i>

925
01:11:22,073 --> 01:11:23,871
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

926
01:11:27,982 --> 01:11:29,584
<i>Where are you?
Where are you? 45...</i>

927
01:11:29,843 --> 01:11:30,968
<i>90, 180.</i>

928
01:11:31,023 --> 01:11:31,890
<i>180.</i>

929
01:11:40,646 --> 01:11:41,647
<i>Come on.</i>

930
01:11:50,969 --> 01:11:51,935
<i>Ok, ok.</i>

931
01:12:07,581 --> 01:12:08,583
<i>Alright.</i>

932
01:12:09,568 --> 01:12:11,071
<i>Damn it.</i>

933
01:12:12,475 --> 01:12:16,688
<i>Down, down, down.
Come to Mama.</i>

934
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:30,691
<i>Ok.</i>

935
01:13:38,488 --> 01:13:39,598
Ok. Shit!

936
01:13:46,702 --> 01:13:47,262
Ok.

937
01:13:49,696 --> 01:13:50,965
Shenzhou, come on.

938
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:52,887
Shenzhou. Shenzhou.

939
01:13:54,106 --> 01:13:54,710
Fuck.

940
01:13:55,156 --> 01:13:56,294
Ok, this way.

941
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:58,067
Shenzhou.

942
01:14:56,812 --> 01:14:58,482
In the Soyuz, the power button is...

943
01:14:59,326 --> 01:14:59,913
here.

944
01:15:03,342 --> 01:15:03,987
Ok...

945
01:15:04,073 --> 01:15:05,522
undocking, undocking.

946
01:15:07,315 --> 01:15:08,340
Eeni, meeni...

947
01:15:09,476 --> 01:15:10,739
Ok, that doesn't sound good.

948
01:15:11,528 --> 01:15:12,254
Miny...

949
01:15:13,543 --> 01:15:14,223
moe.

950
01:15:15,904 --> 01:15:17,076
No hablo chino.

951
01:15:18,869 --> 01:15:19,709
Miny...

952
01:15:20,157 --> 01:15:21,060
moe.

953
01:15:22,599 --> 01:15:23,215
Ok.

954
01:15:23,653 --> 01:15:24,513
Ok, good.

955
01:15:33,668 --> 01:15:35,299
Houston.
Houston, in the blind.

956
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,924
This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone

957
01:15:38,027 --> 01:15:39,619
reporting from the Shenzhou.

958
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:41,714
I am about to undock from Tiangong...

959
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:48,932
And I have a bad feeling about this mission.

960
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:53,603
Reminds me of a story, Houston...

961
01:15:56,281 --> 01:15:56,957
Never...

962
01:15:57,361 --> 01:15:58,700
Never mind the story, Houston.

963
01:15:59,286 --> 01:16:00,587
Never mind the story.

964
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:04,673
It's getting hot in here. Ok.

965
01:16:05,095 --> 01:16:05,944
Alright.

966
01:16:06,881 --> 01:16:07,491
Ok.

967
01:16:08,615 --> 01:16:09,970
Alright, the way I see it,

968
01:16:10,796 --> 01:16:12,615
there is only two possible outcomes.

969
01:16:13,097 --> 01:16:17,359
Either I make it down there in one piece
and I have one hell of a story to tell,

970
01:16:18,347 --> 01:16:20,078
or I burn up in the next 10 minutes.

971
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:23,817
Either way, whichever way...

972
01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:26,258
no harm, no foul!

973
01:16:34,179 --> 01:16:35,383
Because either way...

974
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,680
it will be one hell of a ride.

975
01:16:42,736 --> 01:16:43,759
I am ready.
