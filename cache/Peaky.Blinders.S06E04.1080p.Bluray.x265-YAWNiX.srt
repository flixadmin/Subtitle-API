1
00:00:00,999 --> 00:00:03,759
{\an8}My brother sends his
apologies for not being here

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,599
{\an8}and would like to invite
all of you to his home

3
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:06,919
for a meeting.

4
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:08,919
All you have to do
is sit with Jack Nelson

5
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:10,999
and talk to him about
a new golden age.

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:12,559
If anyone's
going to kill Tommy Shelby. <i>..</i>

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,719
It will be you.
The future belongs to us.

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,239
Your daughter has consumption.

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,679
Consumption is
a very infectious disease.

10
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:21,799
<i>While they're X-raying
Ruby, they have to X-ray us.</i>

11
00:00:21,919 --> 00:00:23,719
It'll be the girl's mother
who laid the curse.

12
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,919
<i>Perhaps she waited
till your little girl was seven</i>

13
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,359
<i>so you'd know how it feels.</i>

14
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:29,879
Now that I'm without whisky,
I can hear the spirits clearly,

15
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:32,319
and they are saying that Ruby
will be well if I make amends.

16
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,519
She's gone, Tommy.

17
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,199
Arthur?

18
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,359
I've written some words.

19
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,799
I can't speak 'em.

20
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,999
You're the oldest.

21
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:40,639
You speak 'em for me.

22
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:50,479
I'm sorry, Brother.

23
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,319
I can'<i>t</i> do <i>it.</i>

24
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:25,119
We could have afforded
a golden carriage.

25
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:31,559
She deserved a golden carriage.

26
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:38,519
But we didn'<i>t</i> afford ourselves
that luxury. <i>..</i>

27
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,959
<i>..</i> .Because gold doesn'<i>t</i> work.

28
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:52,319
That was the last lesson
that Ruby taught us.

29
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:12,879
This place was her favourite
place in the whole world.

30
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:14,119
And she used to say...

31
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:16,919
..."Dad...

32
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:22,919
<i>..</i> ."you never know what's
going to come down the river."

33
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:26,079
And it's true...

34
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,239
<i>..</i> .cos little Ruby's fate. <i>..</i>

35
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,239
...came a thousand miles
too soon.

36
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,199
But in her name and in her
memory, things will change.

37
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:47,399
And whatever comes
down that river from now on. <i>..</i>

38
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,119
<i>...we</i> will make good. <i>..</i>

39
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:54,839
<i>...we</i> will make peaceful
and honest and good

40
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:57,159
and send it on down the river
better than it was.

41
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:59,399
In her memory we will do this.

42
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:10,719
But for now, we send her on. <i>..</i>

43
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,799
<i>...to</i> wherever it is you go. <i>..</i>

44
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,599
<i>..</i> .In the hope that
if there is a destination. <i>..</i>

45
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,959
<i>...that it</i>'s a yard like this,

46
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:26,719
with horses
and boats for her to play on.

47
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,679
Tom?

48
00:06:41,679 --> 00:06:44,359
I've got the petrol.

49
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,079
Who will light the flame?

50
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:52,799
Jeremiah?

51
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,919
Jeremiah, you made her laugh.

52
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,199
You light the flame.

53
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,519
No, no!

54
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,919
- No!
- Lizzie, Lizzie...

55
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,719
No, you won'<i>t</i> burn her! No!

56
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,079
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

57
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:18,199
I just want to see her.
I just want to see her face.

58
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,999
We'll go and see her together.
Come on.

59
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:21,519
We'll go and see her together.

60
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,559
Yeah.

61
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:37,359
Oh, my baby.

62
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:58,799
The devils who did this
will pay, Ruby.

63
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:04,079
What do you mean?

64
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,879
What do you mean?

65
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:12,239
Where are you going, Tommy?

66
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,599
Riley! I think
the police are here.

67
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:11,319
Evadne Barwell?

68
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:14,519
Yeah. Who's asking?

69
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,999
I am here on behalf
of the blue sapphire.

70
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:30,679
Don'<i>t</i> shoot! There are babies!

71
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,199
BABY CRIES)

72
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,319
Gold dust.

73
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:04,319
Our business is done, Esme.

74
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:05,839
Get out of the car.

75
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,159
Not quite done, Tommy.

76
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:10,199
I thought this would be
a good time.

77
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:12,079
In fact, it's the perfect time.

78
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:15,439
Some business
is still unfinished.

79
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:20,559
Christians say, "The Lord
gives, the Lord takes away."

80
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,079
Our spirits are the same.

81
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:25,079
Spirits just took away
your child.

82
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:27,279
Get out of the car, Esme.

83
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:29,999
The same spirits want to give
you a different child, Tommy.

84
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:33,119
What child?

85
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:36,279
A daughter lost...

86
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,719
...a son found.

87
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:44,519
Before you went to France, a
long time ago, at Appleby Fair,

88
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,319
you slept with a girl.

89
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:48,919
Her name was Zelda. I met her.

90
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:54,159
She said you slept together
under a hazel tree in May 1914.

91
00:13:55,799 --> 00:14:00,319
When she fell pregnant, her
father threatened to kill you,

92
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:04,319
but you'd already joined the
Army and gone away to France.

93
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:10,079
You remember the girl and the
hazel tree, don'<i>t</i> you, Tommy?

94
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,559
Whoever that boy is, Esme. <i>..</i>

95
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,639
...whoever he is,
our business is done here.

96
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,479
I brought you to this camp
for a reason,

97
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:24,159
and I brought him, as well.

98
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,959
He is yours.

99
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,399
A boy born with hazel eyes.

100
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,959
He calls himself Duke.

101
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:33,919
His mother is dead.

102
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,919
He's a thief.

103
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,759
He works the fairground,
but he says he wants

104
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:40,599
more to his life than
big wheels and carousels.

105
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:47,159
If the losing of Ruby has left
a hole in your heart...

106
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,239
<i>...</i> I'll send him to you.

107
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,519
If you give me
a bit more gold...

108
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,079
<i>...</i> I'll tell him Tommy Shelby
can offer a man

109
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:01,439
far, far more than big wheels
and carousels.

110
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,599
Is our business done
or not, Tommy?

111
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,359
I know where you <i>went.</i>

112
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,239
I'm going to spend more hours

113
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:52,159
working in the Commons
with Mr Churchill.

114
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:54,039
- His fight is my fight.
- I sat like a stone

115
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:56,079
and thought about you
killing someone in her name.

116
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:58,159
The Shelby institutions
will be expanded.

117
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:01,999
I will set up a fund
to research the causes

118
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:03,159
and cures for consumption.

119
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,199
Did the woman you killed
have children?

120
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:07,279
10,000 children die
every year, Lizzie.

121
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,119
- Go to bed, Tommy.
- I've been reading

122
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:11,079
- about new research.
- Stop and close

123
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,639
- your fucking eyes.
- I will not. <i>..</i>

124
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:13,999
I will not stop!

125
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:16,639
What is this good
that you will become?!

126
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,559
I killed a woman.

127
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,599
I killed a woman and three men.

128
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:34,439
And their bodies will be
thrown aboard the boat,

129
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,879
like all the other bodies,

130
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:38,679
but I am stepping off that boat
and onto another boat.

131
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,759
Do you understand?!

132
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:45,799
Yeah.

133
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:53,823
http://hiqve.com/

134
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:59,559
The doctor
from the sanatorium called

135
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,119
and said that he needs
to speak with you urgently.

136
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:06,239
But I think now you are
beyond the help of doctors.

137
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,679
Lizzie...

138
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:12,239
Frances said Arthur's here.

139
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,359
Tommy?

140
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,759
- Tom?
- Yeah, it's me.

141
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:52,119
Ah, fuck.

142
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:13,519
Arthur, give me a light,
will you?

143
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:15,879
I can'<i>t</i> find my lighter.

144
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,239
I'm sorry I couldn'<i>t</i> speak
at the wagon, Tom.

145
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,519
Don'<i>t</i> be sorry.

146
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,999
What are you doing here?

147
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,799
Waiting for this fucking cup
to fill up.

148
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:58,719
Nearly empty, this barrel.

149
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:02,359
There are plenty
of barrels, Arthur.

150
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:05,359
Start another barrel.

151
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:08,319
I thought maybe they're all
full of fucking blood.

152
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,559
The junk, Tom...

153
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:17,159
...fucks up your mind.

154
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,359
You know, Arthur...

155
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,799
<i>...you</i> was already fucked up.

156
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:32,239
You was fucked up
since you was a kid.

157
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,559
This is my theory.

158
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:42,039
It's from that time
I gave you a beating

159
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:44,039
when you was twelve
and I was nine.

160
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,479
We were fighting
over cigarettes.

161
00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:54,439
Maybe. <i>..</i> when I had you
down on the ground. <i>..</i>

162
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:57,839
<i>...</i> I gave you one too many
to the head.

163
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:00,359
It was a draw, though, Tom.

164
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:01,839
Nah.

165
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:04,199
I beat you.

166
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:06,879
I had you pinned.

167
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,599
You actually didn'<i>t.</i>

168
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,559
- We both agreed.
- You're so fucked

169
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,719
you can'<i>t</i> remember, Brother.

170
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:17,879
I do.

171
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:20,159
I do remember little things.

172
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:21,599
I know you do.

173
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:24,479
So do I.

174
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,639
The fog and the gas
is clearing, eh?

175
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:21,239
Here, that cup's nearly full.
Pass it here.

176
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:26,959
I thought you. <i>..</i>

177
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,479
Tom, you don'<i>t want</i>
stuff any more.

178
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:33,079
Eh?

179
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,759
You don't drink no more, Tom.

180
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:01,839
Even when Polly was gone,
Arthur...

181
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:04,719
<i>...</i> I thought I could just march
and march.

182
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:09,079
If I just kept up that fucking
left, right, left, right,

183
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:12,039
left, right, left, right
fucking rhythm,

184
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,199
I'd never have to stop.

185
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:17,919
Then Ruby <i>went.</i>

186
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,639
I stumbled and crashed.

187
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,679
Now here I am...

188
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:34,799
...sat on me arse...

189
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,319
...on the ground...

190
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,399
...like a fucking toddler...

191
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:43,719
<i>...with</i> me old comrade Arthur.

192
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,199
Yeah.

193
00:22:48,639 --> 00:22:50,519
Remember the January, Arthur?

194
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,439
The family boat?

195
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,719
The whole family
living on something

196
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:00,119
the size of ten of
these fucking barrels?

197
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,839
Remember that night
at Tile Cross...

198
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:10,359
...16 of us
sleeping on the boat?

199
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:11,719
The coppers come.

200
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:15,039
We all swim like rats.

201
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:16,599
Except for Arthur.

202
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,999
Arthur holds them off with
a boathook all on his own.

203
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:25,119
And I remember...

204
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:28,639
...I climbed back up
at the lock and I looked back

205
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:31,399
and saw you waving
that fucking boathook

206
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:32,719
in the coppers' faces...

207
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:35,879
...on your own.

208
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,719
That's when I realised.

209
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:42,359
When I had you on the ground. <i>..</i>

210
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:45,239
<i>..</i> .All them years ago. <i>..</i>

211
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:47,399
<i>...it</i>'s cos you let me win.

212
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:52,679
You wanted me to win.

213
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:59,359
You've wanted me to win
ever since.

214
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:03,199
What chance do I have if you. <i>..</i>

215
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:07,999
<i>..</i> .Start doing that again? Eh?

216
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:13,519
You'll stop. You'll stop
cos the family needs you <i>to.</i>

217
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,799
It's like that long tunnel
on the Dudley stretch.

218
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,679
You remember Dudley Canal,
Line Number 1 ?

219
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:23,919
3, 172 yards

220
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:26,639
of fucking pitch-blackness
and rats swimming.

221
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:27,879
- Yeah.
- And then we'd come

222
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,999
round that corner and
there'd be a shaft of light.

223
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:33,799
And then we'd know.

224
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,239
- Yeah.
- And you and me

225
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:37,319
would both know
it was nearly done.

226
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:42,439
That's where
we are now, Arthur.

227
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,719
Just a few more yards to go.

228
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,479
Then you will change your <i>ways.</i>

229
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,839
And I'll change
the fucking world.

230
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:15,999
We assumed, at this late hour,
you would have had dinner.

231
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:18,159
There are drinks
and sandwiches, if you <i>want.</i>

232
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:19,479
We're not here to eat.

233
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:22,879
Mr Shelby will be down shortly.

234
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,839
Please, tell Mr Shelby
on behalf of us all

235
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,239
that changing the world
can <i>wait.</i>

236
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,999
He doesn'<i>t want to wait.</i>

237
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,359
There is champagne.

238
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:31,199
Oh, goodie.

239
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,079
Charles?

240
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:46,799
I heard cars.

241
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,639
Mr Shelby, the guests are. <i>..</i>

242
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:54,159
I know.

243
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,519
Dad?

244
00:26:56,639 --> 00:26:58,519
There's a Bentley
and a Rolls-Royce.

245
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:02,759
Yeah.

246
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:06,679
Go to bed, Charles.

247
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,759
I can't sleep.

248
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:21,639
I see her when I shut my eyes.

249
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:24,719
Go to your mum.

250
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,839
She'll be awake.

251
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:29,639
- She holds on to me.
- Let her hold on to you.

252
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:33,399
You hear me?

253
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,119
Always let her hold on to you.

254
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:37,879
Go on.

255
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,039
Mr Shelby, the guests said
they would understand if. <i>..</i>

256
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:46,359
Have you served them drinks?

257
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:48,479
- Yes.
- Yeah.

258
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,719
I'm OK, Frances.

259
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:09,599
The agenda is in my head.

260
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:12,919
The agenda is in my head.

261
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,639
I'm OK.

262
00:28:16,639 --> 00:28:18,159
Do I look OK?

263
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:23,879
If someone touches you,
you won'<i>t</i> shatter.

264
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,359
Sing it.

265
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:30,319
Sing <i>it.</i> I love that song.

266
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:33,239
I ...can't be singing
rebel songs

267
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,759
in a house
in grief and mourning.

268
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,919
Sing it to me softly.
It breaks my heart.

269
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:41,319
Don'<i>t</i> look at him.
He's English.

270
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:43,399
He can block his ears.

271
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:47,359
Darling?

272
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:50,879
Should she sing her rebel
IRA song while we wait,

273
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:52,959
or would that be inappropriate?

274
00:28:56,639 --> 00:28:57,759
You know, I went to a meeting

275
00:28:57,879 --> 00:28:59,359
of similar intent to this
in Berlin

276
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:02,599
attended by
the Chancellor himself...

277
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:05,799
...and Göring and Himmler.

278
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,599
It lasted until
the sun came up.

279
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:13,119
We spoke about the future
of the world in a serious <i>way.</i>

280
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:17,879
When the first rays of light
entered the room, we all stood

281
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:20,639
and stared at it as if it were
the world to come.

282
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:24,519
There was no singing,
no giggling.

283
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:29,479
And when breakfast was served
on the terrace,

284
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:31,119
overlooking the mountains,

285
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:32,879
they brought up some Jews.

286
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,919
And while we ate our eggs,
they were forced to eat grass.

287
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:42,439
And we watched
as we sipped our coffee.

288
00:29:48,439 --> 00:29:51,199
We should all remember
this is serious business.

289
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,759
Oh, Diana.

290
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,759
Now look what you've done.
You've killed the mood.

291
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:13,919
Let her sing her fucking song
to raise our spirits.

292
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:15,799
Go on. Please.

293
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:29,439
# In a neat little town
they call Belfast

294
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:33,519
# Apprentice to trade
I was bound

295
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:38,399
# And many's an hour's
sweet happiness

296
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:42,239
# Have I spent
in that neat little town

297
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:45,439
# A sad misfortune
came over me... #

298
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:10,239
Did it break?

299
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,519
Mum will fix it for you.

300
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:30,239
She's not here any more.

301
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:45,799
# Her eyes, they shone
like diamonds

302
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,959
# I thought her the Queen. <i>..</i> #

303
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:49,159
Mr Shelby...

304
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,439
No, please, no condolences.
Thank you all for coming.

305
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:55,119
Now, let's <i>try to</i> find out

306
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:57,799
how this new world of ours
will look, shall we?

307
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:06,519
Perhaps, Mr Mosley, we can turn

308
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:08,519
to what practical things
Mr Nelson can do

309
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,479
to...further our cause
while he's in the country.

310
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,959
It's me who has the ear of the
President of the United States.

311
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:18,119
Which is kind of
<i>why</i> I'm here, right?

312
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,559
We do indeed have things

313
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,239
for you to whisper
into the President's ear.

314
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:27,999
Tell him we are England.
We are the mood England is in.

315
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:32,399
And in Ireland, appeasers
to the English abound,

316
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:35,279
but we represent
the true, liberated spirit

317
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:38,079
of the country that populated
your own.

318
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,279
I hear about communists
in both places.

319
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:45,359
We are the bulwark
against them.

320
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:49,319
When it comes
to the working class,

321
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:52,479
we could move our people
from republicanism

322
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:54,839
to fascism with just a nudge.

323
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,279
They trust us.

324
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:01,279
You ride with hounds,
Mr Mosley.

325
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,799
Will you hunt communists?

326
00:35:02,919 --> 00:35:06,239
Oh, my hounds are baying.

327
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:07,879
Shelby...

328
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:09,639
<i>...you</i> run as a socialist.

329
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,639
Mr Shelby has one of

330
00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:21,759
the largest Commons majorities
in England.

331
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:24,279
In the heart of England.

332
00:35:25,279 --> 00:35:27,559
When the time comes,
he'll resign his party whip

333
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:29,399
and run as an independent.

334
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:35,119
But underneath, do you truly

335
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,719
believe in the cause,
Mr Shelby?

336
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,879
I'm here.

337
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:52,119
Mr Nelson,
I'm here four nights...

338
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:01,119
<i>..</i> .four nights after,
and I am here...

339
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:04,599
...in this room,
in this meeting.

340
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:06,319
I am here and I am serious.

341
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:10,759
Prove it to him.

342
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:16,479
Prove it physically.

343
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:30,239
Perish Judah.

344
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:39,519
Perish Judah.

345
00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:48,119
That thing is going to
get us killed.

346
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:52,879
Go to bed.

347
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:57,239
At school, they've stopped
talking to me.

348
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:03,519
They say the black rubs off.

349
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:08,079
When they come to power. <i>..</i>

350
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,799
<i>...they</i>'ll take her off you.

351
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:12,839
They're going to
separate us all out.

352
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,919
They'll send her to Africa.

353
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:19,879
Yeah?

354
00:37:20,879 --> 00:37:22,479
And where will they send you?

355
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,559
Where will they send you, Karl?

356
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:28,999
You're half Gypsy, so. <i>..</i>

357
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,679
<i>...to</i> Egypt, maybe?

358
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,399
Something I never
told you before. <i>..</i>

359
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:40,239
<i>..</i> .Because it wasn'<i>t</i> important.

360
00:37:41,879 --> 00:37:43,359
Maybe now it is.

361
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:46,399
Your dad was Jewish.

362
00:37:48,439 --> 00:37:51,559
He was the son
of a tailor in Stechford.

363
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:53,159
They changed their name
to Thorne

364
00:37:53,279 --> 00:37:55,839
to stop the bricks
coming through the window.

365
00:37:57,759 --> 00:37:59,679
So where will they send you,
Karl?

366
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:06,479
Mr Nelson, you can report back
to your president

367
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:09,399
that the aristocracy
and the meritocracy are united

368
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:12,519
in their conviction
that a new order is coming.

369
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,639
Also, Mr Nelson, at present

370
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:19,239
our weapons are coming
from Germany.

371
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,479
The British are closing
our supply lines down.

372
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,959
We would value
a supply from Boston.

373
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:26,519
Weapons I can give you,

374
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,719
if they're to be used
in a good cause.

375
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:31,719
And while on the subject
of import and export,

376
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,079
Mr Shelby,

377
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:35,359
in light of
our new relationship

378
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,519
and since you have
proven your commitment

379
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:39,319
in a most extraordinary <i>way...</i>

380
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:42,239
<i>..</i> .Boston is now
officially open

381
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:44,719
for the importation
of your merchandise.

382
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:51,719
Good.

383
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:35,439
If we have established
what we came here to establish,

384
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:37,399
perhaps we should all
say goodnight.

385
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:38,639
Absolutely.

386
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:27,999
That's the same typewriter
you bought me

387
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:29,479
all those years ago. <i>..</i>

388
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:33,679
...to help me become
more respectable.

389
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:35,239
Do you remember?

390
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:38,159
Yeah.

391
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:46,439
This arrived.

392
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:48,959
It's from the sanatorium.

393
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:52,919
I've already paid
Ruby's medical bills.

394
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:55,639
I don'<i>t</i> think it's a bill.

395
00:40:55,759 --> 00:40:57,119
It says it's urgent.

396
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:59,879
It's from
the senior consultant.

397
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:19,879
Why didn'<i>t</i> you come to bed?

398
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:26,839
Why didn'<i>t</i> you come to bed?

399
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:34,719
I'm typing up
my recollection of the meeting.

400
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,519
If I ... If I do it
straight <i>away...</i>

401
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:41,839
...I can quote people
word for word.

402
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,959
The information is more...

403
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:46,239
...useful to Mr Churchill

404
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:47,919
if it is word for word.

405
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:16,319
I burned her chair.

406
00:42:18,999 --> 00:42:21,159
The paint on the wood
left a smell in the air.

407
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:24,039
I didn'<i>t</i> open the window.

408
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:28,239
I quite like the smell.

409
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:55,559
Not <i>yet.</i>

410
00:42:58,239 --> 00:42:59,919
Not <i>yet.</i>

411
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:04,239
I have this work to do,
cos now I know. <i>..</i>

412
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:06,959
<i>...that</i> I will change. <i>..</i>

413
00:43:08,999 --> 00:43:10,679
<i>...that</i> I have to change.

414
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:14,879
And change for good, Lizzie.

415
00:43:20,479 --> 00:43:22,239
Not just <i>yet.</i>

416
00:43:53,479 --> 00:43:54,839
Hello?

417
00:43:58,679 --> 00:43:59,839
Oh.

418
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:16,359
I saw him leave.

419
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:18,999
He keeps this apartment

420
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,719
expressly for this purpose,
doesn't he?

421
00:45:22,919 --> 00:45:25,279
Are you following me,
Mr Shelby?

422
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,159
I'm flattered. <i>..</i>

423
00:45:28,279 --> 00:45:30,119
<i>...but why?</i>

424
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,959
When I do business
with someone,

425
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,679
I make it <i>my</i> business
to know their secrets.

426
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,359
Mosley's reputation
is no secret.

427
00:45:40,399 --> 00:45:42,079
Not him, you.

428
00:45:44,879 --> 00:45:46,359
How did you know I'd come here?

429
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,519
I know things.

430
00:45:49,639 --> 00:45:51,959
I read people's minds,
you know?

431
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:57,959
Little glances across tables.
It's a gift.

432
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,239
The whole family. <i>..</i>

433
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:01,959
<i>..</i> .Witches and sorcerers.

434
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:13,559
Your uncle will disown you. <i>..</i>

435
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:15,679
...fucking his business partner

436
00:46:15,799 --> 00:46:17,559
behind his back.

437
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:20,879
- You think he has morals?
- He's a Catholic.

438
00:46:20,999 --> 00:46:23,519
Men do what they want,
women do what they are told.

439
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:27,279
Will you tell Michael?

440
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:29,879
Michael is family.

441
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:33,639
We are a family healed.

442
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:37,039
You have no interest in me. <i>..</i>

443
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:38,759
...or in Michael...

444
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:42,999
<i>..</i> .so <i>why</i> don'<i>t</i> you just tell
me what you actually want?

445
00:46:54,799 --> 00:46:56,599
You will be with Mosley. <i>..</i>

446
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,999
...when he's in Berlin.

447
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:01,519
You'll be in the room
when he meets

448
00:47:01,639 --> 00:47:03,999
senior members
of the German government.

449
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:06,319
I want to know
what is discussed. <i>..</i>

450
00:47:07,439 --> 00:47:09,479
<i>..</i> .And I want to know
what is decided.

451
00:47:11,959 --> 00:47:13,639
And if I lie?

452
00:47:15,479 --> 00:47:16,999
I will know.

453
00:47:25,879 --> 00:47:28,399
You know, Michael thinks
you're the devil. <i>..</i>

454
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:31,919
<i>..</i> .And I think he might
actually be right.

455
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,319
That was the other reason
I came here.

456
00:47:35,439 --> 00:47:39,039
What are Michael's real
intentions toward me, Gina?

457
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:42,439
And if you lie, I will know.

458
00:47:46,919 --> 00:47:47,919
Tommy...

459
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,119
...he intends
to complete the deal.

460
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,679
And then you both walk away.

461
00:48:09,439 --> 00:48:11,239
Fuck!

462
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:33,839
Come.

463
00:49:36,279 --> 00:49:38,199
Mr Shelby? Dr Holford.

464
00:49:41,319 --> 00:49:42,439
Send him in.

465
00:49:49,759 --> 00:49:53,439
You said it had to be
in person. Here I am.

466
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,479
You might want to sit down.

467
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,399
Mr Shelby, I know

468
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:07,919
that you are still
grieving for your daughter. <i>..</i>

469
00:50:08,919 --> 00:50:10,959
<i>...but</i> I have news
that cannot <i>wait.</i>

470
00:50:15,999 --> 00:50:18,879
When you were X-rayed
and examined

471
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:21,479
at the sanatorium
ten days ago. <i>..</i>

472
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:26,519
<i>..</i> .There was no TB
found in your lung.

473
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:30,759
But I am afraid
they found something else. <i>..</i>

474
00:50:31,759 --> 00:50:34,599
<i>..</i> .Something related to
your daughter's illness.

475
00:50:37,919 --> 00:50:40,759
They tried to speak to you
at the hospital

476
00:50:40,879 --> 00:50:42,639
but you were not co-operating.

477
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:46,919
After your daughter's death...

478
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:49,759
<i>...you</i> could not be found
to be informed in person.

479
00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:54,279
Eventually, as your personal
doctor, they called me.

480
00:50:57,399 --> 00:50:58,639
I didn'<i>t</i> offer you tea.

481
00:50:58,759 --> 00:51:00,919
You look like death.
Do you want tea?

482
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:03,319
No.

483
00:51:04,919 --> 00:51:07,839
At the sanatorium,
they conducted blood tests.

484
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,199
The tests suggest
that the shadow you can see

485
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:15,519
at the base of your skull. <i>..</i>

486
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,119
...is not cancer...

487
00:51:18,479 --> 00:51:20,039
<i>...it</i> is tuberculoma. <i>..</i>

488
00:51:22,399 --> 00:51:25,999
...a tubercular growth caused
by the same bacteria as TB.

489
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:32,159
You may have picked it up
from your daughter.

490
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:37,879
Once this disease enters
a household, it can run wild.

491
00:51:37,999 --> 00:51:40,519
It can be transmitted
with a simple kiss.

492
00:51:44,679 --> 00:51:47,319
It seems the Shelby household
is no exception.

493
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:55,919
Mr Shelby, as I say, I am aware
that you are still grieving. <i>..</i>

494
00:51:56,039 --> 00:51:59,239
<i>...but</i> you must understand
this is very serious.

495
00:52:01,479 --> 00:52:04,799
From the size of the tumour,
expansion must have been rapid.

496
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:10,519
I have no doubt that you are
already experiencing symptoms.

497
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:13,719
Have you recently
suffered seizures?

498
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:16,599
Bouts of weakness?

499
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:19,119
Dissociation?

500
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:20,559
Hallucinations?

501
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:30,279
Why didn'<i>t</i> you come and see me?

502
00:52:32,879 --> 00:52:34,119
I have work to do.

503
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:39,999
Am I a danger to others?

504
00:52:41,479 --> 00:52:42,959
No.

505
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:46,679
Unlike TB, tuberculoma
is not infectious.

506
00:52:46,799 --> 00:52:50,719
Mr Shelby,
it is not infectious. <i>..</i>

507
00:52:50,839 --> 00:52:52,959
<i>...but</i> in your case. <i>..</i>

508
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:55,519
...I am afraid
it is inoperable.

509
00:52:57,159 --> 00:52:59,039
The growth is
in your brain stem.

510
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:00,559
Any attempt to remove it

511
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:03,319
would result in trauma
and brain haemorrhage.

512
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:09,399
Whilst you were
refusing my calls,

513
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,639
I showed your X-rays

514
00:53:10,759 --> 00:53:13,279
to three of the best surgeons
in the country.

515
00:53:16,799 --> 00:53:18,879
They all said
they would not operate. <i>..</i>

516
00:53:19,879 --> 00:53:22,159
<i>..</i> .As it would be futile.

517
00:53:22,279 --> 00:53:25,679
Of course, you will want

518
00:53:25,799 --> 00:53:28,359
a second opinion for yourself.

519
00:53:28,479 --> 00:53:29,559
Dr Helen Rutherford

520
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:33,039
at St Thomas'.
She is a friend.

521
00:53:44,359 --> 00:53:45,759
This...

522
00:53:47,639 --> 00:53:48,959
How bad will it get?

523
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:57,559
As the tumour grows,

524
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:01,439
the rate of physical and mental
deterioration will increase.

525
00:54:05,999 --> 00:54:10,719
Eventually, you will need
people around you constantly. <i>..</i>

526
00:54:10,839 --> 00:54:13,039
<i>...who</i> love you very much.

527
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,559
How long?

528
00:54:20,759 --> 00:54:22,519
I understand
that you have defeated

529
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:24,039
many enemies, Mr Shelby.

530
00:54:25,239 --> 00:54:27,319
Now you have a new one. <i>..</i>

531
00:54:27,439 --> 00:54:28,759
...inside you.

532
00:54:30,279 --> 00:54:31,679
You cannot defeat <i>it...</i>

533
00:54:33,159 --> 00:54:36,439
<i>...but</i> you <i>can</i> keep it at bay
for a while.

534
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:37,839
If you live correctly,

535
00:54:37,959 --> 00:54:39,919
if you are determined
and if you fight. <i>..</i>

536
00:54:40,039 --> 00:54:41,719
I asked you a question.

537
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:43,719
This time I want an answer.

538
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,639
I don'<i>t want</i>
your fucking platitudes.

539
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:49,919
How long before I need
people around me

540
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:51,719
who love me very much?

541
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,839
- Sorry.
- It's fine, Lizzie.

542
00:54:57,959 --> 00:54:58,999
My accountant here

543
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:00,559
was just leaving.

544
00:55:05,399 --> 00:55:07,799
I will telephone you
when I get back to London.

545
00:55:07,919 --> 00:55:09,119
No, I don'<i>t</i> have enough time.

546
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:12,039
You're an accountant,
give me a fucking number now.

547
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:15,239
One year.

548
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,159
Perhaps 18 months.

549
00:55:17,279 --> 00:55:20,639
That's fine.
That's all I need to know.

550
00:55:20,759 --> 00:55:24,319
I will adjust my finances
accordingly. Thank you.

551
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:28,079
I will write to you, explaining
the full implications.

552
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,639
Yeah, thank you.

553
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:34,799
Good day.

554
00:55:43,439 --> 00:55:44,839
Something serious?

555
00:55:45,999 --> 00:55:48,239
No. No, just a...

556
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:51,439
<i>..</i> .just a bill I wasn'<i>t</i>
expecting, and I ...

557
00:55:52,439 --> 00:55:53,999
<i>...</i> I'll have to pay <i>it.</i>

558
00:56:03,919 --> 00:56:05,999
Will you give me
a minute on me own, Lizzie?

559
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:11,399
Yeah.

560
00:56:26,959 --> 00:56:28,239
Not a devil...

561
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:34,039
<i>..</i> .just an ordinary mortal man.

562
00:56:39,919 --> 00:56:42,359
<i>There will be a war
in this family...</i>

563
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:46,119
<i>...and one of you will die.</i>

564
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,599
Polly...

565
00:56:51,879 --> 00:56:54,439
<i>..</i> .just give me enough time
to do what I have to do.

566
00:56:56,639 --> 00:56:57,959
<i>Kill.</i>

567
00:56:58,079 --> 00:56:59,799
<i>Kill...</i>

568
00:56:59,823 --> 00:57:07,823
