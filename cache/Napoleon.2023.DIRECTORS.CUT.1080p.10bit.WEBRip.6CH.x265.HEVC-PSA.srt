{\an8}Half the French
fleet is trapped there.

If we lose those ships,
the Republic will fall.

42
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:32,124
Lucky for us, there are only
2,000 English troops in Toulon.

43
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,423
But we are short of artillery and led
by a general who was a court painter.

44
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,010
It is not necessary to
recapture Toulon itself.

45
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:47,222
The town is not a
town. The town is a port.

If the harbor's untenable
to the English fleet,

the town must surrender.

My brother, Captain
Bonaparte, as artillery officer,

00:05:56,398 --> 00:06:00,611
has organized heated
shots against English ships.

He has proven his
commitment to the Republic.

00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,451
And how do you propose
to take the harbor?

52
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,746
Capture the fort that
dominates the harbor,

53
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,789
and you have the city.

54

We must make an example,
or other cities will fall.

[Napoleon] Lucien, my dear

The troops are in a poor state, and your
conscripts untrained and undisciplined.

We are collecting scrap iron to recast
small mortars more suitable for my plan.

If we do not succeed,

those in power will only see us as
Corsican ruffians unfit for higher office,

My father's saber.

329
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:29,527
I-It was taken from him before
he was arrested and executed.

Yes?

331

I-It would mean a great deal to me
and to my mother if it were returned to us.

332

It's all we have of him.

333
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:39,621
The sword is a weapon.

I cannot allow citizens to have
weapons in their possession.

The sword is a keepsake for me
to remember my dear late father.

336

Perhaps, but it is a
weapon nevertheless.

Young man, why are you here?

338
00:34:57,264 --> 00:35:01,143
My mother said that you were the only
man of authority to retrieve the sword.

339
00:35:13,614 --> 00:35:16,283
All of these are from officers
who were sentenced to die.

Did no one think to attach
names to any of them?

No.

My husband had
more than one lover.

There is a belief

that there is an attack on the
Council coming by this mob.

00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:43,377
You must write me and tell me

490
00:50:43,377 --> 00:50:46,964
that you realize that I love you
beyond the limits of imagination,

491
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:49,967
that only you can please me.

492
00:50:52,553 --> 00:50:54,513
[indistinct shouting]

493
00:52:36,657 --> 00:52:38,325
[soldier chuckles]

494
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:03,851
- [chattering]
- [piano playing]

495
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:07,145
Thank you.

496
00:53:07,145 --> 00:53:08,355
[speaks indistinctly]

497
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:10,482
- [chuckles] Absolutely. I like it.
- That's very ni-- [mumbles]

498
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:13,902
You know they have white,
silky things. Amazing. [chuckles]

499
00:53:59,573 --> 00:54:04,328
Are there limits to
what I can tell you?

500
00:54:06,371 --> 00:54:07,414
There shouldn't be.

501
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:12,461
Should I tell you something at
the risk of giving you personal pain?

502
00:54:14,546 --> 00:54:16,715
Yes. [chuckles]

503
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:27,267
Your wife has taken a lover
named Hippolyte Charles.

504
00:54:38,862 --> 00:54:42,741
[laughing]

505
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:51,208
- You expect me to believe this? [laughs]
- Yes. [chuckles]

506
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:54,545
That my wife would
do this to me? Mmm.

507
00:54:55,671 --> 00:54:56,672
Yes.

508
00:55:07,057 --> 00:55:09,434
No dessert for
you. You may leave.

509
00:55:13,146 --> 00:55:14,398
I would never lie to you.

510
00:55:30,998 --> 00:55:31,999
How do you know this?

511
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:41,842
Lucille is my lover.
She writes to me.

512
00:55:43,385 --> 00:55:45,429
Joséphine's
lady-in-waiting is your lover?

513
00:55:56,815 --> 00:56:00,569
Prepare two frigates and two
smaller vessels in the greatest secrecy.

514
00:56:02,029 --> 00:56:03,363
I'm returning home.

515
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:05,657
- Napoleon...
- Hmm?

516
00:56:05,657 --> 00:56:07,743
...this will be
seen as desertion.

517
00:56:10,454 --> 00:56:14,041
General Kléber will be informed of his
succession to command after I've left.

518
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:27,721
Order arms!

519
00:56:36,688 --> 00:56:39,024
[cheering]

520
00:56:39,024 --> 00:56:41,401
[citizen] Napoleon
the victorious!

521
00:56:50,327 --> 00:56:51,537
[sighs]

522
00:57:06,635 --> 00:57:08,637
[citizens cheering]

523
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:16,436
[carriage driver]
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

524
00:57:31,952 --> 00:57:33,203
Where's my wife?

525
00:57:33,203 --> 00:57:35,038
She has left to
greet you in Lyon.

526
00:57:35,038 --> 00:57:37,708
- [dog yelps]
- Do not lie to me. Where is my wife?

527
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:40,002
She left earlier today, General.

528
00:57:40,002 --> 00:57:41,962
- Lyon?
- Yes, sir.

529
00:57:41,962 --> 00:57:45,174
The entire world knows of
my arrival, but not my wife?

530
00:57:49,428 --> 00:57:51,054
[dog whining]

531
00:58:00,814 --> 00:58:01,815
[clears throat]

532
00:58:09,656 --> 00:58:10,824
Forgive me for earlier.

533
00:58:11,408 --> 00:58:12,409
Yes, sir.

534
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:20,876
Sit with me.

535
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,348
My wife has humiliated me,
and I need comfort, Lucille.

536
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:36,808
Yes, I'm sure that
you do, General.

537
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:41,605
[sighs] What do you suggest
would give me comfort?

538
00:58:42,314 --> 00:58:44,858
I can draw you a
hot bath, General.

539
00:58:48,111 --> 00:58:50,155
I can prepare you
something sweet...

540
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:53,825
and console you.

541
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:58,288
[thunder rumbling]

542
00:59:14,429 --> 00:59:16,932
[groans, gasps]

543
00:59:21,061 --> 00:59:22,938
[whimpers]

544
00:59:26,775 --> 00:59:30,279
[crying, breathing shakily]

545
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:33,365
[bell rings]

546
00:59:34,032 --> 00:59:37,035
- [dogs barking]
- [thunder rumbling]

547
00:59:41,456 --> 00:59:43,375
[Napoleon] What kind
of creature are you?

548
00:59:46,503 --> 00:59:49,047
How could you care so little

549
00:59:49,047 --> 00:59:51,008
- for me and my feelings?
- [groans]

550
00:59:52,384 --> 00:59:54,970
You are a selfish little pig.

551
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:56,054
[mutters]

552
00:59:57,431 --> 00:59:59,433
Do you think so lowly of me?

553
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:02,644
No. I don't.

554
01:00:02,644 --> 01:00:03,729
Then why?

555
01:00:06,481 --> 01:00:09,526
Because you're what? Say it.

556
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:14,781
I'm sorry.

557
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:16,950
That's not enough.

558
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:18,202
[sighs]

559
01:00:18,785 --> 01:00:21,705
- What do you-- What do you want me to say?
- I want you to say

560
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:25,083
that I am the most
important thing in the world!

561
01:00:26,251 --> 01:00:27,419
You are.

562
01:00:27,419 --> 01:00:29,963
- Say it!
- You're-- You're-- You're-- You're--

563
01:00:29,963 --> 01:00:34,718
You're the most important thing
in my life, in the world. You a--

564
01:00:34,718 --> 01:00:38,138
- And without me, you are nothing.
- I'm nothing.

565
01:00:38,138 --> 01:00:39,890
And you will do anything!

566
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:42,309
I'll do anything.

567
01:00:45,854 --> 01:00:47,481
I'm not built like other men.

568
01:00:50,859 --> 01:00:53,195
And I'm not subject
to petty insecurity.

569
01:00:58,867 --> 01:01:00,160
You're a beast.

570
01:01:04,915 --> 01:01:06,291
I feel sorry for you.

571
01:01:10,629 --> 01:01:11,922
You want to be great?

572
01:01:14,925 --> 01:01:15,926
Hmm?

573
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:22,182
You are nothing without me.

574
01:01:23,725 --> 01:01:24,726
Say it.

575
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:34,194
Say it.

576
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:45,789
You are just a brute
that is nothing without me.

577
01:01:47,165 --> 01:01:51,128
I am just a brute that
is nothing without you.

578
01:01:51,128 --> 01:01:52,087
Yes.

579
01:01:52,087 --> 01:01:58,844
You are nothing without
me or your mother.

580
01:01:58,844 --> 01:02:02,431
[Napoleon breathing heavily]

581
01:02:02,431 --> 01:02:03,599
My mother...

582
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:08,979
[sighs]

583
01:02:10,439 --> 01:02:11,648
[Joséphine sighs]

584
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:19,698
Did you have affairs?

585
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:23,410
Of course I did.

586
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:32,211
And did you love them?

587
01:02:33,837 --> 01:02:35,881
No. No, I did not.

588
01:02:42,179 --> 01:02:43,305
Were they pretty?

589
01:02:45,516 --> 01:02:47,351
Yes, some of them.

590
01:02:50,354 --> 01:02:51,855
They served their purpose.

591
01:02:54,107 --> 01:02:55,108
More than I do?

592
01:02:56,068 --> 01:02:59,905
They cried less. That
made them more attractive.

593
01:03:03,325 --> 01:03:04,326
Don't--

594
01:03:05,661 --> 01:03:08,205
Don't leave me.
Please, don't leave me.

595
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,502
[whispering] Just
don't leave me.

596
01:03:15,254 --> 01:03:18,340
You don't have to forgive me. Just
promise me you won't leave again.

597
01:03:24,096 --> 01:03:27,808
What is it that made you
desert your troops in Egypt?

598
01:03:27,808 --> 01:03:28,892
Shh!

599
01:03:31,311 --> 01:03:32,312
Citizens...

600
01:03:34,606 --> 01:03:35,858
what country are we in?

601
01:03:39,653 --> 01:03:42,656
Because she doesn't
resemble the France that I left.

602
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:49,246
Who should be responsible for
her governance while I'm away?

603
01:03:50,873 --> 01:03:53,000
Because it is not
you, Citizen Gohier.

604
01:03:53,834 --> 01:03:54,835
It is not you.

605
01:03:54,835 --> 01:03:58,630
It certainly is not you. Although
you're very good at scowling.

606
01:04:01,466 --> 01:04:03,677
It is not you, Barras.

607
01:04:03,677 --> 01:04:04,803
Or you, Talleyrand.

608
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:07,222
Or you, Sieyès.

609
01:04:08,265 --> 01:04:09,766
So, who?

610
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:13,896
Who should be responsible?
Fouché, do you have any ideas?

611
01:04:15,272 --> 01:04:16,690
- No?
- [sighs]

612
01:04:18,483 --> 01:04:21,278
I have returned to France
to find her bankrupt.

613
01:04:22,696 --> 01:04:25,032
Printing money that
is spent within hours,

614
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:29,244
the Austro-Russian
overrun of Italy,

615
01:04:30,329 --> 01:04:32,581
the Anglo-Russian
occupation of Holland,

616
01:04:33,332 --> 01:04:39,213
and what appears to be the
imminent invasion of France herself.

617
01:04:42,174 --> 01:04:45,677
And yet, you accuse
me of desertion.

618
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:50,474
Added to which the
discovery that my wife is a slut.

619
01:05:03,654 --> 01:05:08,825
The only thing that every French citizen
can agree on is that you are our Caesar.

620
01:05:12,412 --> 01:05:13,413
What do you want?

621
01:05:15,415 --> 01:05:16,834
[chuckles]

622
01:05:17,501 --> 01:05:18,502
Well...

623
01:05:20,963 --> 01:05:24,424
the people would accept
my rule if I have your support.

624
01:05:26,802 --> 01:05:31,431
Like you, though, I believe
that the Directory is corrupt.

625
01:05:33,058 --> 01:05:37,980
But together, we can save this country
from a restoration of the monarchy,

626
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:41,191
and we can preserve the
ideals of the Revolution.

627
01:05:43,902 --> 01:05:47,656
And I think that a seizure
of power is possible

628
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:50,826
with your help,
at the right time.

629
01:05:50,826 --> 01:05:54,121
And I think this
is the right time.

630
01:05:54,872 --> 01:05:57,541
So, you expect me
to be your sword?

631
01:05:59,293 --> 01:06:00,294
[chuckles]

632
01:06:04,173 --> 01:06:09,011
I expect that a coup d'état,
well-timed, well-executed...

633
01:06:11,597 --> 01:06:14,558
could transfer power into
the hands of three consuls:

634
01:06:15,475 --> 01:06:16,768
myself, Ducos...

635
01:06:19,354 --> 01:06:20,397
and you.

636
01:06:21,023 --> 01:06:22,024
[scoffs]

637
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:24,902
I'm inviting you to
the winning side.

638
01:06:25,402 --> 01:06:26,987
[chuckling]

639
01:06:26,987 --> 01:06:28,071
Hmm?

640
01:06:29,198 --> 01:06:31,575
Myself and Ducos
will resign first,

641
01:06:32,284 --> 01:06:35,746
followed by Barras,
Gohier, and Moulin.

642
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:40,876
And this will create an
opening to transfer power.

643
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:45,672
[Lucien] Yeah, I like Barras,
but he is corrupt and isolated.

644
01:06:46,507 --> 01:06:49,426
I think, given the proper threat, he
will quickly make the right decision.

645
01:06:49,426 --> 01:06:53,722
As for the others, uh,
Gohier and Moulin, is it?

646
01:06:53,722 --> 01:06:55,057
I-I don't know.

647
01:06:55,057 --> 01:06:57,476
There are ways to dissuade
them from resistance.

648
01:06:57,476 --> 01:07:01,647
Yes, but this may not become a...
[stammers] ...military or a violent matter.

649
01:07:01,647 --> 01:07:03,732
It will be a police matter.

650
01:07:03,732 --> 01:07:04,691
[Sieyès] Yes.

651
01:07:04,691 --> 01:07:07,069
Lucien... [smacks lips]

652
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:09,988
As Governor of
the Council of 500,

653
01:07:09,988 --> 01:07:14,326
you will persuade both Councils,
at an emergency session,

654
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:18,288
that a Jacobin coup is at hand,

655
01:07:19,206 --> 01:07:23,210
and that the only safe
place is out of Paris,

656
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:26,588
away from the Parisian
mob, at Saint-Cloud,

657
01:07:27,673 --> 01:07:32,553
where we'll then save
them from this threat.

658
01:07:38,016 --> 01:07:39,226
[Lucien] Can I be honest?

659
01:07:39,226 --> 01:07:41,895
There's only one problem
with Sieyès and Ducos's plan.

660
01:07:41,895 --> 01:07:45,440
- And that's Sieyès and Ducos.
- Mmm.

661
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,526
[Lucien] They don't know
you're-- You've got all the power.

662
01:07:47,526 --> 01:07:49,820
You're taking all the risks.
You're doing all the work.

663
01:07:52,072 --> 01:07:54,157
I don't know why you're
bringing them along with you.

664
01:07:56,785 --> 01:07:58,412
Well, I'll need
ladies-in-waiting.

665
01:08:00,122 --> 01:08:02,916
[Lucien] Ladies-in-waiting,
huh? Doing what?

666
01:08:03,417 --> 01:08:05,210
Well, tending to things.

667
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:06,753
- Tending?
- [chuckling] Yes.

668
01:08:06,753 --> 01:08:09,298
You think those
fucking idiots could tend?

669
01:08:09,298 --> 01:08:11,925
They couldn't tend-- I wouldn't
let them tend to my balls.

670
01:08:11,925 --> 01:08:14,678
- [chuckles] Precisely.
- Yeah.

671
01:08:14,678 --> 01:08:15,596
I'll need that.

672
01:08:15,596 --> 01:08:18,640
[Lucien] Tongue bath? I
wouldn't let them wipe my arse.

673
01:08:25,397 --> 01:08:27,733
[both chuckling]

674
01:08:30,736 --> 01:08:33,947
From this moment on,
all friends that you've had,

675
01:08:34,781 --> 01:08:40,162
anyone from the society of the Directory,
cannot be trusted. That life is over.

676
01:08:43,207 --> 01:08:45,584
Well, what's the outcome
of this if you don't succeed?

677
01:08:52,716 --> 01:08:53,926
[chuckles]

678
01:08:54,801 --> 01:08:56,261
By this time tomorrow,

679
01:08:56,803 --> 01:08:59,264
you will be sleeping with
the First Consul of France

680
01:08:59,264 --> 01:09:01,892
and I will stick it to you.

681
01:09:01,892 --> 01:09:04,520
[sniffs, groans]

682
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:07,147
It's a simple letter of
resignation we would like you to--

683
01:09:07,147 --> 01:09:09,358
I am not signing anything.

684
01:09:09,358 --> 01:09:12,736
You can piss before
I sign anything away!

685
01:09:12,736 --> 01:09:13,819
Gentlemen.

686
01:09:15,781 --> 01:09:17,198
[panting]

687
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:19,076
[grunting]

688
01:09:21,453 --> 01:09:24,206
[shouts] Who's doing this?

689
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:26,707
Good morning, Paul.

690
01:09:28,042 --> 01:09:29,044
Hmm.

691
01:09:29,877 --> 01:09:32,005
I'm going to make
this very simple for you.

692
01:09:33,006 --> 01:09:36,385
I have documents announcing
your resignation from the Council.

693
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:40,055
You must retire before you
have your breakfast, please.

694
01:09:41,305 --> 01:09:45,644
Tell them I return with joy
to the ranks of simple citizen.

695
01:09:47,604 --> 01:09:48,604
I shall.

696
01:09:52,526 --> 01:09:53,777
[knocking]

697
01:09:53,777 --> 01:09:55,863
There are some
gentlemen here to see you.

698
01:09:56,697 --> 01:10:00,617
Citizen Moulin, we have a letter
of resignation for you to sign.

699
01:10:01,493 --> 01:10:04,246
- No, no, no. I am eating my breakfast.
- [spouse] No.

700
01:10:04,246 --> 01:10:06,999
I am enjoying a
succulent breakfast.

701
01:10:06,999 --> 01:10:11,420
This is outrageous! I shall finish
my breakfast before you touch me!

702
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:14,339
- [cries] No!
- Enjoy your breakfast.

703
01:10:15,007 --> 01:10:17,426
[wailing]

704
01:10:35,944 --> 01:10:37,237
[Council member 1] Director!

705
01:10:38,071 --> 01:10:40,449
I believe the time has come
to demand an explanation.

706
01:10:40,449 --> 01:10:42,159
- [Council member 2] Hear, hear!
- [clamoring]

707
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:47,372
Uh, thi-this emergency session
is to draw a list of nominations

708
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:51,960
for a-- a new Directory
to deal with the threat--

709
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:54,630
- [members clamoring]
- the threat of the royalists.

710
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:56,840
We are being asked
to pass a resolution

711
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,760
forming a provisional
government to three councils:

712
01:11:00,886 --> 01:11:04,389
General Bonaparte and
Citizen Sieyès and Roger Ducos.

713
01:11:05,974 --> 01:11:08,101
Where are the five
members of the Directory?

714
01:11:08,101 --> 01:11:10,229
[members clamoring]

715
01:11:10,229 --> 01:11:12,231
[Council member 1] Have
they magically disappeared?

716
01:11:12,231 --> 01:11:15,442
- [Council member 3 chuckles]
- And we are here, surrounded by troops,

717
01:11:15,442 --> 01:11:17,361
isolated far from Paris.

718
01:11:17,361 --> 01:11:19,029
- [clamoring]
- Order! Order!

719
01:11:19,029 --> 01:11:21,949
[Council member 1] This is
becoming increasingly clear:

720
01:11:22,866 --> 01:11:25,744
that your brother,
Napoleon Bonaparte,

721
01:11:26,954 --> 01:11:30,832
with his show of military
might, is acting as an outlaw.

722
01:11:30,832 --> 01:11:34,086
- [members clamoring]
- [Lucien] A vote will solve this matter.

723
01:11:34,086 --> 01:11:37,923
[Council member 1] And that this is a
ridiculous and poorly executed takeover.

724
01:11:37,923 --> 01:11:39,633
A power-hungry upstart.

725
01:11:39,633 --> 01:11:42,678
- [members shouting]
- [Napoleon] Enough! Enough!

726
01:11:42,678 --> 01:11:46,682
If there is any question of what
is happening here, I will answer!

727
01:11:46,682 --> 01:11:48,058
How dare you!

728
01:11:48,058 --> 01:11:51,979
This is-- You have
violated the constitution!

729
01:11:51,979 --> 01:11:54,106
- You have--
- [Council member 4] Hold him!

730
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:57,484
- [Council member 5] Get him!
- [struggling]

731
01:11:57,484 --> 01:11:59,278
[all clamoring]

732
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:05,659
- Arrest him!
- Stop him!

733
01:12:05,659 --> 01:12:07,286
[panting]

734
01:12:07,286 --> 01:12:08,662
Oh, fuck!

735
01:12:08,662 --> 01:12:10,747
[Council members shouting]

736
01:12:11,748 --> 01:12:12,749
[yelps]

737
01:12:14,168 --> 01:12:15,544
[Council member 6] Kill him!

738
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:18,630
[grunts, panting]

739
01:12:19,631 --> 01:12:22,676
[guards straining]

740
01:12:22,676 --> 01:12:24,469
- [mutters]
- Let me through!

741
01:12:27,514 --> 01:12:28,765
Right. [pants]

742
01:12:28,765 --> 01:12:32,936
We are being terrorized by
deputies armed with daggers!

743
01:12:33,478 --> 01:12:36,940
And these madmen
have outlawed themselves

744
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:39,651
by their attempt on the
liberty of this country!

745
01:12:39,651 --> 01:12:42,237
- They're trying to kill me!
- They're trying to kill him.

746
01:12:42,738 --> 01:12:44,823
- [Council member 7] Open these doors!
- [grunts]

747
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:48,160
[Lucien grunts]

748
01:12:49,036 --> 01:12:50,704
[Council member
3] Let us out of here!

749
01:12:50,704 --> 01:12:55,626
I will kill my brother if he betrays
the freedom of the French people!

750
01:12:57,085 --> 01:12:58,587
Get in there now!

751
01:12:58,587 --> 01:13:01,089
- [Lucien] Fuck.
- [guards shouting]

752
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,887
[guard 1] Move,
move. Get back. Back.

753
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:09,556
[guard 2] Move it. Move it!

754
01:13:11,433 --> 01:13:14,561
- [guard 3] Back. Move back.
- [guard 4] Move back. Out of the way.

755
01:13:15,229 --> 01:13:17,314
[guard 5] Move, move. Backwards.

756
01:13:22,027 --> 01:13:23,695
[Council members gasping]

757
01:13:23,695 --> 01:13:25,113
Good luck, brother.

758
01:13:29,451 --> 01:13:31,453
[Napoleon panting]

759
01:13:35,832 --> 01:13:36,834
Stand aside.

760
01:13:49,763 --> 01:13:51,014
Shall we vote?

761
01:13:54,518 --> 01:13:55,519
Where are we going?

762
01:13:55,519 --> 01:13:58,230
[people cheering]

763
01:13:58,230 --> 01:14:00,232
All our harsh
words are behind us.

764
01:14:03,068 --> 01:14:05,612
I need you to be my
most tender friend.

765
01:14:09,449 --> 01:14:12,619
Over this door is our destiny.

766
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:19,168
[cheering continues]

767
01:15:29,363 --> 01:15:31,365
[French officer] Present arms!

768
01:15:43,919 --> 01:15:46,004
- [aristocrat] First Consul.
- My lord.

769
01:15:47,005 --> 01:15:48,006
Milady.

770
01:15:49,258 --> 01:15:50,425
[inhales sharply]

771
01:15:50,926 --> 01:15:51,844
First Consul.

772
01:15:51,844 --> 01:15:53,804
- Citizen Bonaparte.
- Citizen Bonaparte.

773
01:15:53,804 --> 01:15:55,430
- First Consul.
- Citizen Bonaparte.

774
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:56,723
First Consul.

775
01:16:00,269 --> 01:16:01,562
Come, little one.

776
01:16:02,271 --> 01:16:05,190
You get into the
bed of your master's.

777
01:16:06,108 --> 01:16:07,943
[chuckling]

778
01:16:10,362 --> 01:16:13,073
The decision of dress is
not just a matter of taste.

779
01:16:13,991 --> 01:16:16,910
It is policy that guards against
the return of a fatal regime.

780
01:16:17,494 --> 01:16:19,454
And so our uniforms
must be rich.

781
01:16:20,581 --> 01:16:23,041
For staff, each a red coat.

782
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:27,087
For winter made in velvet, and
summer some other material.

783
01:16:27,671 --> 01:16:29,298
Both embroidered in gold.

784
01:16:30,132 --> 01:16:32,134
[aristocrats chattering]

785
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:51,236
Hello, madame!

786
01:16:51,236 --> 01:16:52,905
Hello, good evening.

787
01:16:58,452 --> 01:17:00,078
Mother, the Duke of Avignon.

788
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:01,330
It's good to meet you.

789
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:13,842
Ah. Could this be Joséphine?

790
01:17:15,052 --> 01:17:17,679
- Mother, Joséphine. Joséphine, Mother.
- [Letizia] Good to see you.

791
01:17:18,222 --> 01:17:20,474
Oh, it's Charles.

792
01:17:21,433 --> 01:17:22,434
This way.

793
01:17:43,038 --> 01:17:44,998
- Good evening. How are you?
- [chuckles] I'm very well.

794
01:17:46,792 --> 01:17:47,793
[Napoleon] Mother.

795
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:50,921
Hello... [speaks indistinctly]
It's a pleasure to--

796
01:17:50,921 --> 01:17:52,005
Her voice.

797
01:17:52,005 --> 01:17:55,676
- I hope you're having a wonderful night.
- Thank you very much. [chuckles]

798
01:17:55,676 --> 01:17:59,137
- Hello, sir. Hello, mademoiselle...
- Hello.

799
01:17:59,137 --> 01:18:00,889
So happy to see you.

800
01:18:06,395 --> 01:18:09,982
[scribe] "Your Majesty, England and
France are wasting their prosperity."

801
01:18:09,982 --> 01:18:10,983
Let me try again.

802
01:18:13,485 --> 01:18:16,113
- Your Royal Majesty, England and France...
- [clears throat]

803
01:18:16,113 --> 01:18:18,991
- ...are wasting their prosperity...
- Your-- Your Majesty.

804
01:18:19,616 --> 01:18:20,784
What did I say?

805
01:18:22,369 --> 01:18:25,080
[stammers] "Your--
Your-- Your Royal Majesty."

806
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:28,458
"Your Royal Ma"--
[inhales deeply]

807
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:32,337
Your Majesty, England and
France are wasting their prosperity.

808
01:18:34,715 --> 01:18:37,134
I am not ashamed
to take the initiative.

809
01:18:37,134 --> 01:18:39,970
I have, I think, sufficiently
proven to the whole world

810
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:42,890
that I do not fear
the chances of war.

811
01:18:44,224 --> 01:18:48,520
But peace is my heartfelt
wish for England and France.

812
01:18:49,938 --> 01:18:50,939
Read it back to me.

813
01:18:51,857 --> 01:18:55,360
I have notified all foreign powers
of your accession to the Consul,

814
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:58,947
I have addressed letters to
all diplomatic agents abroad,

815
01:18:58,947 --> 01:19:02,951
{\an8}and I understand that you have made
friendly overtures of peace to England.

816
01:19:02,951 --> 01:19:04,328
{\an8}Ca-Caulaincourt.

817
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:08,165
What I need from you
is a better understanding

818
01:19:08,165 --> 01:19:10,042
of the Russian Tsar Alexander.

819
01:19:10,751 --> 01:19:13,587
Would you consider the tsar
an ally to England or France?

820
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:19,384
Well, I would think that his trade
with England is more beneficial to him

821
01:19:19,384 --> 01:19:20,886
than his trade with France.

822
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:25,599
And do you have a sense of British
influence in the Russian courts?

823
01:19:25,599 --> 01:19:28,185
[Caulaincourt] I do not, but
I imagine it is quite robust.

824
01:19:29,478 --> 01:19:30,562
Robust?

825
01:19:35,651 --> 01:19:38,487
What kind of man
is he? Describe him.

826
01:19:40,072 --> 01:19:41,907
Well, he's young. [sighs]

827
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:45,202
- He's vain.
- [scoffs]

828
01:19:46,286 --> 01:19:48,288
He's popular, and he
wishes to remain so.

829
01:19:48,288 --> 01:19:49,456
He's popular?

830
01:19:52,251 --> 01:19:53,252
Really?

831
01:19:53,252 --> 01:19:56,463
His greatest fear is to be
killed in his bed, like his father.

832
01:19:56,463 --> 01:19:58,298
[laughs]

833
01:19:59,299 --> 01:20:03,595
This makes him dangerously fickle
to whoever last has his attention.

834
01:20:04,721 --> 01:20:07,808
So he needs an ally that
he can also call a friend.

835
01:20:14,773 --> 01:20:15,983
No more bets.

836
01:20:19,653 --> 01:20:21,029
What a surprise.

837
01:20:21,697 --> 01:20:23,073
How nice to see you out.

838
01:20:24,157 --> 01:20:25,409
Excuse me, gentlemen.

839
01:20:25,909 --> 01:20:28,412
Good evening. I'm just
trying to lose some money.

840
01:20:28,412 --> 01:20:32,082
Ah. Well, after this hand, why
don't you come and join me?

841
01:20:32,082 --> 01:20:33,876
I'm at my usual table.

842
01:20:33,876 --> 01:20:35,127
That's a lovely idea.

843
01:20:37,171 --> 01:20:38,172
Good evening.

844
01:20:39,298 --> 01:20:41,592
Mmm. Did you hear?

845
01:20:43,594 --> 01:20:48,515
Your Majesty received a letter of
peace from the First Consul today.

846
01:20:50,392 --> 01:20:53,979
Monsieur Talleyrand,
if I may be honest?

847
01:20:53,979 --> 01:20:55,063
Of course.

848
01:20:55,063 --> 01:20:59,902
Austria's coalition with England is in
such a strong position against France,

849
01:20:59,902 --> 01:21:03,864
that these peace
overtures are clearly

850
01:21:03,864 --> 01:21:06,325
only for your handling
of French public opinion.

851
01:21:06,325 --> 01:21:09,328
[chuckles] Oh, my friend.

852
01:21:11,371 --> 01:21:13,457
- You know me so well.
- [diplomat chuckles]

853
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:17,669
Yes, it is true. It is public
opinion Napoleon is after.

854
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:20,714
But my warning to you
is that he's as hungry for it

855
01:21:20,714 --> 01:21:22,883
as any man in the
history of the world.

856
01:21:22,883 --> 01:21:24,760
So my suggestion, with respect,

857
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:28,597
would be to take this little
offering of peace from him...

858
01:21:31,642 --> 01:21:37,356
or suffer the consequences from
a man bent on peace at any cost.

859
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:42,611
The English ambassador, Lord
Whitworth, has arrived, Consul.

860
01:21:51,495 --> 01:21:54,706
Do not look at me as if you
don't know what I'm about to say.

861
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:59,127
Are you aware of my
letter of peace to your king?

862
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:00,963
I am not.

863
01:22:02,422 --> 01:22:03,715
Shall I repeat it?

864
01:22:03,715 --> 01:22:07,469
[inhales deeply] No,
you may not. [sighs]

865
01:22:07,469 --> 01:22:09,930
Take this as a
warning to your king.

866
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:12,683
I will keep you
guessing and scared.

867
01:22:12,683 --> 01:22:14,893
You will watch your
borders and your back,

868
01:22:14,893 --> 01:22:17,896
and your manners are bound,
sooner or later, to be French.

869
01:22:17,896 --> 01:22:20,357
I will offer no more
letters of peace,

870
01:22:20,357 --> 01:22:24,862
and I will take the lack of a
swift reply as an act of disrespect!

871
01:22:24,862 --> 01:22:28,073
You think you're so great
because you have boats!

872
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:34,746
'Tis a shame such a great
man should have no manners.

873
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:39,751
Stronger blue around Minorca.

874
01:22:45,674 --> 01:22:47,134
Uh, t-take care. No, no, no, no.

875
01:22:47,134 --> 01:22:49,386
First Consul, don't walk
there. The paint's still wet.

876
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:54,933
If-- If you want to walk,
w-w-walk on Italy. Italy is dry.

877
01:23:00,564 --> 01:23:04,526
[Davout] The Austrians have consolidated
their forces here, First Consul.

878
01:23:05,527 --> 01:23:08,197
To secure control of the
peninsula's northern half.

879
01:23:09,489 --> 01:23:13,368
South of Alessandria.
In Marengo.

880
01:23:14,203 --> 01:23:16,246
Their cavalry
reinforced, morale high.

881
01:23:16,246 --> 01:23:19,291
The-- Their military is very,
very well provisioned for battle.

882
01:23:44,191 --> 01:23:47,277
We will be light.
We will be swift.

883
01:23:47,277 --> 01:23:50,072
We will cross the
great crest of the Alps.

884
01:23:50,864 --> 01:23:53,825
And we will restore what
France lost while I was away.

885
01:24:05,838 --> 01:24:08,006
{\an8}[soldiers shouting]

886
01:24:43,917 --> 01:24:44,918
Yes?

887
01:24:47,504 --> 01:24:48,505
Are you pleased?

888
01:24:51,175 --> 01:24:53,677
Are you about to tell me
something that will make me angry?

889
01:24:54,636 --> 01:24:56,013
Let's hope not.

890
01:24:56,013 --> 01:25:00,726
The European families think nothing
more of you than a Corsican thug.

891
01:25:01,476 --> 01:25:03,187
- Therefore...
- [chuckles]

892
01:25:03,187 --> 01:25:06,940
...I'm going to suggest something
that's been a long time arriving.

893
01:25:07,983 --> 01:25:12,654
I suggest that you abandon
your role as First Consul of France

894
01:25:13,614 --> 01:25:18,035
in exchange for the
title "Victorious Consul."

895
01:25:20,078 --> 01:25:22,497
By another name, "king."

896
01:25:22,497 --> 01:25:25,375
[chuckles]

897
01:25:25,375 --> 01:25:26,460
What?

898
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:28,921
[scoffs] "King."

899
01:25:30,797 --> 01:25:32,341
Uh, yes, king.

900
01:25:35,219 --> 01:25:36,220
King?

901
01:25:47,105 --> 01:25:49,983
- [chuckles]
- Mmm.

- The way you like it.

905
01:26:03,455 --> 01:26:05,958
- [whines]
- [scoffs] Oh, you filthy man.

906
01:26:05,958 --> 01:26:07,584
My hair has been set now.

907
01:26:08,168 --> 01:26:10,629
[murmuring continues]

908
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:14,132
I have the most beautiful wife.

- I-- All right, come on then.

01:26:19,179 --> 01:26:20,180
Hat off.

911
01:26:22,558 --> 01:26:23,559
Mmm.

[grunts]

913
01:26:27,396 --> 01:26:29,189
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

914
01:26:30,274 --> 01:26:32,109
- You feel that?
- [sighs] What?

915
01:26:33,735 --> 01:26:34,862
Can you feel that?

916
01:26:34,862 --> 01:26:37,322
- That's yours. That's yours.
- [breathing heavily]

917
01:26:37,322 --> 01:26:38,532
It's yours.

918
01:26:38,532 --> 01:26:39,616
Thank you.

[panting]

923
01:28:06,036 --> 01:28:09,289
This conspiracy of
royals against me is clear.

924
01:28:10,332 --> 01:28:14,169
All exiled Bourbons whose
single aim is to overthrow my rule

925
01:28:14,169 --> 01:28:16,922
and reinstate their
filthy perfume-Monarchy.

926
01:28:17,589 --> 01:28:19,633
The Prince de Conde
is smuggling out plotters,

927
01:28:19,633 --> 01:28:21,718
and his grandson, Louis,
the Duke d'Enghien,

928
01:28:21,718 --> 01:28:23,929
is on the frontier
solely for that purpose.

929
01:28:23,929 --> 01:28:27,683
I want this man seized, and I
want him brought swiftly to justice.

930
01:28:29,601 --> 01:28:30,602
Where is he?

931
01:28:31,186 --> 01:28:32,187
He's in Baden.

932
01:28:32,187 --> 01:28:35,524
First Consul, I know this man.
He is not a conspirator against you.

933
01:28:35,524 --> 01:28:37,484
He is a brave and
excellent officer,

934
01:28:37,484 --> 01:28:39,653
- much loved by the soldiery.
- He's a filthy Bourbon weasel

935
01:28:39,653 --> 01:28:43,574
who-- who-- who will be punished
for his part in this plot against me.

936
01:28:44,283 --> 01:28:46,201
- [breathing heavily]
- If you proceed to Baden,

937
01:28:46,201 --> 01:28:49,288
you will be operating outside of
France and so far outside the law

938
01:28:49,288 --> 01:28:51,957
that it will be impossible
for anyone to ignore.

939
01:28:56,211 --> 01:28:57,212
I see.

940
01:28:59,131 --> 01:29:01,633
[inhales sharpy] Well, I've
always profited from your judgment.

941
01:29:02,217 --> 01:29:05,345
And now it's time to profit from
watching you close your mouth.

942
01:29:05,345 --> 01:29:06,722
Seize the Duke.

943
01:29:13,812 --> 01:29:15,939
[sighs deeply]

944
01:29:18,275 --> 01:29:22,321
You're letting your hatred make
your decision. [breathes shakily]

945
01:29:22,988 --> 01:29:26,867
In a year's time, you will regard this
execution as an act of great policy,

946
01:29:26,867 --> 01:29:29,244
and you will kiss my
mouth with those words.

947
01:29:30,537 --> 01:29:31,538
Go to bed.

948
01:29:32,164 --> 01:29:34,750

01:29:45,469 --> 01:29:47,804
[footsteps approaching]

950
01:29:54,436 --> 01:29:55,646
You are Frenchmen.

951
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,107
At least you will do me the
service not to miss your aim.

952
01:30:00,984 --> 01:30:02,778
May I command the execution?

953
01:30:03,654 --> 01:30:05,989
You are charged with
bearing arms against France.

954
01:30:06,823 --> 01:30:09,535
Proceed to ready. Aim.

955
01:30:17,459 --> 01:30:18,836
You may command the execution.

956
01:30:23,257 --> 01:30:24,550
Aim for the heart.

957
01:30:25,759 --> 01:30:26,969
Fire.

Oh. [chuckles] Stop.

Why aren't you pregnant?

963
01:30:53,704 --> 01:30:56,999
Is that a question, or
is that an accusation?

964
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,418
- [Napoleon] Mmm.
- [sighs]

965
01:31:01,211 --> 01:31:02,421
It was a question.

966
01:31:03,213 --> 01:31:04,715
[grunts, chuckles]

967
01:31:04,715 --> 01:31:06,008
Now it's an accusation.

968
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:12,723
Well, I've seen Dr. Corvisart,
and he has no answer.

969
01:31:17,102 --> 01:31:19,771
Only that I do what Madame
de Rémusat has done.

970
01:31:22,149 --> 01:31:23,150
[Napoleon] Which is?

971
01:31:23,150 --> 01:31:25,694
[sighs] Which is...

972
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:30,991
along with hopeful thinking
and a bit of red wine,

973
01:31:30,991 --> 01:31:33,911
he suggested I take the
waters at Aix-la-Chapelle.

974
01:31:37,372 --> 01:31:38,582
And why haven't you?

975
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:42,836
As wife of the First Consul,
I haven't found the time.

976
01:31:42,836 --> 01:31:45,839
I spend many hours
cleaning up after you.

977
01:31:50,385 --> 01:31:51,845
Find the time.

978
01:31:53,514 --> 01:31:57,017
[inhales sharply] I don't need to explain
to you the importance of this, do I?

979
01:31:57,976 --> 01:31:59,269
What, you want an heir?

980
01:32:00,062 --> 01:32:01,813
I want one now.

981
01:32:01,813 --> 01:32:03,607
[smacking lips]

982
01:32:03,607 --> 01:32:07,861

- [Napoleon growling]

983
01:32:14,993 --> 01:32:17,204
- [growling continues]
- [laughing]

984
01:32:19,498 --> 01:32:22,543
Oh, my God. [gasps, chuckles]

985
01:32:24,711 --> 01:32:26,129
- [growls]
- [chuckles]

986
01:32:26,129 --> 01:32:28,215
[choir singing in Latin]

987
01:33:04,126 --> 01:33:05,961
[song ends]

988
01:33:09,631 --> 01:33:12,342
May God affirm
you on his throne,

989
01:33:13,677 --> 01:33:18,640
and Christ give you to rule
with him in his eternal kingdom.

990
01:33:38,202 --> 01:33:40,037
[attendees gasping]

991
01:33:44,708 --> 01:33:48,003
I found the crown of
France in the gutter.

992
01:33:50,005 --> 01:33:54,343
I picked it up with the tip of
my sword and cleaned it...

993
01:33:56,428 --> 01:33:58,555
and place it atop my own head.

994
01:34:00,349 --> 01:34:02,351
[attendees murmuring]

995
01:34:25,165 --> 01:34:30,462
The most glorious, the
most august Napoleon,

996
01:34:30,462 --> 01:34:33,090
emperor of the French,

997
01:34:33,090 --> 01:34:36,510
is crowned and enthroned!

998
01:34:37,344 --> 01:34:39,054
Long live the emperor!

999
01:34:39,054 --> 01:34:41,640
[all] Long live the emperor!

1000
01:34:42,224 --> 01:34:44,142
Long live the emperor!

1001
01:34:45,143 --> 01:34:47,771
[choir singing in Latin]

[drumroll]

1003
01:35:20,596 --> 01:35:21,763
[soldier] Fire!

1004
01:35:23,682 --> 01:35:26,310
[shouts] Fire!

1005
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:27,811
[cannon fire]

1006
01:35:27,811 --> 01:35:29,146
Captain Charles.

1007
01:35:41,283 --> 01:35:42,743
Captain Charles.

1008
01:35:48,874 --> 01:35:50,250
Captain Charles...

1009
01:35:54,505 --> 01:35:57,424
I must confess something
to you in the greatest secrecy.

1010
01:35:58,967 --> 01:36:00,385
It is indiscreet.

1011
01:36:00,928 --> 01:36:02,513
And I hope you will not blush.

1012
01:36:05,641 --> 01:36:06,934
Do you have children?

1013
01:36:07,851 --> 01:36:10,062
Yes, Majesty. I have three sons.

1014
01:36:12,105 --> 01:36:14,483
If you please, may I ask
you something personal?

1015
01:36:15,734 --> 01:36:17,277
Of course, Majesty.

1016
01:36:20,572 --> 01:36:25,619
Tell me, when you made your wife
pregnant, did you spend much time?

1017
01:36:28,038 --> 01:36:31,041
Um, I don't remember, Majesty.

1018
01:36:31,625 --> 01:36:33,418
Mmm. If you were to guess.

1019
01:36:36,046 --> 01:36:38,799
We sometimes take 30 minutes.

1020
01:36:40,133 --> 01:36:43,303
And do you think this is what
your secret is, then, to having a son?

1021
01:36:45,097 --> 01:36:47,182
I cannot say for
certain, Majesty.

1022
01:36:50,477 --> 01:36:51,478
I love my wife.

1023
01:36:51,478 --> 01:36:52,604
So do I.

1024
01:36:53,814 --> 01:36:55,357
And I wanna see her happy.

1025
01:36:56,483 --> 01:36:57,860
So tell me...

1026
01:37:00,153 --> 01:37:01,864
do you think it important

1027
01:37:01,864 --> 01:37:05,534
for a man to pleasure his lady
in anticipation of entering her?

1028
01:37:11,498 --> 01:37:15,419
Um, I don't know what
you mean, Majesty.

1029
01:37:15,961 --> 01:37:17,546
Don't be shy, Captain.

1030
01:37:18,046 --> 01:37:19,047
Tell me.

1031
01:37:20,299 --> 01:37:22,050
If I want to have a son,

1032
01:37:23,135 --> 01:37:27,097
do you think I should spend time with
my mouth down between my wife's legs?

1033
01:37:28,932 --> 01:37:29,933
[swallows]

1034
01:37:31,351 --> 01:37:34,313
Um, I would assume,
Your Highness,

1035
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:36,732
that the more pleasure
your wife gets...

1036
01:37:36,732 --> 01:37:39,526
[inhales shakily] ...the
more likely she is to conceive.

1037
01:37:44,239 --> 01:37:47,034
Captain Charles, I should like
to thank you for your honesty

1038
01:37:47,034 --> 01:37:50,454
in talking about such
uncomfortable matters.

1039
01:37:53,123 --> 01:37:54,958
I sought out your advice.

1040
01:37:56,251 --> 01:37:59,171
You're a man of notable
cocksmanship and stature.

1041
01:37:59,671 --> 01:38:03,008
And you have a pretty face
and a hairdresser's elegance.

1042
01:38:05,427 --> 01:38:06,428
Thank you.

1043
01:38:08,805 --> 01:38:09,932
You're dismissed.

1044
01:38:09,932 --> 01:38:11,016
[sighs shakily]

1045
01:38:28,909 --> 01:38:30,702
[Napoleon] I do not
support this idea.

1046
01:38:30,702 --> 01:38:33,455
You suggest divorce
after years of debate.

1047
01:38:33,455 --> 01:38:35,332
You can see that
it has me divided.

1048
01:38:35,332 --> 01:38:36,416
[Talleyrand] Mmm.

1049
01:38:38,043 --> 01:38:39,461
[sighs]

1050
01:38:39,461 --> 01:38:41,296
I am not ambitious.

1051
01:38:41,296 --> 01:38:43,215
I've never declared
war with anyone.

1052
01:38:46,969 --> 01:38:47,970
No.

1053
01:38:50,222 --> 01:38:54,560
You are the greatest leader
in the history of the world

1054
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,603
and the world's only
chance at peace.

1055
01:38:56,603 --> 01:38:58,230
[sighs]

1056
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:05,571
The security of the empire and peace
in the world depends upon an heir.

1057
01:39:06,071 --> 01:39:07,072
[sighs]

1058
01:39:09,491 --> 01:39:11,493
[dinner guests chattering]

1059
01:39:13,245 --> 01:39:16,415
[Joséphine] It was
an option. [chuckles]

1060
01:39:16,415 --> 01:39:18,000
And I said it at the time.

1061
01:39:25,257 --> 01:39:26,884
[Napoleon] Are you
enjoying yourself?

1062
01:39:28,844 --> 01:39:31,638
I'm going to war to
defend our people,

1063
01:39:32,389 --> 01:39:34,850
and my wife cannot
provide me an heir.

1064
01:39:38,562 --> 01:39:41,231
If you do not bear
me a child tonight,

1065
01:39:43,025 --> 01:39:44,568
there will be a divorce.

1066
01:39:46,945 --> 01:39:50,324
Hasn't been enough lovemaking
in this home to bear a child.

1067
01:39:51,408 --> 01:39:52,743
Yes, there has.

1068
01:39:53,952 --> 01:39:57,581
- [Joséphine sighs]
- There have been years of it. Years.

1069
01:39:59,333 --> 01:40:00,751
And with more than just me.

1070
01:40:01,543 --> 01:40:05,631
- [inhales deeply] Oh.
- And still you are empty.

1071
01:40:05,631 --> 01:40:07,216
And you're fat.

1072
01:40:09,009 --> 01:40:12,262
I enjoy my meals. I do.

1073
01:40:13,180 --> 01:40:14,932
Destiny has brought me here.

1074
01:40:14,932 --> 01:40:17,476
Destiny has brought
me this lamb chop.

1075
01:40:19,561 --> 01:40:20,562
[yelps]

1076
01:40:42,918 --> 01:40:43,919
Joséphine.

1077
01:40:46,672 --> 01:40:47,673
[sniffles]

1078
01:40:48,465 --> 01:40:49,800
- Come then.
- [sniffles]

1079
01:40:50,968 --> 01:40:51,969
Come.

1080
01:40:55,430 --> 01:40:57,349
[sighs]

1081
01:40:58,684 --> 01:41:02,563
I love your talents
and your taste.

1082
01:41:04,815 --> 01:41:07,484
And while I'm away,
I will miss your grace.

1083
01:41:07,985 --> 01:41:09,528
- [sighs]
- And your dignity.

1084
01:41:10,821 --> 01:41:12,614
And I will come back to you.

1085
01:41:14,783 --> 01:41:15,784
[sighs]

1086
01:41:26,461 --> 01:41:27,462
[horse whinnying]

1087
01:41:27,462 --> 01:41:29,548
[Austrian soldiers chattering]

01:41:33,177 --> 01:41:35,429
[Austrian soldier shouts]

1089
01:41:41,894 --> 01:41:44,021
[Austrian soldier shouts]

1090
01:41:46,648 --> 01:41:48,817
To today's victory. Hmm?

1091
01:41:49,443 --> 01:41:51,528
Look, I'm always
here for you, Francis.

1092
01:41:52,487 --> 01:41:55,741
But I must admit, I'm overwhelmed
with the excitement of the battlefield.

1093
01:41:56,283 --> 01:41:58,619
{\an8}I should not deceive
you, Alexander.

1094
01:41:58,619 --> 01:42:01,788
{\an8}This battle against him
will be brutal and terrifying.

1095
01:42:04,875 --> 01:42:06,502
[sighs]

1096
01:42:18,889 --> 01:42:20,891
[French soldiers shouting]

1097
01:42:22,893 --> 01:42:25,020
[grunting]

1098
01:42:26,396 --> 01:42:28,440
- [soldiers grunting]
- [officer] Come on!

1099
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:30,400
Get in defensive position!

1100
01:42:40,869 --> 01:42:42,663
[Napoleon] My
good wife, Joséphine.

1101
01:42:43,455 --> 01:42:47,167
My God, it's cold here.
I miss your warmth.

1102
01:42:48,585 --> 01:42:52,214
On this day, we celebrate the
first anniversary of our coronation.

1103
01:42:54,049 --> 01:42:56,718
My previous ally has
now joined with my enemy.

1104
01:42:57,845 --> 01:43:01,682
The Russian Tsar Alexander joined
forces with the prince of Austria.

1105
01:43:02,766 --> 01:43:05,394
I have heard that he's
been studying the art of war

1106
01:43:05,394 --> 01:43:07,229
and trying to emulate
my battle tactics.

1107
01:43:07,229 --> 01:43:08,230
More fires.

1108
01:43:08,230 --> 01:43:09,731
He tries to copy me,

1109
01:43:10,399 --> 01:43:13,151
but he is a little boy who
will make a terrible mistake.

1110
01:43:14,319 --> 01:43:18,282
I am certain I will bring the laurels of
another glorious victory to my army today.

1111
01:43:19,324 --> 01:43:21,493
Yours, Napoleon.

1112
01:43:21,493 --> 01:43:24,705
- [shouts]
- [French soldiers cheering]

1113
01:43:36,967 --> 01:43:39,803
Hey, tie it from the back.
Peg that corner to the ground.

1114
01:43:39,803 --> 01:43:40,888
That's it.

1115
01:43:53,692 --> 01:43:56,904
[grunts, sighing]

1116
01:44:00,324 --> 01:44:01,325
[grunts]

1117
01:44:19,134 --> 01:44:20,677
[sighs]

1118
01:44:21,261 --> 01:44:24,348
Harder. Like a horse.

1119
01:44:31,146 --> 01:44:32,147
More.

1120
01:44:33,398 --> 01:44:34,483
[grunts]

1121
01:44:34,483 --> 01:44:35,776
[flute playing]

01:44:47,788 --> 01:44:50,749
[French soldier shivering]

1123
01:44:51,333 --> 01:44:53,210

- Mmm?

1128
01:45:51,059 --> 01:45:52,561
We are discovered.

1129
01:45:54,146 --> 01:45:55,147
Good.

1130
01:45:56,565 --> 01:45:57,733
Tell the men to rest.

Renounce, sir. We're pinned in.

1183
01:52:33,962 --> 01:52:36,465
Off the ice! Withdraw!

1184
01:52:43,347 --> 01:52:44,556
Cut off their retreat.

1185
01:52:47,976 --> 01:52:49,853
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

1186

Hyah, hyah, hyah!

[gasps]

1189
01:53:35,816 --> 01:53:38,610
Francis. So nice
to finally meet you.

1190
01:53:39,194 --> 01:53:40,779
Please come in where it's warm.

1191
01:53:41,613 --> 01:53:44,032
- Thank you.
- You must forgive me.

1192
01:53:44,032 --> 01:53:46,618
This has been my only
palace for the last two months.

1193
01:53:47,828 --> 01:53:51,832
Seems very agreeable.
You make excellent use of it.

1194
01:53:51,832 --> 01:53:53,876
Well, we do what we
can on the battlefield.

1195
01:53:54,668 --> 01:53:56,962
- Yes, we do, don't we?
- Mm-hmm.

1196
01:53:56,962 --> 01:53:59,214
It's nice to finally
meet another emperor.

1197
01:54:00,507 --> 01:54:02,759
Uh, where, may I
ask, is Alexander?

1198
01:54:02,759 --> 01:54:05,220
Are we waiting for his
arrival before we get started?

1199
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:09,016
I do not believe
he will be joining us.

1200
01:54:09,016 --> 01:54:11,602
- He's beside himself with rage.
- [sighs]

1201
01:54:14,062 --> 01:54:18,275
I realize I must compliment you for
making me commit an enormous error.

1202
01:54:19,359 --> 01:54:21,111
- An error?
- [Napoleon] Yes.

1203
01:54:22,237 --> 01:54:23,655
What error have you made?

1204
01:54:25,657 --> 01:54:28,785
To be speaking with you here and
accepting this invitation for peace,

1205
01:54:29,661 --> 01:54:31,371
I have not followed
up my victory.

1206
01:54:32,831 --> 01:54:36,084
I could have taken the whole
Russian and Austrian army prisoners.

1207
01:54:39,004 --> 01:54:40,005
Yes.

1208
01:54:40,714 --> 01:54:42,716
But after all, there
will be less tears.

1209
01:54:44,259 --> 01:54:48,597
And I know you will remember
this gesture of kindness. Yes?

1210
01:54:50,015 --> 01:54:51,642
Thank you. [sighs]

1211
01:54:55,687 --> 01:54:56,688
Toast?

1212
01:55:05,822 --> 01:55:12,287
To friendship, a glorious peace
and the best interest of Europe.

1213
01:55:18,544 --> 01:55:20,504
Mmm. Burgundy.

1214
01:55:20,504 --> 01:55:23,048
- [classical music playing]
- [chattering, laughing]

1215
01:55:41,817 --> 01:55:44,278
- [dog whines]
- [whines] Hold on.

1216
01:55:44,278 --> 01:55:45,445
- [barks]
- Hey, whoa, whoa!

1217
01:55:45,445 --> 01:55:47,489
- [chuckling]
- Whoa, we don't say woof.

1218
01:55:47,489 --> 01:55:50,701
Okay. [babbles]

1219
01:55:50,701 --> 01:55:53,871
That's my boy. Attaboy.

1220
01:55:53,871 --> 01:55:56,790
Come here. Come here.
Sit, sit, sit. [babbling]

1221
01:55:56,790 --> 01:55:58,375
- [dog barks]
- [barks]

1222
01:56:11,180 --> 01:56:14,266
It is time to put this
mystery to rest, Emperor.

1223
01:56:14,808 --> 01:56:17,603
I want to know if
it's you or Joséphine.

1224
01:56:18,187 --> 01:56:24,985
And to that end, we will conduct
a very practical experiment.

1225
01:56:27,821 --> 01:56:30,991
At the end of the
hallway-- Take this--

1226
01:56:31,867 --> 01:56:35,829
Waiting for you,
undressed, ready to receive,

1227
01:56:36,788 --> 01:56:41,251
is 18-year-old Eléonore
Denuelle de La Plaigne.

1228
01:56:44,421 --> 01:56:46,590
She's brunette with brown eyes.

1229
01:56:47,174 --> 01:56:49,343
And the object of this, well,

1230
01:56:49,343 --> 01:56:54,681
hardly unpleasant task is to
see if you can father a child.

1231
01:56:56,058 --> 01:56:58,060
- And then we will have an answer...
- Mmm.

1232
01:56:58,060 --> 01:56:59,895
...to this nagging question

1233
01:56:59,895 --> 01:57:05,025
of who is keeping who from
an heir to the throne of France.

1234
01:57:08,987 --> 01:57:09,988
[sighs]

1235
01:57:10,531 --> 01:57:11,657
Shall we go?

1236
01:57:12,282 --> 01:57:13,617
May I have another, please?

1237
01:58:01,039 --> 01:58:03,041
[chattering, laughing]

1238
01:58:13,468 --> 01:58:15,095
The girl is pregnant.

1239
01:58:15,095 --> 01:58:17,389
You made her
pregnant. [chuckles]

1240
01:58:19,057 --> 01:58:20,058
[Napoleon] Mm-hmm.

1241
01:58:20,058 --> 01:58:22,144
[chattering, laughing]

1242
01:58:30,444 --> 01:58:32,070
Uh, I know I didn't see her.

1243
01:58:32,070 --> 01:58:33,989
[speaking indistinctly]

1244
01:58:39,286 --> 01:58:41,455
When are you going
to insist we divorce?

1245
01:58:43,165 --> 01:58:44,958
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

1246
01:58:46,793 --> 01:58:50,839
From the only woman that I've ever
loved and given all that I've conquered.

1247
01:58:50,839 --> 01:58:56,887
I'm just too tired to wait for you
to tell me what I know is coming.

1248
01:58:59,306 --> 01:59:00,557
If you insist.

1249
01:59:03,519 --> 01:59:06,021
[sighs] I'll make
it easy for you.

1250
01:59:10,567 --> 01:59:14,988
[sighs] I know you will
have a bastard child.

1251
01:59:20,202 --> 01:59:23,997
If I succeed in making the birth of
a boy that I shall call my own son,

1252
01:59:24,915 --> 01:59:28,877
I want you as a witness to pretend
the confinement of the empress.

1253
01:59:31,088 --> 01:59:32,297
[stammers] Your Highness,

1254
01:59:32,297 --> 01:59:35,843
you are asking me to lie about
the status of the mother of your heir.

1255
01:59:37,553 --> 01:59:39,555
That is another
way of putting it, yes.

1256
01:59:39,555 --> 01:59:40,639
[scoffs]

1257
01:59:41,807 --> 01:59:47,563
Emperor... [sighs] ...it is my
honor and my duty, of course,

1258
01:59:47,563 --> 01:59:49,565
to do as you require of me.

1259
01:59:49,565 --> 01:59:53,527
But if asked, I cannot contain
that which I know to be the truth.

1260
01:59:54,570 --> 01:59:56,572
And painful though it is,

1261
01:59:56,572 --> 02:00:01,159
the truth is that the empress is no
longer capable of bearing you a child.

1262
02:00:12,504 --> 02:00:15,299
My good Joséphine. [sighs]

1263
02:00:16,758 --> 02:00:17,759
Hmm?

1264
02:00:19,553 --> 02:00:21,180
You know how I've loved you.

1265
02:00:24,141 --> 02:00:27,519
It is you, to you alone,

1266
02:00:28,729 --> 02:00:32,316
that I owe the few moments of
happiness I have known in this world.

1267
02:00:32,316 --> 02:00:33,442
Hmm.

1268
02:00:36,278 --> 02:00:40,032
My destiny is more
powerful than my will.

1269
02:00:42,117 --> 02:00:48,123
And my affections must yield
to the interests of my people.

1270
02:00:48,707 --> 02:00:50,709
[chuckling]

1271
02:01:08,769 --> 02:01:11,063
[Eugène] "Three
million francs per year.

Malmaison and its revenues.

02:01:14,691 --> 02:01:16,860
The Élysée Palace in Paris.

1274
02:01:17,528 --> 02:01:19,196
The rank of empress.

1275

The title of "Majesty"

the imperial coat of arms

02:01:37,005 --> 02:01:38,549
[inhales heavily]

1282
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:43,720
The imperial decree for the
dissolution of the marriage

1283
02:01:44,888 --> 02:01:48,600
between the Emperor Napoleon
and the Empress Joséphine.

1284

[sniffles]

1285
02:01:57,234 --> 02:02:02,531
"My people desire that this throne,
where providence has placed me,

1286
02:02:03,073 --> 02:02:04,741
would be given to my children.

1287
02:02:06,493 --> 02:02:10,664
However, I have lost hope of
having children from my marriage

1288
02:02:10,664 --> 02:02:13,417
to my beloved wife,
Empress Joséphine.

1289
02:02:14,418 --> 02:02:18,505
I have then been led to listen
only to the good of the state

1290
02:02:18,505 --> 02:02:22,009
and to want the dissolution
of years of my life."

[Josephine chuckles]

[grunts]

1293
02:02:29,057 --> 02:02:33,770
You have embellished
my life for 15 years.

1294
02:02:36,023 --> 02:02:41,445
The memories of which will
remain forever etched in my heart.

1295

for the prosperity of France." [chuckles]

man brought to us by providence

to mend the evils of
a terrible revolution

and restore faith, the
throne and the social order."

1302
02:03:25,239 --> 02:03:26,615
Sorry.

[stammers, coughs]

1304
02:03:28,492 --> 02:03:31,078
- Emperor. Wait.
- Go. No, listen, listen. All right?

1305
02:03:31,078 --> 02:03:33,789
This is for your country.
That's what this is, all right?

1306
02:03:33,789 --> 02:03:35,499
- [whimpers]
- Now say it.

1307
02:03:36,959 --> 02:03:38,168
Say it.

1308
02:03:44,883 --> 02:03:47,928
"Our marriage has become an
obstacle for the prosperity of France.

Agreeing to the
dissolution of our marriage,

1310
02:03:53,100 --> 02:03:55,561
as I must, does not
change my feelings.

1311

The emperor will have in me
a-always his-- his truest friend."

[sniffling]

1314
02:04:42,232 --> 02:04:43,317
[Joséphine] Emperor,

1315
02:04:44,151 --> 02:04:47,321
you have just pronounced the
word which separates us forever.

1316
02:04:49,156 --> 02:04:52,326
{\an8}Your mistaken
ambition has ever been

1317
02:04:52,326 --> 02:04:56,622
{\an8}and will continue to be
the guide of all your actions.

1318
02:04:57,497 --> 02:04:58,707
Nevertheless,

1319
02:04:59,499 --> 02:05:02,961
you can never doubt the sincerity
of my wishes for your happiness.

1320
02:05:04,213 --> 02:05:07,799
May it at least afford me some
consolation for my sufferings.

1321
02:05:08,926 --> 02:05:11,470
- Yours, Joséphine.
- Thank you.

1322
02:05:12,137 --> 02:05:14,473
- Good morning, madame.
- Thank you. What's your name?

1323
02:05:14,473 --> 02:05:16,725
- Fleur.
- Fleur. Pleasure.

1324
02:06:08,318 --> 02:06:10,320
[chuckling]

1325
02:06:19,288 --> 02:06:20,289
I miss you.

1326
02:06:25,752 --> 02:06:27,754
Marital life is very
agreeable now.

1327
02:06:32,551 --> 02:06:35,137
You've shown such
great courage so far.

1328
02:06:35,137 --> 02:06:37,389
[sighs]

1329
02:06:37,389 --> 02:06:38,974
You must maintain it.

1330
02:06:40,392 --> 02:06:43,312
Do not permit yourself
to fall into melancholy.

1331
02:06:48,859 --> 02:06:50,569
You look best when you're happy.

1332
02:06:55,407 --> 02:06:56,992
Please take care of your health.

1333
02:06:57,993 --> 02:06:59,369
It is precious to me.

1334
02:07:00,704 --> 02:07:02,039
Will you write me tomorrow?

1335
02:07:02,831 --> 02:07:03,957
Mm-hmm.

1336
02:07:06,418 --> 02:07:07,544
And the next day?

1337
02:07:08,253 --> 02:07:09,254
Yes.

1338
02:07:10,339 --> 02:07:11,465
And the day after that?

1339
02:07:12,799 --> 02:07:13,800
Mm-hmm.

1340
02:07:15,302 --> 02:07:17,137
- And the day after that?
- Yeah.

1341
02:07:20,557 --> 02:07:21,558
Good.

1342
02:07:26,980 --> 02:07:27,981
[kisses]

1343
02:07:29,066 --> 02:07:30,108
[door closes]

1344
02:07:31,818 --> 02:07:35,405
{\an8}Once, an English ambassador
challenged my reasons for war.

1345
02:07:36,281 --> 02:07:39,785
{\an8}He said, "You French,
you fight only for money,

1346
02:07:39,785 --> 02:07:42,037
while we English,
we fight for honor."

1347
02:07:43,205 --> 02:07:46,875
I replied, "Everyone
fights for what they lack."

1348
02:07:47,626 --> 02:07:50,170
[chuckles, stammers]

1349
02:07:50,170 --> 02:07:53,257
This is not-- This is not your story.
This never happened to you, did it?

1350
02:07:53,257 --> 02:07:54,299
Of course it did.

1351
02:07:54,299 --> 02:07:55,759
- Of course it did.
- What do you mean?

1352
02:07:55,759 --> 02:07:57,928
We had the same saying
with my people and the Turks.

1353
02:07:57,928 --> 02:07:59,221
- [chuckles]
- Do you?

1354
02:07:59,221 --> 02:08:01,390
The English lack honor.
We can agree on that.

1355
02:08:01,390 --> 02:08:04,226
- [Alexander] Listen, there is-- [sighs]
- [mosquito buzzes]

1356
02:08:05,060 --> 02:08:09,982
There's nothing I think we can agree
more with than our hatred for Britain.

1357
02:08:13,318 --> 02:08:17,823
I just have to say
that it actually--

1358
02:08:17,823 --> 02:08:21,410
It would be my absolute pleasure
and honor if I could call you my brother.

1359
02:08:25,205 --> 02:08:27,207
There is a way for
you to call me brother.

1360
02:08:29,751 --> 02:08:34,798
Last night, at
dinner, I was... [sighs]

1361
02:08:34,798 --> 02:08:37,217
...charmed by your sister.

1362
02:08:37,217 --> 02:08:38,677
[chuckles]

1363
02:08:38,677 --> 02:08:39,761
Is she spoken for?

1364
02:08:39,761 --> 02:08:41,680
Ah. Sadly, yes.

1365
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:45,475
She's to be married to the
Duke of Oldenburg, I'm afraid.

1366
02:08:46,185 --> 02:08:49,146
Uh, and what of her
younger sister? Anna?

1367
02:08:49,146 --> 02:08:51,565
[stammers] Is there a
formal offer for Anna?

1368
02:08:51,565 --> 02:08:53,859
- [mosquito buzzes]
- [blows]

1369
02:08:55,611 --> 02:08:56,612
[chuckles]

1370
02:08:58,614 --> 02:09:02,159
Uh, well, you see,
An-Anna, she's 15 years old.

1371
02:09:03,368 --> 02:09:04,536
That is a detail.

1372
02:09:04,536 --> 02:09:06,455
[mosquitoes buzzing]

1373
02:09:07,956 --> 02:09:12,544
Our friendship is built on
our mutual distrust of England.

1374
02:09:13,253 --> 02:09:17,633
When we hold to the Continental
Blockade, we choke them from the trade,

1375
02:09:17,633 --> 02:09:20,010
and we fight for our
most sacred rights.

1376
02:09:20,010 --> 02:09:22,262
That is what is
important between us.

1377
02:09:22,930 --> 02:09:23,931
I just had a thought.

1378
02:09:24,598 --> 02:09:25,891
- No.
- No, say it.

1379
02:09:25,891 --> 02:09:27,601
- Should I tell you?
- Please.

1380
02:09:28,852 --> 02:09:31,605
Imagine an army. 50,000 men.

1381
02:09:32,105 --> 02:09:35,359
Russians, Frenchmen,
perhaps even Austrians,

1382
02:09:35,359 --> 02:09:38,153
marching by way of
Constantinople into Asia

1383
02:09:38,153 --> 02:09:39,905
would have only to
reach the Euphrates

1384
02:09:39,905 --> 02:09:42,449
to make England tremble and
bring her down on her knees

1385
02:09:42,449 --> 02:09:44,159
- before the continent.
- [chuckles]

1386
02:09:47,454 --> 02:09:48,622
It is incredible.

1387
02:09:49,831 --> 02:09:50,832
Toast.

1388
02:09:55,379 --> 02:09:56,463
[sighs]

1389
02:09:57,673 --> 02:09:59,174
- To you.
- To us.

1390
02:10:00,384 --> 02:10:05,305
His Majesty, the Emperor Napoleon,
wishes to make a formal offer to Austria

1391
02:10:05,305 --> 02:10:07,599
and to His Majesty,
King Francis,

1392
02:10:08,809 --> 02:10:12,104
for the hand of the
archduchess, Marie-Louise.

1393
02:10:13,772 --> 02:10:14,898
His eldest daughter.

1394
02:10:16,233 --> 02:10:17,442
No.

1395
02:10:18,485 --> 02:10:21,280
Uh, this union would bring
together Austria and France

1396
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:23,490
in an unbreakable
matrimonial bond.

1397
02:10:25,284 --> 02:10:27,286
[in German] Is this a joke?

1398
02:10:29,663 --> 02:10:36,420
[in German] I may find it
humorous... but His Majesty does not.

1399
02:10:54,313 --> 02:10:55,981
[in English] Did you
have a pleasant journey?

1400
02:10:55,981 --> 02:10:57,608
It was wonderful. Thank you.

1401
02:11:03,780 --> 02:11:05,199
You're quite petite.

1402
02:11:06,241 --> 02:11:07,451
I'm not accustomed to that.

1403
02:11:08,785 --> 02:11:10,204
[Marie-Louise chuckles]

1404
02:11:11,330 --> 02:11:12,623
How do I look to you?

1405
02:11:14,249 --> 02:11:16,001
Do I resemble my portrait?

1406
02:11:16,585 --> 02:11:20,923
Oh, yes. And even more
handsome and strong.

1407
02:11:22,216 --> 02:11:25,719
And you are even more
handsome, more be-beautiful.

1408
02:11:26,470 --> 02:11:29,765
[chuckles] I hope you're
pleased with your choice.

1409
02:11:31,433 --> 02:11:34,603
I hope so too. Would you
like to see the bedroom?

1410
02:11:34,603 --> 02:11:36,980
[chuckles] Yes, thank you.

1411
02:11:49,451 --> 02:11:51,578
Your Majesty, your son.

[carriage driver]
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

1423

[horse hooves approaching]

1424
02:12:40,502 --> 02:12:41,628

Oh, sweet child.

[baby grunts]

1432
02:13:52,282 --> 02:13:57,955
One day, you will understand

[in Russian] What's
good for Napoleon

1436
02:14:11,468 --> 02:14:13,345
is not good for Russia.

1437
02:14:14,346 --> 02:14:17,057
And if it is not
good for Russia,

1438
02:14:18,225 --> 02:14:22,271
it cannot be good
for His Majesty.

1439
02:14:24,273 --> 02:14:29,486
It is the timber trade with
Britain that makes Russia great.

1440
02:14:30,821 --> 02:14:35,492
Your father made
a serious error.

1441
02:14:35,993 --> 02:14:38,579
He put himself above Russia.

1442
02:14:42,416 --> 02:14:48,046
I do not want to
see Your Majesty

1443
02:14:48,755 --> 02:14:53,093
become unpopular
with the Russian people.

1444
02:14:55,470 --> 02:14:56,513
[inhales heavily]

1445
02:14:56,513 --> 02:14:58,557
I am not my father.

1446
02:15:01,101 --> 02:15:07,024
Do not make that regrettable
mistake of thinking that I am... again.

1447
02:15:08,025 --> 02:15:13,739
Russia will re-align itself with the
English. I am not afraid of Napoleon.

1448
02:15:15,699 --> 02:15:18,577
[Napoleon, in English] My
dear Joséphine, I'm sad today.

1449
02:15:19,119 --> 02:15:22,956
Tsar Alexander has turned against
me and forced me to invade Russia.

1450
02:15:23,916 --> 02:15:26,335
{\an8}He's decided to open
his ports to England

1451
02:15:26,919 --> 02:15:28,754
{\an8}while taxing the French.

1452
02:15:30,088 --> 02:15:33,634
{\an8}I must wipe away my melancholy
and begin the march to Moscow.

1453
02:15:34,927 --> 02:15:37,804
{\an8}I've convinced the heads
of Europe of this resolution,

1454
02:15:37,804 --> 02:15:42,392
and so I command the combined
forces of France, Austria, Italy,

1455
02:15:42,392 --> 02:15:44,186
Germany and Poland.

1456
02:15:44,770 --> 02:15:47,439
I see nothing but
success in my future.

1457
02:15:47,439 --> 02:15:50,400
[French soldier 1]
Keep your lines. Steady.

1458
02:15:52,736 --> 02:15:54,404
[French soldier 2] To the front.

1459
02:15:54,404 --> 02:15:56,406
[French soldier
3] Keep your step.

1460
02:15:58,492 --> 02:16:00,786
[speaking Russian]

1461
02:16:02,120 --> 02:16:03,747
- [shouting, grunting]
- [French soldier 1] Take cover!

1462
02:16:03,747 --> 02:16:04,831
[French soldier 2] Get down!

1463
02:16:11,296 --> 02:16:13,090
[French general]
Get down! Get down!

1464
02:16:13,090 --> 02:16:15,759
[Russian soldiers
speaking Russian]

1465
02:16:22,933 --> 02:16:26,270
[French general]
Hyah, hyah! Hyah!

1466
02:16:26,270 --> 02:16:28,397
After them! After them!

1467
02:16:32,025 --> 02:16:33,360
[grunts]

1468
02:16:39,741 --> 02:16:40,909
[Russian soldier grunts]

1469
02:16:42,702 --> 02:16:45,371
[grunting]

1470
02:16:46,748 --> 02:16:48,000
Whoa, whoa.

1471
02:16:50,794 --> 02:16:52,713
- [horse nickering]
- Whoa.

1472
02:17:02,181 --> 02:17:03,807
[horse whinnies]

1473
02:17:09,605 --> 02:17:13,275
- Get back! Drop back. Retreat.
- [grunts] Fall back!

1474
02:17:13,275 --> 02:17:15,360
[soldiers shouting]

1475
02:18:20,675 --> 02:18:22,593
{\an8}[Napoleon] My dear Joséphine.

1476
02:18:24,179 --> 02:18:27,432
I'm writing to you because I
have just won a great battle today.

1477
02:18:29,058 --> 02:18:31,352
Tomorrow we will
resume our advance.

1478
02:18:32,062 --> 02:18:34,439
Moscow is now
only 200 miles away.

1479
02:18:34,439 --> 02:18:37,985
And I think of you all
the while. All yours.

1480
02:19:01,549 --> 02:19:03,093
[flies buzzing]

1481
02:19:04,178 --> 02:19:08,223
[gasps, coughs]

1482
02:19:14,938 --> 02:19:16,022
[groans]

1483
02:19:17,733 --> 02:19:18,901
[French soldier] Spread out.

1484
02:19:19,567 --> 02:19:21,068
Search the buildings.

1485
02:19:21,653 --> 02:19:23,197
[grunting, muttering]

1486
02:19:24,573 --> 02:19:25,574
Search everywhere.

1487
02:19:27,659 --> 02:19:29,494
[French soldier] Nearly
there. Nearly there.

1488
02:19:36,752 --> 02:19:39,338
- [French soldier 2] Thank you, sir.
- [speaks indistinctly]

1489
02:19:40,129 --> 02:19:41,590
[soldier coughing]

1490
02:19:45,010 --> 02:19:47,930
- Thank you, Admiral.
- You were the brave of Austerlitz.

1491
02:20:16,250 --> 02:20:18,252
[dogs barking]

1492
02:20:50,659 --> 02:20:52,870
[dogs barking]

1493
02:20:52,870 --> 02:20:54,496
[Napoleon shouting]
Where are you?

1494
02:21:07,593 --> 02:21:09,887
300,000 souls
lived in this city.

1495
02:21:11,763 --> 02:21:13,140
And they've all just left?

1496
02:21:32,326 --> 02:21:35,245
Little boy.

1497
02:21:35,245 --> 02:21:38,707
Pspspsps.

1498
02:21:40,459 --> 02:21:42,002
Where are you?

1499
02:21:46,465 --> 02:21:48,091
Don't be frightened.

1500
02:21:48,926 --> 02:21:51,136
I'm just gonna give
you a little spanking.

1501
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:23,502
It's not very sporting, is it?

1502
02:22:25,379 --> 02:22:27,256
For his honor and
Russia's, not mine.

1503
02:22:32,678 --> 02:22:34,638
There's dignity to
be had in defeat.

1504
02:22:37,099 --> 02:22:39,101
[snoring]

1505
02:22:39,101 --> 02:22:40,727
[fire crackling]

1506
02:22:40,727 --> 02:22:43,272
[gasps, breathing heavily]

1507
02:23:18,307 --> 02:23:19,308
Who did this?

1508
02:23:20,726 --> 02:23:21,727
They did.

1509
02:23:23,228 --> 02:23:26,440
No, they did not. Be sensible.

1510
02:23:29,359 --> 02:23:32,487
- Who set these fires?
- [sighs]

1511
02:23:32,487 --> 02:23:35,991
Your Majesty, they did.

1512
02:23:39,828 --> 02:23:40,996
[sighs]

1513
02:23:41,622 --> 02:23:44,583
He'd rather burn his own
city than negotiate with me.

1514
02:23:45,375 --> 02:23:47,419
I didn't think he
had the courage.

1515
02:23:52,883 --> 02:23:58,430
Well, we'll go to Saint Petersburg
and have him burn that too.

1516
02:24:00,307 --> 02:24:03,852
We have let too
much time slip away.

1517
02:24:05,562 --> 02:24:08,941
We would be marching
into the Russian winter

1518
02:24:09,900 --> 02:24:13,946
with horses that are not
raised for this weather.

1519
02:24:15,489 --> 02:24:18,742
If we go back to Poland, we
can wait out the winter months.

1520
02:24:21,328 --> 02:24:22,287
Hmm?

1521
02:24:22,287 --> 02:24:23,580
[shouts]

1522
02:24:34,258 --> 02:24:37,761
[Joséphine] Napoleon, your letters
are a soothing balm to my heart.

1523
02:24:38,679 --> 02:24:39,972
I fear for you.

1524
02:24:40,722 --> 02:24:42,891
Remember that I alone
know your health...

1525
02:24:42,891 --> 02:24:44,434
- [spits]
- ...your fears.

1526
02:24:45,227 --> 02:24:48,772
I thank you as tenderly
as I will always love you.

1527
02:24:49,314 --> 02:24:50,357
Joséphine.

1528
02:25:08,417 --> 02:25:09,459
[sighs]

1529
02:25:09,459 --> 02:25:13,213
The horseman's disease,
Your Majesty. Piles.

1530
02:25:19,553 --> 02:25:20,846
Make it better.

1531
02:25:20,846 --> 02:25:22,347
[doctor] As you
wish, Your Majesty.

1532
02:25:27,769 --> 02:25:28,812
[sighing]

1533
02:25:37,696 --> 02:25:39,281
[Napoleon] My friend, Joséphine.

1534
02:25:40,449 --> 02:25:41,617
"Friend."

1535
02:25:42,701 --> 02:25:44,870
It is strange to write
that word to you.

1536
02:25:46,121 --> 02:25:48,123
You have always
been so much more.

1537
02:25:48,123 --> 02:25:50,209
[soldiers coughing]

1538
02:25:50,209 --> 02:25:52,711
[fife playing]

1539
02:25:56,215 --> 02:26:01,011
[Napoleon] Despite careful organization,
there have been breakdowns in supply.

1540
02:26:02,596 --> 02:26:07,392
We're suffering sickness,
desertion and famine.

1541
02:26:09,436 --> 02:26:10,562
We are winning.

1542
02:26:10,562 --> 02:26:12,648
[soldiers coughing]

1543
02:26:22,783 --> 02:26:26,119
- [Napoleon] Us or Cossacks?
- [French general] Us.

1544
02:26:29,331 --> 02:26:33,961
[Napoleon sighs] Joséphine.
Fortune has abandoned me.

1545
02:26:35,170 --> 02:26:37,464
{\an8}I know that it is
what fate has for me.

1546
02:26:38,549 --> 02:26:40,717
{\an8}Your words rattle in my head.

1547
02:26:42,386 --> 02:26:44,388
I am nothing without you.

1548
02:26:44,930 --> 02:26:46,515
I have no confidence.

1549
02:26:47,933 --> 02:26:49,560
I'm scared and I'm alone.

1550
02:26:50,853 --> 02:26:53,188
My men do not look
at me like you do.

1551
02:26:57,150 --> 02:27:01,488
I know I will return home to the
judgment of these European kings.

1552
02:27:02,489 --> 02:27:05,242
And they will not judge me
as they judge themselves.

1553
02:27:06,076 --> 02:27:07,452
They will punish me

1554
02:27:07,452 --> 02:27:10,247
by a standard they would
never apply to each other.

1555
02:27:11,498 --> 02:27:14,543
I wish you could put me on
your knee and take care of me.

1556
02:27:14,543 --> 02:27:17,254
[Berthier] Get the horses
covered and under shelter.

1557
02:27:17,254 --> 02:27:19,506
[Caulaincourt] This way,
Your Majesty. Over here.

1558
02:27:20,090 --> 02:27:21,508
[soldiers shouting]

1559
02:27:27,097 --> 02:27:28,307
[grunting]

1560
02:27:31,435 --> 02:27:33,687
Into the barn, quickly!

1561
02:27:36,273 --> 02:27:37,357
Everyone, in!

1562
02:27:37,357 --> 02:27:40,611
- Let us in!
- We're gonna freeze out here. Let us in!

1563
02:27:40,611 --> 02:27:43,405
- Block the doors!
- You have to find somewhere else.

1564
02:27:43,989 --> 02:27:45,741
Open up the doors!

1565
02:27:45,741 --> 02:27:47,242
We're gonna freeze to death.

1566
02:27:47,743 --> 02:27:49,953
Open the doors!

1567
02:27:50,579 --> 02:27:52,206
[soldiers shouting, grunting]

1568
02:27:52,206 --> 02:27:53,624
Out of my way!

1569
02:27:56,585 --> 02:27:58,670
We're gonna die out here!

1570
02:28:01,256 --> 02:28:02,257
[sniffs]

1571
02:28:06,428 --> 02:28:08,597
[grunting]

1572
02:28:10,098 --> 02:28:11,683
Majesty?

1573
02:28:11,683 --> 02:28:13,477
[exhales sharply, sniffs]

1574
02:28:14,645 --> 02:28:15,771
Yeah?

1575
02:28:16,563 --> 02:28:18,690
It's time for you to
leave this misery behind

1576
02:28:20,150 --> 02:28:21,652
and return to Paris.

1577
02:28:22,903 --> 02:28:24,196
I've found a way.

1578
02:28:25,781 --> 02:28:27,574
There's a sleigh
behind this building.

1579
02:28:30,452 --> 02:28:33,080
With two horses, we can
make Warsaw in a week.

1580
02:28:36,166 --> 02:28:37,459
Paris soon after.

1581
02:28:41,505 --> 02:28:43,882
It's our only way to get
you back alive, Majesty.

1582
02:28:47,678 --> 02:28:50,180
[breathes heavily] Please.

1583
02:28:52,516 --> 02:28:54,393
[French soldiers snoring]

1584
02:29:12,995 --> 02:29:16,373
- [screaming] Fire! Fire! Fire!
- Fire! Fire!

1585
02:29:17,583 --> 02:29:18,792
- [clamoring]
- It's spreading!

1586
02:29:21,336 --> 02:29:23,630
[French soldier 1] Hey,
wake up! Wake up! Get up!

1587
02:29:23,630 --> 02:29:25,716
- Fire!
- Fire!

1588
02:29:25,716 --> 02:29:28,385
[clamoring]

1589
02:29:31,013 --> 02:29:32,639

[panting]

1591
02:29:40,564 --> 02:29:43,567
- Put it out!
- Fire! Fire!

1592
02:29:43,567 --> 02:29:45,027
[clamoring continues]

1593
02:30:13,096 --> 02:30:15,057
This is a triumphant return.

1594
02:30:17,100 --> 02:30:18,268
I am the victor.

1595
02:30:20,270 --> 02:30:22,356
Alexander abandoned his city.

1596
02:30:23,857 --> 02:30:28,237
And though he lacks honor
and failed to sign a peace treaty,

1597
02:30:29,655 --> 02:30:32,324
my presence back home
will be proof to my people

1598
02:30:32,824 --> 02:30:34,826
they have no one
to fear in the world.

1599
02:30:36,787 --> 02:30:38,747
They fear you, Majesty.

1600
02:30:39,540 --> 02:30:41,291
They fear no one but you.

1601
02:30:48,799 --> 02:30:50,968
Do you think I'm this terrible--

1602
02:30:52,803 --> 02:30:55,472
terrible pers-- person
with a bad temper?

1603
02:30:56,890 --> 02:30:58,934
- No.
- Of course you don't.

1604
02:31:02,062 --> 02:31:04,857
You're not an idiot.
Or maybe you are.

1605
02:31:05,440 --> 02:31:06,900
I hope you get
eaten by Cossacks.

1606
02:31:19,872 --> 02:31:20,956
Stop!

1607
02:31:20,956 --> 02:31:22,416
[sleigh driver] Whoa, whoa.

1608
02:31:27,671 --> 02:31:28,964
[breathing heavily]

1609
02:31:32,801 --> 02:31:34,344
[wolf howling]

1610
02:31:40,976 --> 02:31:42,102
Where are we?

1611
02:31:42,603 --> 02:31:44,229
Borodino, Majesty.

1612
02:31:47,983 --> 02:31:50,444
- [howling continues]
- [horse neighs]

1613
02:31:50,444 --> 02:31:53,155
[Napoleon] I hear the
muskrats are agitated in Paris

1614
02:31:53,155 --> 02:31:55,490
at the idea of the
emperor's return.

1615
02:31:57,826 --> 02:32:01,455
The coward, Tsar Alexander,
now knows what I'm capable of.

1616
02:32:01,955 --> 02:32:05,209
Who else can move half a
million men everywhere in Europe?

1617
02:32:06,126 --> 02:32:10,047
Now a farmer boy knows that he
can become a marshal of the empire.

1618
02:32:10,047 --> 02:32:12,382
A minister. A cardinal.

1619
02:32:14,968 --> 02:32:16,345
[breathing heavily]

1620
02:32:18,388 --> 02:32:21,642
When I move, the
world moves forward.

1621
02:32:24,645 --> 02:32:25,979
[whimpering]

1622
02:32:30,943 --> 02:32:34,863
[Talleyrand] Of the 600,000
men you sent to Russia,

1623
02:32:34,863 --> 02:32:37,824
only 40,000 have returned.

1624
02:32:37,824 --> 02:32:43,539
Therefore, you have been
exiled in no uncertain terms.

1625
02:32:45,332 --> 02:32:50,295
The allied coalition of Austria,
Prussia, Russia and England,

1626
02:32:52,089 --> 02:32:54,383
and with the agreement
of the French Council,

1627
02:32:55,592 --> 02:32:59,346
grant you sovereignty
of the island of Elba.

1628
02:33:01,098 --> 02:33:04,184
A revenue of two million
francs from the French funds,

1629
02:33:05,185 --> 02:33:08,605
pensions for the Bonaparte family
and the Empress Marie-Louise.

1630
02:33:09,773 --> 02:33:14,987
It also provides for Empress
Joséphine to retain all of her properties

1631
02:33:16,488 --> 02:33:20,325
and an allotted annual
income of one million francs.

1632
02:33:22,327 --> 02:33:23,996
[sighs]

1633
02:33:32,421 --> 02:33:33,422
[sniffling]

1634
02:33:49,438 --> 02:33:51,023
I love France too much.

1635
02:33:56,278 --> 02:33:58,530
All I've desired was its glory.

1636
02:34:01,325 --> 02:34:03,285
I would never
bring her misfortune.

1637
02:34:05,787 --> 02:34:07,956
They want me to
abdicate. [sighs]

1638
02:34:09,082 --> 02:34:10,626
Fine, I'll abdicate.

1639
02:34:25,891 --> 02:34:27,893
[townsfolk
chattering in Italian]

1640
02:35:00,717 --> 02:35:01,760
Good.

1641
02:35:05,013 --> 02:35:06,014
[chuckles]

1642
02:35:07,349 --> 02:35:08,642
Wine.

1643
02:35:11,562 --> 02:35:12,771
[bell tolling]

1644
02:35:32,165 --> 02:35:33,792
[grunting]

1645
02:36:07,576 --> 02:36:08,577
Your Highness.

1646
02:36:10,329 --> 02:36:11,330
Empress.

1647
02:36:26,386 --> 02:36:27,387
[Joséphine] Here.

1648
02:36:32,267 --> 02:36:34,895
[Alexander] Joséphine,
Joséphine. Hmm?

1649
02:36:35,646 --> 02:36:37,147
[chuckles] I am charmed.

1650
02:36:39,233 --> 02:36:42,444
But... [sighs]

1651
02:36:44,780 --> 02:36:49,034
...you do not have to lock yourself
away just because he's not here.

1652
02:36:50,786 --> 02:36:53,163
I know what it is like
to be underestimated.

1653
02:36:54,790 --> 02:37:00,796
But your eyes, your
charm and your spirit,

1654
02:37:02,005 --> 02:37:03,215
it is in there.

1655
02:37:04,049 --> 02:37:07,594
It is yours, and you can use it.

1656
02:37:11,807 --> 02:37:14,351
[classical music playing]

1657
02:37:38,292 --> 02:37:39,585
[Napoleon] Boy, what day is it?

1658
02:37:41,128 --> 02:37:42,129
Tuesday.

1659
02:37:42,129 --> 02:37:43,213
The 11th?

1660
02:37:43,964 --> 02:37:45,090
Yes.

1661
02:37:45,090 --> 02:37:47,509
[inhales sharply] Boy, do you
know who Tsar Alexander is?

1662
02:37:49,219 --> 02:37:51,013
[stammers] No.

1663
02:37:51,013 --> 02:37:52,639
But you knew who I was?

1664
02:37:55,851 --> 02:37:56,852
[stammers] Yes.

1665
02:38:10,199 --> 02:38:11,200
There we are.

1666
02:38:15,662 --> 02:38:17,080
Ugh.

1667
02:38:17,080 --> 02:38:19,917
You know, it brings
me no great joy

1668
02:38:19,917 --> 02:38:23,170
to sit with my son and
have him gloomy and sullen.

1669
02:38:26,757 --> 02:38:27,758
[sighs]

1670
02:38:37,100 --> 02:38:40,312
You were not meant to
die on this island, my son.

1671
02:38:45,234 --> 02:38:47,778
My wife is entertaining
the Russian Emperor...

1672
02:38:50,781 --> 02:38:51,740
in my home.

1673
02:38:54,493 --> 02:38:55,327
[sighs]

1674
02:39:16,849 --> 02:39:18,183
[Napoleon] Dear Joséphine,

1675
02:39:18,934 --> 02:39:22,020
You are mine.
You will always be.

1676
02:39:23,564 --> 02:39:26,108
- I cannot stand it any longer.
- [crew member shouting]

1677
02:39:26,108 --> 02:39:28,443
It has been 300
days on this rock,

1678
02:39:29,111 --> 02:39:32,489
and I'm ready to come
home and reclaim what's mine:

1679
02:39:33,115 --> 02:39:34,908
you and France.

1680
02:39:46,920 --> 02:39:49,756
[crew members shouting]

1681
02:39:53,093 --> 02:39:54,845
[Napoleon] I'm taking your ship.

1682
02:39:54,845 --> 02:39:57,806
If you do not provoke me,
you do not have to fear me.

1683
02:40:16,867 --> 02:40:18,076
[Joséphine] Napoleon,

1684
02:40:19,036 --> 02:40:23,248
I'm a flower that opens its
petals and smiles to the sunshine,

1685
02:40:24,374 --> 02:40:27,878
unconscious that the storm
is near which will lay me low

1686
02:40:27,878 --> 02:40:31,048
- and scatter leaves to the heavens.
- [groans]

1687
02:40:31,048 --> 02:40:33,133
Come quickly, my friend.

1688
02:40:45,729 --> 02:40:47,189
[kisses]

1689
02:41:01,703 --> 02:41:05,123
- [wheezing]
- If you would open your mouth, please.

1690
02:41:05,916 --> 02:41:07,960
[groaning]

1691
02:41:10,379 --> 02:41:11,380
Thank you.

1692
02:41:16,301 --> 02:41:17,511
Thank you.

1693
02:41:18,303 --> 02:41:21,640
Well, your chest is congested.
Your throat is aflame.

1694
02:41:22,808 --> 02:41:24,643
My suggestion is to stay in bed.

1695
02:41:25,477 --> 02:41:28,438
[wheezing] But
Napoleon is coming.

1696
02:41:28,981 --> 02:41:31,733
It would be unwise
to receive any visitors.

1697
02:41:31,733 --> 02:41:33,443
But Napoleon is coming.

1698
02:41:33,443 --> 02:41:34,611
I understand.

1699
02:41:47,666 --> 02:41:49,668
[wheezing]

1700
02:41:54,173 --> 02:41:56,133
[Dr. Corvisart] Just
keep her comfortable.

1701
02:42:15,944 --> 02:42:16,987
Whoa, whoa!

1702
02:42:24,036 --> 02:42:25,120
Your Majesty.

1703
02:42:29,958 --> 02:42:31,251
You may speak.

1704
02:42:31,251 --> 02:42:34,505
Bonaparte, Your
Majesty. He has returned.

1705
02:42:34,505 --> 02:42:36,548
A ship landed on a beach
in Antibes this morning,

1706
02:42:36,548 --> 02:42:37,591
and they're on the march.

1707
02:42:37,591 --> 02:42:40,719
Napoleon Bonaparte is
marching towards Paris.

1708
02:42:40,719 --> 02:42:44,014
[breathing heavily]

1709
02:42:44,014 --> 02:42:45,390
More.

1710
02:42:45,390 --> 02:42:46,475
Your Majesty.

1711
02:43:19,883 --> 02:43:20,759
Afternoon, Colonel.

1712
02:43:21,802 --> 02:43:23,011
[colonel] Your Majesty.

1713
02:43:23,595 --> 02:43:24,680
General Marchand,

1714
02:43:24,680 --> 02:43:27,349
in defense of the royal
government of King Louis XVIII,

1715
02:43:28,141 --> 02:43:31,186
requests that you surrender your
weapons and cease your march

1716
02:43:31,895 --> 02:43:34,565
so that you may be arrested
and returned to your island.

1717
02:43:35,607 --> 02:43:39,486
Will you please inform the general that
I shall like to come and speak with him?

1718
02:43:41,196 --> 02:43:43,198
I have no fight with
my own Fifth Army.

1719
02:43:44,992 --> 02:43:45,993
Sir.

1720
02:43:55,043 --> 02:43:56,503
He wishes to speak.

1721
02:43:58,005 --> 02:43:59,006
Make ready!

1722
02:44:02,759 --> 02:44:03,969
Present.

1723
02:44:14,980 --> 02:44:19,943
Soldiers of the Fifth Regiment,
do you recognize me?

1724
02:44:23,739 --> 02:44:25,866
Do you recognize me, soldiers?

1725
02:44:27,784 --> 02:44:29,369
[French soldier] Yes, Emperor!

1726
02:44:29,369 --> 02:44:32,497
[laughing]

1727
02:44:35,584 --> 02:44:36,793
[Napoleon] I miss you.

1728
02:44:39,546 --> 02:44:41,548
I'm melancholy for my home...

1729
02:44:43,842 --> 02:44:46,011
and for our victories together.

1730
02:44:49,223 --> 02:44:50,724
I want to come home.

1731
02:44:52,184 --> 02:44:53,477
Will you join me?

1732
02:44:55,229 --> 02:44:56,980
Long live the emperor!

1733
02:44:56,980 --> 02:45:04,488
- Long live the emperor!
- Long live the emperor!

1734
02:45:04,488 --> 02:45:06,990
- [pledging continues]
- [cheering]

1735
02:45:16,792 --> 02:45:18,794
[crying]

1736
02:45:36,562 --> 02:45:37,563
[grunting]

1737
02:45:44,403 --> 02:45:45,529
Your Majesty.

1738
02:45:46,321 --> 02:45:47,406
[whimpering]

1739
02:45:49,533 --> 02:45:51,118
Thank you.

1740
02:46:19,563 --> 02:46:24,484
On May 26th,
Dr. Corvisart was called

1741
02:46:25,777 --> 02:46:30,949
and found her chest congested
and her throat inflamed.

1742
02:46:33,327 --> 02:46:35,829
Her illness was diphtheria.

1743
02:46:38,916 --> 02:46:44,796
On May 29th, last sacrament
was given, and she died.

1744
02:46:49,426 --> 02:46:51,303
And no one thought to notify me?

1745
02:46:57,100 --> 02:46:58,310
[sighs]

1746
02:47:01,605 --> 02:47:02,606
Hortense.

1747
02:47:05,526 --> 02:47:08,278
Do you blame--
[breathes shakily]

1748
02:47:08,278 --> 02:47:09,571
Do you blame me?

1749
02:47:11,865 --> 02:47:13,408
- [sniffles]
- I don't blame you.

1750
02:47:13,408 --> 02:47:14,493
Of course not.

1751
02:47:17,371 --> 02:47:22,251
I'm not to bear the burden of
responsibility... [breathes shakily]

1752
02:47:22,251 --> 02:47:24,253
...for the misfortunes
of your mother.

1753
02:47:25,379 --> 02:47:27,464
I want the letters that
I wrote to her. [sniffles]

1754
02:47:27,464 --> 02:47:31,593
I'm sorry, I don't have them.
They were stolen by her valet.

1755
02:47:33,136 --> 02:47:34,304
[blows]

1756
02:47:34,304 --> 02:47:35,597
Where did she keep them?

1757
02:47:37,975 --> 02:47:40,477
In the cupboard in her
bedroom, next to her bed.

1758
02:47:44,106 --> 02:47:45,524
What did he do with them?

1759
02:47:47,943 --> 02:47:49,528
Her valet sold them.

1760
02:47:55,951 --> 02:47:57,911
- [cries]
- [Hortense] I'm sorry.

1761
02:48:00,873 --> 02:48:01,874
I forgive you.

1762
02:48:44,082 --> 02:48:47,211
{\an8}[congress member] Napoleon
Bonaparte has destroyed

1763
02:48:47,211 --> 02:48:51,173
{\an8}the only title upon which
his very existence depended.

1764
02:48:52,591 --> 02:48:55,010
{\an8}This congregation of allies

1765
02:48:55,010 --> 02:48:59,473
{\an8}shall form along the borders
of France and Belgium an army.

1766
02:48:59,473 --> 02:49:02,226
70,000 troops from England,

1767
02:49:03,560 --> 02:49:06,146
120,000 troops from Prussia.

1768
02:49:08,232 --> 02:49:12,194
This vermin has routed
the farmyards of Europe

1769
02:49:13,070 --> 02:49:15,239
while the farmers snored.

1770
02:49:15,822 --> 02:49:18,033
We should have struck
this blow long ago.

1771
02:49:19,117 --> 02:49:23,455
He has held the world
hostage with his egotism,

1772
02:49:23,455 --> 02:49:26,750
his insatiable hunger for power,

1773
02:49:26,750 --> 02:49:30,254
and his lack of
simple good manners.

1774
02:49:31,213 --> 02:49:33,674
We will all sleep
again without him.

1775
02:49:34,842 --> 02:49:39,972
I believe I speak for all of us when I
say that the only regret we all share

1776
02:49:40,681 --> 02:49:44,101
is that we allowed
this vermin to live at all.

1777
02:49:45,269 --> 02:49:48,897
250,000 men with the traitor.

1778
02:49:50,107 --> 02:49:56,071
25,000 men, 125,000 men

1779
02:49:56,071 --> 02:49:58,824
and 100,000 men...

1780
02:50:02,327 --> 02:50:05,664
against our 125,000 men.

1781
02:50:08,125 --> 02:50:09,710
This is a fight on land.

1782
02:50:11,378 --> 02:50:14,381
This is what Britain does not
know how to do that I know.

1783
02:50:16,675 --> 02:50:20,762
Strike quickly against
Wellington and Blücher.

1784
02:50:21,555 --> 02:50:23,140
Defeat them separately.

1785
02:50:24,183 --> 02:50:27,853
Disallow them from
uniting forces here.

1786
02:50:46,955 --> 02:50:47,956
[inhales sharply]

1787
02:50:56,757 --> 02:50:57,841
[sighs]

1788
02:51:06,683 --> 02:51:07,684
[sniffs]

1789
02:51:11,021 --> 02:51:12,231
Morning.

1790
02:51:12,231 --> 02:51:14,316
- Morning.
- [grunts]

1791
02:51:14,316 --> 02:51:15,859
The Prussians are advancing.

1792
02:51:16,944 --> 02:51:18,445
We should begin the offensive.

1793
02:51:19,154 --> 02:51:21,240
[Napoleon] We must
wait for the ground to dry.

1794
02:51:23,742 --> 02:51:27,037
Blücher will never make it in
time. I'll have Wellington by lunch.

1795
02:51:34,461 --> 02:51:37,631
[thunder rumbling]

1796
02:51:39,591 --> 02:51:41,009
[sighs, grunts]

1797
02:51:42,970 --> 02:51:44,388
[clears throat]

1798
02:51:49,852 --> 02:51:53,063
I never get wet if I can
help it. [clears throat]

1799
02:52:39,151 --> 02:52:42,070
[thunder rumbling]

1800
02:52:58,754 --> 02:53:00,130
What shall I tell the men?

1801
02:53:02,174 --> 02:53:03,884
Tell them to make the rain stop.

1802
02:53:06,887 --> 02:53:11,225
- [British soldier 1] Coming through!
- [British soldier 2] In formation!

1803
02:53:12,684 --> 02:53:15,354
[Wellesley] Now's your
time, lads. Now's your time.

1804
02:53:16,688 --> 02:53:18,315
Now, listen very carefully.

1805
02:53:19,775 --> 02:53:24,696
Patience is the order of the day
today. Patience shall win the day.

1806
02:53:25,447 --> 02:53:27,699
We must hold this ground.

1807
02:53:28,408 --> 02:53:30,202
Let them come to us.

1808
02:53:30,202 --> 02:53:32,120
[soldiers] Huzzah!

1809
02:53:37,459 --> 02:53:38,710
Go on, boys. Go on.

1810
02:53:40,879 --> 02:53:41,880
Whoa.

1811
02:53:42,673 --> 02:53:43,882
Good morning, General Blücher.

1812
02:53:43,882 --> 02:53:46,593
- Good morning.
- Estimated time of arrival, sir?

1813
02:53:46,593 --> 02:53:49,012
- Officer?
- About five hours.

1814
02:53:49,012 --> 02:53:50,681
About five hours.

1815
02:54:07,239 --> 02:54:08,615
Come on, boys. Come on, boys.

1816
02:54:09,867 --> 02:54:10,868
[grunts]

1817
02:54:13,620 --> 02:54:15,622
[soldier shouting, distant]

1818
02:54:21,170 --> 02:54:22,462
Oh, there he is.

1819
02:54:23,380 --> 02:54:29,052
He appears to be...
[chuckles] ...just sleeping.

1820
02:54:30,512 --> 02:54:35,934
One thing you cannot resist,
my friend, is a frontal attack.

1821
02:54:38,854 --> 02:54:41,857
Let's see how this general
can attack our position.

1822
02:54:44,860 --> 02:54:49,698
Sir. I have the emperor in my
sights. Do I have permission to fire?

1823
02:54:49,698 --> 02:54:50,908
Certainly not.

1824
02:54:51,408 --> 02:54:53,702
Generals commanding armies
have better things to do with their time

1825
02:54:53,702 --> 02:54:54,828
than to shoot at one another.

1826
02:54:54,828 --> 02:54:57,372
Hold your fire, rifleman,
on pain of death.

1827
02:54:57,372 --> 02:54:59,249
Go on, boys. Come, come.

1828
02:54:59,249 --> 02:55:01,126
[British soldier] A
runner coming through!

1829
02:55:02,628 --> 02:55:04,296
Blücher, 11 to 12 miles, sir.

1830
02:55:05,130 --> 02:55:06,965
[British general 1]
Attention, follow me.

1831
02:55:07,466 --> 02:55:10,010
- Blücher at 11 to 12 miles, sir.
- Jesus Christ.

1832
02:55:10,010 --> 02:55:12,179
- I want a report every hour.
- Yes, sir.

1833
02:55:14,973 --> 02:55:18,644
[French soldier] Runner
coming through. Make way.

1834
02:55:18,644 --> 02:55:21,647
Oh. Oh.

1835
02:55:23,232 --> 02:55:26,151
[panting] Prussians on
the roadside, 12 miles.

1836
02:55:32,407 --> 02:55:36,286
Prussian troops have been sighted
on the road, sire. Twelve miles.

1837
02:55:39,915 --> 02:55:41,124
Ready the cannons.

1838
02:55:44,753 --> 02:55:46,421
Ready the cannons!

1839
02:55:46,421 --> 02:55:49,508
[French soldiers clamoring]

1840
02:55:49,508 --> 02:55:51,635
[French general] Go on! Move!

1841
02:55:57,015 --> 02:56:00,310
[French soldiers shouting]

1842
02:56:01,061 --> 02:56:03,647
[French soldier 1] Ready!
Cannons are ready!

1843
02:56:03,647 --> 02:56:05,607
[French soldier 2]
Cannons are ready!

1844
02:56:05,607 --> 02:56:07,401
[French general] The
rain has stopped, sir.

1845
02:56:16,326 --> 02:56:18,036
Prepare to fire!

1846
02:56:21,456 --> 02:56:23,041
[breathes heavily]

1847
02:56:27,671 --> 02:56:30,257
- Fire!
- [French soldiers] Fire!

1848
02:56:36,263 --> 02:56:37,806
[British general 2] Take cover!

1849
02:56:40,601 --> 02:56:42,936
Straight into position. Steady.

1850
02:56:42,936 --> 02:56:47,107
Prepare for the
advance. Get ready.

1851
02:56:48,442 --> 02:56:49,902
Prepare for the advance.

1852
02:56:49,902 --> 02:56:52,070
Readjust to 195!

1853
02:56:52,070 --> 02:56:54,198
Adjust 195!

1854
02:56:54,198 --> 02:56:56,950
[French soldier] Elevation 195.

1855
02:56:59,995 --> 02:57:01,121
Adjusted!

1856
02:57:03,081 --> 02:57:05,959
Prepare to fire! Fire!

1857
02:57:05,959 --> 02:57:07,586
[French soldiers] Fire!

1858
02:57:09,963 --> 02:57:12,591
[British soldiers
shouting, screaming]

1859
02:57:12,591 --> 02:57:15,802
[British general 2] Keep your
head down. Seventh, take over.

1860
02:57:22,392 --> 02:57:24,603
[screaming]

1861
02:57:24,603 --> 02:57:27,564
- [British soldier] Out the way!
- [British general 3] Hold fast, men!

1862
02:57:31,610 --> 02:57:35,113
Infantry, advance!

1863
02:57:35,113 --> 02:57:37,574
- [march playing]
- [French general 1] Left company!

1864
02:57:37,574 --> 02:57:41,495
[speaks indistinctly] And march!

1865
02:57:41,495 --> 02:57:43,664
[French general 2]
Get in formation. Now!

1866
02:57:45,666 --> 02:57:46,792
Keep them away!

1867
02:57:48,043 --> 02:57:49,044
Join!

1868
02:57:51,171 --> 02:57:52,965
[drums playing]

1869
02:57:58,428 --> 02:58:02,516
[French general] Second wave,
advance! Over the top, men!

1870
02:58:03,517 --> 02:58:04,935
Hold the line!

1871
02:58:04,935 --> 02:58:06,979
Cannons!

1872
02:58:07,688 --> 02:58:09,481
- Fire!
- [French soldiers shouting]

1873
02:58:12,901 --> 02:58:14,444
[British general 1] Get ready.

1874
02:58:15,529 --> 02:58:16,780
[British general 3] Hold fast.

1875
02:58:17,573 --> 02:58:18,991
[British general 2] Fire!

1876
02:58:28,333 --> 02:58:30,460
[British general 3] You
there, get on that cannon.

1877
02:58:32,504 --> 02:58:34,381
[French soldiers clamoring]

1878
02:58:40,596 --> 02:58:41,638
[British soldier] Fire!

1879
02:58:44,391 --> 02:58:45,767
[screaming]

1880
02:58:48,520 --> 02:58:50,314
[French general 2] Fill the gap!

1881
02:58:52,149 --> 02:58:53,567
[French general
1] Keep the line!

1882
02:58:55,611 --> 02:58:58,030
[soldiers shouting]

1883
02:59:01,074 --> 02:59:03,702
Skirmishers, keep
advancing! [yelps]

1884
02:59:03,702 --> 02:59:05,120
[French general
2] Get in formation.

1885
02:59:05,120 --> 02:59:06,955
Fire at will.

1886
02:59:12,252 --> 02:59:14,588
[British general 2] Keep
them back, men. Fire.

1887
02:59:14,588 --> 02:59:17,674
[drums playing]

1888
02:59:17,674 --> 02:59:20,928
Go on, go on.
Don't let them rally!

1889
02:59:22,971 --> 02:59:24,139
[clamoring]

1890
02:59:25,182 --> 02:59:27,893
[British general 2 speaks
indistinctly] ...the strike position.

1891
02:59:27,893 --> 02:59:30,437
[French runner] Get up,
boys. Go on. Go on, boys.

1892
02:59:32,022 --> 02:59:33,357
Whoa, whoa.

1893
02:59:35,901 --> 02:59:38,820
Prussians, roadside, five miles.

1894
02:59:40,531 --> 02:59:42,157
[French general] Five
miles, maybe less.

1895
02:59:44,159 --> 02:59:45,827
We have to act
before Blücher arrives.

1896
02:59:46,495 --> 02:59:47,496
Out.

1897
02:59:50,332 --> 02:59:51,333
Out!

1898
03:00:02,261 --> 03:00:05,013
- [British general 2 shouting]
- [French general] Cavalry!

1899
03:00:06,306 --> 03:00:08,100
Charge!

1900
03:00:08,100 --> 03:00:10,435
[French army shouting]

1901
03:00:15,107 --> 03:00:16,608
Prepare to receive cavalry.

1902
03:00:16,608 --> 03:00:19,152
[British general] Prepare
to receive cavalry.

1903
03:00:20,153 --> 03:00:21,572
[soldiers shouting]

1904
03:00:27,828 --> 03:00:32,207
[Wellesley] We must hold our
ground. Stand fast to the last man.

1905
03:00:32,207 --> 03:00:34,543
We must not be beat!

1906
03:00:35,335 --> 03:00:37,588
Or what will they
say in England?

1907
03:00:37,588 --> 03:00:40,841
- [British general] Hold the line.
- [British soldier] Keep it tight.

1908
03:00:40,841 --> 03:00:43,802
[soldiers shouting]

1909
03:00:45,179 --> 03:00:48,682
[British general] Steady,
men. Stay in formation.

1910
03:00:52,102 --> 03:00:54,479
[French soldier]
Long live the emperor!

1911
03:00:56,815 --> 03:00:58,734
[British general] Company, halt!

1912
03:00:59,401 --> 03:01:02,779
[British general 2] Form
square! Form square!

1913
03:01:13,040 --> 03:01:15,709
[shouting, clamoring]

1914
03:01:18,420 --> 03:01:21,006
[French general]
Long live the emperor!

1915
03:01:24,092 --> 03:01:27,763
[British general] One
section, fire. Two section, fire.

1916
03:01:28,722 --> 03:01:31,475
[soldiers shouting, grunting]

1917
03:01:38,440 --> 03:01:39,316
[screams]

1918
03:01:41,276 --> 03:01:42,277
[grunts]

1919
03:01:44,154 --> 03:01:47,074
[French general] What do we
do, sir? We can't break through.

1920
03:01:47,074 --> 03:01:49,618
[British general] Keep them
running. Get them back in the square.

1921
03:01:52,329 --> 03:01:53,914
Show them your British steel.

1922
03:01:57,543 --> 03:02:00,504
[breathing heavily]

1923
03:02:05,592 --> 03:02:07,553
[French colonel] Present arms!

1924
03:02:08,929 --> 03:02:09,930
[huffs]

1925
03:02:11,265 --> 03:02:12,599
Shoulder, hold!

1926
03:02:17,187 --> 03:02:18,939
- They're here, the Prussians.
- [grunts]

1927
03:02:21,817 --> 03:02:23,694
- [grunts]
- First over the rise, Emperor.

1928
03:02:23,694 --> 03:02:25,487
[panting]

1929
03:02:39,793 --> 03:02:42,087
[soldiers shouting]

1930
03:02:49,720 --> 03:02:51,805
[French soldier 1] We
need to find a way through!

1931
03:02:54,641 --> 03:02:56,643
[French soldier 2] Break
the square. Break the square!

1932
03:02:57,769 --> 03:02:59,396
[screams]

1933
03:03:00,939 --> 03:03:02,566
[clamoring]

1934
03:03:07,279 --> 03:03:08,572
[Napoleon] Charge bayonets.

1935
03:03:09,448 --> 03:03:11,283
[French colonel]
Charge bayonets!

1936
03:03:13,368 --> 03:03:17,915
Your Emperor is with you.
You are the brave of Austerlitz.

1937
03:03:18,790 --> 03:03:20,334
Never surrender.

1938
03:03:21,168 --> 03:03:23,670
For homeland and glory!

1939
03:03:30,552 --> 03:03:33,305
[British general] Shoulder
to shoulder! Form lines!

1940
03:03:33,305 --> 03:03:35,057
[British general 2]
Shoulder to shoulder.

1941
03:03:36,433 --> 03:03:38,519
[soldiers shouting]

1942
03:03:39,895 --> 03:03:40,771
[exclaims]

1943
03:03:42,022 --> 03:03:43,315
Infantry, advance.

1944
03:03:43,815 --> 03:03:49,655
- Battalion and infantry! Advance!
- [sighs]

1945
03:03:55,327 --> 03:03:56,703
[French general] Keep the line!

1946
03:03:58,997 --> 03:04:01,208
[British general] Footmen, fire!

1947
03:04:05,128 --> 03:04:07,214
Second line, fire.

1948
03:04:11,134 --> 03:04:12,511
Prepare to charge!

1949
03:04:14,930 --> 03:04:16,306
Charge!

1950
03:04:21,562 --> 03:04:23,063
[soldiers shouting]

1951
03:04:23,063 --> 03:04:24,857
[British general]
Go on! Batter them!

1952
03:04:27,276 --> 03:04:29,444
[British general 2]
Advance! Advance!

1953
03:04:41,707 --> 03:04:42,916
Cavalry advance, sir?

1954
03:04:44,168 --> 03:04:45,460
Cavalry advance.

1955
03:04:46,587 --> 03:04:50,299
[British general] Prepare for
counter. Prepare for counter.

1956
03:04:51,633 --> 03:04:53,302
Full support.

1957
03:04:53,302 --> 03:04:55,971
[shouting]

1958
03:05:06,398 --> 03:05:07,399
[screams]

1959
03:05:07,900 --> 03:05:09,484
[screaming]

1960
03:05:10,194 --> 03:05:12,112
[soldiers screaming, grunting]

1961
03:05:21,872 --> 03:05:24,082
[grunting]

1962
03:05:28,253 --> 03:05:32,049
No. He can't help himself.

1963
03:05:33,300 --> 03:05:35,010
[British general] Sir, Blücher.

1964
03:05:41,725 --> 03:05:42,726
Thank God.

1965
03:05:43,227 --> 03:05:48,190
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

1966
03:05:49,525 --> 03:05:52,402
Come see how a
marshal of France dies!

1967
03:05:52,402 --> 03:05:55,072
Yeah! Hyah!

1968
03:05:55,072 --> 03:05:56,281
[pants]

1969
03:05:57,074 --> 03:05:58,992
[gunshot fires]

1970
03:06:21,265 --> 03:06:23,559
Yeah! Yeah!

1971
03:06:24,893 --> 03:06:27,062
[soldiers struggling]

1972
03:06:30,399 --> 03:06:31,692
[shouting, screaming]

1973
03:06:58,010 --> 03:07:02,472
The battle is mine. There
will be an end to the war.

1974
03:07:08,395 --> 03:07:10,022
{\an8}[whistle blowing]

1975
03:07:10,022 --> 03:07:11,940
[British general]
Senior officer, on deck!

1976
03:07:14,484 --> 03:07:16,361
Good day, good day, good day.

1977
03:07:19,615 --> 03:07:24,328
I am the first to admit when I
make a mistake. But I never do.

1978
03:07:25,078 --> 03:07:26,955
Because it is geometry.

1979
03:07:28,373 --> 03:07:30,751
I simply know precisely
where to place a cannon.

1980
03:07:32,294 --> 03:07:37,007
But tragically I cannot transfer this
knowledge to my marshals. [sighs]

1981
03:07:38,091 --> 03:07:41,303
That might be what
is most difficult in life.

1982
03:07:43,263 --> 03:07:44,932
Accepting the
failures of others.

1983
03:07:46,016 --> 03:07:47,267
You must not do that.

1984
03:07:49,728 --> 03:07:51,063
Encourage greatness.

1985
03:07:56,401 --> 03:07:58,612
- Mind your head, sir.
- [Wellesley grunts]

1986
03:08:00,447 --> 03:08:02,199
[British general]
Mind your head, sir.

1987
03:08:09,331 --> 03:08:12,417
- What are they doing there?
- Sir, it's the midshipmen. They adore him.

1988
03:08:12,417 --> 03:08:13,585
Well, get 'em out.

1989
03:08:13,585 --> 03:08:15,587
Clear the room. Uh, quickly.

1990
03:08:31,979 --> 03:08:34,022
- Your grace--
- Good morning, General.

1991
03:08:34,022 --> 03:08:35,399
These boys are delightful.

1992
03:08:37,317 --> 03:08:38,610
May I sit down?

1993
03:08:38,610 --> 03:08:39,695
Please.

1994
03:08:39,695 --> 03:08:42,281
[clears throat, sniffs]
And this breakfast.

1995
03:08:43,282 --> 03:08:47,661
Now I know why you have such
a successful navy. Thank you.

1996
03:08:48,453 --> 03:08:51,081
- [grunts]
- [Wellesley clears throat]

1997
03:08:53,542 --> 03:08:55,919
I've never visited the
English countryside.

1998
03:08:55,919 --> 03:08:57,880
I imagine I'll love
the Cotswolds...

1999
03:09:01,341 --> 03:09:04,428
- soft rolling hills, gentle light.
- [sighs]

2000
03:09:06,388 --> 03:09:10,767
Uh, my dear sir, it is only
by a narrow margin of opinion

2001
03:09:10,767 --> 03:09:13,061
that you have been spared
the fate of being shot.

2002
03:09:13,061 --> 03:09:14,229
[scoffs]

2003
03:09:14,229 --> 03:09:17,065
[chuckles] Politically,
I'm afraid it's impossible

2004
03:09:17,065 --> 03:09:20,569
for the British government to
allow you to stay in England.

2005
03:09:22,654 --> 03:09:25,699
You are permitted three
officers and 12 servants

2006
03:09:25,699 --> 03:09:27,993
to accompany you into exile.

2007
03:09:28,827 --> 03:09:32,497
Exile will be contained to
the island of Saint Helena

2008
03:09:32,497 --> 03:09:37,169
under the watchful eye of Governor
Hudson Lowe and his family.

2009
03:09:37,169 --> 03:09:38,253
[grunts]

2010
03:09:39,505 --> 03:09:40,506
Saint...

2011
03:09:41,715 --> 03:09:45,135
Helena. It's a small island.

2012
03:09:45,135 --> 03:09:47,596
[chuckles] More
of a rock, really.

2013
03:09:48,639 --> 03:09:51,391
A thousand miles from
the mainland of Africa.

2014
03:09:52,142 --> 03:09:56,647
I'm told it's very pretty, tranquil.
You'll have time to reflect.

2015
03:09:58,357 --> 03:10:00,526
Your correspondence
will be monitored,

2016
03:10:00,526 --> 03:10:04,154
your presence verified twice
daily by the orderly officer.

2017
03:10:08,158 --> 03:10:09,201
I see.

2018
03:10:11,453 --> 03:10:13,497
If I were to land
on British soil,

2019
03:10:14,081 --> 03:10:17,084
I would be allowed, by your
law, to stand here for a trial.

2020
03:10:17,084 --> 03:10:19,211
- [scoffs]
- You are denying me that.

2021
03:10:20,838 --> 03:10:21,922
[clears throat]

2022
03:10:22,673 --> 03:10:25,717
[exhales deeply, laughing]

2023
03:10:31,431 --> 03:10:34,268
One must also not forget
that I am only a man.

2024
03:10:37,020 --> 03:10:38,730
You forgot it, sir.

2025
03:10:40,607 --> 03:10:42,484
You thought you were a god.

2026
03:10:45,821 --> 03:10:47,573
I never said s-such a thing.

2027
03:10:57,165 --> 03:11:00,419
[crew member] Fix that
rigging line. Draw up the sails.

2028
03:11:02,004 --> 03:11:03,338
Go below deck!

2029
03:11:08,594 --> 03:11:10,012
[crew shouting]

2030
03:11:12,472 --> 03:11:16,810
[Joséphine] What will you do
now? I hate to see you alone.

2031
03:11:18,187 --> 03:11:22,983
Will you come to
me? Will I forgive you?

2032
03:11:24,651 --> 03:11:27,070
My sweet, stubborn Emperor.

2033
03:11:28,155 --> 03:11:30,741
I let you loose and
let you come to ruin.

2034
03:11:32,075 --> 03:11:35,287
Next time, I will be Emperor,

2035
03:11:35,287 --> 03:11:37,289
and you will do as I say.

2036
03:11:44,546 --> 03:11:47,257
[Napoleon] Well, you were right.

2037
03:11:48,675 --> 03:11:51,220
Every night I beg to
see you in my dreams.

2038
03:11:52,137 --> 03:11:55,432
And when I do, you turn me away.

2039
03:12:15,994 --> 03:12:18,872
- [soldiers chattering]
- [children laughing]

2040
03:12:20,624 --> 03:12:22,125
[Napoleon] Precision!

2041
03:12:25,128 --> 03:12:26,380
Precision.

2042
03:12:27,339 --> 03:12:29,716
[groans] Slow down.

2043
03:12:33,428 --> 03:12:35,347
First, you salute each other.

2044
03:12:40,143 --> 03:12:41,562
And drop down like this.

2045
03:12:42,312 --> 03:12:43,355
En garde.

2046
03:12:44,523 --> 03:12:45,649
Left foot back.

2047
03:12:46,483 --> 03:12:47,484
Yes.

2048
03:12:48,277 --> 03:12:49,945
Then you'll do two attacks.

2049
03:12:50,571 --> 03:12:53,282
Prime and seconde.

2050
03:12:53,282 --> 03:12:54,533
Okay?

2051
03:12:54,533 --> 03:12:55,784
Hold this.

2052
03:12:55,784 --> 03:12:56,869
Very good.

2053
03:13:03,041 --> 03:13:04,626
[children laughing]

2054
03:13:12,593 --> 03:13:14,011
[child] This way's more fun.

2055
03:13:23,270 --> 03:13:25,230
Girls, what's the
capital of France?

2056
03:13:27,774 --> 03:13:28,775
Paris.

2057
03:13:29,484 --> 03:13:30,485
And Russia?

2058
03:13:31,195 --> 03:13:33,447
Petersburg. And Moscow before.

2059
03:13:35,407 --> 03:13:39,828
Moscow. And who burnt
Moscow to the ground?

2060
03:13:44,249 --> 03:13:45,250
I don't know, sir.

2061
03:13:46,710 --> 03:13:47,711
I did.

2062
03:13:48,504 --> 03:13:52,341
I believe, sir, the Russians
burnt it to get rid of the French.

2063
03:13:52,841 --> 03:13:53,842
Who told you that?

2064
03:13:54,635 --> 03:13:56,094
It's common knowledge, sir.

2065
03:13:58,972 --> 03:14:00,098
[children chuckle]

2066
03:14:00,098 --> 03:14:02,476
Go. Go play.

2067
03:14:04,061 --> 03:14:05,062
[child] En garde.

2068
03:14:08,357 --> 03:14:10,943
[Joséphine] Can I tell you
what I have waiting for you?

2069
03:14:10,943 --> 03:14:12,277
[children laughing]

2070
03:14:13,111 --> 03:14:17,324
It is a secret. And I will
show you when you arrive.

2071
03:14:20,911 --> 03:14:26,250
Come to me, Napoleon.
And let's try this again.
