THANGALAAN

4
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,583
The forest reigns supreme out here.

5
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:03,458
Now the footprints are turning back.

6
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:08,541
The stench of blood fills my nostrils, brother.

7
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,791
Let the 'parai' drums resound.

8
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:23,625
{\an8}The aboriginals don't spare anyone
who goes there seeking gold.

9
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,166
{\an8}There is no gold there.

10
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:29,083
{\an8}There is nothing there
except for demons that kill people.

11
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,958
Even recently, five people were killed.

12
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,416
People are lured there
with false promises...

13
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,541
...not even their bodies
could be recovered.

14
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,833
That's the reason there is a ban
on that area.

15
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,375
Frank, who was here before,
just wrote some nonsense.

16
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,750
That is all a lie.

17
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,250
Please do not disturb me
with this anymore.

18
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,166
Lunch was nice.

19
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,458
Let me take your leave now.

20
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,250
- Hey, Varadha...
- Careful!

21
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,291
Where is your mind at?

22
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,125
Still basking in your nuptial bliss?

23
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,583
Your ceremonies are barely over...

24
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,791
and you are already in a hurry
to take your wife along to work?

25
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,083
He never listens.

26
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,583
Easy for you to talk, sister.
What would you know of my worries?

27
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,458
You sleep way past the rooster's call...

28
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,541
and rise only when the sun
hits your ass...

29
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,583
cook, and eat leisurely
and then finally head to work.

30
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:46,749
Yeah, right!

31
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,041
Only I know the hardships that come with
that quarter cawnie of land.

32
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:54,375
At least you own a quarter cawnie.
Can't say that about us.

33
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,416
Unless we start working in the fields
before dawn...

34
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,333
our livelihood will go for a toss.

35
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,666
The landlord will surely
ruin my happiness.

36
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,416
Eww! Mind your language.

37
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,499
Isn't that the truth?
Would the landlord spare latecomers?

38
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,791
- See you, sister.
- Okay, Arasani.

39
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, shush.
Keep it down.

40
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,833
The day has just begun.

41
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,500
Now, where did that boy go...?

42
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,208
Asoka!

43
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,166
Asoka!

44
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,125
What is it, Mom?

45
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,666
I am by the peepal tree.

46
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:43,291
You're off so early to sit and daydream?

47
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,083
Everyone's off to work
at the crack of dawn.

48
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,750
But look at my man here.

49
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,374
Like the tale of the king
who went to hunt pigs...

50
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,416
he is cosily tucked in and curled up.

51
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,916
Hey, you.

52
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,041
Wake up, man.

53
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,958
Wake up, you.

54
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,250
Calm down, you.
Calm down.

55
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:20,666
Shit!

56
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,583
You scream as though you're possessed.
Look, you've scared the kids.

57
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,291
You play this same tune every morning.

58
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,625
It's fine, dear.

59
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,416
Oh my, I was just jesting.

60
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:32,666
Woman...

61
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:36,750
How often must I tell you
not to rouse me from sleep?

62
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,458
If something were to happen to you,
what would I tell my children?

63
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,166
Why bother?
Your children don't even need me.

64
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:48,625
All that's left is for you to suckle them,
you shameless man.

65
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,875
Really,
what goes on in that mind of yours?

66
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,708
Look at them having a laugh.
Get up. Let's go.

67
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,083
Come on kids, let's go.

68
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,250
Hello, mate.

69
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,624
Tell me, mate!

70
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:10,250
You know that shiny fabric with silver
borders that the landlord's wife wears?

71
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,541
I want one of those made for Gunavathi.

72
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,541
Done, mate.
I will make one.

73
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:19,458
You're crowing too loud.
The cavalry might just answer your call.

74
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,000
You are quite the father to your kids.

75
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:26,582
Why don't you ask your beloved
what she desires?

76
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,375
Girl, Thangalaan belongs to you.

77
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:33,458
Uh-huh. These words that wash away
like tracks in the rain don't sway me.

78
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,499
Get this clear...
for this harvest festival,

79
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,375
you better buy me the kind of blouse
that the landlord's wife wears.

80
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,249
Or I'll snatch that
proud nose of yours, be warned.

81
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,125
Listen to your mother, kid.
She's dreaming for a second youth.

82
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,291
Why? I'm still in my prime.

83
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,707
You don't have to do it for nothing.

84
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,958
For every dress you gift me,
I'll birth you a child.

85
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,208
Huh?

86
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,583
You think this works like a barter?

87
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,165
You can never repay me,
you indebted woman.

88
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,166
I'll get you a hundred dresses.

89
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,666
Will you bear a hundred children?

90
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,416
I will. Buy me, and I will.

91
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,500
- How, my woman?
- Like that, that's how.

92
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,541
Hara Hara Govinda Govinda!

93
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,458
Hara Hara Govinda Govinda!

94
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:38,250
Om Namo Narayana!

95
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,457
Om Namo Narayana...

96
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,666
What are you babbling?
Raise your hands.

97
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,458
- Achuthaya Namaha...
- Achuthaya Namaha...

98
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,708
- Om Ananthaya Namaha...
- Om Ananthaya Namaha...

99
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,208
So, here's the thing...

100
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,166
you aren't from an oppressed community.

101
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,416
Yes...
you are the children of Lord Perumal.

102
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,333
Perumal's children, eh?

103
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:04,750
From now, avoid cow meat and
stop mingling with those slum-dwellers.

104
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,750
Got it?
We are a different folk.

105
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We must follow specific rules and ways.

106
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:14,833
After our death, our liberated bodies
must ascend to Lord Narayana's realm.

107
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,916
Get it?
Hey, Asoka.

108
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,000
Don't just be gawking at me.

109
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,833
Come and wear the holy thread.
Join our side.

110
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,208
Hey Asoka!

111
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,875
His mother, for heaven's sake!
Scram now.

112
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,125
I will be back, priest.

113
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,291
Asoka...

114
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,583
I was right here,
watching the priest.

115
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,375
So when are you
going to become a Brahmin?

116
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:36,541
Sure, he will.

117
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,791
Gengu wants all the slum folks
to don the thread.

118
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,291
Didn't I tell you to keep away from him?

119
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,541
Holy ancestor Gengamma,
Mother Kanniyamma!

120
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:18,916
It's nothing, it's alright.

121
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,041
That is it.

122
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:37,166
"The eastern sky shines bright
Shimmering clouds gleaming light"

123
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:42,916
"Dreams we cradled dearly
have taken flight"

124
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:48,999
"Grains glittering like
gold fill our sight"

125
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,290
"Seeds we sowed with care
Now have sprouted through the air"

126
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:57,791
"Gone are those days
Of serving our masters"

127
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:03,583
"The fruit of our labour in these lands
Are now in our hands"

128
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,291
"Those glass bangles, oh my!"

129
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,458
"While I'm busy reaping these grains"

130
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:18,541
"While I'm busy reaping these grains,
my dear... They're stealing my attention"

131
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:28,791
"My youthful reaper, standing tall"

132
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:33,791
"I'll heed your wishes
And be a fine wife, my husband"

133
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:37,583
"Oh my young husband
my sweet husband"

134
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:41,165
"I turn crimson when our hands touch"

135
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:44,749
"I feel secure when you
break into a blush"

136
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,375
"I shall even bestow a deed
just so you feel secure"

137
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,208
- "For real, my love?
- Of course, dearest"

138
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:53,666
"They strung you like a precious pearl
chain, those sweet in-laws of mine"

139
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:14,166
Dad, how does the landlord own
so much land...

140
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,750
when we have so little?

141
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:22,166
Didn't you know? These lands once belonged
to your father's ancestors?

142
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:27,750
You better believe it,
all of this land is ours.

143
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,708
The Zamindars, Jagirdars

144
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,625
- and the taxmen...
- Hey, do not touch me!

145
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,791
...were instigated and backed
by the British lords.

146
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,875
They tricked us and took our lands.

147
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,500
Land must belong to those who toil in it.

148
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,541
How can it belong to those who don't toil?

149
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:50,916
"Husband, you promised to adorn me in gold
when you asked for my hand"

150
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:54,416
"But now I'm toiling
under the scorching Sun"

151
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:58,583
"Now I'm toiling under the scorching Sun"

152
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,583
"My golden chariot"

153
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,583
"How sweetly you ask me
to adorn you in gold"

154
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,791
"How sweetly you ask me"

155
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:09,458
"Adorn yourself with these golden grains
my golden treasure"

156
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,958
"Adorn yourself with these golden grains
my golden treasure"

157
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:20,041
"While I lug stacks of the day's yield
My competitive husband matches my zeal"

158
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:24,250
"My farmlady,
who stands tall in the farm..."

159
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:33,791
"My farmlady, who stands tall in the farm
No man can ever match your form"

160
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,000
"My sweet wife!
Bring on the meat curry"

161
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:41,416
"My dear leftover porridge!
Here comes the landlord, get thrashing"

162
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,250
"Nightfall will soon be upon us
We must secure the cattle"

163
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,833
"Let's work with pride
and lead a prosperous life"

164
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,125
Hey, come and eat a little.

165
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,708
I don't want.
You eat.

166
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,541
Hey, Gengamma.

167
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Are you asleep?

168
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,000
Yes, I am.

169
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,166
Dad!

170
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,375
Hey...

171
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,415
- Kids, you're still awake?
- Nagamma...

172
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm not sleepy, Mom.

173
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,375
Of course you aren't, you night-demons.

174
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,540
Tell us a story and we'll sleep.

175
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,000
I'll smack you to sleep!

176
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,665
Mom, you don't need to tell us.
Dad will.

177
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,540
- What story, my dear?
- A spooky tale, Dad.

178
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:57,875
- Dad, tell us the one with Aarathi...
- When you were trapped hunting for gold.

179
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,541
Dad, tell us. Tell us!

180
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,457
Dad, tell us.

181
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,458
No, that one will scare you, dear.

182
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,999
Hey, all. Quiet down.

183
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,791
Dad, tell us. Tell us. Tell us!

184
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,500
What kind of children have you birthed?
Little monsters.

185
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,458
- Please tell us, Dad.
- Alright, I'll tell you.

186
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,000
I will tell you the story.
But listen closely, alright?

187
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,166
So...

188
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,583
Long, long ago...

189
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,000
just like what you see over there...

190
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,291
there was a terrain of rolling hills.

191
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,083
Beyond the hills, forests and river...

192
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,000
there was a place called
Aanamalai (elephant hills).

193
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,375
An elephant?

194
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,458
Not an elephant,

195
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,833
but a mountain that
looks like an elephant.

196
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,750
The forest echoed with the rumble of the
elephants,

197
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,250
roaring leopards, and wild pigs.

198
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,541
There was a massive river there
called Ponnar (golden river).

199
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,458
At the bank of that river...

200
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:07,708
Our king, returning victorious from
a battle with a rival kingdom...

201
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,166
while leading his large army
back home...

202
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,375
Who are they?

203
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,958
In the River Ponnar,
my grandfather...

204
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,250
my great-grandfather,

205
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,375
Kadayan, was mining gold.

206
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,208
Hey!

207
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,208
They're a tribe that gathers gold dust.

208
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,333
Oh.

209
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,625
Freeze, don't move.

210
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,833
By the order of the Monarch,
all of you are hereby imprisoned.

211
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,083
Monarch, eh?

212
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,583
Unadulterated gold...

213
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:49,833
I want it.

214
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:53,000
I want more...
I want more.

215
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,041
Monarch...

216
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:00,875
Only those truly in need will find it.

217
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,250
If we look on your behalf
we will not find a speck.

218
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,291
Step into the river.

219
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,416
Monarch...

220
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,083
the gold dust drifts in the water.

221
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,000
Just like baby fish, it can't be caught.

222
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,916
What of the gold in the land?

223
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,125
Only the gold dust in water
can be gathered.

224
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,166
It is the grace of Mother Earth
for its people.

225
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,625
The gold in the land is not for us.

226
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,416
I want that glittering rock.

227
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,208
All that glitters is not gold, Monarch.

228
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,083
It is doom.

229
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,833
March ahead.

230
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,166
Serpents!

231
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,916
How are you unaffected by cobra venom?

232
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,000
No, Monarch.

233
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:47,000
Our bodies have grown resilient.
It won't affect us.

234
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,041
It can't.

235
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:53,208
The cobras prevent us
from extracting gold.

236
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,041
They allure us with glitter, tempt us...

237
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:01,000
and then kill those
who dare to extract it.

238
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:05,250
Who is the sorcerer behind
these deceptions and spells?

239
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,708
Not a sorcerer, Monarch.

240
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,458
A sorceress.

241
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,250
Aarathi!

242
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:20,208
Descendant of the Nagas,
she reigns over these forest lands.

243
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:25,958
She stands guard over this gold-rich land.

244
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:31,041
She is the queen of this land.

245
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:35,875
All land belongs to my king.

246
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,458
How ignorant can you be?

247
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,750
This is not your land.

248
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,916
This land is held under her spell.

249
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,250
There's nothing you can do.

250
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:58,791
Go back to your village.

251
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,500
The cobras won't trouble us any longer.

252
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:19,041
March ahead.

253
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:31,250
Retreat.

254
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,541
Retreat.

255
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:43,958
Stand guard.

256
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:52,666
Can no one bind those sorcerers?

257
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,000
Why?

258
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,583
We can.

259
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:57,333
I will.

260
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:00,583
Then do it.
Go.

261
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,208
What's in it for me?

262
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,833
Hey, why spew such nonsense?

263
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,958
Don't you know what to
seek from the monarch?

264
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,375
Do you take me for an ignorant man?

265
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:15,000
You descendant of a wayward clan!

266
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:18,041
I want the gold.

267
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,000
What do you seek in return?

268
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:22,916
Land.

269
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:26,875
I want land, Monarch.

270
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:37,333
Donations to holy temples,
tributes to the Gods...

271
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:40,625
lands grabbed from us
under countless pretexts...

272
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:44,041
and bestowed to these priests,
higher up in the Varna system...

273
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:46,750
we need that land back.

274
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:49,625
Look at the arrogance
of the untouchable.

275
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,708
A lavish life handed
to the immoral, huh?

276
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,250
- You--
- Priest!

277
00:25:57,875 --> 00:26:00,541
Yes, you will get half of it back.

278
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:02,166
I desire that gold.

279
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:05,041
Bring it to me,
and your land shall be yours again.

280
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,791
Stand back!

281
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:46,083
You are a great warrior.

282
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:49,375
I declare you the Commander
of my forces.

283
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:53,708
Your reward.

284
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,416
Gold...

285
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:06,791
Take every last bit of it.

286
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:12,791
Gold...

287
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:14,625
look, it is gold.

288
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,208
- Gold!
- Gold!

289
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:20,375
Gold!

290
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:24,333
Glittering gold...

291
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:26,083
It is all gold.

292
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,375
It is mere mud.

293
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:33,791
- Mud!
- Trickster!

294
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,416
Is this the gold you spoke of?

295
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:51,416
Give it.
Give it back.

296
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:03,083
Monarch.

297
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:07,458
This Aarathi possesses the power
to turn gold into mud.

298
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:10,875
Shame on you,
don't use such deceit on me.

299
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:13,791
You're nothing but a charlatan.

300
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:16,166
King!

301
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:20,416
The erected idol of this Saint
is the cause of this turmoil.

302
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:24,541
It is this spirit that's causing
all of the sorcery occurring here.

303
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:29,166
Behead this spirit-saint's idol
and toss it away.

304
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:33,416
And the gold will be ours.

305
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:26,250
Gold!
All the gold is mine!

306
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,916
Gold... gold!

307
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:36,833
Blood spurting out of her gut,
spilled all over the ground...

308
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:44,125
turning soil, stones and rocks
into glittering gold.

309
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:54,625
But...

310
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:59,125
in the end, I couldn't bring back
even a speck of gold.

311
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:01,791
Hey.

312
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:04,958
Enough with the tales now.
Sleep.

313
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:25,625
Hey, hey!

314
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:27,291
Who is it?
Hey.

315
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:31,083
Hey, Asoka.

316
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:33,708
Mom, who is it?

317
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,458
Dad!

318
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:39,416
Hey!

319
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,125
Pour water.

320
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:49,458
Help, help!

321
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:53,166
Stay there.

322
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:54,708
Mom!

323
00:34:58,083 --> 00:34:59,333
Pour water!

324
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:00,666
Who is it?

325
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:02,208
Who are you?

326
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:08,416
Who are you?

327
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,125
What are we going to do now?

328
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:24,291
Resident of North Arcot District,
Kudiyatham Taluk, Vepur Pariah's slum...

329
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:28,666
Farmer Thangalaan Muni,

330
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:33,083
for his two cawnies
of land and its water sources...

331
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:36,583
as per the village's 'Rythuvari'
tax system, must either pay 10 pagodas...

332
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:39,041
or 80 vessels of grain as tax.

333
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,250
And in accordance with
the British government tax system...

334
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:47,125
is liable to pay an amount of 20 pagodas,
or 160 vessels of grains as tax.

335
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:51,000
The taxes must be paid
as per government orders.

336
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:58,208
- Hey!
- Hold on.

337
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,333
Thangalaan!

338
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:17,916
Stand back!

339
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,625
Dad!

340
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:45,583
Dad!

341
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:53,291
The landlord will pay the 30 pagodas
owed by Thangalaan to the British.

342
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:59,125
To work off this debt
and the interest incurred...

343
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:00,833
Thangalaan and his kin,

344
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:04,375
all seven of them
including his two-year-old son...

345
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:08,750
are ordered to work as
bonded farm labourers.

346
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:15,166
They are forbidden from working elsewhere
or leaving the village.

347
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:18,916
On violation of these terms,

348
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:24,041
they will be hanged to death
for defying government orders.

349
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,541
Step into the field.

350
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:58,791
Let the hands do the work,
keep your mouths shut.

351
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,916
First they seize our lands,
then they thrash us.

352
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,166
Dad, aren't you strong?

353
00:39:06,416 --> 00:39:11,708
They push us around and talk to us as
they wish and yet you don't utter a word.

354
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,833
It's making me so mad,
I'm gonna lash out on you.

355
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:16,250
Shut up.
Eat quietly.

356
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,916
All the Untouchables of Vepur's slums...

357
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:35,958
are ordered to assemble under
the peepal tree right away.

358
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,958
This is the order of the British Lord.

359
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:41,416
Sir, we have reached Vepur village.

360
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,541
You lowlife!
Move. Step away.

361
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:55,666
Hey, listen up.

362
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,625
Hey, quiet down.

363
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,250
His Excellency, Lord Clement...

364
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:04,291
has come to your village
seeking your favour.

365
00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:06,291
Since the days of the Chola rule,

366
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:09,208
until the
reign of the Muslim ruler Tipu Sultan...

367
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:15,833
you people, living in the Kolar region
of Mysore and the North Arcot district...

368
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:19,500
have helped in mining gold.

369
00:40:20,541 --> 00:40:23,375
Now, His Excellency Mr. Clement Lord...

370
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:26,500
desires to resume the good work with you.

371
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:28,291
No. Not happening.

372
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:30,291
Hey, stop.

373
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:33,416
Asoka! Asoka!

374
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:36,708
- Stop...
- Go home, you. Beat it.

375
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,333
Listen to me, go home.

376
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:40,083
There are no ghosts.

377
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:43,666
- Let's leave.
- That is just superstition.

378
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:48,416
Don't just stand there like a rock.
Come on!

379
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:51,166
You will come with me.

380
00:40:54,541 --> 00:40:55,708
That is an order.

381
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:59,125
- Go get them.
- Yes, sir.

382
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,166
There are no ghosts or beasts there.

383
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:06,583
The lord will give you
the daily wage you ask for.

384
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:08,666
One pagoda a day.

385
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:12,208
Free rice and meat on top of it.
Hey!

386
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:16,833
We need Thangalaan to do this to
protect our slum, Gengamma.

387
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:20,208
Look, no matter what you say or do...

388
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:23,166
he's not coming.
Go and find someone else.

389
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:27,291
This won't work, Thangalaan.
Figure it out with her.

390
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:30,958
You insist on going and want to
take my son along too?

391
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,250
Am I to leave him behind then?

392
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:34,666
If we all cower in fear,
what do we tell the British lord?

393
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:35,958
Exactly.

394
00:41:36,416 --> 00:41:37,708
Quit wailing, woman.

395
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,125
Fine, let's go convince Varadhan.

396
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:45,541
Woman, why are you being this way?

397
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:46,875
Get lost!

398
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:53,333
Are we and our kids to bow before
the landlord all our lives?

399
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:59,416
Even if just for a day,
we must live and die with dignity.

400
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:01,375
Understand?

401
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:06,250
Dignity counts, woman.
It is the only thing that does.

402
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,875
- Come, now.
- Leave me alone.

403
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,416
What kind of a woman are you?

404
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:19,416
It's okay, come now!

405
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:21,291
Get lost!

406
00:42:26,166 --> 00:42:27,208
Hey...

407
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:30,083
Aren't you a brave woman?

408
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:33,083
No harm will come my way.

409
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:36,333
Listen, take care of the kids.

410
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:39,041
I will return soon, alright?

411
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:41,083
I'm just here to
tend to your children...

412
00:42:42,166 --> 00:42:44,666
I just don't count, do I?

413
00:42:49,416 --> 00:42:50,708
Oh, my precious!

414
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:53,833
You are an adorned treasure.

415
00:42:56,791 --> 00:42:57,791
Hey...

416
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:01,333
Being away from you...

417
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,208
is like having a thorn
pierce through my heart.

418
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:12,000
Woman, I leave now but the thought
of you will never leave me.

419
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:15,041
You're leaving us behind...

420
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:18,458
leaving us to worry about
the dangers you might encounter.

421
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,791
it makes my gut churn.

422
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:25,000
Feel me quiver all over.

423
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,958
Here.

424
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:32,291
Touch me here.

425
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:35,208
I want to savour the warmth
of your hands just for a while.

426
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:38,333
Then warm me up all over.

427
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:42,625
I will offer you all the
warmth in my body.

428
00:43:42,916 --> 00:43:44,833
Hold on to it safe.

429
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:49,458
Believe me, I'll return
before that fire dies down.

430
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:51,833
Sure you will.

431
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:56,125
- Come now.
- Quit it, move.

432
00:43:58,458 --> 00:44:01,208
Gunavathi, kids... look up at the moon.

433
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,791
Look at the reflection
in water of the manger.

434
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:06,708
Go on, take a peek, Nagamma.

435
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,375
<i>Om Namo Narayana!</i>

436
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:16,250
<i>Om Namo Narayana!</i>

437
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:18,791
<i>Hara Hara Govinda, Govinda!</i>

438
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:20,666
<i>Hara Hara Govinda, Govinda!</i>

439
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:24,583
<i>Hara Hara Govinda, Govinda!</i>

440
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:27,666
<i>Govinda, Govinda!</i>

441
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:29,625
Trust me. You will be fine.

442
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:30,958
- I don't want to...
- Go!

443
00:44:32,291 --> 00:44:33,291
Go!

444
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:37,833
All set to leave, uncle?

445
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:42,458
Hey, take care of Asoka.

446
00:44:42,958 --> 00:44:45,083
Stay close to dad, brother.

447
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:47,416
My husband...

448
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:48,875
Move it!

449
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:29,541
My dear, my father, my divine mother...

450
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,166
protect us and ward off evil.

451
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:34,375
What are they doing?

452
00:45:34,583 --> 00:45:35,833
They call it as hero's stone.

453
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,791
People who die in war and
for the welfare of their villages...

454
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:41,708
and hunters of tigers and pigs
are considered as heroes, sir.

455
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,750
It's worship of a small god.

456
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
That's it.

457
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:48,375
Narayana, if our journey
proves safe and bountiful...

458
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:50,750
I vow to erect you a temple
with my earnings.

459
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:52,875
For that alone, I am going, Lord.

460
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,875
- Hey...
- Master?

461
00:45:55,416 --> 00:45:57,625
Sacred ash? Sacred thread?

462
00:45:58,041 --> 00:45:59,791
It's an insult to the
sanctity of the thread.

463
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,208
Take it off right away.

464
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:04,708
But I must ascend to
the lord's abode after death, master!

465
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:06,000
You, untouchable!

466
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:09,083
You think anyone who dons a thread
can ascend to heaven?

467
00:46:09,791 --> 00:46:12,083
Is there no limit
to who desires what?

468
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:15,000
What a disgrace!
This entire fiasco is Ramanujam's doing.

469
00:46:15,958 --> 00:46:17,375
The truth is...

470
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:22,416
- our birth is not in our hands.
- Quiet!

471
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,166
You are excessive.

472
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:27,750
One more word, and I'll rip off
that thread and send you packing.

473
00:46:29,541 --> 00:46:31,875
- Let's get going.
- Govinda, Govinda!

474
00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:13,708
The path ends here.
Just forests beyond this point.

475
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:21,833
Lord, over here!

476
00:47:22,041 --> 00:47:25,500
If we venture through the woods and
cross that river, we'll get there.

477
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:27,208
Right here, yes, over here.

478
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:28,457
I know it well, Lord.

479
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:30,250
There is a path.
We just need to follow it.

480
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:31,625
- Come on, let's go.
- Hey.

481
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:33,416
Stupid! Fool!

482
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:34,708
Your hand. Give me your hand.

483
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:41,041
These white men are
determined to find the gold.

484
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,000
But there are ghosts standing guard!

485
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:45,000
In a few days,
they'll see it for themselves.

486
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,875
That to seek gold here
is to seek death.

487
00:47:48,416 --> 00:47:50,750
Plan a quick return
to your village, fellows.

488
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:53,458
Be mindful with the use of supplies.
Understood?

489
00:47:53,666 --> 00:47:56,250
I will take their consent and leave.

490
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:58,833
Sir, with your permission...

491
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:02,125
I will take leave.
Have a safe journey.

492
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:05,791
Hey, move aside.

493
00:48:09,041 --> 00:48:10,250
Standing in my way!

494
00:48:23,041 --> 00:48:24,166
There.

495
00:48:24,708 --> 00:48:26,000
That is the way.

496
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,708
Get ready to leave.

497
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:42,916
I've known these primal lands
from my time as a young hunter.

498
00:48:43,125 --> 00:48:46,416
I've heard the tales of
ghosts cloaked in stone.

499
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:50,375
I'm aware that scorpions riding on snakes
will obstruct our path.

500
00:48:50,666 --> 00:48:52,208
What you looking at?
Move.

501
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,375
Hey, move.

502
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:56,791
- Let's go.
- This is the path.

503
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:20,541
Come on, little brother.

504
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:05,666
Uncle, are all the lands
beyond the river filled with gold?

505
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:07,625
Yes.

506
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:17,375
We can step in.
The currents are favourable.

507
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:20,250
We will advance on this side.
Let's go.

508
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,250
Lord... no, hold on!

509
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,375
Go... that side.

510
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,625
What do you know?
Let's go, Lord.

511
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:30,958
Lord, listen.
There is a pit over there.

512
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:34,500
Quiet down.
I will take you, Lord.

513
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:35,791
Quiet.

514
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,791
- Is this the way?
- Yes.

515
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:44,791
Oh, brother.

516
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,875
The wild streams that conceal the path...

517
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:51,125
and spiralling storms that raise dust...

518
00:50:51,583 --> 00:50:53,500
the slithering snakes and their sting...

519
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:56,208
and scorpions itching to strike...

520
00:50:57,041 --> 00:50:58,958
are the guardians of this land.

521
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:05,583
Even lives are trite here,
steel your body.

522
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:08,125
March on ahead!

523
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:10,458
Brother!

524
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:16,666
We know no fear,
it's not in our nature.

525
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,583
We are born strong,
in mind and body.

526
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:22,375
Here he goes.

527
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:23,708
Asoka, watch out.

528
00:51:24,666 --> 00:51:25,750
Careful, everyone.

529
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:27,708
Careful.

530
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,500
Little brother...

531
00:51:31,708 --> 00:51:34,291
The current is getting stronger,
hold tight.

532
00:51:34,583 --> 00:51:36,208
- Uncle!
- Don't stop.

533
00:51:36,791 --> 00:51:37,916
Keep moving.

534
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:46,125
Keep moving.

535
00:52:33,166 --> 00:52:34,208
Asoka!

536
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,416
Thangalaan, where are you?

537
00:52:36,666 --> 00:52:37,958
Uncle!

538
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:39,750
Hold on tight.

539
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:41,500
No, Gengu! Gengu!

540
00:52:55,458 --> 00:52:56,458
Keep moving.

541
00:53:06,958 --> 00:53:08,000
Come on.

542
00:53:08,291 --> 00:53:09,416
You are safe.

543
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:11,458
My Holy Bible!

544
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:13,166
Jesus.

545
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,750
Why did you lead us down here
against my advice?

546
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,541
Are you trying to get us all killed?

547
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,083
You demon!

548
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:27,041
What more is to come?

549
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:28,791
Lord Perumal...

550
00:53:33,375 --> 00:53:34,833
Even lives are trite.

551
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:38,166
Steel your body, brother.

552
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,666
March ahead, brother.

553
00:53:42,791 --> 00:53:44,333
You are Satan.

554
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:47,916
He is Satan.

555
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:50,875
Enough.

556
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:53,250
It's alright, alright...

557
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,708
It's done. It's done.

558
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,708
Slowly, Grandpa.

559
00:53:56,958 --> 00:53:57,958
It's nothing.

560
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:00,875
Gather our belongings.

561
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:02,208
Let's get going.

562
00:54:02,458 --> 00:54:04,041
You are all demons.

563
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:23,458
Dad...

564
00:54:24,125 --> 00:54:26,583
The Elephant Hill from your tales.

565
00:54:28,125 --> 00:54:29,250
Is that it?

566
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,083
Lord...

567
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:44,875
The Kings of the past...

568
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,083
where they mined gold...

569
00:54:48,791 --> 00:54:51,375
those lands lie beyond that mountain.

570
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:52,958
Beyond it.

571
00:54:53,375 --> 00:54:54,750
Towards the Elephant Hill...

572
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:56,791
Go.

573
00:54:57,583 --> 00:54:58,708
We will find gold.

574
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:00,916
Hey. Hey, hey, hey...

575
00:55:02,458 --> 00:55:04,166
Do not speak.

576
00:55:05,416 --> 00:55:07,416
Do not open your mouth...

577
00:55:09,833 --> 00:55:11,916
until we depart from here.

578
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:15,291
Demon.

579
00:55:16,166 --> 00:55:18,625
Demon, do not mislead us.

580
00:55:23,666 --> 00:55:24,666
William...

581
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
what do you see?

582
00:55:26,625 --> 00:55:29,958
You see the rich vegetation
surrounded by parched lands?

583
00:55:30,958 --> 00:55:35,208
That means the land is mineral-rich.

584
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:36,958
Possibly gold.

585
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:40,000
Not only gold...

586
00:55:40,583 --> 00:55:44,375
But also silver, brass, copper and iron.

587
00:55:46,875 --> 00:55:49,250
However, gold will be found in abundance.

588
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:54,250
- It's only rocks!
- Hush, you fool...

589
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:57,541
The gold could be
concealed in the mud.

590
00:55:57,791 --> 00:56:00,250
You might uncover just a tiny fleck
when you break the rock.

591
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:02,291
It won't be easy to spot.

592
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,208
Centuries back, the Cholas and recently
Tipu Sultan mined gold from this region.

593
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:10,291
We are close, very close.

594
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,500
Less fire.

595
00:56:25,291 --> 00:56:26,833
Wages for our labour?

596
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,166
Wages, Lord...

597
00:56:28,458 --> 00:56:30,791
Pay... Pay me...

598
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:40,958
Keep yours.

599
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:49,333
Dig here.

600
00:56:52,125 --> 00:56:54,125
We dig in this area.

601
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:57,750
Hey... you!

602
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:59,083
What are you looking at?

603
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:00,458
Get working.

604
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:06,041
Lord,
the peacock will lead us to the gold.

605
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,625
It is known that gold will be
in abundance wherever it lands.

606
00:57:13,083 --> 00:57:15,750
Lord... this is the spot!
This is where the gold must be.

607
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:21,333
We will find it soon.

608
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:23,000
We will.

609
00:57:23,125 --> 00:57:25,000
Look at these flowers
glistening like gold.

610
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:28,083
If we dig around these flowers,
we'll find gold.

611
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:40,625
- Give it back, kid.
- Stop!

612
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:43,375
- It belongs to us.
- It's ours.

613
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:45,291
He got it!
You got it.

614
00:57:50,125 --> 00:57:51,125
Wow.

615
00:58:16,833 --> 00:58:17,708
Priest!

616
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:19,125
Priest, wait for me.

617
00:58:36,375 --> 00:58:37,500
Move! Put it out.

618
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,125
Why did you send me here, love?

619
00:58:48,416 --> 00:58:51,958
Can't you picture me, draped in gold?

620
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:53,833
Even the upper-caste women
would pale in comparison.

621
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,625
Doesn't it all seem
splendid just to imagine?

622
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:00,583
There's no gold or anything here, Arasani.

623
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:04,250
Come and take me home.

624
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:10,458
Lord Narayana, show us the path, man...

625
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:23,625
A tunnel!

626
00:59:25,291 --> 00:59:26,291
Lord...

627
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:28,875
I've found a tunnel
from the era of Cholas!

628
00:59:29,625 --> 00:59:30,625
We've found it!

629
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:46,083
Get down.

630
00:59:47,291 --> 00:59:49,458
Lord, this is not a tunnel...

631
00:59:50,041 --> 00:59:51,166
The saint's...

632
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:57,541
It's a lightning pit.

633
00:59:59,416 --> 01:00:02,083
Don't talk about things
you know nothing of.

634
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,166
I know for sure.

635
01:00:04,541 --> 01:00:06,333
- It's a tunnel from Chola period.
- Hey!

636
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:08,625
It's true, I'll prove it.

637
01:00:35,708 --> 01:00:37,541
Hey, what?

638
01:00:37,958 --> 01:00:40,000
- Nothing.
- Come on then.

639
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:45,375
Uncle, I found a head inside.

640
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:47,333
- I was scared shitless.
- Inside?

641
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:48,791
Lift me up.

642
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,749
- There is a head inside?
- Must be nothing.

643
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:51,958
Step aside.

644
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:55,000
Asoka! No! Hey...

645
01:00:55,291 --> 01:00:57,750
Are you out of your mind?
Don't you know what to keep from him?

646
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:07,833
Asoka!

647
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,541
A beast...

648
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:32,666
- It's a beast! Save me, Lord Perumal!
- Hey! Enough.

649
01:01:38,166 --> 01:01:40,125
Head of the Saint.

650
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:42,458
Our king...

651
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:44,250
Gold...

652
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:45,875
Gold...

653
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:48,166
Kill...

654
01:01:49,083 --> 01:01:50,125
King...

655
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:52,083
Gold... Kill...

656
01:02:18,666 --> 01:02:19,541
Shush!

657
01:02:20,416 --> 01:02:21,708
Scared-chicken...

658
01:02:22,333 --> 01:02:23,458
Quit being a crybaby.

659
01:02:23,625 --> 01:02:24,791
Shut your mouth, now.

660
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,208
Disrupting my sleep.

661
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:30,708
What is it to you?
You've lived a good life.

662
01:02:32,541 --> 01:02:35,083
I can't stop thinking
about my wife, Uncle.

663
01:02:36,416 --> 01:02:38,083
My heart feels heavy.

664
01:02:39,041 --> 01:02:41,125
The pain torments me.

665
01:02:42,666 --> 01:02:46,249
If only you'd let me, I'd just walk
through the wilderness and get home.

666
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:48,458
Why did you come then?

667
01:02:49,875 --> 01:02:52,791
I keep telling everyone that we must
break that head, but nobody listens.

668
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:54,625
Everything will be fine if we break it.

669
01:02:54,916 --> 01:02:58,041
Instead,
you go on about aborting the mission.

670
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:02,416
We are being controlled by demons here.

671
01:03:03,708 --> 01:03:07,625
Are you cognizant that this is
just a childish superstitious story?

672
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:11,208
Do you understand what I am saying?

673
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,958
I am not sure if what
he is saying is true.

674
01:03:18,833 --> 01:03:21,500
Let us look for this land
that he calls Elephant Hills.

675
01:03:23,041 --> 01:03:25,041
Perhaps we might find what we seek.

676
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:26,916
No, no...

677
01:03:27,958 --> 01:03:30,375
- I cannot accept this.
- Arthur!

678
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:35,625
I fear that this mission
will not be successful.

679
01:03:37,166 --> 01:03:39,458
My coffers are empty.

680
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:43,833
I cannot go back with nothing
to show for my endeavours.

681
01:03:45,666 --> 01:03:49,000
Even if fate is against us...

682
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:51,375
we will still prevail.

683
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:55,833
We will, Jesus is with us.

684
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,166
- But do not believe them.
- Jesus?

685
01:04:00,916 --> 01:04:01,833
Enough.

686
01:04:02,916 --> 01:04:03,875
Look at me.

687
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:07,500
Do I look like an
Englishman to you right now?

688
01:04:10,291 --> 01:04:13,166
What would be the fate of
my family when I am gone?

689
01:04:16,208 --> 01:04:19,500
Even these untouchable Indians...

690
01:04:19,916 --> 01:04:22,083
look at me with overbearing contempt.

691
01:04:25,583 --> 01:04:26,750
He may be right.

692
01:04:29,791 --> 01:04:30,833
We will follow him.

693
01:04:33,333 --> 01:04:34,458
He is my last hope.

694
01:04:35,916 --> 01:04:39,125
Are you intent upon
dooming yourself to hell?

695
01:04:40,791 --> 01:04:43,041
He is a demon. Look at him.

696
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:49,375
Even if the devil himself
were to show me the path...

697
01:04:50,708 --> 01:04:52,125
I would still follow him.

698
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:54,833
Arrant nonsense.

699
01:04:56,916 --> 01:04:57,916
Jesus.

700
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:04,500
Many kings were buried under this land.

701
01:05:05,416 --> 01:05:07,875
- Are the tales for real or mere myth?
- You.

702
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:12,541
Lead us.

703
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:18,333
Everyone, up.
We move out.

704
01:05:27,791 --> 01:05:30,208
Dad, we found the Saint's head here...

705
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,500
then the torso must
be somewhere nearby too, right?

706
01:05:33,083 --> 01:05:36,666
If we locate the torso,
we'll discover the gold, won't we?

707
01:05:37,666 --> 01:05:40,166
If we chance upon the
idol's head or torso...

708
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,458
it means a curse is upon all of this land.

709
01:05:43,041 --> 01:05:44,291
Do you know what this land is called?

710
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,333
The Satan's Wrath.

711
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:49,583
We need to shatter that
head and bury the pieces...

712
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,958
or else we'll face the Satan's wrath.

713
01:05:52,875 --> 01:05:54,416
Everyone, keep moving.

714
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:56,375
- Thangalaan, something's not right.
- Don't stop.

715
01:05:56,958 --> 01:05:58,791
Hear me out, hold on.

716
01:05:59,041 --> 01:06:01,750
Keep moving, don't stop.

717
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:05,416
Please don't venture ahead, listen to me.

718
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,958
Where the blackened rocks cry out...

719
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:15,750
and forests blister and burn.

720
01:06:16,583 --> 01:06:21,625
- Dark spirits quake beneath the earth.
- This land has incurred the Satan's wrath.

721
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:22,749
Destroy that.

722
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:25,291
A supercharged animal will
emerge amidst the dust.

723
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:31,000
No, no, no...

724
01:06:31,541 --> 01:06:32,540
Don't...

725
01:06:32,541 --> 01:06:37,625
Brother, this sprawling
blackened land is no ordinary land.

726
01:06:38,416 --> 01:06:40,041
It is the sacrificial
offering for my Satan.

727
01:06:41,375 --> 01:06:43,083
Sharpen your ears and listen closely.

728
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:46,708
You'll hear a tremble like the
screams of a thousand insects.

729
01:06:47,458 --> 01:06:50,458
The Saint's torso must be around here.

730
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:52,250
Come.

731
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:54,458
Oh my... you are Satan. The Satan himself.

732
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:57,625
- Yes, this man is actually right.
- I won't come.

733
01:06:57,791 --> 01:06:59,958
And not that dark spirit.

734
01:07:00,333 --> 01:07:01,500
No!

735
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:04,791
Stop, you demon.

736
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:06,915
- Hey, stop.
- Stop.

737
01:07:06,916 --> 01:07:08,833
You stop...

738
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:12,041
or I will put a bullet
into your dark heart.

739
01:07:14,125 --> 01:07:15,583
Lower your bloody gun...

740
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:18,000
or I will put a bullet in yours.

741
01:07:18,416 --> 01:07:21,583
Clement, listen to me.
This time, listen...

742
01:07:44,041 --> 01:07:45,000
- Hey!
- Ouch!

743
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:48,166
Hey!

744
01:07:50,916 --> 01:07:53,708
Run, everyone. Hurry.

745
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:54,958
Run!

746
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:57,666
Careful, uncle.

747
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:17,875
Hey, Thangalaan.

748
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:27,041
Come on, now.

749
01:08:29,708 --> 01:08:35,166
Hey!

750
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:40,291
Kid... stop.

751
01:08:41,125 --> 01:08:42,125
Thangalaan!

752
01:08:57,666 --> 01:08:59,208
Uncle, careful.

753
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:01,791
- Oh no!
- Get up, Dad.

754
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,041
Get up!

755
01:09:07,041 --> 01:09:09,041
- Asoka, careful.
- Watch out, Asoka.

756
01:09:09,416 --> 01:09:10,875
Go on, shoot.

757
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:14,458
Uncle, get up.

758
01:09:14,958 --> 01:09:15,875
Uncle!

759
01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:22,791
Oh, no. Watch out, uncle.

760
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:24,375
Dad!

761
01:09:40,666 --> 01:09:42,000
I knew this would happen.

762
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:44,541
The devil has shown its true colours.

763
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:46,916
Look at me.
Look at me, Clement.

764
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:48,625
Now do you see him for who he is?

765
01:09:49,166 --> 01:09:50,750
We are almost there.

766
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:52,500
I am going to kill you.

767
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:56,708
Thangalaan, you are a beast.

768
01:09:57,166 --> 01:09:58,250
Let's move ahead.

769
01:09:59,416 --> 01:10:01,208
- Arthur...
- Demon!

770
01:10:01,416 --> 01:10:03,041
You shot my father?

771
01:10:03,708 --> 01:10:05,041
- Asoka, don't!
- Hey!

772
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:08,041
- Move!
- It is all your doing.

773
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:11,541
Don't you get it? Listen to me.

774
01:10:14,291 --> 01:10:15,333
Asoka...

775
01:10:15,541 --> 01:10:17,416
- Ashoka!
- Move! Move away.

776
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,125
- Don't run.
- I'll kill you.

777
01:10:22,291 --> 01:10:24,375
Hey, priest.
Where are you running to?

778
01:10:27,125 --> 01:10:29,125
Run past the Elephant Hill.

779
01:10:37,708 --> 01:10:38,833
Get back.

780
01:10:58,958 --> 01:11:00,166
Uncle...

781
01:11:00,791 --> 01:11:01,791
March ahead.

782
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:18,750
You descendant of a wayward clan.

783
01:11:21,458 --> 01:11:23,083
I want gold.

784
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:25,333
What do you seek in return?

785
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:54,416
What are you doing here?

786
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:07,166
A hand!

787
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:10,250
Lord, look it is the hand.

788
01:12:11,416 --> 01:12:13,416
- It is the Saint's hand. Dad...
- Now...

789
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:17,166
- Dad, the hand is over here.
- It is time to die.

790
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:27,999
Oh no, dad.

791
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,250
- Dad.
- Asoka...

792
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,833
Dad, the saint...
the saint's hand...

793
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:35,375
- What are you saying?
- The Lord.

794
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:38,458
- Dad... the Saint's hand.
- Wait, wait...

795
01:12:38,625 --> 01:12:40,875
As I unearthed the Saint's hand,
someone struck down the White man.

796
01:12:41,375 --> 01:12:42,290
He fell down.

797
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:43,250
Arthur.

798
01:12:43,375 --> 01:12:46,500
- Arthur, wake up.
- There are people all around us, Uncle.

799
01:12:46,833 --> 01:12:50,000
They are all around us.
I am really scared, Dad.

800
01:12:51,125 --> 01:12:53,458
- Watch out. It is the Satan.
- Priest!

801
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:56,291
William, stay back.

802
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:01,750
Hey, come over here.

803
01:13:02,041 --> 01:13:03,541
Take it.

804
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:07,208
Cover that side.

805
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:10,875
You can see the pit, covered up with sand.

806
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:14,208
You can hear life stirring within it.

807
01:13:14,541 --> 01:13:15,833
Hey, brother...

808
01:13:16,083 --> 01:13:20,541
the guns on our backs
push us into bottomless pits...

809
01:13:20,875 --> 01:13:25,083
but the shooter aiming at our
hearts doesn't know the truth.

810
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:27,375
This isn't just a body, it's gold.

811
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,166
Narayana!

812
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:17,791
The scent of bad omen is thick in the air.

813
01:14:18,833 --> 01:14:21,916
Bones buried deep inside
rise from under the earth...

814
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:25,166
I sense them coiling around my
ankles, tightening their grip on me.

815
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,083
Come on, brother.

816
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:40,083
Rise and fight bravely so the
darkness in our life may retreat.

817
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:47,333
There's no sin nor
virtue on the battlefield.

818
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:57,916
The moment is ripe to settle our scores.

819
01:15:59,333 --> 01:16:03,750
I will defeat this formidable woman
before my boiling blood turns cold.

820
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:48,333
Turn up the heat.

821
01:16:48,791 --> 01:16:50,750
Throw in some more firewood.

822
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:53,291
Damn... rain.

823
01:16:54,458 --> 01:16:56,375
- Hurry up.
- Make it quick.

824
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:02,166
Is it there?

825
01:17:03,875 --> 01:17:05,041
What do you see?

826
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:11,208
Gold!

827
01:17:13,291 --> 01:17:14,583
Gold!

828
01:17:15,541 --> 01:17:18,500
- Gold.
- Jesus, finally, we've found it.

829
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:21,250
- It is gold.
- Hey, shut it now.

830
01:17:24,708 --> 01:17:27,458
Son, be careful.

831
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:34,000
Uncle, get over here.

832
01:17:34,375 --> 01:17:35,875
Run.
Hurry.

833
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:41,875
No, William!

834
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,708
No!

835
01:17:46,666 --> 01:17:48,416
No!

836
01:18:18,458 --> 01:18:19,708
This Earth has taken you.

837
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:24,333
But in return...

838
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,833
it has given us gold.

839
01:18:29,708 --> 01:18:30,833
This is you, William.

840
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:32,833
This is you.

841
01:18:36,875 --> 01:18:37,833
Thank you.

842
01:18:38,708 --> 01:18:41,625
What are you still doing?
Let's leave.

843
01:18:41,916 --> 01:18:43,291
What's done is done.

844
01:18:43,666 --> 01:18:47,083
Let's help them gather the gold,
take our share, and leave, priest.

845
01:18:47,208 --> 01:18:50,041
No, just listen to me.

846
01:18:50,166 --> 01:18:52,250
Let's go back home to safety.

847
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,708
Lord, we are departing.

848
01:18:55,916 --> 01:18:56,916
Let's just leave.

849
01:18:58,541 --> 01:18:59,625
Lord.

850
01:19:06,833 --> 01:19:07,791
Take it.

851
01:19:12,125 --> 01:19:13,125
Thanga...

852
01:19:15,291 --> 01:19:19,583
...you are a truly worthy man.

853
01:19:21,416 --> 01:19:22,291
I...

854
01:19:23,333 --> 01:19:24,958
am grateful to you.

855
01:19:30,666 --> 01:19:32,666
This, to me...

856
01:19:34,041 --> 01:19:36,000
Is of paramount importance.

857
01:19:37,833 --> 01:19:38,708
Now...

858
01:19:39,791 --> 01:19:43,708
we can show the world who we are.

859
01:19:47,125 --> 01:19:48,083
We've found gold, man.

860
01:19:48,541 --> 01:19:49,833
We've made history!

861
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:51,833
History!

862
01:19:54,416 --> 01:19:57,291
Your life is about to change.

863
01:20:00,291 --> 01:20:01,666
All your lives...

864
01:20:02,166 --> 01:20:04,625
your mothers, fathers...

865
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:06,333
your children...

866
01:20:06,708 --> 01:20:08,375
is about to move up.

867
01:20:10,208 --> 01:20:11,875
And everyone will look at you all...

868
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,583
with respect.

869
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:17,250
You wear these.

870
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:19,375
Wear.

871
01:20:28,041 --> 01:20:32,375
Arthur, Thangalaan and I
will return with more money and men.

872
01:20:33,125 --> 01:20:34,750
You're in charge until then.

873
01:20:35,708 --> 01:20:38,583
Until then, all of you
keep up your good work.

874
01:20:50,333 --> 01:20:51,665
Look, a horse!

875
01:20:51,666 --> 01:20:52,958
Mind your job.

876
01:21:05,583 --> 01:21:07,207
Is that Dad?

877
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:08,291
Indeed, it is.

878
01:21:40,458 --> 01:21:41,291
Gangamma...

879
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:44,666
- Hey!
- Hey!

880
01:21:45,125 --> 01:21:46,000
What?

881
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:51,290
- Have you returned, my lord?
- Get up.

882
01:21:51,291 --> 01:21:52,458
My dearest!

883
01:21:54,333 --> 01:21:56,041
The moment I saw your face...

884
01:21:56,208 --> 01:21:58,540
my dwindling life surged back alive.

885
01:21:58,541 --> 01:22:00,458
Shut up. Get up, now.

886
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:03,125
What is wrong?
Come on now.

887
01:22:03,583 --> 01:22:06,625
I feel like I've risen
from my own grave.

888
01:22:07,041 --> 01:22:08,916
Listen to yourself, woman.
What do you mean?

889
01:22:09,375 --> 01:22:11,458
All I could think of was you
the whole time I was away.

890
01:22:11,958 --> 01:22:13,749
My Kaniya!

891
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:15,540
What is up, my boy?

892
01:22:15,541 --> 01:22:17,582
Where is my son?
Where is he?

893
01:22:17,583 --> 01:22:20,000
Your son is safe and sound
over there. Don't worry.

894
01:22:20,333 --> 01:22:22,208
- Arasani, get over here.
- My girls!

895
01:22:25,041 --> 01:22:26,000
My precious girls.

896
01:22:26,666 --> 01:22:29,291
You're strutting around
like an English Lord.

897
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:30,958
- Doesn't it look great?
- Yes, it does.

898
01:22:34,041 --> 01:22:35,750
Hold on, I'll just come.

899
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:40,291
So, book-keeper...

900
01:22:46,041 --> 01:22:48,083
No, don't do it.

901
01:22:55,875 --> 01:22:56,916
Don't you dare come close...

902
01:23:03,916 --> 01:23:05,791
Get over here, book-keeper.

903
01:23:07,166 --> 01:23:09,208
- Thangalaan, what are you doing?
- Stay out of this.

904
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:16,250
Count it.

905
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:24,583
The amount...

906
01:23:25,958 --> 01:23:28,500
The amount seems to be right.

907
01:23:28,833 --> 01:23:32,166
But you still owe the landlord 31 rupees.

908
01:23:33,083 --> 01:23:35,291
- You need to pay that.
- On what grounds?

909
01:23:35,833 --> 01:23:38,041
Is it some sort of interest or tax?

910
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:43,583
How do you account for the lifelong
labour of me and my entire family?

911
01:23:47,125 --> 01:23:50,291
Listen up, return my deed.

912
01:23:53,041 --> 01:23:53,875
Hand it over.

913
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:43,375
Uncle...

914
01:24:44,875 --> 01:24:48,500
My husband, the poor dear,
is such a scared-cat.

915
01:24:48,916 --> 01:24:52,374
I constantly worry about
where he is and how he's doing.

916
01:24:52,375 --> 01:24:53,958
He's fine, dear.

917
01:24:54,375 --> 01:24:55,666
He eats his fill...

918
01:24:56,333 --> 01:24:57,625
...he works like a mule.

919
01:24:58,416 --> 01:25:00,208
He talks about you all the time.

920
01:25:01,208 --> 01:25:06,041
"Arasani is so fond of gold.
She likes it so dearly."

921
01:25:07,041 --> 01:25:11,791
He's always talking about buying you
jewels, with a sparkle in his eye.

922
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:14,208
Is there gold really?

923
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:16,540
Are you seriously
asking me if there is gold?

924
01:25:16,541 --> 01:25:20,250
Arasani, they've found the gold.

925
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:22,291
All that's left is to dig it up.

926
01:25:22,875 --> 01:25:26,958
He's here, dressed like a Lord,
to recruit people for the job.

927
01:25:27,541 --> 01:25:30,916
Be wary, you might think he's
back out of love for his family.

928
01:25:31,416 --> 01:25:34,749
Watch her grinding Thangalaan
to shreds while grinding meat.

929
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:36,957
- Oh, woman...
- That's exactly right, Uncle.

930
01:25:36,958 --> 01:25:38,000
Uncle...

931
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:40,083
Last night I saw my
father in my dream again.

932
01:25:40,416 --> 01:25:41,291
A nightmare.

933
01:25:41,541 --> 01:25:42,791
I was so scared.

934
01:25:42,916 --> 01:25:44,540
Why hasn't my father
returned yet?

935
01:25:44,541 --> 01:25:47,833
Your father's guarding
all that gold, dear.

936
01:25:48,125 --> 01:25:49,250
Why fret?

937
01:25:49,791 --> 01:25:51,250
We'll go see him, okay?

938
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:54,582
Brother,
did my father send anything for me?

939
01:25:54,583 --> 01:25:58,750
Your father Muniyan always thinks
long and hard before he speaks.

940
01:25:59,791 --> 01:26:03,083
I knew it'd be forever before
he spoke a word, so I rushed back.

941
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:06,040
Did you hear that, woman?

942
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:07,958
You're all amazed by this story?

943
01:26:08,416 --> 01:26:09,916
There's so much more.

944
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:12,916
Doesn't matter if
it's a lord or whoever...

945
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:15,458
I'll ensure you get your
wages once the job is done.

946
01:26:15,625 --> 01:26:17,416
That's our Thangalaan!

947
01:26:18,416 --> 01:26:23,250
You're the one who dangled
the landlord by his hair.

948
01:26:24,041 --> 01:26:25,915
The way you rode in on a horse...

949
01:26:25,916 --> 01:26:27,208
and threw the money at his face!

950
01:26:27,458 --> 01:26:28,333
Wow!

951
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,708
I've never seen a miracle quite like that.

952
01:26:31,125 --> 01:26:33,291
True, these English lords
stand no chance against you.

953
01:26:33,666 --> 01:26:37,000
That's all fine, Thangalaan,
but what is the purpose of this?

954
01:26:37,416 --> 01:26:38,791
Why don't you cut to the chase?

955
01:26:38,958 --> 01:26:39,875
What?

956
01:26:40,458 --> 01:26:44,625
Why do they seek us out when there
are millions of people in this land?

957
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:47,332
Because we can work through rain or shine,

958
01:26:47,333 --> 01:26:50,208
battle dark forces and
retrieve the gold, yeah?

959
01:26:50,916 --> 01:26:54,208
No one but us can do
this job in this land.

960
01:26:54,875 --> 01:26:56,999
So you're here to march us to our doom.

961
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,708
What kind of life are you leading now?

962
01:27:01,125 --> 01:27:04,250
You are bound to toil like beasts.

963
01:27:05,875 --> 01:27:09,791
Endlessly cultivating
all kinds of grains...

964
01:27:10,125 --> 01:27:11,750
doing all of the farming...

965
01:27:12,208 --> 01:27:15,875
but can you bring even
a handful of grain home?

966
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:18,958
Isn't this our land?

967
01:27:20,958 --> 01:27:23,333
Yet do any of us own even a small patch?

968
01:27:23,625 --> 01:27:25,333
Even if we do, why do they
snatch it from us?

969
01:27:25,958 --> 01:27:28,708
The land is ours,
the labour is ours...

970
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:30,833
yet they don't even pay
us our rightful wages.

971
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:34,625
If our children are also
doomed to be born as slaves...

972
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:37,375
what's the point of this life?

973
01:27:37,541 --> 01:27:39,040
Are you saying things
will change if we go there?

974
01:27:39,041 --> 01:27:39,958
Yes, it will change.

975
01:27:41,375 --> 01:27:42,625
Didn't you all see for yourselves?

976
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:46,541
Today, my piece of land is mine.

977
01:27:47,958 --> 01:27:49,000
Understand?

978
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:52,041
What? Have you forgotten already?

979
01:27:52,708 --> 01:27:54,875
Weren't you the one warning us
about ghosts and monsters there?

980
01:27:55,875 --> 01:27:59,208
Now you're pitching grand ideas,
calling us there.

981
01:27:59,791 --> 01:28:02,958
Woman, do you not venture into the
fields at night to safeguard the crops?

982
01:28:04,041 --> 01:28:05,916
Do you not manage the
watering in the dark?

983
01:28:06,958 --> 01:28:08,958
What if we stayed holed
up out of fear of the dark?

984
01:28:10,125 --> 01:28:12,000
You can't live
if you're afraid of dying.

985
01:28:14,541 --> 01:28:15,375
Look...

986
01:28:16,166 --> 01:28:18,208
I'm not saying
we'll live like royalty there.

987
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:22,291
But rather than die under those who
discriminate us based on our birth...

988
01:28:22,583 --> 01:28:25,458
it's better to die trying to change it.

989
01:28:29,125 --> 01:28:31,583
Know what the
Englishman has planned for us?

990
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:35,458
Houses. Schools, like ones
the landlord's kids attend...

991
01:28:35,916 --> 01:28:39,375
decent wages, and clothes,
like the one I'm wearing.

992
01:28:39,625 --> 01:28:41,625
- Isn't that enough?
- Scram, will you?

993
01:28:41,958 --> 01:28:44,833
It all sounds nice, but is it feasible?

994
01:28:45,125 --> 01:28:48,416
Say, we agree to go,
would the landlord just let us?

995
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:49,625
What?

996
01:28:50,208 --> 01:28:53,000
The Englishman has given it
in writing with his stamp.

997
01:28:54,125 --> 01:28:56,208
Let's see who dares to
defy the Whites and hold us back.

998
01:28:58,125 --> 01:28:59,041
See this?

999
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:06,125
Are we just going to sit here
in our rags, rotting away?

1000
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:10,375
Or get educated like the Whites,
wear these shirts...

1001
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:11,958
and hold power?

1002
01:29:15,416 --> 01:29:16,291
Listen up.

1003
01:29:16,958 --> 01:29:20,166
Gold will change our lives.

1004
01:29:21,041 --> 01:29:21,875
That's all.

1005
01:29:24,666 --> 01:29:27,000
Still on about it, woman?

1006
01:29:27,458 --> 01:29:30,083
Give everyone the sweets I brought.

1007
01:29:30,625 --> 01:29:33,958
Don't you have hands?
Can't you do it yourself?

1008
01:29:34,416 --> 01:29:36,041
Thinks he can show off,
in his fancy outfit...

1009
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:43,916
Mate, here! Have some.

1010
01:29:47,875 --> 01:29:50,041
Arasani, hand it out to everyone.

1011
01:29:51,583 --> 01:29:54,291
- Did everyone get some?
- Move...

1012
01:29:55,125 --> 01:29:56,041
Here, here.

1013
01:30:00,541 --> 01:30:01,458
Hey.

1014
01:30:02,166 --> 01:30:03,833
- The thing you asked for...
- What?

1015
01:30:04,166 --> 01:30:05,125
A dress.

1016
01:30:08,166 --> 01:30:09,833
- Is it for me?
- Who else?

1017
01:30:11,166 --> 01:30:12,541
What's this?

1018
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:14,291
Is it a woman's dress?

1019
01:30:15,125 --> 01:30:16,707
- Hey, hey...
- Hold on.

1020
01:30:16,708 --> 01:30:18,750
There's one for everyone, no squabbling.

1021
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:23,540
Look at this, Arasani.

1022
01:30:23,541 --> 01:30:25,791
How do we put it on?

1023
01:30:26,291 --> 01:30:28,124
- How?
- Not that way, I guess.

1024
01:30:28,125 --> 01:30:29,374
Mom, what about me?

1025
01:30:29,375 --> 01:30:31,707
Your father has got one
for everyone. Ask him.

1026
01:30:31,708 --> 01:30:32,750
Like this?

1027
01:30:39,416 --> 01:30:41,666
- Looks nice, doesn't it?
- It's lovely.

1028
01:30:44,416 --> 01:30:45,500
Come on, ladies.
Let's step out.

1029
01:30:45,708 --> 01:30:46,833
Here, look.

1030
01:30:50,666 --> 01:30:52,208
Take a look!

1031
01:30:53,208 --> 01:30:54,416
How does it look?

1032
01:30:54,666 --> 01:30:56,915
Look at you, sister.
You've aged backwards.

1033
01:30:56,916 --> 01:30:59,500
Feels like it's being held upright, yeah?

1034
01:31:00,041 --> 01:31:01,708
- Feels less heavy now, eh?
- Exactly!

1035
01:31:04,333 --> 01:31:05,875
How do I look, husband?

1036
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,374
- Hey, what's this?
- What?

1037
01:31:10,375 --> 01:31:11,958
Take it off.
Off with it.

1038
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:15,000
If you keep it hidden away,
how will you feed my kids?

1039
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,500
Oh, goodness.

1040
01:31:18,041 --> 01:31:21,750
So concerned about his
children getting their milk.

1041
01:31:22,458 --> 01:31:24,875
I'm her first child, dear.

1042
01:31:33,333 --> 01:31:36,833
"You sweet bird... You colourful bird"

1043
01:31:37,083 --> 01:31:40,874
"Sweet, colourful bird...
So elegant her moves, this dancing bird"

1044
01:31:40,875 --> 01:31:44,208
"Every step like lightning...
She came and stood before him"

1045
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:48,332
"And our dear uncle is left blushing,
look how he's swooning"

1046
01:31:48,333 --> 01:31:52,124
"All dolled up, look
at her shimmering,

1047
01:31:52,125 --> 01:31:55,874
when she walks tall,
how he's simmering"

1048
01:31:55,875 --> 01:31:59,707
"All stirred up,
look at her light,

1049
01:31:59,708 --> 01:32:03,541
when she's gleaming,
it's quite the sight"

1050
01:32:20,541 --> 01:32:24,249
"With a newfound bliss...
Water in the stream glints"

1051
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:28,082
"With naughty eyes
watching... The little bird bathes"

1052
01:32:28,083 --> 01:32:31,832
"With our uncle feigning work,
his headscarf comes undone"

1053
01:32:31,833 --> 01:32:35,665
"With the pretty flower
teasing to give in just a little bit"

1054
01:32:35,666 --> 01:32:37,749
"When facing this fierce female,

1055
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:43,207
why do my eyes
behave as if bewitched?"

1056
01:32:43,208 --> 01:32:47,541
"He follows you
everywhere crazy in love..."

1057
01:32:50,791 --> 01:32:54,540
"All dolled up, look
at her shimmering,

1058
01:32:54,541 --> 01:32:58,207
when she walks tall,
how he's simmering"

1059
01:32:58,208 --> 01:33:02,040
"All stirred up,
look at her light,

1060
01:33:02,041 --> 01:33:05,916
when she's gleaming,
it's quite the sight"

1061
01:33:22,875 --> 01:33:26,624
"Inquisitive eyes five or six...
Scrutinise her with a smile transfixed"

1062
01:33:26,625 --> 01:33:30,415
"The cattle and sheep are taken aback.
Dumbfounded, they just gawk"

1063
01:33:30,416 --> 01:33:34,207
"All the scarecrows on the
cornfield are all putting on airs"

1064
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:38,040
"Even the nonchalant crows are
entranced by my sister's blouse"

1065
01:33:38,041 --> 01:33:41,790
"The clouds are ganging
up won't they pour for us?"

1066
01:33:41,791 --> 01:33:45,582
"We've bottled up much despair
won't they dissolve in the air?"

1067
01:33:45,583 --> 01:33:50,708
"While our 'parai'
drums resound dance and rejoice!"

1068
01:33:53,125 --> 01:33:56,874
"All dolled up, look
at her shimmering,

1069
01:33:56,875 --> 01:34:00,582
when she walks tall,
how he's simmering"

1070
01:34:00,583 --> 01:34:04,374
"All stirred up,
look at her light

1071
01:34:04,375 --> 01:34:08,041
when she's gleaming,
it's quite the sight"

1072
01:34:24,583 --> 01:34:25,958
How dare they?

1073
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:28,708
Who gave them the
right to leave the village?

1074
01:34:29,458 --> 01:34:31,958
If they leave,
who'd do the work here?

1075
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:34,250
Apparently,
the Englishman has put it in writing.

1076
01:34:34,458 --> 01:34:36,000
Defying it would be anti-national.

1077
01:34:36,375 --> 01:34:37,874
We can't do anything, Master.

1078
01:34:37,875 --> 01:34:40,416
Or they'll revoke our
taxation rights, landlord.

1079
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:06,750
Get it done with.

1080
01:35:30,333 --> 01:35:34,000
What a nightmare.
Not a drop of water in such a big stream?

1081
01:35:34,208 --> 01:35:36,625
Oh, I wonder what else awaits us.

1082
01:35:36,875 --> 01:35:39,416
Goddess Gangamma, you show mercy on us!

1083
01:35:49,416 --> 01:35:51,166
Hey, get over here.

1084
01:35:54,541 --> 01:35:57,416
Seize that donkey from him.

1085
01:35:58,291 --> 01:35:59,416
And the gun on his shoulder.

1086
01:36:02,125 --> 01:36:04,041
You people are to move
and settle in over there.

1087
01:36:04,458 --> 01:36:07,540
You'll be provided with rice and
pulses. Don't come back here.

1088
01:36:07,541 --> 01:36:08,625
Head straight over there.

1089
01:36:08,833 --> 01:36:10,375
- I'm off to see the lord.
- Halt!

1090
01:36:11,458 --> 01:36:13,916
Out of the way, idiot.

1091
01:36:14,958 --> 01:36:18,291
Think you're an envoy for
the British Viceroy, huh?

1092
01:36:18,625 --> 01:36:21,291
Go and sort out the people you've brought.

1093
01:36:21,458 --> 01:36:23,333
Wants to see the lord, he says. Scram.

1094
01:36:24,291 --> 01:36:25,208
Go.

1095
01:36:26,708 --> 01:36:27,625
Go away.

1096
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:35,750
If the Lord had seen me,
he would've rushed right over.

1097
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,916
Seems like he's tied up.
Alright, keep moving.

1098
01:36:39,416 --> 01:36:40,500
My husband!

1099
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:41,832
Dad!

1100
01:36:41,833 --> 01:36:43,750
Arasani! My love!

1101
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:46,916
Oh, Arasani!

1102
01:36:50,666 --> 01:36:51,666
What's all this?

1103
01:36:55,958 --> 01:36:58,375
Why did you come, child?
Who brought you here?

1104
01:36:58,833 --> 01:37:01,332
I told them not to!

1105
01:37:01,333 --> 01:37:02,458
Where is Asoka?

1106
01:37:02,708 --> 01:37:04,625
Varadha, where is Asoka?
Asoka!

1107
01:37:05,208 --> 01:37:06,874
Asoka?

1108
01:37:06,875 --> 01:37:09,165
Strange things went down
when you were away, Uncle.

1109
01:37:09,166 --> 01:37:10,082
What?

1110
01:37:10,083 --> 01:37:13,125
That Lord Clement you keep
gushing about...

1111
01:37:13,541 --> 01:37:18,958
he brought those guards and
gunned down the Nagas of the hills, Uncle.

1112
01:37:33,541 --> 01:37:36,500
Elderly, children -they spared
no one. They stabbed them all.

1113
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:41,291
The poor people ran,
scared out of their wits.

1114
01:37:41,541 --> 01:37:43,416
But one old man got caught.

1115
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,458
Asoka has been acting strange
ever since he heard that man's wailing.

1116
01:37:53,125 --> 01:37:56,791
Poor child keeps looking up,
looking down, then this way and that.

1117
01:37:57,541 --> 01:37:58,458
Where is he?

1118
01:37:59,125 --> 01:38:01,333
- Since he hit the guards--
- What?

1119
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:04,790
- they beat him up real bad, Uncle.
- What?

1120
01:38:04,791 --> 01:38:06,540
I couldn't do a thing, Uncle.

1121
01:38:06,541 --> 01:38:07,499
What are you saying?

1122
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:09,333
Where is he?
Asoka.

1123
01:38:09,541 --> 01:38:10,416
Where is Asoka?

1124
01:38:10,958 --> 01:38:12,291
Answer me.
Where is he?

1125
01:38:14,666 --> 01:38:16,041
Asoka, my boy.

1126
01:38:16,416 --> 01:38:17,541
My child, my dear boy...

1127
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:22,166
Wake up, son.
Open your eyes.

1128
01:38:24,083 --> 01:38:25,083
Asoka!

1129
01:38:25,208 --> 01:38:27,375
Lord, will you look at my boy?

1130
01:38:34,041 --> 01:38:35,458
Sir, please spare my child.

1131
01:38:37,375 --> 01:38:38,458
That's my son!

1132
01:38:39,375 --> 01:38:41,958
What are you staring at?
Break his bones.

1133
01:38:42,083 --> 01:38:43,083
Hit him.

1134
01:38:51,833 --> 01:38:54,000
Step back, back!

1135
01:38:54,125 --> 01:38:55,916
First rip those English clothes off him.

1136
01:38:56,250 --> 01:38:57,083
Go!

1137
01:39:08,458 --> 01:39:09,625
Oh, dear.

1138
01:39:15,541 --> 01:39:16,500
Lord!

1139
01:39:19,833 --> 01:39:21,583
Enough. Step away.

1140
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:28,416
Lord.

1141
01:39:29,041 --> 01:39:31,291
Lord, look at my boy.

1142
01:39:32,166 --> 01:39:33,500
They have thrashed him, Lord.

1143
01:39:34,291 --> 01:39:36,166
I've never laid a hand on my boy.

1144
01:39:39,291 --> 01:39:40,416
They've torn away my clothes, Lord.

1145
01:39:41,125 --> 01:39:43,958
I am deeply sorry,
Thangalaan. Deeply sorry.

1146
01:39:44,541 --> 01:39:45,458
Kailasam...

1147
01:39:45,666 --> 01:39:47,249
- Release this boy.
- Sir...

1148
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:48,166
Do it.

1149
01:39:48,833 --> 01:39:49,833
Asoka...

1150
01:39:50,458 --> 01:39:51,541
He is not in good health.

1151
01:39:52,291 --> 01:39:54,833
- Give him all the assistance he needs.
- Yes, sir.

1152
01:39:56,833 --> 01:39:58,833
- Brother...
- Asoka!

1153
01:39:59,458 --> 01:40:01,791
Kailasam, look after the labourers.

1154
01:40:02,375 --> 01:40:03,541
Make sure they settle.

1155
01:40:04,125 --> 01:40:06,041
It's okay...

1156
01:40:07,666 --> 01:40:08,958
These are my people, Lord.

1157
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,583
I've bought them all here, at your behest.

1158
01:40:12,833 --> 01:40:14,958
My thanks to you all.

1159
01:40:17,291 --> 01:40:18,166
We...

1160
01:40:18,875 --> 01:40:20,625
are creating history...

1161
01:40:21,583 --> 01:40:22,625
...at this time.

1162
01:40:25,875 --> 01:40:28,000
You all have rights...

1163
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:30,666
over the gold that we mine.

1164
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:34,958
But it is Thangalaan...

1165
01:40:36,375 --> 01:40:37,833
that you need to thank for this.

1166
01:40:39,833 --> 01:40:42,250
He is a truly remarkable man...

1167
01:40:42,708 --> 01:40:46,583
...who has restored
pride to your community.

1168
01:40:46,875 --> 01:40:49,291
May all you be safe
in your endeavours.

1169
01:40:53,791 --> 01:40:54,666
Yes, sir.

1170
01:41:00,083 --> 01:41:01,083
The Lord says...

1171
01:41:03,458 --> 01:41:05,166
You are my slaves.

1172
01:41:08,166 --> 01:41:09,083
Wage labourers.

1173
01:41:11,375 --> 01:41:13,416
- Mind your jobs.
- No...

1174
01:41:14,666 --> 01:41:17,125
He is twisting the Lord's words.
That is not what he said.

1175
01:41:19,208 --> 01:41:20,916
We are going to create history here.

1176
01:41:22,583 --> 01:41:26,125
We all have rights over
the gold we find here. Yes.

1177
01:41:28,708 --> 01:41:30,000
Our futures will be bright.

1178
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:31,625
Thangalaan...

1179
01:41:32,333 --> 01:41:33,750
it's all thanks to me.

1180
01:41:34,458 --> 01:41:35,708
That's what the Lord said.

1181
01:41:36,333 --> 01:41:37,249
And also...

1182
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:39,500
he apologised for them hitting me.

1183
01:41:41,625 --> 01:41:43,166
Take your belongings.

1184
01:41:43,291 --> 01:41:44,749
Let's go to our stay.

1185
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:47,332
The Lord seems to have
such respect for Thangalaan.

1186
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:48,291
Indeed, Uncle.

1187
01:42:12,625 --> 01:42:14,541
Tonight,
I will satiate all of my cravings.

1188
01:42:16,708 --> 01:42:17,750
Don't cry!

1189
01:42:21,083 --> 01:42:25,208
The white man has held on to
the monster's idol despite my warnings.

1190
01:42:25,333 --> 01:42:27,750
I was desperate to see you, Dad.

1191
01:42:28,333 --> 01:42:31,791
But now I'm terrified
of all that I'm hearing.

1192
01:42:32,416 --> 01:42:36,916
The Lord promised us a portion of the gold
we discover here, okay?

1193
01:42:37,333 --> 01:42:42,333
Let's collect it, finish the construction
of Lord Perumal's temple...

1194
01:42:43,541 --> 01:42:47,166
and convert all the slum-dwellers to
follow Ramanujam's teachings, okay?

1195
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:49,625
Then who'll dare label us low born?

1196
01:42:53,083 --> 01:42:55,708
Why do you keep
staring at the dress?

1197
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,708
Didn't those guards stain and tear it?

1198
01:42:59,791 --> 01:43:02,041
You acted like an English lord.

1199
01:43:02,875 --> 01:43:04,208
They couldn't stand to see it.

1200
01:43:05,666 --> 01:43:08,833
"How could he stand as our equal,
like a respectable man?"

1201
01:43:09,583 --> 01:43:10,541
They just can't take it.

1202
01:43:12,541 --> 01:43:15,250
Anyway, stop dwelling on it.
Throw it aside and come.

1203
01:43:19,791 --> 01:43:22,750
Hey, why is our boy acting strange?

1204
01:43:25,166 --> 01:43:26,208
Something doesn't feel right.

1205
01:43:29,833 --> 01:43:31,957
You're keeping secrets from me.

1206
01:43:31,958 --> 01:43:33,208
What are you implying?

1207
01:43:36,416 --> 01:43:38,833
Don't worry, just trust me.

1208
01:43:45,791 --> 01:43:49,541
Why haven't you left this place
where death is certain?

1209
01:43:51,916 --> 01:43:55,000
Why linger here?
Leave at once.

1210
01:43:56,208 --> 01:43:57,625
You are making a mistake.

1211
01:44:01,333 --> 01:44:03,708
Gold is a treacherous ghost.

1212
01:44:04,875 --> 01:44:06,375
It will kill you.

1213
01:44:07,458 --> 01:44:09,041
It will kill you all.

1214
01:44:09,875 --> 01:44:12,750
Go, warn everyone.

1215
01:44:12,916 --> 01:44:15,791
Tell them to leave this place at once.

1216
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:22,750
Shut up!

1217
01:44:23,458 --> 01:44:24,291
Stop blabbering.

1218
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:29,083
Give that.

1219
01:44:38,541 --> 01:44:40,541
Hey, what are you thinking?

1220
01:44:41,291 --> 01:44:42,458
Why are you just standing transfixed?

1221
01:44:48,875 --> 01:44:50,999
We've overcome many dangers,
why let this faze us?

1222
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,332
Come on, now.

1223
01:44:52,333 --> 01:44:53,875
- We are here now, let's get to work.
- These are my workers.

1224
01:44:58,916 --> 01:44:59,750
Thangalaan.

1225
01:45:01,041 --> 01:45:01,875
Let us begin.

1226
01:45:05,083 --> 01:45:05,916
Come on.

1227
01:45:06,333 --> 01:45:08,166
Get to work,
what are you gaping at?

1228
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:12,457
Hey, let's begin.

1229
01:45:12,458 --> 01:45:14,374
Guard us,
Lord Perumal.

1230
01:45:14,375 --> 01:45:15,457
Get to work.
Come on now.

1231
01:45:15,458 --> 01:45:18,500
Let's begin.

1232
01:45:18,625 --> 01:45:21,333
Bring the tools.

1233
01:45:21,625 --> 01:45:22,583
I pray to you, Lord Eshwara.

1234
01:45:35,333 --> 01:45:37,208
Jesus, save us.

1235
01:45:52,750 --> 01:45:56,415
Till the ground and
gather every piece of stone.

1236
01:45:56,416 --> 01:45:57,875
Don't leave out a single stone.

1237
01:45:58,250 --> 01:46:00,500
Gold could be hidden
in the dark stones...

1238
01:46:00,666 --> 01:46:03,041
or in the ones that appear to
be covered in fungus.

1239
01:46:03,333 --> 01:46:07,000
White, red, yellow, or black -
gold could be in any type of stone.

1240
01:46:07,291 --> 01:46:08,250
Understood?

1241
01:46:08,708 --> 01:46:11,833
Take all the stones you've collected
and dump them over there.

1242
01:46:12,250 --> 01:46:16,125
Then smash those stones, grind to dust,
mix them with water...

1243
01:46:16,541 --> 01:46:19,750
and unload them here,
where the Englishmen are.

1244
01:46:20,083 --> 01:46:22,041
Understand? Hurry up.

1245
01:46:22,333 --> 01:46:23,250
Idiots!

1246
01:46:23,458 --> 01:46:24,958
- Mayandi.
- Mayan.

1247
01:46:25,125 --> 01:46:26,083
Arasani, step forward.

1248
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:36,208
He got us the wages as promised.

1249
01:46:36,916 --> 01:46:38,708
Thangalaan is a man of his word.

1250
01:46:39,083 --> 01:46:41,708
Let's earn enough wages
to buy back our lands.

1251
01:46:54,958 --> 01:46:57,916
<i>The end has come.</i>

1252
01:46:59,625 --> 01:47:02,250
<i>Make merry for one last time.</i>

1253
01:47:06,166 --> 01:47:07,041
<i>Aaran.</i>

1254
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:10,041
<i>You tree that has forgotten its roots!</i>

1255
01:47:11,708 --> 01:47:13,583
<i>This war that has raged
through centuries...</i>

1256
01:47:14,416 --> 01:47:15,625
<i>is about to end now.</i>

1257
01:47:20,875 --> 01:47:24,333
Hey, what is wrong?

1258
01:47:25,958 --> 01:47:27,000
Nothing.

1259
01:47:27,250 --> 01:47:29,333
What do you mean "nothing"?

1260
01:47:30,083 --> 01:47:32,208
The spirits are baying for blood.
Strange things are unfolding.

1261
01:47:33,583 --> 01:47:34,833
You are hiding something from me.

1262
01:47:35,291 --> 01:47:36,416
I am not hiding anything.

1263
01:47:37,125 --> 01:47:38,083
You're not?

1264
01:47:38,375 --> 01:47:40,666
Whatever was running in your head
is now running in his head too.

1265
01:47:41,458 --> 01:47:42,666
What's happened to my son?

1266
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:45,708
He was all well.

1267
01:47:46,291 --> 01:47:48,708
What have you done to him,
bringing him out here!

1268
01:47:49,666 --> 01:47:50,583
Don't cry, dear.

1269
01:47:52,458 --> 01:47:54,791
What happened to me
is now happening to him.

1270
01:47:55,708 --> 01:47:57,833
That Aarathi...
she's possessed my head--

1271
01:47:58,166 --> 01:48:01,791
Not again!
Aarathi, Aarathi, Aarathi!

1272
01:48:02,166 --> 01:48:03,541
She's not real.

1273
01:48:04,458 --> 01:48:05,791
She is just a lore.

1274
01:48:06,333 --> 01:48:07,458
This is not a lore.

1275
01:48:07,875 --> 01:48:08,791
It's the truth.

1276
01:48:10,333 --> 01:48:13,082
You keep running in your head
the stories you heard as a child...

1277
01:48:13,083 --> 01:48:14,250
...and now you're searching for it.

1278
01:48:14,958 --> 01:48:15,875
It is true, yes.

1279
01:48:16,875 --> 01:48:17,875
Snap out of it.

1280
01:48:18,958 --> 01:48:20,000
This is not a lore.

1281
01:48:22,833 --> 01:48:24,041
Gengamma.

1282
01:48:25,916 --> 01:48:27,875
This is true, this is not a lore.

1283
01:48:29,791 --> 01:48:30,625
This is not a lore.

1284
01:48:31,541 --> 01:48:34,875
She who has been running in my head,
I saw her with my own eyes.

1285
01:48:36,208 --> 01:48:37,166
I fought her.

1286
01:48:39,291 --> 01:48:41,750
I shot her with these hands.

1287
01:48:43,958 --> 01:48:44,833
This is not a lore.

1288
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:46,333
This is true.

1289
01:48:46,583 --> 01:48:47,415
Everything is true.

1290
01:48:47,416 --> 01:48:49,666
Stop babbling nonsense,
and come sleep.

1291
01:48:49,875 --> 01:48:50,791
Everything is true.

1292
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,333
Hey, please believe me.

1293
01:48:55,041 --> 01:48:56,958
I saw her in flesh and blood.

1294
01:48:58,958 --> 01:49:00,333
Right here.

1295
01:49:01,458 --> 01:49:03,125
She emerged as the leader of the Nagas.

1296
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:07,208
They whisked her away
and ran when I shot at her.

1297
01:49:08,416 --> 01:49:09,708
<i>They did not run away.</i>

1298
01:49:10,750 --> 01:49:12,124
<i>They will return.</i>

1299
01:49:12,125 --> 01:49:13,625
Get lost, you.

1300
01:49:16,583 --> 01:49:17,500
Who are you talking to?

1301
01:49:20,125 --> 01:49:21,958
To her, standing right here.

1302
01:49:29,791 --> 01:49:31,000
Mother...

1303
01:49:31,958 --> 01:49:34,875
whether or not you're real,
whether or not you're here...

1304
01:49:36,625 --> 01:49:39,041
we've left our homeland
and the soil that fed us...

1305
01:49:39,458 --> 01:49:42,791
waded through wilderness
to make a living here.

1306
01:49:43,916 --> 01:49:47,249
Please spare my husband,
my child and my people.

1307
01:49:47,250 --> 01:49:49,458
You will be blessed for ages.

1308
01:49:52,333 --> 01:49:54,166
My dearest, divine mother!

1309
01:49:55,666 --> 01:49:58,000
Reveal where the gold is, Mother.

1310
01:49:59,208 --> 01:50:01,166
We shall return home.

1311
01:50:11,458 --> 01:50:12,708
This is gold, isn't it?

1312
01:50:15,041 --> 01:50:15,958
Dear, look!

1313
01:50:16,833 --> 01:50:17,791
Get over here.

1314
01:50:19,541 --> 01:50:21,708
This must contain gold, right?

1315
01:50:22,375 --> 01:50:23,708
It is gold.

1316
01:50:26,250 --> 01:50:28,375
Hey, it is just a rock.

1317
01:50:28,625 --> 01:50:29,875
It's not gold?

1318
01:50:31,916 --> 01:50:36,083
- Damn it.
- My precious, to me, you are gold.

1319
01:50:37,208 --> 01:50:40,583
Soon, we'll find gold
and you'll be decked in it.

1320
01:50:41,291 --> 01:50:44,875
- I was sure that was gold...
- We'll find it soon.

1321
01:50:45,041 --> 01:50:48,165
- But I thought that was gold.
- We will find gold.

1322
01:50:48,166 --> 01:50:50,666
Idiot! Stand up, rise.

1323
01:50:51,375 --> 01:50:53,583
Get back to work.

1324
01:50:54,083 --> 01:50:55,833
You are always goofing around.

1325
01:50:56,208 --> 01:50:57,041
Get to work.

1326
01:50:57,166 --> 01:50:59,208
What are you staring at?
Get back to work.

1327
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:04,041
Hey, be swift.

1328
01:51:15,333 --> 01:51:17,165
So far, we have found...

1329
01:51:17,166 --> 01:51:21,000
some percentage of iron,
some percentage of silver...

1330
01:51:21,125 --> 01:51:22,416
but no gold in this land.

1331
01:51:23,083 --> 01:51:26,291
It is true.
This land is disappointing us.

1332
01:51:28,458 --> 01:51:30,166
Which rocks do contain gold?

1333
01:51:30,458 --> 01:51:33,416
It is not to be seen in black,
white or even red-coloured rocks.

1334
01:51:33,666 --> 01:51:34,875
Okay, I will show you.

1335
01:51:35,041 --> 01:51:38,458
We have all these rocks in our village.
We came all the way here to pick these?

1336
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:41,375
What do you keep staring at?

1337
01:51:41,666 --> 01:51:43,500
I am looking for my husband's mistress.

1338
01:51:44,458 --> 01:51:45,666
I wonder where she is.

1339
01:51:46,416 --> 01:51:48,791
She causes him such distress.

1340
01:51:49,958 --> 01:51:51,583
If I happen to find her...

1341
01:51:52,208 --> 01:51:53,041
I will rip her to pieces.

1342
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:56,125
Ma, do you mean the ghost?

1343
01:51:56,375 --> 01:51:58,875
Why? You think I can't take her?

1344
01:52:01,666 --> 01:52:02,500
Sister.

1345
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:05,457
Look, it is Aarathi.

1346
01:52:05,458 --> 01:52:06,916
- Where?
- Over there.

1347
01:52:09,958 --> 01:52:11,457
Over there.

1348
01:52:11,458 --> 01:52:13,083
Where is she?

1349
01:52:14,125 --> 01:52:16,166
I don't see her.
Where is she?

1350
01:52:29,458 --> 01:52:31,916
I am... I am...

1351
01:52:32,250 --> 01:52:33,208
Aarathi.

1352
01:52:34,541 --> 01:52:35,458
You people...

1353
01:52:36,875 --> 01:52:39,791
will be led to your doom.

1354
01:52:48,625 --> 01:52:51,249
- Hey! Arasani!
- What happened?

1355
01:52:51,250 --> 01:52:52,582
Get back to work.

1356
01:52:52,583 --> 01:52:54,916
- I am going to whack you.
- Get back to work.

1357
01:52:56,083 --> 01:52:57,416
Did I scare you, sister?

1358
01:52:57,875 --> 01:52:59,416
Hey, shut up.

1359
01:52:59,666 --> 01:53:02,332
- Get to work, Varadha.
- Did I scare you?

1360
01:53:02,333 --> 01:53:03,999
Oh, get lost.
What do I do with you?

1361
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,833
Everybody stop laughing
and do the work.

1362
01:53:09,125 --> 01:53:10,416
Hey, keep working.

1363
01:53:21,583 --> 01:53:23,166
Something is shining.

1364
01:53:57,416 --> 01:53:58,250
Lord...

1365
01:54:03,125 --> 01:54:04,208
Hey, come here...

1366
01:54:05,208 --> 01:54:06,415
Callous beast.

1367
01:54:06,416 --> 01:54:08,625
Varadha, bring me the Kariyat leaves.

1368
01:54:11,250 --> 01:54:13,499
- Tie this up.
- Arthur, what's happened?

1369
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:15,083
A snake bit him.

1370
01:54:15,791 --> 01:54:17,291
Take him to my tent, quickly.

1371
01:54:23,375 --> 01:54:26,375
Hey... look at all those snakes!

1372
01:54:31,625 --> 01:54:33,916
Here, get over here.

1373
01:55:12,291 --> 01:55:15,333
Come on, kids.
Get up, Asoka.

1374
01:55:17,750 --> 01:55:21,041
- Ashoka, come.
- Ma.

1375
01:55:24,916 --> 01:55:25,958
Oh, no! My child!

1376
01:55:26,125 --> 01:55:27,875
Hey, come here.

1377
01:55:29,250 --> 01:55:30,083
Gengamma.

1378
01:55:33,875 --> 01:55:34,957
What is this?

1379
01:55:34,958 --> 01:55:37,833
The venom has spread.
She is not breathing.

1380
01:55:38,458 --> 01:55:40,625
Varadha, bring me the Kariyat leaves.

1381
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,166
Her head has slumped.

1382
01:55:43,375 --> 01:55:44,625
Look, her head is down...

1383
01:55:47,291 --> 01:55:51,041
- Oh, no!
- My little girl is gone!

1384
01:55:55,791 --> 01:55:57,000
My child.

1385
01:55:58,041 --> 01:56:00,458
Open your eyes, dear.

1386
01:56:05,666 --> 01:56:06,500
My baby...

1387
01:56:07,250 --> 01:56:09,291
My baby died before my eyes.

1388
01:56:12,958 --> 01:56:18,208
"The tall dreams of our ancestors"

1389
01:56:18,791 --> 01:56:24,125
"They've come crashing down to dust"

1390
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:29,916
"Oh Earth, Oh Earth
You rugged Earth"

1391
01:56:30,458 --> 01:56:37,250
"You devoured the king of kings
You bloody red earth"

1392
01:56:38,083 --> 01:56:43,083
"As the blood of the good men
Flows through your veins"

1393
01:56:43,875 --> 01:56:48,916
"Now this great clan
Faced with a never-ending famine"

1394
01:56:57,166 --> 01:56:58,833
Her bloodlust won't be quenched.

1395
01:57:00,166 --> 01:57:01,125
Don't you know?

1396
01:57:02,375 --> 01:57:04,625
How our forefathers mined the gold here?

1397
01:57:05,125 --> 01:57:06,208
We need to do the same.

1398
01:57:07,458 --> 01:57:09,666
How did we discover the gold
under the Saint's idol?

1399
01:57:11,375 --> 01:57:14,333
It was revealed by the blood
of the Naga woman.

1400
01:57:14,583 --> 01:57:17,541
This is an age-old conflict.

1401
01:57:18,083 --> 01:57:21,041
That forest girl is who
we now know as Aarathi.

1402
01:57:21,666 --> 01:57:24,416
It is when her blood drenches the soil...

1403
01:57:24,875 --> 01:57:26,416
that all the gold here
will be revealed to us.

1404
01:57:28,833 --> 01:57:30,833
Go on and gear up for the task.

1405
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:33,416
Uncle...

1406
01:57:34,541 --> 01:57:35,666
what are you saying?

1407
01:57:39,833 --> 01:57:43,250
If I intended to do such a thing,
I'd have done it on the day we arrived.

1408
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:48,458
If not by toiling,
how else can we earn?

1409
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:51,958
Do you think I'll dance to her whims?

1410
01:58:04,208 --> 01:58:06,541
You will break this rock.

1411
01:58:08,250 --> 01:58:09,333
That is an order.

1412
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,291
We can't grieve for your loss.

1413
01:58:12,500 --> 01:58:13,583
We are losing time.

1414
01:58:14,083 --> 01:58:16,750
There are no ghosts or monsters here.
You won't drop dead.

1415
01:58:22,041 --> 01:58:24,083
I want that glittering rock.

1416
01:58:25,375 --> 01:58:26,875
Get to work.

1417
01:58:27,583 --> 01:58:28,750
A rock from the era of the king.

1418
01:58:30,416 --> 01:58:31,583
The same glittering rock.

1419
01:58:37,958 --> 01:58:39,708
If we fall apart,
we will remain fallen.

1420
01:58:42,291 --> 01:58:43,708
Let's get to work, move!

1421
01:58:47,375 --> 01:58:48,583
We are almost there.

1422
01:58:49,041 --> 01:58:50,875
Rise. Get up.

1423
01:58:54,666 --> 01:58:56,208
Breaking this rock is no easy task.

1424
01:58:56,625 --> 01:59:00,125
Gather all the mud around carefully.

1425
01:59:02,083 --> 01:59:02,916
Don't stop, keep working.

1426
01:59:15,958 --> 01:59:16,874
This is not enough.

1427
01:59:16,875 --> 01:59:20,666
- That's all you get, move it.
- How is this fair for six of us?

1428
01:59:20,791 --> 01:59:22,250
From now, you will be paid
only if you find gold.

1429
01:59:22,583 --> 01:59:24,540
What are you looking at?
Chase them away.

1430
01:59:24,541 --> 01:59:26,999
Uncle, they're saying we will be paid
only if we find gold.

1431
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,416
We trusted you.

1432
01:59:28,666 --> 01:59:30,083
What fresh hell will
you bring upon us now?

1433
01:59:33,375 --> 01:59:36,125
- We are hungry, master.
- How dare you, scoundrels?

1434
02:00:27,166 --> 02:00:28,250
I have lost all hope.

1435
02:00:29,833 --> 02:00:30,791
Whilst you're lying there.

1436
02:00:33,958 --> 02:00:34,875
Sleeping.

1437
02:00:42,750 --> 02:00:44,291
You are selfish, my friend.

1438
02:00:45,666 --> 02:00:47,083
You are selfish.

1439
02:00:49,875 --> 02:00:51,083
You won't even drink with me.

1440
02:00:51,708 --> 02:00:52,791
Are you going to drink with me?

1441
02:00:53,416 --> 02:00:56,666
Drink, drink, drink...

1442
02:00:56,916 --> 02:00:57,750
Kill me!

1443
02:01:04,791 --> 02:01:05,625
No one...

1444
02:01:06,166 --> 02:01:07,333
there is no one.

1445
02:01:08,125 --> 02:01:09,041
Get up!

1446
02:01:23,583 --> 02:01:24,666
I know...

1447
02:01:26,250 --> 02:01:27,750
that you are mocking me.

1448
02:01:30,708 --> 02:01:33,791
You are trying to make a fool
out of Clement.

1449
02:01:38,375 --> 02:01:39,500
There is gold here.

1450
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:44,583
Why would you not show it to me?

1451
02:01:47,125 --> 02:01:48,583
Am I not worthy enough?

1452
02:01:51,541 --> 02:01:52,666
Am I not worthy?

1453
02:01:54,541 --> 02:01:55,458
Where is the gold?

1454
02:01:56,208 --> 02:01:57,333
Where is the gold?

1455
02:01:57,791 --> 02:02:00,041
Where is the gold?

1456
02:02:03,041 --> 02:02:03,875
You...

1457
02:02:56,291 --> 02:02:57,125
Lord.

1458
02:02:58,833 --> 02:02:59,666
Lord.

1459
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:01,333
Lord...

1460
02:03:03,416 --> 02:03:04,250
Lord...

1461
02:03:09,333 --> 02:03:10,166
Lord...

1462
02:03:12,875 --> 02:03:13,750
Lord?

1463
02:03:22,833 --> 02:03:25,291
This is all your fault!

1464
02:03:25,541 --> 02:03:27,708
It's your fault.

1465
02:03:28,041 --> 02:03:30,458
You are the reason behind all of this.

1466
02:03:37,625 --> 02:03:41,208
It's all your fault!

1467
02:03:41,333 --> 02:03:42,166
Aaran...

1468
02:03:42,833 --> 02:03:47,916
Each of your misdeeds drives a
deeper wedge between us.

1469
02:03:48,875 --> 02:03:51,791
Yet, in truth, you're
meant to be alongside me.

1470
02:03:52,375 --> 02:03:54,875
You share responsibility
for this gold too.

1471
02:03:55,083 --> 02:03:57,958
Don't talk in riddles.
Quit bothering me.

1472
02:03:58,791 --> 02:03:59,625
I...

1473
02:04:00,208 --> 02:04:03,500
I am going to bring my
people to break this rock...

1474
02:04:03,791 --> 02:04:05,583
and mine all the gold from here.

1475
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:10,333
Oh, no!

1476
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:12,166
Our huts catching fire by themselves.

1477
02:04:13,916 --> 02:04:15,375
We have no food here.

1478
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:18,750
It's better to be out of jobs
than to die here.

1479
02:04:20,791 --> 02:04:21,875
Let's get out of here.

1480
02:04:22,875 --> 02:04:25,708
Wait up, guys.

1481
02:04:25,958 --> 02:04:27,500
There is gold in that rock.

1482
02:04:27,791 --> 02:04:28,833
Believe me.

1483
02:04:29,500 --> 02:04:31,875
Let's burn the rock,
and break it...

1484
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:35,375
and turn our lives around
with the gold from that rock.

1485
02:04:35,500 --> 02:04:37,000
Remember what the Lord promised us?

1486
02:04:37,541 --> 02:04:39,500
That we all get a share of the gold.

1487
02:04:40,166 --> 02:04:41,624
I will get it for everyone.

1488
02:04:41,625 --> 02:04:43,040
Listen to me...

1489
02:04:43,041 --> 02:04:45,790
- Gengu, don't leave!
- Go away.

1490
02:04:45,791 --> 02:04:47,041
We're all leaving.

1491
02:04:47,916 --> 02:04:49,082
None of us will stay back.

1492
02:04:49,083 --> 02:04:50,083
Priest!

1493
02:04:50,958 --> 02:04:53,333
I will kill you.

1494
02:04:55,500 --> 02:04:56,875
Spare him.

1495
02:04:59,541 --> 02:05:00,500
Gengu.

1496
02:05:00,833 --> 02:05:02,791
Lord, don't do it!

1497
02:05:06,958 --> 02:05:09,540
Trying to run away, are you?

1498
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:11,583
I'll kill you all.

1499
02:05:12,250 --> 02:05:13,791
You can never run from me.

1500
02:05:14,250 --> 02:05:15,916
You can never run from me.

1501
02:05:16,250 --> 02:05:17,333
O Brother...

1502
02:05:18,291 --> 02:05:23,208
Constantly cursing our oppressors
is pointless.

1503
02:05:23,500 --> 02:05:27,333
Rise, stand tall, and march ahead
to alter your fate.

1504
02:05:28,833 --> 02:05:33,458
The bull is here to satisfy our hunger.

1505
02:05:36,333 --> 02:05:37,375
Every single last one of you...

1506
02:05:37,958 --> 02:05:39,125
Oh, sacrificial bull.

1507
02:05:45,083 --> 02:05:46,666
Your food has arrived.

1508
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:44,875
Eat well.

1509
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:49,375
Eat it well and become so strong that
not just that rock...

1510
02:06:49,875 --> 02:06:53,041
but all the hardships of our people
should crumble.

1511
02:06:53,333 --> 02:06:54,166
Yes!

1512
02:06:55,875 --> 02:06:59,666
Those who sacrificed
their lives for our freedom...

1513
02:07:00,500 --> 02:07:02,291
we are nothing but their remains.

1514
02:07:04,791 --> 02:07:06,125
My children are gone.

1515
02:07:09,208 --> 02:07:10,541
Uncle Muniyan is no more.

1516
02:07:10,750 --> 02:07:12,875
Many others are gone too.

1517
02:07:16,458 --> 02:07:18,500
The upper castes beat us
and the white men kill us...

1518
02:07:19,250 --> 02:07:20,791
but should we give up our fight?

1519
02:07:22,125 --> 02:07:23,208
No.

1520
02:07:23,791 --> 02:07:27,624
- Is this fight merely for gold and riches?
- No.

1521
02:07:27,625 --> 02:07:29,333
For generations,

1522
02:07:29,791 --> 02:07:34,375
we've fought to reclaim the dignity,
pride and rights of our people.

1523
02:07:34,666 --> 02:07:35,583
Yes.

1524
02:07:35,791 --> 02:07:36,791
Yes.

1525
02:07:37,208 --> 02:07:39,750
Life here is for those
who brave death.

1526
02:07:40,166 --> 02:07:42,666
Yes, yes!

1527
02:07:58,625 --> 02:08:04,041
"Oh Thangalaan
Thangalaan..."

1528
02:08:05,250 --> 02:08:11,791
"Break free, oh harbinger"

1529
02:08:12,750 --> 02:08:15,999
"Oh Thangalaan
Thangalaan..."

1530
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:19,833
"Break free, oh harbinger"

1531
02:08:19,958 --> 02:08:23,040
"Oh Thangalaan
Thangalaan..."

1532
02:08:23,041 --> 02:08:27,083
"Break free, oh harbinger"

1533
02:08:29,208 --> 02:08:30,625
The gold we're on the brink of mining...

1534
02:08:31,916 --> 02:08:33,250
is set to change our lives.

1535
02:08:37,291 --> 02:08:39,166
Gold will kill you.

1536
02:09:01,458 --> 02:09:03,666
The rock is hot now.

1537
02:09:03,875 --> 02:09:06,541
If we dig now,
we'll get all the gold.

1538
02:09:06,916 --> 02:09:10,125
Keep striking, don't stop.

1539
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,500
These are the Chola mines.

1540
02:10:11,916 --> 02:10:13,000
Not just Cholas...

1541
02:10:14,250 --> 02:10:19,041
this is the where even Tipu Sultan
attempted and failed to get gold.

1542
02:10:20,875 --> 02:10:23,041
Lord, this is the Chola mine
I told you about.

1543
02:10:56,625 --> 02:10:57,625
We've found the gold.

1544
02:10:59,375 --> 02:11:00,375
We've found the gold.

1545
02:11:01,541 --> 02:11:03,666
Arasani, we've found the gold.

1546
02:11:04,041 --> 02:11:06,208
Gold.
Uncle, look. It is gold.

1547
02:11:37,083 --> 02:11:42,083
Narayana! Lord Perumal!
You showed us the way.

1548
02:11:42,583 --> 02:11:43,666
Narayana!

1549
02:11:52,583 --> 02:11:56,332
Watch me turn these into jewellery
and strut around the upper caste women.

1550
02:11:56,333 --> 02:11:58,083
You'll look like a queen.

1551
02:11:59,458 --> 02:12:01,250
So much gold!

1552
02:12:03,666 --> 02:12:06,791
You could have grabbed more gold.

1553
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,415
This is plenty for us, sir.

1554
02:12:08,416 --> 02:12:10,083
- What?
- There's so much more down there.

1555
02:12:10,416 --> 02:12:11,540
We took what we could.

1556
02:12:11,541 --> 02:12:14,499
What do you mean you're taking it?
Give it back.

1557
02:12:14,500 --> 02:12:16,791
- Why? It's ours!
- Put it down.

1558
02:12:19,625 --> 02:12:20,958
Let go of her!

1559
02:12:22,166 --> 02:12:23,082
Give me that...

1560
02:12:23,083 --> 02:12:25,333
No. No. No.

1561
02:12:29,916 --> 02:12:31,458
This gold is mine.

1562
02:12:31,875 --> 02:12:33,375
Nobody steals from me.

1563
02:12:34,041 --> 02:12:34,958
Nobody.

1564
02:12:35,791 --> 02:12:36,708
Dear!

1565
02:12:38,291 --> 02:12:39,583
Wake up, dear.

1566
02:12:41,041 --> 02:12:43,333
- Dearest...
- This belongs to me.

1567
02:12:45,291 --> 02:12:47,583
- Oh no, my love!
- This belongs to me.

1568
02:12:48,541 --> 02:12:49,458
Do you hear me?

1569
02:12:51,166 --> 02:12:52,041
Kailasam.

1570
02:12:52,458 --> 02:12:53,625
You will tell them...

1571
02:12:54,083 --> 02:12:56,208
if anyone steals from me...

1572
02:12:56,541 --> 02:12:58,874
I will kill every single last one of them.

1573
02:12:58,875 --> 02:13:00,582
Open your eyes, my dear.

1574
02:13:00,583 --> 02:13:01,791
- Yes, sir.
- Tell them.

1575
02:13:03,333 --> 02:13:04,250
Hey...

1576
02:13:05,166 --> 02:13:08,000
The gold you mine here
doesn't belong to any of you.

1577
02:13:08,916 --> 02:13:10,750
Put it all here.

1578
02:13:11,083 --> 02:13:15,083
If any of you dare to take it,
you'll meet the same fate.

1579
02:13:15,708 --> 02:13:16,625
Understand?

1580
02:13:17,500 --> 02:13:18,750
Arrogant pricks.

1581
02:13:26,916 --> 02:13:28,125
Now, get me all of it.

1582
02:13:30,416 --> 02:13:31,291
Now.

1583
02:13:36,333 --> 02:13:38,874
Now, mine me all the gold

1584
02:13:38,875 --> 02:13:41,708
Or I will feed you to the dogs.

1585
02:13:44,916 --> 02:13:47,290
Hey Gengu, step over here...

1586
02:13:47,291 --> 02:13:49,624
and fetch us all that
gold back from your folks.

1587
02:13:49,625 --> 02:13:53,832
Remain a loyal slave and you'll have
it all- the rewards, titles, bonuses.

1588
02:13:53,833 --> 02:13:57,540
Cut the crap!
Enough with the lies.

1589
02:13:57,541 --> 02:14:00,249
You recite the Vedas
but you're tearing down temples.

1590
02:14:00,250 --> 02:14:03,875
Who wants your rewards,
titles, and money?

1591
02:14:04,041 --> 02:14:06,499
This is our blood and sweat.

1592
02:14:06,500 --> 02:14:08,750
We've bled and worked hard
for this, you get me?

1593
02:14:09,375 --> 02:14:10,957
How do you have rights that we don't?

1594
02:14:10,958 --> 02:14:14,624
Who gave you the rights?
What was your first promise to us?

1595
02:14:14,625 --> 02:14:17,665
Didn't you promise us
half of what we dug up?

1596
02:14:17,666 --> 02:14:20,375
Now, you're backtracking.
I can't give it.

1597
02:14:20,583 --> 02:14:21,499
I won't hand it over.

1598
02:14:21,500 --> 02:14:24,957
- I swear on Narayana, it's not happening.
- You imbecile.

1599
02:14:24,958 --> 02:14:27,499
How dare you?
Put it down.

1600
02:14:27,500 --> 02:14:28,833
Hit me all you want.
I won't give it.

1601
02:14:28,958 --> 02:14:30,875
What makes you so bold?
Won't hand it over, huh?

1602
02:14:32,250 --> 02:14:34,833
Die, you.
Die.

1603
02:14:44,916 --> 02:14:45,791
Look at this, William.

1604
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:56,375
You will go in there
and collect all the gold...

1605
02:14:56,541 --> 02:14:59,499
that these dogs are hiding from me.

1606
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:01,666
Do you understand?
Go.

1607
02:15:06,708 --> 02:15:07,541
Let us go.

1608
02:15:08,083 --> 02:15:09,541
Let us go.

1609
02:15:11,916 --> 02:15:12,958
What are you doing?

1610
02:15:13,166 --> 02:15:14,416
This is not gold.

1611
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,750
It's just some rock
that glitters like gold.

1612
02:15:16,958 --> 02:15:18,000
This is not gold.

1613
02:15:19,208 --> 02:15:20,125
Hey, stop!

1614
02:15:21,208 --> 02:15:22,291
This is not gold?

1615
02:15:23,041 --> 02:15:24,583
We worked so hard for this?

1616
02:15:25,541 --> 02:15:26,458
What are you guys doing?

1617
02:15:28,458 --> 02:15:32,125
Aarathi is playing tricks on us
with rocks that glitter like gold.

1618
02:15:32,833 --> 02:15:36,374
It's all her shadow tricks.

1619
02:15:36,375 --> 02:15:39,833
Look, look... it's all just rocks.

1620
02:15:40,333 --> 02:15:41,791
Why are you fighting?

1621
02:15:42,375 --> 02:15:43,250
This...

1622
02:15:44,750 --> 02:15:45,583
is...

1623
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:46,916
fake.

1624
02:15:48,291 --> 02:15:52,333
I know how to get the real gold.

1625
02:15:52,916 --> 02:15:53,833
Now!

1626
02:16:19,166 --> 02:16:20,125
Aaran...

1627
02:16:21,041 --> 02:16:24,291
He who is unaware of his own self
embodies destruction.

1628
02:16:24,750 --> 02:16:29,000
The people who have taken him
as their leader shall follow him to doom.

1629
02:16:33,791 --> 02:16:37,375
Despite my warnings,
you still haven't backed down?

1630
02:16:37,916 --> 02:16:39,375
You haven't.

1631
02:16:40,958 --> 02:16:42,458
You haven't, Aaran?

1632
02:16:46,416 --> 02:16:48,083
I will not, Aarathi.

1633
02:17:05,791 --> 02:17:07,707
What is it?

1634
02:17:07,708 --> 02:17:09,416
Everyone, follow me.

1635
02:17:10,333 --> 02:17:12,041
Let's stand with Aarathi.

1636
02:17:12,458 --> 02:17:15,125
This is Rebirth and Redemption.

1637
02:17:55,833 --> 02:17:56,958
Aarathi.

1638
02:18:40,458 --> 02:18:42,250
{\an8}Attachment is the root cause of suffering.

1639
02:18:49,125 --> 02:18:52,916
The duty of protecting the gold
from the ones consumed by greed...

1640
02:18:53,083 --> 02:18:55,666
falls upon Aaran and Aarathi.

1641
02:19:01,375 --> 02:19:02,250
Aarathi...

1642
02:19:04,833 --> 02:19:05,665
Aaran...

1643
02:19:05,666 --> 02:19:09,416
The troops on horseback
are approaching our land.

1644
02:19:13,500 --> 02:19:15,375
You are the protector of this forest.

1645
02:19:19,041 --> 02:19:23,040
We are marching into war to guard our gold
from the bounty hunters.

1646
02:19:23,041 --> 02:19:24,875
War!

1647
02:19:55,958 --> 02:19:57,125
Aarathi

1648
02:20:08,791 --> 02:20:09,708
What is this?

1649
02:20:12,708 --> 02:20:13,833
I am Aaran.

1650
02:20:15,166 --> 02:20:16,500
And this is my land.

1651
02:20:27,333 --> 02:20:29,833
This land belongs to our people.

1652
02:20:39,875 --> 02:20:44,500
I will not let you take even
a speck of gold from here.

1653
02:20:56,708 --> 02:20:58,250
You...

1654
02:21:00,166 --> 02:21:01,291
Do it now.

1655
02:21:20,208 --> 02:21:21,500
Now get the gold.

1656
02:21:44,125 --> 02:21:45,125
Aarathi.

1657
02:21:49,041 --> 02:21:50,291
I...

1658
02:21:52,833 --> 02:21:54,458
I have realised who I am.

1659
02:21:59,333 --> 02:22:00,625
Forgive me.

1660
02:22:01,458 --> 02:22:02,416
Please, forgive me.

1661
02:22:04,250 --> 02:22:05,541
We, who went to war...

1662
02:22:05,708 --> 02:22:06,625
were defeated.

1663
02:22:07,583 --> 02:22:09,125
Just like those people...

1664
02:22:09,958 --> 02:22:14,083
we changed our ways of living...

1665
02:22:15,458 --> 02:22:18,791
In due course, we were defeated
by the Varna Caste system.

1666
02:22:20,750 --> 02:22:23,166
We lost our country,
we lost our lands.

1667
02:22:23,750 --> 02:22:27,500
Exiled, we lived on the fringes
of our own villages.

1668
02:22:27,666 --> 02:22:31,375
I arrived as Aadhi Muni,
as Kaadaiyan...

1669
02:22:31,750 --> 02:22:32,916
as Nadha Muni.

1670
02:22:33,708 --> 02:22:36,000
I attempted to find gold
and was deceived.

1671
02:22:36,541 --> 02:22:39,125
Now I've arrived as Thangalaan.

1672
02:22:42,666 --> 02:22:44,875
It's our responsibility
to protect this forest.

1673
02:22:45,416 --> 02:22:50,416
It is also our duty to protect the people
who protect the gold in these forests.

1674
02:22:50,875 --> 02:22:52,666
In this material world...

1675
02:22:53,541 --> 02:22:57,375
to meet our survival needs that were
snatched away from us...

1676
02:22:59,791 --> 02:23:01,166
this is the only way.

1677
02:23:01,458 --> 02:23:03,750
Please let us through.

1678
02:23:04,500 --> 02:23:06,083
Will gold solve all your problems?

1679
02:23:07,041 --> 02:23:08,000
Make way...

1680
02:23:13,291 --> 02:23:14,333
Try.

1681
02:23:19,750 --> 02:23:20,750
Go!

1682
02:24:09,125 --> 02:24:11,375
A new dawn breaks into our lives.

1683
02:24:12,291 --> 02:24:13,916
Brother!

1684
02:24:28,208 --> 02:24:33,625
"Oh Thangalaan
Thangalaan..."

1685
02:24:34,791 --> 02:24:41,083
"Break free, oh harbinger "

1686
02:24:42,375 --> 02:24:45,457
"Oh Thangalaan
Thangalaan..."

1687
02:24:45,458 --> 02:24:49,291
"Break free, oh harbinger"

1688
02:24:49,500 --> 02:24:52,582
"Oh Thangalaan
Thangalaan..."

1689
02:24:52,583 --> 02:24:56,540
"Break free, oh harbinger"

1690
02:24:56,541 --> 02:24:59,790
"Break the shackles of caste
Our dawn is near"

1691
02:24:59,791 --> 02:25:03,541
"People of the soil shall stand tall
Your 'Parai' beats will resound"

1692
02:25:03,708 --> 02:25:06,915
"Break the shackles of caste
Our dawn is near"

1693
02:25:06,916 --> 02:25:10,790
"People of the soil shall stand tall
Your 'Parai' beats will resound"

1694
02:25:10,791 --> 02:25:12,958
"Oh Thangalaan
Thangalaan..."

1695
02:25:13,916 --> 02:25:20,291
"Break free, oh harbinger"

1696
02:25:21,500 --> 02:25:24,582
"Oh Thangalaan
Thangalaan..."

1697
02:25:24,583 --> 02:25:28,416
"Break free, oh harbinger"

1698
02:25:28,625 --> 02:25:31,624
"Oh Thangalaan
Thangalaan..."

1699
02:25:31,625 --> 02:25:35,666
"Break free, oh harbinger"
