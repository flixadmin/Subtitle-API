1
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:28,525


2
00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:33,720
By the time I left Miami,

3
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:37,182
Americans were doing a couple hundred tons
of cocaine every year.

4
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:42,812
To satisfy American noses,
the narcos ramped up their operations.

5
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:47,317
- Here, honey.
- Ah, thank you.

6
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,405
- Hey, is that the Bahamas?
- Hm?

7
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:55,451
Oh... Yeah.

8
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:57,411
That's beautiful.

9
00:01:59,246 --> 00:02:00,830
They were flying so many planes,

10
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:04,251
they needed a refueling stop
between Colombia and Miami.

11
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,337
So Carlos Lehder
bought an island in the Bahamas

12
00:02:07,421 --> 00:02:10,090
as a transshipment point
for the drugs and money.

13
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,928
Turns out...
it was a damn good place to party.

14
00:02:16,888 --> 00:02:21,518
It was modern day Sodom and Gomorrah,
with the three things Carlos liked most:

15
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:26,106
- sex, drugs, and Nazi sympathizers.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

16
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:36,032
The problem was
no longer demand... it was supply.

17
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:45,625
We should be over the Amazon by now.

18
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:52,424
From 10,000 feet, Colombia
was a paradise of untouched rainforest.

19
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,969
But things were different
on the ground.

20
00:02:57,929 --> 00:03:01,766
Pablo and his partners built superlabs
the size of small cities.

21
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:10,066
From leaf to paste to powder,
they produced 10,000 kilos a week.

22
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:15,197
At 50 grand a kilo,
that's five billion dollars a year.

23
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,533
These guys weren't fuckin' around.

24
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:26,458
Pablo's cousin Gustavo flew chemists in
from Germany to liquefy the cocaine.

25
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:31,463
They added it to liquor, to coffee,
and just to be funny...

26
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:33,089
they put it back in Coca-Cola.

27
00:03:33,173 --> 00:03:34,466
Patrón?

28
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,551
Looks good?

29
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:38,053
Cocaine was no longer
hidden alongside products.

30
00:03:40,556 --> 00:03:42,015
It was the product.

31
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:48,897
The narcos even
had their own drug-sniffing dogs.

32
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,859
Gacha bet Pablo that not even
a German scientist could fool his dog.

33
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:01,154
And that's what they tried first.

34
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:07,202
On paper, Pablo had
the most profitable taxi company ever.

35
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:08,453
He only had three cars,

36
00:06:08,537 --> 00:06:11,873
but he was pulling in
more than five million dollars a week.

37
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:16,419
And Gacha had the most successful
emerald mine of all time.

38
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:20,256
He would inject bad stones with oil
to make them shiny,

39
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,009
then have his friends in Miami
buy the emeralds with drug money

40
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:25,345
and give them as gifts
to hookers in town.

41
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:28,348
Everybody was happy.

42
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:34,771
But no matter what they did,
they couldn't hide all that money.

43
00:06:35,731 --> 00:06:37,815
It just kept coming in.

44
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:20,609
And that's what they did.

45
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:22,860
They buried it in fields...

46
00:07:24,446 --> 00:07:28,408
they hid it in caletas,
hiding places in walls and ceilings.

47
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:33,413
They even stuck a million dollars
in Pablo's mother's couch.

48
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:13,035
Pablo called this accountant "Blackbeard,"

49
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,954
not because he looked like a pirate,

50
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:18,249
but because his job was to map out
where the treasure was hidden.

51
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:23,421
But not even the pirate did the trick.

52
00:08:23,505 --> 00:08:25,674
The problem was Colombia itself.

53
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:28,802
It was too small a country
for a fortune that big.

54
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:33,973
It was inevitable... someone, somewhere
would try to snatch the narcos' treasure.

55
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:31,280
I know what you're thinking.

56
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:34,158
No one's crazy enough
to kidnap drug dealers, right?

57
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:38,872
But if you're thinking that, it's because
you're not familiar with M-19.

58
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,709
M-19 was a communist guerrilla group

59
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:45,086
made up of college students
and intellectuals

60
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:47,630
who read too much Karl Marx
for their own good.

61
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,552
Their leader was
Ivan "the Terrible" Torres...

62
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:55,346
a history professor
who knew nothing about guerilla warfare,

63
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,724
but understood the power of symbols.

64
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:00,894
He broke into
the Quinta de Bolívar Museum

65
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:04,981
with his buddy Alejandro
and Alejandro's girlfriend, Elisa,

66
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:09,444
and stole a national treasure...
the sword of Simón Bolívar,

67
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:13,406
the mythic general who led Colombia
to independence from the Spanish empire.

68
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,925
These jokers even left a note:

69
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:36,053
"Bolívar, your sword
returns to the battlefield."

70
00:10:37,764 --> 00:10:42,393
It was a stroke of genius...
a marketing stunt way ahead of its time.

71
00:10:42,477 --> 00:10:44,479
And it made them famous overnight.

72
00:10:46,815 --> 00:10:48,817
And I guess it went to their heads.

73
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:35,571
March 13th, 1981,
the day they kidnapped Marta Ochoa,

74
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:39,200
was also the day the Lion
completed 100 trips to Miami.

75
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:44,956
Hola.

76
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:55,591
Does the cat have any papers?

77
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,802
- Sí.
- Please.

78
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,473
Thank you.

79
00:12:06,686 --> 00:12:07,854
Mm.

80
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:12,859
Excuse me a second, please.

81
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:31,920
Well, I guess he's talking about Puff.

82
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,699
My boss is not having a good day.

83
00:13:01,783 --> 00:13:03,785
I think his wife left him.

84
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:12,001
Yeah, well, he's a little bit cranky,
so... how important is this cat to you?

85
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:13,544
Excuse me?

86
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:15,337
OK.

87
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:16,422
Come with me, please.

88
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:39,862
So... wait here, please.

89
00:13:41,114 --> 00:13:43,783
And my boss will ask you
for this paper later.

90
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:46,494
How long is it gonna be?

91
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:47,745
I don't know.

92
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:53,250
Pablo! Pablo!

93
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:55,419
While I was trying to get into Bogotá,

94
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:58,047
Pablo was trying to get into politics.

95
00:13:58,131 --> 00:14:02,177
When he said he was going
to be president of Colombia, he meant it.

96
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:43,759
Where is this guy?
We've been waiting for hours now.

97
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:48,681
Maybe he's at "terapia de pareja."

98
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:50,225
What's that?

99
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,726
Couples counseling.

100
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,311
Right.

101
00:14:55,271 --> 00:14:56,689
What're you doing?

102
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:58,774
Oh, I'm practicing my Spanish.

103
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,618
Yeah, you heard that right.

104
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:13,455
She just compared Pablo Escobar
to fucking Robin Hood.

105
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:16,292
And in a way, she was right.

106
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,169
When you've run out of ways
to hide your money,

107
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:20,671
that's when you give it to the poor.

108
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:22,798
But I don't want to get ahead of myself.

109
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,764
Connie, you know who that is?

110
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,350
Bet he could get our cat
into the country.

111
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,061
I can't believe it.

112
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:20,315
They don't even know
he's a fucking drug dealer.

113
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,072
At the time,
Pablo was just a blip on my radar.

114
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:31,492
I didn't know
I was about to be a blip on his.

115
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,502
Well, we've been waiting
for hours. Thanks for coming out.

116
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:45,798
Uh, my wife's a little exhausted,
so here is the cat's vaccination--

117
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:47,383
Your passport.

118
00:16:48,343 --> 00:16:49,344
I'm sorry?

119
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:52,221
Your passport, please.

120
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:14,994
What do you do at
the United States Embassy, Mr. Murphy?

121
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,330
I am in, uh,
janitorial services.

122
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:20,624
Janitorial services.

123
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,251
Another one.

124
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:25,838
Your embassy must be very clean.

125
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:29,675
Oh, yeah.
You bet your ass it is.

126
00:17:31,177 --> 00:17:32,428
Your cat's cleared.

127
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:36,557
Enjoy Colombia.

128
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:46,692
And just like that, the narcos
had me on file the very first day.

129
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:08,339
As for Valeria Velez,

130
00:18:08,423 --> 00:18:12,551
the journalist who first
interviewed Pablo... watch out.

131
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,054
She was as dangerous as M-19.

132
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:38,220
You gotta give it to her.

133
00:19:38,304 --> 00:19:41,390
She saw Pablo coming a mile away.

134
00:19:41,474 --> 00:19:45,644
And she got herself in just the
right place to take full advantage of him.

135
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:49,690
Not unlike my partner Javier Peña,

136
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:52,568
who figured the best way
to get inside narco information

137
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,862
was to hang out
with the same women they did.

138
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,974
Oh, God! What was that?

139
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:12,184
That was like a .38.

140
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,228
- About four blocks away.
- Oh...

141
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:33,872
Welcome to Bogotá.

142
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:36,751
Should we do it under the bed?

143
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:49,615
First day at the American Embassy.

144
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:52,242
- I met my partner...
- Javier?

145
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:54,536
...who introduced me to the DEA.

146
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,330
Murphy, this is Weaver and Wisnicki.

147
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:58,373
These guys are R.I.P.
"Retired in Place."

148
00:24:58,457 --> 00:25:00,375
- Eat me, Peña.
- Paid vacation's over, fellas.

149
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:01,710
Murphy and I are going to Medellín.

150
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:04,797
We'll telex the T-3 reports.
They go straight to Washington.

151
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:08,342
We are going to Medellín?

152
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:12,554
- Then the Mil Group.
- Jarheads... this is Murphy.

153
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:14,014
Murphy, this is Mil Group.

154
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:17,601
They advise Colombian military
on communist threats in the countryside.

155
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:19,060
Hey, those are classified.

156
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:22,272
- Now they're declassified.
- That's the ambassador's call.

157
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:23,858
No problem.

158
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:30,823
And the last stop...
the ambassador's office.

159
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:32,199
Why do you need this intel?

160
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:36,244
There's an unusual number of prostitutes
headed to Medellín this weekend.

161
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:37,996
Every high-end girl in Bogotá.

162
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,248
First class airfare,
five-star hotels.

163
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:42,501
The narcos are having a meeting
and then a party.

164
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,961
What does the M-19
have to do with this?

165
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,923
Somebody kidnapped Marta Ochoa.
Intel suggests it was M-19.

166
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:50,926
I need access to the M-19 files
to confirm.

167
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:55,305
If I find out one single dollar
of American taxpayer money

168
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:58,809
went to any of those hookers,
it'll be your ass.

169
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:01,019
OK, thank you.
One last thing, Ambassador.

170
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:02,312
Yes, Agent Peña?

171
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:05,106
I'm filing a visa request
for my informant. I need your signature.

172
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:06,859
You're bothering me.

173
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:10,905
She sure likes you.

174
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:12,740
Is your informant really a prostitute?

175
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:14,616
Everybody works for somebody.

176
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:25,460
The very next day,
I was flying with Peña to Medellín,

177
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:27,295
Pablo's home turf.

178
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:39,683
First stop: Carlos Holguín School,
Colonel Carrillo's base of operations.

179
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:01,872
I want you
to meet our new DEA, Steve Murphy.

180
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:10,965
Then we went straight to a fancy
hotel where the narcos were about to meet.

181
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:17,679
The pictures I took that day
helped to ID guys for months to come.

182
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:23,143
There was Carlos Lehder...

183
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:28,774
...the Ochoa brothers...

184
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:36,740
Fernando Galeano,
"the Wolfman"...

185
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:49,962
Is that Gacha?

186
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:53,423
I've never seen him
with other traffickers.

187
00:27:55,634 --> 00:28:00,096
And last but not least...
Gustavo and Pablo.

188
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:04,018
Get pictures of that fucker.

189
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,776
They were all under one roof
and Peña got us there to document it all.

190
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,076
What we didn't know was
that we were witnessing the formation

191
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:23,244
of the famed Medellín cartel.

192
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:27,123
Pablo took advantage
of the kidnapping of Marta Ochoa

193
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:30,585
to bring all the narcos together
for the very first time.

194
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,715
And then he proclaimed himself
their leader.

195
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:43,491
We knew the meeting was over
when the hookers came to play.

196
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:46,912
Peña had finally
gotten one of his informants

197
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:48,914
right into the heart of the action.

198
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:28,829
She should be here by now.

199
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:31,331
You think she slipped?

200
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,500
Nah, she's no dummy.

201
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,923
Maybe she's getting pretty for you.

202
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:41,216
Yeah.

203
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:57,649
Aah...

204
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:01,153
Helena wanted a US visa so bad,

205
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:04,072
she was willing to do anything
to help our cause.

206
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:06,992
And that was a problem.

207
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:42,652
They're
telling me the girl left a long time ago.

208
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:47,115
- She's already dead.
- No, they wouldn't kill her at the hotel.

209
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:48,909
Then they killed her somewhere else.

210
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,785
She knew the risks.

211
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:52,829
If we're going back,
we go back now.

212
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,926
Gonna stick around here
and see if she shows up, OK?

213
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:08,845
- Yeah, and where are you going?
- We're gonna go look for her.

214
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:05,962
Any news on the radio?

215
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:02,745
Hey, gringo.
Carrillo is calling. Come on.

216
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:06,541
No habla inglés, huh?

217
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:08,293
¡Vamos!

218
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,386
Where the fuck's Peña?
¿Dónde está Peña?

219
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:39,657
- How is she?
- Sedated.

220
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:44,329
- Is she gonna be OK?
- Physically, yeah.

221
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:46,581
Mentally, I haven't got a fucking clue.

222
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,251
- You left me behind on purpose.
- Look, man--

223
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:52,628
If we're gonna be partners,
I don't get left behind.

224
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:56,299
I didn't come all the way down here, Peña,
to sit on the fucking sidelines.

225
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:05,141
Whatever's going on here...
I'm in all the way.

226
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:06,851
Is that understood?

227
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,191
Understood.

228
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:19,239
I hope you know what that means.

229
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:31,000
Pablo's message
to the kidnappers was simple.

230
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:36,047
He was going to kill them, one by one,
until he got Marta Ochoa back.

231
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:40,051
Ivan "the Terrible" thought he could
hide in the jungle and wait it out.

232
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:43,137
Sooner or later,
he figured the narcos would cave in.

233
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:45,681
Big mistake.

234
00:37:45,765 --> 00:37:48,142
M-19 didn't stand a chance.

235
00:38:16,588 --> 00:38:20,467
Needless to say,
Marta Ochoa was released unharmed.

236
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,393
And the killing didn't stop.

237
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:34,897
Pablo had tasted blood,
and he liked it.

238
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:22,296
Sending the photos
of the hanging M-19 to the newspapers

239
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,132
gave Pablo an image of invincibility.

240
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:28,428
If he could do this
to the feared communists,

241
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:30,137
he could do it to anyone.

242
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:34,308
Ivan "the Terrible"
was quick to realize...

243
00:40:34,392 --> 00:40:36,477
there was only one thing he could do.

244
00:42:56,659 --> 00:42:58,994
Welcome to the Medellín cartel.

245
00:43:15,803 --> 00:43:19,891
The narcos had their army,
but me and Peña had ours, too.

246
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:22,685
Many Colombians
like Major Horacio Carrillo

247
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:25,772
were so invested
in the future of their country

248
00:43:25,855 --> 00:43:28,858
that they were ready
to do whatever it took to fix it.

249
00:43:31,068 --> 00:43:35,740
This was a war that would shake
an entire country to its foundations.

250
00:43:35,823 --> 00:43:39,535
And in the carnage...
mine would be shaken as well.

251
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,957
Even my wife, Connie,
wanted to help.

252
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:47,460
She got a job as a nurse
in a local comuna.

253
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:50,212
She wanted to make a difference.

254
00:43:50,296 --> 00:43:52,924
I guess she forgot we were in Colombia.

255
00:43:53,007 --> 00:43:56,176
Look, our escolta will drive me
there and back every day.

256
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,763
- Yeah.
- He'll wait outside all day.

257
00:43:58,846 --> 00:44:01,975
You know the last time you were in church
is when we got married.

258
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:04,226
Well, I'm letting the Lord
back into my life.

259
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,394
Hey, stop right here.

260
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:16,071
Praise God.

261
00:44:25,247 --> 00:44:26,624
Perdón.

262
00:44:29,961 --> 00:44:33,464
I want that escolta watching
every inch of you at that comuna now.

263
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,884
Hey, did we leave the door open?

264
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:41,555
Oh, my God, Steve!

265
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:43,641
Get back.

266
00:44:53,651 --> 00:44:55,319
You stay right there
and don't move.
