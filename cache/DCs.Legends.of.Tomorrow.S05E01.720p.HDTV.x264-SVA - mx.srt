00:00:01,047 --> 00:00:02,882
<i>At the Dawn of Time.</i>

2
00:00:06,785 --> 00:00:08,394
Ah!
Aah!

3
00:00:10,316 --> 00:00:11,830
Well,
look who's finally...

4
00:00:11,918 --> 00:00:13,683
Ah!

5
00:00:14,035 --> 00:00:15,738
- Awake.
- Alex.

6
00:00:15,881 --> 00:00:17,627
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

7
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:19,081
- No, no, no, it's okay.
- It's okay.

8
00:00:19,168 --> 00:00:21,223
Are-Are you okay?
Did you have a bad dream?

9
00:00:21,408 --> 00:00:23,715
- I don't know.
- I'm...

10
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,332
How did I get here?

11
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:28,830
Well, you fell asleep
in front of the TV,

12
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:30,330
and you just looked
so peaceful,

13
00:00:30,418 --> 00:00:32,535
so I didn't have the heart
to move you to the bed.

14
00:00:32,629 --> 00:00:35,715
The... the Dawn of Time.

15
00:00:35,808 --> 00:00:37,277
Dawn of Time.

16
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:39,367
Is that what you were
watching before you nodded off?

17
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:43,668
- Wait.
- What is...

18
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:45,170
This isn't right.

19
00:00:45,258 --> 00:00:46,862
Well, I mean, it's right,
but it's not right

20
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:48,674
- because it's right.
- Uh-huh.

21
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:50,761
I see the White Martian
did a number on you last night.

22
00:00:50,848 --> 00:00:51,861
White Martian?

23
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:53,614
White Martian.

24
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:54,808
Listen, I-I gotta run.

25
00:00:54,896 --> 00:00:56,704
Kelly and I are trying out
a new indoor rowing class

26
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:00,916
in downtown, so are you...
you sure you're okay?

27
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:02,176
I'm fine.

28
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:04,113
I'm fine.

29
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,223
Okay.

30
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:10,043
- Alex.
- Yeah?

31
00:01:10,527 --> 00:01:12,074
I love you.

32
00:01:12,683 --> 00:01:13,982
I love you too.

33
00:01:20,465 --> 00:01:21,689
- Nia.
- Kara.

34
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:22,957
It's good to hear your voice.

35
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:24,822
Well, it would be better
to see my face.

36
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,947
Where are you?
The ceremony's about to start.

37
00:01:27,035 --> 00:01:28,080
Ceremony?

38
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:30,714
They're awarding the Nobel
Peace Prize any minute.

39
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,791
Don't worry,
I saved you a seat,

40
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,535
but that lady from the gazette
is giving me angry eyes.

41
00:01:37,378 --> 00:01:39,249
If you miss this,
Andrea's gonna blow a gasket.

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,394
Please take your seats.

43
00:01:41,482 --> 00:01:42,872
Good timing.

44
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:46,612
Hey, uh, I had a really weird
dream last night.

45
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,720
Could you maybe help me
interpret it?

46
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,262
- What happened?
- Oh, uh, the world ended,

47
00:01:51,387 --> 00:01:54,058
but, like, all the worlds.

48
00:01:54,936 --> 00:01:56,416
All of them.

49
00:01:57,026 --> 00:01:59,426
That's dramatic even for us.

50
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:02,385
And now I'm proud
to introduce the winner

51
00:02:02,473 --> 00:02:04,381
of this year's
Nobel Peace Prize,

52
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:05,978
Lex Luthor.

53
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:14,783
Nia, Nia,
am I still dreaming?

54
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:15,902
I know, right.

55
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,828
It is so great when this award
goes to someone

56
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,379
who actually deserves it.

57
00:02:26,286 --> 00:02:29,135
<font color=#FF00FF>*DC's LEGENDS OF TOMORROW*</font>

58
00:02:29,324 --> 00:02:33,166
<font color=#00ff00>Season 05 Episode 01</font>
Title: <font color=#FFc30f>"Crisis on Infinite Earths"</font>

59
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:37,240
We live in dangerous times.

60
00:02:37,715 --> 00:02:40,420
Earth is a dangerous place.

61
00:02:40,854 --> 00:02:44,333
I suppose that's why
people love superheroes so much.

62
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:48,891
The power, the chutzpah
of someone who can

63
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:51,541
fly faster
than a speeding bullet.

64
00:02:52,494 --> 00:02:55,502
But that's what makes this
so special.

65
00:02:55,817 --> 00:02:57,254
I don't have any powers.

66
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,229
I can't leap tall buildings
in a single bound,

67
00:03:00,407 --> 00:03:03,922
but I have dedicated my life
to fighting

68
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,531
on the side of humanity,
and to be recognized for that

69
00:03:07,619 --> 00:03:09,624
is more than I can
put into words,

70
00:03:09,712 --> 00:03:11,752
so I will just say

71
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,776
I stand with mankind.

72
00:03:20,413 --> 00:03:22,285
I'm gonna throw up.

73
00:03:22,463 --> 00:03:23,805
Are you still feeling weird?

74
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:24,949
We should get you
to the med bay.

75
00:03:25,036 --> 00:03:26,339
You did not seem okay
this morning.

76
00:03:26,426 --> 00:03:28,621
- Oh, no, no, I'm fine.
- I'm just disoriented.

77
00:03:28,761 --> 00:03:32,980
T-T-The world is...
what was Lex doing up there?

78
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:34,978
Well, they keep throwing
all these awards at him.

79
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:36,736
He doesn't usually
accept them in person,

80
00:03:36,824 --> 00:03:38,042
but this one
meant a lot to him.

81
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:39,693
People think
he's a good guy?

82
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:42,305
Kara, we're talking about
Lex Luther.

83
00:03:42,504 --> 00:03:43,798
He's the best guy.

84
00:03:43,886 --> 00:03:46,767
- No, he's not.
- He's a psychopathic lunatic.

85
00:03:46,855 --> 00:03:50,035
- What?
- No, he's the boss.

86
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:52,017
And he's your
number one supporter.

87
00:03:52,105 --> 00:03:53,511
I mean, besides Lena.

88
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,173
And all the times that they
defended you to the president...

89
00:03:56,261 --> 00:03:57,777
What has gotten into you.

90
00:03:58,784 --> 00:04:02,236
Hang on, what-wha... wait,
did you just say "boss"?

91
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,909
I don't...

92
00:04:10,058 --> 00:04:11,832
Oh, no, no, no, no.

93
00:04:12,074 --> 00:04:14,554
Alex, are we...

94
00:04:14,774 --> 00:04:15,875
Supergirl.

95
00:04:16,011 --> 00:04:17,138
J'onn.

96
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:19,132
I know
you must be confused.

97
00:04:19,297 --> 00:04:21,822
I was too,
but it happened.

98
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:24,825
It all... happened.

99
00:04:25,172 --> 00:04:26,990
Why are we the only two
that remember?

100
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:28,937
What are we
that they are not?

101
00:04:29,047 --> 00:04:30,353
Paragons.

102
00:04:30,578 --> 00:04:32,375
We helped Oliver
restart the universe.

103
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,619
And this...
is the result.

104
00:04:35,903 --> 00:04:37,861
I suspect there will be
more such changes

105
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:39,362
that are yet
to reveal themselves.

106
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:42,582
Well, there's something
happening downtown.

107
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:44,799
- I'll send a team.
- No, no, no, it's fine.

108
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:46,412
I need to punch something.

109
00:05:03,778 --> 00:05:04,949
Hey.

110
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,004
Look who came
to join the fun.

111
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:09,785
- I'm sorry.
- Who are you?

112
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:11,614
Weather Witch.

113
00:05:12,222 --> 00:05:14,629
And you are no match
for my wrath.

114
00:05:16,573 --> 00:05:19,402
Oh, look, I'm having
not so great a day,

115
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:21,270
which is actually
your bad luck.

116
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,665
Ugh.

117
00:05:22,753 --> 00:05:23,884
Ah!

118
00:05:25,322 --> 00:05:27,674
Sorry, she's one of mine.

119
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:29,673
Well, what's she doing
on my Earth?

120
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,270
What?

121
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,996
Wait, wait, what are
you doing on my Earth?

122
00:05:34,254 --> 00:05:36,903
Your Earth?
This is my Earth.

123
00:05:37,262 --> 00:05:39,246
- I thought...
- I thought...

124
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:44,942
Supergirl, Flash, I just
love it when you guys team up.

125
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,364
Would you sign this
for me please?

126
00:05:47,452 --> 00:05:50,934
- Oh, sure, um...
- Wait, you know both of us?

127
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:54,262
And it's normal to see
us together?

128
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,127
Well, normally
you'd also have

129
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,135
Green Arrow
and a Legend or two.

130
00:05:58,223 --> 00:06:00,096
Last year,
even Batwoman joined in.

131
00:06:00,184 --> 00:06:02,778
Make that out to Marv.
M-A-R-V.

132
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:04,379
- Thank you.
- Marv, M-A-R-V.

133
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:05,815
You're welcome.
Hey Marv,

134
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,416
as far as you know,
how long have Supergirl and I

135
00:06:08,504 --> 00:06:12,494
and all the rest of us
been working... together

136
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:15,229
on... this Earth?

137
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:17,223
Uh, since forever?

138
00:06:20,491 --> 00:06:22,004
Uhh!

139
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,059
The hell?

140
00:06:43,856 --> 00:06:46,114
Call for help.
Now!

141
00:07:03,944 --> 00:07:05,726
How did I get back here?

142
00:07:19,054 --> 00:07:20,631
Ray, where are you?

143
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:25,385
- Hey, Cap, over here.
- Ray.

144
00:07:25,636 --> 00:07:27,480
Hey, hey.

145
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:29,204
Hey, you okay?

146
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:30,878
Not that I'm ever one
to question a hug.

147
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:32,850
What was the last thing
that you remember?

148
00:07:32,938 --> 00:07:35,723
Uh, portaling to this
location on your orders.

149
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:38,596
You don't remember coming
here for trivia night

150
00:07:38,683 --> 00:07:41,207
and being teleported
to an alternate Waverider

151
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,089
to stop the multiverse
from being destroyed?

152
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:44,732
Wait, was there a crossover?

153
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,853
Were we invited?
Did we win?

154
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:48,736
That's certainly
how it looks.

155
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,034
Did you just hear...

156
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:54,034
It's good to see
you're both safe.

157
00:07:54,122 --> 00:07:56,347
J'onn, that's a neat trick.

158
00:07:56,784 --> 00:07:59,747
Wait, you know J'onn Jonnz
from Supergirl's Earth?

159
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,922
Of course I know J'onn.

160
00:08:01,058 --> 00:08:02,597
Wait, go back.

161
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:04,658
Supergirl has her own Earth?

162
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:06,628
Not anymore.

163
00:08:07,706 --> 00:08:10,558
When we restarted the universe,
our worlds combined,

164
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,319
and only we Paragons know
it was ever any different.

165
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:16,126
Okay, sorry, guy,
I'm a little lost here.

166
00:08:16,214 --> 00:08:18,214
Here, this'll be faster.

167
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:25,284
Whoa,
there was a multiverse.

168
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:26,409
It all got destroyed.

169
00:08:26,497 --> 00:08:27,454
There's an evil Batman,

170
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:29,339
and there's a me
that's a super me?

171
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:30,456
It'll take him some time

172
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,167
to assimilate
to this new paradigm.

173
00:08:32,284 --> 00:08:34,204
I have been going
from city to city

174
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:36,823
restoring the memories of
our compatriots as best I can.

175
00:08:36,911 --> 00:08:38,480
And what about Oliver?

176
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:41,456
There's been no sign of him.

177
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,821
Hey, where are you going?

178
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:47,300
To find my friend.

179
00:08:51,836 --> 00:08:53,230
Oliver!

180
00:08:57,218 --> 00:08:58,784
Oliver!

181
00:09:11,337 --> 00:09:12,456
Sara.

182
00:09:14,558 --> 00:09:16,035
I need to talk to you guys...

183
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,151
We already know.

184
00:09:18,716 --> 00:09:20,167
We already know.

185
00:09:20,636 --> 00:09:22,118
Martian J'onn came by

186
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:23,980
and gave us
a splitting headache.

187
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,618
It all happened, didn't it?

188
00:09:29,732 --> 00:09:31,566
He died twice, Sara.

189
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:33,581
Yeah.

190
00:09:34,714 --> 00:09:38,511
I wasn't there
both times.

191
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:42,620
Both times I failed him.

192
00:09:42,776 --> 00:09:44,917
- Dig, you...
- I'm so sorry.

193
00:09:45,548 --> 00:09:46,831
It's okay.

194
00:09:48,584 --> 00:09:50,214
I wasn't there.

195
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:54,628
He was my brother.

196
00:09:56,124 --> 00:09:57,292
I know.

197
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,373
Listen to me.

198
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,653
Look, we all... we all died,

199
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:06,318
the entire universe,
the multiverse.

200
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:08,138
Now we're back

201
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:11,865
that means, Oliver,
he might be back too.

202
00:10:15,905 --> 00:10:17,552
After the brain dump...

203
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:21,191
We had Felicity run
a global search.

204
00:10:21,584 --> 00:10:23,804
I mean, nobody's better
at finding people,

205
00:10:24,162 --> 00:10:26,241
but they've got to be here
to be found.

206
00:10:26,388 --> 00:10:27,724
You don't know.

207
00:10:27,812 --> 00:10:31,123
Look, when Oliver died,
he became something else.

208
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:33,933
He... he-he called it the Spectre.

209
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:37,177
Then maybe, Felicity, she just
can't find him in that form.

210
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:40,856
Dig, she just can't find him

211
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:42,191
- in this form...
- Sara...

212
00:10:48,204 --> 00:10:49,814
Sara, gone is gone.

213
00:10:50,908 --> 00:10:52,076
He's gone.

214
00:11:20,364 --> 00:11:23,169
J'onn,
what are you doing here?

215
00:11:23,257 --> 00:11:24,277
Is something wrong?

216
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:27,732
Not anymore,
no thanks to him.

217
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:29,927
Do you know why
he's like this?

218
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,533
And now so do you.

219
00:11:34,635 --> 00:11:35,643
Oliver!

220
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:44,899
This is all his fault.

221
00:11:45,277 --> 00:11:47,409
He's the one who released
the Anti-Monitor.

222
00:11:47,688 --> 00:11:50,107
He paid dearly
for his misjudgment,

223
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:52,821
but not as much
as some others.

224
00:11:53,204 --> 00:11:54,899
Ah!
Aah.

225
00:11:56,323 --> 00:11:58,369
What happened?
Where am I?

226
00:11:58,563 --> 00:12:00,024
How did I get here?

227
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:04,860
You nearly damned us
all to hell, Nash Wells!

228
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:06,860
Well, that's an introduction.

229
00:12:06,948 --> 00:12:08,988
Who the hell are you
and what are you talking about?

230
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:10,544
You need to stay calm.
Your system's still

231
00:12:10,632 --> 00:12:13,669
- recovering.
- You... you need to calm down.

232
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,282
I'm not gonna stay here,

233
00:12:15,422 --> 00:12:17,401
get lectured by
some government suit who...

234
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:26,048
God.

235
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,680
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

236
00:12:31,768 --> 00:12:35,957
- And so you should be.
- This is all your fault!

237
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,322
It is my fault.

238
00:12:38,983 --> 00:12:41,806
But you... you solved it.

239
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,813
You and the others,
you saved the universe.

240
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:45,915
You fixed my mistake.

241
00:12:46,778 --> 00:12:48,142
Right?

242
00:12:48,804 --> 00:12:50,632
Not entirely.

243
00:12:55,103 --> 00:12:56,321
It's true.

244
00:12:56,462 --> 00:12:58,751
We all live
on the same Earth now.

245
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:00,014
Our Earths must have merged

246
00:13:00,102 --> 00:13:01,547
when we helped Oliver
reboot the universe.

247
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:02,815
I can't believe it.

248
00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:04,026
What are you guys doing here?

249
00:13:04,113 --> 00:13:05,768
I had to see if it was true.

250
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:08,440
The DEO, CatCo,
all of National City

251
00:13:08,528 --> 00:13:10,661
is on this Earth now.
Even Argo's up there.

252
00:13:10,928 --> 00:13:13,822
We did it.
We saved everyone.

253
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:15,666
Not everyone.

254
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:23,783
Oliver.

255
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:26,651
He didn't make it.

256
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,798
Guess we just
have to face facts.

257
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:34,111
No, that's not... that's...

258
00:13:34,424 --> 00:13:37,807
Why did he give everyone else
a fresh start but not himself?

259
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:41,002
Maybe this was
the only way, Kara.

260
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:44,580
Maybe his sacrifice
made all of this possible.

261
00:13:47,218 --> 00:13:48,729
Him for us.

262
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:55,088
- What is that?
- We're being attacked.

263
00:13:55,176 --> 00:13:56,322
By who?

264
00:14:01,657 --> 00:14:03,736
You wouldn't believe it
if I told you.

265
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:16,533
<i>It's a giant Beebo.</i>

266
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:19,955
Beebo hungry.

267
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:28,299
How the hell
did Beebo get here?

268
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:29,487
Isn't the more
pressing question

269
00:14:29,574 --> 00:14:31,611
why is there a giant Beebo
walking down the street?

270
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,893
Well, this wouldn't be
the first time.

271
00:14:34,037 --> 00:14:35,091
It's a long story.

272
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:36,781
That's right.
Wally told us about

273
00:14:36,869 --> 00:14:38,460
the time you guys used
those totems to turn

274
00:14:38,548 --> 00:14:40,769
yourselves into a giant Beebo
to fight a time demon.

275
00:14:40,857 --> 00:14:42,046
I guess it's not
a long story.

276
00:14:42,134 --> 00:14:43,804
Could that be
what's happening here?

277
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:45,454
Ava, Nate, you there?

278
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:47,569
I need a twenty
on Behrad and his totem.

279
00:14:47,657 --> 00:14:49,280
Sara, are you okay?

280
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:51,500
Ray called us to tell us you
were on some special mission.

281
00:14:51,587 --> 00:14:52,849
But he's a little flimsy
with the deets,

282
00:14:52,936 --> 00:14:54,100
so what's the haps, Cap?

283
00:14:54,188 --> 00:14:56,374
Yeah, we've been busy
saving the multiverse.

284
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:59,059
You got shanghaied into
another crossover, didn't you?

285
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:02,100
Hmm, yeah, kind of.

286
00:15:02,188 --> 00:15:03,647
Whoa, whoa.
Id they kidnap you?

287
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:05,127
This is
a classic crossover move.

288
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,413
We tell 'em we're too busy,
they commit a felony.

289
00:15:07,501 --> 00:15:10,577
Guys, Beebo is rampaging
through Star City.

290
00:15:10,665 --> 00:15:12,101
Does Behrad have his totem?

291
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:13,944
- Beebo?
- That doesn't make any sense.

292
00:15:14,032 --> 00:15:15,484
You would need all six totems
to make that happen,

293
00:15:15,571 --> 00:15:17,195
and Behrad's definitely
still on the ship.

294
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:18,196
All right, I gotta go.

295
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,282
Wait, do you need help?

296
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,501
No, stay in DC.

297
00:15:20,596 --> 00:15:21,579
I don't want any more
of my people

298
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:23,001
getting roped
into this mess.

299
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,440
Well, here's the thing.
Um.

300
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:27,468
One of us is
kind of already there.

301
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:29,495
Who?

302
00:15:29,827 --> 00:15:32,233
And who should I
make this out to?

303
00:15:32,321 --> 00:15:33,249
Doris.

304
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:35,731
I'm such a huge fan, Rebecca.

305
00:15:35,896 --> 00:15:37,811
I mean, what should I call you?

306
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:39,466
Rebecca's fine.

307
00:15:39,554 --> 00:15:41,643
To Doris.

308
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:45,651
Thanks for the passion, love...

309
00:15:59,851 --> 00:16:01,113
Fur ball.

310
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,783
Oh my.

311
00:16:07,027 --> 00:16:09,658
Oh, man, I can't believe
Nate's gonna miss seeing Beebo.

312
00:16:09,746 --> 00:16:11,236
He's gonna be so jealous.

313
00:16:11,324 --> 00:16:12,588
Here he comes.

314
00:16:12,784 --> 00:16:13,906
What's the plan?

315
00:16:14,866 --> 00:16:16,433
Smile, Beebo.

316
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,026
What?
Are you...

317
00:16:18,114 --> 00:16:19,799
Oh, sorry,
you guys don't wanna be in it?

318
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:21,221
Oh, bad timing.

319
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:23,000
Is this seriously
happening right now?

320
00:16:23,088 --> 00:16:24,451
Well, maybe
it's a good thing.

321
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:26,237
Guess we could all
use the distraction.

322
00:16:26,348 --> 00:16:28,462
Right, compartmentalize,
focus on the work, good idea.

323
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:30,159
Guys, Beebo's still
on the warpath.

324
00:16:30,247 --> 00:16:32,513
Any suggestions on
how we take him down?

325
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:34,756
Hey, what is that?

326
00:16:34,843 --> 00:16:36,758
- That's a utility truck.
- Why?

327
00:16:36,924 --> 00:16:39,213
Are you guys ready to do
a tag team trip up?

328
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:40,643
- Yeah.
- What do you have in mind?

329
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,111
All right, Supergirl,
Atom, keep him contained.

330
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,766
Flash, use those cables
to your left.

331
00:16:44,854 --> 00:16:46,014
- Got it. Can do.
- All right.

332
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:51,416
Beebo want cuddles!

333
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,440
Is this actually happening?

334
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,250
Is this what all
the crossovers are like?

335
00:16:56,338 --> 00:16:57,617
Yes and not exactly.

336
00:16:57,704 --> 00:16:59,674
I'm never letting my child
watch that show again.

337
00:17:00,017 --> 00:17:01,031
Done.

338
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,455
All right,
now get him moving.

339
00:17:02,596 --> 00:17:04,149
Die, fur ball!

340
00:17:04,237 --> 00:17:05,352
Mick?

341
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,747
That blue bastard
ruined my book signing!

342
00:17:09,407 --> 00:17:11,961
Okay,
everybody get ready to pull.

343
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,897
- Here, take it.
- Take it.

344
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:14,895
Ow.

345
00:17:14,982 --> 00:17:17,709
- The bigger they are...
- The harder they...

346
00:17:17,797 --> 00:17:18,986
Fall!

347
00:17:19,073 --> 00:17:20,117
Ah!

348
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:21,584
- Ugh.
- Whoa, whoa.

349
00:17:21,672 --> 00:17:24,055
Oh, thanks Supergirl.

350
00:17:24,782 --> 00:17:26,375
What the hell?

351
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:30,834
Guys, something's off.

352
00:17:30,922 --> 00:17:32,389
I'm not reading
any known elements,

353
00:17:32,477 --> 00:17:33,782
nothing off the periodic table.

354
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:38,905
I don't think
the rules apply

355
00:17:38,993 --> 00:17:40,512
to 50-foot talking plush toy.

356
00:17:41,105 --> 00:17:42,612
Hey, hey, Kate's here too.

357
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,065
That's... uh, sorry.
What were you saying?

358
00:17:46,907 --> 00:17:48,493
It's unnatural.

359
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:49,727
Alien?

360
00:17:49,815 --> 00:17:51,112
- Hey.
- Or magic?

361
00:17:51,217 --> 00:17:52,642
Sara, don't you
and the Legends deal with

362
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:53,969
that kind of stuff
all the time?

363
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:56,057
Or maybe it's just here
to keep us talking.

364
00:17:56,252 --> 00:17:57,720
A diversion.

365
00:17:57,955 --> 00:17:59,539
But for what?

366
00:17:59,627 --> 00:18:01,095
I know what I'd do.

367
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,797
It is finally time
for Sargon the Sorcerer

368
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:10,516
to claim his reward!

369
00:18:10,939 --> 00:18:13,561
Oh, and buy that beautiful
timeshare in Bogota.

370
00:18:16,877 --> 00:18:19,000
Come on, man, Beebo?

371
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:20,383
Is nothing sacred?

372
00:18:20,471 --> 00:18:21,750
You know, it's a smart move.

373
00:18:21,838 --> 00:18:23,224
Distracting all the fuzz

374
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:26,181
with giant fuzz, but someone
should have told you.

375
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:29,244
Beebo, he's off limits.

376
00:18:34,454 --> 00:18:36,408
Beebo!

377
00:18:36,496 --> 00:18:37,502
Oh!

378
00:18:38,723 --> 00:18:39,666
Got him again.

379
00:18:39,754 --> 00:18:41,712
Pee-ew.

380
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:45,665
So how normal
was that for everyone?

381
00:18:45,753 --> 00:18:46,956
And don't say very.

382
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:49,167
Oh, well, with this
new Earth, just may be.

383
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:51,433
Well, dear God, I hope not.

384
00:18:54,215 --> 00:18:55,466
What is that?

385
00:18:55,874 --> 00:18:56,972
Alcohol.

386
00:19:00,195 --> 00:19:01,518
Mm.

387
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:03,866
Rory, huh?

388
00:19:04,072 --> 00:19:06,236
We had a Rory once
on our team.

389
00:19:06,753 --> 00:19:08,112
We did.

390
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:10,847
What's this?

391
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:12,649
Was there a memo
that went out

392
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:14,251
on how to infiltrate
our secret bunker?

393
00:19:14,338 --> 00:19:15,658
Why are you here?

394
00:19:15,768 --> 00:19:17,539
- I'm here to warn you.
- You see this?

395
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:19,891
This gauntlet is primed
to detect antimatter

396
00:19:19,979 --> 00:19:22,673
of which there has been
a massive surge

397
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,360
in the Star City area.

398
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:26,201
Okay, well, you're about
two hours too late.

399
00:19:26,318 --> 00:19:27,644
Yeah,
already took care of it.

400
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:30,446
- Did you really?
- My readings say different.

401
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:31,777
This thing ain't over.

402
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:34,784
As a matter of fact,
it's just beginning.

403
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:42,201
Something's not right.

404
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:43,173
- That thing still working?
- Yeah, it's working.

405
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:44,447
I built it myself.
It's infallible.

406
00:19:44,534 --> 00:19:47,159
Yeah, but you're still
detecting traces of antimatter.

407
00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:49,058
Then our fight
isn't done, is it?

408
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,222
No.

409
00:19:50,318 --> 00:19:53,769
Or worse, it's starting up
all over again.

410
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:03,166
Hey.

411
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,384
How'd you find me?

412
00:20:06,136 --> 00:20:08,689
You feel that gust of wind
a few seconds ago?

413
00:20:08,784 --> 00:20:09,868
That was me.

414
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:12,274
I did a quick search
of the whole city for you.

415
00:20:13,618 --> 00:20:16,181
When you didn't come back
for the post-Beebo celebration,

416
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:17,806
I got a little worried.

417
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:19,594
Yeah.

418
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:23,884
See that tree over there?

419
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:26,523
My sister and I,
we used to race to the top

420
00:20:26,611 --> 00:20:27,751
when we were little.

421
00:20:28,084 --> 00:20:29,825
I'd win every time.

422
00:20:31,844 --> 00:20:33,964
I used to think it was
because I was a better climber,

423
00:20:34,103 --> 00:20:37,642
but... now I think
Laurel let me win

424
00:20:38,602 --> 00:20:41,360
'cause she knew
I was a sore loser.

425
00:20:43,312 --> 00:20:45,571
A lot has changed since then.

426
00:20:46,844 --> 00:20:48,726
I was an assassin.

427
00:20:49,618 --> 00:20:54,039
I was dead, now I'm the captain
of a friggin' time ship.

428
00:20:54,727 --> 00:20:58,889
One thing remains the same.
I'm still a sore loser.

429
00:21:01,977 --> 00:21:05,266
I know it's...
it's hard

430
00:21:05,438 --> 00:21:08,118
not having Oliver here
with us.

431
00:21:08,907 --> 00:21:11,743
But look at what
his sacrifice made possible.

432
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:15,688
Our world is... it's different...

433
00:21:17,258 --> 00:21:18,844
But at least it's safe.

434
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:26,672
He was just the last tether
to my old life, you know?

435
00:21:28,616 --> 00:21:31,741
And he was the only person left
who knew me

436
00:21:31,829 --> 00:21:35,774
when I was just... me.

437
00:21:36,555 --> 00:21:40,014
With him gone,
my connection to this world,

438
00:21:40,102 --> 00:21:44,516
this place, to that tree...

439
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:47,297
It's gone.

440
00:21:49,735 --> 00:21:53,079
I know what it's like to
lose family.

441
00:21:54,868 --> 00:21:57,423
My mom, my dad,

442
00:21:57,946 --> 00:21:59,783
each death felt like

443
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:03,252
there was no moving forward,
like...

444
00:22:04,188 --> 00:22:06,158
..life would never be the same.

445
00:22:08,423 --> 00:22:10,189
And I was right
it's not the same,

446
00:22:10,277 --> 00:22:14,377
but... somehow it's okay.

447
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:17,891
Family isn't just the people
that you grew up with.

448
00:22:17,978 --> 00:22:21,585
It's the people you find,
the ones you love,

449
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,337
ones that make you crazy...

450
00:22:24,463 --> 00:22:25,931
..make you smile.

451
00:22:27,705 --> 00:22:30,364
When did you get so wise?

452
00:22:34,184 --> 00:22:37,120
The Legends,
they are my family.

453
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,270
They have been for a while.

454
00:22:39,427 --> 00:22:43,274
I guess I just... I always
thought there would be

455
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:46,690
at least someone who remembered
what I was like

456
00:22:46,778 --> 00:22:48,454
before I got on that boat.

457
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,135
I thought we got rid
of all those things.

458
00:23:07,223 --> 00:23:10,380
Barry, Sara,
the shadow demons are back.

459
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,003
I believe we are being hunted.

460
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:15,427
If they're hunting
the Paragons, that means...

461
00:23:16,264 --> 00:23:17,483
Ryan.

462
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:35,237
- Sara?
- What the hell's going on?

463
00:23:35,325 --> 00:23:37,067
You have to come with me
now.

464
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:41,619
All right, Barry, J'onn,
Supergirl, and Batlady

465
00:23:41,707 --> 00:23:42,899
are gathering the troops.

466
00:23:42,986 --> 00:23:45,143
Those attacks were probably
just the first wave.

467
00:23:45,231 --> 00:23:47,651
Assassins sent
to pick us off in pairs.

468
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:49,602
How are the shadow demons
even still here?

469
00:23:49,689 --> 00:23:51,637
Didn't Oliver destroy the guy
who controls them?

470
00:23:51,777 --> 00:23:53,322
Well, not according
to the surge

471
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,129
in antimatter energy
I'm reading.

472
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,317
The Anti-Monitor is alive?

473
00:23:58,175 --> 00:24:01,028
But you said Oliver
sacrificed himself

474
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:02,426
to create this new world.

475
00:24:02,514 --> 00:24:05,256
Apparently, his sacrifice
didn't kill the Anti-Monitor.

476
00:24:05,832 --> 00:24:07,097
Well, then how do we do that?

477
00:24:07,184 --> 00:24:09,723
Well, let's just throw him
into the sun

478
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,362
and let the bastard burn.

479
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,886
Oh yeah, let's throw him
in the sun

480
00:24:12,973 --> 00:24:14,931
and cause
an antimatter explosion

481
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:16,411
that obliterates
the solar system.

482
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:17,891
You know what,
let's not do that.

483
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:19,987
At least he's trying
to offer up a solution

484
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:21,634
instead of being
the cause of the problem.

485
00:24:21,721 --> 00:24:23,776
- That's the solution?
- Blow up the solar system?

486
00:24:23,864 --> 00:24:27,184
Okay guys, guys, we're all
on the same team, okay?

487
00:24:27,514 --> 00:24:29,465
No, Scrappy's right.

488
00:24:29,757 --> 00:24:31,221
It's my fault
we're in this mess.

489
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:33,127
We gotta fix it.
Gotta fix it.

490
00:24:33,215 --> 00:24:35,135
It's just a little tricky.

491
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,463
The Anti-Monitor
is made of antimatter,

492
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:38,612
and, like its opposite,

493
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,457
it can neither be created
nor destroyed.

494
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,127
- It can only...
- Change form

495
00:24:42,215 --> 00:24:43,652
and move
from place to place.

496
00:24:43,785 --> 00:24:45,396
So what if we do
just that?

497
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,573
What if we could set off
a chain reaction

498
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,080
that will
destabilize his form?

499
00:24:49,168 --> 00:24:51,486
Compressing his molecules
so he's essentially

500
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,230
shrinking for eternity.

501
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:55,035
Is that kind of reaction
even possible?

502
00:24:55,123 --> 00:24:56,039
Sure it is.

503
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,572
I did it a bunch of times by
accident

504
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,361
when I was developing
my ATOM exosuit.

505
00:24:59,449 --> 00:25:01,307
So you think you can keep him
shrinking indefinitely?

506
00:25:01,394 --> 00:25:04,134
Essentially, we'd be
sending him to the "atomverse."

507
00:25:04,222 --> 00:25:05,982
I like to call it
the Microverse.

508
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:07,394
Ah, that's better.

509
00:25:07,482 --> 00:25:09,167
Possible trademark issues,
but that's better.

510
00:25:09,254 --> 00:25:11,814
He could get stuck there
for, like, ever.

511
00:25:11,902 --> 00:25:13,791
In theory
it could totally work.

512
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,916
But developing
a device in time...

513
00:25:16,004 --> 00:25:17,173
Leave that to me, D-League.

514
00:25:17,261 --> 00:25:20,043
I just gotta get to STAR Labs.
Scrappy.

515
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:24,047
Look, if this goes down
anything like it did

516
00:25:24,143 --> 00:25:27,751
on Earth-38, then things
are gonna get messy.

517
00:25:28,097 --> 00:25:30,180
Geek team, get on it.

518
00:25:30,347 --> 00:25:32,531
Mick, go with 'em,
keep 'em safe.

519
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:36,879
The rest of us, we'll need to
hold back this incoming army.

520
00:25:42,285 --> 00:25:44,064
Hey, this can work, Sara.

521
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,597
I know it can.

522
00:25:46,215 --> 00:25:49,011
That's what we thought
back at the Dawn of Time.

523
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,519
Here we are
back at square one.

524
00:25:51,742 --> 00:25:53,949
This new Earth
isn't square one.

525
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:57,338
It's what Oliver gave up
his life to create.

526
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,410
We have to protect it.

527
00:26:00,907 --> 00:26:02,402
If we're gonna go down...

528
00:26:04,172 --> 00:26:05,824
We go down fighting.

529
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:14,834
All right, listen up.

530
00:26:14,922 --> 00:26:16,697
I got a ton of those
shadow things descending

531
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:18,754
- on Gardner Pier.
- Copy, we're en route.

532
00:26:20,504 --> 00:26:21,722
This is new.

533
00:26:22,043 --> 00:26:23,783
New world, new look.

534
00:26:23,871 --> 00:26:25,347
Cut the chatter,
they're here.

535
00:26:52,841 --> 00:26:54,484
What the hell?

536
00:26:54,611 --> 00:26:55,632
Was that it?

537
00:26:59,421 --> 00:27:01,765
It's not over yet.

538
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:14,632
Paragons, the universal
safeguard meant to thwart me.

539
00:27:15,588 --> 00:27:18,031
It is time to meet your end!

540
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:21,919
We'll need a reinforced core
to contain the reaction.

541
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:22,858
Titanium?

542
00:27:22,946 --> 00:27:23,921
No, that's too heavy.

543
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,046
What we need... what
we need is...

544
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:29,781
Depleted promethium.

545
00:27:30,534 --> 00:27:33,129
STAR Labs, I've got shadows
advancing on your position.

546
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:34,327
On it.

547
00:27:34,415 --> 00:27:36,382
- It's been a while, Frosty.
- You look good.

548
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,299
- Thanks.
- I read your book, Rebecca.

549
00:27:39,387 --> 00:27:42,140
- Which one?
- I'm very prolific.

550
00:27:45,687 --> 00:27:46,752
Whoa.

551
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,344
Do you wanna take this guy,
or should I?

552
00:27:48,431 --> 00:27:49,432
Ladies first.

553
00:27:49,732 --> 00:27:50,949
Age before beauty.

554
00:27:51,101 --> 00:27:52,140
Mm.

555
00:27:57,851 --> 00:27:59,200
Who the hell are you?

556
00:27:59,351 --> 00:28:01,107
Guy who just saved your ass.

557
00:28:01,195 --> 00:28:02,257
We had that covered.

558
00:28:02,345 --> 00:28:03,422
Sure you did.

559
00:28:04,774 --> 00:28:06,891
- Company's coming.
- You ready?

560
00:28:07,226 --> 00:28:08,789
I stay ready.

561
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:13,415
I am destiny incarnate,

562
00:28:13,606 --> 00:28:17,407
inexorable and inescapable.

563
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,165
You are nothing.

564
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:23,897
Insects fated to be crushed
beneath my heel

565
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:26,086
without a moment's thought.

566
00:28:26,314 --> 00:28:27,969
Fighting is useless.

567
00:28:28,918 --> 00:28:30,375
Surrender.

568
00:28:33,867 --> 00:28:36,665
- Not today.
- Not ever.

569
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:41,154
Oliver died so that
we could continue to fight.

570
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:44,192
He sacrificed everything
for this new world,

571
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:46,625
and we will not fail him.

572
00:28:46,868 --> 00:28:49,266
We will not fail this world.

573
00:28:50,327 --> 00:28:51,633
For Oliver.

574
00:28:51,721 --> 00:28:53,687
- For Oliver.
- For Oliver.

575
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:54,907
For Oliver!

576
00:28:54,995 --> 00:28:56,487
- For Oliver! - For Oliver!
- For Oliver! - For Oliver!

577
00:29:54,068 --> 00:29:58,583
The age of heroes ends now!

578
00:30:00,662 --> 00:30:03,622
Guys, we're gonna need
a bigger bomb.

579
00:30:03,864 --> 00:30:05,822
Sky team, with me.

580
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:24,678
Ray,
how's that shrink bomb coming?

581
00:30:25,044 --> 00:30:26,872
Well, we could really use
some fast hands.

582
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,141
Could we ever.

583
00:30:28,229 --> 00:30:29,663
Barry.

584
00:30:42,976 --> 00:30:44,891
Supergirl, look out!

585
00:30:46,534 --> 00:30:47,680
J'onn!

586
00:30:52,939 --> 00:30:54,641
Where are you from, Sparkles?

587
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:57,295
- Don't call me Sparkles.
- I'm from Freeland.

588
00:30:57,453 --> 00:31:00,320
Martian came, got in my head,
told me y'all were caught up.

589
00:31:00,468 --> 00:31:02,775
It's been a weird day.

590
00:31:06,478 --> 00:31:08,195
That's an understatement.

591
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:11,913
All right, what
are we making?

592
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:13,920
- All right, so plans, right?
- Yep.

593
00:31:14,008 --> 00:31:15,091
Now, this is what
we have to build.

594
00:31:15,135 --> 00:31:17,045
Now, these pieces are all
very volatile.

595
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:18,756
Be...

596
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:20,270
- How's this look?
- Okay, that's good.

597
00:31:20,357 --> 00:31:21,881
- Whoa.
- Love when he does that.

598
00:31:21,968 --> 00:31:23,016
That's perfect, actually.

599
00:31:23,104 --> 00:31:25,897
Okay, so now all we have to do
is get it into direct contact

600
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:27,579
with the Anti-Monitor
once we've activated it.

601
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:29,015
Okay, and to activate it
I just press this button?

602
00:31:29,102 --> 00:31:30,078
- No don't touch that!
- Are you crazy?

603
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:32,046
All right, okay,
relax, relax.

604
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:33,544
All right, Ray,
you're coming with me.

605
00:31:33,631 --> 00:31:34,914
Oh, cool.

606
00:31:46,427 --> 00:31:47,539
No!

607
00:31:47,627 --> 00:31:48,950
Shadows are
on the move again.

608
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:50,375
Pérez Landing.

609
00:31:52,805 --> 00:31:54,281
- Yeah, we know.
- We're here.

610
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,395
Barry.

611
00:32:10,498 --> 00:32:11,467
Bomb's ready.

612
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:12,991
Ray's running it
to the sky team.

613
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,840
We're running
out of time here, Ray.

614
00:32:14,928 --> 00:32:16,587
- Hurry!
- Hurrying.

615
00:32:45,442 --> 00:32:46,959
Hope I'm not too late.

616
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,162
- Ray?
- Hang on, Superman.

617
00:32:57,957 --> 00:32:59,160
Throw it like a girl.

618
00:33:01,589 --> 00:33:02,895
Always.

619
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:14,035
How did you... no!

620
00:33:24,024 --> 00:33:25,571
- We did it.
- We did it!

621
00:33:25,831 --> 00:33:27,366
Wait, but where's Kal?

622
00:33:27,454 --> 00:33:28,657
I'm right here.

623
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,018
Whoa.

624
00:33:31,055 --> 00:33:33,813
- Sorry about that, Superman.
- Here you go.

625
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:40,834
Thank you, Ollie.

626
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,653
My fellow Americans,

627
00:33:45,786 --> 00:33:50,364
today our way of life,
our world,

628
00:33:50,452 --> 00:33:52,522
almost came to an end.

629
00:33:52,716 --> 00:33:56,574
An entity known as
the Anti-Monitor

630
00:33:56,677 --> 00:33:58,327
attacked Earth

631
00:33:58,506 --> 00:34:00,834
<i>intent on its destruction.</i>

632
00:34:01,616 --> 00:34:03,270
<i>Thankfully, we were saved</i>

633
00:34:03,358 --> 00:34:06,819
<i>by Earth's greatest heroes
who came together...</i>

634
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,037
- Hey, Sara.
- Hey, sweetie.

635
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:09,679
- Baby, come over here.
- ..<i>we never before...</i>

636
00:34:09,766 --> 00:34:11,488
Your brother wants
to play with you.

637
00:34:12,122 --> 00:34:14,150
<i>..Their unity and strength</i>

638
00:34:14,238 --> 00:34:16,447
<i>should be an example
for us all.</i>

639
00:34:16,535 --> 00:34:22,111
<i>I'm told this assembly was led
by Star City's Oliver Queen</i>

640
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:25,559
<i>otherwise known
as the Green Arrow.</i>

641
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:29,196
<i>We give thanks
to these brave women and men</i>

642
00:34:29,363 --> 00:34:32,721
who, with great tenacity,
tireless work,

643
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:37,213
<i>and the utmost courage,
put their lives on the line</i>

644
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:40,769
<i>for our country, our planet.</i>

645
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,080
Hey, Lois.

646
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:47,075
Clark, I need you to get
to Metropolis now.

647
00:34:47,163 --> 00:34:48,251
It's the boys.

648
00:34:49,259 --> 00:34:50,525
The boys?

649
00:34:50,675 --> 00:34:52,489
Yeah, honey, your sons.

650
00:34:56,184 --> 00:34:58,807
<i>While in
a hard-fought battle,</i>

651
00:34:58,895 --> 00:35:00,721
<i>loss is expected.</i>

652
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:02,988
<i>It never gets any easier,</i>

653
00:35:03,098 --> 00:35:06,510
<i>so it is with great sadness</i>

654
00:35:06,598 --> 00:35:10,057
<i>that I must inform you
that Oliver Queen</i>

655
00:35:10,145 --> 00:35:14,463
<i>sacrificed his life
for our world's survival.</i>

656
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:16,762
<i>He is known to us</i>

657
00:35:16,855 --> 00:35:19,488
<i>as the first of our heroes,</i>

658
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:23,277
<i>and while this is
a devastating loss,</i>

659
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:25,947
<i>we can take solace
in knowing</i>

660
00:35:26,035 --> 00:35:28,637
<i>that he lived
as he died,</i>

661
00:35:29,066 --> 00:35:30,590
<i>with honor.</i>

662
00:35:31,121 --> 00:35:34,103
<i>I ask all of you to join me</i>

663
00:35:34,191 --> 00:35:37,184
<i>in a moment of silence
to honor him now.</i>

664
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:57,293
A grateful nation thanks you,
Mr. Queen.

665
00:35:57,965 --> 00:36:02,051
May you finally find rest
in the hereafter.

666
00:36:02,652 --> 00:36:04,223
God bless you,

667
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:08,121
and God bless
the United States of America.

668
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,770
Good night.

669
00:36:12,176 --> 00:36:14,660
In the end,
there was only one,

670
00:36:14,949 --> 00:36:16,887
a single black infinitude.

671
00:36:18,106 --> 00:36:20,260
Then the infinitude
found release.

672
00:36:25,027 --> 00:36:27,606
And finally,
the darkness broke,

673
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:30,236
filling it with life...

674
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:35,559
With the multiverse.

675
00:36:39,051 --> 00:36:42,754
Every existence
multiplied by possibility.

676
00:36:47,027 --> 00:36:51,356
And spread out before space
and time in infinite measure.

677
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:01,121
Civilizations
rose and fell...

678
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,434
And rose again across
reality's grasping expanse.

679
00:37:10,824 --> 00:37:13,684
Life, a precious gift,
persevering

680
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:16,910
in the face
of every obstacle...

681
00:37:26,526 --> 00:37:28,566
Until, finally,

682
00:37:29,892 --> 00:37:32,246
the age of heroes was born

683
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:41,814
Thanks for saving us,
Oliver.

684
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:44,215
The world has hope again.

685
00:37:45,949 --> 00:37:47,515
I have hope again.

686
00:37:48,274 --> 00:37:49,965
We'll never forget you.

687
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:02,191
Thanks for believing in me
even when I didn't.

688
00:38:03,816 --> 00:38:05,417
You had this way of

689
00:38:05,895 --> 00:38:08,176
bringing out
the very best in all of us.

690
00:38:10,915 --> 00:38:12,606
I'm gonna miss you, man.

691
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,707
I've lost a lot of people
that I love.

692
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:29,992
But I never imagined my life
without you in it.

693
00:38:30,926 --> 00:38:32,824
You were always there for me.

694
00:38:32,947 --> 00:38:34,426
And now...

695
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:42,699
Ollie, you changed my fate
for the better.

696
00:38:44,434 --> 00:38:45,785
Thank you.

697
00:39:14,777 --> 00:39:19,606
I never met Oliver, but he
must have been a good dude.

698
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,503
But why'd you choose
a condemned building?

699
00:39:31,591 --> 00:39:32,853
What?

700
00:39:32,941 --> 00:39:35,145
No, this is not
a condemned building.

701
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:38,635
No, listen, this is an old
STAR Labs Research Facility

702
00:39:38,723 --> 00:39:40,652
that nobody uses,
and what's even better,

703
00:39:40,863 --> 00:39:42,346
no one knows it exists.

704
00:39:42,434 --> 00:39:43,994
- Good for you.
- No, good for us.

705
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:46,684
I figure we could all
use this to gather

706
00:39:47,026 --> 00:39:48,949
if anything ever happens again.

707
00:39:49,037 --> 00:39:51,271
- It's a great idea, Barry.
- Thanks, Superman.

708
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,215
It's a better option than
you all dropping by the DEO.

709
00:39:54,303 --> 00:39:55,713
Why do we even need it?

710
00:39:55,801 --> 00:39:57,297
I mean, how often does
the world

711
00:39:57,385 --> 00:39:59,076
almost come to an end?

712
00:40:02,951 --> 00:40:04,401
Oh, it's like that.

713
00:40:04,584 --> 00:40:06,794
Don't worry,
I was the new kid last year.

714
00:40:07,287 --> 00:40:08,523
All right, listen,
I haven't even shown you guys

715
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,623
the best part yet.
You ready?

716
00:40:17,691 --> 00:40:19,295
Oh, nice.

717
00:40:32,123 --> 00:40:33,554
You should have
led with that, bro.

718
00:40:33,642 --> 00:40:34,774
Yeah.

719
00:40:34,862 --> 00:40:36,756
- Not bad.
- I love it.

720
00:40:40,862 --> 00:40:42,420
It's perfect.

721
00:41:19,107 --> 00:41:21,672
Sounds like we need
to call pest control.

722
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,474
What was that?

723
00:41:35,824 --> 00:41:38,941
