1
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,417
We are gathered here today
to immortalise in song

2
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,816
the life and untimely death
of a great legend.

3
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,170
- Rango.
- So sit back, relax,

4
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,009
and enjoy your low-calorie popcorn
and assorted confections

5
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,691
while we tell you the strange
and bewildering tale of a hero

6
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,096
who has yet to enter his own story.

7
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,814
Crunchy, creamy, cookie,
candy, cupcake.

8
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,170
Okay, everybody,
let's take it from the top.

9
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,776
The stage is set,
the night moist with apprehension.

10
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,688
Alone in her chamber, the princess
prepares to take her own life.

11
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,095
"It is far better to nourish worms
than to live without love."

12
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,051
She reaches for the poisoned chalice.

13
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,331
Meanwhile, the wicked Malvolio
plots his ascension to the throne

14
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,737
while her ageing father lies gravely ill.

15
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,296
"Yes, I am gravely ill."

16
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,496
"Hark, who goes there?"

17
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,055
'Tis I, the much-anticipated hero,

18
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,694
returning to rescue
his emotionally unstable maiden!

19
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,731
Unhand her, you jailers of virtue,

20
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,579
or taste the bitter sting
of my vengeance!

21
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,451
The sting of my...

22
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,214
Dr Marx?

23
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,854
Dr Marx,
I'm not getting anything from you.

24
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,689
People, we've talked about this.
Acting is reacting.

25
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,175
Victor, you were wooden!
There, I said it.

26
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,018
Mr Timms? You were good.

27
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,052
Perhaps a little too good.

28
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,209
What's that, Victor? My character's
undefined? That's absurd.

29
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,095
I know who I am.
I'm the guy, the protagonist, the hero.

30
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,974
Every story needs a hero.
I mean, who else is better qualified

31
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,570
to bask in the adulation
of his numerous companions?

32
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,617
<i>The stage is waiting.</i>

33
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,620
<i>The audience thirsts for adventure.</i>

34
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,339
<i>Who am I?</i>

35
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,773
<i>I could be anyone.</i>

36
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,492
I could be the sea cap'n
returning from a mighty voyage

37
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,690
to reclaim his mechanical arm!

38
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,093
Or I could be the rogue anthropologist,
battling pythons down in the Congo!

39
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,858
Down, Chongo, down!

40
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,736
And if you desire romance,

41
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,177
I will become the greatest lover
the world has ever known!

42
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,779
I couldn't help but notice you
noticing me noticing you.

43
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,449
You know, the womens find me
uncomfortably good looking.

44
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,889
But you seem remarkably at ease.

45
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,098
Stop it. No, really.

46
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,495
Well, if you must. What are you doing?

47
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,497
That tickles. Are those real?

48
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,650
That's it! Conflict.

49
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,169
Victor, you were right.
I have been undefined.

50
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,172
People, I've had an epiphany.
The hero cannot exist in a vacuum!

51
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,258
What our story needs is an ironic,
unexpected event

52
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,019
that will propel the hero into conflict!

53
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,335
Mr Timms?

54
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,577
That's right! You!

55
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,817
Don't be shy. Come on.

56
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,932
It's okay.

57
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,937
That's it, a little closer.

58
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,489
Good.

59
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,692
I won't bite you.

60
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,657
I need a little help here.

61
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,449
Are you okay?

62
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,455
I must get to the other side.

63
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,219
The other side? You mean, just now,
that was you crossing the road?

64
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,534
That's why the...

65
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,849
Why'd you do that?

66
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,938
This is my quest. He waits for me.

67
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,334
What? Who?

68
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,850
<i>The Spirit of the West,
amigo. The one.</i>

69
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:54,132
They say he rides an alabaster carriage
with golden guardians to protect him.

70
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,932
What are you talking about?

71
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,257
Enlightenment.
We are nothing without it.

72
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,817
Nothing? Your delusional quest
just ruined my life!

73
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,249
I had an incredibly complex
social network going!

74
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,099
Highly sophisticated friends!
I was very popular!

75
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,211
Friends? I don't see no friends.

76
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,569
You are a very lonely lizard.

77
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,737
Look, I need water, hydration.
My teeth are chapped.

78
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,896
I need lotion.
I'm down to one layer of skin already.

79
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,658
Pretty soon,
I'm going to start seeing my insides.

80
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,248
Not unlike what you've got going there.

81
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,092
Listen, I can't survive
in the desert, okay?

82
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,017
I... I don't belong here.

83
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,257
That may be true, but here you are.

84
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,578
Now help me up
and I will help you find what you seek.

85
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,055
- You will?
- And perhaps more.

86
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,216
Quickly. I must get back to my quest.

87
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,696
- You mean you've done this before?
- Yes. Many times.

88
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,133
Come, come. That's it, pull my finger.

89
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,137
The Spirit is waiting for me.

90
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,893
Okay, okay.

91
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,290
Okay. That's not going to work.

92
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,375
I must get to the other side.

93
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,608
Why don't you just wait
until there are no cars coming?

94
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,298
It's not so easy as it looks.

95
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,375
What?

96
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,809
Is a metaphor.

97
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,215
There's another one!

98
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,015
I knew it.

99
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,852
<i>You need a little help, amigo?</i>

100
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,858
I think the metaphor broke my spleen.

101
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,414
The path to knowledge
is fraught with consequence.

102
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,213
I'm just looking for the path to water.

103
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:08,811
If you want to find water,
you must first find Dirt.

104
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,208
Dirt.

105
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,329
Destiny, she is kind to you.

106
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,213
Tomorrow is Wednesday.
The water comes.

107
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,610
At noon, the townspeople gather
for a mysterious ritual.

108
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,375
A town? You mean, with real people
and everything? Where?

109
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,173
A day's journey. Follow your shadow.

110
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,216
You want me to just walk out
into the desert?

111
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,329
That's the way.

112
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,769
Okay. So you're saying

113
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,256
there's a town, a real town,
not a metaphor town.

114
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,779
Go on. It's okay.

115
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,375
Okay.

116
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,379
Well, then, I'm going.

117
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,699
I am leaving the road now!

118
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,093
I'm walking into the desert!

119
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,815
Alone!

120
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,374
We all have our journeys to make!

121
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,528
I will see you on the other side.

122
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,098
<i>Welcome, amigo</i>

123
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,053
<i>To the land without end</i>

124
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,219
<i>The desert and death</i>

125
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,049
<i>Are the closest of friends</i>

126
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,933
<i>We sing of his courage</i>

127
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,097
<i>In magnificent song</i>

128
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,893
<i>But pay close attention</i>

129
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,773
<i>He won't be here long</i>

130
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,932
<i>As the birds pluck his eyes
The sun bleaches his bones</i>

131
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,770
<i>See his entrails get scattered
Watch him lose his cojones</i>

132
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,330
Here in the Mojave Desert,

133
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:04,454
animals have had millions of years
to adapt to the harsh environment.

134
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,652
But the lizard? He is going to die.

135
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,253
"Four score and seven years ago,
our fathers..."

136
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,336
- Don't move.
- What?

137
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,937
- Don't move!
- Not moving.

138
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,049
Not moving.

139
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,250
Try to blend in.

140
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,859
Blend in? What do you mean?

141
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,649
Blend in.

142
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,418
What are you saying?

143
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,659
- Too late.
- No, no. It's not too late!

144
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,896
I'm blending! I'm a blender!

145
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,017
Hey, calm down! What are you doing?

146
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,288
Stop moving!

147
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,532
Try not to look conspicuous.

148
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,134
- What are you doing?
- I'm blending.

149
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,978
- Go blend somewhere else.
- Don't distract me.

150
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,818
- No room at the inn.
- It's an art, not a science.

151
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,771
- Find your own hiding place.
- No, this is good.

152
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,450
Here she comes! You better run, Mojito!

153
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,175
- What? I thought you said, "Don't move."
- That was before. Now, you run.

154
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,537
Oh, hey. Proboscis.

155
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,175
Testy.

156
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,335
Please, no, please. I have vertigo!
My glands are swelling!

157
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,889
Please, no.

158
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,370
You! I'll kill you! You stupid lizard!

159
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,297
<i>Get out of there.
I'm going to strangle your huevos!</i>

160
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,092
Big bird! Big bird!

161
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,540
No, wait! Come back! I was just kidding!

162
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,457
- Come on, we're friends, right?
- I don't know you!

163
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,252
- Lizards, frogs...
- Find your own hiding place!

164
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,938
- We're practically related!
- No room at the inn!

165
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,379
- Come on, move over!
- You're not my friend!

166
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,491
I'll let you kiss my sister!

167
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,698
You son of a...

168
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,292
<i>Where are your friends now, amigo?</i>

169
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,339
Get your slimy-webbed phalanges
off my boots!

170
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,375
Sorry.

171
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,572
I got a bead on you, stranger.
So you get up real slow

172
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,053
lessen you want to spend the better part

173
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,932
of the afternoon
putting your face back together!

174
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,620
- No, ma'am, I don't.
- Who are you?

175
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,935
- Who am I?
- I'm asking the questions here!

176
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,369
Our town is drying up.
We're in the middle of a drought.

177
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,138
Now someone's dumping water
in the desert!

178
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,251
It's a puzzle of undeterminable size
and dimension,

179
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,053
but I intend to find out
what role you playing in all this.

180
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,648
- Role?
- What are you involved in?

181
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,170
Well, I'm glad you asked.

182
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,258
I've got two one-acts, a mystery
and a musical I've been gestating.

183
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,338
I got the words, I'm just working on
the melody right now. It's like a...

184
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,609
I think it's gonna be a western.

185
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,208
<i>A monkey got a cracker
His mother was a slapper</i>

186
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,776
<i>She'll be coming 'round the mountain
in the rain</i>

187
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,773
You ain't from around here, are you?

188
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,976
I'm still working on it.

189
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,768
So, what's your name?

190
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,297
- Beans.
- That's a funny kind of name.

191
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,218
What can I say?
My daddy plumb loved baked beans.

192
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,978
Well, you're lucky
he didn't plumb love asparagus.

193
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,215
What are you saying?

194
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,296
I mean,
I enjoy a hearty puttanesca myself,

195
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,570
but I'm not sure that a child
would appreciate the moniker.

196
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,091
My daddy was a great man, even if
he did exhibit a proclivity for legumes.

197
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,609
- Spicy.
- You're eating his ashes!

198
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,049
You carry his remains?

199
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,297
No, his ashes. He loved to smoke.
They never found the body.

200
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,297
Well, I'm sure he had his reasons.

201
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,297
- What are you implying?
- Nothing.

202
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,297
My daddy was never near
that mine shaft.

203
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,899
He'd been sober for over a month!

204
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,818
And for you to insinuate that he would
abandon his parental responsibilities

205
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,694
at a delicate time in my personal
development is an affront to my sense...

206
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,534
Miss Beans?

207
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,649
Miss Beans? Hello?

208
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,569
Hello?

209
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,972
And until the people of Andromeda Five

210
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,092
return him safe and sound,
I will not sell my ranch!

211
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,655
- What... What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

212
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,532
- What am I doing?
- You're cuddling me.

213
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,979
- You were frozen.
- I was not.

214
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,897
Yes, you were. You stopped talking.

215
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,137
It's a defence mechanism.
Actually, lots of lizards have it.

216
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,375
You're making that up.

217
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,296
So, you gonna die out here,
or you want a ride into town?

218
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,174
No, no, no. Yeah. No. Yes, please.
Thank you. Sorry.

219
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,849
Today's Wednesday.
Wednesday's when we all get to it.

220
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,973
So who are you, really?

221
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,738
Well, I'm a man of many epithets.

222
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,090
There's my stage name, my pen name,
my avatar.

223
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,609
I had a pseudonym once,
but I had it legally changed.

224
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,528
And so the stranger,
seeking companionship,

225
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,778
finds the woman,
much like the sirens of ancient times

226
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,973
luring him to his certain demise.

227
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,252
...nom de plume, I have a CB handle.

228
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,972
I'm actually one of the few men
with a maiden name.

229
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,614
Whoa! Well, here we are.

230
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,775
Right.

231
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,334
Well, I sure do appreciate this,
Miss Beans,

232
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,054
- and if there's ever anything that I...
- Get on up!

233
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,099
Okay, then!

234
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,497
See you, Beans.

235
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,569
You heading out, Jim?

236
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,658
Well, we gave it our best shot.
We had to sell out.

237
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,499
Can't grow no crops without no water.

238
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,458
Bye, now!

239
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,459
What is it?

240
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,609
What was that for?

241
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,328
You're funny looking.

242
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,975
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're funny looking, too.

243
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,330
- That's a funny-looking shirt.
- That's a funny-looking dress.

244
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,735
- You got funny-looking eyes!
- You got a funny-looking face!

245
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,568
You're a stranger.
Strangers don't last long here.

246
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,971
Here's your beans, Beans.

247
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,011
I'm gonna need some more feed, too,
Willie.

248
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,974
Now, Beans, you owe me three quarts
already. I can't give you more credit.

249
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,250
But I'll have what I owe you at noon.

250
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:40,374
You don't understand. It's Mr Merrimack
down at the bank. He cut off all credit.

251
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,570
Hey, Beans! Beans!

252
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,691
You know that there fella?

253
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,253
Hey, Beans! Miss Beans!

254
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,219
Nope.

255
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,455
Hey, Beans!

256
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,655
Hey.

257
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,213
Right. Blend in. Yeah, blend in.

258
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,412
I'd like a glass of water.

259
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,935
He wants a glass of water!

260
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,652
Make it a double!

261
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,054
Give him the spittoon!

262
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,648
Cactus juice. That's what we got.

263
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,138
Hey, there, fruit cup.

264
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,094
You're a long ways from home, ain't ya?

265
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,575
Who exactly are you?

266
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,014
<i>Who am I?</i>

267
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,735
<i>I could be anyone.</i>

268
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,493
What's the matter?
You missing your mommy's mangos?

269
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,616
As a matter of fact, I am.

270
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,496
But not as much as
your daddy's cooking!

271
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,732
Exactly where did you say
you were from?

272
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,011
Me? I'm from the West.

273
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,212
Out there, beyond the horizon.
Past the sunset.

274
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,738
The Far West.

275
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,292
<i>Yeah, that's right, hombres.</i>

276
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,014
The place I come from,
we kill a man before breakfast

277
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,176
just to work up an appetite.

278
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,851
Then we salt him, and we pepper him.

279
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,939
Then we braise him in clarified butter.
And then we eat him.

280
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,971
- You eat him?
- That's what I said!

281
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,013
Hell, I seen things make a grown man
lose control of his glandular functions!

282
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,177
You spend three days in a horse
carcass, living off your own juices.

283
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,019
It'll change a man. Oh, yeah.

284
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,697
Had a few extra aces in this deck,
gents. Just the way I like it.

285
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:26,497
So, no, my hirsute little rodent friend,
I am not from around these parts.

286
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,815
You might say I'm from everywhere
there's trouble brewing

287
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,090
and hell waiting to be raised.

288
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,451
You might say
I'm what hell's already raised up.

289
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,179
Name's

290
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,453
Rango.

291
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,975
Rango.

292
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,691
Are you the fella
that killed them Jenkins brothers?

293
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,010
Killed them with one bullet.

294
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,812
Don't get no deader.

295
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,851
All seven of them?

296
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,293
That's right.

297
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,532
All seven of them.

298
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,571
Exactly how you do that, Mr Rango?

299
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,778
You know, I'm glad you asked me that.

300
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,654
And I will be happy to tell you how.
But you're all gonna have to listen up!

301
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,016
Because this is where it gets

302
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,338
complicated.

303
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,133
That'll close out your account,
Mrs Oats, two gulps and a swig.

304
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,536
Hands off, Mordecai! That's what's left
of your college education!

305
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,850
I don't rightly have
no other choice, Beans.

306
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,893
Times being so hard,
we just can't give no more credit.

307
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,100
But this here is a bank.
This is where you keep the water.

308
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:42,298
Beans, you've been like a niece to me
ever since your daddy

309
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,170
did not fall drunk down a mine shaft.

310
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,612
I've tried to protect you and others
from certain realities.

311
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,617
But that... Well...

312
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,818
- Mr Merrimack?
- Realities are bearing down.

313
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,373
Mr Merrimack!

314
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,335
Are you all right?

315
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,290
Beans, I need to show you something.

316
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,016
- That's all that's left?
- And this here is the reserve!

317
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,698
I don't know if you've noticed,

318
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,130
but folks just ain't making deposits
on a Wednesday no more!

319
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,536
Mr Merrimack, if I don't get some water,
I'm gonna lose my ranch

320
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,890
and you're telling me
that's all that's left in the whole town?

321
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,012
Now that just don't make no sense.
Now, listen.

322
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,928
Someone is dumping water
in the desert.

323
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,214
I seen it with my own eyes.

324
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,777
Water in the desert?

325
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,778
Was this during
one of your special times?

326
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,055
No.

327
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:47,059
Well, we can all dream,
but this is the reality.

328
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,616
Why do you think so many people
are selling out? They just can't make it.

329
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,049
Well, what am I supposed to do?

330
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,060
Well, I suppose
we could talk to the Mayor.

331
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,172
I hear he's been helping people out
in this time of crisis.

332
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,335
The Mayor?

333
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,020
He may be our only hope.

334
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,938
Bullet hits a shovel, ricochets back
towards number three,

335
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,334
and that's when the roof caved in,

336
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,451
igniting the thermos
of pure grain alcohol

337
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,209
instantly vapourising his bodily form,
leaving nothing but a charcoal statue

338
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,331
and a high-pitched squeal.

339
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,654
Hold on, there. That's only six.
What happened to number seven?

340
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,128
Number seven?

341
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,455
Hell, he died of infection.

342
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,531
- Seven men!
- One bullet!

343
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,537
Drinks all around!

344
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,256
Dance for me, Sod Buster!

345
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,974
- Yes, dance like a chicken!
- That's right! Dance!

346
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,456
You got corn in your ears, mate?

347
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,378
You don't pay the mortgage,
you don't own the land!

348
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,412
- That's basic real estate law, my friend.
- Quid pro quo!

349
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,452
If I see your face in this town again,

350
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,778
I'm gonna slice it off and use it
to wipe my unmentionables.

351
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,575
Mind the beak.

352
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,174
And don't come back!

353
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,534
What are you all gawping at?

354
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,336
Hey, Bad Bill,
there's something I got to tell you!

355
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,014
What is this?

356
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,974
You know who that is, Bill?
That there's Rango!

357
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,729
Yeah, he ain't afraid of you!
He ain't afraid of none of you.

358
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,213
Killed them Jenkins brothers.

359
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,093
- Done it with one bullet, Bill.
- All seven of them!

360
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,577
Is that right?

361
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,896
Let me get that before you...

362
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,858
No. Oh, I know. Here.

363
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,969
Just take care of that for you.

364
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,850
There. All better.

365
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,734
T.O. T.O. Just a second.

366
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,299
All right, now listen!

367
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,492
I'm going to give you fellas
one last chance to reconsider!

368
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,932
And if you don't want to reconsider

369
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,972
I might consider reconsidering myself.

370
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,131
Now that's what I'm talking about. Yeah.

371
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,773
All right, now listen up!

372
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,778
Things are going to be different
around here now that Rango's in town.

373
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,812
Got some new rules!
I want my shoes shined every morning,

374
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,737
my coffee hot, Danish on the side.

375
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,976
Whatever you do,
don't look me in the eye.

376
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,409
Stay out of my peripheral vision!

377
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,412
- It's Rango.
- What's he up to?

378
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,532
He ain't afraid of nobody.
He's telling that bird what's for!

379
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,332
And when you see me coming,
stand aside.

380
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,299
I take large steps and I don't want
none of you hayseeds

381
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,980
getting your bodily fluids on my boots!

382
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,452
Of course, there is no need for violence,

383
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,378
as long as we stick together,
work as a team.

384
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,731
So I want you all to come outside now
and line up single file

385
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,213
while I take a brief intermission!

386
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,738
What's he doing now?

387
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,339
I think it's a number two.

388
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,891
Never mind.

389
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,612
Take a look-see over here!

390
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,889
Well, look at him now!

391
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,772
He's chasing after that hawk!

392
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,299
Give him hell, Rango!

393
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,253
- Did you see that?
- He killed that thing!

394
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,893
What do you think, Doc?

395
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:59,220
This hawk is dead!

396
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,169
Shoot, I say we cook that right up.

397
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,892
He did it with one bullet!

398
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,453
Just like he said!

399
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,218
It's about time
we had a hero around here.

400
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,456
One who ain't in a pine box.

401
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,859
I think it's time he met the Mayor.

402
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,778
You hear that, Rango?
You're going to meet the Mayor!

403
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,095
Let's hear it for Rango!

404
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,649
And so the stranger basks

405
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,977
in the adulation of his new friends,

406
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:32,049
sinking deeper into the guacamole
of his own deception.

407
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,738
When is he going to die?

408
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,169
<i>Soon, compadre. Soon.</i>

409
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,977
My land is not for sale!

410
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,529
I came here to save my land, not sell it!

411
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,130
I'm sure there's something reasonable
we can work out if you just talk to him!

412
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,172
Beans! Where are you going? Beans?

413
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,458
The Mayor will see you now.

414
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:14,857
Water, Mr Rango, water.

415
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,491
Without it,
there's nothing but dust and decay.

416
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:22,898
But with water there's life.

417
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,611
Look at them, so desperate to live,
they'll follow it anywhere.

418
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,296
That's the immutable law of the desert.

419
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:38,133
Control the water
and you control everything.

420
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,498
But I don't have to tell you that being
a true man of the West, as you are.

421
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,813
Oh, yeah. The West is the best.

422
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,090
This is from my private stock.

423
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,178
Vintage rainwater
from the Great Deluge.

424
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,615
Not Noah's deluge.
Good heavens, I'm not that old.

425
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,415
I guess power has its privileges.

426
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,379
You make a good point, son.

427
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,338
But with privilege comes responsibility.

428
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,738
Hell, I was mayor here
before there was a Dirt!

429
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,011
And I may be
just a sentimental old turtle

430
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:19,895
but I think there's a future for this town.
And I hope you'll be part of it.

431
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,335
- To Dirt!
- To Dirt.

432
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,616
You see them, Mr Rango?
All my friends and neighbours?

433
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,771
It's a hard life here. Very hard.

434
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:39,130
Do you know how they make it through
each and every day?

435
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,215
They believe.

436
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,613
They believe it's going to be better.

437
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,937
They believe that the water will come.

438
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,415
They believe against all odds
and all evidence

439
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,610
that tomorrow will be better than today.

440
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,213
People have to believe in something.

441
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,892
Right now, they believe in you.

442
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:06,099
Pick it up, Mr Rango.
Your destiny awaits.

443
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,736
People have to believe in something.

444
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,050
It's almost noon. Is everything ready?

445
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,819
Yeah. But he might be a problem.

446
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,171
He's not a problem, William.
He's a solution.

447
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,653
It just don't make no sense.

448
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,171
This whole town is drying up,

449
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,768
and the Mayor is the only one
who don't seem to be affected.

450
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,777
Doesn't that make you
just a wee bit suspicious?

451
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,932
And what about that water
I saw out in the desert?

452
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:45,212
All right! No need to incite anxiety.
I'll inquire about the Mayor.

453
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,855
But if you really feel
there's some conspiracy occurring,

454
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,858
I suggest you take it up
with the new sheriff.

455
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,058
This is going to be good. Hey!
Watch that needle there.

456
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,533
Not too tight.
I want to leave room for some pucker!

457
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,615
That's good.

458
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,695
Oh, easy there, tiger.

459
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,449
- A little up and back?
- I don't think so.

460
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,649
Have you got French cuffs with that?

461
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,008
Excuse me, Sheriff Rango.
I want to talk to you.

462
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,539
Hey, Beans,
what do you think of the new duds?

463
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,537
I got a 10-gallon hat
marked down from 15.

464
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,139
- That's nice.
- Have you met Angelique?

465
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,978
- Hello, Beans.
- Hello, Angelique.

466
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,055
- Tart.
- Floozy.

467
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,250
- Trollop.
- Excuse me, Mr Rango.

468
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,893
I will blow that ugly right off your face!

469
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,097
I was just thinking that...

470
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,452
You want the old John Hancock,
do you?

471
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,571
- Well, here. Hold this.
- Sheriff Rango, this isn't a social call.

472
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,292
There's a bullet in there.

473
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,853
I know about the shindig this afternoon.

474
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,335
- I ordered myself some right fancy duds.
- Sheriff, I'd like to file a...

475
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,098
- Mr Rango!
- Oh, you, too? No problem.

476
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,733
- Here, let me just...
- I need you to investigate...

477
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,579
You know, Beans, I bet you clean up
real nice, you put a little effort into it.

478
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,815
- What?
- Now, remember, son,

479
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,329
stay in school, eat your veggies,
burn everything but Shakespeare.

480
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,973
- Who's Shakespeare?
- Sheriff Rango,

481
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,098
if that is your real name.

482
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,290
I am trying to save my daddy's ranch,

483
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,376
which is on the verge
of an agricultural meltdown

484
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,253
while you're playing patty-cake
with this here trollop!

485
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,571
Sad, really. Such a drab little thing.

486
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,329
Why does she do that?

487
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,532
- It's a survival reflex.
- Her switch is just broken.

488
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,013
Well, that's an inconvenience.

489
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,608
It is not a rash! It is a birthmark!

490
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,454
I did it again, didn't I?

491
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,729
Did what?

492
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,619
Let me ask you something.

493
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,619
Did anybody here mention
what happened to our last sheriff?

494
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,532
Pardon, but may I ask you...
Excuse me, may I ask you...

495
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:00,289
The last sheriff... Pardon me.
Where is everybody going?

496
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,658
What exactly happened to the...

497
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,339
<i>All day</i>

498
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,248
<i>I've faced the barren waste</i>

499
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,455
<i>Without the taste of water</i>

500
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,530
<i>Cool water</i>

501
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,612
<i>Old Dan and I</i>

502
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,617
<i>With throats burned dry</i>

503
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:37,173
<i>And souls that cry</i>

504
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,734
<i>For water</i>

505
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,934
<i>Cool</i>

506
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,173
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

507
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,609
<i>Clear water</i>

508
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,978
This is a heck of a hoedown
you got going.

509
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,772
Still working out those steps.

510
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,575
So, is this considered
normal civic behaviour?

511
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,055
Every Wednesday, just like clockwork.

512
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,818
You kill bird.

513
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,659
Yeah. Matter of fact, I did.

514
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,213
Bird dead. Snake come.

515
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,095
Snake?

516
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,175
He means Rattlesnake Jake, Mr Rango.

517
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,336
He never comes to town 'cause
he's scared of that hawk.

518
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,654
But he might come now.

519
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,259
Can I have your boots
when you're dead?

520
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,369
No!

521
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,730
And I ain't got no problem
with this Rattlesnake Jake.

522
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,418
That's just what Amos said.

523
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,531
Amos?

524
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,975
You got any gold fillings?

525
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,974
<i>My fellow Dirtonians.</i>

526
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:59,855
<i>I welcome you to our great day
of deliverance. Hallelujah.</i>

527
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,459
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

528
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,936
<i>Acolytes, prepare the holy spigot!</i>

529
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,291
<i>We have a newcomer
amongst us today, my friends.</i>

530
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,014
<i>A man I think needs
little introduction to you</i>

531
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:25,099
<i>so bold has been his entry
into our fair society.</i>

532
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:28,292
<i>Mr Rango, would you step forward?</i>

533
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:38,058
<i>The time has come, my friends.
The time that was foretold!</i>

534
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,738
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

535
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,179
<i>The sacred time!</i>

536
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,972
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

537
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,330
<i>The time of destiny!</i>

538
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,939
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

539
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,415
<i>The time of deliverance!</i>

540
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,495
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

541
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:54,533
<i>It is the time of hydration!</i>

542
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,735
- It's his fault!
- It's the newcomer!

543
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,452
- Burn him!
- He's a witch!

544
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,615
I get his boots!

545
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,779
<i>My friends, my friends!
Temper your frustrations.</i>

546
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:23,735
<i>Times will be tough from now on.
Sacrifices will have to be made.</i>

547
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,330
<i>But if I can help in any way,
please know that my door is always...</i>

548
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,973
Hold it, hold it!

549
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,739
Now, this whole thing
stinks three ways to Sunday.

550
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,215
First the bank's run dry
and now this here spigot?

551
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,295
The bank's run dry?

552
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,980
- What's she talking about?
- She said there's no water in the bank!

553
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,052
This is all we have!
We can't give it all out!

554
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,250
That was my rehydration account!

555
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,448
None of that civil disobedience
in my town, thank you very much.

556
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,097
Thank goodness you're here, Sheriff.
Things were getting out of hand.

557
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,972
Come right in.

558
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,934
Let me have a gander at the source
of the societal discontentment here.

559
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,979
Mercy.

560
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,660
All right, listen up! I've been thinking

561
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,419
and I believe I've figured something out.

562
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,849
You folks have a water problem!

563
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,288
Now just pay attention, everybody.
I'm trying to make a point here.

564
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:24,059
Let's say this fella here
were to take a drink of water.

565
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,819
Just one little drink.
No harm, no foul, right?

566
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,969
And you!

567
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,934
You're just as dried up and parched
as a jackrabbit in July.

568
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,972
So you belly on up
and take you a double shot!

569
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,932
Stay with me.

570
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:44,495
What do you think happens then?
Why we'd all be drinking!

571
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,973
And before you know it,
there wouldn't be any more water.

572
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,977
And then where would we be?

573
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,938
We'd be thirsty.

574
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,092
Real thirsty.

575
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,895
We'd turn on each other
like a bunch of animals!

576
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:05,090
Now look here.
We have got six days of water.

577
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,500
We have got five days...

578
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,409
As long as we've got water,
we've got ourselves a town.

579
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,417
Sheriff Rango is right.

580
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:23,976
As long as we have this water,
we have some hope.

581
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,772
And you can all take it from me.

582
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,176
My 100% full-time employment
from this moment on

583
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:33,054
will be to protect
our precious natural resource.

584
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,809
Ain't no one gonna tango
with the Rango.

585
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,369
Evening, ladies.

586
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,172
Evening, Sheriff.

587
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,291
And don't you come back!

588
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,810
Hold on there, Gordy. You get back
in there and you assert yourself,

589
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:01,012
and I think you'll find the people of this
here town to be surprisingly hospitable.

590
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,334
Thank you, Sheriff.

591
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,212
What? Not you again!

592
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,332
I stand corrected.

593
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,609
- This ain't the bank.
- I told you, Jedidiah!

594
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:16,934
Hold it right there!

595
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,254
- Who's that?
- It's the Sheriff!

596
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,938
Get them hands up
where I can see them!

597
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,616
Just as I suspected.

598
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,334
Prospecting without the authorised
equipment. Don't move a muscle.

599
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,539
Prospecting?

600
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,094
Now, you got your shovel,
pickaxe, Benadryl, loofah,

601
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:37,292
assorted snacks, some puzzle books
and you're gonna need a permit.

602
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,012
- Loofah.
- Ezekiel, Jedidiah!

603
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,256
What the Sam Hill's going on up there?

604
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:44,770
I've had polyps removed
smarter than the two of you!

605
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,330
Hell's fire, this ain't the bank!

606
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,890
Pappy, the Sheriff is standing right here,
helping us out.

607
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,614
Gonna give us a permit for prospecting.

608
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,174
That's right, sir. Just doing my duty.

609
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,896
The lonely constable on his rounds,

610
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:01,215
keeping an eagle eye out
for mayhem and malfeasance.

611
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,657
Does he look like he sounds?

612
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,695
Well, Sheriff,
if we was to hit the mother lode,

613
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,811
being prospectors and such,

614
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,932
where would we deposit said annuity?

615
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,891
Here in the town of Dirt,
we happen to have

616
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,693
the finest financial institution
this side of the Missouri.

617
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,854
Protected morning, noon and night
by yours truly.

618
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,457
Much obliged.

619
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,419
The bank's been robbed!
The bank's been robbed!

620
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,849
Good Lord, the bank's been robbed!

621
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,299
What's going on?

622
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,490
- It's gone! The water's all gone!
- What'd he say?

623
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,814
He said the bank's been robbed!

624
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:40,413
Dr Marx! I'm on fire! Embrace me!

625
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:45,451
<i>The bank's been robbed, the town is dry
"We'll die of thirst," the people cry</i>

626
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:49,892
<i>He promised to protect the vault
The water's gone, it's all his fault</i>

627
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,411
All right, folks, stand back,
clear the area.

628
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,768
This is a crime scene now.

629
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,858
Secure the perimeter, dust for prints,
check for fibres, scan for DNA.

630
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,540
I want a urine sample from everyone.
And get me a latte.

631
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,895
And don't mix up the two.

632
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,089
What's this?

633
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,778
"Prospecting Permit."

634
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,572
I'll take that. Material evidence.

635
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,133
What are we gonna do now, Sheriff?

636
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,820
- We need that water.
- We're all going to die!

637
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:13,376
My friends, we all know
what we have to do now.

638
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,095
That's right.
We all know what we have to do now.

639
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,131
- And that would be?
- Form a posse.

640
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,012
Form a possum!

641
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,778
A posse.

642
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,932
Now, we're gonna be doing this
in an orderly fashion.

643
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:34,216
First off, does anybody here know
how to use a firearm of any kind?

644
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,133
All right, then.

645
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,693
What do we do now, Sheriff?

646
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,380
Now we ride!

647
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:57,135
Where are we going?

648
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,409
What?

649
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,258
Where are we going?

650
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,973
Now, as my deputy, you'll be in charge
of all tracking and finding of villains,

651
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,773
utilising your well-developed
Injun-uity, no offence taken.

652
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,049
So which way do you think they went?

653
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,614
You want to sniff the air or commune
with a buffalo or something?

654
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,972
Oh, you're good.

655
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,092
I'm depending on you, Spoons.

656
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,734
You got a little tobaccy
in the beard there.

657
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,658
Always good to have a medical man
along, Doc.

658
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,374
Reptiles got to stick together, right,
my brother?

659
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,694
I'm an amphibian.

660
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,253
Ain't no shame in that.

661
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,775
You sure you're
fit for duty there, soldier?

662
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,338
Well, you got a little something
in your eye there.

663
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:51,695
Oh, that? That there's conjunctivitis, sir.
It's hereditary.

664
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:55,453
Well, I'm glad to hear
it's not contagious.

665
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:59,610
Now, just wait a cotton-picking minute!
A posse ain't no place for a...

666
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,608
Never mind.

667
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,571
Hold on there, little sister.

668
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,260
Someone's gonna have
to look after the town while I'm gone.

669
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,379
Can I gut-shoot someone?

670
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,611
Let's put a pin in that.

671
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,938
Sheriff, you're going to bring
that water back, aren't you?

672
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,219
Count on it, little sister.

673
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,337
- Which way do we go, Sheriff?
- There's tunnels everywhere.

674
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:25,939
Whole town's perforated with them.

675
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:29,416
He got more holes in him
than even a painted lady on a porcupine.

676
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,333
Hey, my daddy took me to her place.

677
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,612
Not what I expected.

678
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,213
How'd them fellers
find the bank, anyway?

679
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,331
Gentlemen, if we can just
stay on task here.

680
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:42,849
Sheriff! Over here!

681
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,336
- Would you look at that?
- Like seeing the face of God.

682
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,609
Amen, brother.

683
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:53,174
I remember when it used to flow
every Wednesday.

684
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,177
Those were the halcyon days.

685
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,449
Must be a reason she quit on us.

686
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,660
Whatever the reason,
something is controlling this here water.

687
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,769
What do you say, Sheriff?

688
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:06,813
Clearly, the robbers came
from this direction.

689
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,215
I say we track this pipe
back to its hydraulic origin

690
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,695
and apprehend the culprits
behind this aquatic conundrum.

691
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:14,015
- What'd he say?
- I think he said follow the pipe.

692
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:16,415
- He said follow the pipe.
- He said follow the pipe.

693
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,617
Sure is humid down here.

694
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:25,618
Yeah. It's like the big mud piles.

695
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,378
I had a goitre removed once.

696
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,458
Looked like Tony Bennett
stepping out of the shower.

697
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,298
I put that on a tortilla.

698
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:48,138
Whatever you do, do not look down.

699
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,538
- What is this place?
- It's an aquifer.

700
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,779
What's an aquifer?

701
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,777
Well, it's for aqua.

702
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:01,532
Well, it's empty now.

703
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,455
That's a big one.

704
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,648
- It's the end of the line.
- Don't go no further.

705
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:30,375
Now that there is a path.
It's got to be connected to something.

706
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,968
You talk too much.
Why don't you put a cork in it?

707
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,330
Why don't you put a cork...
Tell you where the sun don't shine.

708
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,859
Your mama did.
I'll cook her right up.

709
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,413
You two just don't get it, do you?

710
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:42,010
Someone or something
is messing with our hydration

711
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,971
and that pipe
has got something to do with it.

712
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,818
I thought
we was following bank robbers!

713
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,090
We're experiencing a paradigm shift.

714
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:50,176
I'm gonna shift the features on your face
if you don't shut up!

715
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,289
Go ahead and try!

716
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,419
Quiet, you savages! Stop your rattling.
You're affecting my cogitation.

717
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,573
Whoa! I got it. Snuff out them torches.

718
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,095
Sure enough.

719
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,338
Smart thinking there, feller.

720
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,020
- Start climbing.
- Get your foot out of my face!

721
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:14,573
Not bad, huh, Beans?

722
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,975
You keep thinking like that,
your hat's gonna catch on fire.

723
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,409
Well, you know, you get on a roll,
you just...

724
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,488
Hot, hot! Burn.

725
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,657
Poor things.
All they wanted was a little water.

726
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:39,056
Cactus dying of thirst. It don't bode well.

727
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,772
- Hey, look what I found!
- What you got there?

728
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,653
- I saw that first!
- Hey, that's mine!

729
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,259
Give me that!

730
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,257
It's empty anyway.

731
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:48,733
I knew that.

732
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,054
Where'd you find that?

733
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,853
Sheriff! You're going to want to see this!

734
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,012
It's Mr Merrimack from the bank.

735
00:52:58,140 --> 00:52:59,459
What's he doing here?

736
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,013
- Everybody stand back.
- All right, let me see.

737
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,495
Looks like them varmints shot him
in the back.

738
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:07,579
No, this man wasn't shot.
He was drowned!

739
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,214
- Drowned?
- In the middle of the desert?

740
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,978
What a way to go.

741
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:17,169
Well, now, whose boot prints are those?

742
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,175
That's interesting.
The ground's still wet.

743
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,253
I suppose we should bury him.

744
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:27,574
I don't know. Birds got to eat, too.

745
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:28,934
Circle of life!

746
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:31,849
Sherriff.

747
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,413
Will you say a few words?

748
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,937
Yeah. Yeah.

749
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,534
Dearly beloved.

750
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:44,176
We are gathered here today
to honour this man.

751
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:45,935
Mr Merrimack,

752
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:47,859
you have the right to remain silent.

753
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,170
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

754
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,255
Amen.

755
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,535
- Amen.
- Amen.

756
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:55,453
Hey! What's that dad-gum Indian doing?

757
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:01,820
I see you're consulting with the spirits.

758
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:04,135
No, I'm moulting.
Means I'm ready to mate.

759
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,933
I'll keep that in mind.

760
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,655
Cactus fruit.

761
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,419
Ah, yes. The ancient cactus fruit.

762
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,212
I believe your people use it
as seasoning

763
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,693
when preparing your native dishes.

764
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,538
Also natural laxative.

765
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,169
Pick up trail.

766
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:23,576
Three men heading west.
One blind, one with

767
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,455
enlarged prostate, riding sidesaddle.

768
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:30,697
- What did he say?
- They're riding sidesaddle.

769
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,139
- We're whispering.
- What'd he say?

770
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:33,295
Someone's got a bad valve.

771
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,218
All right, which one of you fellers
needs a check-up?

772
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,215
Awkward.

773
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:42,657
What exactly are we going to do now?

774
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,530
Now we ride!

775
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,735
That means we're riding now!
This moment.

776
00:55:35,175 --> 00:55:37,450
Marshmallows remind me
of going camping with my daddy.

777
00:55:37,575 --> 00:55:39,611
I could eat them all night long.

778
00:55:41,375 --> 00:55:44,412
Of course he did make me cough them
back up again for breakfast.

779
00:55:46,055 --> 00:55:49,047
This one time,
I coughed up an entire Dalmatian.

780
00:55:49,175 --> 00:55:52,804
That ain't nothing.
I coughed up a whole tribe of pygmies.

781
00:55:53,815 --> 00:55:55,646
They started looking at me weird.

782
00:55:55,775 --> 00:55:58,892
I remember them.
They was quite friendly.

783
00:55:59,015 --> 00:56:02,371
I found a human spinal column
in my fecal matter once.

784
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:07,809
You might want to get that looked at.

785
00:56:09,135 --> 00:56:10,932
Pass the beans, Beans.

786
00:56:11,055 --> 00:56:12,647
- Sheriff?
- No, thanks.

787
00:56:12,775 --> 00:56:16,973
Mr Rango? Can you tell us
about the Spirit of the West?

788
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:20,733
- Yeah, tell us about that.
- Is it true what they say?

789
00:56:20,855 --> 00:56:24,325
Yes, the Spirit of the West!

790
00:56:24,455 --> 00:56:26,730
The eternally unattainable ideal.

791
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,643
They say he rides in
an alabaster carriage

792
00:56:29,775 --> 00:56:31,254
with golden guardians to protect him.

793
00:56:32,375 --> 00:56:35,128
But he only appears to those
who have undertaken an epic quest!

794
00:56:35,895 --> 00:56:37,214
And have made it

795
00:56:37,575 --> 00:56:39,452
to the other side.

796
00:56:43,615 --> 00:56:44,764
The other side of what?

797
00:56:45,255 --> 00:56:46,734
It's a metaphor.

798
00:56:46,855 --> 00:56:47,810
My eye!

799
00:56:47,935 --> 00:56:49,368
That's gonna heal right up.

800
00:56:49,495 --> 00:56:53,283
Sheriff? What are you going to do
about Rattlesnake Jake?

801
00:56:53,855 --> 00:56:54,810
What? Where?

802
00:56:56,535 --> 00:57:00,289
Sorry about that. Word is
you come against him once or twice.

803
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:02,563
Yeah.

804
00:57:02,695 --> 00:57:04,572
Jake. You mean my brother.

805
00:57:04,695 --> 00:57:06,447
- Your brother?
- That's what I said!

806
00:57:07,255 --> 00:57:09,689
But he's a snake and you're a lizard.

807
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,444
Well, Momma had an active social life.

808
00:57:13,855 --> 00:57:14,890
Did he ever bite you?

809
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:18,246
Sure enough did. Look at that baby.
Go ahead, you can touch it.

810
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:22,084
That's interesting.
That there's a belly button.

811
00:57:22,255 --> 00:57:23,688
Luckily, I'm immune to his venom.

812
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,612
Put some in my coffee
just to give it a little tang.

813
00:57:25,735 --> 00:57:27,566
Is it true he's only scared
of them hawks?

814
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:31,131
Them's what we call
his natural predator.

815
00:57:32,855 --> 00:57:35,847
All this talk of that serpentine devil
is putting my quills on edge!

816
00:57:35,975 --> 00:57:37,852
I ain't sleeping tonight. No, sir.

817
00:57:37,975 --> 00:57:40,967
Don't you all worry about a thing.
Come tomorrow, we'll locate that water

818
00:57:41,095 --> 00:57:42,972
and return to a hero's welcome.

819
00:57:44,095 --> 00:57:46,484
Friends, before we bunk down

820
00:57:46,615 --> 00:57:48,924
I'd like us all to join hands
for a moment,

821
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:51,649
say a few words
to the Spirit of the West.

822
00:57:51,775 --> 00:57:53,288
That's a good idea.

823
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:58,208
Ain't always spoken rightly to you,
Spirit of the West.

824
00:57:58,615 --> 00:58:03,973
But tonight I want to thank you for
bringing Sheriff Rango into our lives.

825
00:58:04,895 --> 00:58:06,533
It's a hard life we got.

826
00:58:06,655 --> 00:58:09,408
Sometimes I don't know how
we're gonna make it.

827
00:58:09,895 --> 00:58:13,171
But somehow, Sheriff Rango
makes me think we will.

828
00:58:14,175 --> 00:58:16,894
We needed a brave man
and you sent us one.

829
00:58:18,015 --> 00:58:20,893
Nice to have someone
to believe in again.

830
00:58:21,015 --> 00:58:24,451
Thank you, Spirit of the West. Amen.

831
00:58:25,415 --> 00:58:27,167
- Amen.
- Amen.

832
00:58:57,735 --> 00:58:59,453
Just checking.

833
00:59:01,935 --> 00:59:04,529
- It's a little cold tonight.
- Thank you.

834
00:59:07,015 --> 00:59:09,688
You ever feel like those things
are looking at you?

835
00:59:09,855 --> 00:59:11,447
That's a Spanish dagger.

836
00:59:11,575 --> 00:59:14,248
But around here,
we just call them the Walking Cactus.

837
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:15,364
Walking?

838
00:59:15,495 --> 00:59:19,170
There's an old legend they actually
walk across the desert to find water.

839
00:59:19,295 --> 00:59:22,890
When I was a little girl, I'd stay up late
watching them, to see if they'd move.

840
00:59:23,015 --> 00:59:26,894
I thought if I could follow them,
they'd lead me to someplace wonderful.

841
00:59:27,015 --> 00:59:30,485
Someplace with enough water
for everyone.

842
00:59:31,375 --> 00:59:35,687
Night after night, I watched them.
I never saw them move.

843
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,610
But you're still watching.

844
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:40,609
Who doesn't want to find
someplace wonderful?

845
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:44,208
We'll find the water, Beans.
I promise you.

846
00:59:47,535 --> 00:59:49,765
That's such a lonely sound.

847
00:59:50,615 --> 00:59:52,492
You ever get lonely?

848
00:59:52,615 --> 00:59:53,889
Sometimes.

849
00:59:54,015 --> 00:59:58,327
I can't imagine it. You're such a charmer
and everyone likes you so much.

850
00:59:58,855 --> 01:00:01,688
- I never made friends easy like that.
- No?

851
01:00:02,455 --> 01:00:04,810
No, we're pretty isolated
out there on the ranch,

852
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:07,495
sort of like being sealed up
in a little box.

853
01:00:07,615 --> 01:00:10,846
Don't really see a lot of folks.

854
01:00:10,975 --> 01:00:13,091
I wouldn't know what that's like.

855
01:00:13,895 --> 01:00:16,329
There someone special
in your life, Rango?

856
01:00:16,895 --> 01:00:19,648
There used to be.
But she couldn't keep her head.

857
01:00:19,775 --> 01:00:21,686
Besides, my life's too dangerous
for that kind of thing.

858
01:00:21,815 --> 01:00:24,727
You know, it's an awful solitary
existence out there on the prairie.

859
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:26,971
Riding the ranges and the suchlike.

860
01:00:28,655 --> 01:00:29,804
Beans?

861
01:00:31,415 --> 01:00:32,609
Beans?

862
01:00:49,455 --> 01:00:52,970
I'm gonna skin you alive, boy! I'm gonna
whup you like a red-headed stepchild!

863
01:00:53,095 --> 01:00:54,323
Choleric varmints, ain't they?

864
01:00:54,455 --> 01:00:57,253
Dysfunctional family. Need intervention.

865
01:00:58,375 --> 01:00:59,694
What's that coming?

866
01:01:01,695 --> 01:01:03,048
It's the water.

867
01:01:05,055 --> 01:01:08,730
I have a plan, and each and every one
of you has a part to play.

868
01:01:08,855 --> 01:01:10,004
What do I do?

869
01:01:10,135 --> 01:01:11,807
Spoons, you got
the most important job of all.

870
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:14,046
You stay up here on the ridge,
and if anything goes wrong,

871
01:01:14,215 --> 01:01:16,888
you give the signal.

872
01:01:27,495 --> 01:01:30,646
Hey, Beans.
What size dress you wearing?

873
01:01:30,775 --> 01:01:33,289
- He got it!
- Hallelujah!

874
01:01:33,415 --> 01:01:34,973
- He found the water!
- You did it, son.

875
01:01:35,095 --> 01:01:36,050
Well, actually...

876
01:01:36,175 --> 01:01:38,894
Why can't you be all brainy
like your brother?

877
01:01:39,015 --> 01:01:41,290
Pappy, about that water.
There's something I gots to tell you.

878
01:01:41,415 --> 01:01:43,133
Hush up, now. Somebody's coming.

879
01:01:45,495 --> 01:01:48,726
Good sirs, gracious good afternoon
to thee and thee and thee.

880
01:01:48,855 --> 01:01:50,925
May I present Madame Lupone's

881
01:01:51,055 --> 01:01:53,364
Terpsichorean Troupe
of Travelling Thespians!

882
01:01:55,135 --> 01:01:57,171
- What is that?
- I think they's thespians.

883
01:01:57,295 --> 01:02:00,253
Thespians?
That's illegal in seven states!

884
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:04,004
The stage is set. The princess
prepares to take her own life.

885
01:02:04,135 --> 01:02:05,329
I yearn for love.

886
01:02:06,975 --> 01:02:08,567
Meanwhile, the lone sentry
stands watch at the castle gate.

887
01:02:10,615 --> 01:02:12,492
Stands watch at the castle gate...

888
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:15,286
Hark! Who goes there?

889
01:02:15,415 --> 01:02:17,087
This plot is highly predictable.

890
01:02:17,215 --> 01:02:18,489
Quiet! This is my favourite part.

891
01:02:18,615 --> 01:02:20,094
Arriving to great fanfare
'twas her aged father,

892
01:02:24,495 --> 01:02:26,247
strucketh by Cupid.

893
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:30,493
Prithee, unhand my fair daughter

894
01:02:30,615 --> 01:02:32,173
and reach for the...

895
01:02:33,655 --> 01:02:36,169
- Line?
- "Reach for the sky!"

896
01:02:38,695 --> 01:02:40,174
What was that?

897
01:02:40,295 --> 01:02:42,172
Must be that immersive theatre.

898
01:02:42,295 --> 01:02:43,444
We got you surrounded!

899
01:02:43,575 --> 01:02:47,250
You and your entire family get
your hands up where I can see them.

900
01:02:47,375 --> 01:02:49,684
My entire family?

901
01:02:54,175 --> 01:02:58,214
<i>Grits and spit and collard greens</i>

902
01:02:58,335 --> 01:03:02,567
<i>Waffle chitlins, monkey brains</i>

903
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:06,290
<i>Refried bones and booger blood</i>

904
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:09,612
<i>Pickled eggs and flaps of mud</i>

905
01:03:12,935 --> 01:03:14,926
It's a full house.

906
01:03:15,055 --> 01:03:18,172
Looks like we're gonna have ourselves
a good old-fashioned standoff.

907
01:03:19,055 --> 01:03:22,843
I'll have you know, you're not looking
at our entire contingent.

908
01:03:29,215 --> 01:03:31,524
What's that supposed to be?

909
01:03:31,655 --> 01:03:32,974
That's the signal.

910
01:03:33,095 --> 01:03:36,531
That's the signal!
Something must have gone wrong!

911
01:03:40,215 --> 01:03:44,003
So something's supposed to happen?

912
01:03:44,135 --> 01:03:47,411
I am open to suggestions.

913
01:03:55,015 --> 01:03:56,494
Run!

914
01:04:02,455 --> 01:04:03,570
Get on the wagon!

915
01:04:09,415 --> 01:04:12,009
Should we have ourselves
some sport, chill'ens?

916
01:04:12,935 --> 01:04:14,812
I likes it when they run.

917
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:17,768
Maybelle, give the holler!

918
01:04:24,135 --> 01:04:25,363
Looks like we made it!

919
01:04:25,495 --> 01:04:26,894
That audience was quite responsive.

920
01:04:27,015 --> 01:04:29,688
Yeah, well, I think that
chromosome pool is about dried up.

921
01:04:55,855 --> 01:04:57,174
We got bats!

922
01:04:58,095 --> 01:04:59,767
Here! You drive.

923
01:05:07,495 --> 01:05:09,770
Looks like there's gonna be
soup tonight!

924
01:05:10,215 --> 01:05:12,206
Come on, let's get some!

925
01:05:21,215 --> 01:05:24,287
What in tarnation?
Don't shoot the water!

926
01:05:24,455 --> 01:05:27,731
Jedidiah! It's time for
the Alabama squeeze box!

927
01:05:27,855 --> 01:05:29,208
Okay, Pa!

928
01:05:35,935 --> 01:05:37,732
I am sensing hostility.

929
01:05:37,855 --> 01:05:38,970
Incoming!

930
01:05:44,575 --> 01:05:45,724
Hello!

931
01:05:45,855 --> 01:05:46,970
Goodbye!

932
01:05:56,415 --> 01:05:58,645
Lasso that swine!

933
01:06:18,215 --> 01:06:19,967
I suggest we take evasive action!

934
01:06:20,095 --> 01:06:21,926
I suggest you shut up and shoot!

935
01:06:22,055 --> 01:06:24,489
- What happened to the Sheriff?
- He had a previous engagement!

936
01:06:24,615 --> 01:06:27,129
Boseefus, give them some gumbo now!

937
01:06:33,575 --> 01:06:36,089
What was that? Go check it out!

938
01:06:37,375 --> 01:06:38,967
What is it? Is there a problem?

939
01:06:41,335 --> 01:06:42,654
You could call it that.

940
01:07:29,175 --> 01:07:30,164
Headache.

941
01:07:32,775 --> 01:07:34,766
Is that all you got?

942
01:07:51,975 --> 01:07:54,091
That wasn't altogether unpleasant!

943
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:56,610
Eat lead!

944
01:08:06,935 --> 01:08:08,368
Here, hold these.

945
01:08:18,775 --> 01:08:20,413
Get your hands off me!

946
01:08:25,295 --> 01:08:26,648
Oh, I'm sorry.

947
01:08:35,135 --> 01:08:36,170
Jump!

948
01:08:58,175 --> 01:08:59,608
It's impossible.

949
01:09:00,095 --> 01:09:02,848
It can't be. It's empty.

950
01:09:02,975 --> 01:09:04,567
There's no water!

951
01:09:04,695 --> 01:09:07,971
No water?
Then what the hell we been fighting for?

952
01:09:08,095 --> 01:09:12,134
Sir, you have defiled and desecrated
the very sustenance of our livelihood!

953
01:09:12,255 --> 01:09:14,723
I think that there fella in the purty dress
is the Sheriff.

954
01:09:14,855 --> 01:09:17,289
That's the same fellow what give us
a prospecting permit?

955
01:09:17,415 --> 01:09:20,134
- A what?
- Irrelevant! Obfuscation.

956
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:22,132
You and your kin are under arrest
for bank robbery

957
01:09:22,255 --> 01:09:24,166
and the murder
of our beloved financial advisor

958
01:09:24,295 --> 01:09:27,605
Johannes Merrimack the Third,
AKA, Fluffy Joe.

959
01:09:27,735 --> 01:09:29,214
Sheriff, we didn't kill nobody.

960
01:09:29,335 --> 01:09:31,565
We done tunnelled into that vault,
but there weren't nothing in it.

961
01:09:31,695 --> 01:09:33,526
Somebody done robbed that bank
before we robbed it.

962
01:09:33,655 --> 01:09:35,293
Then where'd you get this here jug?

963
01:09:35,415 --> 01:09:37,292
That's what I been trying
to tell you, Pappy.

964
01:09:37,415 --> 01:09:38,530
I found it in the desert.

965
01:09:38,655 --> 01:09:41,727
Then why in tarnation
did you bring it here?

966
01:09:41,855 --> 01:09:45,609
Hold on! You're saying this here jug
was empty when you found it?

967
01:09:45,735 --> 01:09:46,884
That's right.

968
01:09:47,015 --> 01:09:48,243
I don't believe a word of it.

969
01:09:48,375 --> 01:09:49,808
- Let's hang them, Sheriff!
- String them up!

970
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:51,288
Who'd dump water in the desert?

971
01:09:51,895 --> 01:09:53,374
Wouldn't be the first time.

972
01:09:53,895 --> 01:09:56,534
It's a puzzle!
It's like a big old mammogram!

973
01:09:56,655 --> 01:09:58,407
What's going on, Sheriff?

974
01:09:58,535 --> 01:09:59,809
I don't know.

975
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:03,769
But I'm going to strip away this mystery
and expose its private parts.

976
01:10:03,895 --> 01:10:06,011
You and your kin are coming with me.

977
01:10:10,375 --> 01:10:11,524
They're coming!

978
01:10:11,655 --> 01:10:13,247
Here they come!

979
01:10:14,495 --> 01:10:16,804
Looks like they got them robbers.

980
01:10:38,455 --> 01:10:39,774
Where's the water?

981
01:10:42,735 --> 01:10:44,566
There weren't no water.

982
01:10:58,175 --> 01:10:59,767
Where is he going?

983
01:11:00,855 --> 01:11:03,164
He's going to see the Mayor.

984
01:11:05,255 --> 01:11:07,132
He's got to be pleased with that.

985
01:11:07,255 --> 01:11:08,927
That's a good one, boss!

986
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:19,410
That's interesting.

987
01:11:19,535 --> 01:11:22,254
I do apologise for the shoes, Mr Rango,

988
01:11:22,375 --> 01:11:25,526
but there's a certain protocol
to this game, you understand.

989
01:11:25,655 --> 01:11:27,850
I'm a bit of a stickler for protocol.

990
01:11:27,975 --> 01:11:30,773
Well, that's good, 'cause you got
a few questions to answer

991
01:11:30,895 --> 01:11:33,045
and I've got my own protocol.

992
01:11:36,935 --> 01:11:39,688
But why would anyone dump water
in the blooming desert?

993
01:11:39,815 --> 01:11:43,649
It does seem a bit nave, taking the word
of admitted bank robbers.

994
01:11:43,775 --> 01:11:47,211
Besides, once they hang,
your job is done.

995
01:11:47,335 --> 01:11:48,734
- Bravo!
- Job well done.

996
01:11:48,855 --> 01:11:51,653
But what if somebody did rob the bank
before they got there?

997
01:11:51,775 --> 01:11:53,811
And who would do that, Mr Rango?

998
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:56,051
I was hoping you could tell me.

999
01:11:56,175 --> 01:11:59,008
That sounds marginally
near to an accusation.

1000
01:11:59,135 --> 01:12:01,012
Take it any way you like.

1001
01:12:06,175 --> 01:12:09,611
Something you said keeps rattling
around in my frontal lobe.

1002
01:12:09,735 --> 01:12:10,804
What's that?

1003
01:12:11,495 --> 01:12:15,010
"Control the water
and you control everything."

1004
01:12:15,655 --> 01:12:17,611
Come now, Mr Rango.

1005
01:12:17,735 --> 01:12:20,488
You attribute divine power to me.

1006
01:12:20,615 --> 01:12:23,607
How on earth
could I possibly control the water?

1007
01:12:26,055 --> 01:12:29,013
You've obviously mastered this game.

1008
01:12:29,135 --> 01:12:32,411
Well, I've been playing it
for many years, sir.

1009
01:12:32,535 --> 01:12:35,527
I was here before the highway split
this great valley.

1010
01:12:35,655 --> 01:12:38,169
I watched the march of progress,

1011
01:12:38,295 --> 01:12:40,650
and I learned a thing or two.

1012
01:12:41,175 --> 01:12:44,167
Perhaps it's time you started
to take the long view,

1013
01:12:44,295 --> 01:12:47,924
begin to appreciate
the broad sweep of history.

1014
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:50,014
Look out there, son.

1015
01:12:50,975 --> 01:12:53,205
You can almost see time passing.

1016
01:12:56,415 --> 01:12:58,326
What are you building out here?

1017
01:12:58,455 --> 01:13:01,606
The future, Mr Rango, the future.

1018
01:13:01,735 --> 01:13:05,250
One day soon,
all this is going to fade into myth,

1019
01:13:05,375 --> 01:13:08,048
the frontier town, the lawman,
the gunslinger.

1020
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:10,450
There's just no place
for them any more.

1021
01:13:10,575 --> 01:13:13,692
- We're civilised now.
- That's right, civilised.

1022
01:13:14,535 --> 01:13:16,048
That's what the future holds.

1023
01:13:16,175 --> 01:13:19,372
You can either be part of it,
or you can be left behind.

1024
01:13:19,775 --> 01:13:23,450
Is that what happened to
Mr Merrimack? Did he get left behind?

1025
01:13:23,575 --> 01:13:28,012
Careful, Mr Rango. You seem to forget
you're just one little lizard.

1026
01:13:28,335 --> 01:13:32,010
You seem to forget
I'm the law around these parts.

1027
01:13:34,615 --> 01:13:37,527
Our new sheriff has been
playing the hero for so long,

1028
01:13:37,655 --> 01:13:39,930
he's actually starting to believe it.

1029
01:13:40,055 --> 01:13:42,364
Call in Rattlesnake Jake.

1030
01:13:42,495 --> 01:13:45,009
But Jake's the Grim Reaper.

1031
01:13:45,135 --> 01:13:47,365
He never leaves
without taking a blooming soul.

1032
01:13:47,495 --> 01:13:48,644
Do it!

1033
01:14:02,575 --> 01:14:06,614
Now be still. You gotta look
presentable to meet your maker.

1034
01:14:12,175 --> 01:14:15,406
<i>Death has arrived</i>

1035
01:14:19,735 --> 01:14:23,887
<i>How will the hero survive?</i>

1036
01:14:27,535 --> 01:14:30,527
The Mayor has bought up
all the land in the valley,

1037
01:14:30,655 --> 01:14:32,407
except for your ranch, Miss Beans.

1038
01:14:32,535 --> 01:14:36,164
That just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.

1039
01:14:36,295 --> 01:14:38,968
Unless he controls the water.

1040
01:14:39,095 --> 01:14:40,847
Like a monkey's bladder!

1041
01:14:40,975 --> 01:14:43,125
Then he could bring it back
once he's bought up all the land.

1042
01:14:43,255 --> 01:14:44,290
But how does he control the water?

1043
01:14:46,535 --> 01:14:49,527
Well, you gotta spend some time
and train them.

1044
01:14:49,655 --> 01:14:52,567
'Cause you know monkeys, when
they do go, you rub their nose in it.

1045
01:14:52,815 --> 01:14:54,692
Sheriff, we got a problem.

1046
01:15:01,135 --> 01:15:04,332
Hold on, Beans.
That won't be necessary.

1047
01:15:07,655 --> 01:15:10,852
- Hang him till his head turns blue!
- Give us them robbers!

1048
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:13,284
Hold on! Calm down, everyone!
Let me talk!

1049
01:15:13,415 --> 01:15:15,565
- Nail them to the courthouse!
- Now, calm down, everybody.

1050
01:15:15,695 --> 01:15:18,209
Get them out here
so we can cut off their giblets!

1051
01:15:18,815 --> 01:15:20,328
You, too, Spoons?

1052
01:15:20,455 --> 01:15:23,652
They done taken that water.
They taken everything we got!

1053
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:26,608
No one's stringing anyone up.
Not while I'm sheriff.

1054
01:15:26,735 --> 01:15:27,884
But this is all his fault!

1055
01:15:28,015 --> 01:15:30,245
You said you's gonna
bring the water back.

1056
01:15:30,375 --> 01:15:32,764
It's just, we got no hope
without that water.

1057
01:15:32,895 --> 01:15:34,692
We got nothing left to believe in.

1058
01:15:35,375 --> 01:15:36,808
You see that sign up there?

1059
01:15:37,575 --> 01:15:39,645
As long as that sign says "Sheriff,"

1060
01:15:39,775 --> 01:15:42,005
you can believe that there's
law and order in this town.

1061
01:15:42,135 --> 01:15:46,014
But without law and order,
ruminate on that. Oh, yeah.

1062
01:15:46,135 --> 01:15:49,172
Starts out slow, like a fungus.

1063
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:51,809
Somebody says a cross word.
Accusations start flying.

1064
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:54,608
Neighbour turns on neighbour.
Pretty soon, we're eating our children!

1065
01:15:54,735 --> 01:15:56,054
And then dogs and cats
are getting together

1066
01:15:56,175 --> 01:15:58,689
to create all sorts of unnatural
mutant aberrations!

1067
01:15:59,695 --> 01:16:03,085
So, you want something
to believe in, Spoons?

1068
01:16:03,535 --> 01:16:04,684
Believe in me.

1069
01:16:06,255 --> 01:16:08,132
Believe in that there sign.

1070
01:16:09,055 --> 01:16:12,411
For as long as it hangs there,
we got hope.

1071
01:16:36,815 --> 01:16:39,124
Hello, brother.

1072
01:16:39,415 --> 01:16:41,167
Thirsty?

1073
01:16:51,535 --> 01:16:55,813
Long time, brother.
How you been keeping?

1074
01:16:56,335 --> 01:16:57,893
Well, you know...

1075
01:17:00,295 --> 01:17:04,368
I hear you been telling about how
you killed all them Jenkins brothers.

1076
01:17:04,495 --> 01:17:07,009
With one bullet, wasn't it?

1077
01:17:07,135 --> 01:17:08,932
Isn't that right?

1078
01:17:09,055 --> 01:17:13,094
All these good folks here
believe your little stories, don't they?

1079
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:16,844
Why, they believe you're just
a stone killer, don't they?

1080
01:17:16,975 --> 01:17:20,012
Seems these folks trust you.

1081
01:17:20,175 --> 01:17:23,087
They think you're gonna save
their little town.

1082
01:17:23,215 --> 01:17:26,525
They think you're gonna save
their little souls!

1083
01:17:30,415 --> 01:17:33,771
But we know better, don't we?

1084
01:17:39,135 --> 01:17:42,605
So why don't you show your friends here
what you're made of?

1085
01:17:42,735 --> 01:17:45,408
Show them who you really are.

1086
01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:48,413
Why don't you just pull your gun
and shoot me?

1087
01:17:48,535 --> 01:17:51,288
But, of course, you won't need all these.

1088
01:17:51,415 --> 01:17:53,246
Just one, right?

1089
01:17:55,455 --> 01:17:58,731
Go ahead, hero. Pull the trigger.

1090
01:18:01,735 --> 01:18:03,965
You got killer in your eyes, son?

1091
01:18:06,215 --> 01:18:07,284
I don't see it.

1092
01:18:10,415 --> 01:18:13,532
You didn't do any of them things
you said, did you?

1093
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:17,489
You didn't kill them Jenkins brothers.
You ain't even from the West!

1094
01:18:17,615 --> 01:18:18,684
Are you?

1095
01:18:19,455 --> 01:18:21,969
- Say it!
- No.

1096
01:18:22,095 --> 01:18:26,008
Speak up.
I don't think your friends here heard you.

1097
01:18:27,575 --> 01:18:28,564
No.

1098
01:18:28,695 --> 01:18:31,084
All you've done is lie
to these good people.

1099
01:18:31,215 --> 01:18:35,208
You ain't nothing but a fake
and a coward. Isn't that right?

1100
01:18:35,535 --> 01:18:36,604
Yes.

1101
01:18:36,775 --> 01:18:38,367
- Louder!
- Yes.

1102
01:18:42,695 --> 01:18:45,687
Listen close, you pathetic fraud.

1103
01:18:45,815 --> 01:18:48,693
This is my town now.

1104
01:18:48,815 --> 01:18:53,013
If I ever see you again, I will take
your soul straight down to hell!

1105
01:19:09,295 --> 01:19:10,808
Who are you?

1106
01:21:02,735 --> 01:21:04,088
<i>Who am I?</i>

1107
01:21:06,175 --> 01:21:07,813
<i>I'm nobody.</i>

1108
01:22:57,415 --> 01:22:59,212
Golden guardians.

1109
01:23:01,135 --> 01:23:02,648
The alabaster carriage.

1110
01:23:07,495 --> 01:23:09,804
The Spirit of the West.

1111
01:23:14,135 --> 01:23:17,810
Excuse me? Mister Spirit, sir?

1112
01:23:20,295 --> 01:23:25,050
There's a beaut. Sometimes you got to
dig deep to find what you're looking for.

1113
01:23:26,655 --> 01:23:27,974
So you made it.

1114
01:23:28,935 --> 01:23:30,084
Is this heaven?

1115
01:23:30,215 --> 01:23:33,810
If it were, we'd be eating Pop-Tarts
with Kim Novak.

1116
01:23:34,095 --> 01:23:35,210
Yeah.

1117
01:23:35,415 --> 01:23:38,407
No kidding.
What are you doing out here?

1118
01:23:38,855 --> 01:23:40,732
Searching, same as you.

1119
01:23:41,655 --> 01:23:44,806
I don't even know
what I'm looking for any more.

1120
01:23:44,935 --> 01:23:46,732
I don't even know who I am.

1121
01:23:47,295 --> 01:23:49,684
They used to call you
the Man with No Name.

1122
01:23:51,015 --> 01:23:54,724
These days they got a name
for just about everything.

1123
01:23:54,855 --> 01:23:58,928
Doesn't matter what they call you.
It's the deeds make the man.

1124
01:23:59,055 --> 01:24:02,650
Yeah, but my deeds just made things
worse. I'm a fraud. I'm a phoney!

1125
01:24:02,775 --> 01:24:06,484
My friends believed in me,
but they need some kind of hero.

1126
01:24:06,615 --> 01:24:08,207
Then be a hero.

1127
01:24:08,335 --> 01:24:12,044
No. No, no, you don't understand.
I'm not even supposed to be here.

1128
01:24:12,175 --> 01:24:16,168
That's right. You came a long way
to find something that isn't out here.

1129
01:24:17,255 --> 01:24:19,815
Don't you see? It's not about you.

1130
01:24:20,815 --> 01:24:22,248
It's about them.

1131
01:24:25,135 --> 01:24:26,454
But I can't go back.

1132
01:24:26,575 --> 01:24:28,805
Don't know that you got a choice, son.

1133
01:24:32,535 --> 01:24:35,174
No man can walk out on his own story.

1134
01:24:47,135 --> 01:24:48,773
So you made it.

1135
01:24:50,135 --> 01:24:53,810
<i>That's right, amigo.
The other side of the road.</i>

1136
01:24:56,215 --> 01:24:58,365
Did you just see that?

1137
01:24:58,775 --> 01:25:01,494
We each see what we need to see.

1138
01:25:02,495 --> 01:25:04,372
Beautiful, isn't it?

1139
01:25:15,935 --> 01:25:16,970
Yeah.

1140
01:25:18,095 --> 01:25:19,369
It is.

1141
01:25:19,975 --> 01:25:23,570
Come, my friend.
I want to show you something.

1142
01:25:26,495 --> 01:25:31,569
<i>Many years ago, this entire
valley was covered in agua.</i>

1143
01:25:31,695 --> 01:25:35,449
Now only one question remains.

1144
01:25:36,655 --> 01:25:38,088
Where did it go?

1145
01:26:11,695 --> 01:26:13,651
They follow the water.

1146
01:26:13,775 --> 01:26:16,733
They follow the water! Come on!

1147
01:26:50,215 --> 01:26:54,572
<i>That just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.</i>

1148
01:26:55,335 --> 01:26:57,166
What are you building out here?

1149
01:26:57,295 --> 01:26:59,092
The future, Mr Rango.

1150
01:26:59,215 --> 01:27:03,527
<i>You can either be part of it,
or you can be left behind.</i>

1151
01:27:05,895 --> 01:27:08,614
<i>I was here before the highway split
this great valley.</i>

1152
01:27:11,575 --> 01:27:14,043
<i>I watched the march of progress</i>

1153
01:27:14,175 --> 01:27:16,325
<i>and I learned a thing or two.</i>

1154
01:27:21,455 --> 01:27:23,491
Control the water

1155
01:27:23,615 --> 01:27:25,890
and you control everything.

1156
01:27:32,495 --> 01:27:34,611
<i>Come now, Mr Rango.</i>

1157
01:27:34,735 --> 01:27:36,453
<i>You attribute divine power to me.</i>

1158
01:27:36,575 --> 01:27:39,009
<i>How on earth
could I possibly control the water?</i>

1159
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:16,332
<i>What now, amigo?</i>

1160
01:28:23,695 --> 01:28:26,573
No man can walk out on his own story.

1161
01:28:28,095 --> 01:28:29,448
I'm going back.

1162
01:28:30,895 --> 01:28:32,169
But why?

1163
01:28:33,295 --> 01:28:35,172
Because that's who I am.

1164
01:28:46,855 --> 01:28:51,292
You got a lot of nerve showing up here,
lawman. What is it you want?

1165
01:28:52,335 --> 01:28:55,805
Your pappy and them boys are about
to hang for something they didn't do.

1166
01:28:57,215 --> 01:28:58,773
But I've got a plan.

1167
01:29:25,775 --> 01:29:28,448
I appreciate how difficult
this is for you, Beans.

1168
01:29:28,615 --> 01:29:31,413
But you're making a practical decision.

1169
01:29:31,535 --> 01:29:34,129
Decisions, decisions.

1170
01:29:34,255 --> 01:29:37,247
There's no need for any more suffering.

1171
01:29:43,535 --> 01:29:46,845
Your family's ranch is nothing
but a wasteland now.

1172
01:29:47,415 --> 01:29:51,931
Sign the deed and relieve yourself
of your father's burden.

1173
01:29:53,935 --> 01:29:56,608
My daddy was not a burden!

1174
01:29:56,735 --> 01:29:59,010
Keep your blood money
and I'll keep my land!

1175
01:30:04,935 --> 01:30:07,927
Do what he says or,
by all the fires of the black pit,

1176
01:30:08,055 --> 01:30:11,286
I'll squeeze them pretty brown eyes
out of your skull!

1177
01:30:12,055 --> 01:30:14,125
Now, hold on, Jake.
There's no need to...

1178
01:30:14,255 --> 01:30:16,450
Let me do my job! You brought me in.

1179
01:30:16,575 --> 01:30:19,009
Now we're gonna play this thing
out to the end!

1180
01:30:19,815 --> 01:30:22,124
Sign the damn paper, woman!

1181
01:30:22,415 --> 01:30:24,053
Go to hell!

1182
01:30:24,295 --> 01:30:26,490
Where do you think I come from?

1183
01:30:27,095 --> 01:30:29,290
Look into my eyes.

1184
01:30:29,415 --> 01:30:31,645
I want to see you die.

1185
01:30:36,575 --> 01:30:37,724
Jake!

1186
01:30:40,975 --> 01:30:42,852
I'm calling you out!

1187
01:30:45,055 --> 01:30:46,454
Jake!

1188
01:30:46,815 --> 01:30:51,013
This day
just got a little more interesting.

1189
01:31:17,175 --> 01:31:18,290
Put her down.

1190
01:31:18,415 --> 01:31:21,851
Or what, little man?
You going to kill me?

1191
01:31:21,975 --> 01:31:23,727
That's just about the size of it.

1192
01:31:26,375 --> 01:31:28,843
- Get your filthy paws off me!
- Shut your gob!

1193
01:31:28,975 --> 01:31:31,967
All right, Sheriff, make your move.

1194
01:33:00,495 --> 01:33:01,894
<i>Now, amigos!</i>

1195
01:33:06,295 --> 01:33:08,809
- Heave! Heave!
- Heave! Heave!

1196
01:33:26,135 --> 01:33:27,329
That was a bad idea.

1197
01:33:32,535 --> 01:33:33,490
Thirsty, brother?

1198
01:33:37,015 --> 01:33:39,006
Here it comes!

1199
01:33:40,775 --> 01:33:41,730
No. No!

1200
01:33:45,975 --> 01:33:47,124
It's a miracle!

1201
01:33:47,295 --> 01:33:48,614
Look out!

1202
01:33:55,455 --> 01:33:57,047
- Lookee there!
- What is that?

1203
01:33:58,935 --> 01:34:00,254
It's our salvation, Pa!

1204
01:34:00,375 --> 01:34:03,333
It's a jailbreak, boys! We're busting out!

1205
01:34:13,175 --> 01:34:17,054
I'm gonna blow so many holes in you,
your guts'll be leaking lead!

1206
01:34:17,175 --> 01:34:19,769
Well, then
it's a good thing I brought some backup.

1207
01:34:30,615 --> 01:34:31,604
What?

1208
01:34:35,255 --> 01:34:37,007
Ain't no hawk.

1209
01:34:37,135 --> 01:34:39,444
Ain't nothing but bats!

1210
01:34:41,575 --> 01:34:45,614
Stick to the plan, boys!
Let's bleed that devil dry!

1211
01:34:56,615 --> 01:34:58,606
It only takes one bullet.

1212
01:34:58,775 --> 01:35:00,766
You ain't got the nerve.

1213
01:35:01,935 --> 01:35:03,288
Try me.

1214
01:35:07,495 --> 01:35:09,008
Oh, Mr Rango.

1215
01:35:09,695 --> 01:35:11,287
Aren't you forgetting something?

1216
01:35:16,375 --> 01:35:18,206
Hand me your gun, Sheriff.

1217
01:35:21,015 --> 01:35:22,687
Now, Mr Rango.

1218
01:35:34,375 --> 01:35:36,525
Beans! Hold on.
Don't worry, I got a plan.

1219
01:35:37,495 --> 01:35:39,486
Help!

1220
01:35:39,615 --> 01:35:41,810
Open the door!

1221
01:35:42,455 --> 01:35:43,854
Okay, plan B.

1222
01:35:45,015 --> 01:35:46,050
Beans, you're mumbling.

1223
01:35:46,615 --> 01:35:50,574
All my problems taken care of
except for one.

1224
01:35:51,255 --> 01:35:52,290
It's a new West, Jake.

1225
01:35:52,415 --> 01:35:56,567
There's no room for gunslingers
any more. We're businessmen now.

1226
01:35:56,695 --> 01:35:58,333
Yeah, we got new hats.

1227
01:35:58,455 --> 01:36:01,891
Where I come from,
we call this improvisation.

1228
01:36:03,255 --> 01:36:04,893
You came back.

1229
01:36:12,815 --> 01:36:13,930
What was that?

1230
01:36:14,055 --> 01:36:16,489
No need to panic,
but I think you just swallowed plan B.

1231
01:36:16,655 --> 01:36:17,690
What?

1232
01:36:19,255 --> 01:36:20,688
Okay, panic time.

1233
01:36:20,815 --> 01:36:23,568
You and the Sheriff are more alike
than you think.

1234
01:36:23,735 --> 01:36:25,453
You're nothing but legends.

1235
01:36:25,575 --> 01:36:29,124
Pretty soon,
no one will believe you even existed.

1236
01:36:32,255 --> 01:36:34,723
One last bullet to kill one last outlaw.

1237
01:36:37,015 --> 01:36:38,607
How fitting.

1238
01:37:11,535 --> 01:37:13,571
Sheriff, I'm sure if we work together,

1239
01:37:13,695 --> 01:37:17,654
we can reach a mutually beneficial
solution to our current situation.

1240
01:37:17,775 --> 01:37:19,891
You better take it up with him.

1241
01:37:30,735 --> 01:37:32,373
One bullet.

1242
01:37:33,775 --> 01:37:35,970
I tip my hat to you,

1243
01:37:36,135 --> 01:37:38,854
one legend to another.

1244
01:37:40,655 --> 01:37:42,725
What was that you said?

1245
01:37:42,855 --> 01:37:47,326
"Pretty soon,
no one will believe you even existed."

1246
01:37:47,535 --> 01:37:49,526
No, Jake! No!

1247
01:38:01,415 --> 01:38:02,689
Rango!

1248
01:38:04,095 --> 01:38:07,724
You brought the water back,
just like you promised.

1249
01:38:07,855 --> 01:38:09,413
You really are a hero.

1250
01:38:10,695 --> 01:38:13,687
Well, the thing about heroes is,
whenever you...

1251
01:38:13,815 --> 01:38:15,487
Don't spoil it.

1252
01:38:15,615 --> 01:38:16,764
Right.

1253
01:38:17,295 --> 01:38:19,684
Well, I don't know about you all,
but I could sure go for a dip.

1254
01:38:23,895 --> 01:38:26,648
And so the lizard completes his journey

1255
01:38:26,775 --> 01:38:30,609
from humble beginnings
to the legend we sing of today.

1256
01:38:30,735 --> 01:38:35,206
And although he is certain to die,
perhaps from a household accident,

1257
01:38:35,335 --> 01:38:38,213
which account
for 65% of all unnatural deaths,

1258
01:38:38,335 --> 01:38:41,611
the people of the village
will honour his memory

1259
01:38:41,775 --> 01:38:44,767
even as they abandon their dignity.

1260
01:38:52,095 --> 01:38:54,325
- I'm going in.
- How about a cold one, there?

1261
01:38:54,455 --> 01:38:56,366
Water ain't money. Money is money.

1262
01:38:56,495 --> 01:38:58,451
Well, I ain't got no...

1263
01:38:59,615 --> 01:39:00,764
We have a problem.

1264
01:39:00,895 --> 01:39:03,409
Who let Snuggles in the pool again?

1265
01:39:03,535 --> 01:39:05,844
I really think you complete me.

1266
01:39:05,975 --> 01:39:08,045
Prithee, unhand my fair maiden.

1267
01:39:08,175 --> 01:39:11,133
- Cut. Cut. Everybody, take five.
- How can they take this any more?

1268
01:39:14,015 --> 01:39:15,414
Oh, you kids.

1269
01:39:15,535 --> 01:39:17,287
What did you do that for?

1270
01:39:17,415 --> 01:39:19,724
I was just checking.
I hope you don't get too sunburned.

1271
01:39:19,855 --> 01:39:21,971
You can peel a man's face right off.

1272
01:39:22,095 --> 01:39:23,448
- What is it?
- That there's some human spleen.

1273
01:39:23,575 --> 01:39:24,530
Don't touch it.

1274
01:39:24,655 --> 01:39:25,849
That's the second time
that's happened to me.

1275
01:39:25,975 --> 01:39:27,454
This water thing's great.

1276
01:39:27,575 --> 01:39:28,974
I'm urinating right now.

1277
01:39:29,095 --> 01:39:32,053
<i>Adult swim, next five minutes.</i>

1278
01:39:32,175 --> 01:39:34,405
<i>Stay between the buoys.</i>

1279
01:39:34,535 --> 01:39:35,763
I packed your lunch. Danish is in there

1280
01:39:35,895 --> 01:39:37,487
and I picked the raisins out
just the way you like it.

1281
01:39:37,615 --> 01:39:39,526
Don't forget, your nasal spray is
in your saddle-bag...

1282
01:39:39,655 --> 01:39:41,168
- Beans!
...and your moisturising lotion...

1283
01:39:41,295 --> 01:39:43,411
- Now, Beans! We've talked about this.
- Lotion?

1284
01:39:43,535 --> 01:39:46,129
That's for my gun. That's gun lotion.

1285
01:39:46,335 --> 01:39:47,768
Sherriff, where are you headed?

1286
01:39:47,895 --> 01:39:50,648
There's trouble down a dry creek.
Bad Bill's been acting up again.

1287
01:39:50,775 --> 01:39:52,527
Now, honey, you come back
with all your digits.

1288
01:39:52,655 --> 01:39:53,929
And don't go trying to be a hero.

1289
01:39:54,055 --> 01:39:55,408
Beans, you are missing the point.

1290
01:39:55,535 --> 01:39:57,730
I got an image to protect now.

1291
01:39:58,815 --> 01:40:00,248
Where's my Tic Tacs?

1292
01:40:01,495 --> 01:40:03,372
- I found them.
- What's going on?

1293
01:40:03,575 --> 01:40:06,169
You know, in order to satisfy the needs
of the collective,

1294
01:40:06,295 --> 01:40:07,967
the hero must abandon the self

1295
01:40:08,135 --> 01:40:11,889
and solidify his image as an icon
that will forever be remembered.

1296
01:40:12,775 --> 01:40:15,084
So, this is the sunset shot.

1297
01:40:23,135 --> 01:40:25,524
<i>Give them a good one, amigo.</i>

1298
01:40:34,255 --> 01:40:35,813
Ready, Excelsior?

1299
01:40:35,975 --> 01:40:37,852
My fellow comrades.

1300
01:40:37,975 --> 01:40:40,443
There will be times
when you doubt yourself.

1301
01:40:40,575 --> 01:40:43,772
When you feel pummelled
by the cataclysms of life,

1302
01:40:43,895 --> 01:40:47,683
remember this moment.
Remember me.

1303
01:40:47,975 --> 01:40:50,728
Know that I will be there watching you,

1304
01:40:50,895 --> 01:40:53,693
sometimes at inappropriate moments.

1305
01:40:54,015 --> 01:40:56,165
That's part of the deal.

1306
01:40:56,295 --> 01:40:59,765
And remember, within all of us resides

1307
01:40:59,895 --> 01:41:02,329
the true Spirit of the...

1308
01:41:04,135 --> 01:41:05,170
Let's take it from the top.
