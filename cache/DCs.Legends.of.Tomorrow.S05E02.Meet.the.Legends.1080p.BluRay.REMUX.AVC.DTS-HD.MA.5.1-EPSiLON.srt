1
00:00:01,712 --> 00:00:04,506
<i>The Legends of Tomorrow
are everywhere.</i>

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,759
<i>Since they defeated a demon with
the help of a dragon on national TV,</i>

3
00:00:07,843 --> 00:00:10,512
<i>they've become a worldwide obsession.</i>

4
00:00:10,596 --> 00:00:13,891
<i>Sure, we've all been mesmerized
by the global phenomenon</i>

5
00:00:13,974 --> 00:00:15,392
<i>known as "Legends Mania."</i>

6
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:16,476
Yum.

7
00:00:17,144 --> 00:00:20,772
And the Oscar for Best Picture
goes to...

8
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:25,152
<i>But who are the people beneath
those supersized public personas?</i>

9
00:00:26,028 --> 00:00:28,447
<i>What are they like
when the spotlight is off?</i>

10
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:30,240
I'm Kevin Harris,

11
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:32,659
and my documentary film crew
is the first ever

12
00:00:32,743 --> 00:00:34,953
to be granted unfettered access
to their lives

13
00:00:35,037 --> 00:00:37,080
and their ship, the <i>Waverider.</i>

14
00:00:37,164 --> 00:00:41,793
So, strap in, because today,
we meet the Legends.

15
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:49,527
So, why don't we start
with just a brief introduction?

16
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:51,762
And let us know what we're doing today
on the <i>Waverider.</i>

17
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:52,845
Uh, yeah.

18
00:00:53,138 --> 00:00:56,266
Hi, I'm... I'm Ava Sharpe.

19
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,560
After Congress shut down
the Time Bureau,

20
00:00:58,644 --> 00:01:00,187
Sara went off to help Oliver Queen...

21
00:01:00,312 --> 00:01:03,440
...and, uh, I had to fight to keep
the <i>Waverider</i> from being impounded.

22
00:01:03,523 --> 00:01:05,984
<i>Bad luck that the senator
chairing the committee was</i>

23
00:01:06,068 --> 00:01:08,153
<i>the same person
we almost killed last year.</i>

24
00:01:08,237 --> 00:01:11,406
Senator Wellington, I know the Time
Bureau may have been compromised...

25
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:14,576
...but you must allow the <i>Waverider</i>
to continue patrolling the timeline.

26
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:17,704
Ms. Sharpe, how do we know
these so-called "Legends"

27
00:01:17,788 --> 00:01:19,623
can be trusted with time travel?

28
00:01:19,915 --> 00:01:22,251
Oh, there's simply no transparency.

29
00:01:22,334 --> 00:01:26,588
Which is why you all are here.
Right? To show everyone what we do.

30
00:01:27,547 --> 00:01:28,966
What could go wrong?

31
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:31,260
<i>The</i> Waverider
<i>was surprisingly quiet</i>

32
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:33,428
<i>because half the team
was away on a mission.</i>

33
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:37,307
Oh, the crossover.
Yeah, had to take a rain check.

34
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:41,728
See, when you are a superhero/
amusement park impresario...

35
00:01:41,937 --> 00:01:44,356
.../historian that rises from the dead,

36
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,984
your dance card tends
to get pretty full.

37
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:51,196
<i>For two full minutes, I was not alive.</i>

38
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:53,699
<i>That changes you, man.</i>

39
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,034
<i>Don't get me wrong, I love fame.</i>

40
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,662
<i>No one says no to you about anything.</i>

41
00:01:58,912 --> 00:02:01,373
Hey, man, that's a cool hat.
Can I have it?

42
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:05,544
But still, something doesn't feel right.

43
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:12,551
Oh, sorry.

44
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:13,760
Hang on.

45
00:02:16,388 --> 00:02:17,514
There we go.

46
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:19,766
<i>Hi, I'm Behrad Tarazi.</i>

47
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,244
I guess you probably think I'm some kind

48
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:24,062
of awesome future man
since I'm from 2044.

49
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:29,151
<i>My literal birthday was yesterday,
which is pretty wild, man.</i>

50
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:33,739
That's me. Hey, baby Behrad.

51
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:36,575
Be easy and go with the flow.

52
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:39,536
Like Wu-Tang Clan and Bruce Lee.

53
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:41,955
I mean, now, that we're no longer
D-list superheroes,

54
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,874
we can just go where we want.

55
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:45,042
Do as we please.

56
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:46,710
Why have I stuck around?

57
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,713
Tell you the truth,
I have no bloody clue.

58
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:52,132
I am bored as a post, ain't I?

59
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:54,968
Gids, I'm nicking the Jumpship,
all right?

60
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:56,386
I'll see you when I see you.

61
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,430
The Jumpship is fully totemed.

62
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:01,350
She's a mad old bat,
that one.

63
00:03:03,894 --> 00:03:06,980
Hi, I'm Mona Wu. I'm a Kaupe.

64
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:11,735
That's basically like a werewolf,
but Hawaiian.

65
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:16,365
I'm also a literary agent for...

66
00:03:16,573 --> 00:03:18,533
<i>...romance novelist Rebecca Silver,</i>

67
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:20,577
who is secretly Mick Rory.

68
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,706
Jeez, Peter, take me out on a date first
before you try to... You know.

69
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,709
<i>Basically, what I do is,
I sell movie rights,</i>

70
00:03:27,793 --> 00:03:30,003
<i>get book advances,
that kind of stuff.</i>

71
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:33,048
You're telling me that
you don't have a single dollar

72
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:35,217
for a Rebecca Silver book advance?

73
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,344
Okay, now you're not
just disrespecting me,

74
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:39,429
you're disrespecting my client!

75
00:03:41,807 --> 00:03:43,642
Not now!

76
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:46,019
Pay up, or I will thrash you!

77
00:03:48,397 --> 00:03:51,274
Hi, I'm, uh, Gary Green.

78
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:56,571
Um, if I had to sum myself up
in two words, they would be, uh...

79
00:03:56,655 --> 00:03:57,906
fully forgiven.

80
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:01,493
A lot of things happened last year
that you could misconstrue

81
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:03,286
as potentially maybe being my fault.

82
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:07,541
<i>But thankfully, everyone agrees that
at worst, I was just a hapless rube</i>

83
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:11,378
<i>who got manipulated by
the forces of hell to betray humanity.</i>

84
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:14,714
<i>Uh, I had a Fairy Godmother named Nora,
but we separated amicably</i>

85
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:16,967
after she granted me
my heart's deepest wish.

86
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,470
Gary, what the hell are you doing?
Come on. We got bigger fish to fry.

87
00:04:20,554 --> 00:04:22,848
Nora made me Constantine's apprentice.

88
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:24,182
Gary!

89
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:25,267
Call me!

90
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:31,833
So, uh, how does your girlfriend
feel about the documentary being made?

91
00:04:31,857 --> 00:04:36,236
Actually I haven't told Sara
about the documentary yet.

92
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:38,714
I just think it was a little awkward
over the phone.

93
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:41,950
<i>It's... it's better to spring it on her
when she gets back from the big mission.</i>

94
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:44,828
Okay, big smiles, everyone.

95
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:47,330
And nobody mention Oliver Queen.

96
00:04:47,414 --> 00:04:48,582
Why?

97
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,667
Because he died.

98
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,294
Shouldn't have done the crossover.

99
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:58,758
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

100
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:00,886
- Yay, team!
- Yeah.

101
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:03,680
Bros!

102
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:05,474
Orange drink or limeade?

103
00:05:05,557 --> 00:05:06,808
Alcohol.

104
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:08,977
Hey, love. Welcome back, baby.

105
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,060
Mmm.

106
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:12,762
- What is going on?
- Before you object, let me explain.

107
00:05:13,148 --> 00:05:16,252
The only way that I could stop Senator
Wellington from cutting off our funding,

108
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:19,571
was to be clear and transparent
about our process.

109
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:20,822
Get it?

110
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:23,825
So, you're shooting a documentary
about the Legends?

111
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:25,869
Not me per se...

112
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:27,746
Hi, Captain Lance. Huge fan.

113
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:30,749
Uh, I'm the director, Kevin Harris.
You can call me "Kev."

114
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:33,793
Uh, just carry on, do what you're doing.
We're not even here.

115
00:05:33,877 --> 00:05:36,588
That's Kev. He's got it under control.

116
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:41,635
And what if I wanna talk about
something in private?

117
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:44,888
It's not a problem. That's what
the confessional interviews are for.

118
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:49,142
Oh. Okay, so I can...
I could just say it to the camera.

119
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:52,020
- Sure.
- My girlfriend, she's lost her mind.

120
00:05:54,064 --> 00:05:55,899
She just...
She really probably needs a nap.

121
00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:57,710
She gets a little sleepy
after a long mission.

122
00:05:57,734 --> 00:06:00,028
Um... Oh, Mick!

123
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:02,489
Why don't you tell us all
what you do on the ship, huh?

124
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:05,325
I steal stuff.
Get out of my way, you putz.

125
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:08,870
Okay.
He's just joking. Uh, Ray!

126
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:11,790
Who else saved the multi-verse?

127
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:15,168
Oh. Uh, well, the Flash, Supergirl,

128
00:06:15,252 --> 00:06:16,836
- Batwoman...
- Cool.

129
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,171
- Yeah.
- What, no Superman?

130
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:19,649
Couldn't have been that big a deal.

131
00:06:19,673 --> 00:06:21,091
Oh, no, no, Superman was there.

132
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:22,634
He's very handsome.

133
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:25,053
- It's good to have you back, buddy.
- Yeah.

134
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:27,138
Hey, we're missing someone.

135
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,890
Where's Charlie?

136
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:30,392
Took the Jumpship for a joyride.

137
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:33,520
Oh, a joyride to check the timeline.

138
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:35,730
Right? It's called a time scout.

139
00:06:35,814 --> 00:06:38,858
Now, who wants to visit
the temporal zone? Shall we?

140
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:45,615
Guys, I'm still outside!
I'm still outside!

141
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:46,908
Don't leave me!

142
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:50,161
Hi, I'm Ray Palmer. The Atom.

143
00:06:50,245 --> 00:06:54,457
This documentary is an exciting
opportunity for me to improve my image.

144
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,586
<i>A lot of people still confuse me
for the demon</i>

145
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:00,171
<i>who possessed me
and opened up the gates of hell.</i>

146
00:07:00,255 --> 00:07:03,466
<i>His name was Neron,
and he is no longer with me.</i>

147
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,427
Or inside me, or...

148
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,346
I really wish that you could
meet my girlfriend Nora.

149
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,975
Uh, but she works
out of town a lot, internationally.

150
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,228
<i>She's got a lot of global clients.
Kids mostly.</i>

151
00:07:15,312 --> 00:07:16,688
She is a Fairy Godmother.

152
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,274
There's something behind you.

153
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,444
Is this a Timequake?

154
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:28,033
See? I knew the timeline was
still in jeopardy. What do we got?

155
00:07:28,116 --> 00:07:30,869
Time pirates? Time terrorism?
Time sex tourism?

156
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:32,162
Wow, Ava.

157
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:34,331
You could be a supervillain
if you applied yourself.

158
00:07:34,414 --> 00:07:36,249
Gideon, what's the point of origin?

159
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,878
It appears my Jonah Hex has...
Beebo loves... loves you.

160
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:41,421
Gideon may have a virus.

161
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:43,757
Doesn't she make everything work?

162
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,050
We are perfectly safe.

163
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:48,553
Guys, that was a Class 5 Timequake!
That is so dangerous.

164
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:51,598
Okay, guys, let's just try to
keep our composure, shall we?

165
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:55,894
I've triangulated the Timequake
to 1917 St. Petersburg, Russia.

166
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:58,563
Let's go and shrink the problem.

167
00:07:58,647 --> 00:07:59,814
- Uh...
- Not good.

168
00:07:59,898 --> 00:08:01,691
I'm developing a catchphrase?

169
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:03,777
Executing time jump now.

170
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,863
No, Gideon,
we're not taking a film crew to...

171
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,329
Imperial Russia. Yeah, great.

172
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:15,789
This is great, Ray.

173
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:19,834
All right, Legends,
put on your babushkas

174
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,380
because we are rushing into Russia.

175
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:25,757
And now, you're copying my thing.

176
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,360
Totally.
I just got really excited.

177
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:29,344
Okay, listen, babe,
this may seem like a problem,

178
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:31,596
but let's turn it into
a proble-tunity, huh?

179
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,974
Maybe a party-snake
is just what the doctor ordered.

180
00:08:35,058 --> 00:08:37,352
Uh, what's a party-snake?

181
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:39,854
"Sneak." Party-sneak.

182
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:42,440
<i>The wonder of time travel
is allowing our cameras</i>

183
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:45,735
<i>to capture some of the first
color images of Imperial Russia</i>

184
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:48,655
<i>as we ride along
on the Legends' patented party-sneak.</i>

185
00:08:48,738 --> 00:08:51,866
Turns out
it's more of a fun funeral-sneak.

186
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:53,242
Who died?

187
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:56,204
Grigori Rasputin,
aka The Mad Monk.

188
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:59,499
Equal parts mystic advisor
and manipulative hornball.

189
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,419
Rasputin was
notoriously hard to kill.

190
00:09:02,502 --> 00:09:05,839
It took cyanide, a gun,
and drowning before he stayed dead.

191
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:18,309
Um, guys...

192
00:09:18,852 --> 00:09:20,311
we sure he stayed dead?

193
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:29,195
Rasputin came back from the dead,
and it caused a Timequake.

194
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,782
Ugh, this is the kind of problem
that I can wrap my head around.

195
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:35,160
So, I need you guys

196
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:37,662
to forget about
this documentary film crew

197
00:09:37,746 --> 00:09:39,831
and focus on the mission at hand. Yes?

198
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:42,625
Yes, we need to minimize the mishap.

199
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,509
Oh, right,
that's good, because

200
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:46,796
saving the day
is what the Legends do best.

201
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,799
- Ava, you're in my shot.
- Oh, sorry.

202
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:51,603
Gideon, what does
the historical record say?

203
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:54,929
Perhaps time loop... time loop
released him from Marion Ravenwood.

204
00:09:55,013 --> 00:09:56,055
Of course!

205
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:58,558
Okay, B-money, with me.

206
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:01,269
We're gonna fix Gideon,
get our guests back to 2020.

207
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:04,856
Mona, Nate, Ray,
I want you three researching Rasputin.

208
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:06,539
Figure out
what his next move's gonna be.

209
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:07,984
Okay? Let's do it.

210
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:12,572
Hey, Ray, sorry.
But just...

211
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:14,616
Hey...

212
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:18,995
- is everything okay with Sara?
- Oh, um, I don't know,

213
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:22,457
but I do know that Oliver's death
was pretty tough on her.

214
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,292
Yeah.

215
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:27,712
Maybe you should write Sara
a condolence card.

216
00:10:32,592 --> 00:10:35,261
That's actually not a bad idea.
I guess I could

217
00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:38,431
put my thoughts and feelings into words
on a card.

218
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:43,019
What if more baddies started coming back
throughout history?

219
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:47,524
If they do,
we can call 'em "evil do-overs."

220
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:48,858
"Villa-agains."

221
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:51,110
I like "Encores."

222
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:54,340
- Mmm...
- It's a good idea.

223
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:56,991
- We could take a vote. Like a team vote.
- Okay, let's vote.

224
00:10:57,075 --> 00:10:58,743
- Encores.
- Villa-agains.

225
00:10:58,827 --> 00:10:59,869
Encores.

226
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:01,996
- Mmm...
- Don't be a jerk about it.

227
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:03,915
Encores!

228
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:06,417
<i>Meanwhile, back in New York,</i>

229
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:09,128
<i>Constantine and Gary
were doing some soul searching.</i>

230
00:11:10,255 --> 00:11:12,715
We're here with
the great mage John Constantine,

231
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,593
responding to an urgent call
regarding the supernatural.

232
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:18,137
Oh, bloody hell, Gary.

233
00:11:18,221 --> 00:11:21,683
You know I must have been off my rocker
when I made you my assistant.

234
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:25,979
- Mr. Constantine.
- It's what the card says, love.

235
00:11:26,062 --> 00:11:27,605
It's my son, Edgar.

236
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:31,025
I came home late from my shift,
usually he's up playing video games...

237
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:32,360
All right, love, there you go.

238
00:11:32,652 --> 00:11:35,113
Now, why don't you let me
take a look, eh?

239
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:48,501
- What's wrong with him?
- His PJs, for starters.

240
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:52,130
Do people really wear
matching pajama sets?

241
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:53,213
Yes.

242
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,138
John, wait!

243
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:05,143
Masher?

244
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:08,897
- Masher, is that you possessing the lad?
- Glad to see you escaped hell.

245
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:12,650
Yeah, I could say the same
about you, mate.

246
00:12:12,734 --> 00:12:15,153
Demon's gotta have his fun.

247
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:18,448
Yeah, well, I could murder a pint
right about now.

248
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:20,783
- Fancy a drink?
- You're buying.

249
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:21,993
You've got it. Let's go.

250
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,163
Uh, excuse me, greatest of warlocks,

251
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:27,498
but what about Edgar's mother?

252
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,792
Good thinking, G-man.

253
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:31,794
We'll take the fire escape.

254
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:40,720
What distable do you wix,
Captain Cat? What distable...

255
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:42,555
Easy on Gideon, Cap.

256
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,391
What are are you wixtable
Captain Cat... Captain Cat?

257
00:12:45,475 --> 00:12:48,895
Is everybody just
trying to get on my nerves today?

258
00:12:49,604 --> 00:12:52,982
Camera crew shows up and, what,
nobody can act like themselves?

259
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,401
The spotlight does weird things
to people.

260
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:56,819
But hey,

261
00:12:57,403 --> 00:12:58,988
you know I'll always be my true self.

262
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:01,282
Oh, yeah? Your true self?

263
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:03,260
Don't your parents think
you're in business school?

264
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:04,869
I am a tangled web.

265
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:06,746
Enough about me.

266
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,124
How are you doing with Oliver
and everything?

267
00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:13,461
I'm fine.

268
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:15,224
No worries,
we don't have to talk about it.

269
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:17,756
But...

270
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:20,593
I made you something.

271
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:24,681
Oh, please don't be a condolence card,
'cause those are always super awkward.

272
00:13:24,764 --> 00:13:26,933
Nah, hopefully, something better.

273
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:34,732
It's you, Ollie, and Laurel.

274
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:36,776
B, this is actually...

275
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:39,654
It's really sweet.

276
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:40,947
Thank you.

277
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:43,282
My condolence card wasn't awkward.

278
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:46,995
"Dear Sara,
I'm sorry the vigilante you slept with

279
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:48,798
when he was already
dating your sister died.

280
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,623
Some say it's better
to have loved and lost,

281
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:52,542
but I hope you never loved him at all."

282
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,503
Sara and I aren't the type
to give each other cards, anyway.

283
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:57,547
I'd rather do something for her,

284
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,591
you know, like fix this
Rasputin situation and get the Legends

285
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:03,761
the heck out of Russia
before they screw something up.

286
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:07,265
Uh, you can cut the last part
of that out, right?

287
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:11,352
Apparently, when Rasputin cured
the Tsarina's only son,

288
00:14:11,436 --> 00:14:13,938
<i>the two fell madly in love.</i>

289
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:18,651
I think if Rasputin realized
how much the Tsarina loved him,

290
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:20,194
he would wanna settle down with her,

291
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:22,697
lead the kind of quiet life
that doesn't disturb history.

292
00:14:22,822 --> 00:14:28,494
<i>Maybe Rebecca Silver's next series
could be called</i> Russian Nights.

293
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:32,540
So, the St. Petersburg elite hated
Rasputin's influence over the Tsarina.

294
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:36,502
So the Tsar's own nephew,
a prince by the name of Yusupov,

295
00:14:36,586 --> 00:14:39,672
<i>he spearheaded the assassination.</i>

296
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,885
Ray,

297
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,387
what if old Grigori came back,

298
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:48,264
- to settle the score?
- To settle the score.

299
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:58,608
We need to stop Rasputin
from killing Yusupov.

300
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,198
I'm going to deliver
a love letter to Rasputin.

301
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,993
I'm gonna kill Rasputin.

302
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:11,537
- You in?
- Yep!

303
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:18,795
Rasputin and I are two wandering souls
who got a second chance at life.

304
00:15:18,878 --> 00:15:22,715
He shouldn't waste his encore
on revenge. Damn it!

305
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:23,883
What?

306
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,719
Mona was right. "Encore" feels better.

307
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:29,263
It does. Plus, with my new Atom cam,

308
00:15:29,347 --> 00:15:32,475
everybody can watch us fixing history
without any bloodshed.

309
00:15:42,902 --> 00:15:44,946
And Yusupov's dead.

310
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:46,155
New plan.

311
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:47,508
Trespassers!

312
00:15:47,532 --> 00:15:51,494
Whoa, hey, whoa!
Don't... don't shoot. You either.

313
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,247
Um...

314
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,706
What do you want?

315
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,708
I'm here to interview Rasputin.

316
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:08,594
Grigori! Razzmatazz!

317
00:16:08,678 --> 00:16:11,389
Do people call you "Griggy"?

318
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:13,766
There's just been
a slight misunderstanding.

319
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,978
Um, your monk friends here think
I'm here to kill you,

320
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:19,480
uh, when really,
I just would like to chat.

321
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:23,860
Oh, this? This is, uh, my camera crew.

322
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:27,155
We're producing a news reel
about your startling return.

323
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:32,243
After all, you're not a big deal
until you're a big deal on camera.

324
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:42,295
Grigori Rasputin. Monk. Mystic.

325
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:48,092
It is hard coming back to life.
I think, "What will make me happy?"

326
00:16:48,176 --> 00:16:50,219
So, I killed the man who killed me.

327
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:53,014
But am I happy? Eh...

328
00:16:53,598 --> 00:16:56,934
I'll give you Yusupov. He had it coming.

329
00:16:57,018 --> 00:16:58,728
But let's talk big picture, Griggy.

330
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:01,189
- You rose from the dead.
- Mmm-hmm.

331
00:17:01,272 --> 00:17:02,607
That's wild.

332
00:17:02,982 --> 00:17:07,111
Nate, what are you doing?
Now, you're in my shot.

333
00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:08,571
To be honest with you,

334
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,781
I'm here to find out
what makes you tick.

335
00:17:11,324 --> 00:17:14,202
Are we killing folks?

336
00:17:14,577 --> 00:17:16,787
Or chilling with folks?

337
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,207
Sorry, Nate, this one's for Sara.

338
00:17:19,582 --> 00:17:20,822
I got your back, Nate.

339
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,294
Size small, standing tall!

340
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:25,796
What the...

341
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,882
- Ray!
- Hey! Ow.

342
00:17:29,884 --> 00:17:31,124
<i>Get outta there!</i>

343
00:17:32,345 --> 00:17:34,055
Rory, you're up.

344
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:37,849
Mona's here.

345
00:17:38,184 --> 00:17:39,894
Of course she is.

346
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:43,522
Hi, guys, I forged a letter
that's gonna save history.

347
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:48,736
That's for Rasputin.

348
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:54,325
Hmm, not bad.
Nice use of "musky embrace."

349
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:56,535
I learned
from Rebecca Silver.

350
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:58,412
Well, you learned from the best.

351
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:02,917
You know, your aura is quite strong.

352
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,461
I get that a lot.
I rotate hair products.

353
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:08,339
Like me, you too
have experienced a miracle.

354
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,800
God brought you back to life.

355
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:14,595
But there's something missing.

356
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:18,391
I sense a hole in your heart.

357
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,602
There. Right there.

358
00:18:22,812 --> 00:18:25,147
You once loved someone,

359
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:28,276
but you have forgotten.

360
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:31,320
Allow me to hypnotize you,

361
00:18:31,404 --> 00:18:34,198
and I will help you recover
everything you have lost.

362
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,580
<i>Don't even
think about it, Nate.</i>

363
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,704
Thank you, Rasputin,
but I'm gonna have to say yes.

364
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:41,747
100%, let's do this.

365
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:44,917
<i>As Nate's party
was about to get started...</i>

366
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:46,794
<i>...Constantine's was coming to an end.</i>

367
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:49,147
It's not right bringing a kid in here.

368
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:52,174
Oh, piss off, you puritan twit!

369
00:18:52,258 --> 00:18:53,676
I've gotta ask, Masher.

370
00:18:55,386 --> 00:18:56,721
Has she done it?

371
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:58,532
I don't know what
you're talking about, John.

372
00:18:58,556 --> 00:19:00,891
Don't be coy with me.

373
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:05,271
Has Astra released
the worst souls from hell onto Earth?

374
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,482
What can I say?

375
00:19:08,566 --> 00:19:11,027
The girl's all grown up
and making money moves.

376
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:13,237
The question is,

377
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:15,990
what are you gonna do?

378
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,784
I don't need to do anything about it,
all right?

379
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:21,537
My life is settled right now.

380
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,664
I'm not gonna stir up
a hornet's nest of trouble

381
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:27,293
because Astra Logue wants to
break the glass ceiling in hell.

382
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:29,086
Is that so?

383
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:35,134
You smug git.

384
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,594
Right then...

385
00:19:38,012 --> 00:19:40,473
- Sorry about this.
- No. At least let me...

386
00:19:44,477 --> 00:19:46,771
You're a bastard, John.

387
00:19:57,615 --> 00:19:59,575
- Where's my mom?
- Gary!

388
00:19:59,784 --> 00:20:02,411
Yes, Master of the Dark Arts.

389
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:04,872
Hail the <i>Waverider,</i> will you?

390
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:08,626
- We need to warn the Legends.
- Uh, but what about Edgar?

391
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,294
Ah, you know, give him the usual.

392
00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:13,964
One taxi and a lollipop coming up.

393
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:19,929
I see you, you creep.

394
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:24,350
What? What do you want?

395
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,312
You want my confessional?

396
00:20:29,355 --> 00:20:31,857
All right. Come here,
I'll give one to you.

397
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:36,320
I confess that I hate this doc.

398
00:20:36,404 --> 00:20:40,074
I confess that
I don't want to be a celebrity,

399
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:43,369
and I confess
that if you don't get that camera

400
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:45,371
- out of my face...
- Captain!

401
00:20:45,663 --> 00:20:48,082
I think Gideon is suffering
from phantom data.

402
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,668
Do you want me to come back later?

403
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:52,837
No. You should stay.

404
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,590
Stay with me, hang out. Let's get lit.

405
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,635
Questionable timing,
but should I get my stash box?

406
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,095
Yes, you should.

407
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:03,222
Captain,
I have an incoming Bollywood.

408
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:09,270
<i>Sara,
what's with the connection?</i>

409
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:12,398
Gideon has a bug, and we're trying
to get buzzed. What do you want?

410
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:15,151
<i>Uh, listen up, all right?
Some of the most evil souls</i>

411
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:17,194
<i>in all of history
are being raised from hell.</i>

412
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:19,488
<i>- Did you hear him? He said "hell."
- Get out.</i>

413
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:22,575
Relax, Nathaniel.

414
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:26,162
Focus on my voice and this bauble.

415
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:31,542
Now, drop into
the deepest part of yourself.

416
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:35,171
Quivering flesh go here...

417
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:36,881
<i>That's good.</i>

418
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:40,593
And what if we've already run into
one of these Encores?

419
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:42,470
How do we kill it?

420
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:43,679
<i>You can't.</i>

421
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:46,265
<i>Not with the chit
to their soul still in hell.</i>

422
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,643
<i>Where's Ava? Tell her I said hi.</i>

423
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:52,605
I see a woman in the shadows.

424
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:54,106
Walk to her.

425
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:58,486
She's beautiful.

426
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:00,112
Silky raven hair...

427
00:22:01,489 --> 00:22:03,616
...eyes you could just
stare into forever...

428
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:06,452
And she's stuffing her face with donuts.

429
00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:19,757
God has spared Rasputin again!

430
00:22:20,216 --> 00:22:21,258
Kill her!

431
00:22:26,055 --> 00:22:26,971
Rory!

432
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,280
Nate, I'm coming for you, buddy.

433
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:53,332
Nate, snap out of it.

434
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,376
- I remember her, Ray.
- Who?

435
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:58,045
I don't know her name,
but she was on the ship with us.

436
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,673
Mission's blown.
We need to retreat.

437
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:02,841
<i>I'm not done with you, you rats!</i>

438
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:04,510
<i>Good thing Sara's not watching this.</i>

439
00:23:18,274 --> 00:23:21,694
So, you guys decided to go off
on your own and face Rasputin?

440
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,487
I thought I could calm him down.

441
00:23:23,571 --> 00:23:25,864
I thought I could make him fall in love.

442
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:28,784
And I thought I could,
you know, assassinate him.

443
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:33,414
None of that was ever going to happen.
He's fresh out of Hell.

444
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:36,750
- Well, let's kill him, then.
- You... you can't!

445
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:38,877
Look, John said that he can't be killed

446
00:23:38,961 --> 00:23:41,463
while the chit of his soul
is in hell, or...

447
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:43,340
Whatever that means.

448
00:23:43,424 --> 00:23:44,717
Look, Sara, we're really sorry.

449
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:46,653
We thought we could
make things easier for you

450
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:48,262
by... by taking this off of your plate.

451
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:50,014
And risking your own necks?

452
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:52,975
Look, I already have
one dead friend on my plate,

453
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:54,059
I'm good there.

454
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,769
And you know,

455
00:23:56,437 --> 00:24:00,065
none of you self-absorbed megastars
even bothered

456
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:02,276
to ask me how I was doing.

457
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:05,696
Look, Sara, I...
I told them not to mention Oliver, okay?

458
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,823
I thought you wouldn't
want to be reminded.

459
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:09,116
Reminded?

460
00:24:09,617 --> 00:24:10,701
What...

461
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:14,371
Did you think that I could just forget
that my friend died?

462
00:24:14,455 --> 00:24:15,706
No, I...

463
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,708
Look, I know things have been
crazy around here.

464
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,460
Crazy around here?

465
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:23,505
You still have no idea
what I saw out there.

466
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:25,548
What did happen?

467
00:24:27,468 --> 00:24:29,845
Countless Earths died.

468
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:34,016
I became a Paragon
and traveled back to the Big Bang.

469
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:35,643
We restarted the universe,

470
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:38,270
and now, no one even remembers
what we've changed.

471
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:42,483
- It's a lot to process.
- Yeah, I know.

472
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:47,738
So, you could see why I want to
talk to my friends about it,

473
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:50,324
and instead, I get cameras

474
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:53,035
in my face.

475
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,350
<i>"Agent Sharpe
lacks a delicate touch</i>

476
00:24:58,374 --> 00:25:01,710
and is extremely deficient
at relating to people."

477
00:25:01,794 --> 00:25:05,381
That is straight from
my Time Bureau personnel review.

478
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:07,424
Pretty harsh.

479
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,011
I wrote that review.

480
00:25:11,387 --> 00:25:13,847
Yeah, of course I'm bummed
that we let Sara down,

481
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:16,934
but I am glad I got to meet Rasputin.
Little help?

482
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:24,900
I mean, the guy
got in my head and laid a bomb.

483
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:27,695
- He freaked your bean, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

484
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:31,615
He also told me about the mystery woman
that I was in love with before I died.

485
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:34,201
I know it sounds crazy, but it just...

486
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:35,536
It feels right.

487
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,955
Sounds like you got
some soul searching to do.

488
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:40,040
Wanna watch <i>How Stella Got
Her Groove Back</i> again?

489
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,211
No, my groove feels fine.

490
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:47,589
You think I have either split memory
or partial amnesia?

491
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:50,509
That's like what's happening
with Gideon.

492
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,570
Her memory is processing
what I thought was phantom data,

493
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,638
but maybe it's real data
from a different timeline.

494
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:58,726
Either you're a computer who caught
the same virus as Gideon...

495
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:02,271
Or, when we fixed Heyworld,
we changed the timeline.

496
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,250
Damn, we deducted the hell outta that.

497
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:05,272
I have to tell Sara.

498
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:07,460
Wait. Five minutes. Five minutes.
Stay on the inversion table.

499
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:09,111
Your back's gonna thank me.

500
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:14,366
Okay, so clearly, we shouldn't
have avoided asking Sara about Oliver,

501
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,702
but in my defense,
I was desperately afraid

502
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:18,495
I was gonna say the wrong thing,
you know?

503
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:22,541
I don't know what she needs, and
everything I try seems to make it worse.

504
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,962
Hold on, Behrad, so, you're saying

505
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:28,922
Gideon's glitching
because we fractured time?

506
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:30,758
Look, at least we didn't break time.

507
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:32,968
We just sort of dinged it up.

508
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:34,720
<i>Hello?</i>

509
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:37,389
What is on the feed?

510
00:26:37,473 --> 00:26:40,350
- <i>Is this thing on?
- Yes, we're rolling, Mr. Rasputin, sir.</i>

511
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:41,685
<i>Good. Get out.</i>

512
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,024
Now, what was it that man
with the hair product said?

513
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:48,358
Yes.

514
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:52,154
"You're not big deal
until you're big deal on camera."

515
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:55,449
<i>You are going to make me big deal,
Mr. Kevin Harris.</i>

516
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:57,284
They left the director behind?

517
00:26:57,367 --> 00:27:00,454
<i>I've invited my dearest Tsarina
and her family over for dinner.</i>

518
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:01,830
Tonight

519
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:06,126
will be a night
that you can remember.

520
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:10,130
That... that doesn't sound right.

521
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:11,215
What?

522
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:13,509
The... the laugh.
You need to nail the laugh

523
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:15,594
before we kill the Romanovs
and take the throne.

524
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:17,888
It's a work in progress.
How about this...

525
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:25,938
He's gonna kill the Romanovs.

526
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:28,482
Making him an immortal Tsar.

527
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:31,568
We can handle this.

528
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:33,278
We can? What about the team?

529
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:36,824
Shh. They're not thinking straight,
and their cover's blown.

530
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:38,742
Look, this is up to you and me, B.

531
00:27:38,826 --> 00:27:41,078
We're gonna stop
this assassination alone.

532
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:42,704
Yes.

533
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,665
Yes.

534
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:55,884
What's this?
Is this a smudge on this goblet?

535
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:58,929
Every detail must be perfect.

536
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:02,266
Tonight, I am dining
with the Imperial Family.

537
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:04,601
Take it back.

538
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:09,273
They are going to love the tea cakes.

539
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:12,985
I've laced them with cyanide.

540
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,989
Hello? Kevin? Right here.

541
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:21,785
- Your guests have arrived.
- The Romanovs are here!

542
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:24,496
Welcome.

543
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:28,959
It is such a shame that
your daughters could not attend.

544
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:32,129
I know how much they must have missed
their Uncle Rasputin.

545
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:35,966
Word of your death
sent them into mourning,

546
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:39,344
but none were so heartbroken as I.

547
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:40,470
Oh.

548
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:42,848
Music!

549
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:52,316
How did you manage to survive
being poisoned, shot,

550
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,027
and thrown into the river, Grigori?

551
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,029
Oh, I have a very hearty constitution.

552
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:00,823
Damn it.

553
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:03,911
The Red Wedding's about to start,
and I don't see the tea cakes anywhere.

554
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:07,122
All I see is cookies.

555
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:10,167
Tea cakes? My favorite.

556
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,711
The cookies are the tea cakes.

557
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,507
What is the meaning of this?

558
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:20,719
Forgive me, sire, I saw a bug.

559
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:27,225
Grigori, what is going on?

560
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:28,602
<i>What have you done?</i>

561
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:31,146
Oops. I think we forgot the cameraman.

562
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:34,232
That's Kevin, the director.
He's really more of an auteur.

563
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:35,943
We should get out there.

564
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:37,736
Sara clearly wants to handle this alone.

565
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:40,030
But are we gonna let her?

566
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:43,741
Go.

567
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:47,829
Nicholas, Alexei, come.

568
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:49,081
Wait!

569
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:52,918
You will stay exactly where you are.

570
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:56,004
For years, I have flattered you both,

571
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,757
our subjects adore you,

572
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,051
the army needs you,

573
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:04,471
and look at the state
of our beloved Russia.

574
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:05,639
Hey.

575
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:08,725
Let me guess, you're the only one
that can save it.

576
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:11,603
- Not today, Grigori.
- Who are you?

577
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:17,943
No matter. Perhaps I didn't give
an adequate demonstration of my bauble.

578
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:26,076
Attack this serving wench!

579
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:48,015
Come on, Behrad, snap out of it.

580
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:49,266
Rasputin.

581
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:52,853
The Grand Duchess Anastasia is here.

582
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,064
No. Anastasia, run!

583
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:58,400
So glad you could join our soiree.

584
00:30:58,525 --> 00:30:59,693
Me, too.

585
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:06,700
Hey.

586
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:09,411
You're going to have to
do better than that!

587
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:14,124
Sorry.

588
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:18,962
Come on, follow me. Go!

589
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:27,637
Move it!

590
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:43,153
Didn't hurt.

591
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:46,031
All right, this way.
You're gonna hide to be safe.

592
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:50,994
Look, Sara, I...

593
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:54,206
wish I was the person
who could say the perfect thing...

594
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:55,289
Behind you.

595
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:01,254
But, listen, I'm just...
I'm not that person, okay?

596
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:03,465
Emotions are hard for me,
and I don't even know what

597
00:32:03,548 --> 00:32:06,134
restarting the universe means.
Behind you.

598
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,057
Listen to me.
Whatever happened to you, okay?

599
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,518
Whatever happens to you,

600
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:17,687
I wanna be the person
that's there for you. Okay?

601
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:19,898
I'm here for you, Sara.

602
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:29,658
Ava, that was perfect.

603
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:33,036
Oh, sorry to, uh,
ruin the moment, ladies,

604
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,329
but we have a problem.

605
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:35,956
Come on.

606
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,418
Kill the Imperial Family!

607
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:45,422
Guys, come on,

608
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:47,303
we don't need to use violence here.

609
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:49,678
Ray!

610
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:59,020
Sara, think of something.

611
00:32:59,104 --> 00:33:02,274
Hey, Grigori! It's your big moment.

612
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,693
Don't you wanna ham it up
for the cameras?

613
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:06,194
Oh, yes.

614
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:11,283
I'm Grigori Rasputin,
and I'm unkillable!

615
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,876
Guys? Where am I? What happened?

616
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:23,503
Don't think, Ray. Just enlarge.

617
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:24,689
<i>Why's it so dark in here?</i>

618
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:27,549
Am I in a lake? A...
A lake that smells like perogies?

619
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:29,926
Ray, do it. Get big now.

620
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:31,386
Embiggify!

621
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:33,305
<i>Your atomic number is up!</i>

622
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:34,598
Now, Ray!

623
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:36,765
Size...

624
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:39,019
matters!

625
00:33:42,731 --> 00:33:45,400
Oh, no, what did...
What did I do?

626
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:47,694
You found your catchphrase, Ray.

627
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:50,113
- What the hell?
- Raw meat.

628
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:51,531
The question is,

629
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,200
did you get the shot, Kevin?

630
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:56,828
Uh, yeah, I got it.

631
00:33:57,662 --> 00:33:59,724
<i>You know, I chalk it up
to saving the timeline.</i>

632
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:01,333
<i>History has to be saved,</i>

633
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:04,377
and sometimes, you have
to take some people out, I guess.

634
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:06,880
The public is gonna love this ending.

635
00:34:06,963 --> 00:34:09,132
- It's only missing one thing.
- Hmm?

636
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:28,401
<i>Saving history turned out
to be a messierjob</i>

637
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:30,278
<i>than anyone had anticipated.</i>

638
00:34:31,863 --> 00:34:33,365
<i>To keep Rasputin from reforming,</i>

639
00:34:33,448 --> 00:34:36,243
<i>the Legends stored his remains
in a series ofjars</i>

640
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:38,328
<i>that had previously been used
for condiments.</i>

641
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:47,629
<i>You might have thought
travelling through time</i>

642
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:51,508
<i>would be a way to find the answers
to life's great mysteries...</i>

643
00:34:51,883 --> 00:34:55,971
<i>but it turns out,
sometimes, you just find more questions.</i>

644
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:06,564
<i>But one thing is true
in any time period,</i>

645
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:11,820
<i>it's being there for the ones you love
that makes the journey worthwhile.</i>

646
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,959
Hear that applause?
This movie is not even gonna begin

647
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:28,670
to satiate the Legends craze.
You know what this is?

648
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:29,921
This is a TV show.

649
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:32,215
I'm talking cameras on every mission.

650
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:34,301
Sara, you okay? You look nauseous.

651
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:37,512
Yeah, she's fine. And when you go
out there, just... just be yourselves.

652
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:40,473
- But, you know, bigger.
- Like, bigger how?

653
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:41,641
Just act heroic.

654
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,768
You guys have
a real Bad News Bears vibe.

655
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:45,270
It's not doing you any favors.

656
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:48,356
Now that you're big-time,
people expect you to put on a show.

657
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,608
So, you're asking us
not to be ourselves?

658
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,320
This guy gets it. Let's do this.

659
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:06,082
Hi, everybody.
We are the Legends...

660
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:09,627
...and we just wanted to say thank you
for watching our film.

661
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:11,463
We hope that you enjoyed it.

662
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:23,641
Of course, uh,
none of it was real.

663
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:26,436
No, way! It's not real?

664
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:29,064
Excuse me? Uh, she's joking.

665
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:31,483
No, I'm not. Come on, time travel?

666
00:36:31,566 --> 00:36:33,818
It's the biggest hoax in history,
am I right?

667
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:37,238
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean,
it's obvious that this is all fake.

668
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:38,632
How could Rasputin speak English?

669
00:36:38,656 --> 00:36:40,867
You told me it was
temporal linguistic dysplasia.

670
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,827
I mean, if we had so much as coughed,

671
00:36:42,911 --> 00:36:45,914
our modern germs would have
wiped out half the population.

672
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:49,292
Why wouldn't we just find baby Hitler
and make him wrestle baby Stalin?

673
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:50,376
Think about it.

674
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:53,004
The special effects
were kind of questionable.

675
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:55,507
Shut up!

676
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,633
It's not real.

677
00:36:57,592 --> 00:36:58,927
All right, everybody,

678
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,222
I guess that just means don't believe
everything you see on camera.

679
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:03,985
Yeah, it was all
just a big fake spectacle,

680
00:37:04,015 --> 00:37:05,159
just like Heyworld last year.

681
00:37:05,183 --> 00:37:07,560
We are all a bunch of frauds.

682
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:09,687
Big frauds, everybody.

683
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:12,649
- You guys ruined my movie.
- Yeah, sorry.

684
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:21,950
This is for the best, right?

685
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:24,428
Maybe, maybe not. I don't know.
I feel like I'm supposed to say that.

686
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:26,830
We're better off.
Fame messes with people.

687
00:37:26,913 --> 00:37:28,415
We still have that money problem.

688
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,542
Oh, I almost forgot.

689
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:32,168
Mick?

690
00:37:36,881 --> 00:37:38,007
I steal things.

691
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:41,511
Whoa. Is that a Fabergé egg?

692
00:37:41,594 --> 00:37:42,594
Mmm-hmm.

693
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:45,306
- What's that worth?
- Fifty million.

694
00:37:46,724 --> 00:37:47,725
Whoa!

695
00:37:48,726 --> 00:37:50,228
Careful with that, babes.

696
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:53,940
John, what...
What are you doing here?

697
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:57,944
I heard your movie premiere was in town
tonight, so, I thought I'd pop in.

698
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:02,866
Well, just make yourself at home, then!

699
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:05,160
Why can't he ever
just be normal?

700
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,832
What are you doing?

701
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:13,585
Yeah,
I need to borrow something.

702
00:38:13,668 --> 00:38:17,088
Rasputin wasn't an isolated incident.

703
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:19,681
Not isolated?
What do you mean?

704
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:23,261
- Okay. Hey, whoa! No, no, don't do it...
- Don't!

705
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,769
I'm plumbing into this.

706
00:38:31,853 --> 00:38:34,189
Wait. Are you trying to go back to Hell?

707
00:38:35,106 --> 00:38:38,318
Soul become my soul,
flesh become my flesh.

708
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,487
Hades, firstborn of Cronus,

709
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:42,572
I call upon you.

710
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:45,700
Hey, John, there's gotta be another way.

711
00:38:45,783 --> 00:38:48,328
I'll return when the sigil is complete.

712
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:50,914
John?

713
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,918
You take care, you lunatic.

714
00:38:55,877 --> 00:38:59,214
I always do, love. I always do.

715
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:12,894
You know,
sometimes what happens on this ship

716
00:39:12,977 --> 00:39:15,396
really would be hard
for an audience to follow.

717
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:22,403
That love letter you wrote,

718
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:23,780
it was good.

719
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:26,366
Very good.

720
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:30,954
Gee, thank you, Mick.
This means so much coming from you.

721
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:35,959
Listen, um, I'm giving up the writing.
It's getting in the way of my thievery.

722
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:39,587
So, I'm handing the Rebecca Silver
novels over to you.

723
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:41,005
Someone deserving.

724
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:45,552
Me?

725
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:49,806
This is... This is so much.
Are you sure?

726
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:52,141
Yes, I'm sure. That's why I'm saying it.

727
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:57,355
There's a novelist inside you.

728
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:01,901
There's more inside of me
than just Wolfie?

729
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:04,028
Yes. That's right.

730
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:11,244
Well, it was great living with you
on the <i>Waverider.</i>

731
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,540
- What?
- Yeah, I... I can't stay here to write.

732
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:17,333
I need to be free.

733
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:20,545
I need to fall in love and break hearts.

734
00:40:20,628 --> 00:40:23,506
I can't do Rebecca Silver justice here.

735
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,506
But... But I...

736
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:27,385
But you tried writing on the ship
and ran out of ideas?

737
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:28,511
I mean, frankly, Mick,

738
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:32,515
your latest novel <i>Carjacked,</i>
it sucked.

739
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:37,312
But don't worry. Rebecca Silver
is about to have her comeback.

740
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:40,106
You'll see.

741
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:46,112
You were my favorite.

742
00:40:53,703 --> 00:40:55,371
How's it going, Gideon?

743
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:57,975
The phantom memory scrub
is proceeding without a hitch.

744
00:40:57,999 --> 00:41:01,252
The flaws only go
as far back as the last two years.

745
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:03,105
Oh, it feels good
to get my thoughts straight.

746
00:41:03,129 --> 00:41:04,714
Good work, Gidi.

747
00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:07,467
- I'm turning in.
- Good night, B.

748
00:41:07,884 --> 00:41:09,969
- Don't stay up too late, Nate.
- You got it.

749
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:11,554
- Dr. Heywood?
- Mmm.

750
00:41:11,638 --> 00:41:14,015
I have encountered a glitch
during the Heyworld event.

751
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:16,184
Show me.

752
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:32,742
<i>Nate...</i>

753
00:41:34,327 --> 00:41:36,704
<i>if you're seeing this,
we altered my future at Heyworld.</i>

754
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:38,831
<i>I don't know where I'll be
or who I'll be, but...</i>

755
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:40,917
<i>I know that I love you.</i>

756
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:44,379
<i>Find me.</i>

757
00:41:46,214 --> 00:41:49,634
Gideon! Gideon, who was that?
Play it again.

758
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:51,344
Memory scrub complete.
