1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:02,996
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,913
I have walked this earth for centuries.

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:09,507
Only you can kill me
and only with that dagger.

4
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,802
- What did I say?
- I can help you get Tabitha back.

5
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,597
Professor Hugo Strange is the one man
who can cure you.

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,061
Join me, and we will find him.

7
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,348
Okay. But you'd better deliver.

8
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,233
Why would I help you?

9
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,731
You love me. You've loved me all along.

10
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:34,695
What's your record for how many banks
you've robbed in one day?

11
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,447
<i>You're playing a dangerous game, Lee.</i>

12
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:39,988
<i>Ra's al Ghul chose you
to pass on his spirit.</i>

13
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,244
<i>We have much more to show you.</i>

14
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:46,498
<i>All my life, I have known
that I was meant for more.</i>

15
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:47,919
<i>This isn't you.</i>

16
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,415
I'm not gonna let your jealousy
distract me.

17
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:54,211
Ladies, escort Ms. Galavan
to the street.

18
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,088
<i>We serve the one and only
true master, Ra's al Ghul.</i>

19
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,428
- But he's dead.
- Death is only an illusion.

20
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:26,826
What the hell?

21
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,704
- You didn't sense our approach?
- No, you're ninjas.

22
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,539
The Demon's Head gives its bearer power

23
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,465
to see past, present, future as one.

24
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,293
You should have anticipated our attack.

25
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,506
So this was a test?

26
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,672
I'm The Demon's Head.

27
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,598
My hand is a fricking light bulb.

28
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:42,971
That is only its mark.

29
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,269
You have yet to access its real powers.

30
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,438
You're questioning whether I'm worthy?

31
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,561
I'm sick of this.

32
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,401
The men from the League,
Tabitha, and now you?

33
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,694
You misunderstand.

34
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:57,365
How do you think Ra's al Ghul became
the world's most fearsome warrior

35
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,783
and ruled empires?

36
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,285
He saw the future.

37
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,288
So, attacking me was what,

38
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,162
a way to jump-start it, like,
"Hey, Demon's Head, snap to it?"

39
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:11,170
The powers of The Demon's Head
are triggered by intense emotions.

40
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,795
All right. So next time,
don't go so easy on me.

41
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,302
And take that knife out of my face.

42
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,315
You don't have a covert mode
on this thing?

43
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,800
Show-off.

44
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,425
So, you're gonna tell me
what Tabitha needs us for?

45
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:05,634
All I know is it's about Barbara,
and it's important.

46
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,362
- So, what's the emergency?
- Inside.

47
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,274
You coming?

48
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,684
Tabitha, what am I doing here?

49
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,181
- What the heck?
- Wait.

50
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,482
What the hell? What is this?

51
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,025
I don't know.
She didn't tell me this part.

52
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,728
Barbara needs our help.
She's gonna get herself killed.

53
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,188
She has this thing
called The Demon's Head.

54
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,276
- This is about Ra's al Ghul?
- He's the one who gave it to her.

55
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,656
These guys are gonna
help us take it back.

56
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,654
Okay, so why do you need Bruce?

57
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,038
You're gonna bring him back.

58
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,385
You can't do this. Ra's wanted to die.

59
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,344
He wanted me to kill him.

60
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,345
And now we need him alive.

61
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,677
No, no, no!

62
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,935
No, no!

63
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:46,321
Bone, flesh, breath.
Come back to us, our leader.

64
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,535
Now we close the circle.

65
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,454
We give you the blood
of the one who slew you.

66
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,249
No.

67
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,093
You have no idea
what you've done!

68
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,995
Five banks in one night? You're joking.

69
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,792
I wish. These guys were slick.

70
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,619
Banks didn't even know
they were hit till they opened.

71
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,956
One of the banks, the thieves came
in on boats through the sewer.

72
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,122
Tunneled up into the vaults.

73
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,377
All branches of Gotham Savings
and Loan. Why the same bank?

74
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,262
Maybe a leak in security,
maybe a grudge.

75
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,547
Five banks in one night.

76
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,674
It's like someone was trying
to make a point.

77
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,224
Prove how smart he is.

78
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,807
- Ed Nygma?
- The bowler fits.

79
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,308
Should I put out a BOLO on him?

80
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,440
Sure. In the meantime,
there's someone else I can talk to.

81
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,316
Say hey to Lee for me, won't you?
Tell her, nice shooting Sofia.

82
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,908
What, I can't make a joke?

83
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,192
That's what that was?

84
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,658
Why don't you go
put that BOLO out?

85
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,466
- Here you go. No problem.
- Thanks.

86
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,085
Look at them.

87
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,470
We did good.

88
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,051
Oh, yeah.

89
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,508
My brilliance allowed us to rob
five banks in one night.

90
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,601
Now these fine folks of The Narrows

91
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,770
are gonna be drowning in booze
and smokes for years to come.

92
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,601
So inspiring.

93
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,683
They're also gonna
use the money to buy food

94
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,692
and clothing and medicine.

95
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,229
What's wrong?

96
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,526
What am I to you?

97
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,740
A friend. A partner.

98
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,079
Are you always this amorous
with your friends?

99
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,122
I mean, I know that only happened once.

100
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,669
- Ed.
- Don't call me Ed.

101
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,540
Hey, I care about you.

102
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:07,633
I depend on you.

103
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,295
You know what we've got planned.

104
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,259
Other things are just
gonna have to wait.

105
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,891
You're not stringing me along,
are you, Lee?

106
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,143
Don't you wanna find out?

107
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:20,889
The answer to the riddle?

108
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,106
Maybe I do.

109
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,067
Are we good for tomorrow night?

110
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,565
Yeah. We just have a few last details.

111
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,244
And trust me,
this is gonna be a work of art.

112
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,371
That sounds promising.

113
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,284
Oh, what the hell, count us in.

114
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,427
You could've told me.

115
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,008
- You wouldn't have brought him.
- Yeah, because he's my friend.

116
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,635
And what is Barbara? What am I?

117
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,675
Pick a side and stick to it.

118
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,600
Do you know what you've done?

119
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,649
The years I spent planning my death.

120
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,648
- Now you've ruined it!
- Master.

121
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,526
The woman you gave The Demon's Head to,

122
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,073
she started a war.

123
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,989
I started that war!

124
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,987
The League of Shadows was rotten

125
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,165
and only through violence
could it be reborn.

126
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,881
Master, our lives are yours to take.

127
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,964
But this woman
does not serve the League.

128
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,380
Her goals are limited. Selfish.

129
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:37,932
That's Barbara all right.

130
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,263
Whatever faith you had
in her was misplaced.

131
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,679
If she keeps The Demon's Head,
the League shall die.

132
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,515
Wait, what do you mean,
"if she keeps The Demon's Head"?

133
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,059
I thought you were supposed to get it
the second you...

134
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:50,985
Came back.

135
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,570
No. Barbara must give it to me.

136
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,448
She'll never do that.

137
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:03,203
Then I'll kill her
and rip it from her corpse.

138
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,045
You owe us.

139
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,086
I'm sorry.

140
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:16,837
We owe you how?

141
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,803
Because we made you.

142
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:24,645
Both of you. Without me, you would
still be trapped inside Ed.

143
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,308
And you would still be stitching up
busted lips ringside.

144
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,819
I need money to buy back Sofia's capos.

145
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,235
Butch is saving
for future medical expenses.

146
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,448
What'd you make last night?
Three, four million?

147
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,870
Say we go halfsies.

148
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,702
I've heard your offer.

149
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,335
And here's my counter. Bite me.

150
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,205
I don't like people coming into my club,

151
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,840
telling me what to do.
And I don't like threats,

152
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,509
implicit or otherwise,

153
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,214
and I really don't like
people telling me they made me.

154
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,007
Well said, Lee.

155
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,229
- Oh, God. Are you kidding me?
- What?

156
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,723
Okay, we're done.

157
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,776
I thought you got past all that
when you became the Riddler.

158
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:12,976
Past what?

159
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,609
Ed's pathetic adoration of her.

160
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,567
But, no, clearly,
he passed it all into you,

161
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,151
like a virus.

162
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,329
She knows it and she's using you.

163
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,159
Shame on you,
stringing along this troubled man.

164
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,332
- Get out!
- I don't think so.

165
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,085
We did not come here for violence.

166
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,551
We came here hoping our friends
would honor their debts.

167
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,758
Let us hope they come to their senses.

168
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,803
A little advice.

169
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:48,642
Be sure to skim some off the top
when she tosses you aside.

170
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,202
Kind of defeats the purpose
if I can hear you.

171
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,378
Hello, Barbara.

172
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:17,708
Ra's.

173
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,173
Don't be afraid.

174
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,849
What happened?
How are you even...

175
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,141
It's a long story.

176
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:27,843
But tell me,

177
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,771
what have you done with my gift?

178
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,019
Well, you might have left a how-to.

179
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,774
Plus, a heads-up
to your League of Shadows cronies.

180
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,775
Turns out the old boys' club don't
appreciate a woman calling the shots.

181
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,822
But you have plans

182
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,038
on rebuilding the League of Shadows?
You've read

183
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,374
the histories that I left for you?

184
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,462
I've read them.
But I need to do my own thing.

185
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,338
Your "own thing"?

186
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,668
With the power you gave me,

187
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:04,176
I can rule Gotham
like no one ever has before.

188
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,557
The people will worship me like a queen.

189
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,972
How disappointing.

190
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,769
You're right.
They should worship me like a god.

191
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:18,478
Enough. Give me your hand
so that I can take it back.

192
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:23,362
No. It is mine. You promised me!

193
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,195
I was mistaken in you, Barbara.

194
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:28,950
"Mistaken"?

195
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,914
Tell that to her.

196
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,582
You think that is you.

197
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:44,504
She was just a whore.

198
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:49,717
I killed her out of pity.

199
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,969
You're lying.

200
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,181
The Demon's Head is my destiny.

201
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:59,269
Then why have you
not unlocked its secrets?

202
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:04,281
You sad, deluded woman.

203
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,528
You thought you were
a reincarnated queen.

204
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:15,873
But in truth, you're just
an unstable nightclub owner,

205
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:20,797
<i>whose greatest accomplishment
was the murder of her own parents.</i>

206
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,417
<i>You are nothing.</i>

207
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,004
Now, give me your hand.

208
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:31,933
Or I will kill you
and take The Demon's Head by force.

209
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,100
Try it, zombie boy.

210
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,755
Get her out of here. Go!

211
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,340
I'm fine.

212
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,140
Get in!

213
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,871
All right, you know the rules.

214
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,917
Hands only, no drinking water.

215
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,872
I want a good, clean eat.
Ready? Ready?

216
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,419
- Come on, eat it.
- Come, come, come on.

217
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,089
I'm looking for Lee Thompkins.

218
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,595
The Doc.

219
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,476
Lee.

220
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,523
The winner!

221
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,197
Jim, you don't look like
a guy who got shot four times.

222
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,366
Because you were able to keep me alive.

223
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,364
Thanks.

224
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,994
I'd just shot Sofia Falcone in the head.

225
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,201
I was in a good mood.

226
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,041
I'm looking for Ed Nygma.

227
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,250
Five banks were robbed last night.

228
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,209
It has all the hallmarks
of a Nygma special.

229
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,507
I haven't seen Ed in weeks.

230
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,758
I know you feel loyalty towards him,

231
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,303
but you of all people should know
he's sick. He's a psychopath.

232
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,638
We all have our flaws.

233
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:43,849
Lee.

234
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,943
I can understand why you're here,

235
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,855
but there are other ways
of finding absolution.

236
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,653
You can't take ownership
of everyone's problems.

237
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,034
This is The Narrows.

238
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,237
Nobody owns anything down here
but the slumlords.

239
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,164
Why don't you try
going after the real criminals?

240
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,332
The people making money
off the backs of the poor.

241
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,544
You mean like Gotham Savings and Loan?

242
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,669
None of the guards were killed.

243
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,048
The more I think about it,
doesn't exactly feel like Ed Nygma.

244
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,092
- Or not just him.
- If we're done here...

245
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:20,518
Whatever's happened,

246
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,809
you can always call me. I can help.

247
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,310
You really don't get it, do you, Jim?

248
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,863
It's good to see you.

249
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,709
Ra's just tried to kill me
because of you.

250
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,502
You could have just given him
The Demon's Paw.

251
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:47,670
"Head"!

252
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,169
It's "The Demon's Head" and it is mine!

253
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:51,879
You betrayed me.

254
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,093
I was trying to save you from yourself.

255
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,681
Also, the other day, you actually
told your thugs to kill me.

256
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,467
It was a spanking.

257
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,803
- If I wanted you dead, I would've...
- Oh, shut up, both of you!

258
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,931
We're wasting time,
Ra's could be on his way right now.

259
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,015
Which wouldn't be a problem

260
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,270
if Barbara would
just give him what he wants.

261
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,351
Never gonna happen.

262
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,652
Okay, so what are we gonna do, Barbara?

263
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,695
We're just gonna walk around
with targets on our backs?

264
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,990
No, we're gonna kill the son of a bitch.

265
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,154
The kid did it before, right?

266
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,361
Yeah, but that was different.
We had, like, a special knife.

267
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,538
Yeah, that one you got from auction.
Where is it?

268
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,081
We gave it back
to the Nanda Parbat embassy.

269
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,538
Great, so we'll just do
a little smash-and-grab

270
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:26,709
and then I'll fillet the zombie.

271
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,040
I have to be the one holding the knife.

272
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,634
It's part of the ritual, like the blood.

273
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,757
I have to kill him again.

274
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,598
Even if that's the case, Master Bruce,

275
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:41,675
I can't allow you to do it. Not again.

276
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,385
We might not get another chance, Alfred.

277
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:45,808
This is the only way.

278
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,686
Says you, the mystical knife expert.

279
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:52,273
I've got The Demon's Head.
I bet if I'm holding it in my hand...

280
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,030
What if killing Ra's unlocks my powers?

281
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,409
Yeah, and what if you fail
and Ra's gets the knife back?

282
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,736
We'll worry about who kills him later.

283
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,241
Right now, we have to get
the knife before Ra's does.

284
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,535
Embassies are heavily guarded.
And we can't wait till night.

285
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,876
We're gonna need guns,
smoke grenades to cause a diversion.

286
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,954
If I may, there may be another option.

287
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,415
But you got to guarantee
not to stab us in the back.

288
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,001
Again.

289
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,633
So, in short, we'd like to thank you
very much.

290
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,810
Both of us would like to
thank you for taking such good...

291
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:26,679
Such good care of her.

292
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,731
But now we'd like to
take the knife home. Please.

293
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,149
It was never yours
to begin with, Mr. Pennyworth.

294
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,522
It belongs to my people.

295
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,072
When Mr. Bruce Wayne
purchased it at auction,

296
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,408
he was rescuing a looted
historical treasure.

297
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,041
That's why you returned it to us.

298
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,620
Yeah. But it was a loan,
wasn't it, mate?

299
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,001
It was never meant as a keepsie.

300
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,294
This knife is worth millions
and you just gave it away?

301
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,634
- You idiot!
- Easy, muffin.

302
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,636
Look, you look like you've got
a stable head on your shoulders.

303
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,230
Why don't I make a little donation,

304
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,352
and you give us the knife,

305
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,859
and we walk away?

306
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,070
Does Bruce Wayne even know about this?

307
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:22,659
Whatever your agenda is,

308
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,204
I believe that you and your chippie
should leave.

309
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,284
A chippie? Did you just call
my missus a chippie?

310
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,792
What is that...

311
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,331
What... A "chippie,"
is that a new term or something...

312
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,003
Something...

313
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,135
What? What's happening?

314
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,679
I can't breathe.

315
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,472
Oh, my God. I think
he's having a heart attack.

316
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,924
- I can't breathe.
- He's having a heart attack.

317
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,095
- Look what you did.
- Tell the security

318
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,304
it's a false alarm.

319
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,855
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

320
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,728
Give me your jacket.
Put your jacket under his head.

321
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,059
Put your jacket.

322
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,278
It really hurts. It really...
It really hurts.

323
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,743
All right,
you're gonna be just fine.

324
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,116
It really hurts.

325
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,364
Stay with me.

326
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,949
Ooh, I feel much better now.

327
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,044
Sorry about the fuss, fellas.

328
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,212
"Chippie!"

329
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,803
Oh!

330
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,692
<i>She's using you.</i>

331
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,733
<i>Shame on you,
stringing along this troubled man.</i>

332
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,359
This troubled man.

333
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,283
Oh, can't argue with that.

334
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,281
Oh, no!

335
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,988
Sorry. Just because you're in charge,
doesn't mean I disappear.

336
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,701
That's because you're too stupid
to know when you've lost.

337
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,705
Have I? "Lee, what am I to you?"

338
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,044
Does that sound like you to you?

339
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,797
Because to me, that sounds like me.

340
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,382
I'm not proud of that phrasing.

341
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,298
I'm inside you, buddy. Like a virus,

342
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,512
infecting your thoughts.

343
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,969
Oh, please.

344
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,308
You couldn't even begin
to comprehend my thoughts,

345
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,980
much less influence them.

346
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,436
What about your feelings?

347
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,812
How else would you explain

348
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,687
those desperate attempts
to gain her approval?

349
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,240
No. No, if anything, she's the one who...

350
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,409
You gave money away to the poor.

351
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,200
- That was part of a larger plan.
- Yeah.

352
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,824
Her plan. What did you ever care
about The Narrows?

353
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:34,954
I don't.

354
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,875
Every person here could drown
in a stew of their own filth,

355
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,956
and I wouldn't lose a wink of sleep.

356
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,166
Oh, I know.

357
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,420
Because all you care about is her.

358
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,548
Just like I did.
So keep that up, buddy.

359
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:54,103
'Cause soon, there will be no telling
where you end and I begin.

360
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,351
That's not gonna happen.

361
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:11,282
Well done. Now, knife, please.

362
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,497
Selina, it has to be me.

363
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,793
Selina, give me the knife.

364
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,375
And you better scram
while you still can.

365
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:22,835
I'm taking the knife!

366
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,800
Oh, you do not want to
make me angry, kid.

367
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,752
Sorry, "muffin",
I'm gonna need you to step back.

368
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,885
Don't you even go there, love.
Selina, don't give her the knife.

369
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,507
Screw this.

370
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,806
Your arrogance is gonna get
someone killed, you know.

371
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,895
- Or just you.
- Stop!

372
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:46,896
Thank you.

373
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,200
Now... Get in!

374
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,828
Selina, let's go.

375
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,463
Nice doing business with you, boys.

376
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,100
You were right.

377
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:22,725
She's using me.

378
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:24,855
Finally.

379
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,062
So much for you being smart, now.

380
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,443
Yeah. The most brilliant minds

381
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,525
are often blind
to the most obvious truths.

382
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,113
Finally.

383
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:37,452
- And you came to me...
- Because that lovestruck moron, Ed,

384
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,574
is floating down a river of dopamine,

385
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,081
deep within the primitive
reward circuit of my brain,

386
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,083
and I need you to help me drown him.

387
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:45,622
For good.

388
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,383
Did you bring the half-share
of profits we asked for?

389
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:49,667
That money is gone.

390
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,428
Distributed among
the riffraff of The Narrows. But...

391
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:58,518
Those five banks were merely
the first stage

392
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,762
of a very sophisticated plan.

393
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,475
And the coup de grâce is tonight.

394
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,356
I knew you were scheming something.

395
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,485
That's why we were
gonna rob you afterward.

396
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,367
But I prefer this way.

397
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,571
There better be enough in there
to get me fixed.

398
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,581
- Don't forget our deal.
- I won't.

399
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:23,084
Thank you so much.
And how big is the score?

400
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,953
About $100 million.

401
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,414
Apiece.

402
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,135
And you help me
deal with Lee Thompkins.

403
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,690
Thank you for coming back.

404
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,101
We serve The Demon's Head, Barbara.

405
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,478
So, what's the play?

406
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,490
Simple. I do the flashlight
hand thingy, summon Ra's,

407
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,698
little stabby-stab with the knife,
send him back to hell.

408
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,570
Think I can remember that.

409
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:01,910
<i>You can't be serious.</i>

410
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,666
That's your plan?

411
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,585
How do you expect to get the drop

412
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,505
on someone who's studied
kung fu for 2,000 years,

413
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:09,706
and is a zombie?

414
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,008
Not feeling a whole lot
of faith here, kitty-cat.

415
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,586
Maybe I'd have a little more if you
knew how to use your demon head

416
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,296
for something
other than a flashlight.

417
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,723
You're gonna get us killed.

418
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,050
You got any useful suggestions?

419
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,010
- Maybe call backup.
- I did.

420
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:24,888
- Here they are.
- What if Bruce is right?

421
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,607
Let him use the knife. At least
we know that it worked before.

422
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,851
You just took the knife from him.

423
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,402
Because you told me to pick a side.

424
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,400
I thought you had some other plan
other than

425
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,028
"Let's stab the immortal undead guy
and hope for the best."

426
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,993
Listen, Selina, we're strongest
when we're together.

427
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,238
Now, are you in or are you out?

428
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,163
If it's suicide by Ra's, I'm out.

429
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,491
Fine, then go.

430
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:55,385
What if she's right?

431
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,717
I can't control The Demon's Head.

432
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,599
Maybe it's like Ra's said. Maybe...

433
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,431
I am just a nightclub owner.

434
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,642
I should have never
trusted those men.

435
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,772
I didn't want you to have
The Demon's Head.

436
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,065
Not even sure I want it now.

437
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,900
Three years we've been together,
on and off.

438
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,616
And I've never seen you
doubt yourself.

439
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,790
So, however you
wanna play this, I'm in.

440
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,042
But if you're saying
you're not worthy,

441
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,790
that's where I jump ship.

442
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,379
Let's do this.

443
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,404
I suppose on the bright side,
you won't have to kill him.

444
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,691
Again.

445
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:03,077
- Except, I'm the only one who can.
- Well, so said Ra's.

446
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,240
I mean, no disrespect to your
magical daggers and all of that,

447
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,324
but I'd love to see what would happen

448
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,829
if I pulled his head off
his bloody shoulders.

449
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,496
I can't believe
Selina gave Barbara the knife.

450
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,551
Yeah, well, at least
we know where she stands.

451
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:19,961
That's what you think.

452
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,513
Oh, you got a bloody cheek
turning up here.

453
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,144
I gave Barbara the knife
because if there was a chance

454
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,566
she could use it, I wanted her to.

455
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,768
That way,
Bruce didn't have to kill him.

456
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,187
I would've done what I had to do.

457
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,612
And you would've gone straight back

458
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,486
to being the douchebag
you've been the last few months.

459
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,408
So, no, thank you.

460
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,076
She's got a point there,
Master Bruce.

461
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,155
Thanks for the explanation.
You can leave now.

462
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,364
- Bruce...
- You sided with them.

463
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,994
Why does it have
to be about sides?

464
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,079
There is somebody,

465
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,256
something out there
that needs to be stopped.

466
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,503
So why can't we focus on that?

467
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,964
Another good point.

468
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,880
Barbara and Tabitha
are gonna get themselves killed.

469
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,716
And I don't want that to happen.

470
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,558
There were easier banks to hit.

471
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,691
- Why yours?
- I keep telling you.

472
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,489
I have no idea.

473
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,741
I'm the victim.
You're treating me like a criminal.

474
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,660
Yeah, I wonder
where we'd get that from.

475
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,872
- Excuse me?
- We did some digging,

476
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:33,247
and your bank has been
investigated for redlining,

477
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,124
usury, illegal foreclosures.

478
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,671
And cleared on all counts.

479
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:38,623
You have good lawyers.

480
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,795
So we deserve to be robbed?

481
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:43,961
I'm done here.

482
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,844
Ma'am, can you just
give us a second, please?

483
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,557
- What the hell are you doing?
- She's a crook.

484
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:56,983
A bigger crook
than whoever ripped her off.

485
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,059
You mean like Lee?

486
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,894
Look, brother,
I know what this is about.

487
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,901
You went down to The Narrows
and came back all fired up, okay?

488
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,278
But alienating her
is not gonna help us.

489
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,405
If Lee's involved with Nygma,

490
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,579
we got to stop it before it goes bad.

491
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,828
Which of your branches
are the most vulnerable?

492
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,084
As of this afternoon, none of them.

493
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,170
We have a security protocol.

494
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,676
After the Arkham breakout
and the robberies...

495
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,594
You moved your assets
to a secure location.

496
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:26,717
Yes, of course.

497
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:29,140
All 45 branches, this morning.

498
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:34,221
It's totally safe.
Fortified and heavily guarded.

499
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,471
Where is it?

500
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,699
- Pistol would've been more fun.
- You indulge me.

501
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,986
Breaking open the vault
is the last detail.

502
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,949
Big detail. How did you solve it?

503
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,580
A little help from some friends.

504
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,418
I'm the revealer of masks.

505
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,249
When I appear,

506
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,085
friend becomes foe,

507
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,628
and the one that you love,

508
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,178
becomes the one that you hate.
What am I?

509
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,046
Betrayal.

510
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:11,595
Hello, Lee.

511
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,387
Yeah, it's not a dart gun. Let's go.

512
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,803
- Nice entrance.
- I do hope you've reconsidered,

513
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:59,097
and are planning to give me
what I want.

514
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,690
I've thought about it. A lot.

515
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,480
And about us.

516
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,187
We had something, didn't we?

517
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,615
Back when you were less dug up-y.

518
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,235
I do not have time for this.

519
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:13,786
I will give you what you want, Ra's.

520
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,866
But I want you to admit
we had a connection.

521
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,334
And that those things you said to me

522
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,707
were just mind games
to make me lose my nerve.

523
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,791
You want me to tell you
that you're special?

524
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,713
Would that be so hard?

525
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,920
No.

526
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,426
And moreover,

527
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:37,143
it's true. You are special.

528
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,056
I'm just sorry
it had to come to this, Barbara.

529
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:45,101
Me, too.

530
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,728
But thank you for saying that.

531
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,286
Ouch.

532
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,791
She must do this by herself.

533
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,260
Barbara, fight.

534
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:29,066
But this is Barbara's fight.

535
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,677
But this is Barbara's fight.

536
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,855
Well, now. Look at you.

537
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:05,931
Yeah. Look at me.

538
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,476
You wanna give it another shot?

539
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,077
She's mastered The Demon's Head.

540
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:19,536
Wow!

541
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,535
I can see why he likes this thing.

542
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,204
That's enough.

543
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,584
Give me what I want
or your friend dies.

544
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,003
I thought this was between us.

545
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,084
Choose now.

546
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,258
Tabby, I...

547
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,761
I can't give this up.

548
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:57,574
No!

549
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,577
That's enough.

550
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,706
Choose now.

551
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,208
You win.

552
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,003
Just don't hurt her.

553
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,600
Barbara Kean,

554
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,149
you surprise me yet again.

555
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:34,065
Maybe I wasn't mistaken
in you after all.

556
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:18,272
Give me the knife, Ra's.

557
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:20,737
Let me kill you.

558
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,078
Today is not the day that I die.

559
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,645
This is the price for
taking advantage of me, Lee.

560
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,814
You're wrong, Ed. I wasn't using you.

561
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,520
Again, don't call me "Ed."

562
00:35:58,365 --> 00:35:59,606
And I'm not wrong about you.

563
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,279
Truck is almost full. We should go.

564
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,406
Tell the ogre,
have him leave the property deeds.

565
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,533
They all belong to The Narrows.
Worthless.

566
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,952
And so ends the tale
of the Queen of The Narrows.

567
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:13,369
Hmm?

568
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,122
Goodbye, Lee.

569
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:20,626
What are you doing?

570
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,927
How did that go again?

571
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:27,263
"And the revealer of masks,
when I appear, friend becomes foe."

572
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,685
- Betrayal.
- Exactly.

573
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:39,812
What the hell are you doing?

574
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,192
Just burning
The Narrows' property deeds.

575
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,443
Not that.

576
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,992
He's proving his love
by betraying us.

577
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,657
These bars can't hold me.
When I get out...

578
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,737
We'll be gone.

579
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,035
I just wanted you to hear something.

580
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,827
Oswald, we've been
through thick and thin.

581
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,838
And I hold no grudge on you.

582
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,338
But you come against Lee,

583
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,252
and you come against me.

584
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,298
I'm gonna dismember you, you twerp!

585
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,970
Yep, not even gonna try with you.

586
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,385
Let's go, Lee.

587
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,020
It won't make any difference.

588
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,439
She's still using you.

589
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:19,231
You are not the Riddler,
you are a fool!

590
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:20,778
God...

591
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,608
Why do that?

592
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,787
Why bring Penguin and Grundy if
you're just gonna lock them inside?

593
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,364
I needed Grundy to open the vault.

594
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,123
And Oswald was gonna rob us anyway,

595
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,450
so, just kept an eye on him.

596
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,327
He'll get over it, or he won't.

597
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,912
So you don't think I'm using you?

598
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:40,836
No, I know you are.

599
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,459
Then why would you
betray your friends for me?

600
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:45,961
Is this...

601
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,547
- Are you Ed?
- No, I'm me.

602
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,306
- How can you be sure?
- Because Ed didn't understand you.

603
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,564
He didn't see how deeply
you had changed. I do.

604
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,975
I know that that virus

605
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,898
woke up something deep inside you.

606
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,652
And you let that something loose
when you shot Sofia.

607
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,572
And you love it.

608
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:11,571
And I love it, too.

609
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,955
And I know that
you don't feel same way about me.

610
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:18,793
But you will.

611
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,921
And when you do, I will be here.

612
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,011
Ed Nygma,

613
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,172
you are a riddle.

614
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,099
That's the nicest thing
someone's said to me.

615
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,980
- That's Jim.
- This alarm just went off.

616
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,398
He was on to us.

617
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,608
- We can just go out the back.
- No, they'll see the truck.

618
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,148
One of us needs to distract them.

619
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,235
Done.

620
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:48,899
No!

621
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,402
I can handle Jim Gordon.

622
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,574
You take the money to The Narrows.

623
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:58,038
- You trust me?
- I do.

624
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:03,497
Go.

625
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,019
<i>GCPD.
Nygma, we know you're in there.</i>

626
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,391
<i>Come out with your hands up.</i>

627
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,980
Sweet merciful mother.

628
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,282
You know your rights.

629
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:31,923
You'd have done the same for me.

630
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,852
Ladies, I hope
this isn't one of those

631
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,064
"kill the old queen" situations.

632
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,860
We discussed things.

633
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:55,784
Demon's Head or not, you fought.

634
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,574
Not for yourself,
but those alongside you.

635
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,708
You are worthy, Barbara Kean.

636
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,208
We follow you
to our deaths and beyond.

637
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,846
We can find from Barbara where
the League hides temples, safe houses.

638
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,147
He'll be in one of them.

639
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,724
Meanwhile,
we'll try to fix the knife.

640
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,901
Yeah, we'll just take it to
the magic knife shop, no problem.

641
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,733
- Selina, be serious.
- I am.

642
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,156
If Ra's wanted you dead,
you would be.

643
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:35,900
He obviously likes you.

644
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,569
- It's not about me.
- I know it's not about you.

645
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:43,119
Gotham has managed
a long time without you.

646
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:47,829
It can manage a little longer,
if you have one night off.

647
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,927
You did good today.

648
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,174
So did you.

649
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:02,426
Ahem.

650
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,971
Poor timing. Apologies.

651
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:09,483
I only want to talk. Alone, please.

652
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:11,435
I'm staying.

653
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:14,609
Very well.

654
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,740
She's right, you know, Bruce.

655
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:18,985
I do like you.

656
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,907
Respect you.
Respect you for what you'll become.

657
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:27,118
You have no idea what I'll become.

658
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,577
Of course, I do.

659
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,588
At least, who you could become.

660
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,502
- Why are you here?
- I felt I owed you an explanation

661
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,967
as to why I chose to live.

662
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:41,382
When I took back The Demon's Head,

663
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:44,594
I saw a vision

664
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,682
of a cataclysmic event
soon to befall this city.

665
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,350
What event?

666
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:57,065
A cleansing fire that will destroy,

667
00:42:57,867 --> 00:42:59,199
purify,

668
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:01,993
create. Create you, Bruce.

669
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:05,949
Because I will use it as a mighty forge,

670
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:10,249
molding you into
a dark knight of Gotham.

671
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,754
If it doesn't kill you, that is.
