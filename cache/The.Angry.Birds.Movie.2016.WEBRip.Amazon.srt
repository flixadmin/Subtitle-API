 me with goodbye? 

2270
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:25,934
 * Did you think I'd crumble? 

2271
01:28:25,968 --> 01:28:27,536
 * Did you think 
 I'd lay down and die? 

2272
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:29,004
 * Oh, no, not I 

2273
01:28:29,037 --> 01:28:30,172
 Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

2274
01:28:30,205 --> 01:28:31,106
 * I will survive 

2275
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:32,675
Whoo! (LAUGHING)

2276
01:28:32,708 --> 01:28:34,343
 * As long as I 
 know how to love 
 I know I'll stay alive 

2277
01:28:34,377 --> 01:28:35,911
 TERENCE: Mmm.

2278
01:28:35,944 --> 01:28:36,912
 * I've got all 
 my life to live 

2279
01:28:36,945 --> 01:28:38,146
 (WHOOPING)

2280
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:39,715
 * And I've got 
 all my love to give 

2281
01:28:39,748 --> 01:28:41,984
 * I will survive 
 I will survive 

2282
01:28:42,017 --> 01:28:44,119
 Whoa. Whoa. (GRUNTS)

2283
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:45,788
 * Go on, now, go 
 Walk out the door 

2284
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:47,155
(LAUGHS)

2285
01:28:47,189 --> 01:28:49,992
 * Just turn around now 

2286
01:28:50,025 --> 01:28:52,160
 * 'Cause you're 
 not welcome anymore 

2287
01:28:52,194 --> 01:28:53,896
 (EXCLAIMING)

2288
01:28:53,929 --> 01:28:55,498
 * Weren't you the one 
 Who tried to hurt 
 me with goodbye? 

2289
01:28:55,531 --> 01:28:57,132
 * Did you think I'd crumble? 

2290
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:59,334
 * Did you think 
 I'd lay down and die? 

2291
01:28:59,368 --> 01:29:01,069
 * Oh, no, not I 

2292
01:29:01,103 --> 01:29:03,305
 * I will survive 

2293
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:04,573
 (LAUGHTER)
 (WHOOPING)

2294
01:29:05,574 --> 01:29:07,309
 ROSS: Come on, Leonard.

2295
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:08,777
 Leonard can't dance.

2296
01:29:08,811 --> 01:29:11,547
 He's hatching a new plan.

2297
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:12,915
 (DEVIOUS LAUGHTER)
 Yeah!

2298
01:29:12,948 --> 01:29:14,617
 * I will survive 

2299
01:29:14,650 --> 01:29:16,552
 * Yeah, yeah 

2300
01:29:18,921 --> 01:29:20,255
 Okay, maybe I'll
 dance for just a sec.

2301
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:22,658
 (LAUGHING)

2302
01:29:23,358 --> 01:29:24,560
 (WHOOPING)

2303
01:29:26,028 --> 01:29:27,996
 Whoo! Show 'em
 what you got, Red.

2304
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:29,765
 Ba-boom! Come on,
 Red Stuff.

2305
01:29:29,798 --> 01:29:30,966
 No.
 Yeah, yeah.

2306
01:29:30,999 --> 01:29:32,200
 Nice try.

2307
01:29:32,234 --> 01:29:33,502

(GASPS)

2308
01:29:33,536 --> 01:29:34,570
 Hmm?

2309
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:36,104
 Uh...

2310
01:29:36,138 --> 01:29:38,807
Oh! Okay.

2311
01:29:38,841 --> 01:29:39,675
Mmm-hmm.

2312
01:29:42,077 --> 01:29:43,546
(SONG CONTINUES)

2313
01:29:43,579 --> 01:29:47,483
 * Ooh! Whoa! 

2314
01:29:47,516 --> 01:29:50,118
 * I will survive 

2315
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:54,457
 * I will survive 

2316
01:29:55,458 --> 01:29:56,859
 * Ooh! 

2317
01:29:59,161 --> 01:30:01,864
 * I will survive 

2318
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:04,900
 * Yeah  

2319
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:09,237
 OLIVE: There you go.

2320
01:30:09,271 --> 01:30:10,639
 (FEET SCREECH)

2321
01:30:12,274 --> 01:30:13,408

2322
01:30:14,176 --> 01:30:15,811
 (GRUNTING)

2323
01:30:15,844 --> 01:30:17,680
 Ooh!
Wait. What are we doing?

2324
01:30:17,713 --> 01:30:18,747
 (GRUNTING)

2325
01:30:19,582 --> 01:30:21,049
 (ALL GASP)

2326
01:30:22,284 --> 01:30:23,686
 Watch out.

2327
01:30:23,719 --> 01:30:24,920
 (PANTING)

2328
01:30:28,591 --> 01:30:29,592
(THUMP)
 Ow!

2329
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:32,495
 ALL: Whoa!

2330
01:30:33,729 --> 01:30:34,997
 (CREAKING)

2331
01:30:43,706 --> 01:30:44,907
 ALL: Mmm!

2332
01:30:50,979 --> 01:30:51,914
 *

2333
01:30:59,488 --> 01:31:00,623
 * Whoo! 

2334
01:31:08,363 --> 01:31:11,634
 * There's 
 a moment in this journey 
 that I gave up 

2335
01:31:13,335 --> 01:31:15,671
 * My boots just 
 couldn't walk another mile 

2336
01:31:17,072 --> 01:31:20,475
 * And that cloud above 
 me had no silver lining 

2337
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:24,580
 * I couldn't buy 
 a break with my last dime 

2338
01:31:26,048 --> 01:31:30,519
 * Oh, but when I saw you 
 standing in the corner 

2339
01:31:30,553 --> 01:31:34,957
 * I'd have never thought 
 that you would have my back 

2340
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:38,060
 * But then we rolled in 
 like the thunder 
 and the lightning 

2341
01:31:39,862 --> 01:31:41,964
 * Threw some punches, 
 then we had a laugh 

2342
01:31:43,632 --> 01:31:46,902
 * Just some 
 roughed-up desperados 

2343
01:31:48,036 --> 01:31:52,207
 * Hanging tough 
 through thick and thin 

2344
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:55,611
 * Kicking up 
 dust wherever we go 

2345
01:31:57,079 --> 01:32:00,749
 * I can see that you and me 
 are gonna be friends 

2346
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:11,059
 * Who'd have thought 
 we'd wind up here together? 

2347
01:32:12,661 --> 01:32:15,598
 * It's crazy that 
 we're standing side by side 

2348
01:32:17,232 --> 01:32:19,968
 * Fighting just like 
 two birds of a feather 

2349
01:32:21,403 --> 01:32:24,306
 * Who's gonna tell us 
 now that we can't fly? 

2350
01:32:25,641 --> 01:32:28,744
 * Just some 
 roughed-up desperados 

2351
01:32:30,012 --> 01:32:34,116
 * Hanging tough 
 through thick and thin 

2352
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:38,921
 * Kicking up 
 dust wherever we go 

2353
01:32:38,954 --> 01:32:42,925
 * I can see that you and me 
 are gonna be friends 

2354
01:32:42,958 --> 01:32:46,328
 * To the end, you and 
 me are gonna be friends 

2355
01:32:46,929 --> 01:32:47,963
 * Yeah! 

2356
01:32:53,301 --> 01:32:55,003
 * Here we go! 

2357
01:32:55,037 --> 01:32:59,107
 * Hey, hey, you and me 
 Different as different can be 

2358
01:32:59,141 --> 01:33:01,376
 * You like to rock, 
 I like to roll 

2359
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:03,345
 * You take the high 
 and I'll take the low 

2360
01:33:03,378 --> 01:33:06,815
 * Whoa, whoa-oh! 

2361
01:33:07,716 --> 01:33:11,854
 * Whoa, whoa-oh! 

2362
01:33:11,887 --> 01:33:14,957
 * Just some 
 roughed-up desperados 

2363
01:33:16,258 --> 01:33:20,362
 * Hanging tough 
 through thick and thin 

2364
01:33:20,395 --> 01:33:25,133
 * Kicking up 
 dust wherever we go 

2365
01:33:25,167 --> 01:33:29,237
 * I can see that you and me 
 are gonna be friends 

2366
01:33:29,271 --> 01:33:33,976
 * To the end, you and 
 me are gonna be friends 

2367
01:33:34,009 --> 01:33:37,612
 * I can see that you and me 
 are gonna be friends 

2368
01:33:37,646 --> 01:33:38,280
 * Yeah!
