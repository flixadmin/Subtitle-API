1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,820
Ingrid.. I miss you.
-You look like a slut.

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:10,660
How are Ingrid and Sara doing?
-Why are you interrogating me like that?

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,780
Stop walking around like a fucking cliche.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,900
I trust you 100%.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,080
Chris hooked up with someone at the Halloween party,
and his girl found out. She went psycho!

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,380
[ANSWER!]

7
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,940
Have you talked to him?

8
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,160
Yes.

9
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,940
What did he say?

10
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,180
Isak!

11
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,820
Let's sit down.

12
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,300
He's not very happy.

13
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,060
He has to talk to me.
He has to let me explain.

14
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,880
Maybe he just needs a little space.

15
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,540
How did he find out about it?

16
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,960
The entire school is talking about it.

17
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,500
Yeah, but how did he find out?

18
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,980
Elias..

19
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,840
So then he just believed it?
-It's true.

20
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,280
I don't understand how he can
believe a rumor without talking to me first?

21
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,180
He said he should've
know about it already.

22
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,400
You've been acting
a little random lately.

23
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,720
Perhaps it just made sense.

24
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,840
[Don't think we should talk now.]

25
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,080
Is it Jonas?

26
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,400
[You have to let me explain.]

27
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:40,480
[If I see you now I'm going to say things I'll regret, so I suggest I'll call you
when I'm ready to hear your explanation on why you chose to fuck up everything 
that was good between us.]

28
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,400
It'll be okay.

29
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,880
It'll be okay.

30
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,260
How are you doing?

31
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,800
I'm fine.

32
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,140
I think if I were in your situation,
I would have been really upset.

33
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,480
I've been overhearing some conversations and
Ulla from 2STE said it was Chris' girlfriend who told everyone.

34
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,860
Has Chris said something himself?

35
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,180
There's a lot of people
who are saying you're slutty.

36
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:35,840
Vilde!

37
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,540
I'm just telling the truth.

38
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,720
There's a rumor going around
that girls have black listed you.

39
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,520
What does that mean?

40
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,740
I'm not really sure. But Tiril from 2STB 
was blacklisted last year. They cut off her hair.

41
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,660
Hello?!

42
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,380
I'm just telling you what I've heard!

43
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,660
Good job, Eva!

44
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,660
Excuse me?!

45
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,820
Excuse you for what?

46
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,760
You seems like really charming girls.

47
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,400
Oh, so sweet!
Defending your friend.

48
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,340
It seems like you're very close.

49
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,560
I'm sure you'd like to continue that.
Until she pisses on your entire life.

50
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,100
Then I don't think you're
so damn charming anymore.

51
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,640
What did she mean by that?

52
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,280
Were you and Ingrid friends?

53
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,820
A long time ago.

54
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,580
What did she mean by
"pissing over your entire life"?

55
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,680
I don't know.
-There must have been something?

56
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,680
I'm sure she said it
to create drama, okay?

57
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,420
Okay.

58
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,780
[But how long do you think it will
take until he wants to talk to me?]

59
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,560
[I don't know, Eva.]

60
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,520
[But it seems like he's still
just as mad at me. What does he say?]

61
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:13,900
[He hasn't talked about you.]

62
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,540
What are you doing here?
-What do you think?

63
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,740
I got a call from school
because you were in a fight!

64
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,200
That's why I came home.
-You could've spared it.

65
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,780
No. I couldn't. Because I come home and you haven't 
received a passing grade in math for your Christmas grade.

66
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,960
Christmas grades don't count.

67
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,200
What happened?
-Nothing happened. There were some girls who attacked me.

68
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,580
Just like that? Unprovoked? 
-Yes.

69
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,920
What kind of girls were they?
-No one! Some bitches from the second year.

70
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,480
Eva!
-Mom!

71
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,720
I can't handle this conversation.
-You have to! We have to talk about-

72
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,900
No! I actually don't have to.

73
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:03,660
You can't be gone all year, and then suddenly 
start meddling in my life. It doesn't work like that.

74
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,900
I just want to help!
-If you want to help me..

75
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:14,700
.. then stop yelling at me! The entire school hates me, and Jonas
wants to break up. So the last thing I want is for you to come home and bitch at me!

76
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,560
Jonas?

77
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,660
Are you dating Jonas?
Jonas-Jonas?

78
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,060
But Jonas is..
-Mom! I know who Jonas is.

79
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,220
You don't need to tell me.

80
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,440
Don't you think Vilde is really..

81
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,400
.. far removed from Earth? She's floating
on a pink cloud with all this Russ stuff.

82
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,300
Russ time is her life, 
and there are three more years.

83
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,840
I just don't understand
what the big deal is.

84
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,820
But, it's kind of nice though.

85
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,760
He still hasn't called?

86
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,920
You know you don't have
to wait until he is ready to talk, right?

87
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,980
You have the right to explain yourself.

88
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,560
You know what always
gets me in a better mood?

89
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,180
Okay, promise you
won't hold it against me?

90
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,240
Yeah.

91
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,940
Seriously, you can't tell anyone.

92
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,300
It's between us.

93
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,120
If this song doesn't 
give you a better mood, then..

94
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,620
Justin Bieber? Cool..

95
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,480
It's not something I
listen to, but eh..

96
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,160
It was because eh.. 
Whatever.

97
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,500
I don't need to explain
myself to you, anyway.

98
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,140
Is there something? Something you want?

99
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,600
Will you come home
with me to do homework?

100
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,880
Excuse me, Willhelm.
-William.

101
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,700
That pretty much answers
the question, don't you think?

102
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,740
What?

103
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,960
I don't even know your name.

104
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,160
Call me what you want.

105
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,920
Yeah but then.. Then 
I choose to call you asshole.

106
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,860
You think it was funny?
-Are you coming?

107
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,580
I thought I answered 
quite clearly, but..

108
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,760
No.

109
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,340
Let me know when you change your mind.

110
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,760
Go home and wait for it.

111
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,080
Who does he think he is?!

112
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,380
Why did you call him Willhelm?

113
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,960
Huh?

114
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,160
You called him Willhelm, 
but you know he's called William.

115
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,300
Oh yeah, that
was a suppression technique.

116
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,640
Okay?

117
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,040
I saw it on Suits once.

118
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,960
I've always wanted to use it.

119
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,540
Wow.

120
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,860
Impressed?

121
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,580
Mostly surprised.

122
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,700
That you both watch Suits,
and listen to Justin Bieber.

123
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,600
Was that a little joke?

124
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,700
You made a joke Eva!

125
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,560
That's a good sign!
That's good.

126
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,600
That's what we like.

127
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:51,020
[I'm calling in an extraordinary Russ bus meeting 
tomorrow at 15.00h. Important that everyone comes.]

128
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,020
Extraordinary bus meeting?

129
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,380
It's funny that she's calling it extraordinary, 
since we have so many ordinary bus meetings.

130
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,560
Is the toilet paper in the box?

131
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,280
And the money?
Has Vilde received the money?

132
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:24,520
Will this meeting take
a long time? I have something else.

133
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:30,580
As everyone knows, Eva had
an unlucky incident at the Halloween party.

134
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,500
Quite a lot of people are
upset with her. Busses have blacklisted her.

135
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,280
Vilde..

136
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,260
I got an upleasant phone
call from the girls yesterday.

137
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,780
They're saying that as long as
Eva is on our bus, we are all blacklisted.

138
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,200
Huh?!

139
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:55,840
You can just laugh, but it's actually really serious. Last year
someone broke the brakes on a blacklisted bus. Everyone could have died.

140
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,700
We don't even have a bus.

141
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,320
No, but they can do other things.
Cutting our hair, or..

142
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,760
Throw us in the water. I know
of several girls that went too far.

143
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,980
They can try.

144
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:14,540
We have to talk about this. It's unfair
that we'll all become unpopular because of Eva being slutty.

145
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:20,440
It's interesting that you who describe 
yourself as a feminist, is calling others slutty.

146
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:31,680
That's not true. I think Penetrator Chris is also slutty. It's unfair
that he doesn't get this reputation. He was at much at fault as you.

147
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,560
But that's not my fault either.

148
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,980
Chris doesn't have that reputation because
guys don't go around calling other guys sluts.

149
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,860
So if you think it's unfair,
you have to stop calling girls sluts.

150
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,300
Don't yell at me! I'm not even done talking.

151
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,220
That's not the only reason Chris
said Eva is slutty. There's more.

152
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,560
This isn't the first time
Eva has ruined a relationship.

153
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,500
Vilde..

154
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,120
That's between me and Ingrid.

155
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,800
It's actually not that simple, Eva.

156
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:10,200
Because Ingrid has told Iben and other girls.
What you have done, affects all of us as girls.

157
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,520
What is it we are talking about?

158
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,940
Eva tried to be best
friends with Ingrid from Pepsi Max.

159
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,960
In the 9th grade,
Ingrid got a boyfriend.

160
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,280
She was really in love with him,
and they were the sweetest couple in the entire school.

161
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:30,300
Everyone tought they were perfect
for each other. Their parents thought they should get married.

162
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,380
But right before summer,
in the 10th grade..

163
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,100
.. he started to behave strangely.
He was dismissive and didn't reply to her texts.

164
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,000
Ingrid became really sad.

165
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:48,140
Eva was there for her, comforted
here, and pretended nothing was wrong.

166
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,620
Even though she knew why he was acting so strange.

167
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,540
Because Eva was seeing
him behind Ingrid's back.

168
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,360
His name is Jonas.

169
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,460
Jonas and Ingrid used to be a couple.

170
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,980
So Eva has herself to blame
for the situation she is in now.

171
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,680
Because it's pretty messed
up to steal your best friend's boyfriend.

172
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,220
You can't steal anyone.

173
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,380
Do you want to have a friend
who hooks up with your boyfriend?

174
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,900
Rather that than a friend who
calls girls sluts based on rumors.

175
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,660
It's not a rumor, it's true.
Just ask Eva.

176
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,400
I don't understand why you're
attacking Eva. [..?]

177
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,520
They can try. We'll get them back.

178
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:42,060
That might be the way it works in your Muslim
gangster world, but for us it doesn't work like that.

179
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,440
I can't be bothered listening to this.

180
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,300
You're completely psycho.
You threw water in Ingrid's face.

181
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,780
You're crazy!

182
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:04,640
I threw water in Ingrid's face because her and
her friends called you a slut for hooking up with William.

183
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:12,080
That's how it works in my Muslim gangster world. 
You don't judge your friends, and you stand up for them no matter what.

184
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,240
For once it would have been
 really nice if you could have defended me, Chris!

185
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,820
Okay, Eva. I'm listening.

186
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:37,020
I just want you to know
I didn't hook up with Chris because I liked him.

187
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,820
I have never liked him.

188
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,160
I just did it because I 
thought you and Ingred hooked up.

189
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,920
That's your explanation?

190
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,640
Ironic.

191
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,360
I've taken a lot of crap
from you because you thought I was with Ingrid.

192
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,160
But then it's actually you
who was unfaithful. And you lied about it.

193
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,860
And I have to find out through Elias?!

194
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:23,480
It was you who lied to me first.
You said you weren't with Ingrid, but you were.

195
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,260
I hooked up with Chris because I was hurt.
It never would've happened if you hadn't lied to me first.

196
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,780
Okay.. It's my fault?

197
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,260
No! That's not what I meant.

198
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,420
I'm just trying to explain why I did it.

199
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,980
I fucked up, okay?

200
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,440
I'm sorry.

201
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,540
I wish I'd never done it. Really.

202
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,640
I'm sorry.

203
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,100
Jonas..

204
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,800
I love you.

205
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:26,060
You're saying you hooked up with 
Christoffer just because you thought I was with Ingrid.

206
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,000
Why did you have to
cheat just because you thought I was?

207
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,580
I'm sorry.

208
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,560
Eva, it's actually not
about infidelity or lies.

209
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,640
It's about me not understanding who you are.

210
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,300
When we were in middle school,
and you, Sara, and Ingrid were best friends..

211
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:02,380
.. and I was with Ingrid,
you wanted to be with me.

212
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,940
But now that you have new friends..

213
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,300
.. and they are into third year guys,
you suddenly want to be with them all the time.

214
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,900
That's what I don't understand.

215
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,260
You just follow what
everyone else thinks is exciting.

216
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
You don't have an own opinion.

217
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,120
What do you really like?

218
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,240
Who are you?

219
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,420
Call me when you've found that out.
