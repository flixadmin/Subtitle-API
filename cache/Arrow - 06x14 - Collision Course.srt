1
00:00:02,099 --> 00:00:03,498
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:03,525 --> 00:00:04,791
These are
innocent people.

3
00:00:04,793 --> 00:00:06,281
And you can save them...

4
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:08,648
By wiring $10 million into
that account every night.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,300
$70 million.

6
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:14,732
D--don't.

7
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:16,367
I'm going to make sure

8
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:18,002
Vince didn't
die for nothing.

9
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:20,705
I'm going to kill every
last one of them...

10
00:00:20,707 --> 00:00:21,940
Starting with Laurel.

11
00:00:24,845 --> 00:00:26,277
Laurel!

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,046
There is
a piece of my daughter

13
00:00:28,048 --> 00:00:29,714
in you somewhere.

14
00:00:29,716 --> 00:00:31,216
And I'm gonna get it
out whatever it takes.

15
00:00:31,218 --> 00:00:33,184
Thank you
for all you've done

16
00:00:33,186 --> 00:00:35,286
to get justice for my boy.

17
00:00:35,288 --> 00:00:37,021
The new police captain--

18
00:00:37,023 --> 00:00:38,723
she's on my payroll.

19
00:00:39,793 --> 00:00:42,227
Tell your boy
I said hello.

20
00:00:45,398 --> 00:00:48,666
"Severed subclavian artery.

21
00:00:48,668 --> 00:00:51,236
No defensive wounds."

22
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:53,338
How does this happen?

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,373
Sometime between
transfer and intake at Iron Heights,

24
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,175
an inmate caught
James unaware.

25
00:00:57,177 --> 00:00:59,310
By the time the
guards intervened, it was too late.

26
00:00:59,312 --> 00:01:00,612
Motive.

27
00:01:00,614 --> 00:01:02,580
The inmate was
a head case off his meds.

28
00:01:02,582 --> 00:01:04,282
For all we know, he thought he was
killing his mother.

29
00:01:04,284 --> 00:01:07,819
Well, the random murder
of Cayden James, it--

30
00:01:07,821 --> 00:01:10,355
it doesn't feel very random.

31
00:01:10,357 --> 00:01:13,091
It was bad timing
and even worse luck, Mr. Mayor.

32
00:01:13,093 --> 00:01:14,893
That's all.

33
00:01:14,895 --> 00:01:16,394
All right.

34
00:01:16,396 --> 00:01:18,696
But Cayden James was
my responsibility.

35
00:01:18,698 --> 00:01:21,633
If a head has to roll for this,
make it mine.

36
00:01:21,635 --> 00:01:23,868
That is not how I
run things here.

37
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,905
Just...

38
00:01:26,907 --> 00:01:29,774
Keep doing
what you're doing.

39
00:01:35,315 --> 00:01:36,915
One at
a time! One at a time!

40
00:01:39,553 --> 00:01:40,818
Thank you.

41
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,787
I understand that you're angry.

42
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:45,190
I am...I am angry, too,

43
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:46,791
but we are not
gonna solve any problems

44
00:01:46,793 --> 00:01:48,359
by yelling at one another.

45
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:50,295
Last I heard,
Cayden James is dead,

46
00:01:50,297 --> 00:01:52,030
but you still don't have
the money he stole.

47
00:01:52,032 --> 00:01:54,065
You mean the money
he was given.

48
00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:56,067
We are still in the
process of recovering

49
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:59,871
the money that was
extorted from the city.

50
00:01:59,873 --> 00:02:01,773
We just need
a little more time.

51
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,776
We're on the verge
of financial collapse.

52
00:02:04,778 --> 00:02:07,445
Without an influx
of cash soon,

53
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:11,349
we all have to shut down--
schools, sanitation,

54
00:02:11,351 --> 00:02:13,751
emergency services,
everything.

55
00:02:13,753 --> 00:02:19,257
Fine. We will have
those funds back in 48 hours.

56
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:21,459
You have my word.

57
00:02:21,461 --> 00:02:24,829
All of you have
my word.

58
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:26,497
Thank you.

59
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:28,933
Ok, um,

60
00:02:28,935 --> 00:02:31,803
not that I don't love your
confidence and everything,

61
00:02:31,805 --> 00:02:34,205
but, um, should we really be
making promises like that?

62
00:02:34,207 --> 00:02:36,107
The accountant
is on his way back

63
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:38,610
from Corto Maltese with the
money that was deposited

64
00:02:38,612 --> 00:02:41,179
into Cayden James' bank
account as we speak.

65
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:42,614
You could've
just told them that,

66
00:02:42,616 --> 00:02:44,249
got those folks
off your back.

67
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,817
I'm not telling them
anything concrete

68
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:47,185
until that money is

69
00:02:47,187 --> 00:02:48,920
back in the city's
bank accounts.

70
00:02:48,922 --> 00:02:51,155
My bigger concern
right now is finding

71
00:02:51,157 --> 00:02:53,491
Cayden's associates
before Dinah does,

72
00:02:53,493 --> 00:02:55,159
because she is on
the warpath.

73
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:56,861
Yeah.

74
00:02:56,863 --> 00:02:58,062
Any luck with that?

75
00:02:58,064 --> 00:02:59,664
John is working
a few leads.

76
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,866
We should know more
in a few hours.

77
00:03:01,868 --> 00:03:03,468
Don't worry. They're not
gonna let anything happen to Laurel.

78
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,203
Oh, right.

79
00:03:05,205 --> 00:03:06,638
The accountant's here.

80
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,939
Send him in.

81
00:03:07,941 --> 00:03:09,173
All right.
I'll take that as my cue.

82
00:03:09,175 --> 00:03:10,275
I got to head
over to planning.

83
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:15,346
Ok. Ahem. Welcome.

84
00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:18,516
What are you doing here?

85
00:03:18,518 --> 00:03:19,884
Well, he's carrying
evidence.

86
00:03:19,886 --> 00:03:21,152
I'm just, uh,
making sure

87
00:03:21,154 --> 00:03:22,887
it doesn't get up
and walk away.

88
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:26,157
Good luck with that.

89
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,760
I wasn't planning on seeing you
today, Lieutenant.

90
00:03:28,762 --> 00:03:30,962
Well, I wasn't
planning on it either,

91
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:32,530
but we've got a problem.

92
00:03:32,532 --> 00:03:34,065
Cayden James'
Corto Maltese bank account

93
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:35,867
has been withdrawn.

94
00:03:35,869 --> 00:03:38,102
What do you mean,
it's been withdrawn?

95
00:03:38,104 --> 00:03:40,872
It's empty. All 70 million.

96
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:42,206
Somebody took
all the funds out

97
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,841
before we got access.

98
00:03:43,843 --> 00:03:45,343
Do we have
any idea who?

99
00:03:45,345 --> 00:03:48,112
No. But I do have 3 guesses.

100
00:03:48,114 --> 00:03:50,048
I put in a request
for the withdrawal log,

101
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,716
but it's a long shot.

102
00:03:51,718 --> 00:03:55,019
If we don't have
those funds in 48 hours,

103
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:57,021
this city's
government services

104
00:03:57,023 --> 00:03:58,890
will shut down.

105
00:03:58,892 --> 00:04:02,026
And I understand, but banks
in third world countries,

106
00:04:02,028 --> 00:04:03,895
like Corto Maltese,

107
00:04:03,897 --> 00:04:05,963
aren't exactly known
for their transparency.

108
00:04:05,965 --> 00:04:08,099
I'm very sorry, Mr. Mayor.

109
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:13,237
Something smells good.

110
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:14,906
Well, that smell is

111
00:04:14,908 --> 00:04:17,775
physics, mathematics,
and chemistry hard at work.

112
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:20,745
Felicity's teaching me
about thermodynamics?

113
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:21,846
That's right.

114
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:23,081
And we just
really wanted cookies.

115
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,916
Narc!

116
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:26,884
Don't you normally
have tutoring after school, bud?

117
00:04:26,886 --> 00:04:28,186
We all got sent home.

118
00:04:28,188 --> 00:04:29,887
Ms. Cho said it had to do
with the budget.

119
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:32,990
Is it true they might have
to close the schools?

120
00:04:32,992 --> 00:04:35,460
I'm working very hard
to make sure that doesn't happen.

121
00:04:35,462 --> 00:04:37,228
There's actually
something that I needed

122
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,863
to speak with Felicity
about.

123
00:04:38,865 --> 00:04:40,898
I'll keep working on
the cookies.

124
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,600
Thank you.

125
00:04:42,602 --> 00:04:46,037
Yeah. You definitely have
that "day from hell" look.

126
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:47,905
What's going on?

127
00:04:47,907 --> 00:04:50,942
Ahem. The money that Cayden
extorted from the city,

128
00:04:50,944 --> 00:04:52,610
someone emptied the account.

129
00:04:52,612 --> 00:04:54,379
Yeah, that somebody's either
Anatoly, Diaz, or Laurel.

130
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:55,947
Or another player that we
haven't seen yet.

131
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:58,616
We requested the withdrawal
logs from the bank, but--

132
00:04:58,618 --> 00:04:59,751
it's Corto Maltese.
It's taking too long.

133
00:04:59,753 --> 00:05:01,953
You want me to help
expedite it.

134
00:05:01,955 --> 00:05:03,955
I need it to look like
it's coming through official channels.

135
00:05:03,957 --> 00:05:05,990
Yeah, I know. It's not my first rodeo
with Corto Maltese.

136
00:05:07,093 --> 00:05:08,960
Give me about an hour.

137
00:05:08,962 --> 00:05:11,162
Hey, you don't think
it's a coincidence?

138
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:12,964
Someone killing Cayden

139
00:05:12,966 --> 00:05:14,632
right as the money
goes missing.

140
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:16,200
It could be the same
person that framed you

141
00:05:16,202 --> 00:05:17,935
for Cayden's son's
murder.

142
00:05:17,937 --> 00:05:20,438
Could be. The only thing that
I know for sure right now

143
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,473
is that if I don't get
that money in 48 hours,

144
00:05:22,475 --> 00:05:25,176
this city is going
to have my head.

145
00:05:26,312 --> 00:05:27,979
Any luck finding Anatoly?

146
00:05:27,981 --> 00:05:30,114
Just Bratva dudes who
don't know anything.

147
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:31,983
What about you guys?

148
00:05:31,985 --> 00:05:34,819
Diaz's trail has gone colder
than my love life.

149
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:36,020
Same with Laurel.

150
00:05:36,022 --> 00:05:37,321
Well, if it's
any consolation,

151
00:05:37,323 --> 00:05:39,056
the other guys are
striking out, too.

152
00:05:39,058 --> 00:05:40,958
I ran into dig chasing
the same dead end.

153
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,326
I guess they're not
sharing their Intel with us,

154
00:05:42,328 --> 00:05:44,028
not that we were
sharing any with them.

155
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,496
Well, we can't trust them
to keep us looped in.

156
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:47,098
And that's why I got put

157
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,900
on the Cayden James
bank situation.

158
00:05:48,902 --> 00:05:50,968
Any clue we get can
lead us to the scum

159
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,437
who worked with him.

160
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,005
Scum, singular,
or scum, plural?

161
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:56,040
And, yes, that is me
bringing up

162
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:58,142
exactly what's going on
between you and Laurel.

163
00:05:58,144 --> 00:05:59,811
Well, we're not braiding
each other's hair, Curtis.

164
00:05:59,813 --> 00:06:03,014
I mean, but you are
out for revenge,

165
00:06:03,016 --> 00:06:04,348
and I don't--

166
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,384
I don't feel
too good about that.

167
00:06:13,726 --> 00:06:15,193
Got to go.

168
00:06:15,195 --> 00:06:17,361
Looks like we got a lead
on the missing money.

169
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:23,835
You ok with this?

170
00:06:23,837 --> 00:06:26,971
D. Hunting Laurel?

171
00:06:26,973 --> 00:06:28,773
Let's just worry about
the money first.

172
00:06:28,775 --> 00:06:30,741
Then we'll deal with Dinah.

173
00:06:30,743 --> 00:06:32,710
You're not
gonna believe it.

174
00:06:32,712 --> 00:06:35,379
The bank just sent over the
withdrawal log we requested,

175
00:06:35,381 --> 00:06:37,315
plus security footage.

176
00:06:37,317 --> 00:06:39,083
That is
unbelievable.

177
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:40,651
What are we seeing?

178
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:42,386
The account was accessed
by this woman.

179
00:06:42,388 --> 00:06:44,088
She's listed in
the withdrawal log

180
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,324
as Siu Jerk Jai.

181
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:49,060
Took out the entire amount
in bearer bonds.

182
00:06:49,062 --> 00:06:50,761
Some excellent
work, Jay.

183
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:54,198
Ok. We'll take it
from here. Thank you.

184
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,601
Thanks.

185
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:02,106
I'm guessing Felicity had
something to do with this.

186
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:04,008
Yes, she did.

187
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,210
Thank you for inserting
yourself into this, by the way.

188
00:07:06,212 --> 00:07:08,212
Oh, yeah, sure. Well, you never
would've shared the information otherwise.

189
00:07:08,214 --> 00:07:09,780
No, I wouldn't have
because I

190
00:07:09,782 --> 00:07:11,516
don't trust you to
do the right thing.

191
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:13,084
And what is that?

192
00:07:13,086 --> 00:07:14,385
Politely ask Laurel
to give back the money?

193
00:07:14,387 --> 00:07:16,087
Not kill her.

194
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:21,058
Dinah, I understand
that you're hurting.

195
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,827
I get it.

196
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:24,662
I also understand that I don't have
the most credibility

197
00:07:24,664 --> 00:07:27,565
when it comes to telling people not
to commit murder.

198
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:30,535
But the city is on the verge of
economic collapse,

199
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:32,670
and we just found
the key to fixing that.

200
00:07:32,672 --> 00:07:36,173
Laurel is never giving
you that money.

201
00:07:36,175 --> 00:07:37,308
You don't know that.

202
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,011
Yeah, I actually do,

203
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:42,613
because I know that when
you look at her,

204
00:07:42,615 --> 00:07:44,482
you see the Laurel
that you lost.

205
00:07:44,484 --> 00:07:46,918
And that's why
you'll never be able to do

206
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,886
what's necessary to get
that money back.

207
00:07:48,888 --> 00:07:50,588
And you will?

208
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,624
Understand something--

209
00:07:53,626 --> 00:07:57,495
I will never let you
cross that line.

210
00:07:57,497 --> 00:07:59,797
If you're gonna
threaten me, Oliver,

211
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:02,800
you better be damn sure
you can deliver.

212
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:19,684
Easy, easy,
easy, easy.

213
00:08:19,686 --> 00:08:22,186
You'll pop
your stitches.

214
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,656
How are you feeling?

215
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:27,992
Like I've been shot
in the gut.

216
00:08:30,196 --> 00:08:32,263
Where am I?

217
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:36,367
You're someplace
nobody can find you.

218

220

Oh, I guess we know
now what happened

221
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:49,959
to $70 million.

222
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:52,294
Right. If we find her,
then we find it.

223
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:56,499
Quentin, I know that we
have been over this,

224
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:58,334
but just for accuracy,

225
00:08:58,336 --> 00:09:00,202
you were the last person
that saw her.

226
00:09:00,204 --> 00:09:02,104
Yeah, well, I d--
you know, I didn't see her, exactly.

227
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:03,405
- Right.
- I mean, l-l-like I told you,

228
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:05,141
Dinah got off a shot
before--

229
00:09:05,143 --> 00:09:07,776
just as Laurel knocked
us both out with-- with her cry.

230
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:11,780
And, uh, yeah, when I--
when I came to, Laurel was gone.

231
00:09:11,782 --> 00:09:14,049
So are we even sure
that Dinah hit her?

232
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:16,585
No. She didn't leave a definitive
blood trail at the scene.

233
00:09:16,587 --> 00:09:19,455
We can go back over it with chemical analysis,
see if we missed anything.

234
00:09:19,457 --> 00:09:21,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We can do that.

235
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:23,058
Um, listen,
oh, actually, there--

236
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,127
there is something
I should--I should tell you.

237
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:28,697
Um, while Cayden James
was holding the city hostage,

238
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:30,866
Laurel started
following me, all right?

239
00:09:30,868 --> 00:09:33,736
It was right after
James kidnapped me.

240
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:36,772
And, so, um, well, you know,
I caught up with her.

241
00:09:36,774 --> 00:09:38,807
I, uh, tried to make
a connection.

242
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:41,377
Well, I mean,
after what we just saw her do

243
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:42,878
to Dinah's
boyfriend,

244
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,580
are we even sure
that that worked?

245
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:46,682
Actually,
it might've.

246
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:48,884
When we went through
her go-bag at the scene,

247
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:54,490
there was a photo in there
of you and, um, our Laurel.

248
00:09:54,492 --> 00:09:57,193
I gave her
that picture. Heh.

249
00:09:57,195 --> 00:09:58,761
Anyways, uh, my--

250
00:09:58,763 --> 00:10:01,363
my point being, if she
hasn't skipped town yet,

251
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:03,199
maybe she'll come try
to find me,

252
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:04,466
make a connection.

253
00:10:04,468 --> 00:10:05,968
You know, say good-bye
or something.

254
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,070
I mean, it's
a long shot, but--

255
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:11,340
I agree, but I also don't
think that we can afford to be picky. So...

256
00:10:11,342 --> 00:10:13,042
I'll--I'll get home.

257
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:14,843
I'll make it easy for her
to, you know, get me alone.

258
00:10:14,845 --> 00:10:16,779
If she shows up, just make sure
that you stall long enough

259
00:10:16,781 --> 00:10:18,414
for John and I to get there.

260
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,915
Yeah. Sure. Fine.

261
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:22,251
But do you need me to,
you know,

262
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:23,519
go with you for backup?

263
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:25,387
Uh, no, no. You know,
like you said,

264
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:27,590
it's a long shot,
right? Heh!

265
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:29,592
So your time's probably
better spent here

266
00:10:29,594 --> 00:10:31,293
at the office.

267
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,028
But--but thank you.

268
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,599
Ok. Well, call if you
need anything.

269
00:10:38,302 --> 00:10:41,570
We've already been over
this spot a thousand times.

270
00:10:41,572 --> 00:10:44,073
Yeah, which is exactly why
I brought my new toy.

271
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:48,777
Presenting Mr. Terrific's
supersonic spectrograph.

272
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:51,313
It uses Earth-2
Sonic frequencies emitted

273
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:52,681
from Black Siren

274
00:10:52,683 --> 00:10:54,583
and combines them
with light imaging

275
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:57,453
to create a holographic
replication of her position

276
00:10:57,455 --> 00:10:59,622
during that night's events.

277
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,092
- Is that...
- Laurel.

278
00:11:03,094 --> 00:11:05,494
Is she crawling?

279
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:10,466
No. She was dragged.

280
00:11:14,305 --> 00:11:16,605
Looks like she
wasn't putting up much of a fight.

281
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,340
Your bullet must've
tagged her, D.

282
00:11:18,342 --> 00:11:19,608
Good.

283
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,543
Now we just
have to find her

284
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:22,645
before the others
do something stupid.

285
00:11:22,647 --> 00:11:24,213
Stupid how?

286
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:26,015
Oliver is not
seeing clearly on this.

287
00:11:26,017 --> 00:11:27,816
He's desperate to get
that money.

288
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:30,286
He will believe anything
Laurel says.

289
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:31,887
Shouldn't we also be
desperate for that money?

290
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:33,422
The city's hurting.

291
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:35,858
I know, but there
are more effective ways

292
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,459
to find out where she's
keeping that money.

293
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:40,129
Sounds like
you're talking about torture.

294
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:42,464
And it sounds like you
want to go soft on her.

295
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:46,001
Curtis, the only way
to get justice for Vince

296
00:11:46,003 --> 00:11:49,004
and money for the city
is going to be messy.

297
00:11:49,006 --> 00:11:50,673
Hey, guys,
look at this.

298
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:52,541
Tire tracks.

299
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:54,843
If they're from whoever
dragged her off,

300
00:11:54,845 --> 00:11:56,512
could be something.

301
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:58,013
Let's make sure

302
00:11:58,015 --> 00:12:00,215
they didn't leave
anything else behind.

303
00:12:05,923 --> 00:12:08,891
I, uh, picked this up
at a noodle shop

304
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:10,492
my girls used to love.

305
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:14,396
I've never been
to any noodle shop.

306
00:12:14,398 --> 00:12:16,899
Well, hot and sour's
the best thing for healing

307
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:19,335
no matter what earth
you're from. Ha ha!

308
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:22,137
And I think I might
have a picture here of the 3 of us.

309
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:23,939
Would you stop?

310
00:12:23,941 --> 00:12:26,475
I've already told you, there is nothing
inside of me to change

311
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:29,545
or going to change.

312
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:40,289
Um, you know, you, uh,
you let me go

313
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:43,525
instead of killing me
like James wanted.

314
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:47,930
You hesitated killing
Vincent Sobel.

315
00:12:47,932 --> 00:12:51,934
Before doing exactly that.

316
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:53,736
Yeah.

317
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:56,505
You've done some pretty
unspeakable things.

318
00:12:58,142 --> 00:13:01,043
Have you ever stopped to
ask yourself why?

319
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:06,582
Huh?

320
00:13:08,152 --> 00:13:11,487
Basically you grew up
without a father.

321
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:15,457
My guess, you've spent
your whole life looking for one.

322
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:19,595
Zoom, Adrian Chase,

323
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:21,930
Cayden James.

324
00:13:21,932 --> 00:13:24,867
All those men are
gone now,

325
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:27,519
including Cayden James--
he was killed last night.

326
00:13:31,108 --> 00:13:32,941
Well, it looks like
I have an opening

327
00:13:32,943 --> 00:13:35,344
for a new domineering
father figure.

328
00:13:35,346 --> 00:13:37,479
Feel free to send in
your application.

329
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:38,947
You don't need
anybody else

330
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:40,949
telling you what to
do with your life.

331
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:44,953
Interesting, coming from
someone who has me locked up

332
00:13:44,955 --> 00:13:47,122
in a cabin in the middle
of nowhere.

333
00:13:47,124 --> 00:13:49,491
You're welcome
to leave anytime.

334
00:13:50,694 --> 00:13:55,798
But my--well,
my guess is that

335
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,133
it's been
a long time

336
00:13:58,135 --> 00:14:00,936
since you had
a chance to decide

337
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:02,604
what you want your
life to be.

338
00:14:02,606 --> 00:14:04,973
So I figured
I'd give you

339
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:06,608
a little
time and space

340
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,877
to do just that.

341
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,014
Now, I got my hopes,
for sure,

342
00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:13,582
but you're the one

343
00:14:13,584 --> 00:14:16,418
that has to want
to change.

344
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,022
It's weird.

345
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:24,293
I actually really like
hot and sour soup.

346
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:29,264
Maybe we have more things
in common than I thought.

347
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:34,436
You should tell me more
about your Laurel.

348
00:14:41,312 --> 00:14:42,878
Well, the luminol's
certainly doing its work

349
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,513
on this blood trail.

350
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:46,181
Yeah.
So much blood,

351
00:14:46,183 --> 00:14:47,516
we shouldn't need
the luminol to see it.

352
00:14:47,518 --> 00:14:48,984
Someone cleaned
this place up.

353
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:50,519
Yeah, because Laurel lost
too much blood

354
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:52,020
to do it
herself.

355
00:14:52,022 --> 00:14:54,723
What, so someone helped
her get away?

356
00:15:00,064 --> 00:15:02,498
Nope. Someone took her.

357
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:05,634
I don't want to
believe it, but I can.

358
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:08,003
We need to find her before they do
something irreversible.

359
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:10,572
If they haven't already.

360
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:14,109
How has this print
gotten us nowhere?

361
00:15:14,111 --> 00:15:15,577
We're not nowhere.

362
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:17,212
We've already ruled out
all the known vehicles

363
00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:19,081
in the SCPD
criminal database.

364
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,616
Which just leaves us

365
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:22,050
with millions of
other unknown vehicles.

366
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:24,853
Otherwise known
as nowhere.

367
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:27,589
Rene is right.
This lead is exhausted.

368
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:30,893
What the hell?

369
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:34,563
Where is she?

370
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:36,265
We know you have
Black Siren.

371
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:38,567
If she dies, you've
destroyed the city.

372
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:40,869
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We do not have Black Siren.

373
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:42,337
We'll figure that
out for ourselves.

374
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:43,972
Since when is
our word not enough?

375
00:15:43,974 --> 00:15:46,208
Since you tried
to kill her.

376
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:50,345
If she dies, that money
is lost forever.

377
00:15:50,347 --> 00:15:54,316
Lost forever,
like Vincent Sobel.

378
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:58,020
Where was the Green Arrow when
he needed saving?

379
00:15:58,022 --> 00:16:00,088
Your team walked
into a trap.

380
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,524
If you came with us, Vincent
might still be alive.

381
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:04,560
Don't you dare
say his name.

382
00:16:04,562 --> 00:16:06,895
Thermal imaging is only
showing our 6 heat signatures inside.

383
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:08,730
I mean, if Laurel's
here, she's...

384
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:10,632
Not warm.

385
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:13,001
Are you hacking us?
Don't hack us, Felicity?

386
00:16:13,003 --> 00:16:16,171
I'm not hacking you.
I wouldn't hack--

387
00:16:16,173 --> 00:16:18,707
yeah, I'm--technically,
I'm hacking you.

388
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:19,975
It wouldn't be
your first time.

389
00:16:19,977 --> 00:16:21,877
No, it wouldn't.

390
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:24,146
She's tracked
all of you before

391
00:16:24,148 --> 00:16:26,615
because we needed to know

392
00:16:26,617 --> 00:16:29,084
if one of you
broke our trust.

393
00:16:29,086 --> 00:16:30,619
One of you did.

394
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:34,690
You have already punished
Rene for that mistake.

395
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:36,291
You know, it's just too bad

396
00:16:36,293 --> 00:16:38,527
he doesn't look like
Laurel Lance, Oliver,

397
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:40,596
because if he did, you would
probably forgive him

398
00:16:40,598 --> 00:16:42,130
for murder.

399
00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:43,799
Guys, we're not
actually about to fight

400
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:45,801
about this, are we,
like physically fight?

401
00:16:45,803 --> 00:16:48,904
Keep your team in line,
Curtis, and we won't have to find out.

402
00:16:48,906 --> 00:16:50,639
Hold on.

403
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:52,407
You guys barged into
another team's bunker.

404
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:54,242
Curtis, just listen
for once.

405
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:56,878
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, guys, no. I--

406
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,681
I do think Oliver
wants to fight,

407
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:03,819
because that's how
you always solve your problems.

408
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:06,188
That doesn't make
you a hero.

409
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,658
It makes you a thug.

410
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,627
And it's a real shame

411
00:17:11,629 --> 00:17:13,695
because he's
gonna feel so betrayed

412
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:15,664
when he figures it out.

413
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:19,635
You know who I'm talking
about, don't you, Hoss?

414
00:17:19,637 --> 00:17:22,004
William.

415
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,743
Don't turn your back
on me.

416
00:17:27,745 --> 00:17:29,945
- Hey!
- Don't move.

417
00:17:29,947 --> 00:17:32,614
- So you're gonna shoot us, dig?
- Do it.

418
00:17:37,121 --> 00:17:39,655
So this was your
plan all along, huh?

419
00:17:39,657 --> 00:17:42,190
To get the chance
to look through our bunker.

420
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:45,827
And you wonder why
we can't trust you.

421
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:47,529
We don't have
to wonder anymore.

422
00:17:47,531 --> 00:17:49,531
Laurel's not here. Let's go.

423
00:17:52,736 --> 00:17:54,736
Just so you know,

424
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:56,638
we are gonna find her.

425
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,707
And when we do,
you'd better hope to God

426
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:01,043
you're not there, too.

427
00:18:05,076 --> 00:18:06,139
You think you know somebody.

428
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,500
Then they do a triple worm/
blue cobalt IP hack

429
00:18:08,501 --> 00:18:10,401
that you taught them right
into your soul.

430
00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:11,669
Ohh. God. I can't
believe we

431
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:13,371
even ever worked
with them.

432
00:18:13,373 --> 00:18:15,873
You say "with," but what
you really mean is "for."

433
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,809
They never treated us
like we were equals.

434
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:19,377
Perimeter alarms reset.

435
00:18:19,379 --> 00:18:24,582
Uh, also, I borrowed a piece
of your tech, Curtis.

436
00:18:24,584 --> 00:18:26,417
What did you do?

437
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:29,020
You didn't really think I
wanted Oliver to hit me.

438
00:18:29,022 --> 00:18:31,756
Would you care
to share with the rest of the class?

439
00:18:31,758 --> 00:18:34,392
I planted one of Curtis'
audio chips on Oliver.

440
00:18:34,394 --> 00:18:40,431
So if they get the drop
on Laurel, so will we.

441
00:18:42,736 --> 00:18:44,769
Ain't Karma a bitch?

442
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:46,638
I hate to state

443
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,040
the, oh,
so depressingly obvious,

444
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:51,709
but since Dinah and company
don't have Laurel,

445
00:18:51,711 --> 00:18:56,447
we have nothing,
Nada, zilch, bupkis.

446
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:58,916
Not true. We have 3 former teammates
who hate us more now

447
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:00,718
than they did
before.

448
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,553
Can't worry about them.

449
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:04,422
Guys, we're out
of time here.

450
00:19:04,424 --> 00:19:05,857
Should I reach out
to Lyla?

451
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:07,425
I appreciate that, John,
but the last thing

452
00:19:07,427 --> 00:19:09,027
that we need right now is
yet another group

453
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:10,762
putting Black Siren in
their crosshairs.

454
00:19:10,764 --> 00:19:12,463
Oh,
square, meet one.

455
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:14,098
She didn't vanish off
the face of the earth.

456
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,533
Are you sure? I mean,
because, technically,

457
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:16,834
she is
from another earth.

458
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:20,438
We're gonna find her

459
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,607
because we have to.

460
00:19:28,481 --> 00:19:31,949
Quentin.

461
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:33,818
Thea, wh--wh--what
are you doing here?

462
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,453
You following me?

463
00:19:35,455 --> 00:19:37,455
Yeah, well, I...
I knew

464
00:19:37,457 --> 00:19:39,457
you were lying
about something.

465
00:19:39,459 --> 00:19:41,225
I--I did not
think it was this.

466
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:43,161
Ok, she's sleeping.
Please.

467
00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:44,595
Ok, well, why didn't
you tell me?

468
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:46,497
I thought we were
in on this together.

469
00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:47,799
I didn't want to put you
in a position where you,

470
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:49,400
you know, you had to lie
to Oliver, ok?

471
00:19:49,402 --> 00:19:52,770
But, listen, this is
the right thing, ok?

472
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:55,139
I think I am getting
through to her,

473
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:57,108
but you got to go before
she wakes up. Please.

474
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,611
Ok, fine, but did you
at least find where the money is?

475
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:01,946
Well, I'm building
up to that.

476
00:20:01,948 --> 00:20:06,484
Look, I know how
important she and--

477
00:20:06,486 --> 00:20:08,252
and this whole thing
is to you.

478
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:10,154
I get it.

479
00:20:10,156 --> 00:20:12,824
But the city is dying
without that money.

480
00:20:12,826 --> 00:20:14,559
We need to find it.

481
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:16,627
Right. Right, right.
And, you know, I'll ask her.

482
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:18,563
But she j--she just--

483
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:20,832
she can't feel like she's
being forced into something.

484
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:22,400
Ok, well, you're
running out of time.

485
00:20:22,402 --> 00:20:24,469
I got to call Ollie
and get him in on this.

486
00:20:24,471 --> 00:20:25,570
Ok, I'm sorry, but your
brother's not exactly known

487
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:27,405
for his light touch,
all right?

488
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:29,173
And you and I, we both know
that I am the only person

489
00:20:29,175 --> 00:20:31,042
with any chance of
getting through to her.

490
00:20:31,044 --> 00:20:33,077
Oh, that's so sweet
of you to think, Daddy,

491
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,413
but Thea's right.

492
00:20:35,415 --> 00:20:38,349
You should probably
call your BFF.

493
00:20:43,056 --> 00:20:45,022
Thea, I'll be back
to city hall

494
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:46,624
as soon as I can be.

495
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:48,559
Ollie, I am not
in the office.

496
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:49,861
Where are you?

497
00:20:49,863 --> 00:20:52,563
With Quentin and Laurel.

498
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:53,865
What?

499
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:56,601
Are you ok?
Did she hurt you?

500
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:58,236
Yeah, I'm fine.
Don't worry.

501
00:20:58,238 --> 00:21:00,271
She's too torn up
to scream.

502
00:21:00,273 --> 00:21:03,407
Quentin has been taking
care of her in a cabin.

503
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:05,409
It's really cool.
He's been hiding her out here.

504
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:08,212
Excuse me. It's a little more
complicated than that, ok?

505
00:21:08,214 --> 00:21:09,981
No, Quentin,
it's really not.

506
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:12,116
Ok,
let's cut the crap.

507
00:21:12,118 --> 00:21:13,618
I hear your city's
on a clock.

508
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,453
Where's the money?

509
00:21:15,455 --> 00:21:16,721
Don't worry.

510
00:21:16,723 --> 00:21:18,022
I'll tell you everything
after you

511
00:21:18,024 --> 00:21:19,824
help me get the hell
out of this country.

512
00:21:19,826 --> 00:21:21,726
No deal.

513
00:21:21,728 --> 00:21:24,295
Well, the offer's not
getting any better, Ollie.

514
00:21:24,297 --> 00:21:27,064
And the only reason I'm even considering
handing over my nest egg

515
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:29,066
is because I need help
getting away

516
00:21:29,068 --> 00:21:32,336
from that nasty little
songbird friend of yours.

517
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,174
Fine.

518
00:21:37,877 --> 00:21:40,344
Speedy, text me
the address.

519
00:21:42,882 --> 00:21:46,384
That was easier
than expected.

520
00:21:46,386 --> 00:21:47,885
Oliver's willing
to burn Vince,

521
00:21:47,887 --> 00:21:49,987
but he'll let that
murdering bitch go.

522
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:53,558
You were right, D.
Oliver just took Laurel at her word.

523
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,694
The city's not getting
its money back that way.

524
00:21:56,696 --> 00:21:58,162
It's up to us.

525
00:21:58,164 --> 00:22:00,631
Can you track
the bug?

526
00:22:00,633 --> 00:22:01,999
You know I can.

527
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:04,635
Then let's suit up.

528
00:22:10,643 --> 00:22:13,110
6 miles out. Head west.

529
00:22:15,248 --> 00:22:18,316
Felicity, you might want to make sure
your seat belt is on.

530
00:22:18,318 --> 00:22:20,551
Yeah, it's good. Why?

531
00:22:20,553 --> 00:22:22,620
We got a tail.

532
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:26,657
We're marked.

533
00:22:40,306 --> 00:22:43,674
- Ohh. Think it's the others?
- It has to be.

534
00:22:43,676 --> 00:22:45,977
How did they find us?

535
00:22:47,647 --> 00:22:50,114
- Oh, my--
- what?

536
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:52,450
This.

537
00:22:56,689 --> 00:22:58,522
Rene wanted me to hit him.

538
00:22:58,524 --> 00:22:59,724
It doesn't matter now.
They're in our dust.

539
00:22:59,726 --> 00:23:01,459
But can you
keep them there?

540
00:23:01,461 --> 00:23:03,327
You forgot what you
hired me for 6 years ago.

541
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:04,929
Whew! That was
exhilarating.

542
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:07,531
That was Alanis
Morissette-level ironic,

543
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:09,867
but it's ok.

544
00:23:22,016 --> 00:23:23,208
Hello, Ollie.

545
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:24,508
Where's the money?

546
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,850
Haven't we gone through
this already?

547
00:23:26,852 --> 00:23:30,287
No money until I am
safely out of this country.

548
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:32,456
You are in no position
to make demands.

549
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:36,426
I can think of 70 million
different reasons

550
00:23:36,428 --> 00:23:37,961
why you're wrong about that.

551
00:23:37,963 --> 00:23:39,630
Ok.

552
00:23:39,632 --> 00:23:41,565
No, no. Oliver, Oliver,
please, please.

553
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:43,400
Listen, Dinah's just got
her scared, all right?

554
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:45,903
And for good--good reason.

555
00:23:45,905 --> 00:23:49,673
Laurel needs our protection.

556
00:23:49,675 --> 00:23:52,309
Which is why you
should let me go with you.

557
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:54,878
I'll make sure you get out
of the country safely,

558
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,515
and then we can start
your new life together.

559
00:23:58,517 --> 00:24:00,784
Quentin,
that's insane.

560
00:24:00,786 --> 00:24:03,754
Well, well, well. That
was quite the performance,

561
00:24:03,756 --> 00:24:06,523
but now that I know that it was
only about the money, hard pass.

562
00:24:06,525 --> 00:24:08,792
Actually, Thea
had it right earlier.

563
00:24:08,794 --> 00:24:10,894
I was more focused on
getting through to you

564
00:24:10,896 --> 00:24:12,562
than the money,

565
00:24:12,564 --> 00:24:16,199
but I believe that if you'd
had someone in your world

566
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:19,603
to support you when
things got bad,

567
00:24:19,605 --> 00:24:21,939
you wouldn't be
a criminal.

568
00:24:21,941 --> 00:24:26,109
This is our chance to
find out if I'm right.

569
00:24:27,913 --> 00:24:29,646
If, after a while,
you decide

570
00:24:29,648 --> 00:24:33,684
that you don't want
me there, I'll leave.

571
00:24:33,686 --> 00:24:36,253
I promise.

572
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:39,256
This time around,
everything's down to you.

573
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:45,228
Pack your sun block.

574
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,264
I've always wanted to
live somewhere tropical.

575
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:49,733
Quentin...

576
00:24:49,735 --> 00:24:51,902
The minute that she is
out of the country,

577
00:24:51,904 --> 00:24:55,272
you get added to the list
of people she's killed.

578
00:24:56,475 --> 00:24:58,842
I'm betting
otherwise.

579
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:01,511
And you trust her enough

580
00:25:01,513 --> 00:25:04,881
to risk yourself,
to risk the city?

581
00:25:04,883 --> 00:25:06,717
Tell me now.

582
00:25:09,989 --> 00:25:11,989
I do.

583
00:25:14,093 --> 00:25:16,493
Then so do I.

584
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:25,469
That's it.

585
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:27,270
I am not sitting here on
the side of the road,

586
00:25:27,272 --> 00:25:31,008
like trash, while they let
that murderer go free!

587
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,576
Guys, we're gonna
find them.

588
00:25:32,578 --> 00:25:36,113
How? They tossed away our
bug like it was a--a bug.

589
00:25:36,115 --> 00:25:38,715
I think I know a way.

590
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:40,217
But it's gonna
hurt John.

591
00:25:40,219 --> 00:25:42,452
You say that like it's
a deal breaker.

592
00:25:42,454 --> 00:25:44,588
That guy's the whole reason
I got shot, Hoss.

593
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:47,090
Curtis, this is not the time to be worrying
about John's feelings.

594
00:25:47,092 --> 00:25:54,131
No, I mean really
hurt John physically.

595
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:58,468
Find them
whatever it takes.

596
00:25:59,772 --> 00:26:01,204
Ok, well,

597
00:26:01,206 --> 00:26:03,006
the union reps' deadline
is coming up soon.

598
00:26:03,008 --> 00:26:04,875
3 1/2 hours to be
depressingly exact.

599
00:26:04,877 --> 00:26:06,343
Don't worry. We'll be gone,

600
00:26:06,345 --> 00:26:08,045
and the money will be back
in city coffers by then.

601
00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:10,013
It had better be.

602
00:26:10,015 --> 00:26:12,149
Your new cover
identities are almost done.

603
00:26:12,151 --> 00:26:13,917
You have a one-way ticket
on a private plane

604
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,919
to your father-daughter
trip of a lifetime.

605
00:26:15,921 --> 00:26:19,890
Just keep that vengeful bird
of yours from finding me.

606
00:26:19,892 --> 00:26:21,525
Aah! Ugh!

607
00:26:21,527 --> 00:26:23,193
John? It's his arm.

608
00:26:23,195 --> 00:26:25,028
The implant,
it's been disabled.

609
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,863
Someone's hacking it
remotely to broadcast our location.

610
00:26:26,865 --> 00:26:28,298
It's not "someone."
It's Curtis.

611
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,067
They know where we are.
Can you fix John?

612
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:32,102
I'm rebooting the chip now.

613
00:26:32,104 --> 00:26:34,104
It's gonna be a while before
you have full functionality.

614
00:26:34,106 --> 00:26:37,040
You're gonna be dealing
with your post-injury symptoms for a bit.

615
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:39,242
I'm aware.

616
00:26:39,244 --> 00:26:41,178
How long do we have?

617
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,080
Based on the amount of
time that's passed since we last lost them

618
00:26:43,082 --> 00:26:45,015
and now that they've
attacked John, not long.

619
00:26:45,017 --> 00:26:46,583
I'm sorry, but with
the other team that angry,

620
00:26:46,585 --> 00:26:48,385
that close, I can't protect
Laurel by myself.

621
00:26:48,387 --> 00:26:49,786
You don't have to.

622
00:26:49,788 --> 00:26:51,088
What, are you gonna fight
your old team?

623
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,223
This is insane.

624
00:26:54,426 --> 00:26:57,761
Let's get ready
to move.

625
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:03,066
You're gonna turn right
in a mile, dirt road.

626
00:27:03,068 --> 00:27:04,601
You got us back
on track, Mr. T.

627
00:27:04,603 --> 00:27:06,970
I pity those fools now.

628
00:27:06,972 --> 00:27:09,039
Do they know that we
know where they are?

629
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:12,175
Trust me. They know.

630
00:27:12,177 --> 00:27:14,611
Here's the turn.

631
00:27:16,582 --> 00:27:19,549
Listen,
Laurel is a meta.

632
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:23,053
Now, I know the people protecting
her were our friends.

633
00:27:23,055 --> 00:27:24,654
But if you hold back,

634
00:27:24,656 --> 00:27:26,990
if any of us hold back
our punches here,

635
00:27:26,992 --> 00:27:29,860
we are the ones who
are gonna get hurt.

636
00:27:29,862 --> 00:27:32,896
And Laurel and the city's money
will both be gone.

637
00:27:32,898 --> 00:27:34,631
Understood?

638
00:27:36,635 --> 00:27:39,136
Sonic dampener arrow.

639
00:27:39,138 --> 00:27:41,705
I never thought Dinah
would be the one we'd use that against.

640
00:27:41,707 --> 00:27:43,607
Having second thoughts?

641
00:27:43,609 --> 00:27:46,009
Best-case
scenario, man--

642
00:27:46,011 --> 00:27:47,777
Laurel avoids punishment
for what she's done

643
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:49,279
and we put a hurting
on the people

644
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:50,780
who used to be
our friends.

645
00:27:50,782 --> 00:27:52,315
But we keep the city
from dying.

646
00:27:52,317 --> 00:27:54,417
But at what cost?

647
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:56,186
If the people going
after her

648
00:27:56,188 --> 00:27:58,722
didn't look like Curtis,
Dinah, and Rene,

649
00:27:58,724 --> 00:28:01,324
would you even be asking
this question?

650
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:03,894
No. No.

651
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:08,098
But I can't help
but wonder,

652
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,867
would we be doing
this if the person they were after

653
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:12,769
didn't look like
Laurel?

654
00:28:12,771 --> 00:28:16,139
Now, listen, man, I
would back any call you make, Oliver.

655
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:17,741
Always have,
always will.

656
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:21,111
We should acknowledge
the fact

657
00:28:21,113 --> 00:28:24,181
that going after our former teammates
is maybe a line

658
00:28:24,183 --> 00:28:26,183
we can never uncross.

659
00:28:26,185 --> 00:28:29,186
I agree.

660
00:28:29,188 --> 00:28:31,922
But they crossed it first.

661
00:28:36,995 --> 00:28:40,197
Take the other car
to the main road and don't turn back.

662
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:42,232
We'll stop the other team
from following.

663
00:28:42,234 --> 00:28:44,834
You'll have the city's money
in two hours, I promise.

664
00:28:44,836 --> 00:28:47,704
Thank you
for fighting for me.

665
00:28:47,706 --> 00:28:49,739
I'm not doing this
for you.

666
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:52,309
But when it's over,

667
00:28:52,311 --> 00:28:54,844
I don't want
to hear your name

668
00:28:54,846 --> 00:28:59,683
or see your face
ever again.

669
00:28:59,685 --> 00:29:02,118
Why not
let me handle that?

670
00:29:03,622 --> 00:29:05,589
You know, it's a shame
you can't scream.

671
00:29:05,591 --> 00:29:07,224
It almost makes this
too easy.

672
00:29:07,226 --> 00:29:10,327
Oh, sweetie, I don't have
to scream to kill you.

673
00:29:10,329 --> 00:29:12,696
You are unbelievable.

674
00:29:12,698 --> 00:29:14,397
I cannot believe
you did that.

675
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,166
You could've seriously
hurt John!

676
00:29:16,168 --> 00:29:18,368
Just like you guys are gonna
really hurt the city

677
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,237
if you let her go!

678
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:22,305
Nothing's happened
that can't be undone.

679
00:29:22,307 --> 00:29:24,307
We're not saying it's a perfect outcome
or even a good one,

680
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:26,276
but at least the city
gets its money.

681
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:27,911
That's not
justice, Hoss.

682
00:29:27,913 --> 00:29:30,547
That's enough. We've
debated this already.

683
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:32,682
We know where you stand.

684
00:29:32,684 --> 00:29:34,317
It's time to finish this.
Right now!

685
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:38,922
Dinah, not one more step.

686
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,347
Get to the car!

687
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,454
Rene.

688
00:30:07,028 --> 00:30:08,694
You're wasting
arrows.

689
00:30:08,696 --> 00:30:11,330
Am I?

690
00:30:19,641 --> 00:30:22,708
Rene! Rene, stop!

691
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,843
Are you crazy?

692
00:30:23,845 --> 00:30:25,544
Yeah, I must be! Yeah.

693
00:30:25,546 --> 00:30:26,612
Run!

694
00:30:26,614 --> 00:30:28,047
All right.
Go, go, go, go, go.

695
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:29,849
Hyah!

696
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:33,953
Go help Curtis.

697
00:30:36,357 --> 00:30:38,591
It's all right.
We're getting there, Laurel.

698
00:30:38,593 --> 00:30:40,693
It's all right.

699
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,529
Laurel, Laurel,
come on.

700
00:30:43,531 --> 00:30:44,864
We got to go.
We got to go.

701
00:30:44,866 --> 00:30:47,867
- We got to move.
- Quentin. Quentin.

702
00:30:50,672 --> 00:30:53,005
You stay behind me.

703
00:30:55,243 --> 00:30:57,143
Dinah, you can't do this.

704
00:30:57,145 --> 00:30:58,678
Get out of my way.

705
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,013
You can't do this.
Please don't.

706
00:31:01,015 --> 00:31:05,885
Uh! Aah. Dinah, don't--

707
00:31:31,379 --> 00:31:32,611
Last chance, Rene.

708
00:31:32,613 --> 00:31:33,746
Stay down!

709
00:31:33,748 --> 00:31:36,248
No way.

710
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:39,418
- Hyah! Hyah! Hyah...
- Hyah! Hyah! Hyah...

711
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:50,763
- Hey, is everyone ok?
- We'll live.

712
00:31:50,765 --> 00:31:52,531
- Can you manage?
- Yeah.

713
00:31:52,533 --> 00:31:55,401
We can cut them off.
Let's go.

714
00:32:07,615 --> 00:32:09,749
- Hyah!
- Unh!

715
00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:20,126
Is this what it
felt like

716
00:32:20,128 --> 00:32:22,695
right before you
killed Vince?

717
00:32:22,697 --> 00:32:27,133
I'm s--I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

718
00:32:27,135 --> 00:32:31,971
We are way,
way past sorry.

719
00:32:31,973 --> 00:32:33,973
Dinah?

720
00:32:35,043 --> 00:32:38,644
If we lose her,
we lose the money.

721
00:32:38,646 --> 00:32:40,980
But even if we had
the money...

722
00:32:40,982 --> 00:32:43,315
You can't do this.

723
00:32:43,317 --> 00:32:46,519
Oh, God. I have to,
Curtis.

724
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:49,188
You know I have to.

725
00:32:50,758 --> 00:32:52,691
I have to get
justice for Vince.

726
00:32:52,693 --> 00:32:54,860
Dinah, look around.

727
00:32:54,862 --> 00:32:56,295
Look at what we're
doing to each other.

728
00:32:56,297 --> 00:32:57,930
Does this look like justice?

729
00:32:57,932 --> 00:33:01,200
It's nobody's fault
but theirs.

730
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,870
Then you sound
just like Oliver.

731
00:33:06,407 --> 00:33:09,508
We formed this team so we
wouldn't be like that,

732
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,444
like him.

733
00:33:12,613 --> 00:33:15,548
Dinah, I don't want
to start today.

734
00:33:30,998 --> 00:33:32,832
I will not be put

735
00:33:32,834 --> 00:33:34,867
back in that cage!

736
00:33:39,006 --> 00:33:42,675
- Sorry.
- We can still catch her.

737
00:33:42,677 --> 00:33:45,744
No. You can't.

738
00:33:47,148 --> 00:33:49,148
No more advantages.

739
00:33:50,885 --> 00:33:52,918
I don't need them.

740
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,720
He's still hurting.

741
00:33:54,722 --> 00:33:57,289
Don't get soft now,
Curtis.

742
00:33:57,291 --> 00:34:00,926
We're just get--
getting started.

743
00:34:03,364 --> 00:34:04,897
Rene!

744
00:34:05,766 --> 00:34:07,833
Quentin!

745
00:34:07,835 --> 00:34:09,101
You ok?

746
00:34:09,103 --> 00:34:10,236
What the hell's happening?

747
00:34:10,238 --> 00:34:11,770
We need to get
to a hospital.

748
00:34:11,772 --> 00:34:13,873
Now!

749
00:34:28,908 --> 00:34:30,875
Any sign of Laurel?

750
00:34:30,877 --> 00:34:32,677
That trail
has gone cold.

751
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,278
I don't think
that she'll be

752
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,114
able to get very far
with her injuries.

753
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:39,331
What about yours?

754
00:34:39,332 --> 00:34:40,932
Nothing Felicity
can't fix.

755
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:43,334
Well, I still can't
believe Curtis did this.

756
00:34:43,336 --> 00:34:45,469
I mean, messing with the chip in your arm
is totally crossing the line.

757
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:48,005
It's our company's
prototype.

758
00:34:49,242 --> 00:34:51,409
Obviously, injuring
you is way more

759
00:34:51,411 --> 00:34:53,210
a crossing of the line.

760
00:34:53,212 --> 00:34:54,812
Way more.

761
00:34:54,814 --> 00:34:56,547
It's not like we
didn't hurt them back.

762
00:34:56,549 --> 00:34:58,616
Has anyone heard
about Rene?

763
00:34:58,618 --> 00:35:00,885
I mean, he--he
didn't look so good.

764
00:35:00,887 --> 00:35:03,721
He was shot 5 months ago.
The wound reopened.

765
00:35:03,723 --> 00:35:05,323
Well, we should
go to the hospital.

766
00:35:05,325 --> 00:35:06,924
We got to make sure
he's ok.

767
00:35:06,926 --> 00:35:09,393
Well, unless anyone here
has $70 million,

768
00:35:09,395 --> 00:35:10,995
there won't be
a hospital soon.

769
00:35:10,997 --> 00:35:12,563
Listen, Laurel is
gonna call, all right?

770
00:35:12,565 --> 00:35:14,265
She's gonna call.

771
00:35:14,267 --> 00:35:16,300
No, she's not.

772
00:35:17,704 --> 00:35:21,372
I know how much we
all wish she

773
00:35:21,374 --> 00:35:23,874
was more like the
Laurel that we lost.

774
00:35:26,179 --> 00:35:28,379
She's not.

775
00:35:32,685 --> 00:35:35,820
We should get ready
to talk to the press.

776
00:35:35,822 --> 00:35:37,288
Quentin's right.

777
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,824
We should go
and check on Rene.

778
00:35:41,828 --> 00:35:44,228
Please tell him that
I'm sorry.

779
00:35:46,733 --> 00:35:49,400
I screwed up, Thea.

780
00:35:49,402 --> 00:35:51,969
No, Quentin. You...

781
00:35:51,971 --> 00:35:54,038
You just believed
in your daughter, ok?

782
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,340
That's not screwing up.

783
00:35:56,342 --> 00:35:58,809
And she is your daughter

784
00:35:58,811 --> 00:36:00,711
in the only way that
really matters.

785
00:36:00,713 --> 00:36:04,749
Yeah. What way's that?

786
00:36:04,751 --> 00:36:08,352
In the eyes of her father.

787
00:36:17,663 --> 00:36:19,930
Any update?

788
00:36:22,335 --> 00:36:24,635
Yeah. My bloodstream
is about to reach

789
00:36:24,637 --> 00:36:26,537
90% coffee
saturation.

790
00:36:26,539 --> 00:36:29,006
Ohh. Ok.

791
00:36:29,008 --> 00:36:30,841
You know, I said
that joke,

792
00:36:30,843 --> 00:36:32,977
hoping that you
would laugh,

793
00:36:32,979 --> 00:36:37,348
but maybe now is not the best time
to be saying jokes,

794
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,983
so I'll just...

795
00:36:38,985 --> 00:36:40,317
Yeah.

796
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:43,421
No updates on Rene.

797
00:36:43,423 --> 00:36:45,489
They've been working
on him for hours, huh?

798
00:36:45,491 --> 00:36:47,491
Yeah.

799
00:36:47,493 --> 00:36:49,493
But, you know,

800
00:36:49,495 --> 00:36:52,463
Rene's the definition
of stubbornness.

801
00:36:52,465 --> 00:36:54,698
No way is he gonna let
Oliver be the reason

802
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,367
he goes down.

803
00:36:56,369 --> 00:36:57,668
Yeah.

804
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:02,406
Dinah, this whole
Laurel thing,

805
00:37:02,408 --> 00:37:04,642
it's not over.

806
00:37:04,644 --> 00:37:08,079
The second Rene is
in the clear,

807
00:37:08,081 --> 00:37:09,980
we're gonna track
her down

808
00:37:09,982 --> 00:37:13,651
and we are going to
arrest her.

809
00:37:13,653 --> 00:37:17,354
We will get justice
for Vince.

810
00:37:17,356 --> 00:37:19,457
Thank you for saying that.

811
00:37:19,459 --> 00:37:22,927
If it wasn't for you,
I would've repaid Vincent's death

812
00:37:22,929 --> 00:37:25,563
with more violence.

813
00:37:26,566 --> 00:37:28,766
That isn't justice.

814
00:37:30,103 --> 00:37:33,504
I'm--I'm grateful to you,

815
00:37:33,506 --> 00:37:36,407
you know, just
for pulling me back. So...

816
00:37:36,409 --> 00:37:41,345
The speech worked because
I have faith in you, Dinah.

817
00:37:43,082 --> 00:37:45,950
I also had my T-spheres
programmed as a plan B.

818
00:37:52,525 --> 00:37:54,425
City reps
are all waiting,

819
00:37:54,427 --> 00:37:56,427
and they don't know
about the money or lack thereof.

820
00:37:56,429 --> 00:37:58,496
You don't need to be here,
you know?

821
00:37:58,498 --> 00:38:01,632
If you're facing the firing squad,
I'm standing by your side.

822
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,703
I don't know
what to tell them.

823
00:38:05,705 --> 00:38:06,837
It's not your
fault, Ollie.

824
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:09,340
I'm the mayor, Speedy.

825
00:38:09,342 --> 00:38:12,009
I made a vow to protect
Star City,

826
00:38:12,011 --> 00:38:14,445
and I'm sorry,
but I didn't.

827
00:38:14,447 --> 00:38:16,113
I couldn't.

828
00:38:16,115 --> 00:38:19,884
And I swear that I will
make it up to them, but I--

829
00:38:19,886 --> 00:38:21,585
just that, ok, Ollie?

830
00:38:21,587 --> 00:38:24,221
You just tell them that.

831
00:38:33,266 --> 00:38:35,266
Please, please.

832
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:43,140
I need to--ahem--I need
to inform everyone

833
00:38:43,142 --> 00:38:45,442
that the money extorted
from us

834
00:38:45,444 --> 00:38:49,446
by the cyber terrorist
Cayden James has not been recovered.

835
00:38:49,448 --> 00:38:51,415
And to be honest with you,

836
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:54,485
I don't know that
it ever will be.

837
00:38:54,487 --> 00:38:58,822
Now, I promised everyone
that I would find the funds

838
00:38:58,824 --> 00:39:00,925
to keep the Metro area
running

839
00:39:00,927 --> 00:39:03,460
without work stoppages,
but...

840
00:39:04,664 --> 00:39:06,463
I'm so very sorry.

841
00:39:06,465 --> 00:39:08,465
As mayor, I...

842
00:39:10,036 --> 00:39:11,802
I have failed this city.

843
00:39:11,804 --> 00:39:16,006
Now, I know that your faith
in me is likely shaken,

844
00:39:16,008 --> 00:39:20,411
but my faith--my faith in
the citizens of Star City...

845
00:39:20,413 --> 00:39:22,546
The mayor's luck
just keeps getting worse.

846
00:39:22,548 --> 00:39:23,714
D.A. Armand.

847
00:39:23,716 --> 00:39:25,849
You got a sec?

848
00:39:25,851 --> 00:39:28,519
My case against Queen
is built on sand.

849
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:31,188
It's only a matter of time before
Jean Loring figures that out.

850
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,957
And why are you
telling me that?

851
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:35,226
I found something
that could bury Queen,

852
00:39:35,228 --> 00:39:38,696
but I'll need
the full backstop--

853
00:39:38,698 --> 00:39:41,465
all the SCPD's
resources.

854
00:39:44,203 --> 00:39:46,870
I can see why Mr. Diaz
likes you.

855
00:39:49,242 --> 00:39:50,708
The news isn't good.

856
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:53,110
Mr. Ramirez suffered
a traumatic hemothorax.

857
00:39:53,112 --> 00:39:55,512
We were able to stop
the bleeding in his chest,

858
00:39:55,514 --> 00:39:57,681
but the injury
also caused his lung to re-collapse.

859
00:39:57,683 --> 00:40:01,118
Now, given the severity of
your friend's injuries,

860
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,853
I'm recommending he
be transferred to a facility

861
00:40:02,855 --> 00:40:04,888
that can provide
the care he needs

862
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:07,625
outside of Star City.

863
00:40:07,627 --> 00:40:09,526
Mr. Ramirez
is resting now.

864
00:40:09,528 --> 00:40:12,529
You and your friends
will have to wait to see him.

865
00:40:12,531 --> 00:40:13,831
What friends?

866
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:16,734
We thought Rene
would be here.

867
00:40:16,736 --> 00:40:18,569
Well,
of course he's here.

868
00:40:18,571 --> 00:40:20,170
You saw what Oliver
did to him.

869
00:40:20,172 --> 00:40:22,606
Yeah. Yeah.
How's Rene doing?

870
00:40:22,608 --> 00:40:26,510
You've lost the right
to ask that question.

871
00:40:26,512 --> 00:40:28,012
You two need
to leave.

872
00:40:28,014 --> 00:40:30,581
No. No, not until you
tell us if Rene's ok.

873
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:33,951
- This is not--
- Stop it.

874
00:40:33,953 --> 00:40:35,719
Don't you guys get it?

875
00:40:35,721 --> 00:40:37,955
We're not
just done fighting you.

876
00:40:37,957 --> 00:40:40,591
We're done with
the 3 of you period.

877
00:40:40,593 --> 00:40:47,364
No more cooperation, no
more communication forever.

878
00:40:50,403 --> 00:40:52,736
Let's go.

879
00:40:54,607 --> 00:40:56,206
Fine.

880
00:41:18,164 --> 00:41:20,664
I don't know what
day it is.

881
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:22,800
I don't know
what day it is.

882
00:41:22,802 --> 00:41:24,535
Are you ok?

883
00:41:24,537 --> 00:41:28,972
I escaped. I--I was
kidnapped from here

884
00:41:28,974 --> 00:41:30,708
two years ago, I think.

885
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:33,210
I--I don't know.
I...Ugh.

886
00:41:33,212 --> 00:41:36,013
Lady, what's your name?

887
00:41:39,685 --> 00:41:41,618
Laurel...

888
00:41:43,652 --> 00:41:46,286
Laurel Lance.

889
