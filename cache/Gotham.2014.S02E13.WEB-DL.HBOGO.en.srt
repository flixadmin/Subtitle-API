1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,520
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,360
Last night some psycho
froze a cop to death.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,000
He was using super-cooled
liquid helium.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,640
It's one of the most effective
substances in the world

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,760
for rapid temperature reduction.

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,200
He just wants to know
where it comes from

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,600
so we can track down the guy.

8
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,360
- You confess to murder?
- Yes, I do.

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,160
I'm not a criminal you know.
I'm just insane.

10
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,760
I almost crossed the line today.

11
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,720
- How out of character.
- Scared me a little.

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,080
Welcome to my world.

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,760
I can freeze you like we planned.

14
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,800
- But.
- I can't bring you back.

15
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,560
- Solution A 14.
- No, no, no, no, no.

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,800
I'm just thinking of all those poor
mice you're experimenting on.

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,400
What are you gonna do now?
Look for this Malone guy yourself?

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,480
Honestly,
I haven't thought that far ahead.

19
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,440
Nora!

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,880
You are going to help save my wife.

21
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,240
My husband did terrible things
but he did those things for my sake.

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,680
I'm dying, he wants to save me.

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,280
I'd like to make a confession.

24
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,440
I'm the man that's been freezing
people.

25
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,880
A-16, it worked.

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,920
- Am I dead?
- I can't believe it worked.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,440
I'm coming for you, Nora.
I'm coming to save you.

28
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,880
Where is everybody?

29
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,000
Listen up,
Ace Chemicals makes the liquid helium

30
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,160
Victor Fries uses
to power his weaponry.

31
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,240
Fries was spotted entering
the building 20 minutes ago.

32
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,040
He's desperate
and extremely dangerous.

33
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,200
Let's do this.

34
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,360
Damn.

35
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,640
What the hell happened here?

36
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,080
Night janitor. Could be a hostage.

37
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,400
Detectives.

38
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,080
Canisters gone.

39
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,160
Looks like he got what he was after.

40
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,960
What's he planning?

41
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,720
Free my wife.

42
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,520
{\an5}How was Switzerland?

43
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,560
{\an5}There're mountains. Snow.

44
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,000
{\an5}People are polite.

45
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,000
{\an5}Alfred said you wanted to talk to me.

46
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,280
{\an5}Alfred wanted me to speak with you.
He's worried about you.

47
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,360
{\an5}He's worried that you might
be concealing any trauma

48
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,560
{\an5}you must be feeling.

49
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,000
{\an5}He needn't worry.

50
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,480
{\an5}I tell him I'm fine, which I am
and he doesn't believe me.

51
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,480
{\an5}You were violently abducted.

52
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,200
{\an5}You nearly died.
You must have been very scared.

53
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,000
{\an5}It's normal to feel trauma,

54
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,680
{\an5}it's nothing you need
to be ashamed of.

55
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,960
{\an5}I wasn't scared.

56
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,400
No? What did you feel?

57
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,480
{\an5}I felt alive.

58
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,480
{\an5}Intensely alive.

59
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,080
Do you think I'm abnormal?

60
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,240
You're certainly unusual.

61
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,880
If you're being honest.

62
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,600
I'm always honest.

63
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,200
That's a good way to be.

64
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,600
Tough to pull off.

65
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
{\an5}I try.

66
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,360
{\an5}And how do you feel now?

67
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,240
{\an5}As I say, I feel fine.

68
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,480
{\an5}Invigorated.

69
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,320
I have a second chance at life.

70
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,680
{\an5}What do you plan to do
with that chance?

71
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,760
{\an5}My plans remain unchanged.

72
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,320
Find the man who killed my parents.

73
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,960
Bruce, you need closure.

74
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,160
Exactly.

75
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,800
Closure.

76
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,040
Not a dangerous
and possibly endless obsession.

77
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,560
I'll find him.

78
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,800
You're a schoolboy
not a homicide detective.

79
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,520
{\an5}I believe people can be
two things at once.

80
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,360
{\an5}Don't you think so?

81
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,480
{\an5}Yes, they can.

82
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,960
So you find the culprit. What then?

83
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,760
{\an5}I'll let the law take its course.

84
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,600
Is that the truthful answer?

85
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,360
It's the answer I'm giving you.

86
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,280
What happened to Honest Bruce?

87
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,760
That's a very good question.

88
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,960
{\an5}I guess that's the other Bruce.

89
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,840
Sorry. I don't mean
to be flippant with you.

90
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,320
This conversation has been
very useful.

91
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,600
Clarifying.

92
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,120
Perhaps, we can do it again sometime.

93
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Sure. We can do that.

94
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,200
Free my wife?

95
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,800
This guy thinks by killing seven cops
he can get us to free his wife?

96
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,520
I'll free my boot up his frozen ass.

97
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,200
Tin can lunatic son of a bitch,
I'll tear his.

98
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,560
I'm gonna take a breath.

99
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,040
Well, what about the hostage,
the janitor?

100
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,200
- Any demands?
- Not yet.

101
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,760
Obviously, we're dealing with a
madman

102
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,040
and once he realizes that we're not
gonna release his wife,

103
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,760
he's gonna come to us,
try to get her.

104
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,080
Right? Where else would he do?

105
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,480
I guess.

106
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,920
When he does, we'll be ready for him
and we'll take him.

107
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,720
- Where is she now?
- In a holding cell.

108
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,200
Lee and a paramedic
are seeing to her.

109
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,720
Lee says if she doesn't move
to a hospital soon she could die.

110
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,080
Dammit.

111
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,160
We can't secure Gotham General.

112
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,120
It's too many access points.
Too many civilians.

113
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,760
Arkham.
They have a full ER facility, right?

114
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,480
We'll take her to Arkham.

115
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,480
This way she can get the care
she needs.

116
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,400
And we can capture Fries
without endangering any civilians.

117
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,760
- Makes sense.
- Sense?

118
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,520
It's a lunatic asylum filled
with crazy people.

119
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,160
- You got any better ideas?
- No.

120
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,520
You prep her to travel.

121
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,720
I'll call the director at Arkham
and get that out to the press.

122
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,400
I want Fries taking the bait.

123
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,680
I'll gonna let you tell Lee

124
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,040
that we're sending her patient
to the nuthouse.

125
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,960
- She'll understand.
- Oh, yeah. Totally. Completely.

126
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,120
Let me get this straight.

127
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,640
You plan on using
a dying woman as bait?

128
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,120
A tethered goat at Arkham?

129
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,480
It's not like that.

130
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,800
Are you going to tell her husband
where you're taking her?

131
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,480
- Yes, but...
- Then it is like that.

132
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,000
It's the least bad of several
bad options.

133
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,240
We could spread false word
that she's at Gotham General,

134
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,160
but what happens when Fries attacks?

135
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,720
It's filled with people
who are too sick to move.

136
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,240
This is the rational way to go.

137
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,080
Sometimes the rational way
is not the best way.

138
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,200
If there were better way,
we would take it.

139
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,000
Just trust me, Nora Fries
will be perfectly safe.

140
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,440
I got to go.

141
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,880
I'm going with her.

142
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,880
Lee, there are doctors at Arkham.

143
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,520
She is my patient.

144
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,800
I used to work there.
I know those doctors. I'm going.

145
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,960
It's not safe.

146
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,640
It's safe for Nora,
but it's not safe for me?

147
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,840
No, now, now, now, look, you know...

148
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,400
Yeah. Keep thinking, hotshot.
I'm gonna get my stuff.

149
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,840
No. You know what I meant.

150
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,680
If you use this on me,
I'm gonna scream.

151
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,040
Who was that?

152
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,640
One of Fries' victims.

153
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,960
I'd hoped to extract traces of Fries'
formula from the man's tissue.

154
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,160
But no such luck.

155
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,480
Speaking of, you had a call.

156
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,600
The GCPD wants to transfer Nora Fries
to Arkham medical wing.

157
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,720
You mean, the wife?

158
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,440
Apparently, she's very sick.

159
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,360
The police think Fries may try
to break her out.

160
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,920
They need a more secure
medical location.

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,280
Fries must be doing all this
to save his wife.

162
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,200
How romantic.

163
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,960
How perfect.

164
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,080
Here I am, desperately in need
of his cryonic expertise

165
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,560
and he's going to make a house call.

166
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,880
The fates are smiling on us.

167
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,800
Swiftly, Peabody, we must prepare.

168
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,480
<i>Having recovered
from being frozen solid</i>

169
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,120
<i>before stumbling out
to the bewilderment of the GCPD.</i>

170
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,040
<i>He was taken to Gotham memorial</i>

171
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,680
<i>where he was treated for minor
injuries and released.</i>

172
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,360
<i>We are now getting word that Nora
Fries, wife of infamous "Mr. Freeze",</i>

173
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,280
<i>is being taken to the medical wing
of Arkham Asylum.</i>

174
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,720
Arkham? She belongs in a hospital.

175
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,600
Not thrown in among lunatics.

176
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,400
It's a trap.

177
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,760
Of course, it is.

178
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,160
They're using her to get to me!

179
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,800
The fools.

180
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,480
They think walls
and guns can stop me?

181
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,600
They have no idea.

182
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,040
They'll learn.

183
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,000
Let me go, you brutes!

184
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,680
I want to speak to Professor Strange!

185
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,320
Director Strange is very busy today.

186
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,480
But rest assured, nothing happens
at Arkham

187
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,440
not according to his wishes.

188
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,400
What is this thing?
What're you doing to me?

189
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,280
You're to be the face of our
rehabilitation program.

190
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,960
If we can cure a man like
Oswald Cobblepot,

191
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,200
we can cure anyone.

192
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,760
I refuse.

193
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,920
I refuse to be part of your program.

194
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,880
You have no choice.

195
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,080
Know this, woman.

196
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,480
Nobody yet has failed
to regret vexing the Penguin

197
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,760
and you are vexing me.

198
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,640
Make your next decision
very carefully.

199
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,680
Duck.

200
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,720
Duck.

201
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,120
Duck.

202
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,680
Duck.

203
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,520
Duck.

204
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,880
Duck.

205
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,680
Duck.

206
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,160
Thank God.

207
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,520
- It was only a dream.
- Duck.

208
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,280
It was only a dream.

209
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,800
Goose!

210
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,560
You're supposed to chase me.

211
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,480
You're the goose.

212
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,800
No, no, I'm a...

213
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,680
I'm the...

214
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,360
I... I'm a penguin.

215
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,800
Goose!

216
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,440
Goose!

217
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,880
Goose!

218
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,040
Goose!

219
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,800
Problem?

220
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,960
He's not being the goose.

221
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,520
It's fun to participate in group,
Mr. Cobblepot.

222
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,280
You should try.

223
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,680
Yes, yes, I... I... I'd be glad to.

224
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,640
What is it they want me to do?

225
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,840
Be the goose.

226
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,320
Okay.

227
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,920
It's okay, it's okay.

228
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,760
Sweet Mother. Is that Penguin?

229
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,960
Duck.

230
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,520
Duck.

231
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,800
Seems drugged.

232
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,000
He's been quite agitated
since he arrived.

233
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,480
We put him on a mild sedative
to keep him from hurting himself.

234
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,560
Dr. Thompkins,

235
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,080
my assistant, Miss Peabody,
will accompany you to the infirmary.

236
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,680
She can provide whatever you need.

237
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,240
Thank you.

238
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,480
Duck.

239
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,280
Duck.

240
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,040
Duck.

241
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,680
We'll set up by the main gate.

242
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,080
You should probably get
the inmates back in their cells.

243
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,480
Duck. Duck.

244
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
- Duck.
- Harv, come on.

245
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,640
Duck.

246
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,520
Duck.

247
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,560
I trust you won't mind sharing
the wing with our dear Miss Kean.

248
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,600
You've got to be kidding me.

249
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,960
Oh, do you know Sleeping Beauty?

250
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,040
That's my name for her.

251
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,320
So lovely, so still. Like an angel.

252
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,440
Is there a problem?

253
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,920
No. No, problem at all.

254
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,560
Pinkney,

255
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,560
I want obstacles set up to keep Fries
from getting to the main building.

256
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,920
- Yes, sir.
- What about the bus?

257
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,200
Yeah, good idea.

258
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,400
And, Harvey,
I want a shooter up on that roof.

259
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,000
Jim! Jim.

260
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,520
Jim, my old friend! Jim.
Help, please.

261
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,040
Wait. Wait.

262
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,880
Give us a minute.

263
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,720
Thank God, you're here.

264
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,600
You have to help me.

265
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,200
They're torturing me.

266
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,880
Torture is what you do.

267
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,360
The doctors here are trying
to help you.

268
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,600
It's torture, I'm telling you!

269
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,040
I don't see any signs of it.

270
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,560
It's mental torture!

271
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,280
It's therapy.

272
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,320
You're insane, remember?

273
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,840
That's what your lawyers said anyhow.

274
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,080
Goodbye, Penguin.

275
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,720
You owe me, Jim Gordan.

276
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,280
I lied for you!

277
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,200
He killed Galavan! Not me!
It was him! It was him!

278
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,720
<i>You owe me, Jim Gordan.
I lied for you!</i>

279
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,320
<i>He killed Galavan! Not me!
It was him! It was him!</i>

280
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,080
<i>It was him!</i>

281
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,160
I should say, that's learned him
Master Bruce.

282
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,120
We're supposed to have
a training session.

283
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,880
Yeah. Well, I got held up
in the city, didn't I?

284
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,720
Besides, I thought your chat
with Dr. Thompkins

285
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
would keep you occupied.

286
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,760
And I thought you were
against therapy.

287
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,920
Well, that's before I realized
you're still keen on keeping secrets.

288
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,720
If I'd told you what Selina
and I had planned,

289
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,880
you would have stopped me.

290
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,480
Because I didn't I got the name
of my parents' killer from Silver.

291
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,520
Then you made us leave Gotham.

292
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,920
We lost more than a month we could
have spent searching for M. Malone.

293
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,280
We left the city

294
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,840
because you were at the end
of your emotional and physical rope.

295
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,800
And quite frankly, you're incapable
of catching a common cold

296
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,920
let alone a killer.

297
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,760
Will you, will you stop?

298
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,800
Now, I need to ask you
a very important question.

299
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,720
Are we in this together...

300
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,240
or not?

301
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,120
Yes.

302
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,480
We're in this together.

303
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,560
Right, well, I told you
I had some business in the city.

304
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,400
I went to see a sergeant I know

305
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,120
and we did some digging
in some GCPD files

306
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,280
for any M. Malones that fit
our particulars.

307
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,760
Age, size, height, race.

308
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,520
Whether they were free during
the murder of your parents.

309
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,680
And?

310
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,800
Patrick Malone.

311
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,600
Goes by the nickname, Matches.

312
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,480
Delightful chap really, committed
his first murder when he was 15.

313
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,240
Suspected of half a dozen since.

314
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,040
Now, I need to ask you.

315
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,320
If you were in charge, what next?

316
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,520
You could've gotten this information
from Detective Gordon.

317
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,680
Why didn't you contact him?

318
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,160
I'm the one asking the questions now,
Master Bruce.

319
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,280
We find this man,
what do you plan to do?

320
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,680
- Kill him.
- No.

321
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,560
- You can't stop me.
- I bloody can, and I will.

322
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,280
You're too young to have a death
on your conscience, Master Bruce.

323
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,200
- But, but...
- I know your parents deserve justice

324
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,200
and I know you're not gonna
stop till you find it.

325
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:51,400
But when we find this Malone,
I will kill him and not you.

326
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,520
That is the deal.

327
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,520
Do you accept?

328
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,880
- Yes.
- Say it.

329
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,400
We find him.

330
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,320
We make him talk.

331
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,400
You kill him.

332
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,400
You have no idea what you're missing.

333
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Bitch.

334
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,800
Where am I?

335
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,560
Where am I?

336
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,440
Nora. Try not to exert yourself.

337
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,880
You're in a hospital.

338
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,000
Who are you?

339
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,560
This is not Gotham General.

340
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,680
No. You're in a more secure place.

341
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,960
I'm Doctor Thompkins Lee.

342
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,360
They're scared of Victor.

343
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,400
Yes.

344
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,680
Victor only did these terrible things
because of me.

345
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,960
You're not responsible
for your husband's actions .

346
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,080
He's not an evil man.

347
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,320
He believes the good of saving me
outweighs the bad of his actions.

348
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,760
I understand.

349
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,920
But he's not my concern right now,
you are.

350
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,440
And you have to try and stay calm.

351
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,160
You're stable
but you're still very fragile.

352
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,720
I could have saved him.

353
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,520
I saw him going down this path.

354
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,720
Becoming more and more obsessed.

355
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,960
Why didn't I do something?

356
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,320
I know what you mean.

357
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,880
It's hard when you love someone.

358
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,120
You see the person that they were,
the person they could still become.

359
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,360
You close your eyes to the truth.

360
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,560
He's coming for me, isn't he?

361
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,440
The police think so.

362
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,560
So stubborn, my Victor.

363
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,080
- You're pregnant.
- Yes.

364
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,480
Do you know yet if it's a boy
or a girl?

365
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,160
Not yet.

366
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,000
I always wanted a girl.

367
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,960
You shouldn't be here.

368
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,320
Let's focus on you
and not worry about me. Okay?

369
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,280
Winter stakeout at the loony bin.
Fabulous.

370
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,440
Nora doesn't have long.
Fries knows that.

371
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,360
- He'll come soon.
- He'd better.

372
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,400
We could freeze to death waiting.
Which would be ironic.

373
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,280
You hear that?

374
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,200
Take cover!

375
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,200
Let's go. Heads up! Eyes Open.

376
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,360
Open fire.

377
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,880
Move, move, keep going.
Get the door. Go.

378
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,560
- Hands in the air!
- I can't! I can't!

379
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,800
Don't shoot!

380
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,440
- Where's Victor Fries?
- I don't know!

381
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,440
Please! Help me!

382
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,680
Let's go. Come on.

383
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,320
Chloe?

384
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,080
Chloe?

385
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,880
Help me.

386
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,800
Chloe!

387
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,160
Mom!

388
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,120
Copy that. Fries took out a wall
in the east wing.

389
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,160
Have B-team cut him off.
We'll head directly to the infirmary.

390
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,720
Alpha to Bravo continue
pursuing suspect

391
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,240
we're heading to the infirmary.

392
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,080
Copy that. Maintaining pursuit.

393
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,440
Take cover!

394
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,520
Nora!

395
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,480
What the hell?

396
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,000
Go!

397
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,240
<i>Hello, Victor.</i>

398
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,840
<i>Forgive me for getting straight
to the point.</i>

399
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,400
I'm a great admirer of your work

400
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,720
and I would like to offer
a way out of your situation.

401
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,960
Who are you?

402
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,280
<i>I'm a friend. But, let me ask you.</i>

403
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,440
Once you've rescue your wife,
what is your plan?

404
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,360
<i>To steal a vehicle?
Blast your way out?</i>

405
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,200
There is a set of keys on the chair.

406
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,360
<i>They belong to a vehicle that
is waiting by the loading docks.</i>

407
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,920
How do I know it's not a trap?

408
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It is not a trap.

409
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,560
It is an exchange.

410
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,920
<i>You get your wife and your freedom.</i>

411
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,640
I can keep the police at bay
while you escape,

412
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,200
<i>as thanks you will leave me</i>

413
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,960
one cartridge of your
cryonic formula.

414
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,720
<i>What do you say?</i>

415
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,280
<i>The police are coming,
you can't beat them</i>

416
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,640
<i>all and time is running out
for you...</i>

417
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,960
and for Nora.

418
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,400
Go fetch that,
would you Miss Peabody?

419
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,840
Fries is in the building.

420
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,000
We have to go.

421
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,320
We can't leave her.

422
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,520
The staff bailed when
the alarm went off, she'll die.

423
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,720
So we take her with us.

424
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,280
Come on.

425
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,600
Careful.

426
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,080
Thank you.

427
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,280
I'll take it from here.

428
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,800
Victor, Victor listen to me.

429
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,000
- We're trying to help her.
- You're killing her.

430
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,080
- No, no.
- Victor.

431
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,120
Victor, I understand why
you're doing this.

432
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,320
I'm saving her life.

433
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,520
At the cost of how many other lives?

434
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,400
Too many to turn back now.

435
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,360
Soon as I've done what I need to do,
I'll give myself up.

436
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,600
But now we have to leave.

437
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:20,160
Victor, I'm a doctor,
if we move her now she might die.

438
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,560
A doctor, good.

439
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,360
You're coming with us to push
the wheelchair, let's go.

440
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,160
- No, no way!
- Jim, I'm going.

441
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,480
- She's my patient.
- I can't let you do that.

442
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,720
I'll go, take me.

443
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,400
Jim, it's not your call.
She needs me.

444
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,160
I'm not gonna hurt her.

445
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,920
I don't wanna hurt anyone
unless I have to.

446
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,080
Jim, I'm going.

447
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,000
Victor, please, don't do this.

448
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,520
Nora, don't worry,
it's all under control.

449
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,960
Help.

450
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,360
We have to go, now.

451
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,560
You, in there.

452
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,440
Do what he is saying.
We'll be okay.

453
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,800
Now!

454
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,160
Okay.

455
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,640
Okay, let's go!

456
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,760
Thank you, so much.

457
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,960
<i>Lee!</i>

458
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,360
<i>Lee!</i>

459
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,480
Apologies officers, the extreme cold
has shorted the wiring,

460
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,600
we're working on it.

461
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,480
<i>Well, work on it quick!</i>

462
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,440
Oh, we are, we are.

463
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,040
Please put that somewhere very
safe would you Ms. Peabody?

464
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,440
Good news officers.

465
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,960
Did Fries say anything,
anything at all about his plans?

466
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,160
No, nothing. He just said sorry.

467
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,200
Yo, partner!

468
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,760
What'd we miss?

469
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,320
Fries got away with Nora and Lee.

470
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,800
I put a BOLO out on the vehicle
but that's all we got.

471
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,440
Fries has to put his wife on ice
as quickly as possible, right?

472
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,320
He can't go home
there's cops at the door,

473
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,800
where's he gonna go?

474
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,120
He's got the equipment with him.
He could freeze her anywhere.

475
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,120
Wait, now he could freeze her
but he can't keep her frozen,

476
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,600
not without one of those
cryo chambers he built.

477
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,720
Then he is going home.

478
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,960
It's still at his house.
They were never taken into evidence.

479
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,120
It's where he went, has to be.
Come on.

480
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,280
Victor, please think about this.

481
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,880
How will you take care of her
if you're in prison?

482
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,400
I won't, you will. Gotham will.
It's the law.

483
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,640
As long as she's legally alive,
she's a ward of the city

484
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,080
and the city has to keep
her alive and safe.

485
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,360
Victor.

486
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,960
Hey there, darling.

487
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,440
I've brought you home.

488
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,160
I'm so tired.

489
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,320
I know. It will all be over soon.

490
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,400
Victor...

491
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,160
I want you to let me go.

492
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,440
Let me die.

493
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,000
Nora, you don't mean that.

494
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,960
I can do this, the process works.

495
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,720
So I should wake up one day,
with you in prison?

496
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,600
Or dead?

497
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,800
A life alone isn't one that I want.

498
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,960
I'll be there when you wake up.
I'll be there.

499
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,240
I'll find a way, I will.

500
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,480
There's always hope.

501
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,640
As long as you're alive,
there's hope, right?

502
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,720
Yes, there's hope.

503
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,440
Okay.

504
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,920
My necklace, the one that you gave me
on our first anniversary.

505
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,440
It's on the nightstand,

506
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,520
would you get it for me please, dear?

507
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,240
Go. I'm strong enough to use it
if I need to.

508
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,080
If you hurry you can make it out
before he gets back.

509
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,880
I'm not leaving you.

510
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,920
This must be very stressful for you
and your baby.

511
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
We're fine.

512
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,760
Could I have some water?

513
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,720
Thank you.

514
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,200
You heard him.

515
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,760
He's not a bad man at heart.

516
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,800
- You have to tell them that.
- I will.

517
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,200
Please tell them that I'm very sorry
for my part in this.

518
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,080
I saw the man that he was becoming
and I did nothing.

519
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,800
Because I loved him.

520
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,360
You know what that's like, don't you?

521
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,360
I do.

522
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,120
Thank you.

523
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,360
You've been very kind.

524
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,760
God bless you and your baby.

525
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,000
Nora, I got it.

526
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,640
I've got it.

527
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,720
Victor...

528
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,880
I love you.

529
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,840
Please don't blame yourself.

530
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,320
I love you.

531
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,360
See you soon.

532
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,960
You should stand back.

533
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,080
I felt the breeze when you came
through the window.

534
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,760
I'm glad you came.

535
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,200
I need a favor.

536
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,960
Nice to see you, Selina.

537
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,360
Sorry for not telling you
that I was skipping town

538
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,480
to go to my castle in France.

539
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,640
It's a Chalet, in Switzerland.

540
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,720
Whatever.

541
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,320
Where's the king of Snotty England?

542
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,720
Alfred went to the city.

543
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,960
This is the man
that Silver told us about.

544
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,640
Alfred tracked him down.

545
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,720
Patrick Mallone.

546
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,720
I thought his name started with M?

547
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,920
The M stands for Matris,
it's a nickname.

548
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,480
That's a lame nickname.

549
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,200
So you found him,
what do you need me for?

550
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,360
I need you to get me a gun.

551
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,960
- So, you're gonna kill him?
- Yes.

552
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,240
Your Butler know?

553
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,600
Alfred thinks he's gonna be
the one to kill him,

554
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,680
that's what I'm asking you.

555
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,760
You couldn't even push
that guy out of the window.

556
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,520
So how do you expect to do this?

557
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,200
Because this man killed my parents.

558
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,600
You ever even fired a gun before?

559
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,120
Please, Selina,
you're the only person I can...

560
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,680
You don't even know
what you're asking, Bruce.

561
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,480
Yeah, sure, the guy deserves it.

562
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,440
But doing this,
you won't ever, ever be the same.

563
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,760
That's what I'm counting on.

564
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,640
Crap, how'd you wanna play this one?

565
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,960
Slow and careful,
no gunplay if we can help it.

566
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,320
Set up a perimeter,
I'm gonna look inside.

567
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,160
- Roger.
- Perimeter.

568
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,120
Hey, set up a perimeter.

569
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,080
Give me one more moment, doctor.

570
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,640
And I'll put myself in your charge.

571
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,640
No.

572
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,000
No.

573
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,720
No. No. No. No. No. No.

574
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,920
Nora!

575
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,160
I don't understand, it works,
my formula works!

576
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,440
How?

577
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,440
She switched cartridges.

578
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,560
She changed her cartridges?

579
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,200
Did you know?

580
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,720
Did you know she switched
the cartridges?

581
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,880
No.

582
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,560
I'm... I'm so sorry.

583
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,480
<i>Mr. Fries, this is the GCPD,
you're surrounded.</i>

584
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,320
<i>Please come out and give yourself up
and let's avoid any more sadness.</i>

585
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,800
Yeah.

586
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,360
No more sadness.

587
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,800
Will you be very kind

588
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,600
and go tell the Police
that I will do as they say?

589
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,960
Nora loved you very much.

590
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,280
I'm envious of the bond you had.

591
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,320
GCPD.

592
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,640
Victor?

593
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,840
Oh, my God.

594
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,640
Hey. You should go back to bed.

595
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,200
Can't sleep.

596
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,880
Heard you on the phone.

597
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,080
Hugo Strange called.

598
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,440
Victor Fries died
in Arkham infirmary.

599
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,240
They couldn't revive him.

600
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,480
- You okay?
- I am.

601
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,120
Are you?

602
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,040
Wish you hadn't gone.

603
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,480
Wish you hadn't put our baby at risk.

604
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,080
You put us at risk
when you put Nora at risk.

605
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,760
She was under my care.

606
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,960
That was different
that was Police work.

607
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,600
That was you, it's all you.

608
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,680
Arkham was actually Barnes' idea.

609
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,000
but it made sense,
it was good Police work.

610
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,920
What about Galavan?
Was that good Police work too?

611
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,080
- What about him?
- The way he died.

612
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,720
Whatever the truth is,
it's not what you told me.

613
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,880
How do you know?

614
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,000
Because I know when
you're being dishonest.

615
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,120
And you know what?

616
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,320
If anybody deserves to die,
its Galavan.

617
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,080
Don't talk to me about Police work,

618
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,000
it's you, you lied to me.

619
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,040
I know you say
there are no hopeless cases.

620
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,880
And there are none.

621
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,960
The beauty of life can spring forward
from even the harshest of climates.

622
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,160
We simply need to be more aggressive
in our treatment.

623
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,200
Now, I must go see
to our newest guest.

624
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,920
Good morning, Victor.

625
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,360
Where am I?

626
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,640
Legally your corpse is in the Arkham
morgue, but obviously you're here.

627
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,520
Indian Hill.

628
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,800
Indian Hill is a toxic waste dump.

629
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,640
A useful fiction.

630
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,240
You're the one who spoke
to me in Arkham.

631
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,560
Hugo Strange.

632
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,280
Pleasure to meet you face to face.

633
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,560
How is it I am not dead?

634
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,000
It's simply astonishing, isn't it?

635
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,800
My guess is that you absorbed some
of your formula over the past months.

636
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,480
Your body underwent
a profound cellular change,

637
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,080
when you were brought in here,
you were actually overheating.

638
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,440
Now look there, at the thermometer.

639
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,920
It's negative 20 degrees
and I'm not even cold.

640
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,120
The formula appears to have lowered
your core body temperature.

641
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,520
You can only survive in severe
hypothermic conditions,

642
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,200
anything above freezing
will kill you.

643
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,160
But never fear,
you won't be locked in there forever.

644
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,560
We've made some modifications to your
suit to allow you to walk freely.

645
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,840
For now, rest,
tomorrow we begin work.

646
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,160
One project in particular,
I think you will find fascinating.

647
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,480
I should have died with Nora.

648
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,840
This all should have ended.

649
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,440
Then take this opportunity, Victor,
pretend you did die.

650
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,240
Death is not an ending.

651
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,320
Death is a new beginning.
