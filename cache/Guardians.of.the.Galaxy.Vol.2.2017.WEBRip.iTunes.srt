1
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:10,279
There's a girl in this harbor town

2
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,490
And she works layin' whiskey down

3
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:17,911
They say,
"Brandy, fetch another round"

4
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,123
And she serves them
whiskey and wine

5
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,252
The sailors say
"Brandy, you're a fine girl"

6
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:29,256
"What a good wife you would be"

7
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:42,102
-Come on!
-Slow down!

8
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,271
This way, my river lily! Come on!

9
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,317
Where are you taking me?

10
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,401
Come on, come on.

11
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,778
Look. Look!

12
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,864
Oh, it's beautiful!

13
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,116
I was afraid
it wouldn't take to the soil...

14
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,534
but it rooted quickly.

15
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,370
And soon, it'll be everywhere.

16
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,540
All across the universe.

17
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,877
Well, I don't know what
you're talking about...

18
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,669
but I like the way you say it.

19
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:10,589
My heart is yours...

20
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,342
Meredith Quill.

21
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:17,763
I can't believe I fell in love
with a spaceman.

22
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,526
Showtime, a-holes!

23
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,445
It will be here any minute.

24
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,406
Which will be its loss.

25
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:19,074
I thought your thing was a sword?

26
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,285
We've been hired
to stop an interdimensional beast...

27
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,829
from feeding on those batteries,
and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?

28
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,373
It's just, swords were your thing
and guns were mine.

29
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,251
But I guess we're both doing guns now.
I just didn't know that.

30
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:32,754
Drax, why aren't you wearing
one of Rocket's aero-rigs?

31
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,256
It hurts.

32
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:35,299
It hurts?

33
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,594
I have sensitive nipples.

34
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,347
"My nipples hurt! Oh, goodness me!"

35
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,099
What about him? What's he doing?

36
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,768
I'm finishing this so we can listen to
tunes while we work.

37
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,187
How is that a priority?

38
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,731
Blame Quill. He's the one
who loves music so much.

39
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,441
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.

40
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,026
That's hardly important right now.

41
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,570
Okay. Sure, Quill.

42
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,656
No, seriously, I side with Drax.

43
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:03,160
No, I understand that.
You're being very serious right now.

44
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,495
I can clearly see you winking.

45
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,081
Damn it. I'm using my left eye?

46
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,255
I am Groot.

47
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,548
They were not looking at you funny.

48
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,931
Well, that's intense.

49
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,244
Groot!

50
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,928
Groot, get out of the way!
You're gonna get hurt!

51
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,096
Hi.

52
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,807
No! Spit it out!

53
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,142
Come on!

54
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,563
Disgusting!

55
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,044
The beast's hide is too thick
to be pierced from the outside.

56
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,380
I must cut through it from the inside.

57
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:44,423
Huh?

58
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,050
No, no! Drax, wait a minute!

59
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,093
Drax!

60
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,229
What is he doing?

61
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:02,232
He said the skin is too thick
to be pierced from the outside, so he...

62
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,109
-That doesn't make any sense!
-I tried telling him that!

63
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,737
Skin is the same level of thickness
from the inside as from the outside!

64
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,614
I realize that.

65
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,411
There is a cut on its neck.

66
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,788
Rocket, get it to look up.

67
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,877
Hey, you giant Sea-Monkey! Up here!

68
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,095
Watch it, Quill!

69
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,978
Yes! I have single-handedly...

70
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,272
vanquished the beast!

71
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,484
What?

72
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,829
What are they called again?

73
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,664
Anulax batteries.

74
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,041
Harbulary batteries.

75
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,502
That's nothing like what I just said.

76
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,379
But they're worth
thousands of units apiece...

77
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,673
which is why the Sovereign hired us
to protect them.

78
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,218
Careful what you say around these
folks. They're easily offended.

79
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,179
The cost of transgression is death.

80
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:00,517
We thank you, Guardians,
for putting your lives on the line.

81
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:04,688
We could not risk the lives
of our own Sovereign citizens.

82
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:09,359
Every citizen is born
exactly as designed by the community.

83
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,696
Impeccable, both physically
and mentally.

84
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,032
We control the DNA of our progeny...

85
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,534
germinating them in birthing pods.

86
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:21,205
I guess I prefer to make people
the old-fashioned way.

87
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:24,875
Perhaps someday, you could give me
a history lesson...

88
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,545
in the archaic ways of our ancestors.

89
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,839
For academic purposes.

90
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,799
I would be honored, yes.

91
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,968
In the name of research...

92
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,638
I think that could be pretty...

93
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,056
repulsive.

94
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,350
I'm not into that kind of casual...

95
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:42,559
Oh, please.

96
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:46,021
Your people promised something
in exchange for our services.

97
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:47,481
Bring it...

98
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,233
and we shall gladly
be on our way.

99
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:05,582
Family reunion. Yay.

100
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:08,252
I understand she is your sister.

101
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:12,714
She's worth no more to me
than the bounty due for her on Xandar.

102
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:17,261
Our soldiers apprehended her
attempting to steal the batteries.

103
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:20,180
Do with her as you please.

104
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,435
We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.

105
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,438
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?

106
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,235
My mother is from Earth.

107
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,279
And your father?

108
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,783
He ain't from Missouri.
That's all I know.

109
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,451
I see it within you.

110
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:45,122
An unorthodox genealogy.

111
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:49,501
A hybrid that seems particularly...

112
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,087
reckless.

113
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:56,133
You know, they told me you people
were conceited douchebags...

114
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:58,927
but that isn't true at all.

115
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:04,808
Oh, shit.

116
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,977
I'm using my wrong eye again,
aren't I?

117
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,521
I'm sorry. That was meant to be
behind your back.

118
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,192
Count yourself blessed
they didn't kill you.

119
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,110
You're telling me.

120
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,486
You wanna buy some batteries?

121
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:33,170
All right, let's get baldy to Xandar
and collect that bounty.

122
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,558
That stuff about my father...

123
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,726
Who does she think she is?

124
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,187
I know you're sensitive about that.

125
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,523
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just don't know who he is.

126
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:39,236
Sorry if it seemed like
I was flirting with the High Priestess.

127
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,946
I wasn't.

128
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:43,240
I don't care if you were.

129
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,200
Well, I feel like you do care.

130
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,744
That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!

131
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,080
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.

132
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,040
Damn shadow.

133
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,251
There are two types of beings
in the universe...

134
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,128
those who dance, and those who do not.

135
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,255
Mm-hmm.

136
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,424
I first met my beloved at a war rally.

137
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:01,425
Oh, God.

138
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:04,553
Everyone in the village flailed about,
dancing.

139
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,388
Except one woman.

140
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,098
My Ovette.

141
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:11,059
I knew immediately
she was the one for me.

142
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,770
The most melodic song in the world
could be playing.

143
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:16,607
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

144
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:19,568
Wouldn't move a muscle.

145
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:22,446
One might assume she was dead.

146
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:24,072
That does sound pretty hot.

147
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:27,242
It would
make my nether regions engorge.

148
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,286
Okay. I get it, yes.

149
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,246
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.

150
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:35,083
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic... like you.

151
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:43,300
I'm hungry.
Hand me some of that yaro root.

152
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:44,968
No. It's not ripe yet...

153
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,136
and I hate you.

154
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:47,513
You hate me?

155
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,349
You left me there
while you stole that stone for yourself.

156
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,684
And yet here you stand, a hero.

157
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,687
I will be free of these shackles
soon enough, and I will kill you.

158
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,356
I swear.

159
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:58,649
No.

160
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,194
You're gonna live out the rest of
your days in a prison on Xandar...

161
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:03,779
wishing you could.

162
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:11,662
This is weird.

163
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,539
We've got a Sovereign
fleet approaching from the rear.

164
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:14,706
Why would they do that?

165
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,500
Probably because Rocket stole
some of their batteries.

166
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:17,501
Dude!

167
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:19,002
Right.

168
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,337
He didn't steal some of those.

169
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:22,214
I don't know why they're after us.
What a mystery this is.

170
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,185
What were you thinking?

171
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:36,645
Dude, they were really easy to steal!

172
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:38,188
-That's your defense?
-Come on!

173
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,691
You saw how that High Priestess
talked down to us.

174
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,526
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

175
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,904
I didn't realize your motivation
was altruism.

176
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,532
It's really a shame the Sovereign
have mistaken your intentions...

177
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,367
-and they're trying to kill us.
-Exactly!

178
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,160
I was being sarcastic!

179
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,370
Oh, no!

180
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:55,873
You're supposed to use
a sarcastic voice! Now I look foolish!

181
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:57,541
Can we put the bickering on hold...

182
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,710
until after we survive
this massive space battle?

183
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:01,545
-More incoming!
-Good!

184
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:03,213
I wanna kill some guys!

185
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,389
You're not killing anyone.

186
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:14,266
All those ships are remotely piloted.

187
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:18,562
Damn it!

188
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:31,200
What is the delay, Admiral?

189
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:35,412
High Priestess, the batteries, they are
exceptionally combustible...

190
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:36,747
and could destroy the entire fleet.

191
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:39,625
Our concern is their slight
against our people.

192
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,462
We hired them and they steal from us.

193
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:46,089
It is heresy of the highest order.

194
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:49,968
All command modules...

195
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:52,721
fire with the intent to kill.

196
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,941
What's the nearest habitable planet?

197
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:06,276
It's called Berhert.

198
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,069
-How many jumps?
-Only one.

199
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:11,323
But the access point is 47 clicks away.

200
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,326
And you have to go through
that quantum asteroid field.

201
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:24,962
Quill, to make it through that...

202
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,797
you'd have to be the greatest pilot
in the universe.

203
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:27,964
Lucky for us, I...

204
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,633
I am.

205
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,146
What are you doing?

206
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,315
I've been flying this rig
since I was 10 years old.

207
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:48,527
I was cybernetically engineered
to pilot a spacecraft.

208
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:51,321
You were cybernetically engineered
to be a douchebag!

209
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:52,823
Stop it.

210
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,658
Later on tonight, you're gonna be
laying down in your bed...

211
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,827
and there's gonna be something
squishy in your pillow case.

212
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:58,370
And you're gonna be like,
"What's this?"

213
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:00,330
And it's gonna be because
I put a turd in there!

214
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:04,209
You put your turd in my bed,
I shave you.

215
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:05,794
It won't be my turd.

216
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:07,337
It will be Drax's.

217
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,800
I have famously huge turds.

218
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:14,344
We're about to die,
and this is what we're discussing?

219
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:18,015
Son of a...

220
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:19,641
Dude! Seriously!

221
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,351
Hey! Let me...

222
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,034
Idiots!

223
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:39,077
Well, that's what you get
when Quill flies.

224
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,832
We still have a Sovereign
craft behind us.

225
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,504
Our weapons are down.

226
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,714
20 clicks to the jump!

227
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:54,718
Hold on.

228
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,231
It's not ripe.

229
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:17,241
Come on, Zylak. You can do this.

230
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,538
Yes!

231
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:25,707
15 clicks to the jump!

232
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,251
Come on!

233
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:29,586
Keep going!

234
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,018
10 clicks!

235
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,357
Die, spaceship!

236
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,446
You suck, Zylak.

237
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:57,614
Typical.

238
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,326
Five clicks!

239
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:08,667
Son of a...

240
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:11,003
They went around the field!

241
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:27,644
Someone destroyed all our ships!

242
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,021
What?

243
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,692
Who?

244
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,069
One click!

245
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,989
-What is that?
-Who cares?

246
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:40,532
That's the jump point! Go!

247
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:45,996
It's a guy.

248
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,004
Oh, my God.

249
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:55,547
He's still out there?

250
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,826
Groot, put your seatbelt on!

251
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,996
Prepare for a really bad landing!

252
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,581
That was awesome!

253
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:13,083
Yes!

254
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:16,420
Look at this!

255
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:18,755
Where is the other half of our ship?

256
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:19,923
My ship.

257
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,719
Either one of you could have gotten us
through that field... Had you flown

258
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:26,763
with what's between your ears
instead  of what's between your legs!

259
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:30,184
If what's between my legs
had a hand on it...

260
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,477
I guarantee I could have landed
this ship with it.

261
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:35,272
Peter, we almost died
because of your arrogance.

262
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:37,065
More like because he stole...

263
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:38,442
the Anulax batteries!

264
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:40,777
They're called Harbulary batteries.

265
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:42,446
No, they're not!

266
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,489
Do you know why I did it, Star-Munch?

267
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,617
I'm not gonna answer to "Star-Munch."

268
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,702
I did it because I wanted to!

269
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:49,620
Dick.

270
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,580
What are we even
talking about this for?

271
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:54,374
We just had a little man save us
by blowing up 50 ships!

272
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,417
How little?

273
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:57,461
Well, I don't know, like this?

274
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:59,463
A little one-inch man saved us?

275
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,840
Well, if he got closer,
I'm sure he would be much larger.

276
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:04,301
That's how eyesight works,
you stupid raccoon.

277
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:05,886
Don't call me a raccoon!

278
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,680
I'm sorry. I took it too far.

279
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:10,849
I meant trash panda.

280
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:14,394
Is that better?

281
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:16,563
I don't know.

282
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,941
It's worse. It's so much worse.

283
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:20,400
You son of a...

284
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:21,276
Hey!

285
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:22,736
-I've had it with you!
-No! Back up!

286
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:24,655
Someone followed you through
the jump point.

287
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:28,909
Set me free, you'll need my help.

288
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:30,160
I'm not a fool, Nebula.

289
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:32,246
You are a fool if you deprive yourself
a hand in combat.

290
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:33,580
You'll attack me
the moment I let you go.

291
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:34,748
No, I won't.

292
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:38,126
You'd think an evil supervillain
would learn how to properly lie.

293
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:40,379
I bet it's the one-inch man.

294
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:16,039
After all these years, I've found you.

295
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:18,500
And who the hell are you?

296
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:22,504
I figured my rugged good looks
would make that obvious.

297
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,883
My name is Ego...

298
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:28,760
and I'm your dad, Peter.

299
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:46,695
You know what they say...

300
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:49,823
"You're out of luck
until you've gone duck."

301
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:17,976
Yondu!

302
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:20,687
Come on down!

303
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:34,493
After going around years in circles...

304
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,453
with this woman I end up marrying.

305
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,331
I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...

306
00:25:39,498 --> 00:25:40,916
"but you're losing your mind!"

307
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,043
Then again, she's always
been that way.

308
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,962
I could never trust her. You know?

309
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:46,213
Stakar.

310
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:52,177
It's been some time.

311
00:25:56,223 --> 00:26:00,227
It seems like this establishment
is the wrong kind of disreputable.

312
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:07,276
-Sir!
-Stakar!

313
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:09,778
There's a hundred Ravager factions.

314
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:12,990
You lost the business of 99 of them
by serving one.

315
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:14,658
Please, sir. Please!

316
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:16,201
Get away from me.

317
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:24,334
You can go to hell then!

318
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,753
I don't give a damn
what you think of me!

319
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:28,881
So what are you following us for?

320
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:30,382
Because you're gonna listen to
what I gotta say!

321
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:33,343
I don't gotta listen to nothing!
You betrayed the code!

322
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,345
Ravagers don't deal in kids.

323
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:38,432
I told you before!
I didn't know what was going on!

324
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,101
You didn't know because you didn't
want to know because it made you rich.

325
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:45,606
I demand a seat at the table!
I wear these flames, same as you.

326
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:47,858
You may dress like us...

327
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:50,527
but you'll never hear the Horns
of Freedom when you die, Yondu.

328
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:52,529
And the Colors of Ogord...

329
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:56,116
will never flash over your grave.

330
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:58,702
If you think...

331
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:03,040
I take pleasure in exiling you...

332
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,543
you're wrong.

333
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:10,631
You broke all our hearts.

334
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:27,564
Pathetic.

335
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:30,734
First, Quill betrays us...

336
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:34,154
and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.

337
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:37,449
We followed him
because he was the one...

338
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:40,118
who wasn't afraid
to do what needed to be done.

339
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:42,621
Seems he's goin' soft.

340
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,582
If he's so soft,
why are you whispering?

341
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,001
You know I'm right, Kraglin.

342
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:52,589
You best be very careful
what you say about our captain.

343
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:54,258
Who the hell is that?

344
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:36,049
Yondu Udonta...

345
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:38,886
I have a proposition for you.

346
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:41,513
I hired Yondu to pick you up...

347
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,724
when your mother passed away.

348
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:45,726
But instead of returning you...

349
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:47,644
Yondu kept you.

350
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:50,522
I have no clue as to why.

351
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:52,983
Well, I'll tell you why.

352
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,194
Because I was a
skinny little kid who

353
00:28:55,277 --> 00:28:56,320
could squeeze into
places adults couldn't.

354
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:57,821
It made it easier for thievin'.

355
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:01,325
Well, I've been trying to track you down
ever since.

356
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,452
I thought Yondu was your father.

357
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:05,662
What? We've been together
this whole time...

358
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:08,624
and you thought Yondu
was my actual blood relative?

359
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,000
You look exactly alike.

360
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:11,835
One's blue!

361
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:15,130
No, he's not my father!

362
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:17,716
Yondu was the guy who abducted me...

363
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:19,676
kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight...

364
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:21,887
and kept me in terror by
threatening to eat me.

365
00:29:22,054 --> 00:29:23,347
-Eat you?
-Yeah.

366
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:25,641
That son of a bitch.

367
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,184
How'd you locate us now?

368
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:30,896
Even where I reside,
out past the edge of what's known...

369
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:33,565
we've heard tell about the man
they call Star-Lord.

370
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:36,026
What say we head out there right now?

371
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:38,403
Your associates are welcome.
Even that triangle-faced monkey there.

372
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:40,906
I promise you...

373
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,492
it's unlike any other place
you've ever seen.

374
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:45,369
And there...

375
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:49,665
I can explain
your very special heritage.

376
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:52,709
Finally get to be...

377
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:55,546
the father I've always wanted to be.

378
00:29:57,047 --> 00:29:58,549
Excuse me.

379
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:00,384
I've gotta take a whiz.

380
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:08,392
I'm not buying it.

381
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:12,229
Let's go take a walk.

382
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:20,445
I am Mantis.

383
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:25,742
What are you doing?

384
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:27,286
Smiling.

385
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,622
I hear it is the thing to do
to make people like you.

386
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:33,750
Not if you do it like that.

387
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:38,046
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.

388
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:42,926
I do not understand
the intricacies of social interaction.

389
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:48,891
Can I pet your puppy?
It is adorable.

390
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:52,769
Yes.

391
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:05,782
That is called a practical joke!

392
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:11,079
I liked it very much!

393
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:12,915
I just made it up!

394
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:16,793
Give me a break!

395
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:19,963
After all this time, you're gonna
show up, and all of a sudden...

396
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,965
-you wanna be my dad?
-I hear you.

397
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:24,134
And by the way, this could be a trap.

398
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:25,844
The Kree purists, the Ravagers...

399
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,679
-they all want us dead.
-I know, but...

400
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:28,805
But what?

401
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:31,433
What was that story you told me
about Zardu Hasselfrau?

402
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,518
Who?

403
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:33,977
He owned a magic boat?

404
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:37,147
David Hasselhoff?

405
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:38,190
Right.

406
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:40,442
Not a magic boat. A talking car.

407
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:41,652
Why did he talk again?

408
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:45,280
To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.

409
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:47,991
As a child, you would carry his picture
in your pocket...

410
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:49,868
and you would tell
all the other children...

411
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:52,162
that he was your father,
but that he was out of town.

412
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:54,873
Shooting Knight Rider
or touring with his band in Germany.

413
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,376
I told you that when I was drunk.
Why are you bringing that up now?

414
00:31:57,543 --> 00:31:58,544
I love that story.

415
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,671
I hate that story.

416
00:32:00,838 --> 00:32:02,381
It's so sad!

417
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:07,553
As a kid, I used to see all the other kids
off playing catch with their dad.

418
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:10,389
And I wanted that,
more than anything in the world!

419
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:12,850
That's my point, Peter.

420
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:16,562
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?

421
00:32:19,982 --> 00:32:21,525
If he ends up being evil...

422
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:24,528
we will just kill him.

423
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:34,079
You're leaving me with that fox?

424
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:35,414
He's not a fox.

425
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:37,583
Shoot her
if she does anything suspicious.

426
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:41,044
-Or if you feel like it.
-Okay.

427
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:44,590
It'll be just a couple of days.

428
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:47,551
We'll be back before Rocket's finished
fixing the ship.

429
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:52,681
What if the Sovereign come?

430
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:54,892
There's no way for them to know
we're here. Let's go.

431
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,685
I'm uncertain about parting ways.

432
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:58,395
God, you're like an old woman.

433
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:00,272
Because I'm wise?

434
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:03,192
Why do you have so much luggage?

435
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:05,527
I don't want Groot playing
with my things.

436
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:11,241
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick
as you, orphan boy.

437
00:33:13,243 --> 00:33:17,080
What is your goal here?
To get everybody to hate you?

438
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:19,917
Because it's working.

439
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:28,592
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again

440
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:34,765
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

441
00:33:34,932 --> 00:33:37,935
And if you don't love me now

442
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:41,230
You will never love me again

443
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:45,275
I can still hear you saying

444
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:47,486
You would never break the chain

445
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:50,781
And if you don't love me now

446
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:53,659
You will never love me again

447
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:56,787
I can still hear you saying

448
00:33:56,954 --> 00:34:00,499
You would never break the chain

449
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:09,299
Hey, can I ask you a personal question?

450
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:13,637
No one has ever asked me
a personal question.

451
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:15,514
Your antennae, what are they for?

452
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:17,139
Their purpose?

453
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,141
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.

454
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:21,520
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!

455
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:23,563
I say...

456
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,065
if you are about to go through
a doorway that is too low...

457
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:28,985
your antennae will feel this,
and keep you from being decapitated.

458
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:31,321
Right. And if it's anything
other than...

459
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:34,908
you specifically not being decapitated
by a doorway, I win.

460
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:37,578
They are not for feeling doorways.

461
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:40,539
I think...

462
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:43,500
they have something
to do with my empathic abilities.

463
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,002
What are those?

464
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:48,672
If I touch someone,
I can feel their feelings.

465
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,425
-You read minds?
-No.

466
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:53,886
Telepaths know thoughts.

467
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:56,554
Empaths feel feelings.

468
00:34:57,848 --> 00:34:58,849
Emotions.

469
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:02,519
May I?

470
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:05,105
All right.

471
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:15,866
You feel love.

472
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:20,412
Yeah. I guess I feel a general,
unselfish love for just about everybody.

473
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:21,705
No!

474
00:35:21,872 --> 00:35:23,874
Romantic, sexual love.

475
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:25,375
No, I don't.

476
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:27,211
-For her!
-No!

477
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:31,757
Okay.

478
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:36,887
She just told everyone your deepest,
darkest secret!

479
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:39,389
Dude, I think
you're overreacting a little bit!

480
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:40,933
You must be so embarrassed!

481
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,647
Do me! Do me!

482
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:54,905
I have never felt such humor!

483
00:35:58,408 --> 00:36:00,452
So unbelievably uncool.

484
00:36:01,787 --> 00:36:02,996
Quill.

485
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:09,586
Touch me, and the only thing
you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.

486
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:18,637
I can also alter emotions
to some extent.

487
00:36:18,804 --> 00:36:19,763
Yeah, like what?

488
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:23,684
If I touch someone who is sad...

489
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:26,603
I can ease them into contentment
for a short while.

490
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:30,607
I can make a stubborn
person compliant.

491
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:33,777
But I mostly use it
to help my master sleep.

492
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:37,781
He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.

493
00:36:39,992 --> 00:36:41,201
Do one of those on me.

494
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:47,457
Sleep.

495
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:41,762
I love this song.

496
00:38:13,544 --> 00:38:14,878
There!

497
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:37,711
Ain't so tough now without
all your toys...

498
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:38,879
are you?

499
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:43,133
Move!

500
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,068
Crap.

501
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:07,991
Hey there, rat!

502
00:40:08,158 --> 00:40:10,619
How's it going, you blue idiot?

503
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:13,080
Not so bad.

504
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:15,624
We got ourselves a pretty good
little gig here.

505
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:18,585
This golden gal with
quite a high opinion of herself...

506
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:22,673
has offered us a large sum to deliver
you and your pals over to her...

507
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,467
because she wants to kill y'all.

508
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:26,844
Your friend...

509
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,637
There's too many of them.

510
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:32,015
He needs my help.
If you care about him...

511
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:34,935
you need to get me out of these bonds.

512
00:40:35,477 --> 00:40:37,354
They are going to kill him!

513
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:39,690
I tell you, it was pretty easy
to find you.

514
00:40:39,857 --> 00:40:41,817
I put a tracer
on your ship back there...

515
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,360
during the war over Xandar.

516
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:46,196
Give me your word
you won't hurt Groot...

517
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:48,365
and I'll tell you
where the batteries are.

518
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:51,535
Lucky for you, my word
don't mean squat.

519
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:54,288
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.

520
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:55,789
Otherwise, you'd what?

521
00:40:56,957 --> 00:40:58,333
We'll take them batteries.

522
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,045
They're worth what?
A quarter mill on the open market?

523
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:04,548
That Priestess offered us a million.

524
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:07,384
A quarter is only one third of that!

525
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:08,719
A quarter ain't a third.

526
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:10,721
A quarter is 25.

527
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:11,805
No.

528
00:41:11,972 --> 00:41:14,391
We can't even buy a pair of boots
with 25 units.

529
00:41:14,558 --> 00:41:15,392
Enough!

530
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:20,522
The point is, we ain't stupid enough
to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

531
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:23,400
The whole dang Nova Corps
would be on us.

532
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:25,485
That ain't right!

533
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:29,323
I just gotta say it
this one time, Captain.

534
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:31,742
No matter how many times
Quill betrays you...

535
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:34,745
you protect him
like none of the rest of us much matter!

536
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:35,913
Yeah!

537
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,581
I'm the one what sticks up for you!

538
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:38,749
Take it easy, Kraglin.

539
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:41,418
Damn straight, lad. He's gone soft.

540
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:44,713
Suppose it's time for a change
in leadership.

541
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:51,970
Put your damn guns down!

542
00:41:52,137 --> 00:41:53,388
Whoa! Whoa!

543
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:57,017
There must be some kind of
peaceful resolution to this, fellas.

544
00:41:57,184 --> 00:42:00,062
Or even a violent one
where I'm standing over there.

545
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:20,791
Well, hello, boys.

546
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:28,173
It's not ripe.

547
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:16,221
Welcome, everyone, to my world.

548
00:43:16,388 --> 00:43:18,807
Wow. You have your own planet?

549
00:43:18,974 --> 00:43:22,769
Come on.
No larger than your Earth's Moon.

550
00:43:22,978 --> 00:43:24,479
Humility.

551
00:43:24,646 --> 00:43:26,023
I like it.

552
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:28,859
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.

553
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:15,322
You own a planet and can destroy
two dozen spaceships without a suit.

554
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:17,783
What are you exactly?

555
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:22,287
I'm what's called
a Celestial, sweetheart.

556
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:26,124
A Celestial, like a god?

557
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:29,711
Small "g," son.

558
00:44:29,878 --> 00:44:32,714
At least on the days
I'm feeling humble as Drax.

559
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:45,185
Whoa!

560
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:50,524
I don't know where I came from exactly.

561
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:52,693
First thing I remember is flickering...

562
00:44:53,277 --> 00:44:55,153
adrift in the cosmos utterly...

563
00:44:56,113 --> 00:44:58,657
and entirely alone.

564
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:01,618
Over millions of years...

565
00:45:01,785 --> 00:45:05,330
I learned to control the molecules
around me.

566
00:45:05,664 --> 00:45:08,834
I grew smarter and stronger.

567
00:45:10,794 --> 00:45:13,755
And I continued building from there...

568
00:45:13,922 --> 00:45:16,008
layer by layer...

569
00:45:16,175 --> 00:45:18,802
the very planet you walk on now.

570
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:20,262
Whoa.

571
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:22,097
But I wanted more.

572
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:24,892
I desired...

573
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:26,560
meaning.

574
00:45:27,728 --> 00:45:31,690
"There must be some life out there
in the universe...

575
00:45:31,857 --> 00:45:34,651
"besides just me," I thought.

576
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:38,822
And so, I set myself the task
of finding it.

577
00:45:39,156 --> 00:45:40,616
I created...

578
00:45:40,782 --> 00:45:44,411
what I imagined biological life
to be like...

579
00:45:44,578 --> 00:45:48,332
down to the most minute detail.

580
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:50,751
Did you make a penis?

581
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:52,169
Dude!

582
00:45:52,336 --> 00:45:53,504
What is wrong with you?

583
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:56,757
If he is a planet, how could he
make a baby with your mother?

584
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:57,925
He would smush her!

585
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:02,304
I don't need to hear how my parents...

586
00:46:03,514 --> 00:46:04,515
Why?

587
00:46:05,307 --> 00:46:07,559
My father would tell the
story of impregnating

588
00:46:07,643 --> 00:46:09,019
my mother every winter solstice.

589
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:10,479
That's disgusting.

590
00:46:10,646 --> 00:46:12,105
It was beautiful.

591
00:46:13,357 --> 00:46:14,900
You Earthers have hang-ups.

592
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:17,569
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.

593
00:46:18,403 --> 00:46:19,404
Thank you!

594
00:46:19,571 --> 00:46:20,739
It's not half bad.

595
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:26,078
I've also got pain receptors,
and a digestive system...

596
00:46:26,245 --> 00:46:28,038
and all the accompanying junk.

597
00:46:28,497 --> 00:46:33,126
I wanted to experience
what it truly meant to be human...

598
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:36,296
as I set out amongst the stars...

599
00:46:36,964 --> 00:46:39,132
until I found...

600
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:41,009
what I sought.

601
00:46:42,553 --> 00:46:43,720
Life.

602
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:47,891
I was not alone in the universe
after all.

603
00:46:54,606 --> 00:46:56,441
When did you meet my mother?

604
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:02,364
Not long after.

605
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:12,708
It was with Meredith
that I first experienced love.

606
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:19,756
I called her my river lily.

607
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:26,638
And from that love, Peter...

608
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:31,393
you.

609
00:47:38,692 --> 00:47:42,196
I have searched for you for so long.

610
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,490
And when I heard of a man from Earth...

611
00:47:45,657 --> 00:47:49,411
who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...

612
00:47:51,163 --> 00:47:54,208
I knew you must be the son
of the woman I loved.

613
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:58,128
If you loved her, why did you leave her?

614
00:48:19,191 --> 00:48:21,068
This is mutiny!

615
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,154
This is mutiny!

616
00:48:24,321 --> 00:48:26,907
This is mutiny!

617
00:48:38,669 --> 00:48:40,087
You're scum!

618
00:49:15,831 --> 00:49:16,707
Captain!

619
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:19,376
Help me! Please!

620
00:49:19,543 --> 00:49:21,128
Captain!

621
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:26,133
You're the one what killed those men...

622
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:28,510
by leading them down the wrong path.

623
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:31,096
Because you're weak.

624
00:49:33,473 --> 00:49:35,058
And stupid!

625
00:49:37,102 --> 00:49:39,062
It's time for the Ravagers...

626
00:49:39,229 --> 00:49:43,066
to rise once again to glory
with a new captain...

627
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:45,527
Taserface!

628
00:49:53,202 --> 00:49:56,830
I'm sorry. Your name is...

629
00:49:56,997 --> 00:49:58,707
It's Taserface?

630
00:49:59,124 --> 00:50:00,417
That's right.

631
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:03,170
Do you shoot tasers out of your face?

632
00:50:03,795 --> 00:50:05,672
It's metaphorical!

633
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:06,673
Yeah!

634
00:50:10,344 --> 00:50:11,261
For what?

635
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:16,225
For it is a name what strikes fear...

636
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:19,186
into the hearts of anyone what hears it.

637
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:23,106
Okay.

638
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:24,900
Okay...

639
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:26,318
whatever you say.

640
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:28,070
You shut up.

641
00:50:28,237 --> 00:50:29,530
You're next.

642
00:50:29,821 --> 00:50:33,909
Udonta, I have waited
a long time to do...

643
00:50:34,076 --> 00:50:34,910
What?

644
00:50:36,203 --> 00:50:39,122
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!

645
00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:42,292
I just keep imagining you
waking up in the morning, sir...

646
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:45,462
looking in the mirror and then
in all seriousness saying to yourself...

647
00:50:45,629 --> 00:50:49,341
"You know what would be
a really kick-ass name? Taserface!"

648
00:50:51,635 --> 00:50:54,346
That's how I hear you in my head!

649
00:50:55,138 --> 00:50:57,307
What was your second choice?

650
00:50:57,474 --> 00:50:58,517
Scrotum Hat?

651
00:51:01,645 --> 00:51:04,231
New plan. We're killing you first.

652
00:51:05,649 --> 00:51:08,735
Well, dying is certainly better
than having to live an entire life...

653
00:51:08,902 --> 00:51:12,823
as a moronic shitbag who thinks
Taserface is a cool name.

654
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:15,909
That's enough killing for today.

655
00:51:19,872 --> 00:51:21,498
She's the daughter of Thanos.

656
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:25,919
I thought you were the biggest sadist
in the galaxy.

657
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:28,922
That was when Daddy
was paying my bills.

658
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:32,676
The Priestess wants to
kill the fox herself.

659
00:51:32,843 --> 00:51:35,846
And he has bounties on his head
in at least 12 Kree provinces.

660
00:51:37,514 --> 00:51:38,891
I assure you...

661
00:51:39,057 --> 00:51:41,852
I am not as easy a mark as an old man
without his magic stick...

662
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:43,896
or a talking woodland beast.

663
00:51:45,272 --> 00:51:47,191
I want 10% of the take...

664
00:51:48,859 --> 00:51:50,569
and a couple more things.

665
00:51:52,404 --> 00:51:54,031
We got a whole box of hands...

666
00:51:54,198 --> 00:51:56,033
-if that one don't work out.
-It is fine.

667
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,411
You think them Kree
is gonna execute the captain?

668
00:51:59,578 --> 00:52:03,790
The Kree consider themselves merciful.
It will be painless.

669
00:52:03,957 --> 00:52:07,377
Well, here it is.
It's the best ship we got.

670
00:52:07,544 --> 00:52:09,213
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.

671
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:11,715
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.

672
00:52:11,882 --> 00:52:14,051
What are you gonna
do with your share?

673
00:52:14,927 --> 00:52:15,802
As a child, my father would have

674
00:52:15,886 --> 00:52:19,139
Gamora and me battle
one another in training.

675
00:52:19,932 --> 00:52:22,226
Every time my sister prevailed...

676
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:25,729
my father would replace a piece of me
with machinery...

677
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:28,565
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.

678
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:31,485
But she won...

679
00:52:31,652 --> 00:52:36,490
again and again, and again,
never once refraining.

680
00:52:38,075 --> 00:52:40,452
So after I murder my sister...

681
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:43,830
I will buy a warship with
every conceivable instrument of death.

682
00:52:43,997 --> 00:52:47,626
I will hunt my father like a dog,
and I will tear him apart slowly...

683
00:52:47,793 --> 00:52:49,253
piece by piece...

684
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:52,798
until he knows some semblance
of the profound and unceasing pain...

685
00:52:52,965 --> 00:52:56,134
I know every single day.

686
00:52:57,928 --> 00:52:59,263
Yeah.

687
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:01,598
I was talking about,
like, a pretty necklace.

688
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:04,268
Or a nice hat.

689
00:53:04,434 --> 00:53:07,271
Something to make the other girls go,
"Ooh, that's nice!"

690
00:53:11,108 --> 00:53:14,278
Anyways, happy trails.

691
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:25,664
My mother told everyone
my father was from the stars.

692
00:53:27,332 --> 00:53:29,835
She had brain cancer, so
everyone  thought she was delusional.

693
00:53:30,002 --> 00:53:31,003
Peter...

694
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:32,963
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this,
I really would.

695
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:34,464
But you left...

696
00:53:34,631 --> 00:53:37,509
the most wonderful woman ever...

697
00:53:37,676 --> 00:53:39,136
to die alone.

698
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:42,723
I didn't want to
leave your mother, Peter.

699
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:45,058
If I don't return regularly
to my planet...

700
00:53:45,225 --> 00:53:46,643
and the light within it...

701
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:48,312
this form will wither and perish.

702
00:53:48,478 --> 00:53:50,522
So why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?

703
00:53:50,689 --> 00:53:52,649
A criminal, of all people,
to come and fetch me?

704
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:54,902
I loved your mother, Peter!

705
00:53:55,068 --> 00:53:57,487
I couldn't stand to set foot
on an Earth...

706
00:53:57,654 --> 00:54:00,490
where she wasn't living!
You can't imagine what that's like!

707
00:54:00,657 --> 00:54:03,076
I know exactly what that feels like!

708
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:04,995
I had to watch her die!

709
00:54:09,374 --> 00:54:13,504
Over the millions and millions of years
of my existence...

710
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:16,173
I've made many mistakes, Peter.

711
00:54:17,007 --> 00:54:19,218
But you're not one of them.

712
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:24,765
Please give me the chance to be
the father she would want me to be.

713
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:34,775
There's so much that I need to
teach you about this planet...

714
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:36,693
and the light within.

715
00:54:37,027 --> 00:54:40,197
They are a part of you, Peter.

716
00:54:41,073 --> 00:54:42,741
What do you mean?

717
00:54:43,534 --> 00:54:45,452
Give me your hands, son.

718
00:54:46,411 --> 00:54:47,538
Here.

719
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:50,290
Hold them like that.

720
00:54:56,213 --> 00:54:59,049
Now, close your eyes and concentrate.

721
00:55:00,217 --> 00:55:03,262
Take your brain
to the center of this planet.

722
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:08,976
Yes!

723
00:55:09,142 --> 00:55:10,060
Yes!

724
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:12,062
Whoa!

725
00:55:12,229 --> 00:55:13,647
Yes! It's okay.

726
00:55:13,814 --> 00:55:14,898
Just relax. Concentrate.

727
00:55:15,065 --> 00:55:17,234
You can do it. Bring it back.

728
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:18,819
Yes!

729
00:55:20,445 --> 00:55:23,240
Yes, now shape it.

730
00:55:23,574 --> 00:55:25,284
Feel that energy.

731
00:55:29,454 --> 00:55:30,455
Yes.

732
00:55:34,751 --> 00:55:36,128
You're home.

733
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:39,756
Peter...

734
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:17,211
How did you get to this weird,
dumb planet?

735
00:56:17,794 --> 00:56:20,672
Ego found me in my larva state.

736
00:56:20,839 --> 00:56:22,341
Orphaned on my homeworld.

737
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,969
He raised me by hand,
and kept me as his own.

738
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:28,805
So you're a pet?

739
00:56:29,973 --> 00:56:31,308
I suppose.

740
00:56:32,809 --> 00:56:35,187
People usually want cute pets.

741
00:56:35,354 --> 00:56:37,648
Why would Ego want
such a hideous one?

742
00:56:37,814 --> 00:56:39,066
I am hideous?

743
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:41,485
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.

744
00:56:44,571 --> 00:56:45,739
But that's a good thing.

745
00:56:47,241 --> 00:56:48,825
When you're ugly,
and someone loves you...

746
00:56:48,992 --> 00:56:51,495
you know they love you
for who you are.

747
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:55,249
Beautiful people never know
who to trust.

748
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:59,086
Well, then I'm certainly grateful
to be ugly.

749
00:57:00,546 --> 00:57:03,674
Those pools, they remind me of a time...

750
00:57:03,841 --> 00:57:07,427
when I took my daughter
to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.

751
00:57:08,595 --> 00:57:09,930
She was like you.

752
00:57:10,347 --> 00:57:11,849
Disgusting?

753
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:14,017
Innocent.

754
00:57:47,301 --> 00:57:48,302
Drax?

755
00:57:49,928 --> 00:57:51,597
There's something I must tell you.

756
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,064
What's going on?

757
00:58:01,231 --> 00:58:03,150
This gross bug lady is my new friend.

758
00:58:03,317 --> 00:58:06,778
I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.

759
00:58:07,112 --> 00:58:08,739
You're not ugly. Drax!

760
00:58:08,906 --> 00:58:10,115
What are you talking about?

761
00:58:10,282 --> 00:58:11,450
Mantis...

762
00:58:11,909 --> 00:58:14,077
can you show us
where we'll be staying?

763
00:58:14,578 --> 00:58:16,330
Why are there no other beings
on this planet?

764
00:58:16,496 --> 00:58:18,582
The planet is Ego.

765
00:58:18,749 --> 00:58:21,001
A dog would not invite a flea
to live on his back.

766
00:58:21,752 --> 00:58:23,003
And you're not a flea?

767
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:25,464
I'm a flea with a purpose.

768
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:27,758
I help him sleep.

769
00:58:28,926 --> 00:58:32,095
What were you about to say to Drax
before I walked out?

770
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,268
Nothing.

771
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:41,021
Your quarters are this way.

772
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:52,157
We deliver you to the Kree
in the morning.

773
00:58:54,451 --> 00:58:57,621
Neither one of you will last
much longer after that.

774
00:58:58,247 --> 00:59:00,290
Okay, Taserface.

775
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:03,001
Hey, tell the other guys we said...

776
00:59:03,168 --> 00:59:04,628
"Hi," Taserface!

777
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,302
What about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?

778
00:59:12,469 --> 00:59:13,971
No, Gef.

779
00:59:14,137 --> 00:59:15,848
It's too adorable to kill.

780
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:17,933
Take it to the tailor.

781
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:22,813
No offense, but your employees
are a bunch of jerks.

782
00:59:25,148 --> 00:59:29,945
I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years
when Stakar freed me.

783
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:35,158
He offered me a place
with the Ravagers.

784
00:59:35,325 --> 00:59:39,746
He said all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.

785
00:59:39,913 --> 00:59:41,665
But I was young...

786
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:46,128
and greedy, and stupid.

787
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:49,173
Like you stealing those batteries.

788
00:59:49,339 --> 00:59:50,924
That was mostly Drax.

789
00:59:52,342 --> 00:59:55,846
Me and Stakar and the other captains...

790
00:59:56,847 --> 00:59:59,183
we weren't so different from you
and your friends.

791
01:00:00,142 --> 01:00:02,019
The only family I ever had.

792
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:05,147
When I broke the code...

793
01:00:07,357 --> 01:00:09,026
they exiled me.

794
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,862
This is what I deserve.

795
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:13,697
Slow down, drama queen.

796
01:00:13,864 --> 01:00:15,532
You might deserve this,
but I don't.

797
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:17,492
We gotta get outta here.

798
01:00:18,952 --> 01:00:20,162
Where's Quill?

799
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:21,872
He went off with his old man.

800
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:25,167
-Ego?
-Yeah.

801
01:00:25,334 --> 01:00:27,419
It's a day for dumbass names.

802
01:00:30,464 --> 01:00:32,883
You're smiling.
And for a second, I got a warm feeling.

803
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:35,719
But then it was ruined
by those disgusting-ass teeth.

804
01:00:35,886 --> 01:00:38,263
You like a professional
asshole or what?

805
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:39,389
Pretty much a pro.

806
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:42,392
Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego
like you promised?

807
01:00:42,935 --> 01:00:44,645
He was skinny.

808
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:49,233
Could fit into places we couldn't.
Good for thievin'.

809
01:00:54,154 --> 01:00:57,366
I got an idea on how to get outta here.

810
01:00:58,242 --> 01:01:00,744
But we're gonna need your little friend.

811
01:01:01,912 --> 01:01:04,373
Mascot, mascot, mascot...

812
01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:17,719
Little fellow's all worked up!
He needs a drink!

813
01:01:23,809 --> 01:01:26,520
Look how cute it is
when it's all riled up.

814
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:28,564
He's goddang precious!

815
01:01:42,619 --> 01:01:44,329
Hey, twig!

816
01:01:44,663 --> 01:01:46,123
Come here.

817
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:47,749
Come on.

818
01:01:54,339 --> 01:01:55,257
Aw, man...

819
01:01:55,424 --> 01:01:57,009
what did they do to you?

820
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:02,556
Hey, you wanna help us get outta here?

821
01:02:03,348 --> 01:02:06,518
There's something I need you to get,
and bring back to me.

822
01:02:06,685 --> 01:02:10,814
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin...

823
01:02:10,981 --> 01:02:12,608
the thing I wore on my head.

824
01:02:13,275 --> 01:02:17,362
There's a drawer next to the bunk.
It's in that. It's red.

825
01:02:17,529 --> 01:02:18,822
You got it?

826
01:02:52,481 --> 01:02:54,024
That's my underwears.

827
01:02:54,191 --> 01:02:56,193
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know
what you were talkin' about.

828
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,487
You have to explain it more careful.

829
01:02:59,988 --> 01:03:03,408
It's a prototype fin.

830
01:03:08,872 --> 01:03:11,625
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.

831
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:13,460
You explain it this time.

832
01:03:14,628 --> 01:03:16,171
All right.

833
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,757
That's Vorker's eye.

834
01:03:18,924 --> 01:03:20,926
He takes it out when he sleeps.

835
01:03:21,093 --> 01:03:22,427
Go. Look again.

836
01:03:22,594 --> 01:03:24,012
But leave the eye here.

837
01:03:24,638 --> 01:03:25,472
Why?

838
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:27,015
He's gonna wake up tomorrow...

839
01:03:27,182 --> 01:03:29,518
and he's not gonna know...

840
01:03:29,685 --> 01:03:31,520
where his eye is!

841
01:03:38,151 --> 01:03:39,736
That's a desk.

842
01:03:39,903 --> 01:03:42,698
We told you it was this big.

843
01:03:48,579 --> 01:03:50,747
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere...

844
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:53,625
with a bunch of severed human toes.

845
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:57,504
Okay. Then let's just agree
to never discuss this.

846
01:04:00,674 --> 01:04:04,303
The drawer you wanna open
has this symbol on it.

847
01:04:04,469 --> 01:04:05,846
Okay?

848
01:04:14,396 --> 01:04:16,273
What? No!

849
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,649
He thinks you want him
to wear it as a hat.

850
01:04:17,816 --> 01:04:19,026
That's not what I said!

851
01:04:19,193 --> 01:04:21,320
-I am Groot.
-He's relieved you don't want him to.

852
01:04:21,486 --> 01:04:22,946
-I am Groot.
-He hates hats.

853
01:04:23,113 --> 01:04:23,906
I am Groot.

854
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:25,157
On anyone, not just himself.

855
01:04:25,324 --> 01:04:26,158
I am Groot.

856
01:04:26,325 --> 01:04:28,160
One minute you think someone
has a weird-shaped head...

857
01:04:28,327 --> 01:04:30,746
the next minute it's just because
you realize part of that head is the hat.

858
01:04:31,205 --> 01:04:32,581
That's why you don't like hats?

859
01:04:33,665 --> 01:04:36,043
This is an important conversation
right now?

860
01:05:12,788 --> 01:05:13,789
That ain't it.

861
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:25,133
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

862
01:05:28,095 --> 01:05:29,930
They killed all my friends.

863
01:05:33,976 --> 01:05:36,562
Get the third quadrant ready
for release.

864
01:05:43,277 --> 01:05:44,111
One more thing.

865
01:05:46,029 --> 01:05:48,448
You got any clones of Quill's old music
on the ship?

866
01:06:39,249 --> 01:06:40,250
He's got it!

867
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:41,919
Yondu's got the fin!

868
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:43,003
Go!

869
01:07:24,586 --> 01:07:25,420
Down there!

870
01:09:24,163 --> 01:09:25,624
You maniac.

871
01:09:27,542 --> 01:09:29,837
The whole ship's gonna blow.

872
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,265
Not the whole ship.

873
01:09:58,323 --> 01:09:59,366
Who is this?

874
01:09:59,533 --> 01:10:03,829
I am sending you the coordinates
for Yondu's ship.

875
01:10:04,288 --> 01:10:06,081
-Release the quadrant!
-Aye, Captain!

876
01:10:06,248 --> 01:10:08,750
I only ask one thing.

877
01:10:09,251 --> 01:10:10,878
That your High Priestess...

878
01:10:11,044 --> 01:10:14,631
tell him the name of the man
what sealed his fate.

879
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:17,634
Taserface!

880
01:10:41,074 --> 01:10:42,326
Where to, Captain?

881
01:10:42,492 --> 01:10:43,493
Ego.

882
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,330
No, boy!

883
01:10:54,046 --> 01:10:58,592
It ain't healthy for a mammalian body
to hop more than 50 jumps at a time.

884
01:10:58,759 --> 01:10:59,718
I know that.

885
01:10:59,885 --> 01:11:02,387
We are about to do 700!

886
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:18,362
So I guess this could all
be mine someday.

887
01:11:19,613 --> 01:11:22,241
Rocket? Rocket, are you there?

888
01:11:29,373 --> 01:11:31,083
What are you doing, Peter?

889
01:11:33,377 --> 01:11:34,753
Dance with me.

890
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,380
I'm not going to dance with you.

891
01:11:36,547 --> 01:11:38,298
This is Sam Cooke...

892
01:11:38,841 --> 01:11:42,010
one of the greatest Earth singers
of all time.

893
01:12:11,164 --> 01:12:13,166
Drax thinks you're not a dancer.

894
01:12:14,293 --> 01:12:16,837
If you ever tell anyone about this...

895
01:12:17,004 --> 01:12:18,422
I will kill you.

896
01:12:19,173 --> 01:12:23,051
When are we gonna do something
about this unspoken thing between us?

897
01:12:23,677 --> 01:12:25,095
What unspoken thing?

898
01:12:26,555 --> 01:12:28,223
This...

899
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:31,185
Cheers, Sam and Diane...

900
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:33,937
a guy and a girl on a TV show
who dig each other...

901
01:12:34,104 --> 01:12:36,648
but never say it because if they do,
the ratings would go down...

902
01:12:36,815 --> 01:12:37,858
sort of thing.

903
01:12:38,025 --> 01:12:39,484
There's no unspoken thing.

904
01:12:41,403 --> 01:12:44,698
Well, it's a catch-22, because if you
said it, then it would be spoken...

905
01:12:44,865 --> 01:12:47,618
and you would be a liar.
So, by not saying it...

906
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:51,914
you are telling the truth,
and admitting that there is.

907
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,999
No, that's not what I...

908
01:12:56,335 --> 01:13:00,380
What we should be discussing right
now is something about this place.

909
01:13:00,547 --> 01:13:02,341
It doesn't feel right.

910
01:13:02,799 --> 01:13:04,968
What are you talking about?

911
01:13:05,135 --> 01:13:06,386
You're the one who wanted me
to come here!

912
01:13:06,553 --> 01:13:07,804
That girl Mantis...

913
01:13:07,971 --> 01:13:09,139
she's afraid of something.

914
01:13:09,473 --> 01:13:11,642
Why are you trying to take this
away from me?

915
01:13:11,808 --> 01:13:12,893
I'm not trying...

916
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:14,978
He's my father. He's blood.

917
01:13:15,145 --> 01:13:16,647
You have blood on Earth
and you never wanted to return there.

918
01:13:16,813 --> 01:13:19,066
Again, you made me come here!

919
01:13:19,233 --> 01:13:21,151
And Earth is the place
where my mother died in front of me.

920
01:13:21,318 --> 01:13:24,029
No, it's because that place is real,
and this is a fantasy.

921
01:13:24,196 --> 01:13:26,865
This is real! I'm only half human,
remember?

922
01:13:27,032 --> 01:13:28,492
That's the half I'm worried about.

923
01:13:29,034 --> 01:13:30,702
I get it. You're jealous...

924
01:13:30,869 --> 01:13:33,205
because I'm part-god,
and you like when I'm the weak one.

925
01:13:33,372 --> 01:13:35,999
You were insufferable to begin with.

926
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:37,209
I haven't been able to reach Rocket.

927
01:13:37,376 --> 01:13:38,836
I'm gonna go outside,
and I'm gonna try and get a signal.

928
01:13:39,002 --> 01:13:41,839
You know what?
This is not Cheers after all!

929
01:13:42,005 --> 01:13:44,842
This is whatever the show is where
one person is willing...

930
01:13:45,008 --> 01:13:46,593
to open themselves up
to new possibility,

931
01:13:46,677 --> 01:13:48,512
and the other person is a jerk...

932
01:13:48,595 --> 01:13:52,266
who doesn't trust anybody!
It's a show that doesn't exist.

933
01:13:52,432 --> 01:13:53,934
That's why it would get zero ratings!

934
01:13:54,351 --> 01:13:56,353
I don't know what Cheers is!

935
01:13:56,687 --> 01:13:59,731
I finally found my family.
Don't you understand that?

936
01:14:00,899 --> 01:14:02,526
I thought you already had.

937
01:14:32,055 --> 01:14:33,265
Damn it.

938
01:15:06,423 --> 01:15:07,508
Psychopath!

939
01:17:17,888 --> 01:17:19,723
Are you kidding me?

940
01:17:46,124 --> 01:17:46,959
I win.

941
01:17:47,584 --> 01:17:49,795
I win. I bested you in combat.

942
01:17:49,962 --> 01:17:51,880
No. I saved your life.

943
01:17:52,047 --> 01:17:53,882
Well, you were stupid enough
to let me live.

944
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:55,050
You let me live!

945
01:17:55,217 --> 01:17:56,969
I don't need you always
trying to beat me!

946
01:17:57,135 --> 01:17:58,220
I'm not the one that just flew across

947
01:17:58,262 --> 01:17:59,888
the universe just
because I wanted to win.

948
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:01,473
Do not tell me what I want.

949
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,058
I don't need to tell you
what you want!

950
01:18:03,225 --> 01:18:04,226
It's obvious!

951
01:18:04,393 --> 01:18:07,479
You were the one who wanted to win.
And I just wanted a sister!

952
01:18:15,237 --> 01:18:16,780
You were all I had.

953
01:18:18,115 --> 01:18:20,951
But you were the one
who needed to win.

954
01:18:22,119 --> 01:18:24,329
Thanos pulled my eye from my head...

955
01:18:25,122 --> 01:18:27,124
and my brain from my skull...

956
01:18:28,292 --> 01:18:30,169
and my arm from my body...

957
01:18:31,962 --> 01:18:34,089
because of you.

958
01:18:54,943 --> 01:18:55,986
You all right, son?

959
01:18:59,323 --> 01:19:01,992
I saw your girl stomp off
a little earlier in quite a huff.

960
01:19:02,618 --> 01:19:03,952
Yeah.

961
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:05,829
It's fortuitous...

962
01:19:05,996 --> 01:19:07,247
you listening to this song.

963
01:19:07,414 --> 01:19:09,041
-You know...
-Brandy?

964
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:10,626
By Looking Glass?

965
01:19:12,377 --> 01:19:13,754
A favorite of your mom's.

966
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:16,173
Yeah, it was.

967
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:18,258
One of Earth's greatest
musical compositions.

968
01:19:18,425 --> 01:19:20,511
Perhaps its very greatest.

969
01:19:20,677 --> 01:19:21,678
Yes!

970
01:19:21,845 --> 01:19:25,015
Peter, you and I,
we're the sailor in that song.

971
01:19:27,226 --> 01:19:29,144
He came on a summer's day

972
01:19:29,478 --> 01:19:31,980
Bringing gifts from far away

973
01:19:34,024 --> 01:19:36,485
Like the child I put in your mother...

974
01:19:36,652 --> 01:19:38,695
or the freedom you brought Gamora.

975
01:19:40,781 --> 01:19:43,784
Brandy, you're a fine girl

976
01:19:43,951 --> 01:19:46,620
What a good wife you would be

977
01:19:47,704 --> 01:19:50,332
My life, my love

978
01:19:50,499 --> 01:19:53,794
My lady is the sea

979
01:19:53,961 --> 01:19:55,796
The sea calls the sailor back.

980
01:19:55,963 --> 01:19:58,549
He loves the girl,
but that's not his place.

981
01:19:59,299 --> 01:20:03,303
The sea calls upon him
as history calls upon great men.

982
01:20:04,471 --> 01:20:08,016
And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.

983
01:20:08,559 --> 01:20:10,686
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...

984
01:20:10,853 --> 01:20:11,979
No, Peter...

985
01:20:12,145 --> 01:20:14,147
death will remain a stranger
to both of us...

986
01:20:14,565 --> 01:20:16,733
as long as the light
burns within the planet.

987
01:20:17,693 --> 01:20:18,777
I'm immortal?

988
01:20:21,029 --> 01:20:22,030
Really?

989
01:20:22,197 --> 01:20:25,033
Yes! As long as the light exists.

990
01:20:26,076 --> 01:20:29,329
And I can use the light
to build cool things...

991
01:20:29,496 --> 01:20:31,790
like how you made this whole planet?

992
01:20:31,957 --> 01:20:34,334
It might take you
a few million years of practice...

993
01:20:34,501 --> 01:20:36,712
before you get really good at it.
But, yes!

994
01:20:36,879 --> 01:20:37,921
What!

995
01:20:38,213 --> 01:20:41,675
Get ready for an 800-foot statue
of Pac-Man with Skeletor...

996
01:20:41,842 --> 01:20:42,885
and Heather Locklear.

997
01:20:43,051 --> 01:20:44,178
You can do anything you want.

998
01:20:44,344 --> 01:20:45,679
I'm gonna make some weird shit.

999
01:20:45,846 --> 01:20:49,016
But you know, Peter,
it is a tremendous responsibility.

1000
01:20:49,183 --> 01:20:51,685
Only we can remake the universe.

1001
01:20:51,852 --> 01:20:54,313
Only we can take the bridle
of the cosmos...

1002
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:57,316
and lead it to where it needs to go.

1003
01:20:58,483 --> 01:20:59,526
How?

1004
01:21:09,995 --> 01:21:11,496
Come with me.

1005
01:21:21,381 --> 01:21:23,008
Drax, Drax. Drax!

1006
01:21:23,383 --> 01:21:25,052
Drax! We need to talk.

1007
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:28,972
I'm sorry.

1008
01:21:29,139 --> 01:21:31,308
But I like a woman
with some meat on her bones.

1009
01:21:31,475 --> 01:21:32,559
What?

1010
01:21:32,726 --> 01:21:35,979
I tried to let you down easily
by telling you I found you disgusting.

1011
01:21:36,146 --> 01:21:37,606
No, that's not what I...

1012
01:21:41,109 --> 01:21:42,528
What are you doing?

1013
01:21:43,111 --> 01:21:45,489
I'm imagining being with you physically.

1014
01:21:45,656 --> 01:21:46,949
Drax...

1015
01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:48,659
I don't like you like that.

1016
01:21:48,825 --> 01:21:50,786
I don't even like
the type of thing you are.

1017
01:21:51,286 --> 01:21:53,747
Hey! There's no need to get personal.

1018
01:21:53,914 --> 01:21:56,458
Listen! Ego's gotten exactly
what he wanted.

1019
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:58,418
I should have told you earlier.

1020
01:21:58,585 --> 01:22:01,713
I'm stupid. You are in danger.

1021
01:22:07,427 --> 01:22:08,428
What is that?

1022
01:22:11,932 --> 01:22:15,477
Now, you need to readjust the way
you process life.

1023
01:22:15,644 --> 01:22:18,730
Everything around us,
including the girl...

1024
01:22:18,897 --> 01:22:22,359
Everything is temporary.

1025
01:22:22,526 --> 01:22:25,445
We are forever.

1026
01:22:25,612 --> 01:22:26,947
Doesn't eternity get boring?

1027
01:22:27,114 --> 01:22:29,533
Not if you have a purpose, Peter...

1028
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,660
which is why you're here.

1029
01:22:31,827 --> 01:22:33,954
I told you how all those years ago...

1030
01:22:34,121 --> 01:22:38,250
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.

1031
01:22:38,417 --> 01:22:42,462
But what I did not tell you was how,
when I finally did find it...

1032
01:22:43,213 --> 01:22:44,506
it was all so...

1033
01:22:46,967 --> 01:22:48,802
disappointing.

1034
01:22:49,136 --> 01:22:52,639
And that is when I came...

1035
01:22:52,806 --> 01:22:56,518
to a profound realization.

1036
01:22:57,811 --> 01:23:01,940
My innate desire to seek out
other life...

1037
01:23:02,482 --> 01:23:06,653
was not so that I could
walk among that life.

1038
01:23:08,947 --> 01:23:10,115
Peter...

1039
01:23:11,074 --> 01:23:14,286
I have found meaning.

1040
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:35,516
I see it.

1041
01:23:37,976 --> 01:23:39,811
Eternity!

1042
01:23:40,145 --> 01:23:41,647
Oh, my God.

1043
01:23:52,241 --> 01:23:54,326
We need to get off this planet.

1044
01:24:08,006 --> 01:24:09,299
Oh, man.

1045
01:24:09,466 --> 01:24:11,885
Anyway, before I was
so rudely interrupted...

1046
01:24:12,052 --> 01:24:14,930
At that time,
I was a Federal Express man.

1047
01:24:25,858 --> 01:24:27,901
What the hell you doing, boy?

1048
01:24:28,068 --> 01:24:30,153
I could tell
by how you talked about him...

1049
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,655
this Ego is bad news.

1050
01:24:31,822 --> 01:24:33,448
We're here to save Quill.

1051
01:24:33,615 --> 01:24:37,661
For what? Huh?
For honor? For love?

1052
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:40,747
No. I don't care about those things.

1053
01:24:40,914 --> 01:24:43,208
I wanna save Quill so I can prove
I'm better than him!

1054
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:46,211
I can lord this over him forever.

1055
01:24:47,921 --> 01:24:49,798
What are you laughing at me for?

1056
01:24:50,382 --> 01:24:55,095
You can fool yourself and everyone
else, but you can't fool me.

1057
01:24:55,262 --> 01:24:56,471
I know who you are.

1058
01:24:56,638 --> 01:24:58,932
You don't know anything
about me, loser.

1059
01:24:59,099 --> 01:25:01,351
I know everything about you.

1060
01:25:01,852 --> 01:25:04,229
I know you play like
you're the meanest and the hardest...

1061
01:25:04,396 --> 01:25:05,856
but, actually,
you're the most scared of all.

1062
01:25:06,023 --> 01:25:06,857
Shut up!

1063
01:25:07,024 --> 01:25:09,318
I know you steal batteries
you don't need...

1064
01:25:09,484 --> 01:25:12,070
and you push away anyone
who's willing to put up with you...

1065
01:25:12,237 --> 01:25:13,530
because just a little bit of love...

1066
01:25:13,697 --> 01:25:17,034
reminds you how big and empty
that hole inside you actually is.

1067
01:25:17,367 --> 01:25:18,619
I said shut up!

1068
01:25:19,077 --> 01:25:22,164
I know them scientists what made you,
never gave a rat's ass about you.

1069
01:25:22,331 --> 01:25:23,624
I'm serious, dude!

1070
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:26,376
Just like my own damn parents
who sold me...

1071
01:25:26,543 --> 01:25:28,545
their own little baby,
into slavery.

1072
01:25:29,046 --> 01:25:31,298
I know who you are, boy.

1073
01:25:31,465 --> 01:25:33,467
Because you're me.

1074
01:25:40,015 --> 01:25:42,100
What kind of a pair are we?

1075
01:25:43,393 --> 01:25:46,438
The kind that's about to go fight
a planet, I reckon.

1076
01:25:46,605 --> 01:25:49,775
All right, okay! Good. Wait.

1077
01:25:50,192 --> 01:25:51,610
Fight a what?

1078
01:25:55,989 --> 01:25:56,949
Who are you people?

1079
01:25:57,115 --> 01:25:58,075
What is this place?

1080
01:25:58,242 --> 01:25:59,243
Gamora, let her go!

1081
01:25:59,409 --> 01:26:01,578
The bodies in the caverns...
Who are they?

1082
01:26:01,745 --> 01:26:04,039
You are scared.

1083
01:26:07,459 --> 01:26:10,337
I call it the Expansion.

1084
01:26:11,463 --> 01:26:14,758
It is my purpose...

1085
01:26:14,925 --> 01:26:18,428
and now it is yours as well.

1086
01:26:19,304 --> 01:26:20,889
It's beautiful.

1087
01:26:22,015 --> 01:26:23,308
Over thousands of years...

1088
01:26:23,475 --> 01:26:27,604
I implanted thousands of extensions
of myself...

1089
01:26:27,771 --> 01:26:30,482
on thousands of worlds.

1090
01:26:30,649 --> 01:26:34,444
I need to fulfill life's
one true purpose...

1091
01:26:34,611 --> 01:26:36,488
To grow and spread...

1092
01:26:36,655 --> 01:26:39,783
covering all that exists...

1093
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:44,121
until everything is...

1094
01:26:45,414 --> 01:26:46,415
Me!

1095
01:26:47,207 --> 01:26:49,459
What did she do to me?

1096
01:26:49,626 --> 01:26:51,336
She already told me everything.

1097
01:26:51,503 --> 01:26:53,964
I only had one problem.

1098
01:26:54,673 --> 01:26:59,720
A single Celestial doesn't have
enough power for such an enterprise.

1099
01:26:59,887 --> 01:27:02,014
But two Celestials...

1100
01:27:02,181 --> 01:27:05,475
Well, now, that just might do.

1101
01:27:08,228 --> 01:27:09,605
The bodies...

1102
01:27:10,355 --> 01:27:12,774
are his children.

1103
01:27:13,192 --> 01:27:14,484
Out of all my labors...

1104
01:27:14,651 --> 01:27:16,778
the most beguiling was...

1105
01:27:16,945 --> 01:27:20,365
attempting to graft my DNA
with that of another species.

1106
01:27:20,532 --> 01:27:23,452
I hoped the result of such a coupling
would be enough...

1107
01:27:23,619 --> 01:27:25,537
to power the Expansion.

1108
01:27:26,538 --> 01:27:29,041
I had Yondu deliver
some of them to me.

1109
01:27:29,208 --> 01:27:32,711
It broke the Ravager code, but
I compensated him generously...

1110
01:27:32,878 --> 01:27:36,465
and to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.

1111
01:27:36,632 --> 01:27:39,259
I mean, that was true.
They never felt a thing.

1112
01:27:39,426 --> 01:27:42,721
But one after the other, they failed me.

1113
01:27:42,888 --> 01:27:46,725
Not one of them carried
the Celestial genes.

1114
01:27:46,892 --> 01:27:48,143
Until you, Peter.

1115
01:27:49,353 --> 01:27:51,939
Out of all my spawn...

1116
01:27:52,105 --> 01:27:56,193
only you carried the connection
to the light.

1117
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:59,238
We need to find Peter now,
and get off this damn planet.

1118
01:27:59,404 --> 01:28:01,990
Ego will have won him
to his side by now.

1119
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,576
-Then we just go.
-No!

1120
01:28:04,743 --> 01:28:06,995
-He's our friend.
-All any of you do...

1121
01:28:07,162 --> 01:28:09,331
is yell at each other.
You are not friends.

1122
01:28:09,498 --> 01:28:10,874
You're right.

1123
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:12,543
We're family.

1124
01:28:14,378 --> 01:28:16,004
We leave no one behind.

1125
01:28:19,383 --> 01:28:20,759
Except maybe you.

1126
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:22,761
Oh, my God.

1127
01:28:23,428 --> 01:28:25,514
For the first time in my existence...

1128
01:28:25,681 --> 01:28:28,725
I am truly not alone!

1129
01:28:34,147 --> 01:28:35,440
What is it, son?

1130
01:28:38,694 --> 01:28:39,945
My friends.

1131
01:28:41,196 --> 01:28:45,242
You see,
that's the mortal in you, Peter.

1132
01:28:45,784 --> 01:28:46,660
Yes.

1133
01:28:46,827 --> 01:28:49,913
We are beyond such things.

1134
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,081
Yes.

1135
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,710
-Now...
-But my mother...

1136
01:28:57,588 --> 01:28:59,923
You said you loved my mother.

1137
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:01,592
And that I did.

1138
01:29:02,843 --> 01:29:07,723
My river lily who knew all the words
to every song that came over the radio.

1139
01:29:09,516 --> 01:29:12,186
I returned to Earth
to see her three times.

1140
01:29:12,352 --> 01:29:14,897
And I knew if I returned a fourth...

1141
01:29:15,063 --> 01:29:16,607
I'd never leave.

1142
01:29:17,733 --> 01:29:19,276
The Expansion...

1143
01:29:20,694 --> 01:29:23,030
the reason for my very existence,
would be over.

1144
01:29:23,197 --> 01:29:25,240
So, I did what I had to do.

1145
01:29:28,035 --> 01:29:31,538
But it broke my heart
to put that tumor in her head.

1146
01:29:36,043 --> 01:29:36,877
What?

1147
01:29:37,044 --> 01:29:38,587
Now, all right...

1148
01:29:38,754 --> 01:29:40,506
I know that sounds bad.

1149
01:29:52,434 --> 01:29:55,896
Who in the hell do you think you are?

1150
01:29:56,063 --> 01:29:57,689
You killed my mother!

1151
01:29:57,856 --> 01:29:58,899
I tried...

1152
01:29:59,066 --> 01:30:00,817
so hard...

1153
01:30:00,984 --> 01:30:02,361
to find the form...

1154
01:30:02,528 --> 01:30:04,905
that best suited you...

1155
01:30:05,072 --> 01:30:07,491
and this is the thanks I get?

1156
01:30:09,201 --> 01:30:11,745
You really need to grow up.

1157
01:30:15,832 --> 01:30:18,085
I wanted to do this together...

1158
01:30:18,252 --> 01:30:21,046
but I suppose you'll have
to learn by spending

1159
01:30:21,171 --> 01:30:23,632
the next thousand years as a battery!

1160
01:30:25,342 --> 01:30:27,135
Finally! Rocket?

1161
01:30:27,302 --> 01:30:30,013
Keep that transmitter nearby,
so I can find you.

1162
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:33,350
We're in an old piece of construction
equipment Yondu once used...

1163
01:30:33,517 --> 01:30:34,810
to slice open the Bank of A'askavaria.

1164
01:30:34,977 --> 01:30:35,853
Ego's unhinged.

1165
01:30:36,019 --> 01:30:37,437
I know. Get ready.

1166
01:30:37,604 --> 01:30:39,022
Drop her, Kraglin.

1167
01:30:57,624 --> 01:30:58,750
No.

1168
01:31:09,845 --> 01:31:12,723
My life, my love

1169
01:31:12,890 --> 01:31:15,100
My lady is the sea

1170
01:31:17,186 --> 01:31:18,312
Peter...

1171
01:31:19,104 --> 01:31:21,440
this is the sea.

1172
01:32:04,608 --> 01:32:06,276
Hey, there, jackass!

1173
01:32:16,537 --> 01:32:18,038
What is that thing?

1174
01:32:25,546 --> 01:32:27,506
Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!

1175
01:32:32,261 --> 01:32:34,930
I told you something didn't feel right.

1176
01:32:35,097 --> 01:32:37,391
"I told you so."
Just what I need to hear right now.

1177
01:32:37,558 --> 01:32:39,226
Well, I came back, didn't I?

1178
01:32:39,893 --> 01:32:41,186
Because there's an unspoken thing.

1179
01:32:41,353 --> 01:32:43,397
There is no unspoken thing.

1180
01:32:43,564 --> 01:32:45,232
What are you doing?
You could've killed us all!

1181
01:32:45,941 --> 01:32:47,484
"Thank you, Rocket"?

1182
01:32:47,651 --> 01:32:48,819
We had it under control.

1183
01:32:48,986 --> 01:32:51,321
We did not.
That is only an extension...

1184
01:32:51,488 --> 01:32:53,615
of his true self.
He will be back soon.

1185
01:32:53,782 --> 01:32:55,033
What's Smurfette doing here?

1186
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,035
Whatever I need to do to get
a damn ride home.

1187
01:32:57,202 --> 01:32:58,453
She tried to murder me!

1188
01:32:58,620 --> 01:33:00,455
I saved you, you stupid fox!

1189
01:33:00,622 --> 01:33:02,040
He's not a fox.

1190
01:33:02,207 --> 01:33:04,251
-I am Groot.
-I'm not a raboon, either.

1191
01:33:04,418 --> 01:33:05,419
I am Groot.

1192
01:33:05,586 --> 01:33:07,129
"Raccoon." Whatever.

1193
01:33:10,549 --> 01:33:11,884
How do we kill a Celestial?

1194
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:13,468
There's a center to him.

1195
01:33:13,635 --> 01:33:17,139
His brain, his soul, whatever it is...
Some sort of protective shell.

1196
01:33:17,472 --> 01:33:18,515
It's in the caverns...

1197
01:33:18,682 --> 01:33:19,766
below the surface.

1198
01:33:22,352 --> 01:33:23,645
Yondu?

1199
01:33:32,571 --> 01:33:33,822
Thrusters are out.

1200
01:33:34,323 --> 01:33:36,074
Guess I should be glad
I was a skinny kid.

1201
01:33:36,241 --> 01:33:38,076
Otherwise, you'd have delivered me
to this maniac.

1202
01:33:38,243 --> 01:33:40,662
You still reckon that's the reason
I kept you around, you idiot?

1203
01:33:40,829 --> 01:33:42,289
That's what you told me,
you old doofus.

1204
01:33:42,956 --> 01:33:45,042
Once I figured out
what happened to them other kids...

1205
01:33:45,209 --> 01:33:46,793
I wasn't just gonna hand you over.

1206
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,504
You said you were gonna eat me.

1207
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:50,214
That was being funny!

1208
01:33:51,006 --> 01:33:52,174
Not to me!

1209
01:33:52,341 --> 01:33:53,509
You people have issues.

1210
01:33:53,675 --> 01:33:55,552
Of course I have issues.

1211
01:33:56,386 --> 01:33:59,223
That's my freakin' father!

1212
01:33:59,389 --> 01:34:00,974
Thrusters are back up.

1213
01:34:14,571 --> 01:34:16,740
-We should be going up!
-We can't!

1214
01:34:16,907 --> 01:34:19,493
Ego wants to eradicate the universe
as we know it.

1215
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:20,953
We have to kill him.

1216
01:34:21,119 --> 01:34:21,787
Rocket!

1217
01:34:21,954 --> 01:34:22,704
Got it!

1218
01:34:36,844 --> 01:34:38,679
So, we're saving the galaxy again?

1219
01:34:38,846 --> 01:34:39,930
I guess.

1220
01:34:40,097 --> 01:34:41,181
Awesome!

1221
01:34:43,183 --> 01:34:45,394
We're really gonna be able to
jack up our prices...

1222
01:34:45,561 --> 01:34:47,145
if we're two-time galaxy savers.

1223
01:34:47,312 --> 01:34:49,898
I seriously can't believe
that's where your mind goes.

1224
01:34:50,065 --> 01:34:52,818
It was just a random thought, man.
I thought we were friends.

1225
01:34:52,985 --> 01:34:55,279
Of course, I care about the planets,
and the buildings...

1226
01:34:55,445 --> 01:34:57,281
and all the animals on the planets.

1227
01:34:57,447 --> 01:34:58,657
And the people.

1228
01:34:58,824 --> 01:34:59,825
Meh.

1229
01:35:00,450 --> 01:35:04,621
The crabby puppy is so cute.
He makes me wanna die!

1230
01:35:42,326 --> 01:35:43,327
Pilots...

1231
01:35:43,493 --> 01:35:44,828
release envoy units.

1232
01:35:46,997 --> 01:35:51,084
Our sensors detect the batteries
are below the surface of the planet.

1233
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:53,921
Dive!

1234
01:36:10,896 --> 01:36:12,397
Captain?

1235
01:36:13,148 --> 01:36:14,566
Captain?

1236
01:36:19,530 --> 01:36:21,281
Tell me why Ego wants you here?

1237
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:23,450
He needs my genetic connection
to the light...

1238
01:36:23,617 --> 01:36:25,744
to help destroy the universe.

1239
01:36:25,911 --> 01:36:28,163
He tried to teach me
how to control the power.

1240
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:29,456
So, could you?

1241
01:36:29,623 --> 01:36:30,791
A little.

1242
01:36:30,958 --> 01:36:32,125
I made a ball.

1243
01:36:32,292 --> 01:36:33,335
A ball?

1244
01:36:33,502 --> 01:36:36,880
I thought as hard as I could.
It was all that I could come up with.

1245
01:36:37,047 --> 01:36:38,298
You "thought"?

1246
01:36:38,465 --> 01:36:40,509
You think when I make this arrow fly...

1247
01:36:40,676 --> 01:36:42,094
I use my head?

1248
01:36:54,064 --> 01:36:55,357
Whoa.

1249
01:37:04,199 --> 01:37:05,200
There.

1250
01:37:05,367 --> 01:37:07,327
That's Ego's core.

1251
01:37:09,705 --> 01:37:11,331
That ore is thick, Rocket.

1252
01:37:11,498 --> 01:37:13,125
I got it covered.

1253
01:37:19,506 --> 01:37:20,841
We must hurry.

1254
01:37:21,008 --> 01:37:23,135
It will not take Ego long to find us.

1255
01:37:27,347 --> 01:37:28,557
Keep it steady.

1256
01:37:35,063 --> 01:37:37,149
We drill into the center, we kill him!

1257
01:37:43,530 --> 01:37:44,865
Captain?

1258
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:46,200
What is it, Kraglin?

1259
01:37:46,366 --> 01:37:48,410
Hey, remember that Ayesha chick?

1260
01:37:48,869 --> 01:37:50,037
Yeah, why?

1261
01:37:51,038 --> 01:37:52,080
Oh, hell!

1262
01:38:12,851 --> 01:38:14,561
Why aren't you firing the lasers?

1263
01:38:14,937 --> 01:38:16,647
They blew out the generator.

1264
01:38:16,813 --> 01:38:19,566
I think I packed a small detonator.

1265
01:38:19,733 --> 01:38:21,318
A detonator is worthless
without explosives.

1266
01:38:21,485 --> 01:38:23,070
Well, we got these.

1267
01:38:23,737 --> 01:38:25,739
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?

1268
01:38:25,906 --> 01:38:27,824
If it is,
it'll cause a chain reaction...

1269
01:38:27,991 --> 01:38:29,660
throughout his entire nervous system.

1270
01:38:29,826 --> 01:38:30,577
Meaning what?

1271
01:38:30,744 --> 01:38:32,371
The entire planet will explode.

1272
01:38:32,538 --> 01:38:34,039
We'll have to get out of here fast.

1273
01:38:34,206 --> 01:38:35,707
I rigged a timer.

1274
01:38:36,667 --> 01:38:37,876
Go!

1275
01:38:51,974 --> 01:38:53,767
He's coming.

1276
01:38:55,185 --> 01:38:56,979
Didn't you say you
could make him sleep?

1277
01:38:57,354 --> 01:38:59,773
When he wants. He's too powerful.

1278
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:01,358
I can't!

1279
01:39:01,775 --> 01:39:03,652
You don't have to believe in yourself...

1280
01:39:04,361 --> 01:39:06,488
because I believe in you.

1281
01:39:18,792 --> 01:39:19,459
Sleep!

1282
01:39:27,176 --> 01:39:28,760
I never thought
she'd be able to do it...

1283
01:39:28,927 --> 01:39:31,180
with as weak and skinny
as she appears to be.

1284
01:39:32,097 --> 01:39:35,184
I don't know how long I can hold him.

1285
01:39:38,312 --> 01:39:39,980
The metal's too thick.

1286
01:39:40,147 --> 01:39:43,483
For the bomb to work, we'd actually
need to place it on Ego's core.

1287
01:39:43,650 --> 01:39:46,028
And our fat butts ain't gonna fit
through those tiny holes.

1288
01:39:46,737 --> 01:39:47,696
Well...

1289
01:39:50,324 --> 01:39:52,201
That's a terrible idea.

1290
01:39:52,367 --> 01:39:54,745
Which is the only kind of idea
we have left.

1291
01:39:55,704 --> 01:39:57,122
Unbelievable.

1292
01:39:57,289 --> 01:39:59,625
"Rocket, do this.
Rocket, do that."

1293
01:40:01,126 --> 01:40:02,586
What a day.

1294
01:40:10,177 --> 01:40:13,722
All right, first you flick this switch,
then this switch.

1295
01:40:13,889 --> 01:40:15,098
That activates it.

1296
01:40:15,265 --> 01:40:17,100
Then you push this button...

1297
01:40:17,267 --> 01:40:20,312
which will give you five minutes
to get out of there.

1298
01:40:20,479 --> 01:40:21,855
Now, whatever you do...

1299
01:40:22,397 --> 01:40:24,816
don't push this button...

1300
01:40:24,983 --> 01:40:28,570
because that will set off the bomb
immediately and we'll all be dead.

1301
01:40:28,737 --> 01:40:31,156
Now, repeat back what I just said.

1302
01:40:31,323 --> 01:40:33,116
-I am Groot.
-Uh-huh.

1303
01:40:33,283 --> 01:40:35,244
-I am Groot.
-That's right.

1304
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:36,620
-I am Groot.
-No!

1305
01:40:36,954 --> 01:40:39,331
No, that's the button
that will kill everyone!

1306
01:40:39,498 --> 01:40:40,499
Try again.

1307
01:40:43,502 --> 01:40:45,337
-I am Groot.
-Mm-hmm.

1308
01:40:45,504 --> 01:40:47,548
-I am Groot.
-Uh-huh.

1309
01:40:47,714 --> 01:40:48,632
I am Groot.

1310
01:40:48,799 --> 01:40:50,634
No! That's exactly what you just said!

1311
01:40:50,801 --> 01:40:52,386
How is that even possible?

1312
01:40:52,553 --> 01:40:54,763
Which button is the button
you're supposed to push?

1313
01:40:54,930 --> 01:40:56,056
Point to it.

1314
01:40:56,223 --> 01:40:57,182
No!

1315
01:40:57,516 --> 01:40:59,268
Hey, you're making him nervous!

1316
01:40:59,434 --> 01:41:01,186
Shut up and get me some tape!

1317
01:41:01,353 --> 01:41:02,729
Does anybody have any tape out there?

1318
01:41:02,896 --> 01:41:04,606
I wanna put some tape
over the death button.

1319
01:41:04,773 --> 01:41:07,651
I don't have any tape. Let me check.

1320
01:41:07,818 --> 01:41:09,278
Yo, Yondu...

1321
01:41:10,654 --> 01:41:12,823
Do you have any tape?

1322
01:41:15,117 --> 01:41:18,161
Gamora? Do you have any tape?

1323
01:41:18,328 --> 01:41:19,371
Tape!

1324
01:41:19,538 --> 01:41:20,789
Never mind.

1325
01:41:22,875 --> 01:41:25,460
Drax, do you have any tape?

1326
01:41:26,211 --> 01:41:28,172
Yes, Scotch tape would work.

1327
01:41:28,463 --> 01:41:30,424
Then why did you ask me
if Scotch tape would work,

1328
01:41:30,507 --> 01:41:32,009
if you don't have any?

1329
01:41:33,010 --> 01:41:34,136
Nobody has any tape!

1330
01:41:34,303 --> 01:41:35,846
Not a single person has tape?

1331
01:41:36,221 --> 01:41:37,222
Nope!

1332
01:41:37,389 --> 01:41:38,557
Did you ask Nebula?

1333
01:41:39,433 --> 01:41:40,142
Yes!

1334
01:41:40,309 --> 01:41:41,518
Are you sure?

1335
01:41:41,685 --> 01:41:42,978
I asked Yondu...

1336
01:41:43,145 --> 01:41:45,314
-and she was sitting next to him.
-I knew you were lying!

1337
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:47,524
You have priceless batteries
and an atomic bomb in your bag.

1338
01:41:47,691 --> 01:41:50,068
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!

1339
01:41:50,235 --> 01:41:53,739
That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!

1340
01:41:53,947 --> 01:41:56,450
You are wasting a lot of time here!

1341
01:42:02,789 --> 01:42:04,791
We're all gonna die.

1342
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:08,629
Rear thrusters are out again!

1343
01:42:08,795 --> 01:42:11,590
We're done for without that generator!

1344
01:42:24,853 --> 01:42:26,104
Guardians...

1345
01:42:26,897 --> 01:42:28,565
perhaps it will provide you solace...

1346
01:42:28,732 --> 01:42:31,401
that your deaths
are not without purpose.

1347
01:42:31,902 --> 01:42:33,570
They will serve as a warning...

1348
01:42:33,737 --> 01:42:35,989
to all of those tempted
with betraying us.

1349
01:42:36,532 --> 01:42:39,326
Don't screw with the Sovereign.

1350
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:44,164
This is gonna hurt.

1351
01:42:44,331 --> 01:42:45,958
Promises, promises.

1352
01:42:56,301 --> 01:42:57,135
Hey!

1353
01:43:08,939 --> 01:43:09,940
No!

1354
01:43:10,524 --> 01:43:12,651
No! No! No!

1355
01:43:18,115 --> 01:43:19,116
We're gonna blow!

1356
01:43:24,371 --> 01:43:26,415
Peter! No!

1357
01:43:46,226 --> 01:43:47,144
What?

1358
01:43:47,561 --> 01:43:49,563
You look like Mary Poppins.

1359
01:43:49,730 --> 01:43:51,148
Is he cool?

1360
01:43:52,941 --> 01:43:54,651
Hell, yeah, he's cool.

1361
01:43:55,319 --> 01:43:57,279
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

1362
01:44:24,598 --> 01:44:26,683
Mantis, look out!

1363
01:44:38,737 --> 01:44:40,405
She's just unconscious.

1364
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:57,923
How long until the bomb goes off?

1365
01:44:58,090 --> 01:45:00,425
In the unlikely event
that Groot doesn't kill us all...

1366
01:45:00,592 --> 01:45:01,844
about six minutes.

1367
01:45:06,807 --> 01:45:09,309
Kraglin, we need the quadrant
for an extraction.

1368
01:45:09,476 --> 01:45:10,477
T-minus five minutes.

1369
01:45:10,644 --> 01:45:11,812
Aye, Captain.

1370
01:45:15,649 --> 01:45:17,568
Somebody's gotta be up top
when Kraglin arrives.

1371
01:45:18,861 --> 01:45:20,404
Drax, take Mantis.

1372
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:24,616
My nipples!

1373
01:45:32,749 --> 01:45:34,084
Gamora!

1374
01:45:37,713 --> 01:45:38,839
Peter!

1375
01:46:05,073 --> 01:46:06,491
Get over it.

1376
01:46:06,867 --> 01:46:10,746
Come now, Peter.
I know this isn't what you want.

1377
01:46:12,748 --> 01:46:17,252
What kind of father would I be
to let you make this choice?

1378
01:46:46,698 --> 01:46:47,824
Yeah!

1379
01:46:48,784 --> 01:46:52,412
Soon, Peter, we will be all there is.

1380
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:56,291
So stop pissing me off!

1381
01:47:16,395 --> 01:47:18,021
We have to get up
to the extraction point!

1382
01:47:26,113 --> 01:47:27,114
Go!

1383
01:49:26,567 --> 01:49:28,151
I told you...

1384
01:49:28,318 --> 01:49:32,239
I don't want to do this alone.

1385
01:49:35,450 --> 01:49:36,451
You cannot deny...

1386
01:49:36,618 --> 01:49:40,956
the purpose the universe
has bestowed upon you.

1387
01:49:50,048 --> 01:49:51,842
Everyone, I need you to stay back!

1388
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:53,051
What is that?

1389
01:50:08,734 --> 01:50:11,028
It doesn't need to be like this, Peter.

1390
01:50:13,071 --> 01:50:16,200
Why are you destroying our chance?

1391
01:50:18,827 --> 01:50:21,955
Stop pretending you
aren't what you are.

1392
01:50:23,874 --> 01:50:24,875
One in billions.

1393
01:50:26,585 --> 01:50:28,420
Trillions. Even more.

1394
01:50:30,756 --> 01:50:35,135
What greater meaning
can life possibly have to offer?

1395
01:50:37,804 --> 01:50:41,975
I don't use my head
to fly the arrow, boy!

1396
01:50:42,476 --> 01:50:44,353
I use my heart...

1397
01:51:19,596 --> 01:51:23,392
You shouldn't have killed my mom,
and squished my Walkman.

1398
01:51:23,559 --> 01:51:27,104
And if you don't love me now

1399
01:51:27,271 --> 01:51:29,690
You will never love me again

1400
01:51:29,857 --> 01:51:32,693
I can still hear you saying

1401
01:51:32,860 --> 01:51:36,780
You would never break the chain

1402
01:51:36,947 --> 01:51:38,991
And if you don't love me now

1403
01:51:39,157 --> 01:51:41,827
You will never love me again

1404
01:51:42,452 --> 01:51:46,623
I can still hear you saying

1405
01:51:46,790 --> 01:51:49,585
You would never break the chain

1406
01:51:49,751 --> 01:51:52,296
And if you don't love me now

1407
01:51:52,462 --> 01:51:55,340
You will never love me again

1408
01:51:55,507 --> 01:52:00,971
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

1409
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:06,435
Groot? If you can hear me,
hurry up!

1410
01:52:06,602 --> 01:52:09,855
I'm not sure how long Quill
can keep him distracted!

1411
01:52:10,230 --> 01:52:11,815
Groot, hurry!

1412
01:53:07,579 --> 01:53:09,831
Yondu, we're about to blow!

1413
01:53:09,998 --> 01:53:11,458
Get to the ship!

1414
01:53:11,625 --> 01:53:12,668
Not without Quill!

1415
01:53:12,835 --> 01:53:15,003
You need to take care of the twig!

1416
01:53:16,255 --> 01:53:18,048
Not without you!

1417
01:53:19,216 --> 01:53:22,511
I ain't done nothin' right
my whole damn life, rat.

1418
01:53:25,889 --> 01:53:28,100
You need to give me this.

1419
01:53:38,318 --> 01:53:40,821
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

1420
01:53:40,988 --> 01:53:43,156
I only have one of each.

1421
01:53:55,419 --> 01:53:57,087
I am Groot.

1422
01:53:57,838 --> 01:53:58,922
What's that?

1423
01:54:00,549 --> 01:54:04,761
He says, "Welcome to the frickin'
Guardians of the Galaxy."

1424
01:54:05,345 --> 01:54:07,723
Only he didn't use "frickin'."

1425
01:54:13,979 --> 01:54:15,063
Bye, twig.

1426
01:54:16,982 --> 01:54:20,611
We're gonna need to have
a real discussion about your language.

1427
01:55:15,249 --> 01:55:16,250
Where's Peter?

1428
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,002
Rocket, where is he?

1429
01:55:19,753 --> 01:55:20,712
Rocket.

1430
01:55:20,879 --> 01:55:22,464
Rocket, look at me! Where is he?

1431
01:55:28,846 --> 01:55:31,223
No. I'm not leaving without him.

1432
01:55:38,188 --> 01:55:39,189
I'm sorry.

1433
01:55:40,023 --> 01:55:42,860
I can only afford to lose one
friend today.

1434
01:55:43,402 --> 01:55:44,403
Kraglin, go!

1435
01:55:45,237 --> 01:55:46,238
Wait...

1436
01:55:46,989 --> 01:55:48,574
Is Quill back?

1437
01:55:50,075 --> 01:55:52,619
Rocket, where's Quill?

1438
01:55:53,662 --> 01:55:57,082
Rocket, where's Quill?

1439
01:55:58,083 --> 01:55:59,334
Rocket!

1440
01:56:00,419 --> 01:56:01,253
Where's Quill?

1441
01:56:03,422 --> 01:56:05,424
Where's Quill?

1442
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:15,893
No, we need to stop it.

1443
01:56:21,064 --> 01:56:22,065
Stop.

1444
01:56:22,858 --> 01:56:24,484
Stop. Listen to me!

1445
01:56:24,651 --> 01:56:26,236
You are a god.

1446
01:56:27,654 --> 01:56:28,989
If you kill me...

1447
01:56:29,156 --> 01:56:31,783
you'll be just like everybody else.

1448
01:56:32,826 --> 01:56:34,453
What's so wrong with that?

1449
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:35,621
No!

1450
01:57:26,255 --> 01:57:30,008
He may have been your father, boy,
but he wasn't your daddy.

1451
01:57:34,346 --> 01:57:36,682
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.

1452
01:57:37,766 --> 01:57:40,060
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

1453
01:57:43,814 --> 01:57:45,148
What?

1454
01:57:56,910 --> 01:57:58,078
Yondu, what are you doing?

1455
01:57:58,245 --> 01:57:59,413
You can't.

1456
01:58:00,122 --> 01:58:01,874
Yondu!

1457
01:58:07,462 --> 01:58:09,047
No!

1458
01:58:13,635 --> 01:58:14,511
No!

1459
01:58:17,890 --> 01:58:20,475
No! No!

1460
01:58:21,768 --> 01:58:23,061
No!

1461
01:59:17,866 --> 01:59:19,284
I told Gamora...

1462
01:59:19,451 --> 01:59:23,372
how when I was a kid I used to pretend
David Hasselhoff was my dad.

1463
01:59:26,124 --> 01:59:28,836
He's a singer and actor from Earth,
really famous guy.

1464
01:59:30,337 --> 01:59:32,256
Earlier, it struck me...

1465
01:59:33,465 --> 01:59:37,594
Yondu didn't have a talking car,
but he did have a flying arrow.

1466
01:59:38,178 --> 01:59:40,305
He didn't have the beautiful voice
of an angel...

1467
01:59:40,472 --> 01:59:42,766
but he did have the whistle of one.

1468
01:59:42,933 --> 01:59:46,436
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures...

1469
01:59:46,603 --> 01:59:49,106
and hooked up with hot women...

1470
01:59:49,273 --> 01:59:51,275
and fought robots.

1471
01:59:53,944 --> 01:59:57,948
I guess David Hasselhoff did
kind of end up being my dad after all.

1472
01:59:58,115 --> 01:59:59,283
Only it was you, Yondu.

1473
02:00:05,873 --> 02:00:07,791
I had a pretty cool dad.

1474
02:00:10,794 --> 02:00:13,463
What I'm trying to say here is...

1475
02:00:14,464 --> 02:00:19,136
sometimes that thing you're searching
for your whole life...

1476
02:00:21,471 --> 02:00:23,807
it's right there by your side all along.

1477
02:00:23,974 --> 02:00:25,809
You don't even know it.

1478
02:00:37,863 --> 02:00:39,323
I am Groot.

1479
02:00:40,699 --> 02:00:42,492
He did call you twig.

1480
02:00:44,870 --> 02:00:46,205
Nebula...

1481
02:00:51,168 --> 02:00:53,170
I was a child like you.

1482
02:00:54,004 --> 02:00:58,175
I was concerned with staying alive
until the next day, every day.

1483
02:00:58,342 --> 02:01:01,303
And I never considered
what Thanos was doing to you.

1484
02:01:01,470 --> 02:01:03,222
I'm trying to make it right.

1485
02:01:03,388 --> 02:01:04,806
There are little girls like you...

1486
02:01:04,973 --> 02:01:07,809
across the universe who are in danger.

1487
02:01:10,479 --> 02:01:12,022
You can stay with us and help them.

1488
02:01:12,648 --> 02:01:15,025
I will help them by killing Thanos.

1489
02:01:15,192 --> 02:01:17,194
I don't know if that's possible.

1490
02:01:32,084 --> 02:01:34,211
You will always be my sister.

1491
02:02:18,589 --> 02:02:19,423
Pete!

1492
02:02:23,218 --> 02:02:24,970
Captain found this for you
in a junker shop.

1493
02:02:25,137 --> 02:02:27,973
Said you'd come back
to the fold someday.

1494
02:02:29,766 --> 02:02:30,934
What is it?

1495
02:02:31,101 --> 02:02:32,060
It's called a Zune.

1496
02:02:32,227 --> 02:02:33,937
It's what everybody's listening
to on Earth nowadays.

1497
02:02:34,104 --> 02:02:35,647
It's got 300 songs on it.

1498
02:02:35,814 --> 02:02:38,108
300 songs?

1499
02:02:43,238 --> 02:02:44,406
Wait.

1500
02:02:50,454 --> 02:02:52,289
Rocket grabbed the pieces,
and reassembled them.

1501
02:02:52,456 --> 02:02:54,917
I think Yondu would want you to have it.

1502
02:02:58,337 --> 02:02:59,671
Thanks...

1503
02:03:01,507 --> 02:03:02,799
Captain.

1504
02:03:41,839 --> 02:03:44,633
It's not time to make a change

1505
02:03:45,676 --> 02:03:49,304
Just relax, take it easy

1506
02:03:49,471 --> 02:03:53,183
You're still young, that's your fault

1507
02:03:53,350 --> 02:03:56,311
There's so much you have to know

1508
02:03:56,478 --> 02:04:00,649
Find a girl, settle down

1509
02:04:00,816 --> 02:04:03,944
If you want you can marry

1510
02:04:04,111 --> 02:04:09,533
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy

1511
02:04:14,872 --> 02:04:16,206
They came.

1512
02:04:24,214 --> 02:04:25,674
What is it?

1513
02:04:26,341 --> 02:04:30,470
I sent word to Yondu's old Ravager
buddies, and told them what he did.

1514
02:04:34,057 --> 02:04:35,893
It's a Ravager funeral.

1515
02:04:53,327 --> 02:04:54,244
Yeah!

1516
02:04:54,912 --> 02:04:56,371
Yeah!

1517
02:05:03,712 --> 02:05:05,589
He didn't let us down
after all, Captain.

1518
02:05:06,548 --> 02:05:08,342
No, he did not, son.

1519
02:05:09,343 --> 02:05:10,761
He did not.

1520
02:05:17,434 --> 02:05:20,854
Fare thee well, old friend.

1521
02:05:23,065 --> 02:05:27,903
Yondu Udonta, I will see you
in the stars.

1522
02:05:31,949 --> 02:05:33,951
He didn't chase them away.

1523
02:05:34,117 --> 02:05:35,202
No.

1524
02:05:36,245 --> 02:05:38,372
Even though he yelled at them.

1525
02:05:38,539 --> 02:05:40,040
And was always mean.

1526
02:05:42,626 --> 02:05:44,753
And he stole batteries he didn't need.

1527
02:05:50,384 --> 02:05:51,927
Well, of course not.

1528
02:06:16,159 --> 02:06:17,327
What?

1529
02:06:17,995 --> 02:06:19,121
It's just...

1530
02:06:21,790 --> 02:06:24,501
some unspoken thing.

1531
02:06:33,594 --> 02:06:35,679
It's beautiful.

1532
02:06:37,181 --> 02:06:38,348
It is.

1533
02:06:39,850 --> 02:06:42,019
And so are you.

1534
02:06:43,979 --> 02:06:45,189
On the inside.

1535
02:06:52,029 --> 02:06:53,864
Now there's a way

1536
02:06:54,031 --> 02:06:58,035
And I know that I have to go away

1537
02:06:59,703 --> 02:07:02,206
I know I have to go

1538
02:08:41,305 --> 02:08:42,389
You know, it's a shame...

1539
02:08:42,556 --> 02:08:46,935
that it took the tragedy of losing Yondu
to bring us all together again.

1540
02:08:47,102 --> 02:08:50,314
But I think he'd be proud knowing
that we are back as a team.

1541
02:08:50,981 --> 02:08:51,982
I'm in.

1542
02:08:52,149 --> 02:08:53,108
Dope.

1543
02:08:53,275 --> 02:08:55,319
I miss you guys so much!

1544
02:08:55,485 --> 02:08:56,737
Hell, yes.

1545
02:08:59,781 --> 02:09:01,783
What say we steal some shit?

1546
02:11:20,881 --> 02:11:22,799
High Priestess, the Council is waiting.

1547
02:11:24,051 --> 02:11:27,137
They are perturbed
I've wasted our resources.

1548
02:11:31,808 --> 02:11:34,770
When they see
what I have created here...

1549
02:11:34,937 --> 02:11:36,980
their wrath will dissipate.

1550
02:11:38,148 --> 02:11:41,151
It's a new type of birthing pod, ma'am?

1551
02:11:42,569 --> 02:11:43,779
That, my child...

1552
02:11:43,946 --> 02:11:45,906
is the next step in our evolution.

1553
02:11:46,073 --> 02:11:49,117
More powerful, more beautiful...

1554
02:11:49,284 --> 02:11:53,455
more capable of destroying
the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1555
02:11:55,999 --> 02:11:58,585
I think I shall call him...

1556
02:12:00,337 --> 02:12:01,839
Adam.

1557
02:14:04,378 --> 02:14:05,212
Dude.

1558
02:14:06,088 --> 02:14:07,631
Seriously?

1559
02:14:07,798 --> 02:14:09,716
You gotta clean up your room.
It's a complete mess.

1560
02:14:09,883 --> 02:14:11,301
I am Groot.

1561
02:14:11,468 --> 02:14:13,387
I am not boring. You're boring.

1562
02:14:13,554 --> 02:14:14,471
You know what's boring?

1563
02:14:14,638 --> 02:14:17,724
Sitting there,
playing that mind-numbing game.

1564
02:14:17,891 --> 02:14:21,603
What's boring is me tripping over
your vines every day!

1565
02:14:22,062 --> 02:14:23,230
I'm not boring!

1566
02:14:23,397 --> 02:14:24,481
I am Groot.

1567
02:14:26,149 --> 02:14:28,652
And now I know how Yondu felt.

1568
02:15:04,438 --> 02:15:06,648
In these times of hardship...

1569
02:15:07,774 --> 02:15:09,860
just remember...

1570
02:15:10,444 --> 02:15:14,489
We. Are. Groot.

1571
02:15:17,784 --> 02:15:18,952
Hey, fellas.

1572
02:15:19,119 --> 02:15:20,787
Wait, where are you going?

1573
02:15:20,954 --> 02:15:23,373
You were supposed to be my lift home.

1574
02:15:23,540 --> 02:15:25,167
How will I get out of here?

1575
02:15:25,334 --> 02:15:26,543
Hey! Aw, gee...

1576
02:15:26,710 --> 02:15:29,463
I've got so many more stories to tell.

1577
02:15:29,630 --> 02:15:30,881
Aw, guys.

1578
02:15:31,048 --> 02:15:33,383
Oh, gee...
