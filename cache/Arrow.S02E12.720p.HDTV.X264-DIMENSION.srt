1
00:00:00,906 --> 00:00:02,690
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:06,662
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,664 --> 00:00:09,064
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,066 --> 00:00:11,751
to save my city.

5
00:00:11,753 --> 00:00:16,706
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:21,460
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:21,462 --> 00:00:25,698
I must be something else.

8
00:00:26,823 --> 00:00:28,509
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,161
You're telling me you don't have
a substance abuse problem?

10
00:00:31,163 --> 00:00:33,547
The D.A.'s office has a generous
severance package.

11
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:36,183
Wait, let me explain
to the D.A.--

12
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:37,751
I'm sorry, but you're done.

13
00:00:37,753 --> 00:00:40,420
Time to choose, Oliver,
who lives and who dies.

14
00:00:40,422 --> 00:00:42,922
You got what
you came for!

15
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:44,924
Time's up.
Freaking psychopath!

16
00:00:44,926 --> 00:00:47,144
No!
I guess you made your choice.

17
00:00:47,146 --> 00:00:49,780
No!

18
00:00:49,782 --> 00:00:50,889
Roy was injected with the serum.

19
00:00:50,914 --> 00:00:52,700
We are going to have
to keep an eye on him.

20
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:55,018
Roy! Roy, I think
you're killing him!

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,154
You're stronger,
you heal faster,

22
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:59,339
but you're not in control.

23
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:01,391
I can teach you.
Let me help you.

24
00:01:01,393 --> 00:01:03,293
When do we start?

25
00:01:08,966 --> 00:01:12,786
Got your latest
customer.

26
00:01:12,788 --> 00:01:14,554
Genius who held up
the convenience store

27
00:01:14,556 --> 00:01:16,473
across the street
from a police precinct.

28
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:18,175
Not the smartest plan.

29
00:01:20,595 --> 00:01:22,512
Come on through.

30
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,150
Bum knee.

31
00:01:27,152 --> 00:01:29,019
I had it replaced
a few years ago.

32
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:31,405
Well, I guess we'll have
to do this old-fashioned-like.

33
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:33,407
Arms up.

34
00:01:36,027 --> 00:01:38,612
Got your new bunk mate.

35
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:42,416
Play nice.

36
00:01:47,038 --> 00:01:49,923
Ben Turner?

37
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:51,425
Tonight.

38
00:01:51,427 --> 00:01:54,811
Midnight. Redwood Drive
and Larkspur Avenue.

39
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:56,580
What the hell
are you talking about?

40
00:01:56,582 --> 00:02:00,050
Redwood and Larkspur.
The rooftop. Be there.

41
00:02:00,052 --> 00:02:01,802
I don't know
if you've looked around,

42
00:02:01,804 --> 00:02:04,554
but we don't exactly
have in and out privileges here.

43
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:07,390
My son is with his mother.

44
00:02:07,392 --> 00:02:09,409
I won't get to see him, anyway.

45
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:11,645
This way, he's set.

46
00:02:11,647 --> 00:02:14,614
I do this, he gets the money.

47
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:18,735
Do what?

48
00:02:43,394 --> 00:02:45,345
What's going on
down there?

49
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:48,815
Crap.

50
00:02:51,937 --> 00:02:54,955
What the hell
did you do to him?

51
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:57,190
I didn't do
anything.

52
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,319
<font color=#00FF00>♪ Arrow 2x12 ♪</font>

Original Air Date on January 29, 2014

54
00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:13,006
Again.

55
00:03:15,561 --> 00:03:17,427
You know, I slapped water
out of a bowl yesterday.

56
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:19,296
And I slapped water
out of a bowl the day before.

57
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:21,798
You must be getting
pretty good at it.

58
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,634
Yeah, well, I can't wait to get
attacked by a dog dish.

59
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:26,520
This is how an archer
builds arm strength.

60
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:28,254
I'm not sure if you've
been paying attention,

61
00:03:28,256 --> 00:03:30,106
but strength
isn't my problem.

62
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:33,527
No, controlling it is.

63
00:03:33,529 --> 00:03:35,896
Again.

64
00:03:40,618 --> 00:03:42,702
And that...

65
00:03:42,704 --> 00:03:45,655
is how you put a guy
in the hospital last week.

66
00:03:48,826 --> 00:03:51,828
How'd you know
about that?

67
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,079
It's none
of your business.

68
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:54,464
You made it my business

69
00:03:54,466 --> 00:03:56,416
when you agreed
to let me help you.

70
00:03:56,418 --> 00:04:00,503
I knew someone like you.

71
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:04,257
Someone injected
with the Mirakuru.

72
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:05,959
He was my friend.

73
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:08,461
But it warped his mind
to the point

74
00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:11,431
where I didn't even
recognize him anymore.

75
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:13,967
Who was this guy?

76
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:16,987
How come I've never
heard of him?

77
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:20,457
Or that Mirakuru?

78
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,243
Is there anything
you can tell me about him?

79
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:26,129
Yeah.

80
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:30,116
I had to put an arrow
through his eye.

81
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,758
If I'm reading this right,
then Slade is back at the cave.

82
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,344
Well, why would he go back
to where the graves are?

83
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:42,996
We'll find out
when we find him.

84
00:04:42,998 --> 00:04:46,182
And when we do...
You can't tell him.

85
00:04:46,184 --> 00:04:48,935
Tell him what?

86
00:04:48,937 --> 00:04:51,337
Don't talk to me like
I'm other people.

87
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:55,058
You've got that look
on your face.

88
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,560
The same one that you had
after the first time we kissed.

89
00:04:57,562 --> 00:04:59,178
Pure guilt.

90
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,114
Because I am
guilty, Sara.

91
00:05:01,116 --> 00:05:02,983
Ivo killed Shado
because of me.

92
00:05:02,985 --> 00:05:04,451
But that's not true.

93
00:05:04,453 --> 00:05:06,036
And even if it was,

94
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:08,187
nothing good comes
from telling Slade

95
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:09,739
that you think
you're responsible

96
00:05:09,741 --> 00:05:12,876
for the death
of the woman he loved.

97
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:14,628
Love's the most
powerful emotion.

98
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,414
And that makes it
the most dangerous.

99
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:22,636
Great.

100
00:05:22,638 --> 00:05:24,170
You still know how
to get to the cave?

101
00:05:24,172 --> 00:05:25,889
Yeah.

102
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:28,258
It's this way.

103
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,148
Thea?

104
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,433
What are you doing home?

105
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:38,151
I thought you were
staying at Roy's.

106
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:40,603
Just needed
a little "me" time.

107
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:42,889
What's with
the fancy fancy?

108
00:05:42,891 --> 00:05:45,525
Oh, I'm--
I'm going out to dinner.

109
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:48,161
With Walter.

110
00:05:48,163 --> 00:05:49,779
Like a date?

111
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:51,982
Like a dinner.

112
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,451
Truly, I don't know
what the evening holds.

113
00:05:56,872 --> 00:05:58,755
Are you all right?

114
00:05:58,757 --> 00:06:00,840
Yeah. I'm fine.

115
00:06:00,842 --> 00:06:02,876
Mostly. Uh...

116
00:06:02,878 --> 00:06:04,661
It's Roy.

117
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:08,098
He had some trouble
last week, and...

118
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,267
I don't know
how to help him.

119
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:12,602
Do you want me to stay home?

120
00:06:12,604 --> 00:06:14,521
I can call Walter
and we can reschedule.

121
00:06:14,523 --> 00:06:16,106
Absolutely not.

122
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:20,110
If you and Walter
are going to patch things up...

123
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:23,863
No pressure.
But you're going.

124
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:26,182
It may be nothing.

125
00:06:26,184 --> 00:06:28,485
Only one way
to find out.

126
00:06:36,494 --> 00:06:39,829
No, please, Dad,
come right in.

127
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:42,716
Well, I guess you're going for
that lived-in look.

128
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:46,469
Can't afford a housekeeper
without a job.

129
00:06:46,471 --> 00:06:49,639
Got enough beverage
money, I see.

130
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:51,975
I'm going to need to crack open
another bottle if we're going to fight.

131
00:06:51,977 --> 00:06:53,426
I didn't come here
to fight.

132
00:06:53,428 --> 00:06:55,011
Then why are you here?

133
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:56,346
Because I'm fine, really.

134
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:59,432
In fact, I have
a job interview.

135
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:01,434
At Joanna's new firm.

136
00:07:01,436 --> 00:07:03,653
That's good. Good.

137
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:06,823
But the real reason
I came here is--

138
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:09,192
Is because you realized
that you didn't reach your weekly quota

139
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:12,178
of reminding me of how much
I'm ruining my life?

140
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,164
It's 'cause
I miss you, Laurel.

141
00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:19,502
For a long time,
it was just you and me.

142
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:21,010
Whatever else was going on,

143
00:07:21,035 --> 00:07:22,802
no matter how bad
either of us was doing,

144
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:26,509
we didn't disappear
on each other.

145
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:29,729
Because
you're my family.

146
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:33,266
And I miss my family.

147
00:07:33,268 --> 00:07:36,553
So how about
we have dinner?

148
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:38,221
You and me, tonight.

149
00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:41,441
I already ate.

150
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:43,109
Yeah.

151
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:45,562
How about
tomorrow night?

152
00:07:45,564 --> 00:07:48,865
Sure.

153
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:51,734
Dinner tomorrow.

154
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,238
Thank you.

155
00:08:03,465 --> 00:08:04,964
How's it
going with Roy?

156
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:06,716
Not well!

157
00:08:07,751 --> 00:08:10,053
I don't know the kid
all too well,

158
00:08:10,055 --> 00:08:12,172
but he seems to be
five kinds of angry.

159
00:08:12,174 --> 00:08:14,307
You might be underestimating.

160
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:17,922
Roy was mad at the world

161
00:08:17,947 --> 00:08:19,844
before he was injected
with Mirakuru.

162
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:21,598
You say you've seen this before?

163
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,567
Slade Wilson.
He was my friend.

164
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:26,653
Troubling use of
past tense there.

165
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:31,191
I thought I could
help him control it.

166
00:08:31,193 --> 00:08:33,409
I was wrong.

167
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:35,078
But I know more now,
and I'm not going

168
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,613
to make the same
mistake with Roy.

169
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:38,031
What's that?

170
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:40,283
Iron Heights.
Due to their low security

171
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:42,568
post-quake, I thought it would be
a good idea to keep an eye on

172
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,588
their internal
communication for a while.

173
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,841
You hacked into
a prison system network?

174
00:08:47,843 --> 00:08:49,709
Is that judgment
I'm hearing?

175
00:08:49,711 --> 00:08:52,045
Pride.

176
00:08:52,047 --> 00:08:54,013
Iron Heights just put out
a BOLO for Ben Turner,

177
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,582
aka Bronze tiger,
which, btw,

178
00:08:56,584 --> 00:08:59,802
is a terrible nickname,
because tigers are not bronze.

179
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:00,920
Turner escaped?

180
00:09:00,922 --> 00:09:02,305
Killed ten guards
on his way out.

181
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:03,640
You think that would
have made the news.

182
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:04,807
Iron Heights is better
at keeping secrets

183
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:06,142
than they are
at keeping prisoners.

184
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:07,360
Any idea where
he's headed?

185
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:09,479
No.
Get one.

186
00:09:18,038 --> 00:09:20,123
Tell your men
to take a walk.

187
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,991
Leave us.

188
00:09:21,993 --> 00:09:24,994
They can leave
their weapons, too.

189
00:09:30,885 --> 00:09:33,803
Thank you for
the early release.

190
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:36,873
Thought about
taking off, but I'm...

191
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,624
Curious.

192
00:09:38,626 --> 00:09:41,127
Who would break a stranger
out of prison?

193
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:43,680
Someone who wishes
to hire you for a job.

194
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:49,102
I need you to help mn
retrieve a certain item.

195
00:09:49,104 --> 00:09:51,688
This is the item.

196
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,072
You know it, yes?

197
00:09:53,074 --> 00:09:55,308
Yes, I do.

198
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,361
Do you know
what you're messing with here?

199
00:09:58,363 --> 00:10:00,914
Won't be cheap.

200
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,199
This is not a problem.

201
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:05,919
You do know that thing could kill
hundreds of people?

202
00:10:05,921 --> 00:10:07,954
No, Mr. Turner.

203
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:10,740
It will kill thousands.

204
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,215
Now you.

205
00:10:27,217 --> 00:10:29,551
Go slowly.

206
00:10:33,022 --> 00:10:34,095
Stop!

207
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:36,797
This is not about learning
to throw a punch.

208
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,181
This is about learning

209
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:40,967
to control
your strength.

210
00:10:44,356 --> 00:10:46,523
First water slapping,
now this.

211
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:47,774
When are you going
to run out of ways

212
00:10:47,776 --> 00:10:50,277
to make me look stupid?!

213
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:54,114
All I'm learning is new ways
to get pissed off.

214
00:10:54,116 --> 00:10:55,365
And in case
you haven't noticed,

215
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:56,800
I'm already
pretty good at that.

216
00:10:56,802 --> 00:10:58,118
There's nothing wrong
with anger, Roy.

217
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,870
Anger is energy.
But you need to learn

218
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:02,572
to channel it
in a positive way.

219
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:05,325
Like putting the hurt on guys
going after the city.

220
00:11:05,327 --> 00:11:08,411
Let me try hitting something
that'll actually hit back.

221
00:11:08,413 --> 00:11:09,463
Too soon.

222
00:11:09,465 --> 00:11:11,164
Get me out there
with you.

223
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,300
One night.

224
00:11:13,302 --> 00:11:16,853
All this, it would be
a lot easier to take.

225
00:11:26,097 --> 00:11:28,482
Moira.

226
00:11:30,234 --> 00:11:33,136
Ah. I didn't realize
we'd have company.

227
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:35,105
This is Mark Frances.

228
00:11:35,107 --> 00:11:36,806
Mark's CFO at Kardak Holdings.

229
00:11:36,808 --> 00:11:38,792
We've been putting
in some hours

230
00:11:38,794 --> 00:11:40,310
with the party's
election steering committee.

231
00:11:40,312 --> 00:11:42,362
Oh.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

232
00:11:42,364 --> 00:11:45,332
Those are words I'm not
accustomed to hearing these days.

233
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:47,701
Oh, well.

234
00:11:47,703 --> 00:11:50,337
You were a lioness doing what
she had to do to protect her cubs.

235
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,539
You know, I'm not
the only person in Starling

236
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,824
who sees it that way.
That's a comfort.

237
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:56,376
It's the truth.
Please.

238
00:11:56,378 --> 00:11:58,845
Thank you.

239
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:03,183
Well, it's unlike you to show
such an interest in politics, Walter.

240
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:06,553
It's part of my new position
at the Starling National Bank.

241
00:12:06,555 --> 00:12:08,889
My Board of Directors
is very concerned

242
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:10,891
about the trajectory
of the city.

243
00:12:10,893 --> 00:12:13,226
You mean Sebastian Blood.
Yeah.

244
00:12:13,228 --> 00:12:15,529
We believe that his policies
will bankrupt Starling

245
00:12:15,531 --> 00:12:17,030
within the next
eight months.

246
00:12:17,032 --> 00:12:18,565
Not that the average
voter cares.

247
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:20,200
They're all caught up
in his charisma.

248
00:12:20,202 --> 00:12:22,786
And he's not running
against a viable opponent.

249
00:12:22,788 --> 00:12:25,989
Blood's trounced every potential
candidate we've focus-tested.

250
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:28,625
But we believe that he's vulnerable
on regulation.

251
00:12:28,627 --> 00:12:31,294
Even if he is,
it hardly matters.

252
00:12:31,296 --> 00:12:34,697
Banking regulations
are an SEC issue.

253
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:39,085
Starling City needs to use
the means at a city's disposal.

254
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:43,673
Walter
said you were smart.

255
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:48,261
But you didn't invite me to dinner
to hear my opinions.

256
00:12:48,263 --> 00:12:51,765
You want to hear
my positions.

257
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:55,185
You want me to run
against Sebastian Blood.

258
00:12:57,939 --> 00:13:01,724
I'm starving.
Where are we going?

259
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:04,527
It's little hole in
the wall right here.

260
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:19,626
Laurel, wait.

261
00:13:19,628 --> 00:13:22,512
Don't touch me.

262
00:13:22,514 --> 00:13:24,580
I can't believe you would
do something like this.

263
00:13:24,582 --> 00:13:26,132
Well, you wouldn't
have come otherwise.

264
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:27,801
Well, you got that right.
Laurel, you need help.

265
00:13:27,803 --> 00:13:29,469
Not from them.

266
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,471
There is not one
person in that room

267
00:13:31,473 --> 00:13:33,256
who knows what I
have been through.

268
00:13:33,258 --> 00:13:34,941
Yeah, you're right.
Some of them,

269
00:13:34,943 --> 00:13:36,610
they've been through worse.
But for better or worse,

270
00:13:36,612 --> 00:13:38,662
everyone in that room
needs to be there,

271
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:40,614
and you need to be there.

272
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:43,533
You think you're the only person,

273
00:13:43,535 --> 00:13:46,820
who ever got fired, who ever
got their lives into a mess?

274
00:13:46,822 --> 00:13:48,705
You think again, kiddo,
'cause you're not.

275
00:13:48,707 --> 00:13:51,825
Now, look, we're here now.

276
00:13:51,827 --> 00:13:53,710
So why don't you just
stay for a bit?

277
00:13:53,712 --> 00:13:56,997
You don't have to share
or talk. You just listen.

278
00:13:56,999 --> 00:14:00,400
I thought I made
myself clear.

279
00:14:00,402 --> 00:14:02,886
I'm hungry.

280
00:14:02,888 --> 00:14:05,338
And now I think
I'll eat alone.

281
00:14:12,848 --> 00:14:15,598
Go ahead.

282
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,568
SCPD's network
just lit up with a fresh homicide,

283
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,438
multiple stab wounds.
Like claw marks.

284
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,682
The victim was an architect.

285
00:14:22,707 --> 00:14:25,340
Turner ransacked his place;
Took blueprints of his designs.

286
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:28,978
One of the aforementioned
designs--Malcolm Merlyn's house.

287
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,881
I don't know much about architecture,
but this can't be good.

288
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:34,084
What would Turner want
with Merlyn's house?

289
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:35,651
Not sure yet. All of
Malcolm's holdings,

290
00:14:35,653 --> 00:14:37,587
including the house,
are in receivership.

291
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:39,706
Who's that
you're talking to?

292
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,825
Oh, wait, let me guess, you can't
tell me that, either.

293
00:14:42,827 --> 00:14:44,818
A guy that I put in prison
got out,

294
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,558
and I have an idea
where he's headed.

295
00:14:51,253 --> 00:14:53,186
Do you have one
of your hoodies?

296
00:14:53,188 --> 00:14:55,972
Do you seriously
have to ask?

297
00:14:58,859 --> 00:15:01,778
Whatever happens,
whoever we run into,

298
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,531
do not engage.

299
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:08,068
And don't touch anything.

300
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,137
This is his kid,
right?

301
00:15:13,124 --> 00:15:15,075
The guy that died?

302
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:18,445
Yes.

303
00:15:19,914 --> 00:15:22,248
You know your way
around this place.

304
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,084
You been here
before?

305
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,473
What was that?

306
00:15:30,475 --> 00:15:32,809
It came from underground.

307
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:34,144
Merlyn has a large garage.

308
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:36,563
Let's go.

309
00:15:59,987 --> 00:16:02,789
What the hell is that?

310
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,090
Looks like a prototype.

311
00:16:04,092 --> 00:16:06,409
Of what?

312
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:08,762
A machine that
killed 503 people.

313
00:16:08,764 --> 00:16:12,582
Merlyn's own
earthquake device.

314
00:16:12,584 --> 00:16:14,934
Ok, a simple
snatch and grab.

315
00:16:14,936 --> 00:16:16,419
Don't know
why Mr. Armitage

316
00:16:16,421 --> 00:16:18,221
thought
we needed you.

317
00:16:18,223 --> 00:16:19,806
For that.

318
00:16:28,365 --> 00:16:31,651
Step away
from the device.

319
00:16:31,653 --> 00:16:34,871
You don't know
what it is you're dealing with.

320
00:16:34,873 --> 00:16:36,790
Big machine, makes earthquakes?

321
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:38,324
Do you have any idea
what happens

322
00:16:38,326 --> 00:16:39,993
if the wrong people
have it?

323
00:16:39,995 --> 00:16:42,045
Yeah. I get paid.

324
00:16:42,047 --> 00:16:45,048
Close it up.

325
00:17:05,303 --> 00:17:08,021
That thing killed
eight of my friends.

326
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,288
Hey!

327
00:17:43,475 --> 00:17:45,129
Uh-oh. You got angry face.

328
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,263
What happened?

329
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,930
Roy Harper.

330
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:49,147
You took him
out in the field--

331
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:50,732
He wasn't listening
to me, Diggle!

332
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:52,535
I'm trying  to reach him,
but he lost control.

333
00:17:52,536 --> 00:17:54,435
Then he nearly
killed somebody,

334
00:17:54,437 --> 00:17:56,871
which I obviously couldn't let happen,
and in the process--

335
00:17:56,873 --> 00:17:58,490
Turner got away.

336
00:17:58,492 --> 00:18:00,792
What was he there to steal?
Merlyn's art collection?

337
00:18:00,794 --> 00:18:03,712
Something much
more dangerous.

338
00:18:03,714 --> 00:18:05,880
It's a prototype
earthquake machine.

339
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:08,033
Oh, holy God.

340
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:09,718
Why would Turner
want to destroy the city?

341
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,137
He doesn't.
He's a mercenary

342
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:13,638
selling his services
to the highest bidder.

343
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,106
This watch belonged
to one of the guys

344
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:16,958
Turner was working with.
Fingerprints.

345
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,844
Turner's a loner, which mean
that guy works for his client.

346
00:18:19,846 --> 00:18:21,730
Fingerprints equals name,
equals known associates.

347
00:18:21,732 --> 00:18:22,964
I'm on it.

348
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:25,166
It was the look
in Roy's eyes.

349
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:27,702
It was Slade
all over again.

350
00:18:27,704 --> 00:18:29,337
Oliver,
what happened with Slade?

351
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:31,256
Me.

352
00:18:31,258 --> 00:18:32,691
Someone killed Shado.

353
00:18:32,693 --> 00:18:36,695
Slade loved Shado,
and it was my fault.

354
00:18:38,414 --> 00:18:39,948
I wanted to tell him,

355
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,783
because it would have been better
coming from me,

356
00:18:41,785 --> 00:18:43,852
but I didn't.

357
00:18:43,854 --> 00:18:46,004
And he found out another way.

358
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,874
If I had just
told him the truth,

359
00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:51,960
I could have gotten
through to him.

360
00:18:51,962 --> 00:18:54,162
And that's why it's so important
for you to get through to Roy.

361
00:18:54,164 --> 00:18:56,731
I lived
a five year nightmare.

362
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:59,351
But if I learn
something

363
00:18:59,353 --> 00:19:03,138
that could help me
reach Roy now...

364
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:08,360
It'll all be worth it.

365
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:17,202
He's not here.

366
00:19:17,204 --> 00:19:19,571
Where else could he be?
We already checked the plane.

367
00:19:19,573 --> 00:19:22,707
I don't know.

368
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,079
Do you remember
seeing these before?

369
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:29,798
I didn't really look around.

370
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,000
They look familiar.

371
00:19:32,002 --> 00:19:34,202
This could be Lian Yu.

372
00:19:34,204 --> 00:19:36,087
No, I mean
the calculations.

373
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:37,538
I've seen those before.

374
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,257
Maybe the first
time you were in the cave.

375
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:41,059
I don't think so.

376
00:19:41,061 --> 00:19:43,061
Fyer's launcher.
What?

377
00:19:43,063 --> 00:19:45,230
Oh, there were soldiers
on the island last year,

378
00:19:45,232 --> 00:19:47,599
and they had a missile launcher.
I saw one of these

379
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:50,935
on the display.
They're firing calculations...

380
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:54,689
He's going to blow it up.

381
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:56,574
Blow what up?

382
00:19:56,576 --> 00:19:59,694
The freighter.

383
00:20:06,235 --> 00:20:08,253
Oh, thank God you're here,
I need your help--

384
00:20:08,255 --> 00:20:11,239
I have to talk to you.
It's important.

385
00:20:11,241 --> 00:20:14,175
Ok. You look stressed out,
is everything ok?

386
00:20:14,177 --> 00:20:16,044
You have to leave town.

387
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:18,847
Grab your mother and your brother,
if you can, and leave.

388
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:20,181
It's just for a few days.

389
00:20:20,183 --> 00:20:22,016
A reason
would be nice.

390
00:20:22,018 --> 00:20:23,351
I need you to trust me, Thea.

391
00:20:23,353 --> 00:20:25,053
I do. I just--

392
00:20:25,055 --> 00:20:27,021
I can't up and leave
with my family without a reason.

393
00:20:27,023 --> 00:20:28,306
No, you have to.

394
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:29,974
Roy, you're not

395
00:20:29,976 --> 00:20:31,609
making any sense
right now.

396
00:20:31,611 --> 00:20:32,777
Would you just tell
me what's going on?

397
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:33,812
Why aren't you listening to me?

398
00:20:33,814 --> 00:20:36,114
I need you to listen to me!

399
00:20:36,116 --> 00:20:39,617
Roy, you're
hurting me!

400
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:42,120
I didn't...I didn't...

401
00:20:42,122 --> 00:20:44,289
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

402
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,907
I know!

403
00:20:56,837 --> 00:20:58,786
Well. Your work
environment

404
00:20:58,788 --> 00:21:01,789
has definitely
improved since CNRI.

405
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,625
This place is bigger
than my apartment!

406
00:21:04,627 --> 00:21:07,061
Well, there is a limit to
the glamour, unfortunately.

407
00:21:07,063 --> 00:21:09,731
I spend my days
in document production--

408
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:12,851
And answering interrogatories.

409
00:21:12,853 --> 00:21:15,186
It doesn't feel like
practicing law so much as

410
00:21:15,188 --> 00:21:17,179
pushing papers.

411
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,219
If I didn't know any better,

412
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:20,684
I'd think that you were trying
to talk me out of the job here.

413
00:21:23,028 --> 00:21:25,997
I guess I do know better.

414
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:28,199
I'm sorry.

415
00:21:28,201 --> 00:21:30,818
What's going on?

416
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,037
One of the partners
serves on

417
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,206
the bar association's
disciplinary committee,

418
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:38,064
and...Well, when
I sent your résume,

419
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,828
he did some checking.

420
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:42,347
That was a complete
misunderstanding.

421
00:21:42,349 --> 00:21:44,682
I mean, sure, yeah,
I had some problems,

422
00:21:44,684 --> 00:21:47,302
but I'm fine now.

423
00:21:47,304 --> 00:21:51,556
The bar is going
to open disciplinary proceedings.

424
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:52,857
What for?

425
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:54,259
Conduct affecting

426
00:21:54,261 --> 00:21:56,060
your fitness
to practice.

427
00:21:56,062 --> 00:21:58,062
That's--
that's ridiculous.

428
00:21:58,064 --> 00:21:59,347
I know.

429
00:21:59,349 --> 00:22:02,951
But while
this is out there,

430
00:22:02,953 --> 00:22:07,322
the firm
can't hire you.

431
00:22:07,324 --> 00:22:08,740
Thanks.

432
00:22:08,742 --> 00:22:12,410
Thanks for letting me know.
I have to go.

433
00:22:12,412 --> 00:22:14,662
Laurel, Laurel.

434
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:16,331
You can fight this, ok?

435
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,299
I'll help you, and--

436
00:22:18,301 --> 00:22:21,002
I need some time to...process.

437
00:22:21,004 --> 00:22:23,137
I'll call you.

438
00:22:25,674 --> 00:22:27,091
Can I fix you a drink?

439
00:22:27,093 --> 00:22:28,309
Whatever
you're having.

440
00:22:28,311 --> 00:22:29,811
It was good
to see you

441
00:22:29,813 --> 00:22:31,012
the other night,
Moira.

442
00:22:31,014 --> 00:22:32,680
It was lovely.

443
00:22:32,682 --> 00:22:36,067
It's been a while
since I've had such a good laugh.

444
00:22:36,069 --> 00:22:37,986
It was
no joke, Moira.

445
00:22:37,988 --> 00:22:40,054
Mark was telling
the truth.

446
00:22:40,056 --> 00:22:42,223
A significant number of people
in Starling City

447
00:22:42,225 --> 00:22:45,076
feel that your actions
with Malcolm Merlyn

448
00:22:45,078 --> 00:22:47,195
were justified to
protect your family.

449
00:22:47,197 --> 00:22:49,330
43.6%, in fact.

450
00:22:49,332 --> 00:22:50,782
You polled people about me?

451
00:22:50,784 --> 00:22:52,166
Prudent course of
action when vetting

452
00:22:52,168 --> 00:22:53,835
a potential
candidate, yes.

453
00:22:53,837 --> 00:22:56,955
600,000 people in Starling City.

454
00:22:56,957 --> 00:22:59,457
I'd think you could find
someone not responsible

455
00:22:59,459 --> 00:23:01,843
for destroying it
with an earthquake machine.

456
00:23:01,845 --> 00:23:04,245
Not with your
name recognition.

457
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:07,966
We need a game change
candidate, Moira.

458
00:23:07,968 --> 00:23:10,468
And there's no one in Starling
with a higher profile than you.

459
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,387
Charles Manson
is rather well-known,

460
00:23:12,389 --> 00:23:14,939
and no one is going to vote for him.
True.

461
00:23:14,941 --> 00:23:17,609
Equally true, voters like
redemption stories.

462
00:23:17,611 --> 00:23:20,645
Bill Clinton,
Elliot Spitzer,

463
00:23:20,647 --> 00:23:21,946
Martha Stewart.

464
00:23:21,948 --> 00:23:23,698
Oh, I don't believe
she ran for office.

465
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,400
But if she had,
she would have won.

466
00:23:25,402 --> 00:23:26,734
Would have won what?

467
00:23:26,736 --> 00:23:29,954
Ah, Thea.

468
00:23:29,956 --> 00:23:32,123
Mmm, what's going on?

469
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:35,543
I'm just convincing
your mother to run for mayor.

470
00:23:35,545 --> 00:23:36,828
Of what?

471
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,047
You see?

472
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:40,548
Sweetheart, are you all right?

473
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:44,302
You really need
to stop asking that.

474
00:23:44,304 --> 00:23:46,588
Are you serious?

475
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,556
It's hard to believe, I know.

476
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:50,625
No. No, it's not.

477
00:23:50,627 --> 00:23:53,961
Look, this is actually
the first election I can vote in,

478
00:23:53,963 --> 00:23:57,131
and...as a newly
minted voter,

479
00:23:57,133 --> 00:23:59,517
I don't think it
sounds that crazy.

480
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:03,905
From out of the mouths
of babes.

481
00:24:11,747 --> 00:24:14,482
You're late.

482
00:24:14,484 --> 00:24:17,502
I tried to get
my girlfriend to leave town.

483
00:24:17,504 --> 00:24:20,421
But she won't.

484
00:24:20,423 --> 00:24:24,659
You cannot bring her into this.

485
00:24:24,661 --> 00:24:26,661
But how am I
supposed to lie to her

486
00:24:26,663 --> 00:24:28,262
and protect her
at the same time?

487
00:24:28,264 --> 00:24:30,181
How do you do it?

488
00:24:30,183 --> 00:24:32,833
How do you keep secrets
from people in your life?

489
00:24:32,835 --> 00:24:36,104
By remembering
it's the only way to keep them safe.

490
00:24:36,106 --> 00:24:38,723
No, keeping them safe
is what keeps them safe.

491
00:24:38,725 --> 00:24:40,224
Telling people
the truth.

492
00:24:40,226 --> 00:24:41,842
But you, you won't
tell me anything.

493
00:24:41,844 --> 00:24:44,195
Not about the Mirakuru,
and this other guy.

494
00:24:44,197 --> 00:24:46,230
And you got me slapping
water and hitting dummies instead.

495
00:24:46,232 --> 00:24:49,734
Roy, you're spiraling
and you need to calm down.

496
00:24:49,736 --> 00:24:52,203
No. I need
to save Thea.

497
00:24:52,205 --> 00:24:55,740
That thing is out
in the open because of you.

498
00:24:55,742 --> 00:24:57,291
I think you've done enough.

499
00:24:57,293 --> 00:24:59,293
Let go of me.

500
00:24:59,295 --> 00:25:01,612
Roy...
I said let go of me!

501
00:25:01,614 --> 00:25:03,948
Get control.

502
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,134
If not for me or yourself,

503
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:07,752
then do it for Thea.

504
00:25:07,754 --> 00:25:09,587
What the hell
do you know about Thea?

505
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:11,806
Don't you talk about her!

506
00:25:17,262 --> 00:25:19,897
Are you done?

507
00:25:27,856 --> 00:25:30,558
No. I'm not done.

508
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,393
I'm going
to stop this thing.

509
00:25:32,395 --> 00:25:34,278
And if you want
to stop me, try.

510
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,831
Try putting another arrow
in me. Go ahead.

511
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:39,851
'Cause I heal fast now.
But get in my way,

512
00:25:39,853 --> 00:25:42,286
then I'll give you a good look at that
anger you're so worried

513
00:25:42,288 --> 00:25:44,255
about me
losing control of.

514
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:56,927
You both scoffed
when I said we should invest

515
00:25:56,929 --> 00:25:58,898
in an X-ray machine
for down here.

516
00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:00,399
What do you want
to do about Roy?

517
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,601
Where are we
with the fingerprint?

518
00:26:04,603 --> 00:26:06,603
I struck out
on domestic agencies,

519
00:26:06,605 --> 00:26:08,638
but I'm checking Interpol,
PRC public security

520
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,974
and MVD databases now.

521
00:26:10,976 --> 00:26:14,210
Oliver, I know
you've taken Roy on, and why,

522
00:26:14,212 --> 00:26:17,113
but Roy, Slade,
a lot of guys I've served with...

523
00:26:18,951 --> 00:26:21,100
Some people
are just broken, man.

524
00:26:21,102 --> 00:26:22,935
And nobody can put them
back together.

525
00:26:22,937 --> 00:26:25,605
I refuse
to believe that.

526
00:26:25,607 --> 00:26:28,875
I'm not letting what
happened to Slade happen to Roy.

527
00:26:28,877 --> 00:26:31,244
I'm not.

528
00:26:39,804 --> 00:26:41,588
Yeah.

529
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,557
Are you near the club?

530
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,677
I'm pretty close. Why?

531
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,896
Laurel's here.

532
00:26:49,898 --> 00:26:52,098
She doesn't look good.

533
00:26:53,684 --> 00:26:56,903
Hey. Laurel's
upstairs.

534
00:27:07,181 --> 00:27:08,548
Ohh! Excuse me.

535
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,533
Can I get something with olives?

536
00:27:10,535 --> 00:27:14,504
I don't care what it is, as long as
there are a lot of olives.

537
00:27:14,506 --> 00:27:16,373
How about coffee?

538
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:18,458
Coffee and olives?

539
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,428
Bad combination.

540
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,496
What are you doing?

541
00:27:23,498 --> 00:27:25,665
This is where it's happening,
right? The big club?

542
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:27,851
Here you go,
Martini, triple olives.

543
00:27:27,853 --> 00:27:29,469
Thanks.

544
00:27:29,471 --> 00:27:31,187
Laurel, go home.

545
00:27:31,189 --> 00:27:33,940
Thea Queen, telling me

546
00:27:33,942 --> 00:27:35,608
enough is enough.

547
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:38,695
Now that is rich.

548
00:27:43,067 --> 00:27:45,652
Fine.

549
00:27:45,654 --> 00:27:47,787
Bar me from your bar.

550
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:49,572
That's today's theme,
right?

551
00:27:49,574 --> 00:27:51,324
Disbarment.

552
00:27:51,326 --> 00:27:52,709
Laurel, are you being disbarred?

553
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:55,128
Yeah, looks like
my law career's over.

554
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,663
But you know what?

555
00:27:56,665 --> 00:28:00,533
Maybe Thea here can
hire me as a waitress.

556
00:28:00,535 --> 00:28:03,136
Or, Ollie, I could
come be your secretary.

557
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:05,555
But that would mean you
would have to fire her.

558
00:28:05,557 --> 00:28:07,841
Hi, Laurel. How are you?

559
00:28:10,895 --> 00:28:14,481
Did you need
to borrow my car?

560
00:28:14,483 --> 00:28:16,066
Did your limo
break down?

561
00:28:16,068 --> 00:28:17,767
Oliver, can I talk to you
for a second?

562
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:20,987
Get her a cab, please.

563
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,241
Fingerprint was in
Interpol's database.

564
00:28:25,243 --> 00:28:27,594
The guy worked
for Milo Armitage.

565
00:28:27,596 --> 00:28:29,162
He's a black market
arms merchant.

566
00:28:29,164 --> 00:28:30,780
He's trying
to sell the device.

567
00:28:30,782 --> 00:28:32,415
I need you to search
for any indication

568
00:28:32,417 --> 00:28:33,867
that Armitage
is in Starling.

569
00:28:33,869 --> 00:28:35,752
I already did.
His ship filed a loadlog manifest

570
00:28:35,754 --> 00:28:37,403
at the Starling City docks.

571
00:28:37,405 --> 00:28:39,172
I'll get you
the slip number.

572
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:53,303
Hi, it's Oliver.

573
00:28:53,305 --> 00:28:56,356
I just ran into Laurel,
and something's wrong.

574
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:01,311
She needs you.

575
00:29:03,147 --> 00:29:05,281
Slade?

576
00:29:05,283 --> 00:29:07,367
Oliver...

577
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:09,869
Slade!

578
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:11,321
Get back!

579
00:29:11,323 --> 00:29:13,623
We know you're
targeting the boat.

580
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:16,159
I'm going to send
that son of a bitch

581
00:29:16,161 --> 00:29:17,994
to the bottom of the ocean.

582
00:29:17,996 --> 00:29:20,163
You're going to destroy our only
way off of the island!

583
00:29:20,165 --> 00:29:23,333
As long as Ivo is dead,
it's worth it.

584
00:29:27,755 --> 00:29:29,556
I can't let you do it.

585
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:31,641
Get back, or so help me,

586
00:29:31,643 --> 00:29:33,927
I will put you down!

587
00:29:35,346 --> 00:29:37,463
Mom? What
are you doing here?

588
00:29:37,465 --> 00:29:39,482
I came by to get
your advice on something.

589
00:29:39,484 --> 00:29:41,017
Step into my office.

590
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:42,635
Ahh.

591
00:29:42,637 --> 00:29:44,988
This is about
the campaign, right?

592
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,524
It's really awesome
you're thinking of doing this.

593
00:29:47,526 --> 00:29:50,577
You said something
that stayed with me.

594
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:54,013
The idea that there
could be voters out there

595
00:29:54,015 --> 00:29:57,450
that wouldn't dismiss me
out of hand.

596
00:29:57,452 --> 00:30:00,537
Well, you did run
a multi-billion dollar company.

597
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:02,839
Yes, and an undertaking
that destroyed the city.

598
00:30:02,841 --> 00:30:05,124
People will
get over that.

599
00:30:05,126 --> 00:30:06,759
What makes you so certain?

600
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:09,179
Because I did.

601
00:30:09,181 --> 00:30:10,597
Can I make
a suggestion?

602
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:12,164
Instead of
punishing yourself

603
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:14,267
because you think
you destroyed the city,

604
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:17,387
how about you start
by saving it?

605
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,445
$10 million,

606
00:30:25,447 --> 00:30:28,698
I believe was
the negotiated amount.

607
00:30:30,384 --> 00:30:34,404
Congratulations, you're now
in a new tax bracket.

608
00:30:34,406 --> 00:30:36,623
Just out of curiosity,

609
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:40,243
you pay me ten million,
and you get...

610
00:30:40,245 --> 00:30:42,528
Three times that.

611
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:45,215
You already
have a buyer?

612
00:30:45,217 --> 00:30:48,735
I recommend
that you stay clear

613
00:30:48,737 --> 00:30:51,221
of Markovia for a few months.

614
00:30:51,223 --> 00:30:54,073
I believe our business
is now concluded.

615
00:30:56,637 --> 00:30:58,638
Not yet.

616
00:31:06,654 --> 00:31:09,889
Looks like your partner
abandoned you.

617
00:31:09,891 --> 00:31:12,692
He's not my partner.
He's someone I hired

618
00:31:12,694 --> 00:31:15,495
to do a job.

619
00:31:15,497 --> 00:31:19,282
And it turns out
it was money well spent.

620
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,796
Just too dumb
to stay down.

621
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,724
Don't do it!
You'll kill everyone here.

622
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:45,594
If I don't deliver this device
to my buyer in Markovia,

623
00:31:45,596 --> 00:31:48,346
I'm dead anyway.
No!

624
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,286
Roy! I need you help!

625
00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:05,869
Roy, stop!

626
00:32:05,894 --> 00:32:08,695
Roy! Roy,
I need you to stop!

627
00:32:11,654 --> 00:32:14,673
The earthquake device
is in there.

628
00:32:14,675 --> 00:32:17,075
The steel is military grade;
It's built to withstand a bomb,

629
00:32:17,077 --> 00:32:20,178
but not you.

630
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,747
Think about Thea.

631
00:32:22,749 --> 00:32:25,684
Because she could die
without your help.

632
00:32:25,686 --> 00:32:27,052
I know you love her...

633
00:32:27,054 --> 00:32:29,804
Because I've seen it.

634
00:32:29,806 --> 00:32:32,357
Save my sister.

635
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:35,143
Control.

636
00:32:35,145 --> 00:32:38,196
Focus on Thea.

637
00:32:38,198 --> 00:32:40,899
She needs you right now,

638
00:32:40,901 --> 00:32:42,200
or she is dead.

639
00:32:42,202 --> 00:32:44,519
Everyone is dead.

640
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:11,579
You're...

641
00:33:11,581 --> 00:33:14,416
Yeah. Yeah.

642
00:33:14,418 --> 00:33:17,652
Last year,
you saved my life.

643
00:33:17,654 --> 00:33:20,105
And I don't mean
from the guy who kidnapped me.

644
00:33:20,107 --> 00:33:22,974
I mean, you...
you saved me.

645
00:33:22,976 --> 00:33:26,644
You gave me purpose.

646
00:33:34,954 --> 00:33:37,322
We're just getting started.

647
00:33:44,908 --> 00:33:47,610
So...The secret society
gets a new member.

648
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:53,094
Where is he now?

649
00:33:53,095 --> 00:33:54,794
Home.

650
00:33:54,796 --> 00:33:57,263
He's, uh...

651
00:33:57,265 --> 00:33:59,766
Processing.

652
00:33:59,768 --> 00:34:01,834
When I found out
who you really were,

653
00:34:01,836 --> 00:34:05,171
I processed my way
through a pint of mint chip.

654
00:34:06,674 --> 00:34:07,974
I stress eat.

655
00:34:07,976 --> 00:34:10,727
Speaking of stress...

656
00:34:10,729 --> 00:34:14,063
I'm not trying to Monday morning
quarterback here--it's Wednesday.

657
00:34:14,065 --> 00:34:16,733
Didn't this all start
because you were worried

658
00:34:16,735 --> 00:34:19,819
that Roy's marble collection
was on the short side?

659
00:34:19,821 --> 00:34:21,621
She has a point,
Oliver.

660
00:34:21,623 --> 00:34:24,707
Roy's a loose cannon. Now he
knows your secret.

661
00:34:24,709 --> 00:34:27,744
You're right,
and I wasn't thinking

662
00:34:27,746 --> 00:34:30,096
about the consequences.

663
00:34:30,098 --> 00:34:35,201
I only knew that
I needed his strength.

664
00:34:35,203 --> 00:34:37,987
His power.

665
00:34:40,141 --> 00:34:42,041
On the island,

666
00:34:42,043 --> 00:34:47,597
Sara told me that love
is the most powerful emotion.

667
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,383
Well, the Arrow
couldn't get Roy

668
00:34:50,385 --> 00:34:54,204
to think about Thea.

669
00:34:54,206 --> 00:34:57,190
But I could.

670
00:34:59,326 --> 00:35:02,562
I said get back!

671
00:35:02,564 --> 00:35:04,063
Think about Shado.

672
00:35:06,733 --> 00:35:08,901
I am...

673
00:35:08,903 --> 00:35:11,287
Thinking about her!

674
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:14,090
There's something
I have to tell you about Shado.

675
00:35:14,092 --> 00:35:17,243
It's something
you deserve to know.

676
00:35:21,131 --> 00:35:23,183
She loved you,
Slade.

677
00:35:23,185 --> 00:35:27,086
Maybe not the way
that you wanted her to,

678
00:35:27,088 --> 00:35:28,721
but she loved you.

679
00:35:28,723 --> 00:35:31,774
And she wanted you
to make it home.

680
00:35:31,776 --> 00:35:34,861
She wanted you
to see Joe again.

681
00:35:34,863 --> 00:35:38,264
She wanted you
to hug your son.

682
00:35:40,818 --> 00:35:43,536
I know you're angry.

683
00:35:43,538 --> 00:35:46,706
And I know
you want revenge.

684
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:49,542
If you destroy
Ivo's freighter,

685
00:35:49,544 --> 00:35:51,995
Shado will have
died for nothing.

686
00:36:05,726 --> 00:36:09,012
What is happening to me?

687
00:36:09,014 --> 00:36:11,014
I don't know.

688
00:36:11,016 --> 00:36:13,633
I am not going
to let you go through it

689
00:36:13,635 --> 00:36:16,135
on your own.

690
00:36:16,137 --> 00:36:18,137
The man who killed Shado

691
00:36:18,139 --> 00:36:20,156
is still out there.

692
00:36:20,158 --> 00:36:22,942
And whether that freighter's
on the bottom of the ocean or not,

693
00:36:22,944 --> 00:36:26,913
we're still suck
on this island.

694
00:36:26,915 --> 00:36:28,865
Not for long.

695
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:36,205
Because we're going
to take the freighter.

696
00:36:48,469 --> 00:36:51,721
I was glad
to receive your email.

697
00:36:51,723 --> 00:36:53,640
Does it portend
what I'm hoping?

698
00:36:53,642 --> 00:36:56,175
I'm going to run.

699
00:36:56,177 --> 00:36:59,946
What changed your mind?

700
00:36:59,948 --> 00:37:01,564
Thea.
Hmm.

701
00:37:01,566 --> 00:37:04,233
She reminded me that
I still owe this city.

702
00:37:04,235 --> 00:37:07,153
And I want to be remembered
as something more

703
00:37:07,155 --> 00:37:09,072
than Malcolm Merlyn's pawn.

704
00:37:09,074 --> 00:37:10,623
As you should.

705
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:12,241
But you know there was

706
00:37:12,243 --> 00:37:14,327
another reason
for my reticence.

707
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:16,045
You're afraid
the people will learn

708
00:37:16,047 --> 00:37:18,414
that Robert wasn't
her biological father.

709
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:21,250
I managed to get through a criminal
trial without the truth coming out,

710
00:37:21,252 --> 00:37:24,253
but political campaigns
tend to be a bit more adept

711
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:27,307
at extracting skeletons
from closets.

712
00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:28,708
But no one else knows.

713
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:31,027
Someone does.

714
00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:33,179
My ob, Dr. Gill.

715
00:37:33,181 --> 00:37:35,898
There were complications
when Thea was born,

716
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:40,520
and I had to tell him
that Robert wasn't her father.

717
00:37:40,522 --> 00:37:43,556
If we're going
to move forward,

718
00:37:43,558 --> 00:37:45,692
we need to make certain

719
00:37:45,694 --> 00:37:48,611
that he won't be
a problem for us.

720
00:37:48,613 --> 00:37:50,863
Hmm?

721
00:38:02,326 --> 00:38:04,711
Mr. Turner.

722
00:38:08,298 --> 00:38:10,433
Hmm.

723
00:38:10,435 --> 00:38:14,587
I didn't know this place
allowed conjugal visits.

724
00:38:16,423 --> 00:38:18,975
My name is Amanda Waller.

725
00:38:18,977 --> 00:38:20,360
You say that like it's supposed
to mean something.

726
00:38:20,362 --> 00:38:22,729
To the contrary.

727
00:38:22,731 --> 00:38:24,981
My identity
is highly classified.

728
00:38:24,983 --> 00:38:27,550
Then why are you
introducing yourself to me?

729
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:29,602
I have an offer for you.

730
00:38:29,604 --> 00:38:32,321
A way to work off your sentence.

731
00:38:32,323 --> 00:38:34,340
As it turns out,
I have need of someone

732
00:38:34,342 --> 00:38:36,359
with your...

733
00:38:36,361 --> 00:38:39,095
singular qualifications.

734
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:41,130
For what?

735
00:38:41,132 --> 00:38:43,249
For a unit
I'm putting together.

736
00:38:43,251 --> 00:38:46,085
What type of unit?

737
00:38:46,087 --> 00:38:48,755
Actually...

738
00:38:48,757 --> 00:38:52,759
It's more of a squad.

739
00:38:55,345 --> 00:38:58,564
Is this the part where you kill me
'cause I know your secret?

740
00:38:58,566 --> 00:39:01,017
Do you actually think
that I'd kill my sister's boyfriend?

741
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:02,635
Well, you did shoot me
in the leg.

742
00:39:02,637 --> 00:39:06,239
Forgiven, by the way.

743
00:39:06,241 --> 00:39:08,191
Thea.

744
00:39:08,193 --> 00:39:10,276
She can never know.

745
00:39:10,278 --> 00:39:12,912
I get the feeling
that if I did tell her,

746
00:39:12,914 --> 00:39:14,914
that would be when you kill me.

747
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:16,199
Trust that instinct.

748
00:39:16,201 --> 00:39:17,983
Ok. All right.

749
00:39:17,985 --> 00:39:19,952
How many people know what--

750
00:39:19,954 --> 00:39:21,621
who you are?

751
00:39:21,623 --> 00:39:23,256
Too many.

752
00:39:23,258 --> 00:39:26,325
But these are the only
two that matter.

753
00:39:30,214 --> 00:39:34,166
John Diggle
and Felicity Smoak.

754
00:39:36,604 --> 00:39:38,604
Does this group have a name?

755
00:39:38,606 --> 00:39:40,723
Like team Arrow,
or something?

756
00:39:40,725 --> 00:39:41,974
We don't call
ourselves that.

757
00:39:41,976 --> 00:39:44,143
I do. Occasionally.

758
00:39:44,145 --> 00:39:46,729
Stop.
Whatever.

759
00:39:46,731 --> 00:39:48,481
Welcome aboard.

760
00:40:29,506 --> 00:40:31,991
Sara...

761
00:40:32,016 --> 00:40:37,016
