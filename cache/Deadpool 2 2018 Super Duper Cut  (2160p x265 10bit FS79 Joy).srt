1
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,049
<i>Fuck Wolverine.</i>

2
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,762
<i>First, he rides my coattails
with the R rating.</i>

3
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,929
<i>Then the hairy motherfucker
ups the ante by dying.</i>

4
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,060
<i>What a dick.</i>

5
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,349
<i>Well, guess what, Wolvie?</i>

6
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,726
<i>I'm dying in this one, too.</i>

7
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,736
<i>To understand
why I took a cat-nap</i>

8
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,905
<i>on 1,200 gallons
of high-test fuel...</i>

9
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,278
<i>I need to take you back</i>

10
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,701
<i>to the dewy slopes
of six weeks ago.</i>

11
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,069
<i>I'd gone international,</i>

12
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,121
<i>taking out mass murderers,
gangsters,</i>

13
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,573
<i>unspeakable monsters.</i>

14
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,667
<i>People nobody would touch.
Except me.</i>

15
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,832
<i>I'm gonna touch them all over.</i>

16
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,417
<i>Hey, it's Gail calling.</i>

17
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,593
<i>Love the shiny suit.</i>

18
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,680
<i>Really brings out</i>

19
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,300
<i>the sex trafficker in your eyes.</i>

20
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,553
Whatever they're paying,
I'll double it.

21
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,764
I don't
speak Cantonese, Mister...

22
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,812
Well, I'm not even gonna
attempt that.

23
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,516
But I did take 8th grade Spanish,
so...

24
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,689
Donde esta la biblioteca?
25
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,812
Which literally translates to...

26
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,232
I don't bargain, pumpkin fucker.

27
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,128
Oh. Oh, this isn't Gilbert's.

28
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,420
I am so sorry.

29
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,187
I thought this was
an anal-bleaching party.

30
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,154
Don't worry.
You're not going to die.

31
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,653
Although these will kill you.

32
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:04,744
Hit it, Dolly.

33
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,630
I'm merely
a vessel for the Lord.

34
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,486
Taking the hands out
of the guns of the criminals!

35
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,533
Whoo! Do not go in there!

36
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,337
Let's see
Captain America do that.

37
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,798
Too exotic?

38
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,496
Donde esta la biblioteca?

39
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,888
Oh, God! Oh, God,
time out! Time out!

40
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,471
Cut. I've got bad guy blood,
right in my open eye.

41
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,306
Oh, that's so gross.

42
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:42,728
Fuck.

43
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,798
Looks like you left
a little landing strip there.

44
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,857
I like it.

45
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,611
Oh, man!

46
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,870
<i>My world tour brought me home</i>

47
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,293
<i>to this guy, Sergei Valishnikov.</i>

48
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:03,920
<i>But we'll get to him
in a moment.</i>

49
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,367
<i>'Cause I know
what you're thinking.</i>

50
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,213
<i>"I'm so glad
I left the kiddos at home."</i>

51
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,583
<i>But that's where you'd be wrong.</i>

52
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,676
<i>That babysitter of yours
is high as fuck right</i> now...

53
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:17,051
<i>and, believe it or not,
Deadpom 2 is a family film.</i>

54
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,180
<i>True story.</i>

55
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,139
<i>And every good family film
starts with a vicious murder.</i>

56
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,271
Bambi, The Lion King, Saw 7.

57
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,605
<i>Holy shit pickles!
That guy's on fire.</i>

58
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,565
<i>That's not CGI, folks.
He's actually on fire.</i>

59
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,994
<i>Yeah. You know I get paid
to take out bad guys, right?</i>

60
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,161
<i>But this guy?</i>

61
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,329
<i>He was one of the worst of 'em.</i>

62
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,492
<i>Hurry up and open
this fucking door,</i>

63
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,867
<i>and let's kill
this motherfucker!</i>

64
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,420
<i>Ugh. So gross.</i>

65
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,256
<i>A panic room? Really?</i>

66
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,929
Can you come out?

67
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,102
I really have to go.
It's my anniversary.

68
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,314
<i>Over
and over, I hear people say,</i>

69
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,885
<i>"I just don't have
enough confidence."</i>

70
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,110
<i>Listen, confidence is not
something you have.</i>

71
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,440
<i>It's something you create.</i>

72
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,526
<i>And you can create it
at any moment in time.</i>

73
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,323
<i>A sense of confidence is nothing</i>

74
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,766
<i>but a sense of power
within yourself...</i>

75
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,726
a <i>sense of certainty that
you can pull something off.</i>

76
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,787
Start the fucking car!

77
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:23,958
Dopinder!

78
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,581
Start the fucking car!

79
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,592
Shoot that motherfucker!
Shoot him!

80
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,294
Whoo!
Oh, I shit my pants.

81
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,721
Actually, that may have been me.

82
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,014
Oh, mission accomplished?

83
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,183
Oh, in a George W.
Sort of way.

84
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,931
Fucker can't stay
in a panic room forever.

85
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,433
Oh, you're living
the dreams, DP.

86
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,639
It has been
quite the run, Dopinder,

87
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:46,940
and who'd a thought?

88
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,064
Now I'm talked about
in the same sentence as Jesus.

89
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,403
<i>Passion of the Christ, then me.</i>

90
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,695
At least domestically.

91
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,943
We beat them overseas,

92
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,991
where there's no such thing
as religion.

93
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,239
I do want to live
the dreams, Pool Boy.

94
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,616
Taxiing is not as sexy
as it looks.

95
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,490
I want to fill my...
Pockets?

96
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,747
What's your poison?
A little, uh, cokey cokey?

97
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,123
Can't maintain an erection

98
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,624
without buying shoes online?

99
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,709
I've never experienced
that last one.

100
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,006
Talk to me, Goose.

101
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,881
I was going to say "soul".
I want to fill my soul.

102
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,929
I want to belong to something,
like you, Pool, sir.

103
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,589
Dopmdenu Hmm?

104
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,933
You never cease to surprise me.

105
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,059
You know, the depth of
your heart is extraordinary.

106
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,765
We all need
a sense of belonging.

107
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,600
We all need
a genuine sense of home.

108
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,775
A place in this world.

109
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,214
I want to become
a contract killer.

110
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,728
I'm sorry. What did you say?

111
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,026
Remember when I kidnapped Bandhu

112
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,470
and threatened him
with great violence?

113
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,825
You kind of killed him.

114
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,723
And then remember the movie
Interview <i>with</i> the Vampire?

115
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:41,862
Don't want to.

116
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:42,991
When Tom Cruise fed

117
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,869
10-year-old Kirsten Dunst blood

118
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,120
for the first time...

119
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,578
and she looked up at his smooth,

120
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,878
handsome face and said...

121
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,415
"I want some more."

122
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,128
Oh, Pool, picture me,
a 10-year-old Kirsten Dunst.

123
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,172
I'll never not picture that.

124
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,675
But I can't wait
to never speak of this,

125
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,134
as soon as possible.

126
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,346
We're here.

127
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,071
Dopinder, it's me again.

128
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,818
Look, a saner man
might discourage you

129
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,741
from joining
the deadly rnerc business...

130
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,239
what, with your concave chest

131
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,945
and your paper towel tube arms.

132
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,700
But you're an eagle...

133
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,748
and goddamn it,
an eagle's gotta soar.

134
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,166
You gotta grab those dreams,

135
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,835
grab those dreams
by the dick tip...

136
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,411
and make it rain!

137
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,372
I don't know what that means.

138
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,423
Me neither.

139
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,466
I'm gonna see you...

140
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,136
At the office.

141
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,804
In the sky.

142
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:42,926
You're my Tom Cruise!

143
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,633
And you're my Kristen Dunst!

144
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,967
Kristen? Kirsten?

145
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,816
Sorry I'm late.

146
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,438
There was a bunch of

147
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,566
handicapable children
stuck in a tree...

148
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,896
and I had to, uh...
Uh-uh.

149
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,907
You're right.
I was fighting a caped badass.

150
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,235
But then we discovered
his morn is named Martha, too.

151
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,328
You got me.
No.

152
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,508
I was rounding up
all the gluten in the world

153
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,784
and launching it into space...

154
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,826
where it can't not
hurt us ever again.

155
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,165
Try again.

156
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,166
Diarrhea?

157
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,100
We can't be sure
until I get this suit off...

158
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,008
but, uh, all signs point to yes.

159
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,930
Traffic?

160
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:23,592
Hmm?

161
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,391
Kiss me like you miss me, Red.

162
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,477
Well, come here.

163
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,940
I'm gonna shower
and get out of this suit.

164
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,861
Don't you want your surprise?

165
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,743
Do I look like
a patient burn victim?

166
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,778
I got one for you, too.

167
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,281
Happy anniversary, baby.

168
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,041
Open, open, Open-

169
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,377
Skee-Ball token.

170
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,170
Our first date.

171
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,497
Yup.

172
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,546
That's genuine, high-grade lead.

173
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,342
I'll keep it forever.

174
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,219
Thank you, baby.

175
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,560
Open yours.
All right, all right.

176
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,770
Oh...

177
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,045
That's just the most
beautiful thing that I've...

178
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,400
I don't know what this is.

179
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,977
My mo.

180
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,364
A bomb?

181
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,236
No, dick for brains.
My birth control device.

182
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,823
What, you mean that your...

183
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,576
Baby factory's open
for business.

184
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,744
Oh, my God!

185
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,206
Oh, my God! I want a boy!

186
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,125
Or a little girl!
Definitely one or the other!

187
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,208
Oh! And I want our kid
to have only one name.

188
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,336
Like Cher or Todd.

189
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,835
You gotta pump a baby
in me first, cowboy.

190
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:43,929
Yes, I do.

191
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,824
Let's watch some porn
and show that bed who's boss.

192
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:46,848
Let's do that.

193
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,515
Papa...

194
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,390
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

195
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,188
<i>Papa, can you see me?</i>

196
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,767
Does this song
sound familiar to you?

197
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,528
May.

198
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,992
Connor, if it's a boy.
May, if it's a girl.

199
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,031
So weird.

200
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,537
Family was always
an F-word to me.

201
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,254
My pile of shit father
took off and bailed.

202
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,632
I mean, it's not like I have
a lot of strong role models

203
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,426
to draw off of for Todd.

204
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,213
Hey. Look at me.

205
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,554
You are not your father.

206
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,682
Besides...

207
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:39,482
I will never, ever
let our child be named Todd.

208
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,486
But here's the thing,

209
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,107
isn't that how it always works?

210
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,938
Like in Star Wars,

211
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,070
men are destined
to become their father...

212
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,823
and then have consensual sex
with their sister?

213
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,325
I think you missed
big, big chunks of that movie.

214
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,457
No, I'm pretty sure
Luke nailed her.

215
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,160
Baby, that's Empire.

216
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,254
The point is, kids...

217
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,376
they give us a chance
to be better than we are.

218
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,336
Better than we used to be.

219
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,423
You're a lot smarter
than I look.

220
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,842
I'm gonna go make dessert.

221
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,305
You get the strap-on.
Let's make a super baby.

222
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,932
Pretty sure it doesn't work
that way, but we can try.

223
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,570
What about Krystal?
But with a "K"?

224
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,567
It's too stripper-y.

225
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,148
Kevin With a "K"!

226
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,325
No, too stripper-y, too.

227
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,495
Uh, Earl!

228
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,160
He's gonna go straight to jail

229
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,036
if we name him Earl.

230
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,369
What about Bruce?

231
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,542
No.

232
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,882
Get down.

233
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,331
What?

234
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,988
Baby? Baby?

235
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,666
I'm okay.

236
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,829
Thank God I didn't have to use
the cream cheese spreader.

237
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,869
Please.

238
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,750
Please. Please.

239
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,879
Baby, I'm so sorry.

240
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:13,841
No!

241
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:21,074
<i>Papa, can you hear me?</i>

242
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,526
Is it just me, or does

243
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,421
<i>Do You Want to Build
a Snowman? from Frozen...</i>

244
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:26,696
sound suspiciously like

245
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,702
<i>Papa, Can You Hear Me?
From Yentl?</i>

246
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,243
<i>Papa, can you hear me?</i>

247
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,585
And nobody fucking realizes it.

248
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,212
Wade, you gotta go home.

249
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,885
You've been sitting here
for three days, okay?

250
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,635
You smell like sauerkraut
left in the warm rain.

251
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,096
Like wet garbage in hot urine.

252
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,302
You smell like
a dog ate kitty litter...

253
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,388
and then farted his way
out of the living room.

254
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,268
I mean, like Rush Limbaugh's

255
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,895
<i>couch cushions after Shark Week.</i>

256
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,601
I love Frozen.

257
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:00,196
I loved her. I loved her
like an ocean loves water.

258
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,697
An ocean is water.

259
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:06,449
More importantly, I liked her.
I really liked her, you know?

260
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,071
George Michael was right.

261
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,997
I'm never gonna
dance again. Fuck!

262
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,584
He's dead, too.

263
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,084
At least we still have Bowie.

264
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,832
Oh, Mr. Pool.
David Bowie is...

265
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:16,923
Uh, uh, uh“.

266
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:18,373
Still with us.

267
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,334
We do.
We'll always have Bowie.

268
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:22,929
I'm sorry.

269
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,295
Shot after shot,

270
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,368
it's not gonna change the fact
that I think you're...

271
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,036
Are you pissing?
Are you urinating right now?

272
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,802
You're making the face that
you make when you urinate.

273
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,436
Is he pissing?
I'm on it!

274
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,062
There you go, Dopinder.

275
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,141
If you want to be
a contract killer...

276
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,727
you gotta handle a mop
before you handle a gun.

277
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:39,881
Although I don't
quite understand

278
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,111
how they are at all similar.

279
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,565
'Cause I could shove either
one up your ass and kill you.

280
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,740
Now, leave me.

281
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:45,827
I get it.

282
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,906
Go home, Wade.

283
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,364
I don't have a home,
Weas, you know. I got a...

284
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,157
Okay, I'm fine.

285
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,252
I'm fine.

286
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,202
You know what "fine"
stands for, Wade?

287
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:59,631
Fucked up, insecure,
needy, and emotional.

288
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,290
According to the...

289
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,797
KUbler-Ross.
Yeah.

290
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,924
According to
the KUbler-Ross model...

291
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,757
denial is just one of
the five stages of grief.

292
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,808
Jesus Christ, Buck!

293
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,181
No more speaking lines for you.

294
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,154
<i>THUG".
Hey, bud. Bud.</i>

295
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,027
<i>- Huh?
- Got a match?</i>

296
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,368
<i>Match?</i>

297
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,243
<i>Yes, I have one right here.</i>

298
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,807
<i>Don't make a move.
This is a stick-up.</i>

299
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,538
<i>- What?
- You heard me.</i>

300
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,616
<i>JACK". Mister, Mister,
put down that gun.</i>

301
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,293
<i>Shut up. Now, come on.
Your money or your life?</i>

302
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:49,131
<i>Look, bud. I said,
"Your money or your life."</i>

303
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,308
"|'m thinking it over!"

304
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,974
Motherfuck!

305
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,142
Fuck!

306
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,562
The hell you doin' here?

307
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,061
Don't you know how to knock?

308
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,643
I thought you saw me...

309
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,068
with your ears.

310
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,382
You're lucky I didn't
shootyouintheu.

311
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,406
The wall?

312
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,859
The refrigerator?
I'm in so much pain.

313
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,246
I heard the news, sweetie.

314
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,073
I'm very sorry. I am.

315
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,915
What am I gonna do, Al?

316
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,126
Probably something terrible.

317
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,537
Knowing you.

318
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,251
It was my fault.

319
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,334
I fucking did this.

320
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:29,007
And all I wanna do
is grab her and see her

321
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,089
and tell her that I'm sorry,
and I can't.

322
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,676
She's gone.

323
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,183
Sweetheart, can you speak up?

324
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,813
It's a little hard to hear you

325
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,561
with that pity dick
in your mouth.

326
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,644
Now, look, sugar.
You need to just keep living.

327
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:45,738
Thank you...

328
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:49,032
Matthew McConaughey,
your words are a treasure.

329
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,155
Listen to the pain.

330
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,953
It's both history teacher
and fortune teller.

331
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,906
Pain teaches us
who we are, Wade.

332
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,953
Sometimes, it's so bad,
we feel like we're dying.

333
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,338
But we can't really live till
we've died a little, can we?

334
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,050
VVade?

335
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,425
VVade?
I'm right here, Althea.

336
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,308
And that is
the most beautiful thing

337
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,600
I've ever heard.

338
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,890
And you're absolutely right.

339
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,102
I'm about to do
something terrible.

340
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,446
Precious, aren't they?

341
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,652
Whoa!

342
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,158
Are you a superhero?

343
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,864
Fucking A, sweetie.

344
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,494
What's your name?

345
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,326
Captain Delicious Pants.

346
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,582
Who's Captain Delicious Pants?

347
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,905
I can't believe
he's still alive.

348
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,483
I can't believe you left
the house in that shirt.

349
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,865
There's gotta be
some way to die.

350
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,947
I just need to die harder.

351
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,156
Trademark Fox.

352
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:21,334
Y'all caught up now?

353
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,180
<i>Open for business.</i>

354
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,845
<i>Your crazy matches my crazy.</i>

355
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,309
<i>I will never, ever
let our child be named Todd.</i>

356
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,564
<i>WADE". Skee-Ball token.</i>

357
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:46,931
<i>You're a lot smarter
than I look.</i>

358
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,052
<i>About why
we're so good together.</i>

359
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,407
<i>I love you, Wade Wilson.</i>

360
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,491
Ness?

361
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,073
Ness?

362
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:03,918
Ness.

363
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:07,207
Ness, there's something here.
I can't get to you.

364
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,006
Your heart's not
in the right place.

365
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,342
Wait, hold on. What?

366
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,261
Your heart's not
in the right place.

367
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,383
Wait. What do you mean

368
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,434
my heart's not in the right
place? What does it...

369
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,491
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss, Wade.

370
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,038
You're broken.

371
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:46,083
Oh, God.
I know that voice.

372
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,560
HEADMASTERI Well, Russell.

373
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,312
I hear you're handy
at picking locks.

374
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,858
There will be no need
for that here.

375
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:18,236
There's no looks on our doors,
no bars on our windows.

376
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,611
I know what you're thinking.

377
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,787
Why don't the kids just run?

378
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,953
Who would choose to stay
in such a place?

379
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,414
You stay because...

380
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:34,632
deep down inside, you know
you're unfit to leave.

381
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,054
Don't worry.

382
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,886
We can fix that.

383
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:51,474
Blessed are the wicked
who are healed by my hand.

384
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,081
"Heart's in the right place."

385
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,653
"Heart's in the right..."
What does that mean?

386
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,543
Take your mask off, Wade.

387
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,219
I wish you'd said "pants".

388
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,553
Let's play a game.

389
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,098
It's called
"Adrien Brody or Adam Brody?".

390
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,516
Now, close your eyes
and open your mouth.

391
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,435
You don't need to be funny here.

392
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,183
We must talk.

393
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,773
<i>You need fresh start.</i>

394
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,350
Such a glare.

395
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,606
It's like I'm on stage
at the Gaiety.

396
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,238
With training, you can be X-Man.

397
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,490
You're wasting your time,
Shiny Jesus.

398
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:42,817
I'm not X-Man material.

399
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,493
Understatement of the year.

400
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:45,955
Wade, Yukio.

401
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,576
Yukio, Wade.

402
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,457
What in the fuck knuckles
is this?

403
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,410
She's my girlfriend,
you intolerant shit.

404
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,999
Whoa! Pump the hate brakes,
Fox & Friends.

405
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,922
I'm just surprised
anyone would date you.

406
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,296
<i>Especially Pinkie Pie
from My Little Pony.</i>

407
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,009
I like this guy.

408
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:02,841
Give him a chance.

409
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,784
It's great seeing you like this.

410
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,970
Yeah.

411
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,436
<i>Eve, Warm!</i>

412
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,224
Now, some ground rules
while under our roof.

413
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:14,057
"Rule number one.
No killing...

414
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:17,564
"anyone ever, no matter how bad.

415
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,237
"Rule two. Label everything
in refrigerator."

416
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,324
VVade?

417
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,282
VVade?

418
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,234
Don't try to chase me.
Wade!

419
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,407
I'm not ready
to be touched again.

420
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,704
All these old guys on the wall.

421
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,873
Who lives here,
Calista Flockhart?

422
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,454
Those were already damaged
after they fell there!

423
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,964
What am I supposed
to do around here, anyway?

424
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,258
Sit in a share circle,
talk about my feelings?

425
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,928
And how would I do that exactly?

426
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,676
'Cause where the fuck
is everyone?

427
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:47,848
It's always just you

428
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,329
and Negasonic Teenage
Longest Name Ever...

429
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:50,353
Enough!

430
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,478
I said no touching!

431
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,770
What the fuck?

432
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,685
You'd think the studio
would throw us a bone.

433
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,817
One that doesn't end up
in my mouth.

434
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:03,843
The first movie made more money

435
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,154
than the guy who invented pants.

436
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,361
They can't just dust off
one of the famous X-Men?

437
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,537
How 'bout that putz
with the giant pigeon wings?

438
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:11,864
What do those do anyway, huh?

439
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,370
Carry him
three feet off the ground

440
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,371
to snatch up
the nearest muffin crumb?

441
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,703
No, no, no!

442
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,460
I am not X-Man material at all.

443
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,167
First off...

444
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,299
I'm not even a virgin.
Second and more...

445
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:28,551
I should have left you

446
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,303
in the self-pitying mess
I found you in.

447
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:33,432
But this is what friends do.
They show up!

448
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,183
Not when convenient or easy.

449
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:38,933
When hard,
and you always make it hard.

450
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,357
You are unwell.

451
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,529
I'm sticking my neck out
bringing you here.

452
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,448
Wait.
One of the assholes

453
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,025
who killed Vanessa got away.

454
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,613
Oh, Jesus Christ!

455
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,727
I thought you were gonna
kiss me for a second there.

456
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,688
Please know I wouldn't be
able to stop you if you did.

457
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,703
Wade, whoever they are...

458
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,129
we track them down
and bring them to justice.

459
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,128
It was me.

460
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,553
I'm the asshole who got away.

461
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:11,299
I killed every last one
of them, except me.

462
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,559
Couldn't kill me.

463
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,681
We were gonna start a family.

464
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,396
We were, uh...

465
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,404
We were gonna be a family.

466
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,199
Wade...

467
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:30,155
Vanessa is gone.
She's not coming back.

468
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:34,034
This may not be
family you want...

469
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,115
but it's family you need.

470
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:37,825
You have a good heart.

471
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,455
It belongs here
where it can grow.

472
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,256
What did you say?

473
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,632
About my heart?

474
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:53,049
I think I'm in the right place.

475
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,619
I'mma tell you
what the big lie is.

476
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,295
Toilet paper.

477
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:06,747
What's so bad
about toilet paper?

478
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,003
Gets the job done.

479
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,926
Does it really get the job done?

480
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,174
All right. Say you wake up
tomorrow morning...

481
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:17,930
and, hypothetically, find some
fresh shit on your face.

482
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,739
Your cheek, maybe
a little bit in the beard.

483
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,457
What the hell?
I'm about to be fucking sick!

484
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,516
What do you do?

485
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,893
Do you go to a bathroom

486
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:25,600
and tear off
a piece of dry tissue...

487
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,526
and rub it around
on your beard a little bit

488
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,148
and then go on,
get on with your day?

489
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,821
Go to church,
maybe dinner and a movie,

490
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:31,988
like nothing happened?

491
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,406
Where is this coming from, man?

492
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,699
But something did happen.

493
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,197
Your face smells like shit.
Right?

494
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,824
So what you would do,

495
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,121
is you would get some soap,
you'd get some hot water...

496
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,495
and you would scrub
the fucking shit

497
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,543
out of your beard
for 10 straight minutes.

498
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,290
You could not scrub it enough.

499
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,021
Are you trying
to make me feel disgusting?

500
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,252
I'm starting to feel...

501
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:52,004
Toilet paper is
a plenty fine appetizer.

502
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,177
But, then...

503
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,718
Huggies Natural Care wet wipes.

504
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,139
That's your main course.

505
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,344
They're soft, they're moist.
They're for babies.

506
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:04,931
Finally, one more pass
with toilet paper,

507
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,891
maybe clear out
that excess moisture.

508
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,567
Maybe treat yourself
to a blow and go,

509
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,939
if you can get you a hair dryer.

510
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,362
Just about 30 seconds
would do you good.

511
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,077
The fuck?

512
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,365
Year.

513
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,373
What?

514
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,200
What year is it?

515
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,752
What kind of dumb-ass question
is that to ask?

516
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:00,236
<i>We have 8 weeks
of boot camp ahead of us, men.</i>

517
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,616
<i>That'll get us
toned and prepared</i>

518
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,288
<i>for all manner of combat.</i>

519
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:09,371
Not working out at all.

520
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,247
Masking tape.

521
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,673
It is no friend
to chilled aluminum.

522
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,718
Velcro.
Color-coded, efficient,

523
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:17,886
environmentally friendly.

524
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,176
Who is he talking to?

525
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:21,953
And why is he dressed like
a registered sex offender?

526
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,934
Can we focus
for a moment, ladies?

527
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,261
Please, we need to talk about
next month's meal plan.

528
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,097
Obviously,
everyone hated the ceviche.

529
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,477
I read the suggestion box.

530
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,150
I'm gonna stop you right there.

531
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,022
I see through this weak act.

532
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,490
You may have fooled Colossus
with this nice guy shit...

533
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:38,820
but not me.

534
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,945
Don't be mean.

535
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,322
Back Off, NTW.

536
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,575
No, no, n0.Lethergo.

537
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:44,780
Let her go, it's okay.

538
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,410
She has a right to be skeptical.

539
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,118
Look at me.
I'm an easy target.

540
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:51,628
You know, historically,

541
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,581
mischief has been my mistress...

542
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:56,337
so I understand, you know.
But I like to think...

543
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,928
that you guys have
really rubbed off on me.

544
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,388
I like to think that I've
rubbed off around you, too.

545
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,353
A lot.

546
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,972
And for the first time
in a long while...

547
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,227
I like me.

548
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,937
I accept your apology.
I never apologized.

549
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,521
I was talking to your heart.

550
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,983
See? You're not
lost cause you thought.

551
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,239
I'm proud. You're everything
I knew you can be.

552
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,616
Thank you, Colossus.

553
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,973
Just trying to be
the world's best X-Man.

554
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,453
Sorry, X-Person.

555
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:32,662
Hmm. Something wrong
with the soap.

556
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,338
It's fine.

557
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,631
I just filled it. Give it
a few more pumps there.

558
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,302
Now, if you'll excuse me...

559
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,129
it's dust bunny season...

560
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,223
and I'm hunting wabbits.

561
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,048
<i>Eve, Warm!</i>

562
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,765
Fuck.
Fuck you.

563
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,988
<i>No one is born perfect.</i>

564
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,036
But you can be.

565
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,454
I know you're doing
what comes naturally.

566
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,586
You can't help yourself.

567
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:19,924
But you can.

568
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,257
It takes work, discipline...

569
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,929
and treatment.

570
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,677
Your abilities...

571
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,636
I know how seductive they are.

572
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:33,643
How powerful they make you feel.

573
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:37,143
But you must learn
never to use them...

574
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,820
so they will never use you.

575
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,661
Please don't cry.

576
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,080
I'm going to help.

577
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,999
I'm gonna make you feel
what you should feel.

578
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:54,789
How you need to feel...

579
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,459
every time you're tempted
to act upon your urges.

580
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:03,256
Suck my mutant dick,
you four-eyed fuck.

581
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:18,942
Wade.

582
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:20,863
Wade!

583
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,526
Come in!
Hey, twas just doing

584
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,152
a little bit
of light reading here...

585
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:26,908
We have mission.

586
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,526
Well, you guys be
safe out there.

587
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,827
I'll be praying for you.

588
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,326
No, I want you to join.

589
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:34,658
I'm sorry, what?

590
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,335
You heard me.

591
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,662
Trust me,
that's a terrible idea.

592
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,875
I'm really not ready.

593
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,456
You are ready.
I'm not.

594
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:43,459
Be at the X-Jet in five.

595
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,751
I can do thirty.

596
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,757
Now.
I can do now.

597
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:47,883
Final offer.

598
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,633
<i>Irene Merry weather, WHIT News.</i>

599
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,684
<i>Live here
at a breaking news situation</i>

600
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,388
<i>at the Essex House
for Mutant Rehabilitation.</i>

601
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:57,393
A mutant boy
is appearing to have

602
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:58,690
some sort of an incident...

603
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,504
- with police here behind me.
- Get away from me!

604
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,895
There are two police vehicles
that are overturned.

605
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,467
There are open fires.
Fuck off! Stay back!

606
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:05,551
A scene of absolute chaos here.

607
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:06,575
Calm down.

608
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,367
I'll burn you!
You stay back!

609
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,820
Get away from me!

610
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,407
You wanna fucking die?

611
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,595
And it appears as if the X-Men
are arriving...

612
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:33,685
Scatter!

613
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,227
With what appears
to be a trainee.

614
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,272
Everyone, calm down!
The pros are here. I...

615
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,440
We're the X-Men!

616
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:42,734
A dated metaphor for racism
in the '60s.

617
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,316
So, respect.

618
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,938
At ease, Officer.

619
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,071
What are you doing?

620
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:51,777
My job!

621
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,271
You're the one who said
I was ready,

622
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,787
and I frankly disagreed
with you.

623
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,241
But here we are, trying to
overcome our differences.

624
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,747
Like Beyoncé says, "Please...

625
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,919
"Please, stop cheating on me."

626
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,087
OFFICER; Hey!

627
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,505
This is the fifth incident.

628
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,754
This kid needs to be
in the Ice Box, not here.

629
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,461
Russell belongs in our care.

630
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:10,296
Not in prison.
I assure you...

631
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,534
we have everything
under control.

632
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:12,593
Stay back!
I'll burn you!

633
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:13,845
Not getting a real

634
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,596
"under control"
vibe here, Marty.

635
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,053
It is Glen, isn't it?
Daniel.

636
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,387
I'll ask the questions, Miguel.

637
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,726
Let me talk to the kid.

638
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:25,653
You stay here with your weird,
secret sex lips.

639
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:28,407
You wanna die?

640
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,491
This kid's adorable.

641
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:30,719
I don't know why I packed
the hollow points.

642
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:31,858
I'll burn your balls off!

643
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,570
First day.
I'm so nervous!

644
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,863
Did you just say
"hollow points"?

645
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,289
Yeah, probably should've

646
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,413
brought a Super Soaker.

647
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:41,962
Hi, there!

648
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,714
Stay back or Justin Bieber dies!

649
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,293
Justin Bieber.
He called you Justin Bieber.

650
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,296
Hold on! Wait, wait, wait!

651
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,473
Okay, let's not do
whatever that is.

652
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,016
Okay? Let's just talk!

653
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,343
It's Russell, right?

654
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,603
Firefist.
Firefist.

655
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,272
Ooh, that's a great name.
Where does it burn'?

656
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,159
Just the fist, or all the way
up to the elbow?

657
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,441
Definitely all
the way up to the elbow.

658
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,526
Come quietly,
or there will be trouble.

659
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,745
<i>You stole that from Robocop!
That's from Robocop!</i>

660
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,831
Just stand down!

661
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,955
You're embarrassing me.
Look, FHeH.

662
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,666
Oh, my God! I can't say it!
I'm so sorry!

663
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,966
Oh, shit!
That fucking does it!

664
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:35,805
Put your hands behind your knees

665
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,348
and get down
on your head! Now!

666
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,642
Wade! What was first rule?

667
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:41,640
Label everything
in the refrigerator!

668
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:44,314
Do not escalate!
Rules are meant to be broken!

669
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,765
That's the exact opposite

670
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,225
of what they're meant for!

671
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,693
Fuck! Fine!

672
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,439
I'll start from the beginning.

673
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:54,240
My name is Deadpool,
and I'm an X-Man.

674
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,284
Trainee!
Shut it!

675
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:59,492
Look, I get it.

676
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,283
All right, you're scared.

677
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:03,870
Alone.

678
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:04,997
You got no family.

679
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:06,148
I didn't have a family, either.

680
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,879
You live in this dump.
Guess what'?

681
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,673
I used to live in a shithole
just like it.

682
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,879
But you know something?

683
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,677
A wise woman once said to me...

684
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,128
"Speak up.

685
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,430
"I can't hear you with that
pity dick in your mouth."

686
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,724
Too much? I went too far.

687
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,225
That was effervescent.

688
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,231
Stay in school, kid.

689
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,104
Or don't. I didn't.

690
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,027
And I'm an X-Man.

691
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,199
Trainee.

692
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,616
Fuck it!

693
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,445
Superhero landing coming up!

694
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,658
Ah, fuck, fuck, fuck!

695
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,584
That is so not practical.

696
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,349
I could get used
to this X-Man shit.

697
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:10,444
Trainee!

698
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,563
Trainee!

699
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,686
Get a power restraint
on him. Now!

700
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,990
Calm down, squirt.
It's over. We got ya.

701
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,360
What's that do?

702
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:21,911
Power-dampening collar.

703
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:23,278
Shuts down all mutant abilities.

704
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,116
You can't get it off.
Unless you've got a grenade.

705
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,168
Huh. Could've used
one of those in the first act.

706
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,495
HEADMASTERI Thank you!

707
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,548
That was absolutely thrilling.

708
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,626
True heroism in action.

709
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,549
We are in your debt.

710
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,964
We can take it from here.

711
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,221
Take me to the Ice Box, please!

712
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,472
Anywhere's better than here.

713
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,768
Believe me, son,

714
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,562
you do not wanna go
to the Ice Box.

715
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,140
That place makes Hitler's anus
look like Waikiki.

716
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,108
Let's get you inside, young man.

717
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:54,152
No, wait, wait. Wait.

718
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,728
You guys stay there.

719
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,449
Those guys hurt you?

720
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:09,913
Who?

721
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:14,672
Baldilocks? Jared Kushner?

722
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,625
Both of 'em?

723
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,010
Oh, fuck it.

724
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,637
Four or five moments!

725
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,727
I'm sorry?

726
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:28,975
Four or five moments!

727
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:32,975
That's all it takes
to be a hero.

728
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,019
People think
you wake up a hero...

729
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:37,980
brush your teeth a hero...

730
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,066
ejaculate into
a soap dispenser a hero.

731
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:46,613
But, no, being a hero
takes only a few moments!

732
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,575
A few moments...

733
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:52,286
doing the ugly stuff
no one else will do.

734
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:56,957
No!

735
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,843
Stand down!
Hold your fire!

736
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,217
Wade, what did you do?
Colossus, no!

737
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,550
You were right, Wade.
You are not X-Men material.

738
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,885
No shit, Shiny Gandhi!

739
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,436
What was your first clue?

740
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:13,311
The hollow point
through that fuckhead's face?

741
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:14,933
That kid was abused!

742
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,813
- You can always tell!
- We have rules!

743
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:19,821
You are not judge,
jury or executioner!

744
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,820
Fuck your rules!
I fight for what's right!

745
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,492
And sometimes
you gotta fight dirty!

746
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,825
You let me down
for the last time, Wade.

747
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,201
Okay, get these guys in the pod.

748
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:35,458
Take them to the Ice Box.

749
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,110
Hey, baby!

750
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,403
I wonder what gang I'll be in.

751
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,854
Yeah!

752
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,274
- Is there, like, a Sorting Hat?
- Hi.

753
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:07,527
I've always seen myself as

754
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:08,987
more of
an East Coast Hufflepuff.

755
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:13,457
I've made a critical error
on my Airbnb reservation.

756
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:17,378
This is not what the website
looked like at all.

757
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,673
I love the decor though.

758
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,671
I had no idea
hopeless was a color.

759
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:24,002
Hard left, douche bag.

760
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,678
Please, after you.

761
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:34,558
Another disgusting minority
off the streets.

762
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:35,730
We'll sleep well tonight.

763
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:36,816
Let's get a bagel.

764
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,945
Nighty-night,
Y°u annoying prick!

765
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,566
You're a long way
from your superpowers.

766
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:23,020
Yeah. Just a touch of cancer.

767
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:25,572
Not to worry, we're old friends.

768
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:26,819
Fuck!

769
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,570
I wanted to be a superhero.

770
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,031
Always wanted a real super suit.

771
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,658
What happened?

772
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,868
When was the last time you saw
a plus-sized superhero?

773
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,662
Never.

774
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,830
The industry discriminates.

775
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,458
Fuck superheroes.

776
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,256
The thing that
pisses me off the most...

777
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,175
I never stood up
for myself in there.

778
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,591
My whole life.

779
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:54,225
I've been waiting for someone
to come and save me.

780
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,605
Nobody's gonna sacrifice
anything for me.

781
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,979
I gotta start taking care
of myself.

782
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:09,157
I have a mission now.

783
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,736
The first thing I wanna do
when I get out of here...

784
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,117
burn the headmaster alive...

785
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,790
and then take a selfie
with his smoldering corpse.

786
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,373
Aw. That's, like,
my favorite part of the Bible.

787
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:25,043
I don't have
a sock puppet on me...

788
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,132
but what did he do to you?

789
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:29,298
Did he taste the rainbow?

790
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,425
I'd whisper it,
but Skittles would sue us.

791
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,216
Fucker hates mutants.

792
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,551
He tried to beat
the genes out of us.

793
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:39,182
Nothing worse than a
"pray the gay away" type guy.

794
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,347
Sick piece of shit.

795
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:46,441
Tomorrow, we'll find
the biggest guy in here...

796
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,067
and we'll make him our bitch!

797
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,323
What was that?

798
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,370
That is the biggest guy in here.

799
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:59,078
Fun fact about the Ice Box...

800
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:00,954
though no one's ever seen it,

801
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:03,207
they keep a monster
in the basement.

802
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,004
Right next to a huge,

803
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:06,627
steaming bowl of foreshadowing.

804
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,259
Look.

805
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,172
I can't protect you.

806
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,670
With this collar on,

807
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:15,848
my superpower
is just unbridled cancer.

808
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:18,802
Give me a bow and arrow,
I'm basically Hawkeye.

809
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,475
Now, if you'll excuse me...

810
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:24,728
I've got tumors to grow.
Vanessa awaits.

811
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,060
I'll start by making us a shank.

812
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,187
Good listening.
I stole that guard's pen...

813
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,192
and stashed it
in the old prison wallet,

814
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,648
if you know what I'm saying.

815
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,201
I really hope I don't know
what you're saying.

816
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,576
I know it's in there,
I just need to get it out.

817
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,578
Oh, Jesus Christ.

818
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:44,077
I can hear you
rummaging around in there.

819
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,621
Do they make Purell
for your ears?

820
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:52,760
And to <i>update</i> you

821
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:54,178
<i>on the story reported earlier,</i>

822
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:55,801
<i>after a lengthy standoff</i>

823
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,553
<i>outside the Essex House
for Mutant Rehabilitation...</i>

824
00:48:58,644 --> 00:48:59,930
<i>two mutants were arrested</i>

825
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,636
<i>and transported
to the Ice Box...</i>

826
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:03,179
<i>Entering repair mode.</i>

827
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,047
<i>Several
police cars were destroyed</i>

828
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:11,062
<i>and the X-Men were called in

829
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:34,260
<i>Cells seven and nine</i>

830
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:37,680

831
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,222
<i>Cells seven and nine</i>

832
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,052
<i>now off-limits
for medical personnel.</i>

833
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,179
Psst!

834
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:49,317
Don't do that.

835
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:52,737
What? Why are you
winking at me?

836
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,733
I got your back.

837
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:58,989
Oh, my God.

838
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,535
You're sick,
I gotta protect you.

839
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:02,534
Just leave me alone, kid.

840
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:04,748
Oh, great.

841
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:09,079
Well, hello there, new fish.

842
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:12,086
It's nice to see some
fresh faces around here.

843
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,466
I've done some
light catalog work...

844
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,011
but, really, modeling is just
a stepping stone to acting.

845
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,008
I was talking to him.

846
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,926
Have we met?
I can't place your mustache.

847
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,971
Black Tom Cassidy.
White Wade Wilson.

848
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:29,183
What's your superpower?
Cultural appropriation?

849
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:32,064
You're supposed to be
the toughest cunt in here.

850
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,815
You don't look like much to me.

851
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,152
First rule of the yard,
fuck face...

852
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:38,843
find the biggest guy
and make him your...

853
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,285
Second biggest guy.

854
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:47,617
The last thing I need
is more hepatitis.

855
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:51,371
Oh, it's slippery, too.
This table needs a wipe down!

856
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,905
Can we get a wipe down
on the table'?

857
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:56,209
Kid, I think you picked
the wrong side.

858
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,174
No, I didn't!
He's my friend!

859
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:01,506
Zip it. We're not friends.

860
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:04,507
You're about to get
dick-slapped.

861
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,572
I had so much fun!
You were like...

862
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:20,696
And I was like,
"Take a seat, shit dick."

863
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:21,901
Just let me die in peace.

864
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,321
We make a great team!

865
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,285
Oh, God! We're not a team.

866
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:31,665
Why'd you say that back there?
We're friends, partners.

867
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,167
We're not partners or friends.

868
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:37,630
This doesn't end with us
riding into the sunset.

869
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,882
It ends with me
dying of cancer...

870
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:43,510
and you winning the Ice Box
award for softest mouth.

871
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:46,805
There's only one person
in this world

872
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,681
that I care about,
and she's gone.

873
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,473
You wanna survive?

874
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:56,982
Stop trying to shank
the biggest guys in here...

875
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,938
and make friends with them.

876
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,824
Make friends with someone.

877
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,660
Anyone but me.

878
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,163
Maybe even Black Tim.

879
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,620
Black Evan, I don't know.

880
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:13,203
All I remember is
he was African-American.

881
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,713
<i>System malfunctioning.</i>

882
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:04,137
<i>Cells 7, 12, 14, 27.</i>

883
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:06,430
Back in your cells, you filthy
mutants! Get in there!

884
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:09,805
<i>Cells 1, 3, 7, 8.</i>

885
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,386
Searching.

886
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:16,308
<i>Cell 04 located.</i>

887
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,311
Door won't open!

888
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,479
On your fucking knees!

889
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:00,151
That was our cell.

890
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:04,522
What did I do to piss off
a grumpy old fucker

891
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:05,777
with a Winter Soldier arm?

892
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,954
Get away from me, kid!

893
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:25,801
Listen to me! Go!

894
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,596
Hello, Russell.

895
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,056
Donde esta la biblioteca?

896
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,206
Who are you?

897
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,323
I'm Batman.

898
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:31,797
Ooh!

899
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,427
Oh. That's got some zip.

900
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,734
Don't feel bad.
Even I can't kill me.

901
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:52,485
Talk!

902
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:54,776
What kind of
spineless shit stick

903
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,235
tries to kill a 14-year-old boy?

904
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:58,739
You might wanna start talking!

905
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,202
'Cause I got a long history of
firing at times like this!

906
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,201
The name's Cable.

907
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:07,417
I'm from the future.
Just walk away.

908
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,377
Oh!

909
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:10,924
So, you're from the future.

910
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:13,302
I have three questions then.

911
00:57:13,472 --> 00:57:16,635
One, is dubstep still a thing?

912
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,558
Two, do people still homebrew?

913
00:57:19,645 --> 00:57:22,228
And three,
does Dopinder ever find love?

914
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,107
Dubstep's for pussies.

915
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,354
You're so dark!

916
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,651
Are you sure you're not
from the DC universe?

917
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:13,896
I love dubstep!

918
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,636
Is that a fanny pack?

919
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:44,310
I used to have one of those
in 1990-never.

920
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:47,354
Something to remember you by.

921
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:51,150
Give me that back!
That goes with me everywhere.

922
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,603
Like the memory
of your fucking fanny pack!

923
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:05,413
Why are you protecting the kid?

924
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:08,663
I don't give a fuck about him...

925
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:11,499
<i>and his Are You My Mother?
Complex!</i>

926
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:15,082
What's this one do?

927
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,856
<i>In every film, there's a moment</i>

928
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:33,274
<i>when the hero hits rock bottom.</i>

929
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:35,272
<i>In Cool</i> Runnings,
<i>it was when John Candy's</i>

930
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:36,649
<i>prized bobsled broke.</i>

931
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:40,073
<i>In Human Centipede,
it was when those people...</i>

932
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,696
<i>signed on to be in that movie.</i>

933
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:43,243
<i>But in this film, well.</i> ..

934
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,116
<i>You're looking at it.</i>

935
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:46,948
On your fucking knees, mutant.

936
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:50,878
<i>Rock...</i>

937
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:56,415
<i>meet bottom.</i>

938
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,185
<i>I love you, Wade Wilson.</i>

939
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,477
Ness?

940
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:11,980
Hey, Ness!

941
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,645
Ness, can you let me in?

942
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,818
Please! Please.

943
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,071
Jesus.

944
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,796
You're not giving me
a lot of direction here.

945
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,616
I'm at the end of my rope.

946
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:31,367
Then I joined the X-Men.

947
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:33,377
Iwent to prison. I, uh...

948
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,957
Is it the kid?

949
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:43,925
Kids give us a chance to be
better than we used to be.

950
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,350
The kid!

951
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:01,693
That's exactly what she meant.

952
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:03,052
Your heart needs to be
in the right place.

953
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,908
I'm not gonna abandon this kid.

954
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:07,578
He's never had anyone, ever.

955
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:08,950
I need to be selfless.

956
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,951
Yeah, but what does that mean?

957
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:14,160
It means I'm gonna save Russell.

958
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,827
Maybe I couldn't save Vanessa...

959
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:18,880
but maybe I can save a robust
teenager from New Zealand.

960
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:21,028
Yeah, but what I mean is,
like, the world "selfless."

961
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,572
I literally don't know
what that means.

962
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:23,752
Jesus Christ.

963
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:26,555
Okay, look.
According to my guy, okay...

964
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,382
those muties
are being transferred

965
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:30,262
to a supermax, 80 miles away.

966
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,139
Great, I'll pick 'em off
along the way.

967
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,346
Hold your testicles there,
buddy, okay?

968
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:36,398
We're talking about
an armored convoy...

969
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:39,067
and a vicious super soldier
from the future...

970
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:41,486
that is looking to turn your
skull into a fuckable ashtray.

971
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:42,984
You know what we need to do?

972
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:44,815
We need to build a fucking team.

973
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:47,030
We need 'em tough,
morally flexible...

974
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,485
and young enough
so they can carry

975
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,765
this franchise 10 to 12 years.

976
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,621
A team of
highly-skilled motherfuckers.

977
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,700
I'm talking about some
Ocean's 14 shit. Rogue Two.

978
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:57,161
John <i>Wick 3,</i> but with
the original director.

979
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:59,121
My body is an
instrument of death.

980
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:00,547
Not now, Dopinder.

981
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:02,045
I could be of great use.

982
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,717
What's your superpower?

983
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:07,129
Courage.
That's adorable.

984
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:08,904
Do you have the courage
to check and see...

985
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:11,266
if there are enough sanitary
napkins in the dispenser?

986
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:12,353
Yes, sir.

987
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,677
I'm sorry you had to see that,

988
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:15,262
although I'm glad you heard it.

989
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,015
All right, I'll put out
a call for resumes.

990
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:20,316
But we're not paying
medical or dental.

991
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,440
It's time to get back
on Linkedln.

992
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:00,853
<i>Attention, all inmates!</i>

993
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,394
<i>Transport to Cross Force
Maximum Security</i>

994
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:04,853
<i>Mutant Containment Facility...</i>

995
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:06,863
<i>will begin at 0800 hours.</i>

996
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,990
<i>Inspection of your cells
and out processing</i>

997
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:11,114
<i>will begin at 0600.</i>

998
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:20,421
Oi.

999
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:21,878
What the fuck do you want?

1000
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:23,751
That's my fucking pudding.

1001
01:03:23,842 --> 01:03:25,242
Fuck your pudding!
You like pudding?

1002
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:47,865
Hello?

1003
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,492
I know you're in there.

1004
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:10,465
Must be hard
being the biggest guy in here.

1005
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:14,006
Lonely at the top, eh?

1006
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,057
They're moving us tomorrow.

1007
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,307
Maybe I can get you out of here.

1008
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:24,687
And we can make
the whole world our bitch.

1009
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,270
We need a secret code.

1010
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:33,943
No,
that's stupid, Russell. Idiot.

1011
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:42,701
We're a team.

1012
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:44,707
We're like thugs,
we're like gangsters.

1013
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:46,755
I'm like Tupac,
and you're like Ice Cube.

1014
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:49,570
Supposedly, she can rap, too.

1015
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:50,675
DEADPOOLI Yeah.

1016
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:51,762
I like that.

1017
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:53,257
Terrific,
these are all terrific.

1018
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:55,222
Meet Bedlam.

1019
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:57,470
Cool name! Superpowers?

1020
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:59,092
I can distort electrical fields.

1021
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:02,517
Including the one
inside your brain...

1022
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:05,269
causing anxiety, confusion...

1023
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,441
Dam

1024
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,441
So, basically,
you're Dave Matthews.

1025
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:10,692
We can use him.

1026
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:13,986
I'm Zeitgeist.

1027
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,400
Cool. I like it.

1028
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:16,735
So you have the power

1029
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:19,162
to put your finger
on the pulse of society?

1030
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:21,323
No.

1031
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:22,954
No, I spit acidic vomit.

1032
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:24,125
Oh.
Do you want me

1033
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:25,543
- to demonstrate?
- No!

1034
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,961
We'll take your word for it.

1035
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,288
Thank you. Yeah. Listen,
we've all eaten at Arby's, okay?

1036
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,959
And this is the Vanisher.

1037
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:36,306
But...

1038
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:38,931
Vanisher!

1039
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:43,140
Nice! Right?

1040
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:45,522
He's not here, is he?

1041
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,144
He may be running late.

1042
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:51,194
My name's Rusty,
but I go by Shatterstar.

1043
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:52,820
That's good, yeah.

1044
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:54,989
"Rusty" is terrible.
Toughie.

1045
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:57,784
So, uh, where are you from?
The planet Mojo World.

1046
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,945
So you're an alien, I guess.
Bad name.

1047
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,655
How does that, uh, help us?

1048
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:04,537
I'm basically better
than you at everything.

1049
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,431
Just once, I'm gonna find
a planet of people

1050
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,999
that are worse than me
at everything.

1051
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,251
A whole bunch
of functional idiots.

1052
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:12,278
I'm gonna go there, and I'm
gonna be their Superman.

1053
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:13,383
Isn't that Canada?

1054
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,882
You shut your
goddamn trash mouth!

1055
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:18,512
WEASEL I Meet...
Domino.

1056
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,307
What's your shtick?
I'm lucky.

1057
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:21,685
That's not a superpower.

1058
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:23,145
Yeah, it is.
No, it isn't.

1059
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:24,519
Yes, it is.
No, it isn't.

1060
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:25,606
Yeah, it is.
No, it isn't.

1061
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:26,690
Yes, it is.
No, it isn't.

1062
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:27,774
Yeah, it is.
Really isn't.

1063
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:28,940
No, it isn't.
Yes, it is.

1064
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:30,110
Told you.

1065
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,526
Get out of my head!

1066
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:33,278
I'm not in your head.

1067
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:34,644
I'm in an 11-year-old's bedroom.

1068
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:35,856
Well, if you're so lucky,

1069
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,486
then what are you
doing here with us?

1070
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:38,658
I don't know yet.

1071
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:39,805
What's that supposed to mean?

1072
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,599
There's a reason why I'm here,
and I'll know when I know.

1073
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:43,434
Everything usually
just kind of works out for me.

1074
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:45,290
Like 2008 Ryan Reynolds.

1075
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:47,667
I don't know who that is.

1076
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:48,915
You're hired.

1077
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:50,297
Lucky me.

1078
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:51,587
DEADPOOLI I like her!

1079
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,003
And last, but not least...

1080
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:55,208
Peter.

1081
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:58,553
Am I getting
catfished here or...?

1082
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:01,048
Any powers you wanna
tell us about?

1083
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:02,223
PETER; No.

1084
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:04,430
I don't have one.

1085
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:05,807
Um, I just saw the ad.

1086
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:07,604
No superpowers at all?

1087
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:10,808
Uh, I have both
Type 1 and 2 Diabetes.

1088
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:12,605
OW! Oh!

1089
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:13,810
That's all the diabetes.

1090
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,145
Right?
Yeah, you got 'em all.

1091
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,151
If you find a Type 3,
let us know.

1092
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:18,659
Yeah.

1093
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:19,824
You're in.

1094
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:21,401
Yeah.
Fuck!

1095
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,201
It's fulfilling work.

1096
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,582
Let's go!

1097
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:47,765
<i>This is Convoy 17
departing the Ice Box.</i>

1098
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:49,220
<i>We are en route.</i>

1099
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:59,190
Peacetime makes people soft.

1100
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,571
I was born into war.

1101
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:05,283
Bred into it.

1102
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:07,416
Okay.

1103
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:10,583
What's the most pain
you've ever felt?

1104
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:13,753
These restraints are pretty...

1105
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,251
People think
they understand pain.

1106
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,169
They have no concept of it

1107
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,217
beyond their own
worst experience.

1108
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:23,968
5 years old. That's what?

1109
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,548
A bee sting.

1110
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:26,724
Oh, yeah.

1111
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:29,303
20 years old, shrapnel.

1112
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:31,684
40 years old, disease.

1113
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:36,644
Maybe the kind that leaves you
more machine than man.

1114
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:38,138
Yeah, getting old's
not for sissies.

1115
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:39,779
That's what my
Grandma Ginny used to...

1116
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:41,072
I've got a list.

1117
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:43,783
We're gonna work down it.

1118
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:45,495
Together.

1119
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:48,780
Number one,
I'm gonna bend something.

1120
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:52,038
Something that was not
meant to bend.

1121
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,230
I'm gonna stop you right there

1122
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:54,607
because I'm not gonna
make it to two.

1123
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:55,917
I won't even make it to one.

1124
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:57,668
I don't do well with pain,
you know.

1125
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,875
If I stub my toe,
I'm done for the day.

1126
01:09:00,178 --> 01:09:02,169
I cried when they
canceled <i>Felicity.</i>

1127
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:04,450
When I get really scared,
I get nervous erections.

1128
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:05,805
I have one right now.

1129
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,428
Don't look.
It'll only make it worse.

1130
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:08,621
I don't want you to hurt me,

1131
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:10,886
and I'll tell you
anything you wanna know.

1132
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:13,472
Except for where they are.

1133
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,336
Russell's in a convoy
heading southbound

1134
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,566
on Gerry Duggan Parkway.

1135
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:18,130
The monster's with them.
I wouldn't fuck with him.

1136
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,565
You all know the plan.

1137
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:21,363
Intercept the convoy,

1138
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:23,406
grab the boy.
But not inappropriately!

1139
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:24,493
<i>You know what,</i>

1140
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:25,721
<i>I wouldn't fuck with
Deadpool either.</i>

1141
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:28,533
<i>Because he's built a team.
He's unstoppable.</i>

1142
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:31,285
He has an ass pen.
He'll stab you with it.

1143
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:33,959
Watch out for this guy, Cable!

1144
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:37,163
He's very short, 5'11".
Not like in the comics.

1145
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:40,002
And if we succeed,
we all go home early.

1146
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:42,254
So if you go after
them, Cable, lwarn you...

1147
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:44,844
there's a wind advisory
in effect.

1148
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,774
<i>A little turbulent up here.</i>

1149
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:06,942
I don't know much
about this Cable fella...

1150
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,367
but I guarantee he hasn't killed

1151
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:10,195
as many people as melanoma has.

1152
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:12,663
We're getting close!

1153
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,658
As a former X-Man...

1154
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:16,618
Trainee.
Thank you, Bedlam.

1155
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:19,045
I was always appalled
by the blatant sexism

1156
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:20,668
in the group's name.

1157
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:22,749
X-Men! Men!

1158
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:25,802
The point is, our group
will be forward thinking.

1159
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,174
Gender neutral.

1160
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:29,552
From now on,
we'll be known as...

1161
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:33,142
X-Force.

1162
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:34,936
Isn't that a little derivative?

1163
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:37,434
I don't recall asking
your opinion, Peter!

1164
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:40,149
That wasn't me.

1165
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:49,488
Hang the laundry out
at 1,300 feet...

1166
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:51,365
intercept the convoy,
and grab the boy.

1167
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:52,558
Let's bring on
the carnage, baby!

1168
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,414
Get me on the ground,
watch me go!

1169
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,500
Yeah!

1170
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:57,326
I can't wait to kill!

1171
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,081
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1172
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:02,000
I just wanna say
how proud I am of this team.

1173
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:05,758
You know, you guys look amazing!

1174
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:08,678
Vanisher, I have no doubt
you look amazing too.

1175
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:09,800
This is the family

1176
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:11,571
that I've always dreamed
of having and I...

1177
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:13,428
Ah, Shit.

1178
01:11:15,062 --> 01:11:16,723
I just get a little choked up
sometimes.

1179
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:18,600
I hate to interrupt,
but is anybody nervous

1180
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,022
about the high winds?

1181
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,395
Gary.
My name's Peter.

1182
01:11:21,486 --> 01:11:23,352
I realize that you're
new to this, but relax.

1183
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:24,886
You've been chosen
by a higher power.

1184
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:27,397
Did he just call himself God?
I think he did.

1185
01:11:27,492 --> 01:11:29,028
I'd like to go home.
And I'd like...

1186
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,576
the McRib to be available
year round,

1187
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:33,448
but sometimes dreams
don't come true.

1188
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:35,655
I spent 10 years
in Special Forces.

1189
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:36,894
You think we didn't
jump out of the plane

1190
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:38,283
because of a light breeze?

1191
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,161
You're in this shit now,
Mustache!

1192
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:43,166
I'm only yelling
to impress the other guys.

1193
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:45,168
I'd never let anything
happen to you, Sugarbear.

1194
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,751
Leonard, hit it!

1195
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:58,558
Go! Go! Go!

1196
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:35,632
Let's get some!

1197
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:36,841
Whoo!

1198
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,051
0h, yeah!

1199
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:40,978
Convoy, 12 o'clock!
On my command!

1200
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,480
Deploy! Oh, hey now!

1201
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:44,808
Whoa!

1202
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:51,985
Little off course here.

1203
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:56,994
Holy mommy fucking shit!

1204
01:12:57,748 --> 01:12:59,159
Ah, there they are.

1205
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:02,333
Look at these gorgeous
sons of bitches.

1206
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:04,790
Oh, yeah!
That's right, Bedlam!

1207
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:13,800
No! Tripping
motherfucking billies!

1208
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:17,306
Shatterstar.
Okay, you got this.

1209
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,060
Left!

1210
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:20,476
Left!

1211
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:22,770
You'd have to be insane
to take off in this.

1212
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:25,064
No, stage left, you idiot!

1213
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:30,478
VVeH, |guess we found something

1214
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:31,654
you're not better at.

1215
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,154
Vanisher.

1216
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,985
Maybe the wind can't blow
what it can't see.

1217
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:41,535
On! Really?

1218
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:43,412
All right,
we could do this with four.

1219
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:46,961
Sugarbear.
You got this, buddy!

1220
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:49,164
That's the stuff!
That's the X-Force spirit!

1221
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:52,421
Never underestimate
a man with a mustache!

1222
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:54,001
Just ask anyone in Brooklyn.

1223
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,257
We did it!

1224
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:56,838
You're a goddamn superhero, you!

1225
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:58,014
X-Force!

1226
01:13:58,643 --> 01:13:59,724
X-Force.

1227
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:05,972
Oh!

1228
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:10,695
Peter.

1229
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:11,780
I got you, buddy!

1230
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:12,966
You're gonna be fine!
This is not good, man!

1231
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:15,607
You got this, big guy!
Here we go, Peter!

1232
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:17,112
Look at me.
We're X-Force, right?

1233
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:19,319
Yeah, we're X-Force.
We're X-Force.

1234
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:25,367
Oh, my God!
What the fuck?

1235
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,418
Fucking acidic vomit!

1236
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:31,748
Oh, God! I'm gonna throw up
in my mask.

1237
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:37,254
Okay, I'm over the convoy.

1238
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:39,180
Where did the rest
of the team land?

1239
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:41,425
Good news and bad news.

1240
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:44,602
Bad news is
the whole team is dead.

1241
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:45,770
The good news is,

1242
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:47,813
I don't think anyone's
gonna miss Shatterstar.

1243
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:51,188
He was a bit of a prick.
Oh, but Paul!

1244
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:52,278
<i>Peter!</i>

1245
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:53,774
Peter, I'm gonna miss him most.

1246
01:14:53,864 --> 01:14:54,984
But there is a slight chance

1247
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:56,363
Vanisher could make it.

1248
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,987
Nope, no chance. He's dead.

1249
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:00,239
<i>The whole team?</i>

1250
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,115
Only the main ones.
We're still good.

1251
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:03,446
<i>Fuck, you are dumb.</i>

1252
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:05,123
Whoever planned this stunt's

1253
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:07,371
been smoking a lot jazz cabbage.

1254
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:08,542
I'll tell you that much.

1255
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:10,245
<i>That's pretty obvious!</i>

1256
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,046
Looking good, Vanisher.

1257
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:23,758
They're headed into the tunnel.

1258
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,181
I'm that kid's only hope,

1259
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:28,138
so sit tight
and wait for my word.

1260
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:29,899
Whatever.

1261
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:31,211
<i>We're gonna lose 'em.
I'm dropping in.</i>

1262
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:34,148
<i>Uh, that's
a negative, sole survivor.</i>

1263
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:36,730
<i>Luck is not a superpower!
We are so fucked!</i>

1264
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:39,862
No, we most certainly
are not fucked.

1265
01:15:42,997 --> 01:15:45,614
<i>Seriously, I don't get it!</i>

1266
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:48,166
<i>What, you shoot luck lasers
out of your eyes?</i>

1267
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:52,123
<i>It's just it's hard to picture.</i>

1268
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:54,330
<i>And certainly
not very cinematic.</i>

1269
01:15:57,011 --> 01:15:58,593
<i>I mean, luck?</i>

1270
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:01,171
<i>What coked out,
glass pipe-sucking</i>

1271
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:02,596
<i>freaks how comic book artist...</i>

1272
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:04,265
<i>came up
with that little chestnut?</i>

1273
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:06,638
<i>Probably a guy
who can't draw feet!</i>

1274
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:20,983
<i>Once again, it all falls
on my shoulders.</i>

1275
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:22,304
<i>It's why I'm cursed to be
a solo act.</i>

1276
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:23,368
<i>Wander the Earth...
I'm in.</i>

1277
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:24,868
<i>I'm sorry, what did you say?</i>

1278
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:26,036
<i>I'm in.</i>

1279
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:27,989
How in the fuck
are you in already?

1280
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:29,699
Oh, shit.

1281
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:31,500
It's Cable. 12 o'clock.

1282
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:32,622
<i>Okay.</i>

1283
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:35,125
New plan. Use all of your
imaginary powers

1284
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:37,924
to stop Cable
from killing that kid.

1285
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,626
I'm coming up on your six.

1286
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:49,886
That gun is amazing!

1287
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:00,984
Hey!
Asshole!

1288
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:02,740
<i>Where is he?
I can't see him.</i>

1289
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:04,317
He's on top of you.

1290
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,076
<i>He's tearing you open!</i>

1291
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:07,950
<i>He's going in through the back!</i>

1292
01:17:08,499 --> 01:17:09,580
<i>Oh, God, he's inside!</i>

1293
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:10,907
You hear yourself, right?

1294
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,412
<i>Accidental double entendres!</i>

1295
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:14,961
Russell! Russell Collins!

1296
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:16,958
Hands off that kid, John Connor!

1297
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:22,971
No, no, no!

1298
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:28,424
Shit!

1299
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:52,285
Two can play that game!

1300
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:56,252
Got it! No, I don't.

1301
01:17:57,256 --> 01:17:58,256
<i>Showtime, mama!</i>

1302
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,956
Lady Luck, take the wheel.

1303
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,608
I'd ask who you are, but
you'll be dead in a second.

1304
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:41,669
I'm Domino, and doubtful.

1305
01:18:58,275 --> 01:18:59,275
Hang in there, Doms!

1306
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:02,227
Oh, this is really hard.

1307
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,911
And give me back
my Skee-Ball token.

1308
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:20,999
You're doing great.
X-Force.

1309
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:24,958
I guess dubstep never dies.

1310
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:30,300
Whoo!

1311
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:39,977
You killed Black Tom,
you racist son of a bitch!

1312
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:43,893
That's unfortunate.

1313
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:48,272
We got no brakes!

1314
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:49,690
Figure it out!

1315
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:55,617
There's nothing I can't kill.

1316
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:00,911
Well, as Scoutmaster Kevin
used to say...

1317
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:03,337
"There's a first time
for everything, son."

1318
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,632
Give me your best shot,
One-Eyed Willy.

1319
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,394
Those bullets were, like,
super fast.

1320
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:24,986
Here we go.

1321
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:28,278
Domino, mind slowing us down?

1322
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:30,447
Here goes nothing.

1323
01:21:01,648 --> 01:21:03,389
Knock, knock.

1324
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:10,948
That's my boy.

1325
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:18,534
Holy...

1326
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:30,424
I'll <i>be first</i> to admit...

1327
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:32,878
<i>this did not go
according to plan.</i>

1328
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:35,759
<i>I'll also be the first
to admit that</i>

1329
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:37,681
<i>that plan was written in crayon.</i>

1330
01:21:37,768 --> 01:21:40,977
<i>Looks like Russell found
a new friend. Jelly.</i>

1331
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:42,599
<i>Turns out Domino's
a bit of a badass,</i>

1332
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:45,556
<i>and maybe,
possibly mildly lucky.</i>

1333
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:48,894
<i>But Cable? Ugh.
That guy's in a mood.</i>

1334
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:50,148
A mood that is

1335
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,025
about to get
significantly worse.

1336
01:22:15,806 --> 01:22:18,218
Something is so terribly,
terribly wrong.

1337
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:22,642
Oh.

1338
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,056
Oh, God, that hurt.

1339
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:27,766
Suck it, Mel Gibson.

1340
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:32,402
Russell.

1341
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:36,198
Russell!

1342
01:22:36,827 --> 01:22:38,909
Russ, where are ya?

1343
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:44,623
Russell. Russell, you're okay!

1344
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:47,956
Oh, thank God.
Oh, my God!

1345
01:22:48,255 --> 01:22:49,461
Juggernaut!

1346
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:52,790
I thought that was you!

1347
01:22:52,885 --> 01:22:54,967
I should've worn my white pants.

1348
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:58,713
You probably get this a lot,
but I am a huge fan.

1349
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,888
<i>Uncanny X-Men</i> 1 <i>83. Thor 411.</i>

1350
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:04,264
<i>X-Men Unlimited 12.</i>

1351
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:06,436
You know, it has always been
a dream of mine...

1352
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:08,264
to see my face
reflected in your helmet...

1353
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:10,520
as you charge at me
with murderous intent.

1354
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:12,101
I don't mean right now.

1355
01:23:12,446 --> 01:23:14,312
I'm gonna rip you in half now.

1356
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,738
That is such
a Juggernaut thing to say.

1357
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:24,823
Oh, my God!
I can't feel my legs.

1358
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:25,998
I can't feel...

1359
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,450
Oh, no, they're right here.

1360
01:23:29,296 --> 01:23:31,037
Got 'em.
God, Russell.

1361
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:32,963
I have a mission.

1362
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:34,624
To get my revenge.

1363
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:37,376
I'm going to burn
that headmaster alive.

1364
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:39,633
You're not the revenge type.

1365
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:40,884
Take it from a friend.

1366
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:45,017
Friend? You were sick,
and I protected you.

1367
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:47,303
You said it yourself.

1368
01:23:47,397 --> 01:23:50,059
"|'m not your friend.
Find someone stronger."

1369
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:51,356
So I did.

1370
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:55,148
Russell, I couldn't
protect you back then.

1371
01:23:55,322 --> 01:23:58,781
But I can now. What do you
want me to say, huh?

1372
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:01,200
"I care about you"?
'Cause goddamn it,

1373
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:03,118
I care about you, Russell.

1374
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:05,829
What's Juggernaut got
that I don't have?

1375
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:09,079
Don't you say legs!
I know you're gonna say legs!

1376
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:12,416
Legs!
Still hurts to hear out loud!

1377
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:17,504
What is that?
That's not a real rope!

1378
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:19,926
You get back here, young man!

1379
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:22,004
Doms!

1380
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:24,553
Doms, get me
out of here, please.

1381
01:24:24,643 --> 01:24:27,055
Use my arms as backpack straps.

1382
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:30,854
I think we may have found

1383
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:32,727
your cosmic reason
for being here.

1384
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:34,892
I'm pretty sure this isn't it.

1385
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:36,227
X-Force.

1386
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:51,537
<i>No child is hopeless.</i>

1387
01:24:51,628 --> 01:24:54,416
Don't give up on the boy.
How could he just walk away?

1388
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:57,414
It was the coldness in his eyes.

1389
01:24:57,884 --> 01:24:59,466
You should've heard it.

1390
01:25:01,388 --> 01:25:03,675
I guess family
really is an F-word.

1391
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,762
Rub my legs, Mama.

1392
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:08,217
Why would I rub your legs?

1393
01:25:08,312 --> 01:25:10,895
Please, they hurt.
I have growing pains.

1394
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:15,565
What in the...

1395
01:25:16,069 --> 01:25:18,310
Why is your hand so tiny again?

1396
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:20,187
That's not my hand.

1397
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:22,531
Oh! Mary,
mother of Joseph!

1398
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:24,984
That was nice for me.

1399
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:27,820
Wade! I heard what happened
with the convoy and...

1400
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:34,168
Why wouldn't you cover that up?

1401
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:36,833
A warrior has nothing
to be ashamed of.

1402
01:25:36,923 --> 01:25:38,834
Yeah, but you do.
Look at you.

1403
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:40,916
You're just
straight shirt-cocking it,

1404
01:25:41,011 --> 01:25:42,422
toddler-style.

1405
01:25:42,512 --> 01:25:44,423
Oh, yeah.
Full Winnie the Pooh.

1406
01:25:44,514 --> 01:25:46,471
The hell's happening?
Describe it.

1407
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:47,827
I wouldn't ask him to do that,
if I were you.

1408
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:49,433
It's like, um...
Here we go.

1409
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:50,788
It's like he was
giving birth anally,

1410
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:52,302
but they quit halfway through.

1411
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:53,541
They got the legs out,
and they said,

1412
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:54,896
"You know what, I'm done."

1413
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:55,983
Happy?

1414
01:25:56,068 --> 01:25:57,170
It's like he's a Muppet
from the waist down.

1415
01:25:57,194 --> 01:25:58,525
But this time, you can see

1416
01:25:58,612 --> 01:26:00,023
the Muppet's dick.

1417
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:01,299
Grover's got a cock
the size of a twig.

1418
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:02,675
Mr. Weasel, I can
no longer be double-parked.

1419
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:04,360
I've had three tickets already.

1420
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:08,452
No, no, no, DP, not again!

1421
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:10,325
This has happened before?

1422
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:12,869
Jesus! Either vomit or don't.

1423
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:14,245
The indecision is killing me.

1424
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:16,202
Why couldn't God
take my hearing?

1425
01:26:17,798 --> 01:26:19,960
Oh. WOW!

1426
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:21,666
Cool your pits.
They're growing back.

1427
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,342
I'm talking about your face.

1428
01:26:23,762 --> 01:26:25,628
I've never seen you
without your mask before.

1429
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:27,884
Jesus Christ!
Looks like an avocado.

1430
01:26:27,974 --> 01:26:29,590
Your legs, though, they're cute.

1431
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:31,721
You wanna borrow
a pair of pants?

1432
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:34,849
I'm glad everybody dropped by.

1433
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:37,227
You must be wondering
why I didn't call you here.

1434
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:39,275
I'll tell you why I'm here.

1435
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:41,648
"The Time Traveler's Wife's"
husband“.

1436
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:42,965
Beat me within
an inch of my life.

1437
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:44,229
He was torturing me!

1438
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:47,237
But all I told him was
everything he wanted to know.

1439
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:49,489
So, I'm here to help us gear up.

1440
01:26:49,996 --> 01:26:51,182
So we can go after him
without me.

1441
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:52,206
No!

1442
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:53,955
I'm doing this alone.

1443
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:55,123
The Juggernaut

1444
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,410
will kill you all.
Fair enough.

1445
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:58,498
I just need a couple of
hours to get some legs

1446
01:26:58,588 --> 01:26:59,669
under me.
What will you do?

1447
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:01,109
I don't care
what the kid did to me.

1448
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:02,419
I ain't letting Cable
get to him,

1449
01:27:02,509 --> 01:27:03,861
even if I have to
teabag him to death.

1450
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:05,876
It's really just a sip of tea
at this point.

1451
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:07,712
Zip it, black Black Widow!
I'm flowing.

1452
01:27:07,806 --> 01:27:08,866
The first order of business is

1453
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:10,034
to get me in front of Cable...

1454
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:11,744
so I can pull all the fucking
blood out of his body...

1455
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:14,100
and fashion his bones
into holiday jewelry.

1456
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:15,928
Then, I'm gonna take his skin...

1457
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:19,105
and stretch it out
over a homemade mating drum.

1458
01:27:20,694 --> 01:27:22,294
He's standing right
behind you, isn't he?

1459
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:32,695
What in the ass?

1460
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:36,081
Is this apartment listed
on Tinder? Grindr?

1461
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:38,913
You picked the wrong shithole
to fuck, future boy.

1462
01:27:39,463 --> 01:27:42,000
Ugh. Is that really necessary?

1463
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:46,921
No. It's his
"Basic Instinct."

1464
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:48,135
What can we help you with?

1465
01:27:48,847 --> 01:27:50,508
I'm here to proposition you.

1466
01:27:52,017 --> 01:27:53,098
On, boy!

1467
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:54,245
He's really teeing it up,
isn't he?

1468
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,351
Who gets to make the first joke?

1469
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:57,790
I think we should all do it
at the same time.

1470
01:27:57,814 --> 01:27:58,814
Good call.

1471
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:00,435
For $45, you get sucky-suck.

1472
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:01,753
I only do over
the pants, mouth stuff.

1473
01:28:01,777 --> 01:28:02,858
Fuck!

1474
01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:04,046
The Proposition has a wonderful

1475
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:05,070
Guy Pearce performance.

1476
01:28:05,155 --> 01:28:06,896
Wait, wait, wait!
I wanna do mine over.

1477
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:09,322
Give us the line again.
I need your help!

1478
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:12,155
Trust me, I'm even less happy
about this than you are...

1479
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:14,862
but you unleashed
the Juggernaut, you dumb cunt!

1480
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:17,656
I can't bring him down alone.

1481
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:19,370
So here we are.

1482
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,453
We're no longer
accepting applications

1483
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:23,912
for X-Force, unfortunately.

1484
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:25,418
Even if we were...

1485
01:28:25,509 --> 01:28:27,195
there's a wind advisory
in effect until at least...

1486
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:28,380
We don't have a lot of time.

1487
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:30,211
Your friend's about
to make his first kill.

1488
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:31,785
No offense,
but if you know so much...

1489
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:34,180
why not travel back to when
he was a baby, kill him then?

1490
01:28:34,768 --> 01:28:35,828
Or better yet, head back
a little further,

1491
01:28:35,852 --> 01:28:36,852
kill baby Hitler.

1492
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:38,894
I use a device
to slide through time.

1493
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,597
The longer I travel,
the harder it is to control.

1494
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:44,274
One to get me here,

1495
01:28:44,361 --> 01:28:45,476
one to get me home.

1496
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:46,685
Well.

1497
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:48,646
That's just lazy writing.

1498
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:50,009
Your boy's
gonna kill the headmaster

1499
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:51,569
of the orphanage tonight.

1500
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,742
After that,
he gets a real taste for it.

1501
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:56,537
Like 10-year-old
Kirsten Dunst, motherfucker!

1502
01:28:56,623 --> 01:28:58,580
So he keeps killing...

1503
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:00,123
and killing, and killing,

1504
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:01,416
and killing.

1505
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:04,962
Until one day, he kills
the wrong fucking people.

1506
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:08,916
My people.

1507
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:13,963
Relax.

1508
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:16,515
I'm retrieving something
from my utility bag.

1509
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:19,138
It's a goddamn fanny pack...

1510
01:29:19,229 --> 01:29:21,766
and you know it,
you sick son of a bitch!

1511
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:23,518
The difference is night and day.

1512
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,476
You remind me of my wife.

1513
01:29:27,654 --> 01:29:28,769
I'm sorry.

1514
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:30,299
I said, "You remind me
of my wife."

1515
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:31,676
No, I'm sorry
that you said that...

1516
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:34,442
while making heavy eye contact
and applying lip balm.

1517
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:35,697
She always struggled.

1518
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:38,241
But she was funny...

1519
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:40,823
and filtered her pain
through the prism of humor.

1520
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:43,917
Something I could never master.

1521
01:29:44,838 --> 01:29:47,045
It was my fault she died.

1522
01:29:48,675 --> 01:29:51,337
Itwas my job
to stop people like him.

1523
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,344
<i>I came close a few times.</i>

1524
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,221
<i>He wasn't too happy about that.</i>

1525
01:30:01,938 --> 01:30:03,053
<i>He was trying to hurt</i> me...

1526
01:30:03,148 --> 01:30:05,105
and he knew exactly
how to do it.

1527
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:10,815
Blessed are the wicked

1528
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:12,488
who are healed by my hand.

1529
01:30:15,619 --> 01:30:17,030
<i>He came into my home...</i>

1530
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:20,863
<i>and took the only thing
that made it a home.</i>

1531
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:26,451
Sound familiar?

1532
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:29,087
I'm sorry.
Uh-huh.

1533
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:30,835
No, I'm really sorry.

1534
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:35,169
But that isn't Russell.

1535
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:37,158
It doesn't have to be him.
If you knew what I knew...

1536
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:39,173
Yeah, he's got anger issues...

1537
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:40,757
maybe a small
learning disability...

1538
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:42,217
splash of diabetes...

1539
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:43,598
but nothing that can't be fixed.

1540
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:45,304
If you could go back...

1541
01:30:45,398 --> 01:30:48,060
and stop the people that took
your girl, would you?

1542
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,566
No.

1543
01:30:49,653 --> 01:30:51,360
I'd buy them all
a bouquet of hand jobs.

1544
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:53,187
Of course I fucking would!

1545
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:55,030
But I wouldn't kill a kid.

1546
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:57,107
I'm not asking you
to kill a kid!

1547
01:30:57,202 --> 01:30:58,738
I'll kill the kid.

1548
01:30:58,828 --> 01:31:02,287
I'm asking you to save
hundreds of other kids.

1549
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:04,661
Russell's gonna burn down
that orphanage.

1550
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:06,742
And I can imagine
your dead girlfriend...

1551
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:09,077
would want you to do
the right thing, wouldn't she?

1552
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:12,673
So, what's it gonna be,
handsome?

1553
01:31:13,343 --> 01:31:15,004
Give me a chance to save him.

1554
01:31:15,095 --> 01:31:16,506
You said...
What?

1555
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:18,240
Once he kills someone,
he gets a taste for it.

1556
01:31:18,264 --> 01:31:20,596
If we can get to him
before that happens...

1557
01:31:20,684 --> 01:31:22,300
promise you'll give me a chance

1558
01:31:22,394 --> 01:31:24,180
to put him on a different path.

1559
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:25,431
Define "chance."

1560
01:31:25,522 --> 01:31:26,749
I don't know.
How long does it take

1561
01:31:26,773 --> 01:31:28,125
to save someone's soul?
That's not...

1562
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:29,389
I'll give you 30 seconds.

1563
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:31,475
What? No!
Best I can do.

1564
01:31:31,569 --> 01:31:32,855
Take it or leave it.

1565
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:44,742
WEASEL I He's doing it!

1566
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:46,393
Look at the little fella.
He's doing it.

1567
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:48,333
There he goes.

1568
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:49,914
Jesus Christ!

1569
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:51,461
Just shirt-cocking it.

1570
01:31:51,548 --> 01:31:52,548
Ugh.

1571
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:54,839
There you go, little fella.

1572
01:31:55,593 --> 01:31:56,924
Go on, you're doing it!

1573
01:31:57,345 --> 01:32:00,178
My beautiful, hairless,
Twizzler-legged baby boy.

1574
01:32:02,392 --> 01:32:03,473
DOMINOI Christ!

1575
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,176
That's disturbing.

1576
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:06,681
30 seconds.

1577
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:13,558
Deal.
Deal.

1578
01:32:19,993 --> 01:32:23,031
Man, that sucks they didn't
have anything in your size.

1579
01:32:23,121 --> 01:32:25,078
I really wanted to match,
you know?

1580
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:27,156
Being a menacing team.

1581
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:28,365
Oh, man, it sucks.

1582
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:30,042
That was some
cold-ass shit, kid.

1583
01:32:31,755 --> 01:32:34,247
And that is just
the first five steps

1584
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:36,047
to a prostate-assisted orgasm.

1585
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:38,379
Where the hell are we going?

1586
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:39,710
You said it yourself.

1587
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:42,717
Nothing can stop the
Juggernaut. We need backup.

1588
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:45,549
I will bathe in the blood
of your enemies.

1589
01:32:49,898 --> 01:32:51,514
Can you turn off the music?

1590
01:32:52,525 --> 01:32:54,516
You'll do no such thing.

1591
01:32:54,694 --> 01:32:56,526
Why don't you just say it
in an Indian accent?

1592
01:32:56,613 --> 01:32:58,320
I'm sorry?
AP0|0gy accepted.

1593
01:32:58,406 --> 01:33:00,443
This is a side of you
I do not like.

1594
01:33:00,533 --> 01:33:01,533
Let me guess,

1595
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:03,429
some of your best friends
in the future are Indian.

1596
01:33:03,453 --> 01:33:04,568
What the hell are you...?

1597
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:06,573
Once again, intolerance rears
its ugly head.

1598
01:33:06,664 --> 01:33:07,904
I am so sorry.
It gets better.

1599
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:09,535
I'm not a fucking racist, moron!

1600
01:33:09,626 --> 01:33:11,492
That's precisely
what a racist would say.

1601
01:33:11,711 --> 01:33:13,327
I'm with the old white guy
on this one.

1602
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:14,627
And that's a twist.

1603
01:33:14,714 --> 01:33:15,829
When this is over...

1604
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:18,152
I'm going to fuck you to death
with your own broken feet.

1605
01:33:18,176 --> 01:33:20,292
And a sexual predator, too.
That's rich.

1606
01:33:20,386 --> 01:33:21,751
I should have finished college.

1607
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:22,927
So what exactly do you

1608
01:33:23,014 --> 01:33:24,075
do in the future, anyway, huh?

1609
01:33:24,099 --> 01:33:25,305
Some kind of soldier?

1610
01:33:25,391 --> 01:33:27,177
Yeah, something like that.

1611
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:29,430
I was a soldier.
Special Forces.

1612
01:33:29,521 --> 01:33:32,138
I bet 50 years from now,
we're bestest buddies.

1613
01:33:32,232 --> 01:33:34,189
50 years from now,
you're very dead.

1614
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:36,642
Your entire generation fucked
this planet into a coma.

1615
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:38,272
Boom!

1616
01:33:38,363 --> 01:33:39,603
Spoiler alert.

1617
01:33:40,865 --> 01:33:42,071
Planets.

1618
01:33:42,242 --> 01:33:43,778
Next time, Uber.

1619
01:33:43,868 --> 01:33:45,154
Here's a spoiler alert.

1620
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:48,115
You're not a fucking hero.

1621
01:33:48,331 --> 01:33:52,040
You're just an annoying clown
dressed up as a sex toy.

1622
01:33:52,418 --> 01:33:53,579
Well, I got news for you.

1623
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:54,956
My heart is in the right place.

1624
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:56,536
Russell's not gonna kill anyone.

1625
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:58,609
Because of me, he's gonna know
what real love looks like.

1626
01:33:58,633 --> 01:33:59,668
We're all going to die.

1627
01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:01,028
Because of you, I'll always know

1628
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:02,918
what a grown man
with baby balls looks like.

1629
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:05,341
I'm a grower, not a shower.

1630
01:34:05,515 --> 01:34:06,630
God, I wish this were a bus

1631
01:34:06,724 --> 01:34:07,910
where I could pull
the string and get out.

1632
01:34:07,934 --> 01:34:09,550
It's a good thing
Cable's not driving,

1633
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:10,644
or you'd be in the back.

1634
01:34:10,854 --> 01:34:12,640
- I am in the back.
- Right here!

1635
01:34:31,374 --> 01:34:33,035
I made mistakes!

1636
01:34:33,501 --> 01:34:35,037
I wanna take them back!

1637
01:34:35,211 --> 01:34:38,078
You trusted me.
I took that trust...

1638
01:34:38,214 --> 01:34:39,625
and turned it into a glory hole

1639
01:34:39,716 --> 01:34:41,206
in an airport bathroom.

1640
01:34:41,301 --> 01:34:44,043
The one in Minneapolis.
You know the one.

1641
01:34:44,637 --> 01:34:47,174
But even you know I'm not
a complete piece of shit.

1642
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:48,755
I was once an X-Man.

1643
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:49,885
Trainee!

1644
01:34:54,564 --> 01:34:57,056
You're still using
my Velcro labels. Aw.

1645
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:58,732
They do stick better than tape.

1646
01:34:58,818 --> 01:34:59,818
Hi, Wade!

1647
01:34:59,903 --> 01:35:00,903
Please don't.

1648
01:35:00,987 --> 01:35:03,729
Say whatever it is you're here
to say. Make it quick.

1649
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:04,823
Right. Quick.

1650
01:35:04,908 --> 01:35:06,774
It's the kid.
Just like you, I let him down.

1651
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:07,868
And just like me,

1652
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:09,221
he's never had anyone
sacrifice anything for him...

1653
01:35:09,245 --> 01:35:10,556
because the whole world
wrote him off

1654
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:11,945
as a piece of shit
a long time ago.

1655
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:13,701
Look, he's teamed up
with the Juggernaut!

1656
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:14,952
The Juggernaut!

1657
01:35:15,335 --> 01:35:17,104
Who's, like, my favorite
Marvel character ever...

1658
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:19,290
And hi, Yukio! That was really
nice of you to say hi...

1659
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:20,711
so I'm saying hi back.

1660
01:35:20,798 --> 01:35:22,129
You guys make
a super cute couple.

1661
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:23,878
Yeah. Where was I?

1662
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:25,800
Oh, yeah. You should never
meet your heroes...

1663
01:35:25,887 --> 01:35:27,548
because, honestly,
he's a bit of a dick!

1664
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:29,450
And like a lot of dicks,
he's hard as a rock...

1665
01:35:29,474 --> 01:35:30,743
and causes nothing but problems!

1666
01:35:30,767 --> 01:35:33,759
Look, you can stop the
Juggernaut. I know you can.

1667
01:35:33,853 --> 01:35:37,016
Do you know what would happen
to me if I helped you?

1668
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:39,143
I would be disgraced.

1669
01:35:39,234 --> 01:35:41,225
You are a criminal, a fugitive.

1670
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:42,809
But worst of all...

1671
01:35:42,904 --> 01:35:44,645
you broke my heart, Wade.

1672
01:35:46,324 --> 01:35:47,359
Then you know what?

1673
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:49,050
Your heart's in
the wrong place, big guy.

1674
01:35:50,245 --> 01:35:52,907
Doing the right thing
is sometimes messy...

1675
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:56,331
and fucked up, and not
particularly convenient!

1676
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:59,500
So stay here
in Chéteau ole Virgin...

1677
01:35:59,587 --> 01:36:01,703
while we go get our fuck on!

1678
01:36:04,884 --> 01:36:06,249
You're doing great.

1679
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:13,389
So you wear that helmet because

1680
01:36:13,476 --> 01:36:15,183
your brother
tries to read your mind?

1681
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:18,479
Yeah, but he's in
a wheelchair, so even-Steven.

1682
01:36:18,564 --> 01:36:21,022
Someone's coming.
It's Russell, sir.

1683
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:23,020
And he's not alone.

1684
01:36:23,111 --> 01:36:24,772
Secure the children.

1685
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:29,565
They will not replace us.

1686
01:36:29,993 --> 01:36:32,280
What do you say
we go fuck some shit up?

1687
01:36:32,829 --> 01:36:36,663
"Let's fuck some shit up"
is my legal middle name.

1688
01:36:40,003 --> 01:36:42,461
Watch my back.
I've got the old man.

1689
01:36:42,672 --> 01:36:44,208
Amen, brother.

1690
01:36:50,763 --> 01:36:52,253
Time to make the chimichangas.

1691
01:36:52,432 --> 01:36:54,048
30 seconds.

1692
01:36:54,684 --> 01:36:56,800
I finally know why I'm here.

1693
01:36:57,228 --> 01:36:59,139
I was raised in this place.

1694
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:01,437
Well, not raised.
I was tortured.

1695
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:04,357
Wow! It's your cosmic reason
for being here.

1696
01:37:04,444 --> 01:37:05,730
Shall we?
This is gonna be fun.

1697
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:06,855
DEADPOOLI Yeah!

1698
01:37:06,946 --> 01:37:08,277
Hey! Been meaning
to ask you...

1699
01:37:08,364 --> 01:37:11,607
what's with the dirty,
disgusting hobo bear?

1700
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:14,363
It's not dirt. It's the blood
of my dead daughter.

1701
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:17,279
<i>Are You Bear, God?
It's Me, Margaret.</i>

1702
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:19,030
Give me some.

1703
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:20,615
They say
laughter heals anything...

1704
01:37:20,752 --> 01:37:21,833
except, of course, that.

1705
01:37:21,919 --> 01:37:23,125
We should just cue the music.

1706
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:50,987
Welcome home, Russell.
We missed you.

1707
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,200
Russell!

1708
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:55,696
You don't need to do this!
Let's talk!

1709
01:37:56,746 --> 01:37:58,266
Why are you dressed
like the Unabomber?

1710
01:38:02,377 --> 01:38:03,377
That's why!

1711
01:38:03,461 --> 01:38:04,563
Told you this little fucker's
too far gone.

1712
01:38:04,587 --> 01:38:06,703
Zip it, Thanos!
We have a deal and you fuck...

1713
01:38:06,798 --> 01:38:08,755
Hey!

1714
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:12,418
I'm gonna shove that
cab driver right up your ass.

1715
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:15,716
My body and my hands
are so soft.

1716
01:38:15,807 --> 01:38:17,076
You should probably
head back to the car.

1717
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:18,636
I think I'll head
back to the car.

1718
01:38:19,936 --> 01:38:22,598
It works best
when you pull the trigger.

1719
01:38:25,525 --> 01:38:26,811
That gun is amazing!

1720
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:29,358
Say it!

1721
01:38:31,531 --> 01:38:34,523
You are an abomination!

1722
01:38:41,874 --> 01:38:45,117
Now, I'm gonna shove
the red guy up the old guy.

1723
01:38:45,211 --> 01:38:47,623
I believe him!
Every man for themselves!

1724
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:53,090
Gotcha!

1725
01:38:53,886 --> 01:38:55,047
Beat it, midget!

1726
01:38:58,057 --> 01:39:00,765
Hey, big 9W,
the sun's getting real low!

1727
01:39:01,185 --> 01:39:02,266
Oh, Shit fuck!

1728
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:17,741
Come here, beautiful.

1729
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:26,616
Whoo!

1730
01:39:35,845 --> 01:39:36,926
Say it!

1731
01:41:00,388 --> 01:41:01,469
You came for me.

1732
01:41:01,556 --> 01:41:02,967
I'm not giving up on you,

1733
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:05,139
and you are not
giving up on that boy.

1734
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:07,217
Who says that rules
aren't meant to be broken?

1735
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:09,552
It's time to fight dirty.

1736
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:11,061
Time to sweep the leg, Johnny.

1737
01:41:11,148 --> 01:41:13,890
Hey! Pick on someone
your own size!

1738
01:41:13,985 --> 01:41:16,022
That's such a you thing to say!

1739
01:41:16,112 --> 01:41:17,694
Go get him, tiger!

1740
01:41:18,114 --> 01:41:19,980
Big CGI fight coming up!

1741
01:41:43,055 --> 01:41:44,386
He's doing great.

1742
01:41:44,473 --> 01:41:45,679
Say it!

1743
01:41:49,854 --> 01:41:51,265
- Russell.
- Bingo!

1744
01:41:56,652 --> 01:41:58,609
You see that bus?

1745
01:41:58,696 --> 01:41:59,936
I'm gonna shove it up your ass.

1746
01:42:03,284 --> 01:42:05,241
That's right!
I'm fighting dirty!

1747
01:42:06,621 --> 01:42:07,621
Oh, great!

1748
01:42:07,663 --> 01:42:08,724
There they are!
Those freaks!

1749
01:42:08,748 --> 01:42:10,508
A bunch of armed
pedophiles in nursing shoes.

1750
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:12,452
Can I have one of those guns?

1751
01:42:13,002 --> 01:42:14,663
That's fine.
No.

1752
01:42:14,837 --> 01:42:16,669
Get off this property,
mutant scum!

1753
01:42:16,839 --> 01:42:18,039
I'm just gonna use this brick.

1754
01:42:18,591 --> 01:42:19,591
Maximum effort.

1755
01:42:25,723 --> 01:42:27,464
Who says you
can't go home again?

1756
01:42:36,567 --> 01:42:37,978
Om

1757
01:42:44,617 --> 01:42:45,617
Yeah!

1758
01:42:47,828 --> 01:42:49,159
Say it.

1759
01:42:49,538 --> 01:42:52,576
Say what you said
every time you tortured me!

1760
01:42:53,125 --> 01:42:54,125
Say it!

1761
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:57,202
Blessed are the wicked
who are healed by my hand!

1762
01:42:58,422 --> 01:43:00,038
Blessed are the wicked...

1763
01:43:00,591 --> 01:43:01,797
who are healed...

1764
01:43:02,301 --> 01:43:03,791
bV my hand.

1765
01:43:21,862 --> 01:43:23,569
You commie motherfucker!

1766
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:52,348
Oh, my God.
Did you feel that, too?

1767
01:43:53,227 --> 01:43:55,434
Only best buddies
execute pedophiles together.

1768
01:43:58,315 --> 01:44:00,522
You got 30 seconds,
you jabbering butt plug!

1769
01:44:00,693 --> 01:44:01,899
Now we're getting it.

1770
01:44:06,615 --> 01:44:08,822
I need a bus
to get you all out of here.

1771
01:44:14,165 --> 01:44:15,200
Orphans.

1772
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:17,581
Oh, geez.

1773
01:44:19,003 --> 01:44:21,586
It's time to burn
for what you've done!

1774
01:44:21,756 --> 01:44:24,248
A child should not be burdened
with such power!

1775
01:44:33,058 --> 01:44:34,139
Russell! Wait!

1776
01:44:40,149 --> 01:44:41,435
DEADPOOLI Oh!

1777
01:44:48,657 --> 01:44:50,648
Wait! He hasn't killed
anyone yet!

1778
01:44:50,826 --> 01:44:52,846
What more do you need to see?
Don't you fucking dare!

1779
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:53,951
He's just a kid!

1780
01:44:54,121 --> 01:44:55,987
Tick, tock. Meter's running!

1781
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:11,757
I'm gonna melt you down
and make a cock ring.

1782
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:34,776
I told you! Leave me alone!
Come on!

1783
01:45:35,329 --> 01:45:36,444
Listen to me!

1784
01:45:59,687 --> 01:46:01,303
That's how we do it

1785
01:46:01,397 --> 01:46:02,853
in Mother Russia.

1786
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:07,604
They say millennials are
the hardest to reach.

1787
01:46:08,988 --> 01:46:12,197
Oh, no.
You're doing amazing.

1788
01:46:13,534 --> 01:46:16,026
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta!

1789
01:46:16,453 --> 01:46:18,160
Go home, Wade!

1790
01:46:18,330 --> 01:46:20,162
You're ruining everything!

1791
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:26,710
I'm getting good at this shit.

1792
01:46:26,881 --> 01:46:27,916
Go, go, go!

1793
01:46:31,427 --> 01:46:33,259
He dies tonight, Wade.

1794
01:46:33,429 --> 01:46:34,965
You can't stop me!

1795
01:46:35,931 --> 01:46:37,672
He even runs
like a fucking pervert.

1796
01:46:37,850 --> 01:46:40,592
Like an online predator
who lost his laptop.

1797
01:46:42,021 --> 01:46:43,421
There's one bullet left
in that gun.

1798
01:46:43,564 --> 01:46:45,444
Wait, wait, wait!
Please, just give me a second!

1799
01:46:45,608 --> 01:46:46,939
I got this.

1800
01:46:47,109 --> 01:46:49,225
Russell!
Stay back! Go home, Wade!

1801
01:46:49,403 --> 01:46:51,519
Let's talk. It doesn't
have to go this way!

1802
01:46:52,114 --> 01:46:53,400
That piece of shit...

1803
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:55,464
he deserves to die
for what he did to you.

1804
01:46:55,618 --> 01:46:58,986
He hurt you badly.
Makes you wanna hurt others.

1805
01:46:59,872 --> 01:47:01,533
But if you kill him, he wins.

1806
01:47:01,707 --> 01:47:05,200
You become everything
he says you are, but worse.

1807
01:47:05,628 --> 01:47:07,084
You're just a kid.

1808
01:47:07,671 --> 01:47:09,287
You don't wanna hurt anyone.

1809
01:47:09,465 --> 01:47:10,585
How do you know what I want?

1810
01:47:10,758 --> 01:47:12,374
Because I've been inside you.

1811
01:47:13,052 --> 01:47:14,338
That came out wrong.

1812
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:16,552
I've been inside your shoes.

1813
01:47:16,722 --> 01:47:18,463
Which is also off-putting.

1814
01:47:18,641 --> 01:47:20,052
It's not a great analogy.

1815
01:47:20,142 --> 01:47:21,553
The point is...

1816
01:47:22,019 --> 01:47:23,680
there are people...

1817
01:47:23,771 --> 01:47:26,684
There are people
in this fucking world...

1818
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:29,440
besides him,
who will treat you right.

1819
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:32,227
It isn't too late.
Don't do it.

1820
01:47:37,785 --> 01:47:40,152
I never should've left
you there.

1821
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:43,780
I never should've left you
in that prison.

1822
01:47:50,881 --> 01:47:52,167
I can't trust you.

1823
01:47:53,884 --> 01:47:56,251
I can't trust anybody!

1824
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:06,476
Wonderful kid.

1825
01:48:06,981 --> 01:48:08,517
You can't stop me, Wade!

1826
01:48:10,776 --> 01:48:12,892
I got one more idea.

1827
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:15,937
It's just a really bad one,
even for me.

1828
01:48:16,031 --> 01:48:17,192
Wade, what are you doing?

1829
01:48:17,282 --> 01:48:19,002
All right. This is for
all the marbles, kid!

1830
01:48:19,702 --> 01:48:21,409
You're gonna kill
someone today...

1831
01:48:21,829 --> 01:48:23,115
Blessed are the wicked...

1832
01:48:23,288 --> 01:48:25,199
then it's gotta be me.

1833
01:48:26,291 --> 01:48:28,202
Who are healed by my hand!

1834
01:48:31,338 --> 01:48:33,750
Fuck this!

1835
01:49:34,485 --> 01:49:37,443
Tell me they got that
in slow motion.

1836
01:49:42,451 --> 01:49:43,941
Oh, that's not good.

1837
01:49:45,537 --> 01:49:46,948
No, sir.

1838
01:49:54,588 --> 01:49:57,501
You sacrificed yourself for me.

1839
01:49:57,925 --> 01:49:59,040
Yeah.

1840
01:49:59,134 --> 01:50:01,341
And it was the best thing
I ever did.

1841
01:50:03,305 --> 01:50:05,387
I told you I care about you.

1842
01:50:05,474 --> 01:50:07,215
You're a good kid, Russell.

1843
01:50:08,936 --> 01:50:10,017
Hey.

1844
01:50:11,313 --> 01:50:12,519
The bear.

1845
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:13,971
It worked.

1846
01:50:20,948 --> 01:50:22,438
Because of you.

1847
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:24,903
No, Wade, because of you.

1848
01:50:25,786 --> 01:50:27,823
Stop, stop, stop!

1849
01:50:27,913 --> 01:50:29,074
Stop!

1850
01:50:30,249 --> 01:50:32,786
Just let it happen, okay?

1851
01:50:33,252 --> 01:50:36,165
I guess my heart was finally
in the right place.

1852
01:50:37,005 --> 01:50:39,417
That riddle is so fucked up.

1853
01:50:44,221 --> 01:50:46,508
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1854
01:50:46,682 --> 01:50:47,797
Don't be. Don't be.

1855
01:50:47,891 --> 01:50:49,811
I've been trying to make
this happen for a while.

1856
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:51,846
Please, just don't leave me.

1857
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:53,510
I don't wanna die
without an audience.

1858
01:50:53,689 --> 01:50:55,179
We are not going anywhere.

1859
01:50:55,357 --> 01:50:57,439
Oh, God, I hope
the Academy is watching.

1860
01:50:57,526 --> 01:50:58,641
Just rest, okay?

1861
01:51:00,487 --> 01:51:01,568
Papa.

1862
01:51:03,782 --> 01:51:05,739
<i>Papa, can you hear me?</i>

1863
01:51:07,995 --> 01:51:13,991
<i>Papa, can you find me
in the night?</i>

1864
01:51:35,272 --> 01:51:36,512
Before I go...

1865
01:51:37,065 --> 01:51:38,772
Sorry, I got a bit more in me.

1866
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:40,474
Domino.

1867
01:51:40,652 --> 01:51:45,146
I want you to have
my Adventure Time watch.

1868
01:51:47,743 --> 01:51:50,610
Turns out
that I'm the lucky one.

1869
01:51:51,371 --> 01:51:52,486
Thank you.

1870
01:51:53,832 --> 01:51:56,745
Hey, SabHna, the Teenage Witch.

1871
01:51:57,127 --> 01:51:59,289
I liked you better
with your hair short.

1872
01:51:59,463 --> 01:52:00,624
Think everyone did.

1873
01:52:01,423 --> 01:52:04,131
Hi, Yukio.
Hi, Wade!

1874
01:52:06,178 --> 01:52:07,259
And you...

1875
01:52:07,804 --> 01:52:08,919
Chrome Bone.

1876
01:52:09,848 --> 01:52:12,215
I haven't always been
the best friend to you.

1877
01:52:12,809 --> 01:52:15,050
But you've always been
that to me.

1878
01:52:15,145 --> 01:52:16,510
So thank you.

1879
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:20,272
Say "fuck" for me.

1880
01:52:21,109 --> 01:52:22,349
Just once. Come on,

1881
01:52:22,444 --> 01:52:24,026
we'll do it together.
It's no big deal.

1882
01:52:24,112 --> 01:52:27,104
Here we go. One, two, three.
F... F... F...

1883
01:52:27,199 --> 01:52:28,199
Fuck.

1884
01:52:28,367 --> 01:52:31,701
Wow! Enjoy hell, swamp mouth.

1885
01:52:33,038 --> 01:52:35,279
And you, Cable.

1886
01:52:36,166 --> 01:52:39,830
You get back to your family.
You tell 'em Wade says hi.

1887
01:52:40,712 --> 01:52:43,921
And promise me.
Promise me one thing.

1888
01:52:44,383 --> 01:52:45,748
That you'll start
judging people...

1889
01:52:45,842 --> 01:52:47,173
not by the color of their skin,

1890
01:52:47,261 --> 01:52:49,127
but by the content
of their character.

1891
01:52:49,888 --> 01:52:51,470
- Jesus.
- R-Dog?

1892
01:52:52,683 --> 01:52:54,594
There you are. Hey!

1893
01:52:55,185 --> 01:52:56,926
You're a superhero now, bubba.

1894
01:52:57,437 --> 01:53:00,395
That's why it's high time
that you had a super suit.

1895
01:53:00,482 --> 01:53:01,847
This one is yours.

1896
01:53:01,942 --> 01:53:03,649
You might wanna
get it steam cleaned.

1897
01:53:03,735 --> 01:53:05,100
Especially around the pants.

1898
01:53:05,195 --> 01:53:06,902
And let it out
a little in the waist.

1899
01:53:07,864 --> 01:53:08,864
But, hey.

1900
01:53:09,908 --> 01:53:10,989
Look.

1901
01:53:11,285 --> 01:53:13,902
Family is not an F-word.

1902
01:53:14,663 --> 01:53:15,949
All right?

1903
01:53:16,039 --> 01:53:17,905
There's one out there for you.

1904
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:20,207
Just keep looking, okay?

1905
01:53:23,714 --> 01:53:26,456
Guys, for a second there...

1906
01:53:27,301 --> 01:53:29,417
we made a pretty good team.

1907
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:46,475
Oh, it's so hard to go.

1908
01:53:47,988 --> 01:53:50,355
I just love being around
you guys so much.

1909
01:53:51,450 --> 01:53:52,690
So, so much.

1910
01:53:53,410 --> 01:53:54,741
Mmm.

1911
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:56,990
No, I can feel it now.
Here it comes, yeah.

1912
01:53:57,706 --> 01:54:01,449
I feel the soul
exiting the husk.

1913
01:54:01,543 --> 01:54:02,543
Yeah.

1914
01:54:04,421 --> 01:54:06,253
Can you see it?

1915
01:54:06,965 --> 01:54:09,127
Do you see
that beautiful bright light?

1916
01:54:10,594 --> 01:54:11,755
There it is.

1917
01:54:18,018 --> 01:54:19,224
Oh, that's the sun.

1918
01:54:19,311 --> 01:54:21,143
Don't stare directly into that.

1919
01:54:21,229 --> 01:54:22,640
I just have a few final words.

1920
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:26,265
Woodpecker.

1921
01:54:27,069 --> 01:54:28,400
Gingivitis.

1922
01:54:30,447 --> 01:54:31,812
Codswallop.

1923
01:54:36,161 --> 01:54:38,118
<i>Do You Want to Build a Snowman?</i>

1924
01:55:53,113 --> 01:55:54,274
Sorry I'm late.

1925
01:55:54,364 --> 01:55:56,025
There was a bunch

1926
01:55:56,116 --> 01:55:57,468
of handicapable children
who were stuck in a tree.

1927
01:55:57,492 --> 01:55:58,698
No.

1928
01:55:59,786 --> 01:56:02,448
But I did have to help a kid.
Yeah.

1929
01:56:02,914 --> 01:56:04,780
He's got a terrible name.
It's just awful.

1930
01:56:04,875 --> 01:56:05,875
I tried to tell him.

1931
01:56:08,211 --> 01:56:09,622
Is this heaven?

1932
01:56:10,505 --> 01:56:11,711
It is now.

1933
01:56:15,177 --> 01:56:17,043
I am so sorry.

1934
01:56:17,888 --> 01:56:19,219
It's okay.

1935
01:56:39,075 --> 01:56:40,941
I missed you so much.

1936
01:56:46,541 --> 01:56:48,202
What is it? What's wrong?

1937
01:56:50,128 --> 01:56:51,618
It's not time.

1938
01:56:52,255 --> 01:56:54,121
What do you mean it's not time?

1939
01:56:54,299 --> 01:56:55,789
I'm here, I made it.

1940
01:56:55,967 --> 01:56:57,628
You can't stay.
No, no, no.

1941
01:56:57,719 --> 01:57:00,336
I'm staying. I'm not going
anywhere without you.

1942
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:01,430
It's okay.

1943
01:57:01,932 --> 01:57:04,765
There's a time for us.
It's just not now.

1944
01:57:05,769 --> 01:57:08,227
Who?
They need you.

1945
01:57:10,273 --> 01:57:11,559
Your F-word.

1946
01:57:12,817 --> 01:57:13,817
Why?

1947
01:57:13,902 --> 01:57:14,902
You'll find out.

1948
01:57:16,154 --> 01:57:17,690
It's all right. I'll be here.

1949
01:57:19,074 --> 01:57:21,190
It's pretty fucking
awesome up here.

1950
01:57:21,910 --> 01:57:23,742
I can have anything I want.

1951
01:57:23,828 --> 01:57:25,944
Can every day be
International Women's Day?

1952
01:57:26,039 --> 01:57:27,404
It is heaven.

1953
01:57:27,624 --> 01:57:28,864
I love you.

1954
01:57:31,378 --> 01:57:34,120
I know. I love you, too.

1955
01:57:34,714 --> 01:57:36,125
Now, go.

1956
01:57:37,008 --> 01:57:38,999
Go on. Go, get out of here.

1957
01:57:40,053 --> 01:57:41,053
Go.

1958
01:57:43,848 --> 01:57:44,848
Hey!

1959
01:57:47,852 --> 01:57:50,014
Kiss me like you miss me, Red.

1960
01:57:50,647 --> 01:57:51,762
Well, come here.

1961
01:58:11,126 --> 01:58:12,742
Don't fuck Elvis.

1962
01:58:12,877 --> 01:58:14,618
Ooh, too late.
I'm sorry?

1963
01:58:24,139 --> 01:58:25,345
Time to make the chimichangas.

1964
01:58:25,432 --> 01:58:26,513
30 seconds.

1965
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:27,806
Hey. Been meaning
to ask you...

1966
01:58:27,892 --> 01:58:30,350
what's with the creepy,
dirty hobo bear?

1967
01:58:30,437 --> 01:58:32,178
It's my daughter's teddy bear.

1968
01:58:32,647 --> 01:58:33,933
Her name's Hope.

1969
01:58:34,232 --> 01:58:35,347
DEADPOOLI Well...

1970
01:58:36,192 --> 01:58:38,058
What are you doing?

1971
01:58:38,153 --> 01:58:39,735
Somebody swiped right.

1972
01:58:52,542 --> 01:58:54,909
Tell me they got that
in slow motion.

1973
01:58:58,256 --> 01:58:59,997
You sacrificed yourself for me.

1974
01:59:00,091 --> 01:59:01,581
It would seem I...

1975
01:59:03,762 --> 01:59:05,048
Huh?

1976
01:59:06,181 --> 01:59:08,513
Genuine, high-grade lead.

1977
01:59:10,435 --> 01:59:13,427
You time-sliding son of a bitch!

1978
01:59:13,521 --> 01:59:15,103
You did this for me?

1979
01:59:16,983 --> 01:59:19,475
Wait. You can't go back.

1980
01:59:20,111 --> 01:59:21,351
You used the last of your fuel.

1981
01:59:21,446 --> 01:59:23,153
What about your girl, your wife?

1982
01:59:23,239 --> 01:59:26,482
Now, my family's safe.
And I didn't do it for you.

1983
01:59:27,952 --> 01:59:30,364
No, I'm gonna stick around
for a while...

1984
01:59:30,455 --> 01:59:31,661
and make sure the world

1985
01:59:31,748 --> 01:59:33,455
doesn't shit itself
into oblivion.

1986
01:59:34,167 --> 01:59:37,034
No. You did it for me.

1987
01:59:37,796 --> 01:59:39,127
No, I didn't.

1988
01:59:39,297 --> 01:59:40,662
You did.
I really didn't.

1989
01:59:40,757 --> 01:59:42,597
Pretty sure you did.
No, I'm positive I didn't.

1990
01:59:42,634 --> 01:59:44,375
Fine. All right,
let's flip a coin. Okay?

1991
01:59:44,469 --> 01:59:47,177
Heads, you did it for me.
Tails, you did it for me.

1992
01:59:47,263 --> 01:59:49,675
I'm not even gonna look,
because you did it for me.

1993
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:51,100
Say it again.

1994
01:59:51,267 --> 01:59:52,803
- He did it for me.
- Jesus.

1995
01:59:52,894 --> 01:59:54,705
We must get the collar off.
Forget it. It's no use.

1996
01:59:54,729 --> 01:59:56,595
These collars
don't just come off.

1997
01:59:56,690 --> 01:59:57,690
Wade.

1998
01:59:58,233 --> 01:59:59,849
I have an idea.

1999
02:00:00,193 --> 02:00:02,275
No, no, no!
Let's not do that. Please!

2000
02:00:02,362 --> 02:00:04,729
I'd rather die of cancer.
Let's just...

2001
02:00:04,823 --> 02:00:07,941
Oh, God! They do say the pen
is grosser than the sword.

2002
02:00:08,034 --> 02:00:10,275
We need the code.

2003
02:00:10,370 --> 02:00:12,236
Try, uh, seven?

2004
02:00:12,330 --> 02:00:13,866
Settle down, Captain Lucky.

2005
02:00:13,957 --> 02:00:15,368
It's not gonna be one number.

2006
02:00:15,458 --> 02:00:16,618
Oh, God, that's lazy writing.

2007
02:00:17,544 --> 02:00:18,875
I still got it.

2008
02:00:21,923 --> 02:00:23,880
Put that back
in your prison wallet.

2009
02:00:25,593 --> 02:00:27,459
I don't know how to thank you.

2010
02:00:27,554 --> 02:00:29,044
But I do know how to hug you.

2011
02:00:29,514 --> 02:00:30,754
Yes.

2012
02:00:30,849 --> 02:00:32,305
Here we go. Bring it in.

2013
02:00:32,392 --> 02:00:33,392
Come on.

2014
02:00:33,518 --> 02:00:34,804
Pelvis to pelvis.

2015
02:00:34,978 --> 02:00:36,218
Let's go tip to tip.

2016
02:00:36,396 --> 02:00:38,888
There we go.
The kids call this docking.

2017
02:00:40,650 --> 02:00:41,770
Is there a knife in my dick?

2018
02:00:41,860 --> 02:00:44,088
There's a knife in your dick.
I'm just gonna back up now.

2019
02:00:44,112 --> 02:00:45,944
Yeah, yeah.
No need to go full Yentl.

2020
02:00:46,030 --> 02:00:48,692
Gonna pretend
like that never happened.

2021
02:00:48,867 --> 02:00:50,778
Let's go home, Russell.

2022
02:00:54,456 --> 02:00:56,197
All you dirty mutants

2023
02:00:56,291 --> 02:00:58,703
are gonna rot in hell
with the boy!

2024
02:00:58,877 --> 02:01:01,835
Your souls
are beyond redemption!

2025
02:01:02,005 --> 02:01:03,245
Let's see your soul, perv!

2026
02:01:03,339 --> 02:01:06,127
No, no! No! No more!
We're better than that!

2027
02:01:06,217 --> 02:01:07,378
We're better than him!

2028
02:01:07,469 --> 02:01:10,131
No more senseless violence!
No more bloodshed!

2029
02:01:10,221 --> 02:01:11,757
We'll let karma
take care of him.

2030
02:01:11,848 --> 02:01:14,840
The day of reckoning is here!

2031
02:01:24,194 --> 02:01:26,185
I'm gonna miss him.
He seemed great.

2032
02:01:26,321 --> 02:01:27,482
Whoo!

2033
02:01:27,572 --> 02:01:29,062
Courage, motherfuckers!

2034
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:30,480
And karma, motherfucker.

2035
02:01:30,575 --> 02:01:32,178
I could hear you
coming the last 30 seconds.

2036
02:01:32,202 --> 02:01:34,159
I could barely keep
a straight face.

2037
02:01:34,245 --> 02:01:36,031
I want some more.

2038
02:01:36,206 --> 02:01:37,867
I bet you do, Brown Panther.

2039
02:01:37,957 --> 02:01:40,949
We should leave
before Fuckernaut wakes up.

2040
02:01:41,544 --> 02:01:43,660
Good call.
You guys coming with us?

2041
02:01:43,838 --> 02:01:45,749
No, we'll get the kids
back to the mansion.

2042
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:47,126
Besides, we're X-Men.

2043
02:01:47,425 --> 02:01:49,962
No, you're X-People.

2044
02:01:50,136 --> 02:01:51,422
You're exhausting.

2045
02:01:51,513 --> 02:01:53,174
I see what you did there.
Puns.

2046
02:01:53,348 --> 02:01:54,713
Our door's always open.

2047
02:01:54,808 --> 02:01:56,568
That's kind, but
I'm not ready to date again.

2048
02:01:56,643 --> 02:01:57,643
Let alone two women.

2049
02:01:58,770 --> 02:02:00,431
God, you're a douche.

2050
02:02:00,522 --> 02:02:02,604
Bye, Wade!
Bye, Yukio!

2051
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:06,395
<i>What do you get</i>

2052
02:02:06,486 --> 02:02:07,630
<i>when you take
eight feet of chrome...</i>

2053
02:02:07,654 --> 02:02:08,769
<i>one pinch of courage...</i>

2054
02:02:08,863 --> 02:02:10,069
<i>a cup of good luck...</i>

2055
02:02:10,156 --> 02:02:11,646
<i>a dab of racism...</i>

2056
02:02:11,741 --> 02:02:12,902
<i>a splash of diabetes...</i>

2057
02:02:12,992 --> 02:02:15,324
<i>and a wheelbarrow
full of stage four cancer?</i>

2058
02:02:15,745 --> 02:02:17,907
<i>A family.</i>

2059
02:02:18,498 --> 02:02:21,581
See? <i>I didn't lie
what kind of film this was.</i>

2060
02:02:21,668 --> 02:02:23,020
<i>If there's anything
you take away today...</i>

2061
02:02:23,044 --> 02:02:26,162
<i>other than the need to Google,
"What the fuck is dubstep?"...</i>

2062
02:02:26,256 --> 02:02:29,044
<i>it's that we all need
to belong to someone.</i>

2063
02:04:26,125 --> 02:04:27,832
How something so small generates

2064
02:04:27,919 --> 02:04:29,455
enough energy
to reverse time is...

2065
02:04:29,545 --> 02:04:31,877
Oh, just fix it, Eleven,

2066
02:04:31,965 --> 02:04:34,206
or I'll take it
to the Genius Bar.

2067
02:04:34,300 --> 02:04:35,527
Cable's gonna kill you
when he finds out.

2068
02:04:35,551 --> 02:04:36,551
Never heard of him.

2069
02:04:36,636 --> 02:04:38,092
Why do you think
I'm helping him?

2070
02:04:39,389 --> 02:04:41,596
The Lord works
in mysterious ways,

2071
02:04:41,683 --> 02:04:43,924
don't I? A good day.

2072
02:04:44,686 --> 02:04:45,686
<i>Eve, Warm!</i>

2073
02:04:46,187 --> 02:04:47,187
Bye, Yukio!

2074
02:04:48,523 --> 02:04:50,730
That was probably a bad idea.

2075
02:04:51,067 --> 02:04:52,182
What have we done?

2076
02:05:10,628 --> 02:05:12,619
I hope we sharpened
the cream cheese spreader.

2077
02:05:22,807 --> 02:05:24,263
I'll be right back!

2078
02:05:26,227 --> 02:05:28,764
We're definitely naming
our kid Cher!

2079
02:05:29,147 --> 02:05:30,147
Whoo!

2080
02:05:31,983 --> 02:05:33,223
Peter!

2081
02:05:33,317 --> 02:05:34,853
Whoo! X-Force!

2082
02:05:34,944 --> 02:05:37,151
Walk away! Just walk away!

2083
02:05:38,031 --> 02:05:39,863
But we're X-Force!
Nope! We're not.

2084
02:05:40,074 --> 02:05:41,405
X-Force is just a marketing tool

2085
02:05:41,492 --> 02:05:42,732
designed by Fox executives...

2086
02:05:42,827 --> 02:05:44,488
to keep Josh Brolin employed.

2087
02:05:44,579 --> 02:05:45,865
It doesn't exist.

2088
02:05:46,122 --> 02:05:49,331
All right, well,
this has been pretty scary!

2089
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:51,036
And I need to feed my cat!

2090
02:05:51,210 --> 02:05:53,577
Go home, Sugarbear. Go home.

2091
02:05:53,755 --> 02:05:56,998
Okay. Will you give
Domino my email?

2092
02:06:06,184 --> 02:06:08,050
Wade, is that you?

2093
02:06:10,313 --> 02:06:11,644
I guess Stryker finally

2094
02:06:11,731 --> 02:06:13,096
figured out how to shut you up.

2095
02:06:19,697 --> 02:06:22,940
Hey! It's me!
Don't scratch!

2096
02:06:23,117 --> 02:06:25,108
Just cleaning up the timelines!

2097
02:06:25,203 --> 02:06:28,992
Look, eventually you're
going to hang up the claws...

2098
02:06:29,082 --> 02:06:31,323
and it's gonna make
a lot of people very sad.

2099
02:06:31,709 --> 02:06:32,709
Huh?

2100
02:06:32,794 --> 02:06:34,480
But one day, your old pal
Wade's gonna ask you...

2101
02:06:34,504 --> 02:06:36,461
to get back in the saddle again.

2102
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:39,877
And when he does, say yes.

2103
02:06:41,135 --> 02:06:43,092
Oh, right.

2104
02:06:44,013 --> 02:06:45,299
Love you!

2105
02:06:47,683 --> 02:06:49,299
Goddamn, that's beautiful.

2106
02:06:56,692 --> 02:06:58,524
You're welcome, Canada.

2107
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:12,201
Boy howdy.

2108
02:07:14,085 --> 02:07:16,952
Hi. This is a toughie.

2109
02:07:17,046 --> 02:07:18,046
Yeesh.

2110
02:07:18,339 --> 02:07:20,751
Oh, yes. You're already
practicing your salute, huh?

2111
02:07:21,968 --> 02:07:24,756
Yes, you are. Well, we'll
take care of that, won't we?

2112
02:07:24,846 --> 02:07:27,634
Jesus Christ! This is
so much harder than I thought.

2113
02:07:28,474 --> 02:07:30,056
Oh, I'm going to hell.

2114
02:07:30,143 --> 02:07:31,725
That makes two of us.

2115
02:07:31,894 --> 02:07:32,975
You can do this.

2116
02:07:33,146 --> 02:07:36,138
This is crazy. This is crazy.
This is crazy. This is crazy.

2117
02:07:36,232 --> 02:07:37,393
All right.

2118
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:46,651
Maximum effort.

2119
02:13:24,830 --> 02:13:27,071
That's okay.
Let me see here.

2120
02:13:27,166 --> 02:13:28,622
Oh, God.

2121
02:13:28,709 --> 02:13:30,620
That's why you're
such a little bastard.

2122
02:13:30,711 --> 02:13:32,622
No one's ever changed you.

2123
02:13:33,130 --> 02:13:35,838
Yeah, you got a big, old
stinky in there, don't you?

2124
02:13:35,925 --> 02:13:38,383
God, it smells like
Hitler's anus...

2125
02:13:38,761 --> 02:13:41,298
which would makes sense,
wouldn't it'? Yeah.

2126
02:13:41,388 --> 02:13:42,503
I think we both know

2127
02:13:42,598 --> 02:13:43,783
I don't have
what it takes to do this...

2128
02:13:43,807 --> 02:13:46,174
so I'm just gonna change
your diaper real quick...

2129
02:13:46,268 --> 02:13:48,205
and then I'm gonna come back
with my friend, Cable.

2130
02:13:48,229 --> 02:13:49,560
He loves killing kids.
