1
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:07,833
Where did it all begin?

2
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,500
Where did things begin?

3
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,125
In the past?

4
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:20,708
In the future?

5
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,791
Who can say where it began?

6
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,000
Welcome to the future.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,250
I want all this sick shit to stop!

8
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:40,416
Will we ever be capable of knowing

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,583
the origin of all things?

10
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,041
Or is there still an origin before that?

11
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:48,375
And before that?

12
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:50,583
And before that?

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,333
Do beginning and end even exist?

14
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,708
Or is it

15
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,916
all connected in an endless loop,

16
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,833
and are "beginning" and "end"

17
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,583
just different words

18
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,750
for one and the same moment?

19
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,416
Mikkel?

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,958
Mikkel!

21
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,166
Somehow, sometime

22
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,583
The future starts somewhere

23
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,000
I won't wait much longer now

24
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:56,916
Love is created through bravery
So don't think about it twice

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,291
We ride on fiery wheels
Towards the future through the night

26
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,333
Boo!

27
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:27,958
Good morning.

28
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,333
Good morning, sleepyhead.

29
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,250
So?

30
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,666
-What are your plans?
-I'm off to the lake with the others.

31
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,583
It's supposed to storm later, you know?

32
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,208
-Morning.
-Morning.

33
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,083
Don't forget
Katharina and Ulrich's party today.

34
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,750
-Don't be back so late again, okay?
-Yeah.

35
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,458
Sure you don't want to come?

36
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,166
Anyone want coffee?

37
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:13,583
Fuck.

38
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,708
Right. I've got to go.

39
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:37,666
You okay, Dad?

40
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,833
Yeah, I'm fine.

41
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,041
Everything's all right.

42
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,000
I just had déjà vu...

43
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,166
Okay. See you later.

44
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,500
Don't you think it'd be good
if you got out?

45
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,708
Won't you at least try?

46
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,791
For me.

47
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,291
I still have to finish my picture.

48
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:15,333
JUNE 20, 2019

49
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:22,083
THE DAY BEFORE
MICHAEL COMMITS SUICIDE

50
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,541
What's up?

51
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,791
I've got so much to do today.

52
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,541
I'm getting my period
and haven't shaved in ages.

53
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,333
-I'm sorry.
-I don't care.

54
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,958
-Sorry. I can't.
-You can.

55
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:38,125
-Ulrich, I can't.
-Couldn't you guys knock for once?

56
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,583
I think I'm sick.

57
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,375
I'm covered in red spots.

58
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,291
Maybe I have dengue fever?

59
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,833
Come here.

60
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,500
Shit!

61
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,750
You've got rubella.

62
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:04,250
You had to pick
today of all days for this?

63
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,375
Come on, we're going to the doctor's.

64
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,250
MURDER IN MARBURG UNSOLVED
33 YEARS LATER

65
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,916
SEARCH FOR TWO FUGITIVE PERPS
STILL ON

66
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,500
Will you come by later?

67
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,791
-This afternoon, to the hotel for lunch.
-Yes, of course.

68
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,208
Is everything all right?

69
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:45,916
Yes.

70
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,750
Are you sure?

71
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,666
Till later then.

72
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,333
Hey!

73
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,666
Where are the kids?

74
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,291
I was at the nursing home.

75
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,291
Shall we just go on like this?

76
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,666
That you won't believe anything I say?

77
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,291
Say something!

78
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,166
Maybe this is why all this happened.

79
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,541
Because I get nothing from you. Nothing.

80
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,083
It's as if you're dead inside.

81
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,916
About tonight...

82
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:20,000
I think it's best
if I go to the Nielsens' alone.

83
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,916
Do you know
about the lady who drowned here?

84
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,416
Stop it!

85
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,625
When the water is clear
you can see her dress down there.

86
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:53,291
And sometimes you feel her hands
on your feet while swimming.

87
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,125
But that's not the worst thing.

88
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,708
The worst thing is, when she's hungry.

89
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,916
Then she drags people down to her.

90
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,250
Asshole!

91
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,250
Ha-ha, real funny.

92
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,666
You coming tonight?

93
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,041
I think so.

94
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,958
I sometimes wonder
if my parents are really happy together.

95
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,916
Or if people just make do
with what they have.

96
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,541
Are your parents happy?

97
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,958
No idea.

98
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:39,875
What's that?

99
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,625
Looks pretty old.

100
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,541
That's Saint Christopher.

101
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,041
The patron saint of travelers.

102
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,958
Don't ask.

103
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,250
Hey, Jonas.

104
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,500
Weren't you guys going to the lake?

105
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,125
Martha and Magnus left long ago.

106
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,666
Ultimate fist bump?

107
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,500
Don't touch that pestilent boy.
He has rubella.

108
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,541
Where's your bike?

109
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,625
Should we give you a ride?

110
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,541
See you tonight then.

111
00:13:56,625 --> 00:14:00,583
I know one person who'd be really glad
if you came, and it's not Magnus.

112
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,916
-Ulrich!
-Why?

113
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,625
It's no secret Martha's nuts about him.

114
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,833
Stop it!

115
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,666
Come on, get in.
We'll drop you off at the lake.

116
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,750
No, it's okay. Really.

117
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,333
-All right.
-Okay.

118
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,000
Then see you later, Romeo.

119
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,583
Gosh.

120
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,291
Magnus?

121
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,333
You weren't moving and I...

122
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,458
I... I thought you were dead.
He said there was a dead body there.

123
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,041
Still plenty alive.

124
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,291
Cool.

125
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,083
ARIADNE
A STAGE PLAY

126
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,041
Something up?

127
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,500
I was...

128
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,583
I was just thinking...

129
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,416
Wouldn't you sometimes like to know
what happens next?

130
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:02,916
You mean in the future?

131
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,416
Yes, or...

132
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,958
maybe just in the next five minutes.

133
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:15,458
I...

134
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,500
sometimes get this feeling

135
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,291
that something is about to happen.

136
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,458
You know?

137
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,250
Attack!

138
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,666
Fuck!

139
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:44,458
What's up?

140
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,208
I've got to go.

141
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,625
Where?

142
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,416
We gave Grandma Ines
a tablet for her birthday.

143
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,125
-I'm supposed to show her how it works.
-Okay.

144
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,333
Then...

145
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,083
see you later.

146
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,500
Jonas?

147
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,541
Why do you have a raincoat?

148
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,083
Because it's supposed to rain later.

149
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,083
Well, then...

150
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,708
Weren't you leaving?

151
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,250
Everything okay?

152
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,583
I thought I still had time.

153
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,666
Why do people say that anyway?

154
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,458
"To have time."

155
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,833
How can you have time
when it clearly has you?

156
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,208
Has something happened?

157
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,000
You're different somehow.

158
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,416
I wanted to tell you something.

159
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,208
I've wanted to for a long time.

160
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,750
I think we're a perfect match.

161
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,916
Never think anything else.

162
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,958
I've got to go now.

163
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,916
-Hi.
-Hello.

164
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,208
Hey.
Did Captain Nielsen make you work too?

165
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,125
All the best on your wedding anniversary.

166
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:26,458
Crazy, isn't it? It's been 25 years.
Thanks for the glasses, Hannah.

167
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,791
No problem at all.

168
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,916
Well, who would have thought that?

169
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,208
25 years.

170
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,250
-I need to pee.
-Just go on the tree there.

171
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,583
Can he use your bathroom?

172
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,583
Hannah?

173
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,583
Hello?

174
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:07,041
-Right, then go in the woods.
-No, sure. Nonsense.

175
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,500
It's just across from the front door.

176
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,916
I just had déjà vu or something.

177
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:18,250
-Mikkel has gotten big.
-He eats like an ogre.

178
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,416
-He got that from his mother.
-Hey, now!

179
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,250
Want more?

180
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,291
-See you.
-Till tomorrow.

181
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:23,958
Martha...

182
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:28,291
Sorry I can't come over later, but...

183
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:31,791
we've got a party,
for my mother and the hotel...

184
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:34,041
I just couldn't get out of it.

185
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:35,708
I just wanted to tell you that.

186
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,833
No biggie.

187
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:40,250
And I...

188
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:42,583
I really like...

189
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:45,583
your hair that way.

190
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:48,208
I mean, you look good.

191
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:50,166
With that hair.

192
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:53,958
Shit. You know what I mean.

193
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:56,666
Well...

194
00:24:58,041 --> 00:24:59,291
See you tomorrow.

195
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:01,666
Bye.

196
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,833
Bye.

197
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,125
MURDER IN MARBURG UNSOLVED
33 YEARS LATER

198
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:29,958
Wöller, it's me.

199
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:33,750
I need you to find something out for me.

200
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,000
Confidentially.

201
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:45,208
Give me your hand
I'll build a castle out of sand for you

202
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:50,250
Somehow, somewhere, somewhen

203
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,958
The time has come
For some tenderness tonight

204
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:59,208
Somehow, somewhere, somewhen

205
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,416
-Hello, Martha.
-Hi.

206
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,541
Hi.

207
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,916
Glad you made it.

208
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:08,291
Want a drink?

209
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:09,625
Yeah, sure.

210
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:11,750
Hey!

211
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:13,083
-Well?
-Hey.

212
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,958
It was meant to be a garden party,
but this is much cozier.

213
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:18,666
I brought tiramisu.

214
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:21,708
This is my favorite song. I have to dance.

215
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,583
-Where's the champagne?
-Under the table.

216
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:29,708
-Great. Thank you.
-We're so proud of you!

217
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:34,041
I guess you deserve
at least a driver's license for that.

218
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,125
-No!
-Yes.

219
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:37,208
-For real?
-I promise.

220
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:39,500
-Charlotte!
-Awesome!

221
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:41,250
-You have to dance with me.
-No.

222
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,791
-Yes!
-No. Katharina, please no.

223
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:46,625
-Hey.
-Hey.

224
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:47,750
Well?

225
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,416
Do you know where this goes?

226
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,791
Over there.

227
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,916
Where's Peter?

228
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,791
Summer cold.

229
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:01,750
And Michael?

230
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:04,291
Something similar.

231
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,958
-I'll take this over.
-Sure.

232
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,083
Champagne!

233
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:12,208
Thank you!

234
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:14,208
Hannah!

235
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:16,708
Come on, live a little.

236
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,166
Glad you came.

237
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,375
Glad you all made it! Cheers!

238
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:24,375
-Hello.
-Hello.

239
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:25,833
To our health.

240
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:31,791
-Now dance with me, old-timer.
-Sure.

241
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:03,708
Jonas?

242
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:07,875
I thought I heard something.

243
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:12,500
How come you're not at the Nielsens'?

244
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,000
Did something happen?

245
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:31,291
Hey...

246
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:36,291
Everything okay?

247
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,791
What's with your hair?

248
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:06,583
I know.

249
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:09,708
What do you know?

250
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:12,625
I know everything.

251
00:30:14,791 --> 00:30:15,875
What?

252
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:23,541
Ultimate fist bump?

253
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:30,291
What?

254
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,000
Why did you just say that?

255
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:38,666
Because I know, Dad.

256
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:42,958
I know everything.

257
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:49,000
I know your real name is Mikkel Nielsen.

258
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,416
It's okay.

259
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:00,041
Forgive me.

260
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:20,708
Even younger and prettier.

261
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:25,041
-I thought you'd pop with the third.
-How mean!

262
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:26,625
What a sweet girl.

263
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:29,458
Sweet girl? That's Magnus!

264
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:34,666
-What's wrong?
-I can't sleep.

265
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:36,416
Oh, no.

266
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:39,708
You're burning up.

267
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:44,541
- Look at these two ugly monsters.
- Let's get you upstairs.

268
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:47,000
I loved that dress.

269
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:49,125
You two are very sexy.

270
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,416
There you go.

271
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:06,958
-Sleep well. Night-night.
-Can you stay here till I fall asleep?

272
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:16,958
Slide over.

273
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:27,666
So you're from the future then?

274
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:36,750
And why are you here now?

275
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,916
Because I need to ask you for something.

276
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:44,708
What?

277
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:48,250
Not to do it.

278
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,583
Not to do what?

279
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:54,958
It's Ulrich and Katharina's anniversary.

280
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,333
You didn't go along, like always.
You stayed here.

281
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:02,000
But something was different.

282
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:05,625
I should've noticed something was up.

283
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,916
Jonas...

284
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:09,708
-I have no idea what...
-Don't lie to me!

285
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:12,500
I know! God fucking damn it!

286
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:16,541
I know you'll hang yourself in the studio.

287
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,250
Have you already written the letter?

288
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,291
What letter?

289
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:27,250
The letter you write to me.

290
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:30,208
Not to me, to the younger me.

291
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,166
The one marked: "Do not open
before November 4, 10:13 p.m."

292
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,250
DO NOT OPEN BEFORE NOVEMBER 4,
10:13 P.M.

293
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:46,541
The very minute you vanish.

294
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:01,500
I'm here so you don't do it.

295
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,458
It's all intertwined.

296
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,000
Like an endless loop.

297
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:10,375
But you...

298
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:12,166
you killing yourself,

299
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,333
that's the start.

300
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:38,666
Promise me you won't do it.

301
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:43,583
Dad, you have to promise me.

302
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,625
Please.

303
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,083
Promise.

304
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,041
You forgot this at the lake.

305
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:15,750
I put it on a cord.

306
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:25,000
Thanks.

307
00:35:32,916 --> 00:35:35,333
I thought about what you said at the lake.

308
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:41,625
About grandmas? And the internet?

309
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,500
I think you're right.

310
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,750
Okay.

311
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:53,375
The night you vanished,

312
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:57,208
you were there and then suddenly gone.

313
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:00,250
Did you go back to the cave?

314
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:02,791
How did you find the passage there?

315
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:06,416
I didn't find it.

316
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:09,291
Someone showed it to me.

317
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:11,958
Who?

318
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,208
You.

319
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:24,083
What do you mean?

320
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:28,375
We were by the caves.

321
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:30,541
-What'll you give me for it?
-A kick in the ass.

322
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:34,041
What's in here is easily worth 500.
It's yours for 200.

323
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:36,333
-Daddy's got plenty of money.
-Blah-blah-blah.

324
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:37,791
Stop the bullshit.

325
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:39,750
Just give it to me.

326
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Jackpot!

327
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:43,416
There was this strange noise.

328
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,375
What is that?

329
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:51,208
We were all sure someone was there.

330
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:52,833
Someone's there.

331
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:54,458
Shit.

332
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:58,083
What was that?

333
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:03,625
-Shit.
-What's going on?

334
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:05,916
What's wrong with the damn flashlights?

335
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:08,458
Come on, run!

336
00:38:08,541 --> 00:38:10,500
Now! Let's go!

337
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:21,416
We ran.

338
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,333
Then I lost you.

339
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:28,083
I turned around and you were gone.

340
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:33,625
But suddenly you were back again.

341
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:35,791
Quick!

342
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:38,333
This way.

343
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:43,458
You said there was something there,
in the forest.

344
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:45,291
Something evil.

345
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:48,250
And that we had to return to the cave.

346
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:53,000
You brought me all the way to the door,
and through the tunnel.

347
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,666
I was so afraid.

348
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,625
But you held my hand.

349
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:02,125
And then you said,
"We have to stay here, all night,

350
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:05,916
but when morning comes
everything will be all right."

351
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:08,916
And when I woke up you were gone.

352
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:15,666
All these years I've tried to understand

353
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:18,083
why you did that.

354
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:22,833
But then,
at some point it all just faded away.

355
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:26,541
It became ever more unreal, like a dream.

356
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:32,125
But that's impossible.

357
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:35,583
I never did that.

358
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:40,916
I saw myself today.

359
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:43,500
Mikkel.

360
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:45,916
It's all returning.

361
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,708
That coat, you.

362
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:50,291
As if it's all falling into place.

363
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:55,333
Maybe you're not here to stop me at all.

364
00:39:56,916 --> 00:40:00,750
But rather to show me
what it is I have to do.

365
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:03,791
Maybe you only showed me the letter

366
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:07,166
so I know what's in it,
so I go and you live.

367
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,333
No, that can't be.

368
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:11,125
That can't be.

369
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,458
He told me I could stop the origin.

370
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:16,375
If you don't kill yourself,
none of the rest will happen.

371
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:19,333
But if none of the rest happens,

372
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:21,291
you won't be born.

373
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:26,708
And maybe your role in all this
is much greater than you think.

374
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,208
And perhaps

375
00:40:28,833 --> 00:40:33,208
I'm just a small part of a huge cancer

376
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:36,708
that is much greater
than any of us can imagine.

377
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,500
-Someone has said that to me before.
-Who?

378
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:45,875
Me.

379
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:52,416
God doesn't err.

380
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:54,541
He has a plan.

381
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,208
For each of us.

382
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:11,958
I've waited a long time
for the moment we'd meet again.

383
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:15,458
Who are you?

384
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:17,791
Are you with Adam?

385
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,833
There are two sides out there.

386
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:23,958
He is the darkness.
I don't follow him, I follow the light.

387
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:25,958
He lied to you.

388
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:30,750
He brought you here to trigger everything
so it happens as it always has.

389
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:32,125
No, that can't be.

390
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:35,291
Adam wants this too.

391
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:37,708
No, he does not.

392
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,958
He doesn't want to fix things.
He wants to destroy them forever.

393
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:46,291
Your role in all of this
is much greater than you believe.

394
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:50,666
Only you alone can put an end to all this.

395
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,875
What does that mean?

396
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:56,000
We're at war,
and you have to wage it against yourself.

397
00:41:56,916 --> 00:41:58,083
Against Adam.

398
00:41:58,791 --> 00:42:00,208
But if I don't exist,

399
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:02,500
if I'm not born,

400
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:04,916
then Adam won't exist either.

401
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,125
I've seen the world without you.

402
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,625
Believe me,

403
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:13,875
it isn't what you're expecting.

404
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:18,916
There are times in life when you must see
that the decisions you make

405
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,291
affect more than your own destiny.

406
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:24,041
This isn't just about you and Mikkel.

407
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:26,708
This is about everyone.

408
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:28,416
Your mother.

409
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:29,958
Your friends.

410
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:32,416
Martha.

411
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,000
You alone can save them.

412
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:38,375
What does that mean?

413
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,583
We all have to make sacrifices.

414
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,916
Your father must make sacrifices too.

415
00:42:57,625 --> 00:42:58,916
It's okay.

416
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:18,125
Is this the apocalypse?

417
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:27,750
A bit disappointing.

418
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:30,416
I imagined it being louder.

419
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:33,250
More glaring.

420
00:44:42,958 --> 00:44:45,541
If the world ended tomorrow
and everything started anew,

421
00:44:48,666 --> 00:44:50,250
what would you wish for?

422
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:54,916
A world without Winden.

423
00:45:01,208 --> 00:45:02,125
And you?

424
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,333
Dear Jonas,

425
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:23,500
by the time you read this everything
will have already happened, irrevocably.

426
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,291
It can no longer be changed.

427
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,625
I would have liked
to explain things to you sooner,

428
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:35,041
but I hope once you understand
how everything is connected,

429
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,125
you will understand my decision.

430
00:49:39,291 --> 00:49:41,416
The truth is a strange thing.

431
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:44,708
You can try to suppress it,

432
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:47,666
but it will always find its way
to the surface.

433
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:53,708
We make a lie into our truth
in order to survive.

434
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:56,250
We try to forget.

435
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,416
Until we can't anymore.

436
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:03,000
We don't know
even half of the mysteries of this world.

437
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:06,750
We are wanderers in the darkness.

438
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:18,583
You could have told him.

439
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:21,875
You could have told him
what his task in all of this is.

440
00:50:22,666 --> 00:50:24,416
What path you really sent him down.

441
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:30,875
Not much longer
until the last cycle begins.

442
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:41,833
We all have to make sacrifices, Magnus.

443
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:10,083
