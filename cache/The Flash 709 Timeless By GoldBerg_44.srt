She's dead.

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:05,870
You killed Alexa.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,610
<font color="#138ce9">NORA:</font> Barry and I did it together.

5
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,010
That was the only way.

6
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,920
She was the strongest.

7
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,050
I needed every ounce
of power,

8
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,980
including your strength,
to kill her.

9
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,670
I'm supposed to protect
lives, not destroy them!

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,640
I'm helping you clean up
your mess, Barry.

11
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,280
This is your fault.

12
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,100
The night you brought me back,
you created these monsters.

13
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,370
You and your lightning rod.

14

<font color="#ff00ff">[UNEASY MUSIC]</font>

15
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,470
When you regained
your speed,

16
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,840
I wasn't the only thing
you two willed into existence.

17
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,950
- That's impossible.
- Really?

18
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,710
Alexa was afraid
to come here,

19
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,480
but she trusted you.

20
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,210
Why?

21
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,440
Because deep down, she could
feel a connection with you.

22
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,280
The same connection
that you feel with me now.

23
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,320
But, these new forces?

24
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,200
The way they've merged
with the people

25
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,350
they chose as avatars?

26
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,200
It's... corrupted them
because it's unnatural.

27
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,180
But once the other two
are gone...

28
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,010
I won't help you kill again.

29
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,340
Oh...

30
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,200
My beautiful boy.

31
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,770
You have no choice.

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,200
Because if you don't,

33
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,020
those things will kill everyone
you've sworn to keep safe.

34
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,970
Is that what you want?

35
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,060
Then, please, Barry...

36
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,210
help me.

37
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,260
No.

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,350
You have to help me,
damn it!

39
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,420
Nora, stop.

40
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,350
I will destroy
those other forces, Barry,

41
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,540
with or without your help.

42
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,810
Then you'll see that
I'm right.

First, Frost is sent to

and...
now Alexa's dead.

I can't let this happen
again.

56
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,200
I'll get to work.
I need to figure out

57
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,220
how Nora was able to...

58
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,830
Kill a god?

59
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,610
She could
because she had help.

60
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,930
Barry, she tricked you.

61
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,200
No, she manipulated me,

62
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,070
just like she's been doing
the whole time.

63
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,400
Honey, I know
how you feel, but...

64
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,500
not everything she did
and said was a lie.

65
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,070
I mean, there were moments
that felt real too.

66
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,200
- That must mean...
- Iris,

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,780
we can't trust her
anymore.

68
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,250
What about
what Nora said

69
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,920
about you two
creating the other forces?

70
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,160
I mean,
there's no proof.

71
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,160
Well, what if we find out
if Nora's telling the truth?

72
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,910
If she is, then that means
the other forces

73
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,710
would have been born
the same day she was.

74
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,920
I'll pull satellite scans

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,300
from the night we fought
Mirror Monarch.

76
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,450
Please, and thank you.

77
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,960
Okay, you see that cluster of
kinetic energy readings?

78
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,460
Pretty sure
that's the Speed Force

79
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,670
being reborn
in the Speed Lab.

80
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,200
Whoa. There they are.

81
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,740
Three brand-spanking-new
isotopic signatures.

82
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,240
Nora was right.

83
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,380
We created the forces.

84
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,500
Fuerza's dead.

85
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,930
Nora killed her.

86
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,140
She killed
the Strength Force?

87
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,250
And now she wants to kill
the other two forces.

88
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,610
Maybe I should go to
San Francisco.

89
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,280
What?

90
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,530
My series of photos
on Eva's attacks

91
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,160
got accepted
at a gallery there.

92

<font color="#ff00ff">[LAUGHS]</font>

94
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,030
Well,
I was thinking of going

95
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,790
to help them install
the exhibition.

96
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,760
I'd ask you to come, but I know
you have your perfect job

97
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,290
at S.T.A.R. Labs
and your amazing friends.

98
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,470
I mean... you're an OG member
of Team Flash.

99
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,250
You okay?

100
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,240
Yeah...
<font color="#ff00ff">[SIGHS]</font>

101
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,630
Yeah,
I'm fine.

102
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,120
This is an isotopic
scanning lens.

103
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,940
It can detect the signatures
of all four forces,

104
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,810
even kinetic signatures
from Speed Force Nora.

105
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,480
And if one's nearby...

106
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,110
It lights up like
an overexposed landscape.

107
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,620
In which case,
you run the other way.

108
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,420
- <font color="#ff00ff">[LAUGHS]</font>
- Okay? I'm serious.

109
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,090
I just want you to be safe.

110
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,600

113
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,810
I gotta get back... they could
have found Nora...

114
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,100
or worse, she's come back
on her own.

115
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,230
How bad is it?

116
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,920
Okay... did Nora
kill somebody else?

117
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,560
No, and I have a way to make
sure she never does.

118
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,280
Okay, how?

119
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,900
<font color="#ff00ff">[RUNNING FOOTSTEPS]</font>
I'm here.

120
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,890
What's going on?

121
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,470
I spent all night

122
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,600
coming up with a way
to fix all this.

123
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,320
Okay, what's the solve?

124
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,570
We need to wipe the new
forces out of existence.

125
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,230
Barry, what are you
saying?

126
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,520
I want to go back in time...
and uncreate them.

127
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:30,420
<font color="#ff00ff">[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC]</font>

128
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,720
Barry,
you're talking about

129
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,310
creating another
Flashpoint.

130
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,750
You know
we can't do that.

131
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,110
Not if I can figure out
a way to go back

132
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,770
that doesn't affect
the timeline.

133
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,070
- Which would be impossible.
- Barry, look.

134
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,580
I know that you're devastated
about Alexa.

135
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,950
But uncreating forces?

136
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,750
That crosses a line.

137
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,760
I convinced Alexa
to come here.

138
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,830
Her death is my fault.

139
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,000
If we don't get these new forces
out of Psych and Deon,

140
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,430
Nora will kill them, too,
so it's on us to fix this.

141
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,950
By killing Deon and Psych?
No, I'm not killing them.

142
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,520
I'm saving them from the forces
that took over their lives.

143
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,830
Whoever they were before this,
they can

144
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,340
go back to being those
same people again.

145
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,740
And what about the other
force that was born that night?

146
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,760
Nora. If you uncreate her...
We're only gonna target

147
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,010
the new forces, not Nora.
That's the plan.

148
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,790
But if something
goes wrong,

149
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,690
Barry, you might
lose your speed.

150
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,160
Then I lose my speed.
All right?

151
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,860
It's-It's worth the risk
to keep everyone safe.

152
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,760
And what about the risk
to Nora?

153
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,070
Does her life
not matter at

154
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,360
- all any...
- Nora's not a person, Iris.

155
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,320
She never was.

156
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,220
Look, if we uncreate
these forces,

157
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,010
we can put everything
back to normal.

158
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,370
Hopefully
that'll fix her too.

159
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,940
Hopefully?

160
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,100
Barry, do you hear yourself
right now?

161
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,820
Iris, I'm trying
to save people.

162
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,870
How-How do you not see
this is the right thing to do?

163
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,290
The right thing to do

164
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,730
would be trying to
get through to Nora.

165
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,750
Just like how we beat Eva,

166
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,570
just like how we talked down
Abra Kadabra.

167
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,050
- That is what we do.
- We tried talking to her.

168
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,920
All Nora did was double down.

169
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:04,770
<font color="#ff00ff">[SIGHS]</font>

170
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,260
There's no reaching her.

171
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,860
Obviously
we disagree on this.

172
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,280
Yes, we do.

173
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,310
I have to do it.

174
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,690
<font color="#ff00ff">[SOMBER MUSIC]</font>

175
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,100
Then you'll be doing it
without me.

176
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:27,970
<font color="#ffff00">♪</font>

177
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,910
Wait... you want to go
after a force of nature?

178
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,950
Yeah, if I can convince Nora
not to kill Deon and Psych,

179
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,920
then... Barry will see that
she can be reasoned with.

180
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,310
But, how do we find her?

181
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,400
I mean, she's the freakin'
Speed Force.

182
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,660
Well, if she finds us first,

183
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,350
at least we'll know
she's coming.

184
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,040
Holy crap... you guys gotta
see this.

185
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,240
You see that bright spot
at the center of you?

186
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,280
I think that's kinetic energy.

187
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,240
Guys, this is gonna sound
really wild, but...

188
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,330
Yeah, 'cause a ghost-hunting
lens isn't weird enough...

189
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,860
But, if Barry and I created
these forces,

190
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,630
what if there's a little bit of
each of them inside of us?

191
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,660
Like you're all connected?

192
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,720
Wait, Iris...
when you're over by the door,

193
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,260
your glow was brighter.

194
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,940
Like there's something
in that direction

195
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,350
that was intensifying it.

196
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,470
What if...
That something is Nora?

197
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,600
Guys, we can use me as a
divining rod to track her down.

198
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,240
Yup, that's weirder.

199
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,540
Elemental Force Particles?

200
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,930
They're the particles
that created the new forces.

201
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,840
The lightning bolt
that rebirthed the Speed Force

202
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,890
- was full of them.
- Now if we can extract

203
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,500
a sample
of these force particles

204
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,410
from the lightning,

205
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,890
then we can send out
an electromagnetic pulse

206
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,640
that'll seek out those
same particles,

207
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,460
wherever they may be
along the temporal spectrum.

208
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,600
And you can erase the new
forces from existence.

209
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,310
That's not bad.

210
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,530
Small detail, though.

211
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,840
How in the world
are you supposed to

212
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,930
extract these particles
from a giant bolt of lightning?

213
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,740
A few weeks ago when
Barry was Spock-Flash,

214
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,400
he modified the Tachyon
Enhancer to siphon

215
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,270
Mirror Monarch's
dark matter photons.

216
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,140
So all we have to do
is tweak the Enhancer

217
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,990
to siphon Force Particles
instead of photons.

218
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,690
Tweaking the
Tachyon Enhancer...

219
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,660
and then send out an EMP
to eighty-six the forces.

220
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,890
That's genius. I mean
it's foolproof, even.

221
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,780
But it still
doesn't answer

222
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,390
how we're supposed
to do this

223
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,790
and protect the timeline.

224
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,010
I'll figure out.
Somehow, I will.

225
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,960
I'll figure it out.

226
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,860
Man, I wish Nash Wells
was here.

227
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,910
I mean, he came up with
most of these equations

228
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,950
for the A.S.F. Machine.

229
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:44,200
I feel like
he'd crack this easy peasy.

230
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,110
Modify the Particle Harness
Collector.

231
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,470
I'll be back as soon as I can.

232
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,850
Roger that,
but where are you going?

233
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,730
To get the one person that
can help us pull this off.

234
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,860
Oh, no... Tess.

just mixed up his meds.

237

but... great TV.

Allen. Allen.

241
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,300
I'm guessing
this isn't a social call?

242
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,480
Not exactly.
We need your help.

243
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,930
How bad is it?

244
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,380
- That depends.
- On...

245
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,170
Whether or not you can help
us do the impossible.

- Always.

So, apparently, there's danger
in Central City.

254
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,620
Apparently.
Well, let's get busy.

255
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,600
Well, you really think

256
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,750
we can do this without
affecting the timeline?

257
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,960
I know we can.

258
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,170
As long as we use me
as your guide.

259
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,380
Harrison was there,
when the forces were created.

260
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,350
So if we used the other "him"
from that night

261
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,780
as a beacon to lock onto...

262
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,580
Hopefully I can go back
to that exact moment,

263
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,250
also bring Allen along
for the ride,

264
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,840
and he'll collect
the particles.

265
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,170
Oof, wait, so you can travel
through time with a plus one?

266
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,810
It should work...

267
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,590
When Allen and I go back
to that exact moment

268
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,550
that those dangerous forces
were created 17 days ago,

269
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,130
I will... I will create
a protective-time bubble

270
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,130
from that moment until now,

271
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,380
preserving those days
in this timeline,

272
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,240
and preventing
anything from changing.

273
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,390
Which would also allow us

274
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,980
to...
wipe out the new forces

275
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,780
without altering
any of the events

276
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,290
that have happened
since then...

277

<font color="#ff00ff">[LAUGHS]</font>

278
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,990
Yo! That is... that is trippy.

279
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,800
Cisco, this will work.

280
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,410
What about Iris?

281
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,770
When she sees everyone safe,
she'll come around.

282
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,500
She has to.

283
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,980
You're not convinced.
I wasn't either,

284
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,370
when Allen told me about this,
I thought of Tess.

285
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,470
I thought of my wife, and how
my future with Tess was...

286
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,660
ripped from me.

287
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,420
Until this gift...

288
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,960
which has allowed me to relive
every single day... with Tess,

289
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,510
but only...

290
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,510
because I took a chance.

00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,620
I'm in.

295
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,260
It's brighter.
We must be getting close.

296
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,440
She should be here.

297
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,240
Maybe it was
a false positive.

298
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,010
Maybe since Nora
is the Speed Force,

299
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,580
her isotopic signature
is all over the city by now.

300
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,680
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.

301
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,580
But we are running
out of time.

302
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,810
Well, Cisco always says
you can't solve a problem

303
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,380
till you're asking
the right question.

304
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,900
Isn't "Where's Nora's
kinetic energy leading us"

305
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,460
the right question?

306
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,750
No.

307
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,200
The right question is
"Where's Nora?"

308
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,650
We've been trying to find
the Speed Force

309
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,670
when we should be looking
for... the person.

310
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,920
So where would the real
Nora Allen go?

311
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,610
Home.

312
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,630

00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,100

00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,310
What's good, man?
You tell me.

324
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,760
Something drew me here.

325
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,180
Was it you?

326
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,920
I'm... I don't think
it was...

327

Who's this?
I'm sorry, who are you?

328
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,730
Who am I?
Who are you?

331
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,070
All right, look.

332
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,790
Barry, this is Deon.

333
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,950
Still Force.

334
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,110
And... and Deon,
this is Barry,

335
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,150
who's actually...

336
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,980
owner of this, uh,
fine establishment.

337
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,540
So you're the landlord.

338
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,290
What's that got to do
with anything?

339
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,340
Deon...

340
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,780
it's good to meet you.

341
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,540
Actually, you remember me?

342
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,370
I was with him, you called us
one of the Urkels.

343
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,330
Oh, yeah... the cornballs.

344
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,740
<font color="#ff00ff">[LAUGHS]</font>
Cornball. He's so funny.

345
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,330
Who's the egghead?

346
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,800
Harrison Wells.

347
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,090
I'm a fellow...

348
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,280
Uh, visitor to Barry's place.

349
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,840
You know, y'all are being
real friendly right now.

350
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,530
But I think...
<font color="#ff00ff">[SNICKERS]</font>

351
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,190
I think y'all are acting
like that

352
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,970
because you're afraid of me.

353
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,940
Now why is that?
No, we're just...

354
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,500
we're just making a... we're just
doing an experiment...

355
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,200

358
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,570
Now...

359
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:57,920
why do I get the feeling...

360
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,270
you're reason
I'm this way?

361
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,720
Because that's true.

362
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,920
And I'm sorry.

363
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,270
I never meant
for this to happen.

364
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,300
- So please let me fix it.
- Fix it?

365
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,770
Fix it?
So I'm a mistake?

366
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,780
- I didn't say that...
- You didn't have to.

367
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,620
I can feel it.

368
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,890
You want to destroy me.

369
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,910
No, I want to save you.

370
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,700
Deon... Deon.

371
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,220
There are three other forces...
people like you.

372
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,950
One of them?
She wants to kill you.

373
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,160
Now, she's already killed
one of the other forces...

374
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,730
the Strength Force,
and she didn't care

375
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,230
when the person containing
that force died too.

376
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:59,530
So I need to make it so the
Still Force never found you.

377
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,590
It's the only way
to keep you safe.

378

<font color="#ff00ff">[TENSE TONES]</font>

00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,310
<font color="#ff00ff">[WHISPERS]</font> Nah.

380
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,860

Oh, I get it.

382
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,460
Oh, I get it.
Yeah?

383
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,980
No, I get it. I get it.

384
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,540
This is what you're gonna
use to do it, huh?

385
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,760
This is what
you're gonna use

386
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,200
to make it like
I neverexisted?

387
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,320
Not you,
just the force inside...

388
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,970
Man, I am that force!

389
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,420
Do you have any idea
what it's like

390
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,630
to be told that you
shouldn't be here?

391
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,960
I never asked to be born.

392
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,430
Deon, listen to me.

393
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,120
Look at what you're doing.

394
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,570
Okay, you... you don't understand
what you are.

395
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,200
Yeah, I do.

396
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,580
I'm a god.

397
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,230
Maybe it's time
you understood that.

398
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,800
Deon, wait...

399
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,900
Time to bounce.

400
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,510
...right?

401
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,980
What the hell
just happened?

402
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,430
I think your friend Deon
just stopped time.

403
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,590
Yeah, he does that.

404
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,310
Why'd he leave?

405
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,160
Because I couldn't stop him.

406
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,290
Deon just aged the harness
a thousand years.

407
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,300
- How bad is it?
- Pretty bad.

408
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,980
But not hopeless.

409
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,250
See I figured if we can find
some way to...

410
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,910
somehow create some sort of...

411
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,300
I-I was working on the collection
disc when Deon showed up.

412
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,170
I figured I better hide it
just in case.

413
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,060
<font color="#ff00ff">[LAUGHS]</font>
Chester.

414
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,750
You're a lifesaver.

415
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,710
<font color="#ff00ff">[LAUGHS]</font>

416
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,480
As for the vest,

417
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,210
I'm used to working with junk.

418
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,360
I'll just need a bunch of
replacement parts

419
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,890
from my garage and she'll be up
and running in no time.

420
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,240
With a little help, that is.
I'm with you.

421
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,670
What's up?

422
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,530
I think Deon's right.

423
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,630
We can't just...

424
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,170
uncreate these forces
like that.

425
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,810
Uh... so what, we... we...

426
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,600
we should just give up?

427
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,850
On this? Yeah, we give up.

428
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,800
Doesn't that feel like
the right thing to do?

429
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,250
Cisco,
Nora will kill him

430
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,310
if I don't do something
to prevent it.

431
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,210
Just like
she killed Alexa.

432
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,790
'Cause she's not gonna stop
until all the forces...

433
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,940
and the people connected
to them... are dead.

434
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,500
Why can't you see?
I'm trying to save him.

435
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,750
He doesn't want to be
saved by you!

436
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,450
He just wants to be given
the chance to be himself.

437
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,680
And Iris understood that.

438
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,240
Look, every second that we
leave these forces

439
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,870
inside Deon and Psych,
people are in danger.

440
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,330
It's only a matter of time
before someone dies

441
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,400
in one of Psych's nightmares

442
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,340
or gets killed by some kind
of Deon time anomaly.

443
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,950
Not to mention Nora
declared war.

444
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,140
She doesn't care how many
people she kills

445
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,010
as long as the forces die.

446
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,640
You're right.
Yes, you're absolutely right.

447
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,670
And something needs to be done
about that.

448
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,830
And I don't have
all the answers.

449
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,490
All I know is...

450
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,850
this can't be it.

ight?

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,330
I... I have to uncreate
these forces.

454
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,710

I am...

Cisco has a point, man.

Harrison?

459
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,470
If uncreating these forces is

460
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,980
what you feel in your heart
is right,

461

I'll take that voyage

But all I ask is that you
think... truly think

Must be a collector
or something.

478
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,280
We can ask him
when we're done.

479
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,250
Assuming we survive.

480
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:32,100
<font color="#ff00ff">[TENSE MUSIC]</font>

481
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,310
Caitlin called me
about Alexa.

482
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,360
So it turns out,

483
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,110
when Iris and I
brought back the Speed Force,

484
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,580
we also created
three new forces.

485
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,310
It's our fault that they're out
in the world hurting people.

486
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,810
Killing them.

487
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,420
So I feel like...

488
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,390
I have to be the one
to take them out.

489
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,300
These forces.

490
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,850
You think
they're above saving, too?

491
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:10,160
I think it would be safer
for everybody if they didn't exist.

492
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,550
You remember when Wally
first showed up?

493
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:17,040
Man, it wasn't just that
I'd found out I have a son.

494
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,610
I found out

495
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,990
I have a son who kept getting
his butt in trouble.

496
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,340
Boy, he was mad
at the world.

497
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,170
There was one point

498
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:32,300
he said to me that he wished
he had never been born.

499
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,960
So I tried
to get close.

500
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,010
And he pushed me away.

501
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,310
I tried to give him space,

502
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,870
then he felt abandoned.

503
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,210
No parent is perfect.

504
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:50,180
But one thing I never
stopped doing

505
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,460
was trying.

506
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,890
And look at the man
he grew up to be.

507
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:59,560
Strong.
Kind. Good.

508
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,990
Yeah I get it, I... I do, but...

509
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,990
I mean, these forces?

510
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,860
- They're not my children.
- You sure?

511
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,660
You said it yourself.

512
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,490
You brought them
into this world.

513
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,720
Look, I know they've all done
terrible things.

514
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,030
But what if they could change?

515
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:26,750
You never judge your kids
for who they are now.

516
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,490
You help them become...

517
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,880
who they know they can be
when they grow up.

518
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,850
So lead with love.

519
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,740
After that,
it is up to them.

You're hurting them... please.

Oh, they're hurting
themselves.

536
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,610
Sure, I pull back
the curtain.

But what they see
is up to them.

Now, before I show you
your worst fear,

539
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,480
why were you
looking for me?

540
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,620
I wasn't.

541
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,640
No...

542
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:17,510
You're looking for
the Speed Force?

543
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,280
Nora. Why?

544
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,750
Why are you so desperate
to find her?

545
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,810
Is it to hurt her?

546
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,610
I want to talk to her
so I can help her.

547
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,910
Are you sure?
Because I am

548
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,270
feeling the pain that
she has inflicted upon you.

549
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,250
How deeply she's torn apart
your relationships.

550
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,510
Your whole life.

551
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,530
Actually, the suffering
she's caused is

552
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,890
- quite beautiful.
- That wasn't Nora.

553
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,730
She's lost control.
Just like you have.

554
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,760

I can help you both.

573
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,900
We did.

00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,270
And it's good to see you.

Look, this is dangerous.

583

All you need to do is
get close enough to the

584

Speed Force lightning
to collect a sample of each force.

585

The PHC and Timeless Wells'

somebody can sense my presence
in their nightmare.

620

I'm not just someone.
We have a connection.

I know you can feel
that too.

00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,820
Perhaps. It's not going to
help you, though.

623
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,630
Escape one nightmare
and I'll just serve up another.

624
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,110
Because there's always more
terror to unlock.

625
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,110
But before you
had those powers,

626
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:48,310
before you became a force.
You were a person.

627
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,570
I'm talking to that person
right now.

628

I have a team.

They can help you fight this
monster that's inside of you.

630
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,290
We can help you regain control
of your body.

631
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:00,160
What makes you think
I'm not in control?

632
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:03,480
I know you didn't...
choose to have these powers.

633
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,090
And you shouldn't have
to go through this alone.

Perhaps they are.
Somewhere.

I went looking for Nora.

703
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,200
I thought that if I could just
talk to her,

704
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,290
that I could fix everything.

705

But, um.

706
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:56,290
I ended up finding Psych
instead.

707
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,900
You were right.

708
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,980
I couldn't get through to him.

709
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,470
And it probably would have been
the same with Nora.

710
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,140
I should have
listened to you.

711
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,760
No, I'm the one who should
have listened.

712
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:13,140
Harrison told me about
the birth of the forces.

713
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,220
Sounds incredible.

714
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,820
It was.

715
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,260
Can't believe how close I came
to erasing them.

716
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:24,800
- What changed your mind?
- You.

717
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,320

Everyone.

718
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:30,680
Even the forces themselves.

719
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,730
I could...

720
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,970
I could feel
how they would affect the future.

721
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:41,020
All the speedsters' and heroes'
lives they'd shape.

722
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:44,030
Some of them were family,
Iris.

723
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,040
Our family.

724
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:50,240
Barry, we both know
how dangerous these forces can be.

725
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,780
I mean, if you couldn't
uncreate them,

726
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,550
and I couldn't get through
to Psych...

727
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:56,440

Try again.

that we can't judge

for who they are now.

with the Strength Force.
