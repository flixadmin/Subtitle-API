00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:29,923
EPISODE 12

10
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,055
There are many tourists.

11
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:42,310
I know. Until a few years ago,
only fishers and herb gatherers visited.

12
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,311
What changed?

13
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:46,773
A few years ago,
the villagers had a meeting

14
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,317
and sold some land to out-of-towners.

15
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,279
Then out-of-towners opened
resorts and cafés on the island.

16
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,698
These days, there's also social media.

17
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,494
The tourists' social media posts
have made it a popular destination.

18
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,830
Honestly, the island has good scenery.

19
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,708
I agree. We should've come here
on vacation instead.

20
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,670
Those people are here again.

21
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,089
Who are they?

22
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:15,510
MCST will select five islands
to give ten billion won for developments.

23
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,513
It was called the K-Tourism Islands
or something.

24
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,932
Those people are
the selection committee members.

25
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:24,018
The entire island is making a fuss
to win the business rights.

26
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:30,942
What? Captain!

27
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,694
- Captain!
- Captain!

28
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,196
- Captain.
- My goodness.

29
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,990
It's been a while.

30
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,534
I'm sorry for making you travel so far.

31
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,452
It's nice to get fresh air.

32
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,664
Let's go.

33
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,713
LEE SEUNGA DISAPPEARANCE CASE

34
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,381
On the day she went missing,

35
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:56,426
Seunga headed out to attend
a friend's birthday party.

36
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,552
But…

37
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,722
Seunga went to a friend's birthday party?

38
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,558
But she doesn't have any friends.

39
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,393
It can't be a friend from school.

40
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,062
She doesn't talk to
other students at school.

41
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,065
She eats alone too.
I wouldn't call her an outcast,

42
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,818
but students tend to ignore her
since she's difficult.

43
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,239
Do you know if she had friends
outside of school?

44
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,743
I wouldn't know. Come to think of it…

45
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:27,373
<i>I've seen her with a man.</i>

46
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,334
- Really?
- No.

47
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,879
- They seemed pretty close.
- Did you see his face?

48
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,798
No. I saw them from behind.

49
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,217
A man.

50
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,885
On the day she went missing,

51
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,137
Seunga's shoes were discovered
on Bigu Peak Cliff

52
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,805
near the end of the island.

53
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,184
And traces of an accident
were found on the coastal road.

54
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:50,021
Seunga's house, Sunrise Resort,
is located near Namri Beach.

55
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:53,191
I think she got into an accident
on her way back home.

56
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:57,028
If that's true, someone intentionally put
Seunga's shoes at a different location.

57
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:00,573
The culprit probably wanted to
make it look like she jumped off a cliff.

58
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:04,160
Coast guards are searching the sea,
but they haven't found her yet.

59
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,789
They say there's a chance
the current washed her body away.

60
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,415
What about the traces at the scene?

61
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,917
A piece of a silver bumper.

62
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:17,131
- Hello.
- Inspector Cha, what brings you here?

63
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,217
Is it already time
to get your car checked?

64
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,178
I came to ask you something about a case.

65
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,930
Here you go.

66
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,654
This is the car model. Stallone.

67
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,537
A silver Stallone.

68
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,416
Let's find the silver Stallone cars
that passed the coastal road.

69
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:55,128
We checked with the Stallone cars
the out-of-towners brought.

70
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,297
Four out of seven were rentals.

71
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,091
According to the rental services,
none of them were damaged.

72
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:03,720
We checked the other three with the help
of the police, but they were fine.

73
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,931
That means it's one of the islanders.

74
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,934
We checked the islanders' cars too.

75
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:25,408
What are you looking for?
The cars are obviously fine.

76
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,286
I heard it happened at Bigu Peak.

77
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,955
Why are you harassing innocent islanders?

78
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,751
Seriously. I'm sure it was
an out-of-towner.

79
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,128
The islanders are like family.

80
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,881
- Who would cause such an accident?
- I know.

81
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:44,093
Chief. How much longer
will you keep us here?

82
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,555
- We need to get back to work too!
- Okay. For goodness' sake.

83
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,477
Stop it already.
You didn't find anything suspicious.

84
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,442
HWAPYEONG COMMUNITY CENTER

85
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,735
<i>No signs of an accident?</i>

86
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,153
The cars were clean.

87
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,781
We checked all three auto repair shops
on the island.

88
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:09,494
No one came in with a silver Stallone
to have a bumper exchanged or repaired.

89
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,872
Had they exchanged the bumper
or windshield, it would've shown.

90
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,832
But we didn't see any signs.

91
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,211
It was neither an out-of-towner's car
nor an islander's car.

92
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,547
At 11:20 p.m. on the night
Seunga went missing,

93
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,300
a camera caught
a silver Stallone at the entrance

94
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,552
of Buk 2-ri St. near Bigu Peak.

95
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,971
An hour later, it was filmed
as it came back out.

96
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,723
And the license plate number?

97
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,225
No, the image was too blurry.

98
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,144
But take a look at the right headlight.

99
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,104
It's broken.

100
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,734
It's the same location
as the bumper fragment we found.

101
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,493
Since the village is secluded,

102
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,204
they don't have surveillance cameras
for security.

103
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,415
The existing ones are all broken.

104
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:59,794
All the villagers are senior citizens,
so they have no intention of fixing it.

105
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,047
Hold on.

106
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,303
Over there.

107
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,930
And there.

108
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,059
They set up cameras
at farm tracks and greenhouses.

109
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,770
Why would they have one at farm tracks?

110
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,813
Crop theft.

111
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,862
Islands like this
should get surveillance cameras too.

112
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,698
There's nothing we can work with
for an investigation.

113
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,534
Had this happened in Seoul,
it would've closed in half a day.

114
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,080
The thing is,
this is a very peaceful island.

115
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,416
They say your name determines your fate.

116
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:42,253
It became peaceful after they changed
the name to Hwapyeong Island.

117
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,464
- What was the previous name?
- Sujeong Island.

118
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:49,218
- It's a pretty name. Why was it changed?
- Well, according to the seniors,

119
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,513
there were many ship accidents here
due to the weather.

120
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:56,517
In any case, there hasn't been
a single theft case,

121
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,437
let alone a murder case so far.

122
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:04,942
I also think that Seunga
may have taken her own life.

123
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,990
What? It seems like
Captain found something.

124
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,870
What?

125
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,414
No way.

126
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,250
With that angle,
it would've filmed the entire village.

127
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,502
If only it is working.

128
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,420
Hold on.

129
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,007
Excuse me, sir. Hello.

130
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,426
Do you know who owns this warehouse?

131
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,387
Thank you.

132
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,807
Ever since out-of-towners
began entering the island,

133
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,228
I found people going into the grape field.

134
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:44,774
I haven't checked it once
after installing it.

135
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,528
They told me to press the button,
but I didn't know which one.

136
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,530
Hold on. Over here.

137
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,826
I can't make out the place
since it's too dark.

138
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,496
Are you done?

139
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,331
- Give me a second.
- Okay.

140
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,835
- I'll send it now.
- Okay.

141
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,464
I got it.

142
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,971
I think I have a better idea now.

143
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,559
Let's reenact what happened
and figure out where this car went.

144
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,561
Okay.

145
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,069
Donggi, can you hear me?

146
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,280
Yes, I can.

147
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,533
- Okay. Set off slowly.
- Okay.

148
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,076
- Let's go.
- All right.

149
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,669
Too fast.

150
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,045
It was too fast. Go slowly.

151
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,672
Okay. Let's go slowly.

152
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,048
Slowly.

153
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,558
- Turn left.
- Turn left.

154
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,268
Turning left. Can you make a left?

155
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,520
- Yes. It must be this path.
- Yes.

156
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,107
<i>Go straight.</i>

157
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,484
Okay. Going straight.

158
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,745
- Turn right.
- Turn right.

159
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,288
<i>Can you turn right?</i>

160
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,749
Yes, we can turn right.

161
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,295
- I can see them.
- Yes.

162
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,759
Continue down that road slowly.

163
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,427
<i>Okay.</i>

164
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,346
Follow the road up the hill.

165
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,391
Follow the road straight up the hill.

166
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,726
Okay.

167
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,062
- Let's go up.
- Okay.

168
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,988
- Stop.
- Stop.

169
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,365
Stop.

170
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,451
<i>Donggi, what is that place?</i>
<i>Can you see anything? Where are you?</i>

171
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,830
<i>Lieutenant,</i>
<i>I think we've come to the right place.</i>

172
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,383
It says mountain cars can't enter.

173
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,470
All right.

174
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:29,605
Although it may look like a low mountain,
it's connected all the way to the dock.

175
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:33,442
It'll take a battalion at the very least
to search the mountain.

176
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,444
Do you know who owns it?

177
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,155
It should be a mountain
for the Gi family's gravesites.

178
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:43,119
Among the drivers
whose cars passed the coastal road,

179
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,870
there was a man whose surname was Gi.

180
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:48,290
You must be talking about Gi Hyungsoo.

181
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,209
He works at the oyster farm.

182
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,050
All right. Okay.

183
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,390
I checked with the dock.

184
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:07,143
Gi Hyungsoo's car never left the island

185
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,729
before or after the girl's disappearance.

186
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,857
- You checked their cars too.
- Right.

187
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,651
- The windshields and bumpers were clean.
- Yes.

188
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,279
Gi Hyungsoo has an alibi too.

189
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,781
- Have a safe drive.
- Please go back inside.

190
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,200
- Thank you.
- Take care.

191
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,453
- We'll get going.
- All right.

192
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,121
- Have a safe trip.
- Okay.

193
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,831
- We're in your care.
- Goodbye.

194
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,833
We're in your care!

195
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,675
You all did so well today!

196
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:44,764
Wait. How will you all go home?

197
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,975
My place is nearby, so it's fine.
I'll get going then.

198
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,643
<i>On the night Seunga disappeared,</i>

199
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,605
<i>there was a gathering
at a sashimi place near the dock.</i>

200
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,482
<i>He left the restaurant around 10 p.m.</i>

201
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,651
<i>with Village Chief Shin Kyungja,
Kang Sanghoon, and Im Jisook.</i>

202
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,154
<i>He drove back to his place at Nam 2-ri St.</i>

203
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,530
Get going.

204
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,991
Hey. You didn't drink, right?

205
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,997
There was a gathering,
but he didn't have a drop of alcohol.

206
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,835
Since this is an island,

207
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,630
we lack manpower.

208
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,841
It's impossible to set up DUI checkpoints.

209
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,178
He could've had a drink or two.

210
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,597
The accident occurred here.

211
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,559
Had it happened on his way home,
the three passengers would've known.

212
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,646
That's one thing,
but his car is also undamaged.

213
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,233
We need to verify Gi Hyungsoo's alibi.

214
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,860
Let's start with the president
of the women's society.

215
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,613
Mr. Shin, will you give them a ride?

216
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:43,739
Sure.

217
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,199
Where will you go?

218
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,326
I'll visit Gi Hyungsoo.

219
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,036
- I'll go with you.
- No.

220
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:52,164
I want to ask you for a favor.

221
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,920
<i>Would you please check in
on Seunga's father?</i>

222
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,635
Gosh, why are you outside?

223
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,601
Did you find Seunga?

224
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,147
Well, we haven't found her yet.

225
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,988
Could it be that she's still alive?

226
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,115
I feel like

227
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:30,452
Seunga left the island to see her mom.

228
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:35,541
We're considering all possibilities
while searching for her.

229
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,085
It must be difficult,
but please wait a bit longer.

230
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:41,338
We'll do our best
so that Seunga returns home safely.

231
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,258
- Okay. I understand.
- Yes.

232
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,176
In that case…

233
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,723
…please find Seunga.

234
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,600
Okay, sir.

235
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,065
He was waiting outside
in this cold weather.

236
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,235
That's how you feel
when you wait for someone.

237
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:10,075
For goodness' sake.
Why would I lie about this?

238
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,661
Mr. Gi drove me home.

239
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,622
And you didn't see Seunga
on your way home?

240
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,166
I didn't see her, okay?

241
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,669
I was drunk, so I was already home
when I opened my eyes.

242
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,795
What?

243
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,341
I already told you everything.
Hyungsoo drove me home.

244
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,843
Did anything happen on your way home?

245
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,512
That's enough.

246
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,558
- Pardon?
- She committed suicide.

247
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,645
Why do you keep suspecting the villagers?

248
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,397
We've lived in peace
without a single problem so far.

249
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,484
- Gosh, Village Chief. Why--
- Be quiet!

250
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,906
I knew that family was trouble
when he refused to pay for developments.

251
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,783
He had no intention to work with us.

252
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,452
He was just focusing on
making money off our island.

253
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,455
It's no wonder his wife ran away.

254
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,148
What are you doing?

255
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,197
I asked what you were doing
in front of my car.

256
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,575
- I came to ask you something.
- What?

257
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,454
When you returned home
after dropping people off that day,

258
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,331
did you stay home?

259
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,834
Why do you ask?

260
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,962
Didn't you drive someplace else?

261
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,171
Like where?

262
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,507
Bigu Peak?

263
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,472
It was too late to go anywhere.

264
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,392
I slept at home.

265
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,813
If you don't believe me,

266
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,482
go ask the islanders.

267
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,700
At this time--

268
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,119
That car wasn't Gi Hyungsoo's.

269
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,121
- What?
- Huh? What do you mean?

270
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,749
Detective Woo, please check
Gi Hyungsoo's VIN.

271
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:22,791
Okay.

272
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,252
VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER

273
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,630
It seemed strange.

274
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,009
<i>If Seunga got into an accident,
it had to be Gi Hyungsoo's car.</i>

275
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,635
<i>Why were there no traces?</i>

276
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,262
<i>Could it be</i>

277
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,431
<i>a twin car?</i>

278
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,768
I have Mr. Gi Hyungsoo's VIN.

279
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,273
VEHICLE INFORMATION

280
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,108
The VIN is different.

281
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,987
He switched the cars.
It's a new car with the old license plate.

282
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,324
To hide his vehicle,
he bought a used car of the same model

283
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,702
and switched the license plates
so it'd look like nothing happened.

284
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,705
- Then the car from the accident…
- He must've hidden it

285
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,290
or discarded it in the sea.

286
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,879
- I think there's an accomplice.
- Who could it be?

287
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:12,049
What's certain is that
Gi Hyungsoo didn't buy the twin car.

288
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,511
There's only one vehicle registration
under his name.

289
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,639
The one who bought the car
is the accomplice.

290
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,391
Let's find the accomplice.

291
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,228
The twin car must've come
right after the accident.

292
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,564
When we checked for silver Stallone cars,
they were already switched.

293
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,942
So it must've entered the island
around that time.

294
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:33,946
Donggi and Hyunkyung,
check if the same car entered the island.

295
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,155
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

296
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,199
Perhaps he still has the damaged car.

297
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,577
Inspector Cha and I will see
if he hid the car somewhere.

298
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,374
- The most likely location would be--
- Gi Hyungsoo's mountain.

299
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,346
It sure is an appropriate place
to hide something.

300
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,515
It's a secluded private property.

301
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,184
If he hid the car somewhere, it'd be here.

302
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,644
Yes.

303
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,022
Who could be the man Seunga was close to?

304
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,899
It can't be Gi Hyungsoo, right?

305
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:15,571
I'm not sure. Though I was close
to Seunga, I don't know much about her.

306
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,574
But every time I saw her,

307
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,619
<i>she was always alone.</i>

308
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,915
<i>She always had earbuds in her ears.</i>

309
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,753
She must've been lonely.

310
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,006
She was at the age
to hang out with friends.

311
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,468
Hold on, Inspector Cha.

312
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,389
Is this Seunga's earbud?

313
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,773
Yes, it's the same model
as Seunga's earbuds.

314
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,484
I remember it clearly since I bought them.

315
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,946
Did Seunga take them with her
on the day she went missing?

316
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,991
Probably. She always listened to music.

317
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,831
There are no earbuds in her room.
She must've taken them with her.

318
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,125
Then this could really be hers.

319
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,130
Yes, Hyunkyung.

320
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,966
You found it?

321
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,804
Here.

322
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,099
A silver Stallone entered the island
the day after Seunga went missing.

323
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:29,228
- It's the same model as Gi Hyungsoo's car.
- Did you check the VIN?

324
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,271
It's under Im Jisook's name.

325
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:34,191
How's the president of the women's society
related to Gi Hyungsoo?

326
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,734
They're cousins.

327
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,111
What about it?

328
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,864
I'm sure Ms. Im just got a new car.

329
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,575
That's entirely possible, but look here.

330
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,664
The bumper…

331
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,333
Her new car was destroyed
in a matter of days.

332
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,127
- When was this?
- Early this morning.

333
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:07,849
Ms. Im Jisook.

334
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,397
- You'll have to come with us.
- What?

335
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,524
It won't take long.

336
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,984
What's going on?

337
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,319
What's happening? My goodness.

338
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,738
Why are you doing this?

339
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,704
The car you took
out of the island this morning.

340
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,997
Where is it now?

341
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,916
What? Why do you ask about that car?

342
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,338
That car had a broken bumper.

343
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,427
Oh, that?

344
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:47,472
My goodness, I got into an accident
as soon as I bought the car.

345
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,392
It seemed like a bad omen
so I went to see a fortuneteller.

346
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,893
My goodness.

347
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,022
She said that I'd die early
if I continued to drive that car.

348
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,940
- Then what?
- Must you ask?

349
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,276
I had it scrapped.

350
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,069
Just because of a broken bumper?

351
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,865
Goodness, I couldn't sell
such an unlucky item to someone else.

352
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,117
I'm not that kind of a person.

353
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:14,041
This is your vehicle registration,
Ms. Im Jisook.

354
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,295
And this is Mr. Gi Hyungsoo's.

355
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,507
The two shared the same VIN.

356
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,552
Do you know what that means?

357
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,389
- I don't know.
- The two of you have the same car.

358
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,392
- What?
- The car you scrapped

359
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,770
belonged to Gi Hyungsoo, right?

360
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,065
After Gi Hyungsoo hit Seunga,
he scrapped his car.

361
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:42,527
Then you bought the same model
and switched it with his car, didn't you?

362
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,613
My goodness.

363
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,617
I have no idea what you're talking about.

364
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,952
Feigning ignorance won't get you anywhere.

365
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,872
I really don't know anything.

366
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,130
What on earth are you doing?

367
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,176
I told you, didn't I?

368
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,304
Don't cause trouble
over a girl who killed herself.

369
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,639
How dare you cause a ruckus

370
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,474
- at such a crucial moment?
- A ruckus?

371
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,102
It might be a murder case.

372
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,728
Murder, my foot.

373
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,815
- That will never happen on this island!
- You want to believe that.

374
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,276
You don't want to suspect
those you've known all your life.

375
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,445
But that's what the evidence suggests.

376
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,739
Otherwise, why would
the two cars be switched?

377
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,201
Hyungsoo, explain it yourself.

378
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,203
Okay, Director.

379
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,666
Well…

380
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,001
My goodness.

381
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,173
I switched the cars
without telling Jisook.

382
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,177
- What did you say?
- Listen.

383
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:53,432
Jisook said she got a new car,
but it was the same model as mine.

384
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,309
I switched the license plates
and car keys as a prank.

385
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,270
- But she didn't even realize it.
- What?

386
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:01,982
I was going to switch them back
after the prank ran its course.

387
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,818
Who knew that there'd be an accident?

388
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,320
- Do you expect us to believe that?
- I'm a witness.

389
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,783
I was with him when he switched the cars.

390
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,579
But that was after the girl went missing.

391
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,622
It has nothing to do with her.

392
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,584
Do you even know what you're all doing?

393
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:24,963
This is concealment of a crime.
It makes all of you accomplices.

394
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,174
Accomplices, my foot.

395
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,426
You're the one who's cornering
the innocent!

396
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:33,013
Hyungsoo already explained it.

397
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,518
He's the witness!

398
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,187
- Village Chief.
- What?

399
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,947
Chief, what are you doing?

400
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,034
Can't you see the islanders
getting hounded by the out-of-towners?

401
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,285
All right, everyone.

402
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,370
There must be a misunderstanding.

403
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,705
Let's call it a day.

404
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,166
Go back home now. Go.

405
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:04,377
- Go!
- For goodness' sake!

406
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,921
Chief, take responsibility!

407
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,005
Come on.

408
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,090
For goodness' sake!

409
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,010
- Chief, take responsibility!
- Get going!

410
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:16,348
I can't believe this!
Who are you branding as a criminal!

411
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,475
Don't be angry. It's standard procedure.

412
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,269
Let go! Are you siding with them
since you're an officer too?

413
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,272
Come on. Don't be like that to Mr. Shin.

414
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,234
We'd better not lose
ten billion won over this.

415
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,527
I won't stand still!

416
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,196
For goodness' sake. We got it, okay?

417
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,325
Im Jisook might not be
the only accomplice.

418
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,787
It's no wonder his wife ran away.

419
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,590
The accomplices might be everyone

420
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,760
involved in Gi Hyungsoo's alibi
on the day of the accident.

421
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,596
What should we do? The car was scrapped.

422
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,559
If they are all in collusion,
circumstantial evidence won't be enough.

423
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,935
How will we investigate?

424
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,271
Only one solution remains.
We must find Seunga.

425
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,357
I picked this up at the mountain.

426
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,194
Forensics will confirm it,
but we think it belongs to Seunga.

427
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,863
Shouldn't we search the mountain?

428
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,156
To search the mountain,

429
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,617
we'll need help from coast guards
and the military.

430
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:21,329
The community members
and islanders will be against it.

431
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,749
The islanders are sensitive
about the island's image.

432
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,295
If we fail to find something,

433
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,463
they'll resist even more.

434
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,509
Is there another way?
We must search the mountain.

435
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,850
Instead of making a move,

436
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,352
let's have them make a move first.

437
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:55,447
We apologize for causing inconvenience
during our search for Lee Seunga.

438
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,367
Thanks to all your help,
the investigation will be closed soon.

439
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,995
What? How will it be closed?

440
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,955
Has her body been found?

441
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,208
Yes. We'll find it soon.

442
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:14,507
What do you mean "soon"?
Did you find her body or not?

443
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,638
This is a wireless earbud.

444
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,432
It was something Seunga
always carried with her.

445
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:25,226
We recently caught signals
from the other earbud.

446
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,687
Tomorrow, an expert from Seoul
will come here.

447
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,815
Then we'll be able to figure out
the exact location.

448
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,903
If she jumped into the sea,
her body must be miles away.

449
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,988
- How will you find her body?
- Right.

450
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,450
Can't you tell us?
I'm sure there's a way, right?

451
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,701
Right.

452
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,248
Thank you for your cooperation.

453
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,792
You can go home now.

454
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,217
Aren't those earbuds very common?

455
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,094
The other one is sending out a signal.

456
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,722
All the kids use such earbuds.

457
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:13,858
Inspector Cha, doesn't this scenery
feel familiar?

458
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:18,071
During the Kanghee Junction case,

459
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,699
- a ghost at the mountain…
- Right.

460
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:25,537
Back then, you almost passed out
because I startled you.

461
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,039
I did?

462
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,710
"I did?" A witness is right here.

463
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,211
You fell to the ground.

464
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,587
I never did that.

465
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,638
Stop it. Why are you joking around?

466
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,890
- Gosh!
- My goodness. What?

467
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,810
I didn't know there were
camellia trees here.

468
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,772
Inspector Cha, you've changed.

469
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,901
- There.
- Stop it.

470
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,737
- No, I'm serious.
- Stop joking around.

471
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,324
You know where you're going?

472
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,078
- Over there.
- What?

473
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,914
I knew it'd be the four of them.

474
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,332
Where is it?

475
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,792
- Here.
- What?

476
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,794
No need to wait. Shall we get them?

477
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,421
- Wait.
- That isn't the place.

478
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,714
- What?
- What?

479
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,300
All right.

480
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,218
It's about here.

481
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,723
I'm not drunk. Ride my car.

482
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,476
You're moving like a butterfly.
You're swaying.

483
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,727
Don't be ridiculous.

484
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:34,189
Hurry up and get going. Go on now.

485
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,608
Hey. You didn't drink, right?

486
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,444
I drank.

487
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,490
I was talking to him, not you.

488
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,909
You didn't drink much, right?

489
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,661
- A little bit.
- A little bit?

490
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,914
Then you should drive.

491
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,624
You should drive.

492
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:56,711
Let's go. We'll get ten billion won.

493
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,756
Is it a coincidence
that Im Jisook scrapped the car today?

494
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,218
Do you think there's an accomplice
among the police?

495
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,762
It's suspicious.

496
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:08,807
It was right after Inspector Cha
found out about the twin car.

497
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,769
We can't jump to conclusions,
but we should be careful.

498
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,646
- Shine the flashlight here.
- Okay.

499
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,481
Captain's hunch was correct.

500
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,609
Inspector Cha, are you okay?

501
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,236
- Where? Here?
- Yes.

502
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,071
Start digging.

503
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,447
Goodness gracious.

504
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:31,246
How will they locate the buried body?

505
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,082
- Well, by using the Internet…
- Yeah?

506
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,793
There's a method.

507
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,586
Geez, this is ridiculous.

508
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,966
- I said we should throw it in the sea.
- For goodness' sake!

509
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,469
Shine the flashlight properly.
I can't see anything.

510
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,720
Okay.

511
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,390
What?

512
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:52,767
I found it.

513
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,021
All right. Here.

514
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,149
- Don't shine the flashlight on my face.
- It isn't me.

515
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,569
Goodness, so many of you are here.

516
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,629
- Is it just the two of you?
- Why? Do you want to bury us too?

517
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:28,052
Burying a few more people
won't be so hard.

518
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:35,768
- My goodness. Donggi, it's this way.
- Okay.

519
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,906
I didn't do anything wrong.
I only helped because they asked.

520
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:51,284
- Don't touch me. I'm a victim!
- Give me your hands.

521
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,119
I'm a victim too.

522
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,580
- You don't want to get hurt.
- I'll handcuff you.

523
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:57,916
You admit to your crimes, right?

524
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,500
- Let go.
- Give me your hands.

525
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,920
- Give me your hands.
- It'll hurt if you pull.

526
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,755
- All right.
- Let's go.

527
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,757
- No, but…
- Gosh. Stay there.

528
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,051
Give me your hands.

529
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,387
All right. Give me your hands.

530
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,571
This is a wireless earbud.

531
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,949
It was something Seunga
always carried with her.

532
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,576
We recently caught signals
from the other earbud.

533
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,080
Tomorrow, an expert from Seoul
will come here.

534
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:40,583
Then we'll be able to figure out
the exact location.

535
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:44,921
RESTRICTED AREA

536
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,200
SOCIAL WELFARE FACILITY
SUJEONG CENTER

537
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,267
You must be Seunga.

538
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,601
Who are you?

539
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,772
I'm a police officer.
Let's go. Your father is waiting.

540
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,077
<i>It was you.</i>

541
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,955
<i>The friend who saved Seunga.</i>

542
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,889
Seunga!

543
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,433
Dad. Dad!

544
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,643
Seunga!

545
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,944
Seunga.

546
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,405
You brat.

547
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,870
Seunga.

548
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,418
<i>Armin was a friend I made here.</i>

549
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,461
THE DAY OF DISAPPEARANCE

550
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,973
<i>That day, it was Armin's birthday.</i>

551
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,391
Happy birthday, Armin.

552
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,644
You're a good friend, Seunga.

553
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,270
Thank you, Seunga.

554
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,735
It's your birthday.
Don't you miss your mom?

555
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,279
I miss my mom.

556
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,241
I miss my mom too.

557
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,458
I don't feel lonely.

558
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:29,919
Thanks to you.

559
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,171
Thank you, Seunga.

560
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,049
Call me when you feel lonely.

561
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,301
No matter what. Promise?

562
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,929
A nice song plays

563
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:43,474
whenever I call you.

564
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,186
It makes me feel better.

565
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,730
That song?

566
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,816
- Do you want to listen to it?
- Yes.

567
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,898
What was that?

568
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,107
What's this?

569
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,526
What? Go and check.

570
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,570
- My goodness!
- What?

571
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,363
- My goodness.
- Who's that?

572
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,287
What happened?

573
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,497
- Didn't you see him?
- What?

574
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,877
What? I know him.

575
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,129
He works on Mr. Park's fishing boat.

576
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:56,923
Is he alive or dead?

577
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,976
He's dead.

578
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,939
Over there.

579
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:16,150
I see another one over there. There!

580
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,783
Is she alive?

581
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,290
Help…

582
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,961
- She's alive! Call for help!
- Unbelievable!

583
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,129
Who will you call?

584
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,924
A police officer caused the accident.

585
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,764
But this--

586
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,934
This isn't entirely my fault.

587
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,478
Don't you remember who made me drive?

588
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,689
It was because of you, Aunt!

589
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,148
What should we do, Director?

590
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,776
Why did this happen
when we had important guests over?

591
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,319
It's a matter of ten billion won!

592
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,740
Let's bury them.

593
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,036
Don't you know what happens
if a police officer kills someone

594
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,746
in a drunk-driving accident?

595
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,416
Yes. That's a good idea.

596
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,295
We can't lose ten billion won.

597
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,172
If word gets out
about a death on the island,

598
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,340
who'll visit?

599
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,678
The decision is up to you.

600
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:51,579
No one saw it, right?

601
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,016
- Gosh.
- Be quiet.

602
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,185
Be quiet.

603
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:21,650
Let's bury the dead one
and look after the one that's still alive.

604
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,319
We need to get ten billion won!

605
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,738
- My goodness.
- Be quiet.

606
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,202
- Gosh.
- Be quiet.

607
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,247
- Goodness.
- I said be quiet.

608
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,303
This place used to be called
Sujeong Island.

609
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,847
Sujeong Center was
a facility for homeless children.

610
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,893
They were kidnapped for reformation
and suffered confinement and assault.

611
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,313
The group even buried bodies in secret.

612
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:05,361
Who knew that the heads of the group
remained and took over the island?

613
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:09,990
The thing is,
this is a very peaceful island.

614
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,867
They say your name determines your fate.

615
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:15,871
It became peaceful after they changed
the name to Hwapyeong Island.

616
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,498
What was the previous name?

617
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,916
Sujeong Island.

618
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,793
<i>From Sujeong Island to Hwapyeong Island.</i>

619
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:23,129
Hyungsoo, explain it yourself.

620
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,171
Okay, Director.

621
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,299
Only the titles changed
from "Director" to "Village Chief".

622
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,093
Everything else stayed the same.

623
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:39,645
We would have lived peacefully
if it weren't for them!

624
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,064
Do you still not get it?

625
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,610
You are the ones
who disturbed peace on this island,

626
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,279
both 20 years ago and now.

627
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:03,127
LEE SEUNGA, AGE 17
ARMIN, AGE 21 DECEASED

628
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:15,389
How did such a tragic event occur
on this beautiful island?

629
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,349
I know, right?

630
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,478
Even at a place like this,
cases come endlessly.

631
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,646
It really is tragic.

632
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,857
I wouldn't have been able
to solve it alone.

633
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,318
Thank you, everyone.

634
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,905
There wasn't a single case
we failed to solve together.

635
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,742
That's the very reason
why TCI must continue on.

636
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:38,037
Captain, if you return as the head of TCI,

637
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,872
will you call us back?

638
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,916
I forgot to tell you guys.

639
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,295
I turned in my resignation letter
before coming here.

640
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,713
- What?
- What?

641
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,007
- A resignation letter?
- Why so suddenly?

642
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,843
It wasn't sudden.
I've thought about it for a while.

643
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,386
I've done enough.

644
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,435
"Separation is inevitable,
but they will return."

645
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,522
I hope you won't be disappointed.

646
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,859
Thank you for everything.

647
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,548
CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT

648
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,675
<i>Seoul Metropolitan Police</i>

649
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:35,177
<i>has promoted Lieutenant Min Sohee
and three teammates</i>

650
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,846
<i>of the former TCI team
of Namgang Police Station</i>

651
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:42,142
<i>for solving the case of a missing girl
at Hwapyeong Island during their vacation.</i>

652
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:47,439
I'll take the photo. One, two, three.

653
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,986
One, two, three.

654
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:55,531
One more time. One, two, three.

655
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:58,909
Please stand next to them.

656
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,084
- Please look forward.
- Okay.

657
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:10,212
I'll take the photo. One, two, three.

658
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,259
Wow! You guys are incredible.

659
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:18,721
You guys persevere
no matter the circumstance, like weeds.

660
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:22,975
How did you catch a murderer
on your vacation?

661
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:26,395
What's your secret? I really want to know.

662
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:30,649
Traffic Division solves all the cases,
so Criminal Division is idle.

663
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,401
Let us catch criminals too.

664
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:33,444
Congratulations.

665
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,653
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

666
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,780
Chief.

667
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:40,159
It's a joyous day.
Shouldn't we go out and have dinner?

668
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,580
What? Does Lee Taeju want to
have a meal with you again?

669
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,916
Don't be ridiculous. It was just one time.

670
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,838
If it isn't Lee Taeju, who is it?

671
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,759
Gosh, it isn't like that.

672
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:59,470
I have my eyes on you. Get it together.

673
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,975
It's a good day.

674
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:08,687
Why don't we go out
and eat something fancy?

675
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,190
I'll spend up to one million won.

676
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,817
It's been a while since you were in Seoul.

677
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:17,321
Inspector Cha, you should decide
what you want to eat.

678
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,323
I'm sorry. I have a prior engagement.

679
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:26,914
A prior engagement. Okay.

680
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,959
That's important.
It came first, after all.

681
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:34,463
A prior engagement takes precedence.
That's important.

682
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,760
Well, that's too bad.

683
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:43,597
Why don't we lift our spirits ourselves?

684
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,684
Choose from mushroom chicken soup,
tuna sashimi, and beef.

685
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:50,270
I'm sorry, Chief.
We have a prior engagement too.

686
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,074
All right.

687
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,119
You guys are just mean. Goodness.

688
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,667
YESEUNG PORK BULGOGI

689
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,794
- Captain.
- You're here.

690
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:14,920
Yes.

691
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,047
Hello.

692
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,758
My goodness. Here.

693
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,386
All right.

694
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:28,642
I can't believe we're here
on the day of our promotion.

695
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,103
Inspector Cha wanted to eat here.

696
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:36,442
Inspector Cha, are you in a hurry?

697
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,277
Eat slowly.

698
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,280
It's been a while.

699
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:44,074
I missed this place
when I lived on the island.

700
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:48,454
Everyone, congratulations
on your promotion.

701
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:53,792
Although you contributed,
we got promoted without you.

702
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,127
I'm sorry.

703
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:57,504
No, don't be sorry. This is my choice.

704
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:02,217
Why don't we eat here from time to time?

705
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,137
Even if we aren't on the same team,

706
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,431
we could still eat together.

707
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,101
- I'm in.
- Same here.

708
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,770
Captain, hurry up and say yes.

709
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,481
You're the one
who crushed the revival of TCI.

710
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,316
- Okay. I'm for that idea.
- Okay.

711
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,319
Inspector Cha, I know you're in.

712
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,653
- Are you in?
- Yes.

713
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:45,761
You look happy.

714
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,979
I thought you were going to take a break.

715
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,190
Is your idea of a break
working on the road?

716
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:02,569
You have a point. Perhaps it's my fate.

717
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,280
I heard the news. Congratulations.

718
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:08,659
Next month, you'll be Director
of the National Office of Investigation.

719
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:14,832
I'm the one who wants to take a break,
but they keep giving me work.

720
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,962
Do you know what I want to do first

721
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,047
as Director of the National Office
of Investigation?

722
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,431
POLICE PERSONNEL RECORDS

723
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,519
The first person who suggested
the Traffic Crime Investigation team

724
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,688
was you.

725
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,774
Was there a special reason?

726
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:49,199
During my 30 years as a police officer,

727
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:52,077
there was a case I had buried in my heart.

728
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,624
A hit-and-run case that killed my wife.

729
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:03,046
I was inattentive to my family
with the excuse of being busy.

730
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:07,217
My wife visited the police station
day and night to look after me.

731
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:10,971
That day, she was bringing
a change of clothes to the station

732
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,973
when the accident occurred.

733
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,562
I investigated the case for a year.

734
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:21,023
In the end, I couldn't catch the culprit.

735
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,818
Perhaps the culprit is still driving

736
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,070
somewhere in Korea.

737
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,783
Perhaps the culprit caused
another accident.

738
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:36,705
Every year, close to 3,000 people
die on the road.

739
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:39,750
The number of deaths
from the five most common crimes combined

740
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,501
is far less than that.

741
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,588
People don't think

742
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,591
that a murder on the road is a murder.

743
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:50,761
"I didn't know. It was a mistake.

744
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,639
It wasn't intentional."

745
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,351
To them, a murder on the road

746
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,603
is simply an accident.

747
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,652
Every single day,

748
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,905
I see my wife on the road.

749
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,535
I see her crossing the street
at the green light.

750
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:20,165
I see her sitting behind the wheel
and changing lanes.

751
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:24,628
I see her riding a bicycle
on the shoulder of the road.

752
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,550
I hope there won't be an accident.

753
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,260
I hope there won't be any deaths.

754
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:37,015
I'm sorry.

755
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:41,853
That would be my reason.

756
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,279
Captain Jung Chaeman.

757
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:53,824
Let's do that together.

758
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:07,087
That's good. You're doing well.

759
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,797
Walk slowly.

760
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,174
Let's walk a bit more.

761
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,510
Walk slowly.

762
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:16,346
- That's good.
- That's good.

763
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,181
A bit more.

764
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:21,601
Dad, you've improved so much. Seriously.

765
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,104
- You're doing well. Right?
- He's doing very well.

766
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,357
- He improved a lot.
- Right?

767
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:29,693
- This is nothing.
- Good.

768
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,238
- I wonder…
- Yes?

769
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,240
…if I'll be able to drive again.

770
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,283
Why not?

771
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,368
Just because. I lack confidence.

772
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,328
I'm scared to.

773
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,418
Don't drive if you don't want to.
You've driven enough.

774
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,046
But you know,

775
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:53,091
I think you look the coolest
when you are driving.

776
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:57,095
When you turn the wheel,
your forearm muscles split.

777
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,765
When you back up the car,
you put your hand on the seat.

778
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:02,142
Not just anyone can do that.

779
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,351
Not just anyone.

780
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:06,730
When it comes to backing up the car,
you must be in the top three in Korea.

781
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:09,399
I sure am good at backing up the car.

782
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,736
My nickname used to be Min Back.

783
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:13,987
I know that.

784
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,323
Most of the time,
I don't even need to look.

785
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,784
That's right. How do you do that?

786
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,452
How do you do that?

787
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,623
NATIONAL OFFICE OF INVESTIGATION
TCI TEAM

788
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:28,251
This isn't a dream, is it?
We're really back, right?

789
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,377
It's more than that.

790
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:32,339
We're now under
the National Office of Investigation.

791
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,465
It's an upgrade!

792
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:35,383
National Office of Investigation, TCI.

793
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:37,761
It's seriously so cool.

794
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:42,140
Has the office been upgraded too?

795
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:45,102
- Has it?
- Has the office been upgraded too?

796
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:48,188
Gosh, it's snowing. Let's go inside.

797
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,024
- Let's go inside.
- All right.

798
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,532
An upgrade--

799
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:01,368
Why is our office the same?

800
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,454
If we're under
the National Office of Investigation,

801
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,332
- shouldn't our office get an upgrade?
- Exactly.

802
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,918
It really isn't easy to escape this place!

803
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:12,212
There's no space
at the Seoul Metropolitan Police.

804
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,297
They'll look into it, so let's wait.

805
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:18,468
It feels new and old.

806
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,011
I like it and hate it.

807
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,429
What's this emotion?

808
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:23,682
Being let down?

809
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,560
We should use our old desks then.

810
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:30,063
Why isn't Inspector Cha here yet?

811
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,276
I'm getting a call from Inspector Cha.

812
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,487
Why aren't you here?

813
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,489
Are you chasing a culprit or…

814
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:41,908
What?

815
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,743
I'm on my way.

816
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,163
I'm chasing an reckless driver.

817
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,165
<i>It's your first day of work.</i>

818
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,166
Where are you?

819
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,126
He's chasing a reckless driver.

820
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,086
Where?

821
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:55,755
He really is something.

822
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,674
Gosh, we just sat down.

823
00:52:57,757 --> 00:53:00,760
It's our first case, so good--

824
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:02,679
Good luck.

825
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:06,683
Nothing has changed.

826
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:20,780
Inspector Cha.

827
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,825
Isn't this car really cool?

828
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,661
The exterior is so cool

829
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,788
and the interior is so clean.

830
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,624
It's totally my type.

831
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,000
You have good taste.

832
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,586
This is an electric car

833
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:37,797
with the aesthetics
as well as functional efficiency.

834
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:42,302
This model in particular
has eight speakers inside.

835
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,930
So you can enjoy the rich sounds.

836
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:48,475
- How do we apply for a test drive?
- You can apply for it

837
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:49,851
on the official website.

838
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,873
It has a safety function.

839
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,333
How nice.

840
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,378
Why do you want to buy a car?

841
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:20,006
I think I'll need it soon.

842
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,436
Do you want to listen to music?

843
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,857
Will you be okay? You were anxious
about listening to music while driving.

844
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,401
It's okay.

845
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,045
Go on in.

846
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,847
Congratulations on returning to TCI.

847
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:12,142
- What brings you here?
- There has been a case.

848
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:16,271
I'll see you often since you're under
the National Office of Investigation.

849
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,566
Look forward to it.

850
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:22,402
We're members
of the National Office of Investigation,

851
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,362
so we can carry out target investigations.

852
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:29,034
That means we can reopen
cold cases from the past.

853
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,457
My generosity ends here.

854
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,585
I won't go easy on you anymore.

855
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,712
I'll be prepared.

856
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,215
Let's have a proper face-off.

857
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:06,446
THE LATE LEE HYUNSOO

858
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,186
Did you hear about Minsung?

859
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,314
Yes. He received the final ruling.

860
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:45,110
I'm glad his sentence is lighter
than I expected.

861
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:52,325
When I visit him,
he seems like a different person.

862
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:56,996
He exercises diligently
and his thoughts have become clearer.

863
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:00,792
I'm relieved.

864
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,004
Yeonho.

865
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,051
You should live your life too.

866
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:12,804
You should date someone

867
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,598
and go on vacation.

868
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,230
You can laugh out loud.

869
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:25,692
You can do that now.

870
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,285
Let us

871
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:38,371
take one step forward.

872
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,084
From the place where we have stopped,

873
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:47,464
let's take one more step forward.

874
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,192
<i>Inspector Cha.</i>

875
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:10,028
<i>You came to pick me up
for my dad's discharge.</i>

876
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:13,072
<i>Thank you. And you're driving too.</i>

877
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,658
<i>I wanted to pick up your father</i>

878
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,744
<i>with your car.</i>

879
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,875
<i>The road isn't our purpose
but it is progress.</i>

880
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:31,382
<i>The road takes us to special people</i>

881
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:34,719
<i>and also leads us to our destination.</i>

882
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:41,434
<i>But if someone breaks</i>
<i>the promises of the road,</i>

883
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,686
<i>ignores the rules of the road,</i>

884
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,563
<i>and discards the manners of the road,</i>

885
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:49,400
<i>the road can instantly become
an unfortunate place.</i>

886
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,662
<i>Everyone we meet on the road</i>

887
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:04,165
<i>is someone's family member
and a precious person.</i>

888
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,834
<i>Thus, we must all</i>

889
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,836
<i>stay safe.</i>

890
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:18,930
<i>If you're on the road right now,</i>

891
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,268
<i>we hope you'll safely return to those</i>

892
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,770
<i>who are waiting for you.</i>

893
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:32,193
CRASH
