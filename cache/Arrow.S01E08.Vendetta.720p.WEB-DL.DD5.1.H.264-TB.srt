1
00:00:01,111 --> 00:00:03,159
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,401 --> 00:00:07,337
For 5 years I was stranded on
an island with only one goal--

3
00:00:07,437 --> 00:00:09,614
to survive.

4
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:11,114
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,116 --> 00:00:13,650
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:13,652 --> 00:00:15,836
to use the list of names
he left me

7
00:00:15,838 --> 00:00:18,988
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,125
To do this,
I must become someone else.

9
00:00:22,127 --> 00:00:25,962
I must become
something else.

10
00:00:25,964 --> 00:00:27,514
Previously on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:29,666
The company Mrs. Queen
invested in doesn't exist.

12
00:00:29,668 --> 00:00:31,635
Tempest purchased
a warehouse in Starling City.

13
00:00:31,937 --> 00:00:34,738
Oliver, this is
my daughter, Helena.

14
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,789
The Starling City
vigilante comes and goes

15
00:00:36,814 --> 00:00:38,109
as he pleases, doesn't he?

16
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,276
How did you know?

17
00:00:40,278 --> 00:00:42,645
The minute I saw your eyes.

18
00:00:42,647 --> 00:00:43,947
It's your fault
Michael's dead.

19
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:45,314
Not your father
for ordering the hit

20
00:00:45,316 --> 00:00:47,021
or me for carrying it out.

21
00:00:47,025 --> 00:00:48,336
That island changed you
in ways that

22
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:49,987
only someone like me
can understand.

23
00:00:49,988 --> 00:00:53,006
I know it feels like
justice, but it's not.

24
00:00:53,008 --> 00:00:54,491
Revenge is justice.

25
00:00:54,493 --> 00:00:57,326
You feel the same as I do.
I know it.

26
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:31,020
Take your hands off me!

27
00:02:31,022 --> 00:02:32,355
What the hell did you
think you were doing?

28
00:02:32,357 --> 00:02:34,590
That man was the leader
of the Triad.

29
00:02:34,592 --> 00:02:37,444
My father blames them
for the recent hits against his men.

30
00:02:37,446 --> 00:02:38,928
These are men you killed.

31
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,363
That's right.

32
00:02:40,365 --> 00:02:42,899
I take out Zhishan
and the Triad retaliates.

33
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:45,368
I have weakened my father's
organization to the point

34
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,704
where there is no way that
he can survive their onslaught.

35
00:02:47,706 --> 00:02:50,240
What, and then you'll
have your revenge?

36
00:02:50,242 --> 00:02:52,459
Then I have justice,

37
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:55,161
for what he did
to Michael and me.

38
00:02:55,163 --> 00:02:57,113
It's not justice.

39
00:02:57,115 --> 00:02:59,332
And what you do is?

40
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:01,584
Would you let me show you?

41
00:03:07,641 --> 00:03:09,259
Get you anything else?

42
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:11,010
No, thank you, Carly.

43
00:03:11,012 --> 00:03:12,395
Where's my brother-in-law?

44
00:03:12,397 --> 00:03:14,264
It's late and this
is the Glades.

45
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:15,598
Shouldn't he
be keeping you safe?

46
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,967
She is tougher
than she looks.

47
00:03:22,823 --> 00:03:26,142
I haven't been on a second
date in a while.

48
00:03:26,144 --> 00:03:27,994
It feels good so far.

49
00:03:27,996 --> 00:03:31,431
Look, um, we slept together,

50
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:34,000
and it was really nice.

51
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:37,153
And I needed it.
But I'm not looking for anything.

52
00:03:37,155 --> 00:03:39,155
Right. Because you have
everything figured out.

53
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:40,607
I don't think
you're one to judge.

54
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:42,041
I saw you kill people,
remember?

55
00:03:42,043 --> 00:03:43,343
I only kill people

56
00:03:43,345 --> 00:03:45,795
when it is
absolutely necessary.

57
00:03:45,797 --> 00:03:47,096
It's not
my opening move.

58
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:48,431
And the way
that you're going,

59
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:50,099
you're gonna get
somebody hurt,

60
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:51,451
like my mother
or yourself.

61
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:53,169
I'm sorry about your mother.

62
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:54,804
That was an accident.

63
00:03:54,806 --> 00:03:56,439
How many more accidents
have to happen

64
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:59,058
before you're done
getting back at your father?

65
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,144
Hopefully none.

66
00:04:01,146 --> 00:04:03,396
I am not getting back
at him.

67
00:04:03,398 --> 00:04:05,304
I--I am stripping away

68
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:06,784
everything that
has meaning to him,

69
00:04:06,785 --> 00:04:08,851
just like he did to me
when he had Michael killed.

70
00:04:08,853 --> 00:04:10,503
What if I could show you
another way,

71
00:04:10,505 --> 00:04:13,189
a way you could take down
your father's organization

72
00:04:13,191 --> 00:04:16,993
without putting innocent
people at risk?

73
00:04:19,496 --> 00:04:21,831
Thank you

74
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,883
for the coffee...

75
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:25,368
and the sex.

76
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,037
But I'm not interested.

77
00:04:32,676 --> 00:04:35,378
I don't know where
the next Olympics are at,

78
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,681
but you might want
to think about signing yourself up.

79
00:04:38,683 --> 00:04:42,569
So, you want to talk
about last night?

80
00:04:42,571 --> 00:04:46,322
Okay. Last time
you and I spoke,

81
00:04:46,324 --> 00:04:48,474
you were on your way
to stop Helena Bertinelli

82
00:04:48,476 --> 00:04:50,893
from her one-woman war
against the Mafia.

83
00:04:50,895 --> 00:04:52,445
How'd that work out
for you?

84
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:55,198
Nick Salvati,
Frank Bertinelli's right hand,

85
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,899
was found
with his neck snapped

86
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:58,734
along with a few
of his thugs.

87
00:04:58,736 --> 00:05:00,336
Was that her or you?

88
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:02,905
I was with Helena
when somebody jumped us.

89
00:05:02,907 --> 00:05:04,591
We didn't have a choice.

90
00:05:04,593 --> 00:05:05,708
We?

91
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,377
She knows, Diggle,
about me.

92
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:09,078
It was my secret
or her life.

93
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,248
It's not just your secret
anymore, Oliver.

94
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,183
This woman is a killer. She's been
dropping bodies all over the city.

95
00:05:14,185 --> 00:05:16,252
Diggle, she's not
what you think she is.

96
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:18,888
3 years ago she was gonna
turn her father in to the FBI.

97
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,057
She put everything
she had on him on a laptop.

98
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:23,810
Her father found it,
thought it belonged to her fiance,

99
00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:25,612
and had him murdered.

100
00:05:27,781 --> 00:05:30,533
All right, listen,
that's a heavy thing, man.

101
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:33,102
But it doesn't change
the fact that she is dangerous.

102
00:05:33,104 --> 00:05:35,738
And if Bertinelli
retaliates against the Triad

103
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,941
or is perceived to, the Triad
is gonna rain down hell

104
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,943
and innocent people
are gonna be killed.

105
00:05:40,945 --> 00:05:42,912
She's lost, Diggle,

106
00:05:42,914 --> 00:05:46,615
and whether she
knows it or not, I can save her,

107
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:48,801
stop her from
doing anything reckless.

108
00:05:48,803 --> 00:05:50,470
That's just it.
You can't save her, okay?

109
00:05:50,472 --> 00:05:51,804
Some people don't change.

110
00:05:51,806 --> 00:05:53,172
I can.

111
00:05:53,174 --> 00:05:54,507
I can help her.

112
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:56,225
All right.

113
00:05:56,227 --> 00:05:58,761
Maybe you think you're more
persuasive than you are,

114
00:05:58,763 --> 00:06:01,397
or maybe she thinks
she's fine the way she is

115
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,815
on her mission
of righteous fury.

116
00:06:02,817 --> 00:06:04,400
Whatever it is,
either way,

117
00:06:04,402 --> 00:06:07,320
all of this,
it ends badly.

118
00:06:07,322 --> 00:06:09,322
Either way...

119
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:17,163
I got to try.

120
00:06:19,188 --> 00:06:23,188

122
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:31,650
Where are you off to so early?
You just got home.

123
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:33,502
The trouble with traveling
overseas for a few weeks

124
00:06:33,504 --> 00:06:35,487
is that a few weeks' worth
of work is piling up on my desk.

125
00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:37,956
I just want to start digging
my way out from underneath it.

126
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,341
Of course.

127
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:46,215
What is it?

128
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:51,804
We haven't spoken
since you left.

129
00:06:51,806 --> 00:06:54,523
Really spoken.

130
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:55,974
I know.

131
00:06:55,976 --> 00:06:58,777
Well, I can imagine
finding out

132
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:00,512
that I had Robert's
yacht salvaged

133
00:07:00,514 --> 00:07:05,183
and that he was murdered,
it was a lot for you to take in.

134
00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:08,987
Yes, it was.

135
00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:10,569
I just don't want you

136
00:07:10,594 --> 00:07:12,650
to feel that you can't
trust me anymore.

137
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,795
I wasn't lying to--
to hurt you,

138
00:07:16,797 --> 00:07:18,597
but to keep you safe.

139
00:07:19,549 --> 00:07:21,750
I haven't changed,
Walter.

140
00:07:21,752 --> 00:07:26,204
I'm still the woman
you fell in love with and married.

141
00:07:26,206 --> 00:07:28,390
Do you see that?

142
00:07:28,392 --> 00:07:29,842
Yeah.

143
00:07:29,844 --> 00:07:31,343
Of course I do.

144
00:07:33,546 --> 00:07:35,766
I just want us to agree

145
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,766
to be honest with
one another, moving forward.

146
00:07:38,018 --> 00:07:39,735
Okay.
Yes, of course.

147
00:07:39,737 --> 00:07:42,488
Walter.

148
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,223
Will you give me
a lift to school?

149
00:07:45,225 --> 00:07:47,409
I like to mix it up sometimes
and actually be on time.

150
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:51,080
That would be
my parental privilege.

151
00:07:51,082 --> 00:07:53,415
Or, you know, you could just
buy me a convertible

152
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:55,167
and then we could avoid this.

153
00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:57,870
What, and miss out on all
those wonderful conversations

154
00:07:57,872 --> 00:08:01,423
we have in the car?
I don't think so.

155
00:08:03,093 --> 00:08:05,410
I'm so sorry, Frank.
The last thing you need

156
00:08:05,412 --> 00:08:07,412
is me crying on your
shoulder all night.

157
00:08:07,414 --> 00:08:10,415
I just can't believe
that Nick is gone.

158
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:12,718
Dina, look, you and Nicky,

159
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,886
you're like family
to me, okay?

160
00:08:13,888 --> 00:08:15,020
And in my family,

161
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:17,439
we take care
of our own. Okay?

162
00:08:17,441 --> 00:08:19,424
Okay.

163
00:08:19,426 --> 00:08:20,943
I'm sorry for your loss.

164
00:08:20,945 --> 00:08:24,446
Nick was like
a brother to me.

165
00:08:24,448 --> 00:08:27,232
Hey now, come on.

166
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:31,737
We'll talk to you
soon. Okay.

167
00:08:34,574 --> 00:08:38,043
I'm gonna find
the son of a bitch who did this.

168
00:08:38,045 --> 00:08:41,079
And on my life,
I'm gonna make him pay.

169
00:08:45,285 --> 00:08:48,303
You know, that girl's
always forgetting something.

170
00:08:49,973 --> 00:08:51,089
Frank.

171
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:52,090
Oh.

172
00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:53,458
Sorry to drop by unannounced.

173
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,927
No, no, no, come on in.
It's all right.

174
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:56,512
Come on in. Um...

175
00:08:57,814 --> 00:08:59,898
Look, I know, uh,
I know we've been working

176
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,927
on that construction deal,

177
00:09:00,952 --> 00:09:03,131
and I'm sorry for
my dropping the ball.

178
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,803
We've had a death
in the family.

179
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:06,104
I'm terribly sorry
to hear that.

180
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:07,305
Thank you.

181
00:09:07,307 --> 00:09:08,991
Actually, though,
I'm not here

182
00:09:08,993 --> 00:09:10,976
to discuss business.

183
00:09:13,163 --> 00:09:15,647
Oh. Okay.

184
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:17,115
Heh.

185
00:09:17,117 --> 00:09:18,917
Well, this is, uh...

186
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:22,204
this is one merger
I won't stand in the way of.

187
00:09:23,623 --> 00:09:24,823
Excuse me, sweetie.

188
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:26,842
A father knows
when he's not needed.

189
00:09:31,014 --> 00:09:32,681
Was I not clear

190
00:09:32,683 --> 00:09:36,952
that I wasn't interested
in talking?

191
00:09:36,954 --> 00:09:39,304
You don't have to talk.

192
00:09:51,868 --> 00:09:54,686
Who was she?

193
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:58,390
Somebody I knew a long time ago.

194
00:09:58,392 --> 00:10:02,995
I--I was dating
her sister,

195
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:04,630
and it was getting serious.

196
00:10:04,632 --> 00:10:08,050
But back then,
I did not do serious well.

197
00:10:08,052 --> 00:10:11,003
But I was excellent
at screwing things up.

198
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:18,126
I started sleeping
with Sara.

199
00:10:18,128 --> 00:10:22,347
I started sleeping with
my girlfriend's sister.

200
00:10:24,884 --> 00:10:28,604
I brought her on the yacht
and she died.

201
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:33,158
Right in front of me.

202
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,761
And I hurt--
I hurt her family...

203
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:41,383
I just didn't care.

204
00:10:43,453 --> 00:10:45,722
Before the island,
I wasn't a good person.

205
00:10:45,747 --> 00:10:47,447
I was...

206
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,374
Selfish and thoughtless

207
00:10:49,376 --> 00:10:56,465
and awful, and it affected--
really affected people.

208
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:59,768
People I loved.

209
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:03,472
'Cause, Helena...

210
00:11:03,474 --> 00:11:05,807
You're on an island, too.

211
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:09,444
Oliver, I...

212
00:11:09,446 --> 00:11:11,763
I want to let you in.

213
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:17,786
But...Michael was
the last man I opened up to.

214
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:21,439
I can't be hurt again.

215
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:23,575
I'd never hurt you.

216
00:11:25,277 --> 00:11:28,747
I would never hurt you.

217
00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:30,966
I promise.

218
00:11:38,642 --> 00:11:40,610
Uh-uh. Relax.

219
00:11:40,612 --> 00:11:41,977
Relax, relax, relax.

220
00:11:42,665 --> 00:11:45,383
Now, pull back gently.

221
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:47,039
You need all 3 fingers

222
00:11:47,064 --> 00:11:48,521
to come off the bowstring
at the same time.

223
00:11:48,522 --> 00:11:52,807
Relax. Breathe.

224
00:11:54,343 --> 00:11:56,661
And release.

225
00:11:57,981 --> 00:12:00,648
This is a waste of time.

226
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,283
I'm trying
to teach you something.

227
00:12:02,285 --> 00:12:04,235
What, the least effective way
to shoot people?

228
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:05,987
No. Control.

229
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:08,439
To use a bow and arrow

230
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:14,045
requires patience
and discipline.

231
00:12:43,576 --> 00:12:44,892
I can do this all day.

232
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:46,244
It's kind of fun.

233
00:12:46,246 --> 00:12:47,662
I love a man with stamina.

234
00:12:47,664 --> 00:12:51,499
Our crusades have
something in common.

235
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:54,535
Mine started
with my father, too.

236
00:12:54,537 --> 00:12:57,571
He left me with a list.

237
00:12:57,573 --> 00:12:59,540
People who need to be reminded

238
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:01,909
that Starling City isn't
theirs for the taking.

239
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:04,295
Anthony Venza is in here.

240
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:05,930
He works for my dad.

241
00:13:05,932 --> 00:13:08,933
He deals illegal
prescription pills.

242
00:13:10,102 --> 00:13:11,919
Diggle, this is Helena.

243
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:15,139
Diggle's my, uh...

244
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:16,524
Associate.

245
00:13:16,526 --> 00:13:18,943
Well, any associate
of Oliver's is--

246
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:21,579
Absolutely nothing
to you, ma'am.

247
00:13:23,532 --> 00:13:27,285
I'll leave you two
"associates"...

248
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:34,642
She knows my name.

249
00:13:34,644 --> 00:13:36,160
That's lovely.

250
00:13:36,162 --> 00:13:37,795
You can trust her.

251
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:40,548
Except I don't.

252
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,550
You sleeping
with this girl, Oliver?

253
00:13:42,552 --> 00:13:44,135
Well, I don't think that's
any of your business, Diggle.

254
00:13:44,137 --> 00:13:47,171
It became my business when
you brought me into this.

255
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:49,362
And when I signed on,
I told you I was gonna

256
00:13:49,387 --> 00:13:50,309
keep your head straight.

257
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,294
Well, Oliver, you're lonely.
Lonelier than you want to admit.

258
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:54,962
And that's why you think
you can change this girl,

259
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:56,631
because you
need to think you can.

260
00:13:56,633 --> 00:13:58,099
You're like a dope fiend
who thinks

261
00:13:58,101 --> 00:13:59,567
he can deal with
his own addiction

262
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:01,602
by making another addict
go straight.

263
00:14:01,604 --> 00:14:03,588
Oliver, what you do
is dangerous.

264
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,657
And getting confused about
who's good and who's bad

265
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:07,525
is a good way
to get yourself dead.

266
00:14:09,194 --> 00:14:10,778
You done?

267
00:14:12,698 --> 00:14:14,832
Yeah, I'm done.

268
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:16,451
With this.

269
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:19,087
Everything else, I don't know.

270
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:21,789
I don't know, Oliver.
You tell me.

271
00:14:32,352 --> 00:14:34,001
I hope you don't have
plans tomorrow night,

272
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:35,669
because I just got us a rez
at that new restaurant,

273
00:14:35,671 --> 00:14:37,188
Table Salt, opening night.

274
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,474
Isn't that place
ridiculously expensive?

275
00:14:39,476 --> 00:14:41,559
Everywhere worth going is.

276
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:44,345
Ah, you have the cutest crinkle
in your forehead when you're worried.

277
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:46,147
Tommy, stop.
This is serious.

278
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:48,399
I thought you were going
to live more frugally.

279
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:50,985
Yeah, I know. Everybody
is grown up except for me.

280
00:14:50,987 --> 00:14:54,622
Even Oliver has a job.
He's working on that new night club.

281
00:14:54,624 --> 00:14:57,208
You have thinky face.
Why do you have thinky face?

282
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,243
Have you ever thought about
asking Oliver for a job?

283
00:14:59,245 --> 00:15:00,828
Not even once.

284
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,797
This isn't a quality
that I love most about you,

285
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,466
but you do know the club scene
and how to have fun.

286
00:15:05,468 --> 00:15:07,385
You make some
very valid points.

287
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:09,370
Look, I'll take care of it.
I'll talk to Ollie later

288
00:15:09,372 --> 00:15:11,222
and we'll see
what he thinks.

289
00:15:11,224 --> 00:15:14,175
He is gonna think
it is a great idea.

290
00:15:16,211 --> 00:15:17,678
How was your trip
to Australia?

291
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,680
I've always wanted to go.

292
00:15:19,682 --> 00:15:21,215
Down under. It's just--

293
00:15:21,217 --> 00:15:23,067
I have this thing
about kangaroos.

294
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:24,685
More of a phobia.
They wig me out.

295
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:26,654
They look evil, and I'm
sure their picture's up

296
00:15:26,656 --> 00:15:28,322
on like everything
everywhere in that country.

297
00:15:28,324 --> 00:15:30,625
You had something
important to tell me, Ms. Smoak?

298
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:32,393
Yes, I did.

299
00:15:32,395 --> 00:15:36,664
It's about Tempest.
Your wife's mysterious LLC,

300
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,033
the one she diverted
company funds to.

301
00:15:39,035 --> 00:15:41,252
I appreciate your
diligence on this, but, uh,

302
00:15:41,254 --> 00:15:43,538
it was a simple misunderstanding
between my wife and I.

303
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,756
Everything's been resolved.

304
00:15:44,758 --> 00:15:46,240
No. See, it hasn't.

305
00:15:46,242 --> 00:15:48,409
There was something
about the money transfer

306
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:50,795
that felt hinky to me.
The money your wife

307
00:15:50,797 --> 00:15:53,881
withdrew from the company,
I wasn't the only one who tracked it.

308
00:15:53,883 --> 00:15:55,199
She was being shadowed
by another entity,

309
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:56,884
and whoever it is,
they're good.

310
00:15:56,886 --> 00:15:58,219
NSA good.

311
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:00,604
But, as you know,

312
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:01,856
I'm good, too.

313
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:04,191
So even though they
left almost no trace

314
00:16:04,193 --> 00:16:05,893
of their presence
in our system,

315
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:08,028
I did manage
to find one thing.

316
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,581
Well, one image.

317
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,601
Does that symbol mean
something to you, sir?

318
00:16:13,603 --> 00:16:17,588
No.

319
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,956
What means something to me

320
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,925
is one of my employees

321
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:22,960
prying into my wife's
private business

322
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:24,411
without authorization.

323
00:16:24,413 --> 00:16:26,547
And should it happen again,

324
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:28,632
I'll have you suspended.

325
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:29,967
Is that clear?

326
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:32,937
Crystal.

327
00:16:51,456 --> 00:16:52,706
Where's your friend?

328
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,459
Just the two of us
tonight.

329
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:57,211
Oh, really?

330
00:16:57,213 --> 00:16:59,279
And what did you
have in mind?

331
00:16:59,281 --> 00:17:00,881
An object lesson.

332
00:17:00,883 --> 00:17:03,250
We're going after
Anthony Venza?

333
00:17:03,252 --> 00:17:05,920
Yes. But we're doing it
on my terms.

334
00:17:05,922 --> 00:17:07,888
Your father loses a piece
of his organization,

335
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,675
but no innocent people
get hurt in the process.

336
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:13,060
What is it?

337
00:17:13,062 --> 00:17:14,461
I explained to you
that guns

338
00:17:14,463 --> 00:17:16,296
were weapons of emotion
and unpredictability,

339
00:17:16,298 --> 00:17:18,265
but since you are far
from an expert at archery,

340
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:21,936
this will have to do,
for now.

341
00:17:25,357 --> 00:17:26,607
I like it.

342
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:28,642
You can't go out
like that.

343
00:17:28,644 --> 00:17:31,695
Why? You got a spare hood?

344
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:38,702
Does it come in purple?

345
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:44,842
I like purple.

346
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:46,877
This isn't crack.

347
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:48,295
Anyone can sell crack.

348
00:17:48,297 --> 00:17:51,098
All you need's a street
corner and a hoodie.

349
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,685
This is pharmaceutical
grade Oxycodone.

350
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,972
It is caviar.
It is champagne.

351
00:17:57,974 --> 00:18:01,358
And you sell this
with fancy houses,

352
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,029
at parties with rich kids
have got money to burn.

353
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:09,182
Check it out!

354
00:18:24,198 --> 00:18:26,083
Whoever you are,

355
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:29,003
you really think you're gonna
get out of here in one piece?

356
00:18:29,005 --> 00:18:31,872
I was thinking
the same thing.

357
00:18:31,874 --> 00:18:34,541
Anthony Venza...

358
00:18:35,877 --> 00:18:40,764
You have failed this city.

359
00:18:49,357 --> 00:18:51,025
Aah!

360
00:18:52,577 --> 00:18:55,946
Uhh! The door!

361
00:18:57,249 --> 00:19:01,401
Please...just don't hurt me.

362
00:19:01,403 --> 00:19:03,037
Aww...

363
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,407
How about just a little?

364
00:19:12,581 --> 00:19:15,766
Millions of dollars' worth
of illegal drugs confiscated,

365
00:19:15,768 --> 00:19:18,602
a massive blow to your
father's criminal proceeds,

366
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:20,420
and nobody had to die.

367
00:19:20,422 --> 00:19:23,774
Justice.

368
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:26,060
What do you think?

369
00:19:26,062 --> 00:19:31,565
I think this feels good.

370
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:36,236
And not just
the justice part.

371
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,521
Anthony Venza
was arrested last night.

372
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:50,787
The police confiscated
a warehouse

373
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,655
full of illegal
prescription drugs

374
00:19:52,657 --> 00:19:54,690
with a street value
estimated in the millions.

375
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:57,026
Several unconfirmed
witnesses reported seeing

376
00:19:57,028 --> 00:20:00,330
the Starling City vigilante
leaving the scene

377
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,631
with another
unknown accomplice...

378
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,166
possibly a woman.

379
00:20:06,053 --> 00:20:08,371
Bad year?

380
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,873
The scotch, I mean.

381
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,843
Yeah. Sorry.

382
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:17,213
Another business setback.

383
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:19,999
Wow.

384
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:22,001
You look beautiful.

385
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:24,871
Oliver Queen?

386
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:30,743
Oh...It's nice
to see you happy again.

387
00:20:30,745 --> 00:20:32,729
It's been too long.

388
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:40,420
Yeah.

389
00:20:41,572 --> 00:20:45,041
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about Venza.

390
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:48,077
Yeah, I know where
that leaves us!

391
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:55,018
I'm sorry to rush out.

392
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,687
I have this impromptu
Board of Directors meeting

393
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,423
with the Starling City
Modern Art museum.

394
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,609
I don't know much about art,

395
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:04,093
but I do know
how to pay for it.

396
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:06,446
No worries.
Whip them into shape.

397
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:10,617
Yes, sir. I'll see you
when I get back.

398
00:22:46,197 --> 00:22:47,797
Well, it's only been 30 minutes.

399
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,916
That's not too bad
for an opening.

400
00:22:49,918 --> 00:22:52,106
If they don't seat us soon,

401
00:22:52,131 --> 00:22:54,088
I'm going to write
a horrible review online.

402
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:57,006
Let me see what I can do.

403
00:22:57,008 --> 00:23:00,226
Hey. I'm loving the Cavalli.

404
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:01,877
Uh, look, I'm Tommy Merlyn.

405
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:04,564
Is there any way that we can go
to the head of the class?

406
00:23:04,566 --> 00:23:06,983
Is there?

407
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:10,603
Let us know
when our table's ready, okay?

408
00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:13,022
Maybe you can eat

409
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,692
some of those fancy peanuts
from behind the bar.

410
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,560
Hey!

411
00:23:19,062 --> 00:23:21,581
Hi. It's the two of you.

412
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:24,400
Tommy, Laurel,
this is Helena.

413
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,753
Nice to meet you.
My pleasure.

414
00:23:26,755 --> 00:23:28,588
Likewise.

415
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,739
You look beautiful.

416
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,240
Thank you.

417
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:33,242
Mr. Queen,
your table is ready.

418
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:34,744
When is our table
gonna be ready?

419
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,845
When it is.

420
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,346
Why don't you both
join us?

421
00:23:37,348 --> 00:23:38,748
No, no, we're just
gonna have a drink and--

422
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,600
We'd love to.
Are you sure?

423
00:23:40,602 --> 00:23:43,419
I'm sure I'm hungry.

424
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,471
That--

425
00:23:45,473 --> 00:23:47,607
That'll be great.
That sounds great.

426
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:49,642
There you go.

427
00:23:51,678 --> 00:23:55,114
I had forgotten that you filled
your parents' pool with beer.

428
00:23:55,116 --> 00:23:57,233
How many cases did that take?

429
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:59,285
Roughly a thousand or so.

430
00:23:59,287 --> 00:24:01,871
You know, his father
was so pissed,

431
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,623
I thought he was actually
going to drown you in it.

432
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,041
Yeah, well, death by beer,

433
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,776
there's worse ways to go.
Right, Helena?

434
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,961
Well, there are
no good ways to die.

435
00:24:08,963 --> 00:24:12,548
So, uh, how did you
and Tommy meet?

436
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:16,118
Actually, we've all known
each other since--

437
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,904
We've all known each other
forever.

438
00:24:17,906 --> 00:24:20,456
You 3 have
a lot of history.

439
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,008
Sometimes a little too much.

440
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,426
Hmm.

441
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:25,728
So, how's the night club
coming along?

442
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,481
Slower than I expected
it to. I've, uh, I've been busy.

443
00:24:28,483 --> 00:24:30,633
Well, then you must be happy
to have the extra help, then.

444
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,819
Laurel, I'm sure
that Oliver what do you mean?

445
00:24:32,821 --> 00:24:34,520
Doesn't want to talk
about work right know.

446
00:24:34,522 --> 00:24:35,588
You didn't ask him?

447
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,106
Ask me what?

448
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:40,409
Tommy wanted--Tommy said
that he was gonna talk to you

449
00:24:40,411 --> 00:24:43,012
about working for you
at your night club.

450
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:46,949
Really?

451
00:24:46,951 --> 00:24:48,367
Sorry. I didn't think
that you wanted

452
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:49,819
any responsibility at all.

453
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,721
Oh, yeah,
who'd believe that?

454
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:53,306
You've always wanted
to get into business with Tommy.

455
00:24:53,308 --> 00:24:55,508
I mean, don't you remember
when we went to Aspen

456
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,293
and you wanted
to open a ski lodge?

457
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:58,994
The only thing
that I remember from Aspen

458
00:24:58,996 --> 00:25:02,298
was your father being furious
we shared a room with one bed.

459
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,262
Wait, um...

460
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:08,797
So you two
were together...

461
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,267
And now you're dating
his best friend?

462
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:14,637
Yeah, we're just prime for
a reality show, aren't we?

463
00:25:17,457 --> 00:25:22,161
Tommy, you working for me,
that could be fun.

464
00:25:22,163 --> 00:25:24,997
I don't feel so good.
I'm gonna step outside.

465
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:28,584
I should probably
go check on him.

466
00:25:28,586 --> 00:25:31,203
Helena, it was very nice
to meet you.

467
00:25:37,794 --> 00:25:39,929
Tommy, why are you so upset?

468
00:25:39,931 --> 00:25:42,181
Why did you have to say
something to Oliver about the job?

469
00:25:42,183 --> 00:25:43,549
You were supposed
to talk to him.

470
00:25:43,551 --> 00:25:45,134
Well, I hadn't.

471
00:25:45,136 --> 00:25:46,769
Okay, I didn't realize.
I was only trying to help.

472
00:25:46,771 --> 00:25:48,804
No, you were trying
to get Oliver to help.

473
00:25:48,806 --> 00:25:51,707
It's typical Laurel.
Always running to a white knight.

474
00:25:51,709 --> 00:25:54,293
It's Oliver and Laurel.

475
00:25:54,295 --> 00:25:56,345
It always has been.

476
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,648
That's not gonna change.

477
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,616
Oliver and I are over.

478
00:26:00,618 --> 00:26:03,319
Oh, really? Because you seemed
awfully bothered by his new girlfriend.

479
00:26:03,321 --> 00:26:04,987
What, am I supposed
to like her?

480
00:26:04,989 --> 00:26:07,156
I do not want to be
Oliver's charity case, okay?

481
00:26:07,158 --> 00:26:09,492
To every day be reminded

482
00:26:09,494 --> 00:26:13,379
that I can't give you
everything he could?

483
00:26:13,381 --> 00:26:15,030
You know, losing a fortune

484
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:16,999
I think is going to be
easier than losing you,

485
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:19,034
so why don't we
just stop now.

486
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,976
Hey. I'm sorry.

487
00:26:26,978 --> 00:26:29,562
How am I supposed to know
it's gonna get so weird in there?

488
00:26:29,564 --> 00:26:33,849
No, I'm sorry.
Sorry I ever listened to you.

489
00:26:33,851 --> 00:26:35,050
Helena, what--

490
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,819
you know what
I've been through.

491
00:26:36,821 --> 00:26:39,388
I told you I couldn't
be hurt again.

492
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,490
I'm not trying
to hurt you.

493
00:26:41,492 --> 00:26:44,410
So, making me have dinner
with the love of your life

494
00:26:44,412 --> 00:26:46,162
is what, Oliver?

495
00:26:46,164 --> 00:26:48,897
Laurel was the girl things
were getting too serious with,

496
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:52,735
the girl whose sister's grave
you used to manipulate me.

497
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:54,036
I saw the way
you looked at her.

498
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:56,088
That kind of love
doesn't die.

499
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,374
You still love her.

500
00:26:58,376 --> 00:26:59,425
I don't.

501
00:27:01,546 --> 00:27:03,879
Don't.
Hey.

502
00:27:03,881 --> 00:27:04,913
Don't touch me.

503
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:07,967
I am done talking.

504
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:30,304
I came to apologize.

505
00:27:32,757 --> 00:27:34,442
I know you were
just trying to help.

506
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,695
I guess I wasn't ready
to face reality.

507
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,264
This is just so new,
you and me,

508
00:27:40,266 --> 00:27:42,983
and I didn't
want you to see...

509
00:27:43,516 --> 00:27:45,600
I'm scared.

510
00:27:46,986 --> 00:27:49,971
I'm almost 30 years old
and I've never been given

511
00:27:49,973 --> 00:27:52,690
an ounce of responsibility
in my life.

512
00:27:52,692 --> 00:27:56,060
You, you are driven
and intelligent.

513
00:27:56,062 --> 00:27:58,379
You're a million times
too good for me,

514
00:27:58,381 --> 00:28:00,431
even before I was broke.

515
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:03,935
And now I have absolutely
nothing to bring to whatever this is.

516
00:28:03,937 --> 00:28:06,404
I never cared
about the money.

517
00:28:06,406 --> 00:28:09,007
And truth be told,
billionaire

518
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:11,976
was your least
attractive quality.

519
00:28:11,978 --> 00:28:16,798
I am so sorry if I pushed you
too hard on the job with Oliver.

520
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,350
I just--I thought you working
for him was a good idea

521
00:28:19,352 --> 00:28:21,786
because
he's your friend.

522
00:28:21,788 --> 00:28:24,439
And it's okay to ask
a friend for help.

523
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:26,974
You won't lose
your street cred.

524
00:28:26,976 --> 00:28:29,577
I'm happy to lose
my street cred.

525
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:32,914
I just don't want
to lose you.

526
00:28:34,483 --> 00:28:36,284
Well...

527
00:28:36,286 --> 00:28:41,188
I'm not saying that
it's gonna be easy...

528
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,834
But I'm here for you

529
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:44,345
if you need someone
to lean on.

530
00:28:44,811 --> 00:28:48,479
That's what people do
when they're together.

531
00:28:48,481 --> 00:28:52,533
Together like
boyfriend-girlfriend?

532
00:28:52,535 --> 00:28:56,537
Mm. Do not ruin
this moment.

533
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:59,057
It was going so well
for you.

534
00:29:09,885 --> 00:29:13,187
Didn't expect to hear
from you tonight.

535
00:29:13,189 --> 00:29:16,107
Something happen?

536
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,110
I think you were right.

537
00:29:20,395 --> 00:29:23,364
Okay. About which part?

538
00:29:23,366 --> 00:29:24,866
All of it.

539
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,688
I should have listened to you.

540
00:29:32,908 --> 00:29:35,843
Oliver, you said you wanted
to help her change.

541
00:29:35,845 --> 00:29:40,098
The thing is,
she already did change.

542
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,350
When her father
killed her fiance,

543
00:29:42,352 --> 00:29:44,986
she changed into something
dark and twisted.

544
00:29:44,988 --> 00:29:46,921
You see that now, don't you?

545
00:29:46,923 --> 00:29:49,256
It's not that I--it's not
that I couldn't see it, Diggle.

546
00:29:49,258 --> 00:29:52,443
I didn't--I didn't want to.

547
00:29:52,445 --> 00:29:55,446
I'm living a double life,
and to do that,

548
00:29:55,448 --> 00:29:57,365
I'm taking all these people
that I love

549
00:29:57,367 --> 00:29:58,933
and I'm putting them
at arm's length.

550
00:29:58,935 --> 00:30:01,268
I'm giving up a lot,
so maybe--

551
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,955
maybe I thought
the universe owed me one.

552
00:30:05,073 --> 00:30:07,775
But I looked in
her eyes tonight,

553
00:30:07,777 --> 00:30:11,129
and I can't stop her
from going over the edge.

554
00:30:11,131 --> 00:30:14,081
She's--she's already past it.

555
00:30:38,473 --> 00:30:39,607
Aah!

556
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:42,693
Aah! Aah!

557
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:51,586
I don't speak Chinese,

558
00:30:51,588 --> 00:30:55,506
so I'm just gonna assume
you said good-bye.

559
00:31:04,132 --> 00:31:09,187
Tell your mistress
Frank Bertinelli sends his regards.

560
00:31:21,149 --> 00:31:22,617
Ahem.

561
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:24,202
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Steele?

562
00:31:24,204 --> 00:31:26,854
Did I mention,
it's almost Christmas,

563
00:31:26,856 --> 00:31:28,206
and many of the suicides
this time of year

564
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:31,092
are due to sudden
and unexpected joblessness?

565
00:31:34,246 --> 00:31:37,381
I want you to find out
all you can about that notebook.

566
00:31:37,383 --> 00:31:39,098
Where it was made,
how it was purchased.

567
00:31:39,244 --> 00:31:40,812
And what it could mean.
Yes, sir.

568
00:31:40,813 --> 00:31:42,796
Felicity...

569
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:45,099
I asked Josiah Hudson,
our head of security,

570
00:31:45,101 --> 00:31:47,435
to look into
the same subject matter.

571
00:31:47,437 --> 00:31:52,940
He died the next day
under questionable circumstances.

572
00:31:53,842 --> 00:31:55,893
What I may be asking of you,

573
00:31:55,895 --> 00:31:57,678
this mystery,

574
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,114
are you sure
you want to do this?

575
00:32:01,016 --> 00:32:03,016
I hate mysteries.

576
00:32:03,018 --> 00:32:05,168
They bug me.

577
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,620
They need to be solved.

578
00:32:33,648 --> 00:32:35,632
It's Dig.

579
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:37,980
What's the situation?

580
00:32:37,981 --> 00:32:39,881
War.

581
00:32:44,134 --> 00:32:46,731
Boss, we just got word--
somebody hit Zhishan.

582
00:32:46,755 --> 00:32:48,121
He's dead.

583
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,775
All right. Then we know
what's coming next.

584
00:32:52,777 --> 00:32:55,678
Tell everyone
to strap up.

585
00:33:04,906 --> 00:33:05,855
Uhh!

586
00:33:12,863 --> 00:33:16,198
Ricco's not answering
his walkie. Check it out.

587
00:33:58,876 --> 00:34:00,543
Frank Bertinelli--

588
00:34:00,545 --> 00:34:02,044
this is for Zhishan.

589
00:34:03,964 --> 00:34:05,581
Uhh!

590
00:34:07,584 --> 00:34:08,968
Run.

591
00:34:29,456 --> 00:34:30,990
Aah!

592
00:34:30,992 --> 00:34:33,075
Ohh! Oh!

593
00:34:37,704 --> 00:34:40,489
Oh--Helena.

594
00:34:40,491 --> 00:34:41,490
What is this?

595
00:34:41,492 --> 00:34:44,660
Payback for Michael.

596
00:34:44,662 --> 00:34:47,496
I know you had him killed.
Salvati told me.

597
00:34:47,498 --> 00:34:49,448
I did that to protect
the family!

598
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,500
I had to take everything
away from you

599
00:34:51,502 --> 00:34:54,887
because you took
everything away from me.

600
00:34:56,873 --> 00:34:59,675
You finally know
what it feels like

601
00:34:59,677 --> 00:35:01,543
to find out, your own blood
is responsible

602
00:35:01,545 --> 00:35:05,264
for the death
of your entire world.

603
00:35:39,883 --> 00:35:41,267
No!

604
00:35:48,108 --> 00:35:49,392
Helena?

605
00:35:51,095 --> 00:35:52,478
Helena.

606
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,921
Helena, easy. Easy.

607
00:36:24,923 --> 00:36:27,724
You were lucky.

608
00:36:27,726 --> 00:36:30,310
Am I supposed
to be grateful?

609
00:36:30,312 --> 00:36:31,594
Helena--

610
00:36:31,596 --> 00:36:32,779
He's a monster.

611
00:36:32,781 --> 00:36:35,699
A criminal.
Why would you save him?

612
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:39,102
I didn't save him.
I saved you.

613
00:36:39,104 --> 00:36:41,121
You think that because
you've killed,

614
00:36:41,123 --> 00:36:43,740
you understand what it's like
to have blood on your hands.

615
00:36:43,742 --> 00:36:45,358
You don't understand.
You don't understand

616
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,711
the toll
that it takes on you,

617
00:36:47,713 --> 00:36:50,463
especially
when it's your father.

618
00:36:50,465 --> 00:36:51,731
I'm not going to stop.

619
00:36:51,733 --> 00:36:53,750
The police
have him in custody.

620
00:36:53,752 --> 00:36:56,119
He's going to jail
and then on to prison.

621
00:36:56,121 --> 00:36:57,671
They don't have
any evidence on him.

622
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,172
They do now.

623
00:37:00,641 --> 00:37:02,125
The laptop.

624
00:37:02,127 --> 00:37:03,577
He's going away, Helena,

625
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:05,762
for the rest of his life.

626
00:37:05,764 --> 00:37:08,631
This...is justice.

627
00:37:08,633 --> 00:37:10,400
Then I guess you were right.

628
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:12,352
I'm more interested
in revenge.

629
00:37:12,354 --> 00:37:14,604
Stay out of my way, Oliver,

630
00:37:14,606 --> 00:37:18,358
or I'll make sure your secret
doesn't stay secret.

631
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,777
Helena.

632
00:37:23,164 --> 00:37:26,616
What I did,

633
00:37:26,618 --> 00:37:28,752
everything that I've done,

634
00:37:28,754 --> 00:37:32,172
I've done because
I care about you.

635
00:37:32,174 --> 00:37:37,794
Too bad I can't say
the same.

636
00:37:50,007 --> 00:37:51,224
Hey, you.

637
00:37:51,226 --> 00:37:52,525
Thanks for the call.

638
00:37:52,527 --> 00:37:55,195
What are
ex-sisters-in-law for?

639
00:37:55,197 --> 00:37:57,480
Mm.

640
00:38:00,618 --> 00:38:05,405
Chili cheese fries
with jalapenos. Hmm.

641
00:38:07,191 --> 00:38:10,543
That's a cry for help
if I've ever seen one.

642
00:38:10,545 --> 00:38:11,828
Ahh...

643
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,630
I don't know what hurts worse,

644
00:38:13,632 --> 00:38:17,717
this or getting shot
with a curare-laced bullet.

645
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:20,387
Been there, done that.
Definitely the bullet.

646
00:38:20,389 --> 00:38:22,205
Ah...

647
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:28,778
You know, Oliver, I'm
no expert at this, but...

648
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:33,216
I don't think love is about
changing or saving a person.

649
00:38:33,218 --> 00:38:35,235
I think it's about
finding the person

650
00:38:35,237 --> 00:38:37,020
who's already the right fit.

651
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:42,025
One day you will.

652
00:38:42,027 --> 00:38:46,229
I think I burnt
that particular bridge.

653
00:38:46,231 --> 00:38:48,331
Napalmed it, actually.

654
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:50,566
So things didn't work out
exactly as you planned.

655
00:38:50,568 --> 00:38:52,035
You did save
Frank Bertinelli's life.

656
00:38:52,037 --> 00:38:53,787
He'll be doing time
for a while.

657
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,839
Justice wins out.

658
00:38:55,841 --> 00:39:00,243
Helena
doesn't see it that way.

659
00:39:00,245 --> 00:39:03,913
You opened up,
took a risk with your heart.

660
00:39:03,915 --> 00:39:06,416
The Oliver I met
a few months ago

661
00:39:06,418 --> 00:39:09,752
would not have been
able to do that.

662
00:39:09,754 --> 00:39:12,288
And when you meet
the right person,

663
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:14,424
you'll be ready for her.

664
00:39:29,457 --> 00:39:30,874
What are you doing?

665
00:39:30,876 --> 00:39:32,959
It needs to be dark in here
for me to do this.

666
00:39:32,961 --> 00:39:35,245
If I had had more time
to think of that sentence

667
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,297
it wouldn't have sounded
so dirty.

668
00:39:37,299 --> 00:39:38,781
Look.

669
00:39:43,921 --> 00:39:45,972
I don't see anything.

670
00:39:45,974 --> 00:39:47,557
I got these
from applied sciences.

671
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:49,309
They're able to pick up
the subvisible variations

672
00:39:49,311 --> 00:39:51,344
in the UV spectrum.

673
00:39:51,346 --> 00:39:54,431
Now look at the book again.

674
00:40:18,989 --> 00:40:20,673
Hi.

675
00:40:20,675 --> 00:40:22,592
Now, look,

676
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:24,344
I'm sorry about last night.

677
00:40:24,346 --> 00:40:26,496
It just--I let it
get too far

678
00:40:26,498 --> 00:40:28,848
sitting at the same table.
That was...

679
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,133
that was stupid.

680
00:40:30,135 --> 00:40:33,937
No. I was stupid.

681
00:40:33,939 --> 00:40:38,174
I haven't been
entirely honest with you.

682
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,811
My dad cut me off.

683
00:40:41,813 --> 00:40:43,646
He froze all my funds.

684
00:40:43,648 --> 00:40:46,983
I am living on fumes.

685
00:40:46,985 --> 00:40:48,485
Really?

686
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,187
Why didn't you
say anything?

687
00:40:51,189 --> 00:40:52,956
Embarrassment,
shame, jealousy,

688
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:56,459
probably a few other emotions
I'm not used to feeling.

689
00:40:56,461 --> 00:40:58,878
Tommy, my trust fund
is your trust fund.

690
00:41:00,364 --> 00:41:01,581
No.

691
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:03,833
That is the easy answer.

692
00:41:03,835 --> 00:41:08,054
And believe me,
I have loved easy answers.

693
00:41:08,056 --> 00:41:10,056
What I need is a job.

694
00:41:12,209 --> 00:41:13,893
I'm trying to change.

695
00:41:13,895 --> 00:41:17,880
Not sure into what yet,
but...

696
00:41:17,882 --> 00:41:20,934
I don't want to be
what I was anymore.

697
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,020
It just so happens
that I have

698
00:41:24,022 --> 00:41:25,721
a general manager
position

699
00:41:25,723 --> 00:41:28,057
that is available.

700
00:41:28,059 --> 00:41:31,194
You're probably
the guy for the job.

701
00:41:31,196 --> 00:41:33,196
Will I be getting dental?
This smile wasn't cheap.

702
00:41:33,198 --> 00:41:36,282
I'll look into that.
Thank you.

703
00:41:36,284 --> 00:41:37,750
Thank you.

704
00:41:37,752 --> 00:41:39,702
You're welcome.

705
00:41:44,441 --> 00:41:45,758
You okay?

706
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,094
I will be.

707
00:41:48,096 --> 00:41:49,796
Something happen with Helena?

708
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,898
We had a falling out.

709
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:56,586
But I have a feeling that
I will be seeing her again.

710
