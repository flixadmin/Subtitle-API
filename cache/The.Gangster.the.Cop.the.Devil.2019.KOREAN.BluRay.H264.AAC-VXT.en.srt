1
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:11,439
(This film is based on
a true story.)

2
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:14,856
(Names, characters and events
have been dramatized.)

3
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:49,205
Come on...

4
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,818
You should've slowed down.

5
00:02:52,898 --> 00:02:54,527
It's banged up.

6
00:02:56,325 --> 00:02:57,312
Are you okay?

7
00:02:57,392 --> 00:02:59,145
- Yes, and you?
- I'm fine.

8
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:01,891
Why did you drive so fast
at night?

9
00:03:02,592 --> 00:03:05,091
- Photos look good?
- What?

10
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:08,325
There's no need for that.

11
00:03:09,091 --> 00:03:10,492
What are you talking about?

12
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,312
Photos are important
for insurance.

13
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:15,345
Don't change your story later.

14
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:16,857
It's scratched up...

15
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:08,892
(The Gangster, The Cop, The Devil)

16
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:12,213
(August 2005)

17
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,945
Another murder took place
near Cheonan

18
00:04:16,026 --> 00:04:18,226
early this morning.

19
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:24,945
Many murders and missing person
cases have been reported

20
00:04:25,026 --> 00:04:27,979
since last year,
but the police have not closed...

21
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:30,844
We want to close them, too.

22
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:32,925
Close cases,

23
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:37,226
go on vacations, and get promoted.

24
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:42,526
Turn off the siren!

25
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:46,526
No one in this town gives a damn.

26
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:50,026
Not a single person here.

27
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:53,393
- It's a filthy world...
- You're right.

28
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,280
Look at those gangsters.

29
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,993
Those guys need a serious beating.

30
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:05,112
Where you going? We're on a case!

31
00:05:05,193 --> 00:05:06,946
Like hell we are.
Does it look like one?

32
00:05:07,027 --> 00:05:09,193
- Tae-seok!
- See you at the scene!

33
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:11,980
- You can't even do that?
- I'm sorry.

34
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:13,494
Seriously.

35
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,047
Please walk through.

36
00:05:15,127 --> 00:05:17,214
- Go ahead, I'm a cop.
- Sir!

37
00:05:17,294 --> 00:05:19,527
I told you
to stay out of my sight.

38
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:22,913
Block the entrance.

39
00:05:22,993 --> 00:05:24,446
Step aside.

40
00:05:24,527 --> 00:05:27,893
It's a hot day.
Why are you here again?

41
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,160
Does a cop need permission
from gangsters to be here?

42
00:05:32,527 --> 00:05:33,514
Sir!

43
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:34,527
Detective!

44
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:38,494
Please head back.
Today's a bad day!

45
00:05:39,227 --> 00:05:41,360
Is something up today?

46
00:05:42,127 --> 00:05:45,227
The traffic is messed up,
and so are you.

47
00:05:45,793 --> 00:05:47,394
Okay.

48
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,494
Here. Please go away.

49
00:05:57,093 --> 00:06:00,993
You bastard,
what do you take me for?

50
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:04,559
How dare you try to bribe me?

51
00:06:07,893 --> 00:06:09,260
Here you go, bastards.

52
00:06:09,594 --> 00:06:13,395
You should be careful.

53
00:06:14,428 --> 00:06:18,994
Why are gangsters
trying to stop a cop?

54
00:06:24,128 --> 00:06:25,295
Continue.

55
00:06:26,295 --> 00:06:28,094
I hope you win!

56
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:53,595
Boss!

57
00:06:58,428 --> 00:07:00,495
That damn cop's here.

58
00:07:03,128 --> 00:07:05,161
Put it down.

59
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:15,361
- Wrap him up nicely.
- Yes, boss.

60
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:23,048
I received $200
in gift certificates.

61
00:07:23,128 --> 00:07:25,328
Taking our 10% cut,

62
00:07:27,061 --> 00:07:29,128
your prize money is $180!

63
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:31,928
What the heck?

64
00:07:32,262 --> 00:07:33,529
Open it.

65
00:07:37,095 --> 00:07:37,949
Salute.

66
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:39,095
Screw that.

67
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:45,529
You're charged with illegal
conversion of gift certificates.

68
00:07:45,795 --> 00:07:47,249
Remain silent or don't.

69
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:50,029
You could retain a lawyer,
or you could not.

70
00:07:50,396 --> 00:07:51,449
Let's go.

71
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:52,282
Sir!

72
00:07:52,362 --> 00:07:54,949
Come in for a second.
Please come in.

73
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:57,462
Buddy, come out.

74
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:02,029
Put them on nicely.

75
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:07,862
Good morning, boss!

76
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:20,862
It's me.

77
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:22,882
Your bastard's back again.

78
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,162
What?

79
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:28,262
I sent him to a crime scene.
What's he doing there?

80
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:32,461
Ask the bastard yourself.

81
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,529
Tell Hur I'm heading there.

82
00:08:36,262 --> 00:08:39,828
You can't do this to me
after taking a cut every month.

83
00:08:40,095 --> 00:08:42,014
Since you took it all
for yourself,

84
00:08:42,095 --> 00:08:44,995
your boys are making a mess
at my workplace.

85
00:08:45,596 --> 00:08:49,250
I told you not to exchange
in the shop, didn't I?

86
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,816
Start an exchange shop
under someone else's name.

87
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:55,050
Do that or share the stakes.
You know the game.

88
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,116
I don't do petty business.

89
00:08:57,196 --> 00:08:59,950
I'm busy making machines
and opening new shops.

90
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,116
Can't you cut him off
before he comes over?

91
00:09:03,196 --> 00:09:04,597
My boys have families to feed.

92
00:09:04,863 --> 00:09:07,230
Okay, I'll take care of
that bastard.

93
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:20,417
What?

94
00:09:20,496 --> 00:09:21,417
"What"?

95
00:09:21,496 --> 00:09:22,816
Are we buddies?

96
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:23,530
Where are you?

97
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,196
Heading to the crime scene.
I'm hanging up.

98
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:28,883
I don't want friends like you.

99
00:09:28,962 --> 00:09:30,283
Let me just shut off...

100
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:32,130
- the fan.
- Come here.

101
00:09:37,363 --> 00:09:38,597
Stop in front of there.

102
00:09:38,863 --> 00:09:40,397
Sure, as you wish.

103
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:49,030
- Thanks for the ride.
- Thank you.

104
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,563
Come on, sir!

105
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:58,063
I gave you a ride!
It's a give-and-take!

106
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:02,950
Here's my payment.

107
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,563
Kneel on the ground!

108
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:07,030
I'm gonna call the cops on you!

109
00:10:07,598 --> 00:10:09,484
Damn traffic jam...

110
00:10:09,564 --> 00:10:12,197
Where the heck have you been?

111
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,797
There's a crowd already?

112
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:17,016
Get rid of them.

113
00:10:17,097 --> 00:10:19,016
Reporters! One moment, please!

114
00:10:19,097 --> 00:10:21,518
Take photos later.
I'm really sorry.

115
00:10:21,598 --> 00:10:23,531
Could you make way?

116
00:10:24,896 --> 00:10:27,817
Secure the scene properly!
What have you been doing?

117
00:10:27,896 --> 00:10:30,398
Hey! Move aside!

118
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,031
You came so late.

119
00:10:58,264 --> 00:11:01,016
A crowd's gathering!

120
00:11:01,097 --> 00:11:02,318
People are gathering!

121
00:11:02,398 --> 00:11:03,531
Good day.

122
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:05,418
Did you check his ID?

123
00:11:05,497 --> 00:11:08,131
We're checking his plate number,
so we'll find out soon.

124
00:11:15,864 --> 00:11:18,164
He died only a few hours ago.

125
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,318
Between 3 and 5 this morning.

126
00:11:21,398 --> 00:11:26,885
Cause of death is either
blood loss or a heart attack.

127
00:11:26,964 --> 00:11:28,452
That's my initial impression.

128
00:11:28,532 --> 00:11:31,032
Kiddo, come take some photos.

129
00:11:47,065 --> 00:11:49,252
Hey, Seo-jin! Come over here!

130
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:51,085
Look into this.

131
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:54,299
I told you not to call me by name
at the crime scene.

132
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,452
My apologies, Chief Cha,
salute, take a look.

133
00:11:57,532 --> 00:11:58,964
What is it?

134
00:12:00,532 --> 00:12:02,399
A rear-ender?

135
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,498
It does look like it... or not.

136
00:12:08,897 --> 00:12:11,185
I hope he didn't die over this.

137
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:14,065
I'd prefer a random killing.

138
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:35,052
Thanks for the other day.

139
00:12:35,132 --> 00:12:38,118
For turning my boy into a cripple.

140
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:40,865
There are rules for a reason.

141
00:12:43,464 --> 00:12:44,832
Anyway.

142
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:48,520
Our businesses are separate, but
we share machines and engineers.

143
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,220
All right.

144
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,386
But we gotta resolve
the turf issue, no?

145
00:12:53,465 --> 00:12:55,333
Be flexible.

146
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:03,465
- Sang-do.
- Yes, Dong-su?

147
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:09,186
If you only eat sweets,
you get toothaches.

148
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:14,386
Don't stir up trouble and just
manage the shop I assigned you.

149
00:13:14,465 --> 00:13:17,600
Everyone has their limit.

150
00:13:17,866 --> 00:13:20,465
If you cross mine, you're dead.

151
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:25,898
I don't even cross the road.

152
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:29,018
Steve Jobs said,

153
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,233
"Stay hungry."

154
00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:35,520
I got no capital and no investors,

155
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,266
so I'm still hungry.

156
00:13:41,566 --> 00:13:43,018
Sir.

157
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:47,233
My boss is being lenient
because you two are friends.

158
00:13:47,832 --> 00:13:51,253
That's why he's giving you
the tech and engineers, too.

159
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,600
The slot arcade business

160
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:58,220
is nothing like fighting over
these bars and clubs!

161
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,819
Are you nuts?
In front of our bosses?

162
00:14:00,898 --> 00:14:03,354
Give us what?
You should be kissing up them!

163
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:05,521
What the hell!

164
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:06,967
Bastard!

165
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,601
Is this how you train your men?

166
00:14:11,534 --> 00:14:13,200
Look at him glaring at me.

167
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:15,334
Hey, Dong-su.

168
00:14:16,434 --> 00:14:20,833
Why are you being almighty
after giving me the crumbs?

169
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:26,167
How can we keep the peace
like this?

170
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,167
Come here.

171
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:38,034
Yes, boss.

172
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:46,187
Can't you see we're talking?

173
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:47,134
Come here.

174
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,100
Look at this jerk.

175
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:06,724
We can work peacefully now.

176
00:15:14,457 --> 00:15:16,223
Suck it up!

177
00:15:22,591 --> 00:15:23,925
It's good.

178
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,511
(Cheonan Police)

179
00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:30,645
Choi Jung-gyu, 46 years old.

180
00:15:30,725 --> 00:15:33,678
No enemies, debts, lawsuits
or anything like that.

181
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:35,478
Autopsy report was clear.

182
00:15:35,558 --> 00:15:37,344
Over a dozen stab wounds.

183
00:15:37,424 --> 00:15:38,811
It looks like an amateur job.

184
00:15:38,891 --> 00:15:40,478
He just went nuts.

185
00:15:40,558 --> 00:15:43,945
But it feels too unusual
to be an amateur job.

186
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:45,511
No evidence was left behind.

187
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:48,725
No footprints, blood, hairs,
fingerprints, nothing.

188
00:15:49,357 --> 00:15:51,778
Since the wallet's gone,
it could be a robbery,

189
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:53,778
but it wasn't for a lot of money,
so maybe not.

190
00:15:53,858 --> 00:15:56,645
People kill
for the smallest things.

191
00:15:56,725 --> 00:15:59,344
Briefing's over,
Get the captain of Unit 1.

192
00:15:59,424 --> 00:16:00,391
Yes, sir!

193
00:16:05,025 --> 00:16:06,291
Yes, Chief.

194
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:11,311
This case is likely
a robbery-homicide,

195
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:14,511
so look for anyone
with similar criminal records.

196
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,711
Right away, sir.

197
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,357
You guys, back up Unit 1.

198
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:21,911
It's the same suspect
for all three cases.

199
00:16:21,991 --> 00:16:23,491
Which cases?

200
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,811
July 15, West Mountain reservoir.

201
00:16:28,891 --> 00:16:32,611
July 23, Boryung Sunbeach Motel.

202
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,591
And, last night's case.

203
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:37,778
A knife was the murder weapon
in all three cases.

204
00:16:37,858 --> 00:16:40,692
Seeing length and width
of the knife,

205
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,992
it could be the same knife.

206
00:16:43,258 --> 00:16:45,358
No, it is the same knife.

207
00:16:46,525 --> 00:16:48,379
It's a serial killing case.

208
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:50,445
We're not in the States.

209
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:52,946
We can't get guns.
Everyone kills with knives.

210
00:16:53,026 --> 00:16:54,879
Freaking nonsense.

211
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,245
There are over 1,000 murders
a year.

212
00:16:58,325 --> 00:17:00,946
By your logic,
half of them are done by one guy.

213
00:17:01,026 --> 00:17:02,225
Are you nuts?

214
00:17:02,892 --> 00:17:05,992
Who are you to mess with
another jurisdiction's cases?

215
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:09,525
Does the killer care
about jurisdictions?

216
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,946
If we don't catch him soon,
there will be problems.

217
00:17:13,026 --> 00:17:15,712
He's too careful to be
indiscriminate.

218
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:17,712
He could strike again at any...

219
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:19,379
You work so easily.

220
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:21,379
These aren't salad ingredients!

221
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:23,826
You can't just toss them together!

222
00:17:25,258 --> 00:17:27,946
I'm not randomly mixing them.

223
00:17:28,026 --> 00:17:32,545
These cases are a week apart
in the Chungnam region.

224
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,692
Our informants got nothing.

225
00:17:36,892 --> 00:17:39,412
It's intuition.

226
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,712
Screw your intuition.

227
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:46,846
Didn't your intuition lead you
to a gang-operated arcade?

228
00:17:46,926 --> 00:17:48,712
You had that much free time?

229
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:51,392
They're not criminals?

230
00:17:52,258 --> 00:17:54,959
Gangsters and killers
are cut from the same cloth.

231
00:17:55,225 --> 00:17:58,493
Jung Tae-seok, what's with you?

232
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:04,960
Are you so desperate
to get promoted?

233
00:18:08,793 --> 00:18:10,259
Geez...

234
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:14,893
Yes, that's what I'm after.

235
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,226
After arresting the killer.

236
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,246
The briefing's over, come out!

237
00:18:23,326 --> 00:18:25,027
Let's grab that killer.

238
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,446
I'm not drunk. I'll drive myself.

239
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:34,346
But, sir...

240
00:18:34,426 --> 00:18:36,546
Take the boys and head back.

241
00:18:36,626 --> 00:18:37,693
Yes, boss.

242
00:18:49,726 --> 00:18:51,647
That's correct, Mr. Chairman.

243
00:18:51,726 --> 00:18:55,647
Hur may act rash,
but he's a smart man.

244
00:18:55,726 --> 00:18:57,927
He won't stir up trouble anymore.

245
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,526
Yes, don't worry.

246
00:19:06,793 --> 00:19:08,726
Have a good night.

247
00:19:35,994 --> 00:19:37,227
I'm sorry.

248
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:40,427
The road was slippery.

249
00:19:49,928 --> 00:19:51,961
It looks fine. You can just go.

250
00:19:52,227 --> 00:19:53,514
What?

251
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:55,447
But I still hit you...

252
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,427
I'm fine, you can go.

253
00:19:58,761 --> 00:20:00,994
Are you really okay?

254
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,761
Yes, it's fine.

255
00:20:08,928 --> 00:20:10,694
Bastard!

256
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,894
Dammit!

257
00:20:31,294 --> 00:20:32,527
What the hell?

258
00:21:00,862 --> 00:21:02,029
Who are you?

259
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,528
Come here!

260
00:23:55,897 --> 00:23:57,263
Who's there?

261
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:18,964
It wasn't Hur.

262
00:24:20,597 --> 00:24:22,250
I've never seen him before.

263
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,384
It was Hur, boss.

264
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:27,283
He's not in the gang world.

265
00:24:27,363 --> 00:24:29,952
His attack felt cold,
but emotional, too.

266
00:24:30,032 --> 00:24:31,852
It felt different.

267
00:24:31,932 --> 00:24:34,418
Who else would try to attack you

268
00:24:34,498 --> 00:24:36,418
in our line of work?

269
00:24:36,498 --> 00:24:37,798
Give me that.

270
00:24:41,698 --> 00:24:43,785
It was too dark to see properly...

271
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:45,585
(White sedan, Daejeon 23XX plate)

272
00:24:45,664 --> 00:24:47,818
- Get out!
- Find it no matter what.

273
00:24:47,898 --> 00:24:49,918
Be careful there.

274
00:24:49,998 --> 00:24:51,832
We're friends.

275
00:24:54,264 --> 00:24:56,364
Sorry to bother you.

276
00:24:56,998 --> 00:24:58,618
The patient looks so damn comfy.

277
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:00,032
What is it now?

278
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:01,965
I brought a box of Red Bull.

279
00:25:02,431 --> 00:25:05,298
I heard you got poked.

280
00:25:05,932 --> 00:25:07,918
I got a call from the hospital.

281
00:25:07,998 --> 00:25:11,598
You must be so embarrassed.

282
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:14,765
You're a don, after all.

283
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:18,718
Likewise, you're a cop, after all.

284
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:20,965
Cops are so incompetent.

285
00:25:21,231 --> 00:25:24,585
That's why bad things
keep happening to model citizens.

286
00:25:24,664 --> 00:25:25,865
Oh my...

287
00:25:29,531 --> 00:25:32,431
Model citizen, Jang Dong-su.

288
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:35,998
Tell me everything
about that night.

289
00:25:36,264 --> 00:25:38,032
I'll catch him for you.

290
00:25:38,932 --> 00:25:40,918
I can probably catch him faster.

291
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,531
Yeah?

292
00:25:43,231 --> 00:25:45,364
Wanna bet?

293
00:25:46,498 --> 00:25:49,332
Spill it, jerk.

294
00:25:49,933 --> 00:25:52,265
I'll catch him for you.

295
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:56,899
Fine, do you mind?

296
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:05,799
I tripped at night and got hurt.

297
00:26:13,766 --> 00:26:15,732
Right, at night.

298
00:26:16,532 --> 00:26:18,753
You gotta watch where you walk.

299
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:24,232
Unlucky bastards can trip
and fall on multiple knives.

300
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:16,467
Jang's car is a black Mercedes,
3849, right?

301
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,733
Got it, I'll call you back.

302
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,500
Bastard...

303
00:27:32,034 --> 00:27:33,967
Rear collision.

304
00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:36,967
White sedan.

305
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:41,666
I was right, you bastard.

306
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:44,767
(Wishing you a fast recovery!
Hur Sang-do)

307
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:53,867
Jeez, look at you.

308
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,233
You okay?

309
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,733
- Have a seat.
- I'm fine.

310
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,666
I feel so bad,
I can barely look at you.

311
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:08,353
What will happen now?

312
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:12,567
You got jumped even before
the ink on the contract dried.

313
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,400
What'd you like me to do?

314
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,533
A ton of my boys are cripples now.

315
00:28:19,934 --> 00:28:22,034
Pay their hospital bills
and some compensation,

316
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,534
and hand over the flagship
and Sungan shops.

317
00:28:27,735 --> 00:28:31,554
I'll make sure your boys
are well compensated.

318
00:28:31,634 --> 00:28:33,001
And the shops?

319
00:28:34,301 --> 00:28:36,768
Was this your plan all along?

320
00:28:41,634 --> 00:28:42,835
Dong-su.

321
00:28:45,868 --> 00:28:51,367
If I'd done it,
would you still be alive?

322
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:54,868
Think carefully.

323
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,367
I'm really curious, too.

324
00:28:58,835 --> 00:29:01,367
Who'd do a number on you
like this?

325
00:29:02,801 --> 00:29:04,001
I'm off.

326
00:29:04,267 --> 00:29:06,254
So embarrassing!

327
00:29:06,334 --> 00:29:11,234
A gangster getting stabbed!
I'd just kill myself!

328
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,955
Trust me and give me
two men on this case.

329
00:29:16,035 --> 00:29:18,921
I'll close them in one go.

330
00:29:19,001 --> 00:29:21,888
Why don't you just
request a furlough?

331
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,621
I barely have enough men
to run this department.

332
00:29:24,701 --> 00:29:27,554
Why do you want to
take someone else's work?

333
00:29:27,634 --> 00:29:29,655
Chief, it's a huge case.

334
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:31,655
Close one, and more will follow.

335
00:29:31,735 --> 00:29:34,688
Like a super-long train.

336
00:29:34,768 --> 00:29:36,668
Buzz off!

337
00:29:40,701 --> 00:29:44,502
There's a witness
who survived the attack.

338
00:29:45,902 --> 00:29:48,036
A witness came forward?

339
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,702
Jang Dong-su.

340
00:29:58,769 --> 00:29:59,902
What? Jang Dong-su?

341
00:30:01,235 --> 00:30:03,856
He was stabbed a few days ago.

342
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:06,689
A two-hour surgery
barely kept him alive.

343
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:07,722
Listen to yourself.

344
00:30:07,802 --> 00:30:10,235
Think for a second.

345
00:30:11,036 --> 00:30:14,389
What kind of psychotic idiot
would attack a gang boss?

346
00:30:14,469 --> 00:30:16,922
The killer's not involved
with the gangs.

347
00:30:17,002 --> 00:30:19,756
I'm sure of it,
he's a serial killer!

348
00:30:19,836 --> 00:30:20,869
Shut up!

349
00:30:23,302 --> 00:30:26,435
This is a gang matter.
I'll assign it to Unit 2.

350
00:30:28,435 --> 00:30:31,036
I'm warning you,
don't get involved.

351
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,936
Get out!

352
00:30:33,602 --> 00:30:36,656
Go easy on covering his ass.

353
00:30:36,736 --> 00:30:39,469
This isn't the time for that.

354
00:30:41,802 --> 00:30:42,922
What? Cover him?

355
00:30:43,002 --> 00:30:44,822
What is it then?

356
00:30:44,902 --> 00:30:46,368
You little bastard!

357
00:30:51,802 --> 00:30:53,502
Let's say you're right.

358
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,422
But still, Jang is the victim.

359
00:30:56,502 --> 00:30:58,756
Will you get a warrant
for his arrest?

360
00:30:58,836 --> 00:31:00,656
Or go arrest him without one?

361
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:02,937
How many crimes has he committed?

362
00:31:04,336 --> 00:31:07,289
We gotta get him now,
and mess him up.

363
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:09,003
He's about to burst.

364
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:12,256
If we don't do anything,
he'll kill the killer,

365
00:31:12,336 --> 00:31:14,423
and we'll be left with
three open cases.

366
00:31:14,503 --> 00:31:16,890
How can Jang find him?

367
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,423
He's a gangster, not a cop.

368
00:31:18,503 --> 00:31:21,957
It's not even work to find someone
with his boys.

369
00:31:22,037 --> 00:31:23,837
Also, Jang saw...

370
00:31:27,003 --> 00:31:29,570
the killer's face.

371
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,470
Get out.

372
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,970
You're not making
an ounce of sense.

373
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,603
Get out!

374
00:31:55,803 --> 00:31:58,870
Why don't you
talk to the landlord?

375
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,757
What am I supposed to do?

376
00:32:03,837 --> 00:32:06,269
I gotta work to make money!

377
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:09,903
What? Birthday?

378
00:32:12,303 --> 00:32:15,690
Why is the baby's birthday
so important?

379
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,490
I'm tired as hell!

380
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:21,591
I haven't slept in two days,
don't nag me about a birthday!

381
00:32:21,671 --> 00:32:23,604
Your baby's birthday?

382
00:32:25,537 --> 00:32:26,370
What?

383
00:32:28,304 --> 00:32:30,671
That kid you mentioned.

384
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,404
Give me that.

385
00:32:47,871 --> 00:32:49,891
Sharp face.

386
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:52,838
Thin cheeks. Angled chin.

387
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,704
Long and narrow nose.

388
00:33:01,404 --> 00:33:04,038
Lips bigger than the nose...

389
00:33:09,604 --> 00:33:12,270
That's pretty close.

390
00:33:21,395 --> 00:33:23,796
You shouldn't have had the kid.

391
00:33:24,729 --> 00:33:26,862
It's not his fault.

392
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:33,682
Find him before the cops do.

393
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,462
Understood, boss.

394
00:34:15,897 --> 00:34:17,997
Bro, where are we?

395
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:20,530
Who are you?

396
00:35:03,664 --> 00:35:05,998
Thank you for your cooperation!

397
00:35:08,698 --> 00:35:12,451
We're locking down
illegal slot arcades!

398
00:35:12,531 --> 00:35:14,964
Everyone should stay put!

399
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:17,497
Where's the boss?

400
00:35:17,998 --> 00:35:20,197
Get him down here!

401
00:35:25,731 --> 00:35:27,998
Yeah? Hold on.

402
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:34,531
Okay, go ahead.

403
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:39,684
Jang is so adorable,
he's a scheming bastard.

404
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:42,351
63 out of 97 machines
have been meddled with.

405
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,517
Should I get a warrant?

406
00:35:43,597 --> 00:35:44,818
Hold on.

407
00:35:44,898 --> 00:35:46,698
Let me ask him.

408
00:35:48,264 --> 00:35:50,651
So, should I get a warrant?

409
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,351
What do you want?

410
00:35:52,431 --> 00:35:54,551
The one who stabbed you.

411
00:35:54,631 --> 00:35:58,330
Tell me everything,
and I'll look the other way.

412
00:35:58,931 --> 00:36:00,864
What if I don't?

413
00:36:02,864 --> 00:36:07,698
Since you're paying off my boss,
I'm nothing to you, huh?

414
00:36:08,464 --> 00:36:10,931
Listen, Jang.

415
00:36:11,197 --> 00:36:12,864
The guy who stabbed you...

416
00:36:13,731 --> 00:36:15,632
he's a serial killer.

417
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:19,885
He's a bit strange.

418
00:36:19,965 --> 00:36:22,518
He's different from other psychos.

419
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:24,198
You're the evidence.

420
00:36:26,799 --> 00:36:29,518
What the heck
are you talking about?

421
00:36:29,598 --> 00:36:33,231
Why do you think
he messed with you?

422
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,752
Most psychopaths go after girls,

423
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:45,318
or people who are weaker
than they are.

424
00:36:45,398 --> 00:36:47,919
But this bastard kills
indiscriminately.

425
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:51,899
If we don't find him soon,
more people will die.

426
00:36:52,899 --> 00:36:55,231
What the hell's your problem?

427
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:58,852
Hand over the info
and do your gangster stuff.

428
00:36:58,932 --> 00:37:00,785
It's a win-win.

429
00:37:00,865 --> 00:37:03,585
I'll catch him, put him on trial,

430
00:37:03,665 --> 00:37:06,231
and lock him up for good!

431
00:37:08,498 --> 00:37:09,532
And then what?

432
00:37:10,398 --> 00:37:12,432
Nothing. It's over.

433
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:15,699
That's it?

434
00:37:16,532 --> 00:37:19,965
When the country's biggest
luxury casino is built

435
00:37:20,231 --> 00:37:23,251
on the penthouse
of this skyscraper,

436
00:37:23,331 --> 00:37:25,932
the entire area surrounding
our Zeus building

437
00:37:26,198 --> 00:37:28,852
will become the hottest spot
in town.

438
00:37:28,932 --> 00:37:32,885
Enough of this crap,
I heard this place's gone to hell.

439
00:37:32,965 --> 00:37:34,533
Dammit!

440
00:37:36,933 --> 00:37:41,486
Everyone who lined up for
pre-construction units has left.

441
00:37:41,566 --> 00:37:45,599
Naturally, investors are
delaying their funding.

442
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:50,232
Weird rumors went around
after your incident.

443
00:37:51,299 --> 00:37:53,933
The Chungju region
is another problem.

444
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:57,399
Hur's boys are moving in
on our turf.

445
00:37:58,399 --> 00:38:00,418
You still haven't found him?

446
00:38:00,499 --> 00:38:04,966
We found his car
on the national highway.

447
00:38:05,232 --> 00:38:06,453
His car?

448
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:09,453
It was parked at a rest stop
for a few days.

449
00:38:09,533 --> 00:38:10,753
My boys found it.

450
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:12,252
Where's the car now?

451
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,286
We brought it back.

452
00:38:14,366 --> 00:38:17,966
There was a murder
a few days ago in Sintanjin.

453
00:38:18,232 --> 00:38:19,418
And this.

454
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:22,252
Dumped or lost,

455
00:38:22,332 --> 00:38:26,700
they found this 3km away
from the car.

456
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,586
Keep this safe.

457
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:34,833
Yes, sir.

458
00:38:41,466 --> 00:38:42,252
Hello.

459
00:38:42,332 --> 00:38:44,299
It's me.

460
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,252
What a surprise.

461
00:38:49,332 --> 00:38:51,887
You know
the Sintanjin murder case?

462
00:38:51,967 --> 00:38:53,367
What about it?

463
00:38:54,701 --> 00:38:56,287
That bastard did it.

464
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,567
What?

465
00:39:00,901 --> 00:39:02,834
How do you know that?

466
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,901
We found his car there.

467
00:39:10,367 --> 00:39:12,901
I'm at the top of my game.

468
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:16,821
I got here by risking my life.

469
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:20,367
Then some guy comes along
and grabs my ankle.

470
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:24,487
What else can I do?
I gotta cut his arm off.

471
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:26,220
I can't cut my ankle.

472
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,534
But that guy disappeared
without a trace.

473
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:33,487
After ruining
a gangster's reputation.

474
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:34,721
Buddy.

475
00:39:34,801 --> 00:39:38,500
Whoever messes with me
must take responsibility.

476
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:43,200
Reputation is everything
to a gangster.

477
00:39:44,267 --> 00:39:49,419
I'll chop him up good
and put him on display.

478
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,901
You're telling a cop
you'll kill a man?

479
00:39:54,534 --> 00:39:56,754
We do things that the law can't.

480
00:39:56,834 --> 00:39:59,921
A bad guy will catch
another bad guy?

481
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:01,500
No.

482
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:06,467
Two bad guys
will catch a worse man.

483
00:40:10,902 --> 00:40:12,668
His car key.

484
00:40:17,635 --> 00:40:20,201
Do you not see me as a cop?

485
00:40:21,234 --> 00:40:24,234
I could arrest you right away.

486
00:40:25,002 --> 00:40:27,420
You can't. Why?

487
00:40:27,501 --> 00:40:30,501
You want him more than me.

488
00:40:38,835 --> 00:40:42,802
I'll provide manpower
and foot the bill.

489
00:40:43,868 --> 00:40:48,268
We'll share the tips,
and help each other out.

490
00:40:48,802 --> 00:40:50,002
And at the end?

491
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:52,455
Split the bastard in half?

492
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:54,935
Whoever catches him keeps him.

493
00:40:55,201 --> 00:40:59,435
So, if I catch him first,
we go by the law,

494
00:41:00,568 --> 00:41:03,321
and if you catch him,
you'll bury him?

495
00:41:03,401 --> 00:41:05,668
Join me if you want.

496
00:41:15,368 --> 00:41:17,002
Okay, it's a deal.

497
00:41:18,468 --> 00:41:21,002
You'll regret this.

498
00:41:25,368 --> 00:41:26,935
A handsome fellow.

499
00:41:28,234 --> 00:41:29,769
How old was he?

500
00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:32,003
About mid-30s.

501
00:41:32,736 --> 00:41:34,969
Rain and darkness
obscured my vision.

502
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:37,969
Keep in touch using this.

503
00:41:41,003 --> 00:41:44,756
A gangster catches
the devil with a cop.

504
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,836
This is freaking good!

505
00:41:57,903 --> 00:42:01,589
A gangster catches
the devil with a cop.

506
00:42:01,669 --> 00:42:04,656
This is freaking good!

507
00:42:04,736 --> 00:42:05,936
Bastard.

508
00:42:06,202 --> 00:42:09,889
You and I are in the same boat.
I gotta have some insurance.

509
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:12,669
It's not like
we can draft a contract.

510
00:42:16,736 --> 00:42:20,769
You went high tech
and recorded me?

511
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:24,736
Damn!

512
00:42:29,569 --> 00:42:32,836
This gangster is trying
to use his brain!

513
00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:38,335
This is why I can't trust
police officers.

514
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:56,837
I've been too lenient with you.

515
00:42:57,637 --> 00:42:58,890
Listen, bastard.

516
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:03,603
When this is over,
I'll lock you up first, you jerk!

517
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:10,422
He stabbed Jang Dong-su, too.

518
00:43:10,503 --> 00:43:14,336
He's behind the Sintanjin case.
What does this mean?

519
00:43:14,904 --> 00:43:18,804
If we go my way,
we can close five cases at once.

520
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,523
Mid-30s, average male height.

521
00:43:23,603 --> 00:43:26,523
Judging from his pattern,
he only kills at night.

522
00:43:26,603 --> 00:43:30,223
Location is not a factor,
and he only uses a knife.

523
00:43:30,303 --> 00:43:31,523
It's one of two things.

524
00:43:31,603 --> 00:43:34,837
Persistence, or always ready.

525
00:43:35,837 --> 00:43:37,837
No other clues so far.

526
00:43:42,837 --> 00:43:44,590
I made a deal with Detective Jung.

527
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:45,857
We'll catch him together.

528
00:43:45,937 --> 00:43:47,523
Obviously,
we won't tell the chief.

529
00:43:47,603 --> 00:43:49,256
How can we trust cops?

530
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:50,937
How can we trust gangsters?

531
00:43:51,203 --> 00:43:52,657
Trust who?

532
00:43:52,737 --> 00:43:54,924
We need manpower
to catch the killer.

533
00:43:55,004 --> 00:43:57,557
This isn't a case
we can handle ourselves.

534
00:43:57,637 --> 00:43:58,924
Let's get the chief involved.

535
00:43:59,004 --> 00:44:00,290
And then what?

536
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:02,290
Major Crimes will barge in,

537
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:05,758
get the media involved,
and get all the glory.

538
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:08,758
That's not all.
The chief is protecting Jang.

539
00:44:08,838 --> 00:44:11,725
This is the only way
to solve this case.

540
00:44:11,805 --> 00:44:14,658
Otherwise, the chief
will be really screwed, too.

541
00:44:14,738 --> 00:44:18,324
Jang has seen the killer's face
and has his car.

542
00:44:18,404 --> 00:44:20,625
But, his sketch alone
isn't good enough.

543
00:44:20,705 --> 00:44:22,725
We need fingerprints and DNA.

544
00:44:22,805 --> 00:44:25,758
We'll use the gangsters
to find the killer,

545
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:27,758
and then we'll move in
to catch him.

546
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,471
I'll use them
and toss them away afterward.

547
00:44:42,705 --> 00:44:44,771
We're tax-paying citizens, too.

548
00:44:45,371 --> 00:44:48,237
Let's get support from the cops
for once.

549
00:44:52,838 --> 00:44:55,758
On the outside, it looks like
a cold, abandoned warehouse,

550
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:58,691
but thousands of arcade cabinets
are built here,

551
00:44:58,771 --> 00:45:00,591
and distributed
all over the country.

552
00:45:00,671 --> 00:45:01,938
Bastards.

553
00:45:10,571 --> 00:45:11,971
We'll get something out of this.

554
00:45:12,237 --> 00:45:15,858
Hopefully his hair, fingerprint,
or even just the smell of him.

555
00:45:15,938 --> 00:45:19,005
No, we gotta absolutely
find something.

556
00:45:19,271 --> 00:45:20,825
We'll comb every inch.

557
00:45:20,905 --> 00:45:22,705
Let's begin.

558
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,492
Let's leave all the grunt work
to Jang,

559
00:45:26,572 --> 00:45:29,592
and we'll go through
all the cases so far.

560
00:45:29,672 --> 00:45:32,492
This is the Sintanjin murder
security cam footage.

561
00:45:32,572 --> 00:45:34,424
His unique pattern is,

562
00:45:34,505 --> 00:45:37,726
he has used a vehicle
in all the murders so far.

563
00:45:37,806 --> 00:45:40,972
He's always on the move,
making him harder to catch.

564
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:44,424
We know of four open cases,
but there has to be more.

565
00:45:44,505 --> 00:45:49,258
Don't forget to look at them
from a serial killer angle.

566
00:45:49,338 --> 00:45:51,325
If you find anything,
report to me.

567
00:45:51,405 --> 00:45:53,392
He's a ticking time bomb.

568
00:45:53,472 --> 00:45:56,792
He could pop up anywhere.
Look into other regional cases.

569
00:45:56,872 --> 00:45:58,726
Try not to look too conspicuous.

570
00:45:58,806 --> 00:45:59,826
Okay?

571
00:45:59,906 --> 00:46:00,972
- Okay!
- Yes, sir.

572
00:46:07,272 --> 00:46:10,006
We'll lock up the gangsters
after the case is over.

573
00:46:10,272 --> 00:46:11,806
Nice and clean.

574
00:46:13,572 --> 00:46:16,772
It's ultimately up to us
to catch the killer.

575
00:46:17,405 --> 00:46:20,238
Before that, let's get rid of Hur.

576
00:47:16,807 --> 00:47:18,473
Son of a...!

577
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:24,627
Are you insane?

578
00:47:24,707 --> 00:47:26,506
What are you doing here?

579
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,425
What the hell do you think?

580
00:47:29,506 --> 00:47:31,673
I was waiting for you.

581
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,793
I think you broke my back.

582
00:47:33,873 --> 00:47:35,760
You shouldn't have
surprised me like that.

583
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,673
I was so startled.

584
00:47:38,573 --> 00:47:39,973
Give me some.

585
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,927
- That feels good.
- Could you look into this?

586
00:47:48,007 --> 00:47:49,259
It's urgent.

587
00:47:49,339 --> 00:47:50,606
What is it?

588
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:52,425
Nothing special.

589
00:47:52,506 --> 00:47:54,593
I found some hairs and blood.

590
00:47:54,673 --> 00:47:55,927
ID them for me.

591
00:47:56,007 --> 00:47:57,339
Jung Tae-seok.

592
00:47:58,807 --> 00:48:01,340
What's with you?
This isn't like you.

593
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,774
What's wrong?

594
00:48:04,641 --> 00:48:06,841
It's a filthy world.

595
00:48:08,008 --> 00:48:09,928
I want to get my hands dirty.

596
00:48:10,008 --> 00:48:11,841
You're right. It is filthy.

597
00:48:27,374 --> 00:48:29,240
He's weird one.

598
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:32,641
He left the weapon for us to see.

599
00:48:33,407 --> 00:48:36,461
"Murder cases and cops
are lost at sea."

600
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:38,908
"Crying over spilled milk."

601
00:48:39,941 --> 00:48:44,307
Now a gang boss is dead.

602
00:48:44,908 --> 00:48:46,841
What will you do?

603
00:48:47,908 --> 00:48:49,294
What should we do?

604
00:48:49,374 --> 00:48:51,861
If you got a mouth, say something!

605
00:48:51,941 --> 00:48:53,874
The Hur case...

606
00:48:54,574 --> 00:48:57,628
is assigned to Unit 2.
They'll investigate it.

607
00:48:57,708 --> 00:48:59,561
What are you doing?

608
00:48:59,641 --> 00:49:02,607
Stop staring at the monitor!

609
00:49:03,207 --> 00:49:04,307
Get out!

610
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:06,808
Right this second!

611
00:49:07,808 --> 00:49:12,507
Do whatever it takes
to help solve these cases!

612
00:49:13,441 --> 00:49:16,294
At least look like
you give a damn!

613
00:49:16,374 --> 00:49:17,594
Walk straight!

614
00:49:17,674 --> 00:49:18,794
Yeah, speak.

615
00:49:18,874 --> 00:49:19,762
Buddy!

616
00:49:19,842 --> 00:49:20,929
Do you wanna die?

617
00:49:21,009 --> 00:49:22,295
What is it?

618
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:23,562
This is nothing special?

619
00:49:23,642 --> 00:49:25,341
I just got the results.

620
00:49:26,241 --> 00:49:27,395
I don't believe this...

621
00:49:27,475 --> 00:49:28,929
What? Tell me quickly.

622
00:49:29,009 --> 00:49:33,829
The DNA of most recent Chungnam
murder victims was detected.

623
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:34,942
Really?

624
00:49:36,742 --> 00:49:38,228
Anyone else's?

625
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,975
Anyone else
other than the known victims?

626
00:49:40,241 --> 00:49:40,662
No.

627
00:49:40,742 --> 00:49:42,629
That doesn't make sense.

628
00:49:42,709 --> 00:49:43,795
Did you do it properly?

629
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:44,895
There was no one else!

630
00:49:44,975 --> 00:49:46,695
But that's not the issue.

631
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,495
Something messed up happened.

632
00:49:48,575 --> 00:49:49,709
Hold on a second.

633
00:49:53,308 --> 00:49:53,895
Go ahead.

634
00:49:53,975 --> 00:49:57,662
The DNA of the truck driver
and the puppy mill owner

635
00:49:57,742 --> 00:50:00,862
were both found on
the Hur murder weapon.

636
00:50:00,942 --> 00:50:01,629
What?

637
00:50:01,709 --> 00:50:03,675
It means one person did them all.

638
00:50:04,308 --> 00:50:08,308
This'll officially be classified
as a serial killer case.

639
00:50:09,308 --> 00:50:10,442
I gotta go.

640
00:50:13,208 --> 00:50:16,208
Jang Dong-su! Was it you?

641
00:50:17,408 --> 00:50:18,809
It was you!

642
00:50:20,942 --> 00:50:22,261
I'll call you back in a bit.

643
00:50:22,341 --> 00:50:23,942
Answer me, you bastard!

644
00:50:27,975 --> 00:50:29,695
Dammit, are you nuts?

645
00:50:29,775 --> 00:50:31,009
Dammit!

646
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:48,576
Your idiot's back.

647
00:50:49,943 --> 00:50:51,843
He thinks this is his home.

648
00:50:52,609 --> 00:50:54,630
Who else? Your minion!

649
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:56,376
Let's talk later.

650
00:50:59,976 --> 00:51:03,543
What's a cop doing
with a gangster?

651
00:51:04,242 --> 00:51:06,743
And you're not a cop?

652
00:51:08,409 --> 00:51:09,242
Huh?

653
00:51:12,609 --> 00:51:14,563
Tell me, you jerk.

654
00:51:14,643 --> 00:51:16,509
Did you kill Hur Sang-do?

655
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,010
Yeah, I killed him.

656
00:51:26,943 --> 00:51:30,743
I am so damn stupid
for trusting this bastard.

657
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:34,810
You trusted me?

658
00:51:35,543 --> 00:51:37,730
A mutt would laugh at that.

659
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:39,696
Nothing's changed.

660
00:51:39,776 --> 00:51:42,396
We'll still catch him together.

661
00:51:42,476 --> 00:51:43,643
Got it?

662
00:51:46,843 --> 00:51:48,409
When...

663
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:51,710
this is all over,

664
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:55,911
I'll investigate you properly.

665
00:51:58,644 --> 00:52:00,477
Whatever, buddy.

666
00:52:04,677 --> 00:52:07,977
The murder cases in the region
since July this year

667
00:52:08,243 --> 00:52:10,597
were found to be the work
of a serial killer...

668
00:52:10,677 --> 00:52:13,497
These cases were handed over
to Major Crimes

669
00:52:13,577 --> 00:52:16,597
in cooperation with
the Cheonan Police,

670
00:52:16,677 --> 00:52:19,944
after the cases remained idle
for a while.

671
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:21,864
The murders were handled

672
00:52:21,944 --> 00:52:23,764
by various regional
police departments,

673
00:52:23,844 --> 00:52:26,343
but by centralizing
the investigation,

674
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:31,931
there's new hope
for finally closing the cases.

675
00:52:32,011 --> 00:52:36,597
I wish this ordeal would wrap up,
so residents can be at peace.

676
00:52:36,677 --> 00:52:39,564
Let's cross to our reporter
at the scene...

677
00:52:39,644 --> 00:52:41,243
You're here early.

678
00:52:41,644 --> 00:52:42,297
Dong-chul.

679
00:52:42,377 --> 00:52:44,564
I'm outside Ace Hotel,
where the murder took place

680
00:52:44,644 --> 00:52:46,797
on September 3rd.

681
00:52:46,877 --> 00:52:51,364
The victim of this crime
is said to be Hur Sang-do,

682
00:52:51,444 --> 00:52:55,263
who led a violent gang
in the Chungnam region.

683
00:52:55,343 --> 00:52:58,931
He was said to be
in a turf war with...

684
00:52:59,011 --> 00:53:02,464
If you had handed over the case
from the beginning,

685
00:53:02,544 --> 00:53:04,731
it wouldn't have come to this.

686
00:53:04,811 --> 00:53:06,911
Murder isn't some child's play.

687
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:11,011
You guys only ruined
the damn investigation.

688
00:53:11,977 --> 00:53:16,430
Nice language in
someone else's house.

689
00:53:16,511 --> 00:53:18,264
- Detective...
- You got a problem?

690
00:53:18,344 --> 00:53:19,665
Am I wrong?

691
00:53:19,745 --> 00:53:21,012
Yeah, man.

692
00:53:21,278 --> 00:53:24,378
I got a problem all right!
You bastard!

693
00:53:24,912 --> 00:53:27,278
Come at me!

694
00:53:27,912 --> 00:53:31,765
- Bastard!
- Hey! Stop!

695
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:36,732
A knife was found at
the scene of Hur's murder,

696
00:53:36,812 --> 00:53:40,765
and the DNA of other victims
was discovered.

697
00:53:40,845 --> 00:53:45,298
A special task force was set up
to investigate not only Hur,

698
00:53:45,378 --> 00:53:47,898
but other victims as well,
as all the murders

699
00:53:47,978 --> 00:53:51,231
are likely committed by
one killer...

700
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,978
That wasn't me...

701
00:53:53,244 --> 00:53:58,845
The task force consists of the
Major Crimes and Homicide units

702
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:04,012
as well as the country's best
serial killer profiler,

703
00:54:04,278 --> 00:54:08,012
in order to conduct
a thorough investigation.

704
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:12,231
They will also have the help of
forensic scientists.

705
00:54:12,311 --> 00:54:16,331
The police are expecting
huge turnout of gangs

706
00:54:16,411 --> 00:54:21,344
for the funeral of Hur,
and they will remain vigilant.

707
00:54:31,945 --> 00:54:34,345
I'm surprised to see you here.

708
00:54:35,813 --> 00:54:38,846
Of course I'm here.
He was my friend.

709
00:55:22,979 --> 00:55:23,733
Hello?

710
00:55:23,813 --> 00:55:24,979
Get over here now!

711
00:55:25,245 --> 00:55:26,866
Why should I?

712
00:55:26,946 --> 00:55:30,479
Clean up your own damn mess!
Get over here!

713
00:55:44,546 --> 00:55:46,279
Who are you?

714
00:55:59,747 --> 00:56:03,980
(Hur was killed with my knife
by someone else)

715
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:07,500
If you want to kill him yourself,
you better find something.

716
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:11,848
If Major Crimes gets him first,
you and I are both screwed.

717
00:57:13,948 --> 00:57:16,581
Is this what your entire life
is like?

718
00:57:17,347 --> 00:57:19,848
I pity your sorry cop ass.

719
00:57:20,514 --> 00:57:22,981
Don't commit any crimes,
you moron.

720
00:57:23,247 --> 00:57:26,015
If people like me weren't around,
you would be out of a job.

721
00:57:26,281 --> 00:57:29,601
That's life. There are predators
and there is prey.

722
00:57:29,681 --> 00:57:32,401
There are stabbing victims.

723
00:57:32,481 --> 00:57:34,901
He attacked me from behind.
I was defenseless.

724
00:57:34,981 --> 00:57:37,434
But I still took his knife
and stabbed him.

725
00:57:37,514 --> 00:57:38,935
Hey, hey, stop!

726
00:57:39,015 --> 00:57:39,935
What is it?

727
00:57:40,015 --> 00:57:41,434
You also stabbed him?

728
00:57:41,514 --> 00:57:42,468
I did, why?

729
00:57:42,548 --> 00:57:44,448
I think I found something.

730
00:57:54,948 --> 00:57:56,347
What the hell?

731
00:57:58,247 --> 00:57:59,781
Bastards.

732
00:58:20,347 --> 00:58:21,715
Jang, what's going on?

733
00:58:22,448 --> 00:58:23,768
Who are these guys?

734
00:58:23,848 --> 00:58:25,381
Worthless bastard.

735
00:59:17,482 --> 00:59:18,682
Move!

736
00:59:44,282 --> 00:59:46,349
Go to hell, you bastard!

737
01:00:33,416 --> 01:00:35,516
Hey, buddy!

738
01:00:39,883 --> 01:00:44,683
Hey, hey! Bastard!

739
01:00:45,917 --> 01:00:47,483
Hey, stop.

740
01:00:47,917 --> 01:00:49,550
It's over. Stop it.

741
01:00:50,316 --> 01:00:52,269
You better go.
I'll wrap it up here.

742
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:54,436
It's... it's okay.

743
01:00:54,516 --> 01:00:57,436
He just bled a lot.

744
01:00:57,516 --> 01:00:58,637
It's just blood...

745
01:00:58,717 --> 01:01:00,850
Get out of here, you bastard!

746
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:20,437
With enough evidence
to arrest Hur's killer,

747
01:01:20,517 --> 01:01:23,938
the police stated that capturing
the suspect is a matter of time.

748
01:01:24,018 --> 01:01:27,337
The suspect's limited methods
of killing

749
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:29,951
and his active area are...

750
01:01:34,584 --> 01:01:37,250
Honey, where are you?

751
01:02:12,851 --> 01:02:16,484
Having a nice nap when we are
having so many problems?

752
01:02:17,751 --> 01:02:19,984
What's with his face?

753
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,684
Wake up, moron!

754
01:02:23,452 --> 01:02:26,285
What have you been up to lately?

755
01:02:27,585 --> 01:02:28,952
What the...

756
01:02:31,251 --> 01:02:32,985
Where are you going?

757
01:02:33,251 --> 01:02:34,605
Here, take this.

758
01:02:34,685 --> 01:02:35,739
It's a kidnapping case.

759
01:02:35,819 --> 01:02:38,505
Soon-ho's already there.
Meet up with him.

760
01:02:38,585 --> 01:02:41,438
A kidnapping case?
Why's that important now?

761
01:02:41,518 --> 01:02:43,472
We got a serial killer to catch.

762
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:44,652
Not that again!

763
01:02:51,251 --> 01:02:53,885
Can't you see Major Crimes
in the office?

764
01:02:54,919 --> 01:02:58,318
They're working with Unit 1,
so take care of this.

765
01:03:01,618 --> 01:03:06,505
I told you this was the work of a
serial killer from the beginning.

766
01:03:06,585 --> 01:03:09,238
Now, Major Crimes and Unit 1
have the case?

767
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:11,639
What the hell do they know?

768
01:03:11,719 --> 01:03:13,985
They're clueless losers!

769
01:03:14,251 --> 01:03:15,939
I've had it!

770
01:03:16,019 --> 01:03:16,939
What did you say?

771
01:03:17,019 --> 01:03:18,585
Shut your face!

772
01:03:21,585 --> 01:03:25,852
You claimed it was a serial killer
without anything to back it up.

773
01:03:26,485 --> 01:03:28,772
Did you bring a piece of evidence
or a witness?

774
01:03:28,852 --> 01:03:32,285
If you were such a hot shot,
why isn't he behind bars?

775
01:03:35,285 --> 01:03:36,719
Dammit...

776
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:48,252
The victim was a prolific
venture capitalist.

777
01:03:52,686 --> 01:03:53,953
Tae-seok!

778
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:59,820
The assailant should be close
to him. Look into it quick.

779
01:04:01,886 --> 01:04:05,673
Are you involved in something
with Jang?

780
01:04:05,753 --> 01:04:07,906
What's with that face?

781
01:04:07,986 --> 01:04:09,853
There is something.

782
01:04:11,319 --> 01:04:13,519
Cut the crap.

783
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:18,352
Ask his colleagues
about his women.

784
01:04:19,286 --> 01:04:21,606
How many times already?

785
01:04:21,686 --> 01:04:24,272
Why do you keep changing
the meeting spot?

786
01:04:24,352 --> 01:04:25,986
Is he even alive?

787
01:04:26,252 --> 01:04:29,753
If you want the money,
put him on the phone!

788
01:04:31,386 --> 01:04:34,686
This is the last time.
Come to the snack bar.

789
01:04:35,319 --> 01:04:36,419
Right this second.

790
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:46,640
What are you doing? Go inside.

791
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,439
Did you come by
to drop off the bag?

792
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:51,519
Leave it with me.

793
01:04:52,986 --> 01:04:56,453
Why is she giving the bag
to that woman?

794
01:04:59,587 --> 01:05:01,387
What the hell?

795
01:05:01,987 --> 01:05:06,387
Why don't you just tell the world
you're here with cops?

796
01:05:13,587 --> 01:05:16,674
Who's that on the roof?

797
01:05:16,754 --> 01:05:18,340
It's him! Roof!

798
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,674
Dong-chul! He's north-bound!

799
01:05:20,754 --> 01:05:21,687
Where is he?

800
01:05:23,554 --> 01:05:25,340
Lure him into the main street!

801
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:27,374
Hey!

802
01:05:27,454 --> 01:05:29,340
What the hell were you doing?

803
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:31,474
Soon-ho, block him from your side!

804
01:05:31,554 --> 01:05:32,687
Stop!

805
01:05:33,887 --> 01:05:35,374
I don't see him!

806
01:05:35,454 --> 01:05:36,807
He's right there!

807
01:05:36,887 --> 01:05:38,374
The main street!

808
01:05:38,454 --> 01:05:40,520
Bae, where the hell are you?

809
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:00,654
I'll head down!

810
01:06:04,287 --> 01:06:05,707
I don't see him here.

811
01:06:05,787 --> 01:06:07,921
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Where did he go?

812
01:06:08,587 --> 01:06:09,907
Catch up!

813
01:06:09,987 --> 01:06:12,554
Up the stairs! Now!

814
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:14,921
Freeze!

815
01:06:17,754 --> 01:06:19,675
He just turned the corner,
block him from the front!

816
01:06:19,755 --> 01:06:21,221
Which way did he go?

817
01:06:23,722 --> 01:06:25,354
Over there! That way!

818
01:06:27,022 --> 01:06:28,421
Go that way!

819
01:06:39,321 --> 01:06:42,888
Why did you take the bag?
You didn't know what was inside.

820
01:06:43,855 --> 01:06:46,842
Why are you shouting at me?
I didn't do anything wrong.

821
01:06:46,922 --> 01:06:49,742
Someone asked me to take it.

822
01:06:49,822 --> 01:06:51,575
Who was it?

823
01:06:51,655 --> 01:06:54,274
Tell us, or you're going to jail!

824
01:06:54,354 --> 01:06:56,022
I've never seen him before!

825
01:06:56,288 --> 01:07:00,521
He ate alone and asked me
to take the bag for him.

826
01:07:01,555 --> 01:07:03,022
He gave me $20.

827
01:07:10,822 --> 01:07:12,241
What did he look like?

828
01:07:12,321 --> 01:07:15,508
He looked normal.

829
01:07:15,588 --> 01:07:17,575
He only ate?

830
01:07:17,655 --> 01:07:20,274
He drank a bottle of Soju too!

831
01:07:20,354 --> 01:07:21,621
The Dew.

832
01:07:23,822 --> 01:07:25,742
Where's the bottle?

833
01:07:25,822 --> 01:07:28,775
Only the labels are different.

834
01:07:28,855 --> 01:07:32,341
All the bottles are the same.

835
01:07:32,421 --> 01:07:34,475
Have fun.

836
01:07:34,555 --> 01:07:35,822
Screw labels...

837
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:42,509
- Dong-chul!
- Yes, sir!

838
01:07:42,589 --> 01:07:43,909
Just the Dew, got it?

839
01:07:43,989 --> 01:07:45,676
- It's not...
- Just the Dew!

840
01:07:45,756 --> 01:07:46,889
I don't believe this!

841
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:49,023
The bottles are the same!

842
01:07:52,456 --> 01:07:54,576
Don't work too hard.

843
01:07:54,656 --> 01:07:55,856
Are you serious?

844
01:07:58,956 --> 01:08:01,522
What about
the steering wheel cover?

845
01:08:02,222 --> 01:08:04,522
The result will come out
today at the earliest.

846
01:08:05,422 --> 01:08:09,656
I'll charge $2,000 per machine.

847
01:08:10,689 --> 01:08:11,442
Thank you.

848
01:08:11,522 --> 01:08:13,676
I'll send tech support
if you need them.

849
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:16,643
Isn't that too cheap, Jang?

850
01:08:16,723 --> 01:08:19,355
If Jang can fulfill his end
of the deal,

851
01:08:19,756 --> 01:08:22,222
we are happy, aren't we?

852
01:08:22,756 --> 01:08:26,956
I don't know if I should take
such a good deal.

853
01:08:27,222 --> 01:08:29,823
Look at how Hur ended up.

854
01:08:30,522 --> 01:08:31,942
Watch out, everyone.

855
01:08:32,023 --> 01:08:34,942
After Jang got stabbed,
Hur got killed.

856
01:08:35,023 --> 01:08:38,576
His lieutenant disappeared, too.

857
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:40,823
Stick with eating your meal.

858
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:07,256
What are you doing here?

859
01:09:08,924 --> 01:09:11,024
Look for this guy first.

860
01:09:12,757 --> 01:09:14,857
We got a weird fingerprint.

861
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:17,710
It's not quite damaged.

862
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:19,777
He could've smudged it.

863
01:09:19,857 --> 01:09:22,343
I found him with
what little print he left behind.

864
01:09:22,423 --> 01:09:23,943
His whereabouts are unknown.

865
01:09:24,024 --> 01:09:27,790
A similar print was found
on the steering wheel cover, too.

866
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:30,610
He hasn't come home
in about three months.

867
01:09:30,690 --> 01:09:31,957
Did he say anything?

868
01:09:32,223 --> 01:09:35,510
When he leaves for a job,
he's away for a month.

869
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:37,577
He's been away
quite a while this time.

870
01:09:37,657 --> 01:09:40,310
I reported just in case.

871
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:41,810
Any problems with him?

872
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:43,510
No, not a single problem.

873
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:45,443
He never misses his rent

874
01:09:45,523 --> 01:09:47,510
and never drinks, either.

875
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:50,276
And he's a faithful Christian.

876
01:09:50,356 --> 01:09:53,290
He lives a clean life.
He's a good man.

877
01:10:01,256 --> 01:10:04,024
'Basis of Mankind'
'Who Raised A Monster?'

878
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:07,024
'Night Darker Than Death'
'Sacred Violence'

879
01:10:23,025 --> 01:10:24,877
We got a weird fingerprint.

880
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:26,958
It's not quite damaged.

881
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:29,291
He could've smudged it...

882
01:11:04,991 --> 01:11:06,991
017-684-2784!

883
01:11:07,257 --> 01:11:09,511
Find everything you can
about its owner!

884
01:11:09,591 --> 01:11:11,478
And do you have the
kidnapper's voice file?

885
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:14,224
Send it to me right away,
right this second!

886
01:11:17,324 --> 01:11:20,578
I heard you paid a ton
for his funeral.

887
01:11:20,658 --> 01:11:24,224
You're one loyal guy.

888
01:11:24,925 --> 01:11:27,691
Do me the same courtesy.

889
01:11:30,791 --> 01:11:33,479
I told you to just eat, didn't I?

890
01:11:33,559 --> 01:11:35,392
So damn yappy.

891
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:39,859
Why are you ruining
this nice lunch?

892
01:11:40,492 --> 01:11:43,992
I'm looking out
for your damn best interests.

893
01:11:45,892 --> 01:11:47,459
Eat your damn words!

894
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:55,525
Please continue.

895
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:58,846
I sent you a photo,
so check it now!

896
01:11:58,926 --> 01:12:00,525
Give this a listen!

897
01:12:02,959 --> 01:12:07,512
This is the last time.
Come to the snack bar.

898
01:12:07,592 --> 01:12:08,892
Right this second.

899
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:11,026
I'm sorry.

900
01:12:11,759 --> 01:12:13,826
The road was slippery.

901
01:12:14,525 --> 01:12:16,592
But I still hit you...

902
01:12:25,659 --> 01:12:28,225
Kang Kyung-ho, 35 years old.

903
01:12:28,792 --> 01:12:31,846
He was abused by his father
and grew up in an orphanage.

904
01:12:31,926 --> 01:12:33,245
He has no prior record.

905
01:12:33,325 --> 01:12:35,912
He calls his 70-year-old mother
every day.

906
01:12:35,992 --> 01:12:37,312
He uses burner phones.

907
01:12:37,392 --> 01:12:40,959
His calls were from Choongchung
until August,

908
01:12:41,225 --> 01:12:44,959
but he was calling from all over
the country afterward.

909
01:12:45,225 --> 01:12:49,746
We traced his calls.
He mainly calls from Ansan,

910
01:12:49,827 --> 01:12:51,680
and mostly from this district.

911
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,513
- Daekyung?
- That's right.

912
01:12:53,593 --> 01:12:54,993
There are a few colleges there,

913
01:12:55,259 --> 01:12:58,313
so there's tons of cheap rooms
and apartments,

914
01:12:58,393 --> 01:13:00,946
and thousands of old houses.

915
01:13:01,027 --> 01:13:03,480
What a hassle...

916
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:05,293
Which means...

917
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,613
he hid here after stabbing Jang.

918
01:13:08,693 --> 01:13:10,313
Bastard.

919
01:13:10,393 --> 01:13:11,647
Where are your manners?

920
01:13:11,727 --> 01:13:12,580
Jang?

921
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:13,847
Is he your friend, you jerk?

922
01:13:13,927 --> 01:13:15,526
You damn gangster.

923
01:13:16,493 --> 01:13:18,946
How are you police any different?

924
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:20,393
Bastard!

925
01:13:20,993 --> 01:13:22,580
Don't you dare!

926
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:24,860
- Damn bastards!
- Let go of me!

927
01:13:28,426 --> 01:13:29,727
You wanna die?

928
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:34,660
Come here.

929
01:13:43,426 --> 01:13:44,526
Buddy.

930
01:13:45,927 --> 01:13:48,027
If we don't catch him,

931
01:13:48,293 --> 01:13:51,259
we're all screwed,
don't you know that?

932
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:56,513
If we're on the same boat,

933
01:13:56,593 --> 01:13:59,626
we gotta see this through
no matter what.

934
01:14:00,993 --> 01:14:02,259
Let's just do it!

935
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,247
- You all got the photo?
- Yes, boss!

936
01:14:28,327 --> 01:14:31,461
You have one mission.

937
01:14:32,427 --> 01:14:35,280
Find this bastard at all costs!

938
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,360
Yes, sir!

939
01:14:37,694 --> 01:14:39,527
Keep a low profile,

940
01:14:39,928 --> 01:14:42,614
and if you see anyone
who resembles him,

941
01:14:42,694 --> 01:14:45,661
call these guys at once.

942
01:14:46,661 --> 01:14:48,781
Five men to a team,

943
01:14:48,861 --> 01:14:52,861
and each team leader reports in
every 8 hours, 3 times a day.

944
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:06,947
Centering around
Daekyung district,

945
01:15:07,028 --> 01:15:10,694
scour your designated area
and expand your search.

946
01:15:11,594 --> 01:15:14,861
Cheap bachelor pads,
motels and inns.

947
01:15:15,728 --> 01:15:17,280
I've never seen him before.

948
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:21,648
Short-term rentals, leased places,
and long-stay apartments.

949
01:15:21,728 --> 01:15:24,260
Check these places without fail!

950
01:15:29,428 --> 01:15:31,482
In the afternoon, check downtown.

951
01:15:31,562 --> 01:15:35,729
Scour the markets, terminals
and other public areas.

952
01:15:43,428 --> 01:15:45,582
Check the bars, arcades,
internet cafés,

953
01:15:45,662 --> 01:15:48,415
karaoke bars
and other shops at night.

954
01:15:48,495 --> 01:15:49,381
Got that?

955
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:50,662
Yes, sir!

956
01:15:58,261 --> 01:16:00,029
Go to the Joongho district!

957
01:16:01,029 --> 01:16:02,595
That place closed down!

958
01:16:13,428 --> 01:16:16,395
Yes, I'm outside. Hurry up.

959
01:16:17,395 --> 01:16:18,361
Okay.

960
01:16:19,261 --> 01:16:20,762
When's the bus coming?

961
01:16:27,628 --> 01:16:29,595
Hey, kiddo. Come over here.

962
01:16:31,729 --> 01:16:33,515
Take this.

963
01:16:33,595 --> 01:16:35,849
- I'm fine.
- Take it!

964
01:16:35,929 --> 01:16:36,915
Okay...

965
01:16:36,995 --> 01:16:38,428
Thank you.

966
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:41,695
What about you?

967
01:16:43,428 --> 01:16:44,996
Study hard.

968
01:16:45,696 --> 01:16:46,916
Hey, Jang Dong-su!

969
01:16:46,996 --> 01:16:49,483
This is no time to have
a group dinner!

970
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:52,449
You gotta feed them
when you give them work.

971
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:53,850
Oh-sung will be here soon.

972
01:16:53,930 --> 01:16:55,529
Where's yours?

973
01:17:00,429 --> 01:17:01,896
What the...?

974
01:17:02,463 --> 01:17:04,449
- You there!
- Yes?

975
01:17:04,529 --> 01:17:08,996
Don't take random things
from strangers!

976
01:17:09,262 --> 01:17:10,282
He's a gangster!

977
01:17:10,362 --> 01:17:12,449
You look more like a gangster
than him.

978
01:17:12,529 --> 01:17:13,496
What?

979
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:15,863
Don't laugh.

980
01:17:17,563 --> 01:17:19,282
- Good bye!
- Be careful!

981
01:17:19,362 --> 01:17:20,796
Thank you, sir.

982
01:17:31,262 --> 01:17:34,783
- Our dicks may be many!
- But we have one heart!

983
01:17:34,863 --> 01:17:38,583
- Until end of time!
- We are one!

984
01:17:38,663 --> 01:17:40,362
Thank you, boss!

985
01:17:45,863 --> 01:17:49,683
My dick's all tingly,
seeing you all.

986
01:17:49,763 --> 01:17:50,816
Screw my life.

987
01:17:50,896 --> 01:17:53,496
I can't believe
I'm in league with you all.

988
01:17:54,362 --> 01:17:56,716
Stick to your own damn job.

989
01:17:56,796 --> 01:18:01,596
We risk our necks for this.
You salarymen don't.

990
01:18:02,429 --> 01:18:05,897
You're still a damn gangster.
Have a damn drink on me.

991
01:18:07,564 --> 01:18:11,031
Just say thank you
when we give you good booze.

992
01:18:11,297 --> 01:18:13,950
I brought in this liquor,
so drink freely.

993
01:18:14,031 --> 01:18:17,330
You've got a finger in the pie
in every type of business.

994
01:18:18,397 --> 01:18:19,564
You want in?

995
01:18:20,897 --> 01:18:21,997
Should I?

996
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:24,464
You should.

997
01:18:24,997 --> 01:18:28,464
You look the part.
You'll go far in the gang!

998
01:18:29,397 --> 01:18:30,851
Shut your face and have a drink.

999
01:18:30,931 --> 01:18:32,897
Fine, pour me one.

1000
01:18:41,764 --> 01:18:42,964
No.

1001
01:18:43,597 --> 01:18:45,597
I didn't turn away.

1002
01:18:46,597 --> 01:18:50,263
There's grease in my glass...

1003
01:18:50,764 --> 01:18:53,484
Dal-ho! Sing us a song,
this mood sucks.

1004
01:18:53,564 --> 01:18:57,784
Dude, I used to be
a boy band trainee.

1005
01:18:57,864 --> 01:19:02,684
I'll sing a kick ass song
for you all.

1006
01:19:02,764 --> 01:19:04,684
One! Two!

1007
01:19:04,764 --> 01:19:06,517
One, two, three, four!

1008
01:19:06,597 --> 01:19:07,784
Hey, be quiet.

1009
01:19:07,864 --> 01:19:09,350
Turn that up.

1010
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:12,883
The high school victim
was on her way home

1011
01:19:12,964 --> 01:19:15,031
when she was murdered.

1012
01:19:15,297 --> 01:19:19,031
Considering how young
she was at the time,

1013
01:19:19,297 --> 01:19:22,884
the police are ruling out
revenge or vendetta,

1014
01:19:22,965 --> 01:19:26,451
and point to sexual assault
or cold-blooded murder

1015
01:19:26,531 --> 01:19:28,418
as potential reasons...

1016
01:19:28,498 --> 01:19:29,752
Oh-sung.

1017
01:19:29,832 --> 01:19:31,852
- Get the hell up!
- Yes, boss!

1018
01:19:31,932 --> 01:19:34,518
Search everything near
the 32 bus route!

1019
01:19:34,598 --> 01:19:35,998
What did we miss?

1020
01:19:36,264 --> 01:19:39,918
Northern Dohwa, Western Worpo,
and 1km from the central square!

1021
01:19:39,998 --> 01:19:40,818
Move faster!

1022
01:19:40,898 --> 01:19:43,318
He's here for sure. Stay alert.

1023
01:19:43,398 --> 01:19:46,351
Come up from Daekyung.
We'll go down from Songgun.

1024
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,032
I'm searching the central square!

1025
01:19:48,298 --> 01:19:50,032
I think I found him.
Dohwa motel district.

1026
01:19:50,298 --> 01:19:52,785
Gather our men.
Search the cars, too.

1027
01:19:52,865 --> 01:19:55,351
Witness found, Dohwa motel!

1028
01:19:55,431 --> 01:19:56,685
Don't just search the motels,

1029
01:19:56,765 --> 01:19:59,652
look into nearby bars
and karaoke places!

1030
01:19:59,732 --> 01:20:01,765
Excuse me, I'm a cop.

1031
01:20:03,865 --> 01:20:05,798
He's staying in Room 304.

1032
01:20:15,865 --> 01:20:16,951
What's with you all?

1033
01:20:17,032 --> 01:20:18,965
Tell me! Where is he?

1034
01:20:19,665 --> 01:20:21,485
He left just now.

1035
01:20:21,565 --> 01:20:22,652
Sir, I found him.

1036
01:20:22,732 --> 01:20:25,351
Stay alert. We have to get him!

1037
01:20:25,431 --> 01:20:28,318
Stay in your car
and see if he comes back.

1038
01:20:28,398 --> 01:20:29,718
Don't take any action.

1039
01:20:29,798 --> 01:20:30,998
We have to get him in here.

1040
01:20:31,264 --> 01:20:32,732
Just do your job, prick!

1041
01:20:34,565 --> 01:20:37,798
Cancel the search party.
Send just three men here.

1042
01:21:33,799 --> 01:21:35,365
Buddy, don't move.

1043
01:22:04,567 --> 01:22:05,800
Get down.

1044
01:22:25,934 --> 01:22:27,467
Glad to see you, bastard.

1045
01:23:22,267 --> 01:23:23,601
Stupid bastard.

1046
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:28,001
He drives like a retard.

1047
01:23:37,434 --> 01:23:38,367
Hey!

1048
01:23:39,267 --> 01:23:40,701
Stop the car, you jerk!

1049
01:23:50,701 --> 01:23:51,801
Stop!

1050
01:23:57,801 --> 01:23:59,035
Stop the car!

1051
01:24:17,035 --> 01:24:18,367
Damn them!

1052
01:24:53,535 --> 01:24:55,268
Bastard!

1053
01:24:55,802 --> 01:24:57,602
What are you doing?

1054
01:25:00,036 --> 01:25:02,036
I'm trying to get him!

1055
01:25:03,036 --> 01:25:04,722
Over there!

1056
01:25:04,802 --> 01:25:06,736
Bastard!

1057
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:08,969
Damn it...

1058
01:26:06,737 --> 01:26:08,870
Hey! Oh-sung!

1059
01:26:10,003 --> 01:26:11,523
Oh-sung, no!

1060
01:26:11,603 --> 01:26:13,803
Wake up!

1061
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:18,037
Over there...

1062
01:26:21,336 --> 01:26:22,703
Damn it...

1063
01:27:07,436 --> 01:27:10,870
Don't forget you're a superstar.

1064
01:27:12,004 --> 01:27:16,771
Remember, you're a superstar.

1065
01:27:24,604 --> 01:27:26,537
Open your heart...

1066
01:28:11,038 --> 01:28:12,557
Where are you?

1067
01:28:12,637 --> 01:28:14,004
This bastard is mine now.

1068
01:28:14,270 --> 01:28:15,904
Where the hell are you?

1069
01:28:23,437 --> 01:28:25,290
Track his location!

1070
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:27,838
He took the killer. Find him!

1071
01:28:34,305 --> 01:28:35,625
Fasten your seat belt.

1072
01:28:35,705 --> 01:28:37,972
You can't die before I kill you.

1073
01:28:38,805 --> 01:28:41,472
- Stop at a rest stop.
- What?

1074
01:28:42,705 --> 01:28:44,472
I'm starving.

1075
01:29:06,438 --> 01:29:08,005
This is fun.

1076
01:29:08,271 --> 01:29:10,271
How are we different?

1077
01:29:13,772 --> 01:29:16,705
That's pretty obvious,
can't you tell?

1078
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:23,039
How dare you stab me,
you puny bastard?

1079
01:29:34,939 --> 01:29:35,972
Isn't it fun?

1080
01:29:36,538 --> 01:29:39,371
Playing with a man's life.

1081
01:29:44,338 --> 01:29:46,891
He drove down to Cheonan.

1082
01:29:46,972 --> 01:29:48,358
The toll gate camera caught him.

1083
01:29:48,438 --> 01:29:50,272
Bastard...

1084
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:55,006
Do you know when it feels...

1085
01:29:55,272 --> 01:29:58,359
the best when you kill someone?

1086
01:29:58,439 --> 01:30:00,740
Shut the hell up.

1087
01:30:05,639 --> 01:30:07,539
Do you like minced meat?

1088
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:11,773
I'm gonna chop you up nicely,

1089
01:30:12,773 --> 01:30:15,459
and distribute it all over.

1090
01:30:15,539 --> 01:30:17,040
Bastard.

1091
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:20,372
It's this moment,

1092
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:25,359
when life and death
is in your hand.

1093
01:30:25,439 --> 01:30:26,940
Give it a go.

1094
01:30:28,006 --> 01:30:29,793
Get on with it.

1095
01:30:29,873 --> 01:30:31,673
Kill me!

1096
01:30:33,773 --> 01:30:36,806
Do you even listen to yourself?

1097
01:30:38,372 --> 01:30:41,793
Did you think you'd live
after killing all those people?

1098
01:30:41,873 --> 01:30:44,439
That's why you should kill me.

1099
01:30:46,272 --> 01:30:49,940
Die quietly. If you talk,
your blood will squirt.

1100
01:31:31,474 --> 01:31:33,007
Sorry, buddy.

1101
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:37,407
I'm still a cop.

1102
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,574
Nice to meet you, you bastard.

1103
01:32:02,607 --> 01:32:07,607
Kang Kyung-ho,
you're under arrest for homicide.

1104
01:32:12,941 --> 01:32:15,440
Even a devil like you...

1105
01:32:16,307 --> 01:32:18,827
can retain an attorney,

1106
01:32:18,907 --> 01:32:22,340
and has the right
to remain silent.

1107
01:32:22,774 --> 01:32:25,808
Anything you say can be...

1108
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:29,675
used against you
in a court of law.

1109
01:32:31,274 --> 01:32:33,762
If you cannot afford an attorney,

1110
01:32:33,842 --> 01:32:39,441
one will be appointed to you
with tax money, bastard.

1111
01:32:55,308 --> 01:32:56,595
What the hell?

1112
01:32:56,675 --> 01:32:58,042
Isn't it obvious?

1113
01:32:58,675 --> 01:33:00,862
He's a serial killer.

1114
01:33:00,942 --> 01:33:02,042
Sir.

1115
01:33:04,575 --> 01:33:05,928
What are you doing?

1116
01:33:06,008 --> 01:33:07,528
Go home!

1117
01:33:07,608 --> 01:33:09,241
Pack up!

1118
01:33:10,775 --> 01:33:12,475
Come here, baby.

1119
01:33:13,942 --> 01:33:15,961
One moment please! Make way!

1120
01:33:16,042 --> 01:33:17,961
Let us through! Make way!

1121
01:33:18,042 --> 01:33:22,008
While investigating a kidnapping
case from September,

1122
01:33:22,274 --> 01:33:26,961
Cheonan police obtained
key evidence that led to Kang.

1123
01:33:27,042 --> 01:33:30,428
He's currently being treated
for minor injuries,

1124
01:33:30,508 --> 01:33:32,361
and he'll be investigated
by the police

1125
01:33:32,441 --> 01:33:36,042
before being handed over
to the prosecutor.

1126
01:33:36,308 --> 01:33:37,328
Next up.

1127
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:41,628
Slot arcades are becoming
a societal problem as of late,

1128
01:33:41,708 --> 01:33:46,729
and the prosecution traced how
these arcades are funding

1129
01:33:46,809 --> 01:33:51,462
violent gangs, and is in search of
Zeus gang leader Jang.

1130
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:55,009
Jang operates several dozen
slot arcades,

1131
01:33:55,275 --> 01:33:58,863
and has made a fortune
by illegally modifying

1132
01:33:58,943 --> 01:34:01,462
and distributing arcade cabinets.

1133
01:34:01,542 --> 01:34:05,309
His current whereabouts
is unknown.

1134
01:34:08,043 --> 01:34:10,375
You did everything, right?

1135
01:34:10,976 --> 01:34:12,295
No.

1136
01:34:12,375 --> 01:34:15,962
You've convinced the world
that he's the killer, but what?

1137
01:34:16,043 --> 01:34:16,895
No evidence?

1138
01:34:16,976 --> 01:34:19,876
All we've got is circumstantial.

1139
01:34:20,609 --> 01:34:22,496
There's no concrete proof
that he killed them.

1140
01:34:22,576 --> 01:34:23,962
Even if I was a judge,

1141
01:34:24,043 --> 01:34:27,442
I wouldn't give him
the death penalty.

1142
01:34:30,609 --> 01:34:31,729
What's this?

1143
01:34:31,809 --> 01:34:32,863
It's a knife.

1144
01:34:32,943 --> 01:34:36,743
The knife that you killed with.

1145
01:34:38,943 --> 01:34:41,362
What's your life concept?

1146
01:34:41,442 --> 01:34:44,943
No matter how I think of it,
I can't figure you out, why?

1147
01:34:45,943 --> 01:34:47,763
Because you're not human.

1148
01:34:47,843 --> 01:34:49,843
Then what's yours?

1149
01:34:51,709 --> 01:34:54,776
To be a good cop? A model citizen?

1150
01:34:56,043 --> 01:34:57,976
You can't answer me.

1151
01:34:58,242 --> 01:35:00,976
Who has a life concept?

1152
01:35:01,843 --> 01:35:05,044
We live because we do.

1153
01:35:07,877 --> 01:35:09,864
I wore gloves for my first kill,

1154
01:35:09,944 --> 01:35:12,977
but they kept slipping
and wouldn't move like I wanted.

1155
01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:15,977
You gotta stab in one go!

1156
01:35:17,343 --> 01:35:19,276
That feeling when it goes in...

1157
01:35:19,710 --> 01:35:22,010
You can feel it
from the tips of your fingers.

1158
01:35:22,977 --> 01:35:25,543
Something like that.

1159
01:35:26,643 --> 01:35:28,543
And these pictures.

1160
01:35:39,910 --> 01:35:41,630
What is it?

1161
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:44,243
The order's all wrong.

1162
01:35:46,543 --> 01:35:49,610
Is there proof that it's mine?

1163
01:35:51,543 --> 01:35:55,410
And even if I get
the death penalty,

1164
01:35:56,610 --> 01:35:58,797
you know I won't die.

1165
01:35:58,877 --> 01:36:00,376
What the...

1166
01:36:00,777 --> 01:36:06,310
I'll kill you! Allow me!

1167
01:36:10,944 --> 01:36:15,276
If you receive the death penalty
without evidence,

1168
01:36:16,510 --> 01:36:18,597
then that's murder.

1169
01:36:18,677 --> 01:36:23,511
The real devils are those who
commit crimes with kind faces.

1170
01:36:24,277 --> 01:36:27,464
Think about it,
as creators and enforcers of law.

1171
01:36:27,544 --> 01:36:30,531
Do you really have that right?

1172
01:36:30,611 --> 01:36:36,277
If you're innocent, then I am too.

1173
01:36:46,244 --> 01:36:48,878
Did you state that
you've never seen this knife?

1174
01:36:50,478 --> 01:36:51,531
I did.

1175
01:36:51,611 --> 01:36:54,897
This knife was used
to kill five victims

1176
01:36:54,978 --> 01:36:57,765
between July and September, 2005.

1177
01:36:57,845 --> 01:36:59,464
Objection, Your Honor.

1178
01:36:59,544 --> 01:37:01,798
The state has not provided

1179
01:37:01,878 --> 01:37:04,297
any concrete link
between the knife and him

1180
01:37:04,377 --> 01:37:05,665
during this trial.

1181
01:37:05,745 --> 01:37:08,297
It cannot be implied that
the knife belonged to him.

1182
01:37:08,377 --> 01:37:09,678
Yes, you're right.

1183
01:37:10,644 --> 01:37:13,698
This knife has nothing to do with
the defendant.

1184
01:37:13,778 --> 01:37:15,377
At least until now.

1185
01:37:16,045 --> 01:37:20,698
Your Honor, we'd like to request
a sole survivor

1186
01:37:20,778 --> 01:37:26,464
of Kang's vicious knife attack
as the state's next witness.

1187
01:37:26,544 --> 01:37:28,978
Witness, please take the stand.

1188
01:37:55,445 --> 01:37:57,866
You got balls
showing your face in front of me.

1189
01:37:57,946 --> 01:37:59,979
Damn, you look terrible.

1190
01:38:04,245 --> 01:38:08,298
We're paying tax for you to arrest
and kill those bastards.

1191
01:38:08,378 --> 01:38:11,278
That's what the law is.

1192
01:38:11,746 --> 01:38:14,465
It arrests people
and punishes them, too,

1193
01:38:14,545 --> 01:38:17,699
and it protects us, dammit,
that's what it is for.

1194
01:38:17,779 --> 01:38:21,512
Shut the hell up.
You should've let me kill him!

1195
01:38:25,245 --> 01:38:27,979
You're my last resort.

1196
01:38:28,612 --> 01:38:32,345
Let's kill him with law.

1197
01:38:34,412 --> 01:38:36,445
What the hell are you saying?

1198
01:38:44,046 --> 01:38:45,465
Turn yourself in.

1199
01:38:45,545 --> 01:38:48,378
Are you out of your damn mind?

1200
01:38:51,912 --> 01:38:53,465
Did you kill Hur Sang-do?

1201
01:38:53,545 --> 01:38:54,879
Yes, I did.

1202
01:38:56,445 --> 01:38:57,046
Yes, I did.

1203
01:38:57,312 --> 01:38:58,580
I've had it!

1204
01:38:59,780 --> 01:39:03,566
Once this goes public,
you and I are both dead.

1205
01:39:03,646 --> 01:39:06,433
Don't make me use this.

1206
01:39:06,513 --> 01:39:09,633
Surrender and become a witness.

1207
01:39:09,713 --> 01:39:11,433
You're the only witness.

1208
01:39:11,513 --> 01:39:16,279
With you on the witness stand,
I can link him to all his murders!

1209
01:39:16,747 --> 01:39:20,047
Let's just die together.

1210
01:39:21,613 --> 01:39:25,299
I swear that the evidence
that I shall give is the truth,

1211
01:39:25,379 --> 01:39:29,047
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help me God.

1212
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:33,966
Your Honor.

1213
01:39:34,047 --> 01:39:38,366
The state's witness is
a wanted head of a gang,

1214
01:39:38,446 --> 01:39:41,366
who is accused of
several serious crimes.

1215
01:39:41,446 --> 01:39:43,767
There is no link between
his role as a witness,

1216
01:39:43,847 --> 01:39:46,833
and as a suspect of other crimes.

1217
01:39:46,913 --> 01:39:48,566
I agree.

1218
01:39:48,646 --> 01:39:49,800
Witness,

1219
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:54,680
how can you verify that you
were stabbed by the defendant?

1220
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:05,480
Guys like me who get
stabbed regularly

1221
01:40:06,279 --> 01:40:09,546
can't forget those who stab us
until they are buried.

1222
01:40:10,947 --> 01:40:13,346
That bastard was the one.

1223
01:40:14,379 --> 01:40:21,647
I had this sketch made
as soon as I got stabbed.

1224
01:40:24,781 --> 01:40:29,668
Your Honor, that portrait is
simply a personal drawing,

1225
01:40:29,748 --> 01:40:33,868
it has no substantial
or scientific merit as evidence.

1226
01:40:33,948 --> 01:40:35,367
Your Honor,

1227
01:40:35,447 --> 01:40:39,701
this is the witness'
hospital record

1228
01:40:39,781 --> 01:40:42,300
immediately after the attack.

1229
01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:43,967
The witness is a gang boss.

1230
01:40:44,048 --> 01:40:46,868
Getting stabbed is normal for him.

1231
01:40:46,948 --> 01:40:50,868
He could've been treated
for someone else's stabbing.

1232
01:40:50,948 --> 01:40:53,048
He's violating
the defendant's rights

1233
01:40:53,314 --> 01:40:54,967
and the law's authority.

1234
01:40:55,048 --> 01:40:57,380
Damn, that bastard talks a lot.

1235
01:40:57,848 --> 01:40:59,547
- Hey, Lawyer.
- Witness!

1236
01:40:59,881 --> 01:41:01,801
If your family had been killed
the same way,

1237
01:41:01,881 --> 01:41:03,801
could you talk like that?

1238
01:41:03,881 --> 01:41:05,501
The defendant's rights?

1239
01:41:05,581 --> 01:41:07,334
Why does he deserve any?

1240
01:41:07,414 --> 01:41:11,400
That bastard killed people
for fun.

1241
01:41:11,481 --> 01:41:15,534
I'm a bad guy too,
but he shouldn't be alive.

1242
01:41:15,614 --> 01:41:16,881
Evidence?

1243
01:41:17,781 --> 01:41:19,380
I'll show you.

1244
01:41:29,914 --> 01:41:34,568
That night, he forced me out
of my car by crashing into me.

1245
01:41:34,648 --> 01:41:38,368
Then he stabbed me
twice in my side,

1246
01:41:38,448 --> 01:41:41,049
and after some struggle,
he stabbed me in the chest.

1247
01:41:41,315 --> 01:41:45,882
While trying to take his knife,
I got cuts in my fingers.

1248
01:41:47,415 --> 01:41:50,381
If I was a normal man,
I'd be dead too.

1249
01:41:51,615 --> 01:41:53,802
Take his clothes off.

1250
01:41:53,882 --> 01:41:55,535
I stabbed his left chest.

1251
01:41:55,615 --> 01:41:57,915
He will have a wound there.

1252
01:42:04,815 --> 01:42:08,268
And check his hand.
You'll find a lot of scars.

1253
01:42:08,348 --> 01:42:11,502
Those who use knives
get minor cuts during stabbing,

1254
01:42:11,582 --> 01:42:13,982
and break their nails, too.

1255
01:42:15,315 --> 01:42:16,915
And lastly,

1256
01:42:20,482 --> 01:42:22,548
that bastard wrote this.

1257
01:42:24,582 --> 01:42:27,515
Analyze his handwriting,
and you'll get a match.

1258
01:42:27,949 --> 01:42:30,335
For reference,
Hur Sang-do was my friend.

1259
01:42:30,415 --> 01:42:32,949
(Hur was killed with my knife)

1260
01:42:33,949 --> 01:42:36,935
Hur and his lieutenant
are both dead.

1261
01:42:37,015 --> 01:42:39,502
I feel bad for Oh-sung,

1262
01:42:39,582 --> 01:42:41,635
but if Kang spills everything,

1263
01:42:41,715 --> 01:42:44,448
we can blame Oh-sung for it.

1264
01:42:49,882 --> 01:42:52,535
(Hur was killed with my knife)

1265
01:42:52,616 --> 01:42:57,382
Considering the defendant's
extremely violent tendencies,

1266
01:42:57,950 --> 01:43:01,870
willful negligence of human life,

1267
01:43:01,950 --> 01:43:04,636
and the pain felt by the victims,

1268
01:43:04,716 --> 01:43:11,469
his sentence is decided
by weighing the offenses.

1269
01:43:11,549 --> 01:43:14,883
Ergo, defendant Kang Kyung-ho

1270
01:43:16,783 --> 01:43:18,716
is sentenced to death.

(61st Police Appreciation Day)

1272

Good afternoon, boss!

1276
01:44:57,385 --> 01:44:58,737
I got a condition.

1277
01:44:58,817 --> 01:45:00,567
What is it?

1278
01:45:00,646 --> 01:45:03,941
Put me in the same jail as him.

1279
01:45:29,631 --> 01:45:32,245
We played this game
with the lives of three men.

1280
01:45:32,325 --> 01:45:34,163
We need to finish it.
