1
00:01:22,172 --> 00:01:23,855
They say that this story begins in Japan.

2
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,172
Where the sun rises first on the earth.

3
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:32,088
This is a rich Japanese wedding...

4
00:01:32,588 --> 00:01:36,547
It's a custom here for groom
to gift something to bride.

5
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:41,963
This is not about Japanese
wedding or their customs.

6
00:01:42,672 --> 00:01:45,547
Do you see that violin? It is about this.

7
00:02:01,172 --> 00:02:03,463
It's costs is eight lakhs...

8
00:02:03,713 --> 00:02:06,922
The reason,
because it's made some kind of wood.

9
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,588
You will not find this wood
anywhere around here.

10
00:02:24,172 --> 00:02:27,130
But, it must be smuggled from China by sea.

11
00:02:28,963 --> 00:02:31,630
That wood was transported by this ship.

12
00:02:38,088 --> 00:02:41,172
It came from Chennai
traveling thousands of miles.

13
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,713
They were loaded onto
ships by these lorries.

14
00:03:02,255 --> 00:03:05,547
The place in the world where
we can find red sandalwood...

15
00:03:06,047 --> 00:03:09,005
Seshachalam forest, Rayalaseema.

16
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:14,463
Surprisingly this plant doesn't grow
anywhere else than here on the earth.

17
00:03:18,588 --> 00:03:22,713
This is the gold growing on earth,
it's name is red sandalwood.

18
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,297
You are escaping right in
front of police... Who are you?

19
00:04:18,588 --> 00:04:21,005
Get down.. Get down.

20
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:45,838
We have met after long time.
How are you?

21
00:04:47,463 --> 00:04:48,838
Hope you are doing good.

22
00:04:50,547 --> 00:04:51,713
That's OK.

23
00:04:52,463 --> 00:04:54,213
Why trouble between us.

24
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:57,672
I will give you Ten thousand.
Will you leave me?

25
00:04:58,213 --> 00:04:59,338
Ten Thousand.

26
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:04,630
Bribe? Are you trying to bribe
Tamilnadu Police Is It?

27
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:09,130
Sir, you will give Ten Thousand Sir.

28
00:05:18,422 --> 00:05:19,422
Twenty Thousand!

29
00:05:32,463 --> 00:05:33,463
Thirty thousand!

30
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,797
Forty thousand!

31
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:04,922
Fifty thousand!

32
00:06:24,838 --> 00:06:25,922
One Lakh!

33
00:06:31,963 --> 00:06:36,755
What I'm saying is one lakh per head.

34
00:06:37,255 --> 00:06:40,672
What I'm saying is one lakh per head.

35
00:06:55,713 --> 00:07:02,380
You are a thief when Police vehicle is behind
us. If the same vehicle is before you are a King.

36
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,922
You know how was Pushpa earlier,
who did rob like a King?

37
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:14,297
Brother... Are you Tamil?

38
00:07:14,797 --> 00:07:15,963
What is your name?

39
00:07:17,255 --> 00:07:18,422
Pushpa!

40
00:07:20,255 --> 00:07:21,588
Hardcore Kannada.

41
00:07:36,547 --> 00:07:38,963
Everyone's story starts with his birth.

42
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:42,963
But my story has begin after I met him.

43
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:47,422
Don't stay there gossiping
while you go and have tea.

44
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,422
Come fast. We have lots of work. OK?

45
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:14,005
Who is this? Is he your Son in law..
Sitting as if he owns the place.

46
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,421
My Name is Kesava... this is
the first time I've met Pushpa.

47
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:22,172
Who is that? Sitting cross legged?

48
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,755
Hey... what is this?

49
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,837
How can you sit cross legged,
when owner is asking...?

50
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:29,130
Don't you have manners?

51
00:08:30,963 --> 00:08:31,963
What?

52
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:37,588
This leg is mine and this leg is mine..
And I kept my leg on my leg.

53
00:08:37,713 --> 00:08:39,422
Did I put my leg on the owner or what?

54
00:08:40,797 --> 00:08:43,047
Does he want me to
work or give him respect?

55
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:45,797
You must change your
behavior if you want to work here.

56
00:08:46,088 --> 00:08:47,713
You cant behave as you want.

57
00:08:47,922 --> 00:08:49,005
Is it so?

58
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:52,755
It's Not possible to change my behavior
so how about changing the owner.

59
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:55,255
Give me my wages

60
00:08:55,547 --> 00:08:56,672
I will leave.

61
00:09:01,005 --> 00:09:02,672
This is enough for what I have done.

62
00:09:03,213 --> 00:09:08,630
Give this to your owner and ask him to go
and buy manners in the market if he can get.

63
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:11,963
Take this.

64
00:09:14,463 --> 00:09:18,880
This fellow will either rule
the world or go to dogs.

65
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:22,588
Hey... Where are you going?

66
00:09:23,922 --> 00:09:25,463
I'm also changing the owner.

67
00:09:25,547 --> 00:09:29,088
I want to see what he becomes.
- Where are you going?

68
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,962
Didn't I tell you Reddappa
that I will pay back next month?

69
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:53,546
You are postponing every month saying next month.
How many times should I come to your house?

70
00:09:53,547 --> 00:09:56,047
Shameless people... Shameless people.

71
00:09:56,297 --> 00:09:58,880
Reddappa. Don't shout.
The whole Village is listening.

72
00:09:58,963 --> 00:10:01,773
I am shouting so that everyone can listen. At
least then they will feel ashamed and repay.

73
00:10:01,797 --> 00:10:04,171
She is a widow. Is that
the way to talk to her.

74
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:05,130
Widow? So what?

75
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:06,546
She has a son as grown
as a buffalo at home.. Right.

76
00:10:06,547 --> 00:10:08,630
Isn't he a man? Doesn't
he have hands and legs?

77
00:10:08,672 --> 00:10:12,796
No Reddappa, My boy has joined for work in the mill.
He will pay whatever he earns month after month to you.

78
00:10:12,797 --> 00:10:13,837
What will he repay?

79
00:10:13,838 --> 00:10:16,838
Everyone in the village know that
your son has left the work long time back.

80
00:10:18,255 --> 00:10:20,797
What is this son? Is
Reddappa telling the truth?

81
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:24,088
Have you really left work at the mill?
How will we survive without work.

82
00:10:24,422 --> 00:10:25,922
I am asking you.

83
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,504
Listen Parvatamma. Forget this.
I will come tomorrow morning.

84
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:32,754
I want you to reapy every penny, If not, this time
I will not shout standing in front of your house...

85
00:10:32,755 --> 00:10:35,004
will do it from your roof top I
will shout in front of everyone.

86
00:10:35,005 --> 00:10:37,838
Drink... Neither son is
listening nor the buffalo.

87
00:10:44,297 --> 00:10:47,254
Principle Three thousand and
Interest Three thousand six hundred.

88
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:48,963
Total Six thousand six hundred.

89
00:10:49,005 --> 00:10:50,171
The account is settled. Bye.

90
00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:53,254
Glad that your account is settled.
How about mine?

91
00:10:53,255 --> 00:10:54,588
Account? What account?

92
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:57,922
Entire village got to know that
we have took a loan from you.

93
00:10:58,505 --> 00:11:00,254
Now, Shouldn't all of them
know that we have repaid?

94
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:01,505
Isn't it simple?

95
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:04,296
Hello Gundappa,
Venkatesha Pushpa has repaid his loan.

96
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:06,130
OK I take leave now.

97
00:11:06,672 --> 00:11:09,212
Yesterday there were so
many people at the Ration Shop.

98
00:11:09,213 --> 00:11:10,672
Who will tell all of them?

99
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:12,171
What do you say now?

100
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,292
Hey, get me the list of Who
all were there yesterday?

101
00:11:14,338 --> 00:11:16,547
A total of 120 people were there.

102
00:11:16,672 --> 00:11:17,796
Maranna Ravi.

103
00:11:17,797 --> 00:11:19,047
Chalapathi.

104
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:20,213
Gowramma!

105
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,047
Hey.. Stop.

106
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:22,981
Do you expecting me to
inform all of them now?

107
00:11:23,005 --> 00:11:24,213
I won't.

108
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:30,172
Venkata Ramana!

109
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:33,254
Listen Venkata Ramana...
Pushpa has repaid his entire loan.

110
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:35,087
Has he repaid?
- Yes. He has repaid the entire loan.

111
00:11:35,088 --> 00:11:37,504
Bagepalli Subbalakshmi, Batla Halli...

112
00:11:37,505 --> 00:11:40,254
Pushpa has repaid his entire loan.

113
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:43,630
Pushpa... Inform Venkata lachamma also.
She is leaving for Dubai in the evening.

114
00:11:46,755 --> 00:11:50,005
Thousand rupees work...
Thousand rupees work.

115
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:52,338
Come fast.. Thousand rupees work.

116
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,020
What is this hundred-rupees work?
And what is thousand rupees work?

117
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,630
This is legal, so Hundred rupees only.

118
00:11:56,713 --> 00:11:59,337
That is illegal. More
money and more risk...

119
00:11:59,338 --> 00:12:00,712
Thousand rupees work...
Thousand rupees work.

120
00:12:00,713 --> 00:12:02,213
Come fast.. Thousand rupees work.

121
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,713
Come fast.. Thousand rupees work.

122
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:14,462
Hey... why are you going that side? If we go that side,
there is no surety that we will come back home by evening.

123
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:18,171
I don't have much work in the
evening anyway. So I'm going.

124
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:22,088
Get on to the vehicle... come on...

125
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,172
Hey... Please inform in our homes
that we went for thousand rupees wok.

126
00:12:49,005 --> 00:12:50,755
Hey, get down quickly.

127
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,672
Move on... move on...

128
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,130
Move!

129
00:12:57,005 --> 00:12:58,213
Move... move...

130
00:12:58,838 --> 00:12:59,838
Get down!

131
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:05,713
To hell with this rain!
Get going.

132
00:13:12,213 --> 00:13:14,671
Bro, Is this your first time?
- Yeah bro.

133
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:15,547
What's your name?

134
00:13:15,588 --> 00:13:17,255
Can they pay us after the work is done?

135
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,963
If the rain continues like this We will
take 10 days to reach our destination.

136
00:13:22,713 --> 00:13:25,088
Be careful.
Water is flowing with force.

137
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:18,172
Run.. Run... police are here...
Come on run.

138
00:14:21,713 --> 00:14:23,088
Where are you all going?

139
00:14:24,088 --> 00:14:28,797
We put in so much effort to flick this, and you
want to hand over it to the police just like that?

140
00:14:29,213 --> 00:14:32,047
I have an idea.
Come here, I will tell you.

141
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:40,462
DSP Govindappa!
Task force officer.

142
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,838
He's nightmare for Red sandal smugglers.

143
00:14:43,005 --> 00:14:46,338
After he took charge, coolies realised
that life is more important than money.

144
00:14:46,505 --> 00:14:51,088
If anyone has to cut the trees or smuggle the goods
out of the forest it can be only after he takes a nap.

145
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:01,755
Ey.. What are you people doing here?

146
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,047
We came to graze the sheep... sheep.

147
00:15:05,213 --> 00:15:06,297
Where are the sheep then?

148
00:15:06,713 --> 00:15:09,422
Sheep have gone into the forest to graze...

149
00:15:10,838 --> 00:15:12,297
How many sheep are you grazing?

150
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:15,130
How many sheep do we have?

151
00:15:15,922 --> 00:15:17,088
Around two hundred I guess.

152
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,672
We will have two hundred sir.

153
00:15:20,213 --> 00:15:23,255
What work does Shepherds have with the axe?

154
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:29,713
They came to graze the sheep
and I came to kill the tiger if it comes...

155
00:15:31,255 --> 00:15:34,338
Hey... Is this the way to speak to DSP sir?

156
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:35,588
Don't you have manners??

157
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:39,588
Of course, we have,
that's why we hid the logs.

158
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:43,183
Otherwise, we would have moved them out
of the forest in front of you.

159
00:15:44,672 --> 00:15:46,713
Then your dignity would have gone sure.

160
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,588
What are you looking man?

161
00:15:51,255 --> 00:15:53,172
Tiger is caught. Let's wrap it up and go.

162
00:15:53,797 --> 00:15:56,297
Don't act smart? Where are goods?

163
00:15:57,505 --> 00:15:58,505
Where are goods?

164
00:15:59,588 --> 00:16:02,130
I thought you are a man
who came to catch the goods.

165
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,955
Or but looks like you came
to catch what ever you find?

166
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:17,547
Hello Sir.

167
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,297
You have just 6 bullets.

168
00:16:21,088 --> 00:16:24,130
I have sixty axes around me.

169
00:16:25,255 --> 00:16:27,255
It is not matching sir.

170
00:16:27,838 --> 00:16:30,838
Sir, Look at their faces. They
are all looking like rouges.

171
00:16:31,255 --> 00:16:32,535
Not now.
We will come back again.

172
00:16:32,588 --> 00:16:35,088
He is saying good words Sir.

173
00:16:35,338 --> 00:16:37,418
If you listen to him,
it will be good for all of us.

174
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:43,087
They are strong only when they are
in the forest.. Where can they go, sir.

175
00:16:43,088 --> 00:16:45,128
Let's go sir...
we will nab them when they come out.

176
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:52,587
They might bring the hidden
goods out in our presence itself.

177
00:16:52,588 --> 00:16:54,028
We lose our respect... let's go sir.

178
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:54,172
Leaf lives on Sunlight to grow.

179
00:17:54,672 --> 00:17:58,547
The Goat eats away leaves to be alive.

180
00:17:59,005 --> 00:18:02,963
And a tiger hunts goat to survive.

181
00:18:03,422 --> 00:18:05,088
Isn't it the power of Hunger?

182
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,297
Isn't it the power of Hunger?

183
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:16,005
The tiger perishes in death
the death dissolves in time.

184
00:18:16,505 --> 00:18:20,547
And the time surrenders before Kali
This is a great hunger.

185
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:28,963
The hunted knows it should run faster And
the hunter knows he should outrun his prey.

186
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:34,047
If the hunted wins, it will live another day
And the hunter knows, it should win to survive.

187
00:18:34,755 --> 00:18:40,755
Life for one
May mean death for another.

188
00:18:41,297 --> 00:18:45,755
Goat has to find a place to hide if it doesn't
want to be the next lunch of the tiger.

189
00:19:12,172 --> 00:19:16,088
A Worm is a bait to catch fish
Grains are used to trap the bird.

190
00:19:16,463 --> 00:19:20,838
A piece of Meat can lure the dog into danger
Survival is the hook for human beings.

191
00:19:25,172 --> 00:19:29,422
In the festival to please a god
Chicken and sheep gets killed.

192
00:19:29,672 --> 00:19:33,922
The knife gets smeared with blood And
even a goddess can't escape from a bait.

193
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,130
This is the fate of the world.

194
00:19:40,505 --> 00:19:48,505
If you are not alert, the bait will catch you You can
only survive if you have a hunger to gobble the bait.

195
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:57,255
A hungry man can't see right or wrong
Only the fittest will survive here.

196
00:19:58,755 --> 00:20:03,297
Goat has to find a place to hide if it doesn't
want to be the next lunch of the tiger.

197
00:20:44,297 --> 00:20:46,047
Take what I paid and leave.

198
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,380
Brother. I will be with you.

199
00:20:51,422 --> 00:20:52,422
What?

200
00:20:52,463 --> 00:20:53,588
I will be with you brother.

201
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,880
What do I have with me, except this beedi.

202
00:20:58,047 --> 00:20:59,047
Who are you?

203
00:20:59,172 --> 00:21:00,213
Missing Thumb.

204
00:21:00,463 --> 00:21:01,713
My real name is Kesava.

205
00:21:02,088 --> 00:21:04,630
Since I don't have one finger,
everyone calls me missing thumb.

206
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,047
What is the matter?

207
00:21:06,755 --> 00:21:08,921
Brother, do you remember muni Madhav
from that timber depot?

208
00:21:08,922 --> 00:21:12,880
He said that you will become a big man.

209
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,422
I somehow want to earn lot of money
and go back to my village.

210
00:21:17,672 --> 00:21:19,713
I think I can earn fast if I'm with you.

211
00:21:22,422 --> 00:21:26,171
What? So you want me to become
a big man for your sake.. Uh?

212
00:21:26,172 --> 00:21:29,047
I thought of myself.
But you will become big.

213
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,588
How much do you want to earn?

214
00:21:33,922 --> 00:21:35,005
Ten Lakhs.

215
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,547
That's all...?

216
00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:43,547
OK go and get the wages for the day.

217
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,963
Okay Brother.

218
00:21:45,422 --> 00:21:48,356
Hey missing thumb. Didn't you collect your
money already? Why did you come again?

219
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,880
Not for me. I came for Pushpa's wages.

220
00:21:51,047 --> 00:21:52,297
I have loaded his log just now.

221
00:21:52,505 --> 00:21:54,130
Pushpa? Who is he?

222
00:21:57,047 --> 00:22:01,755
There.. That guy sitting cross legged under
the tree, and smoking a beedi.

223
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:06,213
He himself is a coolie.
Are you again a coolie for him?

224
00:22:06,838 --> 00:22:11,379
He could be sitting under a tree today, The day
he gets an opportunity he will rule the world.

225
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,129
Remember that.

226
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,170
Looks like this coolie
fellow is showing off a lot.

227
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,672
Hey useless fellows...

228
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,213
You have twenty guns
and forty bullets around you.

229
00:22:26,505 --> 00:22:29,588
No one will survive
even if one person moves.

230
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:34,838
Stay where you are.

231
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,380
Hey, throw.

232
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:44,797
Come on... throw.

233
00:22:45,047 --> 00:22:46,963
Hey, they coming closer... throw it.

234
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,087
Run.. Run...

235
00:23:03,088 --> 00:23:05,880
If you are caught by police
no one come to save you.

236
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:07,505
I've pinned all my hopes on you.

237
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,422
They are firing man,
Run away from here.

238
00:23:12,547 --> 00:23:13,672
You wil die.

239
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,547
Let's run... hey bro run..

240
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:25,130
Come on run..

241
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:12,797
Stop it... Stop.

242
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:18,797
Where is the Lorry?

243
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,297
What is this sir?

244
00:24:20,588 --> 00:24:23,963
Don't you have any other work than
catching us? Won't you catch the goods?

245
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:29,630
Lets go to the station and talk..
It's hot here.

246
00:24:32,588 --> 00:24:34,463
I won't move my leg.
You go.

247
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:50,755
Water...

248
00:24:51,213 --> 00:24:52,547
Drinking Water...

249
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,172
Not for me Sir.

250
00:25:10,047 --> 00:25:11,047
Give it to him.

251
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,505
He is so tired of beating me.
Poor guy.

252
00:25:15,963 --> 00:25:16,963
Drink Sir.

253
00:25:18,505 --> 00:25:19,963
Where did you hide the goods?

254
00:25:20,713 --> 00:25:22,422
Where did you hide the goods tell now...?

255
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:25,838
My boss won't spare me if I tell you.

256
00:25:26,338 --> 00:25:27,338
Who is that?

257
00:25:27,922 --> 00:25:29,547
Who is the boss? Who is the boss?

258
00:25:29,713 --> 00:25:31,922
Who else? It's me.

259
00:25:32,255 --> 00:25:36,088
No one is born in Chittoor district,
who can tell me..

260
00:25:39,422 --> 00:25:40,463
Not yet.

261
00:25:42,463 --> 00:25:43,755
You call yourself Boss.

262
00:25:43,922 --> 00:25:45,880
And you are laughing?

263
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,130
Laughing...

264
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:49,588
You have no respect for Police...

265
00:25:50,338 --> 00:25:51,130
laugh...

266
00:25:51,213 --> 00:25:53,505
Are you the boss?
Stop it!

267
00:25:55,047 --> 00:25:57,213
I know how to stop his laugh Sir.

268
00:26:06,005 --> 00:26:07,213
What is your name boy?

269
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,922
We need to file the case, right?
What's your name?

270
00:26:13,922 --> 00:26:14,922
Pushpa!

00:26:22,713 --> 00:26:23,922
Pushparaju...

00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:31,963
Surname? Don't know?

276
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,213
One that is written in front of the name.
I'm asking what is it?

277
00:26:41,505 --> 00:26:42,505
Don't know?

278
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,755
What are you thinking?

279
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:47,463
We all have it.
Don't you have one?

280
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:50,255
Surname?

281
00:26:51,963 --> 00:26:53,047

00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:11,088
Silence!

286
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,963
Boy... What is your name?

00:27:13,422 --> 00:27:14,630

292
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,398

00:27:22,422 --> 00:27:25,463
Molleti Venkata ramana...

294
00:27:32,297 --> 00:27:33,297
What is this sir?

295
00:27:34,297 --> 00:27:36,088
Will you just write whatever anyone says?

296
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,505
Won't you verify the details?

297
00:27:40,005 --> 00:27:45,505
Just because my father visited their house
few times, will our surname become theirs?

298
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:55,963
Can't you differentiate kids born out of
wedlock and the ones born to a mistress?

299
00:27:56,797 --> 00:28:00,047
Surname belongs to the ones born legally...

300
00:28:00,922 --> 00:28:03,088
not to hybrid fellows.

301
00:28:08,213 --> 00:28:10,172
Rey... Come here.

302
00:28:13,922 --> 00:28:14,922
What is your name?

303
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,255
Molleti Pushparaju!

304
00:28:19,172 --> 00:28:21,672
Just because my father
slept with your mother,

305
00:28:22,755 --> 00:28:24,880
you can't inherit our surname.

306
00:28:29,547 --> 00:28:30,880
You don't have a surname.

307
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:34,130
Your name is Just Pushparaju.

308
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,088
Pushparaju.

309
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,797
Now say, what is your name?

310
00:28:39,547 --> 00:28:41,047
Pushparaju!

311
00:28:42,088 --> 00:28:43,588
Pushparaju!

312
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,172
Say loudly so that everyone can hear.

313
00:28:54,422 --> 00:28:55,588
Pushparaju!

314
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,213
What is this brother?
They have beaten you so badly.

315
00:29:12,422 --> 00:29:15,463
Won't they beat if you hide the Lorry?

316
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:17,837
Am feeling hungry.
Let's talk while eating.

317
00:29:17,838 --> 00:29:19,880
What is this? Look at all those injuries.

318
00:29:21,713 --> 00:29:22,880
Go man...

319
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,212
Brother What is there to eat.

320
00:29:25,213 --> 00:29:27,922
Seshanna...
Jakkareddy bro, jaalreddy bro are coming.

321
00:29:29,463 --> 00:29:32,463
These are red sandal smugglers...
Brothers of Konda Reddy.

322
00:29:32,797 --> 00:29:35,463
Konda Reddy brothers are three.

323
00:29:37,255 --> 00:29:38,630
Third one is Jaali Reddy.

324
00:29:38,963 --> 00:29:41,483
Unless he feels the feminine air,
he will not be able to breath.

325
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,880
If his eyes falls on any girl, he
make sure that se will loss her virginity.

326
00:29:45,463 --> 00:29:50,797
It doesn't matter whom the girl marries, she
has to spent her first night with Jolly reddy.

327
00:29:54,255 --> 00:29:57,335
Obulu is very lucky that Jolly Brother
has gifted 5000 rupees to his marriage.

328
00:29:59,963 --> 00:30:01,297
Second one Jakka Reddy...

329
00:30:01,838 --> 00:30:03,963
Amongst the three he's the one with brains.

330
00:30:04,547 --> 00:30:10,838
He is the one who take care the business.

331
00:30:19,213 --> 00:30:22,005
He is Kondareddy, the eldest brother.

332
00:30:22,172 --> 00:30:26,172
In the riots at Siddhavati,
he chased six of them and slayed them.

333
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,671
Believes in only Revenge over life
so threw a bomb at them.

334
00:30:29,672 --> 00:30:32,797
As a sole survivor of the gang,
he runs the show now.

335
00:30:33,088 --> 00:30:36,338
If the police caught us,
there's no fun in getting gagged...

336
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,921
but now I see the owners
themselves have turned up.

337
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:41,630
Now I understand if this
is all part of Pushup's plan.

338
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,963
Hope all is well...

339
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,672
I am fine but..

340
00:30:44,838 --> 00:30:47,731
Heard that you didn't tell them whose goods
they are, even after police torturing you badly.

341
00:30:47,755 --> 00:30:49,148
Looks like you have a lot of spunk.

342
00:30:49,172 --> 00:30:50,172
Bro...

343
00:30:50,338 --> 00:30:53,547
Their salary is less than
5 thousand per month.

344
00:30:53,755 --> 00:30:55,505
What will I get if I tell them?

345
00:30:55,797 --> 00:30:59,297
A broken beedi .. But you are different...

346
00:30:59,588 --> 00:31:03,172
Are you asking money to tell where it is...
Coolie fellow...

347
00:31:05,338 --> 00:31:06,630
How much do you want?

348
00:31:07,005 --> 00:31:09,047
You can't give me what I want.

349
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,838
Just, give me five lakhs.

350
00:31:12,172 --> 00:31:13,213
Five lakhs!

351
00:31:15,213 --> 00:31:16,713
Who will give him 5 lakhs?

352
00:31:17,088 --> 00:31:19,568
If we give him some nice thrashing,
he will reveal everything..

353
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,630
What is that laugh?

354
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,755
This guy was laughing
like this the whole night

355
00:31:24,005 --> 00:31:27,630
40 Laathis broke,
but the laugh didn't go away..

356
00:31:27,963 --> 00:31:30,588
Finally we got fed up and stopped.

357
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:32,213
My thrashing will be different.

358
00:31:37,255 --> 00:31:38,255
Okay!

359
00:31:39,005 --> 00:31:41,797
I will pay the money you want.
Tell me where the goods are.

360
00:31:42,172 --> 00:31:46,130
You won't understand if I say,
let me show you...

361
00:31:49,005 --> 00:31:52,712
See.. My hands are cuffed..
How can I show like this...?

362
00:31:52,713 --> 00:31:55,797
He is asking us get him a bail..
Did you get it?

363
00:31:56,005 --> 00:31:58,630
Looks like your brother
is smarter than you...

364
00:31:59,005 --> 00:32:01,963
anyways pay for what
I ate and call a lawyer.

365
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:03,713
Hey Jaali.

366
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,731
Are you telling us,
just because we are not doing anything.

367
00:32:05,755 --> 00:32:07,422
Do you know who are you speaking to?

368
00:32:07,463 --> 00:32:08,463
Konda Reddy Brothers.

369
00:32:08,755 --> 00:32:10,463
I will kill you and burry you.

370
00:32:11,755 --> 00:32:15,422
Then who will tell you where the goods are
Konda Reddy Brother?

371
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:21,297
Stop... stop it!

372
00:32:25,672 --> 00:32:27,880
What is this? Why did he bring us here?

373
00:32:27,963 --> 00:32:29,130
Can see only fields around.

374
00:32:29,463 --> 00:32:32,273
Rey. Looks like these coolie fellows sat in
a car for the first time.. Go open the door.

375
00:32:32,297 --> 00:32:34,130
Brother, door is struck.
It's not opening...

376
00:32:34,172 --> 00:32:35,463
What's the hurry?

377
00:32:35,588 --> 00:32:37,838
This Door! Easier to clean than to open!

378
00:32:38,047 --> 00:32:40,338
How do you do it?
- This way!

379
00:32:51,463 --> 00:32:54,797
Where is the lorry?
I see nothing but a well here.

380
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:21,922
What is this? Why did you destroy the Lorry
so badly, it is of no use now.

381
00:33:22,505 --> 00:33:25,213
Do you know the value of the Lorry,
Coolie fellows.

382
00:33:25,238 --> 00:33:26,963
Bro, give us the money, our money.

383
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:28,463
Hey, give them the money.

384
00:33:29,005 --> 00:33:31,130
Here is 5 lakhs...

385
00:33:32,047 --> 00:33:33,755
go and enjoy with your brother.
Have fun...

386
00:33:34,523 --> 00:33:37,079
Never seen so much money bro...

387
00:33:37,496 --> 00:33:39,996
Can repay all debts and
bring the buffalo back home.

388
00:33:40,704 --> 00:33:42,245
Whoever had said it, said it right.

389
00:33:42,246 --> 00:33:44,410
'If I am with you,
I can make 10 lakhs just like that brother.

390
00:33:44,434 --> 00:33:45,995
Hey Where are you coming?

391
00:33:46,716 --> 00:33:50,800
I don't have the habit of sticking
to the women once I use her.

392
00:33:54,287 --> 00:33:56,454
Take this hundred and
come in an Auto Rickshaw.

393
00:34:01,412 --> 00:34:03,204
Come bro. We have an auto here.

394
00:34:03,513 --> 00:34:06,179
Hey Driver... will you drop
us at Ramasamudram...?

395
00:34:06,204 --> 00:34:08,412
What will be the price of that vehicle?

396
00:34:09,037 --> 00:34:10,037
You mean, that Car... bro?

397
00:34:10,037 --> 00:34:10,704
Ya...

398
00:34:10,705 --> 00:34:11,869
It should be around 5 lacs bro.

399
00:34:11,893 --> 00:34:13,599
Does that car cost 5 lacs!

400
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:15,745
Isn't it too expensive.

401
00:34:15,746 --> 00:34:16,746
Yes Brother.

402
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:19,934
Go and buy that car.

403
00:34:20,829 --> 00:34:21,829
Bro...

404
00:34:22,662 --> 00:34:23,871
Go and buy that car.

405
00:34:25,746 --> 00:34:27,287
What are you talking bro?

406
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:31,191
We came here in a car when
we didn't have a penny on us.

407
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:34,079
Would it look good to go in an
Auto when we have so much money?

408
00:34:34,307 --> 00:34:35,515
Go and get that car.

409
00:34:36,496 --> 00:34:39,930
Brother, please understand. If we buy the car,
all the money will be spending on the car.

410
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:41,263
We won't have anything left with us.

411
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,786
Then we will have to go and
work for daily wages again.

412
00:34:42,787 --> 00:34:44,883
And will we go for daily
wage work in a car or what?

413
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,079
Hey, I came here in car,
and I will leave only in a car from here.

414
00:34:50,287 --> 00:34:52,453
Till then I won't move from here.

415
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:53,579
Bro Bro...

416
00:34:53,662 --> 00:34:57,829
Hey... I will not budge
an inch in this matter.

417
00:35:03,204 --> 00:35:05,786
Hey. Who is that honking?

418
00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:07,453
Do you think your mother owns this road?

419
00:35:07,454 --> 00:35:09,537
Roll down the window.

420
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:11,309
I want to see who the hell you are...

421
00:35:11,996 --> 00:35:13,412
It's me. Your son from the hell...

422
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:16,704
Oh, is that you... Pushpa.

423
00:35:17,371 --> 00:35:19,121
What are those injuries on your body?

424
00:35:19,746 --> 00:35:24,287
You are seeing the small, small injuries on my
body, but can't see the big car in front of you.

425
00:35:26,162 --> 00:35:28,912
What kind of work are you doing...?
Whose car is this?

426
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:32,912
It is Parvathamma's..
- Which Parvathamma?

427
00:35:33,662 --> 00:35:35,079
Pushpa's mother.

428
00:35:35,621 --> 00:35:36,871
That's me.

429
00:35:37,037 --> 00:35:38,912
Then, It's your car.

430
00:35:38,996 --> 00:35:42,912
But,
I can't understand how you bought this car.

431
00:35:43,246 --> 00:35:45,638
Seeing your difficulty in fetching water,
Brother bought this car for you.

432
00:35:45,662 --> 00:35:48,121
Who the hell are you?
- Keshava Aunty.

433
00:35:51,287 --> 00:35:52,746
Pushpa, why did you bring it here?

434
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,579
Whose car is this Maa?

435
00:35:58,746 --> 00:35:59,829
Hey wait!

436
00:36:00,996 --> 00:36:02,121
Hey wait...

437
00:36:06,454 --> 00:36:09,245
Look, everyone is looking at us.
Why did you bring it here?

438
00:36:09,246 --> 00:36:10,246
Uncle?

439
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:15,287
Daddy.. Uncle has bought the car.

440
00:36:16,662 --> 00:36:20,954
The one who buys a car becomes car owner...
not your uncle.

441
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,079
Come in.

442
00:36:22,996 --> 00:36:26,912
Did you see that car, Mohan?
Where did he get so much money to buy?

443
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:31,662
What else can you expect from a ragpicker?
Obviously through stealth.

444
00:36:33,871 --> 00:36:36,287
Hey looks like Mangalam Seenu Brother
has come. Go and see.

445
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:38,537
Brother, Namasthe...

446
00:36:38,621 --> 00:36:39,703
Namasthe, Namasthe.

447
00:36:39,704 --> 00:36:43,621
Bro, just by spending five lakhs, I am not only
got a car, am also getting respect with it.

448
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:48,829
Why are you staring like that, man? Jakkareddy
bro called us. So we came in our car.

449
00:36:53,746 --> 00:36:55,506
Sit Bro... Now we are
qualified to sit here.

450
00:36:56,037 --> 00:36:59,454
Don't want, again have to stand up
when Konda Reddy comes.

451
00:36:59,787 --> 00:37:01,454
I can't give so much respect to him.

452
00:37:05,204 --> 00:37:08,204
How many loads, Subbareddy?
- Around 12 loads Brother.

453
00:37:09,246 --> 00:37:15,121
How could you guys go and surrender
3 crores worth of stock to SP Govindappa?

454
00:37:15,246 --> 00:37:18,954
Don't we have anyone who can transport
the load by hoodwinking Govindappa?

455
00:37:18,996 --> 00:37:21,246
He is catching us in whichever way we go.

456
00:37:21,662 --> 00:37:25,412
It is not possible to send
a load when he is around.

457
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:28,662
It's crazy why you are
over-praising Govindappa here.

458
00:37:28,954 --> 00:37:31,161
Like a restless lady who throws
in the towel with her neighbor.

459
00:37:31,162 --> 00:37:32,722
Leave it - its all beyond your ability.

460
00:37:32,746 --> 00:37:33,912
Who the hell is he?

461
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,329
He is a coolie fellow.

462
00:37:35,746 --> 00:37:40,620
What the hell, Just because you came in a car you
think you earned a right to speak in this meeting.

463
00:37:40,621 --> 00:37:41,621
Get out...

464
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:45,996
Brother, He is the same guy
whom we got out on bail, Pushpa.

465
00:37:46,204 --> 00:37:47,222
I only asked him to come along.

466
00:37:47,246 --> 00:37:50,746
Are you the one who hid our load
and collected five lacs from us?

467
00:37:50,871 --> 00:37:55,829
Five lakhs are not for hiding the load Sir. It's for
protecting you and your brothers from going to jail.

468
00:37:56,329 --> 00:37:57,829
As if you don't know...

469
00:37:58,662 --> 00:38:01,246
it is not a big deal to
get beaten by Police.

470
00:38:01,621 --> 00:38:04,621
Speak if you have guts to transport
the load without getting caught.

471
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:08,037
You need an idea for transporting the load.
Not guts...

472
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,162
Yes brother.
What our people are doing is...

473
00:38:11,621 --> 00:38:16,079
Covering the load with Tomatoes and Watermelons.
They move the fruits, they see the load..

474
00:38:16,287 --> 00:38:20,621
Forget Govindappa, Our load can be found
even by a useless Gurkha also.

475
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:25,246
We have to send the load but no one
should know. I have an idea. Should I tell?

476
00:38:26,162 --> 00:38:28,329
You want to tell us how
to transport the load.

477
00:38:28,662 --> 00:38:31,245
Everyone See,
who has come to give us ideas.

478
00:38:31,246 --> 00:38:32,246
Coolie fellow.

479
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:35,121
Say what you think. Say.. Say...

480
00:38:35,412 --> 00:38:40,537
is this a pickle to share with the entire world? Ideas
brother... how can I say it Infront of everyone...?

481
00:38:41,954 --> 00:38:44,829
You are asking, us only to go out..
How dare you?

482
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:46,329
Wait Jaali.

483
00:38:48,162 --> 00:38:53,954
Hey!..I better like what you say.. If not this
konda reddy will deal with you differently.

484
00:38:54,329 --> 00:38:56,829
All of you go out.

485
00:39:59,246 --> 00:40:01,537
Hey stop..

486
00:40:03,621 --> 00:40:04,454
Check him..

487
00:40:04,455 --> 00:40:06,912
What sir.. Looks like
you are suspecting me.

488
00:40:07,162 --> 00:40:11,037
After your thrashing, I have stopped all old
businesses and started milk business now.

489
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:14,746
Yes Sir, We have taken contract
with Kalahasthi Khova Shop.

490
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,162
Yes Sir, there is milk only here sir.

491
00:40:17,454 --> 00:40:20,894
We mixed water in the milk, now don't tell
me you are going to arrest us for that also.

492
00:40:21,287 --> 00:40:21,829
Let him go.

493
00:40:22,037 --> 00:40:25,871
Give some Kalahasthi Khova to Sir.
We will go and come sir..

494
00:40:27,287 --> 00:40:29,079
Where was he hiding all these days?

495
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:33,287
Give him... Give him all the load and
you be around to supervise.

496
00:40:34,037 --> 00:40:38,120
I can do the complete the work all alone.
Just tell me what you will pay me.

497
00:40:38,121 --> 00:40:39,246
Your rate only Pushpa.

498
00:40:39,454 --> 00:40:42,134
We will pay you what we paid last time..
5 lakhs per load. Is it OK?

499
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:47,454
Five lakhs is not okay.
Give me 4 percent.

500
00:40:47,871 --> 00:40:50,162
4 percent would mean 4 lakhs.

501
00:40:50,412 --> 00:40:51,995
You will lose one lakh.

502
00:40:51,996 --> 00:40:55,371
You can keep that one lakh to yourself,
just pay my 4 percent.

503
00:40:59,391 --> 00:41:00,780
What is this bro?

504
00:41:00,805 --> 00:41:03,221
He was willing to pay 5 lakhs..
One lakh is our loss.

505
00:41:03,246 --> 00:41:07,954
If we had taken five lakhs,
we would have been their servants.

506
00:41:08,662 --> 00:41:12,954
By taking 4 percent,
won't we become his partners.?

507
00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:19,953
Now, Konda Reddy and we are Partners..
Partner Pushpa here.

508
00:41:19,954 --> 00:41:22,371
You are very smart brother.

509
00:41:27,121 --> 00:41:29,621
Hey, why is everyone
looking at the sky like that?

510
00:41:29,662 --> 00:41:30,746
Looking for the sparrows.

511
00:41:31,621 --> 00:41:32,621
What?

512
00:41:32,622 --> 00:41:34,996
For Sparrows.
- But... Why?

513
00:41:35,121 --> 00:41:37,579
Bro... see that girl sitting there,
wearing a red saree?

514
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:38,621
That girl...

515
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,329
She says she won't sell milk
unless she hears a Sparrow.

516
00:41:41,537 --> 00:41:44,057
With such a big work in hand,
what is this sparrow nonsense man?

517
00:41:44,204 --> 00:41:45,496
Who is that mad girl?

518
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:47,454
It's my daughter.

519
00:41:47,912 --> 00:41:50,454
She doesn't listen to anyone. Even mine.

520
00:41:50,996 --> 00:41:54,787
I named her after my mother,
and she is just like her in everything.

521
00:41:55,496 --> 00:41:58,329
Srivalli!

522
00:42:21,454 --> 00:42:25,537
You turn away both your
eyes when I look at you.

523
00:42:25,746 --> 00:42:30,037
And cover your glances with your eyelids.

524
00:42:30,537 --> 00:42:35,078
You stare at even an invisible
god without blinking an eye.

525
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:38,996
But you are ignoring me
when I'm in front of your eyes.

526
00:42:39,537 --> 00:42:46,829
Your looks have become as pricey as gold
Srivalli Your word has become as rare as a ruby.

527
00:42:48,454 --> 00:42:55,746
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your smile has become as precious as nine gems.

528
00:43:03,454 --> 00:43:09,371
What Sir? Why are you pawing with Lathis?
Its only milk, Sir!

529
00:43:09,871 --> 00:43:11,454
We are a reformed lot now.

530
00:43:24,621 --> 00:43:32,621
Me, who used to lead in everything
Is following you wherever you go now.

531
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:41,579
Me, who never bent my head before anyone
Has bent my head to look at your anklet.

532
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:46,578
After having lived such a great life,
Am now making rounds of your house.

533
00:43:46,579 --> 00:43:51,037
And thought it's enough
even if you look at me for an instant.

534
00:43:53,454 --> 00:43:55,454
Did She see?
- No bro...

535
00:43:56,662 --> 00:43:58,662
Did you see properly?

536
00:43:59,371 --> 00:44:01,829
I have seen brother.
She didn't even see once.

537
00:44:04,204 --> 00:44:05,954
I think you are very happy, right?

538
00:44:06,412 --> 00:44:07,621
For what, bro?

539
00:44:07,662 --> 00:44:09,037
Because she didn't see.

540
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:10,411
Why will I be happy bro?

541
00:44:10,412 --> 00:44:17,370
No.. You are feeling happy, eating that peanut candy happily
and saying, she hasn't looked even once.. I noticed it.

542
00:44:17,371 --> 00:44:19,495
No bro, I'm feeling bad inside.

543
00:44:19,496 --> 00:44:24,412
OK. She didn't see. What would you
have lost if you had said, she saw once..

544
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:26,829
At lest I would have
felt happy Isn't it...?

545
00:44:27,371 --> 00:44:29,578
I didn't get that idea bro. Sorry bro...

546
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:32,305
You won't get that idea. Why will
you get any idea that makes me happy?

547
00:44:32,329 --> 00:44:39,621
Your looks have become as pricey as gold
Srivalli Your word has become as rare as a ruby.

548
00:44:41,246 --> 00:44:48,537
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your smile has become as precious as nine gems.

549
00:45:17,496 --> 00:45:25,496
All your friends are average looking
May be... That's why you look beautiful.

550
00:45:26,162 --> 00:45:34,162
And when one becomes 18 It's not just you,
any girl would look cute.

551
00:45:35,121 --> 00:45:39,662
When red sandal wears a saree
Even a stone would look like a princess.

552
00:45:39,704 --> 00:45:43,454
And, when a seven stone earring is worn
Any girl would look beautiful.

553
00:45:44,485 --> 00:45:45,527
Bro...

554
00:45:45,649 --> 00:45:46,982
Now loading is done. Shall we go?

555
00:45:47,607 --> 00:45:48,649
Shall we go?

556
00:45:48,815 --> 00:45:49,815
Yes, Bro.

557
00:45:50,107 --> 00:45:53,482
Is that all? Should we go?

558
00:45:53,982 --> 00:45:57,232
What else? Loading is done.
So, Let's go. That's it.

559
00:45:58,607 --> 00:46:00,607
Do you find all this funny?

560
00:46:00,899 --> 00:46:02,065
Why bro?

561
00:46:02,649 --> 00:46:04,064
You know it and you are still asking

562
00:46:04,065 --> 00:46:05,606
I seriously don't know brother.
I don't know.

563
00:46:05,607 --> 00:46:09,357
You know I didn't come for the load,
but came here for that girl.

564
00:46:09,524 --> 00:46:11,439
You know it and you are still saying
that we should leave.

565
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,939
OK.. Lets leave then.. Come..
- Brother.. Brother..

566
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:17,231
You can stay here as long as you want..
I will also stay with you.

567
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:21,857
I will stay... I will stay and You too stay
with me, and tell me if she is looking at me.

568
00:46:24,899 --> 00:46:25,899
Did she see?

569
00:46:25,899 --> 00:46:26,899
Yes, Brother.

570
00:46:27,149 --> 00:46:29,064
She is looking at you only
while washing the vessels.

571
00:46:29,065 --> 00:46:31,024
Is it true...?

572
00:46:32,315 --> 00:46:36,482
You are lying to make me happy, isn't it?

573
00:46:37,399 --> 00:46:38,607
Yes Brother.

574
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:42,524
How can you agree so fast man?

575
00:46:42,649 --> 00:46:45,273
You could have let me feel happy for
some more time...

576
00:46:45,274 --> 00:46:48,814
I think it is better I go and beg her to
look at me instead of dealing with you.

577
00:46:48,815 --> 00:46:52,398
Bro, don't do that brother.
- I will go and beg her, to look at me.

578
00:46:52,399 --> 00:46:54,689
Please don't do that brother.

579
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,732
I know, there is no use talking to you..

580
00:46:57,232 --> 00:47:00,482
But for the last time,
tell me if she is looking at me or not.

581
00:47:02,107 --> 00:47:03,481
I don't know what to say brother.

582
00:47:03,482 --> 00:47:04,833
I told you to tell me that
she is looking at me...

583
00:47:04,857 --> 00:47:12,815
Your looks have become as pricey as gold
Srivalli Your word has become as rare as a ruby.

584
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:21,690
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your smile has become as precious as nine gems.

585
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,482
Hello Sir!

586
00:48:01,274 --> 00:48:06,399
What happened sir? It's the usual milk.
Why are you checking today sir?

587
00:48:11,607 --> 00:48:17,690
What is this? I can hear milk sound on
the top and the sound of the wood below.

588
00:48:18,815 --> 00:48:20,649
Are you hiding any load underneath?

589
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:22,482
Catch him... Catch him.

590
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:25,064

00:48:28,024 --> 00:48:32,274
Sir, please leave us sir...

593
00:48:32,565 --> 00:48:35,398
This is all because of Pushpa sir...
We did as Pushpa said.

594
00:48:35,399 --> 00:48:36,399
Please leave us sir.

595
00:48:36,649 --> 00:48:39,399
There is one condition
if I want to leave you.

596
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,524
All these days you did as Pushpa said.

597
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:45,274
Now you must do as I say.

598
00:48:46,315 --> 00:48:47,315
What?

599
00:48:50,524 --> 00:48:52,708
Fifteen for Hundred...
Fifteen for Hundred... Fifteen for..

600
00:48:52,732 --> 00:48:54,232
Hello Brother. Please stop.

00:48:54,274 --> 00:48:55,994
How much do you have?
- We need six tickets.

00:48:56,024 --> 00:48:59,106
We have one hundred and seventy...

603
00:48:59,107 --> 00:48:59,857
170?

604
00:48:59,899 --> 00:49:03,648
For the kind of money you have, you can
only wish to watch. Not watch. Please leave.

605
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:07,065
What should we do? How
can we see the movie?

606
00:49:07,315 --> 00:49:10,041
Hey girls, You are the girls from the milk center. Am I right?
- Yes we are, So what?

607
00:49:10,065 --> 00:49:11,958
Just wanted to check if
you could got the tickets.

608
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:14,750
How can we buy a ticket, when they sell
Fifteen rupees ticket for One hundred rupees?

609
00:49:14,774 --> 00:49:17,750
It is the price one has to pay for big
brothers movie.. How much are you short?

610
00:49:17,774 --> 00:49:19,149
We are short by four hundred.

611
00:49:19,274 --> 00:49:22,899
Is that so, I will give you that
money if you do a work for me.

612
00:49:23,065 --> 00:49:24,465
What is that? What should we do? O.

613
00:49:24,982 --> 00:49:27,041
You have a friend named Srivalli right...
- Yes, of course.

614
00:49:27,065 --> 00:49:28,690
Ask her to look at our Pushpa once.

615
00:49:29,274 --> 00:49:31,815
Hey .. Hey.. Srivalli...

616
00:49:31,982 --> 00:49:32,690
What?

617
00:49:32,774 --> 00:49:34,458
That guy.. Pushpa. Can
you look at him once?

618
00:49:34,482 --> 00:49:35,274
Who is Pushpa?

619
00:49:35,275 --> 00:49:36,458
The guy who keeps sitting at
your milk center. Do you remember?

620
00:49:36,482 --> 00:49:40,274
He sits cross legged
with a dark guy next to him.

621
00:49:40,857 --> 00:49:42,857
Hey girl, His name is Keshava and it's me.

622
00:49:42,982 --> 00:49:44,315
You stop man.

623
00:49:44,524 --> 00:49:47,732
He looks good girl. Please look at him once.
- Is he so good looking?

624
00:49:48,232 --> 00:49:51,690
So, if we have to watch chirajeevi,
then I have to look at him.. OK.. OK

625
00:49:51,732 --> 00:49:53,024
I will.. I will.

626
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,815
Will she?
- Yes.

627
00:49:55,732 --> 00:49:56,732
OK. Take this.

628
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:57,940
Who is she?

629
00:49:58,232 --> 00:50:00,315
Take tickets... fast.

630
00:50:01,649 --> 00:50:02,357
Who brother?

631
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,399
You meat that girl in brown color saree??
- Yes.

632
00:50:05,524 --> 00:50:07,149
I will find out.

633
00:50:07,232 --> 00:50:09,607
Hey girl. One more thing..
- What?

634
00:50:09,815 --> 00:50:12,982
You said you will look at him just now.
Why don't you smile at him too?

635
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:15,149
What is this smile business? I won't smile.

636
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:18,357
If you don't smile...
- No... No. She will smile It's only a smile.. Right.?

637
00:50:18,607 --> 00:50:20,689
(INDISTINCT VOICES)

638
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:24,649
Ask him to come the Temple tomorrow.
- Smile... ask her not to forget the smile.

639
00:50:26,261 --> 00:50:31,719
Bro, the priest said that the girl will look at
you if perform Abhishekam. That's why I brought you

640
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:35,511
I don't believe in all these.

641
00:50:35,803 --> 00:50:39,428
Bro, look here.
Srivalli is coming. Our prayers worked.

642
00:50:40,678 --> 00:50:44,136
So, what if she comes?
She doesn't look at me. Come... Let's go.

643
00:50:44,261 --> 00:50:47,022
Where do you want to go? Stay back brother.
Stay once bro. Look there.

644
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,571
Look at Pushpa. He is so handsome.

645
00:50:50,596 --> 00:50:52,718
She doesn't look at me. It's a waste.

646
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,779
(GIRLS WHISPERING)
I am looking but he is not looking at me.

647
00:50:54,803 --> 00:50:56,279
Stop bro. I had paid thousand rupees.

648
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,303
What?

649
00:50:57,344 --> 00:51:00,469
To the priest. Our money will go waste..

650
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,725
This is the last time. If she doesn't look at
me, I won't look at her ever again in my life..

651
00:51:06,726 --> 00:51:09,435
OK Bro. This is my last word. Fast & Final.

652
00:51:21,976 --> 00:51:23,851
Srivalli is looking at me.

653
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:27,518
Smile at him.

654
00:51:27,726 --> 00:51:29,351
Is she looking at you?
- Yes.

655
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:33,685
Smile at him.
- I'm smiling. Hang on.

656
00:51:34,018 --> 00:51:36,435
Hey.. She is smiling at me too

657
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:39,143
did she smile or is she smiling...?

658
00:51:39,226 --> 00:51:40,851
Hey see man. She is smiled at me.

659
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:42,726
That's the power of Thousand rupees

660
00:51:43,564 --> 00:51:44,564
you also smile back..

661
00:51:45,476 --> 00:51:46,393
Yes, I too smiled.

662
00:51:46,435 --> 00:51:49,893
It's enough for these faces. Let's go now
They paid thousand rupees only. Let's go.

663
00:51:50,973 --> 00:51:52,598
Now I understood.

664
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:59,393
She didn't see me when I was looking at her.
And I didn't see her when she was looking at me.

665
00:52:00,018 --> 00:52:04,018
When she caught me looking at her, while she
was looking at me.. She burst out laughing.

666
00:52:04,893 --> 00:52:06,690
I know that she loves me.

667
00:52:06,715 --> 00:52:08,476
That's why I was behind her.

668
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:10,101
Come. Let's go and speak to her once.

669
00:52:10,143 --> 00:52:13,643
Where do you want to go? Don't forget
who you are.. You can't bend before her.

670
00:52:13,768 --> 00:52:15,619
We should take first step in
these situations. You don't know.

671
00:52:15,643 --> 00:52:17,898
Don't go brother.

672
00:52:19,643 --> 00:52:22,094
Hey Srivalli... Srivalli.

673
00:52:23,643 --> 00:52:25,268
Why Were you smiling at me?

674
00:52:26,812 --> 00:52:28,437
Do you like me?

675
00:52:29,351 --> 00:52:31,350
When did I like you?

676
00:52:31,351 --> 00:52:33,226
Then why were you smiling at me?

677
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,185
Won't I smile when I am paid..

678
00:52:35,601 --> 00:52:36,768
Money?
- Yes.

679
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:37,810
What money?

680
00:52:37,893 --> 00:52:40,810
It seems you were feeling sad,
because I was not looking at you

681
00:52:41,476 --> 00:52:42,768
was I feeling Sad?

682
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:46,310
Yes, that's why your friend Keshava gave me
the money to smile.. So I did..

683
00:52:47,726 --> 00:52:49,351
Did you smile for that?

684
00:52:49,435 --> 00:52:53,268
Whatever it is,
We got to see Chiranjeevi movie.

685
00:52:53,893 --> 00:52:55,643
It was very nice.

686
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:59,643
After having soft drinks and Samosa
we are still left with two hundred rupees.

687
00:52:59,893 --> 00:53:04,143
Let me know where you would tomorrow.
I will come and smile at you for that..

688
00:53:04,685 --> 00:53:07,226
Is this what thousand rupees prayer means?

689
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:10,018
Tell me where I can find you tomorrow...

690
00:53:10,185 --> 00:53:12,435
All my pride and ego has gone to dust..

691
00:53:12,976 --> 00:53:16,018
Hey Keshava. You have destroyed me today.

692
00:53:16,185 --> 00:53:17,810
Hey Keshava. Where are you?

693
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:22,643
Am coming bro...
I did all this for your happiness.

694
00:53:22,768 --> 00:53:25,036
Isn't it disgusting to ask that girl to
smile at me by paying her for money?

695
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:29,893
You denied me of the feeling of happiness,
that a girl loved me..

696
00:53:30,101 --> 00:53:33,309
How can we stoop so low,
to pay a girl and ask her to smile at me..

697
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,893
Am I like that? Am I like that Jaali Reddy?

698
00:53:38,268 --> 00:53:43,226
You have totally damaged my dignity.
Anyways, How much did you pay?

699
00:53:43,351 --> 00:53:48,185
Thousand.
- Thousand... for a smile.

700
00:53:50,935 --> 00:53:55,976
OK. Anyways since I have already become bad.. I
will pay five thousand Ask her to give me a kiss me.

701
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:59,393
What are you saying bro?
- I will pay her five thousand. Ask her if she will kiss me

702
00:53:59,768 --> 00:54:01,161
I never thought you
can behave like this bro

703
00:54:01,185 --> 00:54:03,851
I'm not like this bro.
I'm a very good person

704
00:54:03,893 --> 00:54:07,268
but you have started this
and now you should take this to the end..

705
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:20,935
ONE thousand tonnes of Syndicate stuff!

706
00:54:25,351 --> 00:54:29,601
Approximately two hundred crores! And
standing here instead of enroute Chennai..

707
00:54:32,726 --> 00:54:36,476
What do we do with him? Mangalam Seenu,
Rotates locations instead of the stuff.

708
00:54:39,768 --> 00:54:41,976
Is it possible he would
be in Kondareddy gudam?

709
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:56,268
If you tip us off the moment he lands
new stuff, do you know the reward?

710
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:58,060
Fifty Lakh Rupees.

711
00:55:04,476 --> 00:55:07,226
How are you Draccha?
- I'm good Uncle

712
00:55:09,018 --> 00:55:11,351
hey.. Srinu? What brings you here?

713
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,435
Excellent location Konda Reddy.

714
00:55:16,393 --> 00:55:19,893
Godown is also nice.
Even Draccha liked it.

715
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:23,101
He is Mangalam Seenu.

716
00:55:23,768 --> 00:55:25,935
The boss of the smuggling syndicate!

717
00:55:26,518 --> 00:55:29,638
There may be the likes of Kondareddy
snoring at corners to sweat small stuff...

718
00:55:29,851 --> 00:55:35,392
but there can only be one man who can single-handedly navigate
the big stuff all through the 15 checkpoints to the Chennai Port.

719
00:55:35,393 --> 00:55:38,351
That's why he is the
one who calls the shots.

720
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:42,310
Nobody can go against
him and get away with it.

721
00:55:43,101 --> 00:55:46,061
I see that you are shifting all the load
into my godown. What is the issue?

722
00:55:46,351 --> 00:55:49,185
You know Gowrreddy right...
- Who? Our Gowrreddy??

723
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:55,435
I dismissed him from job as
he was messing up the with stock books.

724
00:55:55,518 --> 00:56:01,101
How could you do that man? What if he informs the
police? He knows addresses of all your godowns very well.

725
00:56:01,935 --> 00:56:06,560
That's why I brought all the
stock to your godown konda reddy.

726
00:56:07,018 --> 00:56:10,893
We still have some time to take it to Chennai.
Please safeguard the stocka. I hope it's safe.

727
00:56:11,226 --> 00:56:18,310
What are you talking dear? Did we bring the stock
directly here without trusting Kondareddy uncle?

728
00:56:18,435 --> 00:56:20,286
But the problem is that stock is
safeguarded by that Jaali Reddy.

729
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:23,351
And you know that womanizer Jaali reddy is
surrounded always by girls.

730
00:56:23,393 --> 00:56:26,976
If we trust and leave our stock with here,
it is like digging our own graves.

731
00:56:27,226 --> 00:56:33,851
You said it right. If Govindappa comes behind
a girl, the entire stock will go for a toss.

732
00:56:34,018 --> 00:56:37,226
Syndicate has trusted me
and kept the stock with me.

733
00:56:37,476 --> 00:56:38,351
You said it right dear...

734
00:56:38,393 --> 00:56:43,601
No need to worry. Now we have a sharp guy
called Pushpa. He is taking care of everything.

735
00:56:43,643 --> 00:56:48,268
After he came, Police are not able to catch even
a stem, forget a log.. There he comes.. See.

736
00:56:48,726 --> 00:56:52,143
You are saying he is new. Can we trust him?

737
00:57:32,393 --> 00:57:35,643
I will tell in detail about
him some other time Seena.

738
00:57:37,976 --> 00:57:40,296
He doesn't look like the one
to be discussed another time.

739
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:43,744
Anyways, I have to go for a
wedding in Tirupati. I take your leave.

740
00:57:43,768 --> 00:57:47,268
Pushpa, Srinanna's stock will be
with us for two days. Take care of it..

741
00:57:47,476 --> 00:57:49,744
Sure, Brother.
- Brother, we are getting late. Come fast..

742
00:57:49,768 --> 00:57:54,310
What did you do with Gowrreddy?
Are you ignoring him or what?

743
00:57:55,726 --> 00:58:03,268
Don't look at sky always uncle, look at the earth also sometimes.
We get trees from the there only.. Won't you put manure to it..

744
00:58:10,226 --> 00:58:12,351
Brother, Look there once.

745
00:58:32,518 --> 00:58:40,518
He is like my younger brother.
I can't see him die.

746
00:58:51,851 --> 00:58:55,935
Why does this Mallesh do incomplete
work always? Get me the gun...

747
00:58:57,726 --> 00:58:59,351
Give me.

748
00:59:07,643 --> 00:59:11,060
Why do we need this garbage in
our backyard? Throw it in the forest.

749
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:26,310
What is this?
- Cardamom bro.. For a good smell.

750
00:59:28,768 --> 00:59:32,018
Why delay? Where are the girls

751
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,476
they are coming brother.

752
00:59:37,935 --> 00:59:41,184
Why are you still standing here? Go.

753
00:59:41,185 --> 00:59:43,185
Go... go.
Go and kiss him.

754
00:59:44,601 --> 00:59:47,100
I'm scared dear. What if he bites me?

755
00:59:47,101 --> 00:59:50,100
Why are you scared? He looks so handsome.
It's OK even if he bites.

756
00:59:50,101 --> 00:59:52,680
What is that meeting they are having there?

757
00:59:53,143 --> 00:59:53,976
I don't know brother.

758
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:58,185
Why delay girl? He is waiting
since morning. Send her fast.

759
00:59:58,226 --> 01:00:01,892
What is your problem to give a small kiss?

760
01:00:01,893 --> 01:00:04,267
If you can't.. I will go
and give him. Tell me.

761
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:09,810
As If we can't do that.
- Bro Should I come and give you the kiss?

762
01:00:10,018 --> 01:00:16,768
Who is that? Calling me brother and
offering me a kiss. Where did you find them?

763
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:19,351
Stop those discussions and send her fast.

764
01:00:22,101 --> 01:00:24,350
She is coming bro.. She is Coming.

765
01:00:24,351 --> 01:00:28,476
He is asking for a small kiss. We should
have thought of it, when we took the money..

766
01:00:33,351 --> 01:00:34,976
Keshava, close the door.

767
01:00:35,143 --> 01:00:36,768
No, keep it open.

768
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:40,060
What are you doing here dirty fellow?

769
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:44,142
I'm noticing you since long.
Why are you shouting? Stop those antics..

770
01:00:44,143 --> 01:00:45,393
I will slap you hard idiot.

771
01:00:45,435 --> 01:00:49,101
Do it fast Pushpa and let's go. Girls,
turn away.

772
01:00:50,393 --> 01:00:52,935
Okay dear, as you wish!
- No touching!

773
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:54,893
Oh no!

774
01:00:57,226 --> 01:00:58,851
What is that?

775
01:01:00,476 --> 01:01:02,268
Cardamom.

776
01:01:02,601 --> 01:01:04,726
Not there. I will kiss you here.

777
01:01:05,143 --> 01:01:06,310
Here?
; - Yes.

778
01:01:06,393 --> 01:01:09,310
Why should we pay so much for a kiss here?
Hey Keshava.

779
01:01:09,393 --> 01:01:11,476
OK OK. Don't make it an issue..

780
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:16,810
OK give me..

781
01:01:16,893 --> 01:01:18,434
Talk something.

782
01:01:18,435 --> 01:01:23,476
What is there to talk? You took
money to kiss me. Right.. So kiss me..

783
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:37,600
Why are you crying girl? Why?

784
01:01:37,601 --> 01:01:44,185
I thought it is easy when my friends
told me. But my heart isn't agreeing.

785
01:01:48,101 --> 01:01:53,060
How will I understand if you murmur?
Say it clearly

786
01:01:53,185 --> 01:01:56,726
I always wanted to give
first kiss to my husband...

787
01:01:56,810 --> 01:02:03,601
If you wanted to give it to your husband or someone, why
did you take money from me? And why are you crying now?

788
01:02:03,685 --> 01:02:06,476
Stop crying... Stop it

789
01:02:07,226 --> 01:02:08,851
why are you crying now?

790
01:02:08,935 --> 01:02:10,476
What happened dear? My god.

791
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,393
What did you do brother?

792
01:02:11,435 --> 01:02:15,494
I didn't do anything brother. I didn't even touch her.
- What did you do? Why is the poor girl crying so much?

793
01:02:15,518 --> 01:02:19,060
Ask Srivalli. Hey Srivalli.
Did I do anything to you?

794
01:02:19,393 --> 01:02:21,369
We trusted and sent our friend,
and is that what you do to her?

795
01:02:21,393 --> 01:02:22,577
Stop your nuisance for a minute

796
01:02:22,601 --> 01:02:25,810
I didn't do anything brother.
Tell them that I didn't do anything.

797
01:02:33,726 --> 01:02:36,310
Leave it bro. She said she
will kiss her husband only right.

798
01:02:36,476 --> 01:02:39,518
It's my kiss man. I paid for it.

799
01:02:39,935 --> 01:02:43,768
If I have to marry her and become her
husband, I will. I should only get that kiss..

800
01:02:43,935 --> 01:02:46,310
I won't compromise on this.

801
01:02:54,851 --> 01:02:57,725
Hey what is this? The
entire stock is still here.

802
01:02:57,726 --> 01:03:00,619
Didn't I tell you that we must cross
the check post with this by the night?

803
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:02,893
Jalanna was partying the whole night.

804
01:03:03,018 --> 01:03:07,268
He has stopped the lorries as they might
disturb his sleep

805
01:03:07,393 --> 01:03:11,935
have your brains gone dead? Who is
Jaali to stop the stock the stock movement?

806
01:03:12,976 --> 01:03:15,934
Police are observing us like
Jackals for this address since night,

807
01:03:15,935 --> 01:03:17,268
and you know how risky it is..

808
01:03:18,101 --> 01:03:20,685
Where are the keys?

809
01:03:20,726 --> 01:03:23,185
That is Jalanna's room.
He will kill if we give you the keys.

810
01:03:23,268 --> 01:03:24,685
What will he do?

811
01:03:26,101 --> 01:03:28,101
Pushpa, What are you doing?

812
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:48,783
Hey Keshav,

813
01:03:49,393 --> 01:03:52,893
please ask our guys to
drop her in the village safely.

814
01:03:53,268 --> 01:03:54,268
Go...

815
01:04:02,185 --> 01:04:04,367
Pushpa has sent the girl home.

816
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:07,051
We are packing A grade
stock into a different lorry.

817
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:08,701
Why did you send the girl?

818
01:04:08,726 --> 01:04:11,350
First tell me why you
didn't you send the stock.

819
01:04:11,351 --> 01:04:13,976
Have you converted the godown into...?

820
01:04:14,018 --> 01:04:18,184
Who are you to ask me? This is my godown
you are just a daily wages idiot.

821
01:04:18,185 --> 01:04:20,976
How dare you call me daily wage worker?

822
01:04:21,001 --> 01:04:25,868
This is Pushpa.
Partner Pushpa. 4 Percent share.

823
01:04:26,076 --> 01:04:27,076
Give it now.

824
01:04:27,101 --> 01:04:28,185
Speak to him brother.

825
01:04:28,435 --> 01:04:30,851
Pushpa,
Konda reddy brother wants to speak to you.

826
01:04:33,185 --> 01:04:36,345
Don't you use what you have above neck
instead of what you have below the waist?

827
01:04:37,101 --> 01:04:38,726
Bro, please tell.

828
01:04:39,185 --> 01:04:42,726
Police have come to
know our godown address.

829
01:04:44,518 --> 01:04:46,143
What are you saying brother?

830
01:04:51,143 --> 01:04:52,619
Hope all the stock is
cleared from the godown.

831
01:04:52,643 --> 01:04:56,518
No brother. Your brother Jaali has stopped
all lorries from entering the godown.

832
01:04:57,143 --> 01:05:02,185
My god! Thousand tons stock. It is worth 250
crores. We will be done forever if we are caught.

833
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:07,851
Mangalam Srinu has trusted
us and handed over the stock.

834
01:05:10,101 --> 01:05:11,310
Someone save us.

835
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:15,560
You have trusted me and handed over to me..
Consider Pushpa is dead, if even one log is caught..

836
01:05:17,768 --> 01:05:20,017
How scared he is, the slave!

837
01:05:20,018 --> 01:05:23,685
How dare you, you'll get it now! Doesn't
budge an inch, always gives it back!

838
01:05:27,268 --> 01:05:29,893
How do we tackle this?

839
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:52,510
Rey... Rey... Pick the stock
and throw it in the stream.

840
01:05:53,518 --> 01:05:58,310
What are you looking at? Police are coming.
Get up and move.

841
01:07:15,476 --> 01:07:19,559
Brother, you didn't listen to me. Entire
stock is being thrown into water here.

842
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:21,310
That is Mangalam Srinu's Stock.

843
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:25,393
We can put it on Pushpa
if Govindappa catches it.

844
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:28,040
Not good for you to be there now.
Leave from there immediately.

845
01:09:25,643 --> 01:09:27,600
This fellow Pushpa is caught now.
Srinanna will not leave him now

846
01:09:27,601 --> 01:09:29,060
I am sure his time is over now..

847
01:09:43,143 --> 01:09:45,935
Brother... Log.

848
01:10:13,893 --> 01:10:16,726
Sir, here the money.. Take this
and close the gates immediately.

849
01:10:37,297 --> 01:10:39,964
Sir, come on fast...

850
01:11:09,704 --> 01:11:14,370
Sir, They have put towers in the entire forest.
They would have known the information by now.

851
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:21,162
Rey... Is stock there?
- Sir, nothing is there here. Total license wood.

852
01:11:21,245 --> 01:11:24,565
If Pushpa is there stock will not be there.
If stock is there Pushpa won't be there.

853
01:11:24,829 --> 01:11:28,287
If you want to see both together,
none of you will be there.

854
01:11:29,412 --> 01:11:32,870
We should all be thankful to Govindappa Sir!
- Yes Bro.

855
01:11:33,037 --> 01:11:35,704
Our range has grown
because of this sir only...

856
01:11:35,745 --> 01:11:39,537
If he had caught the stock that day,
I wouldn't have become a partner today..

857
01:11:39,745 --> 01:11:42,537
Don't say like that
brother? Sir may get angry.

858
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:46,037
What sir? Are you getting angry??

859
01:11:46,495 --> 01:11:49,995
Alas... I don't even have
shirt for you to hold my collar.

860
01:11:50,204 --> 01:11:54,745
I have given it to a girl just now.
Not just you sir, we also do good deeds

861
01:11:54,787 --> 01:11:57,912
Rey... You are not understanding
what you are doing...

862
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:01,495
You are more cruel than animals... Yak.

863
01:12:01,704 --> 01:12:03,954
What is crueler than this world sir?

864
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:09,079
This world has given a gun to your hand
and an axe to my hand.

865
01:12:09,162 --> 01:12:10,995
Everyone has his own war to fight.

866
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:16,787
I have won this war also sir.

867
01:12:26,588 --> 01:12:29,380
Yes, You have won.

868
01:12:30,329 --> 01:12:32,454
But do you know what
kind of war you are fighting?

869
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:39,079
You will lose as much as you are
winning today. You will know as you age..

870
01:12:47,245 --> 01:12:49,994
Losers will always talk about principles.

871
01:12:49,995 --> 01:12:50,829
Yes Bro.

872
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:52,620
When does the party start?

873
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:56,745
Heard about Mangalam Srinu party,
but first time I am seeing it.

874
01:12:57,537 --> 01:13:02,662
Not only smugglers but police,
politicians all have come to party.

875
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:06,579
When one saw so much money
Pushpa has become hero instantly.

876
01:13:07,245 --> 01:13:10,995
Mangalam Srinu himself
personally introduced him to MP.

877
01:13:14,954 --> 01:13:18,454
They kill me with their
looks if I wear a saree.

878
01:13:18,704 --> 01:13:22,329
They scan me with
their eyes if I wear a skirt.

879
01:13:22,454 --> 01:13:26,120
Forget saree and gown,
let me divulge a secret.

880
01:13:26,245 --> 01:13:29,953
What is there in the dress
when It's your hold that matters.

881
01:13:29,954 --> 01:13:33,537
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No.

882
01:13:37,495 --> 01:13:41,079
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No.

883
01:13:44,954 --> 01:13:48,495
One becomes upside down if I'm fair.

884
01:13:48,704 --> 01:13:52,287
One creates uproar if I'm dark.

885
01:13:52,454 --> 01:13:56,079
Forget fair and dark,
let me reveal the true color.

886
01:13:56,204 --> 01:13:59,870
Color and figure won't
matter once you enter the field.

887
01:13:59,912 --> 01:14:03,495
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No.

888
01:14:07,412 --> 01:14:10,995
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No.

889
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:33,329
One jumps with joy If I'm tall.

890
01:14:33,787 --> 01:14:37,162
One shouts and wails if I'm short.

891
01:14:37,537 --> 01:14:40,995
Forget tall and short,
let me tell you a truth.

892
01:14:41,037 --> 01:14:44,954
You will be satiated with what you get.

893
01:14:45,079 --> 01:14:48,662
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No.

894
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:55,954
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No.

895
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:03,370
One feels happy If I'm stout.

896
01:15:03,537 --> 01:15:07,120
One feel bliss If I'm slender.

897
01:15:07,287 --> 01:15:11,036
Forget stout and slender.

898
01:15:11,037 --> 01:15:14,829
It is the man's wicked
nature who caught me alone.

899
01:15:14,954 --> 01:15:18,537
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No.

900
01:15:22,454 --> 01:15:26,037
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No.

901
01:15:52,454 --> 01:15:56,036
One person poses like a respected man...

902
01:15:56,037 --> 01:15:59,870
I have a very good heart says one person.

903
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:03,828
There is no good or bad,
everyone belongs to the same race

904
01:16:03,829 --> 01:16:06,245
when the lights are off...

905
01:16:11,162 --> 01:16:14,912
when the lights are off...

906
01:16:14,954 --> 01:16:18,537
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say Yes.

907
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:25,954
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No.

908
01:16:37,329 --> 01:16:41,454
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No.

909
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,744
Mangalam Sreenu has arranged a super party.

910
01:16:47,745 --> 01:16:51,704
He will get 2 crores from us
and give only 25 lakhs to them.

911
01:16:51,829 --> 01:16:54,870
Then, not only party, he can do anything.

912
01:17:03,954 --> 01:17:08,412
Brother, I want to speak to you urgently.
- What is that?

913
01:17:12,829 --> 01:17:18,579
That Mangalam Srinu is cheating us bro.
Mangalam srinu is fooling us.

914
01:17:18,912 --> 01:17:22,370
How much does he give us per ton?
Twenty-five lakhs right.

915
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:25,329
He is selling for Two crores outside..

916
01:17:27,037 --> 01:17:28,662
How do you know?

917
01:17:29,662 --> 01:17:34,620
I have heard from the Murugan's people
when they were talking to each other

918
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,745
of late I was also getting doubt on him...

919
01:17:39,912 --> 01:17:44,662
He is buying lands in lot of places.
What do you say now?

920
01:17:45,245 --> 01:17:47,411
Nothing to say. Let's go and ask.

921
01:17:47,412 --> 01:17:49,162
We are loosing so much bro..

922
01:17:49,579 --> 01:17:53,244
We are all working hard and he is sitting
and enjoying all the fruits. Ask him Brother.

923
01:17:53,245 --> 01:17:55,245
What? You want to go and
ask Mangalam Srinu is it?

924
01:17:55,704 --> 01:17:57,329
Yes.
- Do you know what he is?

925
01:17:57,412 --> 01:17:59,037
Hey Stop... You stop.

926
01:18:00,454 --> 01:18:06,662
You Can go and ask but there are lot
of other things between me and Srinu.

927
01:18:07,079 --> 01:18:09,787
We will get into trouble
if anything goes wrong.

928
01:18:10,662 --> 01:18:13,329
What is this? Go and get Vadas..

929
01:18:14,787 --> 01:18:20,912
Do one thing man. You go and ask him
that people are talking like this outside.

930
01:18:21,245 --> 01:18:22,579
You are also partner right.

931
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:26,954
If he agrees 50% share...

932
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:31,495
else, you didn't ask me anything.
There is no relationship between us.

933
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:33,620
What do you say?

934
01:18:35,537 --> 01:18:38,870
Then... No Brother. If anyone
has to ask him, it is you brother.

935
01:18:39,329 --> 01:18:40,829
It won't look good if I ask.

936
01:18:40,954 --> 01:18:42,162
That's why...

937
01:18:43,495 --> 01:18:46,370
Hey Muniratnam did you see Pushpa's range.

938
01:18:46,704 --> 01:18:48,971
He is having lunch with Kondareddy...
and he also doing business with him.

939
01:18:48,995 --> 01:18:49,954
You said it right.

940
01:18:49,955 --> 01:18:53,870
He used to come to work for a wage of hundred,
hundred and fifty. Now he has become very big.

941
01:18:54,162 --> 01:18:57,744
Where will you get a better match
for your daughter than him.

942
01:18:57,745 --> 01:18:59,385
Why don't you get her married to our guy?

943
01:18:59,954 --> 01:19:03,162
How did you say such a big thing
so easily in a serious discussion?

944
01:19:03,615 --> 01:19:06,162
How can I give my daughter
without knowing his caste and gotra?

945
01:19:06,187 --> 01:19:09,829
Hello... Do you know who he is? He is
younger son of Molleti Venkata Ramana.

946
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:13,704
Is that so? Then he is our own.
Good match.

947
01:19:16,912 --> 01:19:18,787
Munirathnam, The groom family is here.

948
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:19,620
Please come in.

949
01:19:19,745 --> 01:19:21,369
Namaste!

950
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:23,329
See, How Muniratnam face is glowing.

951
01:19:23,412 --> 01:19:26,452
Our lives are such that we feel happy
if Molleti Venkataramana says hi to us.

952
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:29,870
A match with such family means...
Its all god grace.

953
01:19:30,037 --> 01:19:31,037
Here!

954
01:19:33,370 --> 01:19:34,911
What are you looking at?
Move...

955
01:19:34,912 --> 01:19:35,495
come in please.

956
01:19:35,496 --> 01:19:37,162
Sit... please sit down.

957
01:19:37,287 --> 01:19:38,744
Hey, you go.

958
01:19:38,745 --> 01:19:40,619
What did you guys tell him?
He is talking strangely.

959
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:41,995
What did you say?

960
01:19:42,204 --> 01:19:45,119
That's what Bro. I told him that you are
third son of Molleti Venkataramana.

961
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,495
Did you say like that?

962
01:19:46,829 --> 01:19:49,203
I'm somehow getting scared.

963
01:19:49,204 --> 01:19:51,744
What's wrong? Did he
not tell what the truth is...?

964
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:53,287
Not like that my son.
- Be silent Mom.

965
01:19:53,454 --> 01:19:54,537
(CHANTS)

966
01:19:58,162 --> 01:19:59,870
Bro. Srivalli is coming.

967
01:20:02,912 --> 01:20:03,995
(CHANTS)

968
01:20:27,787 --> 01:20:29,204
The girl is looking beautiful.

969
01:20:29,287 --> 01:20:31,411
Girl, I had told you earlier
only. It was just a small kiss.

970
01:20:31,412 --> 01:20:33,244
You should have given it to him.
See it has come up to marriage.

971
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:37,454
Now you have to keep kissing him for life.
That too for free.

972
01:20:44,204 --> 01:20:45,537
You...!

973
01:20:47,162 --> 01:20:53,994
Pushparaj, the youngest son of Kempapura resident Molleti
Venkata Ramana and the resident of chandamanana Halli village...

974
01:20:53,995 --> 01:20:57,244
We have seen the people
who sell fruits in the name of the tree.

975
01:20:57,245 --> 01:21:02,870
We came here knowing that someone is selling fruits
without even know which tree has given those fruits.

976
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:06,204
They are Venkataramana's sons.

977
01:21:07,204 --> 01:21:08,536
Greetings Sir.

978
01:21:08,537 --> 01:21:11,953
They say that you have check seven generations that side and seven
generations this side when you want enter into relationship with someone.

979
01:21:11,954 --> 01:21:14,354
Why is it that you are not looking
at even to one generation?

980
01:21:14,495 --> 01:21:16,995
Do you know to whom you are giving
your daughter for marriage?

981
01:21:17,454 --> 01:21:18,579
What are saying sir?

982
01:21:18,829 --> 01:21:20,912
He said he is third son of
Molleti Venkata Ramana.

983
01:21:21,204 --> 01:21:22,537
Isn't he your younger brother?

984
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:24,744
Will someone become king just
because he has Raju in his name?

985
01:21:24,745 --> 01:21:26,704
And my brother if he
takes my father's name?

986
01:21:26,829 --> 01:21:28,745
He is anyways shameless to say it.

987
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,995
She is a lady shouldn't she have any shame?

988
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,079
Son, you sit quietly.
Swear on me that you won't get up.

989
01:21:37,037 --> 01:21:39,204
Ey. Give me that Ration card.

990
01:21:41,829 --> 01:21:47,494
Have you seen what is in that?
Did you see any surname?

991
01:21:47,495 --> 01:21:51,162
No Sir, its only written as Pushpa raju.

992
01:21:51,204 --> 01:21:52,412
That's the story.

993
01:21:52,745 --> 01:21:57,120
He is surviving by using our surname.

994
01:21:58,787 --> 01:22:01,203
So what if he doesn't have surname,
what is it that Pushpa doesn't have...?

995
01:22:01,204 --> 01:22:04,870
He has a house and earns handful.
Isn't it enough to take care of your girl?

996
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:05,995
What do you say Muniratnam?

997
01:22:05,996 --> 01:22:07,036
You said it rightly

998
01:22:07,037 --> 01:22:07,870
what will he take care?

999
01:22:07,871 --> 01:22:10,037
Do you think wedding
is just exchanging vows?

1000
01:22:10,329 --> 01:22:12,662
We get a girl married
to change her surname.

1001
01:22:12,870 --> 01:22:15,537
I won't send her to such house.

1002
01:22:15,745 --> 01:22:16,537
Get up dear.

1003
01:22:16,538 --> 01:22:18,828
You wait... listen to me.

1004
01:22:18,829 --> 01:22:20,329
You sit my dear. Sit.

1005
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:25,704
Hey Son, you both are brothers
and you share the same blood..

1006
01:22:25,954 --> 01:22:30,287
When such good occasions are happening,
one should overlook and move on.

1007
01:22:31,162 --> 01:22:32,245
I agree with you

1008
01:22:32,537 --> 01:22:35,161
I agree that my father had
an affair with his mother.

1009
01:22:35,162 --> 01:22:38,412
But what is the guarantee
that he is born to my father?

1010
01:22:44,204 --> 01:22:45,912
My father didn't tell me.

1011
01:22:47,745 --> 01:22:48,745
What man?

1012
01:22:48,829 --> 01:22:51,229
Did your mother at least tell you to
whom you are born? What?

1013
01:22:53,495 --> 01:22:54,495
Bro, stop.

1014
01:22:54,829 --> 01:22:55,829
Bro!

1015
01:22:56,995 --> 01:22:59,912
(COMMOTION)

1016
01:23:02,287 --> 01:23:05,204
(COMMOTION)

1017
01:23:07,412 --> 01:23:08,412
Pushpa!
- Bro, Mother...

1018
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:09,787
Bro, Mother...

1019
01:23:14,912 --> 01:23:15,912
Mom!

1020
01:23:18,204 --> 01:23:19,204
Mom!

1021
01:23:21,454 --> 01:23:22,454
Mom!

1022
01:23:26,954 --> 01:23:28,787
Keshava, get the vehicle.

1023
01:23:52,954 --> 01:23:53,995
Throw her out!

1024
01:23:56,079 --> 01:23:57,245
Please...

1025
01:24:00,454 --> 01:24:01,287
I plead you...

1026
01:24:01,412 --> 01:24:02,704
Leave me alone.

1027
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:05,079
Mom!

1028
01:24:15,162 --> 01:24:17,870
Please... let me see his face once.

1029
01:25:33,954 --> 01:25:40,954
When your father asked me weather I want love
or respect, then I thought love was enough.

1030
01:25:42,245 --> 01:25:44,954
I thought his respect is mine too.

1031
01:25:46,745 --> 01:25:51,829
But I never thought you will face
so many insults because of this.

1032
01:25:55,412 --> 01:26:03,412
Had I known it, I would have taken
some poison when you were in my womb.

1033
01:26:06,412 --> 01:26:07,412
Mom!

1034
01:26:08,287 --> 01:26:10,079
Please forgive me, my son.

1035
01:26:10,287 --> 01:26:13,328
What is this maa? What are you talking?
What happened now?

1036
01:26:13,329 --> 01:26:16,995
You have injuries on your head that's
why you are talking like this.. Sleep now.

1037
01:26:17,287 --> 01:26:19,120
Grand Mother... Please maker her sleep.

1038
01:26:19,329 --> 01:26:22,829
Don't cry my dear. Drink some porridge.

1039
01:26:23,412 --> 01:26:24,495
Mom...

1040
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:35,537
Get some tea. Do you have money?
- I have bro.

1041
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:47,912
I was just five-year-old then.

1042
01:26:50,204 --> 01:26:51,829
I didn't even know how to fight.

1043
01:26:54,620 --> 01:26:58,787
These guys have created all kinds of
troubles and took away whatever we had.

1044
01:27:13,579 --> 01:27:18,245
My father had given me a
gold chain for my birthday.

1045
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:23,287
In that chain there used to
be photo of me and my father.

1046
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:28,287
That was the only thing I had
as a memory in those things.

1047
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,870
They took away that as well.

1048
01:27:38,204 --> 01:27:40,954
They took away everything
that belonged to me.

1049
01:27:44,537 --> 01:27:49,245
I won't keep silent if they try to
take away what I have to get..

1050
01:27:50,912 --> 01:27:54,037
Whether it is 10 paise or 10 rupees.

1051
01:27:55,037 --> 01:27:56,329
I won't spare anyone.

1052
01:27:57,079 --> 01:28:00,953
I won't spare anyone, even if its Srinivasa
on the hill or Mangalam Srinu down the hill.

1053
01:28:00,954 --> 01:28:03,787
I will collect everything with interest.

1054
01:28:06,370 --> 01:28:07,579
This is Pushpa.

1055
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:09,245
Pushparaj here.

1056
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:11,954
I won't compromise.

1057
01:28:14,662 --> 01:28:16,161
Beat him here... not there

1058
01:28:16,162 --> 01:28:17,328
I have already beaten him there bro.

1059
01:28:17,329 --> 01:28:18,911
Beat him on his knee?

1060
01:28:18,912 --> 01:28:19,954
On his knee's bro?

1061
01:28:21,079 --> 01:28:24,744
That hand... Mouth...
Beat him on the mouth.

1062
01:28:24,745 --> 01:28:25,911
Idiot shouldn't open his mouth again.

1063
01:28:25,912 --> 01:28:27,911
Bro... He is scared.

1064
01:28:27,912 --> 01:28:29,162
That's why I asked you to beat.

1065
01:28:29,579 --> 01:28:35,412
How dare he comes directly to me
and ask me to increase the rate?

1066
01:28:42,370 --> 01:28:46,995
It seems, Twenty-five is not enough
for him.. He wants fifty lakhs per ton.

1067
01:28:47,329 --> 01:28:49,411
Fifty... Do you want Fifty lakhs?

1068
01:28:49,412 --> 01:28:52,870
If I don't give, you want to deal
with Chennai Murugan directly?

1069
01:28:53,704 --> 01:28:57,537
Why can't you beat him yourself?
You are sitting happily and Ordering him?

1070
01:28:58,412 --> 01:29:01,912
Bro... Stop now. Drink
this and take a breath.

1071
01:29:02,454 --> 01:29:04,374
Haven't you got tired
beating him since morning?

1072
01:29:04,662 --> 01:29:06,787
Unnecessary fuss all the time.

1073
01:29:07,079 --> 01:29:09,037
She talks like that only. You carry on...

1074
01:29:09,954 --> 01:29:10,954
Hello MP Sir.

1075
01:29:11,287 --> 01:29:13,120
Come Pushpa. Sit.

1076
01:29:13,412 --> 01:29:14,412
Yes. Tell me MP Sir.

1077
01:29:14,413 --> 01:29:17,162
Hey Srinu. Heard that you kidnapped Nagesh.

1078
01:29:17,370 --> 01:29:19,995
His brother came and is regretting
for the mistake that happened.

1079
01:29:20,787 --> 01:29:21,912
Leave him for this time.

1080
01:29:22,370 --> 01:29:23,579
I will speak to you.

1081
01:29:23,704 --> 01:29:26,037
So sad... I just killed him MP Sir.

1082
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:27,620
Brother...

1083
01:29:28,412 --> 01:29:30,370
You should have called me five minutes ago.

1084
01:29:31,245 --> 01:29:35,244
I'm just washing the knife after
cutting his neck and your call came..

1085
01:29:35,245 --> 01:29:38,013
I had called your PA also in the
morning Sir. He also didn't say anything.

1086
01:29:38,037 --> 01:29:41,412
Hello MP Sir, please tell me in advance
if there is something like this next time.

1087
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:43,096
It's a matter of a person's life. Isn't it?

1088
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:46,829
I don't want any differences
between you and me unnecessarily.

1089
01:29:48,204 --> 01:29:50,162
How are you Pushpa?
- I'm fine, Sister.

1090
01:29:50,995 --> 01:29:52,328
Everyone speaks good
about you in our house.

1091
01:29:52,329 --> 01:29:53,620
Hey Nagesh.

1092
01:29:54,537 --> 01:29:59,912
I have given a word to the big man on the
other side. I will go wrong if I leave you.

1093
01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:04,245
Hey, Cut him into pieces.

1094
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:12,994
You guys have spoilt the entire floor...

1095
01:30:12,995 --> 01:30:15,287
Hey Venkatesu...

1096
01:30:16,162 --> 01:30:18,328
What Pushpa? What made you come to me?

1097
01:30:18,329 --> 01:30:19,453
How is Kondareddy?

1098
01:30:19,454 --> 01:30:20,204
He is fine Brother.

1099
01:30:20,392 --> 01:30:21,976
Brother, I have mixed the color.

1100
01:30:22,579 --> 01:30:23,787
What is this? Is this black?

1101
01:30:23,954 --> 01:30:24,995
Yes, black brother.

1102
01:30:25,495 --> 01:30:28,494
Last time also you had said it
was black but had turned brown.

1103
01:30:28,495 --> 01:30:30,662
It was so awkward in front of everyone.

1104
01:30:31,079 --> 01:30:34,319
It just happened like that last time
brother. This time it will be black for sure.

1105
01:30:34,412 --> 01:30:37,870
I don't have confidence in you.
Put on him and show.

1106
01:30:39,245 --> 01:30:40,454
Apply on him.

1107
01:30:42,037 --> 01:30:45,037
See Pushpa, how he died struggling.

1108
01:30:45,204 --> 01:30:47,745
Else, he wanted Fifty lakhs per ton.

1109
01:30:47,912 --> 01:30:52,120
All you have to do is to cross two
check posts and deliver stocks to me.

1110
01:30:52,287 --> 01:30:56,454
I must cross fifteen check posts
to transport the stock to Chennai.

1111
01:30:56,495 --> 01:30:57,721
Can you imagine how difficult it is?

1112
01:30:57,745 --> 01:30:59,785
I agree brother,
It is a very difficult job indeed.

1113
01:30:59,995 --> 01:31:03,245
Even I faced difficulty
near fifteenth check post.

1114
01:31:03,412 --> 01:31:06,620
That SI Manikandan you know right.

1115
01:31:07,037 --> 01:31:08,245
That fellow.

1116
01:31:08,787 --> 01:31:13,745
Somehow, we made sure the
stock reached Chennai safely brother.

1117
01:31:17,495 --> 01:31:19,704
Have delivered the stock to Chennai?

1118
01:31:21,454 --> 01:31:23,328
Who told you to do that?

1119
01:31:23,329 --> 01:31:25,953
No Brother. The twenty-five
lakhs you give is not enough.

1120
01:31:25,954 --> 01:31:28,245
If you give one crore per ton,
I will sell to you only.

1121
01:31:28,787 --> 01:31:30,412
Crore?
What is it bro?

1122
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:32,287
If I say I no...

1123
01:31:34,204 --> 01:31:35,870
Whom did he say he will sell brother?

1124
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:37,412
Chennai Murugan.

1125
01:31:37,537 --> 01:31:38,994
I will sell it to him only.

1126
01:31:38,995 --> 01:31:40,221
Why should I go to a new person?

1127
01:31:40,245 --> 01:31:41,805
Hey, do you understand what you are asking?

1128
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:43,596
We just cut his neck
for asking fifty lakhs only.

1129
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:46,430
And here you are asking for one crore.
Don't you see what just happened...?

1130
01:31:46,454 --> 01:31:47,245
I understand man.

1131
01:31:47,412 --> 01:31:49,495
I came here to ask fifty lakhs only.

1132
01:31:49,870 --> 01:31:52,620
But after seeing him, I understood
how high the risk is..

1133
01:31:52,662 --> 01:31:55,079
That's why I am asking for a crore...
Am I right brother?

1134
01:31:56,370 --> 01:32:01,454
Brother, Tell me weather you can one crore per ton.
Otherwise, I will sell to Chennai Murugesan only.

1135
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:10,162
All of you think about it and call me.

1136
01:32:10,454 --> 01:32:12,537
Okay?
I take leave brother.

1137
01:32:13,954 --> 01:32:18,119
Oh! What is this bro?

1138
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:22,870
This is black for sure.
Don't worry and get it applied.

1139
01:32:39,495 --> 01:32:41,537
Brother, why did you leave him like that?

1140
01:32:42,745 --> 01:32:45,995
You are coming and asking me,
half an hour after he left?

1141
01:32:46,370 --> 01:32:49,770
I was in shock that he was speaking like
that even after seeing what death looks like.

1142
01:32:51,079 --> 01:32:53,329
Do you think I was in a dream sequence
with your sister?

1143
01:32:54,412 --> 01:32:56,204
I was also in a shock.

1144
01:32:57,412 --> 01:32:59,453
We have left him unnecessarily bro.
We should have killed him.

1145
01:32:59,454 --> 01:33:00,703
What do you say Shankarreddy?

1146
01:33:00,704 --> 01:33:01,704
Yes, Brother.

1147
01:33:26,037 --> 01:33:28,370
Brother, Can I make a call?

1148
01:33:38,329 --> 01:33:39,329
Brother... Murugan.

1149
01:33:39,412 --> 01:33:40,412
Greetings Bro.

1150
01:33:40,912 --> 01:33:43,579
This is syndicate member Pushpa speaking.

1151
01:33:45,662 --> 01:33:48,870
This time we don't want to
sell stock to Mangalam Srinu.

1152
01:33:50,787 --> 01:33:52,537
Thinking of selling it to you directly.

1153
01:33:53,537 --> 01:33:55,162
OK... OK Brother.

1154
01:33:55,870 --> 01:33:58,037
Stock has already reached Chennai Sir.

1155
01:33:59,829 --> 01:34:03,620
I will come to Chennai tomorrow
and discuss rate with you.

1156
01:34:04,162 --> 01:34:06,620
OK. Write down my pager number brother.

1157
01:34:07,704 --> 01:34:10,495
Eight Three... Eight four...
Yeah four.

1158
01:35:04,370 --> 01:35:06,287
You fool!

1159
01:35:07,162 --> 01:35:09,495
I didn't left because you spared me.

1160
01:35:10,662 --> 01:35:13,162
I left because I decided to leave.

1161
01:35:13,537 --> 01:35:14,537
What?

1162
01:35:15,245 --> 01:35:17,620
You thought Pushpa means flower...

1163
01:35:18,329 --> 01:35:19,412
It's Fire!

1164
01:35:20,787 --> 01:35:21,912
Fire!

1165
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:49,578
Who are you? What do you want?

1166
01:35:49,579 --> 01:35:51,036
We have come to meet Murugan.

1167
01:35:51,037 --> 01:35:51,620
Is it?

1168
01:35:51,621 --> 01:35:53,370
Hey... who are they?

1169
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:55,829
Pushpa, Syndicate member.

1170
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:59,079
Came from Tirupati to discuss business.

1171
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:02,036
Hey, say Pager No. 8384.

1172
01:36:02,037 --> 01:36:03,203
He will recognize us with that.

1173
01:36:03,204 --> 01:36:04,494
Why are you shouting in my ear?

1174
01:36:04,495 --> 01:36:08,454
Hey, Murugan Sir is busy and
he said he can't meet anyone.

1175
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:09,620
You heard it right!

1176
01:36:09,704 --> 01:36:12,244
Murugan Sir won't meet anyone. Leave now.

1177
01:36:12,245 --> 01:36:15,912
Let him say that after seeing this piece.

1178
01:36:16,370 --> 01:36:17,370
What is this?

1179
01:36:17,412 --> 01:36:20,954
This is Bro's visiting card.
He will understand if he looks at it.

1180
01:36:30,162 --> 01:36:31,244
Its 07:45 PM.

1181
01:36:31,245 --> 01:36:32,786
It's tea time for Murugan sir.

1182
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:34,427
Quickly go and give a tea to Murugan sir.

1183
01:36:34,787 --> 01:36:37,704
Hey, Tea won't go anywhere.

1184
01:36:38,783 --> 01:36:40,450
Murugan himself will come to tea.

1185
01:36:48,204 --> 01:36:49,245
What is this man?

1186
01:36:50,329 --> 01:36:51,329
A grade stock.

1187
01:36:51,995 --> 01:36:54,662
I had seen it long back
when I started the business.

1188
01:36:55,745 --> 01:36:57,162
I'm seeing it again now.

1189
01:36:57,954 --> 01:36:59,079
This is gold.

1190
01:36:59,829 --> 01:37:02,161
How many hills we have to climb up
to see lord Venkateswara...

1191
01:37:02,162 --> 01:37:05,204
Likewise that many hills you need
to climb down to find this kind of stuff.

1192
01:37:06,037 --> 01:37:07,329
This is A grade Stuff.

1193
01:37:07,870 --> 01:37:11,787
The smuggler who buys never knows its value The
one who the cuts the tree knows the exact value.

1194
01:37:52,912 --> 01:37:55,745
Two tons... five trucks
We have ten tons of stock.

1195
01:37:55,954 --> 01:37:56,995
Super man!

1196
01:37:58,704 --> 01:38:02,120
Will speak to Mangalam
Srinu and fix the rate. You leave.

1197
01:38:02,329 --> 01:38:05,787
Brother, We have decided not to sell
the stock to Mangalam Srinu.

1198
01:38:06,370 --> 01:38:08,579
That is why we came
directly to sell it to you.

1199
01:38:08,704 --> 01:38:10,579
That's why we brought it this far.

1200
01:38:10,787 --> 01:38:12,079
Do you want stock or not?

1201
01:38:19,495 --> 01:38:21,204
Hey, close the door.

1202
01:38:21,329 --> 01:38:22,787
Start the vehicles...
- Bro.. Bro...

1203
01:38:23,704 --> 01:38:26,662
Mangalam Srinu is very dangerous.

1204
01:38:27,412 --> 01:38:30,412
Can you do business defying him?

1205
01:38:33,454 --> 01:38:36,203
Can you buy the stock defying him?

1206
01:38:36,204 --> 01:38:39,037
Any who came here defying Mangalam Srinu
and they are all dead.

1207
01:38:40,037 --> 01:38:42,329
Brother, many would have come to you.

1208
01:38:42,787 --> 01:38:46,787
I called from Srinanna's place only and
told you that I am coming to you.

1209
01:38:47,662 --> 01:38:48,454
I'm different bro.

1210
01:38:48,579 --> 01:38:50,454
Who are you? Are you a crack?

1211
01:38:51,412 --> 01:38:54,162
Do you know to whom you are talking to?

1212
01:38:54,495 --> 01:38:55,995
I am Kondareddy's partner.

1213
01:38:56,662 --> 01:38:59,204
Konda Reddy himself
sent me here to talk to you.

1214
01:38:59,370 --> 01:39:04,745
Are you Kondareddy's man?
You should have told me that earlier.

1215
01:39:04,787 --> 01:39:09,245
Call him. Let me speak once.

1216
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:14,037
That, only after negotiating the price..

1217
01:39:14,454 --> 01:39:15,704
Tell me what is the rate?

1218
01:39:17,495 --> 01:39:18,204
Hello!

1219
01:39:18,370 --> 01:39:19,454
Brother Kondareeddy.

1220
01:39:19,745 --> 01:39:21,912
Hey Pushpa. Didn't see
you for the last 2 days.

1221
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:23,120
Where did you go?

1222
01:39:23,162 --> 01:39:24,329
I came to Chennai?

1223
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:26,787
Chennai? Why??

1224
01:39:27,287 --> 01:39:29,120
I came here to meet Murugan.

1225
01:39:29,329 --> 01:39:30,454
To meet Murugan?

1226
01:39:30,870 --> 01:39:32,954
Hey Jakka.
He says he went to meet Murugan.

1227
01:39:35,287 --> 01:39:38,162
Whose permission did you take
to go to Murugan? Why did you go?

1228
01:39:38,329 --> 01:39:41,120
What bro? Doesn't Kondareddy know
that we came here?

1229
01:39:44,412 --> 01:39:48,579
Just because we gave 4% share,
you want to act as you wish?

1230
01:39:49,912 --> 01:39:50,912
One and half crore...

1231
01:39:57,745 --> 01:40:00,412
One and half crore per ton.

1232
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:02,787
I just negotiated the deal with Murugan.

1233
01:40:03,079 --> 01:40:06,204
As usual, do you want me to sell to
Mangalam Srinu for twenty-five lakhs

1234
01:40:06,370 --> 01:40:08,810
or take risk and sell it to
Murugan for one and half crore...

1235
01:40:13,537 --> 01:40:15,037
Understood bro.

1236
01:40:15,912 --> 01:40:23,037
I will tell Muragan brother that you
can't do business defying Mangalam Srinu.

1237
01:40:23,079 --> 01:40:24,839
I will tell him that we
don't have the guts.

1238
01:40:25,329 --> 01:40:27,870
I held back for all these days not because
I don't have guts.

1239
01:40:28,162 --> 01:40:30,579
I stopped because I was
bound by Syndicate's decision.

1240
01:40:30,829 --> 01:40:35,120
When we know that Mangalam Srinu is
cheating us, who cares for the syndicate?

1241
01:40:35,329 --> 01:40:36,704
Finalize the deal.

1242
01:40:41,511 --> 01:40:42,511
Brother...

1243
01:40:42,594 --> 01:40:48,261
50% share to me and 50% to you from the profits.
You remember we agreed on this the other day.

1244
01:40:49,761 --> 01:40:52,927
OK. I'm giving the phone to him.

1245
01:40:58,094 --> 01:41:00,636
How dare you information to police
about us.. You idiot?

1246
01:41:07,261 --> 01:41:11,101
What is the point of talking to him brother, when
he was informing everything about us to Police.

1247
01:41:16,427 --> 01:41:18,267
I don't have anything
to do with it.. Brother.

1248
01:41:18,552 --> 01:41:19,969
He did everything.

1249
01:41:20,552 --> 01:41:22,052
You knew, that he was doing all this.

1250
01:41:26,469 --> 01:41:27,510
I know, brother.

1251
01:41:27,511 --> 01:41:28,671
Why didn't you not inform us?

1252
01:41:31,094 --> 01:41:34,386
He lured me with money.

1253
01:41:35,636 --> 01:41:38,386
I got greedy in the hope to
perform my daughter's marriage.

1254
01:41:39,302 --> 01:41:40,302
Daughter?

1255
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:41,844
Who is that?

1256
01:41:42,302 --> 01:41:43,927
Does he have a grown up daughter...?

1257
01:41:44,386 --> 01:41:47,636
Same one brother, the one you saw
when she came to theatre.. That one..

1258
01:41:48,011 --> 01:41:50,219
Is she, his daughter?

1259
01:41:51,511 --> 01:41:53,968
Isn't she beautiful? I saw her from far.

1260
01:41:53,969 --> 01:41:56,636
She looks just OK bro.

1261
01:41:58,302 --> 01:42:00,927
Then ask her to come once.
We shall talk to her.

1262
01:42:04,844 --> 01:42:05,844
Lay him down here.

1263
01:42:07,261 --> 01:42:09,511
Rey, You guys go and get his parents.

1264
01:42:10,261 --> 01:42:10,761
My...

1265
01:42:11,094 --> 01:42:12,094
Where is my father?

1266
01:42:12,427 --> 01:42:13,719
What happened to him.

1267
01:42:15,052 --> 01:42:15,636
I'm asking you.

1268
01:42:15,761 --> 01:42:16,927
What happened to my father?

1269
01:42:17,136 --> 01:42:18,136
Tell me.

1270
01:42:18,427 --> 01:42:19,507
What happened to my father?

1271
01:42:21,594 --> 01:42:25,094
Rey Marappa, you said she is just OK.

1272
01:42:26,094 --> 01:42:28,844
But she is looking
superb like a film heroine.

1273
01:42:29,844 --> 01:42:31,469
Your father is alive.

1274
01:42:31,511 --> 01:42:36,761
But go home and have a bath with lux soap.

1275
01:42:37,219 --> 01:42:42,469
Wear this saree with jasmine flowers
and come here in the night.

1276
01:42:42,761 --> 01:42:44,801
Then, You can take your
father home in the morning.

1277
01:42:45,136 --> 01:42:47,511
Get ready like a bride
for Jalanna and come.

1278
01:42:48,386 --> 01:42:52,261
What? Can't you adjust for one night
for the sake of your father's life?

1279
01:42:53,761 --> 01:42:54,761
Take it.

1280
01:42:56,427 --> 01:42:58,011
Go... Go.

1281
01:44:16,636 --> 01:44:17,261
Hey!

1282
01:44:17,469 --> 01:44:17,969
Bro!

1283
01:44:18,386 --> 01:44:21,886
Go out and have some beer and biryani.
Come back in the morning.

1284
01:44:21,927 --> 01:44:22,636
OK bro.

1285
01:44:22,761 --> 01:44:25,636
Rey, we can do this in the morning.
Let's go. Rey. Let's go.

1286
01:44:51,261 --> 01:44:52,761
How come you came here dear?

1287
01:44:54,219 --> 01:44:55,635
Have you lost your way?

1288
01:44:55,636 --> 01:44:58,094
Jalreddy is saying
that he will kill my father.

1289
01:44:58,969 --> 01:45:01,969
Why Jalreddy?
Even I would kill him.

1290
01:45:03,052 --> 01:45:05,136
How could your father
show loyalty to the Police?

1291
01:45:05,386 --> 01:45:09,177
He said he will spare him,
if I sleep with him tonight.

1292
01:45:15,219 --> 01:45:16,677
You came all decked up right.

1293
01:45:17,219 --> 01:45:20,052
Go there.
Why did you come here?

1294
01:45:22,677 --> 01:45:27,136
If I go there tonight, my father might
return home in the morning...

1295
01:45:27,969 --> 01:45:29,969
but I will not be able to
come to your house ever.

1296
01:45:30,011 --> 01:45:32,811
Why do you want to come to the house of
a guy who doesn't have surname?

1297
01:45:32,886 --> 01:45:34,801
You must have felt happy
on the day the relation broke.

1298
01:45:34,802 --> 01:45:39,042
You must have felt very happy that you have gotten rid
of me, and you don't need to see my face ever again.

1299
01:45:39,969 --> 01:45:41,427
Is this what you understood?

1300
01:45:42,636 --> 01:45:44,344
You are like this, from the beginning.

1301
01:45:44,677 --> 01:45:47,886
When did you ever understood the heart
of a girl that you can understand today.

1302
01:45:49,969 --> 01:45:54,011
When my friends told me that you are feeling
sad, because I was not looking at you,

1303
01:45:54,636 --> 01:45:58,802
I felt very happy that
this boy likes me so much.

1304
01:45:59,969 --> 01:46:01,427
I liked you as soon as I saw you.

1305
01:46:06,136 --> 01:46:08,011
When you gave me money
and asked for a kiss...

1306
01:46:08,219 --> 01:46:12,969
I thought this is your
way of expressing love.

1307
01:46:15,511 --> 01:46:18,427
When I said that I want to
give first kiss to my husband,

1308
01:46:19,802 --> 01:46:23,927
I gave an indication to you to marry me.

1309
01:46:24,886 --> 01:46:26,552
You didn't understand even that.

1310
01:46:27,802 --> 01:46:30,177
My father doesn't even
start the lorry without my nod.

1311
01:46:30,552 --> 01:46:34,261
Do you think you could come to my house
for marriage proposal without my wish?

1312
01:46:35,761 --> 01:46:42,344
Do you know how bad I felt seeing
you anxious when mother-in-law got hurt?

1313
01:46:42,927 --> 01:46:45,594
You could have understood that,
had you seen into my eyes once.

1314
01:46:46,594 --> 01:46:48,034
You left even without looking at me.

1315
01:46:48,344 --> 01:46:54,344
Do you mean to say, that I should change my heart after hearing
whatever you said and go fight with jaali and save your father?

1316
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:56,218
It is not going to happen.
Leave now

1317
01:46:56,219 --> 01:46:58,844
I know that you won't
do anything like that.

1318
01:46:59,802 --> 01:47:02,002
Your money and business
are important to you. Isn't it?

1319
01:47:02,302 --> 01:47:05,969
Why will you fight for a stranger like me?

1320
01:47:07,677 --> 01:47:10,511
Anyways, I didn't come for that.

1321
01:47:10,552 --> 01:47:11,552
Then why did you come?

1322
01:47:20,261 --> 01:47:28,261
I always wanted to share my first kiss and my first
night with someone whom I consider my husband.

1323
01:47:33,844 --> 01:47:36,011
Please sleep with me once.

1324
01:47:36,802 --> 01:47:39,386
You will never see me again.

1325
01:47:41,469 --> 01:47:42,636
I will go.

1326
01:47:44,427 --> 01:47:46,552
And after that I don't care
what happens to my life.

1327
01:47:52,094 --> 01:47:53,094
What is this dear?

1328
01:47:54,677 --> 01:47:56,594
Do you love me so much?

1329
01:47:59,136 --> 01:48:02,719
You think I will allow anyone to lay
his hand on you after what you said.

1330
01:48:05,011 --> 01:48:06,594
Whoever it is..

1331
01:48:11,427 --> 01:48:13,052
Will not allow.

1332
01:48:21,719 --> 01:48:22,927
What Pushpa?

1333
01:48:24,136 --> 01:48:26,844
You only brought the girl
to make her sleep with me.

1334
01:48:27,719 --> 01:48:30,052
Are you doing all this for just 4 percent?

1335
01:48:45,052 --> 01:48:46,052
You...!

1336
01:48:46,802 --> 01:48:48,011
I won't leave her.

1337
01:50:16,427 --> 01:50:19,511
Are you firing?

1338
01:50:20,511 --> 01:50:21,511
Dear, Come here.

1339
01:50:22,011 --> 01:50:25,011
Are you firing bullets on to the girl?

1340
01:50:52,136 --> 01:50:53,136
Muniratnam.

1341
01:50:53,719 --> 01:50:54,844
Muniratnam, get up!

1342
01:51:09,344 --> 01:51:13,177
Look Srivalli, your father is fine.
I made him sit in the car.

1343
01:51:13,636 --> 01:51:18,177
What is this man?
You have hit Jalreddy so badly.

1344
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:22,136
O Jalanna. I feel pity looking at you.

1345
01:51:22,344 --> 01:51:25,261
What Bro?
You made him incapable for anything.

1346
01:51:25,802 --> 01:51:28,511
If Kondareddy gets to know if this,
he will kill you bro.

1347
01:51:28,886 --> 01:51:31,927
Hey, who will tell?
This fellow only should say if at all...

1348
01:51:32,052 --> 01:51:35,551
What man? What will you tell your brother?

1349
01:51:35,552 --> 01:51:40,636
Will you go cry before him and
tell him shamelessly that Pushpa beat you.

1350
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:45,052
Ey Jaali, Go and complain.
I don't care.

1351
01:51:45,136 --> 01:51:46,886
Dear, come let's go.

1352
01:51:46,969 --> 01:51:49,510
We will get it resolved either this way or
that way. I'm ready for whatever happens.

1353
01:51:49,511 --> 01:51:54,802
Pushpa, I'm not an idiot to go
and complain to my brothers.

1354
01:51:56,761 --> 01:51:59,177
This is between you and me...

1355
01:52:00,927 --> 01:52:04,052
and I will deal about
this with you directly.

1356
01:52:05,261 --> 01:52:06,760
I won't leave you.

1357
01:52:06,761 --> 01:52:10,635
This.. This ..This ..This is
what is called as being a man.

1358
01:52:10,636 --> 01:52:15,844
What you did with women
all these days is not like a man.

1359
01:52:16,386 --> 01:52:18,969
Now you have proven that you are a man.

1360
01:52:19,136 --> 01:52:20,761
Now stand on your word.

1361
01:52:21,011 --> 01:52:24,094
Kesava, he has masculinity in him.

1362
01:52:24,469 --> 01:52:26,261
I think he will stand on his word.

1363
01:52:26,761 --> 01:52:29,176
What dear? What do you think?

1364
01:52:29,177 --> 01:52:30,802
I too believe the same.

1365
01:52:31,011 --> 01:52:32,385
He will stand on his word right.

1366
01:52:32,386 --> 01:52:34,706
How will he stand,
when you have already broken everything.

1367
01:52:43,636 --> 01:52:45,969
Muniratnam, Come... come.

1368
01:52:51,094 --> 01:52:52,927
Pushpa,
I will park the car at home and come.

1369
01:52:59,886 --> 01:53:00,886
Mom!

1370
01:53:06,052 --> 01:53:07,468
Srivalli, I will take leave.

1371
01:53:07,469 --> 01:53:08,469
Pushpa!

1372
01:53:08,802 --> 01:53:10,636
Come and have dinner.

1373
01:53:11,052 --> 01:53:12,094
No need Aunty.

1374
01:53:12,802 --> 01:53:16,386
My mom is waiting for me... I have to go.

1375
01:53:16,427 --> 01:53:17,844
Pushpa, wait a minute.

1376
01:53:18,177 --> 01:53:19,177
You come.

1377
01:53:28,761 --> 01:53:29,761
What is it?

1378
01:53:29,844 --> 01:53:31,284
My mom asked me to give this to you.

1379
01:53:33,511 --> 01:53:34,511
Okay.

1380
01:53:36,094 --> 01:53:37,094
You go.

1381
01:53:41,344 --> 01:53:42,802
Why are you staring at me?

1382
01:53:43,094 --> 01:53:44,094
Go.

1383
01:53:46,802 --> 01:53:47,802
What?

1384
01:53:51,886 --> 01:53:52,969
What...?

1385
01:53:57,427 --> 01:54:00,968
When you call me Dear... Dear,
I feel like I have become your wife.

1386
01:54:00,969 --> 01:54:03,886
Darling... My Darling.

1387
01:54:04,386 --> 01:54:07,926
When I call you Darling... Darling,
you suit well as my Husband.

1388
01:54:07,927 --> 01:54:10,844
Darling... My Darling.

1389
01:54:11,136 --> 01:54:13,802
When I walk behind you.

1390
01:54:14,552 --> 01:54:16,469
When I walk behind you.

1391
01:54:16,511 --> 01:54:19,219
It feels like going uphill
to Venkanna Temple, Darling.

1392
01:54:19,677 --> 01:54:21,677
When I sit next to you.

1393
01:54:21,719 --> 01:54:24,636
It feels like I got Lord Parameshwara.

1394
01:54:24,886 --> 01:54:28,426
When I look at the path as you leave
It is as if the lake has dried up.

1395
01:54:28,427 --> 01:54:31,344
Darling... My Darling.

1396
01:54:31,636 --> 01:54:34,469
My Darling... Come here Darling.

1397
01:54:34,886 --> 01:54:38,219
Darling with Golden Heart...
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions.

1398
01:54:38,344 --> 01:54:41,136
My Darling... Come here Darling.

1399
01:54:41,719 --> 01:54:45,052
Darling with Golden Heart...
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions.

1400
01:54:59,677 --> 01:55:05,719
When you tie lungi above the thighs...

1401
01:55:06,594 --> 01:55:09,885
When you tie lungi above the thighs...

1402
01:55:09,886 --> 01:55:12,261
My breath gets stopped Darling.

1403
01:55:13,177 --> 01:55:16,718
When you are chewing a Jarda Pan.

1404
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:19,636
My body gets painted Red... Darling.

1405
01:55:19,677 --> 01:55:22,427
When I hear your yells and roars...

1406
01:55:30,011 --> 01:55:33,386
When I hear your yells and roars...
It thrills me like hell...

1407
01:55:33,511 --> 01:55:36,885
When you sit cross legged,
it mesmerizes me.

1408
01:55:36,886 --> 01:55:40,551
When you take out two buttons and show your
chest won't it overflow like a milk Pot.

1409
01:55:40,552 --> 01:55:43,677
My Darling... my Darling.

1410
01:55:43,719 --> 01:55:46,511
My Darling... Come here Darling.

1411
01:55:46,927 --> 01:55:50,261
Darling with Golden Heart...
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions.

1412
01:55:50,344 --> 01:55:53,136
My Darling... Come here Darling.

1413
01:55:53,552 --> 01:55:56,886
Darling with Golden Heart...
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions.

1414
01:56:11,677 --> 01:56:16,844
When I wear a new saree
and you don't complement.

1415
01:56:18,344 --> 01:56:21,927
When I wear a new saree
and you don't complement.

1416
01:56:21,969 --> 01:56:24,469
Wouldn't that saree value become zero,
Darling...

1417
01:56:25,219 --> 01:56:28,885
When I wear flowers in my hair
And if you don't smell them.

1418
01:56:28,886 --> 01:56:31,469
Wouldn't the flower mound fall down.

1419
01:56:31,844 --> 01:56:35,052
When my saree frill slips down.

1420
01:56:41,969 --> 01:56:45,426
When my saree frill slips down,
and you won't look at me.

1421
01:56:45,427 --> 01:56:48,886
The naughty wind would sympathize with me,
Darling.

1422
01:56:48,927 --> 01:56:52,718
If my beauty doesn't become yours,
my life as girl would become poor.

1423
01:56:52,719 --> 01:56:55,676
Darling... my Darling.

1424
01:56:55,677 --> 01:56:58,469
My Darling... Come here Darling.

1425
01:56:58,886 --> 01:57:02,219
Darling with Golden Heart...
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions.

1426
01:57:02,302 --> 01:57:05,094
My Darling... Come here Darling.

1427
01:57:05,511 --> 01:57:08,844
Darling with Golden Heart...
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions.

1428
01:57:19,261 --> 01:57:21,302
Bro, Operation to the spine it seems.

1429
01:57:21,636 --> 01:57:24,594
Doctor is saying only after that
he can say if he can walk or not.

1430
01:57:29,219 --> 01:57:31,052
He won't say who hit him.

1431
01:57:31,636 --> 01:57:32,886
And you people don't know.

1432
01:57:33,469 --> 01:57:34,469
Is that right?

1433
01:57:34,594 --> 01:57:35,594
Yes Brother.

1434
01:57:40,719 --> 01:57:42,218
Bro... Bro... Bro.

1435
01:57:42,219 --> 01:57:43,968
Whom did he sleep with last night?

1436
01:57:43,969 --> 01:57:46,510
Muniratnam daughter came... Bro.

1437
01:57:46,511 --> 01:57:51,010
Muniratnam daughter came in the night and
went back in the morning with her father.

1438
01:57:51,011 --> 01:57:53,011
Then, who hit him?

1439
01:58:02,969 --> 01:58:06,385
Bro, looks like Kondareddy wants
to kill the guy who thrashed Jalreddy,

1440
01:58:06,386 --> 01:58:09,706
once he gets to know who did it.. Ignoring
that, you are looking at Pager and money.

1441
01:58:10,011 --> 01:58:13,427
Only six months? For the trashing I gave
him, He should not get up for one year.

1442
01:58:13,677 --> 01:58:16,177
I think I haven't given him enough...

1443
01:58:16,844 --> 01:58:20,302
Bro, Jalreddy still has some masculinity
left in him. That is why he didn't name you.

1444
01:58:20,677 --> 01:58:22,427
What If Kondareddy gets to know this...

1445
01:58:22,511 --> 01:58:25,386
I lost my count..
How will Kondareddy get to know?

1446
01:58:26,594 --> 01:58:30,219
What Pushpa?
Has the stock reached Murugan?

1447
01:58:30,969 --> 01:58:33,320
Reached Bro. He sent the message too.
Just reached it seems.

1448
01:58:33,344 --> 01:58:37,427
OK. We should go to Tirupati tomorrow
and get the money.

1449
01:58:37,844 --> 01:58:40,801
That Hawala slip is with you, only right?
- It is safe with me.

1450
01:58:40,802 --> 01:58:41,927
Be ready in the morning

1451
01:58:43,469 --> 01:58:44,789
what is that injury on your hand?

1452
01:58:44,969 --> 01:58:47,219
This... Our.
- That... Got scratched when coming in car.

1453
01:58:48,094 --> 01:58:49,552
Be careful man. OK...

1454
01:58:49,969 --> 01:58:51,093
What Subbareddy?
- Bro...

1455
01:58:51,094 --> 01:58:53,427
Did you get the jeep tyres changed?
- Got it Changed bro.

1456
01:58:55,469 --> 01:58:57,052
What should I do?

1457
01:58:57,636 --> 01:59:01,386
Bro. Do you think he heard?
- No, He didn't.

1458
01:59:01,636 --> 01:59:04,344
No Bro. I have a doubt
that he must have heard..

1459
01:59:04,802 --> 01:59:08,385
I will do one thing. I will go out
and close the door and wait there..

1460
01:59:08,386 --> 01:59:10,761
You speak something.
I will see if can hear it or not.

1461
01:59:12,969 --> 01:59:14,636
Bro... Speak.. Speak

1462
01:59:23,469 --> 01:59:24,802
bro, I could not hear anything.

1463
01:59:25,594 --> 01:59:26,969
I didn't speak anything.

1464
01:59:31,094 --> 01:59:33,844
What man... What is this?
- Mosquitos Bro.

1465
01:59:33,886 --> 01:59:35,052
What?
- Mosquitos.

1466
01:59:36,011 --> 01:59:38,385
Be careful man. Too many mosquitos here.
What if we get Dengue Fever?

1467
01:59:38,386 --> 01:59:42,927
I'm going to Tirupati on work...
Do you want anything?

1468
01:59:43,386 --> 01:59:45,386
Don't you know what I want?

1469
01:59:46,052 --> 01:59:47,844
Your hands look good.

1470
01:59:48,719 --> 01:59:50,511
Should I bring you gold ring?

1471
01:59:54,052 --> 01:59:56,511
What? Don't you like gold ring?

1472
01:59:57,927 --> 01:59:59,094
What do you want?

1473
02:00:00,386 --> 02:00:03,761
You are staring at me with eyes wide open.
What happened?

1474
02:00:04,136 --> 02:00:05,552
What are you doing?

1475
02:00:06,469 --> 02:00:08,177
- Going to Tirupati on work.

1476
02:00:08,636 --> 02:00:10,302
What are you doing now?

1477
02:00:10,761 --> 02:00:12,136
Looking at you.

1478
02:00:12,529 --> 02:00:13,737
Where is your hand?

1479
02:00:13,904 --> 02:00:16,071
What?
- Where is your hand?

1480
02:00:17,362 --> 02:00:20,071
Oh. Did my hand touch you? Sorry dear.

1481
02:00:21,696 --> 02:00:24,237
You didn't remove
It is still there.

1482
02:00:24,654 --> 02:00:26,614
I was talking on the phone.. Here,
I removed it..

1483
02:00:26,862 --> 02:00:29,946
I didn't realise it because I
was busy talking on phone.

1484
02:00:30,071 --> 02:00:32,029
You didn't know, is it?
You didn't know?

1485
02:00:32,154 --> 02:00:34,528
You didn't know, is it?
- Hey... Why are you hitting me, dear?

1486
02:00:34,529 --> 02:00:36,361
Don't talk... I'll not come again.

1487
02:00:36,362 --> 02:00:38,278
What happened?
- Don't talk.

1488
02:00:38,279 --> 02:00:39,987
I'm leaving now.

1489
02:00:40,446 --> 02:00:43,778
I came here to see your face before
going for money collection.

1490
02:00:43,779 --> 02:00:45,529
Do you know how excitedly I came? What?

1491
02:00:46,071 --> 02:00:49,154
Did I come to get hit by you? I will go.

1492
02:00:49,321 --> 02:00:52,778
Stop Darling...
- I'll go...

1493
02:00:52,779 --> 02:00:53,820
- This is all waste business.

1494
02:00:53,821 --> 02:00:55,487
Stop Darling.
- I will leave.

1495
02:00:55,571 --> 02:00:58,404
What Darling? You only did it
and now you are only getting angry.

1496
02:00:59,321 --> 02:01:02,986
Why did you hit me? See... Again,
you are getting angry.

1497
02:01:02,987 --> 02:01:04,654
Hold it darling.

1498
02:01:05,779 --> 02:01:08,487
No, you will again abuse me.
- Hold it, Darling.

1499
02:01:08,737 --> 02:01:11,321
No, Thanks.
- Hold it, Darling.

1500
02:01:13,779 --> 02:01:14,779
Thanks.

1501
02:01:17,446 --> 02:01:19,779
I will stay, you go dear... go dear...

1502
02:01:25,362 --> 02:01:27,362
Srivalli... Srivalli.

1503
02:01:28,696 --> 02:01:30,071
OK Darling... I leave now.

1504
02:01:30,321 --> 02:01:34,571
Hey. What are you doing dear?
They will find it.

1505
02:01:35,696 --> 02:01:39,416
See, if your friend asks, tell her that we were
just talking. Don't tell her all these things.

1506
02:01:39,904 --> 02:01:40,862
It will spoil my reputation.

1507
02:01:40,863 --> 02:01:42,404
OK, Darling. I know.

1508
02:01:44,821 --> 02:01:46,529
It's time for work.

1509
02:01:49,404 --> 02:01:51,571
What dear? Looks like
a lot happened inside.

1510
02:01:51,696 --> 02:01:52,446
Nothing.

1511
02:01:52,447 --> 02:01:55,028
Hey Srivalli.
Ask Pushpa to have tiffin and go.

1512
02:01:55,029 --> 02:01:57,529
He had tiffin aunty. He had it just now.

1513
02:01:57,779 --> 02:01:59,361
Can't you see it?

1514
02:01:59,362 --> 02:02:00,362
Srivalli!

1515
02:02:00,571 --> 02:02:01,821
Careful darling.

1516
02:02:02,612 --> 02:02:04,029
Darling!

1517
02:02:11,654 --> 02:02:13,112
Someone is coming.

1518
02:02:13,571 --> 02:02:15,237
Pushpa come... please come.

1519
02:02:15,404 --> 02:02:17,321
Shetji, are you fine?

1520
02:02:18,487 --> 02:02:20,279
How are you?
- Fine sir.

1521
02:02:21,321 --> 02:02:22,321
How are you?

1522
02:02:22,446 --> 02:02:23,987
I am fine.

1523
02:03:01,779 --> 02:03:02,820
You go... I'll come.

1524
02:03:02,821 --> 02:03:04,421
Pushpa... look, new models have arrived.

1525
02:03:25,321 --> 02:03:27,529
Pushpa, go to new godown.

1526
02:03:38,904 --> 02:03:46,904
(SONG HUMMING)

1527
02:03:53,779 --> 02:03:58,195
How did you hear what
I was singing to myself?

1528
02:03:58,196 --> 02:04:01,487
Why can't I hear? You think we can't
hear whatever you guys speak inside?

1529
02:04:01,779 --> 02:04:08,737
Leave that. When you and Pushpa were talking of beating
Jalreddy, me and Kondareddy sir heard from outside.

1530
02:04:08,904 --> 02:04:11,029
What did you say? Move aside.

1531
02:04:20,821 --> 02:04:22,279
Max Pager Services.

1532
02:04:22,779 --> 02:04:25,529
Sister, have to send a message urgently.

1533
02:04:25,737 --> 02:04:26,777
Please tell me the number?

1534
02:05:14,487 --> 02:05:15,487
Get him up.

1535
02:05:17,987 --> 02:05:21,404
What man? Did you forget who we are?

1536
02:05:22,696 --> 02:05:25,861
Just because we gave you four percent share
and a seat next to us,

1537
02:05:25,862 --> 02:05:28,862
do you think we will remain silent
if you lay your hands on our brother?

1538
02:05:29,029 --> 02:05:31,612
I will kill you, idiot.

1539
02:05:32,196 --> 02:05:35,279
Hey. He has a 5 crore hawala
slip in his pocket. Search for it.

1540
02:05:36,487 --> 02:05:38,779
Why are you laughing?
- Hit the idiot. Hit him.

1541
02:05:39,237 --> 02:05:41,236
My brother is talking and
you are laughing at him.

1542
02:05:41,237 --> 02:05:42,820
Else what bro?

1543
02:05:42,821 --> 02:05:46,154
I thought you are killing
me because of your brother...

1544
02:05:46,571 --> 02:05:48,570
right now I got that you are
killing me because of money.

1545
02:05:48,571 --> 02:05:53,570
Now business is good, after killing me
you can takeover all the my share also.

1546
02:05:53,571 --> 02:05:55,821
Hey... to me nothing is
bigger than my brother.

1547
02:05:55,987 --> 02:05:59,362
It's a nice joke bro.
Maybe this is the last joke I will hear.

1548
02:05:59,654 --> 02:06:04,278
What are you searching man? I keep
it in the fold of my hand sleeve right.

1549
02:06:04,279 --> 02:06:05,695
We got the note.

1550
02:06:05,696 --> 02:06:07,820
Kondareddy bro,
you have become very commercial.

1551
02:06:07,821 --> 02:06:09,255
Hey Subbareddy. Is it the same note?

1552
02:06:09,279 --> 02:06:10,029
Yes Brother. It is the same note.

1553
02:06:10,071 --> 02:06:11,029
On which date do we get our money?

1554
02:06:11,071 --> 02:06:13,987
New title for you. Commercial Kondareddy.
Tag line-No Masculinity.

1555
02:06:15,571 --> 02:06:17,091
Hey, take him and throw him in the pit

1556
02:06:17,487 --> 02:06:22,237
I know brother, that these kind of businesses
will definitely see death some day.

1557
02:06:22,571 --> 02:06:27,487
If by mistake,
Lord Venkateswara supports me and saves me,

1558
02:06:27,696 --> 02:06:29,862
I will become a very big man for sure.

1559
02:06:30,154 --> 02:06:33,071
I will sit on the top.

1560
02:06:34,612 --> 02:06:37,071
Yes. I can visualize my future.

1561
02:06:41,196 --> 02:06:44,196
Why delay?
Shoot him up.

1562
02:07:29,404 --> 02:07:31,361
Hey, I will kill this Jakkareddy.

1563
02:07:31,362 --> 02:07:33,196
You guys go and kill that Pushpa.

1564
02:10:09,946 --> 02:10:10,946
Cut the rope.

1565
02:10:11,862 --> 02:10:12,862
Take the sickle.

1566
02:10:15,196 --> 02:10:16,196
Cut the rope quickly.

1567
02:10:22,571 --> 02:10:23,571
Quickly.

1568
02:10:27,862 --> 02:10:28,862
Come on cut the rope.

1569
02:10:42,654 --> 02:10:45,737
Pushpa, come fast.

1570
02:10:48,154 --> 02:10:49,987
Come fast, come on...

1571
02:11:05,487 --> 02:11:06,571
Catch him.

1572
02:11:08,529 --> 02:11:09,696
Kill him.

1573
02:11:18,279 --> 02:11:19,279
Hold on guys..

1574
02:11:25,696 --> 02:11:27,904
He is getting scared.. He is scared..

1575
02:11:35,612 --> 02:11:38,987
Bro, we found jakkareddy.

1576
02:11:39,071 --> 02:11:41,696
What are you waiting for? Kill him

1577
02:11:41,779 --> 02:11:42,797
I will cut his neck bro...

1578
02:11:42,821 --> 02:11:44,153
then what about that coolie?

1579
02:11:44,154 --> 02:11:47,279
You mean, that Pushpa?
Our men would have killed him by now bro...

1580
02:12:56,404 --> 02:12:58,654
What Jakkareddy?
What are you looking at me like that.

1581
02:12:59,112 --> 02:13:01,029
Is it because I came back?

1582
02:13:01,529 --> 02:13:03,696
You and I may have
million things between us...

1583
02:13:03,862 --> 02:13:07,487
but when an outsider comes,
you are my partner. That's it.

1584
02:13:07,612 --> 02:13:09,029
You think I will sit and watch?

1585
02:13:55,862 --> 02:13:57,862
What man... why are you
coming on to me like that.

1586
02:13:58,362 --> 02:14:01,071
If my brother-in-law comes to know of it
he won't leave you..

1587
02:14:01,237 --> 02:14:03,717
If you something harm to me,
my brother-in-law won't leave you.

1588
02:14:12,821 --> 02:14:14,781
Why are you taking out
the gun? Will you kill me?

1589
02:14:14,904 --> 02:14:18,005
My brother-in-law won't keep quite if you
do anything to me. He will kill all of you.

1590
02:14:18,029 --> 02:14:21,571
True Pushpa,
It will become a big mess if you touch him.

1591
02:14:21,862 --> 02:14:23,946
He is getting scared. He is getting scared.

1592
02:14:24,237 --> 02:14:25,862
Even I want to kill him Pushpa.

1593
02:14:28,946 --> 02:14:31,362
But no... Leave him.

1594
02:14:32,862 --> 02:14:34,196
Let this end with my brother.

1595
02:14:34,779 --> 02:14:37,236
He is getting scared... Scared.

1596
02:14:37,237 --> 02:14:39,737
That's all. Everyone should
fear my brother-in-law.

1597
02:14:39,862 --> 02:14:41,822
See... here my brother-in-law
himself is calling.

1598
02:14:43,654 --> 02:14:45,279
I will go. I will go away.

1599
02:14:45,487 --> 02:14:47,571
Hey Kesava... Start the vehicle.

1600
02:14:47,862 --> 02:14:48,862
Talk..

1601
02:14:49,112 --> 02:14:51,487
Talk to him... you are finished now.

1602
02:14:52,237 --> 02:14:53,987
What man Mogileesu?

1603
02:14:54,196 --> 02:14:55,362
Yeah, Srinu bro...

1604
02:14:56,071 --> 02:14:57,071
Pushpa!

1605
02:14:59,946 --> 02:15:02,654
Bro, they caught Mogileesu.

1606
02:15:05,571 --> 02:15:08,404
Look Pushpa. Listen to what I am saying..

1607
02:15:08,571 --> 02:15:12,946
Let us do business together..
That too at the rate you asked for.

1608
02:15:14,612 --> 02:15:17,862
We will discuss about the rest later.

1609
02:15:17,987 --> 02:15:20,987
Don't do anything to my brother-in-law.

1610
02:15:21,279 --> 02:15:22,279
Okay?

1611
02:15:22,446 --> 02:15:24,737
Areyrey... I just killed him bro.

1612
02:15:26,737 --> 02:15:28,654
You should have called me five minutes ego.

1613
02:15:31,154 --> 02:15:37,446
Life will not come back
once it is gone. Right, bro.

1614
02:15:37,487 --> 02:15:38,487
Brother in law...

1615
02:15:52,112 --> 02:15:53,487
Why are you silent, bro?

1616
02:15:54,571 --> 02:15:56,279
Wondering what that sound is?

1617
02:15:57,237 --> 02:16:00,362
You alone know that I
am not scared of anyone.

1618
02:16:01,112 --> 02:16:05,779
Now the entire market
will know with this sound.

1619
02:16:06,696 --> 02:16:11,029
Bro... Just keep it in your mind.

1620
02:16:11,529 --> 02:16:14,529
I didn't come here to mess with anyone.

1621
02:16:15,362 --> 02:16:19,362
I came here to rule.
I won't compromise.

1622
02:16:35,571 --> 02:16:36,571
Get in Pushpa!

1623
02:17:19,821 --> 02:17:22,571
Bro. Bro... That
Mangalam Srinu is coming...

1624
02:17:23,571 --> 02:17:27,029
He is coming here to die today.
Hey... Give me the gun.

1625
02:17:27,404 --> 02:17:30,571
Hey Jakka .. You hang on,
I asked Mangalam Srinu to come.

1626
02:17:30,612 --> 02:17:34,196
If you guys fight here,
the entire department will be here,

1627
02:17:34,446 --> 02:17:36,172
and I will get everyone
killed in an encounter.

1628
02:17:36,196 --> 02:17:37,987
So Let's settle the matter here...

1629
02:17:45,487 --> 02:17:46,737
Sir, Mangalam Seenu!

1630
02:18:08,321 --> 02:18:10,946
I will leave if my
brother-in-law's body is given.

1631
02:18:10,987 --> 02:18:13,487
You can go but, Sit first.

1632
02:18:17,071 --> 02:18:19,862
We were like brothers right.
Then What is this?

1633
02:18:19,946 --> 02:18:22,570
You should ask them all that.
It is they who have started all this.

1634
02:18:22,571 --> 02:18:25,047
What is it about starting?
It will not end till you are killed.

1635
02:18:25,071 --> 02:18:26,987
Hey Jakka. You stop...

1636
02:18:27,362 --> 02:18:29,945
Bro, First ask them why
they sold stock to Murugan...

1637
02:18:29,946 --> 02:18:33,071
Yes Bro. They sold the stock to Murugan
without Srinanna's knowledge.

1638
02:18:34,071 --> 02:18:37,779
Ray Jakka,
shouldn't everyone stick to the syndicate?

1639
02:18:37,821 --> 02:18:39,487
Why are you guys doing this?

1640
02:18:49,612 --> 02:18:52,196
How much is this?
- Three crores.

1641
02:18:53,529 --> 02:18:55,209
How much? How much did you sell a ton for?

1642
02:18:58,612 --> 02:18:59,737
One and half crore.

1643
02:19:02,404 --> 02:19:05,529
What is this? Is this true?

1644
02:19:05,654 --> 02:19:07,612
I will give all these calculations later

1645
02:19:08,279 --> 02:19:13,861
but what is this man? You not only killed by
brother-in-law, you are also complaining against me.

1646
02:19:13,862 --> 02:19:18,529
Hey, I didn't kill your brother-in-law. I
killed the person who killed Kondareddy Bro.

1647
02:19:19,112 --> 02:19:22,779
Do you think I will sit silently and watch when
someone attacks Jakkareddy bro with a knife?

1648
02:19:22,987 --> 02:19:25,279
I shot him.

1649
02:19:25,362 --> 02:19:27,195
You hold on man.
- Even I won't leave.. I will also kill.

1650
02:19:27,196 --> 02:19:29,380
What bro? Looks like both brothers-in-law's
are alike... Do you think we are scared?

1651
02:19:29,404 --> 02:19:31,571
What, you will kill? That too in front me.

1652
02:19:32,404 --> 02:19:35,196
Why are you giving the gun?
What is this? Why are you silent?

1653
02:19:35,821 --> 02:19:40,737
Bro .. I called him when he was about to
kill my brother-in-law. Still he killed him.

1654
02:19:40,904 --> 02:19:43,237
Maybe you also called
five minutes late like me.

1655
02:19:44,487 --> 02:19:46,362
But anyways, both sides have lost right?

1656
02:19:46,904 --> 02:19:51,571
Hey, put that gun away and
first explain the calculations.

1657
02:19:53,112 --> 02:19:55,904
Till now you said,
50 lakhs per ton.. Right?

1658
02:19:56,321 --> 02:19:57,961
Then how did he get a crore and half now?

1659
02:19:58,071 --> 02:19:59,320
We also asked him the same Sir?

1660
02:19:59,321 --> 02:20:02,380
Had he answered this, we wouldn't have gone to
Murugan and things wouldn't have come to this.

1661
02:20:02,404 --> 02:20:05,154
This big man has
screwed all of us so badly.

1662
02:20:05,946 --> 02:20:09,404
What bro Srinu? Why are you silent? Why
don't you answer when MP sir is asking you?

1663
02:20:09,529 --> 02:20:14,196
What is this? Should I explain accounts now?
Have you guys forgotten what all I did so far?

1664
02:20:14,362 --> 02:20:17,404
True Bro. Why are you
asking Srinanna accounts now?

1665
02:20:17,696 --> 02:20:19,653
How many people did he manage...?

1666
02:20:19,654 --> 02:20:21,611
How many check-posts he managed?

1667
02:20:21,612 --> 02:20:23,570
Won't you take all that into account?

1668
02:20:23,571 --> 02:20:26,654
Hello Sir. We are coming there only.

1669
02:20:27,071 --> 02:20:30,029
You are paying off the police.
We are also paying off the police.

1670
02:20:30,112 --> 02:20:33,029
All of you are giving commissions.
Above that,

1671
02:20:33,154 --> 02:20:39,779
we are also giving commissions to people in
Forest, revenue, ID... how will it work out?

1672
02:20:40,112 --> 02:20:42,321
We, together should pay them once only.

1673
02:20:42,612 --> 02:20:44,862
Then see how much will we save?

1674
02:20:45,112 --> 02:20:46,946
Twenty-five percent.

1675
02:20:47,237 --> 02:20:48,654
Which we were wasting.

1676
02:20:49,779 --> 02:20:53,529
Just by bypassing Seenanna and going directly
to Murugan, he paid us One and half crore.

1677
02:20:53,821 --> 02:20:58,154
If we all unite and fix a rate,
he will pay two crores at least.

1678
02:20:58,237 --> 02:20:59,862
What? Two crores??

1679
02:20:59,904 --> 02:21:02,196
Bro, the story doesn't stop here...

1680
02:21:02,279 --> 02:21:05,361
There is Chatterjee in Calcutta,
and who is that in Mumbai? Ya.. Singh,

1681
02:21:05,362 --> 02:21:08,446
then Agarwal in Delhi. I kept
more people like them, in line.

1682
02:21:09,237 --> 02:21:13,028
Bro, we have the kind of stock that
is not available anywhere in the world.

1683
02:21:13,029 --> 02:21:15,029
We have it here in Tirupati
in our Andhra Pradesh.

1684
02:21:15,154 --> 02:21:17,154
The kind that no one on this earth has.

1685
02:21:17,279 --> 02:21:20,070
With that kind of stock we have,
why should we go and ask them.

1686
02:21:20,071 --> 02:21:23,236
We should demand and create competition
amongst the buyers in the market,

1687
02:21:23,237 --> 02:21:25,279
Then they will buy our
stock standing in Queue.

1688
02:21:25,362 --> 02:21:28,071
We may get three crores per ton also.

1689
02:21:28,862 --> 02:21:33,071
If we go by that, our MP sir may get
at least 20 crores as commission.

1690
02:21:37,029 --> 02:21:40,112
Yes, Pushpa said it correctly,

1691
02:21:41,071 --> 02:21:44,320
If we hand over the syndicate to a person
like this, our business will be good.

1692
02:21:44,321 --> 02:21:47,945
It's easy to speak sitting on the shore.

1693
02:21:47,946 --> 02:21:50,321
You will know the depth
when you get into the water.

1694
02:21:52,321 --> 02:21:54,841
Pushpa Come man. Sit down
and tell the whole thing to MLA sir...

1695
02:22:00,321 --> 02:22:02,362
Give me one chance, Sir.

1696
02:22:02,946 --> 02:22:05,826
I will make sure that we see the
kind of profits that we have never seen.

1697
02:22:07,737 --> 02:22:11,029
What are you thinking Sir? Are you thinking,
where is my confidence is coming from?

1698
02:22:11,737 --> 02:22:14,137
None of the stock I have
transported so far was ever caught.

1699
02:22:14,779 --> 02:22:17,696
That is my capital. Trust me, Sir.

1700
02:22:18,946 --> 02:22:21,707
All of you are going with him just
because he sold two tons for more.

1701
02:22:22,112 --> 02:22:25,446
Two people are also dead in the last two
months since he has entered the business,

1702
02:22:26,571 --> 02:22:30,737
just think, how many more dead bodies
will we see In the coming days.

1703
02:22:31,571 --> 02:22:35,403
What bro? Do you want to believe everything this
youngster said and put the business in his hands?

1704
02:22:35,404 --> 02:22:38,987
Bro, I am not totally convinced.
- If we trust him, we all will go bankrupt.

1705
02:22:39,071 --> 02:22:41,529
Yes bro, Even I'm getting doubts

1706
02:22:43,571 --> 02:22:46,332
everything he did is right in front
of our eyes, can't you all see it?

1707
02:22:47,904 --> 02:22:50,487
Pushpa will manage the
syndicate from now onwards.

1708
02:22:50,737 --> 02:22:53,737
Everyone should sell
their stock to Pushpa only.

1709
02:22:58,946 --> 02:23:01,306
We will have an oath taking
ceremony in Kanipakam tomorrow.

1710
02:23:07,279 --> 02:23:08,779
Take this cash and go.

1711
02:23:16,696 --> 02:23:22,071
MP Sir, If they give me my
brother-in-law's body, I will go home.

1712
02:23:22,404 --> 02:23:26,320
Bro, From the time you came in,
you are sitting on his body only.

1713
02:23:26,321 --> 02:23:28,696
We will send his body
safely home if you get up.

1714
02:23:29,362 --> 02:23:31,737
Hey Selva,
help Seenanna in the preparations.

1715
02:23:58,737 --> 02:24:01,321
That side is mine... This side is mine...

1716
02:24:01,654 --> 02:24:04,196
The piece of sky above
my head is also mine.

1717
02:24:09,696 --> 02:24:12,362
That wrong is mine... This right is mine.

1718
02:24:12,571 --> 02:24:15,237
The fire that burns the
right and wrong is also me.

1719
02:24:20,696 --> 02:24:25,571
The one who can defeat me is not yet born on the
earth Even If he is born, it would be me again.

1720
02:24:26,279 --> 02:24:31,071
There is only one who can grow beyond me
And that's me, myself in the future.

1721
02:24:31,654 --> 02:24:34,528
If I twirl, it's my mustache
And I hold Axe in my hand...

1722
02:24:34,529 --> 02:24:37,404
Whatever I do is the war
And I never negotiate.

1723
02:24:40,112 --> 02:24:42,529
Hey Son... This is my bastion.

1724
02:24:45,446 --> 02:24:48,112
Hey Son... This is my bastion.

1725
02:25:01,779 --> 02:25:03,446
Will throw you in the lake.

1726
02:25:04,571 --> 02:25:06,279
And I return with a fish.

1727
02:25:07,321 --> 02:25:09,029
Will stick you to a pole.

1728
02:25:09,946 --> 02:25:11,862
And I hoist like a flag.

1729
02:25:12,862 --> 02:25:15,487
Will bury you in the soil
and make you disappear

1730
02:25:15,529 --> 02:25:19,904
I will be found again as an expensive ore.

1731
02:25:21,321 --> 02:25:23,779
Hey Son... This is my bastion.

1732
02:25:26,862 --> 02:25:29,321
Hey Son... This is my bastion.

1733
02:25:32,154 --> 02:25:34,612
Hey Son... This is my bastion.

1734
02:26:19,862 --> 02:26:21,404
What is this Draccha? ..

1735
02:26:21,821 --> 02:26:29,154
It is fifteen days since my brother died. And you
are sleeping like a log since then. How can you?

1736
02:26:29,779 --> 02:26:31,487
What should I do?

1737
02:26:32,154 --> 02:26:35,071
That Pushpa has grown too big,

1738
02:26:35,321 --> 02:26:37,154
and MP has also become a minister.

1739
02:26:37,571 --> 02:26:41,154
We can't do anything till the government
changes... We can't do anything..

1740
02:26:41,696 --> 02:26:46,654
Then you should have waited till the
government changed to send my brother to him.

1741
02:26:47,654 --> 02:26:55,446
Did I send him to get killed? I Sent him to kill...
What should I do if he died because of his incapability?

1742
02:26:56,737 --> 02:27:01,487
If so, you also couldn't kill him ..
Then, why are you still alive?

1743
02:27:01,529 --> 02:27:02,571
What is this Draksha?

1744
02:27:02,987 --> 02:27:05,237
Why are you still alive?

1745
02:27:10,946 --> 02:27:11,612
Hey!

1746
02:27:11,904 --> 02:27:12,571
Hey!

1747
02:27:12,904 --> 02:27:13,904
Hey!

1748
02:27:14,696 --> 02:27:15,321
Come, hurry...

1749
02:27:15,529 --> 02:27:17,321
Come... fast.

1750
02:27:18,404 --> 02:27:19,903
Hey you idiotic Husband...

1751
02:27:19,904 --> 02:27:21,111
Come back if you are alive.

1752
02:27:21,112 --> 02:27:23,236
We will together take revenge..

1753
02:27:23,237 --> 02:27:26,362
Or else I will go alone and kill him...

1754
02:27:26,404 --> 02:27:28,404
Who are you? Who are you?

1755
02:27:29,071 --> 02:27:30,946
I'm the iron I'm the iron

1756
02:27:31,279 --> 02:27:33,737
I will become a knife
if I'm put under fire.

1757
02:27:37,321 --> 02:27:39,321
Who are you? Who are you?

1758
02:27:39,821 --> 02:27:41,821
I'm the soil I'm the soil.

1759
02:27:42,279 --> 02:27:44,904
I will become a brick if you crush me.

1760
02:27:48,196 --> 02:27:50,196
Who are you? Who are you?

1761
02:27:50,904 --> 02:27:52,904
I'm the rock... I'm the rock.

1762
02:28:23,696 --> 02:28:25,696
It seems that Puspa is
getting married on the 11th.

1763
02:28:26,279 --> 02:28:27,737
This is not going to happen.

1764
02:28:28,404 --> 02:28:33,737
I will become the god
for sure If you hurt me.

1765
02:28:33,987 --> 02:28:36,529
Hey Son... This is my bastion.

1766
02:28:39,612 --> 02:28:42,154
Hey Son... This is my bastion.

1767
02:28:44,612 --> 02:28:47,154
Hey Son... This is my bastion.

1768
02:29:04,779 --> 02:29:11,529
With regret, Govindappa resigns and leaves,
claiming responsibility for Bhujanga's murder.

1769
02:29:12,404 --> 02:29:17,404
Even though Jal Reddy wants take revenge
badly, he was not in a state to get up.

1770
02:29:18,279 --> 02:29:22,487
Burning with vengeance,
Dakshayani was left helpless..

1771
02:29:25,112 --> 02:29:28,779
When everyone thought
that no one can touch Pushpa.

1772
02:29:30,071 --> 02:29:34,446
A new person enters,
And the whole story changes.

1773
02:30:01,571 --> 02:30:03,112
Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat!

1774
02:30:03,487 --> 02:30:06,612
There is nothing to say about him...
you are going to witness him.

1775
02:30:51,071 --> 02:30:55,487
It is strong Is it Sheelavathi or what?
- Yes sir...

1776
02:31:09,071 --> 02:31:15,987
Kupparaju Sir, Sheelavathi is strong.
- You get good quality here, Sir.

1777
02:31:16,946 --> 02:31:18,446
That's why I got asleep,

1778
02:31:22,362 --> 02:31:27,779
it came and It will come.

1779
02:31:29,029 --> 02:31:32,362
That's why I'm falling
asleep... I will sleep.

1780
02:31:47,321 --> 02:31:49,904
Did you give this to me?
- Yes sir.

1781
02:31:51,279 --> 02:31:53,696
What is your name?
- Kalesha sir.

1782
02:31:54,071 --> 02:31:55,862
What?
- Kalesha sir.

1783
02:32:21,529 --> 02:32:23,571
What is your name?

1784
02:32:24,779 --> 02:32:28,071
- De... De... Devaraju Sir...

1785
02:32:30,321 --> 02:32:31,446
Devaraju Sir...

1786
02:32:35,862 --> 02:32:42,071
Sir... Sir... Sir... SP sir... Heard, that you
arrested 12 cannabis smugglers. How Sir...?

1787
02:32:42,321 --> 02:32:44,696
10 people, not 12... two fled...

1788
02:32:44,862 --> 02:32:47,196
They run away..

1789
02:32:47,237 --> 02:32:51,157
Sir... Sir ...They did not run away... they were
killed sir... sir... sir... killed them, Sir.

1790
02:32:51,362 --> 02:32:56,236
Sir... he says they were exactly 12 people... we also
have the same information. Where are the other two?

1791
02:32:56,237 --> 02:32:58,047
Sir... sir... they were
killed sir... killed sir..

1792
02:32:58,071 --> 02:33:04,862
Didn't I say that two of them have fled? He is a
smuggler... He doesn't know the math. I will teach him now.

1793
02:33:05,071 --> 02:33:06,551
Sir... what they are saying, is true?

1794
02:33:06,779 --> 02:33:08,029
Sir Media is asking.

1795
02:33:08,237 --> 02:33:13,196
The new SP has come. I'm going to give him
the card. I will meet you once on the way.

1796
02:33:13,237 --> 02:33:15,154
Why do you want to meet?

1797
02:33:15,446 --> 02:33:16,946
I just want to talk.

1798
02:33:17,279 --> 02:33:19,528
Will you sit silently once you come?

1799
02:33:19,529 --> 02:33:21,279
A lot will happen after that

1800
02:33:21,654 --> 02:33:24,362
I just want to talk to you and leave.
I will just talk and leave.

1801
02:33:24,446 --> 02:33:29,154
What? You will see and go is it,
as if I don't know What you will do.

1802
02:33:29,821 --> 02:33:35,196
You will tempt me and leave.
I will go sleepless after that.

1803
02:33:35,279 --> 02:33:36,528
Dear, why are you objecting when I say that
I will meet you and once and leave?

1804
02:33:36,529 --> 02:33:37,821
Hey... Where are you going?

1805
02:33:37,904 --> 02:33:38,904
I have a small work.

1806
02:33:39,112 --> 02:33:41,903
Hey... You should not go out of home
once we make you a bridegroom.

1807
02:33:41,904 --> 02:33:44,737
Not good for the home.
No... You tell him, dear.

1808
02:33:45,029 --> 02:33:47,278
What... what is this old woman's torture?

1809
02:33:47,279 --> 02:33:50,879
Dear... Listen to what I'm telling you... I
don't know why but my mind is suspecting harm.

1810
02:33:51,112 --> 02:33:53,792
This is the first holy occasion happening
in my life my dear son...

1811
02:33:53,862 --> 02:33:55,362
Pushpa!

1812
02:33:56,779 --> 02:33:57,779
Pushpa.

1813
02:33:57,946 --> 02:33:58,946
Come...

1814
02:34:02,987 --> 02:34:05,487
This is the First-time meeting
with the newly appointed SP.

1815
02:34:05,904 --> 02:34:06,362
Sir...

1816
02:34:06,904 --> 02:34:07,945
I brought coffee.

1817
02:34:07,946 --> 02:34:08,946
Keep it there.

1818
02:34:09,154 --> 02:34:11,904
Had to bend to see him.

1819
02:34:19,112 --> 02:34:20,362
He is only Pushpa Sir.

1820
02:34:20,446 --> 02:34:21,529
I told you about.

1821
02:34:21,821 --> 02:34:24,112
He looks after the entire
red sandal syndicate.

1822
02:34:24,654 --> 02:34:26,821
He came to see you, Sir.

1823
02:34:28,279 --> 02:34:31,029
Hello SP... What is your name?

1824
02:34:31,904 --> 02:34:36,196
Ban... var sing Skiva... skyavathaa

1825
02:34:36,487 --> 02:34:37,612
whatever it is...

1826
02:34:38,821 --> 02:34:41,821
I getting married tomorrow.

1827
02:34:41,904 --> 02:34:43,237
Somehow you...

1828
02:34:45,362 --> 02:34:47,279
should manage and come.

1829
02:34:50,862 --> 02:34:52,222
This is this month's commission...

1830
02:34:52,529 --> 02:34:53,529
One crore rupees.

1831
02:34:54,154 --> 02:34:56,737
Every month we will send
your commission to you sir.

1832
02:35:53,362 --> 02:35:55,196
One short!

1833
02:35:58,071 --> 02:35:59,696
One short!

1834
02:36:03,487 --> 02:36:04,946
One short.

1835
02:36:05,612 --> 02:36:06,612
Sir?

1836
02:36:07,362 --> 02:36:08,821
One short.

1837
02:36:08,987 --> 02:36:10,987
No Sir, it is all correct.

1838
02:36:17,279 --> 02:36:18,737
One short.

1839
02:36:19,154 --> 02:36:20,154
Guys, come on...

1840
02:36:27,737 --> 02:36:30,821
That's why no two things
should look similar...

1841
02:36:31,737 --> 02:36:38,737
He wore a white shirt... I too wore a white shirt,
and both look similar... but there is a difference.

1842
02:36:40,904 --> 02:36:43,779
This one has a half-inch stamp. Look...

1843
02:36:44,987 --> 02:36:45,987
Yes Sir...

1844
02:36:46,487 --> 02:36:47,612
That is a brand.

1845
02:36:49,237 --> 02:36:50,445
You know what brand is right.

1846
02:36:50,446 --> 02:36:51,446
Yes Sir.

1847
02:36:52,446 --> 02:36:56,237
In Kannada,
you call it (SURNAME) manu tana.

1848
02:36:57,196 --> 02:36:58,196
No sir.

1849
02:36:58,946 --> 02:36:59,946
Maanu tana.

1850
02:36:59,946 --> 02:37:00,946
No Sir.

1851
02:37:01,571 --> 02:37:02,571
Manetana (SURNAME)...

1852
02:37:02,821 --> 02:37:03,821
Yes sir.

1853
02:37:04,029 --> 02:37:05,779
It is like a surname...

1854
02:37:07,362 --> 02:37:10,154
It means a stamp that tells
who manufactured this...

1855
02:37:11,321 --> 02:37:14,321
who gave birth.

1856
02:37:17,779 --> 02:37:20,987
This one has the stamp,

1857
02:37:22,654 --> 02:37:23,862
That's why it has value.

1858
02:37:25,112 --> 02:37:29,071
That one doesn't have
hence it doesn't have value.

1859
02:37:31,154 --> 02:37:32,821
The count is right sir.

1860
02:37:34,071 --> 02:37:36,196
There is One short.

1861
02:37:39,321 --> 02:37:43,779
If we have a value, we will know the
value of the other person.

1862
02:37:46,154 --> 02:37:47,946
Tell us how much money is short sir...

1863
02:37:48,279 --> 02:37:49,279
we will give

1864
02:37:49,404 --> 02:37:51,237
Mr. Kuppu Raju...
- Sir!

1865
02:37:52,279 --> 02:37:53,279
Handcuff him.

1866
02:38:02,404 --> 02:38:05,821
If I arrest you now and
charge you with PD act,

1867
02:38:06,529 --> 02:38:08,505
do you know how many
years you will you be jailed?

1868
02:38:08,529 --> 02:38:09,362
Three years Sir.

1869
02:38:09,487 --> 02:38:10,487
Three years...

1870
02:38:10,737 --> 02:38:11,946
Three years...

1871
02:38:12,237 --> 02:38:17,196
If you go to jail now,
when will you get married?

1872
02:38:18,362 --> 02:38:20,029
After three years...

1873
02:38:20,404 --> 02:38:26,404
It means I will decide
when you will get married.

1874
02:38:27,154 --> 02:38:28,737
This is Bhanwar Singh value.

1875
02:38:29,529 --> 02:38:32,696
If you are married now...

1876
02:38:33,654 --> 02:38:37,946
When will your wife become pregnant...

1877
02:38:38,612 --> 02:38:40,696
After one month...

1878
02:38:42,112 --> 02:38:43,404
a man.

1879
02:38:44,071 --> 02:38:45,737
Pushpa is a man...

1880
02:38:47,862 --> 02:38:50,904
If you go to jail when
will she become pregnant.

1881
02:38:59,779 --> 02:39:02,321
What? Tightening fists?

1882
02:39:03,529 --> 02:39:04,612
Getting angry?

1883
02:39:06,321 --> 02:39:07,321
Open it... open it.

1884
02:39:08,654 --> 02:39:11,279
You don't have that
much luxury with police...

1885
02:39:11,446 --> 02:39:13,862
Open your hands... Open them...

1886
02:39:14,987 --> 02:39:15,987
Open them...

1887
02:39:21,946 --> 02:39:22,946
Open them...

1888
02:39:24,654 --> 02:39:25,654
Shh!

1889
02:39:26,154 --> 02:39:27,862
Did you understand what was short?

1890
02:39:32,279 --> 02:39:33,487
Hey, you guys hold on.

1891
02:39:40,029 --> 02:39:42,862
Pushpa's count never wrong.

1892
02:39:45,987 --> 02:39:48,487
Tell me what is short for you sir...

1893
02:39:49,487 --> 02:39:50,487
What?

1894
02:39:51,737 --> 02:39:54,654
What is short for you Please tell me sir?

1895
02:40:03,404 --> 02:40:08,736
What is short for you Please tell me sir?

1896
02:40:08,737 --> 02:40:09,737
Sir...

1897
02:40:11,821 --> 02:40:13,696
That was short.

1898
02:40:14,487 --> 02:40:22,487
I told you one short; One
short right. 'Sir', was short.

1899
02:40:24,821 --> 02:40:27,321
Shouldn't say... You
should attend the weddingâ€.

1900
02:40:28,196 --> 02:40:32,654
You should say attend the wedding Sirâ€.

1901
02:40:36,654 --> 02:40:38,362
Mr. Kuppuraju...
- Sir...

1902
02:40:38,779 --> 02:40:39,862
Uncuff him.

1903
02:40:43,112 --> 02:40:44,237
Now the count is correct.

1904
02:40:45,321 --> 02:40:46,487
Bag... bag... bag...

1905
02:40:47,279 --> 02:40:51,696
from now on, along with the cash,
sir also should come.

1906
02:40:53,654 --> 02:40:59,737
How much sir should take and how
much you will get will be decided by sir.

1907
02:41:00,237 --> 02:41:02,779
Shekhawat sir will decide.

1908
02:41:08,237 --> 02:41:09,237
Pushpa!

1909
02:41:14,196 --> 02:41:15,516
This is my gift for your wedding.

1910
02:41:16,821 --> 02:41:19,196
Buy clothes... branded ones.

1911
02:41:21,737 --> 02:41:22,946
I gave you a gift.

1912
02:41:24,654 --> 02:41:26,029
Won't you give me a party, Pushpa?

1913
02:41:26,362 --> 02:41:27,571
Don't know why?

1914
02:41:28,071 --> 02:41:31,029
Pushpa used to do whatever
Shekakavat said from then onwards.

1915
02:41:31,654 --> 02:41:33,361
He used to follow his orders religiously.

1916
02:41:33,362 --> 02:41:35,779
Never seen Pushpa bend
before anyone till then.

1917
02:41:36,487 --> 02:41:38,654
This is the first time he was doing so.

1918
02:41:39,071 --> 02:41:41,362
We used to wonder why
he is behaving like that.

1919
02:41:42,612 --> 02:41:46,486
That day,
a little before Pushpa's wedding muhurtham,

1920
02:41:46,487 --> 02:41:48,196
Priest called for the bridegroom.

1921
02:41:50,196 --> 02:41:51,321
When we went in to call him,

1922
02:41:52,654 --> 02:41:53,654
Pushpa was not there.

1923
02:41:54,362 --> 02:41:55,922
Even his motorcycle was also not there.

1924
02:42:05,196 --> 02:42:07,612
Wow!! What is this Sir?

1925
02:42:10,237 --> 02:42:11,529
What is this Sir?

1926
02:42:11,779 --> 02:42:13,612
Never thought you have a funny side too,
Sir.

1927
02:42:15,362 --> 02:42:19,612
Singing like a Romeo..

1928
02:42:19,987 --> 02:42:24,904
But that day you scared
me with a mask of a tiger.

1929
02:42:25,362 --> 02:42:26,987
Had to scare Pushpa.

1930
02:42:27,571 --> 02:42:31,112
Only then you came know
how to behave with me.

1931
02:42:31,571 --> 02:42:35,338
See now we are drinking together happily.

1932
02:42:36,279 --> 02:42:37,279
Where is Pushpa?

1933
02:42:37,280 --> 02:42:39,946
Where did he go?
Auspicious time is nearing..

1934
02:42:43,141 --> 02:42:46,247
Not able to connect. Calling him.
- Call him again.

1935
02:42:46,904 --> 02:42:49,821
What Pushpa? Today is your wedding, right?

1936
02:42:50,604 --> 02:42:52,479
And you are here only. Is it OK?

1937
02:42:54,654 --> 02:43:00,495
The wedding can happen. The bride will
be there even if I go half an hour late.

1938
02:43:01,154 --> 02:43:08,654
But you Shekhawat Sir,
gave me time to speak to you.

1939
02:43:09,737 --> 02:43:12,487
When you referred to the wedding,
I remembered one thing.

1940
02:43:12,696 --> 02:43:19,279
You said, you will decide when my wife should get
pregnant, and at what time she should get pregnant.

1941
02:43:20,571 --> 02:43:23,112
Why did you say that Sir?
I felt very bad.

1942
02:43:24,904 --> 02:43:27,362
Tell me why did you say that Sir?

1943
02:43:27,946 --> 02:43:30,487
Why are you spoiling the party mood?

1944
02:43:30,904 --> 02:43:32,237
Why all that now.

1945
02:43:33,154 --> 02:43:34,154
It's OK sir.

1946
02:43:34,362 --> 02:43:36,987
You must have said that to hurt me.

1947
02:43:37,654 --> 02:43:38,894
That's it, right sir? Leave it.

1948
02:43:40,112 --> 02:43:41,112
But...

1949
02:43:42,821 --> 02:43:49,112
I didn't like the way you
insulted my mother Sir.

1950
02:43:49,571 --> 02:43:51,654
What did I say about your mother Pushpa?

1951
02:43:52,904 --> 02:43:57,612
You know that I don't have a surname right,
Sir?

1952
02:43:59,821 --> 02:44:03,736
In spite of that, you insulted me
by saying who manufactured me...

1953
02:44:03,737 --> 02:44:09,029
who gave birth.
Stamp, Stamp... this... that. Right Sir?

1954
02:44:09,862 --> 02:44:12,112
What is this Pushpa?
Why are you spoiling the party mood?

1955
02:44:12,821 --> 02:44:14,112
Why all that now?

1956
02:44:15,362 --> 02:44:20,612
When someone speaks about my surname,
it is like insulting my birth.

1957
02:44:21,779 --> 02:44:23,779
And if someone insults my birth...

1958
02:44:25,529 --> 02:44:27,362
it is like insulting my mother.

1959
02:44:28,904 --> 02:44:33,987
Every... insulted me with this
from the time I was born Sir.

1960
02:44:34,279 --> 02:44:35,279
Pushpa.

1961
02:44:35,904 --> 02:44:37,528
You are drunk and speaking nonsense.

1962
02:44:37,529 --> 02:44:38,862
You are tipsy?

1963
02:44:41,737 --> 02:44:44,612
Yes Sir, I had more.

1964
02:44:45,862 --> 02:44:47,321
In that one thing is more.

1965
02:44:47,404 --> 02:44:48,404
What is it?

1966
02:44:49,154 --> 02:44:55,154
Like you, I don't know how to put
in suspense saying One is more...

1967
02:44:55,737 --> 02:44:57,529
There one extra bullet in that sir.

1968
02:45:00,737 --> 02:45:01,737
In this?

1969
02:45:01,821 --> 02:45:02,821
Yes!

1970
02:45:02,904 --> 02:45:03,904
Give me!

1971
02:45:08,487 --> 02:45:10,904
There are six Sir...
Did you notice it? One is more.

1972
02:45:11,154 --> 02:45:12,779
That is Service revolver Pushpa.

1973
02:45:13,404 --> 02:45:15,112
It will have Six bullets only.

1974
02:45:16,237 --> 02:45:21,404
That day when I tightened my fists hearing your
words, you aimed this gun at me right, Sir.

1975
02:45:22,112 --> 02:45:25,237
The bullet that had to go
into this remained in this only.

1976
02:45:25,404 --> 02:45:26,404
That one is more.

1977
02:45:54,321 --> 02:45:55,987
Do you know what this is Sir?

1978
02:45:57,862 --> 02:46:00,779
This is my father's blood
which is flowing in my body.

1979
02:46:02,446 --> 02:46:09,362
My father gave me this even before my
brothers could snatch the surname from me.

1980
02:46:11,446 --> 02:46:14,029
No one can separate this from me.

1981
02:46:14,904 --> 02:46:20,029
This is my brand, Sir...

1982
02:46:35,529 --> 02:46:37,612
Hey, Shekhawat sir... Idiot.

1983
02:46:38,071 --> 02:46:41,779
What? Did you think I am of a brand
that will get scared of bullet?

1984
02:46:42,571 --> 02:46:46,112
This brand has grown with its own attitude.

1985
02:46:47,279 --> 02:46:52,862
Do you know why Pushpa was silent
that day when you said all that?

1986
02:46:53,946 --> 02:46:55,706
My mother didn't have
a wedding in her life.

1987
02:46:56,696 --> 02:47:00,279
This is the first wedding
happening in our house.

1988
02:47:02,112 --> 02:47:06,404
I stopped myself till this hour, thinking
my mother will feel bad if anything happens.

1989
02:47:07,279 --> 02:47:10,487
Now I won't hold myself back.

1990
02:47:10,612 --> 02:47:11,654
Greetings!

1991
02:47:12,321 --> 02:47:14,487
Jakka, Sit down.

1992
02:47:21,487 --> 02:47:25,446
You are not understanding
what you are doing.

1993
02:47:25,862 --> 02:47:28,946
Take it Sir, you swine...

1994
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:30,446
Take it off.

1995
02:47:34,696 --> 02:47:36,779
Pushpa,
do you know with whom you are confronting?

1996
02:47:38,654 --> 02:47:43,196
Bhanwar Singh.
Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat.

1997
02:47:43,529 --> 02:47:44,571
Is it?

1998
02:47:45,321 --> 02:47:46,779
Then remove your pants also.

1999
02:47:47,071 --> 02:47:47,987
Why this?

2000
02:47:47,988 --> 02:47:54,487
Pushpa stripped Shekhawat sir's clothes
and made him stand stark naked..

2001
02:47:54,737 --> 02:47:56,904
Imagine how great feels..

2002
02:48:31,237 --> 02:48:35,446
Did you understand now? Everyone will feel
the same way when you strip them.

2003
02:48:36,071 --> 02:48:40,196
It can be Shekhawat Sir or Pushpa.

2004
02:48:41,362 --> 02:48:44,486
You don't have clothes on your body.
I don't have clothes on my body.

2005
02:48:44,487 --> 02:48:46,654
But there is one difference,
do you know it?

2006
02:48:47,404 --> 02:48:49,987
Pushpa started his life like this.

2007
02:48:50,737 --> 02:48:54,196
Do you know what was his
range when he was a coolie?

2008
02:48:59,529 --> 02:49:01,112
This was his range.

2009
02:49:01,237 --> 02:49:04,404
The range that was then is the same now.

2010
02:49:05,029 --> 02:49:08,196
See, If I go on the road like this also,
they will call me Pushpa.

2011
02:49:08,529 --> 02:49:12,362
If you go on the road like
this without a police uniform...

2012
02:49:12,821 --> 02:49:15,321
even your dog won't recognize you.

2013
02:49:17,487 --> 02:49:21,737
Brand is not in the clothes you wear.
It is in your living.

2014
02:49:26,779 --> 02:49:28,237
Hey Shekhawat Sir...

2015
02:49:28,571 --> 02:49:30,321
please keep this in your mind.

2016
02:49:31,404 --> 02:49:35,070
The load that has to go will go and the
money 'has to come will keep coming.

2017
02:49:35,071 --> 02:49:36,696
You won't get a rupee.

2018
02:49:37,487 --> 02:49:41,571
You will have just the uniform on
your body but you won't have work to do.

2019
02:49:42,737 --> 02:49:47,029
You will only have 'Sir'.
I will remove everything else.

2020
02:49:47,696 --> 02:49:48,821
See you.

2021
02:50:08,821 --> 02:50:10,821
(SANSKRIT SLOKA)

2022
02:50:54,654 --> 02:50:56,779
Sorry,
Sir... Your dog is not recognising you.

2023
02:51:15,571 --> 02:51:18,779
What is this attire?
Why did you come like this?

2024
02:51:39,404 --> 02:51:40,237
What happened?

2025
02:51:40,321 --> 02:51:44,029
One guy thought Pushpa means flower.

2026
02:51:47,571 --> 02:51:50,821
I showed him that Pushpa means fire.

2027
02:51:50,946 --> 02:51:53,779
OK. It's all over, right?

2028
02:51:56,737 --> 02:51:58,446
Just started.

2029
02:52:01,987 --> 02:52:03,279
Pushpa!

2030
02:52:08,404 --> 02:52:10,071
Whoever comes...

2031
02:52:12,529 --> 02:52:14,279
Will not budge.
