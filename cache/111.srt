1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,960
Why did you have to cheat
just because you thought I was?

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,240
Call me when you find out who you are.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,580
It was just a hook up.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,680
It was your boyfriend who sent the tip.
-Did Isak send the tip?

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,500
I think it's psycho.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,820
Do you have feelings for me?

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,140
Like you didn't know.

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,220
Will you come home with me to do homework?
-No.

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,620
Let me know when you change your mind.

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,080
What are you doing on your plate?
-I'm just sorting my salad.

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,100
I'm not on the bus anymore.

12
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,560
She started staggering, and then
she tripped. She's not responding.

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,940
I think I killed William's baby tonight.

14
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,600
You kept pushing me out of bed.

15
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,140
You pulled away my covers.

16
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,920
Your mom is never at home?

17
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,180
She is, but she got a new j
ob at the Ministry of environment so..

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,420
.. ever since that she's been traveling at lot more.
She's home every other week.

19
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,800
You're alone a lot! 
Isn't that cool?

20
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,440
You can do whatever you want.

21
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,500
Where's your dad?
-He lives in Bergen.

22
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,860
Chris! You get to clean it up.

23
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,880
Yeah, I'll clean it up.

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,660
Dad lives in Bergen.
Mom and dad are divorced.

25
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,680
I think we moved from Bergen when I was twelve?

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,860
Do you have contact with him?

27
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:07,160
No.. Yeah, we have. But we kind
of lost contact when we moved.

28
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,640
My dad got remarried,
and his wife was a bit jealous.

29
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,140
Hi!
-Hi!

30
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,520
Hi.

31
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,220
We made breakfast.
-Yeah, Noora made pancakes.

32
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,340
Let's eat.

33
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,240
You can sit here.

34
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,820
Take some pancakes.

35
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,460
Just start! Sana?

36
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,340
Do you want juice, Vilde?

37
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,260
Here!

38
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,900
I just spilled a bit.

39
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,540
Do you want jam?

40
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,460
I don't remember anything from yesterday.

41
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,940
Nothing happened.
It was fine.

42
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:57,400
Blackouts are God's way
of telling you not to worry about anything, Vilde.

43
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,820
Nothing special happened.

44
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,680
You just passed out 
when you came to Iben's party.

45
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,160
So we took you here.
You just slept.

46
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,720
Vilde..

47
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,560
Which girl with self-respect
hasn't blacked out at least once before?

48
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,520
Thank you.

49
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,900
I mean it.

50
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,760
You don't have to thank us. That's
why we're on a bus together. To help each other.

51
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,560
You still want me on your bus?
-What are you talking about? You're our bus boss!

52
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,260
You think any of us want
to do the financials and the budget?

53
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,100
But eh.. I can be a
bit stressful to be the bus boss.

54
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,160
If it interferes with other things.
That could easily happen.

55
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,060
Yeah, like what?

56
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,380
Well, like school and..

57
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,520
Things like fun stuff outside of school.

58
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,160
Or, eh..

59
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,340
A child.

60
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,260
Vilde, are you pregnant?

61
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,440
Are you sure?
-Yes.

62
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,280
How sure?

63
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,280
Yeah.. yeah, yeah.

64
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,620
It'll probably be another
little trip to doctor Skrulle.

65
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,180
It's quite catchy.
-Who are you talking about?

66
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,920
Justin..

67
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,800
Your crush.

68
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,940
Eva, that's between us.
-Look, look!

69
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,020
Yeah, yeah.
I saw that.

70
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,660
Hi!

71
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,320
Hi.

72
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,020
The theater group invites you to the Christmas
 tree lighting on Friday. Are you coming?

73
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,760
Maybe?

74
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,880
You have to.
The entire school will be there.

75
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,540
Okay, we're coming.
-Great!

76
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,060
Yeah, yeah. I've seen it.

77
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,540
Hi beautiful.

78
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,860
Willhelm! Wow.

79
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,880
You're not answering my messages?

80
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,620
No power.

81
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,320
For two weeks straight.

82
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,540
Should we skip the next class?

83
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,840
You have to give up now.
-Give up?

84
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,580
I won't give up.

85
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,680
You're wasting your time.

86
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,100
Listen, Noora Amalie Sætre.

87
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,480
You're a smart girl. You have
to understand that every time you reject me..

88
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,020
..I only want you more and more.

89
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,980
So if you really want to
get rid of me, just go on a date with me.

90
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,360
Stop playing hard to get.

91
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,960
Great logic.

92
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,920
Was that all, or?

93
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,980
No, one more thing.

94
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,780
Fucking hell, you're so beautiful.

95
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,300
Just tell me what I should do!

96
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,320
Hi..
-Hi.

97
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,000
Maybe we should talk.

98
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,520
Yes.

99
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,120
When can you talk?

100
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,400
I have lots to do this week.

101
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,060
But, Thursday maybe?

102
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,220
Thursday is fine.

103
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,460
What's up with him?

104
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,880
He's in love with me.
-You're kidding!

105
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,900
Hi there!

106
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,480
Oh, she's new. Salaam alaikum?

107
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,360
Vilde is pregnant!
-Ai, that went fast.

108
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,700
Vilde Lien, what should
I say? Congratulations?

109
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,580
She's not gonna keep the child!
-That's completely up to her.

110
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,320
She's 16! She's
still a child herself.

111
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,640
World's youngest mother 
was 5 years old when she gave birth.

112
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,000
But she wasn't from Norway.
She was from some place in South America.

113
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,520
I want to say Chile.

114
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,960
Or was it Peru?

115
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah, hello?
-Hi. Yeah.

116
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,660
What should we do?

117
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:39,080
Yeah, what should we do? 
I think the first thing we should do is a blood test.

118
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,580
I took a test.

119
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,540
When did you take the test?
-I took it on Friday.

120
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,120
On Friday? And have 
you had sex since Friday?

121
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,660
No!
-Are you really sure?

122
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,820
There were a few hours
where it went a bit black..

123
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:01,700
Okay, girls. This here
is an ovulation test.

124
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,120
An ovulation test?

125
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:14,220
It will tell you the likelihood of you
being pregnant after taking the test.

126
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,340
Seriously?

127
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,900
But there's more. 
I feel sick in the morning.

128
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,660
I have a bloated stomach.
It's gotten a lot bigger.

129
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,040
I hasn't gotten that
much bigger. Can I take a look?

130
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,320
Does this hurt?

131
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,120
Yes.

132
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,780
How's your diet?
-Good.

133
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,200
What did you eat today?

134
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:52,480
It's still really early,
so a Cola Light and gum.

135
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,200
Yeah, got it.

136
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:04,520
Then I don't think there's a baby in your stomach.
There's probably air in your intestines.

137
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:12,440
That happens when you cram Cola Light and gum into your 
stomach. It just produces more gas. Do you eat a lot?

138
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,900
No.
-No?

139
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:24,960
You should. You're pushing up too much air in your intestines.
Then you get a stomach ache. You have to fart it out.

140
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,280
In the worst case scenario we have to
give you a colostomy. It's like a poop bag on your stomach.

141
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,080
Are you serious?
-No, of course not.

142
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,300
But you can't live on Cola
and gum. That's the point I'm trying to make.

143
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,160
Yes! We will not be having a baby!

144
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,680
Vilde..

145
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,820
I see what you're doing.

146
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,860
And you have to stop.

147
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,060
You don't know what you're talking about.

148
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,540
Yes, I do know.

149
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:35,880
You stuff yourself with chocolate milk and
pancakes and you look like a super model.

150
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,140
What are you talking about?

151
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,440
You look like a super model.

152
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,520
Vilde, you're super pretty.

153
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,000
But not good enough.

154
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,220
Isak..

155
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,880
Be completely honest with me now.

156
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,300
Yes.

157
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,620
If I don't believe you, I'll ask
Jonas. Then I'll tell him why I'm asking.

158
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,780
I understand.

159
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:35,040
When we were at the cabin, and
I asked you if you knew if Jonas and Ingrid texted..

160
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,100
I knew he texted with
her because of her brother.

161
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,580
So it wasn't about French?

162
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,960
No. Well, maybe that too.

163
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,260
Jonas stressed like crazy about
bringing that shit on the cabin trip.

164
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:01,820
He couldn't reach her brother,
so instead he sent her a message.

165
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,760
You guys smoked at the cabin?

166
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,580
Yeah, that's why Elias came.
Jonas didn't get anything before we left.

167
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:24,700
I won't criticize you, but we were 
pretty out of it. I'm surprised you didn't notice it.

168
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,520
Okay.

169
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,160
Anyway.

170
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,640
What about the other time? 
When I thought I heard Ingrid's voice on the phone.

171
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,980
When I asked you,
did you know anything?

172
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,640
No.

173
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:53,740
I could've known it was
because of her brother.

174
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,920
But I promised Jonas I wouldn't
tell you anything about him smoking.

175
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,780
So I kept my promise.

176
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,200
But you advised me to ask Ingrid?

177
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,160
That was bad advice. Plain bad advice.

178
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:22,040
I should've just told you
that you shouldn't worry about her.

179
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,180
He was more in love with you than.. ever.

180
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,880
It would've been really cool
if you could've told me this a bit earlier.

181
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,520
One more thing. If you wanted to
 fuck things up between me and Jonas..

182
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,400
Then why didn't you advise 
me to tell Jonas about Chris?

183
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,680
I knew that if you would tell Jonas
 yourself he would have forgiven you.

184
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,920
Do you understand how
messed up that sounds to me?

185
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,700
I feel like I don't know you anymore.

186
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:22,820
I know it might be hard to believe, 
but I never wanted to hurt you. It just turned out that way.

187
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,980
I'm sorry.

188
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,740
Karma's a bitch.

189
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,520
If nothing else..

190
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,220
At least I now know
how Ingrid must've felt.

191
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,840
Hi!
-Hi!

192
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,000
How are you doing?
-I'm fine.

193
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,380
What are you doing?

194
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,220
Just Christmas stress.

195
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,560
You don't like Christmas stress.

196
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,560
Who was that?

197
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,900
My sister.

198
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,560
Okay..

199
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,920
I swear!

200
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,000
Okay, I believe you.

201
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,840
Good.

202
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,460
But..
-Yeah?

203
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,680
You told me to call
when I found out who I am.

204
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,740
Yes.

205
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,740
Do you want to meet?

206
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,180
Yes, of course. When?

207
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,760
Now you're probably going to
smoke marijuana with Ingrid's brother.

208
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,860
That's not true.
-Come in the morning.

209
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,740
Yeah, tomorrow suits me.

210
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:02,980
Good.

211
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,680
We'll talk then. Bye.

212
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,860
Hi.
-Hi.

213
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,760
Tea?
-Yeah.

214
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,660
That was warm.

215
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,200
Do you remember the first time we kissed?

216
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,740
Why are you laughing?
-Of course I remember that.

217
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,300
Yeah? What do you remember?

218
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,900
What do I remember?

219
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,160
Yeah.

220
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,160
What is it?
-It's a bit weird.

221
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,940
No. Say it.

222
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,700
The thing is that I didn't 
know you felt the same thing I did.

223
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,760
Since you were best friends with
my girl, it was a big risk to take.

224
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,180
If it didn't go well,
I would have been really weird.

225
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,080
So I just waited for a sign.

226
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,960
What kind of sign?

227
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,220
A sign that I should kiss you.

228
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,420
And you know the Take Me to Church
song they played all the time?

229
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,420
Yes.

230
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,660
I kept thinking if that was
the next song that came on, I should go fot it.

231
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,340
So did it come on?

232
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,060
No, it didn't.

233
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,160
They played this Kygo shit..

234
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,660
But then it was you who kissed me.

235
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,920
It was me who kissed you.

236
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,480
What you didn't know,
was that I thought the exact same thing as you.

237
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,400
Oh yeah?

238
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,460
I need to have a sign.

239
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,260
If the next song was Kygo,
I would kiss you.

240
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,480
So funny.

241
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,520
But that was not why you kissed me, was it?

242
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,660
No.

243
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,320
That wasn't why.

244
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,140
I kissed you because
I couldn't refrain myself.

245
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,760
It wasn't like I was with
you just because it seemed cool.

246
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,640
Not?

247
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,340
No.

248
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,400
You accusing me of that,
actually angered me a little.

249
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,880
It felt like I had to
give up everything to be with you.

250
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,220
I ditched my best friends.

251
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,340
So when you said 
I just do what others think is cool..

252
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:10,000
.. and that I don't have my
own opinion, is really unfair.

253
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,420
Because it's not true.

254
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,440
Because I chose you.

255
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,220
And it was a really stupid choice.

256
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,580
But at least I didn't
do it to be popular.

257
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,780
A really stupid choice?

258
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,860
Yes.

259
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,760
A really stupid choice.

260
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,540
Because it made me feel like shit.

261
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:57,780
I walked around paranoid all the time
because I thought there might be something betwen you two.

262
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:04,280
I thought that if you and
I could do something like that to Ingrid..

263
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,100
.. you could do the same thing to me.

264
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,000
You understand?

265
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,540
Maybe i thought I deserved it.

266
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,560
And so I became insecure and desperate.

267
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,420
Your opinion meant more than my own.

268
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,320
That's not how it should be.

269
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,540
No.

270
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,560
I have to find out..

271
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,940
.. what my own opinion is.

272
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,520
And I have to do it on my own.

273
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,820
Do we break up now?

274
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,060
I think so.

275
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,960
Is that what you want?

276
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,560
Yes.

277
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,000
Right now..

278
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,540
.. this seems like the most important thing.

279
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,780
As if nothing else has meaning.

280
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,320
Then we'll jus tlie here for now.

281
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,260
Hello.
-Hi.

282
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,080
Me and Jonas broke up.

283
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,480
I just thought I should tell you.

284
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,560
Are you okay?

285
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,600
Hi!

286
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,800
Hi!

287
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,380
Have you seen Vilde?

288
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,040
Eh, no.

289
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,420
But she would be coming, right?

290
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,060
Yeah, I think so.

291
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,720
Okay, can I just borrow your phone?

292
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,000
Yes.

293
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,520
My battery's empty.

294
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,860
In 2015? Is there no one
who has functioning technology?

295
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,340
Thanks.

296
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,960
Do you have Vilde's number?

297
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,400
No, I don't.

298
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,080
Hi!
-Hi!

299
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,700
I just want to say merry Christmas.

300
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,220
Yes, merry Christmas!

301
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,880
Vilde!

302
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,080
Hi!

303
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,120
Noora is looking for you like crazy.
-Why?

304
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,040
I'm sure she's scared
you've blacked out somewhere.

305
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,020
Really funny!

306
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,600
Vilde?

307
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,420
Hey.
-Hi.

308
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,920
Remember when I said you weren't good enough?

309
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,620
That was bullshit.

310
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,180
You're more than good enough.

311
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:53,820
Anyone who says otherwise, is an asshole.
Including me. Okay?

312
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,600
Okay.

313
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,300
What just happened?

314
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,720
I have to tell Chris and Sana!

315
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,460
Hey you.

316
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,420
I found Vilde. You're never going
to guess what just happened.

317
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:36,620
I just thought of something. Remember 
when you told me it was a little weird..

318
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,720
.. when Isak said he has feelings for you.

319
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,160
Eh, yes.

320
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,760
Because..

321
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:54,600
I just think that maybe it's
not you he has feelings for.
