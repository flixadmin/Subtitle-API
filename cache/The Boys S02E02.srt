1
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:55,602
Mouse.

2
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:59,940
I thought
I'd never see you again.

3
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:50,350
When you...

4
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:52,435
When you disappeared
that night...

5
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:55,146
I'm sorry.

6
00:46:55,188 --> 00:46:56,523
We were supposed to watch out
for each other

7
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,399
and then you were gone.

8
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:08,076
Shining Light sent me here.

9
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:12,622
Put the needle in my spine

10
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:15,708
and filled me full
of the blue poison.

11
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:20,964
I should have found you.

12
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:25,343
No. I'm the big sister. I should
have come back for you, but...

13
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:32,517
...they made me into...

14
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:37,730
...a monster.

15
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:44,112
If that's true,
we're both monsters now.

16
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:48,825
Did it hurt?

17
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,077
I wanted to die.

18
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:56,541
Me too.

19
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,877
They had one dose left

20
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:02,255
and they knew it worked on you

21
00:48:02,297 --> 00:48:05,800
so they figured
it would work on me.

22
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,685
I'm sorry.

23
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:18,354
It's not your fault.

24
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,334
It's not your fault.

25
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:10,628
These people you were with...

26
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:13,297
They keep me safe.
They'll keep you safe too.

27
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:19,804
Or we can go home.
Back to the village.

28
00:52:22,098 --> 00:52:23,850
There is no village anymore.

29
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,227
What?

30
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,229
They came for us.

31
00:52:28,271 --> 00:52:30,398
Who?

32
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:31,649
The Americans.

33
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:35,361
This hero came shrieking
out of the sky like a demon.

34
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:38,781
Destroyed the camp. And all
the villages around it, too.

35
00:52:39,991 --> 00:52:42,159
There were bodies everywhere.

36
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:44,871
Everyone's gone.

37
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:47,832
Then we'll go somewhere else.
Back to Japan.

38
00:52:47,874 --> 00:52:50,793
Maybe grandma and grandpa
are still alive.

39
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,753
You don't care?

40
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:55,256
That the Superhero split
an old woman in half?

41
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,885
That the entire school caved in
with the kids inside?

42
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:00,261
That babies burned alive
in their cribs

43
00:53:00,303 --> 00:53:01,888
when the propane tanks exploded?

44
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:05,308
I never wanted this.
But they were right all along.

45
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,518
Shining Light is full of shit!

46
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,062
Shining Light fights injustice.

47
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:11,772
They stand up for people
without a voice.

48
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:15,192
They murdered our parents!

49
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,320
This country is an enemy
to the whole world now.

50
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,240
We need to fight back.
Fight with me!

51
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:26,662
You're the boy who nursed
every mouse who lost its mother.

52
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:30,875
That was a long time ago.

53
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:34,712
You're still my brother.

54
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:40,301
Then... you know
I have to do this.
