00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:03,171
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03,296 --> 00:00:04,690
<i>The disappearance
of Sue Dearbon.</i>

3
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:07,258
I don't think I've ever seen you
this devoted to a case.

4
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:09,552
I want to become
a defense attorney for meta-humans.

5
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:13,973
Meet Chester P. Runk.

6
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:16,142
He opened a black hole by accident.

7
00:00:16,226 --> 00:00:18,019
What up, party people!

8
00:00:18,353 --> 00:00:19,562
Also, where am I?

9
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:22,273
His molecules need to re-stabilize
at the sub-atomic level.

10
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:25,610
And when he does get out, that boy knows
exactly what he wants to do.

11
00:00:25,694 --> 00:00:26,694
Gonna ask Natalie out.

12
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:28,947
You cannot avoid the coming crisis.

13
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,156
Just tell me what I can do.

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,534
The Flash must die.

15
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:35,829
Nash, if you would just tell us
what you're looking for down there,

16
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:37,455
<i>we might be able to help you.</i>

17
00:00:38,123 --> 00:00:39,803
<i>So this is
where you've been hiding.</i>

18
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,459
I know how to save Barry Allen.

19
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:48,967
This is what I do.

20
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:51,177
I don't just solve mysteries.

21
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:53,096
I bust myths.

22
00:00:54,806 --> 00:00:56,224
I bust them wide open.

23
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:57,809
You said you could save Barry.

24
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:00,270
Tell us what you meant. The truth.

25
00:01:00,353 --> 00:01:01,855
Do you know what you're dealing with?

26
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:04,858
The Monitor, Mar Novu.

27
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:06,502
Or whatever he calls himself.

28
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:08,129
- Are you saying the Monitor's here?
- That's right.

29
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:09,922
You tracked a multi-verse god
down into a hole?

30
00:01:09,946 --> 00:01:11,197
And he's going to do here

31
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:13,908
what he has done
on all these other Earths.

32
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:15,702
Create fear.

33
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:18,413
Because the Monitor is a fraud.

34
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:19,914
He's a false god.

35
00:01:19,998 --> 00:01:21,458
One that I intend to take down,

36
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,460
thereby saving your husband.

37
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:26,171
If my calculations are correct,

38
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:29,340
behind these rocks
there's an inter-dimensional portal,

39
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:35,346
and that portal will lead us
directly to Mar Novu.

40
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,140
He's been here all along.

41
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:39,559
He has nowhere to run.

42
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:41,185
Back up.

43
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:43,104
Yeah, no, I wouldn't do...

44
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:51,821
Barry! Barry.

45
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,034
- Did you know that would happen?
- Yeah.

46
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:57,327
But this is just another one
of Mar Novu's tricks.

47
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,746
These rocks are infused with Eternium,

48
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:02,332
and that creates
an anti-vibrational force field that...

49
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:04,125
- No phasing.
- No phasing, correct.

50
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:05,418
So, how do we get through?

51
00:02:05,502 --> 00:02:07,003
I got a jackhammer in my car.

52
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:10,381
Uh, no. Any contact with the Eternium
in the sediment

53
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:13,176
could cause
a catastrophic molecular blast.

54
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:14,177
Everybody dies.

55
00:02:14,178 --> 00:02:16,554
No, instead all I need is
an artifact.

56
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:19,057
One that will illuminate the Eternium

57
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:23,228
so I can know what rocks
to dig around. Simple.

58
00:02:23,436 --> 00:02:25,563
And I know where to find that artifact.

59
00:02:57,762 --> 00:03:00,765
What up, party people!

60
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:05,687
Uh...

61
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:08,523
Hello!

62
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:12,277
Where is everybody?

63
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:15,530
Chester P.

64
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:17,615
Chester P., my brother.

65
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:24,122
You have a multi-billion dollar
bleeding-edge tech facility...

66
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:26,082
all to yourself.

67
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,921
Whoo!

68
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:36,509
It has everything!

69
00:03:36,593 --> 00:03:37,677
Incoming!

70
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:38,969
Sonic wrench!

71
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:42,682
Good morning, guv'nor. I'm the Doctor.

72
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:44,142
Ooh.

73
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:48,813
They have a multi-array private
global satellite surveillance system?

74
00:03:48,897 --> 00:03:49,897
Oh!

75
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:51,398
Gotta check my emails.

76
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,860
Disabled?

77
00:03:54,903 --> 00:03:56,237
I'm going again. I'm going again.

78
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:02,034
Uh-oh.

79
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:04,037
Uh-oh.

80
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:06,706
Killer Frost.

81
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,124
Wow.

82
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,209
The one day I get watch duty.

83
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:11,502
Uh...

84
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:13,046
What does this mean?

85
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:14,923
Looks like, technically, you're dead.

86
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:26,100
- Oh. Can I touch it?
- Mmm-hmm.

87
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:28,811
An official Elongated Man emblem?

88
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:31,519
He's going to scream.
He's going to be so surprised.

89
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:34,734
I've been preparing the whole team
for life after Crisis.

90
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:37,612
But Central City also has to be ready
for a world without Flash,

91
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:41,282
and Elongated Man should be
its sole protector once I'm gone.

92
00:04:41,574 --> 00:04:43,374
As far as Ralph knows,
he's coming to C.C.P.D.

93
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:46,371
for a routine deposition tomorrow when
it's really a press conference to...

94
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:48,497
pass the torch.

95
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:50,666
Hey, guys.

96
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:54,712
Yo! Got your message, Joe.

97
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:55,712
Hey, Ralph.

98
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:57,840
I talked to an old friend
about your Dearbon case.

99
00:04:57,924 --> 00:05:00,426
I got the address you were looking for
in Midway City.

100
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,388
If I were you, I would go check it out
after the deposition tomorrow.

101
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:05,807
Why put off tomorrow
what you can do today, right? Thanks.

102
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:07,266
Wait, wait, wait. Um...

103
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:10,103
You're going to be back from Midway
by tomorrow morning, right?

104
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:11,830
It's a routine deposition.
You can handle it.

105
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:12,981
Why don't I tag along?

106
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:14,941
I'll speed things up a bit.

107
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:16,442
You want to help me with a PI case?

108
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:18,771
Yeah, definitely. It'll be fun.
I'll follow your lead.

109
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:20,195
Okay.

110
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:33,167
This looks like it's gonna take a while.

111
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:35,937
Not if you know how to work the system.

112
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:39,716
I spent the whole summer hobnobbing
with the rich, famous, and the infamous.

113
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:41,509
Relax, I got this.

114
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:46,514
I can't imagine spending the whole
summer undercover with this crowd.

115
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:50,393
What does a gala event have to do
with Sue's disappearance, anyway?

116
00:05:50,643 --> 00:05:52,454
Right before Sue vanished,
she was seen wearing

117
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,731
a one-of-a-kind
Victoria Veil dress in Milan.

118
00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:57,817
This photo was taken three weeks ago.

119
00:05:59,152 --> 00:06:00,445
It's the exact same dress.

120
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,070
Sue was here,

121
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:04,407
and either she's still here,
or somebody in there

122
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:05,867
knows why she isn't.

123
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:08,535
Time to suit up.

124
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:23,925
Lose the ring, pal.

125
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,345
This is how we suit up tonight.

126
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,905
So, if anyone here knows where Sue is,

127
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,239
it'll be the party's host.

128
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:48,201
There's hundreds of people in here.
How do we narrow it down?

129
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:50,328
Golden tile, sir? Thank you.

130
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:52,622
VIP lounge.

131
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:56,084
That's where anyone who's anyone will
be going to kiss the proverbial ring.

132
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:57,460
We need to get in there.

133
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,838
Here. Mine was tight, too. Just...

134
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:04,092
Now I have ten selfies
of inside Barry Allen's nose.

135
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,261
- A camera tie?
- Mmm.

136
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,389
What, do you have a knife shoe
and a grapple-hook belt, too?

137
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:12,057
Maybe.

138
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,729
Time to charm.

139
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:18,314
Wait for my signal.

140
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:21,108
Ralph, what's this...

141
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:26,988
And here I thought the paintings would
be the most beautiful thing tonight.

142
00:07:28,116 --> 00:07:29,242
I was wrong.

143
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:32,578
Ralph Dibny.

144
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:34,747
January Galore.

145
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,252
I haven't seen you
at one of these events before.

146
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:42,255
That's because I spent the last year
on my island in Dubai.

147
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:43,881
My partner and I sold our corporation.

148
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:46,925
Barry?

149
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:54,642
Gingold martini. Shaken, not stirred.

150
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:57,979
Congratulations on selling
your corporation, Barry.

151
00:07:58,062 --> 00:08:01,983
I do hope you reinvested your profits
in collateralized loan obligations.

152
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:07,405
Yes. We recently sold our company
for many millions of dollars.

153
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:11,659
Do you know our host?

154
00:08:12,702 --> 00:08:13,870
Mr. Meyers?

155
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,163
Yes, Mr. Meyers.

156
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:20,084
The host of this event is
Remington Meister.

157
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:21,976
You both crashed this event, didn't you?

158
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,965
Would you like some free advice?

159
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:30,178
I'd leave before someone scary
comes and finds you.

160
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,893
Well, that did not go well.

161
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:38,436
Yes, it did.

162
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:41,647
Our VIP ticket.

163
00:08:43,316 --> 00:08:44,316
Finesse.

164
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,246
Harrison Wells?

165
00:08:58,331 --> 00:08:59,331
Ah!

166
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:02,168
- Okay. Who are you?
- Allegra.

167
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:05,880
You're the intern. So, maybe
you can help me with something.

168
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,506
Uh, I'm looking for a UV emitter,

169
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:13,596
and my scanner tells me
there is a UV emitter right around here.

170
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,932
You're supposed to be dead.
What happened?

171
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:17,135
Did you fake your own death?

172
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:19,810
Oh, no. So, you, uh...

173
00:09:20,228 --> 00:09:22,480
No. You think I'm Harrison Wells.
I'm not Harrison Wells.

174
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:24,106
My name is Nash.

175
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:26,025
Nash Wells.

176
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:28,569
You look just like him.

177
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:30,863
Yeah. Well, doppelgangers are like that.

178
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:45,544
This stupid Earth.

179
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:48,714
- Okay. Accelerant.
- Allegra.

180
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:50,341
I'm doing a dig. All right?

181
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:53,469
I need UV rays to complete my dig.

182
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,263
You, according to my gauntlet...

183
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,070
are a meta-human with UV capabilities.
You see where I'm going here?

184
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:02,270
You want me to use my powers
to help you?

185
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:04,313
- Yes!
- I can't help you.

186
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:07,149
- What? Why not?
- Never mind. The answer is no.

187
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,819
Allegra, I will make you a deal.

188
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:13,781
You help me with the UV thing,

189
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:17,493
and I will give you the...

190
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:19,662
scoop of the century.

191
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:23,833
Doppelgangers, multi-verse,
and potentially...

192
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:26,502
the end of all life...

193
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,421
as we know it.

194
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,799
Now, how does that sound to you?

195
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,720
Tell me more about this multi-verse.

196
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:40,099
The bank unfroze your accounts,

197
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,643
and maybe I erased your parking tickets

198
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:44,645
when I got
your driver's license reinstated.

199
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:46,188
Thanks, Cecile.

200
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,858
Oh, your clients are lucky to have you.

201
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:53,696
Hey, speaking of, I should let you
get back to doing your job.

202
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:56,365
Thank you so much
for everything that you've done.

203
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:58,034
Wait. You know what? Hey, Chester...

204
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,453
I got... I got a little time.

205
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:03,789
Is there... is there anything else
that you could use some help with?

206
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:06,375
Mmm, nope.
All is good in Chester-hood.

207
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:08,920
Don't go. Don't go.
Are you sure?

208
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:10,671
Like, are you sure, sure?

209
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,299
Anything at all
that I could help you with?

210
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:14,383
I mean, think hard.

211
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:18,220
There is something.
I knew it. Okay, sock it to me.

212
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,765
Jitters is gone. Right?

213
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,225
Which means that I'll never see...

214
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:27,063
uh, their coffee again.

215
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:31,275
Yeah. I'm thinking
that by "coffee" you mean Natalie?

216
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:34,653
I was gonna ask her out after
I filled in my Vibe-acino punch card.

217
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:35,737
But...

218
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,573
it's too late now.

219
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:39,324
So...

220
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:43,621
Sorry. I know this isn't
a lawyer problem at all. I...

221
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,247
No, it's not. But...

222
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,293
it is a meta-empath problem.

223
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,301
You got... you got powers?

224
00:11:57,385 --> 00:11:58,385
Oh, I got powers.

225
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,304
Oh, that's so cool.

226
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:01,597
That's so cool. Ah!

227
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,700
That must have been a major conflict
of interest as a DA, though.

228
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,728
It was. Yeah.

229
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:11,524
But those powers are about
to help you ask out Natalie.

230
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:14,068
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Let's do it. Okay. We're doing it.

231
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:30,084
Very few of my guests have the
<i>Tapferkeit</i> to challenge me like this.

232
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:31,876
After all...

233
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:34,880
I am the master of this ring.

234
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,968
Strict rules of mah-jongg?

235
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:40,845
But of course.

236
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,973
Oh, so, gentlemen...

237
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,809
I don't think we have been introduced.

238
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:49,979
I'm Remington Meister, your host.
And you are?

239
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:54,608
The name's Dibny. Ralph Dibny.

240
00:12:56,694 --> 00:12:58,320
Allen... Barry.

241
00:12:58,404 --> 00:13:01,782
Well, nice to meet you,
Allen Barry and Ralph Dibny.

242
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,366
Mmm.

243
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:06,412
And what brings you
to my wonderful <i>grosse Feier?</i>

244
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:11,667
Sue Dearbon.

245
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:16,629
Sue?

246
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:22,511
A, uh...
fiercely intelligent young woman.

247
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:25,097
She's a friend of yours?

248
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:26,181
Um...

249
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:29,143
I'm an admirer of hers.

250
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:30,686
A-ha.

251
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,773
You have taste, Mr. Dibny.

252
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:38,527
And I wish I could be a more
auspicious host and introduce you.

253
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:41,405
But I'm afraid Ms. Dearbon isn't here.

254
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:45,993
In fact, I don't think I have seen her
at any social event in over six months.

255
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:49,955
Perhaps she'll attend an event
in your vicinity soon.

256
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,208
And, uh, where was that <i>nochmal?</i>

257
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,541
- Paris.
- Dubai.

258
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,130
We run
a multi-city import-export company.

259
00:13:58,506 --> 00:13:59,506
Mmm.

260
00:13:59,924 --> 00:14:01,634
Maybe she's still on the guest list.

261
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:03,844
You know, just in case.

262
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,055
You think I should check?

263
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:10,518
Sure. Yeah.

264
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:11,768
Idna!

265
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:18,025
That's a beautiful dress.

266
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:20,236
Is it a one-of-a-kind?

267
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,446
Two-of-a-kind, actually.

268
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,908
Even the most stubborn designer's
one-of-a-kind outfit has a price.

269
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,994
So true. So true.

270
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:32,122
I'm impressed.
You have quite the eye for fashion.

271
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:33,998
Oh.

272
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:37,836
- Sue Dearbon is not on the list.
- Oh.

273
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,463
And strange...

274
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:41,923
Neither are you.

275
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,677
Well, when an auction
like yours pops up,

276
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,387
no list can keep us away.

277
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:50,848
I like you.

278
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:56,438
Him? <i>Nicht so viel.</i>

279
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:01,109
Ah!

280
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,070
Mah-jongg.

281
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:05,446
Sik wu.

282
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:06,656
I win.

283
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:08,993
Such a pleasure to meet you both.

284
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,703
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

285
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,166
I'm sorry, man. I thought I had that.

286
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,275
We should get back to Central City.

287
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,921
Put our friend above on high alert.

288
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,671
I tracked down the woman who designed
Sue's dress in Milan.

289
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:46,071
- Yeah?
- Turns out that Idna

290
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:47,715
did commission her to make another one.

291
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:49,509
So, I think
what we got to do next is probably...

292
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:50,784
But, Ralph, Sue's not here.

293
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,953
We just got made,
and we just hit a dead end.

294
00:15:53,037 --> 00:15:54,264
We should head back to Central City.

295
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:56,874
Barry, if Meister wanted us out of here,
we'd be gone already.

296
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,935
Take a whiff, would you?
Something doesn't smell right here.

297
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,420
Ralph, I know you care
about this Sue case.

298
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,547
But we're grasping at straws.

299
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,466
I'm not even sure
there's a mystery here.

300
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:06,842
Really? You're not sure?

301
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:10,307
You see that guy
with the eye patch right there?

302
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,014
That's Riggs Wellington.

303
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,682
He's a shady Bratva counterfeiter.

304
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:15,601
And January Galore?

305
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,353
She's an underground weapons dealer.

306
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,813
That guy right there,
he's a drug kingpin.

307
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,497
The woman he's talking to is a mob boss.

308
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:24,193
If this is a party for criminals,

309
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:26,485
then the Flash and Elongated Man
need to take over.

310
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:28,614
Pump the brakes, would you?

311
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:31,575
There's a time and place
for masks and cowls. But this is not it.

312
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,495
This Meister, he's up to something.

313
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:36,938
We need to find out what it is.
No matter how long it takes.

314
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,793
Ralph, tomorrow we have...
we have the deposition...

315
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:43,253
Lay off the whole deposition thing,
would you?

316
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:44,337
C.C.P.D. can wait.

317
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:46,006
I can search this whole place
in seconds.

318
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,485
Barry, I realize that you want to help
and I appreciate that.

319
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:49,843
But this is not Central City.

320
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,929
These people are not metas.

321
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,515
This is a time for our human identities.

322
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:56,809
Finesse. Remember?

323
00:16:58,102 --> 00:17:00,104
- I just need some time. Okay?
- Okay.

324
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:16,412
<i>Here's the deal.</i>

325
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:18,556
<i>I made a coffee order
with the new Jitters-To-Go service.</i>

326
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,957
That's where Natalie works now.

327
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,417
So when she arrives,

328
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:24,378
- I am going to read her emotion...
<i>- Mmm-hmm.</i>

329
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,939
...and then
I'm going to tell you what to say.

330
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:27,089
What if she says no?

331
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,800
She's not going to say no.
Not with my help.

332
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:31,552
And I'm here, too.

333
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,012
My good deed for the day
was to help somebody

334
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:36,014
and I couldn't find
anyone less annoying.

335
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,098
Really?

336
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,477
Hey, I have a delivery
for Chester P. Runk.

337
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,938
Yeah. That's... That's, uh...
That's me. Yeah.

338
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:46,066
Wow. Twelve Vibe-acinos.

339
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,066
Yeah.

340
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,610
Chester, she's feeling impressed.

341
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,488
Big order like that, it shows her
that you are a man of means.

342
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:54,575
Yeah, well, you know, I'm, uh...

343
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:56,368
kind of a big spender. You know?

344
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:58,162
Can't take it with you, right?

345
00:17:58,579 --> 00:17:59,579
Sure. I guess.

346
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:01,289
Do you need a receipt?

347
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,684
Are you sure you're reading her right?

348
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,001
Yeah. Of course.

349
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,210
Um...

350
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:09,006
Hey, Chester.
She's yearning for validation.

351
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:11,175
<i>So, pay her a compliment.</i>

352
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:14,094
She's feeling very strong
positive feelings about her shoes.

353
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:16,388
Uh...

354
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:18,432
I really like your shoes.

355
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:22,394
These old things? Yuck.

356
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,328
I lost my favorite kicks
to a black hole.

357
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,607
That's, uh... that's rough.

358
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,233
You are totally missing the mark.

359
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,235
You... You're not helping.

360
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,321
<i>Uh, Chester, be assertive.</i>

361
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:33,923
Don't let her leave
without asking her out.

362
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:36,658
Natalie, before you go...

363
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,577
I was wondering if...

364
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,370
<i>If we could, you know...</i>

365
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,956
I... I could carry this crate for you.

366
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,040
Oh.

367
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,291
It's not a problem.

368
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,187
<i>Yes, it is.
She wants you to be chivalrous.</i>

369
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:48,295
Help her, now.

370
00:18:58,388 --> 00:18:59,473
<i>Pardon moi!</i>

371
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:01,767
I can pay for those.

372
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,185
Yeah. I think you've done enough.

373
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:06,771
I'm no expert,

374
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:09,042
but <i>The Book of Ralph</i> says
that when you ask someone out,

375
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,567
you should just be yourself.

376
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:13,529
How is he supposed to be himself

377
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:16,073
when he doesn't even know
who he is anymore?

378
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:28,961
And these different Earths have
existed simultaneously since...

379
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:31,255
Well, since, uh... Let's see.
Oh, the dawn of time.

380
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:33,149
How come nobody knows about this?

381
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,276
I mean, stuff this big?
The public should be made aware.

382
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,844
People know. Just the right people.

383
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:39,012
The general public, no. No.

384
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:41,157
No, that would not be good.
They would lose their minds.

385
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,224
Right. I mean...

386
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,351
It's all so...

387
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:48,730
- epic.
- Yes. It's epic.

388
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:51,066
Doppelgangers, anti-matter events,

389
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:54,528
and speedsters juggling dual identities
like the Flash and Barry Allen.

390
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:57,697
Wait. What?

391
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,032
What?

392
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,743
My boss's husband is the Flash?

393
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:03,411
Mmm-hmm.

394
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:05,497
God. Nobody tells me anything.

395
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:07,684
But then, of course, let's not forget
the villain of the story.

396
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,167
The Monitor. Hmm.

397
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:12,629
Yeah. Cosmic imposter
with delusions of grandeur.

398
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:16,133
That is why
I want to take that fraud down...

399
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:17,925
permanently.

400
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:25,434
You're going to kill this... Novu guy?

401
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:27,768
Enough story time.

402
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,567
Time for you to hold up
your end of the bargain.

403
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:33,650
Wait. Can you, uh,
explain doppelgangers?

404
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,652
Sure, absolutely, I can. But first...

405
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,156
let's have you zap this
with your meta UV light

406
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,533
so I can find out
what rocks to avoid when I excavate.

407
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,202
And... go.

408
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:01,511
I... I can't.

409
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:03,972
Yes, you can.

410
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:05,599
You're a meta. It's who you are.

411
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,310
- No, it's not.
- It is. And also...

412
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:09,644
we had a deal.

413
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:10,845
- Well, the deal's off.
- What?

414
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:13,249
I... I'm not gonna be some weapon
you use to hurt others.

415
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,733
I'm not asking you to be the weapon.

416
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,276
It's not who I am.

417
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,524
All right, let's see what we got here.

418
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,763
Something tells me
that ain't a Johnny Cash song.

419
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:52,729
Damn it, Ralph. She's not here.

420
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,624
They're all here to bid on this.

421
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,205
Come on. Come on.

422
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:33,687
Meta target acquired.

423
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:35,939
<i>Wunderbar.</i>

424
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:52,039
Hey, hey.

425
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:53,832
Don't bother. It's meta-dampened.

426
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:54,915
I must say,

427
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:59,254
I did not expect Central City's
resident superhero

428
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,715
to crash my little gathering.

429
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:05,010
I must say, I'm surprised
by all the Bond villain clichés.

430
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,596
I mean, you've got the accent,
the diabolical scheme.

431
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,765
Even the silent-but-deadly henchperson.

432
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,809
Ultraviolet? I sent you to Iron Heights.

433
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:15,729
Luckily, she has friends in low places.

434
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,052
Well, let me guess.

435
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:19,483
You're gonna add my unmasking
to your little auction.

436
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:20,566
Oh.

437
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:24,654
I could care less about
your secret identity, Flash.

438
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:26,782
My interests are global.

439
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,409
And to think, Mr. Dibny,

440
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:33,830
that it was the Flash that set off
my meta-activity monitor,

441
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:38,418
that then triggered the security
protocols that got you caught.

442
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:40,504
<i>Danke schön.</i>

443
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,131
I am very curious, though...

444
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:47,052
as to why you are really here.

445
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:49,596
Do you expect me to talk?

446
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:51,348
No, Mr. Dibny...

447
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:54,476
I expect you to die.

448
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:57,771
Oh, come on! That line is
literally from <i>Goldfinger.</i>

449
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:00,857
And so is this.

450
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:03,776
Behold!

451
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:07,447
A state-of-the-art
industrial laser cannon.

452
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:09,449
It will shoot a deadly beam...

453
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:14,788
through the both of you
the moment Central City is destroyed.

454
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:19,214
You're gonna kill millions of innocent
people just to sell your weapon?

455
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:20,376
<i>Ja.</i>

456
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:22,294
Enjoy the show.

457
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:39,139
Got lost, didn't you?

458
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:40,604
What? No.

459
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:43,066
- No?
- Maybe.

460
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:45,651
Shut up.

461
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,155
I freaked you out, didn't I?

462
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:52,117
Watching Rag Doll eat
while in Iron Heights is freaky.

463
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:53,325
Sure it is.

464
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,747
So, why the disappearing act?
Actually, let me posit a theory on that.

465
00:24:57,831 --> 00:25:00,750
I think you're afraid
to use your powers,

466
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,919
because if you do,
you think you'll become like...

467
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:08,258
someone... someone...
someone you know.

468
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:09,341
Someone you...

469
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:12,136
hate.

470
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:13,846
How am I doing?

471
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:18,560
My cousin, Esperanza,
she has the same powers as me,

472
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:20,562
only she uses them to murder people.

473
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:26,067
You're not your cousin.

474
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:30,780
But if I start using my powers,

475
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:33,783
what's to stop me
from becoming like her?

476
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:36,745
Because, Allegra,
in this life we choose.

477
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:39,539
We choose who we are.

478
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:42,459
So if you choose
to use your incredible powers,

479
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:45,962
that does not make you
anything like Esperanza,

480
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:48,215
unless you choose that.

481
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,930
I'm not Esperanza.

482
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:56,263
Who are you?

483
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:59,100
- I'm Allegra.
- Yes.

484
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:02,854
Allegra Garcia.

485
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:04,355
Yes.

486
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,653
Well, that was anticlimactic.

487
00:26:09,677 --> 00:26:11,677
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

488
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,810
Did I do it?

489
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:45,896
Yes.

490
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:48,900
I think you did.

491
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:54,488
Hey.

492
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:58,367
How are you holding up?

493
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,786
Mmm...

494
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,789
Like Alderaan on a bad day.

495
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:06,543
You look pretty
emotionally vaporized, too.

496
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:09,921
Okay, Chester. I...

497
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:14,759
I think that I was using your problems
as a distraction

498
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:16,052
from my own feelings,

499
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:20,181
and my internal compass
was completely off,

500
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:22,892
and that made me sense the opposite
of what Natalie was feeling,

501
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:26,313
and I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

502
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:30,817
I've had these powers for two years now
and I'm still figuring them out.

503
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,320
How are you feeling now?

504
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:34,361
Oh, uh...

505
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:35,613
Honestly, I don't know.

506
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:37,907
Well, let's pretend I'm the empath.

507
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,594
What kind of feelings would
you be putting off?

508
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:41,618
Now, now...

509
00:27:41,953 --> 00:27:43,204
- Stare into my eyes.
- Okay.

510
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:47,167
And imagine my pupils are swirling...

511
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:51,296
and swirling, and swirling.

512
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:53,673
Okay, honey, that's a hypnotist,
not an empath,

513
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:55,675
but I really appreciate the effort,
yeah.

514
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:56,843
- Okay, right. Yeah.
- Uh...

515
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:58,261
How am I feeling? I'm...

516
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,222
Oh, my God. I'm freaking out.

517
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,391
You know, I was a DA for 20 years

518
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:06,478
and they just, boom,
replaced me overnight,

519
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:08,980
and now I feel like I don't exactly know
who I am anymore,

520
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:12,484
and if I fail at this meta-attorney
thing, I can't go back.

521
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,529
Yeah, but you didn't fail me.

522
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:21,993
You know, I think the two of us
just need to trust

523
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:25,538
that the real us will always
shine through.

524
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:29,918
Which is why I will embrace the new me

525
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:33,588
by finally asking out Natalie.

526
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:35,024
You know, seize the moment and all that.

527
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:36,299
Yeah.

528
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:39,219
And maybe you should, too.

529
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:41,638
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

530
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:52,857
Maybe I should, too.

531
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:58,084
I should have
listened to you.

532
00:28:58,613 --> 00:29:01,032
If we'd done things your way,
we wouldn't have gotten caught.

533
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:04,428
Maybe I should be handing Central City
over to Ralph Dibny

534
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:05,745
rather than Elongated Man.

535
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:07,497
What are you talking about?

536
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:09,249
There's no deposition.

537
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:11,793
I planned a press conference

538
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:16,005
to present you as Central City's
official protector.

539
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:17,339
Because of this coming Crisis,

540
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,634
I have to prepare the city
for a world without Flash.

541
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:21,010
Wow.

542
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:24,054
I'm, uh...

543
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:26,265
I'm honored...

544
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:28,935
that you think
that I could help fill your shoes.

545
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:32,522
Look, tonight's job was for Ralph Dibny.

546
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:35,692
Because both parts of my identity
have value.

547
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,153
The same is true for you.

548
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:41,281
Only tonight I could have used
your civilian half.

549
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:45,910
What I'm trying to say is,
Barry Allen...

550
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:48,663
is just as important as the Flash.

551
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:52,542
Try to remember that.

552
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:55,002
I know I will.

553
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:01,301
Now, can you reach my cufflink?

554
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:03,887
- What?
- Grab my cufflink.

555
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,224
Yeah. Got it.

556
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:10,602
All right, I got it.

557
00:30:10,603 --> 00:30:12,395
Okay, on three,

558
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,397
I want you to flick it
at that laser cannon.

559
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:17,275
One, two, flick.

560
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:21,488
I got it. It's down.

561
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:25,157
Uh-oh.

562
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:28,353
- Whoa, watch out.
- What was that?

563
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,416
- Okay. Uh, what do we do?
- I don't know.

564
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:36,044
Uh, what do we do?

565
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:38,004
Ahhh!

566
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:40,464
How do we stop that?

567
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:42,383
- There's a pattern.
- Really?

568
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:43,927
All right, when I say "now..."

569
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:46,471
fling ourselves to the left.

570
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:47,889
- Right.
- The left.

571
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:49,598
Now!

572
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:58,441
We have to stop Meister.

573
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:00,026
He's got Ultraviolet protecting him.

574
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,653
Her powers could kill us both.

575
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:04,781
Let's do things your way.
With a little finesse.

576
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:06,782
Time to suit up.

577
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:28,763
Good evening, <i>meine Freunde.</i>

578
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,641
The moment that you've
all been waiting for is here.

579
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:33,309
Let the auction begin.

580
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:38,815
The EYE-3C9 satellite system...

581
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:42,151
or as I like to call it,
"The Ring of Fire,"

582
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:46,990
is equipped
with 15 dioptric long-range missiles.

583
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:51,160
Simply use this console to enter
your desired coordinates,

584
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:53,204
and then sit back

585
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,667
and watch hellfire rain down
on your enemies.

586
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:01,879
Perhaps a little demonstration now.

587
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:02,963
Yes?

588
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:21,803
This isn't the bathroom.

589
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:27,238
Sorry. Sorry.

590
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,906
Mr. Allen Barry.

591
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:31,367
I see you have found the open bar.

592
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:33,795
Keep her busy till I can get
to that console.

593
00:32:33,995 --> 00:32:35,288
I'll bid on your stupid laptop.

594
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:38,291
Five hundred million.

595
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,835
Five hundred million and one... dollar.

596
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:42,712
<i>Price is Right</i> rules.

597
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:45,798
Ultraviolet,
gently escort Mr. Barry out,

598
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:47,967
but don't burn his money.

599
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:51,804
I love <i>Mortal Kombat.</i>

600
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:58,394
Mr. Dibny, we meet again.

601
00:32:58,603 --> 00:33:00,289
You got to take it easy on
the Bond quotes, man.

602
00:33:00,313 --> 00:33:01,689
Know what my favorite part is?

603
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:04,045
"Finish him."

604
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:07,070
You know, usually,
I allow Ultraviolet to do the killing...

605
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:15,328
but for you, I'll make an exception.

606
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,709
Come on.

607
00:33:48,361 --> 00:33:49,361
Fire in the hole.

608
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:46,878
Thanks for dropping in.

609
00:34:59,682 --> 00:35:01,434
Really? Adjusting your tie?

610
00:35:01,893 --> 00:35:02,977
Adjusting the flash.

611
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:29,045
Nice job, man.

612
00:35:36,344 --> 00:35:38,304
- Shocking.
- Your performance...

613
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:41,265
<i>Wunderbar,</i> Mr. Barry.

614
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:44,726
The name's Allen.

615
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:47,897
Barry Allen.

616
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:57,532
Remington Meister's crime ring is over.

617
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:00,733
Glad we got Remington,
but I'm sorry we didn't find Sue.

618
00:36:00,952 --> 00:36:03,222
My nose tells me there's more
to that case than I imagined.

619
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:04,455
- You'll find her.
- I will.

620
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:07,250
And in the meantime,
I'll be busy keeping Central City safe.

621
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:11,057
- Still on for that ceremony today, Joe?
- Oh, yeah. See you there.

622
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:17,760
So did you do it?
Did you embrace your new identity?

623
00:36:17,844 --> 00:36:19,279
Did you see Natalie?
Did you ask her out?

624
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:20,221
Did she say yes?

625
00:36:20,222 --> 00:36:22,056
Yes. Yes. And... no.

626
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:26,686
Chester, I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

627
00:36:26,811 --> 00:36:29,647
I've actually never felt better.

628
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:34,110
The last time I went to ask Natalie out,
I was scared as hell.

629
00:36:34,277 --> 00:36:36,279
Today, I conquered that fear.

630
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:38,197
You know, she said no,

631
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:40,241
but I said "yes" to me.

632
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:43,494
All right, well,
I am very happy for you.

633
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:44,786
I think.

634
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,470
Hey, you're...
you're marketing your firm.

635
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:51,794
Yeah, yeah. It is the first step
in embracing the new me.

636
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,378
Ah.

637
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:55,673
You know, I wanted to thank you
for your encouragement.

638
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:59,051
And speaking of encouragement,

639
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:01,846
you know,
you'd fit in nicely at S.T.A.R. Labs.

640
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:05,141
Don't be a stranger.

641
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:10,646
That... would be so...

642
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:14,525
epic... epic... epic...

643
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:15,984
Epic.

644
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:25,244
Here you go.

645
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:30,541
Ah.

646
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:31,917
Better?

647
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:34,462
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Yeah. You're welcome.

648
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:36,701
Why are you being so nice today?

649
00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:40,760
Let's just say you remind me of someone.

650
00:37:41,928 --> 00:37:44,805
- Another doppelganger?
- Something like that. Hey, um...

651
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:48,934
Good job.

652
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:19,256
For the last five years,
I've tried to keep Central City safe.

653
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,678
But as new threats arise,
you'll need more than me.

654
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:27,181
Which is why I'm proud
to recognize a hero

655
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:30,351
who's put his life on the line
for this city time and time again.

656
00:38:31,894 --> 00:38:34,063
A hero who deserves our recognition.

657
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:36,816
The Elongated Man.

658
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:45,866
Now, Central City has
another symbol of hope.

659
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:05,261
To every woman, every man
and every child listening today,

660
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:08,264
I have wanted to protect Central City

661
00:39:09,015 --> 00:39:11,142
since before I ever even got my powers.

662
00:39:12,226 --> 00:39:13,227
This is my home.

663
00:39:15,021 --> 00:39:16,105
And I love it here.

664
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,485
And so today I hereby promise
that I will defend Central City...

665
00:39:23,237 --> 00:39:24,655
with my dying breath.

666
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:34,540
Before we wrap up, there is someone
that Captain West and I

667
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:36,119
would like to bring up here.

668
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:38,919
CSI Barry Allen, please come up.

669
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,340
What are you doing?

670
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:50,973
Uh, those who wear capes and costumes

671
00:39:51,057 --> 00:39:53,225
aren't the only ones that keep us safe.

672
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:57,021
There are some unsung heroes as well.

673
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:58,396
Like this man.

674
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:05,279
This man has solved crimes
to give mourning families justice.

675
00:40:05,488 --> 00:40:09,658
He's a C.C.P.D. team member
who's never given up

676
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:11,660
on a single case.

677
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:16,540
This man has saved Central City
more times than anyone knows.

678
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:19,710
So it's time that we thank him.

679
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:24,673
It's time that... that I thank him.

680
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:28,302
So, without further ado...

681
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:32,306
Officer Barry Allen,
on behalf of C.C.P.D.,

682
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:36,143
we present you with their highest honor,
the Medal of Honor.

683
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:38,104
Thank you for your service.

684
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:06,924
Pretty cool, huh? Look how shiny it is.

685
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:09,009
Yeah, that's great, Ralph.

686
00:41:09,093 --> 00:41:12,012
- Um, is this why you wanted to meet me?
- Yes.

687
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:15,224
And I want to show you this.

688
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:17,601
I took it at Meister's party.

689
00:41:19,103 --> 00:41:20,312
I recognize that pin.

690
00:41:20,938 --> 00:41:22,538
Guess who else showed up in Midway City.

691
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:24,233
Ultraviolet?

692
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:27,570
Thanks, Ralph. <i>The Citizen's</i> on it.

693
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:46,172
Great press conference.

694
00:41:48,299 --> 00:41:49,884
I have a follow-up question.

695
00:41:49,908 --> 00:41:57,908
