<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

2

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,080
<i>To the outside world,</i>

4
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,040
<i>I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.</i>

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,470
<i>But secretly, with the help</i>

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,110
<i>of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

7
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,080
<i>I fight crime and find other meta-humans</i>

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,180
<i>like me.</i>

9
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,950
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

10
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,850
<i>It took everything in my friends' power</i>

11
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,780
<i>to bring me back, and in doing so</i>

12
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,050
<i>our world was opened up to new threats.</i>

13
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,890
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

14
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,670
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

15
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,810
<i>Previously on "The Flash."</i>

16
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,100
12 markers, 12 metas.

17
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,910
Your body's deteriorating faster

18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,170
than the chair can handle.

19
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,620
I didn't just take Dominic's body.

20
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,540
I took his ability.

21
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,540
Sylbert Rundine can shrink
objects and return them

22
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,770

23
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,370
Deacon controls technology.

24
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,410
Becky Sharpe can manipulate luck.

25
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,660
There's nothing keeping him
from going in the meta wing

26
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,030

27

30

Barry Allen is hereby

32

He wants their powers.

- Mm-hmm.

56

I was cleared of all charges.

57
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,420
I didn't do anything.

58
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,640
He's alive.

59
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,220
I know, and he's been cooperating,

60
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,720
coming in, answering questions.

61
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,050
So what's the problem?

62
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,090
Look...

63

People nowadays will believe anything.

64
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,780
Fake news, social media.

65
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,430
Allegations are treated as facts.

66
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,000
But DeVoe being alive?

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,670
Showing up in the courtroom

68
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,340
Some people in Central City

I mean, you need to prove
that DeVoe is still alive.

And you can do that now as The Flash.

102

Yeah, maybe.

103
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,700
How are we doing with him, by the way?

104
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,410
We know that we still have
four bus metas left to find.

105
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,740
And that DeVoe has absorbed
the powers of Killgore,

106
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,540
Hazard, Black Bison,
Brainstorm, and Dwarfstar.

107
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,850
Fallout is safe with Tracy.

108
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,980
But the Weeper is M.I.A.

109
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,120
Then DeVoe must have him.

110
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,450
Well, that just leaves Ralph.

111
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,050
Ralph is safe with us.

112
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,620
But the other four metas aren't.

113
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,090
DeVoe will absolutely kill
them and take their powers.

114
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,490
But why does he need their powers?

115
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,970
I can't figure out his end game.

116
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:48,940
I don't know.

117
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,780
I just know that these
last four metas are the key.

118
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,880
That's why we need to find them.

119
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,560
And find them we will.

120
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,770

otherwise known as the bus depot.

123
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,300
But I showed Cisco
here an old P.I. trick

124
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,840
I learned from my mentor, Columbo.

125
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,410
Lost and found box from meta bus 405.

126
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,080
Question for the room,
how did I get stuck

127
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,780
doing the buddy system thing with Ralph?

128
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,680
It's the best way to
keep Ralph safe, Cisco.

129
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,390
Yeah, it's the best way
to keep Ralph safe, Cisco.

Futon's not that bad.

Because you have powers.

Four months ago,

235
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,910
you were on Central City bus 405.

236
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,790
That bus got showered with dark matter

237
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,920
and made everyone on it a meta-human.

238

Now the person

- ripped through this.
- Exactly.

275
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,000
Sound is just the force of
billions of tiny gas molecules

it's her first day training

No, it seems like

into a hero.

taken her powers and her life.

He's willing to sacrifice
anyone and anything.

Um, you wanna tell me
how this thing works?

718
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,160
Like, does it... does it keep
Joe's brainwaves blocked out?

719
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,330
Does it keep my mind
reading waves locked in?

720
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,800
It mostly disrupts
inbound brain activity,

721
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:48,540
but I suppose actually if you
were to reverse the polarity...

anything to do with it.

Initially I envisioned the

760
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,630
as just disrupting inbound
brainwave broadcasts,

761
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,430
but I talked to DA Cecille Horton

762
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,020
and we had the idea to invert
the polarity allowing this

763
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,190
to disrupt outbound
brainwave broadcasts as well.

764
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,390
- So we...
- We could use this

765
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,460
against DeVoe.

766

00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,670
What are... What are those faces?

778
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,440
When Savitar came to S.T.A.R. Labs,

779
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,340
he said we would build a
device to use against DeVoe.

780
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,870
The cerebral inhibitor.

781
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,740
I wish I had known that
before I spent all this time

782
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,010
trying to come up with the second name.

783
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,250
Naming is hard.

784
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,910
Okay, so we can use this on DeVoe

785
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,820
to keep him from
projecting his consciousness

786
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,380
- into new bodies.
- Precisely.

787
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,520
How does it work?

788
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,960
Just affix it to his forehead.

789
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,410
It activates. Simple as that.

790
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,210
I'll make a few adjustments,
you'll be good to go.

791
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,080
All right.

792
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,090
Okay, when Harry's
done, we go after DeVoe.

793
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:23,010
I mean, we have Izzy's powers,
the cerebral inhibitor...

794
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,900
I mean, we have everything
that we need to stop him.

795
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,600
Except that we don't.

796
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,930
Izzy's gone.

797
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,280
What? What happened?

798
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,250
What did you say to her?

799
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,510
- Me?
- Yeah.

800
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,110
Rookie, Homeslice hit
the road because of you.

801
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,380
She's convinced she can
take on DeVoe by herself.

802
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,110
That's what she's gone to do.

803
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,850
You kept pushing and pushing her.

804
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,450
Pushed her right out the door, man.

805
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,410
Okay, that's not fair.

806
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,580
No, it's all right.

807
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,020
I did, I pushed her too hard.

808
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,290
It's my fault that she's out there.

809
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,000
But if DeVoe gets to her before we do...

810
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,420
That cannot happen.

811
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,230
Cisco, you need to use your
ESPN and find out where she is.

812
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,290

Yeah, well, he did.

952
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,830
- Because of me.
- We all tried to protect her.

953
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,290
I built the inhibitor, Snow.

And I don't even know why.

956
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,330
Maybe I overestimated
the micro-combustion

infrastructure, or
maybe I underestimated

the amount of time between

Harry!

- Where are you going?
- Out.

969
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,960
- Guys, we have to find DeVoe again.
- How?

970
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,680
Cisco tracked down
DeVoe in his Vibe state,

971
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,830
and he almost got himself killed.

972
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,590
Actually...

973
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,030
We might have a different
way of pinpointing him.

974
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,800
Check this out.

975

<font color="#ff00ff">[BEEPING]</font>

978
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,970
Now you don't.

979
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,180
That's exactly what it looks like

980
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,710
when DeVoe disappears.

981
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:37,980
That is the warping
signature of someone moving

982
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,120
into a pocket dimension.

983
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,280
Does someone wanna
explain what that means?

984
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,650
Einstein postulated that it
was theoretically possible

985
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,580
for a region-specific fold
in the space time to exist

986
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,400
between the four dimensions
that we typically think of.

987
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,560
Yeah, that doesn't help.

988
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,760
- It's...
- <font color="#ff00ff">[GROANS]</font>

989
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,600
It's another dimension.

One that you can enter or exit
at any location in the world.

991
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,670
Like how DeVoe captured me in that alley

992
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,370
but then he brought me back
out to somewhere above the city.

993
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,080
Are you saying that DeVoe's
lair is in a pocket dimension?

994
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,200
Cisco, this is great.

995
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,410

00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,450

00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,290
Especially someone you care about...

1081
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,430
<i><font color="#ffff00">♪ </font><font color="#ffff00">♪</i></font>

1082
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:17,970
Izzy was very special.

1083
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,200
She was.

1084
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,770
<i><font color="#ffff00">♪ </font><font color="#ffff00">♪</i></font>

1085
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:22,700
But... But now...

1086
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,440
<i><font color="#ffff00">♪ </font><font color="#ffff00">♪</i></font>

1087
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,480
<font color="#ff00ff">[SIGHS]</font> DeVoe's still out there.

1088
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,230
And until that threat's over...

1089
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,280
We gotta keep this buddy system going.

1090
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,610
<i><font color="#ffff00">♪ </font><font color="#ffff00">♪</i></font>

1091
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,980
<font color="#ff00ff">[SIGHS]</font>

1092
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,620
I thought you might say that, Allen.

1093
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,510
Which is why I got you this.

1094
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:43,790
<i><font color="#ffff00">♪ </font><font color="#ffff00">♪</i></font>

1095
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,390
You want me to be your partner?

1096
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,890
Oh, hey, come on.

1097
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,630
This, uh, this Turner
don't need no Hooch.

1098
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,170
But...

1099
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:53,800
I do know what it's like
to get fired from CCPD

1100
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,980
when you didn't even
really break the law.

1101
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,570
You absolutely broke the law.

1102
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:01,740
And I remember after I lost my job,

1103
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,810
felt like I lost a piece of my identity.

1104
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:07,600
And now you won't have
to deal with that problem.

1105
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,250
So the next time we're out in the field

1106
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,750
and somebody asks you who you work for,

1107
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,720
you won't have to get all stammery.

1108
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,120
<i><font color="#ffff00">♪ </font><font color="#ffff00">♪</i></font>

1109
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,120
You like me.

1110
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,590
You really like me.

1111
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,730
<font color="#ff00ff">[CHUCKLES]</font>

1112
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,160
<font color="#ff00ff">[GROANS]</font>

1113
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,800
Don't go getting all
soft on me now, rookie.

1114
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,430
<i><font color="#ffff00">♪ </font><font color="#ffff00">♪</i></font>

1115
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,870
You and I, we gotta stand up,

1116
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,470
and we gotta fight back.

1117
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,070
Just like Izzy would have wanted.

1118
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,510
That's right.

1119
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:33,640
There's three more people
out there who need our help,

1120
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,110
and we need to find
them before DeVoe does.

1121
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:39,510
And after we do that...

1122
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,280
I'm gonna take DeVoe down.

1123
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:56,290
