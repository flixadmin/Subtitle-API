1
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,633
Help me. Help me. Help me.

2
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,431
My cake is ready.

3
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,358
Time for the show.
Everybody on stage.

4
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,836
Ruby?

5
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,473
Is that you?

6
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,150
Goddamn it.

7
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,241
Ruby!

8
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,353
Ruby?

9
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,835
Ruby!

10
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,158
Ruby?

11
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,529
If that's you, Jupiter...

12
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,671
...I got some buckshot for you,
you hear me?

13
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,997
I told you, it's over!

14
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,354
I'm out, you hear me?

15
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,249
You're on your own now!

16
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,240
I -I

17
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,072
I'm sorry, I can't do this anymore.

18
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,080
Hello!

19
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,689
Hey!

20
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,489
It's hot out here.

21
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,289
Stay in the car, out of the wind.

22
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,209
Well, honey, I have to stretch my legs.

23
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,121
Where the hell is everybody?

24
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,409
Hello?

25
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,129
Hey.

26
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,917
- Get up, jackass.
- Bobby.

27
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:35,198
- Fill her up, check the fluids, my friend.
- Oh, yeah. Right away, sir.

28
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,318
- Beauty, stop it. No.
- Piece of shit.

29
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,834
Damn it.

30
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,160
You okay?

31
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,569
Tell me again why we couldn't fly
like normal people.

32
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,089
Right, they wouldn't let your dad
drive the plane.

33
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:57,289
Doug, relax. It's their silver anniversary,
and they're so happy you came.

34
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:01,489
- Your parents can't stand me.
- No, you're wrong. They love you.

35
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,529
I could have taken them on a cruise.

36
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:08,160
You know what? Stop.
I never ask you for anything, okay?

37
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:13,317
Just think how happy you'll be when
Catherine comes along on our 25th.

38
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,729
It's okay.

39
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,881
It's not gonna be
in a fucking trailer home.

40
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,689
Don't see too many travelers
around here. Where y'all headed?

41
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,080
- San Diego.
- California?

42
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,169
Sure didn't take the fastest road.

43
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,849
Oh, no. We absolutely had to see
the desert.

44
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,369
- Didn't we, Bob?
- Absolutely.

45
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,849
There ain't nothing to see
in the desert.

46
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,512
Really? Do you hear that, honey?

47
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,795
Yeah.

48
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,155
Don't you know it's illegal
to smoke around a gas pump?

49
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,760
Yeah.

50
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,009
Come here. Where's your mom?
He's a good little piggy.

51
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,969
Little baby piggy. Little baby piggy.

52
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,889
Hey, Bobby, come over here.

53
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,689
- Look at this.
- Oh, my God.

54
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,409
That's so random.

55
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,514
You two make a perfect pair.

56
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,397
You're sweet. Yeah.

57
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,289
What are you doing? Don't pee there.

58
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,409
What the hell do you care?
Just turn around for a second.

59
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,150
Hello?

60
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,714
Don't you see that?

61
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,849
Excuse me, you have a phone I can use?
I can't get a signal.

62
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,729
No, I don't.

63
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,649
Hey, Bukowski.
Give the cell phone a rest.

64
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,595
Sorry, Bob. Duty calls.

65
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,889
Honey, you've been on the phone
since we left. Really.

66
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:19,609
I've been gone. I have to make sure
my store's not burning to the ground.

67
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,953
Oh, God.

68
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,997
Thanks, Brenda.

69
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,478
What the hell, Brenda?!

70
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,280
Damn it.

71
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:45,289
- Damn it, got it all over my hand.
- How far are we from I-88?

72
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,729
- Freaking perv.
- What?

73
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,569
At least five or six hours away.

74
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,289
You hungry, sweetie?

75
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,129
Why couldn't we have gone
through Santa Fe?

76
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,769
Could you put a cork in it.

77
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:00,289
Well, if I do say so myself, ma'am,
your husband here's quite right.

78
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,289
This is the only southbound road
going to I-88.

79
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,569
From there, you can take the 40
to California...

80
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,369
...but it's a long, old drive.

81
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,049
That doesn't bother me.
I like to drive at night.

82
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,449
I used to work the night patrol
for 15 years.

83
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,689
- Is that right? You a cop?
- Detective.

84
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,729
Not anymore, thank God.

85
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:22,154
I'm starting my own security firm.

86
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,569
You a cop too, mister?

87
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,689
No. I'm in telecommunications.
I sell cell phones.

88
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,689
Well, hell, you won't find
any customers around here.

89
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,635
Yeah, no kidding.

90
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,355
Everything's fine. Oil's okay.

91
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,129
Beauty, come back here!

92
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:42,521
Hey! Buddy, what do I owe you?

93
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:47,089
- Forty-six dollars, even.
- Bob, here, let me take care of that.

94
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,609
I can still afford the gas, Bukowski.

95
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,875
- Keep the change, my friend.
- That's not what I meant.

96
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,249
Beauty?

97
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,593
Beauty?

98
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,234
Beauty?

99
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:08,472
Beauty? Come on, girl.

100
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,479
Beauty?

101
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,232
Beauty, come on, girl.

102
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,715
Hello?

103
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,952
Is anyone there?

104
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,755
Beauty.

105
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,034
- Beauty, what are you doing?
- Can I help you, miss?

106
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,129
I'm sorry. It's just our dog. She just...

107
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,409
She got out and she won't stay put.

108
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,675
- Lynn! We're leaving!
- Come on, girl. Let's go.

109
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:10,313
- That's all right. I got her.
- Okay.

110
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,769
Honey? Honey? Could you tell him
to take it a bit easy?

111
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,671
- The heat's making me nauseous.
- Let's go!

112
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,169
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

113
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,559
Honey, we're on vacation.

114
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,671
- Yeah?
- You know...

115
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,569
...it's not on the map...

116
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:46,315
...but if you take a left at the dirt road
couple miles from here...

117
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,689
...it'll lead you through the hills,
probably save you a couple of hours.

118
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,529
Can't miss it.

119
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,809
There's an old fence right in front.

120
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,409
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

121
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,689
Old fence, dirt road, two miles.

122
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,273
- You have a safe trip.
- Thank you.

123
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,559
Dad, I hate your singing.

124
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,320
Guys, no.

125
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,089
Can you imagine the first people
to cross this desert?

126
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:27,649
- They didn't know where they were.
- I can, because neither do we.

127
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:33,049
Brenda, the road is here, right?
It exists. It's got to go somewhere.

128
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:36,249
Besides, look how beautiful it is.
The light on the rocks.

129
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,289
It's gorgeous.

130
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,249
This is so fucked.

131
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,754
Excuse me.
Watch your language, young lady.

132
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,649
I would like a little backup here.

133
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,569
This is such bullshit.

134
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,009
- Hey, watch your fucking mouth.
- Can we just calm down here?

135
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,929
- We're all a little tired, okay?
- Yeah, Mom.

136
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:58,639
Didn't you grow up in the '60s?
Why are you so uptight?

137
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:02,969
Your mom didn't used to be uptight.
She was a little hippie chick.

138
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,489
- No.
- Yeah.

139
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,649
You should've seen her at your age.
She was a little hottie.

140
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,835
- Dad.
- Stop that.

141
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:19,369
Driving through the New Mexico desert
in the middle of summer...

142
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,089
...with a broken air conditioner.

143
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,849
Great vacation.

144
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,729
Well, I'm glad you came...

145
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,289
...because I would have been
so fucking bored otherwise.

146
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,049
Yeah.

147
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,791
So bored.

148
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,049
Give up on that, man.
I tried for an hour and a half.

149
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,689
Thing's ancient. Wiring's medieval.
Needs to be replaced.

150
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,760
There.

151
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,689
There. It's just the thermostat.

152
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:53,409
- It was disconnected.
- Anyway...

153
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,992
...at least we can breathe now.

154
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,889
Hey, I thought you quit smoking.

155
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,169
- Does my sister know?
- Hey, man...

156
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,240
...fuck your sister.

157
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,449
You know, Big Bob would
get pretty pissed off...

158
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:17,449
...if he found out you were smoking
in his newly renovated '88 Airstream.

159
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,809
Yeah? Well, fuck Big Bob too.

160
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:24,837
Here. Want one? Go ahead.

161
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,209
Your sister would cut my nuts off
if you started.

162
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,249
I think she did that a long time ago.

163
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,434
I think you're right.

164
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,329
I think we're on this blue road.

165
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,929
Mom, we're not on the blue road
or any other road.

166
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,558
The guy said it wasn't
on the map, remember?

167
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,556
Oh, my God!

168
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,801
Hang on!

169
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,273
Watch the baby!

170
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,849
Honey? Where's the baby?
Where's the baby?

171
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,449
She's right here. She's fine.

172
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,529
- What the hell?
- What the hell happened?

173
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,489
The heat must have caused a blowout.

174
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,049
- Are you okay? You sure?
- Yes, I'm fine. I'm just a little shaken up.

175
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,369
- God. . ..
- Where's Bobby?

176
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,476
Bobby? Are you all right, honey?
Are you okay?

177
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,113
He's all right.

178
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,875
I knew this wasn't safe for the baby.
We're okay! Fine!

179
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,115
Son of a bitch!

180
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,089
Okay, okay. We're all right.

181
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,049
- The whole trailer...
- I know, I know.

182
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,329
Come here, guys. Come here.

183
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,969
Beauty!

184
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,279
Beast!

185
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,880
We are so fucked.

186
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,849
- Did you find a signal?
- No. Nothing.

187
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,129
Ninety-seven percent
nationwide coverage.

188
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,440
- We find ourselves in that 3 percent.
- Yeah.

189
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,120
Your dad wanted to see the desert.
Hope he's enjoying himself.

190
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,169
Doug, don't start.

191
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:30,049
- Maybe somebody will need a rent-a-cop.
- Doug.

192
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,409
- What?
- Come on.

193
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,889
Every chance he gets,
he takes me down a peg.

194
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,689
I can't snap back at him?

195
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:38,889
Yeah, well, don't stoop to his level.

196
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,689
Two hundred degrees out here.
It's everybody's fault.

197
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:44,169
It's all of you. Get off my back.

198
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,752
General? What's the damage?

199
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,397
The axle is broken. And it's...

200
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,729
...totaled.

201
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,595
Can we fix it?

202
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,314
What?

203
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,649
The frame is twisted to hell.
We can't...

204
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,879
With what? I mean...

205
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,769
Give me your cell phone.
I'll call a tow truck.

206
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,929
No signal. I tried.

207
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,159
Well, we can use the CB.

208
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,489
Try, but I doubt you're
gonna get anybody.

209
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,392
The freeway's on the other side
of those hills. You won't get a signal.

210
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,513
So, what are we gonna do?

211
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,996
Excuse me.

212
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:36,395
Bob? What are we doing?

213
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,274
We walk.

214
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:45,671
- We walk?
- Yeah. You and me.

215
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:50,921
We're in the middle of the desert.
We're miles from anywhere.

216
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,809
Well, it's either that...

217
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,329
...or we sit and wait
for somebody to drive by.

218
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,049
Seen anybody drive by
since we got off the freeway?

219
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,769
I haven't seen anyone
since you took the shortcut.

220
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,921
- Honey, let's go for a walk.
- Okay.

221
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,919
There's nothing there, you shitheads.

222
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,355
I'm sure this desert is full
of rattlesnakes.

223
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,609
- I think that's locked.
- Bobby, come here.

224
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,129
- Yes, sir.
- Thanks, honey.

225
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,155
You're welcome.

226
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,117
- You know, I saw... Mom?
- What?

227
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,089
- Safety's on, boy.
- Yes, sir.

228
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:46,769
I saw a documentary
on desert snakes...

229
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,569
...on the Discovery Channel.
There's some species...

230
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,409
...if you get bit, you die within,
like, 25 minutes.

231
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:55,809
Really? I'd like to see
how they stack up against this one.

232
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,529
I thought this was gonna stay
locked up, honey.

233
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:02,318
- I thought you weren't talking to me.
- You're right.

234
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:07,129
Relax, I'm a licensed professional.
I'll take my bullets over your prayers.

235
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,849
Some things never change.

236
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:13,639
So what about, like,
scorpions and coyotes and stuff?

237
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,751
Praise the Lord,
and pass the ammunition.

238
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,729
- Hey, Doug. You wanna try?
- Hey! Don't point that at me!

239
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,641
Don't worry. The safety's on.

240
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,609
- Bobby?
- Yeah?

241
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:31,399
Leave Doug alone. He's a Democrat.
He doesn't believe in guns.

242
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,689
Oh, come on, Dougie.

243
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,409
Come here. Just one shot.

244
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:38,129
It makes you feel kind of powerful.
You might like it.

245
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:41,209
I don't think so.
I'd probably just shoot my foot off.

246
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,280
You know, he's right.

247
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,117
He'd probably shoot his foot off.

248
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,157
- Hey, B.
- Hey.

249
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,395
How you holding up?

250
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,473
I am thrilled.

251
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:11,489
Yeah. This is a total drag.

252
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:14,529
Yeah, well, you know,
I really don't care what they say.

253
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:18,089
Next year, I am going to Cancun
with my friends.

254
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,609
Not going on any more
of these family trips.

255
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:23,969
Well, we're not gonna have
many more of them, you know?

256
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:27,917
And if you wanna go to Cancun,
you're gonna have to get a job.

257
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:31,400
Oh, yeah.
What, you mean like your job?

258
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:36,032
Brenda, I help Doug out
at the store, okay?

259
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,409
Yeah.

260
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:41,197
Honey, can you bring me my jacket?

261
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,679
I'll be right there, honey!

262
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,849
Bobby! Fucker!

263
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:16,478
- Could you get me a Twinkie?
- No.

264
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,529
I'll walk in this direction.

265
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,929
Fine. Find out where the road leads,
I'll head back the way we came.

266
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,319
- Stay away from me.
- All right.

267
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,729
Road's gotta lead somewhere.

268
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,249
- Maybe to the freeway.
- Are you taking a gun too?

269
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:53,449
No. No, honey, I'm not.
I don't need a gun to find help.

270
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,609
- No, I don't want this.
- You need the hat.

271
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,489
- You're walking in the desert.
- It gives me hat head.

272
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,889
- It's not about fashion.
- All right. Thank you.

273
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:06,521
Listen, if you don't find help within
five or six miles, just come back.

274
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,289
- Here, honey.
- I'm gonna go to the gas station.

275
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,769
You're just never gonna make it back
by sunset is the only problem.

276
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,009
Honey, it's only about eight miles.

277
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,489
I'll borrow the old man's car,
use his phone.

278
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,849
I'll be back with a tow truck
before nightfall.

279
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:25,009
- Can I go with Doug?
- No. Stay with your mother and sisters.

280
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:29,449
Now, Brenda, listen up.
Your brother is in charge, all right?

281
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:32,369
- So don't tease him.
- We should pray before you go.

282
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:36,369
- Oh, Mom!
- Brenda, is it really so much to ask?

283
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:39,111
- Yes.
- Come on.

284
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,554
- Damn it.
- We're waiting.

285
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,558
Thank God no one's watching us.

286
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:51,040
- Bobby. Stop.
- Stop it.

287
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:57,969
Please bless us at this time, and send
your guardian angels to help us...

288
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:01,449
...to walk through this valley,
in our faith...

289
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,969
...with the help
of our dear Lord. Amen.

290
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,889
- Amen.
- Amen.

291
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,329
Okay.

292
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:10,071
- Bye, Dad.
- Be careful.

293
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:12,951
See you guys in a few hours.

294
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,089
Keep the hat on, okay?

295
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,929
- Am I wearing it?
- Don't give me that look.

296
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,512
- Do you see it on my head?
- I love you.

297
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,289
Hi.

298
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:37,634
Hi, sweetness. Hello.

299
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,236
Who doesn't wanna sleep anymore?

300
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,769
Are you hungry?

301
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:46,929
Please take your feet off the table.

302
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:52,049
Honestly. Just because we're camping
doesn't mean you get to act like a pig.

303
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,049
Honey, really, you shouldn't go...

304
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,849
...from the breast to bottle,
breast to bottle.

305
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,529
At her age, she should
get used to one or the other.

306
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:04,274
Mom, thanks for the advice,
but she's my baby.

307
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:12,609
I can't believe we're stranded in the
middle of nowhere on your anniversary.

308
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:17,049
If we just stayed on the main road,
we'd be in California right now.

309
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:21,111
What I'd give for a hot shower
and a cold margarita.

310
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,240
The beach.

311
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,809
- A massage.
- I'll take a real bed.

312
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,249
- Yeah.
- The chronic.

313
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,639
- What?
- Brenda.

314
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,329
- What?
- The chronic...

315
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:36,559
It's pot, Mom.

316
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:40,876
- Who smokes pot?
- Yes, exactly, who smokes pot?

317
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:43,609
Hey, has anybody seen
my red sweatshirt?

318
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:47,329
You know, the hoodie thing
in the back seat? Brenda?

319
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,369
Weren't you, like, sleeping on it?

320
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,032
I haven't touched
your smelly sweatshirt.

321
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,769
Why are the dogs so excited?

322
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:57,329
There's probably some rattlesnakes
somewhere around.

323
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,689
You know how Freud
would have interpreted...

324
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:02,089
...your obsession
with rattlesnakes, Mom?

325
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:05,529
Bobby. So bad.

326
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,129
- Bobby Carter! Stop that.
- Gross.

327
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,769
So wrong.

328
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:13,249
That was a little gross.
I'm sorry. I apologize to the table.

329
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,990
Well, thank you.

330
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:19,369
I'm really glad that we all came
on this trip together.

331
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:22,271
Well, that makes one of us.

332
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,809
- Where is the fruit?
- Does anyone need anything?

333
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,641
No.

334
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:35,409
Brenda? Are you kidding me?!
Do you know how long...?

335
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,249
- Bobby!
- Sorry.

336
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,929
- Bobby, it's dinnertime!
- I'll get him, Mom.

337
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,529
- This always happens.
- Bobby!

338
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:47,001
I don't want you going away
from the trailer right now.

339
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:50,320
Beauty!

340
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:01,399
Beauty!

341
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:30,121
Beauty!

342
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:11,112
Beauty!

343
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,554
Fuck!

344
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,121
What the hell?

345
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:29,360
Look at that.

346
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:03,838
Hello?

347
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,519
Hello?

348
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,839
Hey, buddy?

349
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,794
Hello.

350
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,832
Hello!

351
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:54,152
Hey, I had a bit of a wreck
out on your shortcut.

352
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:57,194
Yo!

353
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:06,475
I got some water, all right?

354
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,649
It's dead. Damn.

355
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:19,849
Yo, my friend! Hey!

356
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:22,089
You here?

357
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,592
You home?

358
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:59,114
Hello?

359
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:03,193
Hello?

360
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:18,351
You son of a bitch.

361
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,761
Yeah.

362
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:39,358
Jupiter.

363
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:45,409
I got a buckshot, you hear?

364
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:47,753
Hey, mister.

365
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:53,489
You don't understand
what's going on here.

366
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,594
Hey!

367
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,889
The kids...

368
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:04,169
...grew up in the mines
like wild animals.

369
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:07,276
Open the door, slowly!

370
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:13,481
What kind of place
is that for children?

371
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,289
What kind of a place is that?

372
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:21,249
Okay. Put the weapon down.
Put it down, easy.

373
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:23,593
Put it down.

374
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:27,049
I did the best I could.

375
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,881
- I'm sorry.
- Hey!

376
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,154
Shit.

377
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:35,679
Daddy.

378
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:39,836
Daddy.

379
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:47,609
Daddy. Daddy.

380
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:50,317
Daddy.

381
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:56,992
Daddy. Daddy.

382
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:08,353
Daddy.

383
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:32,809
Would you give me that gun, Pluto!

384
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,929
- Give me the darn gun.
- Get over here.

385
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:38,752
- That's mine.
- Come on! You oughtn't to have a gun.

386
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:57,953
Brenda!

387
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,835
Brenda!

388
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:10,274
Hey, I'm here!
I'll be back in a minute!

389
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:14,409
Bobby!

390
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:17,595
Bobby?

391
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:22,153
Bobby.

392
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:31,235
Bobby.

393
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:50,281
Bobby!

394
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:59,569
Okay, let me just...
Oh, honey, the hair.

395
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:00,889
Just...

396
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:04,169
You know, you really are so lucky
that Brenda found you.

397
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:08,834
I mean, what if you'd had to spend
the whole night out there in the cold?

398
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,369
Hey, Bobby.

399
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:15,158
Don't worry. Beauty will come
back when she's hungry, okay?

400
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:20,849
- Did you try the radio?
- It doesn't work.

401
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,449
But we heard something.

402
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,329
Some sort of breathing.

403
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:27,673
What breathing?

404
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:30,609
It was weird. Right, Mom?

405
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:33,049
I'm sure it was just static.

406
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:34,689
Mom!

407
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:38,289
It sounded like a perverted call.

408
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:42,590
Only Mom would get an
obscene phone call out here.

409
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:45,393
Bobby. What...?

410
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:50,834
- Honey?
- No, no! I want you guys to stay here.

411
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:57,597
What is wrong with him?

412
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:08,077
What's he doing?

413
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:22,194
Shit.

414
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,849
Beasﬂ

415
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:29,169
- BeasU
- Hey, Bobby

416
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:31,489
- Jesus Christ!
- Hey, whoa!

417
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:34,880
Stop pointing the gun at me. Please.

418
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:38,209
- Jesus, Bobby.
- Doug, I'm sorry, man.

419
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:40,209
It's me.

420
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:42,689
- You okay?
- Yeah.

421
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:45,079
God.

422
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,849
I didn't mean to startle you, man.

423
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:50,129
I found this place.
You wouldn't believe it.

424
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:52,209
It's like The Twilight Zone.

425
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,689
- Hey.
- Is that Bob?

426
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,929
- It's Doug. It's Doug.
- It's okay.

427
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:58,529
Oh, honey. Oh, my God.

428
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:00,689
Thank God you're okay.
I was so worried.

429
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:03,889
No, I'm fine. Just exhausted.

430
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:06,249
- Look at all this stuff I found.
- What is this?

431
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,769
There's a huge crater out there.

432
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:12,729
People must use it as a dumpsite.
I've never seen anything like it in my life.

433
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,609
A lot of this stuff is brand-new.

434
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:17,129
What are we gonna do with
a fishing pole out here?

435
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:20,969
- I thought you went to find somebody.
- The road dead-ends in five miles.

436
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:23,449
That's where the crater is.
It's not a shortcut.

437
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:24,809
- It dead-ends?
- Dead end.

438
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:27,809
- That old man was full of shit.
- I hope your dad did better.

439
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:29,929
Maybe we just missed a turn.

440
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,929
You guys cook any dinner?
I'm starving.

441
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:34,956
- Yeah. Come on in.
- Great. Thanks.

442
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:38,369
Brenda, you have any lip balm?
My lips are really dry.

443
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:41,809
Are you serious? That's gross.
I'm not letting you use my lip balm.

444
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:44,756
Do you use it without telling me?

445
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:04,154
- There's nothing wrong with him...
- Baby needs to go to bed.

446
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:09,169
Wait, Bobby, don't close that door.
We're leaving in a second.

447
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:11,689
Get some rest with Daddy.

448
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:14,049
You guys aren't gonna wait
till Dad gets back?

449
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:17,169
No, Bobby, I'm exhausted.
I need to get some sleep.

450
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:20,089
No, no, no. It's fine.
You'll be more comfortable here.

451
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:22,129
Because I'll sleep on the floor.

452
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:24,969
Mom and Brenda will be up front,
you and Lynn in back.

453
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:27,209
We got extra sleeping bags
and stuff too.

454
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:31,649
Bobby, you got six people sleeping in a
three-person trailer. It's not comfortable.

455
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:34,289
It's a little bit weird. Okay?

456
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:38,317
- Honey, you gonna bring the water?
- Yeah.

457
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:42,889
- Hey, Doug. Can I talk to you?
- What's up?

458
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:46,678
- Baby, you coming?
- I'm almost ready.

459
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:49,193
What's going on?

460
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:52,073
When I...

461
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:54,089
- Bobby.Bobby.
- No,no,no.

462
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:58,209
Hey, I'm sure your dad's
gonna be back soon, okay?

463
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:01,769
I mean, come on.
He's Big Bob, right?

464
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:06,529
It's gonna take more than a couple
of snakes and scorpions to stop him.

465
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,009
Okay?

466
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:09,609
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

467
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:11,396
Did you get pillows?

468
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:14,279
They're in the SUV.

469
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:18,129
Hey, hey, listen.

470
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:21,969
If he's not back by midnight,
we'll both go looking for him. Deal?

471
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:24,249
- Yeah. Deal.
- Okay.

472
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,449
- Get some rest, man.
- Good night, Bobby.

473
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:28,156
Good night.

474
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:32,609
What are you doing?
There's no mosquitoes in the desert.

475
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:35,158
Honey,
there's mosquitoes everywhere.

476
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:39,800
Hi.

477
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:49,801
Beast

478
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,234
Beast?

479
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:16,679
Beast?

480
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,874
Beasﬂ

481
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:24,633
Beast

482
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:29,154
Beast

483
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:54,479
Beast

484
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:57,969
Beast?

485
00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:01,440
Beasty? Come here, boy.

486
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:12,754
Beast?

487
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:40,009
GUYS! Guys!

488
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:41,489
- Oh, God.
- Guys. Open.

489
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:44,596
- Jesus.
- Bobby

490
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:46,369
What is it, Bobby?

491
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:49,569
- Something is going on around here.
- What is it?

492
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:52,596
There are people or something
living in those hills.

493
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:54,809
- People?
- No, no, no. Doug.

494
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:57,329
- Doug, please.
- Bobby. Bobby, listen to me.

495
00:52:57,330 --> 00:53:01,569
We're in the middle of nowhere, okay?
Nobody lives in those hills.

496
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:03,049
Beauty's dead.

497
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:05,249
- What?
- I found her...

498
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:08,249
...and she was, like...

499
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:11,249
It looked like somebody had, like,
cut her open, you know?

500
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:14,049
- Cut her open?
- Yeah. I didn't want to say anything...

501
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:16,449
...because I didn't want to
scare everyone...

502
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:19,009
...and I didn't wanna get Mom upset.

503
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:22,009
But I'm telling you,
there is something going on, okay?

504
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:24,129
And Dad's not even back yet.

505
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:26,917
Okay. All right. Stay right there.

506
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:29,752
I'll come check this out.

507
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:32,089
We're not alone.

508
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:35,649
All right, Lynn, you stay here,
you lock the car, okay?

509
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:39,040
We're gonna check this out.
Now, where did you see this?

510
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:41,755
Now!

511
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:53,409
- It's Bob.
- Wait. We don't know what that is.

512
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:55,569
- It's Bob!
- We don't know what that is!

513
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:57,809
- Bob! I'm coming.
- Dad?

514
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:00,438
Dad! Help!

515
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:03,876
Brenda, watch the baby.

516
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:32,400
No!

517
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:55,080
Get back!

518
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:03,911
Hey, little birdie. Hey, little birdie.

519
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:30,912
Get your mother out of here!
Get your mother out of here!

520
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:34,037
Doug! Do something!

521
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:47,072
You've gotta be a man to do that!

522
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:57,631
I told you to move, so move!

523
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:03,431
Get! Get!

524
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:20,280
Fuck off!

525
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:21,159
Not my Bob!

526
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:23,849
- It's not my Bob!
- Come on, Mom. Let's go.

527
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,761
No, just come on.

528
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:31,129
What was that?

529
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:33,997
Mom, just stay here, okay?

530
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:47,150
Help! Help!

531
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:50,356
Oh, you fat.

532
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:55,955
Big, fat and juicy.

533
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:15,676
No. No, please!

534
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:34,089
Bobby!

535
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:35,409
Bobby, where you going?

536
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:37,489
Fucking kill those motherfuckers!

537
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:40,516
Get back here!
Don't do something stupid!

538
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,321
They're in the trailer!

539
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:07,809
- Get her out of the door!
- Help!

540
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:09,409
Stop it! Shoot him!

541
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:11,009
Brenda!

542
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:13,449
- Help me!
- Come on, now.

543
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:16,009
- Look at me. Look at me.
- Stop, stop.

544
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:18,969
That's it. Look at me.

545
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:21,120
Shit!

546
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:24,441
- I'll come back for you.
- Brenda!

547
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:28,919
Bitch stuck me like a pig!

548
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:46,561
Are you okay? Are you okay?

549
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:15,769
Oh, God! Don't move.

550
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:17,689
Don't move, honey. Don't move.

551
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:20,049
Okay. Okay. All right.
You're gonna be okay.

552
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:22,489
You're gonna be okay.

553
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:25,834
Sweetheart. Okay.

554
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:28,314
Honey?

555
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:30,679
Sweetheart?

556
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:33,397
Lynn, come on!

557
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:35,834
Lynn!

558
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:39,959
Come on.

559
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:51,761
What are we gonna do, huh?

560
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:55,792
What are we gonna do if
they come back, Doug?

561
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:06,049
This trailer is so small.
I clean and clean.

562
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:08,314
It's still a mess.

563
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:11,279
It's a mess.

564
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:15,276
Is Big Bob home?

565
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:17,754
Not yet.

566
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:23,409
Everybody went to bed?

567
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:24,769
- Yes?
- Yeah.

568
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:28,399
Brenda's right here
and Bobby's in the back.

569
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:31,594
Lynnie's sleeping?

570
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:38,196
You need anything?

571
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:41,159
A blanket.

572
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:43,997
- It's cold. It's cold.
- Okay.

573
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:48,357
Nice and warm, huh?
Nice and warm.

574
01:03:57,610 --> 01:04:01,159
You're so sweet, Doug.

575
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:07,675
I understand why Lynnie
loves you so much.

576
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,729
I'm not gonna take this shit.

577
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:25,009
We're not going anywhere.
You wanna die too?

578
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:27,609
- I don't fucking care!
- Do you wanna die?!

579
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:31,129
Look what they did to your mother!
Look what they did to your sister!

580
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:33,609
You need to think.
You're not a child anymore.

581
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:36,929
You won't make it three feet out there.
Now, we need a plan.

582
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:39,159
We need to think.

583
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:41,249
- We need to think.
- Think about what?!

584
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:45,329
They have Catherine, your daughter,
and you're gonna sit and do nothing?!

585
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:47,369
You're a pussy,
just like my dad said!

586
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:49,969
You shut the fuck up!
Shut up! Shut your mouth!

587
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:52,489
Fuck you.

588
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:54,594
Goggle?

589
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:56,929
- Goggle?
- No!

590
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:59,729
Turn the lights on.
Turn the lights on.

591
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:02,409
Turn the lights on.

592
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:05,289
- He said he's coming back.
- Quiet.

593
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:08,999
He said he's
coming back for me. Please.

594
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:12,089
It's them.

595
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:14,638
It's them. It's them.

596
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:24,513
Goggle?

597
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:11,849
Goggle?

598
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:14,193
You copy, Goggle?

599
01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:18,609
Where's Goggle?

600
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:22,369
He stayed back there.
He's keeping an eye on them.

601
01:06:22,370 --> 01:06:25,169
I told you.

602
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:27,089
What?

603
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:32,676
I told you, you've gotta kill them all!

604
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:53,809
Beast! Beast! You're alive!

605
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:56,369
Oh, good boy. Good Beast.

606
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:58,440
Oh, good boy.

607
01:06:58,610 --> 01:07:00,449
Good boy.

608
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:04,769
Jupiter's going to finish them off.

609
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:07,432
Why are you doing this to us?

610
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:10,636
Why are you doing this? You hear me?

611
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:13,713
Give me back my baby.

612
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:19,329
What the fuck do you want from us?

613
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:21,992
What do you want?!

614
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:26,280
You give me back my little girl,
you hear me?

615
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:43,080
Bobby...

616
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:47,329
...how many bullets do you have left?

617
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:49,832
A clip and a half.

618
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:53,198
What are we doing?

619
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:09,049
Which way, Beast? Which way?

620
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:11,393
Come on. Follow the trail.

621
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:57,969
Come on, big guy-

622
01:08:57,970 --> 01:09:00,837
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.

623
01:09:38,410 --> 01:09:41,117
Where are we?

624
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:52,435
Which way, Beast?

625
01:11:02,410 --> 01:11:04,480
Good boy.

626
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:44,929
Bobby?

627
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:48,449
Bobby, I followed the blood trail.

628
01:11:48,450 --> 01:11:52,369
It leads to a town
or something out here.

629
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:54,201
Bobby?

630
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:55,529
Who knows,
maybe someone heard our calls.

631
01:12:55,530 --> 01:12:57,889
Nobody's gonna hear
the fucking calls, Brenda!

632
01:12:57,890 --> 01:13:00,369
Nobody will see the goddamn smoke
in this desert!

633
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:02,474
We're in the middle of freaking...

634
01:13:02,770 --> 01:13:04,476
Shit!

635
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:19,033
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

636
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:28,409
I'm so scared.

637
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:31,754
Who are these people?

638
01:16:56,690 --> 01:16:59,761
Good dog. Stay.

639
01:18:01,570 --> 01:18:04,129
- Did you push her?
- Yes.

640
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:06,049
- Did you destroy the furniture?
- No.

641
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:09,369
- Did you call her trailer-park trash?
- I did not.

642
01:18:09,370 --> 01:18:13,158
I did treasure my marriage.
I respected her.

643
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:16,289
That's when her abuse started.

644
01:18:16,290 --> 01:18:19,689
- So now you're saying...
- I'm still in love with her.

645
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:23,969
You couldn't "treasure the marriage" if
you wanted to end it two weeks into it.

646
01:18:23,970 --> 01:18:30,529
I wanted to end it because I had a
feeling that things weren't gonna work.

647
01:18:30,530 --> 01:18:32,609
She wasn't working as a team player.

648
01:18:32,610 --> 01:18:35,809
- I tried coaching her...
- What were you doing coaching her?

649
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:38,249
- Is she your child?!
- No, she's not my child.

650
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:41,230
Coaching her in what?

651
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:45,529
She wanted me
to eat dinner, spaghetti...

652
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:49,409
...and I wanted to go out before
it got dark. It was getting dark...

653
01:18:49,410 --> 01:18:53,569
- She hit me with a plate of spaghetti.
- She hit you?

654
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:57,358
When that happened, I grabbed
my coat and I ran out the door.

655
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:54,077
Watch her head, Bobby.

656
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:06,234
Come on.

657
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:44,674
O say, can you see

658
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:49,395
By the dawn's early light

659
01:22:49,650 --> 01:22:53,711
What so proudly we hailed

660
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:58,689
At the twilight's last gleaming?

661
01:22:58,690 --> 01:23:03,479
Whose broad stripes and bright stars

662
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:07,951
Through the perilous fight

663
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:12,676
O'er the ramparts we hatted

664
01:23:13,170 --> 01:23:17,595
Were so gallantly streaming?

665
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:22,157
And the rockets' red glare

666
01:23:22,450 --> 01:23:26,511
The bombs bursting in air

667
01:23:27,010 --> 01:23:30,992
Gave proof through the night

668
01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:35,357
That our flag was still there

669
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:44,729
Where's my daughter?

670
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:46,436
Where is she?

671
01:23:46,850 --> 01:23:49,079
Answer me.

672
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:52,729
I don't know where she is.

673
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:54,959
I never leave...

674
01:23:55,050 --> 01:23:57,598
...this place.

675
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:04,449
Your people asked our families...

676
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:07,078
...to leave their town.

677
01:24:07,570 --> 01:24:11,791
And you destroyed our homes.

678
01:24:12,370 --> 01:24:16,409
We went into the mines.

679
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:20,289
You set off your bombs...

680
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:24,192
...and turned everything to ashes.

681
01:24:25,010 --> 01:24:26,929
You...

682
01:24:26,930 --> 01:24:30,752
...made us what we've become.

683
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:36,329
Boom. Boom. Boom.

684
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:38,355
Where's my baby?

685
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:41,399
What's so funny?

686
01:24:43,770 --> 01:24:46,159
It's breakfast time.

687
01:28:52,130 --> 01:28:55,395
- Please don't kill me.
- "Please don't kill me."

688
01:28:57,610 --> 01:29:01,512
- Please don't kill me.
- "Please don't kill me."

689
01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:35,160
Lizard.

690
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:38,831
Kill the baby.

691
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:38,796
Baby. Baby.

692
01:31:57,770 --> 01:32:00,318
Get out the way, Ruby.

693
01:32:00,930 --> 01:32:02,649
I said, get.

694
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:05,232
Now get.

695
01:32:17,290 --> 01:32:21,112
Mister, would you play with us?

696
01:32:43,290 --> 01:32:46,316
Ruby!

697
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:57,238
Catherine!

698
01:33:01,810 --> 01:33:04,312
- It's okay.
- Fine.

699
01:33:11,810 --> 01:33:14,119
It's okay.

700
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:20,158
It's okay. It's okay.

701
01:33:25,490 --> 01:33:29,597
No. No. No.

702
01:33:30,970 --> 01:33:32,769
- No!
- Come on, Brenda.

703
01:33:32,770 --> 01:33:36,689
- Bobby!
- Stay with me. Stay with me.

704
01:33:36,690 --> 01:33:38,889
- What happened?
- Come on. Come on.

705
01:33:38,890 --> 01:33:41,392
It's gonna be all right.

706
01:33:46,250 --> 01:33:48,089
Careful.

707
01:33:48,090 --> 01:33:49,921
Please. Please.

708
01:33:59,610 --> 01:34:01,600
Shit.

709
01:34:08,210 --> 01:34:10,439
Come on out, you motherfucker.

710
01:34:16,210 --> 01:34:17,649
Look. Look. Look.

711
01:34:17,650 --> 01:34:20,835
It's just a tumbleweed. Come on.

712
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:24,155
Come on, let's go back to the trailer.
Come on.

713
01:34:25,010 --> 01:34:29,071
Come on.

714
01:34:39,410 --> 01:34:41,569
- Oh, my God!
- She's gone.

715
01:34:41,570 --> 01:34:43,929
She's fucking gone!
She's gone! Brenda!

716
01:34:43,930 --> 01:34:47,009
- Go get the trailer ready! Brenda! Go...
- Where's Mom?!

717
01:34:47,010 --> 01:34:50,289
- Go get the trailer ready, okay? Go.
- Where's Mom?!

718
01:34:50,290 --> 01:34:51,889
Where's Mom?!

719
01:34:51,890 --> 01:34:53,809
Listen, go get the trailer ready.

720
01:34:53,810 --> 01:34:56,836
Go in. Do what we talked about.

721
01:36:15,970 --> 01:36:18,950
Go, go, go. Get the window.
Get the window.

722
01:36:20,770 --> 01:36:23,034
It's stuck!

723
01:36:50,010 --> 01:36:53,320
Move! Go, go, go. Get out.

724
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:25,236
Here.

725
01:39:12,050 --> 01:39:14,169
Ruby!

726
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:16,752
Ruby!

727
01:39:23,010 --> 01:39:25,638
Ruby!

728
01:39:27,330 --> 01:39:29,169
Ruby!

729
01:39:29,170 --> 01:39:31,049
Come back here!

730
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:33,678
You little bitch!

731
01:39:46,610 --> 01:39:49,033
Come back!

732
01:39:49,370 --> 01:39:51,201
Give me that baby!

733
01:42:54,650 --> 01:42:57,039
Fucker!

734
01:43:10,490 --> 01:43:14,711
Come on, let's get out of here.

735
01:43:19,170 --> 01:43:22,833
Oh, my God. Look! Bobby!
