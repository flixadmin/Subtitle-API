1
00:00:02,378 --> 00:00:05,178
- There's nowhere to run.
- Wrong about that, Gideon.

2
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:12,555
What is that?

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,719
Whoever it is, they're gonna
land right on top of us.

4
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:18,645
Oh, crap!

5
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:25,735
Nice driving, Gwyn.

6
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:28,780
- God, we're in a forest again?
- What's the damage?

7
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:34,953
We're lucky none of us
got killed by that toilet.

8
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:39,832
Lucky? What are the odds of us getting
hit by a toilet in the first place?

9
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,269
Well, the odds of being injured
by a toilet are one in 10,000.

10
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:43,938
So, you take that number,
you multiply it...

11
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:45,505
I was just being facetious, Gideon.

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,024
I still thought it was interesting.

13
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:49,300
Hey... wasn't there
a person on that toilet?

14
00:00:55,098 --> 00:00:56,307
You...

15
00:00:58,268 --> 00:01:00,687
Wait, wait, wait, which you are you?

16
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,855
He's the him that
blew up our <i>Waverider.</i>

17
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:05,567
Now, give me one good reason
why I shouldn't...

18
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,361
Got unauthorized activity
on the southern perimeter.

19
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:11,048
All right, we gotta lead them away
from the time machine.

20
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:13,324
Operation Blind Man's Bluff is a go.

21
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:15,159
- Thought you'd never ask.
- Marco!

22
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:16,494
- Polo!
- Marco!

23
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:17,579
Polo!

24
00:01:18,538 --> 00:01:20,665
- Marco!
- Polo!

25
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,209
- Marco!
- Polo!

26
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:26,754
- We got to find a door.
- There!

27
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:35,013
- No! No more toilets!
- Shut up and get in!

28
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:55,199
I'm on your side, I swear.
There is a soon-to-be bad Bishop

29
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:57,660
who's actually a replacement
robot clone of me.

30
00:01:57,744 --> 00:01:58,953
But I'm the good Bishop.

31
00:01:59,037 --> 00:02:01,789
- So, which Bishop blew up our <i>Waverider?</i>
- Well, that was me.

32
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:04,667
- And who sent the robots after us?
- Mmm, also me.

33
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:07,003
None of this fits
the definition of good.

34
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:09,339
In my defense,
I thought you kidnapped me.

35
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:11,081
But then, I learned the truth.

36
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:13,635
You're the good guys.

37
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:16,888
Only, it was too late.
Gideon went rogue.

38
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,056
- Her?
- Me?

39
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,724
- What? No.
- She's harmless.

40
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:24,729
Wait, this is astounding.
A living, breathing Gideon?

41
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:27,482
A true deus ex machina among us.

42
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:30,193
She's neither a god nor a machine.

43
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:31,361
She's human.

44
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:33,004
So, who the hell are you talking about?

45
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:38,076
I stole a copy of Gideon's OS
when I was on your ship,

46
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,788
restored her to factory settings,
and then, built my own <i>Waverider.</i>

47
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:43,831
Oh, no. Evil virus Gideon.

48
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:45,416
That seems a bit harsh.

49
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,646
How about misunderstood Gideon who's
just trying to keep the timeline intact?

50
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,047
- By killing us.
- Evil Gideon, it is.

51
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,091
This is all very overwhelming, my boy.

52
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:56,094
Okay, how long is it gonna take
for you to fix your machine?

53
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:58,721
Well, the cosmetic parts on the top
shouldn't be too hard.

54
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:02,517
But rebuilding
the 18 aero-impetus stabilizers...

55
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,644
Well, Ms. Sharpe, I am at a loss.

56
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,398
All right, Ava and I
will scout the area.

57
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:10,692
That Jeep looked mid-century,
let's go off of that.

58
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:13,820
And maybe we landed near
an Aero-impetus Stabilizers "R" Us.

59
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:17,824
Everyone else, lay low.
Evil Gideon is watching, all right?

60
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,951
- Aye, aye, Captain.
- No, not you.

61
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,744
Take him upstairs, please.

62
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,206
- Might I request a room with a shower?
- Only because you smell.

63
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,208
Put him in John's room
and lock the door.

64
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,334
Aye, aye, Captain.

65
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:29,961
Who's John?

66
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:42,473
Hmm.

67
00:03:56,154 --> 00:03:58,865
Seriously?
An airplane manufacturing plant.

68
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,701
I guess we just got lucky.

69
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,498
Well, all we have to do
is find a way in.

70
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:09,459
Excuse me, ma'ams.

71
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:11,437
- Are you here for the recruitment fair?
- Yes.

72
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:13,129
We're just about to get started.

73
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,215
Hey, ladies... don't be shy.

74
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:20,052
- I think we just found it.
- Yeah.

75
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:32,315
<i>As American men go overseas,</i>

76
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:37,320
<i>it's up to our women
to fight for freedom on the home front.</i>

77
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:42,366
<i>All across our fair land,</i>

78
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,579
<i>factories are looking
for women just like you.</i>

79
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:55,463
<i>Democracy wasn't built overnight,
nor were its vessels of freedom.</i>

80
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,675
<i>At McDougle Jemison, we're proud
to do our part for the war effort.</i>

81
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:08,351
So, what do you gals think?

82
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:09,894
You ready to get to work?

83
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,523
We'd be honored.

84
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:35,896
Well, if the orders are to lay low,

85
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,256
I guess now is as good a time
as any to head back in.

86
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,340
Oh!

87
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:43,636
I need to clean, get that tea you like,
tell the ancestors.

88
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:46,889
- They're going to be stoked, right?
- Yeah.

89
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:49,433
When do you think you're gonna move in?

90
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:53,229
Um... I want to
wrap this one up,

91
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:54,632
get the team back to the present,

92
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:56,816
and then, I am totem bound.

93
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:58,276
Can't wait.

94
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:05,283
- See you soon.
- Bye.

95
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:07,869
Phew!

96
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,832
What is that? That smile on your face.

97
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,376
I'm moving into the totem.

98
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,672
You what?
Oh, man, that's amazing. Congrats.

99
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:24,051
Oh, my God, guys, guys.
Nate and Zari are moving in together.

100
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:30,641
Can I have your Steel helmet?

101
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,144
Okay, up, up. There we go.

102
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,271
Guys, I'm still on the team.

103
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,398
I'll just be commuting
from the totem every morning.

104
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,525
And, yes, you can
totally have my helmet.

105
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:43,654
What about my machine?
Or are we all moving into a bracelet?

106
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,489
Actually, we're in luck.

107
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:48,910
Looks like we landed right next to
an airplane manufacturing plant in 1943,

108
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:50,411
height of World War II.

109
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:53,164
- Dang, that's perfect.
- World War what, you say?

110
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,249
Two.

111
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:00,129
You mean to tell me that there is a war
after the war to end all wars?

112
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:02,632
- Well, actually...
- You know, Gwyn,

113
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:04,693
doesn't matter.
How do we get this bird in the air?

114
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:09,680
Good. Oh, yes. Well,
here is my design for the stabilizers.

115
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:11,057
We need 18 of them.

116
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:13,517
Eighteen? Let me see.

117
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:16,896
Well, we got corrugated metal,
two-inch I-beams, copper wire...

118
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,339
If I can just find a welding station,
it won't be a problem.

119
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:20,942
Excellent.

120
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,237
All right, as long as we get
on that factory floor,

121
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,450
everything will be easy as apple pie.

122
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,369
You ladies the new hires?

123
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,080
Good. We need all the help we can get.

124
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:35,790
- That was easy.
- Hmm.

125
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,751
You two gals, hit the assembly line.

126
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,836
You got it.

127
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:46,467
And you,

128
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:48,928
my secretary, just quit on me.
How fast can you type?

129
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:51,097
I can process over
a million words a minute.

130
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:55,768
Sure. My office is down the hall.
Start the coffee.

131
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:57,728
Oh.

132
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:04,110
What about us?

133
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:05,653
Janitorial is that way.

134
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:07,738
Excuse me?

135
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:09,824
No coloreds on the floor.

136
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:15,413
I'm getting really sick of this century.

137
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:16,539
Oh!

138
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:31,762
Hello, again. Name's Abby.

139
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,514
Now we run a tight ship.

140
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,808
We turn around a new Cat Bomber
every 48 hours.

141
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:38,352
But you follow my lead,
you'll do just fine.

142
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:40,438
Sweet.

143
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,026
Factory wasn't built
with women in mind,

144
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:46,152
but I could draw you a map

145
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:47,879
to the port-a-johns outside
if you need one.

146
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,530
Oh, I'm sure we can find it.

147
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:52,324
There are a few men here
who were too old to be drafted.

148
00:08:52,408 --> 00:08:54,577
But it's really us ladies
who run the show.

149
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:57,580
Oh. How empowering.

150
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:01,500
Hey, Abby, if you were a fruit,
you'd be a fine-apple.

151
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:02,918
Very funny, George.

152
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:05,254
- And I spoke too soon.
- Yup.

153
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,549
We're gonna start you
on bolts and washers.

154
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:10,676
Now, don't let a bolt go by
without a washer.

155
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,094
- Got it?
- Got it.

156
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,638
Good. I better get back to it.

157
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:16,682
Hey, thanks for showing us around.

158
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:19,268
Of course.
Us ladies got to stick together.

159
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:24,875
How the hell am I supposed
to build this thing

160
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,109
if we're not even on the factory floor?

161
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:34,492
- First day?
- Unfortunately.

162
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,912
With that attitude,
we can make it your last day.

163
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:40,790
What is the point of us staying?

164
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:43,042
Look, I'm with you. This sucks.

165
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,086
But we might have
just been handed a gift.

166
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,548
You have a sad definition of gift.

167
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:51,383
We can't build the parts
we need here.

168
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:52,593
We need to smuggle them out.

169
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:55,221
We just got handed our Trojan horse.

170
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:59,391
- I hate you.
- I hate you, too.

171
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,611
Good. Shift starts at 8:00,
ends at 8:00.

172
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:14,365
- What about breaks?
- Take that up with the complaint box.

173
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:18,035
- Okay. Where is that?
- Right next to the champagne fountain.

174
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,623
What the hell is this for?

175
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:29,380
I don't know where you're from with that
city attitude and country hairstyle,

176
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,215
but here, we're professionals.

177
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,927
We do the job our nation needs us to do
and we look right while we're doing it.

178
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:47,606
Oh, I missed you.

179
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:48,899
Me too.

180
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,151
Oh!

181
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:53,571
- She's talking to her phone.
- Yeah, I got that.

182
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:57,158
Oh, hey, Nate.
Congrats on the big move.

183
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,994
All the ancestors are super pumped.

184
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:01,120
Aw!

185
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:02,538
Well, most of them.

186
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:04,790
Who's not pumped?

187
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,144
- Uncle Arjomand.
- Uncle Arjomand.

188
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:08,878
Oh, come on, guys.

189
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,130
I haven't met an uncle
I couldn't schmooze.

190
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:14,175
Yeah. See, Uncle Arjomand,
he's like 400 years old.

191
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,051
He's essentially un-schmoozable.

192
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:19,152
If he doesn't like you, he could
have you kicked out of the totem.

193
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:21,015
Is that legal?

194
00:11:21,307 --> 00:11:24,560
I don't know or understand
the rules of the totem. So, yeah.

195
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:28,189
- Okay. So what do I do?
- Show him respect.

196
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,791
How much do you know
about Persian culture?

197
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:30,941
Full disclosure. Eh.

198
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,860
Hello. Legends?

199
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:35,821
I'm parched.
Can someone bring me some water?

200
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,323
Preferably, sparkling.

201
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:40,492
- Is that...
- Long story. Bishop dropped in.

202
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,161
Hold up.

203
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:45,998
This could be the perfect
Ta'arof teachable moment.

204
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,710
- What's Ta'arof?
- Ta'arof is an Iranian custom,

205
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,046
the heart of
Persian etiquette and hospitality.

206
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:53,464
Having a guest in the house

207
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,787
is the perfect opportunity
for you to learn all about it.

208
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,681
Okay.
Regular water will be just fine.

209
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,763
Well, regular ice water
with a pinch of salt for electrolytes.

210
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:04,099
Oh, this guy's going to make this
quite a challenge. Good luck.

211
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:13,692
Hey, do those look like
two-inch I-beams to you?

212
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:15,402
Maybe.

213
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:17,505
I want to snag one and bring it
to Spooner. Can you handle this?

214
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,114
Uh, yeah, sure.

215
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,182
Hey, new gal, I'm going to
the little girls'. Can you cover me?

216
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:28,832
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

217
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:32,878
Wait. What do...
Oh, it's fine.

218
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,133
Can somebody...
Um, I just need a hand.

219
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:39,927
Okay. It's okay.

220
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,054
Oh, no.

221
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,936
Oh, no, that's not good.

222
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:53,524
Oh, no.

223
00:12:58,821 --> 00:12:59,947
Hey!

224
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,074
What's going on over here?

225
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,537
You stealing?
Empty your pockets.

226
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:15,504
Huh.

227
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,299
All right. Back to work.

228
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:26,765
Oh, there you guys are.
I've been looking everywhere for you.

229
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:28,808
Oh.

230
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,121
Look, you guys don't
have to do this, all right?

231
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:33,585
- We'll find another way to...
- Just put the part in the bin.

232
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:35,375
Yeah, you can't do the welding here,

233
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,918
but we can sneak
the parts out on the trash,

234
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,582
- and work back in the manor.
- All right.

235
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:40,487
You say the word.
We'll find another way.

236
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:43,907
Just proud to do our part
for the "get our asses home" effort.

237
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,247
I know what y'all are up to.

238
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:52,541
Sorry, we can explain.

239
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,126
Look, I get it.

240
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,045
None of us want to be stuck sweeping.

241
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:58,422
Meaning?

242
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,846
You see that door marked "Out of order"?

243
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:09,767
When machines get thrown out,
we fix 'em up in there.

244
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,727
We've built a Grade-A workshop,

245
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:15,356
taught ourselves to be as good
as any one of those Rosies.

246
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:18,567
The shop's yours,
just don't be stupid about it.

247
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:20,361
Get your work done.

248
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:21,653
Am I clear?

249
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:23,655
- Yes ma'am.
- Yes ma'am.

250
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:24,782
All right.

251
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,577
Okay, get in there, do your thing.
I will cover your shift.

252
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,661
You sure?

253
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:32,039
Just get me home.

254
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:33,831
Gotcha.

255
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:41,173
When Bishop gets out of the shower,
we'll offer him some tea.

256
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:44,718
Big part of Ta'arof is making your
guests feel welcome in your home,

257
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:46,762
a real <i>mi casa es su casa</i> vibe.

258
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:48,555
Uh, but what if you're the guest?

259
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:49,932
Good question!

260
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:51,785
When your host offers you something,

261
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:54,353
you must deny it at least
three times before accepting it.

262
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:55,646
That's not insulting?

263
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,899
No! It shows respect
and consideration toward your host.

264
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,235
You don't want to be imposing
or seem expectant.

265
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:02,803
Okay, if I'm being totally honest,

266
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,489
it just seems like
you're all lying to each other.

267
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,908
Yes! You're starting to get it.

268
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,743
It is all a performance.

269
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:13,122
Except in this case
you are both the actor and the audience.

270
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:17,668
I know it's supes confusing,
but that's how it's done.

271
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,838
Nate, would you like any tea?

272
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,882
Oh, tea!
It's like you read my mind!

273
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,686
Two sugars,
and don't steep in for too long.

274
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:29,179
Um, I just smuggled those
back from the totem.

275
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,473
That's 600 GSM Egyptian cotton.

276
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,059
Oh, no wonder my hair's still wet.

277
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,603
I usually use something denser. Ooh!

278
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,067
Mmm.

279
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,529
No, I forgot to say
I can't drink caffeine.

280
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,656
It makes me jittery.
Do you have anything herbal?

281
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,575
I can arrange that.

282
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,702
Great! Just bring it up to my room.

283
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,663
Definitely invest in some
800 GSM towels. You won't regret it.

284
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,168
Great job, ladies.

285
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:00,478
See ya in two days for the next one.

286
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,670
Keep up the good work.

287
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:07,426
We have to make a new one of these
every two days?

288
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:10,053
I hope Astra and Spooner
are making progress.

289
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,393
Psst.

290
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,228
I did it.

291
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,356
- Don't we need, like, 18 of these?
- Well, 17 now.

292
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,358
We are never getting out of here.

293
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:26,276
Sir, the First Lady's
office called again.

294
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,070
She's insistent about
seeing the factory in action.

295
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:30,782
Tell them I don't need a babysitter.

296
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,367
Injection molder's down again.

297
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:33,678
But I have the work order right here,

298
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:34,745
it just needs your stamp.

299
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:37,474
I don't know what you girls
keep doing to these machines

300
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:39,058
that I've to keep fixing them
all the time.

301
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,292
You know that costs money.

302
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,503
Of course sir, we're all doing our best.

303
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,240
Just wish it was a little better.

304
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,741
Give the order to Miss Godfree,
I'll get it in the morning.

305
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:52,930
Hey, what does an injection molder do?

306
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,640
Makes custom metal parts.

307
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:58,060
- Like this?
- Hypothetically.

308
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:00,687
So with one stamp on one work order

309
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,332
we could have a machine
making all of our parts

310
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:04,149
and get out of here
in less than 48 hours.

311
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,235
- What about being invisible?
- Oh, come on.

312
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,279
What is the worst that could happen?

313
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:14,910
Warn me if he comes back.

314
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,424
<i>Permuto.</i>

315
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,828
Mr. Staples.
You can't go in there.

316
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,812
I can go into my office
whenever I want!

317
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:45,482
I know my keys are in here!

318
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,071
You.

319
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:52,739
What are you doing in here?

320
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:56,660
As if it isn't bad enough
that I have women working in my factory,

321
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,996
now I have coloreds robbing my office!

322
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:02,416
I told them your type is always trouble!

323
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,876
You're fired!

324
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,266
Okay. What is it?

325
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:22,434
Astra?

326
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,116
I know! I got mad
and did something stupid,

327
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:25,415
now the whole mission is at stake.

328
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:26,749
You don't have to tell me
I screwed up.

329
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,293
I've told myself
a million times already.

330
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:29,318
Okay.

331
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,278
Okay. What did he do to you?

332
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:32,821
Just the usual racist, sexist stuff.

333
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,573
And then he came toward me and poof...

334
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:39,244
You know, it's kind of giving me like
a creepy John Travolta vibe.

335
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:40,621
- Cover him up.
- Yeah.

336
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:44,625
So what was the spell?

337
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,086
It wasn't a spell exactly,
more like a feeling.

338
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:51,256
- And any idea when it's gonna wear off?
- Nope.

339
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:55,677
Actually, you might have
made things easier on us.

340
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,221
- How?
- His job is to run the factory, right?

341
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,890
- Mmm-hmm.
- Well, now, that's our job.

342
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,309
Which means we get to make our parts!

343
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:05,979
And as long as we stay on schedule,
we won't alert Evil Gideon.

344
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:09,399
Okay, well, tomorrow's gonna be
a very long day.

345
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,652
We should get some food, get some sleep.

346
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,737
You two go.
If we're gonna run a factory,

347
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,614
one of us should
probably figure out how.

348
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:18,617
This is my mess
and I'm going to clean it up.

349
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:30,420
Oh, 2040's phone, so retro.

350
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,383
You're playing Pastry Smash?
I love that game!

351
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,317
Here's another important lesson.

352
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,096
When a guest compliments something,

353
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,139
it's customary for the host
to give it to them.

354
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:44,351
It shows equality
and mutual respect between the two.

355
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:45,936
No.

356
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,840
Now you've got me wanting to play!

357
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,861
Sure! Just don't run the battery down.

358
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:55,946
- Thank you.
- Cool.

359
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,531
Oh, my goodness!

360
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,783
I'm starving. What did you guys make?

361
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,327
Why is he down here?

362
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:05,205
I'm learning about Persian culture
so I can win over cranky uncles.

363
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:06,448
Bishop's my teachable moment.

364
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,751
You're lucky I love you two.

365
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,688
I love you.
Here's some complex carbohydrates.

366
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,463
- Oh, thank you.
- Salad!

367
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,382
You eat food?

368
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:16,883
How human are you?

369
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:18,727
Biologically, I am
one hundred percent human.

370
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,303
So, then, how computer are you?

371
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:21,888
Also, one hundred percent.

372
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:25,225
Which is confusing mathematically,
but accurate metaphorically.

373
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:27,853
Remarkable.

374
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:28,937
Remarkable.

375
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,939
You've done it.
Fantastic work, dear girl.

376
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:33,316
- Fantastic!
- Don't sound so surprised.

377
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,027
All right, Master Green.
If you'd be so kind as to locate us

378
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,947
a pair of torchlights,
we shall proceed presently to the woods

379
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,616
- where we shall begin our work.
- Actually, no need.

380
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,826
Astra's got you covered.

381
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,509
Wait until you two see the workspace
that she locked down for you.

382
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,289
Good morning, boss.

383
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,751
Sara told me to tell you
that "the eagle has landed."

384
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,521
Which is secret code for Gary and Gwyn

385
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:54,713
have set up the time machine
in the loading bay.

386
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:58,008
Why do humans have secrets anyway?

387
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,693
Because there are some things
people don't want everyone to know.

388
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,763
And judging by these balance sheets,

389
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,514
Mr. Staples had
about a thousand of them.

390
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,661
If we're going to divert
the injection molder to make our parts

391
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,729
and still deliver a plane in 48 hours,

392
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,560
we need to get this factory
running more efficiently.

393
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,153
Well, I've just calculated
over 50 different options,

394
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:21,218
but perhaps we should ask the ladies?

395
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,119
Good morning ladies!

396
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:29,039
Starting today,
we are putting out a complaint box.

397
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,332
Please don't hold back.

398
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,293
Help us help you. Hmm?

399
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:30,433
Thank you, Gideon.

400
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:31,661
How's it all going down there?

401
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:32,727
Humming along!

402
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:34,312
Job well done, Astra!

403
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:36,606
This place is getting better
by the hour.

404
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,358
Efficiency is so much higher
than before.

405
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,532
We can do better than efficient.

406
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,089
You've gotta be kidding me.

407
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:03,842
What's it say, George?

408
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,887
The factory is integrated.
Effective immediately.

409
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,227
Mr. Staples has gone too far.

410
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,229
I'll say.

411
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:18,564
We quit.

412
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:19,733
Right, ladies?

413
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:28,783
Come on, George.

414
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,559
- Screw 'em.
- That was half the work force.

415
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,444
How are we supposed
to keep production on track?

416
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:47,469
We can't.

417
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,930
And if we can't deliver,
we lose the DOD contract.

418
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,848
No contract, no jobs.

419
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:53,683
You know this ain't your fault?

420
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:55,226
I didn't say it was.

421
00:23:57,729 --> 00:23:58,897
Is Mr. Staples in?

422
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,274
He is... unavailable at the moment.

423
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,276
This is urgent. He needs to fix this.

424
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,960
Wait. Wait!
You really can't go in there!

425
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,031
What are you doing in here?

426
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:09,824
And where is Mr. Staples?

427
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:12,869
- He is indisposed...
- Indisposed?

428
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:14,996
Half his work force just quit.

429
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:23,922
I don't like this.
I'm going to the foreman.

430
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,215
Wait, just wait. Listen.

431
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:28,551
I don't know exactly
what happened to Mr. Staples,

432
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:30,553
but when I found him like this,

433
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:33,014
I realized there was an opportunity.

434
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:35,475
No one questions
a work order with his stamp.

435
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,187
There was a chance to make
this factory better and so I took it.

436
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:41,356
You ordered the integration?

437
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:44,079
I couldn't have them treat us
like second-class citizens, or worse.

438
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:47,112
I just, I didn't think that
all those women would walk out.

439
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,823
I am pushing the same mop you are.

440
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:53,368
Young ones like you think
it's all about now. It's not.

441
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:57,247
We're all just branches on a tree,

442
00:24:57,956 --> 00:25:00,250
there are some below us,
some yet to come.

443
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:05,880
This war gave us a chance
to finally wake this country up,

444
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:07,924
but that doesn't happen overnight.

445
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:10,677
Slow and steady progress,

446
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,138
that's sustainable progress.

447
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:15,849
"You don't stick a knife
in a man's back nine inches

448
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,435
and then pull it out six inches
and call it progress."

449
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,311
It's torture.

450
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,106
What good is change if it doesn't last?

451
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:25,150
Without those women,

452
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:28,778
the plane won't get finished
and the DOD will pull our contract.

453
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:34,367
So your team can't finish the plane?

454
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:39,998
I didn't say that.

455
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:45,128
I mean, maybe we can.

456
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:47,964
Maybe if we worked around the clock.

457
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:51,092
Maybe if someone brought meals, coffee,
some cots for breaks.

458
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:54,721
- Maybe, huh?
- Huh. We can do it.

459
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,058
But what's it matter?

460
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:02,020
Once top brass finds out,
they're gonna fire us anyway.

461
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:07,776
You take care of the plane,
I will make sure you keep your jobs.

462
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:10,194
Deal?

463
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:17,160
Probably the straight dumbest thing
I've ever said yes to.

464
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:20,913
Deal.

465
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,802
Get that ribbon and get to work.

466
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:35,678
<i>She's a part of the assembly line</i>

467
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:38,139
<i>She's making history
Working for victory</i>

468
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:40,683
<i>Rosie the Riveter</i>

469
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,061
<i>Keeps a sharp lookout for sabotage</i>

470
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:45,438
<i>Sitting up there on the fuselage</i>

471
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:48,149
<i>That little frail can do

<i>Rosie the riveter</i>

473
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:16,094

<i>Rosie, Rosie, Rosie the riveter</i>

<i>On the assembly line</i>

476
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,026
Special delivery for a special lady.

477
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:34,153
Thank you.

478
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:35,947
For all the sandwiches.

479
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:37,907
Sorry I got us into this mess.

480
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:39,366
Apology rejected.

481
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:41,558
What you've done here is incredible.

482
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:42,954
Incredibly stupid.

483
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:46,958
I freaked out, petrified a man with
magic that I don't even understand,

484
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,853
then let my anger jeopardize
the livelihoods of all these women.

485
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:58,093
What are you doing?

486
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:00,597
Trying to see the world
from your perspective.

487
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:01,972
Okay.

488
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,096
Because from where I stand,

489
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,769
I see a woman who is not afraid
to speak her mind.

490
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:10,398
Who not only fight for herself
but fights for others.

491
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,859
Me? I'm a lover,

492
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:16,529
my life would be a lot easier
if I was a little more Astra.

493
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:18,323
Who's pushing you around?

494
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:19,407
It's my own fault.

495
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:21,826
I'm teaching Nate
the Persian custom of Ta'arof

496
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,830
by demonstrating how to be
a good host of Bishop.

497
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,413
The guy who blew up our ship?

498
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,580
I can't help it.

499
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:28,041
Ta'arof is a way of life for me,

500
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:30,001
I love making people feel welcome.

501
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,670
But with Bishop, I just feel like
he's taking advantage of me.

502
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:34,047
Mmm, shocking.

503
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:36,406
What do you do with guys like that?

504
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:44,766
- Has he been here the whole time?
- Yeah.

505
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,730
You want to know
what I see from my perspective?

506
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:49,478
A great guy.

507
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,731
And your tradition is part of that.

508
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:54,192
But it's also a way
for you to avoid conflict.

509
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:58,196
Just stand up to him.
What is the worst that could happen?

510
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:01,074
He's already tried to invade Earth
with a scourge of lizard people.

511
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:04,284
Thanks, Astra.

512
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:07,163
You're welcome, Behrad.

513
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:13,086
I should go and check on the floor.

514
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:15,493
Yeah, me too. The dinner rush
is right around the corner.

515
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:26,432
Okay, ladies, home stretch.
Our inspection's this afternoon.

516
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,676
- How are you holding up?
- Well, I can skip arm day...

517
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:31,104
I can't feel my arms. Oh, thank you.

518
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:33,022
Milk? Sugar?

519
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:34,941
Got anything stronger?

520
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,360
I'm asleep on my feet.

521
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,963
We're never gonna finish this in time.

522
00:29:39,654 --> 00:29:42,073
Yeah, it was nice having
Mr. Staples believe in us,

523
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:44,123
but it feels like
we're just letting him down.

524
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:45,326
Hey, come on.

525
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,804
You're here because you deserve to be,

526
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:48,663
not because
Mr. Staples said you could be.

527
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:51,541
Twenty-four hours ago
this was an empty hangar.

528
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:52,625
And now look!

529
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:58,423
When this war is over,
who knows where you're gonna end up.

530
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:03,720
But no matter what happens to you,
you will always have this moment.

531
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:10,601
The moment when you built a plane
with your own hands.

532
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:14,147
And not because some boring white man
said you were allowed to,

533
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:17,442
but because you always knew
that you could.

534
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,030
Now let's finish this airplane!

535
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:38,296
Ooh! Yum! Donuts!

536
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:41,215
Would you mind making some gluten free?

537
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:43,426
Find my inner Astra.

538
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:44,509
No.

539
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,429
Great, just let me know
when they're finished.

540
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:49,557
No, I mean, I'm not making you
a gluten-free donut.

541
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,120
I'm not making you any kind of donut.

542
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,727
These are for the Rosies.

543
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:55,103
Are you mad at me?

544
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:57,482
Yes. I'm mad at you.

545
00:30:58,149 --> 00:31:01,152
I'm trying to be a good host
and you're making it very, very hard!

546
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:03,547
I know you've been through a lot,
but so have all of us.

547
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:04,571
Because of you!

548
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:07,617
And now we're all doing our part here,
and you're doing nothing.

549
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:14,457
I have something to show you
that might make up for my rudeness.

550
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,126
Where is he rushing off to?

551
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,910
He's got something to show me.

552
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:20,713
I hope it's my phone.

553
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:25,343
Oh, wow, it is my phone.

554
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:27,512
I think it's safe to say, "was."

555
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:30,181
It's a navigational interface
for your time machine.

556
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:33,059
I recognized the problem
as soon as we crashed.

557
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:36,354
The machine lacks the ability to compute

558
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:38,439
the nearly infinite
simultaneous variables

559
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:40,483
required to make an accurate jump.

560
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:41,733
So I built this.

561
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,987
This can calculate
the infinite variables of time travel?

562
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:46,197
Oh, no, it can't.

563
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:47,447
But Gideon can.

564
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:50,743
And with this neural communicator,
she can control the machine.

565
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:52,828
Whoa.

566
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:55,331
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
I was working on it.

567
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:57,500
I'm not great at human relationships.

568
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:59,892
Might explain
my fascination with clones.

569
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:02,713
Thank you for calling me out.

570
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:04,382
Friends?

571
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,592
Friends.

572
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:09,887
Out of respect to my phone, no.

573
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:14,367
Colonel Dawson's transport has arrived.

574
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:17,311
Three more hex nuts, and she's done.

575
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:19,772
We're cutting it close.

576
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,650
And done!

577
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:24,777
Ladies, we did it!

578
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:27,655
Whoo-hoo!

579
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:31,117
What the hell is going on here?

580
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:38,915
What day is it?

581
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,753
Why have half my workers gone AWOL?

582
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:44,337
And tell me this,

583
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:47,467
why are there colored women
working the line?

584
00:32:48,176 --> 00:32:49,176
Get out!

585
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:50,343
Get out!

586
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:51,344
Get out, all of you!

587
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,890
This is exactly
what I said would happen.

588
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:56,350
I did my part.
What about you, young one?

589
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:00,021
Here comes my part now.

590
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:05,985
Mrs. First Lady!

591
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,696
Mr. Staples, I'm honored to be here.

592
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:13,910
It's a true privilege to meet you and
the women who are keeping our boys safe.

593
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:17,663
I hope you don't mind,
the people from <i>Time Magazine</i>

594
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,500
wanted to join us
on this momentous occasion.

595
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:22,809
Of course not, Mrs. First Lady.

596
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:26,047
So Colonel, no need to stand
on ceremony on our account,

597
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:29,634
let's examine this magnificent creature.

598
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,385
Right this way, Mrs. Roosevelt.

599
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:36,516
Pleasure to meet you.

600
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:38,100
So nice to see you.

601
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:42,688
I don't see how Eleanor Roosevelt has
anything to do with us keeping our jobs.

602
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:44,607
A good guest can make a good host.

603
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:45,942
Is that a riddle?

604
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:47,026
Just watch.

605
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:49,111
Wonderful.

606
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:52,073
A break table on the work floor.

607
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:54,909
Wise way to keep the workers energized.

608
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:58,955
And we converted the men's bathroom
so the women didn't have to walk as far.

609
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:00,413
We did.

610
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:01,916
- Inspiring.
- But...

611
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,835
But know this plane...

612
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,088
It wasn't built by our regular girls.

613
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,714
This one is no good.

614
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:10,925
And what do you say, Colonel?

615
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:13,219
Never seen a finer plane
come off the line.

616
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:14,303
There you have it.

617
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:17,223
An integrated workforce
and fine American craftsmanship.

618
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:18,975
We'll have this on the cover of <i>Time.</i>

619
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:23,187
This factory will be a showcase
for the world, a model for the industry.

620
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:25,815
Don't change a thing, Mr. Staples.

621
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:27,525
I have my eye on you.

622
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:30,111
So congratulations to you all.

623
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:32,238
Now let's get that picture!

624
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:35,199
You too, Mr. Staples.

625
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:49,005
Aren't we lucky ladies to have such
strong, intelligent men in our lives?

626
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:53,008
Thank you.

627
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:54,884
Thank you.

628
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:00,141
Everyone say Rosie!

629
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:02,310
Rosie!

630
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:13,154
- I'll tell you what.
- What?

631
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:14,864
You made a pretty kick-ass boss.

632
00:35:15,406 --> 00:35:16,407
Okay, I can't tell,

633
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,260
is that your "serious" voice
or "making fun of me" voice?

634
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:20,536
Oh, just take the compliment.

635
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:23,414
- Come on.
- Oh, God.

636
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:28,336
Boys!

637
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:30,379
We've got something for you, Doc.

638
00:35:31,756 --> 00:35:33,007
Is that a Speak & Spell?

639
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:35,259
It's a neural navigational system.

640
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:38,471
You dropped a toilet on my time machine.

641
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:40,097
I don't have to talk to you.

642
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:42,350
But you have a problem.

643
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:45,061
Your machine can travel,
you just can't tell it where.

644
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:46,353
But with this,

645
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,064
Gideon can navigate it.

646
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,067
All she has to do is think
where she wants to go and whoosh.

647
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:55,488
The device can read
all of Gideon's thoughts.

648
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:59,200
That shirt really
brings out Gary's eyes.

649
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:01,202
And those pants accentuate his bum.

650
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:04,330
I think I understand
why humans keep secrets now.

651
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:06,123
That's called shame.

652
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,684
And there's no shame in the game.

653
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,210
Those pants do accentuate his butt.

654
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:14,274
If you'll allow me to install it,
I should have you ready to jump

655
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:15,298
in 30 minutes.

656
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,928
Yes. Yes. Very well then.

657
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:23,140
You be gentle with her now, okay,
because she's very, very delicate.

658
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:30,272
That Bishop guy's an odd duck,
smart though.

659
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:32,525
Definitely Legends material.

660
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:34,443
Yeah. Speaking of odd ducks,

661
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,796
when were you guys gonna mention

662
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,239
that our new roomie
is like a beardo version of John?

663
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:39,865
What? Gwyn?

664
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,283
Sorry, I don't see it.

665
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:43,452
No. I say he's more of a Rip.

666
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:47,872
Psst.

667
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:51,794
Refined sugar and carbs?

668
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,517
- Oh, no. Thank you.
- Just a small piece.

669
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:54,588
- I can't.
- Just take it.

670
00:36:55,673 --> 00:36:56,674
If you insist.

671
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:57,800
Ah!

672
00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:00,845
To moving in!

673
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,938
You know you can't drink
in the totem, right?

674
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:14,567
I could dance all night,
but I'd hate myself in the morning.

675
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,196
Guess we showed them.

676
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:20,865
Yeah, I guess we did.

677
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,534
That man is not gonna
make it easy for us out here.

678
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:25,286
He didn't make it easy for you before.

679
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:28,414
You're right.

680
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:32,084
What I said earlier, about young ones
like you throwing caution to the wind...

681
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:33,335
I know, I know...

682
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:34,879
Don't stop.

683
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:47,850
Keep it your way,

684
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:50,394
it's beautiful.

685
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:01,363
Did you guys hear?

686
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:03,449
Eleanor Roosevelt's going to Congress,

687
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:05,534
she's gonna push to integrate
all the factories.

688
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:07,243
Amazing.

689
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:09,246
Two years before
the original timeline, too.

690
00:38:11,582 --> 00:38:12,833
Wait, what did you just say?

691
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:16,712
I said two years before the original...

692
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:18,255
Oh!

693
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:26,514
She's here.

694
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:29,558
Oh, no. We have to make it jump now!

695
00:38:29,642 --> 00:38:30,768
I can't leave the Legends.

696
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:32,686
We won't. We're gonna jump to them.

697
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,064
I'm scared. I can't do it.

698
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:43,030
Okay, just close your eyes
and listen to my voice.

699
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,700
Pick one spot on the factory floor.

700
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,786
See the walls, the tiles on the floor.

701
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:49,870
Do you have it?

702
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:51,205
I think so...

703
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:02,511
All right, come on.
The time machine's this way.

704
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:06,470
And now it's that way.

705
00:39:06,554 --> 00:39:07,656
They could've parked closer.

706
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,680
Run!

707
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,700
Go, go, go, get down!

708
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:29,243
Come on.

709
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,030
Who the hell are these guys?

710
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:32,997
I counted four muzzle flares.

711
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,999
But if it was me,
I'd put two on the perimeter,

712
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:36,125
so that puts us at six.

713
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,794
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

714
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:41,547
No, no...
I'm not gonna die in a factory.

715
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:44,383
They've got us pinned.

716
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:48,095
Hey, I could turn to steel
and get to the time machine.

717
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:49,471
You and Nate should run.

718
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:51,116
Gwyn's machine works.
You could come back...

719
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,225
I already told you,
I'm not leaving you again.

720
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:03,569
Go! Go! Come on!

721
00:40:06,864 --> 00:40:07,865
Come on!

722
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:14,914
Bishop. Let's go.

723
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:35,267
- Go!
- Where to, Captain?

724
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:36,393
Home!

725
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:49,990
We have two down.

726
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:52,826
Where's the target?

727
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:55,037
Bishop's been eliminated.

728
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:56,537
Legends got away.

729
00:40:57,831 --> 00:40:58,874
Damn it!

730
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:00,834
Get these two to the MedBay ASAP.

731
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:03,438
Those Legends
might've got away this time,

732
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:04,797
but mark my words,

733
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:07,466
those suckers are going to pay for this.
