1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,159
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,243
- Hello.
- What's wrong with you?

3
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:07,297
I let him out of his cage,
and he helped me get out of mine.

4
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,089
You're him. The Riddler.

5
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,166
Hi, Lee.

6
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,547
Butch?

7
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,339
- You're alive.
- Huh?

8
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,845
<i>Oh, Butch. I tried.</i>

9
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,469
Tabby, I'm gonna find a way
to get back to the old me.

10
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,553
I promise.

11
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:24,439
<i>Tell me about your mother, Jerome?</i>

12
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:25,982
- Did she have any enemies?
- No.

13
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,275
And do you have any other family?

14
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,148
The circus is my family.

15
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:34,157
<i>Now, to free the rest of our
cronies and blow this pop stand.</i>

16
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,826
<i>I could have killed Jerome
after he kidnapped me, and I didn't.</i>

17
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:39,700
<i>Any harm he does now,
I share a part of it.</i>

18
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,531
<i>I saw Jerome tonight.</i>

19
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,742
<i>He was looking for the name
of a school, St. Ignatius.</i>

20
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,417
Stay the hell away from that madman.

21
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:46,870
I'll see you at St. Ignatius, Jim.

22
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,351
Sir.

23
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:11,895
Sir?

24
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,563
Can I help you?

25
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,984
My name is Bruce Wayne.
I'm looking for Jerome Valeska.

26
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,401
Has he been here?

27
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,784
I didn't have the pleasure
of meeting Mr. Valeska.

28
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,620
However, I did speak with his friend,

29
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,542
the one with the top hat.

30
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,708
- Jervis Tetch.
- Yes.

31
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,168
That's the fellow.

32
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,458
He was very polite.

33
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,549
What did he want?

34
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,302
The name of a student

35
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:43,510
who graduated St. Ignatius 10 years ago.

36
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,804
Xander Wilde.

37
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:49,015
Fine young boy. Very bright.

38
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,436
Did Tetch tell you
why Jerome was looking for him?

39
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,403
No.

40
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,824
But he did have a message

41
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,658
for you.

42
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,422
Listen to me. You're being hypnotized
by Jervis Tetch.

43
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,631
You don't wanna press that button.

44
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,715
But I have to.

45
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,309
- He's depending on me.
- Bruce!

46
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,012
Step away from him.

47
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,475
Please.

48
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,732
- Hand me the detonator.
- I want to.

49
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,647
But I can't.

50
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,399
Captain Gordon, look.

51
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,897
He's under Jervis' spell.

52
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:39,983
Oh!

53
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,418
Get down!

54
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,705
Hear ye, hear ye!

55
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,000
I'd like to officially
welcome you all to our first ever

56
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,336
Mandatory Brunch Meeting.

57
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,254
Now, I know what you're all thinking.

58
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,543
Why have I gathered
this legion of horribles?

59
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,342
That has a nice ring to it.
Write that down, will ya?

60
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,966
Well, back when I was in Arkham,

61
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:51,684
I came up with a plan
to turn this city into a madhouse.

62
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:55,733
Now I am on the cusp
of making that happen,

63
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,311
but I need help from all of...

64
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,738
Put all questions on ice until the end.

65
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,190
<i>Danke schön.</i>

66
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,150
Mr. Oswald.

67
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,161
Thank you for doing your part
in hosting us today.

68
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,405
Anything for an old friend.

69
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:10,705
Crane.

70
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,124
Where are we at with the...

71
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,702
You know what.

72
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,499
It's coming along dreadfully.

73
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,082
Oh, Pun-worthy. Excellent.

74
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:22,385
Freeze, Ice Man, you're our science guy.

75
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,424
We're gonna need a lab.

76
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,720
A big one.

77
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,674
Easy enough.

78
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:31,136
Mmm. Now, all we need
is Mr. Tetch to return

79
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,061
with some very important information.

80
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,266
Use the tongs, Carl.

81
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,519
You still haven't told us

82
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,321
how you're going to take over
the underworld.

83
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,115
Who says I wanna do that?

84
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,735
I'm an artist.

85
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,696
I just wanna paint the town crazy.

86
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:55,289
Once that happens, I could care less
how you horribles rip the city apart.

87
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,913
I'm in. Let's do this.

88
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,215
Well, not yet.

89
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,221
Nothing can happen until we have
our one last essential ingredient.

90
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,186
The one thing
that'll tie it all together.

91
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,611
Who is Xander Wilde?

92
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,189
I don't know.

93
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,366
Did Jerome say anything
at his uncle's diner?

94
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,494
Anything that could tell us
why he's going after him?

95
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,912
If I knew that, Captain,
I would tell you.

96
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:32,988
Would you?

97
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,457
How can I trust anything you say?

98
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,752
I told you not to come here
and you did anyway.

99
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:38,954
Damn it, you could have been killed.

100
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,004
All right, Captain,
I think you've made your point.

101
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,207
And you?

102
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,007
Did you know he was going after Jerome?

103
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,756
Indeed, I did, yes.

104
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,551
If he gets involved in this case again,

105
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,382
I'll press charges. We clear?

106
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:54,976
Come on, son.

107
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,847
Yo!

108
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,816
I just talked to an administrator.

109
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,394
Xander Wilde
was some kind of child prodigy.

110
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,401
Now he's a hotshot structural
engineer at Meyer and Hayes.

111
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,615
What does Jerome want with an engineer?

112
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,409
Maybe he wants him
to build him something.

113
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,822
Let's go.

114
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,220
I used to be a great whistler.

115
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,881
Mmm-hmm.

116
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,598
Um, yeah, hi.

117
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,055
I'm here to see Xander Wilde. And, no...

118
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,481
I don't have an appointment.

119
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,397
Don't bother going to security.
They're all...

120
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,573
Headless.

121
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,291
All right. If you would all
please look at the rendering,

122
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,590
you'll notice that there are several
interesting engineering problems

123
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,588
that present themselves. Mostly...

124
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,679
Oh, don't get up.

125
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,723
I won't waste too much of your time.

126
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,687
I've got a business proposition.

127
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,766
Tell me what I want to know
and you don't get turned inside out.

128
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,691
Please, don't... Don't hurt anyone.

129
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,397
Where is Xander Wilde?

130
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,274
- He's... He's not here.
- Yeah.

131
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,118
I'm not blind. Maybe you are.

132
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,037
Um, you know? Hmm?

133
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,366
No one does. He's never
set foot in this office.

134
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,621
Okay.

135
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,536
Oh, God!

136
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,753
We've never met.

137
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,879
I've only ever
communicated with him

138
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,676
through a proxy.

139
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,505
- Proxy?
- Yeah.

140
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,682
That slippery little sucker
thinks he can get away from me.

141
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,857
Where can I find this proxy, pray tell?

142
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,902
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

143
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,898
Don't take the elevator!

144
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,571
Jimbo!

145
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,032
Old buddy, old pal,
it's great to see ya!

146
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,750
Drop the gun.

147
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,623
You are such a stick in the mud.

148
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:25,954
Give it up, clown boy!

149
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,209
Hey.

150
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,924
Knock, knock.

151
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,220
You were supposed to say, "Who's there?"

152
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,063
- Thank you, Francis.
- Take down their statements.

153
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,732
Hey, Jim. Same story all around.

154
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,684
No one knows Xander.
No one even met him.

155
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,398
Apparently, he had a proxy

156
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,605
who handled his dealings
with the company.

157
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,737
Hayes was the only one
who knew their identity,

158
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,036
but obviously, he's not talking.

159
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,868
So, we have to figure out
another way to find Xander.

160
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,953
I'm ahead of you. We looked into it.

161
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:07,586
No driver's license. No known
addresses. Guy's a ghost.

162
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,997
Everything that's happened
in the last 24 hours,

163
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,548
the breakout, Tetch,

164
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,626
it's all been about
Jerome finding this guy.

165
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,962
I don't think it has anything to do
with him being an engineer.

166
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,638
- This seems personal.
- Makes sense.

167
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,681
I mean, Jerome went to his uncle
to look for him.

168
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,975
Yeah, so how are they connected?

169
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,095
What's up?

170
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,602
Is that Wayne Plaza?

171
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,276
Take a look
at the initials of the engineer.

172
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,945
- "X.W." Xander Wilde.
- Uh-huh.

173
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,695
Looks like we're gonna have to go
talk to the kid.

174
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,776
He's gonna be thrilled to see you.

175
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,429
What time is it?

176
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,515
Riddle time!

177
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,347
What time is it?

178
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,558
Riddle time!

179
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,187
That's right! It's riddle time

180
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,567
- at the Riddle Factory!
- The Riddle Factory!

181
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,326
Our first contestant is...

182
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,419
Lars.

183
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,872
From the now-defunct biker gang,

184
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,790
The Street Demonz.

185
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,631
It's been a rough go
of it lately, huh, Lars?

186
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,970
I've fallen on hard times.

187
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,224
But I'm damn happy
to be here with you, Riddler.

188
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,093
That's the narrow spirit I love.

189
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:47,804
Now, you know the rules.

190
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,356
I ask a riddle, you answer correctly,
you ask me one.

191
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,603
You win 'em both,

192
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,400
and you're walking out of here
with cold hard cash!

193
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,779
Lila.

194
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,535
Prepare the timer.

195
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:23,974
I am heavy forward, but backward
I am not. What am I?

196
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,603
Okay. I'm heavy forward...

197
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,769
But backward I'm not.

198
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,277
Okay, wait... Wait a minute.

199
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,321
No, no, I know this.

200
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,364
It's...

201
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,329
No, no, I know this. Um...

202
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,908
Wait, wait, wait.

203
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:55,921
It's the hour glass.

204
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:08,635
The answer is, "Ton." T-O-N.

205
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,979
Backwards I am, "Not."

206
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,105
Sorry, Lars.

207
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,399
Spin the wheel!

208
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,900
Spin the wheel!

209
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:24,863
Spin the wheel!

210
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,697
You hear them, Lars.

211
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:32,917
It's time to spin
the wheel of misfortune!

212
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,044
Spin the wheel!

213
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,168
Spin the wheel!

214
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,716
Lila, please.

215
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,460
Spin the wheel!

216
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:49,141
Spin the wheel!

217
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,346
My personal favorite.

218
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,557
Rabid sack of rats.

219
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,351
Yeah!

220
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,607
All right, that's enough. Enough!

221
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,944
Doc Thompkins.

222
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,115
What brings Your Majesty
down to our rabble?

223
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,449
How are you doing, Ed?

224
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,751
Haven't seen you
since we put Oswald on ice.

225
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,005
Well, I'm doing far better
than Sofia Falcone,

226
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,207
from what I understand.

227
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,089
Whatever the hell this is, it's over.

228
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,629
I don't think so.

229
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,381
Ladies and gentlemen,

230
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,975
our queen has just informed me

231
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,804
she wants to shut us down.
How do you feel about that?

232
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,565
You hear that?

233
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,606
That's the sound of democracy.

234
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,283
The people have spoken.

235
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,201
And my name is The Riddler.

236
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,825
Okay.

237
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,460
You wanna be entertained?

238
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,208
Hold this, will you?

239
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,304
- Then I'll beat him.
- Oh!

240
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,094
You can't be serious.

241
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,427
You realize what happens when you lose.

242
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,433
I know. I spin the wheel.

243
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,066
But if I win, you shut this place down.

244
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,860
We have our next contestant!

245
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,641
Got any ice cream in there?

246
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,269
I've always had a soft spot
for Chunky Monkey.

247
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,272
I was wondering when you would come.

248
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,571
Me? That's very flattering.

249
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:12,535
So, tell me, Little Miss Proxy,
where is he?

250
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,453
I'll never tell you.

251
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,324
Hmm,

252
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,752
I don't know.

253
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,792
See...

254
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,167
I can be very persuasive.

255
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,379
See that?

256
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,098
Yeah. I was wondering about that.

257
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,348
You got, like, a big dog or something?

258
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,645
No.

259
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,892
That's how I'm going to transport you.

260
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,181
Hmm?

261
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,988
I've got him.

262
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,470
Butch?

263
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,104
I had heard you were different.

264
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,440
But I will be honest...

265
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:31,605
I like it.

266
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,236
What do you want?

267
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,657
I assume you've heard
about the Arkham breakout.

268
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:44,619
Well, I just came from brunch
with Jerome Valeska,

269
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,835
and let's just say
that he has plans for Gotham.

270
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,675
What kind of plans?

271
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,969
That part wasn't entirely clear.

272
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,139
Seemed to involve a great deal of paint.

273
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,841
No matter.

274
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:04,271
I have seen his kind come and go.
Jerome Valeska will flame out.

275
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,397
And in the rubble,

276
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,900
I will reclaim the underworld.

277
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,197
I could use a good man
like you by my side.

278
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,531
You must be all out of allies
to come looking for me.

279
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,028
Don't be modest.

280
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,705
With your brute strength and my brains,

281
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,033
we will be unstoppable.

282
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,162
I did that job.

283
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,873
I'm my own man now.

284
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,420
Really?

285
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,506
Because from where I am,
you look like a man who has nothing.

286
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,803
You'd be wise to watch
what you say to me.

287
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:40,216
- I'm not the same man you remember.
- And neither am I.

288
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,892
Look at the two of us.

289
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,683
We used to run this town. Together.

290
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,312
We were friends.

291
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,441
Look, you want your old life back,
so do I.

292
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,814
- We are the same.
- Wrong!

293
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,816
You can have your old life back.

294
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,613
I can't. Look at me.

295
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,783
Tabitha will never love me again.

296
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,069
Slaughter Swamp
turned me into a monster!

297
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,450
Now get out of here.

298
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,411
If I ever see you again,

299
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,617
I'll pop your head off like a flower.

300
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,091
Let me get this straight.

301
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,926
You tell us to stay out
of your investigation

302
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,629
and now you want our help?

303
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,464
- Subtle.
- We have reason to believe

304
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,174
your father met with Xander Wilde.

305
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,134
Well, if he did, he certainly
would have made a note of it.

306
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,681
What was the name
of that building again?

307
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,761
Wayne Plaza.

308
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,981
He was a meticulous note taker, Thomas.

309
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,230
He organized everything by project.

310
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,440
Let's see. Wayne Gardens...

311
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,071
Wayne Hospital...

312
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,821
Aha, here we go, Wayne Plaza.

313
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,281
All right.

314
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,960
Why, you're bang on the money
there, Captain.

315
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:53,334
Xander Wilde. Says he went
to meet him to finalize the plans.

316
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:56,383
No address, just the name
of the street, Ainslie Drive.

317
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,927
It's out past Buxton
by the old rock quarry.

318
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,762
This man
must've been very important

319
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,591
if my father went out of his way
to meet him alone.

320
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,802
I'm starting to think he isn't just
some recluse hiding from the world.

321
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,352
He's hiding from Jerome.

322
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,632
How interesting.

323
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,689
Oh! Oh,

324
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,233
you are incorrigible.

325
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,068
And then again,

326
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,020
you always were.

327
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,525
Wait. Or was that me?

328
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,485
Sometimes I get so confused, I...

329
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:06,904
I can't remember.

330
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,082
You didn't have to run away like that.

331
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,584
You see,

332
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,465
<i>I would never hurt you,</i>

333
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,088
<i>Xander.</i>

334
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,178
I love you.

335
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,431
<i>I can't wait to see you.
Did you think about me?</i>

336
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,474
I know that you did.

337
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,026
I'm gonna squeeze you until you pop.

338
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,751
Where the hell is the house?

339
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:17,975
James Gordon.

340
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,147
<i>Here to see Xander Wilde.</i>

341
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,130
So this whole joint's underground?

342
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,546
Mr. Wilde values his privacy.

343
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,001
How long has he lived here?

344
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,546
He finished construction six years ago.

345
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,478
- Echo, 496.
<i>- Welcome, Miss Echo.</i>

346
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,899
He'll see you now.

347
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,236
Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Wilde.

348
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:17,785
I expected you might come, Captain.

349
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,039
My God.

350
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:22,877
There's two of them.

351
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,971
May I put my hands down now, gentlemen?

352
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,350
Please?

353
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,687
Apologies, Mr. Wilde,
you took us by surprise.

354
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,313
It's understandable.
You can call me Jeremiah.

355
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,990
That's name my mother gave me.

356
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,859
You solved her murder,

357
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:53,570
and Captain Gordon, I owe you
a debt of gratitude for that,

358
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:57,078
and for putting Jerome in Arkham,
where he belongs.

359
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,620
He never mentioned you before.

360
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:07,042
No, I suppose you wouldn't know
from the letters my mother sent me,

361
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,173
he never spoke of me after I left.

362
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,088
Left where?

363
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:13,886
The Circus.

364
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,594
They hid me away to protect me from him.

365
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:21,231
See, we are always different,
Jerome and I.

366
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,567
From an early age, I showed
a proficiency for maths and design

367
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,145
and Jerome, mainly the mutilation
of alley cats.

368
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,357
On my 10th birthday,
he held a cake knife to my throat.

369
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,784
A few weeks later,
he lit my bed on fire.

370
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,702
It was like living in a nightmare.

371
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,827
My mother knew, eventually,
one day he would succeed, so...

372
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,709
One night, my uncle came to my room
while Jerome slept

373
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,919
and told me that he was taking me away.

374
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,168
I had no idea where,

375
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:50,002
but I kissed my mother goodbye,

376
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:54,006
told her I love her,
and I never saw her again.

377
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,683
He took you to St. Ignatius.

378
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:03,599
Got a new name, new life, where I was
finally able to live without fear.

379
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,268
But in my heart,

380
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,312
I knew one day Jerome would come for me.

381
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,777
Well, that day is today, pops.

382
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,989
We have reason to believe
Jerome knows where you are.

383
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,661
We need to move you to a safe location

384
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:17,988
until we can apprehend him.

385
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,539
That won't be necessary, gentlemen.

386
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,038
I've spent the bulk of my life
preparing for this eventuality.

387
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,540
I am safest here in my home.

388
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:27,915
Not anymore.
Jerome knows the name of your proxy.

389
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,295
He got it from your boss
just before he executed him.

390
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,961
I heard about Jerome
visiting Alan Hayes.

391
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,762
It's tragic.

392
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,808
But the proxy's name
I gave to Alan was a fake.

393
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,478
You're lying.

394
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,227
I beg your pardon?

395
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:53,281
There's something about this guy
that's fishy.

396
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:59,325
Security cameras outside were turned on,

397
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,285
so why are the monitors in here off?

398
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,788
I don't see why
that is any of your concern.

399
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,834
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm a very busy man.

400
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,253
Yeah, I'm sure that you are.

401
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,082
Please don't touch that.
That's very sensitive equipment.

402
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:32,608
Oh, yeah. I'd say
that's pretty damn sensitive.

403
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:39,491
Ladies and gentlemen, a gauntlet
has been laid at the Riddler's feet.

404
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,785
Our leader, Doc Thompkins,

405
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,826
she thinks that she knows
what's good for you.

406
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,961
She thinks stapling a live barracuda
to someone's face

407
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,880
isn't damn good entertainment.

408
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:55,669
Just get on with the show, Ed.

409
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:57,971
Okay, enough! What time is it?

410
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,093
Riddle time!

411
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:00,390
What time is it?

412
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:01,683
Riddle time!

413
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,010
Lila!

414
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,476
Prepare the timer.

415
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,855
I can be broken

416
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,357
without being held.

417
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:20,068
Given, and then taken away.

418
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,912
Some people use me to deceive,

419
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:26,457
but when delivered,
I am the greatest gift of all.

420
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,954
What am I?

421
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,810
You stumped?

422
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,113
Of course I am. You're the Riddler.

423
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,190
So, you give up?

424
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,029
No.

425
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,445
You're gonna give me the answer.

426
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,283
Really? How's that?

427
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,665
Because deep down, you want to.

428
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:18,426
So, that's your plan.
To appeal to the inner Ed.

429
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:20,970
You played the wrong hand, Doc.

430
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,756
Ed is gone,

431
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:26,093
and I will not be manipulated by you
the way that dope was.

432
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,352
I didn't manipulate him, I helped him.

433
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:31,181
No. No, you lied to him.

434
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,687
You promised to fix him.

435
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,485
And that pathetic dust mite
believed you,

436
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,105
causing me to be locked
inside of his feeble mind.

437
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:44,156
Okay, you have 10 seconds left
to find your answer!

438
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:46,992
So, prepare to lose.

439
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,448
But I know the answer now.

440
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:51,917
You just gave it to me.

441
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,005
What are you talking about?

442
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,710
You're right. I told Ed
I would fix him, and I didn't.

443
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,344
I broke my promise.

444
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,423
And that, Riddler,

445
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,183
is the answer.

446
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:10,012
A promise.

447
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,121
Well played.

448
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,621
We're only halfway through.

449
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,755
And I assure you, you will not stump me.

450
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,297
Boo.

451
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,636
You need to take us to your brother.

452
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,644
I can't do that.

453
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,097
What if he's nuttier than the other one?

454
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,523
I'm nothing like Jerome!

455
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,601
Do you want me to put you
in a cell next to his?

456
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,105
Because that is where this is heading.

457
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,479
And then what, Captain Gordon?

458
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:05,404
You couldn't hold him,
Arkham couldn't, I can.

459
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:08,028
And I will make sure
Jerome never escapes again.

460
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,283
No, no, no. Jerome comes with us.

461
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,657
And if you wanna
make this easier on yourself,

462
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,583
I suggest you stay the hell
out of the way.

463
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,956
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

464
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,620
The loonies are outside.

465
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,842
No, no.

466
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,258
How'd they find me?

467
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,345
Must've followed Jerome.
We need to move. Now.

468
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,764
This is not good.

469
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,273
Is there another way out of here?

470
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,225
Yes, but I'm not leaving Echo.

471
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,527
The loonies will use her against us.

472
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,275
She's devoted her life to me.

473
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,448
We get you out first
and we can come back for her.

474
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:46,942
Deal?

475
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,032
As a child,
I was obsessed with labyrinths,

476
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,325
so I designed my house like one.

477
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,831
- You mean this place is a maze?
- Easy enough to get in.

478
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,784
I'm the only one who knows the way out.

479
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,498
Stay close to me.

480
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,756
The maze is built on a hundred acres.
There are 73 dead ends.

481
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,013
I once invited the top maze designers
in the country to try to solve it.

482
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:16,138
One did. It took him three days.

483
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,517
And how much further?

484
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,690
Not far. We just passed
the final switchback point.

485
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,310
If I knew
this thing was a hundred acres,

486
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,691
I would have stopped
and got a sandwich before we came.

487
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,358
Echo.

488
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:33,492
- Thank God you're okay.
- Hey, hey, hey. She's hypnotized.

489
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,723
Echo. It's me.

490
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,558
It's me. Ow!

491
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,144
Gordon! Help!

492
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:58,934
Gordon!

493
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,107
She's a pistol.

494
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,435
Come on.

495
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,656
Echo, please. Where are you taking me?

496
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:12,110
- I'm taking you to Jerome.
- No.

497
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,412
He'll do horrible things to me. Echo!

498
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:15,705
Stop!

499
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:18,992
Let him go.

500
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,887
Thanks.

501
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,215
- He went that way.
- All right.

502
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:37,685
Jeremiah?

503
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,852
Let's try this way.

504
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,024
Hello, brother.

505
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,452
So, how you been? Oh, you look great.

506
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,835
To think I used to be
the handsome one, right?

507
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:09,925
How'd you find your way
through the maze?

508
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:14,130
Oh, bro, we might not
look the same anymore,

509
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:17,012
but we still think the same.

510
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,810
Plus, you used to draw those
stupid things all the time as a kid.

511
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:22,013
I paid attention.

512
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,102
Hey, Hat Head,

513
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:27,731
take Crane, find Jimbo
and his bearded sidekick. Kill them.

514
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:35,277
I've been waiting for this moment
for 15 years,

515
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:39,990
ever since you ran away in the middle
of the night like a coward.

516
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,699
- You're insane.
- Yeah.

517
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,206
And I tried telling Mom,
but she didn't want to listen to me.

518
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,001
You blame me for everything
that's gone wrong in your life,

519
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,378
but the truth is, Jerome,

520
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,253
you were born bad.

521
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,556
Born bad, huh?

522
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:03,393
So, that's why you made her think
that I tried to kill you, right?

523
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,815
- Yeah, we both...
- What was it again? What was it?

524
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,439
I put a blade to your throat.
No, no, no.

525
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,316
- I tried to light you on fire.
- We both know you wanted to.

526
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,272
Yeah, that was a funny story, wasn't it?

527
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:19,074
Okay, maybe it didn't happen
exactly like that,

528
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:22,244
but I didn't have a choice
and I was right.

529
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,870
Huh?

530
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,544
You killed our mother.

531
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,337
She did deserve it though.

532
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:38,848
After that whore hid you away,
she gave up on me,

533
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,013
poisoned by your stories.

534
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,728
You turned everyone
I ever loved against me.

535
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,555
My own flesh and blood!

536
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,310
I guess it's like what they say,

537
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,363
"We all could go insane
with just one bad day."

538
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:59,027
I guess with you
it's more like one bad spray.

539
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,199
You'll see.

540
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,411
- Listen to what I have to say.
- Oh, hell no!

541
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,622
You are not hypnotizing me again!

542
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,671
That's one way to do it.

543
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,925
Must go! Must go!
Must go! Must go!

544
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,311
What are you gonna do to me, Jerome?

545
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:29,728
Come on. I'm gonna kill you, of course.

546
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,351
But first...

547
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,484
I'm gonna drive you mad.

548
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,443
But don't worry, you won't be alone.

549
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:40,068
All of Gotham will be joining you, too.

550
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:44,037
Must go! Must go!
They're after me and the Scarecrow!

551
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:45,660
These guys just don't give up, huh?

552
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,370
Get any closer, and I splatter him!

553
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,080
I'm gonna splatter broski.

554
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,630
No, you won't. If you wanted him dead
you would've killed him already.

555
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,554
He's right. I'll see you soon.

556
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,629
Mwah.

557
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,694
Okay, Doc.

558
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,034
You've had enough time
to think of a riddle.

559
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,161
I hope you've come up with a good one.

560
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:26,413
I have.

561
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,615
Then ask away.

562
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,089
What three words are said too much,

563
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:48,057
meant by few, but wanted by all?

564
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,682
That's your riddle?

565
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,273
You're kidding, right?

566
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:56,898
What's the answer?

567
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,900
Easy. I love...

568
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:10,082
The answer is, I love...

569
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,868
I love what, Ed?

570
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,249
- That's not my name.
- Then what's the answer?

571
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,329
You tricked me.

572
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,841
You're trying to awaken a love
that isn't there.

573
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,840
If it isn't there, then say the words.

574
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,478
I won't say it.

575
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:38,861
Come on.

576
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,400
Say it.

577
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,108
Time's up.

578
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:22,442
Thank you.

579
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,110
What did I say?

580
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,240
I can help you get Tabitha back!

581
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,539
I know how to reverse your condition.

582
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,165
Talk.

583
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,497
This barrel is from Slaughter Swamp.

584
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,965
It turned you into what you are.

585
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,092
Talk.

586
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:47,138
Professor Hugo Strange is the one man
who can cure you.

587
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:50,679
Join me, and we will find him.

588
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,061
I thought I was going to be
stuck like this forever.

589
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,195
You don't have to be, friend.

590
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,786
Okay. I'll join you.

591
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,542
But you'd better deliver.

592
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,914
And I'm not your friend.

593
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,010
I can live with those terms.

594
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,824
Why did you open your club
in The Narrows?

595
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,287
You could've set up shop
anywhere in Gotham.

596
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,210
You wanted my attention.

597
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,967
I came back here
because the people love me.

598
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,090
People didn't come here
because they love you, Ed,

599
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,546
they came for the money.

600
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:15,600
But I can give them what they want.
I just need your help.

601
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,304
Why would I help you?

602
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:23,150
Because I know what you really want.

603
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:26,938
You love me.

604
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,365
You've loved me all along.

605
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,237
You're wrong.

606
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,239
That was Ed.

607
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,034
Okay.

608
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:42,044
So, do it.

609
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,380
Kill me.

610
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:59,891
What's your record for how many banks
you've robbed in one day?

611
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,940
Three. Why?

612
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:05,980
I think you can do better.

613
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,775
You're playing a dangerous game, Lee.

614
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:10,439
I know.

615
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,809
It's all right. Come on.

616
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,477
- Captain.
- It's okay.

617
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,818
This is Jeremiah Valeska,
Jerome's twin brother.

618
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,525
We need to put him
into protective custody.

619
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,781
Okay. Follow me.

620
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,661
Thank you.

621
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:06,749
Captain Gordon, I wouldn't be alive
if it weren't for you.

622
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,547
Hell of a day.

623
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,178
What are you thinking?

624
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:23,054
Jerome told his brother
his plan was to turn Gotham mad.

625
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,894
How the hell
is he going to do that, Harvey?

626
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:29,102
I don't know. I thought it already was.

627
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,249
Damn.

628
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,297
Doesn't even make me feel better at all.

629
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:55,423
Jerome.

630
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:59,048
The test subject has arrived.

631
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:02,593
Hmm.

632
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,849
A little large for a test subject,
don't you think?

633
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,182
He is not your test subject.
This is Grundy.

634
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:10,901
He will make a welcome addition
to the team.

635
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:13,354
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

636
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,441
I like him. He's scary.

637
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,948
Good thinking, Mr. Oswald.
Nice to meet you, big fellow.

638
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,071
Ow!

639
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,035
Ah!

640
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,325
- Test subject?
- Here to test your plan,

641
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,122
an unwilling businessman.

642
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:31,251
No, no, no! Please, please.

643
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,215
Please don't hurt me.

644
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:36,885
Oh, this won't hurt a bit.

645
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:16,049
Oh, we're gonna need a lot more of this!
