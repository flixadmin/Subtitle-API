1
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
You got it!

2
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,360
Feel that power, lady!

3
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,970
Think about those bikini vibes.

4
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,550
You want to look like a giant jellyfish on
the beach?

5
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,650
Come on!

6
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,680
Hang in there, ladies.

7
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,780
You've got it!

8
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,220
You've got it!

9
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,930
All right, I hope I see you next week for
Sparkle Your Life.

10
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,506
We're going to work on the lateral abs.

11
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,550
You know the most difficult part to
sculpt.

12
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,170
But in the meantime, take care of
yourself.

13
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,690
Great job, ladies!

14
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,090
You've got it!

15
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,900
Happy birthday!

16
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,940
Oh, thank you!

17
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,500
Happy birthday!

18
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
Oh, thank you!

19
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,020
Happy birthday!

20
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,180
Thank you!

21
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,590
I don't care about every fucking young
girl in this fucking town!

22
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,010
In the next few weeks!

23
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,050
Look, I'll make it simple.

24
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,250
We need her young.

25
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,290
We need her hot.

26
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,010
We need her now.

27
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,390
Hell, the old bitch has been able to stick
around for this long.

28
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,530
That's the fucking mystery to me.

29
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:49,010
Oh, Oscar winner, my ass.

30
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,490
When was that?

31
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,330
Back in the 30s?

32
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,490
What?

33
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,410
For King Kong?

34
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:01,390
No, I don't give a fuck what we promised
her.

35
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,770
This is network TV, not a fucking charity.

36
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,050
Find me somebody new!

37
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,190
Now!

38
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:16,430
Hey, did you know that a woman's fertility
starts to decrease by the age of 25?

39
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,330
How old is Jennifer?

40
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,470
Are you ready to get busy?

41
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,740
It's like when you see someone fart on
screen.

42
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,940
People just love that.

43
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,680
I mean, that's just the way it is.

44
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,880
For you or me, people are just people.

45
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,900
And I have to give people what they want.

46
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,820
That's what keeps the shareholders happy.

47
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,680
And people always ask for something new.

48
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
Renewal?

49
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
It's inevitable.

50
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,830
At 50?

51
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,900
Well... it stops.

52
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,300
What stops?

53
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
What?

54
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,660
What stops?

55
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,680
Um... You know, the um...

56
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:51,380
the um... the um... the um...

57
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Oh, George!

58
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,120
Oh!

59
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:55,960
Oh!

60
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,300
I'm sorry, I gotta run.

61
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
Harvey!

62
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,320
George!

63
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,540
Those ratings are insane!

64
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,940
You're a genius!

65
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,340
Oh, what a mess!

66
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,460
You're a genius!

67
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
Well,

68
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:03,530
it's your lucky day, Ms. Sparkle,
because we have X-rayed you from head to

69
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:05,650
toe and you don't have so much as a crap
molar.

70
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,210
So, you are good to go.

71
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,380
Uh, vaccination, okay.

72
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,470
Not currently on our medication.

73
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,710
By the way, I just want to say my wife is
a huge fan.

74
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,730
Um... blood type... Oh,
hey, it's your birthday.

75
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,470
Happy birthday.

76
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,490
Oh,

77
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,240
uh, that's an emergency, I'm sorry.

78
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:43,521
Here, I have to have a... Bye.

79
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,010
One moment.

80
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,530
There's just one last exam to perform.

81
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,720
I thought he said I was good to go.

82
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,420
Is there a problem?

83
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,780
No, it's perfect.

84
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,380
You're a good candidate.

85
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,040
I mean, you're good to go.

86
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,670
I wish you the best.

87
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,620
Lizzie?

88
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,320
Lizzie Sparkle?

89
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,620
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.

90
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,020
Fred.

91
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,300
Fred from 10th-grade homeroom.

92
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Oh, Fred.

93
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,580
Of course.

94
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,180
You haven't changed a bit.

95
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,580
You're still the most beautiful girl in
the whole wide world.

96
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,586
You know, I followed your career.

97
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,610
What a success.

98
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,220
I mean, wow, wow, wow.

99
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Wow.

100
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,680
Hey, why don't we go out maybe for a drink
sometime now that we're, you know,

101
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,120
reconnected?

102
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,600
Um...

103
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,320
Oh, of course, I'm stupid.

104
00:12:50,585 --> 00:12:51,240
You're super busy.

105
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,820
But you know what?

106
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,320
Why don't you give me your card?

107
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,660
I mean, you never know.

108
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,060
Um, here, what do
I... Oh, this will do.

109
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,776
Don't look at my cholesterol levels.

110
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
They're a disaster.

111
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh, God.

112
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,280
There.

113
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,360
Now you've got it.

114
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:11,470
Have you ever dreamt of a better version
of yourself?

115
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,450
Younger.

116
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,670
More beautiful.

117
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,330
More perfect.

118
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:26,371
One single injection unlocks
your DNA, starting a new cellular

119
00:14:26,372 --> 00:14:29,850
division that will release
another version of yourself.

120
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,951
This is... the substance.

121
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,470
You are the matrix.

122
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,790
Everything comes from you.

123
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,470
And everything is you.

124
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,150
This is simply a better version of
yourself.

125
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,050
You just have to share.

126
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,090
One week for one.

127
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:51,210
And one week for the other.

128
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,330
A perfect balance of seven days each.

129
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,810
The one and only thing not to forget.

130
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,570
You are one.

131
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,910
You can't escape from yourself.

132
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,210
Yes?

133
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:26,290
Yes.

134
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,070
Hello.

135
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,091
I'd like... to order.

136
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,150
Address?

137
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,150
1057 Beverly Canyon.

138
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,460
Write this down.

139
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,490
35 North Byron Alley.

140
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,470
35 North...

141
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,580
You are the matrix.

142
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,120
Everything comes from you.

143
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,840
And everything is you.

144
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,960
This is simply... a
better version of yourself.

145
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,220
Hello.

146
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,820
Hello.

147
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,760
Hi.

148
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,240
We'll let you know by next week.

149
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,440
Thank you so much.

150
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,900
I'm just dying to get the part.

151
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Great dancer.

152
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,180
Too bad her boobs aren't in the middle of
her face instead of that nose.

153
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,660
Next!

154
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:36,230
Looks like everything sure is in the right
place this time.

155
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,290
Please say your name, age, measurements.

156
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,420
Sue.

157
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,880
I'm Sue.

158
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,140
Sue.

159
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:04,740
Sue.

160
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:05,700
Sue.

161
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:06,600
Sue.

162
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:07,500
Sue.

163
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:08,420
Sue.

164
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,520
Sue.

165
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,200
Sue.

166
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,740
Sue.

167
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,080
Sue.

168
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:12,940
Sue.

169
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:13,560
Sue.

170
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:13,960
Sue.

171
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:14,640
Sue.

172
00:38:14,641 --> 00:38:14,880
Sue.

173
00:38:14,881 --> 00:38:16,200
Where is she?

174
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,440
Where is she!?

175
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,760
What a gorgeous little angel!

176
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,170
You're hired.

177
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:52,490
We want a show that's just like you.

178
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,110
Beautiful and happy.

179
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,010
People want to be happy.

180
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,810
We air in two weeks, so let's get to work.

181
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,870
I'm gonna let you organize the rest with
my assistant, uh...

182
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:05,090
Um...

183
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:06,010
Um... Um...

184
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:07,811
Um... Isabella?

185
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,670
Isa, isa, isa.

186
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:11,950
Who has time to say that?

187
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:13,950
We're gonna make you Cindy.

188
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:15,470
It's shorter.

189
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,550
It's better.

190
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:20,250
So, I'm gonna let you organize everything
else with Cindy.

191
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:27,670
Oh, um... Before you go, I just have
to mention a small scheduling issue.

192
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:34,090
I have to be out of town every other
week...

193
00:39:34,091 --> 00:39:38,290
to take care of my mother, who's very
sick.

194
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:53,620
I want you for this show, and we will work
around any mother, brother, fucking sick

195
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:56,260
puppy that you need to take care of.

196
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,900
Gorgeous.

197
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,800
With a pure heart, people are gonna love
that.

198
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,960
So you jump out.

199
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,960
Touch her out.

200
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,140
Contract.

201
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,810
And five, six, seven, eight.

202
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:17,850
Elbows.

203
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,930
Where have you been?

204
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:58,170
We've all been wanting to have a drink
with you for your departure.

205
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:07,510
Anyway, we all chipped in, and we got you
just a little something to keep you busy.

206
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:09,870
It's French.

207
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:10,570
My wife.

208
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:11,930
She swears by it.

209
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,140
Oh, I love my wife.

210
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:15,090
Oops.

211
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:16,490
I gotta run.

212
00:45:16,565 --> 00:45:20,510
But it's always great to see you.

213
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,340
Which is the most valuable seafood to
start?

214
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,760
Expensing stock options.

215
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,180
Most of the nation's...

216
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,140
Bob and Judy, are you ready?

217
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,576
Know what you'll be toting around for the
rest of your days?

218
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:11,920
Regret.

219
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,620
Of Seville, kids on the phone.

220
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,530
The antelope and the deer moving about.

221
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:52,210
A hunt through the Texas...

222
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:47,410
Sorry.

223
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,011
I thought that Ms.
Sparkle... She moved out.

224
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,250
I'm the new tenant.

225
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,030
Sue.

226
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:57,330
Oliver.

227
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:58,450
Oliver.

228
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,330
Oliver.

229
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:02,510
You wanted to complain about something?

230
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:04,650
Oliver?

231
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:06,250
What?

232
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:07,690
No?

233
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:09,690
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no,

234
00:50:09,765 --> 00:50:12,357
I think it's, like, awesome
when there's stuff

235
00:50:12,417 --> 00:50:14,770
going on in the building,
you know what I mean?

236
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:26,430
I'm actually quite handy if you ever need
me to be of aid in any way.

237
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:31,250
I got a sack of tools and I got a big
hammer.

238
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,500
You know what I mean.

239
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:41,750
Anyways, I live right here, so you know
where to find me.

240
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:43,210
Anytime.

241
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:45,050
Day or night.

242
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:46,890
Later.

243
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,800
Hi, everybody.

244
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,600
I'm Sue.

245
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,240
And it's time to pump it up.

246
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,500
Are you ready?

247
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,680
Let's go.

248
00:54:18,091 --> 00:54:20,250
Thank you so much, everybody.

249
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:22,350
I'll see you next week.

250
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,930
And in the meantime, take care of
yourself.

251
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,260
Wait, Sue.

252
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:06,430
Just wait for me.

253
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:13,670
Don't eat too fast.

254
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,340
I'm coming.

255
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,630
Are you alright?

256
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:33,390
Yes, I'll be right back.

257
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:46,950
No!

258
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:58,390
What did you do?

259
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:01,420
You seem even more beautiful than before.

260
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:41,220
No.

261
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:20,550
Yes?

262
01:02:36,835 --> 01:02:37,835
Yes, hi.

263
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:40,270
This is Elizabeth Sparkle.

264
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:47,730
I'm 503.

265
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:49,620
Yes.

266
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:52,160
Yes, hi.

267
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:57,080
There's been a slight misuse of the
substance.

268
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:02,600
A few extra hours were accidentally used,

269
01:03:06,935 --> 01:03:07,935
causing an alteration.

270
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:11,740
So I'm just looking for the procedure to
reverse it.

271
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:15,800
What has been used on one side is lost on
the other side.

272
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:17,320
There's no going back.

273
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:24,540
No.

274
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,220
I don't know what she was thinking.

275
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,040
And obviously, she was drunk.

276
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:32,660
Remember, there is no she and you.

277
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,100
You are one.

278
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,880
Respect the balance, and you won't have
any more inconveniences.

279
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:47,340
You got to move!

280
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:17,380
Sue!

281
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:19,340
Sue!

282
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:21,560
I just saw you on TV.

283
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,760
Holy moly!

284
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,200
Makes me want to join your class.

285
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:29,660
Hey, you don't get private lessons,
do you?

286
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:34,300
Hey, um...

287
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:36,320
What about a drink at, um...

288
01:05:36,445 --> 01:05:37,460
My place tonight.

289
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,440
Come on, don't be shy.

290
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:43,920
I see you standing behind the door there,
gorgeous.

291
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
All right.

292
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,480
Take your time.

293
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:51,070
But it's a date.

294
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,075
What can I get you?

295
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,560
Um, mocha latte.

296
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:41,520
It's long, isn't it?

297
01:07:43,675 --> 01:07:44,675
Excuse me?

298
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:50,950
Seven days.

299
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:21,840
Did you follow me here?

300
01:08:23,475 --> 01:08:27,600
I was just curious to find out how things
were going for you.

301
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:33,080
Each time you feel a little more...
lonely.

302
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:35,320
Don't you think?

303
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:38,641
I don't know what you're talking about.

304
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:41,340
I'm fine.

305
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:44,140
Everything's fine.

306
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:52,280
It gets harder each time to remember that
you still deserve to exist.

307
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:59,880
That this part of yourself is still worth
something.

308
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:04,340
That you still matter.

309
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,760
Has she started yet?

310
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:15,240
Eating away at you?

311
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:17,860
Fuck!

312
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:34,780
Watch out!

313
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:44,490
What?

314
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:31,160
You're still the most beautiful girl in
the whole wide world.

315
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:42,230
Hello?

316
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:43,610
Hi, Fred.

317
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:45,250
It's Lizzie.

318
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:49,050
Hello?

319
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:51,610
Sorry, I'm in shock.

320
01:10:53,530 --> 01:10:55,270
Wow, wow, wow.

321
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:58,410
I thought I'd never hear from you again
after...

322
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:00,050
Oh gosh, no, no, not at all.

323
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:03,350
I've just been really busy lately.

324
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:07,930
So listen, I was thinking that...

325
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:12,410
maybe we could get together and grab a
drink?

326
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:19,210
Are you still there?

327
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:22,290
Sorry, I'm in shock again.

328
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:27,950
I could book Luigi's at eight?

329
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:30,290
Eight at Luigi's?

330
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:30,890
It is.

331
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:34,530
I will see you tonight.

332
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:36,490
Bye.

333
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,290
Okay, bye.

334
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:32,840
And we're back!

335
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:47,740
Okay, here we go everyone, clear the set
please.

336
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,380
First positions, thank you.

337
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:50,680
Roll cameras.

338
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,600
And in three, two, one.

339
01:16:57,660 --> 01:17:00,380
Squat, squat, squat.

340
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Circle bells,

341
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:10,930
contract, contract, contract.

342
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:12,650
Head between your legs.

343
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:19,750
Cut.

344
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:30,230
Um, I'm sorry, I thought I...
thought I... I just got distracted.

345
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:33,470
Not a problem, let's get right back to it.

346
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:34,950
Back to one please.

347
01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:39,430
Sorry, it's the control room now.

348
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:42,111
The director said he saw something bizarre
on the monitor.

349
01:17:42,330 --> 01:17:43,690
Bring up the replay on camera two.

350
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:44,990
Camera two.

351
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Forward.

352
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:04,500
Can I have my dressing gown?

353
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:05,740
Sorry, it's in your dressing gown.

354
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:06,760
Well then go and get it.

355
01:18:07,835 --> 01:18:09,276
Let's just take this frame by frame.

356
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:25,020
I need five minutes.

357
01:20:23,530 --> 01:20:24,010
Yes.

358
01:20:24,170 --> 01:20:25,710
This balance is not working.

359
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:30,070
I barely have any time
to enjoy myself while she

360
01:20:30,071 --> 01:20:33,031
wastes seven days stuffing
her face in front of the TV.

361
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:35,170
Remember there is no she and you.

362
01:20:35,171 --> 01:20:36,171
You are.

363
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:46,000
What's happening?

364
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,120
Where is everybody?

365
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:48,460
The taping has been cancelled.

366
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:50,220
What?

367
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:50,680
Why?

368
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:51,840
Sue.

369
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:54,391
Harvey wants to see you in his office
immediately.

370
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,360
Okay.

371
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:57,900
I'll go change it.

372
01:20:57,901 --> 01:20:59,000
No, he said now.

373
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:18,130
I'll get right to the point.

374
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,390
We can't keep you on the morning show.

375
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:24,010
But why?

376
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:25,140
I just started.

377
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:27,890
Ratings are through the roof.

378
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:30,810
We started at forty-two.

379
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:33,050
But now we're up too late.

380
01:21:34,170 --> 01:21:35,170
Two hundred and sixteen.

381
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:37,210
It's phenomenal!

382
01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:40,210
People love you.

383
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:42,070
They adore you.

384
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:45,250
They want more and more and more of you.

385
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:52,990
That is why we have decided that we want
you to host the New Year's Eve show.

386
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:56,950
You mean the... The
network's biggest show.

387
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:59,230
Fifty million viewers live.

388
01:21:59,630 --> 01:22:01,770
You can't go higher than that.

389
01:22:04,150 --> 01:22:05,490
That's gonna be intense.

390
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:07,670
We only have a few months to pull it off.

391
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:10,130
So, are you in?

392
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:25,231
If you don't open the door when opportunity
knocks, you won't get another chance.

393
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:28,170
You of all people know this.

394
01:22:40,650 --> 01:22:43,310
Just one more day and then I have a whole
week off.

395
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:44,470
We can switch.

396
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:03,660
We're doing the cover of Vogue.

397
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,440
Just one more day, okay?

398
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:41,930
No!

399
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:15,890
Yes.

400
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:18,030
She didn't respect the balance.

401
01:24:18,710 --> 01:24:21,330
She's stealing more and more time from me.

402
01:24:22,210 --> 01:24:24,930
Completely, without consideration of the
consequences.

403
01:24:25,370 --> 01:24:26,770
She's a selfish bitch!

404
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:28,170
Would you like to stop?

405
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:32,110
Stop?

406
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:33,150
You are the Matrix.

407
01:24:33,950 --> 01:24:36,393
If you are not satisfied,
you can put an end to the

408
01:24:36,394 --> 01:24:39,770
experience and go back to
being just you on your own.

409
01:24:40,430 --> 01:24:41,490
Would you like to stop?

410
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:46,770
Will it go back to the way it was before?

411
01:24:47,130 --> 01:24:51,770
What has been transferred won't come back,
but you can stop the experience as of now.

412
01:24:52,110 --> 01:24:53,110
Would you like to stop?

413
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:56,250
To go back to being just you on your own?

414
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:03,440
No, no.

415
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:04,980
I can't stop.

416
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:08,640
She just...

417
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:12,100
I...

418
01:25:16,285 --> 01:25:18,450
The balance just needs to be respected.

419
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:19,830
So respect it.

420
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:27,190
Just stop it, stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it.

421
01:26:47,790 --> 01:26:48,790
Stop.

422
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:55,970
Just a little something to keep you busy.

423
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:39,120
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, she is here.

424
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,760
The superstar of the moment, Sue.

425
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:43,600
Are you ready?

426
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:44,920
Let's welcome her.

427
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:46,160
Sue!

428
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:52,740
You popped up out of nowhere on our
screens like a tornado.

429
01:27:52,741 --> 01:27:56,600
I don't think anybody was really prepared
for this whirlwind.

430
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:07,240
It all started with the morning show.

431
01:28:07,770 --> 01:28:12,100
And rumor has it that you are up for Tom
Grant's next movie.

432
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:15,960
Wait just a moment.

433
01:28:16,780 --> 01:28:20,520
I'm being told that you are going to host
the New Year's Eve show.

434
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:21,640
Can you confirm this?

435
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:23,340
Yes, that's right.

436
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:24,920
Yes, that's right.

437
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,810
Oh my God, that is huge news.

438
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:35,020
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

439
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:35,940
Where are you from?

440
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:37,260
How did you get discovered?

441
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:40,760
I want, we want to know everything.

442
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:48,040
Well, I mean, there's really not very much
to tell.

443
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:53,480
I'm just a girl from a very small town in
Indiana.

444
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:55,500
I'm sure that you've never heard of it.

445
01:28:55,501 --> 01:28:57,760
In fact, it's not even a town.

446
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:00,220
I'm not sure you could really even call it
a village.

447
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:03,140
It's a farm, perhaps?

448
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:15,801
But ever since I can remember, it has
always been my dream to be on screen.

449
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:17,780
This is my dream.

450
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:20,280
As a child, I used to put on shows for my
family.

451
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:21,900
Oh, your family.

452
01:29:22,150 --> 01:29:23,700
How sweet.

453
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:33,300
So, everyone is aware that you replaced
Elizabeth Sparkle.

454
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:37,504
And no doubt about
it, you stepped in, you

455
01:29:37,505 --> 01:29:41,380
turned up the volume,
and you rocked their world.

456
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:43,140
Were you a fan of her show?

457
01:29:49,990 --> 01:29:58,641
Um, well, well, I can't, uh, I can't really
say that I actually watched her show.

458
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:02,380
You do know that we're not exactly from
the same generation.

459
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:06,600
And you have to admit, it was a bit old
-fashioned.

460
01:30:09,650 --> 01:30:11,080
Jurassic Fitness, really.

461
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:14,580
Jurassic Fitness, it needed a change.

462
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:18,580
I'll fucking show you.

463
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,520
You wanna see some Jurassic Fitness?

464
01:30:38,970 --> 01:30:41,580
But my mother was a huge fan of hers.

465
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:50,080
So, every morning, rain or shine,
Sparkle Your Life was on TV.

466
01:30:50,081 --> 01:30:52,000
So, in a way, I grew up with her.

467
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,020
Whether I liked it or not.

468
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:58,160
I guess that's why you can say we have
some sort of connection.

469
01:30:58,520 --> 01:30:59,800
Some sort of connection.

470
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:03,040
You wouldn't exist without me.

471
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:18,760
It is time, ladies and gentlemen,
for our final question.

472
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:24,180
The question that we ask each and every
one of our guests.

473
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:24,660
Okay.

474
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:30,260
Would you share one of your little beauty
secrets with us?

475
01:31:31,950 --> 01:31:36,200
Just one little trick of yours that helps
you look so incredibly stunning.

476
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:37,000
I mean, look at you.

477
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:38,000
I don't know.

478
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:39,340
Say it!

479
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:40,940
Say it!

480
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Let me think.

481
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:44,140
Say it!

482
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:46,820
Tell them who your little beauty secret
is.

483
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:49,440
I guess... Why don't you
just show them right here?

484
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:51,100
Here's your little beauty secret.

485
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:53,140
I guess I just try to be myself.

486
01:31:53,141 --> 01:31:56,580
To be sincere and grateful for all that I
have.

487
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:59,400
And to always remember to leave with my
heart.

488
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:01,660
America, sweetheart.

489
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:07,140
I just...

490
01:32:14,270 --> 01:32:16,220
I try to be myself.

491
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:18,820
Stop it.

492
01:32:20,195 --> 01:32:21,195
Stop it.

493
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:22,820
You're taking it from me.

494
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:24,880
That's your little secret.

495
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:27,100
Stop it!

496
01:32:27,101 --> 01:32:29,760
Stop it!

497
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:32,340
Stop it!

498
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:45,920
You have to control yourself!

499
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:07,340
I can't go back inside her.

500
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:10,880
Ugh!

501
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:16,860
Gross!

502
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:18,020
Old!

503
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:19,120
Fat!

504
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,710
Can we move to bed?

505
01:34:43,650 --> 01:34:44,650
Yes.

506
01:34:45,350 --> 01:34:46,350
I'll be right there.

507
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:53,790
Hi, this is an emergency.

508
01:35:53,791 --> 01:35:56,272
There's, uh... There's
no more stabilizer fluid.

509
01:35:58,730 --> 01:35:59,730
Hello?

510
01:36:01,190 --> 01:36:02,610
It's fucking 503!

511
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:04,130
Yes.

512
01:36:05,070 --> 01:36:06,326
I'm telling you, this is urgent.

513
01:36:06,350 --> 01:36:07,670
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

514
01:36:07,890 --> 01:36:09,330
It means you've reached the end.

515
01:36:12,090 --> 01:36:13,130
What do you mean, the end?

516
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:14,490
You've drained it all out.

517
01:36:15,250 --> 01:36:17,750
If you want more, you must let the fluid
regenerate.

518
01:36:18,870 --> 01:36:20,090
Tell me how to do it!

519
01:36:20,110 --> 01:36:22,390
I need to stabilize myself right now!

520
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:24,190
You simply have to switch.

521
01:36:26,850 --> 01:36:28,270
Uh, excuse me?

522
01:36:28,550 --> 01:36:31,124
The switch reboots the
fluid secretion process,

523
01:36:31,125 --> 01:36:34,091
so you can continue
to enjoy the experience.

524
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:35,790
No, no, no, no, no.

525
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:37,070
I can't switch!

526
01:36:37,290 --> 01:36:37,590
I can't!

527
01:36:38,230 --> 01:36:39,430
Especially not now!

528
01:36:39,730 --> 01:36:41,070
There is no other option.

529
01:37:07,870 --> 01:37:08,870
Sue?

530
01:37:14,170 --> 01:37:15,170
Sue!

531
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:16,270
Babe?

532
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:26,420
Sue?

533
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:28,160
You alright?

534
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:35,480
Should I start all about tomorrow?

535
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:42,400
Babe?

536
01:37:46,630 --> 01:37:48,030
Babe?

537
01:37:55,570 --> 01:37:56,270
Sue?

538
01:37:56,271 --> 01:37:58,350
Is something wrong?

539
01:38:03,190 --> 01:38:05,391
Are you a little cranky because you're
related business?

540
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:11,220
Sue, open the door.

541
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:13,280
Come on, Sue!

542
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:14,920
Is that funny?

543
01:38:15,020 --> 01:38:16,020
I need to take a piss.

544
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:18,620
Sue, open the door!

545
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:20,900
Open the door, Sue!

546
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Come on!

547
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:43,440
Open the door!

548
01:38:43,620 --> 01:38:44,620
Come on!

549
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:54,460
The fuck?

550
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:57,400
Get the fuck out!

551
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:58,800
Who's this?

552
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:00,060
Who the fuck is this?

553
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:01,380
Then leave me alone!

554
01:39:09,230 --> 01:39:11,780
What the fuck?

555
01:40:05,050 --> 01:40:06,050
Yes.

556
01:40:09,110 --> 01:40:10,590
It's 503.

557
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:13,410
I want to stop.

558
01:40:14,090 --> 01:40:15,090
Are you sure?

559
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:17,250
Once you stop, you can't go back.

560
01:40:17,630 --> 01:40:18,630
I want to stop!

561
01:40:19,370 --> 01:40:21,050
I want to fucking stop!

562
01:40:21,770 --> 01:40:23,170
I want to stop!

563
01:40:24,150 --> 01:40:25,150
We'll deliver.

564
01:41:12,330 --> 01:41:13,730
Sue, I want to...

565
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:36,770
Are you sure?

566
01:42:38,570 --> 01:42:40,530
Once you stop, you can't go back.

567
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:43,530
You will simply remain on your own.

568
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:46,830
Just on your own.

569
01:42:48,350 --> 01:42:50,790
Just on your own.

570
01:42:52,270 --> 01:42:53,830
Shut the fuck up!

571
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:02,550
I can't do this.

572
01:44:04,853 --> 01:44:06,213
I need you.

573
01:44:07,650 --> 01:44:09,860
Because I hate myself.

574
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:16,860
You gotta get ready.

575
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:18,700
It's our big night.

576
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:22,280
Come on, they're gonna love you so much.

577
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:24,980
Come on.

578
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:26,760
Come on.

579
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:27,620
What?

580
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:30,200
You're the only lovable part of me.

581
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:31,720
You have to come back.

582
01:44:32,225 --> 01:44:33,400
You have to come back!

583
01:44:33,620 --> 01:44:34,620
Come back!

584
01:44:58,500 --> 01:44:59,500
Come on.

585
01:45:00,820 --> 01:45:01,840
Come on!

586
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:09,490
Come on!

587
01:46:04,210 --> 01:46:05,610
Oh,

588
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:18,700
no!

589
01:47:57,530 --> 01:47:58,530
Oh!

590
01:49:25,170 --> 01:49:30,000
You got an

591
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:13,780
hour and a half of makeup.

592
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:13,960
Here.

593
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:15,696
Then we gotta enjoy the fitting room.

594
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:16,100
Keep your dress.

595
01:51:16,460 --> 01:51:19,096
After that, we have one final test on
stage for lighting the sound.

596
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:20,716
We have a bit of downtime before the show
starts.

597
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:21,060
You got it?

598
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:21,840
You good?

599
01:51:22,060 --> 01:51:23,060
Okay, let's go.

600
01:51:23,480 --> 01:51:24,480
Come on.

601
01:51:31,270 --> 01:51:32,270
Dress!

602
01:51:32,590 --> 01:51:33,590
Wonderful.

603
01:51:34,710 --> 01:51:35,710
Perfect.

604
01:51:43,770 --> 01:51:45,110
There you go.

605
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:53,240
Good?

606
01:51:53,900 --> 01:51:54,940
You get the dance lights?

607
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:01,700
I'm gonna be right back, sorry.

608
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:12,900
Oh!

609
01:52:55,490 --> 01:52:56,490
Sue,

610
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:31,160
they need to see you on stage to set the
lights.

611
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:34,140
Huh?

612
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:59,680
Have you ever dreamt of a better version
of yourself?

613
01:54:01,620 --> 01:54:04,080
More beautiful, more perfect.

614
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:05,880
Sue!

615
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:09,130
Who's there?

616
01:54:09,510 --> 01:54:11,070
Okay, so I'll wait for you on stage.

617
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:28,600
Sue?

618
01:54:32,030 --> 01:54:34,630
Let me introduce you to the shareholders.

619
01:54:35,010 --> 01:54:37,650
They have been dying to meet you.

620
01:54:43,230 --> 01:54:45,431
Is everything... okay?

621
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:51,100
So smile!

622
01:54:59,210 --> 01:55:01,410
That's what we want tonight!

623
01:55:02,690 --> 01:55:06,050
Pretty girls should always smile!

624
01:55:07,130 --> 01:55:07,830
Come on, come on, come on!

625
01:55:07,890 --> 01:55:08,430
Girls, come on!

626
01:55:08,550 --> 01:55:10,490
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

627
01:55:12,070 --> 01:55:13,790
Come on, we gotta go!

628
01:55:15,890 --> 01:55:16,890
Tiffany!

629
01:55:17,350 --> 01:55:17,670
Cindy!

630
01:55:18,290 --> 01:55:18,550
Ashley!

631
01:55:18,990 --> 01:55:19,990
Go, go, go, go, go!

632
01:55:20,490 --> 01:55:20,970
Feathers!

633
01:55:21,110 --> 01:55:21,670
Feathers!

634
01:55:21,850 --> 01:55:22,850
Feathers!

635
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:15,780
Are you ready for tonight?

636
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:07,140
I just need a better version of myself.

637
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:10,200
Please give me a better version of myself,
please!

638
01:57:16,300 --> 01:57:17,300
Please!

639
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:20,620
Come on!

640
01:59:15,320 --> 01:59:19,140
Looks like everything sure is in the right
place this time.

641
01:59:20,760 --> 01:59:23,960
Please say your name, age, measurements.

642
02:00:01,010 --> 02:00:02,010
Pretty girls

643
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:24,300
should always smile!

644
02:02:59,180 --> 02:03:00,980
At last, we're starting to worry.

645
02:03:01,260 --> 02:03:02,380
Hurry up, you're up in five.

646
02:04:13,020 --> 02:04:15,480
You will not be disappointed.

647
02:04:16,260 --> 02:04:18,440
She's my most beautiful creation.

648
02:04:18,640 --> 02:04:20,440
I have shaped her for success.

649
02:04:31,810 --> 02:04:32,810
One!

650
02:06:13,030 --> 02:06:18,510
I'm so happy to be with you tonight.

651
02:06:21,650 --> 02:06:26,850
I miss you all so much.

652
02:06:43,315 --> 02:06:48,000
I love you.

653
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:39,500
- The monster!
- Shoot the monster!

654
02:08:07,660 --> 02:08:09,060
Monster!

655
02:08:17,820 --> 02:08:18,820
Monster!

656
02:09:32,680 --> 02:09:35,060
In the middle of her face instead of that
nose.

657
02:09:38,440 --> 02:09:39,440
Next!

658
02:09:45,670 --> 02:09:48,690
Pretty girls should always smile!

659
02:09:54,360 --> 02:09:56,640
At fifty, it stops.

660
02:11:08,770 --> 02:11:09,770
Please!
