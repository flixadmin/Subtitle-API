1
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,900
Episode 3 - The Queen's Justice.

2
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,276
The bastard of Winterfell.

3
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,692
The dwarf of Casterly Rock.

4
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,946
I believe we last saw each other
atop the Wall.

5
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,499
You were pissing off the edge,
if I remember right.

6
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,373
Picked up some scars
along the road.

7
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,921
It's been a long road.

8
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,881
But we're both still here.

9
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,345
I'm Tyrion Lannister.

10
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,838
Davos Seaworth.

11
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,298
Ah, the Onion Knight.

12
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:06,260
We fought on opposite sides
at the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

13
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,060
Unluckily for me.

14
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,973
Missandei is the queen's
most trusted advisor.

15
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,484
Welcome to Dragonstone.

16
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,562
Our queen knows
it is a long journey.

17
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:20,524
She appreciates the efforts
you have made on her behalf.

18
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,283
If you wouldn't mind
handing over your weapons...

19
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,283
Of course.

20
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,976
Shit.

21
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,483
Please, this way.

22
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,857
Where are you from?

23
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,908
I can't place the accent.

24
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,032
I was born
on the Island of Naath.

25
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,956
Ah. I hear
it's beautiful down there.

26
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,284
Palm trees and butterflies.
Haven't been, myself.

27
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,791
This place has changed.

28
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,762
And Sansa?
I hear she's alive and well.

29
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,844
- She is.
- Does she miss me terribly?

30
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,149
A sham marriage.
And unconsummated.

31
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,318
- I didn't ask.
- Well, it was.

32
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:44,149
Wasn't. Anyway. She's much
smarter than she lets on.

33
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,734
She's starting to let on.

34
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,111
Good.

35
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,575
At some point, I want to hear

36
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,749
how a Night's Watch recruit
became King in the North.

37
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,246
As long as you tell me

38
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,580
how a Lannister became
Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.

39
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,086
A long and bloody tale.

40
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,589
To be honest,
I was drunk for most of it.

41
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,798
My Bannerman think
I'm a fool for coming here.

42
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,258
Of course they do.

43
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:13,095
If I was your Hand,
I would have advised against it.

44
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,561
General rule of thumb,

45
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,394
Stark men don't fare well
when they travel south.

46
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,319
True.

47
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,362
But I'm not a Stark.

48
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,042
I'd say you get used to them,

49
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,508
but you never really do.

50
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,928
Come, their mother
is waiting for you.

51
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,105
I wondered why you weren't
there to meet our guests.

52
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,859
You begged us to summon
the King in the North.

53
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,328
Don't you want to see him again?

54
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,788
I've done my part.

55
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,284
I've brought
ice and fire together.

56
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,417
Strange.

57
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,962
You spoke so highly of Jon Snow,

58
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,128
but when he arrives
you hide on a cliff.

59
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,419
I didn't take you
for a bashful girl.

60
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,386
My time whispering in the ears
of kings has come to an end.

61
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,762
Oh, I doubt that.

62
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,391
Give us common folk
one taste of power,

63
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,722
we're like the lion
who tasted man.

64
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,149
Nothing is ever so sweet again.

65
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,946
Neither of us is
common folk anymore.

66
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,784
I did not part on good terms
with the King in the North,

67
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,746
- or his advisor.
- Why?

68
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,867
Because of mistakes I made.

69
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,711
Terrible mistakes.

70
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,300
I would only be a distraction
if stayed.

71
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,627
- So, where will you go?
- Volantis.

72
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,178
Good.

73
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,714
If you don't mind my saying,

74
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:17,427
I don't think you should
return to Westeros.

75
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,891
I'm not sure you'd be safe here.

76
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,943
Oh, I will return, dear spider,
one last time.

77
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,361
My lady...

78
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,439
I have to die
in this strange country.

79
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,441
Just like you.

80
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,535
You stand in the presence of

81
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,201
Daenerys Stormborn
of House Targaryen.

82
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,415
Rightful heir
to the Iron Throne,

83
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,289
rightful Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

84
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,917
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms,

85
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,498
the Mother of Dragons,

86
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,628
the Khaleesi
of the Great Grass Sea,

87
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,429
the Unburnt,
the Breaker of Chains.

88
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,810
This is Jon Snow.

89
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,062
He's King in the North.

90
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,900
Thank you for travelling so far,
my lord.

91
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:53,985
I hope the seas
weren't too rough.

92
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,532
The winds were kind, Your Grace.

93
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:59,908
Apologies, I have
a Flea Bottom accent, I know,

94
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,160
but Jon Snow is
King in the North, Your Grace.

95
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,375
- He's not a lord.
- Forgive me...

96
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,494
Your Grace,
this is Ser Davos Seaworth.

97
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,538
Forgive me, Ser Davos.

98
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,214
I never did receive
a formal education.

99
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,294
But I could have sworn I read
the last King in the North

100
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,219
was Torrhen Stark,

101
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,343
who bent the knee
to my ancestor, Aegon Targaryen.

102
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:22,302
In exchange for his life
and the lives of the Northmen,

103
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:27,390
Torrhen Stark swore fealty to
House Targaryen, in perpetuity.

104
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,691
Or do I have my facts wrong?

105
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:30,980
I wasn't there, Your Grace.

106
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,529
No, of course not.

107
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,948
But still, an oath is an oath.

108
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,325
And perpetuity means...

109
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,370
What does perpetuity mean,
Lord Tyrion?

110
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,494
- Forever.
- Forever.

111
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:49,545
So, I assume, my lord,
you're here to bend the knee.

112
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,757
I am not.

113
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,718
Oh.

114
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,637
Well, that is unfortunate.

115
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,682
You've travelled all this way

116
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,634
to break faith
with House Targaryen?

117
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,936
Break faith?

118
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,435
Your father
burned my grandfather alive.

119
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,061
He burned my uncle alive.

120
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,150
He would have burned
the Seven Kingdoms...

121
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,775
My father was an evil man.

122
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,824
On behalf of House Targaryen,

123
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,618
I ask your forgiveness

124
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,821
for the crimes he committed
against your family.

125
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,412
And I ask you
not to judge a daughter

126
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,331
by the sins of her father.

127
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,798
Our two houses
were allies for centuries,

128
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,709
and those were
the best centuries

129
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,760
the Seven Kingdoms
have ever known.

130
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,555
Centuries of peace
and prosperity,

131
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,179
with a Targaryen
sitting on the Iron Throne

132
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,519
and a Stark serving
as Warden of the North.

133
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,057
I am the last Targaryen,
Jon Snow.

134
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,397
Honour the pledge
your ancestor made to mine.

135
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:58,106
Bend the knee and I will
name you Warden of the North.

136
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,191
Together, we will
save this country

137
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,277
from those who would destroy it.

138
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,372
You're right.

139
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,253
You're not guilty
of your father's crimes.

140
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,423
And I'm not beholden
to my ancestor's vows.

141
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,381
Then why are you here?

142
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,888
Because I need your help,
and you need mine.

143
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,937
Did you see three dragons flying
overhead when you arrived?

144
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,188
I did.

145
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,520
And did you see the Dothraki,

146
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,571
all of whom
have sworn to kill for me?

147
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,361
They're hard to miss.

148
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,159
But still, I need your help?

149
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,611
Not to defeat Cersei.

150
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,488
You could storm
King's Landing tomorrow

151
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,993
and the city would fall.

152
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,291
Hell, we almost took it
and we didn't even have dragons.

153
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,868
Almost.

154
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,420
But you haven't
stormed King's Landing.

155
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,872
Why not?

156
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,592
The only reason I can see is
you don't want to kill

157
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,838
thousands of innocent people.

158
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,555
It's the fastest way to win
the war, but you won't do it.

159
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:09,518
Which means, at the very least,
you're better than Cersei.

160
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:14,227
Still, that doesn't explain
why I need your help.

161
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:20,321
Because right now, you and I
and Cersei and everyone else,

162
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,343
we're children
playing at a game,

163
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,484
screaming that
the rules aren't fair.

164
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,785
- You told me you liked this man.
- I do.

165
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,282
In the time since he's met me,

166
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,160
he's refused to call me queen,

167
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,913
he's refused to bow,
and now he's calling me a child.

168
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,707
I believe
he's calling all of us children.

169
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:36,833
Figure of speech.

170
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,132
Your Grace, everyone you know
will die before winter's over

171
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,255
if we don't defeat
the enemy to the North.

172
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,837
As far as I can see,
you are the enemy to the North.

173
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,593
I'm not your enemy.

174
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,766
The dead are the enemy.

175
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,558
The dead. Is that
another figure of speech?

176
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,560
The Army of the Dead
is on the march.

177
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,770
The Army of the Dead?

178
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,355
You don't know me well, my lord,
but do you think I'm a liar?

179
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,739
Or a madman?

180
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,158
No, I don't think
you're either of those things.

181
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,201
The Army of the Dead is real.

182
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,405
The White Walkers are real.
The Night King is real.

183
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,535
I've seen them.

184
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,036
If they get past the Wall

185
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,040
and we're squabbling
amongst ourselves,

186
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,256
we're finished.

187
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,889
I was born at Dragonstone.

188
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,805
Not that I can remember it.

189
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,972
We fled before Robert's
assassins could find us.

190
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,355
Robert was your father's
best friend, no?

191
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:44,109
I wonder if your father knew
his best friend sent assassins

192
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,531
to murder a baby girl
in her crib.

193
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,906
Not that it matters now,
of course.

194
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,581
I spent my life
in foreign lands.

195
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,580
So many men
have tried to kill me,

196
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,252
I don't remember
all their names.

197
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:04,375
I have been sold
like a broodmare.

198
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:11,266
I've been chained and betrayed,
raped and defiled.

199
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,642
Do you know
what kept me standing

200
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,765
through all those years
in exile?

201
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,431
Faith.

202
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,146
Not in any gods,

203
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,646
not in myths and legends.

204
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:26,905
In myself.

205
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,401
In Daenerys Targaryen.

206
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,242
The world hadn't seen
a dragon in centuries,

207
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,706
until my children were born.

208
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:41,086
The Dothraki hadn't
crossed the sea, any sea.

209
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,626
They did for me.

210
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,426
I was born to rule
the Seven Kingdoms,

211
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,132
and I will.

212
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,759
You'll be ruling
over a graveyard

213
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,936
if we don't defeat
the Night King.

214
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,566
The war against my sister
has already begun.

215
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,860
You can't expect us
to halt hostilities

216
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,770
and join you in fighting

217
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,321
whatever you saw
beyond the Wall.

218
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,697
You don't believe him.

219
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,653
I understand that,
it sounds like nonsense.

220
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,592
But if destiny has brought
Daenerys Targaryen

221
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,491
back to our shores,

222
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,623
it has also made Jon Snow
King in the North.

223
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:26,081
You were the first
to bring Dothraki to Westeros?

224
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,168
He is the first to make allies
of wildlings and Northmen.

225
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,219
He was named Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch,

226
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,763
he was named King in the North.
Not because of his birthright.

227
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,967
He has no birthright,
he's a bastard.

228
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,307
All those hard sons
chose him as their leader

229
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,855
because they believe in him.

230
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,105
All those things
you don't believe in,

231
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,690
he faced those things.

232
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,193
He fought those things
for the good of his people.

233
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,649
He risked his life
for his people.

234
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,529
He took a knife in the heart
for his people.

235
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,069
He gave his own...

236
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,707
If we don't put aside
our enmities and band together,

237
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,788
we will die.

238
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,293
And then it doesn't matter

239
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,712
whose skeleton sits
on the Iron Throne.

240
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,964
If it doesn't matter,
then you might as well kneel.

241
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,095
Swear your allegiance
to Queen Daenerys,

242
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,930
help her to defeat my sister,

243
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,929
and together, our armies
will protect the North.

244
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,056
There's no time for that.

245
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,432
There's no time for any of this!

246
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,309
While we stand here, debating...

247
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,057
It takes no time
to bend the knee.

248
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,813
Pledge your sword to her cause.

249
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,105
And why would I do that?

250
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,783
I mean no offense, Your Grace,
but I don't know you.

251
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,078
As far as I can tell,
your claim to the throne

252
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,163
rests entirely
on your father's name,

253
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,458
and my own father fought
to overthrow the Mad King.

254
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:50,212
The lords of the North placed
their trust in me to lead them,

255
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:54,007
and I will continue to do so,
as well as I can.

256
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,846
That's fair.

257
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,263
It's also fair to point out that

258
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,346
I'm the rightful Queen
of the Seven Kingdoms.

259
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:08,142
By declaring yourself king
of the northernmost kingdom,

260
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,818
you are in open rebellion.

261
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,624
You must forgive my manners.

262
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,331
You'll both be tired
after your long journey.

263
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,793
We'll have baths drawn for you
and supper sent to your rooms.

264
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,807
Am I your prisoner?

265
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,150
Not yet.

266
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,458
Our Ironborn and Dornish allies
were attacked en route to Dorne.

267
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:11,798
And?

268
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:15,296
Two or three ships escaped,
the rest, sunk or captured.

269
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:18,220
Ellaria and the Sand Snakes
dead or captured.

270
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,259
The Greyjoys dead or captured.

271
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,511
All of them?

272
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,359
Your sister's dead?

273
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,948
Euron has her.

274
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,247
You saw him take her?

275
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,539
But you got away?

276
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,417
I couldn't save her. I tried.

277
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,790
You wouldn't be here
if you tried.

278
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,619
- What a
- Traitor!

279
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,580
This is the life.

280
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:39,172
Look at them,
cheering for a Greyjoy.

281
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,839
Greyjoy!

282
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,218
I have to be honest,
this is making me hard.

283
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,767
Did you see Little Theon's face

284
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,473
right before
he jumped overboard?

285
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,397
"Oh, no!"

286
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:59,317
What a twat.

287
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,495
Blighter! Murderer!

288
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,629
My queen,
please accept this gift,

289
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:09,558
on behalf of all of your loyal
subjects in the Iron Islands.

290
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:18,567
I give you
what no other man could give.

291
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,731
Justice.

292
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,527
Justice for your
murdered daughter.

293
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,409
You've proven yourself

294
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,870
the greatest captain
on the Fourteen Seas,

295
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,584
and a true friend to the Crown.

296
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,925
You deserve
more than a true friend.

297
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,337
And you deserve a proper reward
for your heroism.

298
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,090
There's only one reward I want.

299
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,010
You shall have
what your heart desires

300
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,772
when the war is won.

301
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,449
With Euron Greyjoy
commanding our naval forces,

302
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,451
and Jaime Lannister
leading our armies,

303
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,655
the sons and daughters
of Westeros

304
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,785
shall defend our country.

305
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,957
There's nothing quite like it,
is there?

306
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,667
The love of the people.

307
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,424
Though I suppose
you wouldn't know.

308
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,382
This same mob
spat at my sister not long ago.

309
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,137
And if you turn on us,

310
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:36,595
they'll cheer to see
your head mounted on a spike.

311
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:37,725
Or yours.

312
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,190
They just like
severed heads, really.

313
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:44,023
Listen, if you have
any advice at all,

314
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,820
I'd love to hear it.

315
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,782
When we have an hour
or two to speak, as brothers.

316
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,450
Advice?

317
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:54,029
Does she like it gentle
or rough?

318
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,698
A finger in the bum?

319
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,209
Not now. We'll talk later.

320
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,888
I want you to know
I understand.

321
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,731
Even though we're enemies,
you and I,

322
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,399
I understand the fury
that drives you.

323
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:25,481
I was there that day,

324
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,608
when Ser Gregor
crushed your lover's head.

325
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,612
If I close my eyes,

326
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:35,241
I can hear the sound
of Oberyn's skull breaking.

327
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,539
The sound of your scream.

328
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:41,084
I never heard a sound like that.
I thought, "That's true love."

329
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,296
Oberyn looked beautiful
that day, he really did.

330
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,463
No one moved like him.

331
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,667
No one had such skill
with a spear.

332
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,095
Even Ser Gregor
couldn't stop him.

333
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,094
If only he hadn't taunted him.

334
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,976
He could've walked away
and left poor Ser Gregor to die.

335
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:00,895
But that wasn't
your lover's way, was it?

336
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,060
Now he's buried somewhere.

337
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:06,685
And here's Ser Gregor,
stronger than ever.

338
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,686
That must be difficult for you.

339
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,321
When my daughter
was taken from me,

340
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,073
my only daughter,

341
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:20,032
well, you can't imagine
how that feels

342
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,617
unless you've lost a child.

343
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,453
I fed her at my own breast

344
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,004
even though they told me
to give her to the wet nurse.

345
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,462
I couldn't bear to see her
in another woman's arms.

346
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,213
I never got to have a mother,
but Myrcella did.

347
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,926
She was mine,
and you took her from me.

348
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,931
Why did you do that?

349
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,897
Doesn't matter now.

350
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,988
Your daughter's a beauty, too.

351
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:04,292
Those brown eyes, those lips.

352
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,042
Perfect Dornish beauty.

353
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,623
I imagine she's your favourite.

354
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:13,085
I know, I know, we're not
supposed to have favourites,

355
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,132
but still, we're only human.

356
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,298
We love whom we love.

357
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,428
I'm sorry,
I can't understand you.

358
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,644
That gag makes it impossible to
understand what you're saying.

359
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,270
It must be frustrating.

360
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,571
We all make our choices.

361
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,238
You chose to murder my daughter.

362
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,407
You must have felt powerful

363
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:39,945
after you made that choice.

364
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,616
Do you feel powerful now?

365
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,416
I don't sleep very well.

366
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,002
Not at all, really.

367
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,799
I like in bed
and I stare at the canopy,

368
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,294
and imagine ways
of killing my enemies.

369
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,004
How to destroy Ellaria Sand,

370
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,135
the woman who murdered
my only daughter?

371
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,768
I thought about having
Ser Gregor crush your skull

372
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,478
the way he did Oberyn's.

373
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,773
Would be poetic, I suppose,
but fast, too fast.

374
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,153
I thought about having him crush
your daughter's skull.

375
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,939
She's so beautiful.

376
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,701
The thought of this lovely face
cracking open like a duck egg,

377
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,203
no, it's just not right.

378
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,375
Mama.

379
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,468
Qyburn here
is the cleverest man I know.

380
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,768
Clever enough to learn

381
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,016
what poison you used
to murder Myrcella.

382
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,520
- The Long Goodbye, was that it?
- The Long Farewell.

383
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,316
That's the one.

384
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:56,946
How long does the poison take?

385
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,193
Difficult to say.

386
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,526
Hours, days, it depends
on the subject's constitution.

387
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,861
But death is certain?

388
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,329
Oh, yes, Your Grace,
quite certain.

389
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,497
Your daughter will die here
in this cell,

390
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,253
and you will be here watching
when she does.

391
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,377
You'll be here
the rest of your days.

392
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,431
If you refuse to eat, we'll
force food down your throat.

393
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:28,015
You will live
to watch your daughter rot.

394
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:33,980
To watch that beautiful face
collapse to bone and dust.

395
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,273
All the while contemplating
the choices you've made.

396
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,911
Make sure the guards change
the torches every few hours,

397
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,579
I don't want her
to miss a thing.

398
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,023
No.

399
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,156
Don't.

400
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:17,121
What are you doing?
No one can see us like this.

401
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,796
I am the
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms,

402
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,339
I'll do as I please.

403
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,638
Forgive me, Your Grace.

404
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,761
The visitor from Braavos
has arrived.

405
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,468
Good. And we'll need
fresh sheets for the bed.

406
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,391
At once, Your Grace.

407
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,487
No, thank you.

408
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:50,988
My condolences, Your Grace,
on the death of your son.

409
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,994
From all reports,
he was a fine young man.

410
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,292
The Iron Bank didn't send you
here to offer condolences.

411
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,208
Condolences and congratulations.

412
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,673
To become the first ruling
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms,

413
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,842
that's quite an accomplishment.

414
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,135
The Iron Bank appreciates

415
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,508
how you cast off
the yoke of superstition,

416
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,051
freeing the Crown from elements

417
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,725
who sought to subvert
the rule of law.

418
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,347
The destruction of
the Sept of Baelor

419
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:15,804
was a tragic accident.

420
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,013
Indeed.

421
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:20,233
But sometimes tragedies
are necessary

422
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,192
to restore order
and rational leadership.

423
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,145
The Iron Bank
wants its gold back.

424
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,736
Your father
never minced words either.

425
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,819
But, yes,
your debts are considerable.

426
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,284
And you're now engaged
in a conflict on several fronts.

427
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:37,284
We both know
how expensive war can be.

428
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,460
And we both know gold wins wars.

429
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,045
Your vaults are empty.

430
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,623
Your late husband's profligacy
saw to that.

431
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,083
Your wealthiest allies,
the Tyrells,

432
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,335
are now your enemies.

433
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:50,430
You are surrounded on all sides
by rivals for the Throne.

434
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,514
And the Iron Bank
wants to bet on a winner.

435
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,263
We don't make bets.

436
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,972
We invest in endeavours

437
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:57,850
we deem likely to be successful.

438
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,805
A fancy way of saying bet.

439
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,727
The war's already begun,
I've drawn first blood.

440
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,029
I decapitated the Dornish snake.

441
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,570
My armada owns the Narrow Sea.

442
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,992
Euron Greyjoy's armada owns
the Narrow Sea.

443
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,286
Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.

444
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,783
For now.

445
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:19,621
Daenerys Targaryen
has three full-grown dragons.

446
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:23,796
How well do wooden ships fare
against fire-breathing dragons?

447
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:27,550
Her dragons might not be
as invulnerable as some think.

448
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,341
But let's talk about
the Targaryen girl.

449
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,218
You want to invest in her?

450
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:36,510
I'm guessing the Iron Bank
invested considerable gold

451
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,603
in the slave trade.

452
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,349
How are your profits,

453
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,314
now that Daenerys has freed
all the slaves?

454
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:46,148
The slave trade has entered
a downturn, it's true.

455
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,403
From what I gather,
she considers herself

456
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,857
more of a revolutionary
than a monarch.

457
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,409
In your experience,

458
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,612
how do bankers usually fare
with revolutionaries?

459
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,539
The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank
quite a lot of money,

460
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,708
but Lannisters
always pay their debts.

461
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,333
Do former slaves, or Dothraki,
or dragons?

462
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,835
Your father's daughter, indeed.

463
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,340
Give me a fortnight.

464
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,423
Stay in King's Landing
as my honoured guest.

465
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,805
And when you return to Braavos,
I swear to you,

466
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,806
my debt will be paid in full.

467
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,206
I came down here to brood

468
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,380
over my failure to predict
the Greyjoy attack.

469
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,501
You're making it difficult.

470
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,591
You look a lot better brooding
than I do.

471
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,453
You make me feel
like I'm failing

472
00:32:58,477 --> 00:32:59,513
at brooding over failing.

473
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,310
I'm a prisoner on this island.

474
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:05,102
I wouldn't say you're a prisoner
on this island.

475
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,604
You're free to walk the castle,
the beaches,

476
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,694
to go wherever you want.

477
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,235
Except to my ship.

478
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,195
You took my ship.

479
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:14,239
I wouldn't say
we took your ship.

480
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,534
I'm not playing
word games with you.

481
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,702
The dead are coming for us all.

482
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,199
Why don't you figure out
what to do

483
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,623
about my missing fleet
and murdered allies,

484
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,622
and I'll figure out what to do
about your walking dead men.

485
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,453
It's hard for me to fathom,
it really is.

486
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,379
If someone told me about
the White Walkers

487
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:30,832
and the Night King...

488
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,260
You probably don't believe me.

489
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:42,719
I do, actually.

490
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,513
You didn't before.

491
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:49,149
"Grumkins and Snarks,"
you called them.

492
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:50,236
Do you remember?

493
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,403
You said it was all nonsense.

494
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:56,528
It was nonsense.
Everybody knew it.

495
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,779
But then Mormont saw them,
and you saw them.

496
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,830
And I trust the eyes
of an honest man

497
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,828
more than I trust
what everybody knows.

498
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,252
How do I convince people
who don't know me

499
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:09,954
that an enemy
they don't believe in

500
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,129
is coming to kill them all?

501
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:12,752
Good question.

502
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:15,881
I know it's a good question,
I'm looking for an answer.

503
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,806
People's minds aren't made
for problems that large.

504
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:24,803
White Walkers, the Night King,
Army of the Dead...

505
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:26,770
It's almost a relief

506
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:30,065
to confront a comfortable,
familiar monster like my sister.

507
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,063
I need to help prepare
my people for what's coming.

508
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,525
I can't help them from here.

509
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,111
I'd like to leave.

510
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,994
It seems unlikely that you
became King in the North

511
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,746
by giving up that easily.

512
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,754
Everyone told me to learn
from my father's mistakes.

513
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,332
Don't go south.

514
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,376
Don't answer a summons
from the Mad King's daughter,

515
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,711
a foreign invader.

516
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:03,258
And here I am.

517
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,096
A Northern fool.

518
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,011
Children are not
their fathers,

519
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,350
luckily for all of us.

520
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,359
And sometimes
there's more to foreign invaders

521
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,653
and Northern fools
than meets the eye.

522
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,485
Daenerys could have sailed
for Westeros long ago,

523
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:19,575
but she didn't.

524
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,696
Instead, she stayed
where she was

525
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,199
and saved many people
from horrible fates,

526
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,531
some of whom are on this island
with us right now.

527
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,533
While you're our guest here,
you might consider asking them

528
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,082
what they think
of the Mad King's daughter.

529
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,502
She protects people
from monsters,

530
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,049
just as you do.

531
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,047
It's why she came here.

532
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,132
And she's not about to
head north

533
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,633
to fight an enemy
she's never seen

534
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,590
on the word of a man
she doesn't know

535
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,509
after a single meeting.

536
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,644
It's not a reasonable thing
to ask.

537
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,988
So, do you have anything
reasonable to ask?

538
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:04,739
What do you mean?

539
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,491
Maybe you are a Northern fool.

540
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,787
I'm asking if there's something
I can do to help you.

541
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:16,748
- Dragonglass?
- Yes. Volcanic glass.

542
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,629
Obsidian. He says you have
a tremendous amount of it here.

543
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:23,550
Why are we talking about glass?
We just lost two of our allies.

544
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,883
Which is why I was speaking
to Jon Snow, a potential ally.

545
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,178
And what does
the King in the North want

546
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,808
with dragonglass?

547
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,311
Apparently, it can be turned
into weapons

548
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:38,236
that kill White Walkers
and their foot soldiers.

549
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,028
Or stop them.

550
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:41,859
Destroy them.

551
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,566
Unsure about the nomenclature.

552
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,328
And what do you think
about this Army of the Dead

553
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,161
and White Walkers
and Night Kings?

554
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,959
I'd very much like to believe
that Jon Snow is wrong.

555
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:57,122
But a wise man once said that
you should never believe a thing

556
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,298
simply because
you want to believe it.

557
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,844
Which wise man said this?

558
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,256
I don't remember.

559
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,474
Are you trying to present
your own statements

560
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:10,722
as ancient wisdom?

561
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,846
I would never do that.

562
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,357
To you.

563
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,444
The reason I believe Jon Snow
is because he's here.

564
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:23,106
All of his advisors
would have told him not to come.

565
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,324
I would have told him
not to come.

566
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,867
And he's here anyway.

567
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,699
You don't have to believe him.

568
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,115
Let him mine the dragonglass.

569
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:33,908
If he's wrong, it's worthless.

570
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,743
You didn't even know
it was here.

571
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,169
It's nothing to you.

572
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,294
Give him something
by giving him nothing.

573
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,214
Take a step toward
a more productive relationship

574
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,136
with a possible ally.

575
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,764
Keep him occupied while
we focus on the task at hand.

576
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,051
Casterly Rock.

577
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,223
What was that Ser Davos said

578
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:58,391
about taking a knife
in the heart for his people?

579
00:37:58,485 --> 00:37:59,485
Did you notice that?

580
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,771
You must allow them
their flights of fancy.

581
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:04,734
It's dreary in the North.

582
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,672
Amazing thing to see.

583
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,923
I named them for my brothers,
Viserys and Rhaegar.

584
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,800
They're both gone now.

585
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,308
You lost two brothers as well.

586
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,556
People thought dragons
were gone forever,

587
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,232
but here they are.

588
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:44,066
Perhaps we should all be
examining what we think we know.

589
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,990
You've been talking to Tyrion.

590
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,824
He is my Hand.

591
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,327
He enjoys talking.

592
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,703
We all enjoy what we're good at.

593
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,539
I don't.

594
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,294
You know I'm not going to let
Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.

595
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:09,674
I never expected that you would.

596
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,971
And I haven't changed my mind

597
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,969
about which kingdoms
belong to that throne.

598
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,266
I haven't either.

599
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,688
I will allow you
to mine the dragonglass

600
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,238
and forge weapons from it.

601
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,783
Any resources or men you need,
I will provide for you.

602
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:35,905
Thank you.

603
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,831
So, you believe me, then,
about the Night King

604
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,256
and the Army of the Dead?

605
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,386
You'd better get to work,
Jon Snow.

606
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,410
How much do we have?

607
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,286
Four thousand bushels, my lady.

608
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,708
And what does that mean?

609
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,831
For the current occupants
of the castle,

610
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,881
it's enough food for a year,
perhaps more.

611
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:30,421
And what's the longest winter
in the past 100 years?

612
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,383
Uh... I'm not entirely certain.

613
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:35,055
I'll check
Maester Luwin's records.

614
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,554
He kept a copy
of every raven scroll.

615
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,720
You're telling me
we don't have enough food.

616
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,600
Especially not
if the armies of the North

617
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,931
come back to defend Winterfell.

618
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,401
No, my lady, most likely not.

619
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:49,479
Then we must prepare
for that eventuality.

620
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,647
Whatever direction
the threat comes from,

621
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,232
this is the best place to be.

622
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,950
We need to start building up
our grain stores

623
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,120
with regular shipments
from every keep in the North.

624
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,617
If we don't use it
by winter's end,

625
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:00,788
we'll give it back to them.

626
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,117
But if the entire North
has to flee to Winterfell,

627
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:06,670
they won't have time to bring
wagonloads of grain with them.

628
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,084
Very wise, my lady.

629
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,961
Maester Wolkan,
you'll see to it?

630
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,842
Are they covering those
breastplates in leather?

631
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,548
No, my lady.

632
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,140
Shouldn't they be?

633
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:20,760
Once the real cold comes?

634
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:21,969
They should, indeed.

635
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:23,641
Pardon me, my lady.

636
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,932
You there, why isn't there
leather on these?

637
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,356
Command suits you.

638
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,398
The Northerners are all
facing north,

639
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,529
worried about the threat
from beyond the Wall.

640
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,201
So they should be.

641
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,620
I know Cersei better
than anyone here.

642
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:42,907
If you turn your back on her...

643
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,163
You don't know Cersei
better than anyone here.

644
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:46,878
I only meant to say...

645
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:49,296
That the woman who murdered
my mother, father and brother

646
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:50,382
is dangerous?

647
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,048
Thank you for your wise counsel.

648
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,465
One of two things will happen.

649
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,680
Either the dead will defeat
the living, in which case...

650
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,100
All our troubles come to an end.

651
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,478
Or life will win out.

652
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,395
And what then?

653
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,149
Don't fight in the North,

654
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:10,810
or the South.

655
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,106
Fight every battle,
everywhere, always,

656
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,032
in your mind.

657
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:20,736
Everyone is your enemy,

658
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,162
everyone is your friend.

659
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:27,876
Every possible series of events
is happening all at once.

660
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,463
Live that way
and nothing will surprise you.

661
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:33,425
Everything that happens

662
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,001
will be something
that you've seen before.

663
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:40,969
Lady Sansa. At the gate.

664
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:14,633
Hello, Sansa.

665
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:36,649
I wish Jon were here.

666
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,947
Yes.

667
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,531
I need to speak to him.

668
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,364
You're Father's last living
trueborn son.

669
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,997
You're Lord of Winterfell now.

670
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,212
I can never be
Lord of Winterfell.

671
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:57,170
I can never be lord of anything.

672
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,467
I'm the Three-Eyed Raven.

673
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,220
I don't know what that means.

674
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:04,681
It's difficult to explain.

675
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,724
Try. Please, for me.

676
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,061
It means I can see everything.

677
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,856
Everything that's
ever happened, to everyone.

678
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,226
Everything that's happening
right now.

679
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:20,314
It's all pieces now, fragments.

680
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,817
I need to learn to see better.

681
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,990
When the Long Night comes again,

682
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,659
I need to be ready.

683
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:33,957
How do you know all this?

684
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:35,879
The three-eyed raven taught me.

685
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,794
I thought you were
the Three-Eyed Raven.

686
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,424
I told you
it's difficult to explain.

687
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:44,723
Bran...

688
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,639
I'm sorry
for all that's happened to you.

689
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:50,724
I'm sorry it had to happen here,
in our home.

690
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,976
It was so beautiful that night.

691
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,480
Snow falling,

692
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,199
just like now.

693
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,037
And you were so beautiful,

694
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:12,700
in your white wedding dress.

695
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:18,543
I have to go back inside, Bran.

696
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:21,713
I'll stay a bit longer.

697
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,731
Hmm.

698
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,987
Hmm.

699
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,824
Does it hurt?

700
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,579
A bit.

701
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:57,248
Less than before.

702
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:01,465
The infection no longer
appears to be active.

703
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:04,130
Unusual.

704
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,420
Unlikely.

705
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:09,056
One could almost be forgiven
for thinking

706
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:12,179
that the entire upper layer
of diseased skin was debrided,

707
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,723
and the underlying region

708
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:16,350
treated with
some sort of unguent.

709
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,807
Don't know anything about that.

710
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:21,856
I just started feeling better.

711
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:24,321
I assumed it was the rest
that did it.

712
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:28,368
And the climate.

713
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:31,282
Climate.

714
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,864
You're free to go, ser.

715
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,083
This chamber is needed
for the infectious,

716
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,659
which you are no longer.

717
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:39,578
Tarly, I'd like to
speak with you

718
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:41,129
in my study this evening.

719
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,713
How bad is it?

720
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,386
Suppose I'll find out
this evening.

721
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,352
Where will you go?

722
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:59,891
I surrendered to this sickness
the moment I first saw it.

723
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,561
I knew it would kill me,

724
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,154
or I'd kill myself
before it could.

725
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,157
Daenerys Stormborn
convinced me otherwise.

726
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,486
The only place for me
is back with her.

727
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,205
I owe her my life.

728
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:18,500
Her and you.

729
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:23,254
Your father saved me
more than once.

730
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:25,423
It's the least I could do.

731
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:29,089
Perhaps our paths
will cross again.

732
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:30,674
I hope they do.

733
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:00,708
- You treated him.
- Yes.

734
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:03,545
Who told you to treat him?

735
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:05,922
No one.

736
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,967
Who forbade you, or anyone,
to attempt to treat him?

737
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,795
I seem to remember, you.

738
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,596
But you treated him anyway.

739
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:14,682
I did, yes.

740
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:19,345
I forbade it because it is
dangerous and rarely successful.

741
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,521
Especially on someone
of that age.

742
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,974
You could have infected
yourself and others.

743
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:27,269
You could have devastated
the entire Citadel.

744
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:30,532
But you didn't.

745
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,325
It's a meticulous,
difficult procedure.

746
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,571
Many maesters whose chains
are heavy with healing links

747
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:39,531
have attempted it and failed.

748
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:41,875
Yet you succeeded.

749
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:43,378
How?

750
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:48,131
I read the books
and followed the instructions.

751
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:01,053
That man is alive
because of you.

752
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,185
You should be proud.

753
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,811
Thank you, Archmaester.

754
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:11,609
Come here.

755
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:19,075
All these manuscripts
and scrolls are rotting away.

756
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,119
I need you to make copies
of them.

757
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:29,665
You were expecting a reward?

758
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,211
Your reward

759
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:33,919
is not being immediately
expelled from the Citadel.

760
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:36,880
You'd better get started.

761
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:38,640
Be careful of the paper mites.

762
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,053
They like flesh as well.

763
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:50,982
We need to find Euron Greyjoy's
fleet and sink it.

764
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,071
Your Grace,

765
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:54,193
he's already destroyed
a good portion of our fleet.

766
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:55,945
To send our remaining ships
after him...

767
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:58,448
I'm not talking about
sending our ships after him.

768
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:03,282
Would you have to go yourself?

769
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:05,659
Euron's ships could be anywhere,

770
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,540
or in more than one place.

771
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,963
You'd be flying around
the open seas alone,

772
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,049
for who knows how long.

773
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,499
I wouldn't be alone.

774
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,677
I would have Drogon, Viserion
and Rhaegal.

775
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,220
What can anyone do to them?

776
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:19,047
They can still
do something to you.

777
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:20,719
It only takes one arrow.

778
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,550
It's too great a risk.
You're too important.

779
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,597
What about Casterly Rock?

780
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:30,024
The Unsullied
will be there soon.

781
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,351
And what will they face?

782
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,816
A difficult situation.

783
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:37,115
They know we're coming.

784
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:38,362
Yes.

785
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,444
Cersei believes
my sole purpose in life

786
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:41,870
is to destroy House Lannister.

787
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:44,326
She will be ready.

788
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:49,711
No one has ever taken the Rock.

789
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:50,797
Archers!

790
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,964
The Lannister Army is still
the army my father built.

791
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,050
Come on!

792
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,500
Well trained
and well provisioned,

793
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:56,801
10,000 men at least.

794
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:57,923
They will see us coming.

795
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:04,009
They will be ready.

796
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:14,603
The gates of Casterly Rock
are impregnable.

797
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,703
The fight up the walls
will be hard.

798
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,326
We will be at a disadvantage.

799
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,417
Many men will die.

800
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:33,413
Just as my father said
they would.

801
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,883
Interesting thing
about my father.

802
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,420
He built our house up
from near ruin,

803
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,880
he built our army,

804
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:43,636
he built Casterly Rock
as we know it,

805
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:46,426
but he didn't build the sewers.

806
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,557
That was beneath him.

807
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,185
So, he gave the job to
the lowest person he could find.

808
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:52,940
Me.

809
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:54,984
He was right, I was low.

810
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,811
The company I kept, low.

811
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,521
Women, mostly.

812
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,357
They weren't welcome
at the Rock.

813
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,317
Father disapproved
of that sort of behaviour.

814
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,118
Couldn't walk them
through the front gates,

815
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,557
I couldn't have them
in my chambers.

816
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:08,324
So, in the process
of building the sewers,

817
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,496
I threw in something for myself.

818
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,583
It was a passage that began

819
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,289
in an out-of-the-way cove
by the sea

820
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,670
and ended beneath
one of the main guard towers.

821
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,673
No better place for low pursuits

822
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:22,925
than beneath the ground.

823
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:28,176
Casterly Rock
is an impregnable fortress.

824
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,897
But as a good friend of mine
once said,

825
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,976
"Give me 10 good men"

826
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:37,936
"and I'll impregnate"

827
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:44,985
And so it begins.

828
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:54,332
They'll face the bulk
of the Lannister forces.

829
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,504
They will be outnumbered.

830
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,547
They will have less armour
and fewer weapons.

831
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,381
My sister's armies fight
for her out of fear.

832
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:10,267
The Unsullied will be fighting
for something greater.

833
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,183
They will be fighting
for freedom,

834
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,226
and the person
who gave it to them.

835
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,103
They will fight for you.

836
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:17,813
And that is why

837
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:18,903
they will triumph.

838
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,411
There are none left.

839
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,669
There are supposed to be
more than this.

840
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:43,710
Many more.

841
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:06,993
Where are they?

842
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:10,237
Where are the rest
of the Lannisters?

843
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,418
It's done.

844
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:40,962
It is.

845
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:46,670
And now the rains weep
o'er our halls.

846
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:50,636
Did we fight well?

847
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:53,590
As well as could be expected.

848
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:54,887
It was never our forte.

849
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:57,844
Golden roses, indeed.

850
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:02,064
Your brother and his new queen

851
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,938
thought you would be defending
Casterly Rock.

852
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,862
The truth is Casterly Rock
isn't worth much anymore.

853
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:09,781
Well, it is to me.

854
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:13,702
But my fond childhood memories
won't keep Cersei on the throne.

855
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,658
So, you just let them take it?

856
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,701
For now.
They won't be able to hold it.

857
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,333
Euron Greyjoy's navy
burned their ships,

858
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:22,502
we emptied the larders
before we left.

859
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:25,331
Eventually they'll be forced
to abandon their position

860
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:27,541
and march all the way
across Westeros.

861
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,002
And you took your army,
your real army,

862
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:33,050
and went where they weren't.

863
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,507
As Robb Stark did to me
at Whispering Wood.

864
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,475
There are always lessons
in failures.

865
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:39,598
Yes.

866
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,895
You must be very wise by now.

867
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:45,559
My father always said
I was a slow learner.

868
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,852
If he was so clever,

869
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,733
why didn't he take Highgarden

870
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,531
the moment
your gold mines ran dry?

871
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:57,987
I suppose I'll be able
to ask him myself soon enough.

872
00:56:58,874 --> 00:57:01,787
No more learning
from my mistakes, eh?

873
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:05,961
How will you do it?

874
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:08,464
With that sword?

875
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,418
That was Joffrey's sword,
wasn't it?

876
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:13,503
Not that he ever used it.

877
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:14,847
What did he call it?

878
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,175
Widow's Wail.

879
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:21,890
He really was wasn't he?

880
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:28,356
I did unspeakable things
to protect my family.

881
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:32,238
Or watched them being done,
on my orders.

882
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,733
I never lost
a night's sleep over them.

883
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,530
They were necessary.

884
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:40,078
And whatever
I imagined necessary

885
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:43,033
for the safety of House Tyrell,
I did.

886
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:48,584
But your sister has done things

887
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,629
I was incapable of imagining.

888
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,218
That was my prize mistake.

889
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,839
A failure of imagination.

890
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,763
She's a monster,
you do know that?

891
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:05,021
To you, I'm sure.
To others as well.

892
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,394
But after we've won,

893
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,146
and there's no one left
to oppose us,

894
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,648
when people
are living peacefully

895
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,354
in the world she built,

896
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:15,614
do you really think
they'll wring their hands

897
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:17,158
over the way she built it?

898
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:20,621
You love her.

899
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,747
You really do love her.

900
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:25,700
You poor fool.

901
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,876
She'll be the end of you.

902
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:29,833
Possibly.

903
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,544
Not much to be gained

904
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,500
from discussing it with you,
though, is there?

905
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:37,086
What better person
to discuss it with?

906
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:39,802
What better guarantee
could you have

907
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:43,009
that the things you say
will never leave this room?

908
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:46,103
But perhaps you're right.

909
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:50,274
If she's driven you this far,
it's gone beyond your control.

910
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:52,481
Yes.

911
00:58:53,405 --> 00:58:54,521
It has.

912
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,273
She's a disease.

913
00:58:58,118 --> 00:58:59,905
I regret my role
in spreading it.

914
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,323
You will, too.

915
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:04,239
I think we're done here.

916
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:08,785
How will it happen?

917
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,170
Cersei had several ideas.

918
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:13,998
Whipping you through the streets

919
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:16,254
and beheading you
in front of the Red Keep.

920
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:17,506
Flaying you alive

921
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:20,179
and hanging you from the walls
of King's Landing.

922
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:24,266
I talked her out of those.

923
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:43,653
Will there be pain?

924
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:45,655
No, I made sure of that.

925
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,407
That's good.

926
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:02,505
I'd hate to die like your son.

927
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,174
Clawing at my neck,

928
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,760
foam and bile
spilling from my mouth,

929
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,272
eyes blood red, skin purple.

930
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:17,104
Must have been horrible for you,
as a Kingsguard, as a father.

931
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:19,735
It was horrible enough for me.

932
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:22,074
A shocking scene.

933
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:25,365
Not at all what I intended.

934
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:28,998
You see,

935
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:32,077
I'd never seen
the poison work before.

936
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,166
Tell Cersei.

937
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:41,636
I want her to know it was me.
