What good does that do us?

156
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,488
Look at the biggest deposit last year.
Bottom of the page.

157

"Two million dollars on Decem..."

158
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,368
December 12th.

159
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,211
- That's...
- The day Walter disappeared.

160
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,529
What if one of Backman's clients
was paid 2 million to kidnap Walter?

161
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,371
Then we find out which client it was...

162
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,204
...and use them to find Walter.

163
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,206
Okay, back trace the account.
Follow the money.

164
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,046
Hopefully, it will lead us
to whoever kidnapped Walter.

165

After all this time, do you think
Walter might still be alive?

Got it. Dominic Alonzo.

- Ugh.
- Name ring any bells?

169
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,283
Yeah. Alonzo runs the biggest
underground casino in Starling City...

170
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,562
...when he's not busy kidnapping.

171
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,207
He looks like the kind of lowlife
someone would hire to kidnap Walter.

172
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,927
How many arrows you think you'll put
in him before he gives Walter's location?

173
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,327
- Say "a lot."
- it's not that simple.

174
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,965
That casino has its own army.

175
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,324
We need to access Alonzo's computer
but without setting off any alarms.

176
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,887
Looks like we're gonna need
all the help we can get.

177
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,208
It's too bad there's not someone
we could call.

178
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,528
That's enough. We can do this on our own.

179

Well, then, it looks like someone's
going gambling tonight.

Those guys would make me
the minute I walked in.

181

Oliver Queen would never be
in a place like that.

182
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,483
I wasn't talking about you.

- Absolutely not.
- I can count cards.

theory and mathematics.

I know my way around a casino.

- Oliver, the reason I joined you...

For the first time,
we have a real chance at finding him.

You have to let me do this.

- How can you even think of doing this?

- That place took your soul, Robert.
- And doing this...

...won't give it back.

first time, I remember being annoyed.

She knew I was busy, so I just let it ring.

...I shut my phone off.

210
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:36,041
A little after midnight, two S.C.P.D.
officers showed up at my office.

...she'd been shot.

Murdered. In the Glades.

After the cops left...

215
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,441
...I sat in my office the rest of the
night, listening to Rebecca's messages.

She kept calling my name.

Asking for help.

to breathe.

Gasping for air.
