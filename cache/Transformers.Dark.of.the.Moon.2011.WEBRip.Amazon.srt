1
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:44,957
[Optimus] We were once
a peaceful race

2
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:48,744
of intelligent,
mechanical beings.

3
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:51,442
But then came the war...

4
00:00:51,486 --> 00:00:55,359
...between the Autobots,
who fought for freedom...

5
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:59,320
and the Decepticons,
who dreamt of tyranny.

6
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:08,329
Overmatched and outnumbered, our defeat was all but certain.

7
00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:23,822
But in the war's final days,

8
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:26,999
one Autobot ship
escaped the battle.

9
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:29,176
It was carrying a secret cargo,

10
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:33,136
which would have changed
our planet's fate.

11
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,496
A desperate mission.

12
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,325
Our final hope.

13
00:02:00,598 --> 00:02:03,775
A hope that vanished.

14
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:13,611
[man] One up there.
One over there.

15
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:16,136
And one more down there.

16
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:24,361
What you got?

17
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:38,114
[man] Impact detected.

18
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,117
We have impact confirmed.

Get me SecDef

21
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:07,274
[man] Mr. McNamara,
the president's expecting you.

22
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:11,669
- Get Bobby in here.
- Mr. President,
designation top secret:

23
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:14,368
We believe a UFO
has crashed into the moon.

24
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:16,674
We think the Russians
are onto it as well.

25
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:20,374
Well, then you tell NASA
to move heaven and earth.
We need to get to the moon.

26
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:22,419
[McNamara] We're going
to attempt a manned mission.

27
00:03:22,463 --> 00:03:24,247
NASA said it would
take five years.

28
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,902
You get there
before the Russians.

29
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:29,948
[president on TV] I believe
that this nation should
commit itself...

30
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:33,125
- ...to achieving the goal...
- [man on radio]
Fifteen seconds.

31
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:35,127
[president] before
this decade is out,

32
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:36,607
of landing a man on the moon

33
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:38,609
and returning him
safely to the earth.

34
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:40,785
[man on radio] Ignition
sequence starts.

35
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:43,440
Five...Four...

36
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:45,355
Three... Two...

37
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:47,792
One... All engine running.

38
00:03:47,836 --> 00:03:52,536
Liftoff. We have a liftoff,
32 minutes past the hour.

39
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,453
Liftoff onApollo 11.
Tower cleared.

40
00:03:56,497 --> 00:03:59,630
[man] Neil Armstrong
reporting.Apollo 11
on proper heading.

41
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:04,983
Apollo 11 is on the way,
riding that pillar of
flame from theSaturn V,

42
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:07,812
out there, 250,000 miles away,

43
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:12,730
where the moon is waiting
for man's first arrival.

44
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:16,908
Houston, you're a go
for landing. Over.

45
00:04:16,952 --> 00:04:21,478
[man] Forty feet, down two and
a half. Pickin' up some dust.

46
00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:25,874
Thirty feet, two and
a half down. Faint shadow.

47
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:28,920
[man 2] CAPCOM, flight.

48
00:04:28,964 --> 00:04:31,488
[man] Four forward. Drifting to the right a little.

49
00:04:31,532 --> 00:04:35,057
[man 2] OK. Down a half.

50
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,669
Contact light.
OK, engine stop.

51
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:41,498
- [beeping]
- [Armstrong] Houston, uh...

52
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:45,197
...Tranquility Base here.
TheEagle has landed.

53
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:47,765
- [all cheering]-
[man] We copy you down,Eagle.

54
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:50,855
You got a bunch of guys
about to turn blue.
We're breathin' again.

55
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:57,688
Perhaps four hundred million
persons are watching
this broadcast today

56
00:04:57,732 --> 00:05:00,343
of the greatest event
in our time

57
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:03,738
and one of the great events
of all recorded history.

58
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:07,611
[Armstrong] I'm at
the foot of the ladder.

59
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:10,614
I'm going to
step off the LEM now.

60
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:14,705
That's one
small step for man...

61
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:19,536
...one giant leap
for mankind.

62
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:21,886
- Are we good?
- Yes, sir.

63
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,542
[man] Unofficial time on the
first step, 1092...

64
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:28,328
[static]

65
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:34,029
[man]Apollo 11?
This is Houston, over.

66
00:05:34,072 --> 00:05:37,946
Eagle,we're getting
a signal interference.
Do you copy?

67
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:42,298
We now have had confirmation
of loss of signal

68
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,256
from the Apollo 11.

69
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,913
TheApollo 11 is at the moment
on the far side of the moon.

70
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:57,748
Neil, you are dark on the rock.Mission is a go.

71
00:05:58,532 --> 00:06:01,361
We have 21 minutes.

72
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:23,948
[man on radio] Three minutes,
45 seconds and counting.

73
00:06:23,992 --> 00:06:26,037
[grunts]

74
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:45,492
My God.

75
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:48,625
It's some sort of giant,
metal face.

76
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:51,019
Jesus.

77
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:52,455
[man on radio] OK.

78
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:56,285
[breathing heavily] Control...

79
00:06:56,328 --> 00:06:58,505
We are inside the ship.

80
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:03,379
Extensive damage.

81
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,687
Way too big to check
the entire ship.

82
00:07:11,387 --> 00:07:14,346
Everything's dead
in here, Houston.

83
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,001
No signs of life anywhere.

84
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:21,484
These things are massive.

85
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:25,401
We copy. You've got seven
minutes on your oxygen.

86
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,012
[man on radio] We are not
alone after all, are we?

87
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:30,798
No, sir. We're not alone.

88
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:33,148
[man on radio] All right,
go ahead, Mr. President.

89
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:36,543
[president] Hello, Neil
and Buzz. I'm talking
to you by telephone

90
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:39,371
from the Oval Room
at the White House.

91
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:45,682
And this certainly has to be
the most historic telephone
call ever made.

92
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:49,904
I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you...

93
00:07:49,947 --> 00:07:54,212
For every American,
this has to be the
proudest day of our lives.

94
00:07:54,256 --> 00:07:56,780
Because of what
you have done...

95
00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:59,043
[man on radio]
We have splashdown.

96
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:03,047
[president] ...the heavens
have become a part
of man's world.

97
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:06,486
For one priceless moment...

98
00:08:07,617 --> 00:08:11,012
...in the whole history
of man...

99
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:14,755
...all the people on this earth are truly one.

100
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:18,933
One in their pride
in what you have done.

101
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:23,328
It inspires us
to redouble our efforts

102
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:27,811
to bring peace and
tranquility to Earth.

103
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:56,231
[♪ U2: "North Star"]

104
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:05,719
[woman] My hero
needs to wake up.

105
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:22,170
- What is that?- This is your new lucky bunny.

106
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:30,439
It's a beautiful thought, Carly,but I don't think it's the
whole, uh, bunny that's lucky.

107
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:32,615
You see, it's just
this section here.

108
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:35,662
You see, it's just the
rabbit foot that's lucky.

109
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:38,665
Well, it's just
a good-luck charm.

110
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,450
Hmm? Help you think positive?

111
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:44,932
Today's important. [moans]

112
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:47,935
Come on, get up.
Hey, wear that nice tie.

113
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:52,330
- Yeah.- You need any money for lunch?

114
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:54,289
No, I don't need
any money for lunch.

115
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:56,160
I have money from
yesterday's lunch.

116
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:59,816
You love it, don't you?I'm just your American boy toy.

117
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,775
[chuckles] A lover boy toy.

118
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:04,255
You know how demoralizing it isto have saved the world twice

119
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:05,822
and still be
groveling for a job?

120
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:07,563
People don't know you
saved the world, Sam.

121
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,565
I mean, I do.
I believe you.

122
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,481
Government knows. I mean,
they could hook me up with
a job right here in DC.

123
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:15,571
I mean, I should be
workin' with the Autobots.
Otherwise, it's not fair.

124
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,791
Come on, they paid
for your college.

125
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,706
The president
gave you a hero medal.

126
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:23,710
- [snorts]
- [man] Thank you, man.
Great job.

127
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:27,844
That's the coolest thing
that ever happened to me.

128
00:10:27,888 --> 00:10:30,412
- [president] All right guys...- [whispering] What the fuck!

129
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:32,022
Wow.

130
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:35,896
And as I recall, that wasn'teven the highlight of your day.

131
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:38,289
Mr. Ambassador, here.

132
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,857
British embassy, you're up next.

133
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:47,516
- [woman] No, you don't wear it.- It's not? Well...

134
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:51,172
You took it out of the box.
You're supposed to leave it
in the box, right?

135
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:54,131
You keep it in this.
What a gorgeous box.

136
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:04,402
Oh, yeah. My medal.
You know who gave that to me?

137
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:07,014
- Who?
- POTUS.

138
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:10,408
- Oh.
- President of
the United States.

139
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:12,889
- [lamp crashes]
- [gasps]

140
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:16,023
Babe, it's hard for
everybody to get a job.

141
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:18,590
I don't have time.
You see, my parents are
gonna be here in a week

142
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:20,201
on their road trip
party bus world tour.

143
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:22,420
If my dad gets here
and I don't have a job...

144
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:25,162
...he's gonna spank me.
You know? It's go time for me.

145
00:11:25,206 --> 00:11:27,425
All right. Tonight,
I'll give you a job.

146
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:33,127
Romance me with a nice dinner
and, uh, maybe you can get
that bonus.

147
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,781
Mmm...

148
00:11:34,824 --> 00:11:37,218
- [voice] Oh...
- [shrieks]

149
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:39,263
- Get lucky.
- [Carly] Get him out of here!

150
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:41,744
No, no, no...!

151
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:43,920
- [Carly] Ugh, he's gross!
- Oh, ow! She's good.

152
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:47,619
I'm sorry. But they'restranded here. Somebody's got towatch out for them, you know?

153
00:11:47,663 --> 00:11:49,317
Yesterday, that one
was in my underwear drawer.

154
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,449
Did research. Lookin'
real good, too. [cackles]

155
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:52,668
Oh! Don't need to hit me, man.

156
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,148
You're so not
a normal boyfriend.

157
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:55,976
That's what you love
about me, isn't it?

158
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:58,239
- Bye, baby.
- We're not at
the love word yet.

159
00:11:58,282 --> 00:12:01,111
Maybe a little bit closer
when you're covering your
half of the rent.

160
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,896
- [rapping at window]
- Good-bye.

161
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:05,768
- [chuckles]
- Frickin' shortin'
my circuits out here!

162
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:08,118
It's inhumane what it is!

163
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:11,992
Make us live in a box
on a balcony, right
next to a beast!

164
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:13,950
- Like a common animal!
- Stop, OK?

165
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:16,648
You and your creepy sidekick,
you can't be in here without
permission.

166
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:18,520
Accordin' to who,

00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,594
Do I know somebody
on your board?

333
00:22:14,637 --> 00:22:16,291
Here's the deal.
You know who we are.

334
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,772
Accuretta Systems,
global leader in telecom,

335
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:21,731
aerospace, 17 billion
in profit last year.

336
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:24,952
We contract for DARPA,
NASA, JPL, you name it.

337
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:28,259
You perform here,
doors open for you anywhere.

338
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:30,566
First job out of college
is critical, kid.

339
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,526
You either take a step
down the correct career path

340
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:37,573
or you fall into
a life-sucking abyss.

341
00:22:37,617 --> 00:22:39,270
- Hm.
- So it all depends

342
00:22:39,314 --> 00:22:42,143
on how you respond
to my next two words:

343
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:44,232
Impress me.

344
00:22:44,275 --> 00:22:46,756
- Now?
- Impress me.

345
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,932
- You catch me off guard.
I don't...
- Impress me.

346
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:50,760
I'm an open book.
Ask me any question you like.

347
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:53,763
So you're a go-getter,
ramrod, take-charge kinda guy?

348
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:55,983
I'm a killer.
A stone-cold killer.

349
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:59,421
- So take-charge...
- Take charge,
Viking, barbarian...

350
00:22:59,465 --> 00:23:02,555
Of course. That's me.
Pow! I'm here.

351
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:10,301
We are not looking
for that here.

352
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:15,002
No brown-nosing. No suck-up.
No toolery. I...

353
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:19,136
- [phone beeps]
- [man] Yes, Mister Brazos.

354
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:24,707
Um, why is Shawntel using
what appears to be a red cup

355
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:28,189
from the red floor when
we are on the yellow floor?

356
00:23:28,232 --> 00:23:30,800
- [man] I'm on it.
- It is a visual,

357
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:33,977
and, therefore,
a visceral betrayal.

358
00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:37,503
- Stop it!
- Such a dumbass.

359
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:40,288
- [Brazos] Disgusting!
- [whimpers]

360
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:41,985
Thank you!

361
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:44,161
It's total
anarchy around here.

362
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:46,816
- [woman crying]
- The, uh...

363
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,341
...e-mail I, uh, read
said administrative aide?

364
00:23:50,385 --> 00:23:52,474
Nope. Mailroom.

365
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,042
I'm gonna go.

366
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:56,696
Uh, do you have any idea

367
00:23:56,739 --> 00:24:00,134
how many Ivy League
Phi Beta Kappas would kill...

368
00:24:00,177 --> 00:24:02,397
Mister, I saved
your life twice. OK?

369
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:06,619
I can't tell you how or when,
or why, but I have done shit
that matters

370
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:10,492
and I'd just kind of like
a job where I matter again.

371
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:12,625
So thank you,
but no thank you, OK?

372
00:24:12,668 --> 00:24:15,802
You know what I think?You want the job after this job.

373
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:19,719
But, son, this is the job
that's standing in your way.

374
00:24:19,762 --> 00:24:22,722
And that's why you're gonna be
so very, very good at it.

375
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:25,812
'Cause when I look at you,
I see a younger me.

376
00:24:43,743 --> 00:24:49,488
[man on PA] All arriving
Autobots... training and
debriefing in 15 minutes.

377
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:54,623
Dino, report to bay 23.

378
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:58,540
Sideswipe, bay 37
for weapons assessment.

379
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:04,415
Senator, I suggest you rememberthat when the NSA wants
funding, they call me.

380
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:09,072
When the CIA's gonna take
out a target, they ask
first for my permission.

381
00:25:09,116 --> 00:25:11,553
And when the president wants toknow which members of Congress

382
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:13,990
are politically vulnerable
in terms of, oh, let's say,

383
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:17,777
undiscovered criminal conduct,
I'm the number he dials.

384
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,736
[man on TV] U.S. agencies say
they've been monitoring the
blast.

385
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,566
But if, in fact, this
was a covert military
strike no nation has...

386
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,134
CIA is up my ass about thismystery raid in the Middle East.

387
00:25:27,177 --> 00:25:30,093
So it's time to come clean.
Was your unit involved?

388
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:31,921
Uh, I'm not sure, ma'am.

389
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:35,969
All right, guys, this is how youdo a Decepticon head kill shot.

390
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,972
As Director of National
Intelligence,

391
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:40,887
I'm a really big fan
of intelligent answers.

392
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,758
I can't really
tell you definitively.

393
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:44,325
These Autobots, they're
like teenage kids.

394
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:46,588
They like to sneak out ofthe house every once in a while.

395
00:25:46,632 --> 00:25:48,808
Colonel Lennox, are you
in command or are you not?

396
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:50,113
- Yes, ma'am, I am...
- Stop with the "ma'am."

397
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:52,725
Enough with the "ma'am!"
Do I look like a ma'am?

398
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:54,857
No, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Yes.

399
00:25:54,901 --> 00:25:57,817
This gun is me perfect
invention, Ironhide.

400
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,471
- Right.
- Oh, good, you're here.

401
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:03,170
Me name's Que. I do hope
you have answers for him.

402
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:04,650
I've never
seen him so upset.

403
00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:06,826
Optimus, you remember
Charlotte Mearing?

404
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:09,306
Our Director
of National Intelligence?

405
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,221
He's in a bad mood.

406
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:13,963
He's not talkin'
to anybody today.

407
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:16,662
What is this?
The silent treatment?

408
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:18,446
We've seen that
and this is not that.

409
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:20,970
- Definitely not.
- This is worse.

410
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:24,887
Prime! Make something
of yourself!

411
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:26,802
He's pissed.

412
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:35,811
You lied to us. Everything
humans know of our planet

413
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:37,857
we were told had
all been shared.

414
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,729
So why was this found
in human possession?

415
00:26:40,773 --> 00:26:42,644
We were in the dark
on this also.

416
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:46,082
It was "Director Only" clearanceat Sector Seven until now.

417
00:26:46,126 --> 00:26:48,345
- The bag.
- Which bag?

418
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:51,348
Hermes Birkin. Green ostrich!

419
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:53,873
My God.

420
00:26:54,874 --> 00:26:56,832
This is a secret
few men knew.

421
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:58,921
And fewer still
remain alive.

422
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:00,662
Allow me to please
introduce to you

423
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:03,230
two of NASA's founding
mission directors,

424
00:27:03,273 --> 00:27:05,188
and astronaut, Dr. Buzz Aldrin,

425
00:27:05,232 --> 00:27:08,104
one of the first two men
to step foot on the moon.

426
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:12,065
Sir? Optimus Prime.

427
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:16,373
And from a fellow space
traveler, it's a true honor.

428
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:17,940
The honor is mine.

429
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:21,291
Our entire space race
of the 1960s, it appears,

430
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:23,337
was in response to an event.

431
00:27:24,904 --> 00:27:28,690
Our astronauts investigated
a crashed alien ship.

432
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:30,300
No survivors onboard.

433
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:33,826
We were sworn to secrecy
by our Commander in Chief.

434
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:37,438
This was a mission
you will never speak of.

435
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:42,878
- I understand, sir.
- A total of 35 people
knew the real plan at NASA.

436
00:27:42,922 --> 00:27:46,708
Soviets managed
to land unmanned probes.

437
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:49,406
Somehow, they must have
picked up that fuel rod.

438
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:53,889
We believe the Russians
deduced that the rod was a
fissionable fuel assembly,

439
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:57,371
believed they had it mastered,
and tried to harness it
at Chernobyl.

440
00:27:57,414 --> 00:27:59,721
We landed six missions in all.

441
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:02,419
We took hundreds
of photos and samples.

442
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:04,465
We locked them away forever.

443
00:28:04,508 --> 00:28:06,075
And the moon program
was shut down.

444
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:08,774
Well, did you search
the crash vault?

445
00:28:11,428 --> 00:28:13,909
The ship's name was the Ark.

446
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:17,304
I watched it escape
Cybertron myself.

447
00:28:17,347 --> 00:28:21,743
It was carrying an Autobot
technology which would have
won us the war...

448
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:25,791
- ...and its captain.
- Who was its captain?

449
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:29,838
The great Sentinel Prime,
the technology's inventor.

450
00:28:29,882 --> 00:28:33,929
He was commander
of the Autobots before me.

451
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:35,539
It's imperative that I find it

452
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:38,368
before the Decepticons
learn of its location.

453
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:42,546
Our Autobot spacecraft
has the ability to get there.

454
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:46,768
And... you must pray
it's in time.

455
00:28:46,812 --> 00:28:50,598
♪ Forty-five light years
from home ♪

456
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:52,774

457
00:28:52,818 --> 00:28:56,430

458
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:02,088
Hi, I'm here
to see Carly Spencer.

459
00:29:02,697 --> 00:29:04,394
[growling]

460
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:07,920
[Sam whispering] Carly!

461
00:29:07,963 --> 00:29:10,009
[Carly] Sorry, excuse me.

462
00:29:12,054 --> 00:29:14,927
- You got the job?
You really got it?
- This is crazy.

463
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,494
- Yes.
- See? What did I tell you?
It's the bunny.

464
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:20,019
[laughs] You are so welcome.

465
00:29:20,062 --> 00:29:22,325
- Do you like me more?
- A little bit, yeah.

466
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:25,981
You said you were his assistantcurator. You didn't say the guyowns Space Mountain.

467
00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:27,026
I know. Isn't it
beautiful in here?

468
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:29,680
And he's the coolest guy. Ever.

469
00:29:29,724 --> 00:29:31,030
- [Sam] Yeah?
- [Carly] Yeah.

470
00:29:31,073 --> 00:29:32,945
Sam.

471
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:35,382
Dylan Gould.

472
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:38,733
Hey. Pleasure to meet you.

473
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,518
Pleasure meeting you.Carly's told me a lot about you.

474
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:43,912
Well, vice versa. It's a...
beautiful building you got.

475
00:29:43,956 --> 00:29:45,696
It's like the Starship
Enterprisein here.

476
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,742
[chuckles] Thank you very much.It leaks.

477
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,832
Before Carly came
to help run the collection,
it was just a complete mess.

478
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:54,401
But now the restorations
are back on track, we're going
to Pebble Beach this year

479
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:56,620
and we're gonna get a trophy
for that stand right there.

480
00:29:56,664 --> 00:30:01,190
You know why? Because
this woman right here
is my secret weapon.

481
00:30:01,234 --> 00:30:04,063
[laughs] Mister Gould,
please, you exaggerate.

482
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:05,499
All I've done
is get you organized.

483
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:09,546
Oh, you have done much more
than that, my Duchess.

484
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,722
- Nicknames, that's fun.
- Yeah.

485
00:30:11,766 --> 00:30:14,029
- The Duchess. Hm.
- She's adorable.

486
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:16,597
You know, when I stole her
away from the British Embassy,

487
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,033
I said, "It's easy
to manage a country.

488
00:30:18,077 --> 00:30:20,296
Try managing a priceless
collection of art."

489
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:25,388
Take a look at this
1939 Delahaye 165 Cabriolet.

490
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:28,565
Designed by a Frenchman.
Look at the curves.

491
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:31,307
Elegant, isn't it? Beautiful.

492
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,744
Sensual.

493
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:36,225
Built to evoke the body
of the ideal woman.

494
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,404
Come on. My dad had a ten-dollardesk and a dream,

495
00:30:41,448 --> 00:30:42,884
and he built it into an empire.

00:41:08,553 --> 00:41:10,685
I'm gonna hit you
right back, son.

660
00:41:10,729 --> 00:41:13,688
Here's my manifesto.
They're whackin' us out.

661
00:41:13,732 --> 00:41:14,994
Everyone who knows
what's on the dark...

662
00:41:15,037 --> 00:41:16,648
- [door opens]
- [Brazos] I get it, I get it.

663
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:19,041
Your alien friends are indanger, you know, the good ones.

664
00:41:19,085 --> 00:41:20,390
It's up to you.

665
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:22,436
- [stall rattling]
- [Sam] Calm down. Ow!

666
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,830
[Wang] Easy, Sam!

667
00:41:30,183 --> 00:41:32,011
[zips pants]

668
00:41:33,229 --> 00:41:35,231
What are you lookin' at?

669
00:41:35,275 --> 00:41:38,974
Yo, dawg.
Are you up in my shit?!

670
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:44,066
Who you workin' for?
Staredown, you and me.

671
00:41:45,415 --> 00:41:47,722
Guess I won.

672
00:41:50,812 --> 00:41:52,118
Moon satellites.

673
00:41:53,728 --> 00:41:55,861
The Russian space program.

674
00:41:55,904 --> 00:41:57,471
Experts dead.

675
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,430
Space program ends.
Dark... dark side.

676
00:42:00,474 --> 00:42:02,084
Dark side of the moon.

677
00:42:02,128 --> 00:42:04,434
Look what I found outside the
bathroom, huh? Is it yours?

678
00:42:04,478 --> 00:42:07,612
- Deal with this.
- Yes, sir.

679
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:11,398
I did everything you want!

680
00:42:11,441 --> 00:42:13,574
I really think we should talk,
'cause some of this stuff...

681
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:15,097
Whoa! Knock first!

682
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:18,405
Can't you see I'm busy?
Who are you? Who are you?

683
00:42:18,448 --> 00:42:20,755
You straddled me in the stall.

684
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:23,715
That's happened to me once inthis life. I wouldn't forget it.

685
00:42:23,758 --> 00:42:26,761
In the bathroom stall.
You took your package out.

686
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:30,373
Whoa! Whoa!
We are not boyfriends, OK?

687
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:32,506
One phone call from me
and I'll have you fired!

688
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,855
Oh, yes I will, Gaylord!

689
00:42:33,899 --> 00:42:36,728
- [Wang screeches]
- Are you OK?

690
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,773
Hemorrhoid!

691
00:42:38,817 --> 00:42:40,645
Should I come back...?
When should I come back?

692
00:42:40,688 --> 00:42:42,777
Come back when you
learn some manners!

693
00:42:44,387 --> 00:42:49,262
[cries out] I don't know him!
I would never say anything!

694
00:42:51,351 --> 00:42:55,747
Whoa... OK, OK! I sabotaged
the mapping satellite,
just like I promised.

695
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:58,010
I even put a blind spot
in the program as a bonus!

696
00:42:58,053 --> 00:43:03,406
- What more do you want from me?- Jerry, you are my favorite.

697
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,321
I'll do whatever
you want me to do.

698
00:43:05,365 --> 00:43:08,890
I know, but my superiors
need me to...

699
00:43:08,934 --> 00:43:12,938
- Please. You don't
have to do this!
- ...suicide you.

700
00:43:13,852 --> 00:43:17,812
What did you say
to Witwicky?

701
00:43:17,856 --> 00:43:19,771
Oh, shit!

702
00:43:20,902 --> 00:43:23,862
Huh? Who wants some chicken
dinner, now, bitch?!

703
00:43:23,905 --> 00:43:27,779
'Cause somebody messed
with the wrong Wang today!

704
00:43:28,562 --> 00:43:30,695
Come on! You want some of me?!

705
00:43:30,738 --> 00:43:32,348
[grunts]

706
00:43:32,392 --> 00:43:34,742
Oh, no, no, no...!

707
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,447
I don't need any more
didactic lectures from Chuck.

708
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:46,580
- [screaming]
- Jesus!

709
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:50,758
- [car alarm blaring]
- [panting]

710
00:43:52,151 --> 00:43:54,109
Get legal.

711
00:43:55,241 --> 00:43:56,546
That's Jerry!

712
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:59,027
Come on, people,
yes, a workmate died,

713
00:43:59,071 --> 00:44:01,203
but looking out the window
is not gonna bring him back.

714
00:44:01,247 --> 00:44:03,684
- The man was depressed.
- Don't take a picture!

715
00:44:03,728 --> 00:44:07,601
You can keep watching him, but
he's not getting up. You all
read Humpty Dumpty.

716
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,560
OK? Witwicky...

717
00:44:10,604 --> 00:44:12,911
I'm spearheading the press.
You clean up.

718
00:44:12,954 --> 00:44:16,871
Wang is everywhere.
He is in the bistro.

719
00:44:16,915 --> 00:44:19,221
He's in the bamboo.
He's on the balustrade.

720
00:44:19,265 --> 00:44:22,181
You see the sidewalk down there?[laughing] Man!

721
00:44:22,224 --> 00:44:25,358
Box up his personals. Get his
name off his parking space.

722
00:44:25,401 --> 00:44:27,882
- One more thing...
- [Donny] Hey, when did we
get a new copier?

723
00:44:27,926 --> 00:44:29,492
I'm not gonna say anything
about what I saw.

724
00:44:29,536 --> 00:44:32,844
Who you share a toilet stall
with is totally your business.

725
00:44:32,887 --> 00:44:36,848
This is exceedingly Japanese.

726
00:44:38,545 --> 00:44:41,853
They never make it
easy, do they?

727
00:44:43,506 --> 00:44:45,334
[screams]

728
00:44:55,127 --> 00:44:57,695
[shrieks]

729
00:45:01,307 --> 00:45:03,178
[all screaming]

730
00:45:14,059 --> 00:45:15,930
[gasping]

731
00:45:17,758 --> 00:45:20,456
- [Carly] What is with you?
- [Sam] This is
the real deal, Carly.

732
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,808
I need you to stay composed.
It's real life. I'll explain
it to you later.

733
00:45:27,812 --> 00:45:29,988
We got an emergency. You gotta
get Colonel Lennox out here.

734
00:45:30,031 --> 00:45:32,468
The Decepticons are back.
You gotta open that gate.

735
00:45:32,512 --> 00:45:36,472
- Easy, sir, this is Health
and Human Services.
- Right, packing M4's?

736
00:45:36,516 --> 00:45:39,475
What are you protecting,
colostomy bags? Bed pans?
Throat lozenges?

737
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:43,305
Where'd you get that hat from,
nursing school? You're nurses
and foot-powder protectors?

738
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:46,134
- I don't think we're
in the right place.
- We are in the right place.

739
00:45:46,178 --> 00:45:48,310
We are in the right place
and I'm gonna talk to Optimus.

740
00:45:48,354 --> 00:45:51,313
Sir, you got the wrong
building. I don't know
what you're talking about.

741
00:45:51,357 --> 00:45:53,838
What part of "the Decepticonsare back" do you not understand?

742
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:56,144
Yo! You being a smartass?

743
00:45:56,188 --> 00:45:59,321
[screaming] Do not hit my car!
It's a collector's item!

744
00:45:59,365 --> 00:46:02,237
- I wouldn't do that.
- [Carly] You're crazy!

745
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:04,196
[both yelling]

746
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:05,980
We got an Energon reading!

747
00:46:06,024 --> 00:46:07,634
- Got aliens in the vehicle!
- Whoa!!

748
00:46:07,677 --> 00:46:10,376
You move, you're dead! Out! Out!

749
00:46:10,419 --> 00:46:12,987
Got aliens in the vehicle!

750
00:46:13,031 --> 00:46:15,990
- Freeze!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
We're freezin'!

751
00:46:16,034 --> 00:46:19,428
Are you...
Are you kidding me?!

752
00:46:19,472 --> 00:46:21,474
[Carly] Sam, they've got guns!

753
00:46:22,954 --> 00:46:25,826
- I got him.
- Bee! Is Bee in there?!

754
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:28,742
[shouting] OK, all right!

755
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,092
This how you treat Autobots?
We're on the same team.

756
00:46:31,136 --> 00:46:34,356
Yeah, enjoy your next job
at 7-Eleven, dickhead.

757
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,880
- That's right.
- A-hole.

758
00:46:35,923 --> 00:46:38,230
How's your car now?

759
00:46:47,065 --> 00:46:50,764
That's my car.
Come here.

760
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:53,375
- Come here!
- Come on. Sam.

761
00:46:53,419 --> 00:46:56,944
What is your deal, huh?
I know your black ops stuff
is important.

762
00:46:56,988 --> 00:46:59,251
I'm not trying to diminish it
or, you know, guilt-trip you,

763
00:46:59,294 --> 00:47:03,037
I just never see you anymore.
You can't come to the garage
and just hang out one night?

764
00:47:03,081 --> 00:47:05,257
Sam. That makes me
feel bad.

765
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,215
I hope you feel bad.
You should feel bad.

766
00:47:07,259 --> 00:47:09,870
Look at the jalopy I'm
driving now. I feel bad
every single day.

767
00:47:09,914 --> 00:47:12,481
Yo, let's go, both of you.
Lennox wants to see you.

768
00:47:12,525 --> 00:47:14,005
We not good enough
for you anymore?

769
00:47:14,048 --> 00:47:17,182
I'm sorry, babe.They were very rude, all right?

770
00:47:17,225 --> 00:47:20,228
You're fixing my car.
You don't think so?

771
00:47:20,272 --> 00:47:23,231
Raise your hand if you had
a flying psycho-ninja copier
try to kill you today!

772
00:47:23,275 --> 00:47:25,233
- [detector beeping]
- Those are my brass knuckles.

773
00:47:25,277 --> 00:47:27,540
That's my anklet. Do I
have to take that off, too?

774
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:30,195
- And my toe rings?
- [man on PA] All NEST
officials clear the floor.

775
00:47:30,238 --> 00:47:32,110
We have ten minutes
until attempted contact.

776
00:47:32,153 --> 00:47:34,242
[Mearing] We've taken possessionof the five devices

777
00:47:34,286 --> 00:47:37,071
that were hidden in the ship
with Sentinel Prime.

778
00:47:37,115 --> 00:47:40,335
They're some kind of prototype
Autobot technology.

779
00:47:40,379 --> 00:47:43,425
They say Sentinel was the
Einstein of his civilization,

780
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:46,907
so we're gonna keep these
locked up until we know
what we're dealing with.

781
00:47:46,951 --> 00:47:49,388
Right now, no one gets access.

782
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:52,565
- No one.- [Sam] This Wang guy recognizedme. He told me to warn you.

783
00:47:52,608 --> 00:47:55,263
He was talking about
the dark side of the moon,
then they killed him.

784
00:47:55,307 --> 00:47:58,310
- Wait a minute,
he mentioned the moon?
- Yeah, dark side of the moon.

785
00:47:58,353 --> 00:48:00,616
But why would Decepticons
want to kill humans?

786
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,618
I thought their
war was with the Autobots.

787
00:48:02,662 --> 00:48:06,753
And that is when he made
his first quick-look science
report. That's...

788
00:48:06,796 --> 00:48:10,061
Who's the chick?
OK, excuse me! Colonel Lennox?

789
00:48:10,104 --> 00:48:12,715
Director Mearing,
this is Sam Witwicky...

790
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:15,631
I know his name, colonel. I wantto know who gave him clearance?

791
00:48:15,675 --> 00:48:19,113
How about Optimus Prime,
when he touched down in
suburbia looking for my house?

792
00:48:19,157 --> 00:48:23,117
This is the National
Intelligence Director.
In case you...

793
00:48:23,161 --> 00:48:25,337
- Hi.
- Disrespecting
a federal officer?

794
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,513
Huh. Maybe that'll get
you somewhere. Who's she?

795
00:48:27,556 --> 00:48:30,342
- She's my girlfriend.
- What is this, like a date?

796
00:48:30,385 --> 00:48:33,171
She knows all about the
Autobots, OK? She knows
Bumblebee.

797
00:48:33,214 --> 00:48:35,608
She comes from a military
family. I can vouch for her.

798
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:38,480
Hey, I have an idea.
How about we get back
to the important topics,

799
00:48:38,524 --> 00:48:40,787
like the fact that I almost hadmy face cut off by a Decepticon?

800
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:43,355
As a taxpayer, I'd like
to lodge a complaint,
as a matter of fact.

801
00:48:43,398 --> 00:48:47,098
OK, listen, one of the
software engineers in Sam's
office was murdered today.

802
00:48:47,141 --> 00:48:48,969
He was involved in NASA's
lunar mapping probe.

803
00:48:49,013 --> 00:48:51,058
Here's the thing,
Colonel Lennox.

804
00:48:51,102 --> 00:48:54,366
We cannot entrust national
security to teenagers,

805
00:48:54,409 --> 00:48:57,630
unless I missed a policy paper.Are we doing that now?

806
00:48:57,673 --> 00:49:00,633
No. Good.
I don't care who you are.

807
00:49:00,676 --> 00:49:04,506
If you breathe a word of what
you see in here, you will do
time for treason.

808
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:06,247
Do you understand me?

809
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:08,684
I'll take my orders
from the Autobots.
I know them.

810
00:49:08,728 --> 00:49:12,166
- I don't know you.
- You will.

811
00:49:13,124 --> 00:49:14,995
[Lennox] Sentinel Prime.

812
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:17,171
These things run on Energon,
and he's out of it.

813
00:49:17,215 --> 00:49:19,826
He's in a...
sort of a sleep mode.

814
00:49:19,869 --> 00:49:22,046
[Optimus] Let us begin.

815
00:49:30,271 --> 00:49:33,187
That's the great
Matrix of Leadership.

816
00:49:33,231 --> 00:49:35,233
He holds the only thing
in the universe

817
00:49:35,276 --> 00:49:37,670
that can repower a
Transformer's spark.

818
00:49:37,713 --> 00:49:40,673
This is incredible.

819
00:49:40,716 --> 00:49:43,154
Sentinel Prime...

820
00:49:43,893 --> 00:49:46,374
...we bid you return.

821
00:49:55,644 --> 00:49:57,211
Hold your fire!

822
00:49:57,255 --> 00:50:00,084
Stop! Sentinel!

823
00:50:00,127 --> 00:50:02,782
It is I, Optimus Prime!

824
00:50:02,825 --> 00:50:06,568
It is all right. You are safe.

825
00:50:06,612 --> 00:50:09,093
There is nothing to fear.

826
00:50:09,963 --> 00:50:12,748
We are here.

827
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:15,273
You are home, Sentinel.

828
00:50:19,973 --> 00:50:22,715
The war... the war!

829
00:50:22,758 --> 00:50:24,760
The war was lost.

830
00:50:24,804 --> 00:50:28,199
Cybertron is now
but a barren wasteland.

831
00:50:28,242 --> 00:50:31,680
We have taken refuge here
on Planet Earth.

832
00:50:31,724 --> 00:50:33,987
Its human race is our ally.

833
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:37,295
My ship! We came under fire!

834
00:50:37,338 --> 00:50:40,341
The pillars.
Where are the pillars?

835
00:50:40,385 --> 00:50:44,432
You saved five of them,
including the control pillar.

836
00:50:44,476 --> 00:50:48,436
Only five?!
We once had hundreds!

837
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,830
Excuse me, gentlemen,
may I ask...

838
00:50:50,873 --> 00:50:52,875
What is this technology
you're looking for?

839
00:50:52,919 --> 00:50:55,835
It is the ability
to reshape the universe.

840
00:50:55,878 --> 00:50:58,403
Together the pillars
form a space bridge.

841
00:50:58,446 --> 00:51:01,971
I designed and,
I alone, can control it.

842
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:06,889
It defies your laws
of physics to transport
matter through time and space.

843
00:51:06,933 --> 00:51:10,110
You're talking about
a teleportation device,
aren't you?

844
00:51:10,154 --> 00:51:13,113
Yes, for resources,
for refugees.

845
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:16,769
Refugees, or troops of soldiers,weapons, maybe bombs!

846
00:51:16,812 --> 00:51:19,859
A means of an instant strike!
That's its military function,
isn't it?

847
00:51:19,902 --> 00:51:24,168
It is our technology
and it must be returned.

848
00:51:24,211 --> 00:51:26,431
Yes, if humans say so.

849
00:51:26,474 --> 00:51:30,130
You can't just bring weapons
of mass destruction
into our atmosphere!

850
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:33,873
You kinda have to clear
Customs first! A little
formality called "paperwork."

851
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:35,831
Kinda separates us
from the animals.

852
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:39,705
I will overlook your
condescending tone

853
00:51:39,748 --> 00:51:42,142
if you heed
the gravity of mine.

854
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:45,189
The Decepticons must never knowthe space bridge is here.

855
00:51:45,232 --> 00:51:48,496
For in their hands,
it would mean

856
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:51,543
the end of your world.

857
00:51:51,586 --> 00:51:55,851
"Total Nightmare" file.
So the investigation is open.

858
00:51:55,895 --> 00:51:58,158
We've sent agents to youroffice. And for the time being,

859
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:00,639
we're gonna send you home
with Autobot protection.

860
00:52:00,682 --> 00:52:03,990
Who do I need to speak to
to get you guys to understand
that I can help?

861
00:52:04,033 --> 00:52:05,818
- That I can contribute?
- Hey, we can all help.

862
00:52:05,861 --> 00:52:08,560
Want me to tell you what
I know? I could tell you
about the solar system,

863
00:52:08,603 --> 00:52:10,866
- all the fun planets
to hang out in.
- Get off my desk, please.

864
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:13,304
You pulling out guns? I can't
help you out now. She angry.

865
00:52:13,347 --> 00:52:15,436
- Oh, my God.
- What do you envision for me?

866
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,786
I go home now? I go back
to work? I make copies?

867
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:21,877
This is a unit for veteran
intelligence officers
and Special Forces,

868
00:52:21,921 --> 00:52:24,315
not for boys who
once owned special cars.

869
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:26,360
That's a bit harsh,
isn't it, ma'am?

870
00:52:26,404 --> 00:52:27,840
Don't call me ma'am.
I'm not a ma'am.

871
00:52:27,883 --> 00:52:29,537
You're a woman,
aren't you?

872
00:52:29,581 --> 00:52:31,496
[clearing throat] So...

873
00:52:31,539 --> 00:52:34,586
- ...are those yours?
- Yeah. CIA.

874
00:52:34,629 --> 00:52:38,111
I only ask 'cause I also have
a medal, from the president.

875
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,940
Yeah. Great. So it's
not complicated, right?

876
00:52:40,983 --> 00:52:43,899
No one gets to work
with the Autobots
unless I approve it.

877
00:52:43,943 --> 00:52:46,380
You're breaking
my chain of command.

878
00:52:47,555 --> 00:52:50,471
Come on, let's go.
You've done what you came for.

879
00:52:50,515 --> 00:52:53,431
With all due respect, youngman, I appreciate what you did.

880
00:52:53,474 --> 00:52:55,302
But you're not a soldier.
You're a messenger.

881
00:52:55,346 --> 00:52:59,437
- You've always
been a messenger.
- He's a hero.

882
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:07,706
Bee, you take the freightelevator, I'll see you up there.

883
00:53:11,971 --> 00:53:15,453
[Wheelie] Ah. this blows. That
lady officially kicked us out.

884
00:53:15,496 --> 00:53:17,890
Yeah. Witness Protection
Program sucks.

885
00:53:17,933 --> 00:53:21,328
Yeah, but we're a whole
lot safer with Big Yellow
and his cannons.

886
00:53:21,372 --> 00:53:24,244
'Cause that dog
can't protect crap.

887
00:53:24,853 --> 00:53:26,812
[Sam] Bee?

888
00:53:31,338 --> 00:53:34,559
You miss hanging out?

889
00:53:34,602 --> 00:53:36,343
Yeah, me, too.

890
00:53:40,565 --> 00:53:43,307
That woman called me
a messenger. Can you
believe that?

891
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:45,047
After everything I've done,
I'm a messenger.

892
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:48,094
Oh, I believe it. I tell you,
Sammy, we feel the same way.

893
00:53:48,137 --> 00:53:50,966
The disrespect
on this rock is criminal.

894
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:53,404
We should do something about it.

895
00:53:54,013 --> 00:53:56,189
Bee...

896
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,017
...I need to know why
they're killing humans.

897
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:00,280
I say we call in the expert.

898
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:02,804
[man] My next guest is a former intelligence operative

899
00:54:02,848 --> 00:54:06,982
who has dared to speak out
regarding our alleged
military alliance

900
00:54:07,026 --> 00:54:11,987
with what many describe as
a group of extraterrestrial
mercenaries.

901
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:16,644
He is the author
of the bestselling book,
Code-Name Hero.

902
00:54:16,688 --> 00:54:18,994
Former special agent,
Seymour Simmons.

903
00:54:19,038 --> 00:54:21,345
Bill. Big fan. Great to be here.

904
00:54:21,388 --> 00:54:23,477
Agent Simmons, you would
have us believe

905
00:54:23,521 --> 00:54:25,305
that it is in our best interest

906
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:28,482
to formally take sides in this so-called alien civil war?

907
00:54:28,526 --> 00:54:34,488
Well, the other side wanted
to spank us for breakfast,so I wouldn't call it a toss-up.

908
00:54:34,532 --> 00:54:35,924
These Decepticons are lethal.

909
00:54:35,968 --> 00:54:38,666
But polls show half
the world would feel safer

910
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,407
with the
Autobots completely gone.

911
00:54:40,451 --> 00:54:42,844
Get them out of here!
We don't need them!

912
00:54:42,888 --> 00:54:45,543
I feel safer when I sleep
with a hand grenade.

913
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:46,979
Doesn't mean
I'm always right.

914
00:54:47,022 --> 00:54:48,676
Now, agent, here
atThe Factor,

915
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,332
we have obtained documents
that show you were fired...

916
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:54,334
- Chaz, I'm doing an interview.- Sorry, Mr. Simmons.

917
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:56,510
Downsized, Bill. Budget cuts.

918
00:54:56,554 --> 00:54:57,859
Chaz, out.

919
00:54:57,903 --> 00:55:00,035
...report "severe
delusional tendencies."

920
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:03,343
This is ambush journalism.
You want the truth about
the alien alliance?

921
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:07,216
Buy my book! Buy my book,
before it's too late, people!

922
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:11,046
You want a piece of me, Bill?
You want to get naked? I'm
ready! Interviewis over!

923
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:12,526
You sound like
a pinhead, agent.

924
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:15,616
I got a suggestion for you:
Damage control.

925
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,966
- Dutch!
- You have upset Mr. Simmons!

926
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:21,622
You have 23 seconds
to leave the property!
I have called the police!

927
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:24,538
You are peasants, people,
throwing rocks at a giant!

928
00:55:24,582 --> 00:55:25,931
What's up next?
What do we got?

929
00:55:25,974 --> 00:55:27,498
Book signing, midtown, noon.

930
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:29,456
Then we pitch your reality showto Discovery Channel.

931
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:33,242
Oh, and I have this...
"Vitvicky" who keeps
calling me five times today.

932
00:55:33,286 --> 00:55:36,376
- Kid? What does he want?
- I called you because the
Decepticons are back.

933
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,597
- I want to know why
and need your help.
- They're back?

934
00:55:40,511 --> 00:55:41,947
Well, that's good for business.

935
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:43,949
What if I told you I know
a 50-year-old alien secret

936
00:55:43,992 --> 00:55:48,257
- that nobody ever told you?
- Do not tempt my addiction.

937
00:55:48,301 --> 00:55:50,695
I have gone
through withdrawal, kid

938
00:55:50,738 --> 00:55:54,046
- Dutch, is this line secure?
- No.

939
00:55:56,178 --> 00:55:59,094
Don't take the risk.
I'm rich, why should I?

940
00:55:59,138 --> 00:56:01,923
Do not relapse. I won't.

941
00:56:01,967 --> 00:56:03,969
Do not let the demons win.

942
00:56:04,012 --> 00:56:06,450
- [beeps]
- Got it.

943
00:56:07,276 --> 00:56:10,105
What kind of... secret?

944
00:56:10,149 --> 00:56:12,717
Apollo. Moon. Aliens. Cover-up.

945
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,197
Future tech. Assassinations.
That kind of stuff.

946
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:17,896
Oh, Apollo.

947
00:56:18,636 --> 00:56:20,681
Dutch!

948
00:56:25,991 --> 00:56:29,951
Tell Megatron, "Let's tango."

949
00:56:39,918 --> 00:56:43,617
So majestic and peaceful,
this planet.

950
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:47,099
Unlike the final days
of Cybertron.

951
00:56:47,142 --> 00:56:49,884
I've wondered what
might have been...

952
00:56:49,928 --> 00:56:54,280
...if you had foughtthe final battle, instead of me.

953
00:56:54,323 --> 00:56:57,065
Never mourn the past,
young warrior.

954
00:56:57,109 --> 00:57:02,723
Thanks to you,
our race survives.

955
00:57:02,767 --> 00:57:05,465
You were our
leader, Sentinel.

956
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:08,468
It is your right
to lead us again.

957
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:10,949
In a world I do not know...

958
00:57:10,992 --> 00:57:14,039
...I am no longer
your teacher, Optimus.

959
00:57:14,082 --> 00:57:16,868
You are mine.

960
00:57:19,697 --> 00:57:22,700
We've got to break
this case down.

961
00:57:22,743 --> 00:57:24,397
What we have here is
an astronaut epidemic.

962
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,268
MIA. Dead.
Died in a car accident.

963
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:29,010
Killed. DOA. Car death.
It's like these guys
can't drive.

964
00:57:29,054 --> 00:57:31,143
They can fly into outer space,
but they can't drive a car.

965
00:57:31,186 --> 00:57:35,756
- Procured your
information, Witwicky.
- Thank you, Bruce.

966
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,063
Now...

967
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,414
You let me see one
right now. One time.

968
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,590
- Quick.
- Very.

969
00:57:49,248 --> 00:57:50,989
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.

970
00:57:51,032 --> 00:57:53,513
Says NASA launched it in 2009.

971
00:57:53,557 --> 00:57:55,689
Forensics show Wang may
have messed with the code,

972
00:57:55,733 --> 00:57:59,171
preventing it from mapping
the far side of the moon,
which is also the dark side.

973
00:57:59,214 --> 00:58:00,738
Fuckin' awesome.

974
00:58:00,781 --> 00:58:02,348
They infiltrate us,
intimidate us,

975
00:58:02,391 --> 00:58:05,569
coerce us to do their dirty
work. And once they're done...

976
00:58:05,612 --> 00:58:08,876
Doosh! ...double-tap
to the cerebellum.

977
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,139
So humans are working
for the Decepticons.

978
00:58:11,183 --> 00:58:14,447
I don't think this is about
the Decepticons looking

979
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,667
for something on the moon.

980
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:20,932
I think it's about something
they wanted to hide.

981
00:58:20,975 --> 00:58:23,891
Come to Daddy.

982
00:58:23,935 --> 00:58:26,807
Come on, throw down.

983
00:58:26,851 --> 00:58:29,201
Did you eat a lot of paint chipswhen you were a kid?

984
00:58:29,244 --> 00:58:31,899
- He's a freak.
- Ha! Like it?

985
00:58:31,943 --> 00:58:38,732
[grunts, laughing]
I'm ticklish!

986
00:58:38,776 --> 00:58:42,736
Sir! We are having a
pretty high-level alien
intel confab here,

987
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:46,435
that I don't think you're
cleared for, errand boy.

988
00:58:46,479 --> 00:58:48,568
Yeah, you're right.
It's a bitchin' robot.

989
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:50,135
[Sam] I think it's
time to go, Bruce.

990
00:58:50,178 --> 00:58:51,484
Thank you so much for this.

991
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,704
Got to go, Bruce.

992
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:56,358
Hey, I'm smokin' over here.

993
00:58:56,402 --> 00:58:58,143
Downloading missing
Russian cosmonauts.

994
00:58:58,186 --> 00:59:01,276
Turns out, the Soviets cancelleda manned mission to the moon.

995
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,930
The moon! In 1972.

996
00:59:02,974 --> 00:59:05,280
Then two of the cosmonauts
went into hiding in America.

997
00:59:05,324 --> 00:59:07,761
And I just found them alive.

998
00:59:07,805 --> 00:59:09,589
[Wheelie] You're a genius,
Brains.

999
00:59:09,633 --> 00:59:13,593
- [gasps]
- [Sam] Whoa!

1000
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:16,117
[Brains] Oh, that was
smooth, Bumblebee.

1001
00:59:19,512 --> 00:59:21,558
Missed it by that much.

1002
00:59:23,429 --> 00:59:27,825
- Hi.
- Would somebody care to tell
me what the hell's going on?

1003
00:59:27,868 --> 00:59:30,044
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1004
00:59:30,088 --> 00:59:32,917
Who am I? Who is that?
Dutch! Frisk her!

1005
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,963
- Certainly.
- No. Dutch. Um...

1006
00:59:36,007 --> 00:59:38,966
- Don't touch me.
- I'm not gonna touch her.

1007
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:40,968
- Sam?
- Angel.

1008
00:59:41,012 --> 00:59:44,363
Uh... I was working.
I'm sorry about this.

1009
00:59:44,406 --> 00:59:47,409
- [Brains] Great,
we're homeless.
- She lives here? Wow.

1010
00:59:47,453 --> 00:59:49,063
You had your chance
to frisk her.

1011
00:59:49,107 --> 00:59:52,023
- I have a girlfriend.
- Really? What's her name?

1012
00:59:52,893 --> 00:59:54,895
India.

1013
00:59:54,939 --> 00:59:57,158
We're supposed to be
at Dylan's party, remember?

1014
00:59:57,202 --> 01:00:00,248
I do remember, but these are myfriends, they need me. I have tobe here right now.

1015
01:00:00,292 --> 01:00:03,164
The Autobots and the military,
they can't handle this
on their own?

1016
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:05,732
You know what I liked
about your war stories, Sam,

1017
01:00:05,776 --> 01:00:08,039
is that they were stories.
They were in the past.

1018
01:00:08,082 --> 01:00:11,695
Look, I know you're thinking
about your brother, and you're
thinking about your family.

1019
01:00:11,738 --> 01:00:16,351
And it's not that situation.No? Why not? Why isn't it, Sam?

1020
01:00:16,395 --> 01:00:20,007
You think we'd
rather have his medals,
or we'd rather have him?

1021
01:00:20,051 --> 01:00:22,401
I hear you. I get it.

1022
01:00:22,444 --> 01:00:25,839
Where are you
taking my bunny? Stop!
Just stop for a second.

1023
01:00:25,883 --> 01:00:30,017
You think I could sleep last
night? And then it hit me:
No, Sam wants to be in danger.

1024
01:00:30,061 --> 01:00:33,238
- He doesn't know
who he is without it.
- I just want to matter.

1025
01:00:34,065 --> 01:00:36,067
You matter to me.

1026
01:00:41,376 --> 01:00:45,119
I know you're worried, but Ipromise you, I can handle this.

1027
01:00:45,163 --> 01:00:48,906
- Can you?
You can promise it?
- I promise.

1028
01:00:50,472 --> 01:00:54,172
Sam, I don't want to lose you,
and I know where this leads.

1029
01:00:56,391 --> 01:00:58,698
I'm not ready for this.

1030
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:01,396
Are you coming with me?

1031
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,834
I can't.

1032
01:01:04,573 --> 01:01:06,750
OK.

1033
01:01:10,884 --> 01:01:12,843
Hey...

1034
01:01:16,107 --> 01:01:18,326
Here's your foot.

1035
01:01:28,554 --> 01:01:32,514
The warrior's path
is a solitary one.

1036
01:01:32,558 --> 01:01:34,516
How the hell did
she afford that car?

1037
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,736
- Her boss.
- Rich bastards!

1038
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:39,783
I used to hate 'em.
Now, it's...

1039
01:01:41,349 --> 01:01:44,439
[Seymour] Goin' to a gig on ahunt for two Russian cosmonauts.

1040
01:01:44,483 --> 01:01:46,746
Nothin' like drivin'
in a Maybach, huh?

1041
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:49,314
Germans know how to make cars,
let me tell ya.

1042
01:01:50,315 --> 01:01:52,360
My Dutchman, former NSA,

1043
01:01:52,404 --> 01:01:56,321
cybersleuth extraordinaire,
tracked 'em down here.

1044
01:01:57,626 --> 01:02:00,281
So these cosmonauts went
into hiding. Why?

1045
01:02:00,325 --> 01:02:02,675
Bingo. I got a match.

1046
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,764
You're a German Shepherd, Dutch.

1047
01:02:04,808 --> 01:02:07,811
The thing about Russians
is, they never like to talk.

1048
01:02:07,854 --> 01:02:11,162
Gonna take a little of the
"international language."

1049
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:18,082
- [speaking Russian]
- That means "goodbye."

1050
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:20,998
[whispers] Watch this.

1051
01:02:23,043 --> 01:02:24,697
[speaking Russian]

1052
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:28,919
[♪ Seryoga: "Discomalaria"]

1053
01:02:32,183 --> 01:02:34,402
[Seymour] Stay loose.

1054
01:02:34,446 --> 01:02:37,275
Dutch. Give me somethin' tough.

1055
01:02:38,189 --> 01:02:40,800
Uh... Baryshnikov.

1056
01:02:40,844 --> 01:02:44,238
- We do speak English.
- Dutch, you suck.

1057
01:02:44,282 --> 01:02:47,024
It's a Cyrillic alphabet!

1058
01:02:47,067 --> 01:02:51,028
It's like all the buttonsyou never push on a calculator!

1059
01:02:51,071 --> 01:02:55,728
- I don't suck.
- Agent Seymour Simmons,
Sector Eight, formerly Seven.

1060
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:59,514
- We know who you are,
cosmonaut-chiks.
- So what?

1061
01:02:59,558 --> 01:03:02,822
You were supposed to travel
to the dark side of the moon.

1062
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:06,391
Then, tsk...
it all got shut down.

1063
01:03:07,566 --> 01:03:10,612
The question is... why?

1064
01:03:10,656 --> 01:03:13,354
[speaking Russian]

1065
01:03:13,398 --> 01:03:15,313
Nostrovia!

1066
01:03:15,356 --> 01:03:17,489
"Can my child smoke in here?"

1067
01:03:17,532 --> 01:03:19,143
[speaking Russian]

1068
01:03:20,753 --> 01:03:23,016
[shouting]

1069
01:03:23,974 --> 01:03:27,673
- [yelps]
- Agh, OK, all right, OK.

1070
01:03:27,716 --> 01:03:30,197
- Go ahead, shoot me.
- [speaking Russian]

1071
01:03:30,241 --> 01:03:33,026
I'm willin' to die
for my country. Are you?

1072
01:03:33,766 --> 01:03:35,333
Really?

1073
01:03:35,376 --> 01:03:37,857
You are beautiful. Has anyoneever told you you're beautiful?

1074
01:03:37,901 --> 01:03:40,164
- She's a beautiful woman.
- [woman yelling]

1075
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,472
Whoa! Hey!

1076
01:03:48,302 --> 01:03:50,130
Dutch! Back in the cage.

1077
01:03:50,174 --> 01:03:51,740
[yells]

1078
01:03:51,784 --> 01:03:53,177
Halt, Dutch! Halt!

1079
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:55,179
Control your boy, please!
Control your boy!

1080
01:03:55,222 --> 01:03:56,920
Dutch! Stop!

1081
01:03:56,963 --> 01:04:00,053
[speaking foreign language]

1082
01:04:01,707 --> 01:04:04,101
I'm so sorry.
That is the old me.

1083
01:04:04,144 --> 01:04:05,929
OK, let's everybody
just calm down!

1084
01:04:05,972 --> 01:04:08,366
Let's lower the heat,
lower the guns. Let's relax.

1085
01:04:08,409 --> 01:04:09,933
World War Two is over.

1086
01:04:12,283 --> 01:04:16,200
You are about to see one
of the biggest Soviet secrets.

1087
01:04:17,288 --> 01:04:19,899
America, first to send
man to the Moon.

1088
01:04:19,943 --> 01:04:22,467
But USSR, first to send camera.

1089
01:04:23,468 --> 01:04:26,166
In 1959, our Luna 3...

1090
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:29,996
...take picture of the dark,
the shadow side.

1091
01:04:31,128 --> 01:04:33,043
Sees nothing.

1092
01:04:33,086 --> 01:04:38,439
- But in 1963, Luna 4sees...
- Strange rocks.

1093
01:04:38,483 --> 01:04:40,224
- Yeah.
- Around the ship.

1094
01:04:40,267 --> 01:04:44,968
- Hundreds of them.
- Yeah, show picture, hm?

1095
01:04:45,011 --> 01:04:48,362
[Sam] With some... drag marks.

1096
01:04:51,496 --> 01:04:54,107
I've seen these. Thesearen't rocks. These are pillars.

1097
01:04:54,151 --> 01:04:56,501
Alien pillars
for a space bridge.

1098
01:04:56,544 --> 01:04:59,112
We know about them 'cause the
Autobots have five of these.

1099
01:04:59,156 --> 01:05:01,027
Decepticons must have
raided the ship

1100
01:05:01,071 --> 01:05:04,161
before Apollo 11ever got there,
took the pillars...

1101
01:05:04,204 --> 01:05:06,511
- ...and hid them.
- It doesn't make sense.

1102
01:05:06,554 --> 01:05:08,817
The Decepticons have the ship.
They have all those pillars.

1103
01:05:08,861 --> 01:05:12,299
Why would they leave Sentinel
when he's the only one that
can use them?

1104
01:05:12,343 --> 01:05:14,171
Unless....

1105
01:05:14,214 --> 01:05:16,390
He's the one thing
they still need.

1106
01:05:16,434 --> 01:05:19,654
We got to meet up with Sentinel.Rendezvous with him and
keep him safe.

1107
01:05:19,698 --> 01:05:21,308
Mearing, I just picked up
Sentinel.

1108
01:05:21,352 --> 01:05:25,660
Optimus is ten minutes behind.
We're comin' to NEST now.

1109
01:05:25,704 --> 01:05:29,186
Mr. Witwicky, I thought I made
it clear to you that I did not
want you calling this phone.

1110
01:05:29,229 --> 01:05:31,971
[Sam] Listen, the whole thing
has been a setup since
the beginning.

1111
01:05:32,015 --> 01:05:36,149
The Decepticons wanted Optimus
to find Sentinel because
only Optimus could revive him.

1112
01:05:36,193 --> 01:05:39,152
- But we have the space bridge.- Mearing, you have
five pillars.

1113
01:05:39,196 --> 01:05:41,415
I just learned that
they have hundreds.

1114
01:05:41,459 --> 01:05:44,505
You're doing exactly what
they wanted you to do. What
do you need me to say to you?

1115
01:05:44,549 --> 01:05:46,638
The Decepticons are coming
for Sentinel Prime!

1116
01:05:46,681 --> 01:05:48,292
We're going to NEST.

1117
01:05:52,252 --> 01:05:58,215
[man on PA] We have an Energon
alert. Energon readings
detected on the DC Parkway.

1118
01:05:58,258 --> 01:06:00,869
Currently tracking
three black Suburbans.

1119
01:06:00,913 --> 01:06:04,134
[sirens wailing]

1120
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:20,585
Whoa! [screaming]

1121
01:06:34,773 --> 01:06:37,384
Bee, you got to get Sentinel outof here! You got to guard him!

1122
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:49,048
Oh, mein Gott!I'm fired!

1123
01:06:53,226 --> 01:06:55,620
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

1124
01:07:11,723 --> 01:07:13,942
Got you!

1125
01:07:13,986 --> 01:07:16,554
Shoot him, shoot him!
Shoot him, Bee!

1126
01:07:44,234 --> 01:07:46,758
Bee, you got to move!
Faster, faster, Bee! Go!

1127
01:07:50,283 --> 01:07:52,329
Bee! Ohhh!

1128
01:07:53,504 --> 01:07:57,290
[yelling]

1129
01:08:05,429 --> 01:08:09,520
[shrieking]

1130
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,265
All right, back to NEST!

1131
01:08:21,662 --> 01:08:23,664
Dino, I got him!

1132
01:08:32,586 --> 01:08:34,197
Ironhide!

1133
01:08:44,903 --> 01:08:47,775
[roaring]

1134
01:08:56,393 --> 01:09:00,527
- Get him!
- Is there a problem?

1135
01:09:00,571 --> 01:09:03,748
Whoa. A little Mexican
standoff we got here.

1136
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:05,489
Weapons down.

1137
01:09:05,532 --> 01:09:09,362
And we'll let you escape
with your dignity.

1138
01:09:12,844 --> 01:09:14,628
Drop 'em.

1139
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,371
That's good.

1140
01:09:21,418 --> 01:09:22,593
[Sideswipe] Ironhide! Watch out!

1141
01:09:22,636 --> 01:09:24,334
Yagh!

1142
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:31,341
Ironhide! Catch!

1143
01:09:35,997 --> 01:09:38,217
Behind you!

1144
01:09:41,438 --> 01:09:43,744
[Ironhide] Decepticon punk!

1145
01:09:51,099 --> 01:09:53,363
Class dismissed.

1146
01:09:58,281 --> 01:10:01,327
- Get inside! Let's go!
- Move! Team's moving!

1147
01:10:01,371 --> 01:10:03,460
- Lennox!
- Go, go, go, go!

1148
01:10:03,503 --> 01:10:05,375
We got Decepticons everywhere.

1149
01:10:05,418 --> 01:10:07,290
I've got my whole team
deployed, lookin' for 'em.

1150
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:08,769
Ironhide! Protect Sentinel!

1151
01:10:08,813 --> 01:10:10,989
- Get him locked up inside!
- Consider it done!

1152
01:10:11,032 --> 01:10:13,426
You gotta guard him 'cause he'sthe key to the whole thing.

1153
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:15,123
Indeed, I am.

1154
01:10:15,167 --> 01:10:18,039
What you must realize,
my Autobot brothers,

1155
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:21,129
is we were never
going to win the war.

1156
01:10:21,173 --> 01:10:23,393
For the sake of
our planet's survival,

1157
01:10:23,436 --> 01:10:28,572
a deal had to be
made... with Megatron.

1158
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:32,445
[groans]

1159
01:10:35,013 --> 01:10:39,017
- Get back!
- What have you done?

1160
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:42,803
I hereby discharge you
from duty.

1161
01:10:42,847 --> 01:10:45,284
Nooo!

1162
01:10:46,198 --> 01:10:47,678
[Lennox] Fall back, take cover!

1163
01:10:47,721 --> 01:10:49,767
- Bee!
- Get back!

1164
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:51,421
Bee!

1165
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:02,867
[screaming]

1166
01:11:04,521 --> 01:11:06,871
Rally all NEST forces
back to the base!

1167
01:11:06,914 --> 01:11:08,916
Come on! Come on!

1168
01:11:13,181 --> 01:11:15,488
[groaning]

1169
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:20,014
- Get a medic down here!
- We don't have enough men!

1170
01:11:20,058 --> 01:11:22,016
Do not engage Sentinel!

1171
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,280
[Mearing] Just go
to the back gate.

1172
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:31,635
[man] Take cover!

1173
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,682
Punch left, punch left!

1174
01:11:35,726 --> 01:11:37,902
Let's go! Follow me!

1175
01:11:37,945 --> 01:11:41,384
[shouting, screaming]

1176
01:11:46,911 --> 01:11:49,043
- Director...
- Stand down!

1177
01:11:49,087 --> 01:11:50,697
- Hey, Sentinel!
- Director!

1178
01:11:50,741 --> 01:11:53,657
What is going on?What do you think you're doing?

1179
01:11:56,964 --> 01:11:58,575
I am a Prime!

1180
01:11:58,618 --> 01:12:02,448
I do not take
orders from you.

1181
01:12:02,492 --> 01:12:04,755
Director Mearing, come on.
We can't fight him. Let's go.

1182
01:12:04,798 --> 01:12:09,325
- We have to go.- Now return what belongs to me!

1183
01:12:10,587 --> 01:12:12,589
Oh... my God!

1184
01:12:26,254 --> 01:12:28,822
- [man] You guys OK?
- [man 2] Everybody out!
Is everybody out?!

1185
01:12:28,866 --> 01:12:32,435
OK, buddy, stay calm.
You're gonna be fine,
just breathe slow.

1186
01:12:39,964 --> 01:12:43,489
Yeah, take a look, Optimus!
This is all on you!

1187
01:12:43,533 --> 01:12:47,232
Sentinel hit the vault!
Took the pillars.

1188
01:12:47,275 --> 01:12:48,625
Come on, let's go.

1189
01:12:48,668 --> 01:12:51,584
All right, notify
the 101st Airborne!

1190
01:12:51,628 --> 01:12:53,760
We need to hunt this thing down!

1191
01:12:55,632 --> 01:12:58,635
- [gasping]
- [sirens blaring]

1192
01:12:59,766 --> 01:13:02,552
[panting] Carly?!

1193
01:13:03,814 --> 01:13:06,991
Hot from our little campfire.
S'mores.

1194
01:13:07,034 --> 01:13:08,601
- Aw.
- Isn't that great?

1195
01:13:08,645 --> 01:13:10,734
We were really
livin' off the land.

1196
01:13:10,777 --> 01:13:12,823
Mom, Dad, have you guys seen
Carly come home yet?

1197
01:13:12,866 --> 01:13:15,347
Excuse me, can you knock,
please? This is our bedroom.

1198
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:17,784
- Why wouldn't she be at home?
- We had a fight and...

1199
01:13:17,828 --> 01:13:20,570
...we might have broken up or beon a break. I don't really know.

1200
01:13:20,613 --> 01:13:23,007
- What?! No!
- Look, I can't talk
about it right now.

1201
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:25,879
- You got to be kidding me!
- I can't go into the details.
I have to find her.

1202
01:13:25,923 --> 01:13:28,665
Sit down! We're havin' afamily meeting! Family meeting!

1203
01:13:28,708 --> 01:13:30,797
You may not know this,
but your father and I

1204
01:13:30,841 --> 01:13:33,626
were not always this perfectly
happy. You know, there was
a time in our marriage

1205
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:36,020
- when I thought this
was not gonna work out.
- Can we please not?

1206
01:13:36,063 --> 01:13:38,326
- I'm just trying to understand.- She's damaging him.

1207
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:40,590
You break up with one
world-class hottie...

1208
01:13:40,633 --> 01:13:43,810
No, stop, stop, OK?
She dumped me, I moved on to
somethin' better. That's it.

1209
01:13:43,854 --> 01:13:46,247
I'm a happier person.
Why don't you help me?

1210
01:13:46,291 --> 01:13:48,336
- They had an argument.
- [Sam] One fight.

1211
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:51,514
You're not gonna get a third
one. I mean, unless you have,
like, a big...

1212
01:13:51,557 --> 01:13:53,646
What the f...?!
Ma! Mom, Mom...

1213
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:55,169
...don't know
what you're doin'.

1214
01:13:55,213 --> 01:13:56,344
I don't want
to talk about this.

1215
01:13:56,388 --> 01:13:57,607
You need the book.

1216
01:13:57,650 --> 01:13:59,391
You're always wrong.
Get used to it.

1217
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,175
OK, this, you got to read
this. She Comes First.

1218
01:14:01,219 --> 01:14:03,656
- There's some killer
shit in this.
- No, no, no...

1219
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:06,093
- Oh, that's it, I'm goin'...
- No, no.

1220
01:14:06,137 --> 01:14:08,661
Sit down! Sit down!
Back me up!

1221
01:14:08,705 --> 01:14:11,751
- Happy wife, happy life.
- Fuck, yeah.

1222
01:14:11,795 --> 01:14:15,189
Unhappy wife, stone-coldmisery for the rest of your....

1223
01:14:15,233 --> 01:14:16,495
- Stop.
- It's true.

1224
01:14:16,539 --> 01:14:18,541
All I'm sayin' is,
do you love this girl?

1225
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:21,152
- She's the one.
- Then you gotta go get her.

1226
01:14:21,195 --> 01:14:24,329
I mean, your dad and I,
when we had troubles, he...

1227
01:14:24,372 --> 01:14:26,374
...he moved heaven
and earth to find me.

1228
01:14:26,418 --> 01:14:29,203
Guess what he...
Say what you said. Say it.

1229
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:33,164
"I will follow you
to the end of time."
Does that suck or what?

1230
01:14:33,207 --> 01:14:35,775
- I mean, it's like
a bad sci-fi film.
- No, it was so sweet.

1231
01:14:35,819 --> 01:14:39,083
I want you to get out of
the city. You get as far
away from here as you can.

1232
01:14:39,126 --> 01:14:42,086
You understand?
I love you.

1233
01:14:57,318 --> 01:14:59,756
[gibbering]

1234
01:15:00,887 --> 01:15:05,239
Ah, my master!
Such a brilliant scheme!

1235
01:15:05,283 --> 01:15:09,417
So, when Sentinel left
Cybertron, it was to defect.

1236
01:15:09,461 --> 01:15:13,204
He was meant to rendezvous
with me here on Earth

1237
01:15:13,247 --> 01:15:15,989
before fate waylaid us both.

1238
01:15:16,033 --> 01:15:18,383
The only way to revive him:

1239
01:15:18,426 --> 01:15:21,734
We needed Prime and his Matrix.

1240
01:15:21,778 --> 01:15:24,781
[Starscream] Excellent strategy.

1241
01:15:32,963 --> 01:15:34,965
Mine, mine!

1242
01:15:35,966 --> 01:15:38,446
So he is now
your partner, master?

1243
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:42,407
He is my
greatest triumph.

1244
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:43,626
So impressive.

1245
01:15:43,669 --> 01:15:45,802
Commencing transport.

1246
01:15:45,845 --> 01:15:51,198
- Stop! No! No, no, Sentinel!
- Forgive me.

1247
01:15:54,854 --> 01:15:59,119
Here we are.
Fight us now.

1248
01:16:44,382 --> 01:16:47,167
Autobots, retreat!

1249
01:16:54,261 --> 01:16:56,176
[yelling]

1250
01:16:59,745 --> 01:17:02,792
[indistinct radio chatter]

1251
01:17:13,237 --> 01:17:15,195
Why, Sentinel, why?!

1252
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:18,546
For Cybertron! For our home!

1253
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:20,548
What war destroyed,
we can rebuild!

1254
01:17:20,592 --> 01:17:23,900
But only if we join
with the Decepticons.

1255
01:17:23,943 --> 01:17:25,771
No, it's not the only way.

1256
01:17:25,815 --> 01:17:28,687
This is our home!
We must defend the humans!

1257
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:30,776
So lost you are, Optimus.

1258
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:33,300
On Cybertron,
we were gods.

1259
01:17:33,344 --> 01:17:36,695
And here, they
call us machines.

1260
01:17:36,739 --> 01:17:40,917
Let the humans
serve us or perish.

1261
01:17:43,354 --> 01:17:45,486
You're lucky I didn't kill you.

1262
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:48,228
In time, you'll see.

1263
01:17:48,272 --> 01:17:50,840
It's not over.

1264
01:17:53,451 --> 01:17:57,890
[Dylan] Now if I were him,
I wouldn't let you out
of my sight for one second.

1265
01:17:57,934 --> 01:17:59,979
- [chuckles]
- Mmm.

1266
01:18:00,023 --> 01:18:01,981
It's funny. I was just thinkin'on the way over here,

1267
01:18:02,025 --> 01:18:04,244
I could really use some
advice from Dylan.
And there he is.

1268
01:18:04,288 --> 01:18:07,160
- Can I speak to you?
- Welcome. Please, sit down.
Have a drink.

1269
01:18:07,204 --> 01:18:09,728
You know what? I don't need
a drink. Or a car or a job.

1270
01:18:09,772 --> 01:18:13,689
I just need to speak to my
girlfriend alone. Is that OK
with you, Mr. Inappropriate?

1271
01:18:15,473 --> 01:18:17,257
Excuse me.

1272
01:18:19,564 --> 01:18:22,045
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you outside.

1273
01:18:22,088 --> 01:18:23,960
I really think
I could help you, Sam.

1274
01:18:24,003 --> 01:18:26,353
I remember a talk I had withmy dad once about tough choices.

1275
01:18:26,397 --> 01:18:28,921
[Sam] Yeah, now's not the time.We'll set somethin' up, though.

1276
01:18:28,965 --> 01:18:30,967
[Dylan] Of course, that was
way back when my dad's firm

1277
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:34,971
was in charge of budget review
and accounting for NASA.

1278
01:18:35,014 --> 01:18:37,756
You see, the thing
that he taught me was,
when it's not your war,

1279
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,978
you join the side
that's going to win.

1280
01:18:42,021 --> 01:18:43,327
- Move.
- [Dylan] Too direct?

1281
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:45,808
- Or was it just me?
- Certainly not you, sir.

1282
01:18:59,038 --> 01:19:01,432
- You're mine!
- [screams]

1283
01:19:01,475 --> 01:19:03,390
No!

1284
01:19:05,175 --> 01:19:07,568
- Get help!
- Sam, I can't get out!

1285
01:19:07,612 --> 01:19:09,657
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Gould.

1286
01:19:09,701 --> 01:19:12,182
[Carly] Get me out of here!

1287
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:17,143
[Sam] Help! Get help!

1288
01:19:17,187 --> 01:19:19,972
- He's young. He will learn.
- [Carly] Get me out!

1289
01:19:20,016 --> 01:19:22,148
- Good night.
- It was a fun night.

1290
01:19:22,192 --> 01:19:24,107
You really think
you're the first man

1291
01:19:24,150 --> 01:19:27,632
- ever asked to join
the noble alien cause?
- Who are you?!

1292
01:19:27,675 --> 01:19:31,114
Do you know why we've
not been back to the moon
since 1972?

1293
01:19:31,157 --> 01:19:36,249
Because these two... they came
to my dad and they told himto do some creative accounting.

1294
01:19:36,293 --> 01:19:38,338
Make it way too expensive
to ever go back.

1295
01:19:38,382 --> 01:19:41,559
So he and others shut down
the American and Russian
space programs,

1296
01:19:41,602 --> 01:19:44,954
- and they've been
our clients ever since.
- You help them kill people?

1297
01:19:44,997 --> 01:19:48,609
You think they give you
a choice? Besides, it's notlike I personally participated.

1298
01:19:48,653 --> 01:19:51,482
I am a liaison. I liaise.

1299
01:19:51,525 --> 01:19:54,485
[grunting]

1300
01:19:54,528 --> 01:19:56,226
It's hostile takeover time, Sam.

1301
01:19:58,184 --> 01:20:00,186
Sam!

1302
01:20:01,622 --> 01:20:04,364
- Sam!
- Let her go!

1303
01:20:04,408 --> 01:20:07,411
- [grunting]
- Sam!

1304
01:20:08,542 --> 01:20:09,979
[whimpering]

1305
01:20:10,022 --> 01:20:12,068
[Dylan] I've had my eye
on you for years, Sam.

1306
01:20:12,111 --> 01:20:16,072
The one spy I've never been
able to provide is someone
close to the Autobots.

1307
01:20:18,465 --> 01:20:21,077
Sam, don't do what he wants!

1308
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,167
Yes, he will. They all do.

1309
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:26,212
[grunts]

1310
01:20:26,256 --> 01:20:28,345
They will slaughter her,
do you understand me?

1311
01:20:28,388 --> 01:20:31,000
In the time it
takes you to blink,
they will do it to her

1312
01:20:31,043 --> 01:20:34,046
and they will do it to me.
So you show a little respect

1313
01:20:34,090 --> 01:20:37,006
when someone
offers you a job!

1314
01:20:37,441 --> 01:20:39,443
A wrist.

1315
01:20:39,486 --> 01:20:43,099
You are to track down
Optimus Prime, because
you're the one human he trusts

1316
01:20:43,142 --> 01:20:44,578
and you will
ask one question:

1317
01:20:44,622 --> 01:20:46,537
How does he intend
to fight back?

1318
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:49,279
Strategies, tactics, everything!

1319
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:55,502
- [screams]
- Has a nasty little bite,
doesn't it?

1320
01:20:55,546 --> 01:20:58,331
It's very high-tech.
It lets us see what you see,

1321
01:20:58,375 --> 01:21:00,899
hear what you hear and it
taps your nervous system.

1322
01:21:00,943 --> 01:21:03,554
So if you so much as
try and signal...

1323
01:21:03,597 --> 01:21:05,817
- [crackling]
- [groans]

1324
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:07,514
I don't know what
to tell you, Sam.

1325
01:21:07,558 --> 01:21:08,907
Relationships have consequences.

1326
01:21:08,951 --> 01:21:10,430
I am here because of my father.

1327
01:21:10,474 --> 01:21:12,476
She is here because of you.

1328
01:21:14,173 --> 01:21:17,133
- [Carly yells]
- Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

1329
01:21:17,176 --> 01:21:19,222
Soundwave, would you please?

1330
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:25,924
Sam? Do your job.
She'll be safe.

1331
01:21:25,968 --> 01:21:28,884
I give you my word.

1332
01:21:30,146 --> 01:21:33,584
I'll kill you.
You have my word.

1333
01:21:36,021 --> 01:21:38,937
[man] Combatant Commands
are now at DEFCON one.

1334
01:21:38,981 --> 01:21:42,245
Approximately two hundred
Decepticons are now in hiding.

1335
01:21:42,288 --> 01:21:46,205
Energon detectors have been
triggered as far away as
South America and China.

1336
01:21:46,249 --> 01:21:49,121
The UN has just received
an encrypted audio file.

1337
01:21:49,165 --> 01:21:51,950
They say it's from
the leader of the Autobots.

1338
01:21:51,994 --> 01:21:53,778
[Sentinel] Defenders of Earth.

1339
01:21:53,821 --> 01:21:56,650
We have come for your
natural resources

1340
01:21:56,694 --> 01:21:59,262
to rebuild our damaged planet.

1341
01:21:59,305 --> 01:22:02,134
When we have transported
all we need,

1342
01:22:02,178 --> 01:22:04,484
we will leave
your world in peace.

1343
01:22:04,528 --> 01:22:07,835
For such peace to exist,
you must immediately

1344
01:22:07,879 --> 01:22:12,449
exile the Autobot rebels
you have harbored.

1345
01:22:12,492 --> 01:22:14,364
Nonnegotiable.

1346
01:22:14,407 --> 01:22:19,456
Renounce the rebels.
We await your reply.

1347
01:22:19,499 --> 01:22:21,284
[Mearing] We'll debrief you
in transit.

1348
01:22:21,327 --> 01:22:22,981
I really don't see how
I can be of any help.

1349
01:22:23,025 --> 01:22:24,287
You guys seem pretty busy.

1350
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:26,332
We could just do this
another time, I think.

1351
01:22:26,376 --> 01:22:29,161
[groans]

1352
01:22:29,205 --> 01:22:31,598
I have underestimated you
at every turn.

1353
01:22:31,642 --> 01:22:34,906
- What?
- You warned us that
they were using humans.

1354
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,864
And you knew that
Sentinel was the key.

1355
01:22:36,908 --> 01:22:39,345
- Director!
- No, who am I?

1356
01:22:39,389 --> 01:22:41,826
Hey, you're the expert.
I'm just a walkin'
security risk.

1357
01:22:41,869 --> 01:22:44,394
[gasps]

1358
01:22:45,395 --> 01:22:48,093
[clattering]

1359
01:22:48,137 --> 01:22:50,661
- Are you all right?
- [groaning]

1360
01:22:50,704 --> 01:22:53,359
- [straining] Yes.
- No, you're not.
You're sweating.

1361
01:22:53,403 --> 01:22:55,535
I'm, I'm fine. I'm fine.I'm sweating 'cause I'm nervous.

1362
01:22:55,579 --> 01:22:58,234
I'm nervous because you
got me in here with
this information, OK?

1363
01:22:58,277 --> 01:23:01,193
I'm a Twitter junkie. I
blog everything. I can't keep
a secret to save my life.

1364
01:23:01,237 --> 01:23:05,371
- Oh, you wouldn't dare.
- Director, the Pentagon's
calling in 15.

1365
01:23:05,415 --> 01:23:08,026
- What are you doin'?
- Nothin', what are you doin'?

1366
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:10,159
Get away from me.

1367
01:23:10,202 --> 01:23:12,900
It's been a remarkable series of events today at the Capitol.

1368
01:23:12,944 --> 01:23:15,077
And just moments ago,
legislation was passed

1369
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,775
to exile the Autobots
from American shores.

1370
01:23:17,818 --> 01:23:21,431
The US military alliance
with them is officially over.

1371
01:23:21,474 --> 01:23:23,433
- Yeah?
- In the words of the House
Majority Leader,

1372
01:23:23,476 --> 01:23:25,217
the sponsor of
today's resolution,

1373
01:23:25,261 --> 01:23:27,393
- "We cannot in good
conscience...
- What?

1374
01:23:27,437 --> 01:23:29,743
They can't do this. You got to
tell 'em they can't do that.

1375
01:23:29,787 --> 01:23:31,702
OK, it's official.
It's a go, people!

1376
01:23:31,745 --> 01:23:34,226
These are our allies.
The Autobots fought for us,
they fought with us.

1377
01:23:34,270 --> 01:23:36,315
And where are we now?
Facing an enemy invasion

1378
01:23:36,359 --> 01:23:39,579
with an enemy that has the meansto deploy countless more.

1379
01:23:42,452 --> 01:23:44,236
[Mearing] If there
is any more you know,

1380
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:47,109
anything at all about
the enemy's intentions...

1381
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:50,547
...now is the time to tell.

1382
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:52,375
Autobots have no way
of leavin' this planet.

1383
01:23:52,418 --> 01:23:55,117
And that is
where you're wrong.

1384
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:57,858
Its name is theXantium.

1385
01:23:57,902 --> 01:23:59,599
It brought the second wave
of Autobots,

1386
01:23:59,643 --> 01:24:02,950
and it's been under NASA's
care and study ever since.

1387
01:24:02,994 --> 01:24:04,691
We linked it with a
decommissioned Shuttle,

1388
01:24:04,735 --> 01:24:07,477
to maintain military control
until they're gone.

1389
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:11,220
Gonna be 10,000 pounds oftorque on that itsy bitsy bolt!

1390
01:24:11,263 --> 01:24:14,092
- Not nineteen!
- You're gonna risk
the lives of all me mates!

1391
01:24:14,136 --> 01:24:17,443
- I'll bottle ya!
- These guys are the Wreckers.
They take care of the Xantium.

1392
01:24:17,487 --> 01:24:19,793
We don't let 'em off the base
much, 'cause they're assholes.

1393
01:24:19,837 --> 01:24:23,536
- You're gonna pull that,
you nancy wanker!
- It's time to kill him!

1394
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:25,799
I'm just tryin' to help, you
know? I'm just doin' my job!

1395
01:24:25,843 --> 01:24:28,280
Just calm down. Leave him alone.This is a human being.

1396
01:24:28,324 --> 01:24:30,282
- Epps!
- [Wrecker]
You are ridiculous!

1397
01:24:30,326 --> 01:24:32,154
- Is that you?
- Hey, what up, man?

1398
01:24:32,197 --> 01:24:35,331
- What are you doin' here?- I retired from the Air Force.

1399
01:24:35,374 --> 01:24:39,596
Can you let my hand go?
What the hell was that?

1400
01:24:39,639 --> 01:24:42,033
Now I just consult to run
interference for them.

1401
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:43,513
[Wrecker] Well,
you're not helpin'!

1402
01:24:43,556 --> 01:24:45,515
No more combat and aliens
shootin' at my ass.

1403
01:24:45,558 --> 01:24:48,300
- I got a dream job.
- Time to get off this planet.

1404
01:24:48,344 --> 01:24:52,304
Kickin' the Autobots out.
Can you believe this
is happenin'?

1405
01:24:52,348 --> 01:24:54,001
Where do you
think it's taking 'em?

1406
01:24:54,045 --> 01:24:56,526
Any planet but here.

1407
01:24:59,006 --> 01:25:01,705
I want to talk to who's
ever in charge here.

1408
01:25:01,748 --> 01:25:04,795
Well, well, well.

1409
01:25:04,838 --> 01:25:06,318
Charlotte Mearing.

1410
01:25:06,362 --> 01:25:08,929
Agent Simmons.
Former Agent Simmons.

1411
01:25:08,973 --> 01:25:11,497
So, I see you
survived Washington.

1412
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:15,980
Washington, Egypt, heartbreak.
I survive. I will survive.

1413
01:25:16,023 --> 01:25:17,416
They're bringin'
everybody in, kid.

1414
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:19,853
Putting all the intel
on the table.

1415
01:25:19,897 --> 01:25:22,769
And if you think
deporting nine Autobots

1416
01:25:22,813 --> 01:25:24,989
is gonna solve a damn thing...

1417
01:25:25,032 --> 01:25:26,773
It's out of my hands.

1418
01:25:26,817 --> 01:25:29,820
Moving up in the world, huh?

1419
01:25:29,863 --> 01:25:33,737
Your booty looks excellent.

1420
01:25:36,087 --> 01:25:39,786
You ever say a word to anyone
about what happened that night
in Quantico,

1421
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:41,614
I'll cut your heart out.

1422
01:25:41,658 --> 01:25:44,400
You already did.

1423
01:25:44,443 --> 01:25:47,359
Sammy, listen to me.
Don't let 'em exile us.

1424
01:25:47,403 --> 01:25:48,969
Don't let 'em take us, Sam.

1425
01:25:49,013 --> 01:25:51,146
It's a Decepticon trap.

1426
01:26:26,398 --> 01:26:30,489
Check the nitrogen levels.
We're bookin' out of here, eh?

1427
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:36,016
- Optimus?- What your leaders say is true.

1428
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:38,410
Aye, this was all my fault.

1429
01:26:38,454 --> 01:26:42,849
I told them whom to trust.
I was so wrong.

1430
01:26:42,893 --> 01:26:46,157
That doesn't make it
your fault. It just makes
you human for a change.

1431
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,941
Remember this.

1432
01:26:47,985 --> 01:26:51,031
You may lose
your faith in us,

1433
01:26:51,075 --> 01:26:54,600
but never in yourselves.

1434
01:26:54,644 --> 01:26:57,560
[groaning]

1435
01:27:01,172 --> 01:27:04,175
I need to know how
you're gonna fight back.

1436
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:08,440
I know there's a strategy. Iknow you're, you're comin' backwith reinforcements, somethin'.

1437
01:27:08,484 --> 01:27:10,747
I know there's a plan. I....

1438
01:27:13,489 --> 01:27:16,492
You can tell me.
No other human will ever know.

1439
01:27:17,188 --> 01:27:20,583
There is no plan.

1440
01:27:20,626 --> 01:27:23,934
If we just do what they want,
how are we gonna live with
ourselves?

1441
01:27:25,544 --> 01:27:28,199
You are my friend, Sam.

1442
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:33,378
You always will be.
But your leaders have spoken.

1443
01:27:34,597 --> 01:27:40,516
From here...
the fight will be your own.

1444
01:27:53,137 --> 01:27:57,315
Make it short.
We're loading up.

1445
01:27:57,359 --> 01:28:01,580
[Wrecker] All right, hustle up!We're launchin' at dawn.

1446
01:28:04,496 --> 01:28:06,324
We're gonna do whatever we can.

1447
01:28:06,368 --> 01:28:07,934
Make it like it was.

1448
01:28:07,978 --> 01:28:11,808
You will always be
my friend, Sam.

1449
01:28:11,851 --> 01:28:14,289
I got to be goin' on.

1450
01:28:26,649 --> 01:28:28,477
[sobbing]

1451
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,349
Years from now,
they're gonna ask us...

1452
01:28:31,393 --> 01:28:34,483
"Where were you when they
took over the planet?"

1453
01:28:36,093 --> 01:28:37,921
And we're gonna say...

1454
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:41,794
"we just stood by and watched."

1455
01:28:54,633 --> 01:28:58,071
[Dylan] You should really look
at this as a partnership.

1456
01:28:58,115 --> 01:29:01,858
You have to stand on the side
of progress if you want
to be a part of history.

1457
01:29:07,167 --> 01:29:10,432
[radio chatter]

1458
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:17,395
[man on PA] Seven, six, five...

1459
01:29:17,439 --> 01:29:22,661
Four, three, two, one, zero.

1460
01:29:30,495 --> 01:29:33,585
Go ahead and throttle up,
CAPCOM. Booster flight.

1461
01:29:33,629 --> 01:29:36,022
- [applause]
- Go ahead, flight.

1462
01:29:48,687 --> 01:29:50,167
[line ringing]

1463
01:29:50,210 --> 01:29:51,777
Well, you wanted an answer.
You got one.

1464
01:29:51,821 --> 01:29:53,953
[Dylan] I always get
what I want, Sam.

1465
01:29:53,997 --> 01:29:55,781
We just needed to be sure.

1466
01:29:55,825 --> 01:29:57,043
Sure of what?

1467
01:29:57,087 --> 01:29:58,915
That they would go
without a fight.

1468
01:30:08,490 --> 01:30:12,494
- [man on PA] Say again?
- [woman on PA] We're tracking
an incoming object.

1469
01:31:01,717 --> 01:31:02,761
[grunting]

1470
01:31:02,805 --> 01:31:06,025
We all work
for the Decepticons now.

1471
01:31:10,029 --> 01:31:12,423
I need your help to track
a phone call. There's a man
on this phone.

1472
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:15,034
He's the head of their
human operations and
he has Carly hostage.

1473
01:31:15,078 --> 01:31:18,081
I want you to sit down.
Don't move, all right?

1474
01:31:18,908 --> 01:31:20,823
Follow me.

1475
01:31:20,866 --> 01:31:23,695
I'm watching him
drive up right now.

1476
01:31:26,655 --> 01:31:28,526
[Dutch] The call
was placed en route.

1477
01:31:28,570 --> 01:31:30,876
Wait, I'm hacking into
the phone's camera now.

1478
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:33,400
There, that's it! That's a livestream from the camera.

1479
01:31:33,444 --> 01:31:36,621
Some place. Hold on,
I can triangulate this.

1480
01:31:36,665 --> 01:31:39,232
OK, it's Chicago cell sites.
There, I've got it.

1481
01:31:39,276 --> 01:31:42,018
Trump Tower, Chicago.
Lower penthouse.

1482
01:31:42,061 --> 01:31:44,150
We're on.

01:31:45,891 --> 01:31:47,893
- I'm goin'.
- [Seymour] You sure?

1484
01:31:47,937 --> 01:31:50,548
She's done nothin' but try
to help me and I can be there
in 15 hours.

1485
01:31:50,592 --> 01:31:53,203
You're not goin' alone.

1486
01:31:55,031 --> 01:31:57,729
I still got my NEST
friends out there.

1487
01:31:57,773 --> 01:32:01,124
I'm gonna round 'em up,
we gonna find your girlfriend,
we gonna bring this guy in.

1488
01:32:01,167 --> 01:32:02,691
Why are you helpin' me?

1489
01:32:02,734 --> 01:32:06,651
'Cause that asshole
killed my friends, too.

1490
01:32:21,971 --> 01:32:24,147
They said they were here
for our resources.

1491
01:32:24,190 --> 01:32:26,236
- To rebuild their planet.
- Yes.

1492
01:32:26,279 --> 01:32:29,239
But really one resource
in particular.

1493
01:32:29,282 --> 01:32:31,720
One unique to our planet.

1494
01:32:32,416 --> 01:32:34,723
Us?

1495
01:32:35,898 --> 01:32:37,421
You're very smart.

1496
01:32:37,464 --> 01:32:39,771
You see, they can't rebuild
without a slave labor force.

1497
01:32:39,815 --> 01:32:43,601
How many rocks up there
in the universe offer
six billion workers?

1498
01:32:43,645 --> 01:32:47,779
What are you talking about?
We can't transport people.

1499
01:32:47,823 --> 01:32:50,826
They're not shipping people.
They're shipping their planet
here.

Oh, my God.
What's Sentinel doing here?

1501
01:32:59,704 --> 01:33:03,926
[Dylan] Watch. They're
spreading hundreds of pillars
around the globe right now.

1502
01:33:03,969 --> 01:33:06,842
In just a few hours, they're
gonna launch 'em into orbit

1503
01:33:06,885 --> 01:33:09,888
and bring Cybertron
into our atmosphere.

1504
01:33:09,932 --> 01:33:12,456
The red one there
controls the rest.

1505
01:33:12,499 --> 01:33:14,501
He triggers that,
it starts the whole thing.

- I want to survive.

01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:29,865
I want 40 more years.
You think I asked for this?

1511
01:33:29,908 --> 01:33:33,042
- I inherited a client.- Yeah and when Cybertron's here

1512
01:33:33,085 --> 01:33:35,914
and we're all their slaves,
I guess they'll still need
a human leader.

out of here now!
Get 'em in the back!

1518
01:35:01,086 --> 01:35:03,523
I guess they didn't tell you
about this part, did they?

1519
01:35:03,567 --> 01:35:05,090
You think I'm in every meeting?

1520
01:35:05,134 --> 01:35:09,791
Look, I'm safe.
They said I'm safe.

We're about ten minutes

We have Special Forces trying

They're surrounding the city
to make a fortress,

so that no one can see
what they're up to inside.

1589
01:40:58,269 --> 01:41:01,794
Our only chance is
the element of surprise.

What is that? So-so?

1635
01:45:47,341 --> 01:45:49,778
- Can you do somethin'?
- I think we got something.

1636
01:45:49,821 --> 01:45:52,215
- Epps, we got Epps!
- Can you rotate or somethin'?

1637
01:45:52,258 --> 01:45:54,391
Come on, man, work! Work!

1638
01:45:54,435 --> 01:45:55,871
All right, turn the volume
up on that!

1639
01:45:55,914 --> 01:46:00,397
- The kid!
- Can you rotate? somethin'!

1640
01:46:00,441 --> 01:46:03,574
Yes, yes! OK, OK, OK.
They can see us.

1641
01:46:03,618 --> 01:46:05,446
Chicago is ground zero.
Do you understand?

1642
01:46:05,489 --> 01:46:07,752
- Do you hear us?
You understand?
- Witwicky.

1643
01:46:07,796 --> 01:46:10,973
Please listen. Sentinel Prime
is here and he has the pillars
for his space bridge.

1644
01:46:11,016 --> 01:46:14,672
They're on top of a building onthe Chicago River. It's owned byHotchkiss Gould Investments.

1645
01:46:14,716 --> 01:46:17,240
Now the pillar that
controls everything is
in the southeast cupola.

1646
01:46:17,283 --> 01:46:19,764
You gotta destroy the pillar.
You have to shoot down
the pillar

1647
01:46:19,808 --> 01:46:22,637
or they're gonna
transport Cybertron here.
Do you understand?

1648
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:24,029
- Do you understand?
- What?

1649
01:46:24,073 --> 01:46:25,770
Give me a GPS on the
building and on that drone!

1650
01:46:25,814 --> 01:46:27,206
Let's go!

1651
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:29,295
Mensurate those coordinates.
Shorten the kill chain.

1652
01:46:29,339 --> 01:46:32,168
[Lennox] Guys on the tarmac,
five minutes.

1653
01:46:32,211 --> 01:46:33,909
All right.

1654
01:46:33,952 --> 01:46:36,781
We need to move before
the fighters spot us.

1655
01:46:36,825 --> 01:46:40,481
Wait here until we scout
a route ahead. Let's roll.

1656
01:46:40,524 --> 01:46:42,787
Ratchet, cover high.

1657
01:46:42,831 --> 01:46:45,268
Hey, you think we could
use that rocket to shoot
down the pillar?

1658
01:46:45,311 --> 01:46:48,010
We're eight blocks away. We gotto get closer to take a shot.

1659
01:46:48,053 --> 01:46:51,361
Not closer. Higher.
We need clear line of sight.

1660
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:53,102
And it's across the river.

1661
01:46:53,145 --> 01:46:55,060
We're gonna have a hell of
a time tryin' to sneak up.

1662
01:46:55,104 --> 01:47:00,022
- We only got one shot.
- One shot's all we need.

1663
01:47:00,065 --> 01:47:02,546
We got to be able to see aroundthat building from the ground.

1664
01:47:02,590 --> 01:47:05,723
Get NSA to send server specs
for any cameras in that area.

1665
01:47:05,767 --> 01:47:09,640
Maybe some are working. Trafficlights. ATMs. Anything.

1666
01:47:09,684 --> 01:47:12,817
[Lennox] Listen up.
You want to hit back?

1667
01:47:12,861 --> 01:47:17,169
We're gonna have to wingsuit in.It's the only way to get close.

1668
01:47:17,213 --> 01:47:21,130
I can't promise anyone a ride
home, but if you're with me...

1669
01:47:21,173 --> 01:47:23,698
...the world needs you now.

1670
01:47:23,741 --> 01:47:26,831
I can find my own
ride home, sir.

1671
01:47:29,181 --> 01:47:30,356
Who else?!

1672
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:32,576
[man] Right here, sir!

1673
01:47:32,620 --> 01:47:37,189
General Morshower,
requesting diversionary action
to the south of the city.

1674
01:47:37,233 --> 01:47:40,149
We're comin' north and low.You guys drive 'em to the east.

1675
01:47:56,644 --> 01:47:59,560
Autobot victory,
Autobot victory!

1676
01:48:31,287 --> 01:48:33,898
That is one scary-ass
Decepticon!

1677
01:48:33,942 --> 01:48:37,641
They got my trailer.
I need that flight tech.

1678
01:48:38,816 --> 01:48:41,558
Shockwave can't hunt
all of us at once.

1679
01:48:41,602 --> 01:48:44,996
Wreckers, we need a diversion.

1680
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:47,956
- Let's get some!
- You got that right.

1681
01:48:47,999 --> 01:48:51,089
Listen, we're gonna circle
around to that glass buildin'.

1682
01:48:51,133 --> 01:48:53,483
And we'll get high enough
to make the rocket shot.

1683
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:55,964
While you guys draw his fire!
Let's move!

1684
01:48:56,007 --> 01:49:00,011
Wait a minute! I'm not lettin'
ya go out there without my
urban combat prototypes.

1685
01:49:00,055 --> 01:49:02,231
- We gotta go, Que! Come on!
- Oh, please!

1686
01:49:02,274 --> 01:49:04,059
They're great inventions
for kicking ass!

1687
01:49:04,102 --> 01:49:06,583
- What are these?
- [Que] Those are boom-sticks.

1688
01:49:06,627 --> 01:49:10,892
Armed in 30 seconds.
Grapple gloves, for climbin'.

1689
01:49:10,935 --> 01:49:13,634
[Epps] Go, go, move your ass!
Move, move!

1690
01:49:13,677 --> 01:49:15,810
Move, move! Go, go, go!

1691
01:49:21,119 --> 01:49:23,774
- Move, move!
- Let's go!

1692
01:49:32,696 --> 01:49:34,872
- Agh!
- Ow, ow, ow!

1693
01:49:34,916 --> 01:49:37,092
Let's go! Run!

1694
01:49:43,315 --> 01:49:44,708
Hey, hey, hey, where you
goin'?

1695
01:49:44,752 --> 01:49:47,798
No, no, no! Stop, stop, stop!
Don't leave!

1696
01:49:47,842 --> 01:49:50,148
You never leave a 'bot behind!

1697
01:49:50,192 --> 01:49:52,063
Aw, Shockwave's comin'!

1698
01:49:56,154 --> 01:49:58,504
- [Epps] Go for the stairs!
- Epps, this way!

1699
01:49:58,548 --> 01:50:00,115
Come on, let's go, let's go!

1700
01:50:00,158 --> 01:50:01,725
[man] Breakin' right,
breakin' right.

1701
01:50:01,769 --> 01:50:03,858
[man 2] Bead. Rollin' in.

1702
01:50:08,123 --> 01:50:10,647
We got another one comin'
around, comin' around
the left side.

1703
01:50:10,691 --> 01:50:12,649
Comin' around on the right sideand lookin' around.

1704
01:50:12,693 --> 01:50:14,651
We're gonna use
Willis Tower for cover!

1705
01:50:14,695 --> 01:50:16,653
Once we make altitude, we jump!

1706
01:50:16,697 --> 01:50:19,700
There are a lot
of airplanes out here!

1707
01:50:21,876 --> 01:50:24,835
Mayday, I don't think
he's gonna make it.

1708
01:50:24,879 --> 01:50:27,142
[man 3] Heads up, heads up!

1709
01:50:29,971 --> 01:50:32,626
Come on, come on,

- [man] Tally on the left. - [man 2] Got 'em. Have visual.

1711
01:50:43,724 --> 01:50:45,769
[man 3] Time on target:
20 seconds.

1712
01:50:45,813 --> 01:50:47,945
All right, here we go!
Here we go!

1713
01:50:47,989 --> 01:50:50,861
- Keep it tight!
- Clear. Comin' around.

1714
01:50:50,905 --> 01:50:53,690
All right,
focus, focus, focus.

1715
01:50:57,912 --> 01:51:00,392
[man] Threat above!
Pop-up! Six o'clock!

1716
01:51:00,436 --> 01:51:01,524
Locusts!

1717
01:51:01,567 --> 01:51:04,832
Look out, look out!
Break right!

1718
01:51:04,875 --> 01:51:08,313

1719
01:51:10,533 --> 01:51:12,056
Look out, look out!

1720
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:13,710
Get 'em out,

1721
01:51:13,754 --> 01:51:15,930
- Everybody out, out, out!

1722
01:51:21,631 --> 01:51:24,939
- Get out, get out!

1723
01:51:24,982 --> 01:51:27,071
[man] Tail, get 'em out now,

1724
01:51:27,115 --> 01:51:30,335
Help!

1725
01:51:49,050 --> 01:51:51,966
Get separation.
Track away, track away.

1726
01:52:11,681 --> 01:52:14,771
Hard left! Hard left!

1727
01:52:14,815 --> 01:52:17,905
Six hundred feet!

1728
01:52:31,701 --> 01:52:33,181
Check your six!
Check your six!

1729
01:52:33,224 --> 01:52:36,662
He's on our ass!
Watch out, watch out!

1730
01:52:36,706 --> 01:52:38,229
[screams]

1731
01:52:41,363 --> 01:52:42,799
Sharp right!

1732
01:52:48,022 --> 01:52:50,981
Building dead ahead!
Thread the needle!

1733
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:56,813
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1734
01:53:00,382 --> 01:53:01,862
Pull, pull!

1735
01:53:04,255 --> 01:53:05,996
[Sam] All right, come on,
we're high enough!

1736
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:07,606
This is a mother,
gettin' up here!

1737
01:53:07,650 --> 01:53:09,217
- Get your fat ass over here!
- I'm comin'.

1738
01:53:14,700 --> 01:53:16,224
Set up the rocket!

1739
01:53:16,267 --> 01:53:19,227
- They're comin'.
- All right, weapon status!

1740
01:53:19,270 --> 01:53:22,056
Twenty-nine Bot-busters.
Twenty piercing D-Bots.

1741
01:53:24,101 --> 01:53:26,843
There. The building
with the dome.

1742
01:53:27,583 --> 01:53:30,020
For our brothers.

1743
01:53:30,064 --> 01:53:31,152
Let's make this trip worth it.

1744
01:53:34,155 --> 01:53:36,026
- Oh, God.
- [building creaking]

1745
01:53:36,070 --> 01:53:37,898
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- [man] Is this building...?

1746
01:53:37,941 --> 01:53:40,204
- Whoa, the building!
- Oh, shit!

1747
01:53:40,248 --> 01:53:42,119
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1748
01:53:42,163 --> 01:53:45,993
Whoaaa. They're shooting
at the building!

1749
01:53:48,517 --> 01:53:50,258
- This is not a good idea.
- What?

1750
01:53:50,301 --> 01:53:52,216
This is not a good idea.
The building's unstable.

1751
01:53:52,260 --> 01:53:54,566
Listen, stop for a second. If wedon't do what we came to do,

1752
01:53:54,610 --> 01:53:55,872
then it doesn't matter.
We all die.

1753
01:53:55,916 --> 01:53:57,352
Right? That's your target.
Come on, man!

1754
01:53:57,395 --> 01:53:59,136
I don't even care if the
building collapses.

1755
01:53:59,180 --> 01:54:01,443
I'm havin' a
heart attack anyway.

1756
01:54:02,574 --> 01:54:04,054
The building is goin' over!

1757
01:54:04,098 --> 01:54:05,751
- Hang on! Grab somethin'!
- Take cover!

1758
01:54:05,795 --> 01:54:08,058
[shouting]

1759
01:54:09,625 --> 01:54:11,845
Keep your hands up!

1760
01:54:16,327 --> 01:54:18,329
[all shouting]

1761
01:54:23,726 --> 01:54:26,772
- It's OK! It stopped!
- Guys, look!

1762
01:54:26,816 --> 01:54:29,166
- Incoming, incoming!
- Everybody hide!

1763
01:54:47,184 --> 01:54:49,970
- Don't move!
- [shrieks]

1764
01:54:57,455 --> 01:54:59,980
Don't... move.

1765
01:55:04,810 --> 01:55:07,074
[Epps whispering] Go, go.

1766
01:55:13,471 --> 01:55:16,170
- Run!
- Cover fire!

1767
01:55:18,346 --> 01:55:19,608
Shoot the glass!

1768
01:55:19,651 --> 01:55:21,958
Jump out the window!

1769
01:55:27,877 --> 01:55:32,316
- Jump!
- No!

1770
01:55:34,405 --> 01:55:36,320
[shrieking]

1771
01:55:44,546 --> 01:55:48,158
[man] We're gonna die!

1772
01:55:50,117 --> 01:55:52,249
[Carly] Sam, I can't stop!

1773
01:55:52,293 --> 01:55:54,034
Shoot the glass!

1774
01:55:56,340 --> 01:55:58,386
[Carly] Sam!

1775
01:55:59,561 --> 01:56:02,042
[all grunting]

1776
01:56:20,277 --> 01:56:22,410
Sam!

1777
01:56:27,284 --> 01:56:28,851
No! No! Oh, no, no!

1778
01:56:28,894 --> 01:56:31,419
[screams]

1779
01:56:46,825 --> 01:56:48,175
Is everyone OK?!

1780
01:56:48,218 --> 01:56:51,700
- [Sam] You OK?
- What the hell was that?!

1781
01:56:56,096 --> 01:56:59,664
[panting] This evil thing's
lookin' at me!

1782
01:56:59,708 --> 01:57:01,144
What?!

1783
01:57:12,982 --> 01:57:15,419
It's even got an uglier
Decepticon with it!

1784
01:57:15,463 --> 01:57:17,204
[Epps] Evac!

1785
01:57:26,300 --> 01:57:28,258
[metallic shriek]

1786
01:57:34,917 --> 01:57:37,485
Find a way out!
The stairs are blocked!

1787
01:57:37,528 --> 01:57:38,964
We're trapped!

1788
01:57:39,008 --> 01:57:40,966
Hey, how do we get
out of here? Hey!

1789
01:57:41,010 --> 01:57:42,620
- Come on!
- No, no, no. Oh, Lord Jesus,

1790
01:57:42,664 --> 01:57:45,232
let me just get out of this
alive. I'll be a good man.

1791
01:57:45,275 --> 01:57:47,234
Just let me get out of this.

1792
01:57:48,191 --> 01:57:50,672
- [Epps] Whoa!
- [exclaims]

1793
01:57:54,763 --> 01:57:56,286
Move! We got to move!

1794
01:57:56,330 --> 01:57:58,636
Why do the Decepticons
always get the good shit?!

1795
01:57:58,680 --> 01:58:00,769
- We got to move!- We about to be eaten, people!

1796
01:58:00,812 --> 01:58:04,294
[screaming]

1797
01:58:36,892 --> 01:58:39,329
- [Carly screams]
- [yells]

1798
01:58:39,373 --> 01:58:41,201
Agghhhh! Hold on!

1799
01:58:41,244 --> 01:58:43,855
Give me your hand, come on!
Swing that way!

1800
01:58:43,899 --> 01:58:46,336
- I got her!
- Oh, my God!

1801
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:48,556
I'm droppin' you
on the fire escape!

1802
01:59:06,226 --> 01:59:10,143
- Sam!
- Whoa! We got to move!

1803
01:59:23,634 --> 01:59:25,810
I'm coming for you!

1804
02:00:07,156 --> 02:00:09,724
[yells]

1805
02:00:21,388 --> 02:00:24,434
- [Wrecker] Optimus!
- Wreckers!

1806
02:00:24,478 --> 02:00:25,653
We're comin'!

1807
02:00:26,654 --> 02:00:28,830
Decepticons
around the world...

1808
02:00:29,744 --> 02:00:31,833
...launch the pillars.

1809
02:01:02,037 --> 02:01:04,474
[Wheelie] Agh, we are so lost!

1810
02:01:04,518 --> 02:01:06,215
[Brains] Always left out.

1811
02:01:06,259 --> 02:01:09,436
Ooh, ka-ching!

1812
02:01:11,525 --> 02:01:13,091
It's time to lay
down the law.

1813
02:01:13,135 --> 02:01:15,442
About to bring some hurt now.

1814
02:01:22,536 --> 02:01:25,452
[Sam] It's starting!
You see it?

1815
02:01:27,018 --> 02:01:29,369
Whoa! Look out!

1816
02:01:37,812 --> 02:01:39,727
Where are Sam and Carly?

1817
02:01:39,770 --> 02:01:41,337
Um....

1818
02:01:42,164 --> 02:01:44,384
We'll go this way.

1819
02:01:50,259 --> 02:01:54,219
I give you one thing to do.
One thing to do! And you drop
the ball on that?!

1820
02:01:54,263 --> 02:01:55,873
I ain't signed up for all this!

1821
02:01:55,917 --> 02:01:58,049
Got aliens blastin' at me,
runnin' around, chasin' me!

1822
02:01:58,093 --> 02:02:00,965
I'm duckin' through churches
and buildings and all that
kind of crap, man!

1823
02:02:01,009 --> 02:02:03,577
This is bullshit! I ain't
signed up for this, Epps!

1824
02:02:03,620 --> 02:02:05,492
I'm tryin' to keep it together.

1825
02:02:08,582 --> 02:02:11,759
Ooh, what a treat!
You and me alone!

1826
02:02:11,802 --> 02:02:13,804
Carly!

1827
02:02:18,026 --> 02:02:19,723
Come on, come on! Run!

1828
02:02:21,421 --> 02:02:24,119
OK, he's after me,
not you.

1829
02:02:24,162 --> 02:02:26,513
Wait, run! Run!

1830
02:02:28,123 --> 02:02:30,778
You can't hide, boy!

1831
02:02:30,821 --> 02:02:32,867
Come on, come on, run!

1832
02:02:32,910 --> 02:02:37,828
Oh, I just love it when your
little insect feet try to run!

1833
02:02:37,872 --> 02:02:39,613
- Sam!
- Run!

1834
02:02:43,530 --> 02:02:44,618
[yells]

1835
02:02:44,661 --> 02:02:47,055
Thought you were
working for us, boy?!

1836
02:02:51,189 --> 02:02:53,496
No! Sam!

1837
02:03:02,679 --> 02:03:03,854
My eye!

1838
02:03:03,898 --> 02:03:07,510
- [yelling]
- [cackling]

1839
02:03:16,476 --> 02:03:19,609
My eye! Agh! My eye!

1840
02:03:20,915 --> 02:03:22,830
Target the Decepticon!

1841
02:03:30,185 --> 02:03:32,013
Sam!

1842
02:03:36,496 --> 02:03:38,672
Lennox, you've got to save Sam!

1843
02:03:38,715 --> 02:03:40,543
- You've got to save him!
- What the hell's he doin'?

1844
02:03:43,198 --> 02:03:44,852
This better work!

1845
02:03:44,895 --> 02:03:47,637
[man] D-Bots! D-Bots!

1846
02:03:56,037 --> 02:03:57,647
[yelling]

1847
02:03:57,691 --> 02:04:02,043
[shrieking] I can't see!
I can't see!

1848
02:04:02,086 --> 02:04:04,088
- Sam!
- It's on my hand!

1849
02:04:04,132 --> 02:04:05,829
Grab the knife!
Grab the knife!

1850
02:04:05,873 --> 02:04:08,571
- I'm tryin'!
- Knife, knife,
knife, knife, knife!

1851
02:04:08,615 --> 02:04:11,139
Oh, God! The bomb's gonna...

1852
02:04:11,182 --> 02:04:13,141
You human scum!

1853
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:15,273
- We got 20 seconds
on that bomb!
- What bomb?

1854
02:04:15,317 --> 02:04:17,711
See that bomb?
Go on, cut it, cut it!

1855
02:04:17,754 --> 02:04:20,670
I got it! How long do we have?!

1856
02:04:21,236 --> 02:04:23,804
I'm gonna kick you!

1857
02:04:35,903 --> 02:04:37,513
I'm gonna kill y...!

1858
02:04:43,780 --> 02:04:45,826
[both yelling]

1859
02:04:54,225 --> 02:04:57,707
- Well, he's dead.
- Uh-huh.

1860
02:04:57,751 --> 02:05:01,189
Hey, Bee's gonna run with the
rest of the Autobots

1861
02:05:01,232 --> 02:05:03,713
- and meet us
at the edge of the river.
- All right.

1862
02:05:30,348 --> 02:05:34,570
[Wheelie] Hey, it sucked me in!There was nothin' I could do!

1863
02:05:34,614 --> 02:05:36,267
- Uh-oh.
- Ugh.

1864
02:05:36,311 --> 02:05:37,617
This is a total clusterf...!

1865
02:05:37,660 --> 02:05:39,923
We gotta get across the river.

1866
02:05:39,967 --> 02:05:43,492
See that? Now she said
the control pillar was
in that first cupola.

1867
02:05:43,536 --> 02:05:47,061
- All right.
- Let's go! Move! Let's move!

1868
02:05:47,104 --> 02:05:51,979
[man on radio] Tomahawks are
inbound. ETA 20 minutes.

1869
02:05:52,022 --> 02:05:56,723
- I'm in the traffic cameras.
- [man] Four Autobots
are captured.

1870
02:05:57,419 --> 02:05:59,116
Oh, my God.
We're helpless.

1871
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:01,641
Whatever's set to happen, with
those pulses getting faster,

1872
02:06:01,684 --> 02:06:06,341
- it's gonna happen soon.
- [man] No sign of Optimus.

1873
02:06:06,384 --> 02:06:08,648
How do we get
these bridges down?

1874
02:06:09,518 --> 02:06:11,172
Spread out.
Check in there.

1875
02:06:13,827 --> 02:06:16,743
Epps! Epps, been lookin' for
your ass. How you doin'?

1876
02:06:16,786 --> 02:06:19,049
Retirement is wack. Even worse,

1877
02:06:19,093 --> 02:06:23,706
we can't get across the river tothat building and the Autobots
are upstairs, surrounded.

1878
02:06:29,407 --> 02:06:30,800
Just pan the camera around,
all right?

1879
02:06:30,844 --> 02:06:32,976
All right, pan...
pan right. That's you.

1880
02:06:33,020 --> 02:06:36,763
All right, try getting
into the bridge control room.

1881
02:06:38,068 --> 02:06:40,331
[Mearing] What are they doing?
They are just standing there.

1882
02:06:40,375 --> 02:06:44,684
Hang on. Dutch see if you can
hack into the bridge.

1883
02:06:44,727 --> 02:06:46,860
Sir! SEALs are here.

1884
02:06:46,903 --> 02:06:48,775
Uh, it's a good days, boys!
What do you got?

1885
02:06:48,818 --> 02:06:51,865
Got a ten-man SEAL element,
sir, tasked with vectoring
in Tomahawks.

1886
02:06:51,908 --> 02:06:52,996
- How long?
- Fifteen.

1887
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:54,215
You're my prisoners!

1888
02:06:54,258 --> 02:06:57,348
[Sideswipe] Take it easy.
We surrender.

1889
02:06:57,392 --> 02:07:00,656
[Ratchet] Get off me.
Get off me!

1890
02:07:00,700 --> 02:07:04,138
All right, you're gonna need
your 40 mic mics and your
frags. Go full auto.

1891
02:07:04,181 --> 02:07:07,881
The vibrations jack up
their circuits! Snipers,
shoot for the eyes.

1892
02:07:07,924 --> 02:07:10,753
All right, your target's
up on top of that building,
that cupola.

1893
02:07:10,797 --> 02:07:14,278
How doomed you are, Autobots.

1894
02:07:14,322 --> 02:07:16,411
You simply fail to understand

1895
02:07:16,454 --> 02:07:21,372
that the needs of the many
outweigh the needs of the few.

1896
02:07:21,416 --> 02:07:23,897
Activating the bridge.

1897
02:07:32,470 --> 02:07:34,908
[all howling]

1898
02:07:34,951 --> 02:07:37,432
They're happy
about somethin'.

1899
02:07:37,475 --> 02:07:39,303
We're in the heart
of their ship.

1900
02:07:39,347 --> 02:07:41,044
Let's give 'em a little ride.

1901
02:07:41,088 --> 02:07:43,830
Ho-ho! We gonna
screw this ship up!

1902
02:07:43,873 --> 02:07:47,094
It's a 128K
binary encryption code.

1903
02:07:48,269 --> 02:07:49,879
It's difficult.

1904
02:07:49,923 --> 02:07:54,797
But not for me.
I'm in. Bridge down.

1905
02:07:54,841 --> 02:07:57,408
The bridge is comin' down!
Someone's watchin' over us!

1906
02:07:57,452 --> 02:07:59,454
Come on, let's go!

1907
02:07:59,497 --> 02:08:01,891
"Pleasure working
with you, Seymour"...

1908
02:08:01,935 --> 02:08:03,806
...I believe you're
supposed to say.

1909
02:08:03,850 --> 02:08:08,768
- Good job, Dutch.
- Danke schoen.

1910
02:08:12,946 --> 02:08:15,035
Get off me!

1911
02:08:38,972 --> 02:08:43,106
Hurry! They're
triggering the pillars!

1912
02:08:43,150 --> 02:08:45,543
Prisoners?
You're keeping prisoners?

1913
02:08:45,587 --> 02:08:47,545
Yes.

1914
02:08:47,589 --> 02:08:49,373
You need to teach them
about respect.

1915
02:08:49,417 --> 02:08:52,289
This was all business,
but now it's personal.
Do you understand me?

1916
02:08:52,333 --> 02:08:55,510
[Chuckles] I understand.

1917
02:08:55,553 --> 02:08:58,774
No prisoners. Only trophies.

1918
02:08:58,818 --> 02:09:02,996
Bee... I think they're
going to kill us.

1919
02:09:04,214 --> 02:09:07,565
- You. Your time is up.
- Wait, wait, wait!

1920
02:09:07,609 --> 02:09:09,785
We surrendered!
We're your prisoners.

1921
02:09:09,829 --> 02:09:11,656
- Move it!
- Can't we talk this out?

1922
02:09:11,700 --> 02:09:15,443
We're all a bunch of good chaps!I mean, you know...

1923
02:09:15,486 --> 02:09:17,401
[grunts]

1924
02:09:17,445 --> 02:09:20,274
Why did you...? Agh!

1925
02:09:20,317 --> 02:09:25,192
[cackling]

1926
02:09:27,455 --> 02:09:30,501
Goodbye, my old friend.

1927
02:09:30,545 --> 02:09:33,026
You're mine now.

1928
02:09:45,734 --> 02:09:48,824
- Get off me!
- I gotta help him.

1929
02:09:48,868 --> 02:09:50,870
What? What are you doing?

1930
02:09:50,913 --> 02:09:54,525
- I gotta help him.
- Sam, you can't help him.

1931
02:09:54,569 --> 02:09:56,223
Sam!

1932
02:10:02,620 --> 02:10:04,492
Turn around!

1933
02:10:13,762 --> 02:10:15,982
We gave 'em a hell of a run.

1934
02:10:31,127 --> 02:10:33,651
[Wheelie] We did it,
Brains, we did it!

1935
02:10:33,695 --> 02:10:36,045
Rip this ship apart!

1936
02:11:13,648 --> 02:11:17,086
- We had a nice run,
Brains, you and me.
- Yeah, we gonna die.

1937
02:11:31,492 --> 02:11:36,149
Come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa!OK, baby! You all come with us!

1938
02:11:36,192 --> 02:11:39,456
Go! You guys, follow
that ground team! Go!

1939
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:43,460
- Move, move, move!
- Epps, third floor!
We're goin' to 45!

1940
02:11:48,857 --> 02:11:50,990
All right, give me
two snipers right here!

1941
02:11:52,295 --> 02:11:53,993
All right, dock up!

1942
02:11:55,211 --> 02:11:57,344
We jump in three minutes!

1943
02:12:00,216 --> 02:12:02,175
Set up shop right here.

1944
02:12:06,527 --> 02:12:09,225
All right, set up.

1945
02:12:09,269 --> 02:12:13,534
I'm downstairs. And we got
five targets and Shockwave
right below us.

1946
02:12:13,577 --> 02:12:15,318
Stand by to jump!

1947
02:12:15,362 --> 02:12:17,973
All right, let's go!
Get ready, get ready.

1948
02:12:31,378 --> 02:12:33,075
Go!

1949
02:12:42,563 --> 02:12:45,000
Snipers, take out their eyes.

1950
02:12:48,047 --> 02:12:50,179
All right, demo team,
let's crank steel.

1951
02:12:57,926 --> 02:12:59,580
Turning steel!

1952
02:13:25,998 --> 02:13:27,390
[yelling]

1953
02:13:36,008 --> 02:13:38,184
Don't fire till I tell you!

1954
02:13:47,932 --> 02:13:50,196
Go!

1955
02:13:51,110 --> 02:13:53,242
All right, good job, kid!

1956
02:13:53,286 --> 02:13:54,635
Fire!

1957
02:14:06,603 --> 02:14:08,475
- We got him!
- Yeah!

1958
02:14:09,519 --> 02:14:11,260
He's on the run!

1959
02:14:13,001 --> 02:14:15,221
Autobots, attack!

1960
02:14:20,008 --> 02:14:22,315
Mortar that bridge!

1961
02:14:26,058 --> 02:14:31,498
It's our world now!
Commence transport!

1962
02:14:43,336 --> 02:14:46,165
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1963
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:55,522
