1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,480
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,000
Monsters are coming, Mr. Mayor,
who will cleanse this city.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,080
If you sell me your company,

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,520
I will give you the name of the man
who killed your parents.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,240
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Bruce's friend.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,320
And you're a piece of gutter trash.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,440
You think that little minx is gonna
tell you something, do you?

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,040
Getting information
out of a girl like that requires

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,160
a level of deception
that you do not yet possess.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,920
- You're under arrest.
- May I ask what the charge is?

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,360
The kidnapping
and torture of Aubrey James.

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,520
These were Ms. Kringle's.

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,160
A man with nothing to love is free.

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,560
Hey, Parks, you did good today.

15
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,600
Eduardo Flamingo killed Officer Parks

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,080
before they could
get him into lockup.

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,800
Bruce Wayne will die
and his company will be ours.

18
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,960
Everything is ready.

19
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,720
The brothers arrival is imminent.

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,560
Gotham will be redeemed in blood.

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,000
- Please don't hurt me!
- Shut up!

22
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,520
Forget your umbrella?

23
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,480
Thought visiting hours were over.

24
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,680
But what are rules to the man
who arrested the mayor of Gotham?

25
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,120
Any chance you're gonna tell me
what this little visit is about?

26
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,320
Tomorrow's hearing perhaps?

27
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,760
You're here to gloat.

28
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,520
Does the name Catherine Parks
mean anything to you?

29
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,120
No, can't say it does.

30
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm gonna be there tomorrow.

31
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,320
I'm gonna watch them put you away.

32
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,600
Always a pleasure, detective.

33
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,840
-Hey.
-Hey.

34
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,120
You're soaking wet.

35
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,280
Do you wanna talk about it?

36
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,000
Catherine Parks was 23.

37
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,080
On the force a year.

38
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,840
Today we put her in the ground

39
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,320
because when I had the chance

40
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,080
I didn't do the only sensible thing.

41
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,400
- Jim.
- An assassin kills four cops.

42
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,560
Dares me to pull the trigger
and I don't.

43
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,120
Explain that to me.

44
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,840
That man was your prisoner.
You didn't have a choice.

45
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
I had a choice.

46
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,720
Yes, to uphold the law
or to become a murderer.

47
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,600
You made the right one.

48
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,560
You think Catherine Parks
feels the same way?

49
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,920
What about her family?

50
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,840
I went to see Galavan today.

51
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,320
And?

52
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,840
You're asking did I get the guards
to turn the cameras off? No.

53
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,040
But they would have.

54
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,480
Galavan as good as killed Parks,
Essen and a dozen other cops

55
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,920
and yet he sits there.

56
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,160
Smiling. Breathing.

57
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,840
And tomorrow, Aubrey James
is going in front of the grand jury

58
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,360
telling them that he was kidnapped
and tortured by Galavan.

59
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,840
He's gonna be put away
for a long time.

60
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,920
Maybe.

61
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,880
Just the way he acted

62
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,200
it wasn't a man looking at
a decade in prison.

63
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,800
- I have a bad feeling.
- Jim, it's over.

64
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,080
You did good.

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,440
Now, come to bed. Doctor's orders.

66
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,560
Where am I?

67
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,080
Who are you?

68
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,720
Day of reckoning is at hand.

69
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,240
The blood of the nine
shall wash away the sins.

70
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,960
Wait. Please.

71
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,600
And Gotham will be cleansed.

72
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,880
This isn't gonna work.

73
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,880
{\an5}This girl is a world-class liar
from a family of world-class liars.

74
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,720
{\an5}She'll see through you.
Or her uncle will.

75
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,120
Well, it's very possible.

76
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,800
{\an5}And?

77
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,880
{\an5}Bruce, they're playing nice with you
because they think you trust them.

78
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,560
{\an5}Once they see you don't,
it'll get ugly fast.

79
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,320
{\an5}- Your logic is flawless, Selina.
- It's not too late.

80
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,360
{\an5}If there's even a chance
Galavan knows who killed my parents,

81
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,840
{\an5}I have to take it.

82
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,760
{\an5}I told Alfred I have fencing
practice after school

83
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,560
{\an5}to buy us time if we need it.

84
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
Hey.

85
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,280
{\an5}The best liars always tell the truth.

86
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,360
{\an5}- Something to remember.
- Thank you.

87
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,160
That's her car. You better...

88
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,920
{\an5}Alvarez, call the morgue.

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,800
{\an5}See if any bodies turned up
matching Gertrud Kapelput.

90
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,960
{\an5}She didn't just vanish.

91
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,120
{\an5}- Galavan killed her.
- Did that yesterday.

92
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,360
{\an5}And you're gonna do it again today.

93
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,240
{\an5}I got my own cases, Gordon.

94
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,640
{\an5}Turn up anything on that symbol
we found in the penthouse?

95
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,640
{\an5}No, I'm waiting for Father Mike
up at St. Bart's.

96
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,480
{\an5}Sent him a picture
of the cassock too.

97
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,840
{\an5}He's up on all that religious
mumbo jumbo.

98
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,320
{\an5}What exactly are we after here?

99
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,680
{\an5}Something tying Galavan
to the murders of Essen, Parks,

100
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,360
{\an5}any of the people he killed.

101
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,200
{\an5}Not to state the obvious, Jim
but the guy is going to jail.

102
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,840
{\an5}- I went to see him last night.
- Yeah?

103
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,760
{\an5}Get the guards
to turn off the camera?

104
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,440
{\an5}The look on his face, Harvey

105
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,480
{\an5}- I don't know. I can't describe it.
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

106
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,760
The guy get stabbed, I thought
we'd have at least a week of peace.

107
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,880
Hey, cap, how you doing?
Did you get my flowers?

108
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,400
- Captain, how you feeling?
- Five by five.

109
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,000
Damn doc would've had me
in bed a week if I had let him.

110
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,200
Got something for you.

111
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,640
Munis found a dead body
down by the port.

112
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,160
Throat cut from ear to ear.

113
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,160
The vic's a career dirt bag
but the work's...

114
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,240
Sir, if it's all the same,
I'd like to stay on Galavan.

115
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,200
It isn't. Galavan's cooked.

116
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,200
So you're back on the rotation. What?

117
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,280
I just feel like
we're missing something, sir.

118
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,000
There's some piece of the puzzle
that's gonna come back and bite us.

119
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,240
Just give me a few more days.

120
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,520
Answer's no. Be pissed.
But it's for your own good.

121
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh, and I'm sorry about Parks.
She deserved better.

122
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,760
Yo, Jim.

123
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,400
A message from Father Mike.

124
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,120
That symbol is from something
called the Order of St. Dumas.

125
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,000
They used to have an abbey downtown.

126
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,400
Barnes just told me
to lay off Galavan.

127
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,240
Well, then you probably don't care

128
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,440
that the mayor's office tried
to buy the abbey last week.

129
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,480
- Galavan tried to buy it?
- Yeah.

130
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,920
Some urban development nonsense.
New owner said no.

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,440
It's a Chinese slap-slap joint now.

132
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,520
- Hell with it. You got the address?
- Yeah. Let's go get lucky.

133
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,880
Your uncle made me an offer.

134
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,440
The name of my parents killer

135
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,880
in exchange for selling him
my shares of Wayne Enterprises.

136
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,320
I said no.
But circumstances have changed.

137
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,800
You're going to sell?

138
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,320
- No.
- Then...

139
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,960
Your uncle was arrested
and his assets were frozen.

140
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,160
Tell him I'll pay for his defense.
In exchange, he gives me the name.

141
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,240
You're taking advantage of him.

142
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,960
I have something he needs,
he has something I need. That's all.

143
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,040
Do you believe what people
are saying about him?

144
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,040
I don't care what people say.

145
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,720
My father was investigating
Wayne Enterprises

146
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,880
then he and my mother were killed.

147
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,840
I investigated Wayne Enterprises
and someone tried to kill Alfred.

148
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,200
Either I find out
who killed my parents

149
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,600
and stop whatever's happening
in my company, or I'm dead.

150
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,800
I need that name.

151
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,520
The grand jury hearing is today.

152
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,560
- He's going to be cleared.
- What if he's not? What then?

153
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,680
Silver, get him to tell you the name.

154
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,800
And I will make sure he has the best
defense money can buy, I promise.

155
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,160
You think he's guilty.

156
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,480
Why would you believe
anything he says?

157
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,920
Because it would come from you.

158
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,320
If you bring me the name,
I'll know it's real.

159
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Do you mean that?

160
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,640
I'll call you after I talk to him.

161
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,160
Still gotta get the name.

162
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,720
I will. I'm late for school.

163
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,960
Not yet.

164
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,920
Are you sure about this?

165
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,440
Doesn't look much
like a massage parlor.

166
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,120
Maybe there's another entrance?

167
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,760
- Get these girls out of here.
- Come on, come on, come on.

168
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,280
GCPD.

169
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,640
Sir?

170
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,280
Stop!

171
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,720
Drop the knife.

172
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,160
The day of reckoning is at hand,

173
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,320
and the blood of nine
shall wash away the sin.

174
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,400
Who are you?
What's your connection to Galavan?

175
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,520
And Gotham shall be cleansed.

176
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,200
Hey. Hey!

177
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,800
The girls at the parlor say
they saw at least six monks.

178
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,800
They have to be a part of the same
Order of Saint Dumas.

179
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,880
Bullock's contact says
they're penitents.

180
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,280
Yeah, I forgot my dictionary
in my purse.

181
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,480
They believed in purification
through pain.

182
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,440
Blood.

183
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,960
They were big in the old days
in Gotham.

184
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,560
And about a hundred years ago,
vanished.

185
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,640
It was their crest we found
in Galavan's penthouse.

186
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,040
And now, they're back
and they're pissed off

187
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,800
that their home's a high-end
rub and tug joint.

188
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,640
Fine. Gather what you have
and give it to Alvarez.

189
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,480
Captain, these monks could be the key
to what Galavan is planning.

190
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,640
As I recall, detective,
I already gave you a case

191
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,560
and I expressly told you
to move away from Galavan.

192
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,960
The dead guy at the ports.

193
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,720
He attacked a woman
across town yesterday.

194
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,680
In her statement,
she said her attacker was pulled off

195
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,120
by man a dressed like a monk.

196
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,280
Does the universe normally
like you this much, Detective?

197
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,560
First time.

198
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,640
All right,
say they're the same monks.

199
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,480
Why would they kill
a bunch of bankers

200
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,720
and some nobody street thug?

201
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,520
The monk said, "The blood of the nine
shall wash away the sin."

202
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,320
It's obviously some sort of ritual.

203
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,920
And if Galavan is connected

204
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,920
what does he stand to gain?

205
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,040
I don't know.

206
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,280
We have to find a monk
and get him to talk.

207
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,280
Considering what this last one did,
that might not be so easy.

208
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,240
Captain, it's no coincidence
that this is happening

209
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,600
just as Galavan's
about to stand trial.

210
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,280
Whatever it is,
it's going down today.

211
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,360
The blood of the nine.
Five are already dead.

212
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,400
Okay.

213
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,640
But I still want you at the grand
jury to hear James testimony.

214
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,680
And Gordon,
whatever this is, stop it.

215
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,480
<i>Bruce, it's Silver.
I just saw my uncle.</i>

216
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,720
<i>He agreed to your deal,
everything you asked.</i>

217
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,920
<i>He told me the name, Bruce.
Meet me across the way after school.</i>

218
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,720
Don't scream. Don't run.

219
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,640
Just get in, or we kill the girl.

220
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
Go.

221
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,440
The scar tissue's old.

222
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,600
See how the wounds wrap
over his shoulder?

223
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,880
It was definitely self-inflicted.

224
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,040
When I stabbed him, he didn't flinch.

225
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,960
And there are thick
scars on the palms.

226
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,800
He cut himself there repeatedly.

227
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,960
Father Mike said
the leaders cut themselves

228
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,920
and mark the followers
with their blood.

229
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,400
- Like a blessing.
- Charming.

230
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,920
They got two more bodies
from the past three days.

231
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Career hoods.

232
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,960
Killed somewhere, then dumped.
Both their throats cut.

233
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,800
- Seven down, two to go.
- It's weird.

234
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,520
How has nobody seen
these monks till now?

235
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,960
A, they're killing people
and carrying them across town,

236
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,920
and B, they are monks.

237
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,440
The woman who was attacked yesterday,

238
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,920
she said the monk vanished
with the attacker.

239
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,360
But that alley was a dead end.

240
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,600
The sewers.

241
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
Oh, no.

242
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,920
So the monk drags
the woman's attacker

243
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,800
into the alley above us.

244
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,040
Next thing, he's food for seagulls.

245
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,600
Ports are this way.

246
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,400
Again?

247
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,640
Well, did you try
jiggling the handle?

248
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,800
Well, what did you put down it?

249
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,320
- Dr. Thompkins, can I help you?
- Hi, Ed.

250
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,840
This is the autopsy on the dead monk.

251
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,000
Jim wants you to run toxicology.

252
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,400
Fascinating. The need to inflict
that kind of pain on one's self.

253
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,520
Is there anything else?

254
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,240
No. Yes.

255
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
Was that Kristen
you were just talking to?

256
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,880
- What?
- Sorry.

257
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,240
It sounded like you were talking
to somebody in your apartment.

258
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,840
- And who besides?
- I was talking to my plumber.

259
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,720
Have you heard from Kristen?

260
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,840
I know she said she was sick.

261
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,600
- I was thinking of...
- As it happens, she is not sick.

262
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,880
She lied, to all of us.

263
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,440
I just found out Miss Kringle
left town with Officer Dougherty.

264
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,560
She left Gotham with Dougherty?

265
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,000
But he was abusive.

266
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,600
Love.

267
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,440
I'm... I'm stunned.

268
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,520
- Do you need to get that?
- No, I don't think so.

269
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,560
Oh, Ed, you must be devastated.

270
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,680
Right now, I'm just trying
to focus on the job.

271
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,480
Well, let me know
if you ever wanna talk.

272
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,240
Thank you. That means a lot.

273
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,120
- Yes?
<i>- Where is the spicy mustard?</i>

274
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,760
You better not have finished...

275
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
Never mind.

276
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,560
Silver, are you okay? What happened?

277
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,680
You have one chance. You let us go.

278
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,960
You talk when I tell you to.

279
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,680
Understand?

280
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,720
Now, so you know,
we are outside of the city

281
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,440
and there is absolutely no one
to hear you scream except me.

282
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,280
You work for the people
inside Wayne Enterprises.

283
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,920
Whoever's paying you...

284
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,720
Again, you talk when I tell you to.

285
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,920
Now, my employers have heard

286
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,760
that you are thinking of selling
your company's shares

287
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,280
to the uncle of this one.

288
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,800
That's not good.

289
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,000
But not why we're here.

290
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,680
The issue is someone's been
nosing into the deaths

291
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,560
of Thomas and poor Martha Wayne.

292
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,440
And I wonder who.

293
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Kidding.

294
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,680
We know it was Blondie's uncle.

295
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,240
So I've been tasked to find out

296
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,480
what dear old uncle
told little Bruce Wayne.

297
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,920
Nothing.
Galavan didn't tell me anything.

298
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,960
You think that I won't hurt you
because you're a kid?

299
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,520
Or because you're you?

300
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,760
How did that work out
for your mommy and daddy?

301
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,480
There are billions at stake here.

302
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,080
And that's with a B.

303
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,840
Do what you want to me.

304
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,720
- I don't know anything.
- Okay, so we start with Goldilocks.

305
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,400
You touch and I swear...

306
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,680
Yeah? I've been threatened
by the best, kid.

307
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,800
And you are not exactly terrifying.

308
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,960
Now, let me tell you
how this is going to go.

309
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:07,200
In a minute, I'm gonna take
one of you into the back

310
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,360
and start cutting off your fingers.

311
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,880
And you're gonna talk.

312
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,600
I've been doing this a very,
very long time and everyone talks.

313
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,640
So unless you're really
into wearing mittens,

314
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,200
this is your last chance.

315
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,280
What does Theo Galavan know?

316
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,600
Okey-dokey.

317
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,160
- Let's go.
- No! No! No!

318
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,200
No! Stop! Stop! Stop! Silver.

319
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,440
You have to tell them.
I'll hold my side of the deal.

320
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,160
Please. Please. I promise.

321
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,120
But my uncle didn't tell me anything.

322
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,640
But you left me a message.

323
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,200
I was supposed to keep you busy
until this evening.

324
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,320
He's sure he's going to be freed,

325
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,080
then he'll convince you
to sell your company.

326
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,880
I'm sorry, Bruce.
I don't know anything.

327
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,400
- Really?
- I don't!

328
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,640
That's a pity.

329
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,360
- No.
- No.

330
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,280
- Kids. Kids.
- No, please!

331
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,600
You really need
better taste in women.

332
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,360
- No!
- Please! Help me!

333
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,520
Stop. Bruce!

334
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,000
Just when you think Gotham's
shown her last jewel

335
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,000
she reveals herself like a flower.

336
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,800
You're mixing metaphors.

337
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,600
I'm in a freaking sewer.

338
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,000
Do you hear something?

339
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,160
It's a voice.

340
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,720
I know this bum. Muscle for hire.

341
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,920
Check out the finger painting
on the forehead.

342
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,280
The victim at the port
had the same thing.

343
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,200
Like a blessing.

344
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,040
Whoever did this can't be
too far away. We should...

345
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,120
Harvey.

346
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,560
Oh, no, no, no.
Please, please, don't. Hold.

347
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,800
He needs an ambulance.

348
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,480
We gotta wake him up
and make him talk.

349
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,160
Religious fanatic who doesn't feel
pain? What's our angle?

350
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,240
These nutjobs
have killed eight people.

351
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,000
Whatever their plan is,
whatever Galavan's up to,

352
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,280
it is happening now.

353
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,800
- We make him talk.
- What are we gonna do? Torture him?

354
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,880
Threaten to let him die?
He wouldn't care.

355
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,600
There's no signal down here.
I'll call it in but I gotta go up.

356
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,320
- Thank you.
- God!

357
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,840
The day of reckoning.

358
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,680
The day of reckoning, brother.

359
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,840
Bruce.

360
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,720
Well, if nothing else

361
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:39,240
today has given me a newfound
respect for boy billionaires.

362
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,400
Kid's tougher than he looks.
Didn't know a damn thing.

363
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,160
Did you kill him?

364
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,840
No. Not yet.

365
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,040
But the rest is kind of up to you.

366
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,760
I told you.

367
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,480
My uncle didn't tell me anything.

368
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,400
- Are you gonna stick to that story?
- It's the truth.

369
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,680
Bruce, I'm sorry.
I don't know anything.

370
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,760
You know...

371
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,560
I don't like you.

372
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,000
The Wayne kid,
he's got some sap in him.

373
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,640
But you, you know
when you meet someone,

374
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,280
and you just don't click?

375
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,800
That's the way I feel about you.

376
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,240
That's why this is gonna be
so much easier.

377
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,840
What are you doing?

378
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,080
I'm gonna make sure
that you are telling the truth.

379
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,760
Touch me and my uncle
will have you gutted.

380
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,960
Every person you love
will die screaming.

381
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,240
I've had enough of this.
Let me go now!

382
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,880
Well, hello!

383
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,000
Nice to meet you.

384
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,600
I knew there was someone
hiding in there.

385
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:55,800
Are you deaf as well as ugly?
I said, let me go!

386
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,520
I heard you, princess.

387
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,480
What are you doing? Stop!

388
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,120
Malone! It's Malone.

389
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,200
- What's that?
- Malone. That's the name.

390
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,800
The man who killed
Bruce Wayne's parents.

391
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,560
- So your uncle did tell you?
- Not today, before

392
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,040
when he first found out.

393
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,280
Malone's a very common name.

394
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,480
His first name begins with M.
That's all I know.

395
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,920
- Stop!
- You know what?

396
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,160
I believe you.

397
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,040
Are we good?

398
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,640
Yes.

399
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
We're good.

400
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,280
Hey.

401
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,280
Remember me? The gutter trash?

402
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,760
Bruce.

403
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,480
- What's happening?
- What does it look like, dummy?

404
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,120
We tricked you.

405
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,800
Though, if it was up to me,
you would have lost a few fingers.

406
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,240
- Going soft, Tom?
- Can't.

407
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,040
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. Wayne.

408
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,320
Pleasure doing business.
Sorry for the slaps.

409
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,920
Now, you two gonna be
okay with this one?

410
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,440
Or would you like me to...

411
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,840
No. We're cool.

412
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,920
Mr. Wayne. Boys.

413
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,560
You're probably
very confused right now.

414
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Probably have a million questions
going through your head.

415
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,120
- Bruce, please.
- Be quiet.

416
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,720
I trusted you, Silver.

417
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,360
Even after your uncle was arrested,
I still believed you were my friend.

418
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,040
It was finally Selina
who convinced me otherwise.

419
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,800
I never bought your stupid act.

420
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,760
She broke into your apartment,
found the file you had on me.

421
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,280
It was clear you'd been sent
to push me to sell my company.

422
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,520
That your entire family was corrupt.

423
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,920
But I still had to find out
what your uncle

424
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,040
knew about my parents murder.

425
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,360
Now, I do.

426
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,840
- Thank you.
- Bruce.

427
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,320
Wait. That name wasn't real.

428
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,320
It was just something
I made up to stop him.

429
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,680
That's funny.

430
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,000
You only made it up
when you were under the knife.

431
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,480
Not when Bruce was getting tortured.

432
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,120
- You little bitch...
- Please.

433
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,560
Try it.

434
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,360
You're right about my uncle.

435
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,400
He's everything everyone says.

436
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,720
Worse.

437
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,880
When he finds out what I told you,
he'll kill me.

438
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,440
You pretended to be my friend.

439
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,200
Goodbye, Silver.

440
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,480
Bruce.

441
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,760
The things you told me today.

442
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,040
I believed you.

443
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,400
Yes.

444
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,720
- That was the point.
- Bruce, you can't do this.

445
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,840
It isn't you.

446
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,880
That's what you think.

447
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,480
But you're wrong.

448
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,920
Bruce.

449
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,240
Bruce. Bruce!

450
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,840
The ambulance...

451
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,200
Drink brother.

452
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,560
- Can't see.
- You are hurt.

453
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,400
- Lay still.
- The police.

454
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,600
Dead. We got here just in time.

455
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,680
The blood of the nine...

456
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,720
Shall wash away the sin.

457
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,680
I fulfilled my task, brother.

458
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,440
All that remains is the son.

459
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,600
Yes. The son?

460
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,000
Give me your blessing, brother.

461
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Please.

462
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,560
The Son of Gotham shall die...

463
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,880
and the city shall be cleansed.

464
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,000
Detective, where's the?

465
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,320
What?

466
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,680
- Who are you?
- GCPD. You're under arrest.

467
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,360
Take him to a hospital.
See if you can get anything from him.

468
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,120
I gotta see Barnes.

469
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,240
Bruce?

470
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,400
Bruce, you in here?

471
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,600
Master Bruce.

472
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,120
Master B, you here?

473
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,760
You're trespassing.

474
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,240
I'm looking for Bruce Wayne.

475
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,600
He's not answering his phone.

476
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,240
He's not at home. He's not at school.

477
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,480
My guess, he's with that
snotty little niece of yours.

478
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,160
Sorry.

479
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,880
Now, I suggest you leave
while you still can.

480
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,840
I see you're a bit of a player,
are you?

481
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,480
As it were, then, Tabby.

482
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,400
Big, bad Galavan barks the orders
and you scamper around

483
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,480
bringing him dead rabbits,

484
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,200
so you might get
a little pat on the head.

485
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,960
I wonder what he'd do
if I just disappeared you.

486
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,240
Honestly, I don't think he'd care.

487
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,000
If I learn anything's happened
to that little boy

488
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,200
we'll find out, won't we?

489
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,160
Stop it!

490
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,560
For the record,
I was telling the truth.

491
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,720
I have no idea where Bruce Wayne is.

492
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,560
But I'll tell him you were asking.

493
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,000
Mr. Dent, your witness.

494
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,120
So Mayor James...

495
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,000
Excuse me, Mr. Dent.

496
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,560
I think you mean former mayor.

497
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,000
I'm just a citizen of Gotham,
here to tell the truth.

498
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,320
Mr. James.

499
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,920
If you could begin by telling us

500
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,120
where you spent the month
of October this year.

501
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,000
Where the hell have you been?

502
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,920
Bullock and I captured
one of the monks.

503
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I was right. They're completing
some sort of ritual

504
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,960
to cleanse the city of sin.

505
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,360
They have one victim left.

506
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,040
They're calling him
the Son of Gotham.

507
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,040
Did they say anything about Galavan?

508
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,200
- I was not kidnapped...
- They didn't, did they?

509
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,960
Quiet.

510
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,960
Mr. James,
please repeat what you've said.

511
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,680
Theo Galavan did not kidnap me.

512
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,040
Your Honor,
the witness has suffered...

513
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,040
Please explain yourself, sir.

514
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,200
Why did you lie?
Who held you captive?

515
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,360
Oswald Cobblepot, the Penguin.

516
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,880
He hates Theo Galavan.

517
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,640
He tried to kill him multiple times.

518
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,520
He told me what to say.

519
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,640
He threatened me
with terrible things.

520
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,960
- He's lying!
- Gordon. Gordon!

521
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,240
- Detective Gordon, silence!
- Your Honor

522
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,960
I move my client be released at once.

523
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,680
Your Honor,
the State requests a recess...

524
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,000
Quiet!

525
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,480
Mr. James, you do realize
you are under oath?

526
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,920
Oswald Cobblepot

527
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,960
tortured me, put my head in a box

528
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,960
and made me lie.

529
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,480
I'm so very, very sorry.

530
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,320
In light of Mr. James testimony

531
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,240
and the complete absence of any other
evidence provided by the State

532
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,520
I hereby order Theo Galavan released

533
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,640
and the case against him dismissed.

534
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,120
- Your Honor!
- There's nothing we can do.

535
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,920
Your Honor, may I say a few words?

536
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,080
I think that's only fair.

537
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,240
I'd just like to state that...

538
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,200
I harbor no ill will toward
Detective Gordon

539
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,160
or the GCPD.

540
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,640
They did their jobs.

541
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,320
They're still my heroes.

542
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,120
What do you say, Detective Gordon?

543
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,520
Can we move forward together

544
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:54,120
to fix this broken, beautiful city?

545
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,840
- Hey! Hey!
- You son of a bitch!

546
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,160
- Officers, arrest him.
- You're a son of a bitch!

547
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,640
I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you!

548
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,880
Come on! Get your hands off of me!

549
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,240
Relax! We're not arresting you.

550
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,320
Alfred?

551
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,600
He's probably out looking for me.

552
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,760
Thank you, Selina.

553
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,960
I couldn't have done
this without you.

554
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,880
I was just glad to see
the two-faced bitch get served.

555
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,760
What are you gonna do now?

556
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,520
You gonna tell the cops,
or look for this Malone guy yourself?

557
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,080
Honestly,
I haven't thought that far ahead.

558
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,680
So, when you whispered to her...

559
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,280
before she went to her uncle,
what did you say?

560
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,680
You wanna know what I said?

561
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,480
Hey, If you don't wanna tell me,
I can leave.

562
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,440
I told her I've never met
anyone like her.

563
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,240
I told her I trusted her
with my life.

564
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,280
And that I felt tied to her in a way

565
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,400
that I couldn't explain
but wouldn't change.

566
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,680
Ever.

567
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,640
The best liars always tell the truth.

568
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,400
That was true?

569
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,280
Yes.

570
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,200
Just not about her.

571
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,760
I'm... I'm gonna steal
one of your cars

572
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,720
to take to the city. Cool?

573
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,120
Sure.

574
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,400
It's good you're changing.

575
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,000
Just don't change too much.

576
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,000
Why did you keep her glasses
to begin with?

577
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,120
I told you...

578
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,360
I loved Ms. Kringle.

579
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,680
Just get rid of them.
Dr. Thompkins is suspicious.

580
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,400
Amateurs.

581
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,280
Gabe, when I gave you this address,
I was not inviting pop-ins.

582
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,840
Galavan's been let go.

583
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,960
Where is he?

584
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,040
My, my.
What a difference a day brings.

585
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,560
Here, you're the prisoner
and I'm free.

586
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,320
Fortune's wheel.

587
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,720
Turn, turn.

588
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,400
These cops, good men.

589
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,520
You can tell which way
the wind's blowing.

590
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,640
Now, we have a very small window.

591
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,320
I have places to be, you have to die.

592
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,000
But I know you must
have questions, so...

593
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:32,880
The monks. They work for you?

594
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,160
For centuries

595
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,200
the Order of St. Dumas
has protected my family.

596
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,800
They have been a light
in a dark world.

597
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,120
Shall I tell you a secret?

598
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,320
Theo Galavan is a mask.

599
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,320
My name is Dumas and my family
built this city out of nothing.

600
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,040
But we were betrayed,
driven out, erased.

601
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,800
So that's all this is about.

602
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,880
- Revenge.
- No.

603
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,520
This is about atonement.

604
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,160
The ground that Gotham
is built on is poisoned

605
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,280
by the wrongs done to my forefathers.

606
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,840
I will change that.

607
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,160
By killing nine random people?
You're insane.

608
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,080
I can see why you'd think so.

609
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,600
Ritual blood sacrifices,

610
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,960
a bunch of guys in robes,
chanting prophecies.

611
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,040
It's a bit too...

612
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,800
But belief itself,
that's what matters, detective.

613
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,360
Belief gives strength. Purpose.

614
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,400
And not all the victims are random.

615
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,000
Son of Gotham.

616
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,760
Goodbye, James.

617
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,600
I couldn't have done it without you.

618
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,840
What the hell?

619
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,520
I have a few minutes. Cut him loose.

620
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,920
Come on, Jim, give it your best shot.
Save Gotham.

621
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,640
Kill him.

622
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,880
Don't make it quick.

623
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,560
Alfred? Is that you?
You won't believe what I learned...

624
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,200
Sorry. Not Alfred.

625
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,080
Hello, Jim.

626
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,920
Lucky for you,
Gabe had people following Galavan.

627
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,480
Now, where is he?

628
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,400
Where's Galavan?

629
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,240
Tell me! Where is Galavan?

630
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,200
You've shown mettle
and ingenuity, my boy.

631
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,520
But that's all done with.

632
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,480
What do you want?

633
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,840
Why, your life, of course.
