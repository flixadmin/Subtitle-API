Oh, oh.

What... what was he gonna say?

994
00:39:47,942 --> 00:39:51,343
And we're all like, "What was he gonna say?"

995
00:39:51,345 --> 00:39:54,279
That's cool, though. I'm starving.

Did Barry say anything about

this embarrassing moment with Cecile?

1002

How did your first meeting go
with the new Wells?

1005
00:40:10,231 --> 00:40:12,397
[chuckles] Uh, good.

1006
00:40:12,399 --> 00:40:14,299
Yeah, I think he'll work out fine.

Oh, good. I look forward to meeting him.

for me to get used to that.

Um...

1014
00:40:25,312 --> 00:40:27,679
I actually have something
to run by you guys that

1015
00:40:27,681 --> 00:40:28,981
- I think might help with that.
- Really?

1016
00:40:28,983 --> 00:40:30,883
- Yeah.
- What up?

1017
00:40:30,885 --> 00:40:33,418
Well, I've just been thinking
that maybe for all of us...

1018
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:36,722
that I should probably, um...

1019
00:40:36,724 --> 00:40:38,790
get my own place.

1020
00:40:38,792 --> 00:40:40,025
- Really?
- Yeah.

1021
00:40:40,027 --> 00:40:41,693
What do you think?

1022
00:40:42,997 --> 00:40:45,364
- I say yes.
- I thought you'd never leave.

I can't tell if I'm leaving

00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:53,705
or if I'm getting kicked out.

- Feel like I'm

1030
00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:57,109
- getting kicked out.
- I mean, yeah, I feel like

1031
00:40:57,111 --> 00:40:58,110
you're getting kicked out too.

1032

Like, it's pretty obvious

1033

you're getting kicked out.
