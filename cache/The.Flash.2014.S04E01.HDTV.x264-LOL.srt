1
00:00:01,852 --> 00:00:03,482
<i>Last season on "The Flash"...</i>

2
00:00:03,484 --> 00:00:04,539
Iris West,

3
00:00:06,023 --> 00:00:08,154
- will you marry me?
- Yes.

4
00:00:08,156 --> 00:00:10,123
I'm not Caitlin anymore.

5
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:11,992
- You're not Killer Frost.
- I'm not.

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,493
I'm something else,

7
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:15,763
and I need to figure out
what that is on my own.

8
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:17,130
Cecile Horton,

9
00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:18,799
I love you.

10
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,248
<i>That is definitely not a breach.</i>

11
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,917
The Speed Force is unbalanced.

12
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,320
- This is Speed Force Prison.
- Without a prisoner...

13
00:00:29,388 --> 00:00:31,856
- It goes unstable.
- How do we stop this?

14
00:00:34,648 --> 00:00:36,093
<i>My name is Iris West,</i>

15
00:00:36,095 --> 00:00:39,030
<i>and I was supposed to marry
the fastest man alive,</i>

16
00:00:39,064 --> 00:00:40,657
<i>but six months ago, he left.</i>

17
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,789
Barry, it's time.

18
00:00:44,857 --> 00:00:47,024
Barry.

19
00:00:47,092 --> 00:00:50,845
This isn't fair. We were supposed
to have our happy ending.

20
00:00:50,847 --> 00:00:53,281
I'm ready to be Iris West-Allen.

21
00:00:53,283 --> 00:00:55,351
And you always will be.

22
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,821
But you have to keep
living your life, okay?

23
00:00:57,888 --> 00:01:00,256
Keep running, for me.

24
00:01:00,324 --> 00:01:02,258
Promise me you'll run, Iris.

25
00:01:04,027 --> 00:01:05,394
I promise.

26
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,473
<i>I promised him I'd run, so that's what
I've been doing these last six months,</i>

27
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:20,242
<i>running as fast as I can.</i>

28
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:30,920
I can't find her, Cisco.

29
00:01:30,987 --> 00:01:33,122
Well, I gotta work out more.

30
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,990
She's really stepped up her game.

31
00:01:35,058 --> 00:01:37,393
Then let's turn up ours. I
don't have eyes on her.

32
00:01:37,461 --> 00:01:39,362
<i>- Iris?
- Copy, I'm on it.</i>

33
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:41,831
Looking...

34
00:01:41,898 --> 00:01:43,499
Got her. <i>- And?</i>

35
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:45,868
- Duck!
- I don't see no duck.

36
00:01:47,804 --> 00:01:49,472
Peekaboo.

37
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:51,741
Your only warning, boys.

38
00:01:51,808 --> 00:01:53,476
Stay back.

39
00:01:53,543 --> 00:01:55,478
- She meant the other duck.
- Yeah, I cannot believe

40
00:01:55,545 --> 00:01:57,580
you actually thought
she meant a duck duck.

41
00:01:57,647 --> 00:01:59,982
Where is she, Iris?

42
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,017
She's headed for the Keystone Bridge.

43
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:03,386
If she gets out of the city,
we're gonna lose her for good.

44
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:05,121
You guys have to stop her now.

45
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:07,289
Oh, I'ma catch her this time.

46
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:09,358
I hate teleporters.

47
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:30,513
Three...

48
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,148
Three...

49
00:02:32,215 --> 00:02:33,716
She jumps every third rooftop.

50
00:02:33,964 --> 00:02:35,431
Cisco, she's gonna jump
to the Broome Tower.

51
00:02:35,498 --> 00:02:37,337
When she lands, stop her. <i>- On it.</i>

52
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:38,873
Dad, meet them at the bottom. <i>- Copy.</i>

53
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:41,276
- Wally...
- I know what to do.

54
00:02:41,343 --> 00:02:42,410
Whoa.

55
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:47,282
Come on.

56
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:48,816
Peekaboo-yah!

57
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:02,697
Dead bang, fellas.

58
00:03:09,872 --> 00:03:11,706
Look at that.

59
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,675
We got her.

60
00:03:14,978 --> 00:03:17,291
- sync and corrections by Mr. C -
- www.addic7ed.com -

61
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,048
I'm so proud of us.

62
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:21,849
That was a good hustle
out there, Team Vibe.

63
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:23,318
It's Team Kid Flash, but thank you.

64
00:03:23,384 --> 00:03:25,387
Okay, not your finest hour, gentlemen.

65
00:03:25,474 --> 00:03:27,262
What are you looking at me for?
I was the one to put her down.

66
00:03:27,264 --> 00:03:29,731
And Wally and I helped him out
with the assist. Classic maneuver.

67
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,747
Yeah, it actually went
exactly as we planned.

68
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,970
Exactly as we planned.

69
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:34,805
You don't believe us, ask Joe.

70
00:03:34,873 --> 00:03:35,973
Joe, go ahead and tell her how
this went exactly as we planned.

71
00:03:36,044 --> 00:03:37,712
Peek-a-Boo fell right into our trap.

72
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:39,046
- I'm not doing that.
- And we aren't exactly

73
00:03:39,114 --> 00:03:41,331
catching bad guys at our old rate.

74
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,136
One out of every three
metas that we've fought

75
00:03:43,138 --> 00:03:44,644
in the last six months has escaped.

76
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:45,879
Temporarily, yes,

77
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:47,882
but Team Kid Flash is on the case.

78
00:03:47,884 --> 00:03:49,652
Son, I love you,

79
00:03:49,851 --> 00:03:51,618
but ain't nobody feeling Team Kid Flash.

80
00:03:51,686 --> 00:03:53,587
It's, like, too many syllables.

81
00:03:53,654 --> 00:03:55,055
Okay, guys, maybe a little
less fooling around

82
00:03:55,123 --> 00:03:56,957
and a little more taking
things seriously.

83
00:03:57,024 --> 00:03:59,493
It's up to us to protect
this city, right?

84
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,228
Because there is no one else.

85
00:04:03,297 --> 00:04:05,832
Wally, why don't you, um,
go to the Speed Lab?

86
00:04:06,152 --> 00:04:08,120
I've programmed a new
training simulation for you.

87
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,157
- It should only take four hours.
- Four... what?

88
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:12,826
No, what about family dinner tonight?

89
00:04:12,894 --> 00:04:15,562
You know what, training sounds amazing.

90
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,231
Okay. See ya at home, boss.

91
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:22,769
Cisco, you wanna...

92
00:04:22,837 --> 00:04:24,671
share what you're thinking?

93
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:25,872
I'm thinking it would
be a lot better off

94
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,574
if we weren't one man down.

95
00:04:34,115 --> 00:04:36,750
<i>I only have a couple more
boxes to bring over.</i>

96
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,918
We have no more room

97
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:40,320
in the garage or the basement.

98
00:04:40,388 --> 00:04:42,923
Right... or, we could just get
rid of some more of your stuff.

99
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,826
- Like what?
- Like, babe, do you really need

100
00:04:45,893 --> 00:04:47,928
all the smelly old records in there?

101
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:50,664
- Oh, Cecile...
- Records?

102
00:04:50,732 --> 00:04:53,900
You mean my vintage
jazz LP collection...

103
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:55,402
- Mm-hmm.
- That I painstakingly

104
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,771
and carefully collected
over the last 30 years?

105
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,940
- Really?
- Those are my loves, babe.

106
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:02,843
They're going in the
coffin with me when I die.

107
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,779
Okay, maybe we could bury them now,

108
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,048
and you can just join
them at a later date.

109
00:05:08,116 --> 00:05:09,850
- Oh, you got jokes?
- Yeah.

110
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:11,585
You lucky I already gave you the key,

111
00:05:11,652 --> 00:05:13,086
because I'm starting to rethink
this whole move-in thing.

112
00:05:13,154 --> 00:05:14,688
- No, you're not.
- No, I'm not.

113
00:05:14,756 --> 00:05:16,256
No, you're not...

114
00:05:16,324 --> 00:05:18,925
'Cause you love me.

115
00:05:18,993 --> 00:05:21,595
Um...

116
00:05:21,662 --> 00:05:23,697
Why don't I go make some coffee?

117
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:25,432
Obvious.

118
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:29,169
Okay, so,

119
00:05:29,237 --> 00:05:31,905
ever since Julian moved back to London,

120
00:05:31,973 --> 00:05:35,742
they have been short-staffed
in the crime lab at CCPD,

121
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,278
and I've been stalling Singh
with this whole story of

122
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:40,480
Barry being on sabbatical
in the Czech Republic...

123
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,383
And they wanna hire
someone to replace him.

124
00:05:45,186 --> 00:05:47,254
Yeah, they should. They need the help.

125
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:50,157
- Barry's not coming back, so...
- You don't know that.

126
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,925
Yes, I do.

127
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:55,195
Sweetheart...

128
00:05:55,263 --> 00:05:58,665
I'm very proud of you
for taking the lead

129
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,066
with Wally and Cisco at S.T.A.R. Labs,

130
00:06:00,134 --> 00:06:02,903
and I let you have your space,

131
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,807
so that you'd have time to
deal with what happened.

132
00:06:06,874 --> 00:06:09,376
Dad, I'm fine, okay?

133
00:06:09,444 --> 00:06:12,145
I'm not. We lost him, Iris.

134
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:13,880
My son, your everything.

135
00:06:13,948 --> 00:06:16,082
Dad, what do you want me to do?

136
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,518
Curl up in a ball and cry all day?

137
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,086
I can't do that.

138
00:06:20,154 --> 00:06:23,423
Barry told me to be strong.
I'm being strong.

139
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:26,359
When H.R. died, we had a funeral.

140
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,062
We spoke about his life.

141
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,832
Maybe we should do the
same thing for Barry,

142
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:33,934
give us all permission to grieve.

143
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:37,270
And what are we gonna bury, Dad?

144
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:39,372
An empty suit in the lab?

145
00:06:44,312 --> 00:06:45,946
You know what, thank Cecile for dinner.

146
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:47,747
I'm gonna get going, okay?

147
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:28,588
Wally? Cisco?

148
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,790
We're up.

149
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,767
Guys? What are we looking at?

150
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,402
Holy Ronin.

151
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:50,710
It's a Samurai.

152
00:07:50,778 --> 00:07:53,480
Anybody speak Japanese?

153
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,913
_

154
00:07:56,116 --> 00:07:58,284
Tell me he did not just speak Japanese.

155
00:07:58,286 --> 00:07:59,753
I can do things.

156
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,056
_

157
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:04,724
The Flash.

158
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:06,826
Yeah, you're looking at him, pal.

159
00:08:06,894 --> 00:08:09,896
You're not The Flash.
You're not the best.

160
00:08:09,964 --> 00:08:12,481
Bring me The Flash...

161
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:13,700
I'm sensing an "or else."

162
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:16,970
Or else your city falls.

163
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,672
<i>The Flash ain't coming.</i>

164
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:20,073
Furthermore, Mifune,

165
00:08:20,141 --> 00:08:21,508
we're gonna need you
to sheath that sword

166
00:08:21,576 --> 00:08:23,443
before somebody gets hurt,

167
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:25,345
somebody like you, for instance,

168
00:08:25,413 --> 00:08:27,814
'cause you're up against
some bad hombres,

169
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:31,484
and what do you think
you're gonna do against us

170
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,753
with a sword?

171
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,167
You guys okay?

172
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:50,604
What the hell kinda sword is that?

173
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:51,905
You have one day.

174
00:08:51,973 --> 00:08:54,507
If The Flash does not face me,

175
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,243
Central City dies.

176
00:09:06,352 --> 00:09:08,201
<i>The Flash hasn't been
seen in almost 6 months,</i>

177
00:09:08,203 --> 00:09:09,837
<i>leaving us to speculate</i>

178
00:09:09,913 --> 00:09:11,581
<i>what can save us from
this newest threat.</i>

179
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,587
There are other
superheroes in this town.

180
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,943
Yeah, and your boy, Kurosawa, over there

181
00:09:16,945 --> 00:09:18,639
blew us away like ragdolls

182
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,562
performing his reverse Excalibur.

183
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,003
We haven't faced anything
like this before.

184
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,331
Why do you think he
only wanted The Flash?

185
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,999
He said he wants to fight the best.

186
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,334
He's threatening to destroy the city.

187
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,835
- Do we think he can do it?
- I say yes.

188
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:30,803
Then he has to fight The Flash.

189
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,738
Who isn't here?

190
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:37,076
What if he was?

191
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:38,411
Iris, you said it yourself.

192
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:39,812
Just us trying to keep the city safe,

193
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,080
we're barely getting it done.

194
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:42,915
And this guy, he's no joke.

195
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:46,052
If we don't offer up The Flash,
there's gonna be serious damage.

196
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,521
People are gonne die, and
that's gonna be on us.

197
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,959
We need to bring Barry back.

198
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,694
Cisco, we can't.

199
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,596
If Barry comes out, the
Speed Force Prison goes...

200
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,030
It becomes unstable.

201
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,599
It could destroy the
city, the whole world.

202
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,133
Which is exactly what
we're trying to prevent.

203
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,868
What if I can solve that?

204
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,171
- In the next 24 hours?
- Yes!

205
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,906
Guys, I've been working on this.

206
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,474
For how long?

207
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,811
Since the night he left.

208
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,279
- Cisco?
- I've had help.

209
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:15,247
I've consulted with Harry and...
and Tina

210
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,416
and Tracy and Felicity and Curtis,

211
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,552
and I'm pretty sure I figured out a way

212
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,455
to stabilize the Speed Force
Prison and free Barry

213
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:25,958
without unleashing another
lightning storm on the city.

214
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,994
I just need a couple more things.

215
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,302
- Maybe we should.
- No.

216
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,770
You've been working on this for how long

217
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,305
and you never told us?

218
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:41,040
I didn't wanna say anything
until I was certain.

219
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,241
Are you certain that the Speed Force

220
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,043
won't take Wally in his place?

221
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,378
Are you certain that
you can even close it

222
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:48,514
before it rips Central City in two?

223
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:50,883
Are you certain that Barry
is even still alive?

224
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,284
He's gotta be.

225
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:56,856
Iris, you, of all people,

226
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:59,158
how can you not be in on this?

227
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,293
Because Barry is gone.

228
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:04,664
That is the only thing any
of us can be certain about.

229
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,832
Now, let's do what we can
do to come up with a plan

230
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,567
to take out this Samurai.

231
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:11,470
Okay?

232
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,873
- Okay?
- Okay...

233
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,077
But I'm gonna need some coffee.

234
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:28,454
♪ Coming over the mountain

235
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,723
Hello.

236
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,692
My, what a selection.

237
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,794
You got any recommendations?

238
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,729
Yeah, drink somewhere else.

239
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:38,164
What can I get you?

240
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:40,800
Let's go with something sweet

241
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,835
but deceptively strong

242
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,403
with lots of ice.

243
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,340
Shirley Temple, coming right up.

244
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:51,343
What is a nice girl with
two doctorates and a PHD

245
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,113
doing in a rat's nest like this one?

246
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:56,182
Working. How'd you find me?

247
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,616
'Cause I'm great with computers,

248
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,552
and I have my own satellite.
You do the math.

249
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:02,822
- You Vibed me.
- I Vibed you, yes.

250
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,258
You're looking a lot less frosty
than the last time I saw you.

251
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:10,362
You said you weren't her, but
you weren't Caitlin either.

252
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,933
It's just me, Cisco. I'm just Caitlin.

253
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,102
How'd you do it?

254
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,503
What do you want?

255
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,172
Well, a stiffer drink, for starters.

256
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,908
If you're back to
normal, I have to know,

257
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,877
why didn't you come back to us?

258
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,447
Okay, I get it. That's fine.

259
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:30,082
I'm not gonna make you answer that.

260
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,584
But we really could've used you.

261
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:34,053
Barry's still stuck in the Speed Force?

262
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:37,189
You knew about that?

263
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,992
I'm gonna get him out,
but I need your help.

264
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,799
Everything okay?

265
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,101
- Everything's fine.
- Yeah, everything's great, pal.

266
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:50,636
Do you mind? I'm talking to the lady.

267
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:52,271
I'm sure there's someone
else you can find in here

268
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:55,040
to commiserate with
over poor life choices.

269
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,548
Thank you.

270
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:05,651
Look, I figured out how to save Barry,

271
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,520
but I can't do it without you.

272
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,622
Did you see that Samurai
that showed up today?

273
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:10,990
Yes.

274
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,258
He's threatening to blow up the city,

275
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:15,461
and we need Barry to stop him.

276
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:17,663
So help us out, please?

277
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,965
Caitlin?

278
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:23,102
My shift's over in an hour.

279
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,671
Girl, I got time.

280
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:27,973
Oh, this is good.

281
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,642
Is there anything you can't do?

282
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,944
Move on, apparently.

283
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:37,149
Hang tight. You're coming home, buddy.

284
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,255
Hey, Cisco, can you pull up
the Mockingbird satellite?

285
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,558
We're tracking down this Samurai.

286
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:49,495
Cisco?

287
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:50,796
Wally?

288
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,212
Mr. West, Mr. West.

289
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,947
So, what are we doing out here, Cisco?

290
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,748
It seemed an appropriate venue.

291
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,784
- We've had good luck here before.
- Why do we need good luck?

292
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:14,019
Because we're bringing Barry back.

293
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,721
Cisco, Iris said...

294
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:17,656
I know what Iris said, Joe.

295
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,825
I also know Barry said
everyone would look to me

296
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:21,694
after he was gone.

297
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,329
So look to me.

298
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,831
Four of us, we can do this.

299
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,666
What do you mean the four of us?

300
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:30,336
- Hi, Joe.
- It's okay.

301
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:33,539
She's Caitlin again, our Caitlin.

302
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:35,407
She's here to help us.

303
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,943
So, what do you say?

304
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:43,415
You better be right.

305
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,017
I am.

306
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,489
Joe, I know that I can never make up

307
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:54,393
for the things that I
did to you, to Cecile.

308
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:55,995
I just hope...

309
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,497
I just hope that one day
you can forgive me.

310
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,335
Come here.

311
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,139
Let's bring everybody home today, okay?

312
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,475
- You got it.
- So how are we gonna bring

313
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,677
Barry back without blowing
a hole in the, uh, world?

314
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:15,014
Ha! In the spirit of
bringing back old friends,

315
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,217
may I present the Speed Force bazooka.

316
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:19,685
Ah...

317
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:20,986
I made a few slight modifications,

318
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:22,621
as Captain Solo would say.

319
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:24,223
Caitlin and I spent all of last night

320
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,358
working out some kinks,
fine-tuning the Quark Sphere.

321
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,893
- What?
- The Quark Sphere,

322
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,628
filled with Barry's
unique genetic marker,

323
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,563
and programmed to track
his specific DNA,

324
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,532
using the electrical current
of the Speed Force.

325
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,634
Once we track Barry and we pull him out,

326
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:37,636
the Quark Sphere will
trick the Speed Force

327
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:39,638
- into thinking he's still there.
- Hey, Wally,

328
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:42,174
can you put that on the center pylon?

329
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:50,015
- Ready.
- Let's bring our boy home.

330
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,518
Quark Matter scanning
electrical current.

331
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:04,363
Triangulating Quark
Matter on his location.

332
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,399
I've got a lock on something.

333
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,902
It's him.

334
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,236
It's him!

335
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,906
Now, Cisco!

336
00:17:26,304 --> 00:17:28,046
I can't believe you did
this behind my back.

337
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,077
You would've tried to stop us.

338
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,747
Because it was a waste of time.

339
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:33,068
I don't understand.
This should've worked.

340
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,272
Or you could've killed us all.

341
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:37,086
I don't know, Iris. I think
we were pretty close.

342
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:39,355
I'm sorry, "we"?

343
00:17:39,422 --> 00:17:41,156
Where have you been the
last six months again?

344
00:17:41,224 --> 00:17:43,888
- She was only trying to help.
- Look, guys,

345
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,791
we need to concentrate
on stopping this Samurai

346
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:47,993
who's trying to destroy
the city, not on Barry.

347
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:50,132
Dude, what is your deal?

348
00:17:50,624 --> 00:17:52,225
It's like you don't even want him back.

349
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:54,794
Hey, hey, hey!

350
00:17:54,862 --> 00:17:57,530
Cecile, can I call you back in a minute?

351
00:17:57,598 --> 00:17:59,999
We're in the middle of something here.

352
00:18:00,067 --> 00:18:01,601
What?

353
00:18:01,668 --> 00:18:03,436
<i>State police picked him up on the 112</i>

354
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:05,677
- outside of Ivy City.
- That's 300 miles away.

355
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,713
Yeah, one of the cops is a Keystone vet.

356
00:18:07,781 --> 00:18:09,582
- Recognized him.
- I knew it would work.

357
00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:11,917
I knew it.

358
00:18:11,985 --> 00:18:14,286
You should prepare yourselves.

359
00:18:24,264 --> 00:18:25,631
Barry?

360
00:18:31,438 --> 00:18:32,671
Barry...

361
00:18:41,214 --> 00:18:44,250
Nora shouldn't be here.

362
00:18:44,317 --> 00:18:47,486
Your mom isn't here, Barry. It's...

363
00:18:47,554 --> 00:18:50,155
it's me, Iris.

364
00:18:50,223 --> 00:18:52,791
You're home.

365
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:54,560
Your Honor, I'm innocent.

366
00:18:54,628 --> 00:18:56,895
I didn't do this. I didn't kill anyone.

367
00:18:56,963 --> 00:18:59,431
Can you hear the stars singing?

368
00:18:59,499 --> 00:19:02,968
Rhyming, chiming, timing
every hour, every minute.

369
00:19:03,036 --> 00:19:04,603
You said the city was safe,

370
00:19:04,671 --> 00:19:06,338
that there was no residual danger,

371
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:07,706
but that's not true.

372
00:19:07,774 --> 00:19:09,008
What really happened that night...

373
00:19:09,075 --> 00:19:10,376
The city is safe.

374
00:19:10,443 --> 00:19:12,311
You saved it. You saved us all.

375
00:19:18,718 --> 00:19:20,552
Stars melting

376
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,755
like ice cream,

377
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:25,491
dream, gleam.

378
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:27,793
Nothing seems...

379
00:19:27,861 --> 00:19:29,728
Nora shouldn't be here.

380
00:19:29,796 --> 00:19:31,764
I'm guessing this isn't just shock.

381
00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:33,499
Shock results from a
drop in blood pressure.

382
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:35,100
This is neurological.

383
00:19:35,168 --> 00:19:37,703
It's a whole new way
of looking at physics.

384
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:40,139
It will change the way that we think

385
00:19:40,206 --> 00:19:42,074
about everything,

386
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:44,476
from a single atom

387
00:19:44,544 --> 00:19:46,345
to an entire galaxy.

388
00:19:46,413 --> 00:19:47,980
God!

389
00:19:48,048 --> 00:19:49,882
Stars so loud.

390
00:19:49,949 --> 00:19:51,817
Loud, cloud, proud.

391
00:19:54,721 --> 00:19:56,355
Dad and I are both okay.

392
00:19:56,423 --> 00:19:59,024
We're gonna be fine.

393
00:19:59,092 --> 00:20:01,060
I'm just not sure I'm like you, Oliver.

394
00:20:02,595 --> 00:20:04,730
We need to get him back to S.T.A.R.
Labs now.

395
00:20:14,074 --> 00:20:15,407
What's the diagnosis?

396
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:17,276
Does he have brain damage or something?

397
00:20:17,344 --> 00:20:19,011
He's actually scary healthy.

398
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,679
His neurotransmitters are functioning at

399
00:20:20,747 --> 00:20:22,281
five times the normal speed.

400
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:24,249
- Then what's wrong?
- I have two theories.

401
00:20:24,317 --> 00:20:26,685
One is that he's suffering
from a form of schizophasia.

402
00:20:26,753 --> 00:20:29,822
That's where you assign the
wrong definitions to words.

403
00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:31,323
So, from his perspective,

404
00:20:31,391 --> 00:20:33,058
all that nonsense he's
saying makes sense?

405
00:20:33,126 --> 00:20:35,761
It's too bad we don't have a translator.

406
00:20:35,829 --> 00:20:38,997
No, but we can make one.

407
00:20:39,065 --> 00:20:40,499
If his brain's schizophastic

408
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:42,167
and these symbols represent
different words,

409
00:20:42,235 --> 00:20:43,969
he could be sending us a message,

410
00:20:44,037 --> 00:20:47,005
and we just need the right
algorithm to decrypt it.

411
00:20:47,073 --> 00:20:50,209
You said you had two theories.
What's the other one?

412
00:20:50,276 --> 00:20:53,612
We know that the Speed Force
exists beyond space and time.

413
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,247
To us, Barry was only in
there for six months,

414
00:20:55,315 --> 00:20:58,484
but to him, it could've
been 10,000 years.

415
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:01,954
All that time in isolation,

416
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:05,157
it could've caused dementia.

417
00:21:05,225 --> 00:21:08,026
That may be all of him that's left.

418
00:21:08,094 --> 00:21:11,330
So how do we find out which one it is?

419
00:21:11,398 --> 00:21:14,099
I could decrease the
sedative, wake him up.

420
00:21:15,568 --> 00:21:17,970
I think I've got the
perfect song for that.

421
00:21:21,141 --> 00:21:22,775
Are you sure this is appropriate?

422
00:21:22,842 --> 00:21:24,543
Yeah. It's a good luck charm.

423
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:26,178
I mean, it worked before.

424
00:21:26,246 --> 00:21:27,579
Last time, he was in a coma,

425
00:21:27,647 --> 00:21:29,314
not a pan-temporal extra dimension.

426
00:21:29,382 --> 00:21:32,618
Well, waking up to Gaga
shouldn't seem too freaky.

427
00:21:32,685 --> 00:21:34,686
Hey, Barry.

428
00:21:34,754 --> 00:21:36,822
Hey.

429
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,292
It's me, Cisco,

430
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,760
AKA Vibe,

431
00:21:41,828 --> 00:21:44,196
BKA your BFF.

432
00:21:44,264 --> 00:21:47,399
Yeah. Hey, buddy.

433
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:52,504
Hey.

434
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:57,810
While you were gone, I
made you a new suit.

435
00:21:57,877 --> 00:21:59,745
Do you wanna take it out for a spin?

436
00:21:59,813 --> 00:22:02,714
The stars are raining.

437
00:22:02,782 --> 00:22:04,349
Draining.

438
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:06,518
Paining. Too soon.

439
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:08,987
I think maybe later.

440
00:22:09,055 --> 00:22:12,491
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.

441
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,460
He didn't do those things.

442
00:22:14,527 --> 00:22:16,762
He didn't hurt my mom. I
was there that night.

443
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,431
There was a man, plan.

444
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:21,300
No plan.

445
00:22:23,703 --> 00:22:26,338
We're gonna need more diapers.

446
00:22:26,406 --> 00:22:28,841
Diapers.

447
00:22:28,908 --> 00:22:30,509
You keep drawing, buddy.

448
00:22:30,577 --> 00:22:32,644
You keep drawing. I'm
gonna figure this out.

449
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,915
- Caitlin...
- I don't know.

450
00:22:41,488 --> 00:22:43,689
Guys, can I get the room for a second?

451
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:50,362
<i>♪ 77</i>

452
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,563
Barry...

453
00:22:56,202 --> 00:22:57,636
I don't know
if you can hear me,

454
00:22:57,704 --> 00:23:02,207
or if you're trying to
send us a message somehow.

455
00:23:02,275 --> 00:23:04,409
Hey, I did what you told me to.

456
00:23:04,477 --> 00:23:07,412
I kept running, I kept moving forward,

457
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,415
because I knew that if I
stopped to look back,

458
00:23:10,483 --> 00:23:13,785
then I would remember that you
weren't behind me anymore.

459
00:23:13,853 --> 00:23:17,789
And it's been so hard.

460
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:23,095
And when Cisco said that
he could bring you back,

461
00:23:23,162 --> 00:23:26,131
you know, I didn't know what to think.

462
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:30,569
What if it didn't work?
What if you were dead?

463
00:23:30,637 --> 00:23:34,673
I mean, I thought it would be
like losing you all over again.

464
00:23:42,815 --> 00:23:45,317
I never imagined this, though.

465
00:23:47,954 --> 00:23:52,157
I don't know what I would do if
this is all that's left of you,

466
00:23:52,225 --> 00:23:55,794
if this is all that's left of
the amazing man that I know

467
00:23:55,862 --> 00:23:57,996
and love.

468
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:01,700
Please come back to me.

469
00:24:05,138 --> 00:24:07,506
Tell me you're still my Barry.

470
00:24:12,845 --> 00:24:14,346
Guys?

471
00:24:21,588 --> 00:24:23,855
Barry! Barry, stop!

472
00:24:25,692 --> 00:24:27,492
Breach him to the pipeline!

473
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,028
He's too fast!

474
00:24:35,168 --> 00:24:36,735
Expecting someone else?

475
00:24:38,638 --> 00:24:40,038
We need to get him in a containment cell

476
00:24:40,106 --> 00:24:41,940
before he does that again.

477
00:24:45,545 --> 00:24:46,812
Samurai's back.

478
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:48,780
More like Samurai jackass.

479
00:24:48,848 --> 00:24:50,148
Nope, that's a rough draft.

480
00:24:50,216 --> 00:24:52,017
It hasn't even been a full day yet.

481
00:24:52,085 --> 00:24:55,053
He said he'd level the city if
we didn't bring in The Flash.

482
00:24:55,121 --> 00:24:57,356
Well, let's give him what he asked for.

483
00:25:02,428 --> 00:25:03,662
You wanted me...

484
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:08,066
Here I am.

485
00:25:21,214 --> 00:25:23,649
You're not The Flash.

486
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,924
Wally!

487
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,110
If I don't get the real
Flash by nightfall,

488
00:25:42,112 --> 00:25:44,714
this city comes down.

489
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:58,849
How long till I can get back out there?

490
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,658
Wally, he sliced right
through your fibula.

491
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,528
If you weren't a speedster, I'd
be amputating your leg right now.

492
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:06,664
Okay, how long?

493
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,967
Four to five hours?

494
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,735
We don't have that kinda time.

495
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,337
You know what, I'm fine.

496
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,139
Son... son, son...

497
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,408
You've done everything you can do.

498
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:19,844
Relax.

499
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:24,082
- Any luck?
- No, not yet.

500
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,217
The computer keeps telling
me it's random gibberish.

501
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:28,586
- Maybe it is.
- No, it's not.

502
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:30,955
Barry's trying to send us a message.
I know it.

503
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:32,890
I mean, he spent all this
time in the Speed Force.

504
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,392
Maybe now he knows the answers to

505
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,494
life, the universe, and everything.

506
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:37,762
So you think all this crazy writing

507
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,998
is Barry's way of telling us 42?

508
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,967
Yes, exactly.

509
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:48,506
Have I mentioned how much
I miss having you around?

510
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,912
I'm gonna keep working on this....

511
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,547
Unless
you have any ideas.

512
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,883
Nope, it's all Greek to me.

513
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:03,788
Great Caesar's Ghost.

514
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,023
This analysis is based on

515
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,991
a monoalphabetic substitution cipher,

516
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,760
but what if it's polyalphabetic?

517
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,628
What if it's... it's like Greek?

518
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:13,097
Like the symbols are unique alphabet?

519
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:17,168
Excelsior!

520
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:18,770
- What is it?
- Cisco figured it out.

521
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,405
He figured out how to
crack Barry's code.

522
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,640
- You did? What does it say?
- Hold on one sec.

523
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:25,109
It's loading. Come on...

524
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:28,446
Loading, loading, loading, loading...
and it says...

525
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:31,983
"This house is bitchin'."

526
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:35,753
"This house is bitchin'"?

527
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,489
- That doesn't sound like Barry.
- No.

528
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:41,092
No. No, it doesn't.

529
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,394
That's 'cause it's not.

530
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:58,509
Whoa.

531
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:01,479
Don't tell me you have
Frankenstein under there.

532
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:04,048
It's Barry's new suit,

533
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,783
although right now, I'm
having trouble seeing it

534
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,952
as anything other than a waste of time.

535
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,954
- Cisco...
- I know.

536
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,490
I should've listened to you.

537
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:16,327
Barry was never
trying to communicate with us,

538
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:18,429
but I believed it.

539
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:21,332
I really did.

540
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,134
Sometimes, I feel like if I believe in

541
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,603
something hard enough,
that'll make it real.

542
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:31,609
You know what the worst part is?

543
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:33,411
I didn't do it to save the city.

544
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,049
I did it because it...

545
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:40,651
gave me an excuse to bring him back.

546
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:45,289
I did it because I missed my friend.

547
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:16,454
Much better.

548
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:18,623
You said it yourself.

549
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,125
She goes looking for danger.

550
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,844
I thought cleaning him up

551
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:43,548
would make me feel better, but...

552
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,082
Yeah.

553
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,686
The more he looks like himself,

554
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:50,455
the more it reminds you how lost he is.

555
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,192
You have to believe that
things can get better.

556
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:57,795
There is an answer for every question.

557
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:01,899
I don't think I know
how to anymore, Dad.

558
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:05,703
I know that feeling. I was
struggling with it too.

559
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:08,372
But I figured it out.

560
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:13,244
- How?
- Church.

561
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,315
You haven't gone to
church since I was a kid.

562
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:18,716
I know.

563
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:22,787
Cecile suggested it,
thought it would help.

564
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:26,057
But I swear,

565
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:28,392
one of the priest's homilies,

566
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,296
it was like... it was
like he wrote it for me.

567
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:35,600
"Strength means nothing

568
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,201
without faith"...

569
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:42,273
And I started realizing

570
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,775
that my strength

571
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:48,613
didn't stop me from thinking
I lost you to Savitar,

572
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,184
or that we'd never see Barry again.

573
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:57,622
Cecile reminded me to have faith...

574
00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:02,326
And I believed.

575
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:03,961
And here you two are.

576
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:11,669
You got strength, baby girl.

577
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:15,506
You just need a little faith.

578
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:17,975
<i>Joe, Samurai's 24 hours are up.</i>

579
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,810
Gotta go.

580
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,067
Come get me.

581
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:52,243
I don't see The Flash.

582
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:54,779
I'm afraid you're gonna
have to make do with us.

583
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:07,925
Iris! Hold your fire.

584
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:11,028
You want The Flash? Take me.

585
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,763
Why?

586
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:14,799
Because he'll come for me.

587
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,801
And how...

588
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,604
do you know this?

589
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,072
I believe.

590
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,144
Iris!

591
00:32:33,664 --> 00:32:35,665
Hey! Samurai's got Iris.

592
00:32:35,733 --> 00:32:37,534
- She gave herself up to him.
- What?

593
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:39,235
Why would she do that?

594
00:32:41,939 --> 00:32:46,209
How do we get her back?

595
00:32:47,745 --> 00:32:50,280
Barry! Iris is in trouble.
She needs your help.

596
00:32:50,347 --> 00:32:52,215
I doubt restraint is how you got to be

597
00:32:52,283 --> 00:32:55,385
the man you are today,
play, way, no way!

598
00:32:55,453 --> 00:32:56,908
Highway, byway!

599
00:32:57,182 --> 00:32:59,517
Please, son. Please!

600
00:32:59,585 --> 00:33:01,519
I wanna help you with
all this, and I will,

601
00:33:01,587 --> 00:33:03,254
but right now she needs our help,

602
00:33:03,322 --> 00:33:07,072
or she's gonna die.

603
00:33:07,346 --> 00:33:09,814
Barry, did you hear what I said?
Iris is gonna die!

604
00:33:21,527 --> 00:33:23,695
Barry's gone.

605
00:33:23,762 --> 00:33:26,497
You know what else is gone?

606
00:33:26,565 --> 00:33:28,433
The new suit.

607
00:33:29,935 --> 00:33:31,302
What's happening?

608
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,071
The Flash is back!

609
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,711
Do you see how fast he's running?

610
00:33:39,778 --> 00:33:43,014
- I've never gone that fast.
- No one has.

611
00:33:54,593 --> 00:33:55,993
Where is this Samurai taking Iris?

612
00:33:56,061 --> 00:33:57,829
They're already way past Danville,

613
00:33:57,896 --> 00:34:00,198
and the only thing out there
is the flatlands and...

614
00:34:00,265 --> 00:34:01,432
And what?

615
00:34:38,103 --> 00:34:39,971
Come on, Barry, catch her.

616
00:35:26,018 --> 00:35:27,852
The Flash,

617
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,222
welcome home.

618
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,790
Barry...

619
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:39,263
You came back to me.

620
00:35:42,034 --> 00:35:44,035
Always.

621
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,244
Pupils are equally reactive to light.

622
00:35:59,276 --> 00:36:00,677
I mean, your vitals are amazing.

623
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:02,612
You're in perfect health, even for you.

624
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,148
I... I'd like a urine
sample, just to confirm,

625
00:36:05,216 --> 00:36:06,483
but everything looks great.

626
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,651
Man, you love urine.

627
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,653
You love the... the testing of urine.

628
00:36:10,721 --> 00:36:12,589
The testing of the urine.
You know what I meant.

629
00:36:12,656 --> 00:36:14,457
Why do you have to ruin science?

630
00:36:14,525 --> 00:36:16,392
It's good to have you back.

631
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,862
Right back at ya.

632
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:20,730
It's good to have you back.

633
00:36:20,798 --> 00:36:23,299
- How you feeling?
- I feel great.

634
00:36:23,367 --> 00:36:24,901
Yeah, I feel incredible.

635
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:28,338
I don't know, it feels
like I've been reborn.

636
00:36:28,405 --> 00:36:30,640
- Mm.
- Well, okay, speedy Jesus.

637
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:31,774
Seriously, though.

638
00:36:31,842 --> 00:36:33,476
I mean, it hurts me to admit it,

639
00:36:33,544 --> 00:36:36,679
but you may be the
fastest speedster ever.

640
00:36:36,747 --> 00:36:38,848
I mean, you were in the
Speed Force for six months.

641
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:41,150
Maybe you were soaking up its energy?

642
00:36:41,218 --> 00:36:42,585
Maybe.

643
00:36:42,653 --> 00:36:44,420
How was everything while I was gone?

644
00:36:44,488 --> 00:36:46,256
Oh, yeah, it was... it was really cool.

645
00:36:46,323 --> 00:36:48,691
Team Kid Flash had everything
under control, so...

646
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:50,560
That's not our name.

647
00:36:50,628 --> 00:36:53,796
But still, we have some
mysteries left to solve,

648
00:36:53,864 --> 00:36:56,266
like our flying Samurai robot...

649
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:58,134
Android Samurai.

650
00:36:58,202 --> 00:37:01,571
Samur-oid.
Oh-ho-ho, we back, baby!

651
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:03,773
Yeah, someone created this,

652
00:37:03,841 --> 00:37:05,408
and it must be for a reason.

653
00:37:05,476 --> 00:37:09,078
Does the phrase, "This
house is bitchin'"

654
00:37:09,146 --> 00:37:10,947
mean anything to you?

655
00:37:11,015 --> 00:37:12,749
No?

656
00:37:12,816 --> 00:37:15,184
- Should it?
- No.

657
00:37:15,252 --> 00:37:17,453
Just know that when you were in
your "Beautiful Mind" phase,

658
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:20,156
you were talking straight-up nonsense.

659
00:37:20,224 --> 00:37:21,991
I don't remember any of that.

660
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:24,227
Last thing I remember was going
into the Speed Force with my mom

661
00:37:24,295 --> 00:37:26,062
and then saving Iris.

662
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,531
So how'd you know Iris was in trouble?

663
00:37:31,235 --> 00:37:34,003
I don't know.

664
00:37:34,071 --> 00:37:35,505
Hm.

665
00:37:35,573 --> 00:37:36,673
Well, thanks for bringing me home.

666
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:41,077
You're very welcome.

667
00:37:41,145 --> 00:37:42,745
Hey, Cisco,

668
00:37:42,813 --> 00:37:45,048
thanks for believing when I couldn't.

669
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,485
- We'll see you tomorrow, boss.
- Yeah.

670
00:37:52,923 --> 00:37:55,091
I know we left some
questions unanswered,

671
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:58,494
but I have to know,

672
00:37:58,562 --> 00:38:00,496
are we gonna see you tomorrow?

673
00:38:00,564 --> 00:38:02,932
Yeah, you will.

674
00:38:05,302 --> 00:38:08,137
We back, baby.

675
00:38:08,205 --> 00:38:09,973
We back, baby.

676
00:38:18,182 --> 00:38:20,483
- Where have you been?
- Doesn't matter.

677
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:22,952
Really?

678
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,520
Tell Amunet I'm out.

679
00:38:24,588 --> 00:38:27,290
You wanna quit, Snow?
Doesn't work that way.

680
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:30,426
You do what Amunet says for
as long as she tells you.

681
00:38:30,494 --> 00:38:32,495
Not anymore.

682
00:38:32,563 --> 00:38:34,731
Now leave me alone.

683
00:38:34,798 --> 00:38:38,701
You don't tell us what to do.

684
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:42,438
Don't make me frosty.

685
00:38:43,974 --> 00:38:46,376
You wouldn't like me when I'm frosty.

686
00:38:48,512 --> 00:38:51,080
What's the matter? Brain freeze?

687
00:38:51,148 --> 00:38:53,683
Touch my hand again, and
I'll freeze yours off,

688
00:38:53,751 --> 00:38:56,052
maybe some other parts too.

689
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,555
Tell Amunet I'm done.

690
00:38:59,623 --> 00:39:01,758
Don't let your beer get warm.

691
00:39:10,701 --> 00:39:13,102
Time to have some fun.

692
00:39:15,773 --> 00:39:17,273
Not yet.

693
00:39:19,576 --> 00:39:21,377
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

694
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:24,681
No, no, no.

695
00:39:27,818 --> 00:39:29,519
Not again.

696
00:39:35,793 --> 00:39:38,561
Are you tired? Do you
want to get some sleep?

697
00:39:38,629 --> 00:39:41,397
No, I feel like I've
been asleep for months.

698
00:39:44,868 --> 00:39:49,072
I, um... I couldn't bring myself
to sleep in our bed alone.

699
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,577
I couldn't even look at that.

700
00:39:57,815 --> 00:40:00,817
It's been really hard, Barry.

701
00:40:00,884 --> 00:40:03,152
Hey, well, I'm back,

702
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,656
and I'm never going anywhere ever again.

703
00:40:06,724 --> 00:40:09,592
I tried to keep going,

704
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,627
to keep fighting, to keep
running, like you said.

705
00:40:11,695 --> 00:40:13,730
You did.

706
00:40:13,797 --> 00:40:17,333
You kept everyone together.

707
00:40:17,401 --> 00:40:20,470
I'm so proud of you, okay?

708
00:40:20,537 --> 00:40:21,938
Look, it sounds funny,

709
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:25,541
but... maybe this was a blessing.

710
00:40:25,609 --> 00:40:28,311
You being gone for six
months was a blessing?

711
00:40:28,378 --> 00:40:31,914
I just... I... I can't
tell you how I feel, Iris.

712
00:40:31,982 --> 00:40:35,785
It's like, everything that
was wrong in my life,

713
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:38,020
the pain of my past, my mistakes,

714
00:40:38,088 --> 00:40:39,722
it's all just washed away,

715
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:42,625
and all I see is you and us

716
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:45,061
and our future together.

717
00:40:45,129 --> 00:40:47,497
Iris, it's gonna be great.

718
00:40:56,607 --> 00:40:58,074
Central City needs The Flash.

719
00:40:58,142 --> 00:41:00,343
I'll be right back, I promise.

720
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:21,731
The Samurai served its purpose.

721
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:24,300
As in 12th century feudal Japan,

722
00:41:24,368 --> 00:41:27,537
a time when the military
class was powerful,

723
00:41:27,604 --> 00:41:30,206
the execution methodical,

724
00:41:30,274 --> 00:41:31,674
like ours.

725
00:41:33,977 --> 00:41:35,211
Well, it worked.

726
00:41:35,279 --> 00:41:37,747
The Flash is back in Central City.

727
00:41:37,815 --> 00:41:41,951
It appears things are going as planned.

728
00:41:42,019 --> 00:41:44,220
As if there were any doubt.

729
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,727
What's our next step?

730
00:41:54,031 --> 00:41:55,464
I'm thinking.
