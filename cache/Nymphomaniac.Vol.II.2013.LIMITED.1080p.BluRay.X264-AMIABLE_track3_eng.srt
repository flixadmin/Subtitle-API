1
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,173
(birds chirping)

2
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:13,053
(knocking)

3
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,021
- (knocks)
- CAN I HELP YOU?

4
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,856
(phone ringing)

5
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,780
- (rings)
- (sighs)

6
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,168
(soft moaning)

7
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,003
(Joe's voice)
I HAVE TO GO BACK A BIT.

8
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,172
I WAS 12 YEARS OLD

9
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,466
AND ON A SCHOOL TRIP
IN THE HILLS.

10
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,469
(birds chirping)

11
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,749
(faint conversation)

12
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,852
(low rumbling)

13
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,113
(shuddering)

14
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,726
(ragged breathing)

15
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,165
ARE YOU MAKING FUN OF ME?

16
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,666
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,877
YOU HAVE THIS ORGASM,
NOT ONLY AN ORGASM,

18
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,046
- BUT A SPONTANEOUS ORGASM.
- YES, IT WAS AN ORGASM,

19
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,674
THOUGH THE DOCTOR
DESCRIBED IT AS A...

20
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,134
AN EPILEPTIC SEIZURE.

21
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,677
AND DURING THAT ORGASM,

22
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,220
YOU HAVE THIS VISION

23
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,682
OF THESE TWO WOMEN
ON EACH SIDE OF YOU?

24
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,269
WAS SHE HOLDING THE VEIL
WITH TWO FINGERS LIKE THIS?

25
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,694
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

26
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,489
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO
THESE WOMEN WERE, DO YOU?

27
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,077
NO, BUT ONE OF THEM DID
LOOK LIKE THE VIRGIN MARY,

28
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,038
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT.

29
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,707
WELL, IT WASN'T THE VIRGIN MARY,
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

30
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,126
FROM YOUR DESCRIPTION,
IT MUST'VE BEEN

31
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,045
VALERIA MESSALINA,

32
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,547
THE WIFE
OF EMPEROR CLAUDIUS,

33
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:39,051
THE MOST NOTORIOUS
NYMPHOMANIAC IN HISTORY.

34
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,802
AND THE OTHER WOMAN,

35
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,096
THE ONE ASTRIDE THE CREATURE,

36
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,475
THAT WAS NO ONE ELSE BUT
THE GREAT WHORE OF BABYLON

37
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,186
RIDING ON NIMROD
IN THE FORM OF A BULL.

38
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,192
YOUR STORY IS LIKE A...

39
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,362
BLASPHEMOUS RETELLING

40
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,198
OF THE TRANSFIGURATION
OF JESUS ON THE MOUNT...

41
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,952
WHICH IS ONE
OF THE EASTERN CHURCH'S

42
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,912
HOLIEST PASSAGES.

43
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,374
IT'S WHEN
THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST

44
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,293
IS ILLUMINATED BY
THE DIVINE LIGHT OF ETERNITY.

45
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,799
IF ANYONE ELSE WOULD HAVE
TOLD ME THAT STORY,

46
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,885
I WOULD'VE SEEN IT
AS A BLASPHEMOUS JOKE,

47
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,096
SPICED UP
WITH A BIBLICAL LIGHT

48
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:28,225
EMANATING FROM NOTHING LESS
THAN A SPONTANEOUS ORGASM.

49
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,481
AND THEN LATER, YOU LOST
YOUR ORGASM ALTOGETHER.

50
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,277
(opera music playing)

51
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,906
WAGNER.
"DAS RHEINGOLD,

52
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,117
THE DESCENT
INTO NIBELHEIM."

53
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,160
WAS IT THAT BAD?

54
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,622
TRY TO IMAGINE
THAT IN ONE FELL SWOOP,

55
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,083
YOU LOST
ALL DESIRE TO READ

56
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:57,462
AND ALL YOUR LOVE AND PASSION
FOR BOOKS AND LETTERS.

57
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:01,133
(Seligman) I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I CAN IMAGINE THAT.

58
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,437
(sighs)

59
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,397
(soft moaning)

60
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,866
(sobbing)

61
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:34,416
(wails)

62
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,794
(Seligman's voice) THIS IS NOTHING
LESS THAN ZENO'S PARADOX.

63
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,048
YOU ARE ACHILLES

64
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,717
AND THE TORTOISE
IS THE ORGASM.

65
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,093
OH, COME ON.

66
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,137
BECAUSE YOU WERE
GIVING CHASE,

67
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,765
YOU COULDN'T REACH SATISFACTION.
THAT'S THE PARADOX.

68
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,558
I'M SORRY, BUT IT SEEMS AS IF

69
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,560
YOU'RE NOT TAKING THIS
VERY SERIOUSLY.

70
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,521
I'M TELLING YOU ABOUT THE WORST
THING THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME,

71
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,899
THAT I, AT THAT POINT
WITHIN SECONDS,

72
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,318
LOST ALL SEXUAL SENSATION.

73
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,237
MY CUNT SIMPLY WENT NUMB!

74
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,198
AND IMMEDIATELY
WE HAVE TO HEAR

75
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,117
ABOUT THIS RIDICULOUS
MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM.

76
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,870
IN FACT,
I'M IN DOUBT WHETHER

77
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,288
YOU'RE EVEN LISTENING.

78
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,333
WHY DO YOU DOUBT THAT?

79
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,212
WHENEVER I'VE TOLD OTHER MEN
ABOUT EXPERIENCES,

80
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,131
EPISODES IN MY SEX LIFE,

81
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:27,219
IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT
THEY BECAME QUITE EXCITED.

82
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,388
I GOT EXCITED.

83
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,765
YES, ABOUT
THE MATHEMATICAL CRAP,

84
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,433
NOT ABOUT THE STORY.

85
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,361
WHAT KIND OF A PERSON
ARE YOU ACTUALLY?

86
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,535
I...

87
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,996
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW.

88
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,502
NO, BUT I CAN GUESS.

89
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,841
WHY DIDN'T I
GET THAT EARLIER?

90
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:11,012
THE FACT YOU DON'T GET EXCITED
OVER MY DIRTY STORIES

91
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,433
IS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
RELATE TO THEM.

92
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,603
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
WITH A WOMAN.

93
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,410
THAT'S QUITE ACCURATE.

94
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,455
NOT WITH A MAN EITHER.

95
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,001
(sighs)

96
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,424
ARE YOU SORRY ABOUT THAT?

97
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,473
WELL YEAH, BUT...

98
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,559
OUT OF CURIOSITY.

99
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,688
NOT OUT OF LUST,
AS YOU WOULD THINK.

100
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,740
I CONSIDER MYSELF...
ASEXUAL.

101
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,952
OF COURSE I...
EXPERIMENTED

102
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:19,080
WITH MASTURBATION WHEN
I WAS A TEENAGER, BUT...

103
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,791
IT DIDN'T
DO MUCH FOR ME.

104
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,298
SO THERE'S NOTHING
SEXUAL ABOUT ME.

105
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,556
IT'S NOT AS UNCOMMON
AS YOU WOULD THINK.

106
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,226
AND OF COURSE I'VE...

107
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,312
I'VE READ A LOT
ABOUT SEXUAL SUBJECTS:

108
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,856
"CANTERBURY TALES,"
"DECAMERON,"

109
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,441
"THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS."

110
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,902
YOU NAME IT

111
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,781
AND I'VE READ IT WITH
GREAT INTEREST AND ENJOYMENT...

112
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,701
BUT ONLY LITERARY ENJOYMENT.

113
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,956
BUT I... BUT I THINK
MAYBE IT MAKES ME

114
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,500
A BETTER LISTENER
TO YOUR STORY.

115
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,213
I HAVE NO
PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS OR...

116
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,674
OR PREFERENCES.

117
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,344
I'M ACTUALLY THE BEST JUDGE
YOU COULD GIVE YOUR STORY TO.

118
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,513
AND WHEN IT COMES
TO DECIDING WHETHER YOU'RE

119
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,181
A BAD HUMAN BEING
OR NOT, I'M...

120
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,809
I HAVE NO PROBLEMS
WITH THAT.

121
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,770
BECAUSE I DON'T LOOK
AT YOU THROUGH THE GLASSES

122
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,398
COLOURED BY SEXUALITY

123
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,858
OR SEXUAL EXPERIENCE.

124
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,737
I'M A VIRGIN.

125
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,533
I'M INNOCENT.

126
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,956
(organ music playing)

127
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,300
(train rumbling past)

128
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,180
SHE'S LOOKING AT ME.

129
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,434
YES.

130
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,477
IT'S AN ICON.

131
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,438
IS IT RUSSIAN?

132
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,356
YES, IT'S...

133
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,941
IT'S A SKILLED COPY,

134
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:13,069
MAYBE IN THE MANNER
OF RUBLEV.

135
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,952
(Seligman)
ICONS ARE USUALLY CONNECTED

136
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,078
TO THE EASTERN CHURCH.

137
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,872
(Joe) THE EASTERN CHURCH?

138
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,000
I MIGHT BECOME
A BIT THEORETICAL.

139
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,253
YOU MAY.

140
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,964
I'D LIKE YOU TO TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR PICTURE.

141
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,301
ALTHOUGH
THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH

142
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:40,305
WAS SPLIT UP IN 1054 BECAUSE
OF DIFFERENCES IN OPINION

143
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,932
BETWEEN THE EASTERN CHURCH
AND THE WESTERN CHURCH...

144
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,685
WHAT WE TODAY CALL
THE ORTHODOX CHURCH

145
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,937
AND THE ROMAN CATHOLIC
CHURCH.

146
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:53,610
THIS IS A TYPICAL
EASTERN CHURCH ICON.

147
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,738
AND IT USUALLY
DEPICTS THE VIRGIN MARY

148
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,907
AND THE INFANT JESUS,
AND MORE RARELY,

149
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,117
FOR INSTANCE,
THE CRUCIFIXION,

150
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,204
WHICH IN THE WESTERN CHURCH
WAS MUCH MORE PREVALENT.

151
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,706
IF YOU GENERALISE,
YOU COULD SAY THAT

152
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,584
THE WESTERN CHURCH
IS THE CHURCH OF SUFFERING,

153
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,546
AND THE EASTERN CHURCH IS
THE CHURCH OF HAPPINESS.

154
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,675
IF YOU IMAGINE A MENTAL JOURNEY
FROM ROME EASTWARD,

155
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,594
YOU FEEL HOW YOU MOVE AWAY

156
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,056
FROM GUILT AND PAIN
TOWARDS JOY AND LIGHT.

157
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,809
BUT YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T
BELIEVE IN GOD.

158
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:30,271
NO, BUT THE CONCEPT
OF RELIGION IS INTERESTING...

159
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,525
LIKE THE CONCEPT OF SEX.

160
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,152
BUT YOU WON'T
FIND ME ON MY KNEES

161
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,946
WITH THE REGARDS TO EITHER.

162
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,825
LET'S CALL THIS CHAPTER,

163
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,704
UM, "THE EASTERN CHURCH
AND THE WESTERN CHURCH."

164
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,207
BUT IT WON'T BE...
IT WON'T BE A STORY

165
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,334
ABOUT TRAVELLING
EAST FROM ROME

166
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,379
TOWARDS THE LIGHT,
BUT RATHER THE OPPOSITE.

167
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,258
SO IN ORDER NOT
TO MAKE IT TOO SAD,

168
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,303
I'VE PEPPED UP THE NAME OF THE
CHAPTER WITH AN EXTRA TITLE.

169
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,604
IN SPITE
OF MY TIRELESS EFFORTS,

170
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,107
MY CUNT TOTALLY
FAILED TO RESPOND.

171
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,192
I HAVE TO ADMIT
THERE CAME A TIME

172
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,570
WHEN WE HAD FUN TOGETHER.

173
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,657
I'LL GIVE YOU A FIVER...

174
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,368
UH-HUH.

175
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,328
...IF YOU CAN PUT THIS

176
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,373
UP INSIDE YOUR CUNT.

177
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,667
(laughs)
A FIVER?

178
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,127
RIGHT.

179
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,682
(spoons clatter)

180
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,976
(laughs) SHIT.

181
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,303
THANK YOU.

182
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,180
YOU'RE WELCOME.

183
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,228
- DIDN'T GET ANY SPOONS?
- NO, WE DIDN'T.

184
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,623
(spoons clatter)

185
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,709
(clatters)

186
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,880
(clattering)

187
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,424
(laughing)

188
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,184
THE MOST GROTESQUE THING WAS
THAT IT WAS DURING THAT PERIOD

189
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,771
WHERE EVERY SEXUAL SENSATION
WAS DENIED ME...

190
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,190
A PERIOD,
I MUST ADMIT,

191
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,818
OF SECURE AND RESTFUL
DOMESTIC COMFORT...

192
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,529
WE HAD MOVED IN
TOGETHER AND SO ON...

193
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,406
THAT I BECAME PREGNANT,

194
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,534
BECAUSE I WAS CARELESS ABOUT
MY BIRTH CONTROL PILLS.

195
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,370
CONSCIOUSLY
OR UNCONSCIOUSLY,

196
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,456
IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME
TO HAVE A CAESAREAN.

197
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,375
I MEAN,
I WAS HOPING THAT

198
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,878
MY CUNT WAS GOING
TO FUCKING WORK AGAIN,

199
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,588
AND I HAD A FEELING THAT

200
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,299
A HAPHAZARD BIRTH WOULDN'T
MAKE THINGS BETTER.

201
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,719
I MAY HAVE BEEN
IMAGINING THINGS,

202
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,347
BUT AS I LAY THERE THE NOISE
FROM THE INSTRUMENTS

203
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,141
RANG OUT IN A CHORD LIKE

204
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,018
THE ONE FROM
THE LITTLE FLOCK.

205
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,770
- (clangs)
- YES.

206
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,106
AND IT WASN'T FEAR.

207
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,901
MORE LIKE A KIND
OF DISGUST.

208
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,278
(clangs)

209
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,488
(sloshes)

210
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,913
(clangs)

211
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,376
(Joe's voice) I COULD'VE SWORN
I SAW HIM LAUGHING.

212
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,296
A LAUGHING SON?

213
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,381
IN "DOCTOR FAUSTUS,"
THOMAS MANN DESCRIBES

214
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,508
THE BIRTH OF NOAH'S SON HAM,

215
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,928
WHO WAS LAUGHING
WHEN HE WAS BORN.

216
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,598
ANOTHER SATANIC OMEN.

217
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,939
INCIDENTALLY, THE INNOCENT
CHILD WAS NAMED MARCEL,

218
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,775
AFTER MARS,
THE ROMAN GOD OF WAR.

219
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,568
AND MOTHERHOOD?

220
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,779
I ASSUME MATERNAL LOVE

221
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,448
DIDN'T QUITE LIVE UP
TO ITS EXPECTATIONS.

222
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,784
NO, I DIDN'T HAVE
ANY EXPECTATIONS.

223
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,120
AND MATERNAL LOVE
WASN'T A PROBLEM.

224
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,539
IT WAS JUST
THAT EACH TIME

225
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,708
I LOOKED
INTO THE CHILD'S EYES,

226
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,336
I HAD THIS
UNSETTLING FEELING

227
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,964
OF HAVING
BEEN FOUND OUT.

228
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,466
- (rattles)
- (babbles)

229
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,802
(Joe's voice) I KNOW
IT'S PROBABLY A STRANGE THING

230
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,595
TO SAY ABOUT A CHILD...

231
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,973
THAT MY LOVE
WASN'T BEING RETURNED...

232
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,933
BUT IT WAS MY PERCEPTION.

233
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,185
(fusses)

234
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,145
(pants)

235
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,778
(moaning)

236
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,787
IF JEROME HAD HOPED
FOR A BREAK

237
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:41,165
FROM WHAT WAS FOR HIM
NOW MOSTLY STRENUOUS WORK,

238
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,543
HE COULD FORGET ABOUT IT.

239
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,760
FILL ALL MY HOLES.

240
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,679
I CAN'T, JOE.

241
00:16:55,681 --> 00:17:00,852
I'M SORRY.

242
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,316
CAN WE TALK ABOUT IT?

243
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,152
OF COURSE.

244
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,076
I LOVE YOU, I LOVE
YOUR WILDNESS AND YOUR DESIRE.

245
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,619
I LOVE YOU, JOE.

246
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,000
AT THE MOMENT
I DON'T SEEM TO SATISFY YOU

247
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,835
IN THE WAY THAT I'D LIKE TO.

248
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,879
DON'T GET UPSET, JOE.

249
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,006
IT DOESN'T MEAN WE WON'T
CONTINUE WITH OUR SEX LIFE,

250
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,175
WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.
(sniffs)

251
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,802
VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

252
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,306
MMM, WHEN YOU BUY A TIGER,

253
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,976
RIGHT?
YOU ALSO HAVE TO FEED IT.

254
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:45,605
UM, SATISFY IT,

255
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,565
RIGHT?
(sniffs)

256
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,823
LONG STORY SHORT:

257
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,618
I HAVE A TIGER ON MY HANDS.

258
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,411
- YOU MEAN I'M TOO MUCH FOR YOU.
- NO.

259
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,790
YOU'RE JUST THE WAY
YOU SHOULD BE.

260
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,750
I WAS JUST THINKING
IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER

261
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,086
THAT I GET A LITTLE HELP
WITH THE FEEDING, THAT'S ALL.

262
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,758
YOU'RE SAYING I SHOULD
HAVE SEX WITH OTHERS AS WELL.

263
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,601
THAT'S A RATHER CRUEL WAY
OF PUTTING IT, JOE, BUT...

264
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,938
- BUT EXACT.
...EXACT.

265
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,736
(sighs)

266
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,367
(laughs)

267
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,494
(Joe's voice) FOR A LONG TIME
I'D BEEN PLAYING AROUND

268
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,413
WITH THE IDEA THAT THE CONCEPT
OF THE FUCK-ME-NOW CLOTHES

269
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,165
COULD BE IMPROVED...

270
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,668
YOU LOOK NICE.

271
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,878
...AND BECAME
THE PIANO TEACHER.

272
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,521
(Driver) YOU OKAY?

273
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,939
NO.

274
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,274
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

275
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,942
WELL, I'M SUCH
AN IDIOT WITH CARS.

276
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,486
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO.
DO YOU MIND HELPING ME?

277
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,823
(Man) WELL, OF COURSE
IT WON'T WORK.

278
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,658
SPARKPLUG CAPS HAVE
BEEN REMOVED.

279
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,493
YES, I DID THAT.

280
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,579
WAS THAT WRONG?

281
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,831
(Joe's voice)
FOR THE FIRST TIME I HAD

282
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,375
THE PLEASURE OF HAVING
AN 8-CYLINDER CAR.

283
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,753
THE POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS
OF EIGHT SPARK-PLUG CAPS

284
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,091
ON EIGHT SPARK PLUGS
ARE 40,320,

285
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,385
IF I REMEMBERED
MY MATH CORRECTLY.

286
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,096
AND ONLY ONE OF THESE

287
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,015
WILL MAKE THE CAR RUN,

288
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,309
WHICH GAVE ME
ALL THE TIME I NEEDED.

289
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,019
- ("Für Elise" playing)
- (Man) BEETHOVEN, HUH?

290
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,979
HE WAS CERTAINLY
VERY GOOD, BUT, YOU KNOW,

291
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,231
- HE COULDN'T WRITE A FUGUE.
- YOU THINK SO?

292
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,567
WELL...

293
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,194
YEAH, I THINK SO.

294
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,738
("Für Elise" continuing)

295
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,712
IT WOULD BE MORE PRECISE
TO SAY THAT BEETHOVEN

296
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,048
RENEWED THE FUGUE...

297
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:22,094
BUT HE WAS SUCH A VISIONARY
THAT THE OLD BACH PURISTS,

298
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,639
THEY ACCUSED HIM
OF NOT MASTERING IT.

299
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,121
GOOD DAY?

300
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,002
(tile shatters)

301
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,591
("Für Elise" continuing)

302
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,364
(Joe's voice)
AND NOW TO REACH THE HEART

303
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,324
OF YOUR SUFFERING
WESTERN CHURCH,

304
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,035
I HAVE TO JUMP AHEAD
THREE YEARS IN THE STORY

305
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,371
AND TALK ABOUT MY MEETING

306
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,248
WITH WHAT I WOULD CALL

307
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,250
"THE DANGEROUS MEN."

308
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,425
I WAS ALONE WITH MARCEL
A LOT DURING THIS PERIOD,

309
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,386
AS JEROME WAS TRAVELLING
MOST OF THE TIME.

310
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,430
AND WHEN HE WAS FINALLY HOME,

311
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,140
HE SPENT MOST OF THE TIME

312
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,559
ACCUSING ME
OF NEGLECTING MARCEL,

313
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,102
WHICH IN MY OPINION

314
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:56,480
WAS JUST A COVER
FOR HIS ANGER OVER MY LOVERS.

315
00:21:56,606 --> 00:22:00,192
ANY SEXUAL SATISFACTION,
LET ALONE ORGASM,

316
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,987
WAS FURTHER AWAY
THAN EVER BEFORE.

317
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,324
(men speaking
foreign language)

318
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,874
I HAD TO MAKE A CHANGE.

319
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,877
AND SOMEHOW THE INSPIRATION
HAD BEEN RIGHT THERE

320
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,130
BENEATH MY WINDOW
THE WHOLE TIME.

321
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:24,050
I COULD FEEL THAT IT
TURNED ME ON ENORMOUSLY

322
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,053
TO IMAGINE
A SEXUAL SITUATION

323
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:31,015
IN WHICH VERBAL COMMUNICATION
WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

324
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,811
- HELLO.
- HELLO.

325
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,563
I'M TOBIAS,
THE INTERPRETER.

326
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,316
HELLO, I'M JOE.
COME IN.

327
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,152
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MASTER
THE AFRICAN LANGUAGES.

328
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,279
I DO HAVE A BASIS.

329
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,366
WHO AND WHAT NEEDS
INTERPRETATION?

330
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,910
UM, THAT MAN...

331
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,913
THE ONE
WITH THE GREEN JACKET?

332
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,958
YOU ARE TO ASK HIM IF
HE WANTS TO HAVE SEX WITH ME.

333
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,586
YEAH? UM...

334
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,386
(no discernable dialog)

335
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,321
IS IT A GO?

336
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,573
(Tobias)
IT'S HARD TO SAY.

337
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:32,410
I'VE WRITTEN DOWN
THE TIME AND THE PLACE,

338
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,203
BUT, UM...

339
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,957
HONESTLY I WOULDN'T LIKE
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

340
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,167
FOR THE PRECISE WORDING
IN THIS CASE,

341
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,253
WHICH I THINK, UH,

342
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,463
ACCIDENTALLY MAY BELONG

343
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,841
TO A GREY ZONE
IN MY PROFESSION.

344
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,263
(Joe's voice) IT WAS THE ADDRESS
OF A CHEAP HOTEL.

345
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:56,100
(men arguing
in foreign language)

346
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,398
(Seligman's voice)
WHY WERE THERE TWO?

347
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,275
(Joe's voice)
MY WORDS EXACTLY.

348
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,987
APPARENTLY N HAD BROUGHT
HIS BROTHER ALONG.

349
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,947
VERY SORRY.
SORRY, SORRY, SORRY.

350
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,659
(chatting)

351
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,856
(arguing)

352
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,346
(sighs)

353
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,771
(grumbling)

354
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,793
- (moaning)
- (N speaking)

355
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,301
(men arguing)

356
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,143
(groaning)

357
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,940
(arguing)

358
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,534
(Seligman's voice)
WHY WAS HE SO ANGRY?

359
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,202
(Joe's voice)
CLEARLY IT WAS

360
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,246
SOMETHING PERSONAL
BETWEEN THEM,

361
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,040
BUT LATER I HEARD THAT
PERFORMING A SANDWICH

362
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:28,210
REQUIRES GREAT SENSITIVITY,
SINCE THE MEN APPARENTLY

363
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,879
CAN FEEL EACH OTHER
THROUGH THE TISSUE.

364
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,632
I IMAGINE THE QUARREL
HAD ALREADY STARTED

365
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,635
ON THE STAIRS AND THAT ONE
OR THE OTHER PARTY

366
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,555
HAD LAID CLAIM TO ONE
OR THE OTHER OF MY HOLES

367
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,516
IN CONFLICT WITH HIS NEGRO
BROTHER'S INTERESTS.

368
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,394
YOU SHOULDN'T USE THAT WORD.

369
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,063
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU CALL
POLITICALLY CORRECT...

370
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:51,358
- "NEGRO."
- WELL, EXCUSE ME,

371
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,444
BUT IN MY CIRCLES

372
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,488
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A MARK OF
HONOUR TO CALL A SPADE A SPADE.

373
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,200
EACH TIME A WORD
BECOMES PROHIBITED,

374
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,245
YOU REMOVE A STONE FROM
THE DEMOCRATIC FOUNDATION.

375
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:06,081
SOCIETY DEMONSTRATES
ITS IMPOTENCE

376
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,125
IN THE FACE
OF A CONCRETE PROBLEM

377
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,210
BY REMOVING WORDS
FROM THE LANGUAGE.

378
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,463
I THINK SOCIETY
WOULD CLAIM THAT...

379
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,549
THAT POLITICALLY CORRECTNESS
IS A VERY PRECISE EXPRESSION

380
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,385
OF DEMOCRATIC CONCERN
FOR MINORITIES.

381
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,971
AND I SAY THAT SOCIETY

382
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,515
IS AS COWARDLY
AS THE PEOPLE IN IT,

383
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:27,561
WHO IN MY OPINION ARE ALSO
TOO STUPID FOR DEMOCRACY.

384
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:32,650
I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT,
BUT I TOTALLY DISAGREE.

385
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,943
I HAVE NO DOUBT
IN THE HUMAN QUALITIES.

386
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,696
(scoffs)
THE HUMAN QUALITIES

387
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,823
CAN BE EXPRESSED
IN ONE WORD:

388
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,034
HYPOCRISY.

389
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,412
WE ELEVATE THOSE WHO SAY
"RIGHT" BUT MEAN "WRONG"

390
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:49,041
AND MOCK THOSE WHO
SAY "WRONG" BUT MEAN "RIGHT."

391
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,715
BY THE WAY,
I CAN ASSURE YOU

392
00:27:56,841 --> 00:28:00,135
THAT WOMEN WHO CLAIM THAT
NEGROS DON'T TURN THEM ON,

393
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,930
- THEY'RE LYING.
- SO DID THEY SATISFY YOU?

394
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,016
THOSE NE-NEGROS?

395
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,061
NO.

396
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,105
BUT THEY SHOWED ME
THAT THERE WAS A WORLD

397
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,482
FAR FROM MINE
I HAD TO EXPLORE.

398
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,861
AND THERE, OR PERHAPS
ON THE OTHER SIDE,

399
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,531
GET MY LIFE BACK.

400
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,658
(footsteps)

401
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,896
(door opens)

402
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,655
WHO ARE YOU?

403
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,576
I KNOW WHAT YOU DO.

404
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,661
I'D LIKE TO BE

405
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,621
ONE OF THE WOMEN
YOU SEE.

406
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,335
THAT'S OF NO INTEREST.

407
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,968
MADAME.

408
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,350
(door closes)

409
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,081
(footsteps approaching)

410
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,462
(door opens)

411
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,805
PRINCESS,

412
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,765
I SPECIFICALLY
SAID FIVE DAYS,

413
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,934
AND FIVE DAYS
HAVEN'T GONE YET.

414
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:15,020
SO...

415
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,980
YOU'LL HAVE
TO LEAVE.

416
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,148
I'M SORRY.

417
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,203
I, UM...

418
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,122
I DON'T THINK
THIS IS FOR YOU.

419
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,467
(Seligman's voice)
HOW MYSTERIOUS.

420
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,263
WILL YOU GIVE ME
A REASONABLE EXPLANATION NOW

421
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,932
OR SHALL WE WAIT?

422
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,435
I CAN'T GIVE YOU
AN EXPLANATION,

423
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,646
AND CERTAINLY NOT
A REASONABLE...

424
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,567
WHAT EXACTLY WERE
THE RUMOURS ABOUT HIM?

425
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,736
THAT HE WAS VIOLENT.

426
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,947
HOW CAN THAT BE
INCITING?

427
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,745
I THINK THE EASIEST WAY
TO UNDERSTAND IT

428
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,790
IS TO REFER
TO MY REBELLIOUS NATURE.

429
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,377
THIS BUSINESS OF K's WAS

430
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:23,130
SOMETHING I WAS
COMPLETELY AGAINST.

431
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:26,258
SO THE FACT THAT I WAS
NOW CONTACTING HIM WAS

432
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,343
A LAST, DESPERATE ATTEMPT

433
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,470
TO REHABILITATE MY SEXUALITY.

434
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,475
THE SYSTEM WAS
THE OVERRIDING FACTOR WITH K.

435
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,270
A SYSTEM OF VIOLENCE?

436
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,691
WELL, YOU WERE THE ONE

437
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:46,153
WHO INSISTED ON
THE WESTERN CHURCH, RIGHT?

438
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,072
AND I...
I SEEM TO REMEMBER

439
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:52,200
THAT THE SYSTEMATIC
APPROACH

440
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:55,120
TO THE CRUCIFIXION
IS OF A VIOLENT

441
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,247
AND NOT TO SAY
SADISTIC NATURE.

442
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,082
OH YES,
THE PASSION OF CHRIST

443
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,084
IS FULL
OF SYSTEMATIC VIOLENCE...

444
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,586
THE VIA DOLOROSA,

445
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,296
THE NINE STATIONS
OF THE CROSS

446
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,881
AND THE 39 LASHES.

447
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,818
(door opens, closes)

448
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,907
YOU ARE BEGINNING
TO IRRITATE ME.

449
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,086
STAND UP.

450
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,308
I JUST WANT YOU TO SIT

451
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,936
COMPLETELY RELAXED...

452
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,648
WHILE I HIT YOU
IN THE FACE.

453
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,025
NOTHING SPECIAL.

454
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,069
IT'S JUST A...

455
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,405
IT'S JUST A SLAP.

456
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,161
ARE YOU READY?

457
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,916
(grunts)

458
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,550
- (grunts)
- (yelps)

459
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,059
LET ME TELL YOU
THE RULES THEN.

460
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,769
(sniffs)

461
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,523
THE FIRST RULE IS
THAT I DON'T FUCK YOU

462
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,651
AND THAT THERE ISN'T ANY
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT.

463
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,864
THEN WHAT DO YOU
GET OUT OF IT?

464
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,490
THAT'S MY BUSINESS

465
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:58,869
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO MENTION IT AGAIN.

466
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,580
THE SECOND RULE IS THAT
WE HAVE NO SAFE WORD.

467
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:06,251
MEANING THAT IF YOU, UH,
GO INSIDE WITH ME,

468
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,795
THERE IS NOTHING
THAT YOU CAN SAY

469
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,505
THAT WILL MAKE ME STOP

470
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:13,091
ANY PLAN OR PROCEDURE.

471
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:18,388
YOU MUST BRING A BROWN
USED LEATHER RIDING CROP.

472
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,727
AND NOT ONE FROM A SHOP
SELLING SEX TOYS.

473
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,855
IT'S NOT A MASQUERADE.

474
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:31,443
THIRD RULE:

475
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,904
IF I CHOOSE TO LET YOU IN,

476
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,907
YOU HAVE TO BE
SITTING OUT HERE.

477
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,034
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU...

478
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,203
YOU WON'T KNOW WHEN.

479
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,913
ONLY THAT IT WILL BE

480
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,623
SOMETIME BETWEEN...

481
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,375
2:00 AND 6:00 AT NIGHT.

482
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,544
I CAN'T STAY HERE
THAT LATE.

483
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,339
MY BABYSITTER'S
NOT RELIABLE AND...

484
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,049
I CAN'T LEAVE MY CHILD.

485
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,303
YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW MY NAME!

486
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,347
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN YOUR NAME.

487
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,059
HERE YOUR NAME IS...

488
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,188
FIDO.

489
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,490
(baby fussing)

490
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,329
(Babysitter)
MARCEL'S AWAKE.

491
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,581
D'YOU WANT TO SAY GOODBYE
TO YOUR MOM?

492
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,292
(kisses)
GOODBYE.

493
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,296
(kisses)

494
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,347
I'LL TAKE YOUR COAT.

495
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,953
I'D LIKE YOU TO HAVE
YOUR HAIR UP.

496
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,956
YOU CAN USE THIS.

497
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,126
JUST IN CASE
IT BECOMES NECESSARY FOR ME

498
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,627
TO HIT YOU IN THE FACE.

499
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,547
SHOULD I TAKE
MY CLOTHES OFF?

500
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,092
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT TO DO...

501
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,052
AND WHEN.

502
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,557
NOW YOU MAY BEND DOWN.

503
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,184
HOW?

504
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,937
APPROACH THE CHAIR.

505
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,107
NOW BEND FROM THE HIPS.

506
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,529
LOOK FORWARD.
LOOK FORWARD.

507
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,823
WITH YOUR HEAD UP.
HEAD UP.

508
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,742
KEEP LOOKING FORWARD.

509
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,207
(banging)

510
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,417
KEEP LOOKING FORWARD.

511
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,924
YOU MAY STAND UP.

512
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,177
WE HAVE TO USE
THE COUCH.

513
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,929
(grunts)

514
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,473
COME THIS WAY.

515
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,394
TAKE IT EASY,
TAKE IT EASY.

516
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,065
BEND OVER.

517
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,736
LAY YOUR ARMS
OUT STRAIGHT.

518
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:30,330
(heavy breathing)

519
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,790
TAKE IT EASY.

520
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,209
- TAKE IT EASY.
- (metal clicks)

521
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,094
(panting)

522
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,442
(whispers)
TAKE IT EASY.

523
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,435
NEXT TIME
DON'T WEAR KNICKERS.

524
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,747
(ragged breathing)

525
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,335
(sobs)

526
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,254
YOUR ASS IS
NOT HIGH ENOUGH.

527
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,299
I DON'T THINK
WE CAN DO THIS TODAY.

528
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,134
WHAT?

529
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,018
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU AGAIN
ON THURSDAY.

530
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,194
WHAT'S WRONG?

531
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,654
I THINK WE SHOULD
SEE HOW IT GOES ON THURSDAY.

532
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,747
(bangs)

533
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:39,417
(dials, rings)

534
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,961
(Babysitter's voice) Hi, I can't
come to the phone right now.

535
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,797
Please leave a message.
(beeps)

536
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:47,092
YES, THIS IS
MARCEL'S MOTHER AGAIN.

537
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,594
UH, IT'S NOW 1:30.

538
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,097
WE HAD AN AGREEMENT.

539
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,850
I HOPE YOU GET THIS MESSAGE
AND COME AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN.

540
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:00,605
UH, MARCEL IS SLEEPING.

541
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,524
UM...

542
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,567
I HAVE TO GO NOW.

543
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,167
BETTER.

544
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,855
ALSO SO MUCH BETTER.

545
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,815
SO MUCH BETTER.

546
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,949
I AM NOW GOING
TO HIT YOU 12 TIMES

547
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,784
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
YOU SCREAM...

548
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,119
(taps crop)

549
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:41,206
...'CAUSE NO ONE CAN
HEAR YOU DOWN HERE.

550
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,170
(screams, gasps)

551
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,880
THAT'S, UH...

552
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,466
THAT'S NOT HOW IT GOES.

553
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,720
MOST PEOPLE DON'T SCREAM
UNTIL I HIT THEM.

554
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,359
(gulps)

555
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,069
- (blow strikes)
- (whimpers)

556
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,781
(blow strikes)

557
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,242
(breathing heavily)

558
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,874
(moans)

559
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,386
OH!

560
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,730
(sniffling)

561
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:59,117
THAT'S IT.

562
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,497
THANK YOU.

563
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:06,916
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

564
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:16,301
I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE GET
OUR SEXUALITY FROM

565
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,596
OR WHERE TENDENCIES
OF THIS KIND COME FROM.

566
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:24,475
PROBABLY A PERVERSION
CREATED IN OUR CHILDHOOD

567
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,103
THAT NEVER MANIFESTED
ITSELF BEFORE.

568
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,480
WELL, ODDLY ENOUGH,

569
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,859
FREUD SAYS THE OPPOSITE.
HE TALKS ABOUT

570
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,153
THE POLYMORPHIC PERVERSION
OF A CHILD.

571
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,488
MEANING THAT IN A CHILD,

572
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,074
ALL KINDS
OF PERVERSIONS EXIST.

573
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:43,286
AND THEN WE USE
THE CHILDHOOD

574
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,455
TO DIMINISH OR REMOVE
SOME OF THEM.

575
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,917
BASICALLY A CHILD IS
SEXUALLY POLYMORPHIC

576
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:53,004
AND EVERYTHING IS SEXUALITY
IN AN INFANT.

577
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,091
AND YET IT WAS
DEEPLY BIZARRE

578
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,260
TO LIE THERE

579
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,429
AND ESPECIALLY TO WANT
TO LIE THERE.

580
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:04,891
IT IS AN INTERESTING POINT
THAT YOU ACTUALLY LUBRICATED

581
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,852
IN EXPECTATION FOR A PAIN

582
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,937
THAT YOU HADN'T
EXPERIENCED.

583
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,775
YOUR BODY PREPARED ITSELF

584
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,819
FOR AN INTERCOURSE THAT
YOU KNEW WOULDN'T HAPPEN.

585
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:22,158
(Joe's voice) I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE
THE MOOD AS SEXUAL.

586
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,787
AS I TWISTED AND TURNED

587
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,914
WHILE HE WAS WHIPPING ME,

588
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,500
I COULD FEEL HOW CLEVER
HIS KNOTS WERE.

589
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,671
IF I FOUGHT THEM,
THEY WOULD GET TIGHTER,

590
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,090
AND AS I RELAXED,

591
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,841
IT SEEMED THEY DID TOO.

592
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,345
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT KIND OF KNOT

593
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:45,056
K USED...

594
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,850
BUT I KNOW OF A KNOT

595
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:51,229
THAT TIGHTENS WHEN
FORCE IS EXERTED

596
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,981
AND VICE VERSA.
IT'S CALLED A PRUSIK KNOT.

597
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:59,112
IT'S AFTER A MAN CALLED PRUSIK.
HE WAS A MOUNTAIN CLIMBER.

598
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:01,364
AND HE AND A FRIEND
WERE OUT CLIMBING

599
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,741
AND THEY HAD AN ACCIDENT

600
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,660
AND HIS FRIEND DIED.

601
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:08,830
AND HE ENDED UP HANGING
AT THE END OF A ROPE

602
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:12,166
WITH NO POSSIBILITY
OF GETTING UP.

603
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:15,586
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T CLIMB UP
A MOUNTAIN-CLIMBER ROPE.

604
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,755
IT'S TOO THIN.

605
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,632
BUT HE WAS
AN INTELLIGENT MAN,

606
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:23,386
AND WITH HIS BACK TO THE WALL
HE WAS A GENIUS.

607
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:28,015
AND HE TOOK THE SHOELACES
OUT OF HIS BOOTS

608
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:32,562
AND MADE TWO LOOPS
AND AFFIXED THEM TO THE ROPE.

609
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,522
AND HE COULD MOVE THESE UP

610
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,482
WHEN THEY WEREN'T
UNDER TENSION.

611
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,776
AND THEN HE COULD
STEP INTO THEM

612
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,070
AND CLIMB THE ROPE
AND SAVE HIMSELF.

613
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,905
(pebbles clattering)

614
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:44,741
PRUSIK.

615
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:51,247
I THINK THIS WAS ONE
OF YOUR WEAKEST DIGRESSIONS.

616
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,253
MAY I CONTINUE?

617
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,714
WELL, BE MY GUEST.

618
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,639
(coins clinking)

619
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,870
(exhales)

620
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,970
I SOMETIMES GIVE
A CHRISTMAS PRESENT.

621
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:52,600
BUT, UH, YOU HAVE TO DO
THE WORK YOURSELF.

622
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,367
THIS IS CALLED
A BLOOD KNOT.

623
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,119
YOU HAVE TO MAKE
NINE ROPES

624
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,205
WITH THREE BLOOD KNOTS
ON EACH.

625
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,207
LET ME SEE YOU DO IT.

626
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,793
YOU DECIDE
WHETHER TO MAKE FOUR,

627
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,003
FIVE OR SIX TURNS

628
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:22,755
IN THE VARIOUS KNOTS.

629
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:14,015
(ragged breathing)

630
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:44,629
(plow beeping)

631
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,312
(ticking)

632
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:05,274
- (Marcel coos)
- (truck engine stops)

633
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,779
(beeping, engine starts)

634
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:15,034
(grunting)

635
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,294
(babbling)

636
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,383
(opera music playing)

637
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,112
(coos)

638
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,975
JOE?

639
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,520
HELLO.

640
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,323
MARCEL?

641
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,287
MARCEL!

642
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,044
(Marcel crying)

643
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,506
(wailing)

644
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,609
(scratches)

645
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:18,532
- ARE YOU FOND OF ME STILL?
- YES.

646
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:21,327
MORE FOND OF ME
THAN THE OTHERS?

647
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,872
- YES?
- (Joe) YES.

648
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,877
YOU'RE NOT THINKING OF LEAVING
AGAIN TONIGHT, ARE YOU?

649
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:31,462
- NO.
- NO?

650
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,923
- NO, NO. NOT AT ALL.
- ARE YOU SURE?

651
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:36,926
YEAH.

652
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,719
ARE YOU LYING
TO ME, JOE?

653
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:41,388
- NO.
- BE HONEST.

654
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,474
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

655
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,894
JUST FUCKING SAY IT.

656
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,979
NO, I... I JUST
WANT TO BE HERE.

657
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,397
WHY?

658
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,403
I DON'T KNOW.

659
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,411
IF YOU LEAVE TONIGHT...

660
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:09,166
YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME OR MARCEL
EVER AGAIN IN YOUR LIFE.

661
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,880
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

662
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:15,232
(sobbing)

663
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,125
IS THIS GOODBYE?

664
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,547
- (continues sobbing)
- IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

665
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:40,674
MARCEL, GET UP.

666
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,885
- (Joe) STOP IT.
- IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

667
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,347
HERE, SO YOU COULD SEE HIM.

668
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,057
LOOK AT HIM, JOE.

669
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,398
LET'S FACE IT, JOE,
YOU'RE NOT A MOTHER.

670
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,527
- (sobbing)
- LET'S WAKE HIM UP.

671
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:03,280
MARCEL, BABY BOY,

672
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,908
- SAY, "BYE, MOM."
- (fussing)

673
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:08,410
- PLEASE PUT HIM BACK.
- IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT?

674
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:10,704
- HMM?
- (Marcel cries)

675
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:13,249
- MA.
- YOU SEE?

676
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,918
YOU SEE,
HE WANTS YOU.

677
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,420
COME.

678
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,591
IT'S CHRISTMAS.
IT'S FUCKING CHRISTMAS.

679
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,069
(footsteps)

680
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:44,321
(door opens)

681
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,700
WHAT IS THIS?

682
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,204
TODAY IT'S MADAME
WHO MUST WAIT.

683
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,007
MADAME, I'M VERY SORRY,

684
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:06,343
BUT I HAVE TO HAVE
A FEW WORDS WITH FIDO FIRST.

685
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,407
I REALLY OUGHT TO
SEND YOU HOME.

686
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:52,181
HAPPY CHRISTMAS, FIDO.

687
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:54,493
(pants)

688
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:56,745
(whispers)
I WANT YOUR COCK.

689
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,247
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

690
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:01,291
(inhales)
I WANT YOUR COCK.

691
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,127
NO. NO, YOU DON'T.

692
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,045
- NO, YOU DON'T. NO.
- (sobs)

693
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:10,134
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU TODAY?

694
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,450
ON ACCOUNT OF THE HOLIDAYS

695
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,910
AND YOUR BEHAVIOUR TODAY,

696
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:40,122
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
THE ORIGINAL ROMAN MAXIMUM

697
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:42,833
OF 40 LASHES.
ARE YOU READY, FIDO?

698
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,712
I'M READY.

699
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:54,303
ONE.

700
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,556
TWO.

701
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,893
- (yelps)
- THREE.

702
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,855
FOUR.

703
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,316
FIVE.

704
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:10,944
SIX.

705
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:14,948
(panting)

706
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,710
(Joe's voice) I'D SEEN THROUGH
K's KNOT TECHNIQUE,

707
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:30,547
SO I WAS ABLE TO LOOSEN MY
POSITION A BIT TO MOVE MY PELVIS,

708
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,133
AND THEREBY
STIMULATE MY CLITORIS

709
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:35,093
AGAINST THE COVER
OF THE BOOK.

710
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,903
(gasping)

711
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,955
(loud moaning)

712
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,591
AND WHEN YOU CAME HOME,

713
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:17,135
JEROME AND THE CHILD
WERE GONE?

714
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,770
I HAVEN'T SEEN MARCEL SINCE.

715
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:31,024
(shatters)

716
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,110
THE SENTIMENTALITY OF...

717
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,903
I HATE IT.

718
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:39,950
WHY?

719
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,411
BECAUSE IT'S A LIE.

720
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,125
ARE YOU SURE?

721
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,171
(pottery scrapes)

722
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,593
JEROME UNDERSTOOD
THAT HE COULDN'T PRIORITISE

723
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,929
HIS LIFE ACCORDING
TO A CHILD EITHER.

724
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,600
SO HE PUT HIM
IN A FOSTER HOME.

725
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:11,189
MY ONLY CONTACT TO THE BOY
IS THE THOUSAND POUNDS

726
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,191
I PUT IN HIS ACCOUNT
EVERY MONTH.

727
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:16,153
ANONYMOUSLY.

728
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:20,365
AS A PENANCE.

729
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:40,552
AFTER ALL THIS SADNESS,
MAY I ASK...

730
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,349
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE SILENT DUCK?

731
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,559
OH SHIT.

732
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:51,897
THE SILENT DUCK.
I'D FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT IT.

733
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:56,526
ONE NIGHT K HAD BEEN IN
WHAT WAS FOR HIM

734
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,487
AN UNUSUALLY GOOD MOOD.

735
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:01,073
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT,
BUT HE DIDN'T HIT HARD

736
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,659
AND HE JOKED THAT
HE WOULD INTRODUCE ME

737
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:06,870
TO THE CONCEPT
OF THE SILENT DUCK.

738
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,706
(silent)

739
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,641
(Seligman's voice)
ONE HARDLY DARE IMAGINE

740
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,810
"THE QUACKING DUCK."

741
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,562
(loud quacking)

742
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,654
OH.

743
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:47,160
WELL, DEEP DOWN,
LITTLE K SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN

744
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:50,706
A JOLLY MAN
WITH VERSATILE TALENTS.

745
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:53,250
BUT HE GOT THAT BIT ABOUT

746
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,961
ROMAN PUNISHMENT
AND THE 40 LASHES WRONG.

747
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:58,839
BECAUSE IT'S TRUE THAT
THE HIGHEST PUNISHMENT

748
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,507
WAS 40 LASHES,

749
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,634
BUT IT HAD TO BE DELIVERED
IN SERIES OF THREE.

750
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:06,263
THAT'S WHY JESUS
ONLY GOT 39 LASHES,

751
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,223
BECAUSE THREE GOES INTO 39

752
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:11,226
BUT NOT INTO 40.

753
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:17,649
YOU HAVE A MIRROR.

754
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:20,110
YES.

755
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:22,446
IT'S LIKE A THOUGHT,
ISN'T IT?

756
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,453
ARE YOU READY
FOR ANOTHER CHAPTER?

757
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,163
GO ON.

758
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,167
(rattling)

759
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:59,107
(Joe's voice) SOME YEARS LATER,
THE BODILY ABUSE

760
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:01,151
BEGAN TO HAVE AN EFFECT.

761
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:04,696
FIRST, RARE BLEEDINGS
FROM MY CLITORIS,

762
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:07,741
BUT THEN THEY BECAME
MORE AND MORE FREQUENT.

763
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:18,919
(Woman) COME IN.

764
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:23,381
HAVE YOU HEARD ANY OF
THE RUMOURS ABOUT YOURSELF?

765
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:30,055
THEY SAY YOU SEE MEN
EVERY EVENING.

766
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,685
AND SPEND ALL NIGHT
WITH THEM.

767
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,647
THEY SAY YOU CAN'T BE TRUSTED...
ALL OF THEM.

768
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,902
WHY DO THEY SAY THAT?

769
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:48,532
I SUPPOSE
THEY'RE AFRAID THAT I...

770
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,409
I CAN'T KEEP AWAY
FROM THEIR MEN.

771
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,498
RIGHT.

772
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:59,209
- AND CAN YOU?
- NO.

773
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:05,257
I'VE SPOKEN
WITH A PSYCHOLOGIST.

774
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,427
HE SAYS YOU'RE ADDICTED,
BUT THAT IT'S NOT

775
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,930
THE KIND OF ADDICTION
THAT CAN'T BE TREATED.

776
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:13,932
THEY HAVE SOME GROUPS.

777
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:17,727
I KNOW ABOUT
THESE KINDS OF GROUPS.

778
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:21,147
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY TO A PSYCHOLOGIST.

779
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,775
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THERAPY.
I'M DEMANDING IT.

780
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,029
EVEN IF YOU LEAVE US, IT'LL BE
THE SAME AT YOUR NEXT JOB

781
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:29,906
AND THE ONE AFTER THAT.

782
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:39,541
MY NAME IS JOE...

783
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:41,084
(Group) HI, JOE.

784
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,836
...AND I'M A NYMPHOMANIAC.

785
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,880
(Therapist) SEX ADDICT.

786
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:47,465
MY NAME IS JOE
AND I'M A NYMPHOMANIAC.

787
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,342
WE SAY SEX ADDICT.

788
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:51,011
HERE EVERYONE'S
THE SAME.

789
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:56,558
YOU SHOULD ONLY SPEAK
WHEN YOU FEEL YOU HAVE TO.

790
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:00,770
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS THAT

791
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,356
NO ONE CAN REMOVE
THEIR SEXUALITY

792
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:05,942
EVEN THOUGH IT'S DESTROYING
EVERYTHING FOR THEM.

793
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:08,153
I WOULDN'T SAY NO ONE.

794
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:10,614
BUT LET'S SAY,
AT MOST, ONE IN A MILLION

795
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,241
MANAGE TO LIVE A LIFE
WITHOUT SEXUALITY.

796
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:16,286
BUT YOU CAN'T BE
BASING YOUR THERAPY

797
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,246
- ON THAT ONE IN A MILLION.
- NO.

798
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:21,541
THE FIRST
AND MOST IMPORTANT STEP

799
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:24,753
IS TO REMOVE INCENTIVE
AND TO REDUCE EXPOSURE.

800
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:28,882
YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF

801
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:30,884
WHAT KIND OF
INCENTIVES YOU HAVE

802
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,719
AND THEN MAKE IT
DIFFICULT FOR YOURSELF

803
01:05:32,845 --> 01:05:34,012
TO COME INTO CONTACT
WITH THEM.

804
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:36,598
BASICALLY ANYTHING THAT
MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT SEX.

805
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:52,484
JOE HAS SOMETHING
SHE'D LIKE TO SHARE.

806
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:56,071
MY NAME IS JOE...

807
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:57,197
(Group) HI, JOE.

808
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:59,574
...AND I'M A SEX ADDICT,

809
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,952
BUT I HAVEN'T HAD SEX
FOR THREE WEEKS AND FIVE DAYS.

810
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:06,247
(applause)

811
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:07,957
TELL US
HOW YOU DID IT, JOE.

812
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,627
- YOU BROUGHT NOTES?
- YES.

813
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:18,009
"DEAR EVERYONE,

814
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:20,428
DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN EASY,

815
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:24,682
BUT I UNDERSTAND NOW
THAT WE ARE ALL ALIKE."

816
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:41,783
ARE YOU OKAY, JOE?

817
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:43,868
YES, YES.

818
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:47,705
WOULD YOU LIKE
A GLASS OF WATER?

819
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:51,126
THANK YOU.

820
01:08:57,591 --> 01:08:59,467
WOULD YOU RATHER
SHARE ANOTHER TIME?

821
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:07,392
NO, I'D LIKE TO SPEAK.

822
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,150
DEAR EVERYONE,

823
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:18,111
DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN EASY,

824
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,572
BUT I UNDERSTAND NOW

825
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:22,490
THAT WE'RE NOT

826
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:25,118
AND NEVER WILL BE ALIKE.

827
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:29,414
I'M NOT LIKE YOU,

828
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,833
WHO FUCKS TO BE VALIDATED

829
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:34,711
AND MIGHT JUST AS WELL GIVE UP
PUTTING COCKS INSIDE YOU.

830
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,796
AND I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

831
01:09:36,922 --> 01:09:39,215
ALL YOU WANT
IS TO BE FILLED UP,

832
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:41,843
AND WHETHER
IT'S BY A MAN OR BY TONS

833
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:45,680
OF DISGUSTING SLOP
MAKES NO DIFFERENCE.

834
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,559
AND I'M DEFINITELY
NOT LIKE YOU.

835
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:52,020
THAT EMPATHY YOU CLAIM

836
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:53,855
IS A LIE,

837
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:57,650
BECAUSE ALL YOU ARE IS
SOCIETY'S MORALITY POLICE,

838
01:09:57,776 --> 01:10:01,362
WHOSE DUTY IS
TO ERASE MY OBSCENITY

839
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:03,031
FROM THE SURFACE
OF THE EARTH

840
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:05,617
SO THAT THE BOURGEOISIE
WON'T FEEL SICK.

841
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:08,870
I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

842
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:12,123
I AM A NYMPHOMANIAC,

843
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:14,834
AND I LOVE MYSELF
FOR BEING ONE.

844
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,961
BUT ABOVE ALL,

845
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,922
I LOVE MY CUNT

846
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:22,050

DIRTY LUST.

WITH THE CAR THAT BURNED.

NO, I'M SORRY.

857
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,209
I WAS JUST
IN TOO MUCH OF A HURRY

858
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:58,127
TO GET TO THE LAST CHAPTER.

859
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:08,263
I UNDERSTOOD THAT SOCIETY
HAD NO ROOM FOR ME,

860
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:11,182
AND I HAD NO ROOM
FOR SOCIETY

861
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:13,184
AND NEVER HAD.

862
01:11:21,568 --> 01:11:23,653
I'M SURE IT WAS
QUITE NATURAL FOR YOU

863
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:26,030
TO FURNISH YOUR ROOM
AS A MONK'S CELL,

864
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:30,243
BUT AS AN INSPIRATION FOR
THE STORY CHAPTER HEADINGS,

865
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:32,537
IT HASN'T BEEN EASY.

866
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:36,582
THERE'S SIMPLY NOTHING LEFT
FOR ME TO USE.

867
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:40,295
WELL, I'M SORRY
ABOUT THAT.

868
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:43,381
BUT IF I MAY,
I CAN GIVE YOU A TIP.

869
01:11:44,591 --> 01:11:46,301
YES, PLEASE.

870
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:50,096
YOU KNOW, I OCCUPY MYSELF
MOSTLY WITH TEXT,

871
01:11:50,222 --> 01:11:52,682
BUT SOMETIMES THE TEXT
CAN SEEM SO...

872
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:57,645
SO EMPTY,
SO UNFATHOMABLY EMPTY.

873
01:11:57,771 --> 01:12:01,774
IT COULD BE THE BEST TEXT
BY THE MOST FAMOUS AUTHOR.

874
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:05,111
THE SOLUTION MIGHT BE
TO CHANGE YOUR POINT OF VIEW.

875
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:08,573
I-I DON'T GET THAT.

876
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:10,908
THINGS HIDE...

877
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,828
WHEN THEY
BECOME FAMILIAR.

878
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:16,789
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THEM
FROM ANOTHER ANGLE,

879
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,877
THEY MIGHT TAKE ON
A NEW MEANING.

880
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:34,140
YOU'RE RIGHT.

881
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:36,476
BEFORE THIS WAS JUST

882
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,895
THE STAIN
FROM THE TEA I THREW.

883
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,232
CAN YOU SEE
WHAT IT COULD BE?

884
01:12:45,402 --> 01:12:46,736
(Seligman) A REVOLVER.

885
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:50,073
NO, A REVOLVER HAS
A DRUM THAT REVOLVES.

886
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:52,700
IT'S A PISTOL.

887
01:12:52,826 --> 01:12:54,786
CAN YOU SEE
WHAT KIND IT COULD BE?

888
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:56,579
NO, I DON'T REMEMBER

889
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:58,539
ANYTHING LIKE THAT
FROM MY LITERATURE.

890
01:12:58,665 --> 01:13:01,209
OH, BUT IT'S SOMETHING
I CAN REMEMBER FROM MINE.

891
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:02,335

892
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,213

893
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:08,633
IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THAT, YOU
HAVEN'T READ ANYTHING AT ALL.

894
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:13,429
THIS COULD BE,
WITH A LITTLE IMAGINATION,

895
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:16,724
A WALTHER P.P.K. AUTOMATIC,

896
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:19,394
THE SAME GUN
THAT WAS ISSUED TO BOND

897
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:23,022
AFTER HIS PREFERRED PISTOL,
THE BERETTA, HAD JAMMED.

898
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,692
IS THAT SOMETHING
YOU CAN USE?

899
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,613

01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:44,043
OR IT LEFT ME,
I CANNOT SAY.

906
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:47,255

TO THE SHADY SIDE

909
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,136
OF THE DEBT-COLLECTING
BUSINESS,

910
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:55,930
WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS
INVOLVED STUFF

911
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:58,099
LIKE BURNING PEOPLE'S CARS.

912
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:03,604
I HAD FOR A LONG TIME
KNOWN ABOUT THIS MAN, L.

913
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:10,903
HI, MY NAME IS JOE.

914
01:14:11,905 --> 01:14:13,698
I KNOW THAT.

915
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:15,825
COME IN.

916
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,998
I'M LOOKING FOR A JOB.

917
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:25,501
I'VE BEEN WORKING
IN AN OFFICE,

918
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:27,420
AND I WAS NEVER
REALLY GOOD AT IT.

919
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:29,797
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.
I MEAN,

920
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:31,841
WHAT'S THE POINT?

921
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:34,427
I BELIEVE I POSSESS
SOME QUALIFICATIONS

922
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:37,263
AND THAT I'M RATHER
UNSCRUPULOUS.

923
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:39,098
I KNOW ALL ABOUT
YOUR QUALIFICATIONS

924
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:40,766
AND THEY'RE EXCELLENT.

925
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:42,852
I WOULD SUGGEST

926
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:46,022
THAT YOU START
YOUR OWN LITTLE BUSINESS

927
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:47,773
WITH MY HELP.

928
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,484
I UNDERSTAND

929
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:52,361
YOU POSSESS
A GREAT DEAL OF INSIGHT

930
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,989
ABOUT A RATHER
BROAD SPECTRUM OF MEN.

931
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:59,785
THIS COULD BE... OR SHOULD
BE CAPITALISED ON.

932
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:02,872
I NEED SUB-CONTRACTORS
WHO CAN PUT

933
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:05,082
MODERATE PRESSURE
ON INDIVIDUALS

934
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:07,877
WITH WHOM MY CLIENTS
RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY

935
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:10,338
HAVE A BONE TO PICK.
UNDERSTAND?

936
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:12,131
EXTORTION.

937
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:13,466
NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

938
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:17,428
I ALWAYS PREFER THE TERM

939
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:19,180
"DEBT COLLECTION."

940
01:15:20,724 --> 01:15:22,308
- YEAH.
- I REFRAIN FROM JUDGING

941
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:24,268
WHETHER MY CLIENTS' WISHES

942
01:15:24,394 --> 01:15:26,562
ARE LEGITIMATE OR OTHERWISE.

943
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:28,439
A POINT OF VIEW

944
01:15:28,565 --> 01:15:31,484
I STRONGLY RECOMMEND
YOU FOLLOW.

945
01:15:33,403 --> 01:15:35,029
(Joe's voice) MY MAIN
QUALIFICATION OF COURSE

946
01:15:35,155 --> 01:15:37,740
WAS MY CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
WITH MEN AND SEX.

947
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:41,494
BUT EVEN MY MORE SPECIALISED
SKILLS CAME IN HANDY.

948
01:15:53,757 --> 01:15:55,550
(man panting)

949
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,433
(screams)

950
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,478
NO, NOW THIS IS NOT
HOW IT GOES.

951
01:16:07,604 --> 01:16:09,939
YOU HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL YOU'RE HIT.

952
01:16:11,483 --> 01:16:13,192
(cracks)

953
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:16,362
THE TWO HELPERS THAT L
HAD RECOMMENDED WERE OKAY,

954
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:19,991
BUT THEY WERE PREDISPOSED TO
A RATHER REPETITIVE TECHNIQUE,

955
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:24,203
WHICH CONSISTED OF CREATING
AS MUCH HAVOC AS POSSIBLE

956
01:16:24,329 --> 01:16:26,414
WITH A PAIR OF IRON BARS.

957
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:35,131
(shards clatter)

958
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:45,433
DESTROYING YOUR THINGS DOESN'T
SEEM TO HAVE MUCH EFFECT ON YOU.

959
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,602
(Joe's voice)
HERE WAS A MAN

960
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:49,729
I WAS UNABLE
TO READ SEXUALLY,

961
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:51,772
SO I BECAME PERSISTENT.

962
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:54,567
TIE HIM TO THE CHAIR.

963
01:16:57,195 --> 01:16:58,321
DON'T HURT HIM.

964
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,239
(tape ripping)

965
01:17:01,908 --> 01:17:03,993
I CAN'T FIND A STAIN ON YOU,

966
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:07,705
BUT MY EXPERIENCE TELLS ME
THAT NO MAN IS SPOTLESS.

967
01:17:07,831 --> 01:17:09,749
LUCKILY, YOU'RE EQUIPPED

968
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:12,501
WITH A VERY RELIABLE
TRUTH-DETECTOR.

969
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:22,720
(man grunts)

970
01:17:22,846 --> 01:17:25,765
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU
A FEW STORIES.

971
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:28,351
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS LISTEN.

972
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:34,106
YOU'RE IN A BAR
WATCHING A COUPLE...

973
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:36,484
(Joe's voice) I NOW METICULOUSLY
WENT THROUGH THE CATALOGUE

974
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:39,403
OF SEXUAL DEVIATIONS
IN FICTIONAL FORM.

975
01:17:39,529 --> 01:17:42,907
STORIES ABOUT
SADOMASOCHISM,

976
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:45,743
FETISHISM,
HOMOSEXUALITY,

977
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:47,578
YOU NAME IT.

978
01:17:47,704 --> 01:17:49,330
BUT HE DIDN'T REACT.

979
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:52,083
AND I'D ALMOST GIVEN UP
WHEN I SAID:

980
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:55,795
ON YOUR WAY HOME,
YOU WALK THROUGH THE PARK.

981
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:03,052
AND SOMETHING
MAKES YOU STOP.

982
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,305
YOU HEAR SOMETHING.

983
01:18:06,431 --> 01:18:08,599
(silent)

984
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:21,946
YES, THAT'S IT.

985
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:24,782
YOU CAN HEAR THE CHILDREN
ON THE PLAYGROUND.

986
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:28,577
YOU SIT ON A BENCH NEARBY

987
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,913
AND WATCH THEM PLAY.

988
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:34,250
THERE'S A LITTLE BOY
IN SHORTS.

989
01:18:36,002 --> 01:18:38,170
HE'S PLAYING
IN THE SANDPIT.

990
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:42,049
HE LOOKS AT YOU

991
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:44,885
WITH HIS BLUE EYES.

992
01:18:46,763 --> 01:18:48,556
HE SMILES AT YOU.

993
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:50,975
I THINK HE COMES TO YOU.

994
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:54,019
HE SITS ON YOUR LAP

995
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:55,771
AND LOOKS UP AT YOUR FACE.

996
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:58,482
HE SAYS

997
01:18:58,608 --> 01:19:01,152
HE'D LIKE TO COME
HOME WITH YOU.

998
01:19:04,781 --> 01:19:08,033
AT HOME
YOU CAN'T FIGHT THE IDEA

999
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,244
OF BEING NAKED TOGETHER.

1000
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:12,872
HE CRAWLS ALL OVER YOU.

1001
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:17,084
- YOU GET AN ERECTION.
- WON'T YOU PLEASE STOP?

1002
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:20,671
HE LIES ON HIS STOMACH.

1003
01:19:20,797 --> 01:19:22,882
YOU PULL DOWN HIS PANTS.

1004
01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:25,384
I'LL PAY!

1005
01:19:32,517 --> 01:19:34,643
(sobbing)

1006
01:19:58,251 --> 01:19:59,752
YOU DID WHAT?

1007
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:02,213
I GAVE HIM A BLOWJOB.

1008
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:04,256
WHY?
THAT PIG?!

1009
01:20:04,382 --> 01:20:07,009
- I TOOK PITY ON HIM.
- PITY?

1010
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:10,429
YES. I HAD JUST
DESTROYED HIS LIFE.

1011
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:13,307
NOBODY KNEW HIS SECRET,

1012
01:20:13,433 --> 01:20:15,643
MOST PROBABLY
NOT EVEN HIMSELF.

1013
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:18,729
HE SAT THERE
WITH THE SHAME.

1014
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:23,067
I SUPPOSE I SUCKED HIM OFF
AS A KIND OF APOLOGY.

1015
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:24,443
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

1016
01:20:25,695 --> 01:20:27,404
NO, LISTEN TO ME.
THIS IS A MAN

1017
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:30,741
WHO'D SUCCEEDED
IN REPRESSING HIS OWN DESIRE,

1018
01:20:30,867 --> 01:20:33,202
WHO HAD NEVER BEFORE
GIVEN INTO IT

1019
01:20:33,328 --> 01:20:35,996
RIGHT UP UNTIL
I FORCED IT OUT.

1020
01:20:36,122 --> 01:20:38,499
HE HAD LIVED A LIFE
FULL OF DENIAL

1021
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:40,751
AND HAD NEVER HURT A SOUL.

1022
01:20:40,877 --> 01:20:42,711
I THINK
THAT'S LAUDABLE.

1023
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:45,631
NO MATTER
HOW HARD I TRY,

1024
01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:48,050
I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING
LAUDABLE IN PAEDOPHILIA.

1025
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:49,718
THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU THINK ABOUT

1026
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:53,222
THE PERHAPS 5%
WHO ACTUALLY HURT CHILDREN.

1027
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:55,724
THE REMAINING 95%

1028
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:58,727
NEVER LIVE OUT
THEIR FANTASIES.

1029
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:01,480
THINK ABOUT
THEIR SUFFERING.

1030
01:21:01,606 --> 01:21:04,233
SEXUALITY IS
THE STRONGEST FORCE

1031
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:06,068
IN HUMAN BEINGS.

1032
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:08,863
TO BE BORN
WITH A FORBIDDEN SEXUALITY

1033
01:21:08,989 --> 01:21:10,823
MUST BE AGONISING.

1034
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,702
THE PAEDOPHILE WHO MANAGES
TO GET THROUGH LIFE

1035
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:17,288
WITH THE SHAME
OF HIS DESIRE

1036
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:21,250
WHILE NEVER ACTING ON IT
DESERVES A BLOODY MEDAL.

1037
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:28,966
BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER REASON
FOR MY SYMPATHY,

1038
01:21:29,092 --> 01:21:31,385
WHICH YOU FIND
SO MYSTERIOUS.

1039
01:21:34,097 --> 01:21:38,058
I SAW A MAN WHO WAS CARRYING
THE SAME CROSS AS MYSELF.

1040
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:42,396
LONELINESS.

1041
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:48,152
WE WERE BOTH
SEXUAL OUTCASTS.

1042
01:21:57,162 --> 01:21:59,663
IN ANY CASE,
SOME YEARS PASSED,

1043
01:21:59,789 --> 01:22:01,457
DURING WHICH
MY BUSINESS GREW,

1044
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:04,877
ENABLING ME TO STEP UP
MY ANONYMOUS DEPOSITS

1045
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:06,629
TO MARCEL.

1046
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:10,758
YOUR BUSINESS
IS DOING GREAT...

1047
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:15,679
YOU COMPLETE ALL THE JOBS
I GIVE YOU TO PERFECTION

1048
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:19,141
AND I HEAR ONLY WORDS OF PRAISE
FROM YOUR OTHER CLIENTS,

1049
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:21,393
- BUT...
- BUT WHAT?

1050
01:22:21,519 --> 01:22:23,312
WE AREN'T
GETTING ANY YOUNGER.

1051
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:25,940
OH.
NO, THAT'S FOR SURE.

1052
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:28,609
I THINK YOU'RE GETTING
TO THAT AGE

1053
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:31,445
WHERE YOU HAVE TO START
THINKING ABOUT A SUCCESSOR.

1054
01:22:32,405 --> 01:22:35,491
OH... I DON'T NEED
A FUCKING SUCCESSOR.

1055
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:40,371
LISTEN, A PERSON SHOULD TAKE
THEIR CRIME SERIOUSLY.

1056
01:22:40,497 --> 01:22:42,873
YOU NEED SOMEONE

1057
01:22:42,999 --> 01:22:45,334
TO BE YOUR RIGHT HAND,
SOMEONE TO HELP YOU.

1058
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:47,753
A CROWN PRINCESS.

1059
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:52,091
THE NORMAL PROCESS

1060
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:54,301
IS TO FIND OUT
WHAT COLLEAGUES

1061
01:22:54,427 --> 01:22:56,804
ARE IN PRISON
OR ARE DRUG ADDICTS,

1062
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:58,847
AND THEREBY
UNABLE TO FULFIL

1063
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:00,599
THEIR ROLES AS PARENTS.

1064
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:05,562
THEN YOU FIND OUT WHERE
THEIR KIDS PLAY FOOTBALL...

1065
01:23:06,898 --> 01:23:08,649
AND YOU GET INVOLVED.

1066
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:10,901
YOU CHEER THEM ON
FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS

1067
01:23:11,027 --> 01:23:12,444
NO MATTER HOW BAD THEY ARE.

1068
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:15,781
ACTUALLY, THE WORSE,
THE BETTER. THAT WAY

1069
01:23:15,907 --> 01:23:18,534
GRADUALLY YOU TAKE ON
THE ROLE OF THE PARENT

1070
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,703
UNTIL IN THE END

1071
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:24,373
YOU HAVE A LOYAL HELPER THAT
WILL WALK THROUGH FIRE FOR YOU.

1072
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:27,584
EVEN DO TIME FOR YOU.

1073
01:23:31,923 --> 01:23:33,298
IT SOUNDS LIKE A...

1074
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:36,010
KIND OF AN ENTRAPMENT
YOU'RE SUGGESTING.

1075
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:39,221
- AN UNSAVOURY ENTRAPMENT.
- CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT,

1076
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:41,724
BUT IF YOU BELIEVE AT ALL

1077
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,851
IN THE EFFECTS
OF GOOD PARENTING,

1078
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:46,270
THAT KID WILL HAVE
MUCH GREATER OPPORTUNITIES

1079
01:23:46,396 --> 01:23:48,605
WITH YOU AS A MENTOR
THAN WITHOUT.

1080
01:23:50,066 --> 01:23:52,026
AND SINCE I LIKE YOU,

1081
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:55,320
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AROUND
FOR A SUITABLE SUBJECT.

1082
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:58,282
SHE'S 15 YEARS OLD

1083
01:23:58,408 --> 01:24:01,410
FROM A FAMILY
OF HARDENED CRIMINALS,

1084
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:03,787
AND SHE'S
BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

1085
01:24:03,913 --> 01:24:06,665
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS
SHE'S BEEN INSTITUTIONALISED.

1086
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:10,002
HER FATHER IS IN PRISON AND HER
MOTHER DIED OF AN OVERDOSE.

1087
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:11,712
SHE'S A SMART GIRL.

1088
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:13,881
AND ALTHOUGH
SHE DOESN'T PLAY FOOTBALL,

1089
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:16,383
SHE DOES PLAY BASKETBALL...
VERY BADLY.

1090
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:20,304
SHE'S CHOSEN A TEAM SPORT

1091
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:22,347
BECAUSE SHE'S LONELY.

1092
01:24:23,683 --> 01:24:25,934
I SAVED THE BEST PART
FOR LAST:

1093
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:29,354
HER RIGHT EAR IS
SLIGHTLY DEFORMED...

1094
01:24:30,648 --> 01:24:33,484
WHICH SHE'S
VERY ASHAMED OF,

1095
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:36,570
AND OF COURSE THIS SERVES
TO ISOLATE HER EVEN MORE.

1096
01:24:36,696 --> 01:24:38,489
IT MAKES HER AN EASY TARGET

1097
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:41,700
FOR EVEN THE SLIGHTEST
BIT OF ATTENTION

1098
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:45,454
OR SIGN OF EMPATHY
FROM YOU.

1099
01:24:50,001 --> 01:24:51,960
(Joe's voice)
DESPITE MY PROTESTS,

1100
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:53,796
THE CLEVER L
SOMEHOW TALKED ME

1101
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:55,631
INTO ACTUALLY HAVING
A LOOK AT P.

1102
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:58,050
(cheering)

1103
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:00,427
THE LONGER I WATCHED
THE POOR GIRL

1104
01:25:00,553 --> 01:25:02,137
WITH THE DEFORMED EAR,

1105
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:04,890
THE MORE REPULSIVE
I FOUND THE WHOLE PLAN.

1106
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:07,810
- (shouts)
- (applause)

1107
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:34,128
(Joe's voice) BUT AS IF
L HAD FORESEEN THIS,

1108
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:38,132
THE MEETING WITH P FILLED ME
WITH PITY AND EMOTION.

1109
01:25:39,717 --> 01:25:41,677
AND WITHOUT WANTING TO,

1110
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:44,513
I FOUND MYSELF,
WEEKEND AFTER WEEKEND,

1111
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:48,183
AT HER GAMES
SUPPORTING THE POOR PLAYER.

1112
01:26:03,908 --> 01:26:05,367
THANKS
FOR CHEERING ME ON.

1113
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:07,077
YOU'RE WELCOME.

1114
01:26:08,371 --> 01:26:10,289
YOU PLAYED
REALLY WELL TODAY.

1115
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:15,127
- NO, I DIDN'T.
- YOU DID.

1116
01:26:15,253 --> 01:26:17,629
YOU REALLY IMPROVED
YOURSELF LATELY.

1117
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:23,260
(Joe's voice)
I WAS PROUD TO INTRODUCE P

1118
01:26:23,386 --> 01:26:25,470
TO MY FATHER'S PASSION...

1119
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:27,222
AND TO HIS WORLD.

1120
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:33,437
IT'S ACTUALLY...

1121
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:36,940
THE SOULS OF THE TREES

1122
01:26:37,066 --> 01:26:38,901
THAT WE SEE
IN THE WINTER.

1123
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:47,910
I THINK THEY LOOK
LIKE HUMAN SOULS.

1124
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:53,999
YOU'RE RIGHT.

1125
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:57,044
THEY DO LOOK LIKE
HUMAN SOULS.

1126
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:00,047
TWISTED SOULS,

1127
01:27:00,173 --> 01:27:02,299
REGULAR SOULS,
CRAZY SOULS.

1128
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:06,678
ALL DEPENDING ON THE KIND
OF LIVES HUMAN BEINGS LEAD.

1129
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:13,477
I FOUND MY TREE,

1130
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:15,646
MY SOUL TREE.

1131
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:20,275
THIS IS MY TREE.

1132
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:26,073
(Young Joe)
IT'S NOT AN ASH TREE.

1133
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:27,908
(Father)
NO, IT'S AN OAK TREE.

1134
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:36,124
(chuckles)

1135
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:41,380
MY FATHER FOUND
HIS SOUL TREE,

1136
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:43,840
BUT I'VE...
I'VE NEVER FOUND MINE.

1137
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,344
"YOU WILL KNOW IT
WHEN YOU SEE IT,"

1138
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:49,596
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

1139
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,479
(Joe's voice) WHEN P REACHED
THE AGE OF MAJORITY

1140
01:27:57,605 --> 01:28:00,107
AND I BECAME
HER PERSONAL ADVISOR,

1141
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:02,651
I ASKED HER
TO MOVE IN WITH ME.

1142
01:28:09,575 --> 01:28:11,285
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
WITH YOUR HAIR UP.

1143
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:14,329
IT'S SO PRETTY.

1144
01:28:24,632 --> 01:28:26,800
(breathing heavily)

1145
01:28:26,926 --> 01:28:30,137
(Joe's voice) ALL THIS TIME ALL MY
SEXUAL ACTIVITY HAD STOPPED.

1146
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:33,598
MY GROIN WAS ONE BIG SORE
FROM MY ABUSE

1147
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:35,392
THAT WOULDN'T HEAL

1148
01:28:35,518 --> 01:28:37,894
AND MADE
EVEN MASTURBATION IMPOSSIBLE.

1149
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:45,402
I EXPERIENCED DEFINITE
ABSTINENCE SYMPTOMS:

1150
01:28:45,528 --> 01:28:47,529
FEVER AND CRAMPS.

1151
01:28:48,531 --> 01:28:50,032
(moans)

1152
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:55,704
(glass shatters)

1153
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:57,748
(breathing heavily)

1154
01:29:02,211 --> 01:29:03,587
JOE, WHAT'S GOING ON?

1155
01:29:06,215 --> 01:29:08,842
- (Joe) CAREFUL.
- WE NEED TO CLEAR THIS UP.

1156
01:29:18,519 --> 01:29:20,437
(whispers)
I JUST GET THIS SOMETIMES.

1157
01:29:24,233 --> 01:29:25,692
IT'S OKAY,
IT'S OKAY.

1158
01:29:27,236 --> 01:29:29,154
(Seligman)
PERHAPS SHE REALLY LOVED YOU.

1159
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:32,824
I COULDN'T ACCEPT IT.

1160
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:36,119
PERHAPS BECAUSE YOU REALLY
WANTED IT TO BE TRUE.

1161
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:40,540
PERHAPS I HOPED IT.

1162
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:43,126
IT'S VERY TOUCHING,
ALL THIS ABOUT P.

1163
01:29:45,963 --> 01:29:48,006
THEN YOU'VE PROBABLY
MISUNDERSTOOD

1164
01:29:48,132 --> 01:29:49,549
THE WHOLE THING.

1165
01:29:49,675 --> 01:29:50,842
(pills rattle)

1166
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:19,204
DON'T.

1167
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:22,040
I WANNA SEE YOU.

1168
01:30:22,166 --> 01:30:23,917
- DON'T.
- WHY?

1169
01:30:24,043 --> 01:30:25,627
- PLEASE DON'T.
- WHY NOT?

1170
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:28,713
NO.
NO, I HAVE A WOUND.

1171
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,133
- I HAVE A WOUND.
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

1172
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:32,968
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1173
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:35,595
I HAVE THAT THING
WITH MY EAR.

1174
01:30:35,721 --> 01:30:37,556
I'M SO ASHAMED.

1175
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:17,220
D'YOU LIKE ME?

1176
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:22,893
YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

1177
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:24,579
(sobbing)

1178
01:32:41,138 --> 01:32:43,265
(train passing)

1179
01:32:53,776 --> 01:32:55,777
THERE'S ONE THING
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1180
01:32:57,572 --> 01:32:59,739
DID SHE KNOW WHAT
YOU DID FOR A LIVING?

1181
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:02,784
P WAS VERY DISCREET

1182
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:05,161
AND A GIRL OF FEW WORDS.

1183
01:33:06,622 --> 01:33:09,291
ODDLY, ALTHOUGH
I WORKED STRANGE HOURS,

1184
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:11,668
SHE NEVER ASKED
ABOUT MY WORK.

1185
01:33:13,546 --> 01:33:15,297
BUT ONE DAY
SHE HAD A QUESTION.

1186
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:19,301
JOE?

1187
01:33:24,307 --> 01:33:27,392
WHY DID YOU START COMING
TO MY BASKETBALL MATCHES?

1188
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:32,147
IT WASN'T A COINCIDENCE,
WAS IT?

1189
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:40,697
NO, IT WASN'T
A COINCIDENCE.

1190
01:33:45,077 --> 01:33:47,329
I DIDN'T TELL YOU
BECAUSE I...

1191
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:50,915
I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE UPSET...

1192
01:33:52,418 --> 01:33:54,628
AND THAT YOU'D
GET ANGRY AT ME.

1193
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:57,505
I WON'T GET ANGRY.

1194
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:04,304
WHAT I DO...

1195
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:08,516
MY JOB
ISN'T A NORMAL JOB.

1196
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:10,769
IT'S NOT LEGAL.

1197
01:34:10,895 --> 01:34:13,647
NO ONE IN MY FAMILY
DOES ANYTHING LEGAL.

1198
01:34:19,779 --> 01:34:21,905
A MAN THAT'S HELPED ME
IN MY BUSINESS

1199
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:24,032
SUGGESTED THAT
I WATCHED YOU.

1200
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:28,870
THE PLAN WAS THAT I...

1201
01:34:28,996 --> 01:34:31,498
I SHOULD LOOK AT YOU

1202
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:33,917
TO SEE WHETHER ONE DAY

1203
01:34:34,043 --> 01:34:35,585
I COULD USE YOU
IN MY WORK.

1204
01:34:36,629 --> 01:34:38,630
I SHOULD
MAKE FRIENDS WITH YOU,

1205
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:42,217
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU DIDN'T
HAVE A MOTHER OR A FATHER.

1206
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:43,843
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THAT?

1207
01:34:45,137 --> 01:34:47,722
DON'T YOU SEE
HOW EVIL THAT PLAN WAS?

1208
01:34:47,848 --> 01:34:50,141
I FELT TERRIBLE.

1209
01:34:50,267 --> 01:34:52,143
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

1210
01:34:52,269 --> 01:34:54,020
WHY NOT?

1211
01:34:56,774 --> 01:34:59,109
BECAUSE IF YOU HADN'T...

1212
01:35:01,112 --> 01:35:02,779
WE'D NEVER HAVE MET.

1213
01:35:08,661 --> 01:35:11,204
I'D LIKE TO GO
WITH YOU TO WORK

1214
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:13,498
- NEXT TIME.
- NO.

1215
01:35:22,633 --> 01:35:24,676
WILL YOU THINK ABOUT IT?

1216
01:35:24,802 --> 01:35:26,636
- NO.
- YES.

1217
01:35:26,762 --> 01:35:27,846
(laughs) NO.

1218
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:30,598
SHE DIDN'T TAKE NO
FOR AN ANSWER.

1219
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:32,642
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

1220
01:35:32,768 --> 01:35:36,229
HOW DO YOU KEEP A WAVE
UPON THE SAND?

1221
01:35:39,358 --> 01:35:42,193
WITH THE RISK OF BEING
TOO CLEVER FOR MYSELF,

1222
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:44,696
SOCIAL INHERITANCE

1223
01:35:44,822 --> 01:35:47,198
IS AN IRREFUTABLE FACT.

1224
01:35:47,324 --> 01:35:50,493
IF ANYONE KNEW ABOUT
THE LAWS OF THE STREET,

1225
01:35:50,619 --> 01:35:52,162
IT MUST'VE BEEN P.

1226
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:56,666
YOU'RE MORE RIGHT
THAN YOU KNOW.

1227
01:35:58,753 --> 01:36:00,962
- (man yelling)
- LET'S SHOOT THE FUCKER.

1228
01:36:02,131 --> 01:36:04,007
STOP! STOP!

1229
01:36:08,637 --> 01:36:10,388
WE DON'T USE FIREARMS.

1230
01:36:12,308 --> 01:36:16,019
- I'D LIKE TO HAVE THE GUN.
- THE OTHERS HAVE WEAPONS TOO.

1231
01:36:17,062 --> 01:36:18,897
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

1232
01:36:19,023 --> 01:36:21,065
BUT IN ANY CASE,
YOU'RE NOT TO HAVE ONE.

1233
01:36:21,192 --> 01:36:23,485
BUT GUNS AREN'T DANGEROUS.

1234
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:26,237
IT DEPENDS ON HOW
YOU USE THEM.

1235
01:36:26,363 --> 01:36:27,864
YES, EXACTLY.

1236
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:29,949
I WASN'T GOING TO SHOOT HIM.

1237
01:36:30,075 --> 01:36:33,161
WE WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN ANY
MONEY OUT OF HIM THAT WAY.

1238
01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:35,246
CAN I HAVE THE GUN?

1239
01:36:39,084 --> 01:36:40,919
THANK YOU.

1240
01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:02,398
YOU'RE EVIL.

1241
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:10,824
(Joe's voice) AND NOW I'M AFRAID
ONE OF THOSE COINCIDENCES

1242
01:37:10,950 --> 01:37:12,450
YOU HAVE SUCH
A HARD TIME WITH

1243
01:37:12,576 --> 01:37:15,203
OCCURRED
WITH A VERY SPECIAL PERSON.

1244
01:37:17,164 --> 01:37:19,874
IT WAS P's JOB TO TAKE US
TO THE DEBTORS,

1245
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,085
SO UNTIL I SAW
THE NAME ON THE DOOR,

1246
01:37:22,211 --> 01:37:24,796
I HAD NO IDEA
WHOSE HOUSE WE WERE AT.

1247
01:37:29,009 --> 01:37:32,470
- SURE THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE?
- YEAH.

1248
01:37:39,311 --> 01:37:41,396
I WAS THINKING
MAYBE IT'S TIME

1249
01:37:41,522 --> 01:37:44,899
FOR YOU TO DO
THIS ONE ON YOUR OWN.

1250
01:37:45,025 --> 01:37:46,609
YEAH?

1251
01:37:48,737 --> 01:37:49,821
THANK YOU, JOE.

1252
01:37:49,947 --> 01:37:52,073
I DON'T WANT
ANYTHING DESTROYED

1253
01:37:52,199 --> 01:37:54,325
AND I DON'T WANT
ANYBODY HURT.

1254
01:37:54,451 --> 01:37:57,287
OKAY?
YOU JUST SHOW YOURSELF

1255
01:37:57,413 --> 01:38:00,206
AND OFFER HIM
A REASONABLE PAYMENT PLAN.

1256
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:03,126
IF YOU SAY SO.

1257
01:38:03,252 --> 01:38:04,836
OF COURSE THAT'S HOW
I'LL DO IT.

1258
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:14,929
(doorbell rings)

1259
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:21,686
(Joe's voice)
WHETHER THE FEELING

1260
01:38:21,812 --> 01:38:25,315
WHEN I SAW JEROME AGAIN
WAS LOVE, I COULDN'T SAY.

1261
01:38:27,693 --> 01:38:29,611
BUT IT WAS A FEELING,

1262
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:32,447
AND FAR STRONGER
THAN I LIKED.

1263
01:38:44,543 --> 01:38:47,211
I WAS ACTUALLY WALKING HOME
THROUGH THE ALLEY HERE.

1264
01:38:48,839 --> 01:38:51,299
NO TWO NEIGHBOURHOODS
ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT

1265
01:38:51,425 --> 01:38:53,426
BUT STILL SO CLOSE TOGETHER

1266
01:38:53,552 --> 01:38:55,762
THAT THE SHORTEST ROUTE
FROM JEROME'S HOUSE

1267
01:38:55,888 --> 01:38:58,598
TOWARDS THE CENTRE
WAS THROUGH THE ALLEY.

1268
01:39:01,185 --> 01:39:03,061
(rustling)

1269
01:39:03,187 --> 01:39:05,730
(door closes)

1270
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:07,815
HELLO!

1271
01:39:07,942 --> 01:39:09,817
HOW DID IT GO?

1272
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:11,945
BRILLIANT.

1273
01:39:12,071 --> 01:39:13,738
YEAH, REALLY WELL.

1274
01:39:15,366 --> 01:39:17,992
I MADE A REASONABLE PAYMENT
PLAN LIKE YOU TOLD ME TO.

1275
01:39:18,118 --> 01:39:19,661
HOW DID HE LOOK?

1276
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:22,914
SCARED.

1277
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:25,583
HOW OLD DID HE LOOK?

1278
01:39:25,709 --> 01:39:27,502
- (unzipping)
- I DUNNO.

1279
01:39:27,628 --> 01:39:29,003
ANCIENT?

1280
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:44,936
(laughs)

1281
01:39:48,565 --> 01:39:50,858
(Joe's voice) JEROME WAS
TO PAY OFF HIS DEBT

1282
01:39:50,985 --> 01:39:52,735
IN SIX PAYMENTS.

1283
01:39:52,861 --> 01:39:55,613
EVERY TIME P WENT
TO JEROME TO COLLECT,

1284
01:39:55,739 --> 01:39:57,782
I PACED AROUND RESTLESSLY

1285
01:39:57,908 --> 01:40:00,034
UNTIL SHE WAS
BACK HOME AGAIN.

1286
01:40:02,371 --> 01:40:05,957
I EVEN HAD TO FIND MY MOTHER'S
SAD OLD SOLITAIRE CARDS

1287
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:08,793
IN ORDER TO MAKE
THE HOURS PASS.

1288
01:40:16,510 --> 01:40:19,345
EACH NIGHT I WAS LESS
REASSURED BY HER COMING HOME

1289
01:40:19,471 --> 01:40:21,139
THAN THE NIGHT BEFORE.

1290
01:40:21,265 --> 01:40:25,435
THE QUESTION OF WHETHER
JEALOUSY IS THE FEAR OF SHARING

1291
01:40:25,561 --> 01:40:28,938
OR THE FEAR OF LOSING
WAS OF LITTLE INTEREST TO ME.

1292
01:40:29,064 --> 01:40:31,983
BUT YES, IT WAS A FACT
THAT THIS UNWORTHY FEELING

1293
01:40:32,109 --> 01:40:34,527
I HAD MANAGED TO SUPPRESS
FOR SO LONG

1294
01:40:34,653 --> 01:40:36,487
WAS CREEPING UP ON ME.

1295
01:40:39,491 --> 01:40:42,035
THE EVENING SHE WAS
TO COLLECT THE FINAL PAYMENT

1296
01:40:42,161 --> 01:40:43,911
SHE DIDN'T KISS ME.

1297
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:46,372
I TOOK IT
TO BE FORGETFULNESS,

1298
01:40:46,498 --> 01:40:49,959
BUT THE HOURS PASSED
AND SHE DIDN'T RETURN.

1299
01:40:57,885 --> 01:40:59,969
EVERY TIME
I SAW CAR LIGHTS,

1300
01:41:00,095 --> 01:41:02,555
I THOUGHT IT WAS P
BEING DRIVEN HOME.

1301
01:41:10,564 --> 01:41:12,565
(crickets chirping)

1302
01:41:22,117 --> 01:41:24,285
(soft snoring)

1303
01:42:05,035 --> 01:42:07,620
(Joe's voice)
I HAD DECIDED TO FLEE.

1304
01:42:07,746 --> 01:42:11,165
I COULDN'T STAY IN THIS TOWN
WITH HER AND HIM.

1305
01:42:13,001 --> 01:42:16,087
I HAD COWARDLY MADE A PLAN
TO ESCAPE AND HEAD SOUTH,

1306
01:42:16,213 --> 01:42:19,507
LIKE FROM SOME ICE AGE
I DIDN'T HAVE THE GUTS

1307
01:42:19,633 --> 01:42:22,093
TO TURN AROUND AND FACE.

1308
01:42:22,219 --> 01:42:26,472
BUT THE GOODBYE WAS SAD
AND STRANGELY UNFULFILLING.

1309
01:42:26,598 --> 01:42:28,724
AND SOMETHING CALLED ME ON

1310
01:42:28,851 --> 01:42:31,018
TO SEEK FURTHER UP
THE MOUNTAIN.

1311
01:43:45,469 --> 01:43:48,512
IT'S SAID TO BE DIFFICULT
TO TAKE SOMEONE'S LIFE.

1312
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:52,558
I WOULD'VE SAID THAT
IT'S MORE DIFFICULT NOT TO.

1313
01:43:54,102 --> 01:43:55,561
FOR A HUMAN BEING,

1314
01:43:55,687 --> 01:43:58,147
KILLING IS THE MOST
NATURAL THING IN THE WORLD.

1315
01:43:59,358 --> 01:44:01,609
WE'RE CREATED FOR IT.

1316
01:44:03,654 --> 01:44:05,613
WONDERFUL.

1317
01:44:37,354 --> 01:44:39,146
(Jerome laughs)

1318
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:53,786
(groaning)

1319
01:44:56,415 --> 01:44:57,540
(Jerome) NO, GET OFF!

1320
01:44:57,666 --> 01:45:00,334
- (P yelps)
- (laughs) SORRY.

1321
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:02,253
- (Jerome sighs)
- (laughs)

1322
01:45:07,509 --> 01:45:09,593
FIREMAN'S GRIP.

1323
01:45:10,846 --> 01:45:13,306
(both grunt)

1324
01:45:17,185 --> 01:45:19,270
- (P moans)
- (mutters)

1325
01:46:23,168 --> 01:46:25,169
(ragged breathing)

1326
01:46:52,864 --> 01:46:55,241
- (blows thudding)
- (Joe whimpers)

1327
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:30,109
- (moans)
- (panting)

1328
01:47:30,235 --> 01:47:32,862
OH. OH YEAH.

1329
01:47:46,835 --> 01:47:48,210
(whispering)

1330
01:47:52,966 --> 01:47:54,758
(spits)

1331
01:47:54,885 --> 01:47:57,011
(both groaning)

1332
01:49:01,409 --> 01:49:04,578
FILL ALL MY HOLES PLEASE.

1333
01:49:25,892 --> 01:49:28,602
I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY
THE GUN DIDN'T WORK.

1334
01:49:28,728 --> 01:49:30,271
I DID CHECK TO MAKE SURE

1335
01:49:30,397 --> 01:49:32,356
THAT THERE WERE BULLETS
IN THE MAGAZINE.

1336
01:49:33,567 --> 01:49:35,651
IT SIMPLY MALFUNCTIONED,

1337
01:49:35,777 --> 01:49:38,904
JUST LIKE BOND'S BERETTA.

1338
01:49:39,030 --> 01:49:40,948
I THINK I KNOW ENOUGH
TO SAY THAT

1339
01:49:41,074 --> 01:49:44,243
EVEN IF YOU HAD ROUNDS IN THE
MAGAZINE OF THE WALTHER P.P.K.,

1340
01:49:44,369 --> 01:49:46,579
AND YOU'D TAKEN OFF
THE SAFETY...

1341
01:49:47,998 --> 01:49:50,833
YOU CANNOT SHOOT
UNTIL YOU RACK THE GUN.

1342
01:49:50,959 --> 01:49:55,087
YOU PULL AND RELEASE
THE SLIDING MECHANISM.

1343
01:49:56,715 --> 01:49:58,966
AND P HADN'T DONE IT
BECAUSE, AS SHE SAID,

1344
01:49:59,092 --> 01:50:01,594
SHE HAD NO INTENTION
OF SHOOTING THE MAN.

1345
01:50:03,763 --> 01:50:06,557
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT BOND, BUT
I ASSUME IT HAS TO BE APPARENT

1346
01:50:06,683 --> 01:50:08,892
FROM HIS BOOKS
AND HIS FILMS THAT

1347
01:50:09,019 --> 01:50:11,937
YOU HAVE TO RACK
AN AUTOMATIC PISTOL.

1348
01:50:13,106 --> 01:50:15,357
OF COURSE, YOU'RE RIGHT.

1349
01:50:16,901 --> 01:50:19,820
I'VE SEEN IT IN FILMS
A THOUSAND TIMES.

1350
01:50:25,243 --> 01:50:26,452
IT'S MORNING.

1351
01:50:29,331 --> 01:50:30,831
AND THE SNOW IS GONE.

1352
01:50:30,957 --> 01:50:33,042
SO THE SUN MUST BE OUT?

1353
01:50:33,168 --> 01:50:35,461
YES, THERE IS SUN.

1354
01:50:41,468 --> 01:50:44,094
I'VE NEVER MANAGED TO FIGURE
OUT WHERE IT COMES FROM.

1355
01:50:45,722 --> 01:50:47,723
IT MUST BE SOME INTERPLAY

1356
01:50:47,849 --> 01:50:50,476
BETWEEN WINDOWS

1357
01:50:50,602 --> 01:50:53,520
AND TOWERS
AND HIGH BUILDINGS.

1358
01:50:57,025 --> 01:50:58,609
IT'S NOT MUCH,

1359
01:50:58,735 --> 01:51:01,695
BUT IT'S THE SUN YOU GET
HERE AT MY PLACE.

1360
01:51:06,284 --> 01:51:07,660
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1361
01:51:18,463 --> 01:51:20,714
(Seligman's voice)
IN THE BEGINNING YOU SAID THAT

1362
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:24,009
YOUR ONLY SIN WAS THAT
YOU ASKED MORE OF THE SUNSET.

1363
01:51:25,970 --> 01:51:27,805
MEANING, I SUPPOSE,
THAT YOU WANTED

1364
01:51:27,931 --> 01:51:29,973
MORE FROM LIFE
THAN WAS GOOD FOR YOU.

1365
01:51:33,228 --> 01:51:35,979
YOU WERE A HUMAN BEING
DEMANDING YOUR RIGHT.

1366
01:51:36,106 --> 01:51:38,649
AND MORE THAN THAT,

1367
01:51:38,775 --> 01:51:41,860
YOU WERE A WOMAN
DEMANDING HER RIGHT.

1368
01:51:44,989 --> 01:51:47,282
DOES THAT PARDON
EVERYTHING?

1369
01:51:49,119 --> 01:51:50,619
DO YOU THINK
IF TWO MEN

1370
01:51:50,745 --> 01:51:53,038
WOULD'VE WALKED DOWN A TRAIN
LOOKING FOR WOMEN,

1371
01:51:53,164 --> 01:51:56,333
DO YOU THINK ANYBODY WOULD
HAVE RAISED AN EYEBROW?

1372
01:51:57,711 --> 01:52:00,587
OR IF A MAN HAD LED
THE LIFE YOU HAD?

1373
01:52:02,257 --> 01:52:04,842
AND THE STORY ABOUT MRS. H

1374
01:52:04,968 --> 01:52:08,387
WOULD'VE BEEN EXTREMELY
BANAL IF YOU'D BEEN A MAN

1375
01:52:08,513 --> 01:52:11,306
AND YOUR CONQUEST WOULD
HAVE BEEN A WOMAN.

1376
01:52:12,809 --> 01:52:15,269
WHEN A MAN LEAVES
HIS CHILDREN

1377
01:52:15,395 --> 01:52:17,855
BECAUSE OF DESIRE,

1378
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:20,607
WE ACCEPT IT WITH A SHRUG,
BUT YOU AS A WOMAN,

1379
01:52:20,734 --> 01:52:24,778
YOU HAD TO TAKE ON A...
A GUILT, A BURDEN OF GUILT

1380
01:52:24,904 --> 01:52:26,864
THAT COULD NEVER
BE ALLEVIATED.

1381
01:52:30,577 --> 01:52:34,455
AND ALL IN ALL,
ALL THE BLAME AND GUILT

1382
01:52:34,581 --> 01:52:37,166
THAT PILED UP OVER THE YEARS
BECAME TOO MUCH FOR YOU,

1383
01:52:37,292 --> 01:52:38,792
YOU REACTED AGGRESSIVELY...

1384
01:52:38,918 --> 01:52:40,961
ALMOST LIKE A MAN
I HAVE TO SAY...

1385
01:52:41,087 --> 01:52:42,504
AND YOU FOUGHT BACK.

1386
01:52:43,715 --> 01:52:46,008
YOU FOUGHT BACK AGAINST
THE GENDER THAT HAD BEEN

1387
01:52:46,134 --> 01:52:48,010
OPPRESSING
AND MUTILATING

1388
01:52:48,136 --> 01:52:50,721
AND KILLING YOU
AND BILLIONS OF WOMEN.

1389
01:52:52,891 --> 01:52:55,726
BUT I WANTED TO KILL
A HUMAN BEING.

1390
01:52:59,105 --> 01:53:01,190
(Seligman's voice)
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

1391
01:53:03,151 --> 01:53:05,235
(Joe)
BECAUSE OF A CHANCE EVENT.

1392
01:53:05,361 --> 01:53:08,113
YOU CALL IT
A CHANCE EVENT.

1393
01:53:09,282 --> 01:53:12,159
I CALL IT
SUBCONSCIOUS RESISTANCE.

1394
01:53:12,285 --> 01:53:14,953
ON THE SURFACE
YOU WANTED TO KILL,

1395
01:53:15,079 --> 01:53:18,123
BUT DEEP DOWN YOU
CELEBRATED HUMAN WORTH

1396
01:53:18,249 --> 01:53:22,044
AND A VEIL OF FORGETFULNESS
DRAPED ITSELF

1397
01:53:22,170 --> 01:53:25,881
OVER YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF
HOW TO RACK A GUN.

1398
01:53:26,007 --> 01:53:27,174
(snorts)

1399
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:29,259
ALTHOUGH ALL THIS SOUNDS

1400
01:53:29,385 --> 01:53:31,845
FRIGHTENINGLY CLOSE
TO THE CLICHÉS OF OUR TIMES...

1401
01:53:31,971 --> 01:53:33,180
(chuckles)

1402
01:53:33,306 --> 01:53:35,307
...AND I'M PREDISPOSED

1403
01:53:35,433 --> 01:53:38,185
TO KNOCK HOLES
IN YOUR ARGUMENTS...

1404
01:53:40,313 --> 01:53:42,356
I'M TOO TIRED.

1405
01:53:42,482 --> 01:53:44,024
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

1406
01:53:47,362 --> 01:53:49,696
WHY DON'T YOU LAY DOWN?

1407
01:53:51,908 --> 01:53:53,200
YES.

1408
01:54:05,046 --> 01:54:07,548
LET ME JUST SAY
THAT TELLING MY STORY

1409
01:54:07,674 --> 01:54:09,842
AS YOU INSISTED...

1410
01:54:09,968 --> 01:54:12,302
OR PERMITTED...

1411
01:54:12,428 --> 01:54:14,972
HAS PUT ME AT EASE.

1412
01:54:16,891 --> 01:54:19,184
AT THIS MOMENT

1413
01:54:19,310 --> 01:54:22,896
MY ADDICTION IS
VERY CLEAR TO ME...

1414
01:54:25,358 --> 01:54:27,651
AND I'VE COME
TO A DECISION.

1415
01:54:29,779 --> 01:54:33,490
EVEN THOUGH
ONLY ONE IN A MILLION,

1416
01:54:33,616 --> 01:54:36,827
AS MY DUBIOUS
THERAPIST SAID,

1417
01:54:36,953 --> 01:54:38,871
SUCCEED IN...

1418
01:54:40,373 --> 01:54:43,500
MENTALLY, BODILY...

1419
01:54:44,836 --> 01:54:47,254
AND IN HER HEART

1420
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:51,383
OF RIDDING HERSELF
OF HER SEXUALITY,

1421
01:54:51,509 --> 01:54:54,177
THIS IS NOW MY GOAL.

1422
01:54:55,638 --> 01:54:58,181
BUT IS THAT A LIFE
WORTH LIVING?

1423
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:03,770
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I CAN LIVE IT.

1424
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:11,820
I WILL STAND UP
AGAINST ALL ODDS...

1425
01:55:16,326 --> 01:55:19,870
JUST LIKE A DEFORMED TREE
ON A HILL.

1426
01:55:27,712 --> 01:55:30,172
I WILL MUSTER

1427
01:55:30,298 --> 01:55:32,674
ALL MY STUBBORNNESS...

1428
01:55:35,845 --> 01:55:37,679
MY STRENGTH...

1429
01:55:40,350 --> 01:55:42,726
MY MASCULINE AGGRESSION.

1430
01:55:45,104 --> 01:55:49,232
BUT MOST OF ALL
I WANT TO SAY THANKS

1431
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:52,903
TO MY NEW,
AND MAYBE FIRST FRIEND.

1432
01:55:54,364 --> 01:55:56,448
THANK YOU, SELIGMAN...

1433
01:55:58,284 --> 01:56:02,412
WHO PERHAPS IS HAPPY
WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE.

1434
01:56:08,628 --> 01:56:11,254
I'M HAPPY AT ANY RATE

1435
01:56:11,381 --> 01:56:14,257
THAT THE SHOT DIDN'T GO OFF

1436
01:56:14,384 --> 01:56:16,593
AND MADE ME A MURDERER.

1437
01:56:22,266 --> 01:56:25,727
IF I MAY,
I'D LIKE TO SLEEP NOW.

1438
01:56:29,607 --> 01:56:31,942
I'LL MAKE SURE
YOU WON'T BE DISTURBED.

GOOD NIGHT, JOE.

1441
