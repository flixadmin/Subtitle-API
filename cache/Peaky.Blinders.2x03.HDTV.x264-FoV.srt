1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,310
The Italian gangs and the Jewish
gangs have been at war in London.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,830
The Jews have been having
the worst of it. They need allies.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,910
Tell us your plan.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,390
I can offer you 100 good men.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,190
GRUNTING

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,190
Get him out of there, get him back!

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,120
Arthur killed a boy.

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,790
Polly, these are the files
for Michael and Anna Gray.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,110
Your daughter is dead. But Pol...

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,950
Michael is alive.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,990
I'm looking for someone called
Elizabeth Gray.

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,710
What do you want with
Elizabeth Gray?

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,480
I think she might be my mother.

14
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,750
An old friend of ours
is coming back to the city.

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,910
He's head of some secret
department...

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,080
the Irish desk.

He was murdered this morning
in a street show in the Patch.

31
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,150
He was Irish.

32
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,510
Is he a person of interest
to your department, sir?

33
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,110
Do you read the papers?

34
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,310
Birmingham papers.

35
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,520
I recommend the Daily Mail.
It will broaden your mind.

36
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,150
Now, if you read the national press,

37
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,630
you would know that the King has
offered the rebel Irish a treaty.

38
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,110
Some of the Fenians
want to accept it. The IRA do not.

39
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,230
Now, the IRA have
a long and glorious relationship...

40
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,430
with the garrotte.

41
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,230
Oh, dear.

42
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,320
Are they fighting amongst
themselves, are they, sir?

43
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,950
~ That will be all.
~ Right, sir.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,230
I'm going to be up and down
from London quite a bit.

45
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,870
I'm going to need some lodgings.
Can you help me with that?

46
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,150
Well, you wouldn't want to stay
at the lodgings you had last time
though, sir, eh?

47
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,910
Too many bad memories, I suppose.

48
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,630
You should understand, Moss,

49
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,230
I have no regrets about
my previous mission in this city.

50
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,000
No, sir?

51
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,990
I imagine you boys have quite
a laugh at my expense.

52
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,550
A laugh, sir?

53
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,710
You think it's funny that
I developed feelings.

54
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,710
No idea what you're talking about,
sir.

55
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,510
I have no regrets about what
happened with Miss Burgess.

56
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,790
No "bad memories".

57
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,720
Right, sir.

58
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,840
He's losing his bloody mind.

59
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,160
Next.

60
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,600
Next.

61
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,030
All right then. Name?

62
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,790
The Digbeth Kid.

63
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,110
The Dig...

64
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,960
What are you? A boxer?

65
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,840
Digbeth Kid, like Billy the Kid.

66
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,910
Spend a lot of time at the pictures,
eh?

67
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,430
Cowboy pictures? Tom Mix?

68
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,960
Yeah?

69
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,190
What are you...?!

70
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,910
Wait, wait. It's not a real gun.

71
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,520
~ Let's have a look then, eh?
~ It's made of wood.

72
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,110
Bang. Bang.

73
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,360
Very nice.
Where did you get the gun belt?

74
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,590
My sister made it out of
an old blacksmith's apron.

75
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,790
My mum did most of the stitching.

76
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,590
She's not my real mum but...

77
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,870
She does what mothers do.

78
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,710
So she made you a gun belt.

79
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,150
All right there, mother's boy.

80
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,720
There's the door, on you go.
We're looking for...

81
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,910
Have you ever been arrested?

82
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,640
~ Yeah.
~ Yeah?

83
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,430
~ No.
~ Good.

84
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,270
You're the first bloke we've had in
here today with no criminal record.

85
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,830
Arthur, we can stand him up.

86
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,480
Do you know what that means?

87
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,790
The new Home Secretary
wants something done

88
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,430
about illegal gambling.

89
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,470
~ Damn right.
~ About bloody time.

90
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,110
So we help our coppers make
their quota of convictions

91
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,350
by having men stood up
to be arrested.

92
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,150
First offence,
you'll get a week inside.

93
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,910
We'll give you five quid
for your trouble.

94
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,110
How does that sound, cowboy?

95
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,440
Yeah.

96
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,840
Good. Write your address down
for Finn on your way out.

97
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,710
I can't write.

98
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,270
That's all right, Finn can't read.

99
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,350
Don't worry.

100
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,110
Just tell him your address
and we'll send someone round.

101
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,230
If the Sheriff don't run you
out of town first.

102
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,120
HE CHUCKLES

103
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,320
Good man.

104
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,400
Oh, I don't know, Tom.
Kids these days.

105
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,390
They didn't fight.
So they're different.

106
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,640
They stay kids.

107
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,950
How was it?

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,030
I was starving
so I would have eaten anything.

109
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,160
But, really, it was super.

110
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,600
Super.

111
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,990
So, er, are you a cook?

112
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,320
Not a cook, no.

113
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,310
The man who came to the house,

114
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,190
he was driving a posh car,
he looks rich.

115
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,830
What does he do?

116
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,360
~ He works with horses.
~ Really?!

117
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,550
~ I love horses. I've got a bay mare.
~ No!

118
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,360
I ride it all the time.

119
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,400
Then it's in the blood.

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,430
I've got about a million questions.

121
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,390
So do I.

122
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,950
I've had different pictures
in my head.

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,640
Well, here I am.

124
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,150
It's all right that it's me,
isn't it?

125
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,400
I don't have any choice.

126
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,990
I mean, you are who you are,
aren't you?

127
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,070
We don't choose.

128
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,600
And that's it.

129
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,080
Yeah, that's right.

130
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,600
God gave you to me.

131
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,960
People took you away.

132
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,030
And it is all right that it's me?
Isn't it?

133
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,000
In a place like this.

134
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,440
I thought it would be worse.

135
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,670
'Run for the hills!

136
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,430
~ 'It's the Digbeth Kid!'
~ POUNDING ON DOOR

137
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,990
Get out of town, kid, or I'll
shoot your fucking head off!

138
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,590
Times up!

139
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,560
~ You're dead, go down. ~ John!

140
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,030
THEY CHUCKLE

141
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,310
All right then, Polly.

142
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,270
Who's this?

143
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,910
Gentlemen,

144
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,070
this is your cousin.

145
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,040
Polly's son, Michael.

146
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,830
~ Pleased to meet you.
~ John.

147
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,510
I'm Arthur. You've already met me.

148
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,830
I used to throw you out of the window
so John could catch you.

149
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,910
I used to put you in a shoebox
and kick you down Watery Lane.

150
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,670
I bet you're glad to be back.

151
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,190
I don't remember any of it.

152
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,120
All I remember is
the day they took me away.

153
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,760
Well, you're here now, son.

154
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,830
Welcome to the Shelby family.

155
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,670
~ Later on, we'll show you the ropes.
~ Yeah, we'll show you what's what.

156
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,310
Let's leave him be for now, eh?

157
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,880
Come on, boys.

158
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,200
Nice suit.

159
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,840
They seem nice.

160
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,550
Here he is - Mr Inconspicuous.

161
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,510
Corporal Billy Kitchen.
Bloody grand to see you.

162
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,310
How are you feeling?

163
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,350
I've just come out
of bandages myself.

164
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,430
Ready for active service.
Thanks for seeing me here, Tommy.

165
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,230
It's all right, Bill. You don't
have to stand in line for us.

166
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,350
It's men like you
we're looking for, Billy.

167
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,470
But you have to pass
the medical first.

168
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:59,240
Sheffield mob showed up at Wincanton
trotting track. I took a bullet.

169
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,310
When do the bandages come off?

170
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,750
When I take 'em off.

171
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,750
One week. Not before.

172
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,470
You'll smell no rot.

173
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,990
There's no gangrene.

174
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,240
It's been a long time. Eh, Billy?

175
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,470
What did you do with your medals?

176
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,360
Threw them in the cut. Same as you.

177
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,310
It was never a hardship
having you Black Country boys

178
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,630
on our left flank.

179
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,190
And you Brummies did
all right on our right.

180
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,680
Damn right.

181
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,870
I want you to be
the head of a brigade, Billy.

182
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,110
It'll be Brigadier Kitchen
from now on.

183
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,630
You'll have 100 men
under your command.

184
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,550
And now we've got a member of
the Kitchen family on the payroll,

185
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,270
maybe your cousins and brothers
will let our boats pass through

186
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,070
the Black Country without
being held up and robbed.

187
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,790
I don't know what you're
talking about.

188
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,990
Go home, Bill.

189
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,830
Round up any good men you trust
and put the word out.

190
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,150
Black Country boys and Brummie boys
are on the same side again.

191
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,320
~ That'll be the bloody day.
~ Well, this is the bloody day.

192
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,360
London, man. There for the taking.

193
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,360
Tommy, I need to use the telephone.
Polly said you had one in the pub.

194
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,120
All right, be quick.
I have business.

195
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,150
Sir.

196
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,390
Polly said you own this place.

197
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,790
She said you own lots
of different businesses.

198
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,750
You call her Polly or Mum?

199
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,390
I can't get used to
calling her Mum yet.

200
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,670
TOMMY SIGHS

201
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,190
~ Who are you calling?
~ My mother. I mean...

202
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,760
I know what you mean.

203
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,870
And what are you going to tell her?

204
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,790
I'm going to tell her where I am.

205
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,720
And now you're going to tell her
you're going home.

206
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,630
Polly said I could
stay for a few days.

207
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,680
~ You want to stay?
~ I've only just arrived.

208
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,870
What age are you, Michael?

209
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,270
17.

210
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,590
17. Which means it's not
up to you, right?

211
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,230
I'm 18 in a few weeks.
I make up my own mind.

212
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,230
You smoke?

213
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,640
No.

214
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,240
Drink?

215
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,830
You're going to call your mother

216
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,310
and tell her you're getting
the next train home.

217
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,230
When you get there, you're going
to write a letter to Polly saying

218
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,790
when you're 18 you'll come
back here and sort things out.

219
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,280
I just told you.

220
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,800
I make up my own mind.

221
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,640
Do you know what we do, Michael?

222
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,680
We... Shelbys?

223
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,470
Yes. I think I know what you do.

224
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,750
Yeah.

225
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,120
You've got smart eyes.

226
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,750
But you're young, so you think
what we do is all right.

227
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,830
It's not all right.

228
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,920
People get hurt.

229
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,270
Now call your mother and
I will drive you to the station.

230
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,880
No.

231
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,680
In my village,
there's this little wishing well.

232
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,510
It's made of white bricks,

233
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,880
right in the middle
of the village green.

234
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,560
Everybody says how pretty it is.

235
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:54,030
But I swear to God, if I spend
another day in that village,

236
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,190
I'm going to blow it up
with dynamite.

237
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,830
Probably blow my hands off with it
but it'd be worth it.

238
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,950
Just to see all those

239
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,200
pretty white bricks spread all over
the pretty village green.

240
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,120
Yep. You're Polly's son all right.

241
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,760
MUSIC: Red Right Hand
by Arctic Monkeys

242
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,270
Right boys, let's go to work.

243
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,480
Let's be having it!

244
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,640
Don't wait!

245
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,840
Keep it moving.

246
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,120
Move!

247
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,960
Next lad!

248
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,190
Name?

249
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,510
Abbey Heath.

250
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,390
~ Abbey Heath. Profession?
~ Baker.

251
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,990
Good lad, fill it out and fuck off.

252
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,640
Next lad!

253
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,870
Name?

254
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,270
Buddy Halls.

255
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,270
Buddy Halls. Right, profession?

256
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,470
Baker.

257
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,150
Good lad, fill it out and fuck off.

258
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Next lad!

259
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,630
Name?

260
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,750
Billy Kitchen.

261
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,110
Billy Kitchen. Occupation?

262
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,840
HEAD baker.

263
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,120
Fill it out.

264
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,030
That Tommy Shelby, mate.

265
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,510
Never give power to the big man,
what did I tell you?

266
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,070
Never give power to the big man.

267
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,520
Next lad!

268
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,200
Name?

269
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,030
All right, boys, you've now
all been enrolled as bakers

270
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,870
in the Aerated Bread Company
of Camden Town.

271
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,030
If anyone asks, that's what you do.
You're bakers.

272
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,750
The coppers in Camden Town
are on our side, but north or south,

273
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,110
you show them that piece of paper.

274
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,230
Tell them you've come down
from the north to find work,

275
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,150
to break strikes. Tell them
you're fascists if you have to.

276
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,870
We're finding lodgings for you
but, for now,

277
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,390
you'll sleep here in the bakery.

278
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,720
But don't touch any of the bread,
it'll most likely explode.

279
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,440
Any questions?

280
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,230
Yes?

281
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,230
I haven't seen any bread.

282
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,720
THEY LAUGH

283
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,240
TOMMY CLEARS HIS THROAT

284
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,430
He'll wake up.

285
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,080
Granted he won't have any teeth left
but he will be a wiser man for it.

286
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,320
And the last thing he will remember
is your funny little joke. Won't he?

287
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,160
Right!

288
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,190
There are fucking rules here.

289
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,950
Yeah, there are fucking rules
for a fucking reason.

290
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,360
Quite simply they have to be obeyed.
All right?

291
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,310
Rule number one.

292
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,600
The distinction between bread and rum
is not discussed.

293
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,040
Rule number two.

294
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:38,310
Anything, right, that your
superior officer says to you

295
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,470
or any of your other fucking
superior officers say to you, yeah?

296
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,120
NOT DISCUSSED!

297
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,710
Rule number three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, I don't care.

298
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,830
For the rest of your fucking
miserable, measly lives, yeah?

299
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:05,200
Because I, like you, am also
a complete fucking sodomite.

300
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,320
Jewish women.

301
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,470
You do not go anywhere near them

302
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,240
because Jewish women for you
are off the fucking menu.

303
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,240
I think that's fair.

304
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,430
All right, that's it, yeah.

305
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,360
Forgive me, I interrupted.

306
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,000
Pick him up.

307
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,360
(Get them out of here
and make this fucking work.)

308
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,190
Don't fucking wait! You're meant
to be fucking soldiers!

309
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,470
You're a fucking disgrace!

310
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,640
Go!

311
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,910
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

312
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,120
DOOR OPENS

313
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,790
You've got a key?

314
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,550
I kept a spare.

315
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,040
Give it to me.

316
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,870
Could do with some paint, eh?

317
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,360
Yeah. When I decide.

318
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,550
What is it that you want, Tommy?

319
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,040
Just came by to say hello.

320
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,950
Tommy Shelby never goes anywhere
for no reason.

321
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,960
~ HE SIGHS
~ Fine.

322
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,710
I've got £800 left
in the Shelby property fund

323
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,350
and I need someone down here to
look for suitable properties.

324
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,990
To rent?

325
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,830
Yes.

326
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,350
To poor people. Ten to a room.

327
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,150
No repairs, no water.

328
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,800
And if they complain, you just
send Arthur and the boys round.

329
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,350
I give advice down at the library.

330
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,590
Families thrown onto the street.

331
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,160
It's men like you we're fighting.

332
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,240
Well, anyway, I was just passing,
thanks for the tea.

333
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,320
Tommy.

334
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,230
There are always men outside
watching the house.

335
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,190
Yeah. Gangsters of the worst kind.

336
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,950
But they're there to keep you safe.

337
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,240
No, there are others.
They look like coppers.

338
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,920
They're on your side as well.

339
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,670
~ I don't have a fucking side.
~ Ada...

340
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,160
yes, you do.

341
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,710
And, anyway, if I thought there
was no-one watching the house,

342
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,320
I couldn't sleep.

343
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,560
Cheerio then.

344
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,120
That was great, well done.
Out we get then.

345
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,800
This house is mine.

346
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,190
I've taken on a maid.

347
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,750
She's made up the big room for you.

348
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,240
Come on, let's have a look.

349
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,400
I thought we could
spend the week here.

350
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,920
You know, get to know
each other... again.

351
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,270
I've got ham. Do you like ham?

352
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,440
I like ham, yes.

353
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,400
~ I've got a maid...
~ Yes, you said.

354
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,720
She's upstairs.

355
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,550
She can give us some tea.

356
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,080
Look, I ring this bell. Watch.

357
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,960
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

358
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,800
Yes, madam?

359
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,080
I think we'd like some tea.

360
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,840
You get used to it.

361
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,720
MUSIC: Out Of The Black
by Royal Blood

362
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,790
The cleaning job's gone.
Vacancy's filled.

363
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,470
I'm not a cleaner.

364
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,120
But I have come to clean away
some dirt.

365
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,830
Why don't you put that away
before it goes off?

366
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,670
You killed my son,

367
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,880
you Peaky bastard!

368
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:14,120
You beat him
and beat him and beat him.

369
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,510
Your son was a boxer.

370
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,080
No!

371
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,310
He was a boy...

372
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,480
who got into a ring
with an animal.

373
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,990
Yeah, ain't that the truth.

374
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,200
I've come to stop you...

375
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:40,560
.. because the coppers
and nobody else will.

376
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,230
If you're going to use it,

377
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,360
point that thing at my head.

378
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,800
That's where the trouble is.

379
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,710
Gut-shot soldiers take
half a day to die.

380
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,750
I've seen 'em.

381
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,360
Walking around with their guts
in their arms like dirty washing.

382
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,270
Hold that gun up and do it.

383
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,910
Well, then, do it!

384
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,150
Do it!

385
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,720
SHE PANTS

386
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,800
I'm going to finish my drink.

387
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,480
You can finish it with me
if you like.

388
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,200
Now, look. Look at me.

389
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,070
We've got a fund.

390
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,440
For you, you'll get paid weekly.

391
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,200
I know it won't bring back your son.

392
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,600
I know that.

393
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,240
And you have other sons.

394
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,990
You do.

395
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,950
And we'll find them work.

396
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,870
And you won't have to work.
You'll be...

397
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,600
SHE SCREAMS

398
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,640
Somebody has got to stop you people.

399
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,310
Who broke the fucking mirror?

400
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,160
Seven years bad luck, that is.

401
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,790
There'll be another
four boat-loads tomorrow.

402
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,950
What's up, Charlie?
Business is good.

403
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,150
This isn't business,
this is bloody work.

404
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,790
Cigarettes and booze is all right

405
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,310
but this manufactured stuff,
it's heavy.

406
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,400
I'm not even sure it's stolen.

407
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,870
Some of it is legally purchased.

408
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,150
One day, all of it will be.

409
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,630
It's like having a fucking job.

410
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,680
Easy with them fan belts.

411
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,760
I'll wipe that smile off your face.
I want another pound a boat.

412
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,560
Done.

413
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,960
You don't even fight me anymore.

414
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,070
And it's no sport getting through
the Black Country with this truce.

415
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,350
They just fucking wave at you
from the bank.

416
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,640
Well, just wave back, eh?

417
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,110
And all these fucking cars.

418
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,920
When did you last ride a horse, Tom?

419
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,040
KNOCK AT DOOR

420
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,110
These are just dry, Mr Campbell.

421
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,830
Major Campbell.

422
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,070
Beg pardon?

423
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,080
It doesn't matter.

424
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,350
Are there any other Irishmen
lodging in this house?

425
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,870
No, Mr Campbell,
I keep a respectable house.

426
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,680
With your special exception,
I have no Irish here.

427
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,750
Well, let me know
if any come enquiring after rooms.

428
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,590
Even if you turn them away,
let me know, would you?

429
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,870
You're not expecting trouble, I hope.

430
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:32,150
They only said you was
a policeman of some sort.

431
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,280
No. I'm not expecting any trouble.

432
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:42,790
Is there a cafe nearby that
serves chops? Lamb or pork?

433
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,590
There is a chophouse
two streets away.

434
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:51,390
But I myself serve sandwiches.
Egg and cress or ham.

435
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,560
Or anything that pleases you.

436
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,630
No. No.

437
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,640
I think I'll go out
and get some air.

438
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,430
Our scheduled meeting
is not until Sunday.

439
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,070
I decided to bring it forward.

440
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,430
You just wanted to show me that you
know where I live, isn't that it?

441
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,640
Am I supposed to be impressed?

442
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,270
You know... Mr Churchill
was impressed.

443
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,320
Yes, he was.

444
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,160
All my demands have been met.

445
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,790
Did he tell you?

446
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,270
Yes. Yes.

447
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,870
We had a meeting and your letter
was read aloud.

448
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,310
As a matter of fact, there was quite
a lot of hilarity at the meeting.

449
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,550
The gentlemen all found it
quite funny.

450
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,590
I see,
the gentlemen found it funny.

451
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:59,320
Tell me this, Mr Campbell, do the
gentlemen sometimes find you funny?

452
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,710
We will discuss our business
on Sunday...

453
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,750
on the agreed day,
at the allotted time,

454
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,200
and at the place which has
already been determined.

455
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,670
You have made your point.
Good night, Mr Shelby.

456
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,590
There was another reason
I came to see you tonight.

457
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,510
I just didn't want you to be
made a fool of is all.

458
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:34,230
The lodgings chosen for you
by the police department,

459
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,670
how shall I put this?

460
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,590
Well, the landlady used to run
the most famous whorehouse

461
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,710
in Stetchford.

462
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,030
She's only semi-retired.

463
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,400
I bet the gentlemen
would find that funny, eh?

464
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,400
Told to you in the spirit
of friendship and co-operation.

465
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,830
See you Sunday.

466
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,030
Name?

467
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,270
The Digbeth Kid.

468
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,510
Your real name.

469
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,440
Harold Hancox.

470
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,310
Profession.

471
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,950
Illegal bookmaker.

472
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,550
You don't admit that.

473
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,110
You say something like
"umbrella mender".

474
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,110
And then we decide you're lying
and then we arrest you.

475
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,920
Umbrella mender.

476
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,470
You were found in possession
of betting slips, race cards

477
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,150
and ticker tape.

478
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,800
Any explanation?

479
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,990
No...

480
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:46,550
"No, I have no explanation for my
possession of those items, officer."

481
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:51,350
Take him down, will you?
I'll fill in the rest myself.

482
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,760
Come on, son.

483
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,360
Bloody hellfire.

484
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,670
You've killed him, huh?

485
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,630
As I've explained,
he's not easy to get at.

486
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,350
He's got an army round him.

487
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,920
But when the time is right...

488
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,190
The time is right. It's right now.

489
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,960
When he's away from his familiar
territory, I will take him.

490
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,910
So what do you want?

491
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,950
We heard from a guard
at Winson Green prison that

492
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,910
one of their bookies
has just been put inside.

493
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,590
Kid called Harold Hancox.

494
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,270
We could make a point.

495
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,230
How many bakers is there
in Camden Town now?

496
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,390
There are a lot of bakers
in Camden Town, Mr Sabini,

497
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,350
but, as I have said, we don't as yet
have a definite number.

498
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,510
Who won the 4:15 at Chepstow?

499
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,750
Ragman.

500
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,990
~ Where's my dry cleaning?
~ It's been collected.

501
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,920
Who won the 3:50 at Kempton Park?

502
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,830
What? You don't know?

503
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,390
I can find out.

504
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,680
No need. I know already.

505
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,990
You see, the favourites,
they're all winning.

506
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,320
And the second favourites
are being done.

507
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,270
He's bewitching them.

508
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,350
Bewitching?

509
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,750
Gypsy stuff. Herbs and potions.

510
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,960
And he's tipping off our big punters
so they know who's going to win.

511
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,670
Regular customers betraying us
for profit.

512
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,960
You'd think they'd be loyal to us.
But profit, you see...

513
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,230
.. comes before race, creed
and family.

514
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,750
Results look normal to me.

515
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,310
You see shit!

516
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:02,350
Mr Sabini, if you think they're
planning to fix Northern races,

517
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,990
we'll take no more bets
on anything north of Towcester.

518
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,390
I gave you a job already.

519
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,430
And the job will be done.
But meantime...

520
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,520
Meantime fuck.

521
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,910
Meantime, what do you want us

522
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,520
to do about the kid
in the cage in Birmingham?

523
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,720
CHOKING

524
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,080
Why would you want me
to say that out loud?

525
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,160
Is there somebody listening?

526
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,830
All right, I'll say it.

527
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,440
We'll kill the Hancox kid
to send a message.

528
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:08,360
Good, and then you deal with
Tommy fucking Shelby.

529
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,920
KNOCK ON DOOR

530
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,950
You wanted to see me?

531
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,360
Aye.

532
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,520
Take off your clothes.

533
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:45,790
I know what you are,
so take off your clothes.

534
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,200
COINS JINGLE

535
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,760
Not done in a very
gentlemanly-like way, if I may say.

536
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,560
Indeed not.

537
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,520
So it's true. Stop.

538
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,590
I only wanted proof,
not satisfaction.

539
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,160
Or indeed infection.

540
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,110
Are you in on the joke?

541
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,720
What joke?

542
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,630
I have unfinished business
in this filthy city.

543
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,590
And when the time comes,
I will finish that business.

544
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,040
And then my wrath will
come down on all of yous.

545
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:49,190
But now, tell your friends
in the police station...

546
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,840
that I know.

547
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,550
And when my judgment comes,

548
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,080
I'll be the one that's laughing.

549
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,280
Get out.

550
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,430

Tell everybody this is what

who come into the Green from now on.

Orders of Sabini.

568
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,630
Look, I'm not a Blinder.
I'm not. I've been stood up.

573
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,430
Where's the boy?

574
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,390
In the back room.
I only brought him

575
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,430
because afterwards
we're going to the museum.

576
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,190
~ He wanted to come in
and say hello but... ~ Shut up, John.

577
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,840
There is nothing of interest
to Michael in this room.

578
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,680
Tommy, get on with it.

579
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,470
Last night, one of our men
had his throat cut in Winson Green.

580
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,870
This morning, I had a telegram
to say it was Sabini who ordered it.

581
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,710
And it says here that
Thomas Shelby's next.

582
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,550
If our men think
we can't look after them in prison,

583
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,950
they'll not work for us.

584
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,430
Sabini knows that. So we need
to get the Green sorted out.

585
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,870
Scudboat, you and one of the boys.

586
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,510
Break a couple of windows
and get yourselves arrested.

587
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,630
I'll have our coppers
get you into the Green

588
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,430
and you can find
the bastards who did it.

589
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,590
Instead of breaking a window,
can we pinch a car?

590
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,630
THEY LAUGH

591
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,510
What? Everybody else
is getting a bloody car.

592
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,110
I'm still on a donkey.

593
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,630
All right, just get yourselves
fucking arrested,

594
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,910
it doesn't matter how.

595
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,510
And before you all laugh,
a boy is dead.

596
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,590
He was just a kid.

597
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,750
We'll start a fund for his family,
Pol.

598
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,840
Agreed.

599
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,910
So is that it? Can I go now?

600
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,910
Well, as company treasurer,

601
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,470
I need your permission
to spend 1,000 guineas.

602
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,550
On what?

603
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,320
On a horse.

604
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,150
1,000 guineas on a horse?

605
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,520
That's right.

606
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,870
When was this decided?

607
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,750
You've been busy with Michael.

608
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,030
Oh, my God.

609
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,590
So, in the absence of common sense,
you boys have had an idea.

610
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,150
Polly...

611
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,070
there's a thoroughbred
quarter-Arab filly

612
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,190
up for auction
at the Doncaster Blood Stock.

613
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,270
What do we want with
a 1,000-guinea horse?

614
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,990
When we make our move on
Sabini's racing pitches,

615
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,070
any men we get into
the betting enclosure

616
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,990
will be lifted by Sabini's police.

617
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,830
A good racehorse is a passport
to the owner's enclosure.

618
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,560
We'll be in there
with all the toffs.

619
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,670
Coppers won't know where to look.

620
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,430
Yeah, the Epsom Derby, Pol.

621
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,390
We'll be drinking
with the bloody King.

622
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,190
The Derby?

623
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,840
Did he say the Derby?

624
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,990
That's right.

625
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,830
For the last ten years
Sabini's made it his race.

626
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,390
If we're going to take him down,
might as well make it there
as a symbol.

627
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,550
~ Did you come up with this idea
in a pub by any chance? ~ Pol...

628
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:31,030
a good racehorse is
an investment, like property.

629
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,990
We need to diversify the portfolio.

630
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,590
So when is this sale?

631
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,110
Tomorrow.

632
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,310
And Tommy's had a death threat
so we'll have to go with him
for protection.

633
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:44,150
So, you're going to close up
the shop, go out on a piss-up

634
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,110
and blow 1,000 guineas on a horse
that's not even whole Arab.

635
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,830
~ CURLY GIGGLES
~ Quarter Arab is better!

636
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,640
~ Quarter Arab, it means...
~ Curly, shut up.

637
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,830
I thought I told you
to lock that door.

638
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,870
He did.

639
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,710
I used the key on the nail.

640
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,070
Look, I've been listening.
I want to go with them.

641
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,160
You see?!

642
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,470
I love horses. I could even help.

643
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,470
Over my dead body.

644
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,790
It'll be all right, Mum...

645
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,990
I've been to loads of horse auctions
before with my uncle.

646
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,790
They're very respectable.
People bring their butlers.

647
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,310
Yeah, and their posh wives!

648
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,710
And their mistresses...

649
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,320
Let him come, Polly.

650
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,150
We'll go there,
buy an 'orse, come back.

651
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,800
I'll drop him back at the house
in Sutton before it gets dark.

652
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,600
No.

653
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,120
Fucking no.

654
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,430
All right, that's it.
Back to work.

655
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,520
Come on!

656
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,870
Aunt Pol,
when I was Michael's age,

657
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,990
I'd killed a hundred men
and seen a thousand die.

658
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,350
If you want to scare
that kid away for ever,

659
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,510
carry on how you're going.

660
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,950
If you want him to stay,

661
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,640
let him come.

662
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,150
I can't believe it,

663
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,280
all John's old things fit me.

664
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,200
Christ, you look like your father.

665
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,280
Shrimp... ham.

666
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,150
What was he like - my dad?

667
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,440
How did he die?

668
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,550
Well, I won't lie to you,

669
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,110
he died drunk,

670
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,280
squeezed between
a boat and a lock.

671
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,440
A real river gypsy's death.

672
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,070
But he could sing,

673
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,280
play the piano...

674
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,920
His smile would break your heart.

675
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,000
You've got his same beautiful eyes.

676
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,440
When he was sober,
he was kind and gentle.

677
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,870
His trouble was,

678
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,240
he fell in with the wrong crowd
when he was a boy.

679
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,270
CAR HORN BLOWS

680
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:06,990
I have told them
not to blow that horn.

681
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,720
This is a respectable
fucking neighbourhood!

682
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,160
~ She's heating up, Curly,
take a look. ~ Yeah.

683
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,000
Let me out for a piss.

684
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,990
MICHAEL: She made loads.
Do you want one?

685
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,590
What the bloody hell's that?

686
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,270
Sandwiches, ham I think.
And we've got shrimp paste, too.

687
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,440
There's tea, but we'll have to
take turns cos there's only one cup.

688
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,630
What?

689
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,630
Sandwiches?

690
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,670
Yeah.

691
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,510
Polly made bloody sandwiches?

692
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,950
What's this,
teddy bear's fucking picnic?

693
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,870
All right. We will drink the tea
and we will eat the sandwiches

694
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,190
and then we will drive on.
All right?

695
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,400
No crumbs, Charlie.

696
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,270
~ Hand them over. ~ Herd them up,
Arth, you fat bastard. ~ Fuck off.

697
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,560
John, come on!

698
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,430
All right, lads,
this is a respectable event

699
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,150
and we will all behave accordingly.

700
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,990
No weapons, no drinking.
John, we will stay together.

701
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,030
When the horse comes up,
I will do the bidding.

702
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,550
I've already registered my interest
with the auctioneer

703
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,230
so he knows to expect my bids.

704
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,230
Do I get to run a hand
over her, Tommy?

705
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,150
We'll have a vet's report, Curly.
But keep an eye open when she walks.

706
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,310
I've got a feeling, Tommy.
Something isn't right.

707
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,830
It's all right, Curly.
You're just in an unfamiliar place,

708
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,870
~ we all are. ~ I get feelings
sometimes, Tommy. ~ It's all right,
Curly,

709
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,070
~ it's all right. ~ Shut up, Curly.
~ AUCTIONEER: Do I hear 1,450?

710
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:50,470
Do I hear 500? 500...
1,600, 1,700, thank you.

711
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,070
1,900, 2,000!

712
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,550
2,100, 2,200, 2...

713
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,030
Why do people come late
to these things?

714
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,430
Hmm?

715
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,750
People come late
cos they know what they want.

716
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,030
It's only you who needs
to see every horse.

717
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,710
2,700 am I bid?

718
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,920
2,600 I am bid...

719
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,110
Sold!

720
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:16,190
Morals of Marcus, Sedgemere stud,
by Tetrach out of Lady Josephine.

721
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,750
We'll start the bidding
at 800 guineas.

722
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,080
All right, Tommy, this is her.

723
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,710
Do I hear 800 guineas?

724
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,150
850.

725
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,430
850, do I hear 9?

726
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,190
Do I hear 9?

727
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,070
~ 9 am I bid? ~ Bid for this one.

728
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,390
The grey? Why?

729
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,550
~ He's beautiful. ~ It's a filly.

730
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,030
Micky needs some pace
on the gallops. I promised him.

731
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,910
1,000. Do I hear 1,050?

732
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,960
1,100?

733
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,910
1,200?

734
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,000
Do I hear 250?

735
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,310
250.

736
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,950
I'll go halves with you
from the spring fund. Go, go.

737
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,990
1,300?

738
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,590
1,400?

739
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,230
Do I hear 5?

740
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,270
1,500.

741
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,110
1,600.

742
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,470
Do I hear 7?

743
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,190
1,700, thank you.

744
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,830
~ That's it, Tom, you have to stop.
~ You don't have it in your belt.

745
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,350
Yes, I do. I'm having the horse.

746
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,750
CURLY: She's a sweet beast, Tom.
But stop, I tell you.

747
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,950
~ I feel something bad.
~ Shut up, Curly!

748
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,710
2,000. Do I hear 2,050?

749
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,320
2,050 am I bid?

750
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,230
Enough!

751
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,430
Billy could use one of my geldings.

752
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,910
2,000 I am bid. Do I hear 2,050?

753
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,710
Last time.

754
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,680
2,050?

755
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,830
Sold to Mr...?

756
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,760
Thomas Shelby.

757
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,800
THE CROWD MURMURS

758
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,670
To the premises
of Mr Charles Strong,

759
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,990
Small Heath.

760
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,430
~ What kind of premises?
~ Boat yard.

761
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,470
Yachts?

762
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,800
Canals.

763
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,590
I'm curious.
What is your business, Mr Shelby?

764
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,920
Import/export.

765
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,680
But I also sell pegs
and tell fortunes(!)

766
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,280
You beat us to it.

767
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,750
Did I?

768
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,160
I was trying to nab a filly
for my stud.

769
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,440
~ Sorry. ~ Thomas Shelby from where?

770
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,870
From Birmingham.

771
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,110
Goodness!

772
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,400
No, not much.

773
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,550
May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.

774
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,430
What is it you do?

775
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,110
I rarely answer questions,
is what I do.

776
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:13,430
~ Tommy, come on, hurry up!
We've got to go!
~ THE MEN LAUGH

777
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,070
Well, before you go, if you ever
decided to put that filly out,

778
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,110
~ I'd be interested in having her.
~ I plan to race her.

779
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,710
Do you have a trainer?

780
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,800
I know people.

781
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,910
I know people, too.

782
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,190
Tommy! We've got to get
this kid back before dark

783
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,950
or Polly'll have your balls!

784
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,710
She will have 'em!

785
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,910
We know different people,
I would guess.

786
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,590
My father knows Mick Hancock.

787
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,510
Trained three Ascot winners.

788
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,040
Oh, so that was your father?

789
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,870
Yes.

790
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,230
We're joint owners of the stud.

791
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,430
He took the majority share
when my husband was killed.

792
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,590
Ypres.

793
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,150
Tommy!

794
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,590
We've got to get back
to the caravans!

795
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,600
The chickens are hungry!

796
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,120
So will you consider me?

797
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,600
I will consider you.

798
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,710
You still didn't tell me
what you do.

799
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,080
Oh, I do bad things.

800
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,240
But you already know that.

801
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,480
Right, about bloody time!

802
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,150
It's the fucking truth, John boy.

803
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:28,350
Rich women these days, all they want
is working-class cock.

804
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,550
Tommy, maybe she was the
something bad I had a feeling about!

805
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,750
She looked all right to me, Curly!

806
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:37,070
All their men are dead, see.
Officers, all shot.

807
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,230
Yeah, by us.

808
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,670
All I'll say is she has
good contacts in the racing world.

809
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,870
Here, Michael, you drive.

810
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,550
Thomas Shelby?

811
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,800
Tommy!

812
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,600
Tommy! Down!

813
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,510
Tommy Shelby?

814
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,150
How about fucking Arthur?!

815
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,070
Fucking good to meet you.

816
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,510
Get him off him!

817
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,950
~ Arthur! ~ Arthur!

818
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,750
Get him off him!!

819
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,470
Come on. Stop it, Arthur.

820
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,950
Get him off.

821
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,950
Arthur, that's enough.

822
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,040
Arthur, come on!

823
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,230
Come on, Arthur, come on.

824
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,920
It's over.

825
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,680
Arthur!

826
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,920
Come on, shut up.

827
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,160
Come on, come on.

828
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,510
He's still breathing.

829
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,510
Don't get blood on the kid!

830
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,830
Michael, you didn't see a thing.
This didn't happen, all right?

831
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,830
Give me the keys.

832
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,470
Michael, give me the keys.

833
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,880
I'm all right to drive.

834
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,510
All right. Go on. Go on, go on!

835
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,270
Tommy, he's fucking scarpered!

836
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,480
~ Right, let's get out of here
sharpish. ~ Come on!

So... how'd it go?

00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,910
Well, it was cold in the van

840
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,310
but it was super... really.

841
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,080
Let me smell your breath.

842
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,360
And did they behave themselves?

843
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,070
They were amazing, Mum.

844
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,280
