1
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,656
Nothing is evil
in the beginning.

2
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:25,739
Here! Over here!

3
00:00:29,698 --> 00:00:33,823
And there was a time
when the world was so young,

4
00:00:33,864 --> 00:00:36,864
there had not yet been a sunrise.

5
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,323
But even then there was light.

6
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:05,823
Well, is it finished yet?

7
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:21,323
Even you couldn't possibly believe
that old scrap will float.

8
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:24,281
It's not going to float.

9
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:28,614
It's going to sail.

10
00:01:48,614 --> 00:01:49,698
-Stop!

11
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:51,114
No, don't!

12
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:53,989
-Stop, you'll break it!

13
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:56,031
Stop! Don't!

14
00:01:56,114 --> 00:01:58,448
-Come on.
-Stop, you're breaking it! Stop!

15
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:03,948
I told you it wouldn't float.

16
00:02:07,656 --> 00:02:09,114
Get off me!

17
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,489
Lose your footing again, Galadriel?

18
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,781
It was a good ship, sister.

19
00:02:21,864 --> 00:02:23,781
I made it just as you taught me.

20
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:30,239
Do you know why a ship floats
and a stone cannot?

21
00:02:30,906 --> 00:02:35,281
Because the stone sees only downward.

22
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:40,198
The darkness of the water is vast
and irresistible.

23
00:02:41,656 --> 00:02:43,698
The ship feels the darkness as well,

24
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:47,614
striving moment by moment
to master her and pull her under.

25
00:02:49,406 --> 00:02:51,698
But the ship has a secret.

26
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:57,239
For unlike the stone,
her gaze is not downward but up.

27
00:02:58,614 --> 00:03:00,823
Fixed upon the light that guides her,

28
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:04,781
whispering of grander things
than darkness ever knew.

29
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:10,448
But sometimes the lights shine
just as brightly

30
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:13,198
reflected in the water
as they do in the sky.

31
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:16,489
It's hard to say which way is up
and which way is down.

32
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,823
How am I to know which lights to follow?

33
00:03:33,323 --> 00:03:34,823
But that seems so simple.

34
00:03:34,906 --> 00:03:37,114
The most important truths often are.

35
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:40,406
But you must learn
to discern them for yourself.

36
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:43,323
I won't always be here
to speak them to you.

37
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:44,823
You won't?

38
00:03:46,198 --> 00:03:48,698
Come along. Mother and Father are waiting.

39
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,406
We had no word for death.

40
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:05,489
For we thought our joys would be unending.

41
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:23,781
We thought our light would never dim.

42
00:04:28,614 --> 00:04:31,739
So when the Great Foe, Morgoth,

43
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:34,864
destroyed the very light of our home...

44
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:39,739
We resisted.

45
00:04:43,531 --> 00:04:47,198
And a legion of Elves went to war.

46
00:04:52,948 --> 00:04:58,906
We left Valinor, our home,
and journeyed to a distant realm.

47
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:05,198
One filled with untold perils
and strange creatures beyond count.

48
00:05:05,823 --> 00:05:09,323
A place known as Middle-earth.

49
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,823
Valaron kalanen!

50
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:40,281
Firuvantë!

51
00:05:44,031 --> 00:05:46,448
They said it would be over quickly,

52
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:52,406
but the war left Middle-earth in ruin.

53
00:05:55,614 --> 00:05:59,198
And would last centuries.

54
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:23,614
Now, we learned many words for death.

55
00:06:28,864 --> 00:06:31,823
In the end, Morgoth would be defeated.

56
00:06:32,823 --> 00:06:35,573
But not before much sorrow.

57
00:06:38,073 --> 00:06:42,698
For his Orcs had spread
to every corner of Middle-earth,

58
00:06:44,073 --> 00:06:46,531
Multiplying ever greater

59
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:50,114
under the command
of his most devoted servant,

60
00:06:50,198 --> 00:06:54,031
a cruel and cunning sorcerer.

61
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,948
They called him Sauron.

62
00:06:58,656 --> 00:07:02,239
My brother vowed to seek him out
and destroy him.

63
00:07:04,948 --> 00:07:07,156
But Sauron found him first

64
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:11,573
and marked his flesh with a symbol.

65
00:07:14,364 --> 00:07:17,823
One whose meaning even our wisest
could not discern.

66
00:07:22,323 --> 00:07:25,156
And there, in the darkness,

67
00:07:25,823 --> 00:07:28,989
his vow became mine.

68
00:07:31,031 --> 00:07:33,573
And so, we hunted.

69
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:38,698
To the ends of the Earth we hunted Sauron.

70
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:43,781
But the trail grew thin.

71
00:07:46,364 --> 00:07:48,156
Year gave way to year.

72
00:07:48,906 --> 00:07:51,114
Century gave way to century.

73
00:07:51,656 --> 00:07:55,323
And for many Elves, the pain of those days

74
00:07:55,406 --> 00:07:58,406
passed out of thought and mind.

75
00:07:59,448 --> 00:08:01,948
More and more of our kind

76
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:05,531
began to believe that Sauron
was but a memory.

77
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:10,698
And the threat, at last, was ended.

78
00:08:13,531 --> 00:08:15,864
I wish I could be one of them.

79
00:09:13,281 --> 00:09:14,781
Commander Galadriel.

80
00:09:16,864 --> 00:09:19,948
This company has followed you
to the very edge of the world.

81
00:09:20,031 --> 00:09:22,823
But none who ever dared search
for this last stronghold

82
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:24,323
has ever found anything.

83
00:09:25,864 --> 00:09:28,864
It's been years
since the last Orc was sighted.

84
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:34,198
Is it not possible the other commanders
are right and our enemy is no more?

85
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:35,489
Night is closing in.

86
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:40,239
How long can living flesh endure
where even sunlight fears to tread?

87
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:47,198
Perhaps we would be wise to camp here.

88
00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:50,198
And tomorrow, begin the journey home.

89
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:56,114
We are losing the light.

90
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:12,239
Commander, wait!

91
00:10:12,323 --> 00:10:14,823
No. We keep moving.

92
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,739
Galadriel, stop!

93
00:10:38,948 --> 00:10:42,364
There's nothing out here.
We should have been there by now.

94
00:10:50,614 --> 00:10:51,823
We are there.

95
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:14,698
This is it.

96
00:11:14,781 --> 00:11:17,989
This is where the Orcs gathered
after Morgoth's defeat.

97
00:11:19,073 --> 00:11:21,989
Far more must have escaped,
than we ever imagined.

98
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,364
My hand is past feeling.

99
00:11:27,406 --> 00:11:28,489
No.

100
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:33,448
This place is so evil,
our torches give off no warmth.

101
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:35,364
This way.

102
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:37,448
How can you be certain?

103
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,614
It's colder than the rest.

104
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:10,823
A door was filled in here.

105
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,031
Bring it down.

106
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:50,573
What devilry is this?

107
00:12:53,323 --> 00:12:56,864
These Orcs were meddling
with the powers of the Unseen World.

108
00:12:57,614 --> 00:12:59,531
Some dark sorcery of old.

109
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:05,406
But what was their purpose?

110
00:13:06,364 --> 00:13:09,198
Surely, it is lost to the ages now.

111
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:11,448
Whatever happened here was long ago.

112
00:13:19,073 --> 00:13:20,156
Water.

113
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,239
Even stone cannot hide the mark

114
00:13:32,323 --> 00:13:34,906
of one whose very hand
is flame unquenched.

115
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:43,739
He was here.

116
00:13:44,864 --> 00:13:46,614
Sauron was here.

117
00:13:47,073 --> 00:13:49,406
Tell the others to rest while they can.

118
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:52,698
At sunrise we move on.
We'll take the search further north.

119
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:53,864
Further north?

120
00:13:53,948 --> 00:13:56,864
This mark was left as a trail
for Orcs to follow.

121
00:13:57,781 --> 00:14:00,281
The last time I saw it was on my brother.

122
00:14:00,864 --> 00:14:01,989
We must follow it.

123
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:04,531
The mark is centuries old.

124
00:14:04,614 --> 00:14:06,448
Whoever left it could be long dead.

125
00:14:06,531 --> 00:14:08,406
Or lying in wait, gathering strength,

126
00:14:08,489 --> 00:14:10,823
perfecting whatever dark art
eluded him here.

127
00:14:10,906 --> 00:14:12,906
We exceeded our orders months ago.

128
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:17,031
Surely we must first return home
to take counsel with the High King.

129
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:20,614
I promise you there is not a soul
amongst our company

130
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:23,656
who yearns for home more than I.

131
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,739
I can still feel the light of the Trees
on my face.

132
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:32,156
I can still see it.

133
00:14:34,156 --> 00:14:36,323
And until we are certain

134
00:14:36,823 --> 00:14:40,406
every trace of our enemy is vanquished...

135
00:14:42,906 --> 00:14:44,406
I can never return.

136
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:19,323
Snow-troll!

137
00:16:35,489 --> 00:16:37,323
We should never
have come in here.

138
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:38,781
We leave soon enough.

139
00:16:40,364 --> 00:16:41,781
The order is given.

140
00:16:41,906 --> 00:16:43,406
We march at first light.

141
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:52,448
Then you shall do so alone.

142
00:17:55,614 --> 00:17:57,823
Something's wrong here.
Nothing to hunt.

143
00:17:57,906 --> 00:17:59,739
Wolves in every thicket.

144
00:18:00,114 --> 00:18:02,489
Don't you think
it's the least bit strange?

145
00:18:02,573 --> 00:18:04,323
World's strange.

146
00:18:04,656 --> 00:18:06,364
If I let 'em pitch-kettle me,

147
00:18:06,448 --> 00:18:08,739
I'd never get off me barstool.

148
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:10,573
-Oi, oi!

149
00:18:13,198 --> 00:18:14,781
Keep walkin'.

150
00:18:14,864 --> 00:18:15,948
Why?

151
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:20,281
Looked like a badger. Maybe a fox.

152
00:18:20,364 --> 00:18:21,698
More likely a Harfoot.

153
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:23,031
A Harfoot?

154
00:18:23,114 --> 00:18:24,948
Ugh. Don't care to be seein' none,

155
00:18:25,031 --> 00:18:28,073
but if you do, watch yourself.

156
00:18:28,156 --> 00:18:30,489
Dangerous creatures they are.

157
00:18:31,906 --> 00:18:32,906
You're making it up.

158
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,323
Come on. Rattle your dags!

159
00:18:38,031 --> 00:18:41,198
Let's just get to the lake before sundown.

160
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:00,489
-Huh? Huh.

161
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:11,156
Clear and clear.

162
00:19:25,156 --> 00:19:26,198
Nori!

163
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:29,323
Nori!

164
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:31,614
Nori!

165
00:19:37,114 --> 00:19:38,281
Nori!

166
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,364
Travelers? At this time of year?

167
00:20:00,448 --> 00:20:02,739
-It's an omen, I warrant ya.

168
00:20:02,823 --> 00:20:05,406
-Mmm-hmm. Bad one. As bad as they come.
-Easy, Malva.

169
00:20:05,489 --> 00:20:08,739
The last time we had travelers this early,
it was the Great Frost.

170
00:20:08,823 --> 00:20:12,198
And there's no misremembering
how bleak a season that was.

171
00:20:12,281 --> 00:20:14,281
More than likely they just got lost,
that's it.

172
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:15,781
Has to be the reason.

173
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:17,198
You're gonna spoil dinner.

174
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:19,156
I've looked high and low again.

175
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:20,906
The wee ones are still out there.

176
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:23,531
They'll be fine, Goldie.

177
00:20:23,614 --> 00:20:26,323
Nori's with them. You know Nori.

178
00:20:26,406 --> 00:20:28,239
Yes. I do.

179
00:20:30,656 --> 00:20:32,239
Can we turn back now?

180
00:20:32,323 --> 00:20:34,823
There's 110 things out here
that could kill us.

181
00:20:34,906 --> 00:20:38,198
Hundred-eleven
if you count you worrying to death.

182
00:20:38,281 --> 00:20:40,781
You know the rules.
We're not supposed to be out this far.

183
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,489
Don't be... If we didn't do everything
we weren't supposed to,

184
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:45,198
we'd hardly do anything at all.

185
00:20:45,323 --> 00:20:46,156
Me first!

186
00:20:48,323 --> 00:20:50,698
Go on, now. Watch the puddle.

187
00:20:51,823 --> 00:20:53,323
Watch your head.

188
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:56,073
This way!

189
00:20:56,573 --> 00:20:57,698
Nori!

190
00:20:58,573 --> 00:20:59,864
-I'm stuck.
-I've got you.

191
00:21:00,156 --> 00:21:01,489
-It's...

192
00:21:01,573 --> 00:21:02,989
Nori! Ow!

193
00:21:07,864 --> 00:21:08,948
Enchanting.

194
00:21:11,823 --> 00:21:13,073
Come on.

195
00:21:13,156 --> 00:21:14,906
Can we turn back now?

196
00:21:14,989 --> 00:21:17,698
-Oh, but you haven't even seen it yet.
-Seen what?

197
00:21:17,781 --> 00:21:20,156
Good place for a hill-troll to hide,
if you ask me.

198
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,489
Oh, great glory and splendor.

199
00:21:28,948 --> 00:21:29,989
Oh!

200
00:21:33,781 --> 00:21:34,948
Nori!

201
00:21:37,489 --> 00:21:38,323
Mmm.

202
00:21:42,864 --> 00:21:43,698
Mmm.

203
00:21:54,948 --> 00:21:56,114
Nori!

204
00:21:57,323 --> 00:21:58,489
I found something.

205
00:21:59,948 --> 00:22:01,656
There's something in the mud.

206
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:03,698
What is it?

207
00:22:05,781 --> 00:22:07,198
It looks like a footsie.

208
00:22:09,448 --> 00:22:10,489
A dog.

209
00:22:11,198 --> 00:22:14,114
Just a dog.
You know how dogs love berries.

210
00:22:20,864 --> 00:22:22,948
Is he going to eat our berries?

211
00:22:23,031 --> 00:22:25,114
Not if he doesn't see us, he isn't.

212
00:22:25,864 --> 00:22:29,198
Hey. Twos and hands, everyone. Time to go.

213
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,739
-What's the big rush?
-Wolf.

214
00:22:34,073 --> 00:22:35,823
You heard your sister. Time to go.

215
00:22:35,906 --> 00:22:37,739
Go on, now. Come on.

216
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,698
First one back to camp
gets the first pie at Harvest Fest.

217
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:41,781
Let's go.

218
00:22:43,406 --> 00:22:47,281
Remember, if anybody asks,
we were just out digging for snails.

219
00:22:57,073 --> 00:23:01,031
"I Palannúmen...
I Alfirimë Nóri...

220
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:02,864
"Na metta avantë...

221
00:23:03,823 --> 00:23:05,031
"Home.

222
00:23:07,573 --> 00:23:11,406
"For centuries, they have swept
across crag and crevice,

223
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:14,114
"washing away the last remnants
of our enemy.

224
00:23:14,698 --> 00:23:17,364
"Like a spring rain over the bones of a...

225
00:23:18,323 --> 00:23:19,406
"Dead animal."

226
00:23:21,531 --> 00:23:24,864
"Spring rain over the bones of a..."

227
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:27,989
Herald Elrond.

228
00:23:30,448 --> 00:23:31,614
At last.

229
00:23:32,781 --> 00:23:35,614
Yes. It's almost as if I didn't wish
to be found.

230
00:23:35,906 --> 00:23:37,198
What tidings?

231
00:23:37,281 --> 00:23:39,031
The Council regrets to inform you

232
00:23:39,114 --> 00:23:41,698
you won't be permitted
to attend the next session.

233
00:23:43,948 --> 00:23:45,323
Elf-lords only.

234
00:23:48,323 --> 00:23:49,739
Is there anything else?

235
00:23:49,823 --> 00:23:51,948
Yes. Your friend has arrived.

236
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:55,281
She's here? Why didn't you say so?

237
00:24:02,198 --> 00:24:03,406
For the ceremony.

238
00:24:21,448 --> 00:24:22,614
Galadriel.

239
00:24:24,614 --> 00:24:25,573
Elrond.

240
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:28,989
Lindon receives you with grace.

241
00:24:29,073 --> 00:24:30,739
With grace, I am received.

242
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:40,156
I hear it's said that
when you cross over, you hear a song.

243
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:42,364
One whose memory we all carry.

244
00:24:43,573 --> 00:24:45,031
And you are immersed in a light,

245
00:24:45,114 --> 00:24:48,823
more intoxicating than any sensation
in all of Middle-earth.

246
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:53,156
When I was a child,
it was the only feeling I knew.

247
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:54,948
And look at you now.

248
00:24:55,031 --> 00:24:58,031
Commander of the Northern Armies.
Warrior of the Wastelands.

249
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:02,989
I half expected you to arrive
caked in grime and mud.

250
00:25:03,073 --> 00:25:06,114
This time, frostbite and troll blood.

251
00:25:07,114 --> 00:25:08,198
And no army.

252
00:25:09,323 --> 00:25:10,739
Tell me everything.

253
00:25:11,406 --> 00:25:14,739
This mark's very existence
proves Sauron escaped.

254
00:25:14,823 --> 00:25:16,073
He's still out there.

255
00:25:16,489 --> 00:25:18,114
The question now is, where?

256
00:25:19,198 --> 00:25:22,073
I intend to ask of the King
a fresh company.

257
00:25:22,156 --> 00:25:25,156
-If he supplies enough to...
-You have only just arrived.

258
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:27,448
Must you speak of leaving again so soon?

259
00:25:27,531 --> 00:25:29,364
You know very well why I must.

260
00:25:30,198 --> 00:25:33,614
There will be ample time later
to discuss official matters.

261
00:25:34,656 --> 00:25:36,239
I want to hear about you.

262
00:25:37,656 --> 00:25:39,239
Your harrowing journey.

263
00:25:39,948 --> 00:25:41,031
Why, Elrond.

264
00:25:41,114 --> 00:25:43,239
You really have become a politician.

265
00:25:43,323 --> 00:25:45,073
You make it sound so grim.

266
00:25:45,156 --> 00:25:48,489
I am not some courtier
to be placated by idle flattery.

267
00:25:49,823 --> 00:25:52,239
I demand to speak with the King directly.

268
00:25:54,656 --> 00:25:56,364
You have made that plain.

269
00:25:57,698 --> 00:25:59,656
So I will be equally plain.

270
00:26:02,698 --> 00:26:05,531
It was not your company
who defied you out there,

271
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,364
but rather you who defied the High King,

272
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:11,989
by refusing to heed
any limit placed upon you.

273
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:15,281
In an act of magnanimity,

274
00:26:15,364 --> 00:26:18,073
he has chosen
to honor your accomplishments...

275
00:26:18,906 --> 00:26:21,239
Rather than dwell upon your insolence.

276
00:26:23,698 --> 00:26:25,364
Test him again

277
00:26:25,448 --> 00:26:28,864
and you may find him less receptive
than you might have hoped.

278
00:26:35,364 --> 00:26:38,406
Are you going
to arrange an audience or not?

279
00:26:40,531 --> 00:26:43,489
If after the ceremony
that is still your wish,

280
00:26:43,573 --> 00:26:44,989
you shall have it.

281
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,781
Ah. She has returned.

282
00:26:58,864 --> 00:27:01,448
-How fare thee?
-Well and well, Father.

283
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:02,989
And look at her!

284
00:27:03,073 --> 00:27:05,114
You found all that
down by the river bank, did you?

285
00:27:05,198 --> 00:27:06,073
Mm-hmm.

286
00:27:06,906 --> 00:27:08,864
Did you hear about the travelers?

287
00:27:08,948 --> 00:27:11,364
-Travelers?
-Mm-hmm. Hunters.

288
00:27:11,948 --> 00:27:13,281
Two of them.

289
00:27:13,364 --> 00:27:15,448
Big as great boulders.

290
00:27:15,531 --> 00:27:16,989
Right up on that ridge.

291
00:27:17,073 --> 00:27:18,573
I can't believe I missed them.

292
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:22,323
Maybe you ought to stick closer to home,
that way you don't miss anything, hmm?

293
00:27:31,156 --> 00:27:33,364
You went to the old farm again.

294
00:27:34,073 --> 00:27:35,239
Didn't you?

295
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:37,364
I was careful.

296
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:39,364
But the children might not be.

297
00:27:39,448 --> 00:27:41,031
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

298
00:27:41,114 --> 00:27:43,281
We never get hunters up here
before the harvest.

299
00:27:43,364 --> 00:27:45,573
-Mmm.
-Or wolves.

300
00:27:48,448 --> 00:27:50,989
I wonder if there's trouble down south.

301
00:27:51,073 --> 00:27:53,531
And what concern is that of yours,
Elanor Brandyfoot?

302
00:27:58,614 --> 00:28:00,323
Haven't you ever wondered...

303
00:28:01,364 --> 00:28:02,864
What else is out there?

304
00:28:03,489 --> 00:28:04,823
How far the river flows

305
00:28:04,906 --> 00:28:08,531
or where the sparrows
learn the new songs they sing in spring?

306
00:28:09,114 --> 00:28:13,281
I can't help but feel
there's wonders in this world.

307
00:28:13,823 --> 00:28:15,448
Beyond our wanderin'.

308
00:28:16,406 --> 00:28:17,948
I've told you.

309
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:20,531
Countless times.

310
00:28:22,448 --> 00:28:24,864
Elves have forests to protect.

311
00:28:24,948 --> 00:28:28,198
Dwarves, their mines.
Men, their fields of grain.

312
00:28:29,114 --> 00:28:32,781
Even trees have to worry
about the soil beneath their roots.

313
00:28:33,406 --> 00:28:37,239
But we Harfoots are free
from the worries of the wide world.

314
00:28:37,323 --> 00:28:41,073
We are but ripples in a long, long stream.

315
00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:43,906
Our paths set by the passing seasons.

316
00:28:44,781 --> 00:28:47,656
Nobody goes off trail
and nobody walks alone.

317
00:28:49,656 --> 00:28:52,364
We have each other. We're safe.

318
00:28:53,823 --> 00:28:55,323
That is how we survive.

319
00:28:57,989 --> 00:29:00,823
Go on. Help your father.

320
00:29:03,531 --> 00:29:06,948
That's your problem.
You see, a wheel's supposed to be round.

321
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:44,614
These most valiant of warriors

322
00:29:44,698 --> 00:29:49,239
kneel here before us, victorious.

323
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:53,656
For though Morgoth fell an Age ago,

324
00:29:54,364 --> 00:29:58,156
some feared a new evil might arise
from his shadow.

325
00:29:58,239 --> 00:30:00,073
So for centuries now,

326
00:30:00,156 --> 00:30:04,239
these soldiers have swept
across crag and crevice,

327
00:30:04,323 --> 00:30:07,573
washing away the last remnants
of our enemy

328
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:11,364
like a spring rain over the bones
of a spoilt carcass.

329
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:15,406
And now, at last,

330
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:19,989
they return to us in triumph,

331
00:30:20,073 --> 00:30:23,198
for they have proven beyond any doubt

332
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:27,406
that our days of war are over.

333
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:30,823
Today...

334
00:30:32,656 --> 00:30:35,489
Our days of peace begin.

335
00:31:01,489 --> 00:31:04,906
And as a measure of our gratitude,

336
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,531
these heroes shall be granted an honor

337
00:31:08,614 --> 00:31:11,364
unrivaled in all our lore.

338
00:31:11,448 --> 00:31:14,739
They will be escorted to the Grey Havens

339
00:31:14,823 --> 00:31:19,156
and granted passage across the sea
to dwell for all eternity

340
00:31:20,239 --> 00:31:23,948
in the Blessed Realm, the Far West.

341
00:31:24,031 --> 00:31:27,198
The Undying Lands of Valinor.

342
00:31:28,031 --> 00:31:31,864
At last, they are going home.

343
00:32:33,989 --> 00:32:37,323
Are you just going to stand there,
breathing like an Orc?

344
00:32:40,531 --> 00:32:43,948
It is said the wine of victory is sweetest

345
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:46,614
for those in whose bitter trials
it has fermented.

346
00:32:47,364 --> 00:32:49,198
I do not feel victorious.

347
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:52,323
You deserve the honors of this day.

348
00:32:53,198 --> 00:32:54,864
Your brother would be proud.

349
00:33:01,156 --> 00:33:03,906
I remember when the first of these
were carved.

350
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:08,656
The likeness of one fallen,
preserved upon a living thing.

351
00:33:08,739 --> 00:33:12,489
I suppose some part of me
always believed my rest would be here,

352
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:13,864
with them.

353
00:33:14,906 --> 00:33:16,823
But instead, I am to leave them.

354
00:33:18,406 --> 00:33:22,406
This is the gift of your king.

355
00:33:25,948 --> 00:33:27,948
A gift I have decided to refuse.

356
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:30,073
Galadriel, you...

357
00:33:30,156 --> 00:33:32,864
My brother gave his life hunting Sauron.

358
00:33:34,364 --> 00:33:36,364
His task is now mine.

359
00:33:39,198 --> 00:33:42,406
I go to seek the enemy
that escaped us in the north.

360
00:33:44,031 --> 00:33:46,073
Alone, if I must.

361
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:51,239
Ah, yes. Your mystery sigil.

362
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:53,156
I shared it with the High King.

363
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,031
-Then why would...
-Because seeing a sigil

364
00:33:55,114 --> 00:33:57,656
does not mean you're any closer
to finding Sauron.

365
00:33:57,739 --> 00:34:01,114
It is over. The evil is gone.

366
00:34:01,198 --> 00:34:03,573
Then why is it not gone from in here?

367
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:06,989
After all you have endured...

368
00:34:08,364 --> 00:34:10,614
It is only natural to feel conflicted.

369
00:34:11,614 --> 00:34:13,073
Conflicted?

370
00:34:16,698 --> 00:34:19,614
I am grateful you have not known evil
as I have.

371
00:34:20,823 --> 00:34:23,073
But you have not seen what I have seen.

372
00:34:23,156 --> 00:34:24,198
I've seen my share.

373
00:34:24,281 --> 00:34:27,906
You have not seen what I have seen.

374
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,864
Evil does not sleep, Elrond.

375
00:34:32,198 --> 00:34:33,406
It waits.

376
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:36,906
And in the moment of our complacency,

377
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:38,406
it blinds us.

378
00:34:40,364 --> 00:34:42,989
Let us say that all is as you fear,

379
00:34:43,073 --> 00:34:46,406
and this enemy is out there somewhere,
lying in wait.

380
00:34:47,448 --> 00:34:50,239
Do you truly believe seeking him out
will satisfy you?

381
00:34:50,698 --> 00:34:53,989
That one more Orc upon the point
of your blade will bring you peace?

382
00:34:54,073 --> 00:34:55,989
-If you are wrong...
-I'm not wrong.

383
00:34:56,073 --> 00:34:57,531
If you are wrong,

384
00:34:58,406 --> 00:35:01,573
will you lead more Elves
to die in far-off lands?

385
00:35:03,406 --> 00:35:05,531
To convince yourself you have done enough,

386
00:35:05,614 --> 00:35:08,448
how many more statues
would you add to this path?

387
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:11,906
No one in history
has ever refused the call.

388
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:14,823
Do so now, it may never come again.

389
00:35:15,698 --> 00:35:18,698
You will linger here, an outcast,

390
00:35:18,781 --> 00:35:21,031
poisoned in dark whispers and dreams.

391
00:35:21,114 --> 00:35:23,573
And in the West,
do you think my fate would be better?

392
00:35:25,406 --> 00:35:28,864
Where song would mock the cries
of battle in my ears?

393
00:35:30,864 --> 00:35:34,781
You say I have won victory
over all the horrors of Middle-earth.

394
00:35:36,323 --> 00:35:38,531
Yet you would leave them alive in me?

395
00:35:39,614 --> 00:35:40,948
To take with me?

396
00:35:41,948 --> 00:35:45,864
Undying, unchanging, unbreaking,

397
00:35:46,906 --> 00:35:49,281
into the land of winterless spring?

398
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:51,781
Only in the Blessed Realm

399
00:35:51,864 --> 00:35:54,364
can that which is broken in you be healed.

400
00:35:55,198 --> 00:35:56,281
Go there.

401
00:35:56,781 --> 00:35:58,573
Go, and I promise you...

402
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:03,198
If but a whisper of a rumor
of the threat you perceive proves true,

403
00:36:03,698 --> 00:36:06,073
I will not rest until it is put right.

404
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:10,364
You have fought long enough, Galadriel.

405
00:36:12,948 --> 00:36:14,489
Put up your sword.

406
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,156
Without it, what am I to be?

407
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:18,864
What you have always been.

408
00:36:21,823 --> 00:36:23,073
My friend.

409
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,656
Evenin'.

410
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,281
Caraes in three moves.

411
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:25,781
Hmm.

412
00:37:26,864 --> 00:37:27,698
Ha!

413
00:37:28,114 --> 00:37:29,573
Poisoned more likely.

414
00:37:29,656 --> 00:37:31,573
Poisoned? By who?

415
00:37:32,114 --> 00:37:35,198
For all we know,
the onion-eyed scut done it himself.

416
00:37:49,864 --> 00:37:52,198
Has it really been a fortnight already?

417
00:37:53,406 --> 00:37:54,531
It has.

418
00:37:56,364 --> 00:38:00,031
Uh, very little to report this go-round,
I'm afraid.

419
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:03,531
A couple of shabby disputes,
a bit of uneven dice-handling.

420
00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:06,239
And... Oh, yes!

421
00:38:06,323 --> 00:38:08,781
Had a bit of a thrill in here,
Trewsday last.

422
00:38:08,864 --> 00:38:10,781
Bit of a row over a girl.

423
00:38:11,198 --> 00:38:14,614
His eye was lazy, hers overactive,
if you take my meaning.

424
00:38:16,823 --> 00:38:18,948
Do you care for a drink, soldier?

425
00:38:19,031 --> 00:38:21,239
Well, my well is yours, as ever.

426
00:38:21,323 --> 00:38:22,823
And the poisoning?

427
00:38:23,323 --> 00:38:24,364
What poisoning?

428
00:38:24,448 --> 00:38:26,239
The one you were just discussing.

429
00:38:26,323 --> 00:38:27,448
No, no, no, no...

430
00:38:27,531 --> 00:38:30,573
It was but poisoned grass
he was twattlin' about.

431
00:38:32,073 --> 00:38:34,906
A fellow passed through,
said his grazing's gone rotten.

432
00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:37,156
That only weeds will grow.

433
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:39,948
This fellow, where was he from?

434
00:38:40,448 --> 00:38:41,948
Didn't say. East, I think.

435
00:38:42,698 --> 00:38:44,114
On what day was he here?

436
00:38:44,198 --> 00:38:47,239
-Oh, let it go, knife-ears.

437
00:38:48,156 --> 00:38:50,198
It's a bloody patch of grass.

438
00:38:51,281 --> 00:38:55,573
The lot you lump us in with
died off a thousand years ago.

439
00:38:55,656 --> 00:38:58,489
When are you people gonna let the past go?

440
00:39:02,364 --> 00:39:05,906
The past is with us all,
whether we like it or not.

441
00:39:06,781 --> 00:39:10,781
One day, our true king will return.

442
00:39:11,906 --> 00:39:16,406
And pry us right out
from under your pointy boots.

443
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:18,698
-Easy, lad. Quench the fire now.

444
00:39:31,031 --> 00:39:31,948
Come on, lad.

445
00:39:35,156 --> 00:39:37,156
Will there be anythin' else then?

446
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:02,156
Give me your hand.

447
00:40:16,864 --> 00:40:17,739
Hmm.

448
00:40:20,781 --> 00:40:21,948
Alfirin seeds.

449
00:40:24,948 --> 00:40:27,614
I've not seen this flower
since I was a child.

450
00:40:28,364 --> 00:40:29,864
Where did you find these?

451
00:40:30,531 --> 00:40:33,989
I had to trade with another healer
who was passing through.

452
00:40:34,073 --> 00:40:36,198
We crush the petals to form a salve.

453
00:40:36,281 --> 00:40:37,906
You crush them?

454
00:40:37,989 --> 00:40:39,448
Gently.

455
00:40:42,906 --> 00:40:44,906
Are there healers among your kind?

456
00:40:44,989 --> 00:40:46,364
There are.

457
00:40:46,448 --> 00:40:48,281
But we call them artificers.

458
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:53,281
Most wounds to our bodies heal
of their own accord,

459
00:40:53,364 --> 00:40:57,781
so, it is their labor instead to render
hidden truths as works of beauty.

460
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:01,406
For beauty has great power
to heal the soul.

461
00:41:03,698 --> 00:41:06,406
Then I hope
you find alfirin flowers beautiful.

462
00:41:13,698 --> 00:41:15,364
Until next time, then.

463
00:41:15,448 --> 00:41:16,531
Soldier.

464
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:28,864
Anything to report?

465
00:41:30,156 --> 00:41:31,823
Nothing out of the ordinary.

466
00:41:34,406 --> 00:41:35,614
And the well...

467
00:41:37,031 --> 00:41:38,281
How was it?

468
00:41:39,823 --> 00:41:41,239
Did you draw some water?

469
00:41:42,156 --> 00:41:43,906
We are awaited at Ostirith.

470
00:41:46,031 --> 00:41:48,864
Have you considered
the consequences I might face

471
00:41:48,948 --> 00:41:51,864
if the Watchwarden were to discover
what it is that you're doing?

472
00:41:51,948 --> 00:41:53,614
Afraid I don't take your meaning.

473
00:41:53,698 --> 00:41:55,198
It's difficult enough
keeping watch over them

474
00:41:55,281 --> 00:41:57,364
without having to keep
one eye squarely on you.

475
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:58,698
Or do you think me blind?

476
00:41:58,781 --> 00:42:01,948
No. I think you talk too much.

477
00:42:02,656 --> 00:42:04,573
And you smell of rotten leaves.

478
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:06,156
No, I don't.

479
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:07,406
Yes, you do.

480
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:18,239
My point is this.
Only twice in known history

481
00:42:18,323 --> 00:42:21,448
has a pairing between Elves and humans
even been attempted.

482
00:42:21,531 --> 00:42:24,031
And on each occasion, it ended in tragedy.

483
00:42:24,114 --> 00:42:25,198
It ended in death.

484
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:27,198
You need not remind me.

485
00:42:28,781 --> 00:42:30,364
Then why do you persist?

486
00:42:31,156 --> 00:42:32,864
Give me one reason. One.

487
00:42:32,948 --> 00:42:34,781
Arondir! Médhor!

488
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:39,156
The High King has declared
the days of war are over.

489
00:42:40,614 --> 00:42:43,031
All the far outposts are being disbanded.

490
00:42:44,489 --> 00:42:45,573
We're leaving.

491
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:14,323
-Taking a last look?
-Mm-hmm.

492
00:43:16,448 --> 00:43:18,948
Seventy-nine years
I've been stationed here.

493
00:43:21,073 --> 00:43:23,739
I suppose I've grown accustomed to it.

494
00:43:25,406 --> 00:43:28,948
Can you believe this place
was once a barren scrap of rock?

495
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:31,031
It has changed much, Watchwarden.

496
00:43:31,906 --> 00:43:33,989
But the Men who live here have not.

497
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:38,489
The blood of those who stood with Morgoth
still darkens their veins.

498
00:43:40,906 --> 00:43:42,781
That was long ago, Watchwarden.

499
00:43:47,781 --> 00:43:49,489
What were you before the war?

500
00:43:50,406 --> 00:43:51,531
A grower.

501
00:43:51,614 --> 00:43:54,198
Then you shall be returning home
to far more than you left.

502
00:43:55,364 --> 00:43:58,156
Honors, title.

503
00:43:59,448 --> 00:44:01,114
Your life will begin anew.

504
00:44:02,114 --> 00:44:04,156
But mark this, Arondir,

505
00:44:04,781 --> 00:44:08,364
that for 79 years, you've kept watch
over the men and women of Tirharad,

506
00:44:08,448 --> 00:44:11,364
not because of what their ancestors
once did...

507
00:44:12,823 --> 00:44:14,823
But because of who they still are.

508
00:44:20,364 --> 00:44:21,573
And be grateful.

509
00:44:23,114 --> 00:44:25,281
That you need never see them again.

510
00:45:03,989 --> 00:45:07,114
Careful. That's fire-root powder.
You have to do it slowly.

511
00:45:07,198 --> 00:45:09,281
Go any slower, I'll be stuck here all day.

512
00:45:09,364 --> 00:45:11,239
You're in a boil this morning.

513
00:45:11,323 --> 00:45:13,948
Hardly slept.
Mice were dancing a proper jig

514
00:45:14,031 --> 00:45:16,073
-under the floorboards.
-Again?

515
00:45:16,156 --> 00:45:18,864
Last three nights.
Scratchin' and scrapin'.

516
00:45:22,364 --> 00:45:24,198
What's one of them doing here?

517
00:45:35,198 --> 00:45:36,698
I heard you were leaving.

518
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:38,906
We are.

519
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:43,114
Where's the rest of your company?

520
00:45:44,406 --> 00:45:47,948
Most likely searching for me
at this very moment.

521
00:45:48,656 --> 00:45:50,323
Then why are you at my home?

522
00:46:03,698 --> 00:46:05,531
Say what you wish to say.

523
00:46:05,614 --> 00:46:07,114
I have said it already.

524
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:11,531
A hundred times over,
in every way but words.

525
00:46:13,531 --> 00:46:14,656
-Mother.

526
00:46:16,198 --> 00:46:17,864
There's a man here for you.

527
00:46:26,823 --> 00:46:27,906
Mum.

528
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:33,073
You heal animals, too?

529
00:46:35,114 --> 00:46:37,531
-If you could just give her a look.

530
00:46:38,448 --> 00:46:41,489
She's got some sort of a sickness.

531
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:43,656
What manner of sickness?

532
00:46:50,989 --> 00:46:52,489
It isn't a fever.

533
00:46:54,489 --> 00:46:57,114
And she doesn't appear to have any sores.

534
00:46:58,323 --> 00:46:59,948
Where has she been grazing?

535
00:47:00,031 --> 00:47:01,781
Hmm. She wandered east a few days ago.

536
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:04,489
Think she might have ate something?

537
00:47:09,156 --> 00:47:11,989
What was that, squirted out of her?

538
00:47:13,281 --> 00:47:14,864
How far east?

539
00:47:14,948 --> 00:47:17,323
She might've made it
as far as Hordern.

540
00:47:24,573 --> 00:47:25,781
Where are you going?

541
00:47:25,864 --> 00:47:29,114
Hordern's a day's journey.
If I leave now, I can reach it by dusk.

542
00:47:29,198 --> 00:47:30,531
I'm going with you.

543
00:47:43,031 --> 00:47:44,781
Be quick about it.

544
00:47:44,864 --> 00:47:47,156
He finds us in here,
he'll knock our teeth out.

545
00:47:50,823 --> 00:47:52,948
Only spotted it by mistake.

546
00:47:53,031 --> 00:47:54,323
Stepped on a lucky board.

547
00:47:56,864 --> 00:47:58,031
So, tell me,

548
00:47:59,031 --> 00:48:01,573
is it true? About your mum?

549
00:48:02,531 --> 00:48:03,948
Is what true?

550
00:48:04,656 --> 00:48:08,448
Heard Waldreg caught herself
and one of the pointies

551
00:48:08,573 --> 00:48:11,073
mighty sweet back of his well
the other day.

552
00:48:11,156 --> 00:48:12,281
Who told you that?

553
00:48:12,364 --> 00:48:13,614
Everybody.

554
00:48:14,073 --> 00:48:15,239
It's a lie.

555
00:48:15,781 --> 00:48:18,323
Maybe that's why your father
run off like he done.

556
00:48:18,406 --> 00:48:19,739
My father didn't run off.

557
00:48:19,823 --> 00:48:20,989
Then what happened to him?

558
00:48:21,739 --> 00:48:23,406
You don't even know, do you?

559
00:48:26,948 --> 00:48:29,781
Salty rascal's got the King's bounty
down there.

560
00:48:31,364 --> 00:48:32,864
This is the real bounty.

561
00:48:53,073 --> 00:48:54,073
Watch it!

562
00:48:56,573 --> 00:48:57,656
Go on, quick.

563
00:49:36,489 --> 00:49:38,489
She has passed beyond my sight.

564
00:49:39,698 --> 00:49:42,781
Galadriel was so certain
her search should continue.

565
00:49:44,031 --> 00:49:47,031
We foresaw that if it had,

566
00:49:47,114 --> 00:49:52,489
she might have inadvertently kept alive
the very evil she sought to defeat.

567
00:49:54,531 --> 00:49:57,614
For the same wind
that seeks to blow out a fire

568
00:49:57,698 --> 00:50:00,114
may also cause its spread.

569
00:50:01,948 --> 00:50:03,698
Then the shadow she sought...

570
00:50:06,531 --> 00:50:08,114
You believe it does exist?

571
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:11,364
Set your mind at peace about it.

572
00:50:12,698 --> 00:50:14,239
What you did was right.

573
00:50:14,989 --> 00:50:18,281
For Galadriel and for Middle-earth.

574
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:21,698
It's hard to see what is right...

575
00:50:24,156 --> 00:50:26,364
When friendship and duty are mingled.

576
00:50:28,364 --> 00:50:31,031
Such is the burden of those who lead

577
00:50:31,948 --> 00:50:34,156
and those who would seek to.

578
00:50:35,906 --> 00:50:38,198
Galadriel sails to the sunset.

579
00:50:38,281 --> 00:50:43,114
You and I must look to the new sunrise.

580
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:46,406
To that end,

581
00:50:47,989 --> 00:50:51,573
are you acquainted
with the work of Lord Celebrimbor?

582
00:50:52,614 --> 00:50:54,614
The greatest of Elven-smiths, of course.

583
00:50:55,448 --> 00:50:59,114
I've admired his artistry
since I was a child. Why do you ask?

584
00:50:59,198 --> 00:51:03,948
He is about to embark on a new project.
One of singular importance.

585
00:51:05,031 --> 00:51:08,156
And we've decided
that you will be working with him.

586
00:51:11,114 --> 00:51:14,614
But I'll allow you to explain the details,
Lord Celebrimbor.

587
00:51:30,198 --> 00:51:33,239
First the big people, now the stars.

588
00:51:34,948 --> 00:51:37,281
Eyes open when they should be sleeping.

589
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:42,531
Almost like...

590
00:51:44,156 --> 00:51:46,323
Like they're watching for something.

591
00:51:46,823 --> 00:51:47,906
Watching for what?

592
00:51:48,906 --> 00:51:51,781
A tongue-lashing,
if you don't mind your own cartwheels.

593
00:51:51,864 --> 00:51:53,698
What is it? What do you see?

594
00:51:53,781 --> 00:51:55,989
Elanor Brandyfoot,
with your father's nose,

595
00:51:56,073 --> 00:51:57,906
and always poking it into trouble,

596
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:02,198
you are far too curious and meddlesome
to have been born a Harfoot.

597
00:52:02,281 --> 00:52:04,989
Are you quite certain
you're not part squirrel?

598
00:52:06,406 --> 00:52:09,156
Sadoc. Sadoc, please.

599
00:52:09,948 --> 00:52:11,156
Tell me.

600
00:52:13,906 --> 00:52:16,489
The skies are strange.

601
00:52:18,864 --> 00:52:20,156
Strange.

602
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:21,323
Strange how?

603
00:52:21,406 --> 00:52:23,281
Nori! Do you have that grease?

604
00:52:23,364 --> 00:52:24,614
On my way.

605
00:52:33,364 --> 00:52:35,906
How familiar are you
with the townsfolk of Hordern?

606
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:38,823
Very, I should hope. I was born there.

607
00:52:40,823 --> 00:52:41,989
Why?

608
00:52:42,073 --> 00:52:45,531
The people of Hordern were known
for having been especially strong

609
00:52:45,614 --> 00:52:47,281
in their loyalty to Morgoth.

610
00:52:48,406 --> 00:52:49,823
What did you just say?

611
00:52:53,864 --> 00:52:55,114
The truth.

612
00:52:56,364 --> 00:52:58,364
You're talking about my friends.

613
00:52:58,448 --> 00:53:01,031
Close kin, I know them.
There are good people there.

614
00:53:05,198 --> 00:53:06,989
That is why I'm here with you.

615
00:53:09,448 --> 00:53:11,073
Instead of the Watchwarden.

616
00:53:12,114 --> 00:53:13,364
Bronwyn.

617
00:53:20,073 --> 00:53:23,989
You're the only kind touch
I've known all my days in this land.

618
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:41,781
Hordern.

619
00:56:11,198 --> 00:56:16,864
Do you know why
a ship floats and a stone cannot?

620
00:56:51,906 --> 00:56:53,073
Galadriel.

621
00:57:08,989 --> 00:57:10,406
Give me your hand.

622
00:57:23,156 --> 00:57:26,156
But sometimes
the lights shine just as brightly

623
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:28,906
reflected in the water
as they do in the sky.

624
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:32,406
How am I to know which lights to follow?

625
00:57:34,698 --> 00:57:36,698
Sometimes we cannot know

626
00:57:38,448 --> 00:57:40,448
until we have touched the darkness.

627
00:57:52,073 --> 00:57:53,156
Galadriel!
