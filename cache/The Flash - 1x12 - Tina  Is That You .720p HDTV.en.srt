1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,302
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,304 --> 00:00:06,171
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,840
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

4
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:10,642
- by something impossible.
- Run, Barry, run!

5
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:13,045
My father went to prison
for her murder.

6
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:16,949
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

7
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:18,283
To the outside world,

8
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:19,752
I'm an ordinary
forensics scientist,

9
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:22,688
but secretly,
I use my speed to fight crime

10
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,356
and find others like me.

11
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,657
And one day, I'll find

12
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:27,426
who killed my mother...
Mom!

13
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:29,194
And get justice for my father.

14
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,163
I am... The Flash.

15
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,500
Previously on<i> The Flash...</i>

16
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:36,201
Cisco, if you don't
seal off the blast,

17
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,937
everyone in this building
will die, including Caitlin.

18
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,205
Don't look for me again.

19
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,673
Ronnie's alive,

20
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:44,009
and he's out there,
alone and scared.

21
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:46,045
Hartley Rathaway
Possesses one of the finest

22
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:47,880
scientific minds
I've ever encountered.

23
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:49,481
I can't imagine
how you're gonna feel

24
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,383
when you open up these doors
and let me out of here.

25
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,751
Why would I ever do that?

26
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:55,154
Because I know
where Ronnie Raymond is.

27
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:05,998
Honey... honey...

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,933
Dana.
Oh, God.

29
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:09,234
Someone!

30
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,336
- Help!
- Somebody help us.

31
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:21,080
See if you can get the power
of that line shut down.

32
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:22,881
You guys lay down the hose line.

33
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,284
- Please help!
- Help us!

34
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:26,752
- Help us!

35
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,153
- Hold on!

36
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,694
Stay here, all right?

37
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,162
I gotcha.

38
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,844
Dana!

39
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,989
How did...

40
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,559
I love you.

41
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,963
Thank you,

42
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,965
Flash.

43
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:19,589
<font color="red"> Sync & Correction by facebook.com/ahmedalijarwar</font>

44
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:21,573
Dude.

45
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,175
That was insane.

46
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:25,477
I mean,
even I'm having a hard time

47
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,646
getting mad at you
for dirtying up my suit.

48
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,748
Okay, when are we going to
start considering it my suit?

49
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,284
I'd be comfortable calling it
our suit.

50
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,585
"Our suit."

51
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,921
Tonight was the fastest
you've ever run.

52
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,756
Yes, your training is
paying off.

53
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,259
That couple is alive tonight
because of you.

54
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:42,494
I can still get faster.
I know I can.

55
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,163
And you will one day, I'm sure.

56
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:46,098
But for today,

57
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,000
I'd say you've fulfilled
your save quota.

58
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:51,503
Proper rest is what you need,
as do we all.

59
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,473
Better yet, what we all need is
a proper drink.

60
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:56,008
Who's up for a round?

61
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,743
Oh, dude, it's...
it's movie night with Joe.

62
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,178
I can't.

63
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,346
But I'll see you guys tomorrow,
all right?

64
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,915
- Bye.
- Night.

65
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:03,917
What about you?

66
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:05,350
Drinks on me?

67
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,453
I think I'll pass.

68
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:11,657
You okay?

69
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:14,493
I was looking for my tablet
at your work station,

70
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:16,295
and I found this.

71
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:17,829
I can explain.

72
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,965
I know you said we should
stop looking for Ronnie,

73
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,466
so I...

74
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,168
didn't stop looking for Ronnie.

75
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,469
Why?

76
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:25,871
Hartley.
He said he knew

77
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,306
what happened to Ronnie.

78
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:29,041
Oh, Hartley Rathaway,

79
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,343
who is currently locked up in
our super-villain basement jail

80
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:32,711
for going psycho
with sound waves?

81
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,213
Yeah.
He's made some poor choices.

82
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:35,581
There's no argument there.

83
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,049
But I looked into
what he was saying and...

84
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,650
Cisco.
Ronnie's gone,

85
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:41,253
and it's time for me to
move on with my life.

86
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,291
Doesn't seem like it.

87
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,460
What's that supposed to mean?

88
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:51,697
Look, I'm not an expert
on love,

89
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:55,867
but I think in order to
move on from Ronnie,

90
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:58,870
you actually have to move on.

Hey.

120
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:46,611
The security cameras in
half the prison are shut down.

121
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:49,348
Then Clay Parker,
according to this data log,

122
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,782
who was still
locked in his cell,

123
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,651
somehow vanishes.

124
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:55,654
Not completely.

125
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,322
What's that?

126
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,858
It's some kind of
organic particulate residual.

127
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,593
I found it on the floor
in here,

128
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:02,828
just outside the cell,

129
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,563
out in the hallway.

130
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,898
Trail led me
all the way outside.

131
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,703
Dad.

132
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,450
So...

133
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:26,818
Word around here is,

134
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,653
Parker pulled a Shawshank?

135
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,522
Yep, and none of
the other prisoners

136
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,924
heard or saw anything.

137
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:36,027
Well, they wouldn't talk to you
about it.

138
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,997
Leaves us with
not a lot to go on.

139
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,599
Well, if there's anyone
who can figure out

140
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,667
how Parker got out of here,

141
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,536
it's you, Son.

142
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,371
Come on, Allen, let's go.

143
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,373
Duty calls.

144
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,819
So, my dad just happened
to come by?

145
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:04,222
The guard owed me a favor.

146
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:06,224
Thank you.

147
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:15,000
Thanks for...

148
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:17,335
getting me
out of that hellhole.

149
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,304
You'd have done the same
for me, right?

150
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:22,674
So...

151
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,476
How the hell did this
happen to you?

152
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,344
Don't know.

153
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,981
After you got locked up,
I started not feeling right.

154
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,516
I was passing out for
no reason,

155
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:33,618
waking up in odd places.

156
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,389
It took me a while before
I could control it.

157
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:39,291
Soon as I could...

158
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,728
I came for you.

159
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,131
What, so you can just

160
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,599
jump wherever you want?

161
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,267
If I can see where
I'm going.

162
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,603
We got a second chance, Clay.

163
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:52,904
We can leave Central City.

164
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:57,909
Do... do all the things
we talked about.

165
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:01,346
I can't leave yet, baby.

166
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:04,249
I owe Marcus a lot of money.

167
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,218
I skipped town
before paying him back.

168
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,220
He'll find us.

169
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:11,323
Hey, but with what you can do,

170
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:14,726
we can pay off that debt.

171
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:18,797
Then we'll be free, and
we can go anywhere in the world.

172
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:21,366
Together.

173
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,875
Not even Barry's cells
move this fast.

174
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:31,743
I've never seen
anything like it.

175
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,712
So Clay Parker is a meta-human?

176
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,080
Not so fast.

177
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,816
The particulate residue
Barry gathered

178
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:40,185
at Iron Heights does contain
Clay Parker's DNA,

179
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,854
but also DNA of a woman.

180
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,056
Run her DNA against
the CCPD criminal database.

181
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:48,059
See if you get a match.

182
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,464
Yahtzee.

183
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:53,999
Her name's Shawna Baez.

184
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,467
Mostly petty crimes,

185
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:57,869
and this girl likes to party,
apparently.

186
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,405
Long list of disorderly conducts
at local bars.

187
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,541
So I'm guessing we find her,
we find Clay Parker.

188
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,209
- Barry?
- Yeah.

189
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,644
In the meantime,
let's track these particulates

190
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:08,813
and see how they work.

191
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,815
I'll be right with you guys.

192
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:20,125
I've had the biggest craving
for Thai food.

193
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,627
You said you knew
what happened to Ronnie

194
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,629
and how he was still alive.

195
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,599
And you said Professor Stein
was at S.T.A.R. Labs

196
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,100
the night of the explosion.

197
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:32,404
Yes.
He was.

198
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,239
Why?

199
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:43,048
The mystery isn't why Stein went
to S.T.A.R. Labs that night.

200
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,351
It's why he didn't leave.

201
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:47,919
Tell me.

202
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,754
Can't.
I have to show you.

203
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,559
You are not getting out
of this cell.

204
00:09:56,562 --> 00:10:00,031
Fair enough,
but I know you, Cisco.

205
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,633
I know how much
you looked up to Ronnie.

206
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:03,468
He was like family.

207
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,372
A family
you built for yourself here.

208
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:10,041
I know how much you want
to see that family healed.

209
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,643
Let me help you.

210
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:15,146
I don't believe you.

211
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:18,049
Well, I'm telling you
the truth, Cisco.

212
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:21,953
When you are ready,
you know where to find me.

213
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,572
What's that smile about?

214
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:42,807
I saw my dad today.

215
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,109
No glass, no phones.

216
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,710
Just me and him, face-to-face.

217
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:46,811
Joe arranged it.

218
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,713
That must have been amazing,
Barry.

219
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,915
Yeah.
I really needed it.

220
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,518
I'm sure he needed it, too.

221
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,521
Were you there
investigating the breakout?

222
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,024
- Mm-hmm.
- That is a big story.

223
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:01,192
Which I am not a part of.

224
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:04,362
My editor wants me writing about
The Flash, and only The Flash.

225
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:05,764
Is that a bad thing?

226
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,165
I don't know.
I would just like

227
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,434
to be thought of
as more than The Flash PR flack.

228
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,936
I mean,
if I don't write something soon,

229
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:13,338
I think I might lose my job.

230
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,806
Hey, no.

231
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,042
We will find you
a great story to write about.

232
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:18,176
Together.

233
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,678
Okay?

234
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,314
You know
I'm always here for you.

235
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,316
I know.

236
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,125
Didn't know you enjoyed yourself
a little rough trade.

237
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,261
If I'm gonna let you out,

238
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:40,765
I'm not taking any chances.

239
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,768
Curiosity's a maddening thing,
is it not?

240
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,341
What do you mean
you've been asking around?

241
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:53,144
Do you know
a Marcus Stockheimer?

242
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,981
Sure,
he's some mid-level gangster.

243
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,650
He works mainly on
the south side.

244
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:01,352
Word is, Clay Parker was
a runner for Marcus.

245
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:04,222
When Clay got pinched,
Marcus lost a lot of money.

246
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,658
Apparently Marcus doesn't like
losing money.

247
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,426
So, what?
So Parker can't leave

248
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,395
Central City
until he's paid off his debt?

249
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,996
From what I'm told,

250
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,531
if you're a member of
the Stockheimer crew,

251
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,833
you get out,

252
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,501
first thing you do is
pay him a visit

253
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:19,704
or suffer the consequences.

254
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,239
All right.

255
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,908
No more playing cop.

256
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,443
Promise me.

257
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:28,413
I hear you.

258
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,681
All right.

259
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,056
You said you were gonna show me
what happened to Ronnie.

260
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:40,058
Ronnie died inside the building.

261
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,993
What are we doing out here?

262
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:44,829
What do you see?

263
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,498
I don't know.

264
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,702
Buildings, walls, dirt.

265
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:53,538
Wells would be so disappointed
in your observational skills.

266
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,541
Look again.

267
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,949
It's Japanese.

268
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,484
How can you speak six languages

269
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:08,887
and sound like a dick
in every one of them?

270
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,989
It means "bomb shadow."

271
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:12,824
They found these
all over Hiroshima

272
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:15,560
after the first atomic bomb
was dropped.

273
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:20,598
This shadow belonged to
Martin Stein.

274
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,135
The accelerator explosion
did this to him?

275
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,837
You really don't see it,
do you?

276
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,306
You're gonna kick yourself
when you figure it out.

277
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,276
Oh, man.

278
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,945
You were full of it then,
and you're full of it now.

279
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:35,814
This is just another one of
your lame-ass tricks.

280
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,081
Come on.

281
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,918
We're going back
into the Pipeline.

282
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,219
Oh!

283
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,656
Aah!

284
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:58,369
Aah!

285
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:01,172
You're not the only one who
understands vibrations, Hartley.

286
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,074
Those cochlear devises
you're wearing?

287
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,576
I made a few adjustments.

288
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:06,744
No, please don't!

289
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,046
Aah.

290
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,814
If you know how to find Ronnie,

291
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,516
then you better tell me.

292
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,550
Right now.

293
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:13,685
Please, make it stop.

294
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:14,687
Please.
I'll show you.

295
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,487
I'll show...
ah... aah!

296
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,157
Try that again,

297
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,459
and I won't make it stop.

298
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,694
Ever.

299
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,062
I'm impressed.

300
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:28,199
Didn't think
you had that in you.

301
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,568
But you have to
take these off me

302
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,037
if you want to
find out the truth.

303
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,973
And why's that?

304
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:37,976
It'll look a little conspicuous
where we're going next.

305
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,048
Mm.
I was analyzing the particulates

306
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,284
that Clay Parker and Shawna Baez
left behind,

307
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,052
and I found
something very interesting.

308
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,989
When Clay's cells come into
contact with Shawna's,

309
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,992
they adopt her properties.

310
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,663
Something bothering you?

311
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,398
Why would you ask that?

312
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,600
You're doing that
biting-your-lower-lip thing

313
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,636
that you do
when something's bothering you.

314
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:06,237
I'm fine.

315
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,139
Okay.

316
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:11,442
Cisco says
I don't have a life.

317
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,144
You don't, do you?

318
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,279
I do!

319
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,447
I cook and I eat

320
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,750
and I read

321
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,418
and I help you.

322
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,187
So, what you're saying is,
you do everything

323
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,590
that has nothing to do with
having a life.

324
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,625
You don't have to be
rude about it.

325
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,527
Hey, I'm not doing any better

326
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:32,130
than you.
My social life consists of

327
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:34,465
running at superhuman speed
and Netflix.

328
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,868
We are quite the pair,
Mr. Allen.

329
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,636
Yes we are, Dr. Snow.

330
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,573
There's an armed robbery
in progress.

331
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,642
Two suspects,
male and female in their 20s.

332
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,911
Sounds like our meta-human
Bonnie and Clyde are

333
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:47,979
at it again.

334
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,881
Time to ruin
their social life.

335
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:00,358
Just a few bags, baby,
is enough to pay back Marcus.

336
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:05,029
These things are heavier
than they look.

337
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,942
Oh, I've read about you.

338
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,445
You're The Flash.

339
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:24,215
I've heard you're real fast.

340
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,817
Let's see if it's true.

341
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,821
Catch me if you can.

342
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:30,922
I can.

343
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,661
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

344
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:45,269
Not too many men can
keep up with me.

345
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,268
This is a bullet wound.

346
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,103
You're lucky it just barely
broke the skin.

347
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:23,708
Guess I'm a lot faster than
a speeding bullet.

348
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,610
Shawna Baez.

349
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,745
She can teleport.

350
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,781
As in, "Beam me up, Shawna?"

351
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:31,416
Yes, of course.

352
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:33,184
Quantum entanglement.

353
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,720
The ability to manipulate
interconnected particles

354
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,655
over an infinite distance.

355
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,223
Or, as Einstein put it,

356
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,325
"spooky action at a distance."

357
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,327
Every time I got close,
she'd disappear.

358
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,897
It was like we were playing
a game of...

359
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,398
Peek-a-boo.

360
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,734
Come on.
Can't I name one?

361
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,102
How am I supposed to catch her

362
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,770
if I don't know
where she's gonna be?

363
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,539
Everybody has limits,
Mr. Allen.

364
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,607
Now that we know
Shawna's powers,

365
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,910
we'll focus on those limits.

366
00:17:58,912 --> 00:17:59,944
All right.

367
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,279
Let me know.

368
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,413
I'm gonna change.

369
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,015
I gotta go help Iris.

370
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,490
Hey, Barry.

371
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:13,925
- Hey, Eddie.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

372
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,393
I thought I'd see if
you wanted help

373
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:16,761
writing your story
for the paper.

374
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,230
Oh, that is so sweet.
I would love to,

375
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:21,732
but we were about to have dinner
with Eddie's mom tonight.

376
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,101
And we're late.

377
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,669
Can we do it another time?

378
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,137
Yeah, yeah... yeah.

379
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:27,171
Okay.

380
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:28,439
- All right.
- Bye.

381
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,074
- See ya.
- Bye.

382
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,421
Hey.

383
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:47,291
What bars did
Shawna and Clay frequent?

384
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,727
Uh, mostly south side
dive bars.

385
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:50,795
Why?

386
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,964
I was just gonna check 'em out.

387
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,666
See if they fall into
any old habits.

388
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,835
That's a good idea.

389
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,470
I'll join you.

Hey.

395
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,055
What?

396
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:19,190
What?
Nothing.

397
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:21,058
Uh, well, you look...

398
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,528
really nice.

399
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:27,331
I don't always dress like
a high school principal.

400
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,866
So, this is where

401
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,735
Shawna Baez and Clay Parker
used to hang out?

402
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,870
It is,
according to the files.

403
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:35,740
I thought we could
kill two birds with one stone.

404
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:39,177
Look for them and
get ourselves back out there.

405
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,649
I keep making
the same mistake.

406
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:47,385
Every time Iris falls,
I race to pick her up

407
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:50,521
thinking that one of these times
things are gonna change,

408
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,557
but I... things are never
gonna change.

409
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,794
I am just destined to be
just the friend.

410
00:19:56,796 --> 00:20:00,298
At least you're not pining for
someone who bursts into flames

411
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:05,203
and wants nothing
to do with you.

412
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,671
What is wrong with us?

413
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,172
I mean, we're in our 20s.

414
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,241
We should be having fun.

415
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:11,243
We should meet people,

416
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:13,044
go on lots of dates.

417
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,313
Well,
here's to liquid courage.

418
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:18,249
♪ Everybody's working for
The weekend ♪

419
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:22,853
Uh... that is... very fast.

420
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,622
Drank all of it.

421
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:25,890
Excuse me?

422
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,459
I would like to start a tab.

423
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,634
CCPD confiscated everything
from S.T.A.R. Labs

424
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:37,902
after the explosion.

425
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,904
Video, audio,
traffic cam footage.

426
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,572
Okay, so?

427
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,208
I saw Martin Stein the night
S.T.A.R. Labs went boom.

428
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,911
He walked right past me.

429
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:50,881
You see, Stein specialized in
transmutation.

430
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,350
Molecular transmography.

431
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,218
Quantum splicing.

432
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,389
Taking two things
and making them one.

433
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:01,392
Let's go to the videotape,
shall we?

434
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,196
Okay, stop.

435
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:07,198
Now zoom in a few clicks.

436
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,569
Now advance it,
frame-by-frame.

437
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,442
His eyes.

438
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:22,079
They turned white,
just like Ronnie's.

439
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:23,314
Now, stop there.

440
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,149
In the mass of energy.

441
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,251
- Looks like...
- Ronnie.

442
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:29,887
And Professor Stein.

443
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:32,923
The dark matter
merged them together.

444
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:36,527
Explains why Ronnie hasn't
seemed quite himself lately.

445
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:39,730
It's because he's not.

446
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,766
He's Martin Stein.

447
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:44,468
Aah!

448
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:50,041
You can't say I didn't keep up
my end of the bargain.

449
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,251
I figure that makes us
even Stephen.

450
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:01,519
Adios.

451
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:05,690
Excuse me,
could I get some water?

452
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:07,291
Yo.

453
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,093
Excuse me?

454
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:12,096
- For real?
- Mr. Barry Allen!

455
00:22:12,098 --> 00:22:13,831
Come on down!

456
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,832
- Or up.
- I'm not doing it.

457
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:15,966
Come up here with me.

458
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:17,601
Oh, come show 'em what you got.

459
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:18,803

466

Okay.

484
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:29,173
Can I close out my tab,
please?

485
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:31,008
Hey, Stevie.

486
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,610

487
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:33,778
Sure thing, Linda.

00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:50,995
Sorry about us up there.

494
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,029
That's...

495
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,597
Are you kidding?

496
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,766
No, that was some of
the best singing that I've heard

497
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,268
come from that stage.

498
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,936
You definitely
made my ears happy.

499
00:23:58,938 --> 00:23:59,938
Don't worry.

500
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:03,507
Thanks.

501
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:07,645
So... was that
your girlfriend up there?

502
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:10,114
Oh... no, no.

503
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,582
She's a friend.

504
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:13,417
Okay.

505
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,391
Hey. Have you heard of
this new phone app?

506
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:21,992
It's so cool.

507
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:24,261
Check it out.
You just touch someone's phone

508
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:26,063
with your phone,
and it automatically

509
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:27,765
downloads your contact info.

510
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:28,933
Wow.

511
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:30,901
That is cool.

512
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:34,305
See?
You have my number.

513
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:41,278
What you do with it now is
up to you.

514
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,981
Okay.

515
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,082
- Barry?
- Yeah?

516
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,450
I don't feel good.

517
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:48,886
Okay.
Come on.

518
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,491
Okay?

519
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:01,866
80 grand.

520
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:03,734
What I owe.

521
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,339
So we square now?

522
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:10,341
Almost.

523
00:25:21,454 --> 00:25:22,820
Ohh.

524
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:25,322
Holy crap.

525
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:27,191
I'm glad you're impressed.

526
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,726
So we cool now?

527
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:30,160
Absolutely.

528
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:33,330
Couldn't be cooler.

529
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:37,902
Which is why I think we need to
keep working together.

530
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:40,504
With what I know,

531
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:42,506
and what you can do,

532
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:47,511
oh, we can be looking at
a very lucrative future.

533
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,684
Police!
Everybody down!

534
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,428
Aah!

535
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,363
- Oh, baby!

536
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,100
Hold it right there.

537
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,208
Damn.

538
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,088
Are we still running?

539
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,724
No, we are here.

540
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:35,459
Vodka and super-speed...

541
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:37,027
not a good combination.

542
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,363
Come on.

543
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:42,199
So, are you gonna call her?

544
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,134
Who?

545
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,569
That girl.

546
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:47,938
The one who gave you
her number.

547
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,941
I hadn't really
thought about it.

548
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,776
Yes, you have.

549
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,446
But I know you.
You won't.

550
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,715
You'll let her slip
right through your fingers

551
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:01,085
because you think
you don't deserve happiness.

552
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:06,824
But what you don't realize is,
you need a little saving, too.

553
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:10,194
Little help, please.

554
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:13,597
W... yeah.
Okay.

555
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:17,167
There you go again.

556
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:19,103
Saving me from that
evil dress.

557
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:20,471
Get in bed.

558
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:22,339
Did you sneak a peek?

559
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:24,808
At my goods?

560
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,278
I wouldn't be much of a hero
if I did.

561
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,181
Yeah, but it's okay
if you peeked a little.

562
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:35,919
You deserve a peek for
all the good stuff you do.

563
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:38,122
Drink lots of water.

564
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:40,290
Thank you for tonight.

565
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,693
I sang.

566
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:45,496
Any time.

567
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,131
Hey, Barry?

568
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:50,467
Will you stay with me
until I fall asleep?

569
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:53,470
Sure, yeah.

570
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,251
Hi.

571
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:08,819
So loud.

572
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:10,654
Oh, ho-ho.

573
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:13,023
I just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

574
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:17,327
Let's just say I envy
your inability to get drunk.

575
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:19,329
I don't remember
much from last night.

576
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:23,333
Yeah,
that's probably for the best.

577
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:25,035
♪ Summer lovin' ♪

578
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,170
Oh, God.
That I do remember.

579
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,511
What's wrong?

580
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:39,216
Cisco... has something
he needs to tell you.

581
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,751
Hartley's gone.

582
00:28:40,753 --> 00:28:42,653
He escaped
from the Pipeline?

583
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:46,523
How is that even possible?

584
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:48,726
I let him out.

585
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,160
Are you mad?

586
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:52,096
I can't tell with
those glasses on.

587
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:53,997
I'd like to yell
and wave my arms,

588
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,899
but I'm afraid I'd throw up.

589
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,167
Why?
What were you thinking?

590
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:58,569
You know how dangerous he is.

591
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:00,738
Hartley said he knew
what happened to Ronnie.

592
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,406
I told you to let it go.

593
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,174
I didn't want you
looking into that for me.

594
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:05,442
I wasn't doing it for you.

595
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:06,444
I...

596
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:14,618
I sealed Ronnie into the
accelerator before it blew.

597
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,754
He told me to wait
two minutes,

598
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:21,725
and I waited,
but he didn't come back.

599
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:23,627
And I can't stop thinking,

600
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:28,332
10, 20 seconds and...

601
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:31,935
Ronnie wouldn't be like
he is right now.

602
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,938
I've wanted to tell you
so many times.

603
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,310
I'm so sorry.

604
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:43,313
So you carried that around
this whole time?

605
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:52,122
Do you know what
Ronnie would say if he was here?

606
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:55,125
He would say that
you did the right thing.

607
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,794
It wasn't your fault.

608
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:59,797
What happened that night
wasn't anybody's fault.

609
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,736
Come on.

610
00:30:05,738 --> 00:30:08,572
Don't we have
a teleporter to catch?

611
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:11,341
We do have
a teleporter to catch.

612
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:15,913
And fortunately,
we do have a promising theory.

613
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:18,582
Take a look at this.

614
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:21,819
Now, this is the normal behavior

615
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:24,555
of the particulate
that Shawna left behind.

616
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:29,793
Watch what happens
when we remove light.

617
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:32,830
Shawna can only become entangled
with something she can see.

618
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,731
Take away her ability
to do that...

619
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:35,966
She can't teleport.

620
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:37,901
Exactly.

621
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,903
So, we just need to get her
into a dark space.

622
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:42,573
How do we do that?

623
00:30:42,575 --> 00:30:44,141
It's a valid question.

624
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:46,143
Hello?

625
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:48,512
What?

626
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:49,646
Yeah, I'll be right there.

627
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:51,081
All right.

628
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:54,484
What's wrong?

629
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:55,652
M-my dad.

630
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:57,421
He's been stabbed.

631
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:07,564
Dad... what happened?

632
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:11,134
A rather stern reminder,
I'd say,

633
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:13,837
not to poke around
Marcus Stockheimer's business.

634
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,374
Dad, I told you to stop.

635
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,310
Your dad called me
with more intel.

636
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:24,548
It helped us track down Clay and
Shawna and arrest Stockheimer.

637
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,218
I managed to screw up
Marcus's big heist, too, so...

638
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,554
You two kept working together,
and you didn't tell me?

639
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,322
It isn't his fault.

640
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:34,491
I did it to help you.

641
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:39,363
You getting stabbed and beaten
is not helping me.

642
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:42,232
Look, I-I-I-I don't get to

643
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:47,137
feel useful very much in here.

644
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:49,172
So if I can help you
for a change,

645
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:51,975
I'm gonna want to
be there for you.

646
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:54,978
Just like you've been there
for me all these years.

647
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,452
Yep.

648
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:07,057
You said Marcus had
a big heist coming up?

649
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:08,392
Mm.

650
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:09,893
Do you know anything else
about it?

651
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:11,728
Dad, tell me
who did this to you.

652
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,930
No, it doesn't matter,
slugger.

653
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,398
But you said
you want to help me.

654
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,068
So help me.

655
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,537
One of Marcus's boys.

656
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:22,539
Julius.

657
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,353
What the hell?

658
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:39,356
Evening, Julius.

659
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:40,958
How'd I get out here?

660
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,359
You escaped.

661
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:44,361
They catch me trying to escape,

662
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:47,030
they're gonna add five years
to my sentence.

663
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:48,765
Ten, actually.

664
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:50,267
Unless you tell me where

665
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:51,935
Marcus Stockheimer's next
job is gonna be.

666
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:56,206
Oh! Guards will be here
any second.

667
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:57,441
I'd start blabbing.

668
00:32:57,443 --> 00:32:59,543
Okay!

669
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:00,911
Okay.

670
00:33:00,913 --> 00:33:03,313
It's a TDK
and money transfer truck

671
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,949
coming from the federal reserve
bank in St. Louis.

672
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:08,251
Supposed to be millions.

673
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:10,020
Delivery's around 8:00.

674
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:11,621
That's all I know.
I swear.

675
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:13,023
That's right now.

676
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:16,461
Hey!

677
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:18,462
Hey, what about me?

678
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,040
I think we got company.

679
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:34,811
What the...

680
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,753
Okay.

681
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:44,755
Let's go.

682
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,335
I got this.

683
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,506
Why the hell
do you care what we do?

684
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:04,107
Are you a cop or something?

685
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:05,942
Something.

686
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,233
Come on!

687
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,388
Barry, remember: she cannot
teleport if she cannot see.

688
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:52,823
Limit her field of vision.

689
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,637
No.

690
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,925
He left me.

691
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,843
Is there any way she can
teleport out of this?

692
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:48,311
It's impossible.

693
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,346
It's one-way glass.

694
00:35:49,348 --> 00:35:51,281
It's mirrored on the inside.

695
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:54,284
No one dangerous is ever gonna
get out of this thing again.

696
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:01,725
Shawna.

697
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:03,293
Clay left you.

698
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:05,495
He's out there,
and you're in here.

699
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,899
You know what
the crazy thing is?

700
00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:10,400
I still love him.

701
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,575
Cisco.

702
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,184
Crazy is right.

703
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:31,354
Some people are worth
being crazy for.

704
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:35,392
I'm sorry if I was a bit of
a drunken mess the other night.

705
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:37,060
Actually, it was pretty fun.

706
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:39,529
Yeah, it was.

707
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,731
You know what?

708
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:44,234
I think everybody's been right
about you and me.

709
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:48,672
Both of us have been hung up
on people for way too long.

710
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:50,574
If what Cisco says is true,

711
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:53,910
that Ronnie merged
with Martin Stein,

712
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:58,682
then he's not alive anymore.

713
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:00,684
Time for me to move on.

714
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:03,753
Find someone new
to be crazy about.

715
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:12,629
All right, well.

716
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:13,763
I'll see you tomorrow.

717
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:15,599
Yes, sure.

718
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:16,601
Bye.

719
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:18,034
Bye.

720
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,551
That's for you.

721
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:36,119
I thought maybe
you could help me out,

722
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:38,121
if you're willing.

723
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,026
This is about
the breakout at Iron Heights.

724
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:45,395
Clay Parker.
He's still on the loose,

725
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:46,963
and we need to catch him.

726
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:49,566
Why are you giving this to me?

727
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:52,636
'Cause you're a good reporter.

728
00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:54,638
And the only one I know.

729
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:01,878
You're not the only one
who's fast.

730
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,950
Hey, what are you doing here?

731
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,118
- Hey.
- If you came to check on me,

732
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,452
that is really sweet,

733
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:12,255
but I think
everything's gonna be okay.

734
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:14,157
I'm glad.
Uh...

735
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,793
I actually am not here
to see you.

736
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,328
No?

737
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,530
No, I have a lunch date.

738
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:22,432
With who?

739
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:24,100
- Ready.
- Hey.

740
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:26,536
Oh, hey,
you're our new stringer, right?

741
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:27,704
Yeah.

742
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:29,472
I'm Linda Park.
Sports.

743
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,441
Iris West.

744
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:34,444
How did you two meet?

745
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:36,112
Well, it's actually
kind of a funny story.

746
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:37,113
Yeah, I'll tell you later,
all right?

747
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:38,115
- You ready?
- Yeah.

748
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:39,649
- Okay.
- See ya.

749
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,484
Have fun.

750
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:48,258
So an actual date this time.

751
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,627
Good for you.

752
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:54,431
You didn't tell her
your dad's in the slammer?

753
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:57,767
No, I read in a magazine that
that's a big turnoff.

754
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:58,769
Smart.

755
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,173
Hey.

756
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:05,275
You see this?

757
00:39:05,277 --> 00:39:06,576
No.

758
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:08,611
I haven't.

759
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:12,682
The Flash.

760
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,351
I saw him once.

761
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:16,986
In here.

762
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:19,556
Watched him save
Joe's life.

763
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:20,590
Joe told me about that.

764
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:21,758
I guess he was lucky.

765
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,226
Hm.

766
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:25,228
Lucky Joe.

767
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:29,499
The strangest thing.

768
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:31,935
I get roughed up by Julius,
end up in here.

769
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:34,371
Next thing I know, Julius is
caught trying to escape,

770
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:36,740
claims The Flash
broke him out.

771
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:41,878
Won't be seeing Julius for
a long time now.

772
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:47,050
Guess I'm lucky too, huh?

773
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,753
Dad.

774
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:52,922
If I was The Flash,

775
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:56,993
don't you think that you'd be
the first to know about it?

776
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:58,395
Yeah.

777
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,401
Well, if The Flash were my son,
I'd tell him a few things.

778
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:06,503
First off, I'd tell him
it's a dangerous world,

779
00:40:06,505 --> 00:40:08,505
so be careful.

780
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:14,010
Then I'd tell him he's a hero.

781
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:17,213
And he's saving a lot of lives.

782
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:22,986
But the most important thing
for him to know, I feel,

783
00:40:22,988 --> 00:40:25,989
is that
his father's proud of him.

784
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:41,237
Power grid's been going haywire
in this sector.

785
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:43,006
The system's so antiquated.

786
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:13,236
Whoa.

787
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:14,838
What was that?

788
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:42,765
Aah!

789
00:41:50,976 --> 00:41:52,408
Aah!

790
