- Me too.

326
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:37,099
Look, Thawne did this
to himself,

327
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:38,970
and it's not like
we can save him,

328
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:41,364
so it's time to let him go.

329
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:44,976
- Look, I know
that we're the new kids

330
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,109
and we don't have
the same history with Thawne,

331
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:48,241
but that's a good thing,

332
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:50,373
because I don't care

You are the new kids.

And so when it comes to Thawne,
I'm sorry,

338
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,954
but you don't get a say.

think about this.

341

- We already have.

342
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:14,702
- You guys don't understand
what Thawne's capable of.

343
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:18,575
It's time to keep everyone safe
by finally letting Thawne die.

Now.

346
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:28,150

347

with you two?

348

Since when do we
let people die?

349

- Dad, you know who Thawne is.
- Yeah, I do.

350
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:39,509
And that man came to you
for help,

351
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:42,077
which means you're obligated
to try and save him.

352
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,209
- Joe, he killed you.

353

No, I know you don't remember,
but I do.

354
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:47,126
If we don't let
this happen now,

355
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:48,431
our family will never be safe.

356
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:50,912

to see him dead either?

'Cause I do.

358

If I learned one thing
being a cop,

359

it's that

even try to think
of a way to save him?

doesn't wipe us out first.

to stop Despero long enough
for Chuck to do his thing,

531

so come on.

We're Team Flash.

00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,969
What can we do?

534
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:31,405
- The energy
Despero's harnessing

535
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:33,320
is from his home world,
Kalanor,

536
00:28:33,363 --> 00:28:35,975
but, I mean, even if
the energy's alien,

537
00:28:36,018 --> 00:28:38,455
the flame of Py'tar
is still a flame.

538
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:40,762
- You can harness it
with a vacuum.

539
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:42,198
- And then disperse it,

540
00:28:42,242 --> 00:28:44,200
but I--I'd still
need a way to direct

541
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:46,159
all that energy
into the atmosphere.

542
00:28:46,202 --> 00:28:48,552
- Wait, if a delivery system
is what you need,

543
00:28:48,596 --> 00:28:49,989
then I got the ticket.

00:28:50,032 --> 00:28:52,252
Okay, so you know how
the P.E.D. redirects energy?
