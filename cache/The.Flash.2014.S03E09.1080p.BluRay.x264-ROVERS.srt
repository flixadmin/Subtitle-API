1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,286
BARRY: <i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,166
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,920
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,163
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,767
<i>After defeating Zoom
and saving the multi-verse,</i>

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,447
<i>I ran back in time and created
the alternate timeline, Flashpoint.</i>

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,250
<i>I restored the timeline to how it was,</i>

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,448
<i>only to find things weren't
as I left them.</i>

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,489
<i>I brought new threats to our world.</i>

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,802
<i>And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,929
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,405
JOE: <i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,921
They don't see your potential, I do.

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,804
You wanna train? I'll train you.

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,730
JULIAN: <i>You're Allen's friend?
Doctor Snow?</i>

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,770
I'm begging you, don't turn her in.
I will do anything you want.

17
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,440
Tender your resignation,
effective immediately.

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,962
It's a story.
Used to be written by Iris West-Allen.

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,485
Something's changed with our future.

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,846
God, What did I do?

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,447
My brother's dead. I will never make
another memory with Dante again.

22
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,962
You are only a man, Flash,
but I am a god.

23
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,970
I am Savitar.

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,770
Now we know Alchemy is just the lackey.

25
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,289
Julian, become my servant once more.

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,728
<i>Become Alchemy.</i>

27
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,169
JULIAN: <i>It's been six months
since I arrived here in India.</i>

28
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,848
<i>Though I have faith it's out there,</i>

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,688
<i>the voice that once drove me has waned.</i>

30
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,561
<i>And I fear my quest may be for naught.</i>

31
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,089
Julian, come quick.

32
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,760
I think We found it.

33
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,205
What's that?

34
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,203
This is it. Here, hold this.

35
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,167
This is it. I can feel it.

36
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,847
I think we should wait before we open it.

37
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,087
No.

38
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,731
It needs to be set free.

39
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,370
Holy winter wonderland.

40
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,568
Took the words right out of my mouth.

41
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,327
Well, I guess Earth-19's Christmas
is just like ours.

42
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,608
Some traditions are multi-versal.

43
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,206
So, um...

44
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,926
- Any more info on Savitar?
- Nope.

45
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,323
All we know is that he's a speed god
and you're the only one who can see him.

46
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,610
All right, well,
Alchemy is Savitar's high priest.

47
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,081
And he gets his power from the stone
that he uses to create metas,

48
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,480
so I was thinking,

49
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,484
if we can find out what that thing is,
maybe we can figure out how to stop him.

50
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,449
I wanna see if I can dig something up.

51
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,641
Okay.

52
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,563
I know this is our first Christmas
together as a couple,

53
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,563
and I want everything to be perfect,
but...

54
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,680
You need to get to this.
Yes, no, I totally get it.

55
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,726
Hey, I got a dissertation here
from Oxford University,

56
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,443
about the myth of an ancient Hindu weapon
called the Brahmastra?

57
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,764
Legendary artifact with incredible powers.

58
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,248
Capable of, wait for it...

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,651
- Creating metas.
- Creating meta-humans.

60
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,484
Guys, that looks
just like Alchemy's stone.

61
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,609
More importantly...

62
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,962
Look who wrote this paper.

63
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,966
Julian?

64
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,369
Love what you've done
with the place.

65
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,321
Ah, Allen.

66
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,801
Thought we had a deal.

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,482
I keep your frosty friend's secret and you
never darken these doors again, remember?

68
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,850
I just need some information from you
about that stone that Alchemy uses.

69
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,650
And you've come to me because...

70
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,450
Apparently, you know a lot about it.

71
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,286
Well, why don't you tell me
everything you know.

72
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,204
Then you'll never hear from me again.

73
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,160
Fine.

74
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,370
Many years ago,
I heard about the Brahmastra,

75
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,611
or as it's colloquially called,
"The Philosopher's Stone."

76
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,205
It is said to be the first object
to give human beings powers.

77
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,930
Like the particle accelerator.

78
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,123
Over the years, it got lost.

79
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,641
I became quite obsessed
with trying to find it.

80
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,207
Did every piece of available research
I could,

81
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,203
and much to my parents' dismay,

82
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,888
I used my future inheritance and funded
an expedition to try and find it.

83
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,206
But we never found it.

84
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,201
Pretty soon after that, I came here.

85
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,881
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

86
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,210
In your research, have you ever
come across the name "Savitar"?

87
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,884
How do you know that name?

88
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,724
I've done some research of my own.

89
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,044
As far as I know,
Savitar is the first meta with speed.

90
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,362
That is all I know, Allen.

91
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,486
And I suggest
that you don't waste your time on this.

92
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,566
Move on.

93
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,361
All right.

94
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,571
SAVITAR: <i>Julian.</i>

95
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,840
Here you go.

96
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,169
One whiff of aliens
and all the crazies come out.

97
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,886
I'm gonna be buried under these
alien files until next Christmas.

98
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,522
Well, if by some Christmas miracle,
you dig yourself out sooner,

99
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,447
we do it up at the West house
on Christmas Eve.

100
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,286
Turkey, tree, Grandma Esther's eggnog,

101
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,442
the whole shebang,
and we would love for you to come.

102
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,284
One condition, I bring the nog.

103
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,046
My Grandma Millie's recipe,
it is gonna knock your socks off.

104
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,441
- Oh, wait a minute.
- Hmm?

105
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,445
- We gonna have a little "nog-off."
- Really?

106
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,489
Grandma Esther versus Grandma Millie.

107
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,643
Oh, you know I love a challenge, Joe West.

108
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,684
- May the best grandma win.
- I am so sorry for your grandma.

109
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,291
We'll see. Fine.

110
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,883
- I'll pick you up, all right?
- Christmas miracle.

111
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,725
I told everyone inside I'd let them live
if they followed my instructions.

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,607
But I tricked them, which is so me.

113
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,881
Give it up, Trickster.

114
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,890
Hi-ya, Swifty.

115
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,451
Will you do me the honor
of allowing me to kill you?

116
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,444
You're out of ammo.

117
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,962
But I'm not out of bombs.

118
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,128
What do you say we take in the afterlife,
big boy?

119
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,683
GARRICK: Nice timing.
THE FLASH: You're welcome.

120
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,486
There's something wrong with my eyes.
I'm seeing double.

121
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,651
The Flash hit me too hard.
I'm gonna sue you, Saucer Head!

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,764
One day, I'll own that helmet,

123
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,884
and I'll use it as an ashtray,
or a candy dish.

124
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,605
No, wait! A hubcap.

125
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,121
- I had that, kid.
- That's what I always say.

126
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,408
- <i>Let me go!
- Especially when I didn't have it.</i>

127
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,122
I'm assuming you didn't come all the way
to Earth-3 to stop my Trickster.

128
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,885
I have something
I need to talk to you about.

129
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,044
Speedster. Calls himself "Savitar."

130
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,884
- So, Savitar?
- Yeah.

131
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,367
Apparently, you've grown powerful enough
to challenge him.

132
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,525
- Who is he?
- Don't know. Never seen him.

133
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,804
You're the first speedster
I know of who has.

134
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,530
But every story I ever heard about Savitar
is basically the same.

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,810
Savitar was the first man
ever granted speed.

136
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,647
<i>And over time,</i>

137
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,929
<i>he became the God of Motion,
the fastest of us all.</i>

138
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,203
<i>Before Savitar graces an Earth
with his presence...</i>

139
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,282
<i>he sends a predecessor
to prepare for his arrival.</i>

140
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,045
- Alchemy.
- Hmm.

141
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,604
What's he preparing for?

142
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,127
- A battle. With you.
- Why me?

143
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,970
You're threatening his power.

144
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,406
How do you know all this?

145
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,809
Speed force myths, legends, rumors.

146
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,162
If Savitar's come for you once,
he'll be back.

147
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,361
Then I'll be ready.

148
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,204
We'll be ready.

149
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,571
H.R.: Run! Wallace, run!

150
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,326
You gotta torque to the left!

151
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,489
- How'd I do?
- How'd you do?

152
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,609
Oh, I don't know,
why don't you see for yourself?

153
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,042
Hold up.
Are you saying I'm faster than Barry?

154
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,528
I'm saying that at this point
in his training,

155
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,482
you're faster than Barry.
You're faster than Barry.

156
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,246
You're faster than Barry.
You're faster than Barry.

157
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,129
- We gotta tell everyone.
- Not a good idea.

158
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,204
- Why not?
- Self-preservation, basically.

159
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,961
Look, Wallace, you have tremendous
potential, yes, clearly.

160
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,202
But, one thing I've learned
since coming to this Earth is,

161
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,443
you do not trifle with the West household.

162
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,162
No, you know... No, say you're with me.

163
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,004
- Yeah. I'm with you.
- Yeah!

164
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,528
Now, we're gonna work on your...
Yep, your dodging and your weaving.

165
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,331
I've read every Hindu textbook there is

166
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,171
on mythology, and spirits, and demigods,
and nothing.

167
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,004
No mention of Savitar, not once.

168
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,088
In my experience, the answers
usually tend to come in time.

169
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,161
Yeah, I can't just sit back
and wait for Savitar or Alchemy to attack.

170
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,931
You can't worry about
what may or may not lie ahead.

171
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,366
Besides,

172
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,086
it's Christmas.

173
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,527
A time to be with the ones you care about.

174
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,726
You know,
it's just Savitar's still out there.

175
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,048
Yeah, but not right now.

176
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,802
And your beautiful girlfriend is.

177
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,450
Get your head out of the books.

178
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,684
And back into your life
with your loved ones while you have them.

179
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,322
Hey, Jay thinks he figured out a way
to find the stone.

180
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,841
You Okay?

181
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,971
I don't know.

182
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,085
I keep seeing my brother.

183
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,211
Everywhere. Here. In the Cortex...

184
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,211
This is your first Christmas
since Dante died.

185
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,251
Maybe your mind's playing tricks on you?

186
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,246
Yeah.

187
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,251
Probably.

188
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,565
There was this one Christmas.

189
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,563
Big family affair.

190
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,448
And Dante and I, you know,
we used to fight all the time as kids,

191
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,251
<i>but, that one Christmas,</i>

192
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,046
we didn't fight.

193
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,410
We just sat and talked
and we drank a whole bottle of whiskey

194
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,240
and that whole night, we were laughing.

195
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,931
It's...

196
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,646
<i>And that one night...</i>

197
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,802
That one night,
it was like we felt like brothers.

198
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,923
The last Christmas before my dad died,
it snowed and snowed.

199
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,121
He and I just sat inside watching old
movies while the whole world turned white.

200
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,605
It was magical.

201
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,481
Hmm.

202
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,406
Are we about to be the grinches this year?

203
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,167
Nice use of restraint.

204
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,847
Yeah, well, I shopped, and I shopped,

205
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,121
and now I am ready to drop into your arms.

206
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,969
Sorry I missed
Christmas shopping with you.

207
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,891
It's okay. I have everything I need.

208
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,283
So, are you as excited to give me
my present as I am to give you yours?

209
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,847
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

210
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,685
You did get me something, right?

211
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,004
I did get you something, yeah.
I just, I haven't wrapped it yet is all.

212
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,851
- Okay.
- Okay.

213
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,645
Okay. By the way,

214
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,684
after you told me
about Julian's archeological dig,

215
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,410
I started doing some

216
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,085
- digging of my own.
- Uh-huh.

217
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,205
Turns out, a few years ago,

218
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,767
four scientists were killed
in an excavation in India,

219
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,440
and Julian was the point person.

220
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,205
He didn't mention that.

221
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,724
You said he was obsessed
with that stone for years.

222
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,487
What if he was covering something up?
Or someone?

223
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,724
You think this is about Alchemy?

224
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,209
There's only one way to find out.

225
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,162
Julian lied about the Philosopher's Stone.

226
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,402
I think he found it
back on that archeological dig.

227
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,250
You think he's working with
Doctor Alchemy?

228
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,369
He's not answering my calls.

229
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,086
Hey, everyone. Gang's all here.
What's going on?

230
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,729
I think that Julian
is connected to Doctor Alchemy.

231
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,245
Jay, we got a hit.

232
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,250
There's energy coming from the top
of the Shultz building. That's the stone.

233
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,561
- You ready?
- Ready.

234
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,131
- All right.
- I'm coming, too.

235
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,406
- JOE: No, you're not.
- No.

236
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,244
Dad, I'm ready.

237
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,364
Just tell them about how fast I am.
Tell them about the training.

238
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,130
- "Training?"
- "Training?"

239
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,126
Oh, training. The vocal training
because we're thinking of going caroling.

240
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,602
We're gonna talk about this later.

241
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,488
We're definitely gonna talk about it.

242
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,087
With the energy from this stone
and this building as a refractor,

243
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,730
I shall restore the powers
of all the metas from Flashpoint.

244
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,204
They will become the servants of Savitar.

245
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,365
It's over, Alchemy.

246
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,730
Please, tell me you're seeing him?

247
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,126
Oh, I see him.

248
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,885
We have to take him together.

249
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,129
No, I'll cover Savitar,
you just get that stone.

250
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,130
This is not your fight, Garrick.

251
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,931
Julian.

252
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,647
JULIAN: <i>Where am I? What's going on?</i>

253
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,087
Let's just say
you're gonna be our guest for a while.

254
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,726
You.

255
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,890
I always suspected you had your own
private facility for holding your enemies.

256
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,770
You care to explain what I'm doing in it?

257
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,560
- I know you're Alchemy, Julian.
- What?

258
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,849
Turning innocent people into meta-humans,
worshipping this Savitar.

259
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,730
Sorry, I'm still not following.

260
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,805
You think that I'm Alchemy?

261
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,044
<i>That's the most absurd thing
I've ever heard.</i>

262
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,362
The mask?
I've never seen that before in my life.

263
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,127
I caught you!
I caught you wearing this mask.

264
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,931
You're trying to set me up.

265
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,241
<i>You're framing me, aren't you?</i>

266
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,961
Flash, of all the people,
you are setting me up, the hero.

267
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,208
- You're insane.
- The great hero.

268
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,768
I want my phone call.
When will I get my phone call?

269
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,966
- Hey.
- GARRICK: Hey.

270
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,241
How you feeling?

271
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,323
Not too bad for a guy
that got beat up by a myth.

272
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,364
- Yeah?
- You stopped him.

273
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,204
Well done, Barry.

274
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,488
It was nice, having you out there with me.

275
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,166
- Yeah, I've never had a sidekick.
- I'm your sidekick?

276
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,728
- Well, as the senior partner...
- Senior citizen's more like it.

277
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,403
I bet your dad
would've been proud of you, right?

278
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,762
Hey, why don't you...
There, just take it easy, all right?

279
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,088
I'll see you in a little bit.

280
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,402
What do you think about
what Julian was saying?

281
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,763
I know that every bad guy we've ever had
has pretended to be our best friend,

282
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,367
while really being
an evil murderous bastard, but...

283
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,410
I think if he's lying, he sure believes
the hell out of his own lie.

284
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,444
Okay, well,
what do we think about this box?

285
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,726
It's creepy.

286
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,120
Like, <i>Indiana Jones,</i>
melt-your-face creepy.

287
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,765
Have you guys figured out
anything about it yet?

288
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,765
It's nothing.

289
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,164
- Hmm. It's something...
- No, I mean, the box is literally nothing.

290
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,482
<i>I've run it through
every possible test I can think of.</i>

291
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,048
MRI, X-Ray, mass spectrometer,
the photon shifter.

292
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,848
Not a single reading. Nothing.

293
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,051
It's like the box doesn't even exist.

294
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,529
Two weeks ago, I almost lost you
to Alchemy. Then last week, aliens.

295
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,683
- My heart can't take it, Wally.
- Dad, he gets it.

296
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,685
- Iris, does he?
- I think so, yeah.

297
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,206
And you.

298
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,489
A couple weeks ago you were telling me
how you believed in me and my instincts,

299
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,530
and now you're encouraging
Wally to do exactly the opposite?

300
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,523
I don't know
how much encouraging he needed.

301
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,923
- What's the deal with you?
- Hmm?

302
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,689
You have some psychotic need to make
other people like you no matter what?

303
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,205
I wouldn't call it "Psychotic."

304
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,763
No, my deal is, I find people's true
talents, I just marshal them along.

305
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,524
Do you even have your own opinions?

306
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,250
Stop, stop banging on H.R.

307
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,521
<i>This was all me, okay?</i>

308
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,327
I pushed him to train me,
I pushed him to help me.

309
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,569
Wasn't like anyone else
was lining up to do it.

310
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,530
BARRY: <i>Hey, what's up?</i>

311
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,411
It's Wally.

312
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,801
I don't get it, Barry,

313
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,322
it's like his brain goes to sleep
and somebody else is at the wheel.

314
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,968
Have you been losing time? Blacking out?

315
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,482
Hours pass,
you waking up somewhere different,

316
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,041
- not being sure of how you got there?
- No.

317
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,770
- No?
- No.

318
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,282
I've had enough of these
baseless accusations

319
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,090
and ridiculous theories of yours.

320
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,084
Julian, I'm trying to help you,
but you need to trust me.

321
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,129
Says the man in a mask.

322
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,005
Yeah, you're right.

323
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,329
I should've known. I should've guessed it.

324
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,321
The unexplained absences,
your passion for metas,

325
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,722
your general thumbing your nose
at authority.

326
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,849
I'm sure you had a good laugh
behind my back.

327
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,083
I actually wished
I could've told you before.

328
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,606
So why tell me now?

329
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,724
Because I need you to trust me, Julian.

330
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,810
You are Alchemy.
I just don't think you were aware of it.

331
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,889
Now, have you been blacking out?

332
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,401
Yes.

333
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,810
When did it start?

334
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,610
My sister, Emma, died when I was 20.

335
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,290
It really broke the family up, you know?

336
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,284
Mum and Dad weren't speaking,
they wouldn't even stay at the house.

337
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,202
One night, I was there alone
and she came back to me.

338
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,644
She stood right in front of me,
clear as day.

339
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,691
A ghost or a vision, I don't know,
but she was real.

340
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,367
What happened?

341
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,883
She told me about the stone.

342
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,004
She told me where to find it,
she told me that if I got it,

343
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,203
that it would bring us back
together again.

344
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,444
And at that point, mate,
I would've done anything to have her back.

345
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,445
<i>And so I did.</i>

346
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,483
I mounted an expedition to India.

347
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,451
Days, we searched, weeks. Nothing.

348
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,047
And then we found it.

349
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,482
Next thing I remember,
I woke up in the hotel room.

350
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,484
I didn't remember anything,

351
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,922
and that's when the blackouts
started happening.

352
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,168
<i>There was a news report saying that</i>

353
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,206
every other member of my team
had been found dead.

354
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,125
<i>At the site.</i>

355
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,562
I panicked, I thought they were
gonna blame me for their deaths, so I ran.

356
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,409
I ran to America.

357
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,489
What happens when you black out, Julian?

358
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,205
<i>How does it start?</i>

359
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,805
I hear the voice.

360
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,121
DANTE: <i>Cisco.</i>

361
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,122
You're losing it, man, you're losing it.
Ah!

362
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,880
Stop scaring me!

363
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,210
Whatever you are, it's not cool, okay?

364
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,204
<i>Oh, I know exactly what you are.</i>

365
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,569
You are a figment of my grief.

366
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,649
Please, just leave.

367
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,371
I can't do that, Cisco.

368
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,770
This is not real.

369
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,247
Okay, I need an anti-psychotic. Caitlin!

370
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,364
If you leave,
I'm gonna have to leave, too.

371
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,290
So you're telling me
that every time I'm blacking out...

372
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,721
- You've become Alchemy.
- That's impossible.

373
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,051
Alchemy is a monster,
he's been terrorizing people for years.

374
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,401
Look, it's not you.

375
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,364
<i>Just like it wasn't you back on that dig.</i>

376
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,001
I know that this is hard to believe,

377
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,845
but you have to start accepting
what's happening to you.

378
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,727
Don't you want us to be together again?

379
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,211
The stone. It's the key to everything.

380
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,204
It can transform people.

381
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,005
Open it and I can be reborn.

382
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,408
We can be together again.

383
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,091
We can have that bottle of whiskey.

384
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,126
After all, it is Christmas, <i>hermano.</i>

385
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,648
It's the time of miracles.

386
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,122
I just want this to be real.

387
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,689
Just open the box.

388
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,291
I love you, Cisco.

389
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,770
Dante?

390
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,521
Dante?

391
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,924
What's that?

392
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,324
- Guys, what's going on?
- CAITLIN: <i>Cisco's workshop.</i>

393
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,722
<i>Barry, he opened the box.</i>

394
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,769
Wait. Wait. What...

395
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,650
- Cisco.
- Bow to your god.

396
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,006
What is happening?

397
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,083
We can't see it,
just like at Alchemy's lair.

398
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,327
GARRICK: <i>Savitar's loose.</i>

399
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,002
Hey, Jay, Jay.
You're still too badly hurt.

400
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,160
Remember, dodge and weave.

401
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,130
Wally! No!

402
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,843
- I can see him!
- H.R.: <i>Great. Get his attention.</i>

403
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,761
Uh, yo, metal mouth.

404
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,847
Clearly, nobody taught you
how to play nice with others.

405
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,851
Cisco? Cisco, you have to close the box.

406
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,649
- But it saved Dante.
- That's not Dante, it's Savitar.

407
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,083
Please, he's using your memories
against you.

408
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,691
DANTE: <i>You're a good brother, Cisco.</i>

409
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,571
Cisco, we're running out of time.
Please, just hand me the box.

410
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,131
I won't lose him again.

411
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,806
I will not lose my brother again!

412
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,250
Cisco, Dante is gone. I'm so sorry,
but there is nothing you can do about it.

413
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,040
But there are people
that you can save right now.

414
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,841
If you don't close that box,
Barry and Wally will die.

415
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,405
If you do, we can't be together.

416
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,045
Cisco, listen to me.

417
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,641
Don't.

418
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,600
Thanks.

419
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,163
Are you kidding? That was awesome.

420
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,480
You sure you're okay?

421
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,444
Still in one piece.

422
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,086
I don't know what happened.

423
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,449
So now that the box is closed,
Savitar is, what, gone for good?

424
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,206
I don't know, but we need to find out.

425
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,290
Cisco, if we can't use this box...

426
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,763
Julian, he may be
our only link to Savitar now, right?

427
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,123
I think we can use both of them.

428
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:24,521
If Caitlin's right and this thing messes
with brain waves, then I have a plan.

429
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,166
Hey.

430
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,807
You put my son's life in danger again.

431
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,201
And he saved Barry's life.

432
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,365
<i>Joe, why...</i>

433
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,650
Why do you think I help Wally?

434
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,810
Because I'm selfish? Because I get
something? I don't get anything out of it.

435
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,890
I helped Wally because the kid is special.

436
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,484
He's extraordinary,
his powers are extraordinary.

437
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,650
And, look, I get it. I'm not his dad,

438
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,088
and I don't have the same safety concerns
of you, of course not,

439
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,448
but, Joe, one thing I do know?

440
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,848
The longer you deny someone
their potential,

441
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,724
the more they're gonna
look for it elsewhere.

442
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,290
So what am I doing here?

443
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,643
Okay, Julian,
today when I was fighting Savitar,

444
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,803
he and Alchemy, they have the same voice.

445
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,050
- What does that mean?
- I don't think there is an Alchemy.

446
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,567
I think it's Savitar,
speaking through you.

447
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,162
Savitar clearly possesses someone
who rallies worshippers.

448
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,085
But he's like a Poltergeist,
he needs a medium to manifest himself.

449
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,482
- You.
- Right. But what does that mean?

450
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,850
We think we've figured out a way
to sync your brain to the stone.

451
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,249
And it'll allow us
to speak directly to Savitar.

452
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,641
I see.

453
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,003
If you wanna try to be free of this,
you need to trust us.

454
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,362
I've never liked you, Allen.

455
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,767
- Yeah.
- Having a little seance with your friends

456
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,201
now is not gonna help change that fact,
you do know that?

457
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,168
Fine. I'll try it.

458
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,404
- Deep breaths. Okay?
- Yeah.

459
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,881
You're gonna count backwards from 10.

460
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,051
Ten...

461
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,005
That was quick.

462
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,402
Okay, so, how long till this works?

463
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,648
Not really sure, it may take a minute
for his brain wave...

464
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,250
Hello, Barry.

465
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,921
It's been a while.

466
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,801
Savitar?

467
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,484
None of you are on your knees.

468
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,331
It's a smart move to bow before a deity.

469
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,886
You're not God.

470
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,765
To be a god, you just have to make people
believe you are.

471
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,127
No one believes in you.

472
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,250
You should, Iris.

473
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,410
I hold the power of life and death
over all of you.

474
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,285
How do you know so much about us?

475
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,246
I know you, Caitlin. Cisco, Joe, Wally.

476
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,326
The fake Wells.

477
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,608
<i>I know your fears, I know your weaknesses,</i>

478
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,962
<i>I know you better
than you know yourselves.</i>

479
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,730
I know your destinies.

480
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,611
One shall betray you.

481
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,690
One shall fall.

482
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,122
<i>One will suffer a fate
far worse than death.</i>

483
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,044
This is the knowledge I have for you,
about your everlasting damnation.

484
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,767
Who are you?

485
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,290
I am the future, Flash.

486
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,841
- What do you want from us?
- Everything.

487
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,281
Everything you took from me,
I want it back.

488
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,120
And I'm gonna take it back,
then I will destroy you.

489
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,925
Then why haven't you already?

490
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,609
If you're all powerful, then why don't you
just go ahead and kill us all now,

491
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,484
be done with it?

492
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,570
Because you can't.

493
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,529
You did this to me.

494
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,482
You trapped me in eternity.

495
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,730
Your future self,
you did this to me, Barry.

496
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,326
And now the age of my revenge rises.

497
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,210
My freedom is at hand.

498
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,124
You will feel my wrath.

499
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,004
The wrath of Savitar!

500
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,971
Did it work?

501
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,731
That was so scary.

502
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,002
I mean, that was...
Was it not truly frightening?

503
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,726
What, with the voice and the prophecies
and...

504
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,969
Oh, that was a scare-a-thon, wasn't it?

505
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,208
I'm gonna go have a mint tea and a coffee
and a lay down.

506
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,842
Do you think the things that he said about
one of us betraying him

507
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,924
and one of us dying could really be true?

508
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,731
I mean, if it really was future Barry

509
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,763
that pissed him off
and locked him up somewhere,

510
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,605
then maybe he knows
what happens to "future us."

511
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,211
He doesn't.

512
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,050
He's never getting out of
wherever he's trapped.

513
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,804
How are we supposed to stop him?

514
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,371
GARRICK: The stone.

515
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,128
Jay's right, the stone has been
the key to everything.

516
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,841
It's how he controlled Julian,
it's how he's created more metas.

517
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,243
So we destroy the stone
and Savitar is gone for good.

518
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,408
It's impossible to destroy.

519
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,882
It's been around forever,
there's a reason for that.

520
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,246
Why don't we just bury it again?

521
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,164
Put it back in the ground
where you found it.

522
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,560
Mmm-mmm. Jumanji.

523
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,087
Someone would just find it,
and we'd be right back where we started.

524
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,288
We need to make that box
disappear forever.

525
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,408
There's only one thing we can do with it.

526
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,085
Throw it into the Speed Force.

527
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,049
- Wait, you can do that?
- GARRICK: <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

528
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,804
The Speed Force is eternity itself,
an endless void of time and energy.

529
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,327
It'd be like trying to find it
after it got lost in space.

530
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,046
But that stone is loaded
with gravimetric force.

531
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,646
I mean,
I don't think you could run fast enough

532
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,928
to reach the Speed Force
and carry that at the same time.

533
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,764
He can with my help.

534
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,850
<i>We run as fast as we can.</i>

535
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,606
You trail behind me,
siphon off some of my speed,

536
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,489
combine it with your own,
and when you have enough,

537
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,369
throw that thing
deep into the Speed Force.

538
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,248
And that will work?

539
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,686
We need to find out.

540
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,881
Sure you're up for this, Flash?

541
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,561
You got it, Flash.

542
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,165
I'll let you know
when you reach optimal speed.

543
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,401
All right.

544
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,965
Ready. Go!

545
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,611
Jay's moving really fast,
this might actually work.

546
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,291
Now, Barry!

547
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,360
FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR:
<i>In other legal news,</i>

548
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,006

553
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,766
FUTURE BARRY: Don't!

554
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,081
Please.

555
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,966
<i>Don't!</i>

556
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,486
Don't do this.

557
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,411
Now, finally, I am free of you.

558
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,529
Barry, I love you.

559
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,167
Hey, no, don't say that, all right?
You're gonna be all right.

560
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,163
- I'm begging you, just...
- Barry.

561
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,363
You lose, Barry.

562
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,091
No!

563
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,920
No!

564
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,568
Iris, Iris. Hey.

565
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,446
Iris. Iris. Iris.

566
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,646
Jay.

567
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,048
What the hell was that? Where was I?

568
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,450
The future.

569
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,040
I've never run to the future.

570
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,891
I've traveled to the past,
but I always came back to the present.

571
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,006
I saw myself. And Iris.

572
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,925
And Savitar. What... He killed her.

573
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,324
<i>That's five months from now.</i>

574
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,564
Is that actually gonna happen?

575
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,131
- I don't know.
- <i>You don't...</i>

576
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,441
You shouldn't have seen that.

577
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,764
This doesn't make sense.

578
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,684
We just got rid of
the Philosopher's Stone.

579
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,929
I mean,
Savitar shouldn't have even been there!

580
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,805
Oh, my God.

581
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,203
This is why the newspaper
in the time vault changed.

582
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,525
The byline, this is why it's not Iris.

583
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:53,004
Iris didn't write that story anymore
eight years from now because...

584
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,449
- She's dead.
- Barry.

585
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,363
I just watched her die.

586
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,129
<i>I saw myself try to save her
but I wasn't fast enough.</i>

587
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,848
Jay, tell me that this isn't my destiny.

588
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,526
What you saw
was one possibility of the future,

589
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,728
<i>what may be, or what may not.</i>

590
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,371
Okay, then I can stop this from happening.

591
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,488
- I can run back there...
- You can't go back there.

592
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,483
<i>Not again, not ever.</i>

593
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,724
All right. Then I'll figure out exactly
how it happened,

594
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,160
how we wind up on that street.

595
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,560
And I'll just make sure
that we don't go there.

596
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,040
- I mean, if we don't go there...
- Barry.

597
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,328
This is why speedsters
don't travel to the future.

598
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,171
Nobody should know this much
about their own.

599
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,324
<i>Just as there are infinite Earths
in the multi-verse,</i>

600
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,046
there are infinite possibilities
to the future.

601
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,282
It's always bending, always changing,

602
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,887
every decision you make
creates another alternative.

603
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,844
I won't let Iris die.

604
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,210
The future isn't written yet.

605
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,001
<i>And it might not even turn out to be
what you saw.</i>

606
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,603
You need to focus on the here and now.

607
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,844
You have to live your life.

608
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,689
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

609
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,360
Are you okay?
You and Jay disappeared and...

610
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,047
No, I'm okay. Just glad to see you.

611
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,487
So where's Jay?

612
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,251
Jay decided to go ahead
and go back to Earth-3.

613
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,808
But he wanted to wish everybody
a Merry Christmas.

614
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,367
- So it worked? The stone?
- It's gone.

615
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,444
<i>It's lost in the Speed Force.</i>

616
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,846
Good.

617
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,849
I don't know about you guys,
but being mind-punked

618
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,923
by a speed god
that we piss off in the future,

619
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,090
it's enough to kill your Christmas spirit.

620
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,761
Guys, Christmas time is here.

621
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,570
<i>We need a little Christmas.</i>

622
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,644
Right this very minute. Who's with me? BA?

623
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,281
He's right.

624
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,881
It's Christmas, we should be together.
Let's have it.

625
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,451
- Joe?
- I'm still in if everybody else is.

626
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,529
- Yes!
- Okay, we'll be there.

627
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,721
Yeah.

628
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,206
Julian.

629
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,564
Where's he going?

630
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,363
Hey, where you going?

631
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,811
Do you have Christmas plans?

632
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,721
The Wests are having
a Christmas get-together.

633
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,601
After what you've been through,
you shouldn't be alone.

634
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,807
I actually prefer to be alone
at Christmas.

635
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,002
Rain on Christmas.
That's neither "holly" nor "jolly."

636
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,564
Hey, listen.

637
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,885
About Dante.

638
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,888
Thank you for talking me off the ledge.

639
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,809
Of course. You'd do the same for me.

640
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,123
- In fact, you did the same for me.
- I was gonna say it.

641
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,683
Caitlo, Caitlo. Ciscan.

642
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,010
Okay.
You gotta try their eggnog?

643
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,689
<i>The holiday concoction done by Joe
and his hot girlfriend.</i>

644
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,086
Babe.

645
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,486
- Hey.
- What's up?

646
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,920
Nothing.

647
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,248
You seem a little weird.
No?

648
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,129
You do know we won, right?

649
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,282
We defeated the bad guy.

650
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,204
- Yeah, I know.
- Okay.

651
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,245
- Grandma Esther.
- Grandma Millie.

652
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,811
Let's see.

653
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,161
Mmm.

654
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,170
- Damn, that's strong.
- Oh!

655
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,289
So is that, my God.

656
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,608
- Our grandmothers are alcoholics.
- Yes.

657
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,970
You know, technically, we don't have to be
standing under the mistletoe to...

658
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,806
Finally.

659
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,483
- No comments from the peanut gallery.
- No, but really, it's about time.

660
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,488
- What?
- Hold on.

661
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,129
And it's my daughter.

662
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,010
- Yeah, just, give me a quick minute?
- Hmm.

663
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,488
And then we can... Yeah.

664
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,526
- Joe. I saw you kiss her, good job.
- Shh!

665
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,682
Oh, that's right. The thing. BA. Come on.

666
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,248
<i>- How many of those have you had?
- Where's he going? Hey.</i>

667
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,045
- I'm right here.
- I see you.

668
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,365
Now that Cecile is away,
this is from all of us to you.

669
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,369
<i>Merry Christmas, son.</i>

670
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,562
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, man, it's time.

671
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,484
You're ready, Wallace.

672
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,570
Welcome to the team.

673
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,205
<i>Kid Flash.</i>

674
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,530
Are we really calling me Kid Flash?

675
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,051
Yeah, I think we are.

676
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,605
Kid Flash!

677
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,407
- Police!
- I got it.

678
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,245
- It's not the... We're the police.
- You're the police.

679
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,441
Calm down.

680
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,920
- Hey, Julian.
- Hey.

681
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,884
- Come on. Here, let me get that.
- Thanks.

682
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,882
After everything that happened,
being alone felt a bit lonely, so...

683
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,248
- Yeah.
- This is for you.

684
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,926
What's this?

685
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,043
I spoke to Captain Singh,
and he hadn't put through

686
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,407
your resignation paperwork yet, so...

687
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,609
Well, if you'd, you know,
like your old lab back,

688
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,406
or, I mean, like to share it again...

689
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,010
Thanks, Julian.

690
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,209
Merry Christmas, man.

691
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,761
- Cheers, mate.
- Yeah, thank you.

692
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,121
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

693
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,566
Can I offer you some eggnog?

694
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,041
Oh, I'd love some, yeah.
Happy Christmas, everyone.

695
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,163
- I'm glad you came.
- Thank you. Yeah.

696
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,451
Oh!

697
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,924
- Did you hear that?
- It's outside.

698
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,166
<i>Carolers.</i>

699
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,126
Caroling in the rain.

700
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,246
That sucks.

701
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,360
Hey-

702
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,330
- What're you doing?
- It's okay, I got this.

703
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,284
We may not be able
to have a perfect Christmas,

704
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,647
but we can have a white one.

705
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,531
So, when are we gonna exchange presents?

706
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,200
- How about right now?
- Okay.

707
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,926
Follow me, come on. Let's get out of here.

708
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,208
Okay, going through a door, be careful.

709
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,204
All right? Right here.

710
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,962
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

711
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,651
All right.

712
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,088
Open your eyes, now.

713
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,161
I don't understand. Where are we?

714
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,685
Home.

715
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,367
What?

716
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,166
I couldn't sleep on Cisco's couch anymore

717
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,563
and your place is sort of small for two,

718
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,688
so I signed a lease,

719
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,645
and I put both of our names on it.

720
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,044
I got you a wallet.

721
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,364
I'm sure I'll love it.

722
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,488
Barry, this is a big step.

723
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,805
Not for me.

724
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,449
I don't know
what's gonna happen in the future.

725
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,005
All I know is, right here, right now,

726
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,248
I wanna spend every moment I can with you.

727
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,811
You're the first thing I wanna see
when I wake up.

728
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,481
You're the last thing I wanna...

729
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,245
I love you, Barry Allen.

730
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,723
I love you, Iris West.
