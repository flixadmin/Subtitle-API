1
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,692
<i>It came out of nowhere.</i>

2
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,362
<i>You gotta help us.</i>

3
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,534
<i>- Look at all this damn water.
- Don't drink that.</i>

4
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,995
<i>Ain't no telling if it's gonna be poison.</i>

5
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,729
<i>Nothing new over here.</i>

6
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,423
{\an8}How's Junior?

7
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,467
{\an8}Exactly what I expected.

8
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,887
{\an8}He hasn't said a word
since we told him it was going back.

9
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:20,641
{\an8}I spoke to the dealership,
they didn't wanna take it.

10
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,392
{\an8}What?

11
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,728
{\an8}It's in perfect condition.

12
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,856
{\an8}- It's got 17 miles on the odometer.
- I know.

13
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:32,194
{\an8}I spent an hour sweet-talking
the manager down to a restocking fee.

14
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,404
{\an8}Eight hundred dollars.

15
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,074
{\an8}Eight hundred dollars?
For two days?

16
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,661
{\an8}Well, the law says they don't have
to take it back at all.

17
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:45,040
{\an8}All right, here's the registration,
the window sticker, the receipt.

18
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,584
{\an8}Make sure you talk
to the general manager.

19
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,503
{\an8}His name is Glenn.

20
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,088
{\an8}Glenn.

21
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,966
{\an8}Call me if there's a problem.
And please just don't...

22
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,135
{\an8}Don't tangle with anyone.

23
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,267
{\an8}Fine.

24
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,439
{\an8}Walt.

25
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,389
Shit.

26
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,466
Yes, hello.

27
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,468
I need a cab.

28
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,431
Yes, thank you. The name is White.

29
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:37,355
I'm at the Pavilion parking lot
on University.

30
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,984
Oh, yes, that's right.
Just south of the airport.

31
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,279
Oh, that would be great, thank you.

32
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,073
How long do you think that would take?

33
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,496
No, I'm sure he'll see me.

34
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,165
Thank you.

35
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,462
<i>Contrition?</i>

36
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,923
<i>Hey, there is total contrition here.</i>

37
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,926
There's mountains of contrition.

38
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,471
"Fan-tan-tastic."
I will messenger them over right away.

39
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:14,601
Oh, and about that other thing
unrelated, yes, I can get you in,

40
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,063
but I gotta warn you,
the eighth hole is murder.

41
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,107
Oh, yeah.
You wanna make it interesting?

42
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,151
Great. Tee time is 7 a.m. sharp.

43
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,403
Prepare to have your ass handed to you.

44
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,822
Okay. Bye.

45
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:32,452
He was headed for destruction
of property. Since it's your property

46
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,748
I sweated him down
to misdemeanor trash burning.

47
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,251
Now, the only thing is,
it's not gonna be free.

48
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,838
There's a 5 grand fine,
600 for towing and disposal

49
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,132
3 grand to steam-clean the blacktop.

50
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,552
So bottom line, your little joyride is
gonna set you back

51
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,513
about 52,000 bucks.

52
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,057
So was it worth it?

53
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,228
I don't need to hear the blow-by-blow.
Just tell me it's done.

54
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,480
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

55
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,400
I caught this thing
before it got into the system.

56
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,277
Your record stays clean,
the wife never finds out.

57
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:10,490
I've been working magic here.
I could at least get an "attaboy."

58
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,245
Fine. Rebel without a cause, give.

59
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,177
What is it? Fring?

60
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,264
He will see me dead.

61
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,850
And there's nothing I can do about it.

62
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:41,438
All that's left is to wait.

63
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,483
And we're sure about this.

64
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,653
Because Pinkman says
he needs you too much.

65
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,114
"Pinkman says."

66
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,496
"Pinkman says."

67
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,128
Unless

68
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,215
you could help me find a third party.

69
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,593
What third party?

70
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,388
Someone who can ameliorate the situation.

71
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,600
Let's ditch the thesaurus, all right?

72
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,852
You talking about a hit man?

73
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,772
Assuming that's still
what they're called.

74
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,523
Wrong answer.

75
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,693
That's what the kids call "epic fail."

76
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,238
All I would need is a phone number.
I'd do the rest.

77
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,075
Saul, there'd be a finder's fee.

78
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,493
A big one.

79
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:40,246
If you held my feet to the fire,
I could come up with names.

80
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,333
One or two guys west of the Rockies
who do this work.

81
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,418
But guess what. These guys

82
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,296
they know Mike and Mike knows them.

83
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,965
Mike knows everyone who does this?

84
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,134
Who do you think gave me their names?

85
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:57,055
All right. Okay, plan B.
Look, we go outside my network.

86
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,724
Craigslist.<i> Soldier of Fortune.</i>

87
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,977
Let's say we get lucky.
I mean, incredibly lucky,

88
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,146
and find a guy who's not a cop,

89
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,399
or some kind
of survivalist nut-job wannabe.

90
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,820
You gotta ask yourself:
How good is good enough?

91
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,949
Whatever goombah we buy
is gonna come head-to-head with Mike.

92
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,492
And Gus Fring?

93
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:22,080
Hey, just winging that guy is
not gonna "ameliorate" your situation.

94
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,040
Not by a damn sight.

95
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:27,544
I've tried to solve this,
but I can't get anywhere near him.

96
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,962
You can't get near him?

97
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,422
Why don't you ask your partner?

98
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,012
Yeah, I saw him.

99
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,599
And you tell Saul before you tell me?

100
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,435
Look, he's my lawyer, same as yours.

101
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,647
Every time I go over there,
Saul hassles me about Mike.

102
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,817
He's still scared
the dude's gonna come break his legs.

103
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,695
So I give him the latest.

104
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,822
What happened exactly?

105
00:10:56,322 --> 00:11:02,996
I was at a diner with Mike
and he just shows up.

106
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,665
They send me outside
and the two of them talk.

107
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,417
That's it.

108
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,713
So this is, like, a regular thing?

109
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,550
How close were you to him?

110
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:16,926
Close.

111
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,430
I mean, closer than you and me right now.

112
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,309
Did he speak to you?

113
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,316
It was over in 10 seconds.

114
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,401
Would you just answer?

115
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,946
He said, he sees things in people.

116
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,366
What things?

117
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,951
What people?

118
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,203
Me.

119
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,748
He said he sees something in me.

120
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:56,132
A month ago,
Gus was trying to kill both of us.

121
00:11:56,299 --> 00:12:01,596
And now he pulls you out of the lab
and employs you as what?

122
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,473
An assistant gunman?

123
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,475
A tough guy?

124
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,603
Does that make any sense to you?

125
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,399
He says he sees something in you.

126
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,362
What kind of game is he playing?

127
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,114
Does he think you're that naive?

128
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:25,620
He can't truly think that you'd forget...

129
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:30,833
Well, let alone Gale, let alone Victor,

130
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,170
and all the horror
that goes along with all of that.

131
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,839
What about this girlfriend of yours,

132
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,175
and her little brother?

133
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,428
I mean, the man looked you straight
in the eye,

134
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:48,726
and told you, "No more children."
But that very night, that little boy

135
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,228
he just...

136
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,313
He winds up...

137
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,901
Gus can't possibly think
that you'd forget that.

138
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,281
- Okay.
- All I'm just saying is that

139
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:05,994
is it possible that he would think
that you're that weak-willed?

140
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,080
Drop the sales pitch.

141
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,082
I'll do it.

142
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,127
You'll do what?

143
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,964
I'll kill him.

144
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,925
First chance I get.

145
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,991
Piña colada?
More like stale bubblegum.

146
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:49,245
Does anyone want their car to smell
like the bottom of a 6th-grader's desk?

147
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,955
Okay. Hemp? Really?

148
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:54,709
I know. But you know what they say.
"The customer's always right."

149
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,713
Speaking of customer, it's not too late
to have a grand opening.

150
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,051
I was thinking huge party, balloons,
bouncy house for the kids

151
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,261
you know, make a splash, get on TV.

152
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:09,349
Let people know they won't face the
eyebrows of doom when they come in.

153
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,894
Marie, how's Hank doing?

154
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,398
You know what? He's doing better.

155
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,442
- Is he?
- Yeah. He...

156
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:25,782
Lately, his mood's improved
and he's like a maniac with his PT.

157
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:26,991
That's fantastic.

158
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:31,162
Yeah, don't get me wrong,
he's got a long way to go, but he...

159
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,123
- Yeah.
- Oh, hey.

160
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:37,836
- Hey. Hi, Walt. It's good to see you.
- Hey. You too.

161
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,381
Hey, your cashier here
is quite the salesperson.

162
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:45,260
She just talked me into something
called the Orbital Paste Wax Buff.

163
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:48,596
Oh, yeah, it's very important
to maintain your clear coat.

164
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,265
Boy, once that's goes...

165
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:51,850
Oh, yeah.

166
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,893
Hi.

167
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,146
Hi.

168
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:04,070
Bogdan was averaging 19 cars
during rush hour,

169
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,991
and we are already up to 22.
Twenty-two actual cars.

170
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:13,246
Last night, I deposited $3800.

171
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,374
Jesus.

172
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,042
How much is that?

173
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:22,422
Two hundred seventy-four
thousand dollars, give or take.

174
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,675
- Give or take?
- Yeah.

175
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,178
I haven't counted it.

176
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,013
Wait.

177
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,807
Two hundred and seventy-four...

178
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,851
And this is how often?

179
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,769
Every two weeks.

180
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,815
Thursdays good for a drop-off?

181
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,650
But, Walt

182
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:49,282
are you telling me
you make $7,125,000 a year?

183
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:54,871
Seven and a half even, before expenses.

184
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,915
But I can't...

185
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,084
- This is too much.
- So it's more

186
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,462
than you thought,

187
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,381
and this is somehow bad news?

188
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,884
No, that's not the point.

189
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:11,596
I mean, there's no car wash in the world

190
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,848
that could do this kind of business.

191
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:18,228
I mean, this is nine months' work here,
minimum.

192
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,022
Seven million?
That could take years.

193
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:24,192
So set some aside.
Save it for a rainy day.

194
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:27,111
Save it? Where? Save it where?

195
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,699
I can't go to the bank with it.
I sure can't leave it here.

196
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,538
Wait a minute.

197
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,206
Is this all 50s?

198
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:42,585
- Who pays for a car wash with a 50?
- Skyler, I didn't ask you to do this.

199
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,964
I was under the impression
that you had this under control.

200
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,133
I just didn't expect
this amount of money.

201
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,556
- The 50s are gonna be a problem.
- That's what this is, problem solving.

202
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,975
This is a simple division of labor.

203
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:00,311
I bring money. You launder money.
This is what you wanted.

204
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,855
I never wanted any of this.

205
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,899
I've gotta go.

206
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,819
If you want out,
just say that you want out.

207
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,957
Okay, then.

208
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:38,743
You're telling me
you made this in the lab?

209
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,787
Why not?

210
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:45,249
Making it in his own lab
seemed appropriate.

211
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,043
There's not much of it.

212
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,212
We had more for Tuco.

213
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,047
It's enough.

214
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,049
This is still the best way.

215
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:56,594
You go after him with a gun,
you'll never get out of it alive.

216
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,346
But with this

217
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:00,765
you slip it into his food or drink.

218
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:03,226
There shouldn't be any taste or smell.

219
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,062
Thirty-six hours later...

220
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,526
A man his age, working as hard as he does

221
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:14,195
no one will be surprised.

222
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,117
What about Mike?

223
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:22,745
Mike can have his suspicions,
but that's all they'll be.

224
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:27,542
Please, one homicidal maniac at a time.

225
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,262
I don't know
when I'm gonna see Gus again.

226
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,515
I mean, if ever.

227
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,477
Keep it with you.

228
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,564
When you have the opportunity

229
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,524
be ready.

230
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,154
What if they search me?

231
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,575
Will they do that?

232
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,837
It's the wrong way around.

233
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,841
It's my lucky cigarette.

234
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:03,262
Well

235
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,474
whatever you do, don't smoke it.

236
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,352
You know they have a drive-thru, right?

237
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,270
No, this is good.

238
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:15,024
Could use the exercise,
get the blood pumping.

239
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,944
Don't worry,
you're not gonna have to pick me up.

240
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,073
Might take me a while,
but I'll get there.

241
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:26,369
Jesus, ain't we a pair.

242
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:29,539
Hey, you must really like chicken.

243
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:37,213
V-8, 470 horses, 20-inch rims,
satellite radio, Bluetooth.

244
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,758
Zero to 60 in 4.7 seconds.

245
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,261
Whoa, whoa, what do you mean, on a lark?

246
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:47,890
Spur of the moment, your dad ups
and buys you a brand-new Challenger?

247
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:51,102
Yeah, I barely got it around the block,

248
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:55,773
and Mom said we couldn't afford it
so they took it back.

249
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,485
Do you know how long I had it?
Fifteen hours.

250
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,572
Well, hey, buddy,
let me tell you something.

251
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:05,157
When I was your age

252
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,787
I'd have given my left nut
to drive a car like that for 15 minutes.

253
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,331
Seriously, how does that happen?

254
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:16,669
Well, we were looking at used cars
and I kind of...

255
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,213
You guilted him into it. I know.
I hear you.

256
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,092
You pulled the old, "Poor little me
and my troubles," am I right?

257
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,387
- Maybe.
- You flew too close to the sun.

258
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:29,599
You'd have let him buy you a clunker,
you'd be driving now

259
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,226
instead of borrowing mom's hooptie.

260
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,436
Agent Schrader.

261
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:35,646
- How are you doing?
- Well, thank you.

262
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,566
Good to see you.
Do you remember Mr. Fring?

263
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,360
- How are you?
- Well. Nice to see you again.

264
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,363
It's a pleasure to see you.
You're looking well.

265
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:49,744
Yeah, well, you know, chalk it up
to clean living and vitamin pills.

266
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:52,622
I must apologize.
If I had seen you come in

267
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,165
there'd have been no question
of accepting your money.

268
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,417
In the future, feel free to ask for me.

269
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:01,631
A DEA hero should never have to pay
for a meal at Pollos Hermanos.

270
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,551
No kidding?
Well, I'll take you up on that, for sure.

271
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,595
And how are your mother and father?

272
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:09,180
They're good.

273
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:11,390
- The chicken is great.
- Thank you.

274
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:14,602
If ever you're interested
in rewarding part-time work

275
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:17,647
perhaps something after school,
my door is open.

276
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,357
Sounds good.

277
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:23,819
I don't know about this one.
He might eat up all your profits.

278
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,740
I'll let you finish your meal.
Can I get you anything else?

279
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,910
- A refill, perhaps?
- No, thank you. I'm good.

280
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:34,997
- Sure. Take a Diet Coke, thank you.
- Of course.

281
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,490
So where are we going?

282
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:15,162
Oh, big doings today.

283
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:21,043
The order of the day is eyes open,
mouth shut.

284
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,629
What's up?

285
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,970
Test.

286
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,597
Test.

287
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,141
You got me?

288
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,018
Count off.

289
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,364
Let's go.

290
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,869
Right here.
Leave the wrap on, please.

291
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,374
You know how to make coffee?

292
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:43,875
Sure.

293
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,877
There you go.

294
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,590
- You want a rundown?
- Please.

295
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:54,427
Three guys up at the gate,
two visible, one in the blind.

296
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:58,515
We got five guys down here
with a backup out of sight.

297
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,977
I got Tyrus down in the tree line
with a Barrett .50.

298
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:06,356
Planted him there last night,
in case we had any early arrivals.

299
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,175
I don't have an extra holster.

300
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,927
Stick this in your pocket.
Keep it out of sight.

301
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,807
If you're gonna be here today,
you're gonna have a gun.

302
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,354
It's loaded?

303
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:53,278
I don't wanna see that in your hand
unless you see me with mine.

304
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,822
Emergency only.

305
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,909
First car is coming.

306
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,290
All right, what's the order of the day?

307
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,834
Eyes open, mouth shut.

308
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,109
A lot of guns.

309
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:17,237
Nobody's asking you to give up yours.

310
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,576
You wanna sweep the place
before you bring in your guys?

311
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,204
I am the guy.

312
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,584
All right, then.

313
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,177
<i>You got something of mine?</i>

314
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,811
Glove box.

315
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,234
Figure I better teach you how to shoot.

316
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,445
Could be things are gonna get hairy.

317
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,325
What is this?

318
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:54,037
I mean, you're giving me a gun,

319
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:57,999
and now I'm, like, part of the team
or whatever?

320
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,296
He said he sees something in me.

321
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,673
Like what?

322
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,472
If I had to put it in a word

323
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:17,101
I'd guess loyalty.

324
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,145
Loyalty.

325
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,486
Only maybe you got it for the wrong guy.

326
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:46,173
Jesse?

327
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:48,884
- Hey.
- Hey.

328
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:51,012
Long time, no see.

329
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:55,349
How you doing?

330
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:57,310
Yeah, you know

331
00:32:57,852 --> 00:33:00,605
- good.
- Good.

332
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:02,607
Good.

333
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:07,695
Okay, we're gonna get started.
You coming in?

334
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:14,910
<i>So the truth is, we can't change
the past, what's done is done.</i>

335
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:18,539
We've gotta own our actions,
but putting ourselves on trial

336
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:22,668
acting as our own judge, jury
and executioner, it's not the answer.

337
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:25,171
A lot of the time, all that judging does

338
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:29,759
is just ensure
that we're gonna repeat the cycle.

339
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,719
Right?

340
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:34,096
"I'm such an asshole.

341
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:38,100
It's totally hopeless, what's the point?

342
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:40,144
I think I'll have a hit."

343
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:42,605
Jesse

344
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:46,067
what's going on with you these days?

345
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:52,406
I went back to the crystal.

346
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:54,700
You sober now?

347
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:56,369
Yeah.

348
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,204
Four days.

349
00:33:58,371 --> 00:33:59,455
Big whoop, right?

350
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:01,415
Hey, four days is four days.

351
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:03,000
You're here.

352
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:05,586
You still

353
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:08,631
working at the laundry?

354
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:09,965
How are things there?

355
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:13,552
Sucks ass.

356
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:17,264
Anything you wanna talk about?

357
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:29,735
A couple of weeks back...

358
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:34,532
I killed a dog.

359
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,787
You hit it with your car?

360
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:44,333
No.

361
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,586
I put him down.

362
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:50,506
I watched him go.

363
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:53,884
I was looking him straight in the eye.

364
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:59,765
He didn't know what was happening.
He didn't know why. He...

365
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:04,145
He was just scared.

366
00:35:06,397 --> 00:35:08,190
And then he was gone.

367
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:10,901
He was suffering.

368
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:12,820
It was a kindness.

369
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:16,699
No, he wasn't sick.

370
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:21,454
No. He was just, like...

371
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,832
I don't know, like, a

372
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,877
problem dog.

373
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,879
What did he do?

374
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:31,088
Bite someone?

375
00:35:34,258 --> 00:35:36,302
No, this dog never...

376
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:39,013
Never bit anybody.

377
00:35:40,014 --> 00:35:43,893
You pick up the rock,
you go right to the dark side.

378
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:45,186
Anything can happen.

379
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:47,688
It ain't no rock that made me do it.

380
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:50,316
What was the problem?
Why did you kill him?

381
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:52,735
Watch the crosstalk, please.

382
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:57,948
Maybe it's not the details that matter,
right?

383
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:00,868
How do you feel about what you did,
Jesse?

384
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,915
I don't know.

385
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:10,252
Who cares how you feel?

386
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,214
What kind of person kills a dog
for no reason?

387
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,465
Colleen.

388
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:17,343
Put an ad in the paper,
drop him off at a shelter.

389
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:21,680
You don't just sit there and talk about
killing a helpless, innocent animal.

390
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,767
We're not here to sit in judgment.

391
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:27,436
Why not?

392
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:31,357
Why not? Maybe she's right.

393
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:36,070
Maybe I should have put it in the paper.
I should've done something different.

394
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:43,536
The thing is, if you just do stuff
and nothing happens

395
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:47,289
what's it all mean?

396
00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:49,166
What's the point?

397
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:55,506
Oh, right, this whole thing
is about self-acceptance.

398
00:36:55,673 --> 00:36:58,968
Kicking yourself
doesn't give meaning to anything.

399
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:03,305
So I should stop judging,

400
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:06,392
- and accept?
- It's a start.

401
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:09,228
So no matter what I do

402
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:11,772
hooray for me because I'm a great guy?

403
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:14,024
It's all good?

404
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:20,781
No matter how many dogs I kill, I just,
what, do an inventory and accept?

405
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:28,622
I mean, you back your truck over
your own kid and you, like, accept?

406
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:31,959
- What a load of crap?
- Hey, Jesse.

407
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:33,335
I know you're in pain.

408
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:35,588
No, you know what?

409
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:40,050
Why I'm here in the first place

410
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:44,597
is to sell you meth.

411
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:50,311
You're nothing to me but customers!

412
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,275
I made you my bitch.

413
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:58,861
You okay with that?

414
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:02,531
You accept?

415
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:05,659
No.

416
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,630
About time.

417
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:48,661
Jesse.

418
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,204
Jesse.

419
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:52,915
Bring a light over here, will you?

420
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:07,596
Do you see any residue there?

421
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:13,602
- Where?
- Here. On the bottom, right there.

422
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,941
It's been a week. What's going on?

423
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,860
I haven't seen him.

424
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:27,491
I didn't think so. But I'll just give it
another shot anyway.

425
00:39:50,848 --> 00:39:53,600
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy. Look at that.

426
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:57,396
Graduated to doorman.
Finally found your calling.

427
00:39:57,563 --> 00:39:59,481
Oh, little whiskers, Marie.

428
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:00,691
What did you do?

429
00:40:00,858 --> 00:40:05,112
Show your barber a picture
of a dog's ass and said, "I'll take that"?

430
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:06,530
Charming as usual.

431
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:07,906
Welcome back.

432
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,325
- Looking good, Marie.
- Thanks, Steve.

433
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:14,663
- Good to see you. How you doing?
- He's fine. We can take it from here.

434
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,832
- Yeah.
- If you wanna hold his elbow.

435
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:21,086
No, no, no. You keep your mitts off me.
I'm good. I'm good.

436
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,382
Hey.

437
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,385
Good luck.

438
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:35,809
Let's go, we're running late.
Come on.

439
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:45,277
Hank, seeing you walk in here, I can't
tell you what that means to all of us.

440
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:48,614
Your progress, it's incredible.

441
00:40:48,781 --> 00:40:52,117
Yeah, well, chalk it up to clean living
and vitamin pills.

442
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:55,913
- Steve tell you his news?
- What?

443
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,165
Finally got your period?

444
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,209
I made GS-14.

445
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,086
Wow, that's all right, man.

446
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:05,130
Next stop: Washington, D.C.
Sitting behind a desk

447
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:07,758
papers piled so high,
you can't see over them.

448
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:09,760
Hey, better you than me, buddy.

449
00:41:09,927 --> 00:41:11,970
Seriously, congratulations, buddy.

450
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,555
Thanks.

451
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:16,058
Steve said you might have something
for us.

452
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:19,228
Yeah, maybe.
You guys are gonna have to tell me.

453
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,439
Remember my pal Tim Roberts?

454
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:23,899
APD detective?

455
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:26,318
Yeah, well, he's working
on a murder case.

456
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:28,946
The victim's a 34-year-old male Caucasian

457
00:41:29,113 --> 00:41:31,240
by the name of Gale Boetticher.

458
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:34,701
One night last month,
Boetticher opens the door

459
00:41:35,077 --> 00:41:39,331
takes a bullet to the face
from a person or persons unknown.

460
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:43,418
Now, this Gale Boetticher
is a bona fide chemistry genius.

461
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:46,630
I mean, he's got degrees
up the wazoo, right?

462
00:41:46,797 --> 00:41:51,093
And, well, as you might expect,
he's a nerd's nerd.

463
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,138
Vegan, sandals and socks kind of guy.

464
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:59,560
As it turns out, he's also
an A-number-one meth cook.

465
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:04,857
And what caught my eye
is his specialty product is blue.

466
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,109
So, what are you thinking?

467
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:08,652
This is your Heisenberg?

468
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:14,575
No. What I think we got here
is Heisenberg's former cook,

469
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:18,328
and maybe a line on Heisenberg himself.

470
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:25,043
Anyway, lo and behold,
amidst all the hippie-dippy nonsense

471
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:27,087
I find this.

472
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:31,300
Now, this here, I do a little Google-fu,

473
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:36,096
and I realize it's a parts number
specifically for this baby.

474
00:42:37,848 --> 00:42:43,645
That there is a high-volume
HEPA industrial air filtration system.

475
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:45,689
That's a 300,000-dollar gadget.

476
00:42:45,856 --> 00:42:50,152
Perfect for a pharmaceutical plant
or microchip factory,

477
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:55,407
or maybe the biggest meth lab
north of the border.

478
00:42:57,201 --> 00:42:58,994
Okay.

479
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:01,663
So this little dingus here
is manufactured

480
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:06,960
by a big international concern:
Madrigal Electromotive.

481
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:11,757
I call their Houston office, I get through
to the nicest little 20-year-old temp.

482
00:43:11,924 --> 00:43:16,011
I use the Schrader sweet-talk.
Before you know it, she's pulling files.

483
00:43:16,178 --> 00:43:21,600
Six months ago, one of these systems
was shipped to a depot here in ABQ.

484
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:23,810
Who signed for it?

485
00:43:24,228 --> 00:43:25,354
Gale Boetticher.

486
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:31,443
So I asked my new girlfriend, "Who
paid for it?" And she says, "Nobody."

487
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:36,573
They have no record that anybody
actually paid for this thing.

488
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:40,202
So I go back and push more
and before you know it

489
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:42,454
the temp's gone, there's no address.

490
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:46,625
I'm talking to some snot-nose lawyer
who's asking me for my badge number.

491
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:48,669
Brick wall.

492
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:53,632
So I take a peek
into Madrigal Electromotive.

493
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:56,385
Now, Madrigal
is based in Hanover, Germany,

494
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:59,304
but they're
what they call "highly diversified."

495
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:03,267
Industrial equipment, global shipping,
major construction,

496
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:07,729
and a tiny little foothold
in American fast food

497
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:10,315
specifically a local chain.

498
00:44:10,816 --> 00:44:12,526
Pollos Hermanos.

499
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:18,198
Okay. So what, right?
Boetticher's dead.

500
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:21,368
I got no line
on who's been bankrolling him,

501
00:44:21,535 --> 00:44:23,453
or where his lab was.

502
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,914
The whole thing's a snipe hunt, right?

503
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:30,168
But now I get this crazy idea,

504
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:32,671
and I can't shake it.

505
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:36,133
I mean, I stay up nights
staring at the ceiling

506
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,635
trying to make sense of it.
That napkin.

507
00:44:38,802 --> 00:44:40,470
I told you Boetticher's vegan.

508
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:44,016
We're talking this guy
makes his own fermented lentil bread,

509
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:46,393
or whatever the hell that is.

510
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:52,024
What's a vegan doing
in a fried chicken joint?

511
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,237
Maybe he's meeting somebody.

512
00:44:57,404 --> 00:44:59,156
Like who?

513
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,824
Well, like, maybe

514
00:45:03,744 --> 00:45:05,495
this guy.

515
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:12,878
I mean, what do we know
about Gustavo Fring, huh?

516
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:15,422
This whole
friend-of-law-enforcement thing?

517
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:18,841
Could be a case of, "keep your
friends close but your enemies closer."

518
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:21,094
He's got the money
to finance this operation.

519
00:45:21,178 --> 00:45:24,931
Maybe he's got the connections too.
Maybe, just maybe

520
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:26,767
he's our guy.

521
00:45:31,021 --> 00:45:34,733
Hank, no offense,
but I think you're really reaching.

522
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,195
If your guy had his meeting at KFC

523
00:45:38,362 --> 00:45:42,407
you wouldn't immediately assume
he's sitting down with Colonel Sanders.

524
00:45:42,574 --> 00:45:44,284
You know, I...

525
00:45:44,785 --> 00:45:47,079
I couldn't agree more, guys.

526
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:52,042
Gustavo Fring, blue meth, you know.

527
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:57,089
The whole thing is off-the-map nuts.

528
00:45:57,547 --> 00:46:00,509
I ought to be wearing a tinfoil hat,
you know?

529
00:46:02,094 --> 00:46:03,804
Except

530
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:08,850
I can't seem to wrap my mind
around this one little thing,

531
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:13,980
and that is,
what are Gustavo Fring's fingerprints

532
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:17,609
doing in Gale Boetticher's apartment?
