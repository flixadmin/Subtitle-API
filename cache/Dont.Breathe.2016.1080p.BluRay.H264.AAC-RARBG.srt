2
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,539
Are you sure you have the right keys?

3
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,059
Trust me, it's the right key.

4
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,619
Okay, then, open the door.

5
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,752
It shouldn't be taking so long, man.

6
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,855
20, 19, 18...

7
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:27,139
Rocky, those are very slow seconds.

8
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,246
- Yo, kill that already.
- 17, 16...

9
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:33,299
- Dude, come on.
- 15, 14, 13...

10
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,662
- This is what I'm talking about.
- 12, 11, 10, 9...

11
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,563
I told you this was gonna be fancy.

12
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,139
All right, so, just like last time.

13
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,099
No cash.
The total take has to fall below ten G's.

14
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,774
Yeah, yeah. Whatever, Judge Judy.

15
00:02:50,775 --> 00:02:52,801
- Come on.
- Let's do this.

16
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:26,044
<i>Okay, let's get out of here.</i>

17
00:04:01,142 --> 00:04:03,488
Hey, Rocky, did you hear
that Kopecky's moving away?

18
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:06,278
Everybody's leaving.

19
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,979
You know, if we keep hitting
houses like today's...

20
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,179
Rocky, and...

21
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,580
Bye-bye, Detroit.

22
00:04:13,581 --> 00:04:16,848
And hola, California.

23
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:20,007
Wait, wait.
You're going away, Rock?

24
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:22,876
Yeah, as soon as I can.

25
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,682
When are you,
when are you coming back?

26
00:04:27,645 --> 00:04:29,785
Never.

27
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:32,320
You should come with us.

28
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:33,496
Uh...

29
00:04:33,497 --> 00:04:35,125
What?

30
00:04:35,126 --> 00:04:36,819
Everyone else is gone.

31
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,802
I got my dad here.

32
00:04:40,774 --> 00:04:43,483
I'll miss you, then.

33
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,062
Dad?

34
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,382
You home?

35
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,119
Yo, this is it, man?

36
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,449
Minus my 40 percent.

37
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,919
Take it or leave it.

38
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,761
There's a fucking Rolex in there, bro.

39
00:06:05,762 --> 00:06:07,099
And what do you think...

40
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,651
I'm going to put it up
for auction at Sotheby's? Heh.

41
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:14,296
Do you know how much...

42
00:06:14,297 --> 00:06:16,979
people on the street pay
for a hot Rolex?

43
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,291
Heh. You want money?

44
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,663
Then steal money.

45
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:22,975
Fucking bullshit, bro.

46
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,104
Do you want this new tip or not?

47
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,439
All right, let's hear it.

48
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,159
<i>1837 Buena Vista Street.</i>

49
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,839
House is with
your dad's security company.

50
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,309
I already checked.

51
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,756
Guy who owns it
is an Army vet loner.

52
00:06:41,757 --> 00:06:42,999
No family.

53
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,279
Just him in the house.

54
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,719
That part of the city is a ghost town.

55
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,950
It looks like a dump.

56
00:06:46,951 --> 00:06:48,479
That's actually good news.

57
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,060
How's that good news?

58
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:51,439
The story goes...

59
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,576
some preppy girl
a few years ago...

60
00:06:53,577 --> 00:06:54,879
ran over this guy's daughter.

61
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,919
- Jesus.
- The daughter dies...

62
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,910
and this preppy,
rich-ass family...

63
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:01,359
pays him off...

64
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,999
gives him a big-ass sediment.

65
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,879
Settlement.

66
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,519
Blow me, Your Honor.

67
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,982
All right, this guy
is sitting on at least...

68
00:07:12,236 --> 00:07:13,910
300K.

69
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:15,691
Boom!

70
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:18,879
I mean, if I deliver
this stake to Raul, man...

71
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,732
he will shit his pants.

72
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:23,618
Do you think the money's
in the house?

73
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:24,794
I don't know.
Let's go find out.

74
00:07:24,795 --> 00:07:26,839
Guys, no.
We don't do cash.

75
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,359
Above ten K, it's major larceny.

76
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,959
That means ten years
if we get caught.

77
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,039
- We won't get caught.
- Okay, and then what?

78
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,839
That amount brings
a serious cop presence.

79
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,039
They'll do an investigation.

80
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,239
My dad could get in trouble.

81
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,982
I knew you'd bitch out, man.

82
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,117
I just knew it.

83
00:07:39,118 --> 00:07:43,746
Alex, if we do this right,
we never have to do it again.

84
00:07:49,237 --> 00:07:51,763
Where are you going?

85
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:54,307
We're not doing this one.

86
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,959
Seriously?

87
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,574
Give us the fucking keys, man.

88
00:07:58,575 --> 00:08:00,761
- We'll fucking do it.
- Alex!

89
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,159
"Gulf War veteran reaches
six-figure settlement."

90
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,461
Six-figure settlement.

91
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:44,923
All right.

92
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,399
<i>The suspect was leaving...</i>

93
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,178
<i>the rear entrance of the club.</i>

94
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:57,161
<i>Are you done, Eddy'?</i>

95
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,318
Be a doll and get your mother...

96
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:03,119
a large four-cheese from Tony's.

97
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,219
- So Trevor's living here now?
- Don't be a bitch, Roxanne.

98
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,016
It's just a few months
till he can find a new job.

99
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,139
You have no money in here.

100
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,168
You pay for it then.

101
00:09:14,392 --> 00:09:17,021
I know you're making money.

102
00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:22,319
I'm done.

103
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,759
Your lips look sore.

104
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,627
That's how you're making
your cash out there?

105
00:09:27,628 --> 00:09:30,769
Ha, ha. Huh?

106
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,598
Okay, Diddy,
let's go for a walk.

107
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,591
I want to go to the beach.

108
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:41,825
Yeah, well,
it's not summer, monkeyhead.

109
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:44,519
I want to be a surfer.

110
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,230
There's no surf in Michigan.

111
00:09:48,852 --> 00:09:53,677
- Not fair.
- Yeah, well...

112
00:09:54,425 --> 00:09:57,295
some things
you can't change, baby.

113
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:59,113
No matter how unfair they are.

114
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:01,937
What a bummer.

115
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:05,788
OK. LET'S DO THIS

116
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:08,817
Hey, you know
where there is surf?

117
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:11,559
California.

118
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,462
What do you say
you and I move there together?

119
00:10:13,463 --> 00:10:15,444
Would you like that?

120
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,862
Okay.

121
00:10:16,863 --> 00:10:19,169
I promise then.

122
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,799
Is that a new tattoo?

123
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,079
Yeah.

124
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,055
I got it last night.

125
00:11:41,056 --> 00:11:43,547
- Ls it a...?
- Ladybug.

126
00:11:43,548 --> 00:11:45,696
Why a ladybug?

127
00:11:50,465 --> 00:11:52,456
What?

128
00:11:53,686 --> 00:11:57,245
When my dad left,
my mom started drinking...

129
00:11:57,246 --> 00:11:59,959
and she told me that...

130
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,625
my dad's leaving was all my fault.

131
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,389
And I missed him a lot, so I'd cry.

132
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,418
She got so fed up with the crying...

133
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:14,613
that she would lock me
in the trunk of her car.

134
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:17,915
Sometimes for hours.

135
00:12:19,003 --> 00:12:21,792
But there was this, um...

136
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,639
A little hole in the trunk...

137
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,890
and one time a ladybug flew in...

138
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:29,779
kept me company.

139
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,260
It made me feel safe.

140
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,055
When I reach California,
I'm gonna color this tat...

141
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:39,402
and that's the last time
I will mark my body.

142
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,469
If we get this money,
I'm going away with you guys.

143
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,152
I know you will.

144
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,399
At least four blocks around,
houses aren't occupied.

145
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,195
No people means
no Five-0 on patrol.

146
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:09,383
It's gonna be a piece of cake.

147
00:13:09,384 --> 00:13:10,439
The guy's a shut-in...

148
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,710
hasn't left his house
in, like, five days.

149
00:13:12,711 --> 00:13:14,180
I say we do it with him
in the house.

150
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:16,526
I'll get a chloro-bomb.

151
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:17,807
Oh, shit!

152
00:13:17,808 --> 00:13:18,919
- Jesus.
- Fucking A.

153
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,917
Get off my fucking car, dog shit!

154
00:13:29,238 --> 00:13:31,208
Shit, that's our guy.

155
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,486
Wait, is he blind?

156
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,519
He lost his sight in Iraq or something.

157
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,554
That's kind of fucked up
to rob a blind guy, isn't it?

158
00:13:46,555 --> 00:13:49,855
Just because he's blind don't
mean he's a fucking saint, bro.

159
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,941
We do this tonight.

160
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,113
The whole neighborhood
is fucking empty.

161
00:14:21,138 --> 00:14:24,518
This guy's the last man standing.

162
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,239
The lights are out.

163
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,965
He must be asleep.

164
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,359
He's blind.

165
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,587
Lights off doesn't mean anything.

166
00:14:32,612 --> 00:14:33,933
It's 2 a.m.

167
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,124
He's sleeping.

168
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,663
Let's take care
of that dog first, yeah?

169
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,803
Come on, man.

170
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:16,695
He's chewing it.

171
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,985
It'll be lights out in a sec.

172
00:15:24,976 --> 00:15:27,166
There's four locks.
You got the other keys?

173
00:15:27,191 --> 00:15:30,239
- I only have the one.
- Ah. Fuck me.

174
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,550
Why wouldn't he give backup
keys to the security company?

175
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:35,856
Because the money's in there...

176
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:38,559
and the paranoid fuck
doesn't trust nobody.

177
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:41,248
Let's check for a side door.

178
00:16:17,072 --> 00:16:19,542
Sweet dreams, pup.

179
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,487
What's that?

180
00:16:43,512 --> 00:16:44,991
We just have to point this
in the general direction...

181
00:16:45,016 --> 00:16:47,317
of the master keypad,
and it'll kill the alarm.

182
00:16:47,342 --> 00:16:50,452
Okay, open the fucking door, Dexter.

183
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:55,448
Yes. 
Got it.

184
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:56,915
Shit.

185
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,239
What's wrong?

186
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,346
It won't open.

187
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,890
This guy isn't messing around.

188
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:15,964
There's a bolt here.

189
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:18,055
I can feel it.

190
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,759
- Come on.
- That's too loud.

191
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,583
- That's too loud.
- Fucking stop.

192
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:26,705
What about that window?

193
00:17:27,048 --> 00:17:28,176
There's no bars on it.

194
00:17:28,201 --> 00:17:30,279
- I can fit in there.
- What?

195
00:17:30,304 --> 00:17:32,662
No, we're not sending you
in there alone.

196
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,639
Nobody's sending me anywhere.

197
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,850
I'm going myself.

198
00:17:39,238 --> 00:17:41,130
Help me up.

199
00:17:41,155 --> 00:17:42,255
Here, Rocky.

200
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,263
You only got 30 seconds.

201
00:17:43,288 --> 00:17:44,423
Okay.

202
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,565
Here. Come here.

203
00:19:50,316 --> 00:19:51,835
Slow your roll, fool.

204
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,888
She must have got it by now.
She's fine.

205
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:57,000
Yeah, like you really give a fuck.

206
00:19:57,025 --> 00:19:58,824
What'd you say?

207
00:19:59,994 --> 00:20:01,113
That's my bitch in there.

208
00:20:01,138 --> 00:20:03,217
Of course I give a fuck.

209
00:20:04,491 --> 00:20:06,195
Let me give you some advice.

210
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,359
Be a good friend...

211
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,386
and stay in the fucking
friend zone, all right?

212
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:15,370
Are you okay?

213
00:20:15,395 --> 00:20:16,835
Yes.

214
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,700
Shoes off.

215
00:21:03,418 --> 00:21:05,824
- What the fuck?
- Hey.

216
00:21:53,971 --> 00:21:55,751
Hey. Hey.

217
00:21:55,776 --> 00:21:57,299

What the fuck, dude?

The guy's gassed out.

252
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,713
He's out.

253
00:24:57,738 --> 00:24:58,897
He's in Sleeping Beauty mode.

254
00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:00,961
- It's fine.
- Guys.

255
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,336
That's a big-ass lock.

256
00:25:07,361 --> 00:25:09,774
If the money's in the house...

257
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,019
probably in there.

258
00:25:12,121 --> 00:25:14,280
You think you can crack it open?

259
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:16,484
Yeah, I got this.

260
00:25:25,854 --> 00:25:27,786
Fuck.

261
00:25:30,981 --> 00:25:32,640
Jesus.

262
00:25:34,348 --> 00:25:35,939
Do you have anything else?

263
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,459
Yeah.

264
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,315
Yeah, yeah.

265
00:25:39,595 --> 00:25:42,342
I've got a more powerful tool.

266
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,432
What the hell is that?

267
00:25:44,457 --> 00:25:46,833
It's a nine millimeter Beretta.

268
00:25:46,858 --> 00:25:48,560
Gangster-style, bitches.

269
00:25:48,585 --> 00:25:50,578
Why did you bring a gun?

270
00:25:50,603 --> 00:25:51,979
This is a soldier's house, Alex.

271
00:25:52,004 --> 00:25:53,386
Like I'm gonna come in here
without some chrome.

272
00:25:53,411 --> 00:25:56,450
Money, you've never shot a gun before.

273
00:25:56,475 --> 00:25:58,754
Yeah, well, it's time
to pop that cherry, baby.

274
00:25:58,779 --> 00:26:00,835
Because I'm going to pop that
shit like a fucking tuna can.

275
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,174
Do you have any idea
what bringing a gun...

276
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:03,438
to a burglary means?

277
00:26:03,463 --> 00:26:05,291
Yeah, it gives me...

278
00:26:05,316 --> 00:26:07,355
a better chance
to defend myself, Alex.

279
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,389
No, it means
you just gave this guy...

280
00:26:08,414 --> 00:26:10,773
the legal right to shoot us.

281
00:26:11,566 --> 00:26:13,114
Rocky, let's go.

282
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:15,313
No, no, no, no.
I think we should stay.

283
00:26:15,338 --> 00:26:18,129
We have to leave.
This is not good.

284
00:26:19,557 --> 00:26:20,739
You don't really think just because...

285
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,259
you jerk off
to her Instagram selfies...

286
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,877
that makes you a Romeo?

287
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,307
Think again, bitch.

288
00:26:40,794 --> 00:26:42,959
Fuck, I'm so out.

289
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:46,656
Alex.

290
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:03,882
Who's there?

291
00:27:15,714 --> 00:27:18,146
Okay, man, just chill, all right?

292
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,798
Look, um...

293
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:23,155
I was wasted...

294
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,685
and I wandered in,
so that was my bad, all right?

295
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,275
So, I'm just gonna...

296
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,512
I'm just gonna leave, okay?

297
00:27:42,665 --> 00:27:45,707
Stay right fucking there.

298
00:27:45,732 --> 00:27:48,202
Don't you fucking move.

299
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,855
Yeah, that's right.

300
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,319
I know what's in there,
and I ain't leaving without it.

301
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,919
You got me?

302
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,809
Now, you do as I say, all right?

303
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:02,802
Don't take one single step,
all right? Huh?

304
00:28:06,336 --> 00:28:08,620
Well, do you hear me or what?

305
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:11,359
What, are you blind and deaf
all of a sudden?

306
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,903
Huh?

307
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:15,455
Motherfucker, I said stop.

308
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,966
I think you fucking heard me.

309
00:28:17,991 --> 00:28:20,734
- Sorry.
- Don't you move.

310
00:28:20,862 --> 00:28:22,341
What the fuck are you doing,
you old man?

311
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:24,511
I'll fucking shoot you.

312
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:28,401
Don't you fucking test me.

313
00:28:34,143 --> 00:28:36,373
You're a fucking pussy.

314
00:28:37,326 --> 00:28:39,885
What are you gonna do now,
huh? Huh?

315
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,944
You better fucking stop.
 Stop!

316
00:28:52,626 --> 00:28:55,574
Don't make me fucking kill you, man.

317
00:29:02,877 --> 00:29:04,403
Please.

318
00:29:04,432 --> 00:29:05,831
Please.

319
00:29:05,856 --> 00:29:09,219
Please, just let me walk.

320
00:29:09,763 --> 00:29:13,000
Let me walk.
Leave me alive.

321
00:29:15,705 --> 00:29:17,741
Please.

322
00:29:17,766 --> 00:29:20,177
How many of you are there?

323
00:29:20,202 --> 00:29:21,434
What?

324
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,861
How many?

325
00:29:29,991 --> 00:29:31,089
It's just me, man...

326
00:29:31,124 --> 00:29:34,003
all right? It's just fucking me.
Just let me go!

327
00:29:34,028 --> 00:29:36,737
Please let me go.

328
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,837
Please.

329
00:29:43,514 --> 00:29:46,123
Just let me go.

330
00:29:50,044 --> 00:29:53,053
Okay. Okay.

331
00:29:53,078 --> 00:29:54,769
Okay.

332
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:57,145
Okay, I swear to God...

333
00:35:26,356 --> 00:35:28,755
Rocky, hey, are you okay?

334
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,370
Are you okay?

335
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,650
Maybe... Maybe we should...

336
00:35:32,675 --> 00:35:34,315
call the cops before he does.

337
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,459
We'll come clean...

338
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,128
Wait.

339
00:35:39,255 --> 00:35:40,789
What?

340
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,152
Oh, my God.

341
00:36:24,628 --> 00:36:26,403
There's a lot more
than 300 grand in there.

342
00:36:26,428 --> 00:36:29,535
That's got to be
about a million dollars.

343
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,018
Okay, let's get out of here.

344
00:36:40,251 --> 00:36:43,319
The storm cellar door.
The door's bolted from the inside.

345
00:36:43,344 --> 00:36:45,336
That could be our way out.

346
00:36:45,929 --> 00:36:47,419
Let's go.

347
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,008
Let's go.

348
00:39:45,378 --> 00:39:46,915
This way.

349
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,491
What?

350
00:39:49,516 --> 00:39:52,148
Oh, shit.
The phone died.

351
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,634
Oh, fuck.

352
00:40:44,282 --> 00:40:45,996
Hmm.

353
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,543
Hmm.

354
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,459
- Where's the door?
- I don't know.

355
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,610
Where is it? 
Do you see it?

356
00:42:26,966 --> 00:42:30,906
Please help me! 
Please!

357
00:42:30,931 --> 00:42:33,667
We need to get the fuck
out of here right now.

358
00:42:33,692 --> 00:42:36,139
Come on. 
Let's go.

359
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,371
Look, the door's right here.

360
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,859
Look! 
Look at it!

361
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:45,001
Please!

362
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,870
What?

363
00:42:49,292 --> 00:42:51,766
Rocky? 
Rocky.

364
00:42:52,104 --> 00:42:53,509
Rocky, listen, listen.

365
00:42:53,534 --> 00:42:54,570
Hey, that's our exit.

366
00:42:54,595 --> 00:42:56,914
The door's right fucking there.
We can leave right now.

367
00:42:56,939 --> 00:42:58,714
No, no, no, no!

368
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,941
She's the one
who killed his daughter.

369
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,648
We have to get her out of here.

370
00:43:10,673 --> 00:43:12,935
No, no, no.
Rocky, we don't have time.

371
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,620
We'll... We'll get out of here,
and we'll call the cops...

372
00:43:14,645 --> 00:43:16,148
and then they'll
come find her, all right?

373
00:43:16,173 --> 00:43:17,554
The safe! The safe!

374
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:20,260
There's the safe!

375
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:01,915
The code from the safe upstairs.

376
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,139
- You remember it?
- Um...

377
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,531
2978, 78, 78, 2978.

378
00:44:05,556 --> 00:44:07,961
2-9-7-8.

379
00:44:07,986 --> 00:44:09,586
Oh...

380
00:44:09,962 --> 00:44:12,037
Okay, got them.

381
00:44:14,934 --> 00:44:16,533
He's coming.

382
00:44:17,356 --> 00:44:19,936
- Hurry up.
- Okay, one more, one more.

383
00:44:19,961 --> 00:44:21,771
Fuck, fuck!

384
00:44:21,806 --> 00:44:24,703
I almost have it.
Almost... okay.

385
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:27,900
I don't care what you did.
I'll get you out of here.

386
00:44:27,925 --> 00:44:30,534
Go, go, go!

387
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:45,179
- There's the door.
- There it is.

388
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:50,678
Are you okay?

389
00:44:50,703 --> 00:44:52,188
Okay.

390
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:00,239
What's wrong?

391
00:45:02,224 --> 00:45:03,619
What's wrong?

392
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,702
It's locked.

393
00:45:04,727 --> 00:45:07,926
You have the keys.
Don't you have the keys?

394
00:45:09,147 --> 00:45:10,346
Fuck.

395
00:45:10,371 --> 00:45:11,406
One of these should open it.

396
00:45:11,431 --> 00:45:12,827
Come on.

397
00:45:15,508 --> 00:45:16,956
Come on.

398
00:45:17,345 --> 00:45:19,531
- Come on.
- Okay.

399
00:45:24,198 --> 00:45:26,062
Oh, yes.

400
00:45:30,386 --> 00:45:31,970
Come on.

401
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,498
He shot her.

402
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,009
No...

403
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:09,664
Oh.

404
00:47:13,065 --> 00:47:14,505
No!

405
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,460
No!

406
00:47:18,726 --> 00:47:21,469
Oh! Oh! Oh!

407
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,902
My baby.

408
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,701
No!

409
00:47:37,382 --> 00:47:39,390
No!

410
00:47:40,344 --> 00:47:42,534
No!

411
00:48:24,755 --> 00:48:26,946
We have to go back upstairs.

412
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,479
Yeah, listen.

413
00:48:28,504 --> 00:48:29,758
Listen, okay?

414
00:48:29,783 --> 00:48:32,097
These keys, they match
the locks on the front door.

415
00:48:32,098 --> 00:48:33,154
All right?

416
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:35,835
If we get up there,
we can get out.

417
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,450
Okay?

418
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:49,471
Let's go now.

419
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,675
Shit.

420
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,021
Alex?

421
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:44,919
Rocky?

422
00:51:04,607 --> 00:51:06,698
Please don't...

423
00:51:10,478 --> 00:51:12,897
No, please...

424
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,859
Rocky?

425
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:37,441
Alex! Alex.

426
00:51:37,466 --> 00:51:38,571
Rocky, Rocky.

427
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:39,669
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.

428
00:51:39,694 --> 00:51:41,518
This way. This way, come on.

429
00:51:41,543 --> 00:51:43,108
This way, come on, come on, come on.

430
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:44,463
Okay.

431
00:51:44,488 --> 00:51:46,972
Oh, come on. Where am I?

432
00:51:46,997 --> 00:51:48,276
Where is it?

433
00:51:48,301 --> 00:51:50,180
Light. 
I see light!

434
00:51:50,205 --> 00:51:51,920
Come on, come on.

435
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,419
Don't...

436
00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:13,139
run.

437
00:52:16,203 --> 00:52:17,993
Rocky...

438
00:52:20,829 --> 00:52:23,025
go to the door.

439
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:25,173
Try the blue key.

440
00:52:25,459 --> 00:52:27,606
- Do it.
- Okay.

441
00:52:28,956 --> 00:52:30,140
Easy.

442
00:52:30,165 --> 00:52:31,944
Easy, buddy.

443
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,387
Fuck.

444
00:52:41,122 --> 00:52:43,108
- Rocky?
- Yeah.

445
00:52:44,113 --> 00:52:46,552
- Come on.
- Easy, buddy.

446
00:52:46,577 --> 00:52:48,717
Easy...

447
00:52:49,363 --> 00:52:51,264
It's okay.

448
00:52:52,882 --> 00:52:56,015
Okay, that's a good boy.
That's good.

449
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,402
All right.

450
00:52:57,427 --> 00:53:01,949
That's...
That's good. That's good.

451
00:53:01,974 --> 00:53:03,635
Oh. Fuck.

452
00:53:05,996 --> 00:53:07,661
Rocky! Rocky.
Run, now. Go, go, go!

453
00:53:07,686 --> 00:53:11,156
Upstairs, now. Go. Go, go!

454
00:53:12,167 --> 00:53:13,970
Go!
Hurry, hurry!

455
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:15,958
Go!

456
00:53:16,182 --> 00:53:17,950
There's a door! 
Come on!

457
00:53:18,675 --> 00:53:20,133
Let's go.

458
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,082
Hey, move this.

459
00:53:22,107 --> 00:53:23,386
Come on.

460
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:30,478
Damn.

461
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,599
- Are those blocked up too?
- Yeah.

462
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:36,542
We're trapped in here.

463
00:53:56,993 --> 00:53:59,455
Rocky, the remote.
Do you have it with you?

464
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,507
Come on. 
Okay.

465
00:54:01,749 --> 00:54:03,340
- What are you doing?
- I'm pressing the panic button.

466
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,317
If I manage to get in range,
the system will call 911...

467
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,802
- and the police will come.
- No. Wait, we can't go to jail.

468
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,318
No. No, we won't. 
Okay?

469
00:54:09,343 --> 00:54:11,475
This is robbery
versus kidnapping and murder.

470
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,777
The police won't care about us...

471
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,199
or why we were here
in the first place.

472
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,703
We would have helped them
get this guy.

473
00:54:15,728 --> 00:54:18,028
But then we wouldn't
keep the money.

474
00:54:19,538 --> 00:54:22,173
- We need to get out of this room.
- Up there.

475
00:54:26,433 --> 00:54:27,860
Go!

476
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,599
Alex!

477
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,379
What are you doing? 
Go!

478
00:54:57,178 --> 00:54:58,990
No! 
No, no!

479
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,822
Oh!

480
00:59:53,561 --> 00:59:54,953
Hey!

481
00:59:57,570 --> 00:59:59,541
Huh, huh!

482
01:01:06,823 --> 01:01:08,924
Ah...

483
01:02:20,258 --> 01:02:21,855
Ah.

484
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,550
Please, let me go.

485
01:04:29,344 --> 01:04:31,714
Please, let me go!

486
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:37,272
I...

487
01:04:37,297 --> 01:04:39,039
I understand you.

488
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:40,834
She killed your daughter.

489
01:04:40,859 --> 01:04:42,435
You wanted her to pay.

490
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:43,839
I understand that.

491
01:04:43,864 --> 01:04:45,379
I won't tell anyone.

492
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:48,248
You understand nothing.

493
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,364
Only a parent could know the...

494
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:56,712
bond between a father
and his child.

495
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:02,804
She should have
gone to prison, but...

496
01:05:02,829 --> 01:05:05,891
rich girls don't go to jail.

497
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:12,261
None of this is going
to bring your daughter back.

498
01:05:17,399 --> 01:05:20,068
That's not really true.

499
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:28,553
Cindy took my child
away from me.

500
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:32,068
I thought...

501
01:05:33,383 --> 01:05:35,940
it's only fair...

502
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,552
that she give me a new one.

503
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,983
She was pregnant with my baby.

504
01:05:50,059 --> 01:05:52,507
You killed them both.

505
01:05:52,916 --> 01:05:54,635
- No.
- Well, they would be alive...

506
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:58,006
if you hadn't broken
into my home.

507
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:01,729
No.

508
01:06:10,962 --> 01:06:13,471
You have to be held accountable.

509
01:08:22,357 --> 01:08:24,020
Please.

510
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:28,126
Please, God.

511
01:08:28,151 --> 01:08:29,915
God?

512
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:32,267
There's no God.

513
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,708
It's a joke.

514
01:08:37,136 --> 01:08:40,066
It's a bad joke.

515
01:08:40,091 --> 01:08:45,372
You tell me what God
would allow this.

516
01:08:48,859 --> 01:08:50,512
What are you doing?

517
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,192
I'm not a rapist.

518
01:08:58,083 --> 01:09:00,792
I never forced myself on her.

519
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:02,715
Stop.

520
01:09:03,619 --> 01:09:05,279
I promised I would set her free...

521
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:08,487
just as soon
as she gave me a child.

522
01:09:14,176 --> 01:09:16,795
But now she's gone.

523
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:19,255
But I'm done waiting.

524
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:24,008
Ah! 
No. No, no.

525
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,828
You can't do this to me.

526
01:09:59,853 --> 01:10:01,772
There's nothing a man cannot do...

527
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:05,693
once he accepts the fact
that there is no God.

528
01:10:06,347 --> 01:10:07,711
No!

529
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:09,852
No. 
No, no, no, no!

530
01:10:09,877 --> 01:10:11,666
No!

531
01:10:12,491 --> 01:10:13,801
No!

532
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:15,886
You're strong.

533
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,192
You're young.

534
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:21,300
You'll breed well.

535
01:10:21,325 --> 01:10:23,515
No. 
Get away from me.

536
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:27,148
No!
 No!

537
01:10:27,173 --> 01:10:29,509
No!

538
01:10:31,344 --> 01:10:34,015
No...

539
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:36,998
Stop.

540
01:10:37,023 --> 01:10:39,055
Shh, Shh, shh.

541
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,017
Nine months...

542
01:10:41,042 --> 01:10:43,670
and I will give you
your life back.

543
01:11:22,796 --> 01:11:24,762
Are you okay?

544
01:11:24,787 --> 01:11:26,336
Rocky. 
Okay, yeah.

545
01:11:26,361 --> 01:11:28,456
Rocky, did he...?
Did he hurt you?

546
01:11:28,481 --> 01:11:30,076
Rocky?

547
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:34,400
You fucking bastard.

548
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,013
Fuck you!

549
01:11:47,699 --> 01:11:49,615
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, Rocky. Rocky.

550
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:52,153
Rocky. Rocky, it's over.
Come on.

551
01:11:52,856 --> 01:11:54,854
How's that taste?

552
01:11:59,589 --> 01:12:01,934
- Now what?
- Come on.

553
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:12,779
You're going to rot in prison
for what you've done.

554
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:15,535
Rocky, we can't
involve the cops now.

555
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,109
If we steal a million in cash...

556
01:12:17,134 --> 01:12:19,635
and then lead the cops here,
he'll tell them about us.

557
01:12:19,776 --> 01:12:21,179
Our blood is all over.

558
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:23,239
They'll get to us in a second.

559
01:12:23,292 --> 01:12:25,983
You got what you came for.

560
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:30,557
Now take it.

561
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:33,175
Get out of my house!

562
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,359
Look, he's buying our silence.

563
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,830
He needs us to take the money.

564
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,273
It's one or the other.

565
01:12:44,914 --> 01:12:47,382
Whatever you choose,
I'm with you.

566
01:12:56,627 --> 01:12:58,808
- Okay.
- This one.

567
01:12:59,091 --> 01:13:01,079
Let's get out of here.

568
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,559
I need to find the key.

569
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,009
All right.

570
01:13:07,157 --> 01:13:08,956
That key won't...

571
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:11,803
I got it.

572
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:03,351
You're worthless out here.

573
01:14:07,645 --> 01:14:09,018
Fuck.

574
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,067
Shit!

575
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:41,435
Fuck.

576
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:43,325
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

577
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:45,409
Ah, fuck!

578
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:51,714
I'm sorry, Alex.

579
01:18:51,865 --> 01:18:54,063
I'm so sorry.

580
01:19:31,754 --> 01:19:33,334
No!

581
01:19:34,055 --> 01:19:35,880
Don't!

582
01:19:36,748 --> 01:19:39,874
Ah, no...

583
01:19:39,899 --> 01:19:42,834
No. 
Ah...

584
01:19:52,611 --> 01:19:54,815
Ah! 
Don't...

585
01:20:10,227 --> 01:20:11,605
No.

586
01:21:57,488 --> 01:21:59,227
What is that?

587
01:21:59,693 --> 01:22:03,437
You and me at the beach.

588
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,359
Train service to Los Angeles...

589
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:11,981
<i>will be boarding shortly

590
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,719
<i>This house

591
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:16,639
<i>belongs to a retired Army vet...</i>
