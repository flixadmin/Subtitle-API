There's an intruder in my house.

Super light?

247
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,619
It's a multispectrum ultraviolet laser
enhanced scanner...

248
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:27,706
...that detects molecular schisms
in the 600-megavolt range...

249

was easier to say.

that night...

271

would've generated enough flashes...

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,266
I sent Sherry to the movies.

342
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:35,895
Trust me, the best show in town
is gonna be in here tonight.

343
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:38,439
So you can get actual photographs
from this thing?

344
00:20:38,648 --> 00:20:41,859
The science is solid.
It works exactly like an old film camera.

345
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:45,363
I developed the mirror backing,
and fortunately for us...

346
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:47,948
...the lightning went off
about 10 times that night.

347
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,867
-Multiple exposures.
-Now you're getting it.

348
00:20:51,076 --> 00:20:54,788
I went ahead and enhanced them digitally,
and just for kicks...

349
00:20:54,996 --> 00:20:58,041
...decided to extrapolate a 3D hologram
from the original 2D.

350
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,168
-Cisco.
-Lights...

351
00:21:01,962 --> 00:21:05,799
...camera, action.

352
00:21:06,675 --> 00:21:08,218
Wow.

353
00:21:26,528 --> 00:21:29,281
Can you play it again, slower?

354
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:34,077
There, there. You see that?

00:21:41,376 --> 00:21:42,960
Next frame.

356
00:21:56,891 --> 00:21:59,018
This wallpaper is new.

00:22:01,937 --> 00:22:03,355
Oh, man.

358
00:22:04,482 --> 00:22:05,816
Is that blood?

359
00:22:07,276 --> 00:22:09,945
We had a husband holding
the same weapon that killed his wife.

360
00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:12,239
We weren't looking for any other suspects.

361
00:22:12,448 --> 00:22:16,368
That blood belongs to one of the two
speedsters that was here that night.

362
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:18,871
Maybe the one that killed Nora.

363
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,873
I'll get a sample kit.

364
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,543

00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,926
-That's great.
BARRY: Linda.

-Hey.
-Hey.

367
00:22:33,927 --> 00:22:36,429
-So I hope it's cool that I came by.
-Yeah, of course.

368
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:38,640
I was just writing a column
on the Combines.

369
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,308
Oh, sweet, how are they doing?

370
00:22:40,517 --> 00:22:45,896
Well, they were up two goals to none
last night, but then they blew it.

371
00:22:46,563 --> 00:22:50,818
Wait, we're not talking about
hockey anymore, are we?

372
00:22:51,026 --> 00:22:52,402
No, we're not.

373
00:22:52,611 --> 00:22:56,572
Look, I'm so, so sorry that I left you like that.

374
00:22:56,781 --> 00:22:58,616
I'm not that kind of guy.

375
00:22:58,825 --> 00:23:02,495
Well, let me tell you what kind of girl I am.

376
00:23:02,703 --> 00:23:04,997
I work in a hard business
and I work hard in it...

377
00:23:05,206 --> 00:23:08,918
...and so I'm very picky about who I choose
to spend my free time with.

378
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:11,420
I chose to spend some of it with you...

379
00:23:11,629 --> 00:23:14,882
...so tell me, Barry Allen,
did I make the right choice?

380
00:23:15,091 --> 00:23:18,844
Yeah, you did, it's just that
something important came up.

381
00:23:19,052 --> 00:23:24,015
Not more important than you, just sort of
an equal-level-of-importance type situation.

I have to go to work. I'm so sorry.

It's a police emergency.

Can we talk later tonight?

388
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,242
I'm not going anywhere, yet.

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,286
Okay, thanks.

-Hi.

Sorry, gotta go. Uh, hey, what's up?

00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:52,583
Bye. Ha, ha.

393
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,459
Hey, can I ask you a question?

394
00:23:54,668 --> 00:23:56,795
-Yeah, sure.
-So...

395
00:23:57,004 --> 00:24:01,091
-...you and Barry are like BFFs, right?
-The best of BFFs.

396
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,635
Has he ever actually dated anyone before?

397
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:08,473
Because he's simultaneously surprisingly
good at it, and really, really bad at it.

398
00:24:08,682 --> 00:24:12,227
I don't know. He's Barry.

399
00:24:12,394 --> 00:24:13,937
What was his last girlfriend like?

400
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:16,732
You know, he hasn't really had a girlfriend
in a while.

401
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,276
I don't know, maybe he's just not ready yet.

402
00:24:20,484 --> 00:24:21,694
What do you mean?

403
00:24:21,903 --> 00:24:26,657
You know, I mean, he was into someone,
an unrequited-love thing.

404
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:29,952
You know, he had feelings for someone...

405
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:32,830
...and they weren't really reciprocated, so....

406
00:24:33,581 --> 00:24:35,333
Yeah, maybe just give him time.

407
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,044
Sure.

408
00:24:42,005 --> 00:24:46,259
There he is. Looks like the tracker
Barry placed on him worked.

RONNIE: I don't know.

I hear the other inside of me,
and he wants to go home to her.

But we can't.

You could-- You could never decide.

422

from Ronnie's body using nuclear fission.

-What do you think?
WELLS: What do I think?

433
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:24,268
Is it possible? Theoretically.

434
00:26:24,476 --> 00:26:28,313
Splitting an atom and splitting a man
are two very different things.

to point out you're all staring.

00:26:39,824 --> 00:26:41,324
It is remarkable.

I feel clearer than I have since the accident.

00:26:44,578 --> 00:26:47,414
-What did you give me?
WELLS: A cocktail of antipsychotics.

Depressants, mood stabilizers.

00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:53,712
The same formula used to treat
dissociative identity disorder.

00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:57,776
I can feel him, though.

511
00:30:58,402 --> 00:31:00,194
I have these memories.

512
00:31:00,403 --> 00:31:03,531
Memories that I know aren't my own.

513
00:31:03,698 --> 00:31:06,242
One is particularly strong.

514
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:09,161
Piedmont State Park,
it's famous for the Hudson Falls.

515
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:16,042
I know that I've never been,
but I can remember those waterfalls perfectly.

516
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,587
That's where Ronnie proposed to me.

517
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,632
He loves you very much.

518
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:25,634
That, I can feel.

519
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:31,223
WELLS:
<i>Dr. Snow, can we see you for a minute?</i>

520
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:33,058
Excuse me.

521
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:40,649
-You okay?
-Yeah, it's just confusing.

522
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:43,569
What isn't confusing
is what's happening to him now.

523
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:48,574 X1:0
Ronnie's body is rejecting Stein's atoms
like a host rejecting a parasite.

524
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:52,453
The resulting instability
is causing an exothermic reaction.

525
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:55,789
I worry, if his temperature
continues to rise...

526
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:57,791
...it'll set off a chain reaction.

527
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,127
And then what happens?

528
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,506
He could go nuclear.

529
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:13,849
Ronnie.

530
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,059
Not Ronnie.

531
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,103
-Martin Stein.
-Cisco Ramon.

532
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,774
Your colleagues are in the next room,
not so subtly discussing my condition.

533
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,655
That's not freaky at all.

534
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:34,285
It seems Ronnie's fight with the Flash
has exacerbated the Firestorm matrix.

535
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,120
It's unstable.

536
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:40,040
It's exponentially increasing the rate
of fission inside his body.

537
00:32:40,248 --> 00:32:42,459
How long does he have?

538
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:45,879
If his temperature keeps rising
at the current pace...

539
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,214
...no more than a couple of hours.

540
00:32:48,422 --> 00:32:52,093
But you can fix it, right? I mean,
you can separate them before it's too late?

541
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:56,305
Any attempt we make to separate
the two of them could be catastrophic.

542
00:32:56,514 --> 00:32:58,557
A nuclear explosion.

543
00:32:59,308 --> 00:33:03,229
And a nuclear explosion of this magnitude
would level this entire city.

544
00:33:03,396 --> 00:33:05,188
Unless...

545
00:33:05,897 --> 00:33:07,232
Unless what?

546
00:33:07,816 --> 00:33:10,443
Unless the host body
were no longer functional.

547
00:33:12,153 --> 00:33:13,613
You wanna kill Ronnie?

548
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,116
No, I don't wanna kill Ronnie.

549
00:33:16,324 --> 00:33:19,202
But in this scenario,
Ronnie is the host body.

550
00:33:19,369 --> 00:33:22,497
If you kill Ronnie, you kill Stein.
That's two people.

551
00:33:22,664 --> 00:33:25,125
I don't know how else to stop it.

552
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:28,710
And my guess is
that if Ronnie and Professor Stein...

553
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:31,255
...knew the consequences that
we were all facing...

554
00:33:31,463 --> 00:33:33,173
...they would make the same decision.

555
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,635
It's two lives for millions.

556
00:33:40,012 --> 00:33:41,514
Can you give us a minute?

557
00:33:48,771 --> 00:33:51,232
-Caitlin--
CAITLIN: I've already lost Ronnie once.

558
00:33:51,441 --> 00:33:54,152
I'm not gonna do it again.

559
00:33:55,111 --> 00:33:57,613
You said we have a couple of hours.

560
00:33:57,822 --> 00:33:59,740
Use them.

561
00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:09,666
Dr. Wells, you don't really
think we should kill Ronnie, do you?

562
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,835
Stay here, Cisco.

563
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:22,304
BARRY:
Hey.

564
00:34:23,221 --> 00:34:24,681
Sorry.

565
00:34:26,141 --> 00:34:27,559
Can I get you anything, or...?

566
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:32,730
A glass of Chateau Haut-Brion
Pessac-Leognan 1982 might be nice.

567
00:34:33,814 --> 00:34:35,441
Or maybe it wouldn't.

568
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:39,820
This body's taste buds
would obviously be different from my own.

569
00:34:40,029 --> 00:34:42,364
Perhaps I'm now a light beer man.

570
00:34:43,032 --> 00:34:44,950
There are worse things to be.

571
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:47,536
You mean like a living nuclear bomb?

572
00:34:49,371 --> 00:34:50,455
You know.

573
00:34:50,663 --> 00:34:55,543
Unstable nuclear fission was always a danger
in the transmutation process.

574
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:58,213
Plus, you all argue very loudly.

575
00:35:00,548 --> 00:35:02,050
I'm sorry.

576
00:35:02,258 --> 00:35:05,553
But my friends are gonna figure out
how to fix this, I promise.

577
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,681
I remember meeting you, Mr. Allen,
on the train.

578
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:14,354
You were headed to S.T.A.R. Labs
with a girl, but not your girlfriend.

579
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,730
Yeah.

580
00:35:16,897 --> 00:35:20,359
I'm not sure that I have any girlfriend.

581
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:25,238
You know, Einstein was not only brilliant...

582
00:35:25,404 --> 00:35:27,907
...he had a great sense of humor.

583
00:35:28,157 --> 00:35:29,909
How did it go?

584
00:35:30,409 --> 00:35:33,412
"Any man who drives safely
while kissing a pretty girl...

585
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:38,501
...is not giving the pretty girl
the attention she deserves."

586
00:35:40,085 --> 00:35:42,712
If I learned anything this past year...

587
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:45,006
...life's too short not to live.

588
00:35:53,598 --> 00:35:55,517
-Hey.
-What are you doing here?

589
00:35:55,725 --> 00:35:57,811
-I gave you an out.
-I don't want an out.

590
00:35:58,019 --> 00:36:00,063
I won't date someone who's
into someone else.

591
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,439
I'm not into anyone else.
I'll prove it to you.

592
00:36:02,606 --> 00:36:05,526
This is a <i>naga jolokia,</i>
or the ghost pepper.

593
00:36:05,734 --> 00:36:10,781
It is the world's hottest pepper, measuring
401.5 times hotter than Tabasco sauce.

594
00:36:10,948 --> 00:36:13,367
If you do not agree
to go on another date with me...

595
00:36:13,576 --> 00:36:16,912
...I will eat it, right here, right now.

596
00:36:19,248 --> 00:36:20,291
You're bluffing.

597
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:22,793
I never bluff.

598
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,050
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine, yeah.

599
00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:31,843
-Are you sure?
-Mm-hm.

600
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:34,971
Yes, yes, I'll go out with you.

601
00:36:35,138 --> 00:36:38,808
-That pepper could've killed you, nerd.
-Thanks. Mm.

602
00:36:39,976 --> 00:36:41,936
Ugh. Thank you.

603
00:36:42,979 --> 00:36:46,107
Okay, I won't let my job...

604
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:51,654
...or how bad my mouth is burning right now
come between us.

605
00:36:52,071 --> 00:36:55,867
My Spice Champion of Central City. Ha, ha.

606
00:37:10,506 --> 00:37:14,010
GIDEON:
<i>A crude weapon, if I may say so, Dr. Wells.</i>

607
00:37:14,177 --> 00:37:16,512
I couldn't agree more, Gideon.

608
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,849
But it will do the job.

609
00:37:27,148 --> 00:37:28,691
Gideon...

610
00:37:29,275 --> 00:37:34,197
...can the tachyon prototype be converted
into a quantum splicer?

611
00:37:34,447 --> 00:37:37,533
<i>Theoretically,
but I must warn you, Dr. Wells...</i>

612
00:37:37,784 --> 00:37:40,828
<i>...converting the tachyon prototype
will delay your timetable.</i>

613
00:37:41,037 --> 00:37:45,458
There's not gonna be a timetable if Central
City goes up in a mushroom cloud.

614
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:48,210
Hey, anything?

615
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:53,340
I have an idea. It's a bit of a Hail Mary,
but Cisco and I are gonna give it a try.

616
00:37:54,049 --> 00:37:56,468
-Thank you.
-I'll get Professor Stein.

617
00:37:56,677 --> 00:37:58,136
Looking for the professor?

618
00:37:58,345 --> 00:38:00,806
Yeah, he's gone.

619
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,479
-You guys almost done?
-Hang on, hang on.

620
00:38:07,688 --> 00:38:09,480
CAITLIN:
I found Stein. He's in the Badlands.

621
00:38:09,689 --> 00:38:12,525
The middle of nowhere,
30 miles outside of Central City.

622
00:38:12,733 --> 00:38:14,485
Minimum safe distance.

623
00:38:14,694 --> 00:38:16,320
He's sacrificing himself.

624
00:38:16,529 --> 00:38:18,698
How much time does he have left?

625
00:38:18,906 --> 00:38:20,574
Twelve minutes.

626
00:38:21,658 --> 00:38:24,869
And we're done.

627
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:29,791
-What is it?
-This is a quantum splicer.

628
00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:33,044
-Will it work to separate them?
-We'll know in 12 minutes.

629
00:38:33,253 --> 00:38:35,630
Now, Barry, even you
can't outrun a nuclear blast...

630
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,510
...so you get this device to Professor Stein
and you get out of there as fast as you can.

631
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:42,429
-What are you doing?
-Going with you.

632
00:38:42,595 --> 00:38:44,305
-No, you're not.
-It's too dangerous.

633
00:38:44,514 --> 00:38:46,641
Barry doesn't know how
to operate the splicer.

634
00:38:46,808 --> 00:38:50,854
-Cisco's gonna talk me through it.
-There's not enough time. Let's go.

635
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,647
Go.

636
00:38:58,986 --> 00:39:00,612
What was that?

637
00:39:03,365 --> 00:39:07,244
Uh, comm system's on the fritz.
I'll be right back.

638
00:39:10,372 --> 00:39:13,041
-Cisco.
-I'm not proud of it but I ran the samples.

639
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,712
-One wasn't identified. The other had a match.
<i>-Cisco, you're hesitating.</i>

640
00:39:16,879 --> 00:39:18,714
-Was it Wells?
-No, it's not Dr. Wells.

641
00:39:18,922 --> 00:39:21,133
I told you, he has nothing to do with this.

642
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:23,260
But I know whose blood it is.

643
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:24,511
It's Barry's.

644
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,764
We already know
Barry was there that night.

645
00:39:26,972 --> 00:39:29,016
No, no, no, you don't understand.

646
00:39:29,224 --> 00:39:33,729
The sample had high levels of P-16, a protein
that builds up in the blood as we get older.

647
00:39:33,896 --> 00:39:36,481
<i>And these levels were way too high
for an 11-year-old.</i>

648
00:39:37,857 --> 00:39:41,778
This sample was from Barry as an adult.

649
00:39:57,335 --> 00:39:58,461
Professor Stein!

650
00:39:59,837 --> 00:40:01,839
What are you doing here? You can't be here!

651
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,674
Get her out of here now!

652
00:40:03,883 --> 00:40:06,886
Please, look,
Ronnie's still in there somewhere.

653
00:40:07,094 --> 00:40:10,556
All those people.
Clarissa, I won't let them die.

654
00:40:10,723 --> 00:40:12,475
It's better I end this now.

655
00:40:12,683 --> 00:40:14,267
We can separate you!

656
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,520
We can stop the explosion.

657
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,022
-How?
-A quantum splicer.

658
00:40:20,231 --> 00:40:23,150
It's a fission device
designed to bombard your atoms...

659
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:27,112
...with as much energy as they experienced
in the particle accelerator explosion.

660
00:40:27,321 --> 00:40:29,113
It should be enough to separate you.

661
00:40:29,697 --> 00:40:33,450
Please, professor,
you have nothing left to lose.

662
00:40:38,205 --> 00:40:41,792
Ronnie, if you're in there...

663
00:40:42,334 --> 00:40:43,752
...I love you.

664
00:40:53,846 --> 00:40:55,806
That was from him.

665
00:40:56,765 --> 00:41:00,518
I look forward to meeting you
in person, professor.

666
00:41:11,821 --> 00:41:13,113
It's not working.

667
00:41:13,321 --> 00:41:17,659
-He's not gonna make it. He's gonna blow.
-Get out of there. Barry, get out of there now.

668
00:41:18,326 --> 00:41:20,328
-Oh, no. No, no!
-Caitlin, we have to go.

669
00:41:20,495 --> 00:41:21,538
Run!

670
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,210
No!

671
00:41:44,686 --> 00:41:46,646
Sir, we have a thermonuclear detonation...

672
00:41:46,855 --> 00:41:49,274
...approximately 30 miles northeast
of Central City.

673
00:41:49,482 --> 00:41:52,277
Deploy the Rapid Response Team, sergeant.

674
00:41:52,485 --> 00:41:54,654
Bring me Firestorm.
