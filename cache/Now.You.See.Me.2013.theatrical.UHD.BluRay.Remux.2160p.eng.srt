1
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,740
<i>Come in close.</i>

2
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,160
Closer.

3
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,740
Because the more you think you see,

4
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,250
the easier it'll be to fool you.

5
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,830
I'm going to flip through this deck.

6
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,420
And I want you to see one card.

7
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,920
Not this one. That's too obvious.

8
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,630
Pay close attention.

9
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,510
That was too fast. I'll do it again.

10
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,800
Are you ready?

11
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,840
Okay.

12
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,680
- Now did you see one?
- Yes.

13
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,810
- Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.

14
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,690
Now, do you see your card here?

15
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,310
No.

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,610
That's because you're looking too closely.

17
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,730
And what have I been telling you all night?

18
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,280
The closer you look...

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,860
The less you see.

20
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,340
Now look into my eyes.

21
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,640
And sleep. Okay.

22
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,140
And...

23
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,850
If you can get this bill
from me, you can have it.

24
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,900
Go ahead. Take it. Get it.

25
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,650
If you can say your name, you can have it.

26
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,240
All right, just hang out there, wriggle a sec.

27
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,700
I'm gonna take a little peek under the hood

28
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,330
-of your hubby's brain.
- Oh, no, no, no.

29
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,530
I'm picturing...

30
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,580
- Don't tell me.
- Of course.

31
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,830
Beach. Cocktails.

32
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,460
Florida?

33
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,040
Look, it was a business trip.

34
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,210
I mean, it is a kind of business.

35
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,170
Maybe the oldest business.

36
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,510
You know what, Honey Bee, let's...

37
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,090
She can't move, Mack.

38
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,590
You're thinking of a woman's name.

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,180
<i>A, B, C,</i>

40
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,510
D, E, F, G,

41
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,720
H, I, J...

42
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,600
J? Jean. Jane. Janet.

43
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,890
Who's Janet?

44
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,730
You know Janet?

45
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,100
It's not your best friend, is it?

46
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,150
- Your sister?
- No, please.

47
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,490
Her sister? Oh, my God.

48
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,610
You weren't away on business.

49
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,410
- You were away on Janet.
- No.

50
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,820
Your wife's sister!

51
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,030
Okay. Now she's gonna get upset.

52
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,200
Let's move over here.

53
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,500
You want this to go away?

54
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,210
- Yes.
- Okay, pull out your wallet.

55
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,250
Come on, get it out.

56
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,580
Do you shake down everybody like this?

57
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,500
No, only the special few.

58
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,630
What is this? Two hundred seem fair?

59
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,800
You know what?
This is a big deal. Let's go $250.

60
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,880
You're a stick-up artist.

61
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,640
Yeah. Of course.

62
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,220
Okay, and sleep!

63
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,640
Now, when I snap my fingers,

64
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,230
you won't remember any of this.

65
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,480
And you, Warren Beatty,

66
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,600
every time you see or even think of Janet,

67
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,400
you're gonna picture me naked.

68
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,610
And that's not a pretty sight.

69
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,690
Yeah.

70
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,950
And... You're wide awake!

71
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,490
Well, we did the best we could,

72
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,790
but some people
just aren't to be hypnotized.

73
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,120
- I did it wrong?
- Come on, Honey Bee.

74
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,960
- Oh, no, you did it fine.
- Let me buy you dinner.

75
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,290
Look after her.

76
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,130
Just have to hit an ATM first.

77
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,930
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am the next great magician,

78
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,180
and I will give $100

79
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,600
to anyone who can tell me
how this trick is done.

80
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,310
I have an ordinary spoon from Mel's Deli,
right here in Brooklyn.

81
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,820
Check it out.

82
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,530
Now, everyone
please pay very, very close attention.

83
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,160
Because I'm about to
bend this spoon with my mind.

84
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,710
Thank you. Thank you. Pass that around.

85
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,340
- What's this?
- What are you doing, man?

86
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,670
Look at this! Looks like
we got a spoon and a stem.

87
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,840
I've got other tricks.

88
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,180
Or you could give me my 100 bucks.

89
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,300
You said you would.

90
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,680
Nice wallet.

91
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,930
You have a very good eye, sir.

92
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,020
Thanks.

93
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,520
Wallet.

94
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,860
My wallet. My watch!

95
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,660
Stop that guy!

96
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,870
Stop that guy in the leather jacket!

97
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,910
He's got my wallet!

98
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,710
Okay, Los Angeles,

99
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,420
are we ready to end this thing?

100
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Yeah!

101
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,630
When that timer hits zero,

102
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,420
a tank full of flesh-eating piranhas

103
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,470
will fall from above.

104
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,220
A lady has to have handcuffs. Right, girls?

105
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,220
One, two, three!

106
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,740
Yeah!

107
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,800
Help! Stop it!

108
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,470
She's serious! She can't get out!

109
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,050
Go get some help!

110
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,930
Help, dude!

111
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,770
Get out of the way! Move! Move!

112
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,680
Come on! This is bullshit!

113
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,020
Whoever thought of this is a sick sadist!

114
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,690
Yes!

115
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,070
I am your biggest fan.

116
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,070
I could tell by the way
you're attacking my face right now.

117
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,400
Close the door. Bad apartment building.

118
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,070
- Magician, come here.
- Okay.

119
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,740
- Wait, wait.
- What? What?

120
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,330
How did you do that...

121
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,700
The seven of diamonds
on the side of the tower?

122
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,330
- Yes.
- That's a trade secret.

123
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,790
I'll give you a hint. It involved
bribing the tower electrician.

124
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,000
How much?

125
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,050
50 bucks.

126
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,210
- But it's so hard.
- Oh, thank you.

127
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,420
Is it always a seven?

128
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,130
I could do that trick 52 different ways.

129
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,050
Can you do 52 different tricks on me?

130
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,550
I'll see what I can do.

131
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,510
Magic man!

132
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,310
I love your shampoo.

133
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,850
- Hold up.
- What?

134
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,270
You need to leave.

135
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
Are you kidding me?

136
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,570
Oh, my God, this is so embarrassing.

137
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,860
Is this what you do?

138
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,860
Some kind of sick trick you do to women?

139
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,160
"45 East Evan Street."

140
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,740
Don't worry about it. I'll call you.

141
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,330
You don't have my number.

142
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,580
I'm magic. I'll find it. Have a good night.

143
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,160
You are such an asshole.

144
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,110
Hey!

145
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,280
Henley.

146
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,660
Danny? Hey.

147
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,530
You got a card, huh?

148
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,790
No, no, no,
it's good for you. Congratulations.

149
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,830
All right, so here's what I'm gonna do,

150
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,250
I'm gonna go inside.
I'm gonna scope the place out.

151
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,500
You wait out here. I will come back

152
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,670
and get you, okay? Do not come in.

153
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,500
Hey, Danny! I'm not your assistant anymore.

154
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,130
Nice hair.

155
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,920
So, actually, what have you been up to?

156
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,130
I think you know exactly
what I've been up to, Danny.

157
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,970
I saw all your anonymous
posting on my website.

158
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,300
You have a website. That's good.

159
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,100
Good for you. Get the word out.

160
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,060
Okay.

161
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,310
So apparently none of us
was the only one chosen.

162
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,020
Let me be the first one
to kick my ego to the curb.

163
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,280
Yeah. Excuse me.

164
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,150
- Door's locked.
- Is it? I'll check.

165
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,820
You. Now, hold it, don't tell me.

166
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,490
Helen? No, no.

167
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,030
Henley.

168
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,330
It's on your coffee cup.

169
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,200
Thanks for keeping me honest.

170
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,830
That wasn't mentalism, by the way.

171
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,040
It was just an observation.

172
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,710
Second observation, you are beautiful.

173
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,170
Thank you.

174
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,840
That's good. That's very nice.
Very well-polished. Nice bit.

175
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,130
J. Daniel Atlas. Nice to meet you.

176
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,010
Very nice. I know
who you are and I just want to say that

177
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,140
I'm not interested in you doing

178
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,350
your mentalism thing on us.

179
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,890
Especially when we don't know
who brought us here or even if it's real.

180
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,640
Hold on, I'm sensing...
I'm sensing you are a control freak.

181
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,940
I'm sorry, have we met before?

182
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,610
It doesn't take a mentalist to figure that out.

183
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,730
You are a control freak.

184
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,020
Well, I take that as a compliment.

185
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,320
Only he would take it as a compliment.

186
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,860
Good. Another compliment.

187
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,530
So that's why you're no longer a couple.

188
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,740
A couple? No, no.

189
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,030
We were never a couple.

190
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,910
He used to saw me in half.

191
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,080
She was a very good assistant.

192
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
But I was too fat for Danny.

193
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,040
No. I said that one time
because of the trap door.

194
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,330
No one could fit through there. No one.

195
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,540
Rebecca fit through.

196
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,330
Rebecca fit for years.

197
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,000
Do you know how hard it is to stay

198
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,880
in those tiny little costumes?

199
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,090
No. I'm the main attraction.

200
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,340
Okay. So he never made you feel special.

201
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,350
And, trust me, you deserve
to be made to feel special.

202
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,850
That's a really nice story.

203
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,560
Hope you guys enjoy each other's company.

204
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,020
No way.

205
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,770
J. Daniel Atlas?

206
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,480
Dude, I've seen everything
that you have ever done.

207
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,860
You're like...

208
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,190
I idolize you. Seriously.

209
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,780
From a true fan. It's so nice to meet you.

210
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,400
I'm Jack, by the way.

211
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,910
Question. Did you get one of these?

212
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,700
Yeah. Death.

213
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,740
The High Priestess.

214
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,080
I'm the Lover.

215
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,290
Three minutes.

216
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,370
Hermit.

217
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,210
So, what are we...
Are we waiting for someone?

218
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,880
- Why are we just...
- The door's locked.

219
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,460
Oh, no, nothing's ever locked.

220
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,930
What is this place?

221
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,980
Wow. Thought my apartment was nasty.

222
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,320
Man, it's freezing in here.

223
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,070
What's that?

224
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,450
I don't know.

225
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,740
What's it say?

226
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,490
"Now you don't."

227
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,620
"A rose by any other name..."

228
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,800
Guys, what's happening?

229
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,970
Look at that.

230
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,810
It's gag!

231
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,140
Relax. Just dry ice.

232
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,940
Cool.

233
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,400
Wait. What do you think this is all about?

234
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,190
Hang on. Hang on.

235
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,160
I got nothin'.

236
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,120
Okay. Thank you. Thank you for the delay.

237
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,160
I'm just trying to create
the space for wisdom.

238
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,040
Danny, be honest. Did you do this?

239
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,410
No. Wait, did you?

240
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,830
I Wish.

241
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,290
Why didn't anyone ask me if I did it?

242
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,710
Oh, great.

243
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,760
Electricity is out.

244
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,390
Well, let's check.

245
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,700
Blueprints.

246
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,910
They're incredible.

247
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,700
Who do you think did this?

248
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,040
I don't know, but I really want to meet them.

249
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,540
It's a show.

250
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,810
<i>Merritt McKinney,</i>

251
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,900

256
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,670
Thank you.

257
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,920
Tonight we would like to try something

258
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,590
that will, well, set us a bit apart.

259
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,130
For our final trick,

260
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,220
we're gonna do something never before

261
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,260
seen on a Las Vegas stage.

262
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,640
Or any stage for that matter.

263
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,270
Ladies and gentlemen,

264
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,310
tonight

265
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,360
we are going to rob a bank.

266
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,080
That's a lot of excitement for a crime.

267
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,460
I'm getting excited.
What about you, people?

268
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,170
One, two, three!

269
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,810
Sorry, sir.
There's absolutely no recording allowed

270
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,140
during the performance.

271
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,270
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, of course.

272
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,400
Let me just put this away.

273
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,820
Actually, I need to take that.

274
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,320
After the show, I can come
and give it back to you.

275
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,400
Okay.

276
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,240
<i>Okay , 0K3'! -</i>

277
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,330
Now, please, please, settle down.

278
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,910
Now who here has a bank
they would like us to rob?

279
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,170
That's a lot of people with a vendetta.

280
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,040
So we'll choose one at random then.

281
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,420
My associates will make sure
it's random. Right?

282
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,840
- Elvis, help me out, bud.
- Thank you very much.

283
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,600
In Jack's bowl
are ping pong balls with section numbers.

284
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,680
Jack, could you hand me a section number?

285
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,350
Thank you. We are looking at Section B.

286
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,600
Where is Section B?

287
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,730
Okay. There. It's gonna be
one of you guys. Get ready.

288
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,560
I don't know why everybody's happy.

289
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,690
It's only them.

290
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,570
Merritt, can I get a row, please?

291
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,440
Thank you, Merritt.

292
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,360
We are looking at row number 5.

293
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,530
Where is that?

294
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,450
And Henley, could I please
have a random seat number?

295
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,870
Oh. Lucky number 13.

296
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,620
<i>3-5-13. Where are you?</i>

297
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,580
Sir, please, stand up. There you are. Hi.

298
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,880
Could you just confirm for me that this

299
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,010
is, in fact, your seat? B-5-13.

300
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,050
Yes.

301
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,130
Okay. Wonderful.
Now, could you please tell us

302
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,550
your name and the name of your bank?

303
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,970
Well, my name is Etienne Forcier.

304
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,560
And my bank,
it's Credit Republicain de Paris.

305
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,930
French. Okay.

306
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,730
We were hoping for something
a little more local,

307
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,060
a kind of mom-and-pop
credit union with no security.

308
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,190
But that's fine. A promise is a promise.

309
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,480
Could you please come up to the stage

310
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,860
and we'll rob your bank.

311
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,070
And while he does that...

312
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,400
There is someone here tonight

313
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,240
without whom we would just be

314
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,330
four magicians working the circuit,

315
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,410
trying to get...

316
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,990
Well, actually, trying to get here.

317
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,410
You probably know this man,

318
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,960
if not from one of the many, many

319
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,330
companies he puts his name on.

320
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,540
He is our friend. He is our benefactor.

321
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,920
Mr. Arthur Tressler.

322
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,090
Please, stand up, Art. Please, stand up.

323
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,210
The only man here with

324
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,380
the Queen's cell phone number.

325
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,930
Actually, please, stay standing, Art.

326
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,220
I want to say that
when we came to Mr. Tressler,

327
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,640
we promised that, as a unit,
we could become

328
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,850
the biggest name in magic.

329
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,390
So we wanted to say, "Thank you."

330
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,440
And by the way, Art,
you notice on the sign out front,

331
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,610
we made sure we put your name on top.

332
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,900
If you turn out to be as good

333
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,780
as you think you are, dear girl,

334
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,030
that won't be necessary much longer.

335
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,530
We haven't done our closer yet.

336
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:17,780
Why don't you watch it

337
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,200
and then you can decide for yourself.

338
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,790
Ladies and gentlemen, Arthur Tressler!

339
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,250
Thank you. And, of course, once again,

340
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,330
the Cardinal of Clairvoyance,
Merritt McKinney.

341
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,790
Etienne, what Jack
is bringing to the stage now,

342
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,630
is what we in the magic world
call a teleportation helmet.

343
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,880
You will need to wear this,
as it will allow you

344
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,890
to literally fold through space and time

345
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,310
to your bank in the...

346
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,520
8th?

347
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,640
-9th arrondissement.
- Yeah.

348
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,640
Now, once you are there,

349
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,810
we will be able to speak
with you through this helmet.

350
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,650
Now if...

351
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,650
Oh, my God, that's beautiful.

352
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,900
It has the added attraction
of being very stylish.

353
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,740
It's about time the French learned
from America on that subject.

354
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,490
Is that a beautiful piece of headgear?

355
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,160
- Thank you. Thank you...
-it is.

356
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,830
Thank you. Thank you very much.

357
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,540
But before you go anywhere,

358
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,670
could you please, pick a card, any card.

359
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,000
Not that card.

360
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,510
No, that's an old American joke.
You can take that one.

361
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,180
Okay. This one?

362
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,340
Show it to your friends in Section B.
But not to us.

363
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,060
Okay, great. Now if you could
just sign your name there.

364
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,600
- Yes.
- In English, if possible.

365
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,440
- That's good.
- Thanks.

366
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,690
Put it in your pocket.

367
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,440
And now for one tiny detail.

368
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,420
Now, Etienne, let's step into
this cockamamie contraption.

369
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,880
<i>And</i> I'll <i>step off of it. Bonne chance.</i>

370
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,720
It's 11:50 p.m. here in Vegas.

371
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,050
That's 8:50 a.m. in Paris.

372
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,600
Your bank opens in less than 10 minutes.

373
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:06,850
One,

374
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:07,980
two...

375
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,100
Three.

376
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,560
What the fuck?

377
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,400
- Etienne?
- Etienne?

378
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,570
It wasn't supposed to happen
like that, was it?

379
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,860
Etienne?

380
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,240
I liked that little French guy.

381
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,490
Where did he go?

382
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,000
Wait, there he is.

383
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,340
No, no, no, no, please, please, please.

384
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,260
This is Daniel Atlas. Can you hear me?

385
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,590
Etienne? Are you okay?

386
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,760
<i>Yes.</i>

387
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,220
Perfect. What do you see in there?

388
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,270
Money.

389
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,930
Is this real?

390
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,480
Yes. Looks like three million
or so Euros' worth.

391
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,270
Okay, now, here's what
we're gonna need you to do.

392
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,320
<i>I want you to take the card that you signed</i>

393
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,650
<i>out of your pocket.</i>

394
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,200
And I want you to take the ticket stub

395
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,320
from tonight's show

396
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,610
<i>and I want you to put it right there</i>

397
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,700
<i>in the middle of the money.</i>

398
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,950
Now drop it.

399
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,260
Now, on the side of your helmet
you should feel a button.

400
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,640
Don't press it just yet.

401
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,470
<i>That button activates an air duct</i>

402
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,310
that connects Paris to Las Vegas.

403
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,810
<i>Okay, good. Now you can press it.</i>

404
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,150
All right, now, Etienne, hold on tight.

405
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,610
You might feel a bit of a vacuum.

406
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,050
Wait a second.

407
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,260
Thank you, Etienne. Thank you, everyone!

408
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,600
We are The Four Horsemen.

409
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:54,980
And good night!

410
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,600
Good night!

411
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,120
Hold up here.

412
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,080
Dylan Rhodes.

413
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,700
What? I don't think I heard you correctly.

414
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,250
Did you say magicians?

415
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,250
Yeah, Dylan, magicians.

416
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,540
<i>Where are you now?</i>

417
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,590
I'm at Aria. I'm heading
up there to grab 'em now.

418
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,760
FBI! Hands where I can see them.

419
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,220
Let's go. Get 'em up. Come on.

420
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,310
Let's go. Get 'em up.

421
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,810
Put the book down.

422
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,770
Okay. You got me.

423
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,350
- Freeze! Hands in the air!
- Oh, my!

424
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,610
Do one of you guys
mind giving us a hand with our bags?

425
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,420
<i>Boss, please tell me this is a joke.</i>

426
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,540
<i>I just got Willy Mears
to finger Paulie Attanasio.</i>

427
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,300
I'm a month, two tops,

428
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,840
away from blowing this whole thing open.

429
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
Get Turkelson.

430
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,220
He's in Atlantic City.

431
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,510
What about Cowan? Look at him.

432
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,050
He's just sitting there on his ass.

433
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,300
Hilarious, Rhodes.

434
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,890
<i>Hove you.</i>

435
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,310
Asshole.

436
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,060
I don't have time for this magic crap.

437
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,640
This crap just pulled
three million Euro out of a Parisian bank.

438
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,850
- That's how much they got?
- Yeah.

439
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,440
Actually, 3.2.

440
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,150
Who is she?

441
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,990
Alma Dray from Interpol.

442
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,660
I'll be working the investigation with you.

443
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,950
You gotta be kidding me.

444
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,580
It's bad enough they got me chasing down

445
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,830
David Copperfield and Friends.

446
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:39,160
Now I'm being saddled with,
no offense, with Interpol?

447
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,460
I look forward to working
with you, too, Agent Rhodes.

448
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,500
I'm sorry. I don't think I'm gonna
need your help on this. Okay?

449
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,170
- Where's the French guy?
- I already spoke to him.

450
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,760
Oh, you did? You spoke
to my witness before me?

451
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,970
Your witness? I thought
you didn't want the case.

452
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,600
Besides, he's useless.

453
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,510
Oh, really? Why is that?

454
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,850
Because he believes their magic was real.

455
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,560
Oh, he believes the magic was real?

456
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,140
You're right, he probably is useless.

457
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,560
Is it okay with Interpol if we talk to him, too?

458
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,190
Thank you.

459
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,030
I have never stolen a thing in my life, okay?

460
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,490
I tried to give
the money back, but they won't take it.

461
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,370
Okay, okay, Etienne.
Just 'cause I'm new to this,

462
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,910
can you explain to me how you went

463
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,290
from Las Vegas to Paris in three seconds?

464
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,960
With the teleportation helmet.

465
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,790
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

466
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,670
He was hypnotized during the show.

467
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,420
I told you, he's useless.

468
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,750
Okay, I'll deal with you when I'm clone

469
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,380
with this other bullshit.

470
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,550
Hey!

471
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,390
During the show,
half the audience was hypnotized

472
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,890
to believe they were in the Philharmonic.

473
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,390
I guess that "bullshit" was the trigger word.

474
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,640
Okay. Ecoutez, buddy. Come on down.

475
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,060
You're not in the Philharmonic.

476
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,560
- How do you say "stop" in French?
- Stop.

477
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,690
Tell him to stop.

478
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:51,990
No, I can't. You just have to
let him finish his movement.

479
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,240
Okay, I need a time-out.

480
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,780
Too many French people in one room.

481
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,410
Agent Rhodes!

482
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:00,240
I'm ordered by my bosses
to provide a report.

483
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,370
And until we have one,
I'm here, like it or not.

484
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,750
So we can work together,

485
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,750
or you can continue to follow behind

486
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,960
asking the same exact questions I'm asking.

487
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,250
It's up to you.

488
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,510
I'm not finished.

489
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:19,430
I just flew 12 hours,
after what was already a long day.

490
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,810
And I do not handle jet lag well.

491
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,310
So if you want to see who can be grumpier,

492
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,520
I promise you, you will lose.

493
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,280
Fine. So which one of these idiots

494
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,780
do you want to talk to first?

495
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,860
Him?

496
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,120
Dylan, for the record,

497
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,330
mentalism has never actually
been proven to be accurate.

498
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,460
Okay.

499
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,870
That is to say, that it's not a science.

500
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,040
It's more for entertainment.

501
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,380
All right.

502
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,800
Just don't believe
everything the guy says. That's all.

503
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,880
Please convey my deepest apologies

504
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,760
to your colleague out there.

505
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,180
I'm really sorry about this
whole Tranny Tuesday thing.

506
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,470
I was out of line.

507
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,810
Tranny Tuesday?

508
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,560
Well, it's an arrangement
he and his wife have.

509
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,390
Or might not have, if you believe

510
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,940
everything Agent Fuller
is saying to be correct.

511
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,650
But isn't there a proud tradition in the FBI

512
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,610
of men wearing dresses?

513
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:17,910
No shame, Agent Fuller. No shame.

514
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,740
I'm just having fun.

515
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,410
So, if you had nothing to do with it,

516
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,080
then how did
the playing card get into the vault?

517
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,170
Oh, yes. That would be...

518
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,750
What do the kids call it these days?

519
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,000
Oh, yes, that's right. Magic.

520
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,090
Just answer the question, okay, smartass.

521
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,760
All right. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

522
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,680
You can keep that. Don't share it with him.

523
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,890
It says here you are a mentalist.

524
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:46,020
What exactly is mentalism?

525
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,190
Tricks, mostly. Some science.

526
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:53,230
Targeted guessing
might be a most apt description.

527
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,690
Along with some intuition
and the occasional...

528
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,030
Voices in my head.

529
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:04,080
Says here you were
fairly famous at one point.

530
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,160
You can
even hypnotize people over the phone.

531
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,960
Some big tours
around the U.S. for a few years,

532
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
-two TV specials.
- Glory days.

533
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:14,710
Then your brother/manager disappeared
with all your hard-earned money.

534
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,130
Did your research, did you?

535
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,050
IRS audit. Back taxes.

536
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,880
You've had a long hard slog back

537
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,390
into the limelight,
haven't you, Mr. McKinney?

538
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:27,140
Yes, indeed, it has. And I do appreciate
that trip down Memory Lane.

539
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,350
As far as I understand it,
when the man from Paris

540
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,560
put on the magical helmet...

541
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,650
Listen to me.

542
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:34,360
If you didn't rob that bank,
then you knew about it.

543
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,570
Which makes you an accomplice.

544
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:38,070
So if you wanna walk out of here
today, I'd suggest you start...

545
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,150
Now you listen to me, unless you think

546
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,700
there's a D.A. in the state of Nevada

547
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,240
who'd be willing
to make sense of this to a jury,

548
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,450
then we have a show to perform.

549
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,740
And you, Agent Rhodes,

550
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,120
have a drawing board to get back to.

551
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,660
Is this your first date?

552
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,910
What?

553
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,750
No, I mean, obviously, you guys don't
know each other well, if at all.

554
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,380
But, like,
there is a palpable tension in this room.

555
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,260
And before you get involved,

556
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,840
you should consider the fact
that she has a lot of big secrets.

557
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,640
And I know the first one is that

558
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,850
this is your first time off the desk. Isn't it?

559
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,770
You should have said something to him.

560
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,020
This is a weird way for you to find out.

561
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,940
You are literally
begging to be arrested. You know that?

562
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,360
If it means you would
actually do it, then, yeah. But you won't.

563
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,940
Because if you did, it means that you,

564
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,110
and the FBI, and your friends at Interpol,

565
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:23,610
actually believe,
at an institutional level, in magic.

566
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,330
The press would have a field day.

567
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,370
And we'd be even more famous
than we already are.

568
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,660
And you guys would look like idiots

569
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,950
even more then you already are.

570
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,170
Well, no, not you. But him. Right?

571
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,920
You have,
what we in the business, like to call,

572
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,630
"nothing up your sleeve."

573
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,960
And you know it.

574
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,130
Don't draw him in and then dump him

575
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,680
because abandonment
is a big "area" for him.

576
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,340
Mommy?

577
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,300
Daddy.

578
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,970
You have big daddy issues.

579
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,680
- Okay, that's enough.
- I'll tell you what.

580
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:54,060
Your average therapist is gonna charge you
$200-$300 for this sesh.

581
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,480
Me? I'll take a tenner.

582
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,110
Okay, later, if you're feeling magnanimous,

583
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,070
I'll still take a tenner.

584
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,320
You wanna know who sat
in that chair before you?

585
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,570
Mob bosses, murderers, and thieves.

586
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,240
And you know who put them there?

587
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,240
The guy who's sitting in this chair.

588
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:14,290
So I warn you,
I can maintain my resolve much longer

589
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:17,170
than you can maintain
that phony arrogance.

590
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,380
And the instant that you even show

591
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,170
the slightest crack in that smug facade,

592
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,510
I'll be there.

593
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,180
I will be all over you like...

594
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,430
Like white on rice?

595
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,220
Sorry. That's unfair.

596
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,390
Let me warn you.

597
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,600
I want you to follow.

598
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,180
Because no matter
what you think you might know,

599
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,770
we will always be one step, three steps,

600
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:34,890
seven steps ahead of you.

601
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,190
And just when you think
you're catching up,

602
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,690
that's when we'll be right behind you.

603
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,190
And at no time will you be
anywhere other than

604
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,360
exactly where I want you to be.

605
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,070
So come close. Get all over me

606
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,530
because the closer you think you are,

607
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,030
the less you'll actually see.

608
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,070
I'm gonna nail you...

609
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,870
Something wrong with that soda, Miss?

610
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,420
Oh! Shit!

611
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,550
First rule of magic.

612
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,590
Always be the smartest guy in the room.

613
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,450
Boss, what are we doing?
We're letting them go?

614
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,740
They all but admitted
they're gonna do it again.

615
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,830
About a half an hour ago,
you didn't give a damn about them.

616
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,660
- What changed?
- I met them.

617
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,750
Hey. Guys.

618
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,500
Hey, I ran a check on the audience.

619
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,750
Most of it was just filler.

620
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,540
People that Tressler
dragged in to pack the room.

621
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,420
But guess who was sitting there in the back,

622
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,630
filming the whole damn thing?

623
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,760
I don't know.

624
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,300
Thaddeus Bradley.

625
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,340
Thaddeus Bradley,
the guy from TV with the DVDs and shows?

626
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,430
No.

627
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,850
Okay, well, he debunks magicians.

628
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,770
He exposes them.
He shows you how to do their tricks.

629
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,930
Get him on the phone.

630
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,680
I did. You're having lunch with him in 45.

631
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:58,810
Good.

632
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,650
So you were a magician first?

633
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,690
What made you jump over to this side?

634
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:06,110
Do you know how many people went
to see magic performed live

635
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:08,200
in the last half decade?

636
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,950
About 1.6 million.

637
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:15,160
You know how many digital downloads
I sold in the same period?

638
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,290
Five million.

639
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,710
Isn't there a cost, though?

640
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,500
Careers.

641
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,170
Even lives.

642
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,630
I assume you're referring to Lionel Shrike.

643
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,220
I'm sorry, who's that?

644
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,970
Lionel Shrike.

645
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:34,300
A middling magician. A fool, really,

646
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:37,600
who tried to make a name
for himself in the '70s.

647
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,600
My first show, I revealed all of his tricks.

648
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,810
Exposed him
for the two-bit hustler that he really was.

649
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,320
A year later, he tried to stage a comeback.

650
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,820
Had himself locked in a safe,

651
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,240
and dropped to the bottom of the East River.

652
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,490
But he never resurfaced.

653
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,830
The guy died in there?

654
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,870
The safe was never recovered.

655
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,750
Must have been great for ratings.

656
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,330
He attempted something
he was ill-prepared to handle.

657
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,420
You're about to do the same thing.

658
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,010
But I assure you, Vegas was just a start.

659
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:13,010
New Orleans will be to draw you in
so you think you know their routine.

660
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:17,430
All the while, setting you
up for the big punch,

661
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,350
show number three.

662
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,020
What makes you so certain
New Orleans is their next play?

663
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,360
What?

664
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,480
Flyer they passed out after the show.

665
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,780
You, my friend, are going to be played.

666
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,990
And your pathetic attempts
at fawning to gain my trust,

667
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:39,540
only show how really
far out of depth you are.

668
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,370
Okay. Here's the deal.

669
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,080
You're great at what you do.

670
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,380
We're trying to nail the same guys.

671
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,880
So why don't you give us a hand?

672
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,220
Now, why would I do that?

673
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,140
The longer you spin your wheels,

674
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,680
the more money I make.

675
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,310
How about I drag you in right now

676
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:04,060
on obstruction charges
and force you to tell me?

677
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,940
Unless what you're actually
really trying to say is,

678
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,570
you don't have any idea how they did it.

679
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,450
Showmanship and theatrics.

680
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,780
When a magician waves his hand and says,

681
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,490
"This is where the magic is happening."

682
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,160
The real trick is happening somewhere else.

683
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,630
Misdirection. A basic concept of magic.

684
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,090
Not interested in the concepts of magic.

685
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,800
I wanna know how they robbed a bank.

686
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,670
You're an idiot if you think
they robbed a bank.

687
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,180
But don't take my word for it.

688
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,340
How about a trip to Paris?

689
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,930
Hermia,
the teleportation helmet, please, darling?

690
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,770
You're joking, right?

691
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,230
You wanna know how they did it or not?

692
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,610
I'm just gonna put this on your head.

693
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,650
Step right up.

694
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,610
There you go.

695
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,950
Now we just pull this down
all safe and snug.

696
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,910
Make yourself comfortable. There we go.

697
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,120
And when you're ready to go to Paris,

698
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,290
just say the magic word.

699
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,790
Blow me?

700
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,540
<i>- That'll suffice.
- Bon voyage.</i>

701
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,680
I personally prefer to take the stairs to Paris.

702
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:28,310
Welcome to the City of Light, Agent Rhodes.

703
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,270
Hardy har har. What was with the helmet?

704
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,860
My fun.

705
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,480
What?

706
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,900
Nothing.

707
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,820
So they got a vault set.

708
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,990
Yes.

709
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,160
And it's the exact replica

710
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,410
of the little French guy's bank.

711
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:43,540
So he's a plant.

712
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,080
He was a dupe, not a plant.

713
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,330
They chose him. They knew
which seat he was in.

714
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:50,000
No, no, no, the audience picked the seat.

715
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,630
Unless, of course,
the audience didn't pick the seat.

716
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,760
They let them think they picked the seat.

717
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,220
We'll choose one at random then.

718
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,590
<i>Actually, they were just palming the ball</i>

719
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,390
<i>with the seat number they wanted.</i>

720
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,680
We are looking at row number 5.

721
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,180
Henley, could I please
have a seat number?

722
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,680
Lucky number 13.

723
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,850
Could you just confirm that this
is, in fact, your seat?

724
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,480
<i>He was selected.</i>

725
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,320
<i>They programmed his mind
to make him go to Las Vegas.</i>

726
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,520
Viva Las Vegas.

727
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,650
<i>And then
they kept reinforcing it, until he did.</i>

728
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,110
<i>They trailed him.</i>

729
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,370
<i>They studied him.</i>

730
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,160
<i>Nothing was left to chance.</i>

731
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,500
I got his measurements.

732
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,910
<i>He had no idea he was their target.</i>

733
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,170
<i>And they simply activated him in Vegas.</i>

734
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,540
When I snap my fingers...

735
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,210
And once again, Merritt McKinney.

736
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,420
<i>But how did they know what bank was his?</i>

737
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,880
- You're kidding.
- Really?

738
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:41,680
Can you be any more
of a condescending ass?

739
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
Yes.

740
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,510
Like this.

741
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,980
There's a very rare, very mysterious way

742
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,560
in which a magician divines
an audience member's bank.

743
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,560
You ready?

744
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,980
Yes.

745
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,280
Credit card.

746
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:01,490
And that's how they got
the signature for the card

747
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,530
they left in the vault in Paris.

748
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,620
Very good.

749
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,330
You're being one-upped, Agent Rhodes.

750
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,450
Okay, but they had to get
the signature card in the vault.

751
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,080
You said they didn't steal the money.

752
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:12,870
No, I didn't say they didn't steal the money.

753
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,380
I said they didn't rob the bank.

754
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,550
<i>My guess is that they targeted</i>

755
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,260
<i>a shipment of freshly minted money</i>

756
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:23,260
<i>headed to the Frenchman's bank
on-board an armored truck.</i>

757
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,470
<i>Which, of course,
is just as hard to break into.</i>

758
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,230
<i>Unless you're already inside.</i>

759
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:48,990
<i>And despite what the banks
would have you believe,</i>

760
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,910
<i>the men who drive
these trucks are not exactly mental giants.</i>

761
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,170
<i>For our Horsemen...</i>

762
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,460
<i>...it was almost too easy.</i>

763
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,970
Hey, boys.

764
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:14,190
So, how did they make the phony money
disappear from the vault?

765
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,770
<i>Flash paper.</i>

766
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,190
<i>Magicians use it all the time.</i>

767
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,200
<i>Creates no smoke, leaves no residue.</i>

768
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,000
<i>Two days ago, no one heard of these guys,</i>

769
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,750
<i>but tonight's show sold out in 35 seconds.</i>

770
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,300
I think these guys have cracked
the secret to show business.

771
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:45,090
Give your audience $3 million.

772
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,680
Puts 'em in a good mood, doesn't it?

773
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,010
Best finale ever.

774
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,510
<i>They're gonna be
the first magicians in history to get laid.</i>

775
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,100
<i>Remember, if the oxygen mask comes down,</i>

776
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,190
-put it on the lawyer first. Remember.
- Oh, yes.

777
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,600
<i>I always do. It's lawyer first,</i>

778
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,770
<i>-then myself and then the children.
- Then yourself.</i>

779
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,230
Yes. Then the children.

780
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,690
<i>We'll be getting there a few minutes early.</i>

781
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,860
<i>So, sit back, relax.</i>

782
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,700
<i>We should be in the Big Easy soon.</i>

783
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,490
<i>Appreciate you flying with us today.</i>

784
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:10,870
So, what's in it
for Tressler, besides the money?

785
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,120
Ego.

786
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,580
Okay, pick your card.

787
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,540
Look at it, put it in the deck, and tell me.

788
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,380
No, don't tell me.

789
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,210
-Okay.
-Okay.

790
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,880
Thaddeus was there that night.

791
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,380
He knows exactly
how they pulled it off. What about him?

792
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,180
You think they could be working together.

793
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,430
Like there's another
Horseman or something.

794
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,220
I don't know. All I know is that these guys

795
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,680
were a bunch of street magicians

796
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,350
a year ago with no resources.

797
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,690
So, how do they go from doing that to this

798
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,400
without some kind of outside help?

799
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,810
Is this your card?

800
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,820
No, my card is sitting
over there in that guy's lap.

801
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,860
Nice shuffle.

802
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,410
Allow me to make plain
what we've both been thinking.

803
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,700
And what's that?

804
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,870
Well, obviously, you have feelings
of affection for Daniel.

805
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,080
Unrequited and misguided,

806
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,040
owing to his lack of emotional availability.

807
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,790
Consequently, you're very tightly...

808
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,550
How should I put it?

809
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:05,090
Corked.

810
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,170
Oh, lam?

811
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,880
Now, recognizing that
you have physical needs not being met,

812
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,600
and strictly in the vein of
helping a sister out,

813
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,350
I invite you to think
of me as your own personal corkscrew.

814
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,690
Wow. Thanks.

815
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,600
Let me mull over
that offer of cheap and meaningless sex.

816
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:25,570
Cheap and meaningless, maybe,
but not time-consuming.

817
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,450
Is it magicians, in general,
you have a problem with?

818
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,620
Or specifically those guys?

819
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:36,120
I could care less about magicians in general.

820
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,080
What I hate is people
who exploit other people.

821
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,290
Exploit them how?

822
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,670
Try again.

823
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,710
By taking advantage of their weaknesses.

824
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,590
Their need
to believe in something that's unexplainable

825
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,510
in order to make their lives more bearable.

826
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,390
I see it as a strength.

827
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,430
My life is happier when I believe that.

828
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:56,850
Is this your card?

829
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,140
Yeah.

830
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,060
Yeah?

831
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,690
- Yeah.
- Cool.

832
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,480
That smile on your face. Is it real?

833
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,780
Maybe.

834
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,660
So let me ask you, Mr. Detective Man.

835
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,160
Do you feel exploited?

836
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,490
Or did you have maybe
a tiny, tiny bit of fun?

837
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,000
Guy goes to the doctor.

838
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,170
Doctor says, "Sir, you're gonna

839
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,330
"have to stop masturbating."

840
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,380
He Says, "Why?"

841
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,920
He says, "So I can finish the examination."

842
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,090
Oh, Danny, can I talk to you about

843
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,710
-my role in the show real quick?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

844
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,050
Hey, guys.

845
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,930
We got a show to prepare for.

846
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,340
Do we now?

847
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,510
No, no, no, don't do that.

848
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,720
You're not doing that thing to me. No.

849
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,180
What thing? I'm just looking at you.

850
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,850
No, you're not.
I've been watching you for a year.

851
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,270
I know all of your little tricks.

852
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,520
That what they are to you? Tricks?

853
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,350
Yes, it's gimmicks. it's Barnum statements.

854
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,110
It's reading the eyes. Body language. I get it.

855
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,860
If it's such an easy thing,
why don't you do Henley?

856
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,690
Yeah, Danny. Why don't you do me?

857
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,950
No, you're too easy. I'll do Jasmine.

858
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,530
No.

859
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,860
Do me.

860
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,370
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Do Art.

861
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,450
Okay.

862
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,620
Even better.

863
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,700
- Art.
- ah.

864
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,580
But I warn you, I can be difficult to read,

865
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,710
when I want to be.

866
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,960
Just stay with me, okay?

867
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,540
So, Art, you were a tough kid.

868
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,630
You know, kind of a real rapscallion.

869
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,670
You had a dog. A real tough dog.

870
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,630
A brutish breed. Like a real...

871
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,890
I want to say, Ben the bulldog.

872
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,390
Actually, I was a prissy little tot.

873
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:21,560
I had a fluffy white cat called Snuffles.

874
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,390
Sorry.

875
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,730
Wait, let me try one.

876
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:26,900
- I can do way better than that.
- Let him do it.

877
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,060
Come on, give me
one more time. One more time.

878
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,730
He can do way better than that.

879
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:30,780
Let's do family.

880
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,070
You had an uncle on your mother's side.

881
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,860
He had a real, kind of...
A real masculine name.

882
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:39,160
A real, kind of, salt-of-the-earth...

883
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,740
You know, a real stick-it-to-you...

884
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:45,000
Like it was some kind of Paul.
Thompson? Was it a Paul...

885
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,750
Okay. You know what? I got nothin'.

886
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,330
- Nearly though.
- Was I?

887
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,840
Yeah. My uncle's name
was Cushman Armitage.

888
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,590
Really? Snuffles and Cushman Armitage?

889
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,670
That was your childhood?

890
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,140
I certainly hope
tonight's show is gonna be better than this.

891
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:00,140
Don't worry. Just you wait.

892
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,560
Hey. Come on, give me some good news
on a hotel room, please.

893
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,770
<i>What, are you kidding me?</i>

894
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:11,360
No, it's Mardi Gras, Dylan.

895
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,400
There's nothing within sight of the theater.

896
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,820
Hold on a second. Hold on.
Where is this woman?

897
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,660
Hey, hey! There you are.

898
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,330
What, the French girl
doing a little sightseeing

899
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:22,450
while she's in New Orleans?

900
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,790
No. In fact, here, speaking French

901
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,540
is actually an asset.

902
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,120
Do you see that woman up there?

903
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,290
That's Marie Claire.

904
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,630
And she has a lovely apartment for us.

905
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,300
You're welcome.

906
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,970
Yeah.

907
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,640
We got a place.

908
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,640
This other guy, Maximillian...

909
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:46,890
I am not interested in a history lesson
on magic at this moment.

910
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,650
If you want to keep playing
into their hands, go for it.

911
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:51,650
I'm just
trying to understand how they think.

912
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:53,940
You think I'm playing
in their hands, do you?

913
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,820
I don't know how any of that
is gonna go against this.

914
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,030
This what? This magic?

915
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:01,820
Lionel Shrike.

916
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:05,580
In Central Park,
he has a guy pick a card and sign it.

917
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,660
Then he goes to a tree
that has been there 20 years.

918
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,250
They saw the tree in half.

919
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,420
Inside the tree, encased in glass,

920
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,340
is the card with the signature.

921
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,550
How did he do that?

922
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:18,970
I have no idea.
But I'm sure there's a logical explanation.

923
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,680
You guys got a guy in that lobby yet?

924
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,310
<i>No, but I do have some good news.</i>

925
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,520
Remember how Atlas is such a control freak,

926
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,350
he's got his whole crew
on those tracking bracelets?

927
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:30,690
What tracking bracelets?

928
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:32,020
<i>He has every member of his crew</i>

929
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,690
<i>wearing a tracking bracelet.</i>

930
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:35,860
<i>Those bracelets are on a sub-8 flat-band.</i>

931
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,110
<i>So as long as Atlas is tracking them...</i>

932
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,320
Next.

933
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,490
...our boys can track Atlas

934
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:40,990
from right here in the mobile command unit.

935
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:43,030
<i>Okay, call me if you get any movement.</i>

936
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:44,410
Copy that.

937
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,590
You are missing the big picture here, Dylan.

938
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,550
There is a place in Paris, Pont des Arts.

939
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,550
Sometimes in the mornings
I sit on a bench there.

940
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,600
And I watch the people make a wish

941
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,810
and lock it in a lock on the bridge.

942
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:11,560
Then throw the key into the Seine.

943
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,980
All day they do this.
Mothers, lovers, old men.

944
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:20,240
Watching the key sink into the water

945
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,530
and their secret is locked away forever.

946
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:28,740
Real and, at the same time, magical.

947
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,090
So,

948
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,590
do you really think it's possible
there's a fifth Horseman?

949
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:43,340
Yeah.

950
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,680
<i>There is a legend of a secret order</i>

951
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:53,640
<i>born in ancient Egypt called</i>

952
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,400
<i>"The Eye."</i>

953
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:59,610
<i>It is said they perfected sleight of hand</i>

954
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,780
<i>to steal food from the Pharaohs</i>

955
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,610
<i>and give it to the slaves.</i>

956
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:05,240
<i>Their purpose?</i>

957
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,290
<i>Using magic
and illusion to even the scales of justice.</i>

958
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,500
<i>Are The Horsemen next in a long line
of fools to believe this myth?</i>

959
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:19,630
Will they evade the rules of law and logic
like they did in Las Vegas?

960
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:24,720
Or will the dark mysticism
of this Southern swampland

961
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,890
get the better of them?

962
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:34,810
Bravo, Mr. Bradley.

963
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,980
Either you have a cease-and-desist,

964
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,360
which you don't, or you should leave.

965
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:43,320
If I want something to cease or desist,

966
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:45,660
it does.

967
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,030
Take five.

968
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,160
According to your potential backers,

969
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:53,000
you stand to make 2.5 million tops

970
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,710
from your best special.

971
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:57,580
I have here a check

972
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,590
for 3.5 million.

973
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,840
To walk away?

974
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,680
To fly away. My jet is at your disposal.

975
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,510
Let's not kid ourselves, Mr. Tressler.

976
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,180
You're in this to ride them up.

977
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,690
I'm in it to ride them down.

978
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:20,020
I take it that we do not have a deal.

979
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,860
And therein lies our conflict.

980
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,530
Let me be blunt.

981
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:35,410
My bank account
is much, much bigger than yours.

982
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:38,460
And my lawyers are much stronger.

983
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:41,880
And they will manacle you

984
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:44,960
with so many injunctions.

985
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:47,510
Until you stand by, hopelessly watching

986
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:50,220
everything that you own drain away

987
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,560
in front of your greedy little eyes.

988
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,060
This isn't the first time I've been threatened.

989
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:00,730
It is, however,
the first time you've been threatened by me.

990
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,440
You shouldn't have done that.

991
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,450
According to superstition,

992
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:10,700
one who uses a doll
to enact one's own wrath,

993
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:15,240
is likely to bring that
very wrath unto himself.

994
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,580
Isn't that funny?

995
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:20,420
And I thought you didn't believe in magic.

996
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,840
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

997
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,510
<i>the Savoy management welcomes you</i>

998
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:31,140
<i>to tonight's special performance,</i>

999
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,930
<i>The Four Horsemen, Act Two.</i>

1000
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,100
<i>Unlike traditional performances,</i>

1001
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:38,480
<i>The Four Horsemen encourage you to film,</i>

1002
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,560
<i>call your friends,</i>

1003
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,610
<i>upload, stream, and tweet the show freely.</i>

1004
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:46,190
<i>Thank you. The show
will begin in a few minutes.</i>

1005
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:52,370
By the way, I know how he did that trick.

1006
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:54,370
- Who?
- Shrike.

1007
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,700
So, when he was 14,

1008
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,120
he saw a hole in a tree in Central Park.

1009
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:02,500
He had a guy who worked at the carousel

1010
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:06,300
sign a card for what looked
like a routine little trick.

1011
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,800
At the guy's retirement, 18 years later,

1012
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:14,180
Shrike performs, has the guy sign a card,

1013
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:16,060
and presto!

1014
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,640
The card is in the tree.

1015
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,560
It was in the tree for 18 years.

1016
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,730
The card was in the tree.

1017
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:23,810
The tree grew around the card in 18 years.
That's not magic.

1018
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,650
The point is, the trick
was not to look closely.

1019
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,650
It was to look so far

1020
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,490
that you see 20 years into the past.

1021
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,740
After Shrike drowned,
they never found the body.

1022
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,950
What are you suggesting?

1023
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,120
<i>Arthur Tressler presents</i>

1024
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:43,620
<i>Jack Wilder,</i>

1025
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:44,880
<i>Henley Reeves,</i>

1026
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,420
<i>Merritt McKinney,</i>

1027
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:48,170
<i>and Daniel Atlas.</i>

1028
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:50,090
<i>The Four Horsemen.</i>

1029
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:57,300
What is magic?

1030
00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:00,720
Our argument,
nothing but targeted deception.

1031
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:03,140
So I want you to look.

1032
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:05,770
Look as closely as possible.

1033
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:07,900
Because the tricks you are about to see

1034
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,190
may not seem connected.

1035
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:12,150
But we assure you, they are.

1036
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:15,910
Is what follows 100 different tricks?

1037
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,910
Or is it one giant illusion?

1038
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:30,550
And now for one
of the oldest tricks in the book.

1039
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,840
Danny, if you wouldn't mind
opening up the box,

1040
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,130
and showing everybody
that it's completely empty.

1041
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:39,350
Now, we're gonna need
12 courageous volunteers.

1042
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,850
I'm gonna take sweet little Fluffy here,

1043
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:44,730
and put her inside this mystery box.

1044
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,850
There are two pencils out there.

1045
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,230
Hold 'em up high. Let me see 'em.

1046
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:49,730
- Here!
- Yeah!

1047
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:52,190
And now, you will say the magic word.

1048
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:53,530
Abracadabra.

1049
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:54,950
Yes, and I will wave this magic wand

1050
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:56,610
for no reason. And then...

1051
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,120
Fluffy has
magically vanished before your very eyes.

1052
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,910
If you haven't experienced mass hypnosis,

1053
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,160
you're about to.

1054
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:05,540
And sleep.

1055
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:08,460
Down, down. Sleep, sleep.
Completely sleep.

1056
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,130
Good, good. Sleep, sleep.

1057
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:12,210
And now we are gonna debunk

1058
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,420
a few magic myths this evening.

1059
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:17,720
We all know that Fluffy is,
in fact, alive and well.

1060
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:20,550
And Fluffy has miraculously appeared.

1061
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,100
As has the mirror

1062
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,640
which makes the box only
appear as though it's empty.

1063
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,770
When you hear the word "freeze"

1064
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:29,190
you are all football players.

1065
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:32,190
And your job is to tackle,

1066
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,690
dismantle,

1067
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,070
crush,

1068
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:37,490
tear limb from limb,

1069
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,620
the quarterback.

1070
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:53,000
You will know who the quarterback is.

1071
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:56,630
He will be the one saying that word.

1072
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,970
Freeze.

1073
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:00,640
Three, two, one...

1074
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:09,310
Put your hands in the middle.
One, two, three...

1075
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,810
Kill the quarterback!

1076
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,520
Get on back to your seats.

1077
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:14,860
I got a feeling
I'm gonna be seeing you soon.

1078
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:48,930
I guess you have lost some weight.

1079
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:05,660
At the intermission,

1080
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:08,200
we asked you to write down
your current bank balance,

1081
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:09,830
and seal it in an envelope.

1082
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:11,500
Now it's time to take those envelopes out.

1083
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,710
Everyone take 'em out.

1084
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,670
Now, everybody,

1085
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:18,670
shout out your name. All at once. Go.

1086
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:21,930
Shout 'em out.

1087
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:25,930
Clement? Frannick?

1088
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,220
- Yeah! Up here!
- Oh. Way up there.

1089
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,230
Okay. Dina? Robertson?

1090
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:31,850
That's me!

1091
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:34,230
Okay. Names. Names. Let's go.

1092
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,570
Josepha Hickey?

1093
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:38,690
That's me!

1094
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:41,650
Josepha, I want you
to focus on your balance,

1095
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,740
and count from one to 10 out loud.

1096
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:45,570
One, two, three, four, five...

1097
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:46,910
Stop.

1098
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,950
Is the first digit 5?

1099
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,040
Yes.

1100
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,410
Do it again. This time, faster.

1101
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,920
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1102
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,080
Stop.

1103
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:56,290
Six. Again.

1104
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,380
One, two...

1105
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:01,550
Josepha, is your
bank balance $562 as of today?

1106
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,930
Yeah. That's what I got.

1107
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,220
Unfortunately, you're wrong.

1108
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:08,430
Okay, Dina,

1109
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:11,390
1,

1110
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,020
<i>4,</i>

1111
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:14,730
<i>7,</i>

1112
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:17,310
-7.
- Yeah.

1113
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,150
You think it is.
But in fact, you, too, are wrong.

1114
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,440
Clement.

1115
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:25,450
You do not have $6,500 in your account.

1116
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:29,450
In fact, everybody stand up. Everybody.

1117
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:34,250
Yeah. Put your envelopes to your forehead.

1118
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:37,210
Focus on your number.

1119
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:44,550
This is... Oh, dear. Just as I feared.

1120
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,840
Oh, this is strange.

1121
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:50,430
You know, I hate to say this,
but you're all wrong.

1122
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,470
Every last one of you is dead wrong

1123
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,690
about what you think is in your account.

1124
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:56,190
Okay, you can sit down now.

1125
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:59,110
Yeah. I almost forgot.

1126
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:02,150
This evening would not be possible

1127
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:05,700
if it weren't
for our great benefactor Arthur Tressler.

1128
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,870
Big applause! Big applause!

1129
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:10,450
Art, actually, why don't
you come up on stage

1130
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:11,660
for the finale?

1131
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,540
- Come on down, Art!
- Come on down, Art!

1132
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:15,540
There he goes. Okay, good.

1133
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:16,670
Are we on red?

1134
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:18,830
Bright red. We're all standing by.

1135
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,340
All right, no one leaves the theater. No one.

1136
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:21,590
There he goes.

1137
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:24,420
Now, Art, did you fill out your envelope?

1138
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,340
Well, no need. We've done it for you.

1139
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:29,850
Now, Art, I took a guess.

1140
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:32,100
North of 140. Am I right?

1141
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,890
That's 140 million, by the way.

1142
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,520
I'm sorry, Merritt.

1143
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:42,650
How can he be right about his balance

1144
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:43,860
and everyone else be wrong?

1145
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:47,360
I think possibly because he, too, is wrong.

1146
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:49,660
Everybody, take out your paper.

1147
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,370
And using the flashlight under your seat,

1148
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:54,370
start to warm up that paper.

1149
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:57,710
I think your correct balance
begins to appear.

1150
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,550
Now, Art, don't worry,
we have a flashlight for you.

1151
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,920
Yes.

1152
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,060
Look.

1153
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:16,230
What's going on there, Daniel?

1154
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:17,810
Wait. This is weird. A second ago, it said

1155
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:21,860
$144,579,651.

1156
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:22,900
But now...

1157
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,440
Now it says $70,000 less.

1158
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,240
Josepha, can you stand up?

1159
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,320
Yes.

1160
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:34,240
Now, what is your new number?

1161
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:38,870
$70,562 now in my account.

1162
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,380
Is it possible that
Josepha's balance went up

1163
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,590
the exact amount that Art's went down?

1164
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:50,220
Hey. Check it out. It's happening again.

1165
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:51,680
IS it?

1166
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,430
Wow. It is.

1167
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,930
Art's balance has gone down another 280K.

1168
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,140
Dina Robertson? What did yours say?

1169
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:05,150
$281,477.

1170
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,650
We have a confession to make.

1171
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,870
She's right. We lied about something.

1172
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:14,620
Yes. None of you were chosen at random.

1173
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:17,160
All of you have one thing in common.

1174
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,620
Everyone in this room was a victim

1175
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:22,580
of the hard times that hit one of
America's most treasured cities.

1176
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:25,210
Some of you lost your houses, your cars.

1177
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:26,670
Your businesses.

1178
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:27,840
Your loved ones.

1179
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,130
But all of you were insured
by the same company.

1180
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,180
Tressler Insurance.

1181
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,470
You were abandoned.

1182
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:36,640
You were loopholed...

1183
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,930
...out of your settlements.

1184
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:41,940
This is all for show. Correct?

1185
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:44,560
"All" meaning we're doing it onstage
in front of a paying audience?

1186
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,480
- Then, yes, it's for show.
- Whoa! Whoa!

1187
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:49,280
I've got $82,000 in my bank account!

1188
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,280
It says it right here on my cell phone!

1189
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:54,660
Everybody, look at your
cell phones right now! Everybody!

1190
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,460
Is this for real?

1191
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:04,830
I don't know.

1192
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,210
<i>Is this happening?</i>

1193
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:07,960
I don't know! I can't tell!

1194
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:10,840
Hey! Did you do this?

1195
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:13,300
How could we, Art?

1196
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,510
We don't have your password.

1197
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,180
We'd need access to information

1198
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:18,140
we could never get our hands on.

1199
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:20,310
Yes, security questions, for instance, like,

1200
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,060
I don't know, your mother's maiden name

1201
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,690
or the name of your first pet.

1202
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:25,520
Where would we get that information, Art?

1203
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,650
You certainly would never tell us.

1204
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,530
<i>We got confirmation.
It's really happening. They robbed him.</i>

1205
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,370
Do not let them get away.

1206
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:38,410
Hey, we left you the jet and the Rolls.

1207
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:46,710
You got hell to pay!

1208
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:50,710
Stop!

1209
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:53,220
Stop! Nobody move!

1210
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,260
Freeze!

1211
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:58,050
Quarterback!

1212
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:02,930
We are The Four Horsemen.

1213
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:04,520
Good night.

1214
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,120
Get 'em off me!

1215
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,580
Get off! Get off me!

1216
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,130
Get off me!

1217
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,590
All right. I want everyone
on the street! Everyone!

1218
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,560
Fuller, meet me in front of the theater

1219
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,930
and bring the tracker.

1220
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,940
Let's go! Let's go! Now! Come on! Let's go!

1221
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,230
Give me the tracker.

1222
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:50,690
Let's go.

1223
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,990
FBI! Clear!

1224
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:57,950
- Dylan!
- Damn.

1225
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:58,990
What have you got?

1226
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:00,660
That's him right there. Follow the red dot.

1227
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:03,790
All right, I'll take this.
Go. Box 'em. Cut 'em off that way.

1228
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:06,790
He's turning left on Burgundy.

1229
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:45,160
Hey! Move!

1230
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:46,830
Move! Move!

1231
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:51,170
I got him heading north on Bourbon.

1232
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:53,000
- Sorry. Move, move!
- Hey!

1233
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,050
Hey, excuse me. Move, move! Excuse me.

1234
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:07,810
I've lost him at Bourbon.

1235
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,100
Damn! Where are you?

1236
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:23,870
Excuse me.

1237
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,960
He's heading south on Exchange Place.

1238
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:35,380
Stop!

1239
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,720
What are you doing?

1240
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:49,310
He's going in Napoleon House.

1241
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:52,890
Move! Move!

1242
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:55,310
Move out of the way!

1243
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:57,020
Hey!

1244
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:58,860
Move!

1245
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,450
He's in the bathroom.
I have him in the bathroom.

1246
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:05,870
No! No! No!

1247
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:08,910
Freeze!

1248
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:11,040
Lower your weapons!

1249
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:12,370
What?

1250
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:14,620
I'm tracking myself!

1251
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,090
<i>The Horsemen
left egg on the face of what they call</i>

1252
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:18,880
<i>the alphabet agencies,</i>

1253
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,090
<i>calling into question</i>

1254
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:22,470
<i>the efficacy of the FBI's task force</i>

1255
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:25,300
<i>as well as the man in charge
of the investigation,</i>

1256
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:26,850
<i>Special Agent Dylan Rhodes,</i>

1257
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:28,600
<i>who was publicly ridiculed,</i>

1258
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,560
<i>and even tackled at tonight's performance.</i>

1259
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:33,230
<i>Talk about a fumble.</i>

1260
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:35,100
<i>This is quickly becoming a national story,</i>

1261
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,190
<i>as The Horsemen have now
seemingly pulled off the impossible</i>

1262
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,690
<i>for the second time in as many days.</i>

1263
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:42,650
<i>Two nights ago in Vegas, The Horsemen</i>

1264
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:44,150
<i>seemingly robbed a bank in Paris...</i>

1265
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:45,610
Hey.

1266
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:47,950
What are you doing?

1267
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:49,370
I'm having a drink.

1268
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:53,830
I came to get you.

1269
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:55,620
I'm worried about you.

1270
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:57,290
You're worried about me.
Well, I'm worried about you.

1271
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,540
Atlas. You had him.

1272
01:01:58,630 --> 01:01:59,880
He didn't have a weapon.

1273
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,460
I couldn't shoot him and you know that.

1274
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:04,420
Yeah, but you... You let him go.

1275
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:05,800
Didn't you?

1276
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:08,050
A pretty French girl
shows up out of the blue,

1277
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:09,850
acts like she's my partner
and then she lets the bad guy go?

1278
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:11,060
Let go of my arm.

1279
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:12,810
Who exactly are you anyway?

1280
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,980
I thought you said you were a desk agent.

1281
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:23,280
Not bad.

1282
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,200
What is this?

1283
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,660
What's the Eye of Horus?

1284
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,830
Oh, certainly nothing
I want to get into tonight.

1285
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:36,500
You're dismissive enough
about me when you're sober.

1286
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,170
Find your way back yourself.

1287
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:46,340
Mr. Bradley? Mr. Tresslerwould like you
to join him for a drink.

1288
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:56,810
Sir.

1289
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:58,270
Thank you.

1290
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,860
What is your role with them?

1291
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:03,020
Role?

1292
01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:04,990
Yes. You seem to know
everything about them.

1293
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:06,820
What they're gonna do.
Where they're gonna be.

1294
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:08,700
If it makes you feel any better,

1295
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,030
this wasn't about you.

1296
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,580
Please tell me why this was not about me.

1297
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:16,910
This is a magic trick, Mr. Tressler.

1298
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,500
Played out on a global scale.

1299
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:23,840
You, sir, are the abracadabra.

1300
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:27,170
The distraction, while they
set up the real trick.

1301
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:31,550
I was a $140-million distraction?

1302
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:33,560
Yes.

1303
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:38,390
And that very ego that got you involved
with them in the first place

1304
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:40,400
is what keeps you from seeing that.

1305
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,060
- You know...
-"I can destroy you."

1306
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,570
Yes, I do know.

1307
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:45,070
Well, you won't.

1308
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:47,780
And you won't destroy them.

1309
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,950
Whatever this grand trick is,

1310
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,030
it was designed a long time ago.

1311
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:57,790
And I believe that what's about to follow
is really going to amaze.

1312
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:03,170
So I suggest
you sit back and enjoy your front row seat.

1313
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:06,300
You paid quite a lot of good money for it.

1314
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,550
Whatever you stand to make

1315
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,220
I'll double it, if you expose them now.

1316
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:15,810
And destroy them.

1317
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:18,220
I stand to make five million.

1318
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:20,190
Am I flinching?

1319
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:23,900
No, you're not.

1320
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:17,030
Good morning.

1321
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:20,910
I'm sorry. Good morning.

1322
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:23,000
I'm sorry for your arm.

1323
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:24,670
No.

1324
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:28,550
I'm sorry I was a drunken asshole.

1325
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:32,550
And I'm completely lost in this case.

1326
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:37,390
Will you please explain to me
what all this means?

1327
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,060
Okay. Sure.

1328
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:46,900
They are called "The Eye."

1329
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,280
Known for thousands of years

1330
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,570
as the keepers and protectors

1331
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:53,950
of real magic.

1332
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,240
"Candidates for initiations

1333
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,330
"must follow
a series of commands with blind obedience.

1334
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,410
"For only by taking a leap of faith

1335
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:06,080
"will their eyes truly be opened

1336
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:07,920
"to the world of miracles."

1337
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:11,380
So The Horsemen, the heists,

1338
01:06:11,590 --> 01:06:14,420
the shows, all of this is only to...

1339
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:16,050
To join "The Eye."

1340
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,470
Come on.
Don't you think that's a little extreme?

1341
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,310
I mean, I had to pledge
at a fraternity at Rutgers

1342
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:23,600
and all they asked from me
was to do four beer bongs

1343
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:26,140
and put a diaper on a squirrel.

1344
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:27,350
What?

1345
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,810
I like squirrels. I'm not a frat guy.

1346
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:31,480
It's just... Never mind, I'm an idiot.

1347
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:33,030
A sweet one.

1348
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,990
Have you ever

1349
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:42,290
felt something that you can't see

1350
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,040
but you know it's there?

1351
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:55,760
What?

1352
01:06:56,090 --> 01:06:57,970
- Shit!
- What?

1353
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:00,010
Look, a bug.

1354
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:04,060
Someone has
heard every call, read every text.

1355
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,520
That's how
they were able to stay ahead of us.

1356
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,640
God damn it!

1357
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,480
Get me Atlas' interrogation tape.

1358
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:11,360
Yes, sir. I have it on the hard drive.

1359
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:14,280
Picture's up.

1360
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:16,490
Okay, fast forward.

1361
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:18,320
Go on, go on. Freeze!

1362
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:20,910
Okay. Frame by frame. Go on.

1363
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:22,830
Play it through.

1364
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:26,250
Stop. Zoom in tighter. Tighter.

1365
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:28,500
There. That's where he took my phone.

1366
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:30,960
Is that thing transmitting?

1367
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,540
Only when
you're making a call or sending a text.

1368
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:33,750
Plus I removed the bug.

1369
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,340
All right. Put it back in
and turn on the phone.

1370
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,380
They don't know
that we know about the bug.

1371
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:39,630
As of this instant, we are ahead of them.

1372
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,800
We need to keep it that way. Understand?

1373
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:43,560
Find my real phone and track it.

1374
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,980
Already did. As of about 20 minutes ago,
it's in New York City.

1375
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:48,230
Good.

1376
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,310
I wanna cut 'em off at the knees.

1377
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,480
They got power? Cut it.

1378
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:54,980
They got phones, electricity, water? Cut it.

1379
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:56,230
Squeeze 'em out.

1380
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,110
I want 'em to feel our presence.

1381
01:07:58,150 --> 01:07:59,650
And get me an airplane!

1382
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:04,240
The firewall's down.
Do they know about this?

1383
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,330
They who?

1384
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:07,160
"They," "them," whoever we're working for.

1385
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:08,540
Who are we working for?

1386
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:10,750
And are we prepared to go to jail for them?

1387
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:11,830
Stop being paranoid.

1388
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,130
It really does happen.

1389
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:14,920
It happened to you.
Doesn't mean it's gonna happen to us.

1390
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,630
Guys, I don't know if can do this, all right.

1391
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:18,010
I don't want to go to jail, you know?

1392
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:19,880
Then don't screw up.
You're always talking about

1393
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,180
wanting to be treated like an adult.

1394
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:22,470
Now might be a good time
to start acting like one.

1395
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:24,680
Stick to the plan. Stay here and burn it all.

1396
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:38,990
I don't know what I'm doing here.

1397
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:40,190
I don't know
what you would do anywhere else.

1398
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,700
I'm here for the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

1399
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:45,160
That's it. Then I'm gone.

1400
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,410
You can do whatever you want
when this is over, Merritt.

1401
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:49,750
But until then, you stick to the plan.

1402
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:51,870
Hey, guys. They're here.

1403
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:55,710
- My guys are ready to go.
- Let's do this quickly...

1404
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:57,090
- No.
- What?

1405
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:58,380
She doesn't have jurisdiction here.

1406
01:08:58,630 --> 01:08:59,880
She's Interpol. She's with me.

1407
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,010
She stays.

1408
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:02,380
What? What?

1409
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:03,430
Stay in the car.

1410
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,890
Let's go.

1411
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,560
Okay. Let's do it.

1412
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:19,030
FBI!

1413
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:24,610
Ladies first.

1414
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,410
Don't move!

1415
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:33,920
Tell me.

1416
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,750
Is my money being well-spent?

1417
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:38,170
Exceedingly well.

1418
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,420
Now you tell me,

1419
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,880
how do you like your Horsemen?

1420
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:46,090
Fricasseed or fried?

1421
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:47,390
Shredded.

1422
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:49,930
I'll tell the Chef.

1423
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:06,510
Freeze!

1424
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,680
Dylan!

1425
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:16,810
Hold on!

1426
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:20,190
You little...

1427
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:25,690
Come here!

1428
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:29,360
Five is clear. Standing by for six.

1429
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:30,740
You little Shit!

1430
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:31,870
You little Shit!

1431
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:34,120
- What game are you playing?
- What game are you playing?

1432
01:11:34,450 --> 01:11:36,540
We're all good at six. Move to seven.

1433
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:38,620
Copy that. Going to seven. Go, go, go!

1434
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:41,580
Hey!

1435
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:44,550
Come here!

1436
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:16,740
Come here!

1437
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:18,540
All right, hold on, hold on!

1438
01:12:20,410 --> 01:12:22,250
- Really?
- Yup.

1439
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:27,260
You...

1440
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,180
You little...

1441
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,440
Shit!

1442
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:04,830
Shit!

1443
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:07,630
Give me that!

1444
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,320
<i>All units, cover the north exit now!</i>

1445
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,820
Clear on Evan.

1446
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:30,650
<i>Block every possible exit.</i>

1447
01:13:30,690 --> 01:13:31,940
Hey! Get back. Shit.

1448
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:35,910
- FBI. Sort of. I need your car. Thanks.
- What?

1449
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:36,990
What?

1450
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:40,580
Stop! Stop!

1451
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:57,760
Hey!

1452
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:28,670
Good. Follow him!

1453
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:31,670
Don't ever tell me to stay in the car. Ever.

1454
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:32,960
Fine! Now go!

1455
01:14:57,780 --> 01:14:58,820
There he is!

1456
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:10,960
Move!

1457
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:16,510
Left!

1458
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:20,680
We're heading east on the FDR Drive.

1459
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,680
- This is not east.
- North! North!

1460
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:24,970
<i>We're coming to you live above the FDR,</i>

1461
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:27,980
<i>where NYPD
and federal agents, as you now see,</i>

1462
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:29,940
<i>are engaged in a high-speed pursuit,</i>

1463
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:31,270
<i>following a black sedan.</i>

1464
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,240
<i>Fuller, where are you?</i>

1465
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:39,410
Right here. Trying to catch up to you now.

1466
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:41,620
<i>We're now trying to get you a better shot.</i>

1467
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:45,240
Come on!

1468
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,080
<i>It looks like they're turning</i>

1469
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:54,250
<i>onto the 59th Street Bridge.</i>

1470
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:57,800
<i>As soon as we have them within range,</i>

1471
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,800
<i>we will bring you those pictures live.</i>

1472
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:06,520
Good. Just stay with him.

1473
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,150
Go, go, go!

1474
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:20,700
Behind... You're behind the bus!

1475
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,330
Get over!

1476
01:16:28,910 --> 01:16:29,960
Oh, shit!

1477
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:51,520
Come here!

1478
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:54,190
Get back! Get back!

1479
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:56,980
Dylan, let's go, man!

1480
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:58,190
Come on, you...

1481
01:16:59,690 --> 01:17:01,740
- Come on, man! Get out!
- He's gonna die in here.

1482
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:03,200
Leave him! There's nothing you can do!

1483
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,200
Let's go! Leave him!

1484
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,370
-The Paper!
- Dylan!

1485
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:13,540
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

1486
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,950
Dylan, they just
figured out what the paper was in Jack's car.

1487
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,330
So they know what it is?

1488
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:54,120
And why the kid died trying to protect it.

1489
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:55,880
Evans is on his way to brief us right now.

1490
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,500
Let's go.

1491
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:58,920
You're gonna wanna take this first, though.

1492
01:17:58,960 --> 01:17:59,960
What's that?

1493
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,340
Your friend Thaddeus Bradley.

1494
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:03,840
Rhodes.

1495
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:05,760
You do understand the function

1496
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:08,010
of the magician's assistant,
don't you, Agent Rhodes?

1497
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:09,810
Yeah, she's there to distract them

1498
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:11,100
while he sets up the trick.

1499
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:14,440
You'd be right if you weren't so wrong.

1500
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:16,600
<i>While you're watching the magician,</i>

1501
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,690
<i>that lovely innocent
is actually pulling the strings.</i>

1502
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:23,030
<i>Don't you find it peculiar
that Interpol would send you</i>

1503
01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:26,570
a first timer off the desk
to be your assistant?

1504
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:29,200
Why did she request to be put on the case?

1505
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:31,540
She was assigned to the case.

1506
01:18:32,410 --> 01:18:33,790
Luck of the draw.

1507
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:37,460
Like choosing a random card in the deck.

1508
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:41,210
I find it odd, your sudden act of generosity.

1509
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,420
What's in it for you?

1510
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:44,420
Just trying to even the game.

1511
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:48,640
I feel like I'm playing with somebody
wearing ankle weights and flippers.

1512
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:53,560
Keep up, Agent Rhodes. Keep up.

1513
01:18:57,390 --> 01:18:58,480
Hey.

1514
01:18:58,770 --> 01:18:59,980
We got a problem.

1515
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:02,270
Here's the safe.

1516
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,780
No, no, no. Hey.

1517
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:05,150
What's he doing here?

1518
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:06,900
Giving us our first solid lead.

1519
01:19:06,990 --> 01:19:08,860
We've been investigating
a private security contractor

1520
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:10,160
called Elkhorn

1521
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,160
-for the last five years.
- And?

1522
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:13,910
They've been hiding close
to a half billion dollars...

1523
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:16,460
I didn't ask you. I asked him.

1524
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:19,170
The money's in a vault inside
a warehouse in Queens.

1525
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:21,840
We think this vault
is your magicians' final target.

1526
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,960
The magician who died on the bridge...

1527
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,470
You pulled our classified Elkhorn file
right from his crispy little hand.

1528
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,840
And despite their bullshit
Robin Hood razzle-dazzle,

1529
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,010
your magicians are nothing
more than common thieves.

1530
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,310
How did they get the file?

1531
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:35,600
This is the part you're gonna find

1532
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,640
particularly interesting, Agent Rhodes.

1533
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:40,190
They patched to my server
after they accessed

1534
01:19:40,230 --> 01:19:42,520
your mobile command center
in New Orleans

1535
01:19:42,610 --> 01:19:44,190
with codes they got from your phone.

1536
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:48,200
You ordered us all out to chase after them.

1537
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:51,200
The level of incompetence
displayed on this case,

1538
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:53,780
that's a magic trick in and of itself.

1539
01:19:53,870 --> 01:19:56,120
Abracadabra. I'm taking over.

1540
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:59,460
Boss, he's taking over?

1541
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Let's go, gentlemen.

1542
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:04,750
Hey.

1543
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,380
Hey. I want to have a word with you.

1544
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:07,630
Don't ever talk to me like that again.

1545
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,760
- Why the hell did you take this case?
- What?

1546
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,010
People say I'm "hard to read."
That's an American expression.

1547
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:13,550
Do you understand it?

1548
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,640
Yes.

1549
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:17,020
Good, then let me make myself
perfectly clear to you.

1550
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:19,480
If I find out that you are anything other than

1551
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:20,730
who you say you are, I swear...

1552
01:20:20,810 --> 01:20:22,560
And we French also have an expression.

1553
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,150
"Faith can move mountains."

1554
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,070
If we hope to capture The Horsemen,

1555
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,990
then you need to have a little faith in me.

1556
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,200
Because I've done nothing
to deserve otherwise.

1557
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:35,030
I just got my ass handed to me.

1558
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,660
I am losing this case.

1559
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:40,080
So faith is a luxury
I don't have any time for right now.

1560
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:53,300
<i>Approaching the warehouse.</i>

1561
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:56,100
<i>Units 5 and 6
cover the north and south entrances.</i>

1562
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:57,430
<i>We are going for the vault.</i>

1563
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:05,190
Hey. Where's the safe? Where's the safe?

1564
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,400
What is this?

1565
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:11,780
Where the hell is the goddamn safe?

1566
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:13,700
We just moved it while you were outside.

1567
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:15,070
- Evans' orders.
- What?

1568
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,200
I never said that.

1569
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:17,620
Sir, you got a phone call

1570
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:19,330
and said Washington wants the safe moved.

1571
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:21,460
You never heard that
come out of my mouth, agent.

1572
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:22,580
What happened?

1573
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:24,880
You tell me what's going on,
because this is bullshit!

1574
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,040
No!

1575
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,430
Jesus Christ.

1576
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:36,640
Sir? Sir? What are you doing?

1577
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,560
I think it's Beethoven's Concerto <i>in</i> D-Major.

1578
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:39,640
Where's the safe?

1579
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,810
His team is loading the truck.

1580
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,770
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

1581
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,480
- Stop the truck!
- Stop!

1582
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,650
- Stop!
- Hey! Stop that truck!

1583
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:03,160
What the hell's going on?
We got our orders.

1584
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:05,000
Now you've got new orders. Open it up.

1585
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,750
Okay. Here's what I want.

1586
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:13,090
At this moment,
they think that safe's leaving this site.

1587
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:14,510
So we stay with it.

1588
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:16,470
We follow it
all the way to... Where's it going?

1589
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:17,800
5 Pointz. Up the street.

1590
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:21,140
So we go to 5 Pointz.
Wherever the safe goes, we go.

1591
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:22,430
It'll lead us right to 'em.

1592
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:24,520
You two are with me.

1593
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,410
Guys.

1594
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:41,870
Look. Office just called with this.

1595
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:43,830
Horsemen posted it to YouTube
20 minutes ago.

1596
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:47,790
<i>The point of why we're here
is to say that we are not...</i>

1597
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,880
<i>We cannot quit now.</i>

1598
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,550
<i>We've started something
bigger than all of us.</i>

1599
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:54,300
<i>We have to finish it.</i>

1600
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:56,930
<i>Remember the name Jack Wilder
when you see us live,</i>

1601
01:22:57,010 --> 01:22:58,890
<i>5 Pointz, Queens, 7:00.</i>

1602
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:00,220
Their show is in a half an hour.

1603
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:01,560
It's exactly where we're headed.

1604
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,850
I don't know, boss.
I don't wanna be the naysayer,

1605
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:06,060
but these guys are kinda tricky.

1606
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:08,730
Rhodes, they're entertainers.

1607
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:13,400
<i>A stunning turnout here in 5 Pointz</i>

1608
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:17,320
<i>as the renegade Horsemen
taunt the FBI into a final showdown.</i>

1609
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,820
<i>The Horsemen have invited
us to their final round</i>

1610
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:21,070
<i>of their three-act face-off with the FBI.</i>

1611
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:24,910
<i>What do they have in store?
We're about to find out.</i>

1612
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:38,550
<i>All eyes on the truck.
Let's see who approaches.</i>

1613
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:39,930
Copy that.

1614
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:57,950
<i>Agents Rhodes, Fuller?</i>

1615
01:23:58,610 --> 01:23:59,610
Go, for us.

1616
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:02,410
We've got movement.
Someone's walking toward the truck.

1617
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:03,990
<i>It's a woman.</i>

1618
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:08,910
- Freeze!
- Oh, shit!

1619
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:12,210
What the hell's going on?

1620
01:24:13,290 --> 01:24:15,630
Hey! It's the guy from the TV.

1621
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:16,760
Put your guns down.

1622
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:19,800
Look who it is. The fifth Horseman.

1623
01:24:19,970 --> 01:24:20,970
Are you kidding?

1624
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:22,890
I'm following them, just like you are.

1625
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:24,600
I'm not following anybody anymore.

1626
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:26,390
You've been ahead of us this whole time.

1627
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:28,100
But guess what? I'm ahead of you now.

1628
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:29,940
Your ass is mine.

1629
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:31,900
You guys are still idiots.

1630
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:33,150
Yeah?

1631
01:24:33,230 --> 01:24:34,310
This happens to be the former

1632
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:36,480
rehearsal space for Lionel Shrike.

1633
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:38,780
It's where I did my first show.

1634
01:24:38,990 --> 01:24:41,780
Now, if you wanna look
like even bigger idiots,

1635
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:43,240
why not open it?

1636
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,240
And while you're doing it, Agent Rhodes,

1637
01:24:45,530 --> 01:24:47,160
would you mind reenacting your look

1638
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:49,290
of absolute befuddlement for me?

1639
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:51,540
It will make a wonderful cover for my DVD.

1640
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:54,170
Open the safe.

1641
01:24:54,210 --> 01:24:55,710
- Go ahead.
- Open it.

1642
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:01,090
What the hell?

1643
01:25:03,510 --> 01:25:04,600
What?

1644
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:05,930
Give me that.

1645
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:07,180
No.

1646
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:08,350
No!

1647
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:14,020
What is this?

1648
01:25:15,150 --> 01:25:16,150
Get back!

1649
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:25,870
Who doesn't love a good magic trick?

1650
01:25:26,530 --> 01:25:28,870
They have you chasing empty safes again.

1651
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:33,370
Once again, misdirection.

1652
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:42,010
The show is starting. Move out!

1653
01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:44,550
The question
I'd be asking now, Agent Rhodes is,

1654
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:47,180
"What happened to the real one?"

1655
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:09,580
Clear! Clear 'em out!

1656
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:11,240
Come on. Move 'em out.
Move 'em out of the way.

1657
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:14,540
FBI! Give me a path!

1658
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:16,750
Clear out! Clear out!

1659
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,380
<i>What is magic?</i>

1660
01:26:19,210 --> 01:26:20,250
<i>Magic is deception.</i>

1661
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:22,090
<i>But deception designed to delight,</i>

1662
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:24,010
<i>to entertain, to inspire.</i>

1663
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:26,550
Look out! Clear! Clear! Look out!

1664
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:28,050
<i>It is about belief.</i>

1665
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:29,100
<i>Faith.</i>

1666
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:30,220
<i>Trust.</i>

1667
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:35,600
<i>Without those qualities,</i>

1668
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:39,110
<i>magic, as an art form,
would no longer exist.</i>

1669
01:26:39,690 --> 01:26:41,530
<i>But what happens if these qualities</i>

1670
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:43,690
<i>are not used for their higher purpose?</i>

1671
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:46,700
<i>And instead they're used to cheat, lie.</i>

1672
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:49,120
<i>For personal gain or for greed.</i>

1673
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,950
<i>Then it's no longer magic.</i>

1674
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:52,200
<i>It's crime.</i>

1675
01:26:52,410 --> 01:26:55,460
<i>So tonight, for our final act,</i>

1676
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:58,330
<i>you're gonna help us set a few things right.</i>

1677
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:03,630
What's going on here, Rhodes?

1678
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:05,050
I don't know.

1679
01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:07,300
Showtime.

1680
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:13,470
Look!

1681
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:19,730
There they are on the roof. Let's move!

1682
01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:21,110
Go, go, go!

1683
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:23,150
- Dylan!
- FBI, coming through!

1684
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:25,780
What are you doing here?

1685
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:26,990
They're going in the wrong direction

1686
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:28,160
and you know it.

1687
01:27:28,450 --> 01:27:30,780
Rhodes! I need all personnel now!

1688
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:34,240
You need to trust me.
Take your leap of faith.

1689
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:36,160
Wait.

1690
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:37,750
I'm going to go with her.

1691
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:39,170
Go. I got your back. I'll be right here.

1692
01:27:56,270 --> 01:28:00,310
Let's go, let's go! Now, now, now!

1693
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:12,530
Daniel?

1694
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,370
Yeah?

1695
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:19,120
As our, let's call it,
year of living dangerously

1696
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:22,670
comes to a close,
in a rare moment of vulnerability,

1697
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,550
I'd like to express a sentiment

1698
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:27,210
to you about our relationship.

1699
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:28,510
Okay.

1700
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:32,390
Well, when I first met you,
I thought you were kind of a

1701
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:35,220
dick.

1702
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:37,770
And?

1703
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,230
No, that's it.

1704
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:42,480
That's very nice.

1705
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,060
- Yeah.
- I'm touched.

1706
01:28:44,230 --> 01:28:45,690
Yeah. Just from the heart.

1707
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:47,480
Well, I didn't tell you where I was touched.

1708
01:28:47,610 --> 01:28:48,650
Oh, you!

1709
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:53,910
Oh, God.
What are we gonna do when this is over?

1710
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:55,240
We're on our own.

1711
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:56,990
Our instructions run out after the show.

1712
01:28:57,910 --> 01:28:59,790
Even if there is no "Eye,"

1713
01:28:59,870 --> 01:29:01,580
if we were completely played and we spend

1714
01:29:01,710 --> 01:29:03,710
the next 20 years in jail, then,

1715
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:05,920
I just want to say that...

1716
01:29:06,170 --> 01:29:08,550
I know. Me, too.

1717
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,800
Little too sentimental for me.

1718
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:19,850
There they are!

1719
01:29:22,850 --> 01:29:25,610
Go grab 'em! Put 'em down! Go, go, go!

1720
01:29:25,730 --> 01:29:26,730
Grab 'em!

1721
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:32,780
Get up!

1722
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:34,410
What the hell?

1723
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:39,370
Shit!

1724
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:49,840
Hello, New York!

1725
01:29:58,310 --> 01:30:00,270
Thank you for the magic.

1726
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:01,600
And thank you for being such

1727
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:04,640
an incredible and dedicated audience.

1728
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:07,110
Unfortunately, like all good things,

1729
01:30:07,150 --> 01:30:08,940
it must come to an end.

1730
01:30:11,650 --> 01:30:14,150
So we would like to start our show tonight...

1731
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:15,780
By saying goodbye.

1732
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,490
All we wanted was to

1733
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:20,540
bring the world to a magic show.

1734
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:22,120
And thereby bring a little magic

1735
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:23,330
back to the world.

1736
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:28,500
Clear the way!

1737
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:41,470
This has been
one hell of a ride for all of us.

1738
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,350
But it's time for us to disappear.

1739
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:45,850
Good night, New York.

1740
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:47,520
And thank you for believing in us.

1741
01:30:50,190 --> 01:30:51,320
Stop!

1742
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:55,820
Freeze!

1743
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:57,410
No!

1744
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:16,800
God damn it!

1745
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:47,750
I'm sorry.

1746
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:51,040
You were right. It's bigger than all of us.

1747
01:31:52,170 --> 01:31:56,260
This is one time I'm not happy being right.

1748
01:31:58,340 --> 01:32:00,090
So I guess this is it.

1749
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:03,260
IS it?

1750
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:30,790
Dylan!

1751
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,380
Dylan! Dylan!

1752
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:34,750
Hey.

1753
01:32:36,090 --> 01:32:38,010
- You see that?
- What?

1754
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:43,010
Where's the real money?

1755
01:32:57,190 --> 01:33:01,150
You're under arrest! Hands in the air! Now!

1756
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:53,460
I've been framed.

1757
01:33:54,790 --> 01:33:55,830
I'm sure you were.

1758
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,210
Yeah, but I can prove it.

1759
01:33:57,710 --> 01:33:58,960
I always do.

1760
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:01,340
Just like I predicted that you'd play the fool.

1761
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:03,880
Let's just drop the theatricality, all right?

1762
01:34:04,130 --> 01:34:06,300
The cameras aren't rolling in here.

1763
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:09,060
Fellas, can I have a few minutes
with my friend here alone, please.

1764
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:10,930
Sure.

1765
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:16,940
All right.

1766
01:34:17,980 --> 01:34:19,610
I got information to trade.

1767
01:34:19,730 --> 01:34:20,900
I believe that's how it's done. Huh?

1768
01:34:21,110 --> 01:34:22,740
If it's of some value.

1769
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:28,370
These bars give a man time to think.

1770
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:32,830
And I'm pretty sure I know how they did it.

1771
01:34:33,290 --> 01:34:35,420
<i>Remember the rabbit trick
in the second show?</i>

1772
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:38,420
<i>The box was never empty.</i>

1773
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:41,920
<i>The room wasn't either.</i>

1774
01:34:43,210 --> 01:34:45,590
<i>After gaining access to the warehouse,</i>

1775
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:48,050
<i>The Horsemen left the real safe</i>

1776
01:34:48,090 --> 01:34:50,510
<i>and transformed the whole room</i>

1777
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:53,100
<i>into a giant rabbit box.</i>

1778
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,850
<i>You go charging in there,</i>

1779
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:59,520
<i>thinking the safe was already gone.</i>

1780
01:34:59,770 --> 01:35:00,770
Hey!

1781
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:02,110
Hey! Stop!

1782
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,780
Missing the trick. Again.

1783
01:35:03,820 --> 01:35:04,860
Which was to make you think

1784
01:35:05,110 --> 01:35:06,650
the safe had already been stolen,

1785
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:08,950
so you'd drop your guard and leave.

1786
01:35:09,530 --> 01:35:12,490
<i>Now, while you were busy
playing with balloon animals,</i>

1787
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:15,290
<i>someone was breaking into the warehouse.</i>

1788
01:35:33,810 --> 01:35:34,970
<i>Who?</i>

1789
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:37,890
<i>Jack Wilder.</i>

1790
01:35:38,650 --> 01:35:39,980
Holy shit.

1791
01:35:40,190 --> 01:35:42,570
No. No way. He died
right in front of my eyes.

1792
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,490
Unless, of course, he didn't.

1793
01:35:52,830 --> 01:35:54,080
It's locked.

1794
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:56,080
Weren't you listening?

1795
01:35:56,580 --> 01:35:57,660
Nothing's ever locked.

1796
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:01,830
Well done, Mr. Wilder! Good work.

1797
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,840
You're a big boy now, Jack.

1798
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,380
He escaped in a standard FBI vehicle, right?

1799
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:11,510
<i>Led you to the bridge.</i>

1800
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,390
<i>Where the other Horsemen were waiting</i>

1801
01:36:13,510 --> 01:36:15,390
<i>with an identical replacement car.</i>

1802
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:17,390
<i>It only took a split second</i>

1803
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,520
<i>for you to lose contact with it</i>

1804
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:19,560
<i>and make the switch.</i>

1805
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:44,880
<i>When you crawled into that burning car,</i>

1806
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:47,260
<i>quite heroically, I might add,</i>

1807
01:36:49,130 --> 01:36:51,220
<i>you almost died trying to rescue</i>

1808
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:54,300
<i>what I assume was
a cadaver from the morgue.</i>

1809
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:59,480
<i>Why go through
such an elaborate and dangerous plan</i>

1810
01:37:00,230 --> 01:37:01,730
just to frame one guy?

1811
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:03,100
I don't know.

1812
01:37:03,230 --> 01:37:04,650
They never kept any of the money they took.

1813
01:37:04,730 --> 01:37:07,150
Yeah, that's the part
I haven't been able to put together yet.

1814
01:37:07,230 --> 01:37:09,940
But I just gave you information that
is substantially more important.

1815
01:37:10,070 --> 01:37:11,780
- No. Not really.
- What?

1816
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:16,410
I finally got a chance to
really look into Lionel Shrike.

1817
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:19,450
His comeback attempt. His accident.

1818
01:37:20,410 --> 01:37:23,920
The insurer who denied the family's claim?

1819
01:37:24,130 --> 01:37:25,340
Tressler Insurance.

1820
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:29,510
The bank that carried the note?

1821
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:32,260
Credit Republican of Paris.

1822
01:37:32,470 --> 01:37:34,090
Credit Republicain de Paris.

1823
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:36,890
What do you make of that?

1824
01:37:36,930 --> 01:37:39,100
A sucker is born every minute.

1825
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:42,440
What if all this was just leading up to

1826
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:45,270
us getting mugged
in Central Park at 2:00 a.m.?

1827
01:37:45,310 --> 01:37:48,070
No, I'm telling you,
we're right where we need to be.

1828
01:37:48,110 --> 01:37:49,230
We just have to find...

1829
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,400
That?

1830
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:54,660
The Lionel Shrike tree.

1831
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:58,120
And the card encased in glass.

1832
01:37:59,450 --> 01:38:01,080
What do we do now?

1833
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:19,180
Oh, nice!

1834
01:38:35,030 --> 01:38:36,490
<i>So, here's my new theory.</i>

1835
01:38:36,990 --> 01:38:40,410
The legend is that the "Eye" is everywhere.

1836
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:42,250
Waiting

1837
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:46,420
for the truly great magicians
to distinguish themselves

1838
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:49,170
from the mediocre ones.

1839
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,210
Maybe that was you.

1840
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:54,090
Deep down inside
you wanted nothing more

1841
01:38:54,170 --> 01:38:56,840
than to be part of the "Eye,"
but you were never invited.

1842
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:00,050
So you try to destroy them.
But instead what happens?

1843
01:39:00,510 --> 01:39:02,010
You pissed them off.

1844
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:06,770
The Eye isn't real.

1845
01:39:06,850 --> 01:39:09,940
Okay, then, explain then.
Who's behind all this?

1846
01:39:10,190 --> 01:39:11,520
Somebody with an obsession.

1847
01:39:11,770 --> 01:39:13,190
- Meticulous.
- Who?

1848
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:16,610
Somebody prepared to sacrifice everything.

1849
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:19,280
Somebody so prepared to lose

1850
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:21,870
that they wouldn't even be a suspect
until the trick was done.

1851
01:39:21,950 --> 01:39:24,790
I don't want a profile.
I need a name. Who? Who?

1852
01:39:24,870 --> 01:39:26,540
I don't know who.

1853
01:39:26,910 --> 01:39:29,130
But they had to have
access to the warehouse

1854
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:30,540
to plant the mirrors.

1855
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:35,720
Always a step ahead of me. And the FBI.

1856
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:39,050
Got past them not once,
not twice, but consistently.

1857
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:42,010
Almost as if they were on the...

1858
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:56,280
The inside.

1859
01:40:08,410 --> 01:40:09,460
You.

1860
01:40:14,090 --> 01:40:15,090
Why?

1861
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,260
That is the question, isn't it?

1862
01:40:19,090 --> 01:40:20,640
You're right.

1863
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:23,600
I can't tell you how long I've waited

1864
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:25,640
to see the look on your face.

1865
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:29,600
Who are you?

1866
01:40:30,690 --> 01:40:32,100
What do you want from me?

1867
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:34,440
What do I want?

1868
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:37,780
I want you to spend
the rest of your life in this cell,

1869
01:40:37,860 --> 01:40:41,860
staring at four walls
and wondering how you missed it.

1870
01:40:42,530 --> 01:40:45,620
How you let yourself
be so blinded by your ego

1871
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:48,620
that you convinced yourself
that you were one step ahead

1872
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:51,460
when you were always two steps behind.

1873
01:40:56,130 --> 01:40:57,340
Dylan?

1874
01:40:58,300 --> 01:40:59,300
Wait a minute.

1875
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:02,470
Dylan! How did this happen?

1876
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:11,810
Dylan!

1877
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:12,940
Why?

1878
01:41:13,650 --> 01:41:14,650
Why?

1879
01:41:18,650 --> 01:41:20,820
Oh, my God.

1880
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:23,700
I did not see that coming.

1881
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:25,070
That's impossible!

1882
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:26,160
No way.

1883
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:28,660
That was actually pretty good.

1884
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:30,160
Thank you.

1885
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:32,830
When I said,
"Always be the smartest guy in the room."

1886
01:41:32,870 --> 01:41:33,920
We were in agreement.

1887
01:41:34,170 --> 01:41:35,330
Okay. Right.

1888
01:41:35,710 --> 01:41:36,710
Henley.

1889
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:39,340
I've never seen her speechless.

1890
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:41,010
I take that as a huge compliment.

1891
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:44,390
Hey, man,
I'm so sorry for kicking your ass. Really.

1892
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:46,680
Hey, listen, for the record,

1893
01:41:46,850 --> 01:41:50,350
I have always been a 100% believer.

1894
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:52,770
And the amount of energy
I have expended to keep

1895
01:41:52,850 --> 01:41:55,020
these infidels on point...

1896
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:57,110
Merritt, you're in.

1897
01:41:57,940 --> 01:41:59,030
God bless.

1898
01:41:59,110 --> 01:42:00,150
Come.

1899
01:42:01,190 --> 01:42:04,360
The real magic is taking
four strong solo acts

1900
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:06,450
and making them all work together.

1901
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:08,990
And that's exactly what you did.

1902
01:42:09,950 --> 01:42:11,040
So welcome.

1903
01:42:14,370 --> 01:42:16,420
Welcome to the Eye.

1904
01:43:23,610 --> 01:43:25,700
It was all connected.

1905
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:29,320
Credit Republican. Tressler Insurance.

1906
01:43:38,710 --> 01:43:40,000
And Elkhorn?

1907
01:43:40,130 --> 01:43:42,040
What's the connection to Shrike?

1908
01:43:44,550 --> 01:43:47,760
Elkhorn started as a safe manufacturer.

1909
01:43:48,090 --> 01:43:50,220
They used cheap steel.

1910
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:53,100
They cut corners.

1911
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:56,430
When he got
to the bottom of the river, the safe warped.

1912
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:57,850
And he was trapped.

1913
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:01,110
He was your father.

1914
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:04,360
Of course.

1915
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:06,690
I was 12 years old.

1916
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:08,150
And from that moment on,

1917
01:44:08,490 --> 01:44:11,070
I created a persona.

1918
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:13,620
I planned. I worked out every detail.

1919
01:44:13,660 --> 01:44:17,000
But the one thing
that I couldn't imagine happening

1920
01:44:17,410 --> 01:44:18,580
was you.

1921
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:23,090
I know that the logical conclusion for you

1922
01:44:23,710 --> 01:44:26,300
is to take this case to its resolution.

1923
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:29,590
And for you to turn me in.

1924
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:35,770
Yeah.

1925
01:44:37,730 --> 01:44:41,560
But you know how I feel
about resolution and logic.

1926
01:44:42,940 --> 01:44:44,270
And you also know

1927
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:49,360
that I think some things
are best left unexplained.

1928
01:44:55,990 --> 01:44:57,790
One more secret to lock away.

1929
01:45:25,230 --> 01:45:26,730
<i>Come in close.</i>

1930
01:45:27,230 --> 01:45:28,480
<i>Closer.</i>

1931
01:45:28,570 --> 01:45:30,820
<i>Because now you know our secret.</i>

1932
01:45:30,900 --> 01:45:33,240
<i>We could be anywhere. Watching you.</i>

1933
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:37,540
<i>We're looking for someone
to help us with our next trick.</i>

1934
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:40,120
<i>On the count of three, open your eyes</i>

1935
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:42,160
<i>and tell me what you see.</i>

1936
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:44,250
<i>One.</i>

1937
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:45,380
<i>Two...</i>
