00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,240
No.

185
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,480
No fucking way.

186
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,760
Have you ever eaten hedgehog, Michael?

187
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,920
[laughter]

188
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,760
I'm getting back in this car.

189
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,560
Michael, you are number two
on Luca Changretta's hit list.

190
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,200
Yeah, and I will stay in a hotel.

191
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,720
You stay in a hotel,

192
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,360
I'll know where you are,

193
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,040
so will the people who take you there,

194
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,800
so will the people who work in the hotel.

195
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,200
And hotels don't move around.

196
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,240
They don't even know
where they will be tomorrow.

197
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,400
They follow the patrin and the crows.

198
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,520
And if anyone should come
for you, Michael,

199
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,200
the Palmers and the Boswells
will put up a fair fight.

200
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,320
[Polly] Take your medicine.

201
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,080
I'll take them.

202
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,280
Your painkillers.

203
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,920
But the healers up there
will heal you much quicker.

204
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,080
Fucking witches, the lot of them.

205
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,440
Show some respect, Mr. Gray.

206
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,560
They've agreed to welcome you
on account of your blood.

207
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,880
Take your medicine.

208
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,360
Take the gun.

209
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,280
I won't be able to contact you.

210
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,120
So, you phone me.

211
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,120
We'll make a plan.

212
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,000
Tommy says it won't be long.

213
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,040
Then we'll be free.

214
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,360
You might learn something.

215
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,600
Tell them your grandmother
was a gypsy princess.

216
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,960
Name of Birdy Boswell.

217
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,040
You're royalty up there, Michael.

218
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,480
[horses neighing]

219
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,840
[Aberama] Is that true, Mrs. Gray?

220
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,400
What?

221
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,200
Don't I look like royalty?

222
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,440
Well, now that you've mentioned it,
you do.

223
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,120
I've been cooped up
in Small Heath too long.

224
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,080
I can smell spring in the air.

225
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,320
Do you know a longer way back, Mr. Gold?

226
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,680
I know ways back that would take forever.

227
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,840
Get in, your majesty.

228
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,400
I thought you were a busy woman.

229
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,120
Do you have time for this?

230
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,760
-Is it a buck?
-It is a buck.

231
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,040
Good. Bucks taste better.

232
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,560
In the smoke, I'm 16 again.

233
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,920
You know, when the police were after him,
my dad used to take us out.

234
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,480
We'd be gone for days
living on what he caught.

235
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,040
Oh!

236
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,040
Do you have a sharp knife?

237
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,680
I hear you have second sight.

238
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,560
I heard that you speak with the dead.

239
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,920
Yes.

240
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,680
Your wife is often around you.
She watches you.

241
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,600
She watching me now?

242
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,040
No.

243
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,000
Your family were healers?

244
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,240
Yeah, a long time ago.

245
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Came back when I put my head
in the noose.

246
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,440
It's like putting your head through
a window and seeing the whole world.

247
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,240
Give me the rabbit and the knife.

248
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,440
You know, Polly...

249
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,560
I believe it's you that has kept
Tommy Shelby alive all these years.

250
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,760
Oh, we've kept each other alive.

251
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,280
But I didn't just put my head
through that window.

252
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,120
I climbed through it.

253
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,760
At first, I thought it was madness but no,

254
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,160
when you put your head
out of that window...

255
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,320
you can do anything you want.

256
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,920
'Cause there are no rules. 'Cause there are no risks.

257
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,920
Now, give me the knife.

258
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,040
Now, come here.

259
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,080
I can do whatever I want

260
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,120
whenever the mood takes me

261
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,080
and you're a strong handsome man

262
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,280
and this is a beautiful place
in the world.

263
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,800
And it is... this time.

264
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,240
But let me make
one thing clear, Mr. Gold,

265
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,720
I just gave Michael a little speech

266
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
about how no one
would know where to find him.

267
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,600
But you would know how to get him.

268
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,560
If any harm comes to Michael,

269
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,120
you shall have me as your enemy

270
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,280
and none of your knives can kill me.

271
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,840
Do you understand?

272
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,120
Oh, I understand.

273
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,080
[speaks in Romani]

274
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,080
Mr. Solomons.

275
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,720
Hmm?

276
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,680
My little cousin was born blind.

277
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,000
As a result,

278
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,920
I now donate a considerable
sum of money to a charity

279
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,040
which gives dogs with eyes to blind Jews.

280
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,680
The chairman of the board

281
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,560
recommends that those of us
who are blessed with the gift of sight

282
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,120
and that we spend at least half an hour
of our day with our eyes closed

283
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,600
so that we may...
We may have a better understanding

284
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:40,760
with the darkness and also
to increase our donations and that.

285
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,800
Hmm.

286
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,440
What time is it?

287
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,920
Twenty-nine minutes past eight.

288
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,400
Right, well then, I have another minute
to go actually but you...

289
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,720
you can begin, go on.

290
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,920
[smacks lips]

291
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,960
I'm Luca Changretta.

292
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,280
Oh, yeah, I know who you are. Hmm.

293
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,680
You are a bit of a failure, aren't you?

294
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,840
You come all the way over here
to this country

295
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,240
in order to kill Tommy Shelby,
but I mean...

296
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,400
Well, he is not dead is he, so...

297
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,040
-No.
-No.

298
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,400
He ain't.

299
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,600
How much time have I got left, mate?

300
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,480
Ten seconds. Nine seconds, eight seconds,

301
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,680
five, four, three,

302
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,840
two, one.

303
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,200
Right. Hello.

304
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,000
How can I help you?

305
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,240
I have a proposition for you.

306
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,240
Mmm... Yeah. I already know what you want.

307
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,520
-Yeah.
-I just want to hear you say it out loud.

308
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,920
So I can check how ridiculous it is.

309
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,200
[speaking in Italian]

310
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,280
I am losing my patience.

311
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,200
[Matteo] Luca.

312
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,240
-[grunts]
-[speaking Italian]

313
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,280
That's the way he is.

314
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,160
And we need him.

315
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,360
[in English] There is gonna be
a little fight, a boxing match.

316
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,200
Between your boy and Tommy Shelby's boy.

317
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,200
-Right, Birmingham?
-Mmm-hmm.

318
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,760
And the whole Shelby family
is gonna be there.

319
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,720
Mmm-hmm.

320
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,320
And you, Mr. Solomons,
you too will be there.

321
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,920
[stutters]

322
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,840
That's it.

323
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,800
I tell you what, right.

324
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,720
Here is a gift. It's free.

325
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,000
Souvenir of your visit here.

326
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,720
Goodbye, trot on.
Down there is Bonnie Street.

327
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,520
You know they say you're a smart guy.

328
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,000
[chuckles]

329
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,840
You already know
what we want before we say it.

330
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,840
That's funny 'cause now I believe

331
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:22,120
I know what you want
even before you say it. Yeah.

332
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,560
So, are you gonna taste it?

333
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,840
[speaking Italian]

334
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,920
Damn fucking straight, mate.

335
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,880
Otherwise, you wouldn't still be breathing
my oxygen, would you?

336
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,360
Because I have 200 barrels a month.

337
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,360
Yeah, cleared by your people,
distributed through your teams...

338
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,880
Thing is that people want gin these days.

339
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,080
Well, the exit is still out there.
Right on Bonnie Street. Yeah?

340
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,800
[Luca chuckles]

341
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,160
[Luca] Oh,
you fucking crazy, you know that?

342
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,520
Two hundred barrels, huh?

343
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,040
[speaks Italian]

344
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,000
[Alfie] And also, I want some cash.

345
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,040
Don't worry, 'cause I've broken it
down here. I've got here a list of costs

346
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,440
pertaining to the assassination
of a dear friend. All right.

347
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,240
Now, your normal dispatch,
well, it's £500 cost,

348
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,960
but you're gonna have to add
another 100 to that

349
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,640
because Tommy Shelby, like me,
is from an oppressed people.

350
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,160
Then, I need you to put
another ton on top of that

351
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,080
because his brother is a fucking animal
and he will come after me.

352
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,280
Yeah. And then you'll need to put
another 100 on top of that

353
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,000
because, well,
you are a fucking wop, mate.

354
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,200
Hmm? And you.

355
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,960
And then... we have to deal
with the ugly business

356
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:07,200
of which I've been incredibly clear of,
before I'll need another £500

357
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:12,800
because like I stated, Tommy Shelby
is a very, very good friend of mine.

358
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,680
Total is down there in black and white.
All right? Crack on.

359
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,080
It's okay.

360
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,640
Mr. Solomons,
I'm gonna be very fucking clear with you.

361
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,760
I don't need you to kill anybody.

362
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,840
I have people that I trust, okay?
So you are gonna take my boys

363
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,840
and you are gonna bring them
to the ring as seconds.

364
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,080
Well, in order to qualify
as my seconds, right,

365
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,240
they would first have to qualify
as being Jewish. Yeah?

366
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,080
And in order to do that
they would have to replace

367
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,720
their natural Italian fucking arrogance

368
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,480
with a Jewish air of absolute certainty.

369
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,000
You see, my good friend, Tommy Shelby,
he will know the difference.

370
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,880
These days, back in the old country,

371
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,880
a lot of the...
You know, the Jewish people,

372
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:13,360
they... [chuckles] are having to pass
themselves off as Italian.

373
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,960
[laughing]

374
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,600
All right, well, you'll have to add
another ton onto your bill

375
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,840
for being a cunt, mate.

376
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,960
All right?

377
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
[snaps fingers]

378
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,480
You will bring my men to Birmingham?

379
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,480
You will circumcise them?

380
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,159
Yeah, you will have to circumcise them.

381
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,360
Because the peakys will check, yeah?

382
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,440
[speaking in Italian]

383
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,960
Motherfuckers.

384
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,120
Okay, any other requests?

385
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,760
Two hundred fucking barrels,
we have a deal.

386
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,560
Uh...

387
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,000
[exhales]

388
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,320
-What's the matter?
-Mmm. Well...

389
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,320
I said we have a deal.

390
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,440
Eh, you just made a deal
without a negotiation, didn't you?

391
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,320
Huh.

392
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,640
Yeah, Tommy Shelby
was right about you, wasn't he?

393
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,520
[speaking Italian]

394
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,120
You plan to kill us all.

395
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,000
[clicks tongue]

396
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,840
-[officer] Ada Shelby?
-No.

397
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,360
[keys jangling]

398
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,360
[door opens]

399
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,640
She was armed when we picked her up, sir.
So we strip searched her.

400
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,240
-That will be all.
-Yes, sir.

401
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,000
[Colonel Ben Younger]
I apologize, Miss Shelby.

402
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,400
-The territorials can be over-zealous.
-[door opens and shuts]

403
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,560
Your men watched.

404
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,080
And they will be reprimanded.

405
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,840
They won't see Saturday.

406
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:36,120
A naked woman alone making threats
against the entire British Army.

407
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,160
Significant indicator of character.

408
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,080
I'll turn my back while you dress
and perhaps we can talk.

409
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,880
I have a dossier
on each member of your family.

410
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,040
I know your family's
extraordinary history.

411
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,480
[chuckles] Fuck you.

412
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,280
And I also have a totally blank page

413
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,080
on which together we can write
your family's immediate future.

414
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,000
You rehearsed your speech.

415
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,080
Significant indicator
of a lack of confidence.

416
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,720
-What rank are you?
-Colonel.

417
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,520
-Well...
-May I turn?

418
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,520
Not unless you want to get blinded.

419
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,760
I'm sorry this has got off to a bad start.

420
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,040
What is this?

421
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,920
Three days ago, you were seen at a meeting
for the Stetford Communist Party.

422
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,960
You were then seen talking
to a woman called Jessie Eden.

423
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,240
Turn around.

424
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,720
I'm leaving.

425
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,360
And you can burn this.
It's history.

426
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,480
Ada Shelby,

427
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,800
a person of interest and under
the surveillance of the special branch

428
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,160
since you joined
the Birmingham Communist Party

429
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,920
in June 1919.

430
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,480
I'm no longer a member
of the Communist Party.

431
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,880
I know. Irrelevant.

432
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,680
Most of the more active subversives

433
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,120
shed their official allegiances
to avoid detection.

434
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,040
[scoffs] Look... okay.
Let me explain it to you.

435
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,680
I'm no longer a member
of the Communist Party

436
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,640
because I'm no longer a believer
in the cause of socialism.

437
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,080
Now, open that door.

438
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,200
[Colonel Ben Younger] So, in the past,
you were blinded by love?

439
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,840
No. Blinded by faith.

440
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,720
I believed people deserved justice.

441
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,440
They don't.

442
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:33,080
So, you've arrested me
because I had a drink with Jessie Eden?

443
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,360
Whiskey with ice for you
and a beer for her.

444
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,120
I met Jessie Eden
to settle an industrial dispute.

445
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,200
Head of acquisitions?

446
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,080
So, you swapped sides.

447
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,640
If you know what I drink,
you know what I do for a living.

448
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,880
Miss Shelby,

449
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,640
you must understand
that these are extraordinary times.

450
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,320
A general strike is certain.

451
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,200
Attempted revolution perhaps.

452
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,760
Soldiers on the streets very soon.
They are already drilling.

453
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,520
And here stands you.

454
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,320
A woman with her foot in both camps.

455
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,440
It's potentially very useful.

456
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,360
Useful to who?

457
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,920
Maybe you should ask your brother, Thomas.

458
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,680
[door opens]

459
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,240
[man] Put some fucking effort into it,
the fight's in two days.

460
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,840
Get used to the reach.

461
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,600
Get used to the long arm on him.

462
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,760
Get under it.

463
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,480
That's it, under his body, boy.

464
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,480
Talk to me about Colonel Ben Younger.

465
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,880
What about him?

466
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,280
He has just made me a proposition.

467
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,360
You're in my chair.

468
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,080
He said you knew about it.

469
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,120
[pours drink]

470
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,840
And remember
I know when you are lying.

471
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,560
Ben Younger was an officer
in the Warwickshire Yeomanry in Flanders.

472
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,080
The only Calvary man
who could ride a fucking horse.

473
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,040
I was strip searched.

474
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,880
Two soldiers watched.

475
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,840
I am sorry, Ada.

476
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,720
That...

477
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,920
The arrest was so the neighbors
would see and word would go around.

478
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,320
Younger is all right.

479
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,320
Younger came to me for help.

480
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,280
[groans]

481
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,840
He has been given Birmingham.

482
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,120
Given Birmingham. By who?

483
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,200
By Churchill.
By the fucking King.

484
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,280
By people who want to stop a revolution.

485
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,240
[scoffs]

486
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,600
No one is laughing anymore, Ada.

487
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,000
The home office is making provisions.

488
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,760
This is part of those provisions.

489
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:38,200
And how is Tommy Shelby, OBE,
going to stop a revolution?

490
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,000
Jessie Eden has accepted
my invitation to dinner.

491
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,040
[scoffs]

492
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,400
Of course. I'm sorry.

493
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,880
Tommy Shelby is gonna stop
the revolution with his cock.

494
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
It's not her the military
are interested in,

495
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,280
it's the people around her.

496
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,280
The people like you used to be,
like Freddy used to be.

497
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,720
People who want an armed revolution. If I get Jessie Eden's trust,

498
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,280
she gives me the names of the instigators,

499
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,280
I give them up to the crown forces.

500
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,440
Tommy. Tommy, sweetheart.

501
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,000
Why would a man whose medals rust
at the bottom of the Saltley canal

502
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,840
want to help the British military?

503
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,760
[sighs]

504
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:30,160
Because I have been offered
three five-year contracts

505
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,600
to supply military vehicles
to the British forces in India,

506
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,120
Ceylon, Singapore and Burma.
Total value £2 million.

507
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,800
Wouldn't be no strikes in your factory
'cause Jessie Eden would be in your bed.

508
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,480
Tommy, this can only happen
if you are still alive.

509
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,080
Planning on staying alive.

510
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,000
If I'm dead you can all go back
to being what you were.

511
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,960
The British army came to me, Ada.

512
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,400
I said, why not.

513
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,160
I'll put that on your grave, Tom.

514
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,320
Tommy Shelby, "Why not."

515
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,800
[sighs]

516
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,360
Are you gonna help me or not?

517
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,360
[door shuts]

518
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,160
[clattering]

519
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,680
Other way around.

520
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,960
And... will they want music, Charlie?

521
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,720
We have that gramophone we found
abandoned inside that gentleman's car.

522
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,840
No, they don't.
Tommy said they are here to talk.

523
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,000
[door creaks open]

524
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,640
Charlie, Curly, this is Jessie Eden.

525
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:26,680
Jessie, this is my uncle, Charlie
and my whatever Curly is.

526
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,000
This is actually lovely.

527
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,400
We were just wondering
if you'd like some music?

528
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,000
-No, we weren't.
-Actually, Jessie likes music.

529
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,600
-Don't go to any trouble.
-No, Curly, go to some trouble.

530
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,720
Go on, then.

531
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,240
Right.

532
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,160
[clears throat]

533
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,000
Don't I get a choice?

534
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,800
I want an opinion. Try it.

535
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,120
I don't really drink gin.

536
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,680
Then you're perfect.

537
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,240
My gin is for women
that don't really drink gin.

538
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,520
Your gin?

539
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,920
Let's drink to something.
You choose.

540
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,000
To the revolution.

541
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,920
Why not?

542
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,560
-To the revolution.
-To the revolution.

543
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,360
Right, well, since I have invited you
for dinner I thought I'd cook.

544
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,720
These two beauties were shot this morning

545
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,640
by a poacher friend of mine
on Lord Packwood's estate.

546
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,560
I thought you would like that.

547
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,800
These here...
these were stolen from under his trees.

548
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,480
Mr. Shelby, I came to talk business.

549
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,680
Yes.

550
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,760
So did I.

551
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,880
Wage cuts withdrawn.

552
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,520
Parity between men
and women guaranteed. You can instruct your members
to return to work tomorrow.

553
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,480
And all I have to do in return is tell you
everything I know about socialism?

554
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,720
That's what your sister said.

555
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,000
You don't like your gin?

556
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,000
It's okay.

557
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,040
It's okay.

558
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,880
What do you want to know about the cause?

559
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,240
I'm approaching
the current political crisis

560
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,280
as I would approach a horse race.

561
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,720
Assessing the runners and the riders.

562
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,640
Now, the favorite
is of course the King's horse.

563
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,640
But the King's horse
was also the favorite in 1913,

564
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,600
when Emily Davison
threw herself in front of it.

565
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,320
You know the names of the suffragettes?

566
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,960
I'm impressed.

567
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,600
Oh, everyone laughed at them at first,
but now look.

568
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,800
Women with serious faces everywhere.

569
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,480
When I study a horse race,
I study form...

570
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,320
and the other horse, the one
that wants to beat the King's horse.

571
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,760
Let's call her Dangerous, shall we?

572
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,280
She's has no form.

573
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,480
That's what makes her so dangerous.

574
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,320
Russia. Isn't that form?

575
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,760
No. The Russians aren't like
the English with beer.

576
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,120
They're petrol.

577
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,360
That's why I invited you here for dinner.

578
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,960
I'm guessing you know the people,

579
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,280
people that want to make this fight real.

580
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,600
With guns and ammunition.

581
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,680
So before I place a bet
on who is gonna win,

582
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,200
I need to know how strong they are.

583
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,240
How serious they are.

584
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,160
Your concern
is that if the unthinkable happened,

585
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,360
you would find yourself
on the wrong side of the barricades.

586
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,000
Well, as you can see...

587
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,600
my natural side of the barricades
is the same as yours and as you know...

588
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,160
I once believed.

589
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,880
But the war changed you?

590
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,600
Yeah.

591
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:45,560
The man I loved couldn't speak
when he got back. Not one word.

592
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,200
I've said very few true words since.

593
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,440
The men who blew the whistles
in France are our enemy.

594
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,360
And you count yourself
among those who want a real fight?

595
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,080
I do.

596
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,600
-Well, well.
-Yes.

597
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,360
Not just in my dreams, in the day now.

598
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,640
And you're not alone.

599
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,840
I'm not alone.

600
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,680
Well, well.

601
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,840
I researched you.

602
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,200
We have researched you.

603
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,320
You've never been
a friend to the government.

604
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,040
They've used you.

605
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,400
And I imagine you have found out already

606
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,360
that no amount of money allows you
to pass through the steel sheets

607
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,320
-that separate class from class?
-[scoffs]

608
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:44,560
Yes. Yes, that I have learnt.

609
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,840
A man like you would terrify them.

610
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,000
Better than them at what they do.

611
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,400
[chuckles]

612
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,240
Would I change the odds, do you think?

613
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,760
[footsteps approach]

614
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,960
[Curly] It's all wound up, Tom.

615
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,600
Uh, just put the needle on
and let her spin,

616
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,000
and there are some
popular records, mostly romantic.

617
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,160
Uh...

618
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,600
Thank you, Curly.

619
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,920
Dinner's nearly ready.

620
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,040
Let's speak before we dance, shall we?

621
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,360
So we are going to dance?

622
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,760
I think so.

623
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,320
[record snaps in]

624
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,400

[Jessie chuckles]

627
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,920
[Tommy] I swear to God.

628
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,320
She gave me sixpence.

629
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:50,240
She sends me to the shop
for margarine, eggs and bread.

630
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,400
When I came back...

631
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,200
...with a top hat and a coconut.

632
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,880
...and that was all the money we had
for the whole fucking week.

633
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,640
And me mum beat me
with a fucking frying pan.

634
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,360
Why the hell did you buy
a top hat and a coconut?

635
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,880
'Cause I thought she deserved it.

636
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,600
I thought we all did.

637
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,640
And I could never understand...

638
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,680
why people like us
only had bread and fucking lard.

639
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,360
And I wanted to be different.

640
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,400
That's what I wanted.

641
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,440
And you are?

642
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,560
No.

643
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,440
When I showed you that photo
of Greta Durruti, your face changed.

644
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,800
She wanted everything to be different.

645
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,040
Her whole world.

646
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:43,840
As do I.

647
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,400
Shall we hear some more music?

648
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,640
[clears throat]

[gramophone clicking]

650
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,360
You were married but she was killed?

651
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,800
"Bye, bye Blackbird"
reminds you of your sweetheart, eh?

652
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,000
I guess.

653
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,240
You want it fast or slow?

654
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,960
Absolutely slow.
Would you just sit, I'm drunk.

655
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,640
[record crackling]

656
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,520
Come on.

[music playing]

658
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,600
Will you help us, Tommy?

659
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,200
Soon. Soon.

660
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:40,040
Arrange a meeting
with the appropriate people

661
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,160
and I will be there.

662

[laughs]

667
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,400
The room is clean, Mr. Shelby.

668
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,040
Right. Lock it all down.

669
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,120
All right, boys, lock it down.

670
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,200

Arthur! Can I open the book?

673
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,560
All right. Open it up! You.

674
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,600
Gentlemen.

675
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,240
You put all your money... You hear me?

676
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,880
It's fucking fun-day. Clear the way.

Bring out that fucking tiger, eh. Go on.

00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,000
Tiger is already out.

684
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,760
Fair enough.
