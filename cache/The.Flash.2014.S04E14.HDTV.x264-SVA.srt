1
00:00:00,046 --> 00:00:01,418
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,421 --> 00:00:04,006
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:05,088
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,091 --> 00:00:07,044
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,046 --> 00:00:08,479
But secretly, with the help

6
00:00:08,481 --> 00:00:10,114
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

7
00:00:10,116 --> 00:00:12,082
I fight crime and find other meta-humans

8
00:00:12,084 --> 00:00:13,183
like me.

9
00:00:13,185 --> 00:00:14,952
But I became lost in time.

10
00:00:14,954 --> 00:00:16,854
It took everything in my friends' power

11
00:00:16,856 --> 00:00:18,786
to bring me back, and in doing so

12
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:21,058
our world was opened up to new threats.

13
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,894
And I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.

14
00:00:23,896 --> 00:00:26,671
I am the Flash.

15
00:00:27,418 --> 00:00:28,817
Previously on "The Flash."

16
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,100
12 markers, 12 metas.

17
00:00:30,102 --> 00:00:31,918
Your body's deteriorating faster

18
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:33,170
than the chair can handle.

19
00:00:33,172 --> 00:00:34,629
I didn't just take Dominic's body.

20
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:35,546
I took his ability.

21
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:37,540
Sylbert Rundine can shrink
objects and return them

22
00:00:37,543 --> 00:00:38,770
to original size.

23
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:40,377
Deacon controls technology.

24
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,412
Becky Sharpe can manipulate luck.

25
00:00:42,414 --> 00:00:44,661
There's nothing keeping him
from going in the meta wing

26
00:00:44,664 --> 00:00:46,031
and absorbing the powers.

27
00:00:46,034 --> 00:00:48,442
You should be able to change
into anyone you can think of.

28
00:00:48,445 --> 00:00:49,319
How's this?

29
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:51,510
- I believe you are looking for me.
- It's Ralph.

30
00:00:51,513 --> 00:00:53,715
Barry Allen is hereby
released immediately.

31
00:00:53,718 --> 00:00:54,879
He only wants the bus metas.

32
00:00:54,882 --> 00:00:55,931
He wants their powers.

33
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:58,328
Why is everyone looking
at me like I'm a dead man?

34
00:01:16,248 --> 00:01:19,116
Addie, hey, what's going on?

35
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:20,584
I think you should talk to Kat.

36
00:01:20,586 --> 00:01:21,652
About what?

37
00:01:21,654 --> 00:01:24,354
Just go see him, Allen.

38
00:01:24,356 --> 00:01:26,990
Okay.

39
00:01:26,992 --> 00:01:30,427
Tolerate the behavior that
the previous administration...

40
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:31,812
Addie said you wanted to see me.

41
00:01:31,815 --> 00:01:33,096
Yeah, shut the door.

42
00:01:33,098 --> 00:01:35,581
I promise you we will
root out all corruption

43
00:01:35,584 --> 00:01:39,937
at all levels and restore
your faith in public servants.

44
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:42,940
The name Van Buren is
a name that has always

45
00:01:42,942 --> 00:01:44,308
stood for integrity.

46
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,831
I may be the Mayor...

47
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:48,296
We've got a problem that
I'm not sure how to fix.

48
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:49,276
All right.

49
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:52,082
Some people don't think you
should be back on the force.

50
00:01:52,084 --> 00:01:53,817
- Because of DeVoe?
- Mm-hmm.

51
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:55,419
I was cleared of all charges.

52
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:56,420
I didn't do anything.

53
00:01:56,422 --> 00:01:57,643
He's alive.

54
00:01:57,646 --> 00:01:59,223
I know, and he's been cooperating,

55
00:01:59,225 --> 00:02:00,724
coming in, answering questions.

56
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:02,059
So what's the problem?

57
00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:04,094
Look...

58
00:02:04,096 --> 00:02:06,897
People nowadays will believe anything.

59
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,789
Fake news, social media.

60
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:11,435
Allegations are treated as facts.

61
00:02:11,437 --> 00:02:14,004
But DeVoe being alive?

62
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:16,673
Showing up in the courtroom
at your appeal hearing?

63
00:02:16,675 --> 00:02:19,343
Some people in Central City
don't buy it's actually him.

64
00:02:19,345 --> 00:02:20,992
Well, who do they think it was?

65
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:21,831
Who the hell knows?

66
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:23,646
But we live in a city
full of meta-humans.

67
00:02:23,649 --> 00:02:26,149
It's a conspiracy theorist's dream.

68
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:27,184
So, what does this mean?

69
00:02:27,186 --> 00:02:29,319
Are you... you firing me?

70
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:31,622
Not firing.

71
00:02:31,624 --> 00:02:33,624
But I have been asked
to request that you take

72
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:35,626
a leave of absence.

73
00:02:36,929 --> 00:02:37,968
By whom?

74
00:02:42,534 --> 00:02:44,434
Thinks it'll be easier for everyone.

75
00:02:44,436 --> 00:02:46,169
Restoring the faith and all that.

76
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:47,404
For how long?

77
00:02:47,406 --> 00:02:49,273
Indefinitely.

78
00:02:49,275 --> 00:02:51,346
Look, Barry,

79
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:52,776
if you want me to fight this thing,

80
00:02:52,778 --> 00:02:53,963
I'll do what I can.

81
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,679
But this new Mayor,
she's got a lot to prove

82
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:57,948
since the Bellows debacle.

83
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,183
When do you think I can come back?

84
00:03:00,185 --> 00:03:02,984
When everyone believes DeVoe
is really alive and well.

85
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,815
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

86
00:03:11,096 --> 00:03:12,863
It's not permanent, is it?

87
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:14,431
I mean, he said it was indefinite.

88
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:16,062
They wouldn't have
given you your ID back

89
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:17,134
if it was for good.

90
00:03:17,136 --> 00:03:18,902
I mean, maybe this is
for the best, Barry.

91
00:03:18,904 --> 00:03:20,971
I mean, you need to prove
that DeVoe is still alive.

92
00:03:20,973 --> 00:03:22,789
And you can do that now as The Flash.

93
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:23,874
Yeah, maybe.

94
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:25,709
How are we doing with him, by the way?

95
00:03:25,711 --> 00:03:28,412
We know that we still have
four bus metas left to find.

96
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:30,747
And that DeVoe has absorbed
the powers of Killgore,

97
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:33,546
Hazard, Black Bison,
Brainstorm, and Dwarfstar.

98
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:34,851
Fallout is safe with Tracy.

99
00:03:34,853 --> 00:03:36,987
But the Weeper is M.I.A.

100
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:38,121
Then DeVoe must have him.

101
00:03:38,123 --> 00:03:39,456
Well, that just leaves Ralph.

102
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,054
Ralph is safe with us.

103
00:03:41,057 --> 00:03:42,626
But the other four metas aren't.

104
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:45,095
DeVoe will absolutely kill
them and take their powers.

105
00:03:45,097 --> 00:03:46,496
But why does he need their powers?

106
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:47,976
I can't figure out his end game.

107
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:48,948
I don't know.

108
00:03:48,951 --> 00:03:50,787
I just know that these
last four metas are the key.

109
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:51,883
That's why we need to find them.

110
00:03:51,885 --> 00:03:53,568
And find them we will.

111
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:54,770
Where have you guys been?

112
00:03:54,772 --> 00:03:56,071
A little home away from home,

113
00:03:56,073 --> 00:03:57,606
otherwise known as the bus depot.

114
00:03:57,608 --> 00:04:00,309
But I showed Cisco
here an old P.I. trick

115
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:02,845
I learned from my mentor, Columbo.

116
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:05,414
Lost and found box from meta bus 405.

117
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:08,083
Question for the room,
how did I get stuck

118
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:09,785
doing the buddy system thing with Ralph?

119
00:04:09,787 --> 00:04:12,688
It's the best way to
keep Ralph safe, Cisco.

120
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,390
Yeah, it's the best way
to keep Ralph safe, Cisco.

121
00:04:15,392 --> 00:04:17,392
Well, clearly you've
never had to stay over

122
00:04:17,394 --> 00:04:20,395
at an apartment that uses
neon beer signs for lamps

123
00:04:20,397 --> 00:04:22,097
and the kitchen sink for a shower.

124
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:23,331
Ralph, I love you.

125
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:24,533
But you sleep on a futon.

126
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:25,834
Futon's not that bad.

127
00:04:25,836 --> 00:04:27,002
It is when it's damp.

128
00:04:27,004 --> 00:04:28,203
Why is it damp?

129
00:04:28,205 --> 00:04:29,972
I sweat a lot when I sleep.

130
00:04:29,974 --> 00:04:31,273
You nasty.

131
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:35,693
Oh, hey, my retainer.

132
00:04:35,696 --> 00:04:36,695
Been looking for this.

133
00:04:36,698 --> 00:04:39,648
Retainer.

134
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,949
Okay, you made your point.

135
00:04:40,951 --> 00:04:42,518
Not that the point needed to be made.

136
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,852
I'll take the next shift.

137
00:04:43,854 --> 00:04:45,187
You're a good man, Barry Allen.

138
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,432
Really? Who uses CDs anymore?

139
00:04:48,435 --> 00:04:50,592
A musician trying to catch their break.

140
00:04:52,796 --> 00:04:53,896
Izzy Bowen.

141
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:00,158
Ugh, country.

142
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:01,669
Music's tone deaf stepchild.

143
00:05:01,672 --> 00:05:02,922
All right, remember anyone on the bus

144
00:05:02,924 --> 00:05:03,929
with a fiddle?

145
00:05:03,932 --> 00:05:05,973
There was a guy with a cowboy hat on

146
00:05:05,976 --> 00:05:07,543
sitting behind me. Maybe it was him.

147
00:05:07,545 --> 00:05:09,678
Boy, I sure wish we had
a way of finding out.

148
00:05:13,651 --> 00:05:15,717
Izzy Bowen.

149
00:05:27,631 --> 00:05:30,165
Izzy, you wanna give
us one more mic check?

150
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:32,367
Check one, check, check, one two.

151
00:05:35,372 --> 00:05:37,839
Okay, well, it's a her, not a him.

152
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:40,142
And she's playing a gig
at the Busted Saddle.

153
00:05:40,144 --> 00:05:42,177
All right. Ralph, let's go.

154
00:05:42,179 --> 00:05:44,507
No, no way. I hate country music.

155
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,515
Well, buddy system. It's my turn.

156
00:05:46,517 --> 00:05:48,517

00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:22,618
She's good.

166
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,922
She's improving, but
she lacks refinement.

167
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:31,059
So you're not impressed by her at all?

168
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:34,229
The resting face of my current visage

169
00:06:34,231 --> 00:06:38,567
may be more pleasant than
the one I used to display.

170
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:43,005
But I assure you, this
is not the look of a man

171
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:45,707
awed by symphonic greatness.

172
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:47,676
Clifford! Clifford!

173
00:06:49,613 --> 00:06:54,950
This body, it's deteriorating rapidly.

174
00:06:54,952 --> 00:06:56,752
The additional dark
matter in your system

175
00:06:56,754 --> 00:06:59,321
from each of your new powers
is wearing down your host.

176
00:06:59,323 --> 00:07:02,491
It's straining too much
of this body's new energy.

177
00:07:02,493 --> 00:07:06,228
Then I must move into the next one.

178
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,896
But you said that Izzy
Bowen wasn't ready,

179
00:07:07,898 --> 00:07:09,431
that we needed to find another.

180
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:12,067
We don't have time.

181
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:14,536
We must act now.

182
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,581
We may be too late.

183
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:27,639
Izzy Bowen?

184
00:07:27,642 --> 00:07:28,741
That's me.

185
00:07:28,744 --> 00:07:30,024
My name is Barry Allen.

186
00:07:30,027 --> 00:07:31,199
I'm with CCP...

187
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:35,804
Is that a label?

188
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:38,673
- Um...
- Maybe on another Earth.

189
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:40,442
Okay, well, you want an autograph

190
00:07:40,444 --> 00:07:42,944
or a phone number, something?

191
00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:45,480
Uh, no, no. Nothing like that.

192
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:46,591
Okay.

193
00:07:46,594 --> 00:07:48,606
Well, if it ain't business
and it ain't pleasure,

194
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:50,242
then we got nothing left to talk about,

195
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:51,786
now do we?

196
00:07:51,788 --> 00:07:53,188
Oh.

197
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,989
Do it again next week.

198
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:56,024
Great work.

199
00:07:57,323 --> 00:07:59,804
Okay, I'm sorry. Let me explain.

200
00:07:59,807 --> 00:08:00,795
Um...

201
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:05,812
Uh...

202
00:08:05,815 --> 00:08:11,138
Someone very smart and very dangerous

203
00:08:11,141 --> 00:08:12,440
is coming after you.

204
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:14,757
Me?

205
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,844
Yep.

206
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:20,648
Okay, now, why in the name of God

207
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,284
would anybody dangerous
be coming after me?

208
00:08:23,286 --> 00:08:25,038
Because you have powers.

209
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,307
Four months ago,

210
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,911
you were on Central City bus 405.

211
00:08:28,914 --> 00:08:30,792
That bus got showered with dark matter

212
00:08:30,794 --> 00:08:32,927
and made everyone on it a meta-human.

213
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,596
Now the person
responsible for doing that

214
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:37,766
wants those powers for themself.

215
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,701
Okay, and let me guess.

216
00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:42,570
You boys are here to protect me.

217
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:43,905
Something like that.

218
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:46,341
Look, we can explain more later,

219
00:08:46,343 --> 00:08:48,004
but now we just need
you to come with us.

220
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:49,811
Oh, no, that's not necessary.

221
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:53,695
My daddy bailed. Mama
bailed not long after.

222
00:08:53,698 --> 00:08:56,714
And I have been looking out
for myself my entire life.

223
00:08:56,717 --> 00:08:58,484
This time it's different.

224
00:08:58,487 --> 00:08:59,707
You can't. Please.

225
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,692
We need to go.

226
00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:02,424
I ain't going anywhere
with either of you.

227
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:03,892
I think you should reconsider that.

228
00:09:03,894 --> 00:09:06,361
I don't give a damn what you think.

229
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:19,293
I guess now we know what her power is.

230
00:09:19,296 --> 00:09:21,930
- What?
- What?

231
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:24,212
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

232
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:29,350
You two are lucky.

233
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:30,686
Barry, your ear is almost healed,

234
00:09:30,689 --> 00:09:32,719
and Dibny, yours just stretched.

235
00:09:32,722 --> 00:09:34,722
Well, I still can't hear all that great.

236
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:36,257
Consider that a blessing in disguise.

237
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:37,659
Less twang in your future.

238
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,527
Give it an hour. You'll be fine.

239
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:41,763
So Izzy Bowen can control music.

240
00:09:41,765 --> 00:09:43,064
More like sound waves.

241
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,811
Soundwave. That's a great name.

242
00:09:44,814 --> 00:09:48,369
It would be, if it wasn't
already taken by a Transformer.

243
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:50,872
Okay, well, it looks like
billions of tiny shrapnel

244
00:09:50,874 --> 00:09:52,383
- ripped through this.
- Exactly.

245
00:09:52,386 --> 00:09:56,009
Sound is just the force of
billions of tiny gas molecules

246
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,499
colliding into one another.

247
00:09:57,502 --> 00:09:59,714
So if you can harness and
amplify kinetic energy,

248
00:09:59,716 --> 00:10:01,194
- you get...
- Molecular shrapnel.

249
00:10:01,197 --> 00:10:02,717
Okay, well, we gotta keep searching.

250
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:03,896
If we can't track her down soon,

251
00:10:03,898 --> 00:10:06,163
she's gonna fall right
into DeVoe's hands.

252
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,822
Speaking of tracking people down,

253
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:09,724
when's Harry getting
back from Earth Two?

254
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:16,238
DA Cecille Horton.

255
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,465
Harry, hey.

256
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:18,739
When did you get back from the Earth?

257
00:10:18,741 --> 00:10:19,624
Just got back.

258
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:20,882
Getting myself a little pick me up.

259
00:10:20,884 --> 00:10:22,403
You and me both, kid.

260
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,672
- Okay, good talk.
- Yeah.

261
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,655
Actually, you know, I
don't think that, uh,

262
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:29,844
pregnant people are
supposed to consume caffeine.

263
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:33,047
Uh, yeah, doctor says
one cup a day is fine.

264
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,950
And lord knows I need it.

265
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:38,386
I need it more than you
could possibly imagine.

266
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,920
Apparently. Must be exhausting.

267
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:41,856
It is. He's keeping me up all night.

268
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:43,525
"He"? I thought Alan said

269
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:44,811
you were having a girl.

270
00:10:44,814 --> 00:10:46,129
Yeah, and I'm not
talking about the baby.

271
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:47,161
I'm talking about Joe.

272
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:48,796
Joe is keeping me up.

273
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:52,233
No, Harry, come here.

274
00:10:55,228 --> 00:10:58,439
My newfound ability to
hear people's thoughts.

275
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:00,875
- Oh, see, I thought...
- Yeah, I can hear...

276
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:04,279
Joe, his thoughts... I can
hear them while he's asleep.

277
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:06,347
- All night long.
- You hear his dreams.

278
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:09,038
Yep. And they are crazy and fast.

279
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,967
And oh so very loud.

280
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,722
It is like living in the middle
of an action movie, Harry.

281
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:16,424
I love Joe West with all my heart,

282
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,493
but I am telling you,
I just... I can't...

283
00:11:18,495 --> 00:11:20,460
I'm so tired.

284
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:22,163
I can't take it anymore.

285
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:24,332
Yeah, well, that sucks,
DA Cecille Horton.

286
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:26,092
- Yes, it does.
- Okay.

287
00:11:26,095 --> 00:11:29,413
Actually, I might be
able to build something

288
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,638
that can help you with that.

289
00:11:31,641 --> 00:11:33,241
Oh, Harry, thank you.

290
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:37,822
Satellite's been running all day,

291
00:11:37,825 --> 00:11:41,827
but it's still not picking up
any irregular sound variances.

292
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,650
I checked the city. I can't find her.

293
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:45,538
- Babe, you checked the whole city?
- Yeah.

294
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,454
Look, we have to find her before DeVoe.

295
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:48,564
Her life's on the line.

296
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:49,866
She had another gig this week.

297
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:51,192
I doubt she'd skip town.

298
00:11:51,194 --> 00:11:53,761
How would Dibny P.I.
suggest we find her?

299
00:11:53,763 --> 00:11:55,863
Well, since you asked,

300
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:57,665
has anyone checked her web site?

301
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:00,201
"Has anyone checked her web site?"

302
00:12:00,203 --> 00:12:02,236
Dibs, of course we've
checked her web site.

303
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:07,342
No one has checked her web site?

304
00:12:07,344 --> 00:12:08,910
- Iris!
- Yeah, I'm-I'm on it.

305
00:12:08,912 --> 00:12:10,912
I'm looking now. Um...

306
00:12:12,616 --> 00:12:13,775
Guys, she's still in town.

307
00:12:13,778 --> 00:12:15,683
"I just picked up the
first run of my next single

308
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:17,752
and love the geniuses at Saloon Sounds."

309
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:20,021
All right, Ralph. Take two.

310
00:12:20,023 --> 00:12:21,623
Cisco, we might need Vibe's help.

311
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,091
Giddy up.

312
00:12:23,093 --> 00:12:25,927
Come on, let's go. We're in a hurry.

313
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:30,098
Izzy Bowen, we need you to come with us.

314
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,034
- Flash?
- You're in danger.

315
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:34,802
I know, everybody keeps telling me that.

316
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:36,627
And you're gonna keep
hearing it until it sinks in.

317
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:38,051
You just have to trust us.

318
00:12:38,054 --> 00:12:40,041
We're not gonna hurt you,
but we know someone who will.

319
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:41,643
Who is going to hurt me?

320
00:12:41,645 --> 00:12:42,844
I am.

321
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,351
Y'all came to warn me about her?

322
00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:53,287
DeVoe.

323
00:12:55,392 --> 00:12:57,692
Hello, Flash.

324
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,957
You're gonna leave Izzy alone.

325
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,097
You know, you really don't
learn from our past encounters,

326
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:04,999
do you?

327
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:09,137
You're not smart enough to stop
me from getting what I want.

328
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:12,181
And what I want now is her.

329
00:13:14,046 --> 00:13:16,246
That's not gonna happen.

330
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:18,246
It's three against one, genius.

331
00:13:18,248 --> 00:13:20,481
Check your math, Vibe.

332
00:13:20,483 --> 00:13:23,384
It's three against six.

333
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:27,889
Though I doubt I'll need to use
all of my powers against you.

334
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:45,305
You stay away from me!

335
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
You just hurt DeVoe.

336
00:13:58,722 --> 00:14:00,631
Who the hell's DeVoe?

337
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:09,916
So you're telling me that
this three foot tall chick

338
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:15,149
that tried to kill me is
actually this Clifford DeVoe?

339
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:17,258
Oh, yeah. 100% dude.

340
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,024
Mmm-hmm.

341
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:20,070
DeVoe is transferring his consciousness

342
00:14:20,073 --> 00:14:22,028
to the other bodies
of all the other people

343
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:24,212
who were on the bus and
got their powers with you.

344
00:14:24,215 --> 00:14:26,868
Wait, this... this
little girl wants my body?

345
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,803
That's why we're trying to protect you.

346
00:14:28,805 --> 00:14:31,405
DeVoe's already taken
most of his targets.

347
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,377
No, this ain't happening. Not now.

348
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:38,279
I only got my powers recently.

349
00:14:38,281 --> 00:14:40,581
And now it's like I've
got a deeper connection

350
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,618
to my music than I've ever had.

351
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,720
I'm about to record the
rest of my new album.

352
00:14:45,722 --> 00:14:47,555
- I'm about to go on tour...
- Izzy, your album can wait.

353
00:14:47,557 --> 00:14:48,618
This threat is real.

354
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,559
So is my big break.

355
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:55,363
Do you have any idea how hard
I've had to work for this?

356
00:14:55,365 --> 00:14:56,697
I left my home.

357
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:59,000
I lost friends and good men,

358
00:14:59,002 --> 00:15:02,870
and I have put up with more
crap than you could imagine

359
00:15:02,872 --> 00:15:05,573
so that one day I would get my dream.

360
00:15:05,575 --> 00:15:08,609
And now you're telling me
that some pint-sized lunatic

361
00:15:08,611 --> 00:15:10,745
is just gonna take it all away?

362
00:15:10,747 --> 00:15:12,880
Which is exactly why
we want you to stay here

363
00:15:12,882 --> 00:15:14,548
- at S.T.A.R. Labs.
- Why?

364
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,548
Are y'all gonna protect me or something?

365
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:20,691
We're gonna train you.

366
00:15:20,694 --> 00:15:22,223
We are?

367
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:24,492
Guys, her powers weakened DeVoe.

368
00:15:24,494 --> 00:15:26,694
Izzy, that makes you our
best shot at stopping him.

369
00:15:26,696 --> 00:15:29,096
No, no, this... This is all too much.

370
00:15:29,098 --> 00:15:30,598
I don't even know who you people are.

371
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,000
We don't have time for this.

372
00:15:33,002 --> 00:15:34,402
Flash!

373
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,739
You're that guy from before.

374
00:15:38,741 --> 00:15:40,274
Yeah, Barry Allen.

375
00:15:40,276 --> 00:15:42,476
And so are you, aren't you?

376
00:15:42,478 --> 00:15:45,246
Yeah. Ralph.

377
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:46,614
Ralph Dibny.

378
00:15:46,616 --> 00:15:48,983
I'm, uh, Cisco. Cisco Ramon.

379
00:15:48,985 --> 00:15:50,451
- It's nice to meet you.
- Okay, thank you.

380
00:15:50,453 --> 00:15:53,120
Look, look, I... I don't need training.

381
00:15:53,122 --> 00:15:54,735
Especially from you.

382
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:57,517
All I need is my life back.

383
00:15:58,995 --> 00:16:00,895
I don't know, guys.

384
00:16:00,897 --> 00:16:03,130
I kinda feel like if I just
followed her into that hallway

385
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:04,899
and just gave her one
of those "Hey, look,"

386
00:16:04,901 --> 00:16:06,470
inspirational talks, I could probably

387
00:16:06,473 --> 00:16:07,435
get her to stay.

388
00:16:07,438 --> 00:16:09,142
Then what are you still doing here?

389
00:16:09,145 --> 00:16:10,371
Sorry, I don't know if you, like,

390
00:16:10,373 --> 00:16:11,605
drew straws for this stuff or something.

391
00:16:11,607 --> 00:16:13,641
- No, go!
- Okay.

392
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:21,254
I'd watch out if I were you.

393
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:23,917
Sometimes killer robots
come out of there.

394
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,340
Keep walking, Stretch.

395
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,153
I don't talk to creeps in dark hallways

396
00:16:27,156 --> 00:16:29,156
dressed in purple leather.

397
00:16:29,158 --> 00:16:31,993
It's actually, uh, more of a mauve.

398
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:34,695
And, uh, I'm not a creep.

399
00:16:34,697 --> 00:16:37,565
Look, Izzy, I know how you're feeling.

400
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:39,259
That day that you got your powers,

401
00:16:39,262 --> 00:16:40,701
I was on the same bus.

402
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:45,740
So that evil chipmunk,
she wants to kill me, too.

403
00:16:45,742 --> 00:16:47,241
Please.

404
00:16:47,243 --> 00:16:50,511
I think I'd remember
seeing you on my bus.

405
00:16:50,513 --> 00:16:55,516
Actually I was kind of,
uh, big boned back then.

406
00:16:55,518 --> 00:16:58,352
I was on a strict diet of
gin, donuts, and regret.

407
00:16:58,354 --> 00:17:00,087
But I got another shot at it.

408
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:01,689
And I worked my tight butt off.

409
00:17:01,691 --> 00:17:04,325
And now I'm the hottest
superhero in town.

410
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:05,893
Please.

411
00:17:05,895 --> 00:17:08,229
My life, it's never been better.

412
00:17:08,231 --> 00:17:09,830
Kinda like yours.

413
00:17:09,832 --> 00:17:11,866
Yeah, but aren't you
afraid of losing it all?

414
00:17:11,868 --> 00:17:14,335
Yeah, I am.

415
00:17:14,337 --> 00:17:16,737
Which is why I'm a part of this team.

416
00:17:16,739 --> 00:17:18,773
You said that your family bailed on you,

417
00:17:18,775 --> 00:17:21,075
so I can understand why
you wouldn't trust someone

418
00:17:21,077 --> 00:17:22,843
to look out for you, but, Izzy,

419
00:17:22,845 --> 00:17:26,981
I can tell you firsthand
that these amazing weirdoes,

420
00:17:26,983 --> 00:17:29,383
they won't bail.

421
00:17:29,385 --> 00:17:32,453
They created a buddy system for me.

422
00:17:32,455 --> 00:17:37,591
And if you'll stay,
they'll keep you safe.

423
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:40,595
I promise.

424
00:17:47,737 --> 00:17:51,772
So? Who's gonna be my buddy, then?

425
00:17:53,876 --> 00:17:55,443
I may have to pull some strings,

426
00:17:55,445 --> 00:17:58,012
but I will see if I am available.

427
00:18:03,486 --> 00:18:05,119
Subject nine's sonic powers

428
00:18:05,121 --> 00:18:07,822
accelerated the deterioration
of your internal organs.

429
00:18:07,824 --> 00:18:10,509
She merely disrupted my atrial flutter

430
00:18:10,512 --> 00:18:11,792
and bradycardia.

431
00:18:11,794 --> 00:18:14,149
This body is nearly drained anyway.

432
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:17,364
Its palliation is a waste of time.

433
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:20,534
I need these biometric scans
to fully assess your ailments.

434
00:18:20,536 --> 00:18:23,604
Then you should have
built this to work faster.

435
00:18:26,275 --> 00:18:27,808
I'm doing all I can.

436
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:32,046
Yet you achieved precisely the opposite.

437
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,684
I couldn't idly stand by
and watch you be injured.

438
00:18:36,686 --> 00:18:38,071
Your plan was failing.

439
00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:42,456
Is it possible that the
repeated transference

440
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,235
has affected your cognitive functioning?

441
00:18:47,463 --> 00:18:52,500
There is nothing wrong with my mind.

442
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,367
Next time I will keep a level head.

443
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,690
Izzy, this will help focus your powers.

444
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,688
Well, this ain't much help in a fight,

445
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,424
unless you're dueling the devil.

446
00:19:17,426 --> 00:19:19,527
Don't think of it like a weapon.

447
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:22,763
Just do what you've
always been dreaming to do.

448
00:19:22,765 --> 00:19:24,331
Make your own sound.

449
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:35,160
Are you my new target, Stretch?

450
00:19:35,163 --> 00:19:37,144
Yeah, 'cause I don't break so easy.

451
00:19:37,146 --> 00:19:39,180
Please.

452
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:40,581
You're built like a twig.

453
00:20:16,052 --> 00:20:17,618
DA Cecille Horton.

454
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,953
You look tired.

455
00:20:18,955 --> 00:20:21,388
Yeah, that's 'cause I am tired.

456
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,257
This thing, it doesn't work.

457
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:25,192
It works because I built it.

458
00:20:25,194 --> 00:20:26,994
And this thing, as you
so ineloquently put it,

459
00:20:26,996 --> 00:20:29,368
happens to be a mental activity dampener

460
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:31,899
that is ten pounds of cerebellum proof

461
00:20:31,901 --> 00:20:33,234
anti-telepathy somani steel.

462
00:20:33,236 --> 00:20:35,402
Thank you very much.

463
00:20:35,404 --> 00:20:36,770
Yeah, that's the problem.

464
00:20:36,772 --> 00:20:40,407
It is... It's ten pounds of that stuff.

465
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:41,408
So?

466
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,409
Oh, gee... Okay.

467
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,285
And?

468
00:20:51,287 --> 00:20:54,712
I can't sleep like this, Harry.

469
00:20:54,715 --> 00:20:57,291
Does this look comfortable to you?

470
00:20:57,293 --> 00:20:59,126
I guess I was... While I was pulling

471
00:20:59,128 --> 00:21:00,861
state of the art
technology out of my ass

472
00:21:00,863 --> 00:21:02,396
to help you with your problem,

473
00:21:02,398 --> 00:21:05,031
I forgot to make things
comfortable for you.

474
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:06,215
Are you kidding me with comfortable?

475
00:21:06,217 --> 00:21:07,267
You know what else I forgot?

476
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:08,787
I guess I also forgot
while I was coming up

477
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,054
with a generational breakthrough...

478
00:21:10,056 --> 00:21:11,979
And vibrational brainwave theory,

479
00:21:11,982 --> 00:21:13,974
that I was working for
the Princess and the Pea.

480
00:21:13,976 --> 00:21:16,210
Stop it! Stop!

481
00:21:16,212 --> 00:21:17,300
Put it down.

482
00:21:18,681 --> 00:21:20,781
Harry?

483
00:21:20,783 --> 00:21:21,815
Put it down.

484
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,920
Oh, okay. Just...

485
00:21:28,524 --> 00:21:30,457
What the hell is wrong with you?

486
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:31,592
I'm frustrated.

487
00:21:31,594 --> 00:21:34,235
- You're frustrated?
- Yes.

488
00:21:34,238 --> 00:21:38,265
You start yelling at
me and throwing things?

489
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:40,401
It is like every awful
thought that you have,

490
00:21:40,403 --> 00:21:43,570
it just comes pouring out of
your mouth totally unfiltered.

491
00:21:43,572 --> 00:21:44,905
I don't even under...

492
00:21:46,142 --> 00:21:49,410
Is this normal behavior for you?

493
00:21:49,413 --> 00:21:50,944
Sometimes behavior.

494
00:21:50,946 --> 00:21:53,681
Okay. If I wanna hear a grown man

495
00:21:53,683 --> 00:21:55,233
scream like a child,

496
00:21:55,236 --> 00:21:56,927
I will go home and listen
to Joe's stress dreams

497
00:21:56,929 --> 00:21:58,810
about showing up naked to math class.

498
00:21:58,813 --> 00:21:59,879
- Eww.
- Just...

499
00:21:59,882 --> 00:22:01,281
Take your thing, Harry.

500
00:22:02,486 --> 00:22:04,144
- See you later.
- It's heavy.

501
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,019
You missed. Again.

502
00:22:14,022 --> 00:22:15,869
Well, what do you expect, Ralph?

503
00:22:15,871 --> 00:22:18,305
I've been doing this all day.

504
00:22:18,307 --> 00:22:19,473
I need a water break.

505
00:22:24,013 --> 00:22:25,332
Maybe we should call it a night.

506
00:22:25,335 --> 00:22:26,358
Not yet.

507
00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:28,182
She's barely landed
another shot on Ralph.

508
00:22:28,184 --> 00:22:29,715
She needs more time, Bare.

509
00:22:29,718 --> 00:22:31,752
She held her own against DeVoe.

510
00:22:31,754 --> 00:22:33,354
Totally on raw instinct.

511
00:22:33,356 --> 00:22:35,055
Beginner's luck?

512
00:22:35,057 --> 00:22:37,157
I mean, it took months to train Ralph.

513
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:38,759
We don't have months.

514
00:22:38,761 --> 00:22:42,467
Look, this is our chance
to get ahead for once.

515
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,270
If DeVoe shows up again...

516
00:22:45,901 --> 00:22:46,980
We have to be ready.

517
00:22:49,138 --> 00:22:51,205
All right, Ralph, I'm taking over.

518
00:22:51,207 --> 00:22:53,040
Uh, thanks, Bare, but we kinda got this

519
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:56,777
- covered over here and...
- Gotta push her, Ralph.

520
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:59,079
All right, Izzy, I
wanna see if you can hit

521
00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:00,547
a moving target.

522
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:02,616
- Okay.
- You ready?

523
00:23:11,494 --> 00:23:12,926
Nice.

524
00:23:12,928 --> 00:23:14,363
Take it up a few notches.

525
00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:27,875
Ow!

526
00:23:27,877 --> 00:23:29,443
Barry!

527
00:23:29,445 --> 00:23:30,477
Whoa!

528
00:23:32,348 --> 00:23:33,847
Mmm!

529
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:35,413
Oh!

530
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,603
How's Izzy?

531
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:52,101
She just needs a couple stitches,

532
00:23:52,104 --> 00:23:53,706
but she'll be okay.

533
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,307
Ralph won't leave her side.

534
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,842
I think he might really like her.

535
00:23:56,844 --> 00:23:58,644
Ralph shouldn't be bothering her at all.

536
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:01,647
I mean, she needs to stay focused.

537
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:04,026
Izzy might be scrappy, but, you know,

538
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:05,941
it's her first day training
with powers she's had

539
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:06,976
for a little while.

540
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,018
I know.

541
00:24:08,021 --> 00:24:09,955
Barry, don't you think you're
being a little hard on her?

542
00:24:09,957 --> 00:24:12,124
No, I'm trying to teach
her how to protect herself.

543
00:24:12,127 --> 00:24:13,922
No, it seems like
you're trying to turn her

544
00:24:13,925 --> 00:24:14,901
into a hero.

545
00:24:14,904 --> 00:24:17,000
And that path just isn't
meant for everyone, Barry.

546
00:24:17,003 --> 00:24:19,565
I mean, Izzy's just trying to survive.

547
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:21,600
Well, she's not going
to if I don't push her.

548
00:24:21,602 --> 00:24:24,370
You think this is the
only way to fight DeVoe?

549
00:24:24,372 --> 00:24:26,839
It's not just about that.

550
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:29,642
Iris, you weren't at Iron Heights.

551
00:24:29,644 --> 00:24:32,773
I saw up close what DeVoe did to Becky.

552
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:34,979
To all of them. They...

553
00:24:34,982 --> 00:24:36,448
And I... I couldn't do anything

554
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,852
except just stand and watch it happen.

555
00:24:41,489 --> 00:24:43,489
DeVoe is ruthless.

556
00:24:43,491 --> 00:24:47,893
He's not gonna stop until he's
taken her powers and her life.

557
00:24:47,895 --> 00:24:50,429
He's not gonna go easy
on her, so neither can I.

558
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:58,270
I am so sorry that you
had to experience that.

559
00:24:58,272 --> 00:25:01,306
But Barry, we can't
be ruthless like DeVoe.

560
00:25:01,308 --> 00:25:06,345
He's willing to sacrifice
anyone and anything.

561
00:25:06,347 --> 00:25:08,969
Just remember that the next
time you're pushing too hard,

562
00:25:08,972 --> 00:25:10,716
okay?

563
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:13,652
You of all people know that
heroes aren't made overnight.

564
00:25:22,296 --> 00:25:23,595
Joe's not here.

565
00:25:23,597 --> 00:25:25,197
Well, I don't wanna talk to Joe.

566
00:25:25,199 --> 00:25:27,700
I kind of figured after
our last conversation

567
00:25:27,702 --> 00:25:29,687
you would never wanna speak to me again.

568
00:25:31,951 --> 00:25:34,094
You do know I can hear
your thoughts, right?

569
00:25:34,097 --> 00:25:35,441
Right.

570
00:25:35,443 --> 00:25:37,609
No, Harry, I'm not
gonna yell at you again.

571
00:25:37,612 --> 00:25:40,045
- Just...
- All right, good.

572
00:25:40,047 --> 00:25:42,214
Here.

573
00:25:42,216 --> 00:25:45,784
- That's the...
- Mental activity dampener.

574
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:49,293
Sorry version 2.0.

575
00:25:49,296 --> 00:25:51,163
Just adhere it to
your supraobital ridge.

576
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:52,375
You'll block West out.

577
00:25:52,378 --> 00:25:53,892
Look, I'm sorry about...

578
00:25:55,629 --> 00:25:57,896
You know, I just recently
can't seem to stop DeVoe,

579
00:25:57,898 --> 00:25:59,798
can't stop my daughter
Jessie from hating me,

580
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,857
can't seem to stop blowing
it when I'm trying to befriend

581
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:03,125
someone who's my own age.

582
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,336
Did you just say befriend?

583
00:26:04,338 --> 00:26:05,637
That's what you've been trying to do?

584
00:26:05,639 --> 00:26:07,500
You've been trying to befriend me?

585
00:26:07,503 --> 00:26:09,975
Well, yes, through transitive property.

586
00:26:09,977 --> 00:26:12,563
I respect West, West respects you, so...

587
00:26:12,566 --> 00:26:15,247
Harry, that was borderline sweet.

588
00:26:15,249 --> 00:26:16,448
Thank you.

589
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,550
Okay, well, let's talk.

590
00:26:18,552 --> 00:26:20,285
When?

591
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,961
- Now.
- Okay.

592
00:26:21,964 --> 00:26:23,455
Okay.

593
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,133
- I'm not much...
- Come on, Harry.

594
00:26:26,927 --> 00:26:27,960
Okay.

595
00:26:29,831 --> 00:26:31,211
What do you wanna talk about?

596
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,598
Oh, okay. I'll start.

597
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,897
Um, you wanna tell me
how this thing works?

598
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,167
Like, does it... does it keep
Joe's brainwaves blocked out?

599
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,337
Does it keep my mind
reading waves locked in?

600
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:42,806
It mostly disrupts
inbound brain activity,

601
00:26:42,808 --> 00:26:48,540
but I suppose actually if you
were to reverse the polarity...

602
00:26:49,824 --> 00:26:53,050
Wow, that is interesting.

603
00:26:53,052 --> 00:26:55,119
- Also.
- Yes.

604
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:56,290
Harry, you have to do that.

605
00:26:56,293 --> 00:26:58,255
- Right.
- Right now.

606
00:26:58,257 --> 00:26:59,823
- Okay, good chat.
- Yeah.

607
00:26:59,825 --> 00:27:01,425
Okay.

608
00:27:03,963 --> 00:27:05,629
Should be good to go.

609
00:27:05,631 --> 00:27:07,831
Might be a little scar, though.

610
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,867
Wouldn't be my first, doc.

611
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:11,468
Probably won't be my last.

612
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,404
It will be, if I have
anything to do with it.

613
00:27:13,406 --> 00:27:15,439
Why would you have
anything to do with it?

614
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:19,175
I'm gonna go.

615
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,916
Wh... What are you doing?

616
00:27:25,918 --> 00:27:27,952
The way I see it, I've
gotten more hurt here

617
00:27:27,954 --> 00:27:29,586
than I ever did fighting DeVoe,

618
00:27:29,588 --> 00:27:32,222
so I'm not going to spend
another second training.

619
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:36,126
Okay, that is a really bad idea.

620
00:27:36,128 --> 00:27:37,928
I've already hurt DeVoe.

621
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,331
By myself, without y'all.

622
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:42,099
I can do it again.

623
00:27:42,101 --> 00:27:45,069
Izzy, the only way for
you to stay safe is for you

624
00:27:45,071 --> 00:27:46,961
to stay with us.

625
00:27:49,175 --> 00:27:50,841
It's the buddy system, right?

626
00:27:50,843 --> 00:27:53,711
You're not my buddy, Ralph.

627
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,380
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

628
00:27:58,451 --> 00:27:59,563
Don't do this.

629
00:28:10,577 --> 00:28:12,563
Sorry, Ralphie.

630
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:17,634
Initially I envisioned the
mental activity dampener

631
00:28:17,636 --> 00:28:20,637
as just disrupting inbound
brainwave broadcasts,

632
00:28:20,639 --> 00:28:22,439
but I talked to DA Cecille Horton

633
00:28:22,441 --> 00:28:25,024
and we had the idea to invert
the polarity allowing this

634
00:28:25,027 --> 00:28:28,191
to disrupt outbound
brainwave broadcasts as well.

635
00:28:28,194 --> 00:28:29,391
- So we...
- We could use this

636
00:28:29,393 --> 00:28:30,464
against DeVoe.

637
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:32,033
We could use this against DeVoe.

638
00:28:32,036 --> 00:28:33,717
That's brilliant.

639
00:28:33,719 --> 00:28:35,419
I'm totally on board.

640
00:28:35,421 --> 00:28:37,721
Except... mental activity dampener?

641
00:28:37,723 --> 00:28:38,989
Ramon, the name's no good.

642
00:28:38,991 --> 00:28:40,958
Which is why... Drum roll, please...

643
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,096
I have decided to rename
this the cerebral inhibitor.

644
00:28:46,098 --> 00:28:49,066
This is where we came up
with the cerebral inhibitor

645
00:28:49,068 --> 00:28:50,601
to use against DeVoe.

646
00:28:52,038 --> 00:28:53,537
What's that? What are you guys doing?

647
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:55,672
What are... What are those faces?

648
00:28:55,674 --> 00:28:57,441
When Savitar came to S.T.A.R. Labs,

649
00:28:57,443 --> 00:29:00,344
he said we would build a
device to use against DeVoe.

650
00:29:00,346 --> 00:29:01,879
The cerebral inhibitor.

651
00:29:01,882 --> 00:29:03,747
I wish I had known that
before I spent all this time

652
00:29:03,749 --> 00:29:05,015
trying to come up with the second name.

653
00:29:05,017 --> 00:29:06,250
Naming is hard.

654
00:29:06,252 --> 00:29:07,918
Okay, so we can use this on DeVoe

655
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,820
to keep him from
projecting his consciousness

656
00:29:09,822 --> 00:29:11,383
- into new bodies.
- Precisely.

657
00:29:11,386 --> 00:29:12,523
How does it work?

658
00:29:12,525 --> 00:29:13,969
Just affix it to his forehead.

659
00:29:13,972 --> 00:29:15,410
It activates. Simple as that.

660
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:17,212
I'll make a few adjustments,
you'll be good to go.

661
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,082
All right.

662
00:29:18,085 --> 00:29:20,097
Okay, when Harry's
done, we go after DeVoe.

663
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:23,019
I mean, we have Izzy's powers,
the cerebral inhibitor...

664
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:24,902
I mean, we have everything
that we need to stop him.

665
00:29:24,904 --> 00:29:26,603
Except that we don't.

666
00:29:26,605 --> 00:29:27,938
Izzy's gone.

667
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,285
What? What happened?

668
00:29:29,288 --> 00:29:30,251
What did you say to her?

669
00:29:30,254 --> 00:29:31,511
- Me?
- Yeah.

670
00:29:31,514 --> 00:29:34,111
Rookie, Homeslice hit
the road because of you.

671
00:29:34,113 --> 00:29:36,380
She's convinced she can
take on DeVoe by herself.

672
00:29:36,382 --> 00:29:38,115
That's what she's gone to do.

673
00:29:38,117 --> 00:29:39,850
You kept pushing and pushing her.

674
00:29:39,852 --> 00:29:41,452
Pushed her right out the door, man.

675
00:29:41,454 --> 00:29:42,419
Okay, that's not fair.

676
00:29:42,421 --> 00:29:43,587
No, it's all right.

677
00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:45,022
I did, I pushed her too hard.

678
00:29:45,024 --> 00:29:46,290
It's my fault that she's out there.

679
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:48,001
But if DeVoe gets to her before we do...

680
00:29:48,004 --> 00:29:51,428
That cannot happen.

681
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,231
Cisco, you need to use your
ESPN and find out where she is.

682
00:29:54,233 --> 00:29:55,299
Give me that thing.

683
00:30:01,874 --> 00:30:03,841
Hey, blondie!

684
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,410
You want trouble? Here I am.

685
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:12,749
Well!

686
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:16,520
Look who finally decided
to show her sorry face.

687
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:23,193
Nobody likes a peeping Tom.

688
00:30:23,195 --> 00:30:25,516
Good-bye, Mr. Ramon.

689
00:30:32,438 --> 00:30:34,004
Cisco, are you okay? Can you hear me?

690
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:36,206
She's at the warehouse district.

691
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:37,582
DeVoe's there.

692
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,735
I can't go with you guys.

693
00:30:38,738 --> 00:30:39,879
I gotta take care of Cisco.

694
00:30:39,882 --> 00:30:40,949
All right, Ralph, it's just me and you.

695
00:30:40,951 --> 00:30:42,117
Come on.

696
00:30:46,706 --> 00:30:48,428
Bravo, Ms. Bowen.

697
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:49,773
Of all my subjects,

698
00:30:49,776 --> 00:30:51,209
you're the only one to mount

699
00:30:51,211 --> 00:30:53,311
a credible defense against me.

700
00:30:53,313 --> 00:30:57,215
Darlin', you talk too much.

701
00:31:03,223 --> 00:31:07,292
A modicum of bad luck
at a time like this.

702
00:31:07,294 --> 00:31:09,794
How unfortunate.

703
00:31:09,796 --> 00:31:11,396
You're quite the fiddler.

704
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:14,766
The fiddler, Mr. Ramon might say,

705
00:31:14,768 --> 00:31:16,801
nailed it and won.

706
00:31:20,274 --> 00:31:23,942
Ralph? You came after me.

707
00:31:23,944 --> 00:31:25,910
We all did.

708
00:31:25,912 --> 00:31:28,246
Hey, Ralph, I'll keep DeVoe busy.

709
00:31:28,248 --> 00:31:29,948
You just get the inhibitor on.

710
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,950
Hello, Mr. Allen.

711
00:31:31,952 --> 00:31:34,486
DeVoe, you're not getting her.

712
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,894
Flash!

713
00:31:52,172 --> 00:31:53,972
Poor Dominic.

714
00:31:53,974 --> 00:31:57,709
He didn't know he could affect
minds as well as read them.

715
00:31:57,711 --> 00:32:01,880
Now I've taught you what a
brain aneurysm feels like.

716
00:32:03,984 --> 00:32:05,152
Get out of here.

717
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,363
Ah, crap!

718
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:28,106
Thank you, Mr. Rundine.

719
00:32:32,346 --> 00:32:34,579
That'll teach you to
mess with a country girl.

720
00:32:36,483 --> 00:32:38,016
Cerebral inhibitor's attached.

721
00:32:38,018 --> 00:32:39,384
Is it working?

722
00:32:39,386 --> 00:32:40,385
Oh, it's working.

723
00:32:40,387 --> 00:32:45,390
How did Mr. Deacon put it?

724
00:32:45,392 --> 00:32:48,059
Ah, yes.

725
00:32:48,061 --> 00:32:50,691
Call me Killgore.

726
00:32:55,369 --> 00:32:56,501
The hell?

727
00:32:56,503 --> 00:32:57,902
Did she hack the inhibitor?

728
00:32:57,904 --> 00:32:59,070
No, no, no, that's impossible.

729
00:32:59,072 --> 00:33:00,505
There's a kill switch microchip

730
00:33:00,507 --> 00:33:02,173
that prevents the patch from networking.

731
00:33:02,175 --> 00:33:06,978
I can hear your radio signal, Mr. Wells.

732
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,882
You told me once I wasn't
as smart as I thought.

733
00:33:10,884 --> 00:33:13,551
Wrong again.

734
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,843
Izzy!

735
00:33:23,797 --> 00:33:25,797
Oh!

736
00:33:29,536 --> 00:33:31,281
- Ralph?
- Hey!

737
00:33:32,773 --> 00:33:34,205
Get her out of there!

738
00:33:34,207 --> 00:33:36,241
Ralph, we can't.

739
00:33:36,243 --> 00:33:37,575
Get her out!

740
00:33:40,313 --> 00:33:41,780
We can't.

741
00:33:49,623 --> 00:33:51,322
Izzy, just look at me.

742
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:07,439
Izzy!

743
00:34:07,441 --> 00:34:08,940
Keep looking at me!

744
00:34:35,368 --> 00:34:37,969
Much better.

745
00:34:39,673 --> 00:34:44,309
Oh, please inform Mr. Ramon
that, while I had no need

746
00:34:44,311 --> 00:34:46,511
for all six of my powers,

747
00:34:46,513 --> 00:34:48,746
I now have a seventh.

748
00:34:48,748 --> 00:34:52,317
I'm afraid I'm gonna be busy
with my wife this weekend,

749
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:53,284
Ralphie.

750
00:34:53,286 --> 00:34:54,686
No.

751
00:35:33,255 --> 00:35:35,221
- How's Ralph?
- Not great.

752
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:38,925
This shouldn't have happened.

753
00:35:38,927 --> 00:35:40,971
DeVoe wasn't supposed
to walk away from this.

754
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:42,429
Yeah, well, he did.

755
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,831
- Because of me.
- We all tried to protect her.

756
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:46,299
I built the inhibitor, Snow.

757
00:35:46,301 --> 00:35:47,367
If it failed, it's my fault.

758
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:48,355
And I don't even know why.

759
00:35:48,357 --> 00:35:50,335
Maybe I overestimated
the micro-combustion

760
00:35:50,338 --> 00:35:52,338
infrastructure, or
maybe I underestimated

761
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,841
the amount of time between
each synapse router, or...

762
00:35:54,843 --> 00:35:56,604
Maybe it didn't malfunction at all.

763
00:35:56,607 --> 00:35:58,845
Guys, Savitar said that we would use

764
00:35:58,847 --> 00:36:00,713
the cerebral inhibitor against DeVoe.

765
00:36:00,715 --> 00:36:02,215
Yeah, he didn't say it was gonna work.

766
00:36:02,217 --> 00:36:03,383
Yeah, well, it didn't work.

767
00:36:03,385 --> 00:36:04,617
'Cause...

768
00:36:06,221 --> 00:36:07,915
I'm not smart enough to make it work.

769
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:09,089
Harry!

770
00:36:09,091 --> 00:36:11,825
- Where are you going?
- Out.

771
00:36:11,827 --> 00:36:13,963
- Guys, we have to find DeVoe again.
- How?

772
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:15,680
Cisco tracked down
DeVoe in his Vibe state,

773
00:36:15,683 --> 00:36:16,830
and he almost got himself killed.

774
00:36:16,832 --> 00:36:18,598
Actually...

775
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,034
We might have a different
way of pinpointing him.

776
00:36:21,036 --> 00:36:23,803
Check this out.

777
00:36:23,805 --> 00:36:27,740
Space. The final frontier.

778
00:36:27,742 --> 00:36:29,175
Now you see it...

779
00:36:30,745 --> 00:36:31,973
Now you don't.

780
00:36:31,976 --> 00:36:33,189
That's exactly what it looks like

781
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,714
when DeVoe disappears.

782
00:36:34,716 --> 00:36:37,984
That is the warping
signature of someone moving

783
00:36:37,986 --> 00:36:41,121
into a pocket dimension.

784
00:36:41,123 --> 00:36:43,289
Does someone wanna
explain what that means?

785
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:45,658
Einstein postulated that it
was theoretically possible

786
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,587
for a region-specific fold
in the space time to exist

787
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,402
between the four dimensions
that we typically think of.

788
00:36:52,405 --> 00:36:53,566
Yeah, that doesn't help.

789
00:36:53,568 --> 00:36:54,767
It's...

790
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:56,603
It's another dimension.

791
00:36:56,605 --> 00:37:00,860
One that you can enter or exit
at any location in the world.

792
00:37:00,863 --> 00:37:02,675
Like how DeVoe captured me in that alley

793
00:37:02,677 --> 00:37:05,378
but then he brought me back
out to somewhere above the city.

794
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,081
Are you saying that DeVoe's
lair is in a pocket dimension?

795
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:09,204
Cisco, this is great.

796
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:10,416
Can we track him?

797
00:37:10,418 --> 00:37:12,452
That I'm, uh, still working on.

798
00:37:12,454 --> 00:37:13,641
Okay, work faster.

799
00:37:16,691 --> 00:37:19,277
Just do your best, all
right? Let's find him.

800
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,093
- All right.
- I'm gonna go check on Ralph.

801
00:37:21,096 --> 00:37:22,162
All right.

802
00:37:25,066 --> 00:37:27,133
You were right.

803
00:37:27,135 --> 00:37:31,304
As much as I wanna get
DeVoe, get back to our lives,

804
00:37:31,306 --> 00:37:33,173
I can't rush this.

805
00:37:33,175 --> 00:37:35,141
It's gonna be a little
hard for a speedster.

806
00:37:35,144 --> 00:37:37,877
Especially an unemployed speedster.

807
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:39,979
Don't worry. You're
gonna find something.

808
00:37:39,981 --> 00:37:41,948
And until then?

809
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:44,001
You can start by kissing your wife.

810
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:52,158
Someone looks busy.

811
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,294
Yep, just a little bit of work.

812
00:37:54,296 --> 00:37:55,361
Why don't you have a...

813
00:37:55,363 --> 00:37:56,930
Okay.

814
00:37:56,932 --> 00:37:58,431
- Harry.
- Yes?

815
00:37:58,433 --> 00:37:59,999
- I wanted to say thank you.
- For what?

816
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:02,834
The MAD 2.0. It works like a charm.

817
00:38:02,837 --> 00:38:03,970
I am rested.

818
00:38:03,973 --> 00:38:05,038
If you could just do something

819
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,672
about these swollen
pregnant ankles of mine...

820
00:38:06,674 --> 00:38:07,674
I think that's a normal thing.

821
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:08,762
Drink lots of water.

822
00:38:08,765 --> 00:38:09,978
Don't cross your legs when you sit.

823
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,843
- Okay.
- Okay.

824
00:38:10,845 --> 00:38:12,111
Thank you for the info.

825
00:38:12,113 --> 00:38:13,713
Least I could do after all the...

826
00:38:15,884 --> 00:38:17,717
Rage. I have a problem with rage.

827
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:21,154
Apparently it tends to crop
up when I make mistakes.

828
00:38:21,156 --> 00:38:22,555
Makes it tough to be human.

829
00:38:22,557 --> 00:38:25,051
Well, humans are a tricky species.

830
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:26,359
Anyway, I apologize.

831
00:38:26,361 --> 00:38:28,127
Apology accepted.

832
00:38:28,129 --> 00:38:30,296
You just needed somebody to talk to.

833
00:38:30,298 --> 00:38:31,735
Yeah, well, I...

834
00:38:33,585 --> 00:38:35,469
Are you doing that thing
where you're reading my mind?

835
00:38:35,471 --> 00:38:37,285
You're reading my mind, aren't you?

836
00:38:37,288 --> 00:38:39,871
Maybe. Yeah, yeah, I am.

837
00:38:39,874 --> 00:38:41,264
You should call her, Harry.

838
00:38:41,267 --> 00:38:43,376
Jessie's on a different
planet, DA Cecille Horton.

839
00:38:43,378 --> 00:38:45,144
But this problem isn't
gonna just go away.

840
00:38:45,146 --> 00:38:46,412
What if she...

841
00:38:47,682 --> 00:38:48,848
What if she doesn't come?

842
00:38:50,585 --> 00:38:52,488
You're not gonna know
unless you invite her.

843
00:39:09,904 --> 00:39:11,704
That was beautiful.

844
00:39:11,706 --> 00:39:15,241
And a welcome change from
the derivative pabulum

845
00:39:15,243 --> 00:39:17,477
this body subjected us to before.

846
00:39:18,813 --> 00:39:21,114
Our plan is back on schedule.

847
00:39:21,116 --> 00:39:23,383
Indeed it is.

848
00:39:23,385 --> 00:39:25,952
Only a few more bus
metas left to locate.

849
00:39:51,363 --> 00:39:53,046
Hey, man.

850
00:39:53,048 --> 00:39:54,380
I can come back if...

851
00:39:54,382 --> 00:39:56,449
No, it's... it's okay.

852
00:39:58,538 --> 00:40:00,787
Look, um...

853
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:02,955
I totally understand if
you need some time away

854
00:40:02,957 --> 00:40:03,923
from the team.

855
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:11,431
I mean, to lose someone
right in front of you...

856
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:13,299
Especially someone you care about...

857
00:40:14,436 --> 00:40:17,970
Izzy was very special.

858
00:40:17,972 --> 00:40:19,205
She was.

859
00:40:20,775 --> 00:40:22,709
But... But now...

860
00:40:24,446 --> 00:40:27,480
DeVoe's still out there.

861
00:40:27,483 --> 00:40:30,238
And until that threat's over...

862
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:32,285
We gotta keep this buddy system going.

863
00:40:34,989 --> 00:40:36,622
I thought you might say that, Allen.

864
00:40:36,624 --> 00:40:39,516
Which is why I got you this.

865
00:40:43,798 --> 00:40:45,398
You want me to be your partner?

866
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,899
Oh, hey, come on.

867
00:40:46,901 --> 00:40:49,635
This, uh, this Turner
don't need no Hooch.

868
00:40:49,637 --> 00:40:51,170
But...

869
00:40:51,172 --> 00:40:53,806
I do know what it's like
to get fired from CCPD

870
00:40:53,808 --> 00:40:55,985
when you didn't even
really break the law.

871
00:40:55,988 --> 00:40:57,577
You absolutely broke the law.

872
00:40:57,579 --> 00:41:01,748
And I remember after I lost my job,

873
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,817
felt like I lost a piece of my identity.

874
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:07,605
And now you won't have
to deal with that problem.

875
00:41:07,608 --> 00:41:09,255
So the next time we're out in the field

876
00:41:09,257 --> 00:41:10,757
and somebody asks you who you work for,

877
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,725
you won't have to get all stammery.

878
00:41:14,129 --> 00:41:16,129
You like me.

879
00:41:16,131 --> 00:41:17,597
You really like me.

880
00:41:20,163 --> 00:41:22,802
Don't go getting all
soft on me now, rookie.

881
00:41:24,439 --> 00:41:25,872
You and I, we gotta stand up,

882
00:41:25,874 --> 00:41:27,473
and we gotta fight back.

883
00:41:27,475 --> 00:41:29,075
Just like Izzy would have wanted.

884
00:41:29,077 --> 00:41:31,511
That's right.

885
00:41:31,513 --> 00:41:33,646
There's three more people
out there who need our help,

886
00:41:33,648 --> 00:41:37,116
and we need to find
them before DeVoe does.

887
00:41:37,118 --> 00:41:39,519
And after we do that...

888
00:41:39,521 --> 00:41:41,289
I'm gonna take DeVoe down.

889
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,377
