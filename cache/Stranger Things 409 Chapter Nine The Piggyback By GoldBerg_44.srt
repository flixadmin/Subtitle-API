00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,660
- And she's...
- <font color="#138ce9">JOYCE:</font> No.

298
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,370
She's telling the truth.

299
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,660
When we were in the lab,
those particles we saw,

300
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,370
they were alive.

301
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,420
And if they're alive,
that means a gate's open in Hawkins.

302
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,750
"Gate"? What does this mean?

303
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,920
It means we have to go home right now.

304
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,090
What is taking so long?

305
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,010
I thought you said he was close.

306
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,390
Yeah, close to sabotaging us, you mean.

307
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,390
We think he's playing us again.

308
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,560
So put a goddamn gun to his head.

309
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,230
And then what?
He just spits out more lies.

310
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,650
<font color="#138ce9">MURRAY:</font> It's moot anyway.

311
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,690
If your kids are truly
in some kind of imminent danger,

312
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,540
even if we were to leave this very moment,
we wouldn't make it in time.

313
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,570
The earliest we'd get there
is late tomorrow.

314
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,660
No, we… we don't have to make it back.

315
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,780
Not tonight.

316
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,450
Whatever this evil is,

317
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,910
we know it's connected to the hive mind.

318
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,710
And now we know
part of that hive mind is in Russia.

319
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,000
So we don't need
to get back to Hawkins to fight it.

320
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,790
All we need is to destroy those particles.

321
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,040
<font color="#138ce9">JOYCE:</font> And if we're lucky,

322
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,340
it'll hurt it enough
to give the kids the upper hand.

323
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,510
Wait, time out.

324
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,100
We're talking about the particles
inside the prison?

325
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,890
The prison that
we just narrowly escaped from?

326
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,060
We broke out.

327
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,100
We can break back in.

328
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,520
Jim!

329
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,900
The entire Soviet army is looking for us.

330
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,690
Sure. And we'll be exactly
where they least expect.

331
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,240
All right. There is a fine line
between courage and stupidity,

332
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,030
and this falls very far
on the side of stupid.

333
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,490
This is <i>Dirty Dozen</i> stuff.

334
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,830
Except there are, uh, four of us.

335
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,580
Three, actually.

336
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,000
Breaking back in's gonna be easier
than breaking out.

337
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,000
Which is why we need an airlift.
This is where you come in.

- For…?

450
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,490
For giving my head
the biggest thump of its life

451
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,570
two years ago.

452
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,490
I needed it.

453
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,450
It's changed my life.

454
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,330
And now I'm crawling forward.

455
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
Slowly.

456
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,750
I just wonder sometimes…

457
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,090
You know, if… some other girl had given me
a proper thump before we'd met,

458
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,430
would things have been different?

459
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:23,640
Like, if we were meeting together
for the first time right now, part of me…

460
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,690
I dunno, part of me
thinks we would've made it.

About the Winnebago?

with my six lil' nuggets?
