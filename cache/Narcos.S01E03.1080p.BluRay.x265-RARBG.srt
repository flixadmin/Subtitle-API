I'm more of a dog man myself,
but no cat deserves this.

2

Did you tell anyone
about why you were down here?

3
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:32,009
Someone on the plane?
Someone you met at a restaurant?

4
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:33,117
'Course not.

5
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:37,121
Not to get personal,
but have you had any, uh... encounters?

Right.

Only people I've encountered
outside the DEA and my wife

Did anyone have access
to your credentials?

Did you drop your wallet?

14

How important is this cat to you?

[Javier]
You gave someone your passport?

18
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,399
We were trying to get puff
through immigration.

"Puff"?

I didn't name it, dude.

Don't let it rattle you.
That's what they want.

You probably got a price on your head,
but no one's gonna take the contract.

00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:21,249
Fucking price on my head?

26
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:25,753
There's a standing bounty
of 350,000 us on any DEA down here,

27
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,631

[Steve]
The "kiki" pefia was referring to

29
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,348
was kiki camarena, a DEA agent who went
after the Guadalajara cartel in Mexico.

30
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:39,725
Kiki was captured and tortured.

31
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:42,812
They skinned his legs,
put a bullet in each limb,

32

until he died.

government agent and get away with it?

35

Uncle Sam doesn't fuck around.
The cocksuckers paid in blood.

They went after them so hard,
every single narco in the world

that the DEA is off-limits.

Kiki was like Jesus Christ to us.

39
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:07,962
He died to save us all.

Do not tell Connie that story.

41
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:12,633
I won't.

- Why?

And I have more money
than any of those sons of bitches.

If you run for congress, you put yourself
in the public eye, you become a target.

"I made my money from taxis" isn't going

Pablo, you need a party that supports you.

00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,612
You need a proper political campaign.

I buy the press, my love.

for president. It was crazy, right?

Well, not in Colombia.
Not in the mid-'80s.

80
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,974
As far as Colombians go,
Pablo wasn't a drug dealer at all.

81
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,142
He was a fucking winner.

82

The living embodiment
of the Colombian dream.

83

The guy who'd buy houses for the poor
in exchange for nothing.

84
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,403
As far as Pablo could tell, the doors
to political success were there...

85
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,573
And all he had to do was to get to them.

86
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,952
And in order to do that,

87
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:53,998
he asked Valeria velez
to introduce him to Fernando duque.

88
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:03,048
Duque was a lawyer and a lobbyist
who represented the new liberals,

a party who claimed
to represent the people.

Mr. Duque.

It gives me great pleasure to invite you

Please.

Look, I am not a rich person.
I am a poor person with money.

98
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:39,168
And for that reason,
I think that...

99
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,504
Well, I think that
I understand the people

100
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,798
to whom the new liberalism
wants to give a voice.

101
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:49,470
The party clearly needs to hear
what you have to say, Mr. Escobar.

- No, no...
- Look, I am not a politician.

I am not a successful lawyer like you.
I come from the street... brother.

I want to reassure you
that you will receive your piece.

$300,000 just for you.

for the justice minister or what?

He has created sources of employment

00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,504
You bring your fucking mouth
back here immediately!

311
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,132
- Yes. I'm sorry, boss.
- Now!

312
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,553
The son of a bitch policeman
tapped my phone!

313
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,058
- These fags.
- — you have a very big mouth, poison.

314
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,726
Pablo is really pissed off.

315
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,855
Shut that mug,
or you will never reach 66, you hear?

316
00:19:58,615 --> 00:19:59,783
Ok!

[Men chattering in Spanish]

318
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:08,625
[Speaking English]
I'm calling this off. Nobody's coming.

319
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:13,046
- What the fuck has happened here?
- Maybe poison spotted the spotter.

320
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,714
Either that or Suarez sold you out.

321
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,217
[Sighs] Yeah, if he did,
he must've had a better offer,

322
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,135
and it wasn't a fucking cat.

323
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,576
[Speaking Spanish]
He has been called the "paisa Robin hood,"

324
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,519
but he is much more than that.

325
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:31,272
He is a man to whom the people
mean a great deal. All of us.

326
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:34,275
[Steve] To avoid suspicion
and questioning about his fortune,

327
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,654
Pablo ran as an alternate
for Jairo Ortega,

328
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,073
a former congressman from antioquia.

329
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,783
[Cheers and applause]

330
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:46,704
It was the first time an alternate was
more important than the main candidate.

331
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:57,424
[Speaking Spanish] I am tired... of the
people with power running this country.

332
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:03,638
This is a fight between the people
with power and poor people, weak people.

333
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:07,517
And this fight must begin here!

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,645
[Cheers and applause]

335
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:16,693
To have power does not mean
that one can abuse the poor.

336
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,069
If I am elected...

337

If my friend, Jairo, is elected...

338
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:26,703
Those who have never had a voice
will have a voice.

[Cheers and applause]

Those who are hungry will have food.

Those who want to learn will have schools.

342
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,048
And those who have dreams

343
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:43,344
will see that there are no limits
to what you can achieve.

- Yes.
- [Valeria] Very good, Pablo.

356

There are a few things we can improve,
but we'll work on them.

Ok, whatever you say.

358
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:42,737
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much, Valeria.

[Overlapping chatter in Spanish]

To vote for Jairo Ortega
is to vote for the one and only Pablo!

[Coughing, gasping]

00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:10,139
Tata, what's wrong?

365
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:16,771
Why does that woman need to know
everything about each step you take?

366
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,606
What are you talking about?

367
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:22,944
- Valeria velez.
- My love...

368

Tata, she's a newspaper woman,
a reporter who follows the news.

369
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,577
And right now, I'm the news.

370
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:36,249
When you win, don't disrespect me
anymore with that bitch.

[Softly] Come here.
Come here, come here, come here.

You are going to be the first lady
of this country one of these days.

Therefore, you are going
to have to learn to deal with the press.

[Voice quavering]
That woman is not on your level, Pablo.

To me, it looks like
you are handling things very badly.

[Sn iffs]

You need to start thinking more
about your family... and about business.

Thing is,
you can't be a politician.

Careful with the threat
you cannot execute.

You know what he's doing, right?

410
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:25,001
According to Colombian law,
a congressman has total immunity.

411
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:29,297
Do you think he's protecting himself
while we remain in the drift?

412
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,633
I do. He thinks he's that fucking
"paisa Robin hood."

413
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,802
So what do we do?

414
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:40,183
Well... we fulfill our duties,
stuffing the ballot box,

415
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:45,313
and later we let Pablo receive
the applause, and take the risk.

416
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:51,444
We continue with our business...
In the shadows, like always.

417
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:54,906
Carlos, what are the guys saying?

418
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,743
I imagine that they're worried, right?

419
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,412
They are not politically conscious,
brother.

How can you expect them
to understand your objectives?

You do understand me, brother.

422

We, Carlos, belong to the people.

I need you to use your influence with the
others to convince them that I am right.

426

If you win,
you don't need to explain anything.

And if you lose...
There's nothing to explain.

Pablo held most of his campaign rallies

in the poorest neighborhoods
of his electoral district.

443
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:37,341
He placed himself on the side
of the poor and the weak

444
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:40,887
in the fight against the oligarchs,
"the men of always."

445
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:46,392
And just like any politician,
he made plenty of promises.

446

Only difference was Pablo had the men
and the money to back them up.

What to do about that.

Gustavo made good on his promise
to quit the labs,

- so Pablo put Carlos lehder in charge.

With characteristic German efficiency,
he turned the labs into nazilandia,

and production Rose 12 percent
in just two short months.

Pablo would dispose of Jairo Ortega,

once the election was over.

466
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,504
I got a better idea.

467
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,090
We let him win.

468
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:01,485
If we put him in the spotlight
and prove he's a trafficker,

469
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:04,053
the embarrassment alone
might get this country off its ass.

470
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:08,057
[Steve]
But first, we had to get proof

471
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,643
that Pablo was the drug dealer
we knew he was.

472
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,895
So we went to Suarez,

473
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:15,314
- and gave him a lot of money.
- [Speaking Spanish]

474
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:20,820
First, he told us that Pablo
was arrested for trafficking back in '76,

475
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:24,573
and then he gave us the name
of a sergeant who could give us the files.

476
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:32,873
Problem was, Suarez was on both the DEA
and the narcos' payroll.

477
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:36,627
[Body thuds]

478
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:43,134
- Sixty-six.
- Bullshit. I shot him first.

479
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:49,491
[Steve] Then Suarez gave us
the name of the journalist

480
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:51,809
- who reported the arrest...
— [groaning]

481
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:54,562
And then the lawyer
who defended Pablo...

482
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,773
And finally, the judge
who signed Pablo's arrest warrant.

483
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,608
[Overlapping chatter]

484
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:02,194
We were like the Bermuda triangle.

485
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,613
You get too close to us,
you disappear.

486
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,074
We gotta get something
on this motherfucker.

487
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:10,289
If he was arrested,
there's gotta be a mug shot.

488
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,329
[Javier]
Yeah, well, the file's gone.

489
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,874
If there was a mug shot,
then it's gone, too.

490
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,419
If there was a photo,
there's a negative.

491
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,422
[Steve] Finally, it dawned on us.

492
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:24,967
We had to find someone
without suérez's help,

493
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:29,513
and that was the photographer
who had taken Pablo's mug shot years ago.

494
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:34,060
- [Tires screech]
- [Man grunting]

495
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:37,897
We got his negatives, and for safekeeping,
we put him into witness protection.

496
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:44,219
- How long have you had this picture?
- — that's classified.

497
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,031
And what am I doing here?

498
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,992
It's not america's role to get involved
in other countries' elections.

499
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:53,079
Once again, the hand
of the United States remains invisible.

500
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,997
Your party took money from Escobar.

501
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:56,892
I should think
you'd want to get ahead of this.

502
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:58,209
Everyone took money.

503
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:02,630
By the way, it's all American money,
so why don't you take this to the press?

504
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:05,591
It should come from you.
You're the minister of justice.

505
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:11,472
[Steve] Come election day,
sure enough, it was a landslide.

506
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,933
The new liberal party had the candidate

507
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,936
who got the most votes
in all of antioquia...

508
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:19,146
And his name was Jairo Ortega.

509
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,107
[Ortega speaking Spanish]
Ladies and gentlemen,

510
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,276
with clear use of my
mental and physical faculties...

511
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:28,322
I wish to communicate to you my decision

512
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:32,159
to resign from my seat
in the congress of the republic...

513
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:35,871
- [Crowd murmuring]
- For reasons of family and health.

514
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:40,167
But I am completely certain that
my friend Pablo Emilio Escobar gaviria

515
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:44,171
is going to continue
our social and political ideas,

516
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:47,091
because Pablo is the voice of the people.

517
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,194
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much, Jairo.

518
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:51,011
- [Applause]
- I will give my best effort.

519
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:51,971
Thank you very much.

520
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:54,890
[All singing Colombian national anthem]

[Thunder rumbles in distance]

523
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:27,840
[Steve]
Imagine you were born in a poor family,

524
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:31,844
in a poor city, in a poor country,

525
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,221
and by the time you were 28 years old,

526
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:37,349
you have so much money
you can't even count it.

527
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:40,436
[Thunder continues]

528
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,104
What do you do?

529
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:45,399
- [Bells tolling in distance]
- You make your dreams come true.

530
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,444
[Rain pattering]

531
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:51,238
[Thunder rumbles]

532
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:55,367
Problem is, nobody can control
the dreams they have.

533
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,458
Especially if you were Pablo Escobar.

534
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,046
Especially if you grew up in Colombia.

535
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:15,262
There's a reason magical realism
was born in Colombia.

536
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:20,392
It's a country where
dreams and reality are conflated...

537
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,273
Where, in their heads,
people fly as high as icarus.

538
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:32,071
But even magical realism has its limits.

539
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:35,658
[Speaking Spanish]
Congressman Escobar... sir!

540
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,326
Excuse me.

541
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,954
Allow me to remind you
of the norms of etiquette.

542
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:42,289
You cannot enter the hall
if you don't have a tie.

543
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,502
All right.

544
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,963
- What is your name?
- Juan.

545
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:50,631
Look, Juan...

546
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:54,510
That is a really nice tie.

547
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,153
- My girlfriend gave it to me.
- Really?

548
00:34:57,554 --> 00:35:01,141
Well, she's in the history books now.

549
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:03,870
- Thank you very much, my son.
- Thank you, sir.

550
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,229
- Thank you.
- All right.

551
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,068
[Steve]
And when you get too close to the sun...

552
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:14,196
Your dreams may melt away.

553
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:21,412
[Indistinct chatter in Spanish]

554
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,254
[Man] Good morning.

555
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:35,801
This is to inform you that we have
a quorum and may now begin our session.

556
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:43,183
The minister of justice,
Rodrigo Lara bonilla,

557
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,103
is present here today
to address this honorable congress.

558
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:49,773
I give the floor to you, Mr. Minister.

559
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:51,275
Thank you very much.

560
00:35:56,071 --> 00:36:00,993
Much has been made
of the issue of drug money,

561
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,623
"hot money,"
in our national political process.

562
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:11,587
I myself have been accused
of receiving campaign contributions

563
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,382
from the narcotics traffickers
who have bought influence in these halls.

564
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:22,973
To this charge, I plead guilty.

565
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:25,392
[Crowd murmuring]

566
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:29,229
In my eyes,
the sin of turning a blind eye

567
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:31,648
is as great as the sin
of outright corruption.

568
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:35,444
We are a nation of the blind,
and in our blindness,

569
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,572
we have sold our country
to the highest bidder.

570
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,994
It's time for us to open our eyes
and to see the light.

571
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:49,166
[Overlapping murmurs]

572
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:52,753
Congressman Escobar...

573
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:58,133
You stated that your great fortune
was built from a taxi company.

574
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:04,473
This photograph
clearly contradicts your claim.

575
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,768
For this reason,
I demand your resignation.

576
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:10,020
You are not welcome in this chamber.

577
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:12,398
You don't belong here.

578
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:29,748
[Inaudible murmur]

579
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,238
Thank you very much, Juan.
Very kind.

580
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:03,031
[Lara] What interests the narcos

581
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:06,702
isn't just the fall
of the minister of justice,

582
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:10,706
but also to impede the strategy of
the government to combat his interests.

583
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,668
His two arms: Silver or lead.

584
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:20,966
I want to inform the people
that the minister of justice has 24 hours

585
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:24,845
within which to present concrete proof
regarding the insinuations he made

586
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:27,890
the day before yesterday
in the hall of representatives.

587
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:32,144
To the contrary,
I will proceed to denounce him legally

588
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:35,022
before the authorities
and before the Colombian justice system.

589
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:37,733
[Steve]
Pablo and his lawyers went on the offense,

590
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,110
trying to smear Lara with accusations.

591
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:43,256
[Pablo speaking Spanish] I am not looking
for, nor do I long for a confrontation

592
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,406
before the Colombian people.

593
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:47,993
I look for peace,
I have always preached peace,

594
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:51,997
and have longed for peace and
the prosperity of the Colombian people.

595
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:55,626
[Lara] It's important to realize
that when members of congress

596
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:58,754
can be threatened or bought at will,

597
00:38:58,921 --> 00:39:03,300
we see with clarity the real dimension
of the drug problem here in Colombia.

598
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,052
[Steve]
But Lara wouldn't back down.

599
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:07,638
He denounced narcos at every opportunity,

600
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:10,641
going after the guys
that we hadn't been able to touch.

601
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:14,061
He revealed that six
of the country's nine soccer teams

602
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:15,896
were owned by drug traffickers.

603
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:21,401
Gacha the Mexican was forced
to give up ownership of his team,

604
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:23,987
aptly nicknamed "the millionaires."

605
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:29,243
Lara denied flying permits
for 57 planes in the ochoa fleet.

606
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,624
He even fined Pablo
for illegal importation

607
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:37,459
of elephants and camels from Africa.

608
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:42,089
And with the action of one brave man,

609
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:45,217
Pablo knew his dream
of presidency was over.

610
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,529
[Lara speaking Spanish]
What are required are honest men,

611
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:52,224
men who are able to put themselves
up against drug traffickers,

612
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:59,189
who with complete tranquility buy or kill
any person or government institution

613
00:39:59,273 --> 00:40:01,066
who is against their interests.

614
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:05,070
[Steve] Rodrigo Lara became the most
important political figure in Colombia

615
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,197
with his stand against the narcos.

616
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:09,741
He just wouldn't stop going after them.

617
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:14,580
His bravery in the face of danger made him
the most wanted man in the country.

618
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:18,959
For his own safety, he was appointed
Colombian ambassador to czechoslovakia.

619
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:23,589
He was slated to leave in two weeks,
but a lot could happen in two weeks.

620
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:27,467
I think it might be a good idea
for you to wear this until you leave.

621
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:31,471
You feel responsible, is that it?

622
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:34,433
Somewhat, yes, sir.

623
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:39,646
Are you so arrogant to think
you had any influence over my actions?

624
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:43,775
That I put my life
and the life of my family at risk

625
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:46,069
for American policy objectives?

626
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:50,866
Let me assure you, agent Murphy,
outside of providing me with the picture,

627
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,618
you... did nothing.

628
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:56,997
The decision to speak out
was solely mine.

629
00:40:57,164 --> 00:41:00,000
And I highly advise you
to wear this vest, sir.

630
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:16,099
I will accept this vest... out of respect
for your concern with my well-being.

631
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:19,353
But I would advise you one thing
while you remain in Colombia.

632
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:20,771
And what is that?

633
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:25,192
We accept your help,
but never your condescension.

634
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:30,322
When all this is over, Colombians
will be the heroes, and the victims.

635
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:34,743
John Wayne only exists in Hollywood.

636
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:37,120
Just wear the vest.

637
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,219
[Speaking Spanish] Oh, pablito.

638
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:55,097
We knew they wouldn't
accept you in that circle.

639
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,018
Damned bastards.

640
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:08,819
You're too good for them, pablito.

641
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:22,666
[Sighs]

642
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:34,636
This is a fight
that you cannot win, cousin.

643
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:40,434
You need to think more
about your family and the business...

644
00:42:43,145 --> 00:42:45,480
And abandon that ridiculousness
once and for all.

645
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,571
I will fix it.

646
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:07,794
Due to the vicious lies
and slander cast my way

647
00:43:07,878 --> 00:43:11,173
by minister Lara and his cronies,

648
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:14,885
I've decided to announce my resignation
from congress of the republic.

649
00:43:17,137 --> 00:43:20,557
I ran as a representative
for the common man,

650
00:43:20,724 --> 00:43:23,518
a voice for those who had no voice,

651
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:26,980
but that has happened
through much of our history.

652
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:31,318
The powerful have conspired to silence me.

653
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:33,862
I dreamt of doing good.

654
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:37,365
Those dreams are over.

655
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:44,289
But make no mistake...
I will not go quietly.

656
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,666
I will fight.

657
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:50,003
"The men of always" are mistaken

658
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:54,382
if they think they can defeat
Pablo Emilio Escobar gaviria!

659
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:06,728
Thank you very much.

660
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,732
- Thank you very much.
- [Applause continues]

661
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,779
- [Low conversations]
- [Indistinct radio chatter]

662
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:35,924
He didn't wear it.

663
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:38,677
[Sighs]

664
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,720
Wouldn't have made a difference.

665
00:44:41,388 --> 00:44:44,641
[Steve]
Our strategy had gotten a good man killed.

666
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:49,312
It was the first time
I'd felt guilty about my job.

667
00:44:50,814 --> 00:44:54,067
- [Chatter in Spanish]
- [Men cheering]

668
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,069
- [Steve] As for Suarez...
- Hey.

669
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:58,572
He made so much money
playing both sides,

670
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:03,994
he decided to lift our spirits by giving
the DEA a token of his appreciation.

671
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:08,415
[Speaking Spanish]
I brought this for your friend's wife.

672
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,210
- I hope she likes it.
- No, gracias.

673
00:45:12,294 --> 00:45:14,212
[Speaks Spanish]
You're fucking crazy, asshole.

674
00:45:14,296 --> 00:45:15,797
[Yowls]

675
00:45:16,006 --> 00:45:19,384
