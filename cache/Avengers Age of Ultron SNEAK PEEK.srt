1
00:00:01,937 --> 00:00:04,435
"Whosoever, be he worthy,
shall have the pow..."

2
00:00:04,685 --> 00:00:06,256
Whatever, man, it's a trick.

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,856
It is much more than that, my friend.

4
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,970
- If I lift it, do I get to rule Asgard?
- Yes, of course.

5
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,118
I will be fair but firmly cruel.

6
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:17,851
Be right back.

7
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,789
- Are you even pulling?
- Are you on my team?

8
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,153
- Just represent, pull!
- Alright, let's go.

9
00:00:28,354 --> 00:00:29,446
Come on, Cap.

10
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:35,160
Nothing.

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,954
Oh, no, no.
That's not a question I need answered.

12
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:39,289
The handle's imprinted.

13
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:42,765
"Whosoever carries Thor's fingerprints"
is, I think, the literal translation.

14
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:45,253
Yes, that's a
very interesting theory.

15
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:47,089
I have a simpler one:

16
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:50,008
You're all not worthy.

17
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,029
How could you be worthy?

18
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,272
You're all puppets tangled in...

19
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,275
strings.

20
00:01:09,015 --> 00:01:09,903
Strings.

21
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,139
It's the end.

22
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,225
The end of the path I started us on.

23
00:01:41,107 --> 00:01:42,310
Nothing lasts forever.

24
00:02:09,385 --> 00:02:10,130
But now

25
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,382
I'm free.

26
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,639
There are

27
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:23,309
no strings on me.

28
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:30,309
