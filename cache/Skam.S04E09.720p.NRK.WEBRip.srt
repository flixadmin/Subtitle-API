1
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,720
Sana! Sana!

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,100
What the fuck ?!

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,900
I like Yousef. When I realized
that there was something between you...

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,780
No! There is nothing between us!

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,620
There is something I need to tell you.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,400
And please do not get angry.

7
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,160
Thanks for the mail.

8
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,780
Welcome to voice mail from Telenor.

9
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,900
Leave a message
after the beep.

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,560
Noora, please call me.

11
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,660
-Hello?
-Eskild? Is Noora home?

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,960
It's Sana.

13
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,900
Oh my God, they’re just in William’s penthouse to fuck.

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,140
She’ll be back when she’s newly fucked, my generous, little girl.

15
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,780
-I think they went to London.
-Yeah you think they went to London, but you also thought ...

16
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:39,400
... Grunde was going to win Paradise, 
so you have bad judgement, Linn. 
Have some manners.

17
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,940
I’m just a little worried she’s mad at me.

18
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:51,480
She didn’t look very mad when she went off in that 
3 million kroner Aston Martin. 3 million is a lot of money.

19
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,420
I sent an email to William.

20
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,620
E-mail? It’s been a while since I’ve written one of those.

21
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,260
Yes, but I sent it from Noora’s account.

22
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,940
You sent an email from Noora's account
to William? Ok, what did you write?

23
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,500
Eh...
I just wrote ...

24
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,780
"I love you and if
you love me, come to Oslo."

25
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,500
That's what made him
come? An email ?!

26
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,060
Why didn't you think to do that
before ?! You write e-mails all the time.

27
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,960
You’re a grown up, Linn. Is that what it took?

28
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:37,400
She’s been stomping around in this self-pitying heartache for 8 months and then all it took was an e-mail?

29
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,180
You shouldn’t feel bad about that, that was well done. 


30
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,060
I'm really a bit proud of you.

31
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,520
High five!

32
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:03,080
But I didn't
really do it for Noora's sake.

33
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,740
I did it because ...

34
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,240
she was with a guy I like.

35
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,220
-Which guy?
-Just a guy called Yousef.

36
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,180
Yousef? Isn’t that the guy you were 
trying to pick up last night?

37
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,700
Once I sent a used tampon ...

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
... to a girl who made out with my ex.

39
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,300
-Have you had a boyfriend ?!
-Yes, in 7th grade.

40
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,280
-That was the first and last one?
-Yes.

41
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,340
But now we’re talking about Sana, Linn.
We can talk about you later.

42
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,900
Right now we’re talking about 
Sana and the cute Muslim boy.

43
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,620
-He's not a Muslim.
-He's not?

44
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,740
Ok ...

45
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,240
Hm.

46
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,660
-Do you want some guru-advising?
-What's that?

47
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,060
I was with this guy, a year ago, a very good relationship 
... the best I’ve ever had.

48
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,580
It was a Turkish ambassador's son.
His name was Lito. You remember him?

49
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,700
He was really cool. Went to Blinder'n ...

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,140
was concerned with human rights,
Sensitive soul, shared a lot about himself.

51
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,260
the most well-shaped cock I’ve ever touched.

52
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,260
He was also a Muslim.
and not that I'm religious, or anything,
because I'm not ...

53
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,140
- but I have browsed the Bible
a couple of times ...

54
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,380
... there it says that the most 
important thing is love.

55
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,580
Or "Love on Top," as Beyoncé says.
So I think what would Jesus and Mohammed do?

56
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,180
And that would be "let the love flow."

57
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:54,420
So we tried that. Love on Top. I was the
top. You know, you know about that
because you heard it.

58
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,060
So we did that lots of times. Then we began 
to talk about other things, important things.

59
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,920
Grown up things like life and humanity 
and stuff and we disagreed a lot.

60
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,920
So the conclusion is that relationships 
between religious and non-religious people are difficult.

61
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,960
I cried a lot.

62
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:31,540
Aren’t there some other hotties in that gang?

63
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,020
That Elias, isn’t he cute?

64
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,740
-He's my brother!
-That's ... yes, that's your brother.

65
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:45,620
That won’t work. That would be weird.

66
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,620
Which religion would you follow? 
Buddhism or something?

67
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,380
-Bahá'í, maybe?
-Bahá'í, maybe.

68
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,760
Now I've become a bit inspired to research 
and stuff online. What are you doing today?

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
(No, I still haven’t heard anything…. And you?
-No, have you made Chris call William?
-William isn’t answering either….
-But think about it, they’ve been apart for a very 
long time, they’re probably just chilling, and 
don’t give a fuck about anyone else)

70
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,800
(Boys in the yard)

71
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,980
-Come on then! Throw!
-Guys, guys, listen now!

72
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,280
Okay.

73
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,840
(BALLOON BOYS TALKING AND YELLING ABOUT THE GAME)

74
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,060
Try then, Elias

75
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,480
I'm so bad at this!

76
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,260
Throw, then!

77
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,220
-There, yes!
-Good throw!

78
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,420
Hey!

79
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,500
-What's up, Sana?
-Join us!

80
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,440
We're in the middle of a tournament!
She can join later.

81
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,940
Mikael, your turn.

82
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,660
Two against two, it's over.

83
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,620
-You throw it, and then...
-Bad! Bro, go home.

84
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,000
The two of you against the two of us.

85
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,180
Hey.

86
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,080
Hey.

87
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,380
Did you have a nice time at Eva’s birthday party?

88
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,560
Yes! It was very fun.

89
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,520
And you?

90
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,400
It was fun
The gift she got was pretty awesome.

91
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,700
Eskild just popping the champagne bottle and stuff. 
It wasn’t even his gift.

92
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,900
-He didn’t even bring one
He’s awesome.

93
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,720
Yeah.

94
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,360
And Even. It was good to see him again, at least.

95
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,260
Guys, it’s the third time we’ve beat you.

96
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,860
so please, just put up a bit of a fight.

97
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,780
I thought of something. We have to break 
the fast together tonight.

98
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,780
-With some delicious food.
-Balkan! Balkan Kebab.

99
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,280
No, bro, Istanbul, right?

100
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:02,540
-But we have to do it before Yousef leaves.
-Yousef? When are you leaving?

101
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,740
- I talked to Noora.
-Yousef! When are you leaving?

102
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,340
- Saturday.
-Saturday?
-Done. We eat together on friday

103
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,820
-No!
-Why not? Relax. We’ll eat on Friday.

104
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,580
Friday is better.
We can chill all night.

105
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,380
-I can't on Friday.
-What are you doing on Friday?

106
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,900
Where... where are you going?

107
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,860
I’m going to Turkey.

108
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,160
Oh yes?

109
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,440
Will you be gone long?

110
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,820
-No, Thursday is better guys.
-We have one last night with him.

111
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,320
So should I just ditch the dude?
-Let him join.
-Yousef, it's your turn.

112
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,020
-???.
-Why am I always the one who has to switch?

113
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,220
Guys, I’m missing a stick, give me one.

114
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,020
-Okay, Mutta, which one should I hit?
-Hit this one.

115
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,500
-Great.
-If you hit it, you’re good.

116
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,220
You see? Lovely.

117
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,720
-Therefore he is on my team!
-It’s beginner’s luck, man.

118
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,300
If you hit it once, you’re the king.

119
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,740
If you hit it now, you win the whole thing.

120
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,420
It's the first time you play,
so it's okay.

121
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,320
-It’s always Elias and me, man.
-It's always me and Yousef.

122
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,680
(Message Sound)

123
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,700
Let’s play another round, guys.
Another round? Okay, one more.

124
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,580
If I hit it now...

125
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,820
Then we eat at Balkans.

126
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,220
We won.

127
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,100
-Ahhh,done!
-You said that one.That one.
-Yeah that one too.

128
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,400
Come on bro, throw it, then!

129
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,900
I don’t think you should be worried. I’m sure it’s fine.

130
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,560
Yes ... I just have a bad feeling in my tummy.

131
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,820
-What’s that supposed to mean?
-I think there's something wrong.

132
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,300
Something wrong ?!

133
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,220
-How do you know that?
-Hey, should we contact the police?

134
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,700
-What if he has killed her?
-He hasn’t killed her.

135
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,780
We can’t know that for sure.
He has shown violent tendencies in the past.

136
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:28,700
his brother is a psychopath. We don’t know if William
is or not - those things are genetic.

137
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,220
Oh my God.. They’re fucking!

138
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,180
Stop nagging!

139
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,220
-For four days?!
-Yeah.

140
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:43,000
- Without making a sound?
-Well I don’t know, I haven’t been listening
to them.

141
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,880
Hey.

142
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,680
Fucking hell, William’s car is so cheesy.

143
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,940
Shocking!

144
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,240
She's alive!

145
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,180
Hi!

146
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,480
-Hi!
-Hey.

147
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,000
Eh ... William?

148
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,560
I have to leave.

149
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,940
It's ...

150
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,780
It's just that ... Ok because...

151
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,440
We only... I just feel...

152
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,340
I just feel...
Now I feel that...

153
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,780
That we have talked about everything.

154
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,060
At ...

155
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,100
That we only... He just opened up completely.

156
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,020
Do you understand what I mean? And...

157
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:11,360
I didn't know what I was doing before, 
but I know what and how he thinks now. 

158
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,140
Sana Bakkoush,
this is the best thing you've ever done!

159
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,440
Thank you!

160
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,400
But hey! Oh my God, how did it go with Yousef?

161
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,040
I do not know completely ...

162
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,000
But you talked, right?

163
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,980
I ... yes, or ...

164
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,060
I tried talking to him.

165
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,620
Eh ...

166
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,920
But ...

167
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:16,800
He’s going to Turkey and he’s staying all summer ...

168
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,220
... and he's not a Muslim, and ...

169
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,380
But you have to talk to him!

170
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,340
Just talk to him before he leaves!
Send him a text! Now!

171
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,100
Eh... I don't have his number.

172
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,980
Then write to him on Facebook.

173
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,600
-We are not friends on Facebook.
-Oh my God, Sana! Add him then!

174
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,580
Now!

175
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,560
Seriously! Come on!

176
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,940
Yes ... And then you write:

177
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,280
“Do you want to hang out with me?”

178
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,340
Sana! I swear I’ll log onto your account and write it myself ...

179
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,760
... and hit "send." I'm not kidding, you know that.

180
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,600
Ok ...

181
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,200
Yeeeah! Good!

182
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,340
Oh my God!
That wasn’t so hard, was it?

183
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,380
You know what ...

184
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,680
Now life is smiling

185
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,940
Now we can do anything we want!
And I suggest...

186
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,800
That we skip!

187
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,700
Are you in?

188
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,980
Yeah, but I think we already are
(skipping).

189
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,020
Class started a long time ago.

190
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,240
Is that true?

191
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,620
Oh my God. Yeah, well, then that’s it.

192
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,580
I thought it would be ...

193
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,820
a bit more difficult. But it feels very natural.

194
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,100
Maybe because we’ve been good all year.
Summer vacation starts soon.

195
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,980
Yes, now we’ll just go and hide, and wait for the summer.

196
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,220
-What if he doesn't answer?
-No! Everything is falling into place now, Sana.

197
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,700
Look, then!

198
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yes, it is. 

199
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,700
-This is me and Noora at a café.
-Red lipstick?

200
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,300
- She’s always wearing red lipstick.
-Yeah? It suits her.

201
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,300
Yes, it suits her very well. And here 
she’s also wearing red lipstick.

202
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,140
And this is at school

203
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,340
- She's very pretty girl.
-She's very pretty.

204
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,900
-And this is Chris.
-She looks like a lot of fun.

205
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,860
Yes, she's awesome.

206
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,600
Why don’t you invite them here?

207
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,340
-Wow.
-That's a picture of Vilde and Eva.

208
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,640
(Of course I want to hang out with you! What about Friday? I’m leaving on Saturday.Yousef Acar accepted your friend request.)

209
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,800
Aaand ...

210
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,420
This is another picture of Noora.

211
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:58,320
-What's with the sunglasses?
-It’s just this halloween party. 

212
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,080
We were ...

213
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,360
We had dressed up.

214
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,920
Nice pictures!

215
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,940
I like Yousef.

216
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,200
Mm.

217
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,560
And ...

218
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,960
He ... he is not a Muslim.

219
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,120
And now you’re going to hang out?

220
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,820
I know...
I know that Islam says that ...

221
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,960
... I can't marry him.

222
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,740
but I just ... I don’t understand that because ...

223
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,400
... Yousef is a really good person.

224
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,880
You are only 17 years old.
You are not getting married yet.

225
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,380
No, but ...

226
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,900
what about three years from now?
If I still like Yousef,

227
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,200
why can’t I marry him?

228
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,780
When you are so young,

229
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,600
You think crushes and love are the same thing.

230
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,260
Crushes pass,

231
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,560
but love and a marriage last for your whole life.

232
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,580
It's almost like a partnership.

233
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:59,240
where you give all the love inside
of you to that partnership.

234
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,780
It’s also about having someone by your side your whole life.

235
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,520
No matter what happens.

236
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:16,140
And I think that if your faith is strong
you’ll get a bit lonely in that relationship,

237
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,440
... if you’re the only one who believes.

238
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,840
Because there are always times in your life 
where you doubt everything. Even God.

239
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:36,740
And then I think it's important that you
have have someone by your side ... 

240
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,640
... who reminds you why you’re a Muslim 

241
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,480
And who understands what you believe in.

242
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,200
Do you understand what I'm saying?

243
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,200
(Phone ringing)

244
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,520
It will be fine. Hello?

245
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,160
(Yousef-Of course I want to hang out with you! What about Friday? 
I’m leaving on Saturday.
Sana-Oh are you leaving this Saturday? I can’t this week.
I hope you have the world’s best summer. 
Chris-Yo girls. What about test driving the van this Friday? 
I know it’s not Russ Time 2018 yet, but a little trip has to be fine?
VILDE-YEEEES!!!)

246
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,220
Please accept my fast ...

247
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,860
... even though I've behaved badly.

248
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:17,700
Please watch over Eva and Vilde ...

249
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,380
... and Noora.
And Chris.

250
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,120
Please watch over Isak and Even.

251
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,880
And Elias.

252
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,040
And Yousef.

253
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,080
(Music Outside)

254
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,840
(Message Sound)

255
00:29:17,640 --> 00:30:27,800
(VILDE-Hi, are you ready to meet up?
EVA-Sana! Chris and I will pick you up with the van in 20 minutes.
SANA-Ok cool
SANA-I regret cancelling the date with Yousef
NOORA-YEEES! Call him! Go!
EVA-Do it girl!! Life is NOW!!
SANA-According to Islam, life is after death. Which is one of the reasons why I should stay away from him
CHRIS-According to me, the pudenda is dead after death. Which is one of the reasons why you should meet him!!
VILDE-Yousef! Yousef! Yousef!
SANA-Hahaha I get why mom is worried that I don’t have any Muslim friends
NOORA-Hello! OK!! I can argue from an Islamic perspective
SANA-Now I’m intrigued
NOORA-Ok, doesn’t Islam believe in destiny?
SANA-Yes.
NOORA-So if you believe in destiny, and you believe Allah is almighty, there has to be a reason why Yousef became a part of your life? It’s not necessarily because you should be together, maybe it’s something else, but you won’t find out if you avoid him?!?!?!
CHRIS-Wow that shit is deep.
SANA-You’re right
NOORA-Oh yeah bitches, I got a 6 in religion.
VILDE-But Noora it IS because they’re going to be together.
NOORA-Okay, they’re going to be together
SANA-Thanks)

256
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,900
Hey?

257
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,300
-Hi.
-Hey.

258
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,900
I was just wondering ...

259
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,380
What you’re doing right now?

260
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,440
Nothing special, really.

261
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,340
Um ...

262
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,840
I  was just wondering ...

263
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,660
... if you still wanted to meet up?

264
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,320
Oh, shit...

265
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,900
Sorry, umm ...

266
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,200
I’ve made other plans.

267
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,060
Oh okay.

268
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,020
Yes yes.

269
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,400
I understand that.

270
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,820
I'm joking! Of course we can meet up!

271
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,100
When do you want me to meet you?

272
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,240
Where? I’ll meet you wherever you’d like.

273
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,120
Don't want to?

274
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,180
(Talking while Cezinando - Vi er perfekt, men verden er ikke det plays)

275
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,260
Ouch!
I got it in my eye!

276
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,860
Oi!

277
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,400
Why didn’t you tell me? That sucks!

278
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,780
It could’ve bit my finger, you know. 
I’m so scared!

279
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,820
I’m terrified of those.

280
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,740
It was just suddenly there

281
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,660
Right now I'm actually really scared.

282
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,240
I'm just tough next to you.

283
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,540
- Oh look, there’s a spider here, Sana!
-Where?

284
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,780
Okay, I’m gonna see if you trust me.
Just stand here.

285
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,740
I'm waiting.
It's wet here!

286
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,460
-If I trust you?
-Yeah, come on. Stand there,

287
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,460
It's a test of whether you
trust me or not.

288
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,160
Don't you trust me?

289
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,160
Hello, if I ...

290
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,420
I’m standing here! Look!

291
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:53,180
Listen. This is an even better game. I’m gonna be 
like this and you’ll stand there for at least 10 seconds.

292
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,820
Come on.
I’ll count out loud

293
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,700
I promise, I’ll count out loud. Stand there.

294
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,660
You’re looking at me now!

295
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,780
-Come on.
-Then you also have to.

296
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,780
Ok, we can stand together then.

297
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:14,460
Look. I’m standing here. I dared to. Come on.

298
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,140
I’m not doing anything. There’s no stress. Now it’s your turn.  

299
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,720
It's about trusting...

300
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,100
-’m standing here!
-I can tell you’re standing there! Okay, fine.

301
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,620
-Yeah, 10 seconds.
-One, two, three ... Look! I trust you!

302
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,340
You’re supposed to stand here!

303
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:38,460
-Don’t you trust me?
-I do. Come on!

304
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,620
Press it, Press it! Come on!

305
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,900
What are you going to do? You're bad.

306
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,980
It doesn't help.

307
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,000
-Okay, we trust each other.
-Yes, we do.

308
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,580
-How long?
-Ten seconds.

309
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,620
Ten, nine, eight ...

310
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,700
seven, six ...

311
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,620
five, four ...

312
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,220
three, two, and ...

313
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:17,040
Boom!

314
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,400
That was a sick remix, wasn’t it?

315
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,880
That's enough, Sana. Hero.

316
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,300
Was it good?

317
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,600
Really good.

318
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,940
-Are you hungry?
-Yeah, I’m super hungry.

319
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,980
I think we have to buy some food.

320
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,940
Don’t you think I brought food?

321
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,020
-You brought food?
-Of course I brought food!

322
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:14,680
I’m not going on a date with a girl who’s been 
fasting for 19 hours without bringing food.

323
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,060
Don’t make me throw you into the water! 
Seriously! Of course I brought food.

324
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,100
I am, afterall, Yousef!
-Awww ...

325
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,020
Don’t ‘awwww’ me. I get really embarrassed, seriously.

326
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,400
- I can’t even look at you now.
-That's what the backpack is for!

327
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,880
MMM. Did you make this?

328
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,300
No. I wish it was me.

329
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:50,120
But it’s not. It was my mom.

330
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:59,060
-What’s in this?
-It's a secret recipe.

331
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,460
Mom made it.
It’s this amazing recipe.

332
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,580
Think it's
bit too complicated for you.

333
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,980
Why?

334
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,140
Because the recipe says you have to be able to peel carrots the right way.

335
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,640
I don’t think you’re the right person for that.

336
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,080
Ok ...

337
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,940
It was really nice of you to bring soup, though.

338
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:34,440
See? I can be a good person even 
though I'm not fasting.

339
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,040
I have not been a good
person during this fast.

340
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,800
No?

341
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,440
I’ve behaved really shitty.

342
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,360
There’s still a week left of Ramadan.

343
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,660
You can spend this week making up for it.

344
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,960
True.

345
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,040
I was actually bullied in middle school.

346
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:54,140
So every time I experience something like that, I just ...

347
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,600
... I don’t know. Black out.

348
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,900
But I'm trying to practice ...

349
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,060
... thinking that people don't
have prejudices against Islam.

350
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,200
But it’s pretty difficult.

351
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:33,520
Even you think that
religion divides society.

352
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,920
To be completely honest,

353
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,300
I think society would be split ...

354
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,740
... even if religion didn’t exist.

355
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,480
-You think so?
-Yes.

356
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,900
For example ...

357
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,980
when you get into a revue party ...

358
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,940
The first thing you look for,
is people you know,

359
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,720
... so you won’t be there on your own ...

360
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,040
I think the whole world is like that.

361
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,260
You think of the whole world as a big revue party?

362
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:32,100
Yes. On one side, there are the gangsters
from the ‘Sound and Equipment’ group ...

363
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,940
... who talk shit about the preps who form the 
‘PR’ group on the other side of the room.

364
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:45,500
And everyone agrees that their group is the 
best and that their pre-parties are the best.

365
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,760
But in reality, everyone is all the same.

366
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,280
Everyone thinks they’re the good guys.

367
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,140
but in reality, there’s no such thing as good or bad.

368
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,420
There are just lots of people trying to stand together in groups ...

369
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,760
... to not be alone.

370
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,940
So you're saying that ...

371
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,360
All people are the same?

372
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,820
Yes.

373
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:30,960
Scientifically, people are totally different.

374
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:39,320
Maybe that's why society needs religion, then.

375
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,900
Democracy is not built on the idea
that all people are different.

376
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:52,280
It is based on the idea that
all people are equally worthwhile.

377
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,440
That idea does not come
from science.

378
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,820
But I do not know if it helps
to pretend that ...

379
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,320
... prejudices don't exist.

380
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,840
What you have to do,
is show what Islam is.

381
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,880
You're really a Muslim, aren't you?
You just say you're not.

382
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,000
Unfortunately, I'm not.

383
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:01,040
But how can you be entirely sure that you don’t believe in God?

384
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,580
I do not feel what you feel.

385
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,920
But I don’t feel like that all the time.

386
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,340
I doubt sometimes.

387
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,840
Yes, but you believe in God.

388
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,300
How can you know for sure?

389
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,380
No, I do not know.

390
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:32,040
But should I tell you something awesome?

391
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:38,020
Did you know that...

392
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:42,820
Inside the heads of cockroaches there are
nine different amino acids ...

393
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:48,760
- that are stronger than
any medicine we have today.

394
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,300
-Amino acids?
-Yes? Isn’t that what the fuck they're called?

395
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,700
-Aren't they amino acids?
-Antibiotic molecules.

396
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,660
Wow. Really?

397
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,260
Like okay, okay.

398
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,500
I'm trying to save religion here,

399
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,600
And you’re spending your time dissing me?

400
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:25,100
You got my point, though? Do you think
that all this is completely random?

401
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,440
Yes or no?

402
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,440
-No.
-No. Exactly.

403
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,220
But if you ever stop believing in god,

404
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,320
- Then you are welcome in my religion.

405
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,800
The big revue party religion.

406
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,440
I don't really know.

407
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:14,540
Is it okay to marry non-religious people in your religion?

408
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,920
Yes, it's totally chill.

409
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:26,400
I wish it was chill in my religion too.

410
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:34,040
Why? Are you going to marry
a non-believing man?

411
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,740
Yes, maybe?

412
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,220
Who?

413
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,860
Stephen Curry.

414
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,420
Wow. Big man.

415
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,860
-We’re going to make a basketball team together.
-What will you call it?

416
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,340
Six children then, maybe?

417
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,440
Yes.

418
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,320
Ok.

419
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,660
When are you leaving tomorrow?

420
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,960
Tomorrow morning.

421
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,840
But I'll be back.

422
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:39,560
When you're over Stephen Curry.

423
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,720
Ok!
