1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I am the fastest man alive.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
In an attempt to stop the
evil speedster Savitar,

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I was accidentally
thrust into the future,

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I saw him murder
the woman that I love.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
But I won't let that happen.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I'm gonna do everything in
my power to change the future,

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I'm the only one fast
enough to keep her alive.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,505
I am The Flash.

24
00:00:00,515 --> 00:00:00,507
&nbsp

25
00:00:00,517 --> 00:00:02,607
Previously on "The Flash"...

26
00:00:02,617 --> 00:00:02,609
&nbsp

27
00:00:02,619 --> 00:00:05,365
It's definitely a meta. I
think this is someone new.

28
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:06,846
&nbsp

29
00:00:06,856 --> 00:00:08,780
I'm Cisco, by the
way. You must be Gypsy.

30
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:08,805
&nbsp

31
00:00:08,815 --> 00:00:11,050
- So is this good-bye, then?
- For now.

32
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:11,277
&nbsp

33
00:00:11,287 --> 00:00:13,206
Caitlin, you do not want to do this.

34
00:00:13,216 --> 00:00:13,231
&nbsp

35
00:00:13,241 --> 00:00:15,486
Time for me to own who I really am.

36
00:00:15,496 --> 00:00:15,511
&nbsp

37
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:17,077
You're one of the strongest
people I've ever known.

38
00:00:17,087 --> 00:00:17,102
&nbsp

39
00:00:17,112 --> 00:00:19,409
You can win this fight.

40
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:19,682
&nbsp

41
00:00:19,692 --> 00:00:21,222
- Jesse!
- No, no.

42
00:00:21,232 --> 00:00:21,238
&nbsp

43
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,804
- What's wrong?
- Grodd.

44
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:22,806
&nbsp

45
00:00:22,816 --> 00:00:24,444
He's got my dad.

46
00:00:24,454 --> 00:00:24,475
&nbsp

47
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:26,842
He has him in Gorilla City.

48
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:28,313
&nbsp

49
00:00:28,323 --> 00:00:29,960

&nbsp

53
00:00:53,651 --> 00:00:55,049
It's been two weeks
since he disappeared.

54
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:55,096
&nbsp

55
00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:57,096
I mean, no one's seen
or heard from him since.

56
00:00:57,106 --> 00:00:57,098
&nbsp

57
00:00:57,108 --> 00:00:59,098
Slow down. Just start
from the beginning.

58
00:00:59,108 --> 00:00:59,100
&nbsp

59
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,701
Okay, why did your
dad go to Gorilla City?

60
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:01,703
&nbsp

61
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:03,090
Wait, can we slow down even further?

62
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,115
&nbsp

63
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,807
What the hell is a Gorilla City?

64
00:01:04,817 --> 00:01:04,832
&nbsp

65
00:01:04,842 --> 00:01:06,272
Okay, so...

66
00:01:06,282 --> 00:01:06,274
&nbsp

67
00:01:06,284 --> 00:01:08,841
there are sentient, highly intelligent

68
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:08,843
&nbsp

69
00:01:08,853 --> 00:01:10,510
evolved gorillas in Earth-2.

70
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:10,512
&nbsp

71
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:13,246
And they all live in a city
deep in the heart of Africa.

72
00:01:13,256 --> 00:01:13,248
&nbsp

73
00:01:13,258 --> 00:01:15,515
We sent Grodd there when
he went after Fay Wray here.

74
00:01:15,525 --> 00:01:15,517
&nbsp

75
00:01:15,527 --> 00:01:16,846
- Grodd's there?
- Mm.

76
00:01:16,856 --> 00:01:16,871
&nbsp

77
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:19,386
Why on Earth, any Earth, would
your father want to go there?

78
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:19,412
&nbsp

79
00:01:19,422 --> 00:01:21,312
I mean, we received a
mathematical cryptogram

80
00:01:21,322 --> 00:01:21,314
&nbsp

81
00:01:21,324 --> 00:01:22,458
at our S.T.A.R. Labs.

82
00:01:22,468 --> 00:01:22,483
&nbsp

83
00:01:22,493 --> 00:01:23,623
It was highly complex.

84
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:23,648
&nbsp

85
00:01:23,658 --> 00:01:26,327
It took a week to decode
it, but my dad and I did.

86
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:26,352
&nbsp

87
00:01:26,362 --> 00:01:27,785
What did it say?

88
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:27,787
&nbsp

89
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:29,887
It was an invitation...

90
00:01:29,897 --> 00:01:29,889
&nbsp

91
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:32,139
from the gorillas to my dad.

92
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:32,164
&nbsp

93
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:33,624
Why Harry?

94
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:33,626
&nbsp

95
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:35,192
They wanted to meet him.

96
00:01:35,202 --> 00:01:35,194
&nbsp

97
00:01:35,204 --> 00:01:38,186
So he mounted an expedition
with ten other people,

98
00:01:38,196 --> 00:01:38,211
&nbsp

99
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:40,007
and they went into the jungle.

100
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:40,032
&nbsp

101
00:01:40,042 --> 00:01:41,932
But they failed multiple check-ins,

102
00:01:41,942 --> 00:01:41,934
&nbsp

103
00:01:41,944 --> 00:01:44,630
and a search party went in after them.

104
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:44,655
&nbsp

105
00:01:44,665 --> 00:01:46,982
But all they found were the bodies...

106
00:01:46,992 --> 00:01:47,007
&nbsp

107
00:01:47,017 --> 00:01:48,939
all of them beaten to death.

108
00:01:48,949 --> 00:01:51,677
&nbsp

109
00:01:51,687 --> 00:01:53,577
But no one's seen my dad.

110
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:55,706
&nbsp

111
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,806
- I mean, is he...
- No.

112
00:01:57,816 --> 00:01:57,831
&nbsp

113
00:01:57,841 --> 00:01:59,917
No, he's alive. They...

114
00:01:59,927 --> 00:01:59,919
&nbsp

115
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:01,819
they went to a lot of
trouble to get him there.

116
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:01,821
&nbsp

117
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:03,187
They need him for something.

118
00:02:03,197 --> 00:02:03,189
&nbsp

119
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:05,022
We're gonna figure out what that is.

120
00:02:05,032 --> 00:02:05,024
&nbsp

121
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:07,292
Oh! There you guys are.

122
00:02:07,302 --> 00:02:07,317
&nbsp

123
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:10,181
I've been looking all over for you.
Are we going for coffee or what?

124
00:02:10,191 --> 00:02:10,206
&nbsp

125
00:02:10,216 --> 00:02:12,893
- Dad!
- Ah, oh.

126
00:02:12,903 --> 00:02:12,918
&nbsp

127
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:16,400
Yes, that's how you say
good morning, people...

128
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:16,402
&nbsp

129
00:02:16,412 --> 00:02:17,799
with hugs. Hi!

130
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:17,824
&nbsp

131
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:20,104
Jesse, that's not who you think it is.

132
00:02:20,114 --> 00:02:20,106
&nbsp

133
00:02:20,116 --> 00:02:21,772
This is H.R.

134
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:21,774
&nbsp

135
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:24,065
You met him briefly
before you left last time.

136
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:24,090
&nbsp

137
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,643
At your service, madame.

138
00:02:25,653 --> 00:02:25,645
&nbsp

139
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:27,088
He's Harry's replacement.

140
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:27,135
&nbsp

141
00:02:27,145 --> 00:02:28,568
Some would say improvement.

142
00:02:28,578 --> 00:02:28,570
&nbsp

143
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,737
Um, this is Harry's daughter.

144
00:02:30,747 --> 00:02:30,739
&nbsp

145
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:32,739
- Yeah.
- He's been kidnapped.

146
00:02:32,749 --> 00:02:32,741
&nbsp

147
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:34,707
He... I didn't know. I'm so s...

148
00:02:34,717 --> 00:02:34,709
&nbsp

149
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,505
- I thought...
- Sorry about that.

150
00:02:36,515 --> 00:02:36,530
&nbsp

151
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,529
I'm sorry, too.

152
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:37,554
&nbsp

153
00:02:37,564 --> 00:02:39,685
I'm sorry I took the
smile from your face.

154
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:43,785
&nbsp

155
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:45,652
What are you thinking about?

156
00:02:45,662 --> 00:02:47,219
&nbsp

157
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:48,788
The future.

158
00:02:48,798 --> 00:02:49,476
&nbsp

159
00:02:49,486 --> 00:02:51,190
This headline from the future:

160
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,192
&nbsp

161
00:02:51,202 --> 00:02:53,259
the city's still recovering
from a gorilla attack.

162
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:53,261
&nbsp

163
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:54,694
So you're thinking this headline

164
00:02:54,704 --> 00:02:54,696
&nbsp

165
00:02:54,706 --> 00:02:57,063
and Harry being taken are tied together.

166
00:02:57,073 --> 00:02:57,065
&nbsp

167
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:59,465
I mean, it can't be
a coincidence, right?

168
00:02:59,475 --> 00:02:59,467
&nbsp

169
00:02:59,477 --> 00:03:01,330
Harry getting lured to Gorilla City?

170
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:01,355
&nbsp

171
00:03:01,365 --> 00:03:02,936
Grodd must be planning something.

172
00:03:02,946 --> 00:03:02,938
&nbsp

173
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:05,071
Seems like he's planning
to come back to this Earth.

174
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:05,073
&nbsp

175
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,773
And not alone, by the sound of it.

176
00:03:06,783 --> 00:03:06,775
&nbsp

177
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:08,808
If we rescue Harry,
then maybe that stops

178
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:08,810
&nbsp

179
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,076
whatever Grodd's planning here,

180
00:03:10,086 --> 00:03:10,078
&nbsp

181
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:11,644
and maybe that changes the future.

182
00:03:11,654 --> 00:03:11,646
&nbsp

183
00:03:11,656 --> 00:03:14,180
- Which would change my future.
- Mm.

184
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:14,182
&nbsp

185
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:16,215
So we save Harry, we save Iris.

186
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:16,217
&nbsp

187
00:03:16,227 --> 00:03:17,483
But you're not sure.

188
00:03:17,493 --> 00:03:17,485
&nbsp

189
00:03:17,495 --> 00:03:18,952
No, but...

190
00:03:18,962 --> 00:03:18,954
&nbsp

191
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:20,569
I'm going either way.

192
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:20,594
&nbsp

193
00:03:20,604 --> 00:03:23,556
Harry's my friend. I'm
not gonna just abandon him.

194
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:23,558
&nbsp

195
00:03:23,568 --> 00:03:25,224
I'm going back to Earth-2.

196
00:03:25,234 --> 00:03:25,226
&nbsp

197
00:03:25,236 --> 00:03:27,608
And I suppose you'll want
somebody to come with you

198
00:03:27,618 --> 00:03:27,633
&nbsp

199
00:03:27,643 --> 00:03:29,566
who's gonna open those breaches for you?

200
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:29,591
&nbsp

201
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:32,165
We had so much fun last time.

202
00:03:32,175 --> 00:03:32,167
&nbsp

203
00:03:32,177 --> 00:03:33,783
Fun-ish.

204
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:33,808
&nbsp

205
00:03:33,818 --> 00:03:35,275
I'm in.

206
00:03:35,285 --> 00:03:35,470
&nbsp

207
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,803
I'm gonna come too.

208
00:03:36,813 --> 00:03:36,805
&nbsp

209
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:38,371
I have a special connection with Grodd.

210
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:38,373
&nbsp

211
00:03:38,383 --> 00:03:40,106
Maybe we can use that
to get through to him.

212
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:40,108
&nbsp

213
00:03:40,118 --> 00:03:42,789
- Yes, okay.
- Great, yeah, I'm coming too.

214
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:42,844
&nbsp

215
00:03:42,854 --> 00:03:44,444
No. I'm sorry, Jesse, no.

216
00:03:44,454 --> 00:03:44,446
&nbsp

217
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:46,546
Look, I didn't come here
for you to take all the risk.

218
00:03:46,556 --> 00:03:46,548
&nbsp

219
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:48,881
- I'm going to help.
- Your dad would kill me

220
00:03:48,891 --> 00:03:48,883
&nbsp

221
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:50,016
if I let you come along.

222
00:03:50,026 --> 00:03:50,018
&nbsp

223
00:03:50,028 --> 00:03:51,017
I'm a Speedster now, okay?

224
00:03:51,027 --> 00:03:51,019
&nbsp

225
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:52,285
I can take care of myself.

226
00:03:52,295 --> 00:03:52,287
&nbsp

227
00:03:52,297 --> 00:03:54,828
I know, which is exactly
why I need you to stay here.

228
00:03:54,838 --> 00:03:54,853
&nbsp

229
00:03:54,863 --> 00:03:58,219
I mean, this city needs
protecting while we're gone.

230
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,475
&nbsp

231
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:00,875
Besides, maybe you can
teach Wally a thing or two.

232
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:01,746
&nbsp

233
00:04:01,756 --> 00:04:03,464
Wait, what is he talking about?

234
00:04:03,474 --> 00:04:03,489
&nbsp

235
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:04,784
Um...

236
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:06,505
&nbsp

237
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:07,883
Wow.

238
00:04:07,893 --> 00:04:07,885
&nbsp

239
00:04:07,895 --> 00:04:09,552
So you're... you're a Speedster now

240
00:04:09,562 --> 00:04:09,554
&nbsp

241
00:04:09,564 --> 00:04:11,423
Yeah, we're both Speedsters now.

242
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:11,456
&nbsp

243
00:04:11,466 --> 00:04:14,282
Great, yeah, that's, uh...

244
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:14,391
&nbsp

245
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:16,188
... that's awesome.

246
00:04:16,198 --> 00:04:19,163
&nbsp

247
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:22,312
I, um... I thought she'd
be more excited than that.

248
00:04:22,322 --> 00:04:25,125
&nbsp

249
00:04:25,135 --> 00:04:28,003
Hey, Julian, would you
maybe be able to cover for me

250
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:28,005
&nbsp

251
00:04:28,015 --> 00:04:30,172
at work for the next few days?

252
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:30,174
&nbsp

253
00:04:30,184 --> 00:04:31,340
Few days? Why?

254
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,342
&nbsp

255
00:04:31,352 --> 00:04:33,787
I... I just, um, have a thing...

256
00:04:33,797 --> 00:04:33,812
&nbsp

257
00:04:33,822 --> 00:04:36,021
we're... it's just... it's Flash stuff.

258
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:36,046
&nbsp

259
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:37,490
Such as?

260
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,240
&nbsp

261
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,365
A friends of ours is
lost on a parallel Earth,

262
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:42,390
&nbsp

263
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,574
and we're gonna go get him back.

264
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:44,605
&nbsp

265
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:46,055
- A parallel Earth?
- Yeah.

266
00:04:46,065 --> 00:04:46,057
&nbsp

267
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:49,551
This is the... this is the multiverse.

268
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:51,529
&nbsp

269
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:52,963
I'm fascinated.

270
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:52,988
&nbsp

271
00:04:52,998 --> 00:04:54,797
And do you often travel to other Earths?

272
00:04:54,807 --> 00:04:54,799
&nbsp

273
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:57,032
No, I... well, when I have to.

274
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:57,034
&nbsp

275
00:04:57,044 --> 00:04:59,869
Look, Julian, will you
just tell Singh that,

276
00:04:59,879 --> 00:04:59,894
&nbsp

277
00:04:59,904 --> 00:05:01,646
I don't know, I'm under
the weather or something?

278
00:05:01,656 --> 00:05:01,648
&nbsp

279
00:05:01,658 --> 00:05:03,880
It's... you know, it is kind
of what we do on Team Flash.

280
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:03,905
&nbsp

281
00:05:03,915 --> 00:05:05,107
We cover for each other.

282
00:05:05,117 --> 00:05:05,132
&nbsp

283
00:05:05,142 --> 00:05:07,132
What does Caitlin think of
all this multiverse hopping?

284
00:05:07,142 --> 00:05:07,157
&nbsp

285
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:09,607
- Does she approve?
- She's coming with me.

286
00:05:09,617 --> 00:05:09,921
&nbsp

287
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:11,514
- You're letting her go?
- It's her choice.

288
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:11,539
&nbsp

289
00:05:11,549 --> 00:05:13,839
Allen, it's not a wise move, surely.

290
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:13,864
&nbsp

291
00:05:13,874 --> 00:05:15,864
She can barely control
her cold powers as is.

292
00:05:15,874 --> 00:05:15,889
&nbsp

293
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,311
- I mean...
- We might need her for Grodd.

294
00:05:18,321 --> 00:05:18,673
&nbsp

295
00:05:18,683 --> 00:05:20,974
Grodd? Gr...

296
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:20,999
&nbsp

297
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:22,757
- Telepathic gorilla?
- Yeah.

298
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:22,782
&nbsp

299
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:23,866
Where... where are you going?

300
00:05:23,876 --> 00:05:23,868
&nbsp

301
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:25,116
Are you going to Planet of the Apes?

302
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:25,140
&nbsp

303
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,873
No, it's just a city of them, okay?

304
00:05:26,883 --> 00:05:26,898
&nbsp

305
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:28,054
Will you cover for me?

306
00:05:28,064 --> 00:05:28,062
&nbsp

307
00:05:28,072 --> 00:05:29,484
Are you going to Planet of the Apes?

308
00:05:29,494 --> 00:05:29,523
&nbsp

309
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:31,023
I'm not going to Planet
of the Apes, okay?

310
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:31,048
&nbsp

311
00:05:31,058 --> 00:05:32,401
Calm down. Will you cover for me?

312
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:32,426
&nbsp

313
00:05:32,436 --> 00:05:33,470
I got you. Yeah, of course.

314
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:33,495
&nbsp

315
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:34,869
Okay, thank you. See you in a few days.

316
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:34,894
&nbsp

317
00:05:34,904 --> 00:05:36,251
All right, now.

318
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:40,243
&nbsp

319
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:41,931
- And make sure Wally doesn't...
- I won't.

320
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:41,956
&nbsp

321
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,120
Because, you know, sometimes...

322
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:43,145
&nbsp

323
00:05:43,155 --> 00:05:44,118
- he can be a little...
- Barry...

324
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:44,143
&nbsp

325
00:05:44,153 --> 00:05:45,360
You know, if given the opportunity...

326
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:45,385
&nbsp

327
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:46,650
Barry, I am very good

328
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:46,675
&nbsp

329
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:48,060
at bossing my little
brother around, okay?

330
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,085
&nbsp

331
00:05:48,095 --> 00:05:49,217
- Don't worry.
- All right.

332
00:05:49,227 --> 00:05:49,225
&nbsp

333
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:51,356
Just please don't do anything stupid.

334
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:51,381
&nbsp

335
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:54,083
You mean like voluntarily
going to a city of super apes?

336
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:54,108
&nbsp

337
00:05:54,118 --> 00:05:55,514
I'm being serious.

338
00:05:55,524 --> 00:05:55,539
&nbsp

339
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:56,775
Rescue Harry.

340
00:05:56,785 --> 00:05:56,777
&nbsp

341
00:05:56,787 --> 00:05:58,373
But other than that, you...

342
00:05:58,383 --> 00:05:58,398
&nbsp

343
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:00,281
you don't have to do this for me.

344
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:00,306
&nbsp

345
00:06:00,316 --> 00:06:02,201
Everything I do is for you.

346
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:04,660
&nbsp

347
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,942
Good.

348
00:06:05,952 --> 00:06:05,967
&nbsp

349
00:06:05,977 --> 00:06:07,802
Y'all know Wally can hear you, right?

350
00:06:07,812 --> 00:06:07,841
&nbsp

351
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:09,427
Sorry, Wally.

352
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:09,474
&nbsp

353
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:10,740
Be safe.

354
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:10,742
&nbsp

355
00:06:10,752 --> 00:06:12,909
Hey, you see anything hinky, you run.

356
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:12,911
&nbsp

357
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:14,344
Listen to me. I don't
need to tell you that.

358
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:14,346
&nbsp

359
00:06:14,356 --> 00:06:15,363
I promise.

360
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:15,388
&nbsp

361
00:06:15,398 --> 00:06:16,574
All right.

362
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:21,256
&nbsp

363
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:23,402
Detective. Hmm.

364
00:06:23,412 --> 00:06:23,613
&nbsp

365
00:06:23,623 --> 00:06:25,815
Indiana Jones much?

366
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:25,840
&nbsp

367
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,207
Cisco, my friend, this is
not my first expedition,

368
00:06:28,217 --> 00:06:28,209
&nbsp

369
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:30,988
and believe me, this
is the perfect attire.

370
00:06:30,998 --> 00:06:31,013
&nbsp

371
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,286
Wait, Julian, what's going on?

372
00:06:32,296 --> 00:06:32,317
&nbsp

373
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:34,331
I thought you were gonna cover for me.

374
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:34,356
&nbsp

375
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:35,419
I spoke to Captain Singh.

376
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:35,444
&nbsp

377
00:06:35,454 --> 00:06:37,029
He thinks we're at a
morphology conference

378
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:37,054
&nbsp

379
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,396
up in Bludhaven.

380
00:06:38,406 --> 00:06:38,425
&nbsp

381
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:40,958
So if it's all the same to you...

382
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:41,239
&nbsp

383
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:42,387
All right.

384
00:06:42,397 --> 00:06:42,413
&nbsp

385
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:43,559
You don't have to come, Julian.

386
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:43,584
&nbsp

387
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:45,964
- You don't even know Harry.
- Come on.

388
00:06:45,974 --> 00:06:45,989
&nbsp

389
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:48,067
A chance to travel to
another dimension...

390
00:06:48,077 --> 00:06:48,069
&nbsp

391
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,602
I mean, I wasn't gonna miss that.

392
00:06:49,612 --> 00:06:49,604
&nbsp

393
00:06:49,614 --> 00:06:51,371
We're not going sightseeing.

394
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:52,958
&nbsp

395
00:06:52,968 --> 00:06:54,595
Neither am I.

396
00:06:54,605 --> 00:06:55,134
&nbsp

397
00:06:55,144 --> 00:06:56,376
Well, damn.

398
00:06:56,386 --> 00:06:56,378
&nbsp

399
00:06:56,388 --> 00:06:58,040
All right, Jesse, Wally,

400
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:58,065
&nbsp

401
00:06:58,075 --> 00:07:00,390
you make sure this city's
safe while I'm gone, all right?

402
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:00,415
&nbsp

403
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:01,634
We will.

404
00:07:01,644 --> 00:07:01,650
&nbsp

405
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,217
Hey, Barry.

406
00:07:03,227 --> 00:07:03,664
&nbsp

407
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,797
If you... if you see
my dad, just tell him...

408
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:05,822
&nbsp

409
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:08,313
You'll see him real soon,
Jesse. Speedster's honor.

410
00:07:08,323 --> 00:07:10,293
&nbsp

411
00:07:10,303 --> 00:07:11,816
All right, let's do this.

412
00:07:11,826 --> 00:07:11,841
&nbsp

413
00:07:11,851 --> 00:07:13,089
Okay.

414
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:13,425
&nbsp

415
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:15,331
Earth-2, here we come.

416
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:31,046
&nbsp

417
00:07:31,056 --> 00:07:32,147
How was that?

418
00:07:32,157 --> 00:07:32,172
&nbsp

419
00:07:32,182 --> 00:07:33,678
Bloody brilliant.

420
00:07:33,688 --> 00:07:35,120
&nbsp

421
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,358
Wow.

422
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:38,500
&nbsp

423
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,954
Well, we made it.

424
00:07:39,964 --> 00:07:44,027
&nbsp

425
00:07:44,037 --> 00:07:45,693
Welcome to the jungle, baby.

426
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:58,350
&nbsp

427
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,484
Earth-2 Africa.

428
00:08:00,494 --> 00:08:00,678
&nbsp

429
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,086
Not hot.

430
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:02,088
&nbsp

431
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:03,920
Guess global warming's
not really a thing here.

432
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:04,969
&nbsp

433
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:06,154
But bugs are.

434
00:08:06,164 --> 00:08:06,304
&nbsp

435
00:08:06,314 --> 00:08:07,670
Someone please help me out.

436
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:07,695
&nbsp

437
00:08:07,705 --> 00:08:10,037
How exactly does saving
someone on this Earth

438
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:10,062
&nbsp

439
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,628
prevent an attack on ours?

440
00:08:11,638 --> 00:08:11,653
&nbsp

441
00:08:11,663 --> 00:08:12,943
If Grodd is planning to attack,

442
00:08:12,953 --> 00:08:12,945
&nbsp

443
00:08:12,955 --> 00:08:14,951
he's gonna need to open
a breach to our Earth,

444
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:14,976
&nbsp

445
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:16,977
and the only one over here
that can open one is...

446
00:08:16,987 --> 00:08:17,002
&nbsp

447
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:19,169
- Harrison Wells.
- Harrison Wells, yeah.

448
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:19,171
&nbsp

449
00:08:19,181 --> 00:08:20,930
So if we save him from Grodd,

450
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:20,955
&nbsp

451
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:22,855
then he can't get to our Earth,

452
00:08:22,865 --> 00:08:22,908
&nbsp

453
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:24,975
the attack never happens,
we change the future,

454
00:08:24,985 --> 00:08:24,977
&nbsp

455
00:08:24,987 --> 00:08:28,011
and we're one step
closer to saving Iris.

456
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:32,310
&nbsp

457
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,517
Hey.

458
00:08:33,527 --> 00:08:33,519
&nbsp

459
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:35,378
You want to go for a run?

460
00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:35,403
&nbsp

461
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:38,331
Uh, yeah, yeah. Maybe later.

462
00:08:38,341 --> 00:08:38,790
&nbsp

463
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,257
Are you okay?

464
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:40,300
&nbsp

465
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,333
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

466
00:08:42,343 --> 00:08:42,335
&nbsp

467
00:08:42,345 --> 00:08:44,402
Look, I know I haven't been
great at keeping in touch.

468
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:44,404
&nbsp

469
00:08:44,414 --> 00:08:46,604
It's just everything's been so crazy

470
00:08:46,614 --> 00:08:46,606
&nbsp

471
00:08:46,616 --> 00:08:49,737
trying to train with Barry
and shadowing him, and..

472
00:08:49,747 --> 00:08:49,762
&nbsp

473
00:08:49,772 --> 00:08:51,842
I just haven't had that
much time for other things.

474
00:08:51,852 --> 00:08:51,844
&nbsp

475
00:08:51,854 --> 00:08:53,213
Yeah, or other people.

476
00:08:53,223 --> 00:08:53,238
&nbsp

477
00:08:53,248 --> 00:08:54,679
That is not what I meant.

478
00:08:54,689 --> 00:08:54,681
&nbsp

479
00:08:54,691 --> 00:08:56,566
No, look, I... I get it.

480
00:08:56,576 --> 00:08:56,591
&nbsp

481
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:57,915
Trust me.

482
00:08:57,925 --> 00:08:58,009
&nbsp

483
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,837
- It's not easy being a hero, is it?
- No.

484
00:09:00,847 --> 00:09:00,862
&nbsp

485
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:02,931
But I love every minute of it.

486
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:03,846
&nbsp

487
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:05,212
Great.

488
00:09:05,222 --> 00:09:05,959
&nbsp

489
00:09:05,969 --> 00:09:07,725
Are you sure you're okay?

490
00:09:07,735 --> 00:09:07,727
&nbsp

491
00:09:07,737 --> 00:09:09,260
- Because...
- Yeah.

492
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:09,262
&nbsp

493
00:09:09,272 --> 00:09:10,895
I'm just worried about my dad.

494
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:16,719
&nbsp

495
00:09:16,729 --> 00:09:18,505
- Hey.
- Hey.

496
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:20,873
&nbsp

497
00:09:20,883 --> 00:09:23,774
I hope we didn't interrupt you two.

498
00:09:23,784 --> 00:09:23,776
&nbsp

499
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:27,369
Nope. Nothing to interrupt.

500
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:27,513
&nbsp

501
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:28,689
- Mm.
- Aren't you...

502
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:28,714
&nbsp

503
00:09:28,724 --> 00:09:30,281
you aren't happy she's back?

504
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:30,283
&nbsp

505
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:32,041
I am. I just wish she felt the same.

506
00:09:32,051 --> 00:09:32,057
&nbsp

507
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:34,358
Ever since she got here, she's
been acting so weird with me.

508
00:09:34,368 --> 00:09:34,360
&nbsp

509
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,660
I... I don't know if
it's because I have powers

510
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:36,662
&nbsp

511
00:09:36,672 --> 00:09:38,758
or if it's just me.

512
00:09:38,768 --> 00:09:38,783
&nbsp

513
00:09:38,793 --> 00:09:40,531
Wally, she's probably still just upset

514
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:40,533
&nbsp

515
00:09:40,543 --> 00:09:42,292
because her father's missing, right?

516
00:09:42,302 --> 00:09:42,317
&nbsp

517
00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:43,750
Yeah, it's hard to focus on other things

518
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:43,752
&nbsp

519
00:09:43,762 --> 00:09:46,019
when something like that
is weighing you down.

520
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:46,021
&nbsp

521
00:09:46,031 --> 00:09:48,012
Yeah, Wally. She'll be fine. Just...

522
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:48,037
&nbsp

523
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:50,004
give her some time, and then,

524
00:09:50,014 --> 00:09:50,029
&nbsp

525
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,190
you know, lock it down.

526
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,192
&nbsp

527
00:09:51,202 --> 00:09:53,215
- Uhh, lock it down, hmm?
- Yeah.

528
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:53,240
&nbsp

529
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,826
What, you think I didn't notice
that your Facebook profile

530
00:09:54,836 --> 00:09:54,851
&nbsp

531
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:55,913
still says "single"?

532
00:09:55,923 --> 00:09:55,937
&nbsp

533
00:09:55,947 --> 00:09:58,131
What? I mean, technically,
I'm still single.

534
00:09:58,141 --> 00:10:02,003
&nbsp

535
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:03,183
What was it?

536
00:10:03,193 --> 00:10:03,208
&nbsp

537
00:10:03,218 --> 00:10:05,505
Ugh, robbery in progress
at O'Sullivan Bank.

538
00:10:05,515 --> 00:10:05,507
&nbsp

539
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:06,839
You two go.

540
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:15,283
&nbsp

541
00:10:15,293 --> 00:10:16,590
Come on, let's go.

542
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,752
&nbsp

543
00:10:17,762 --> 00:10:20,153
- Didn't hear the news, huh?
- What news?

544
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:20,155
&nbsp

545
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:22,615
That you don't mess with Kid Flash.

546
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:22,640
&nbsp

547
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,980
We got to get back to our
friends. They're expecting us.

548
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,005
&nbsp

549
00:10:25,015 --> 00:10:26,893
Yeah, they picked some real winners.

550
00:10:26,903 --> 00:10:27,112
&nbsp

551
00:10:27,122 --> 00:10:29,776
I know, which is more
than I can say for you two.

552
00:10:29,786 --> 00:10:31,281
&nbsp

553
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,647
Be right back.

554
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:37,587
&nbsp

555
00:10:37,597 --> 00:10:40,077
- Sorry, I... I had to stretch my legs.
- Mm.

556
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:40,102
&nbsp

557
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:42,084
Hey, guys, come out.

558
00:10:42,094 --> 00:10:42,086
&nbsp

559
00:10:42,096 --> 00:10:44,030
Oh, it's...

560
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,055
&nbsp

561
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:45,186
it's nothing to see here, guys.

562
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:45,211
&nbsp

563
00:10:45,221 --> 00:10:47,762
It's just a couple fools getting
their asses handed to 'em.

564
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:47,764
&nbsp

565
00:10:47,774 --> 00:10:49,044
Thank you.

566
00:10:49,054 --> 00:10:49,069
&nbsp

567
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:50,398
Oh, my gosh, thank you.

568
00:10:50,408 --> 00:10:58,851
&nbsp

569
00:10:58,861 --> 00:11:00,274
Ah.

570
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,307
&nbsp

571
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:03,806
Want some water?

572
00:11:03,816 --> 00:11:04,480
&nbsp

573
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,279
I'm okay, thanks.

574
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:06,304
&nbsp

575
00:11:06,314 --> 00:11:09,238
It's important to stay
hydrated on a parallel Earth.

576
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:09,324
&nbsp

577
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:12,592
So weird being back here
on this alternate universe.

578
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:12,789
&nbsp

579
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,599
This is where I met my
doppelganger, the evil one.

580
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:15,624
&nbsp

581
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:16,841
- Killer Frost.
- Ah.

582
00:11:16,851 --> 00:11:16,866
&nbsp

583
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:20,216
She's the one I'm always
afraid of becoming.

584
00:11:20,226 --> 00:11:20,550
&nbsp

585
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,183
And where is she now?

586
00:11:22,193 --> 00:11:22,498
&nbsp

587
00:11:22,508 --> 00:11:23,777
Dead.

588
00:11:23,787 --> 00:11:24,867
&nbsp

589
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:26,908
That's not gonna happen to you, Caitlin.

590
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:28,705
&nbsp

591
00:11:28,715 --> 00:11:30,304
I'm glad you came with us, Julian.

592
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:30,306
&nbsp

593
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:32,066
You're a nice addition to the team.

594
00:11:32,076 --> 00:11:32,363
&nbsp

595
00:11:32,373 --> 00:11:34,196
Yeah, well,

596
00:11:34,206 --> 00:11:34,433
&nbsp

597
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,567
I live for danger.

598
00:11:36,577 --> 00:11:39,382
&nbsp

599
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:40,815
We're close, guys.

600
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:52,528
&nbsp

601
00:11:52,538 --> 00:11:53,794
Do you hear that?

602
00:11:53,804 --> 00:11:54,069
&nbsp

603
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,731
This is it.

604
00:11:55,741 --> 00:12:10,425
&nbsp

605
00:12:10,435 --> 00:12:11,595
It's a trap.

606
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:11,628
&nbsp

607
00:12:11,638 --> 00:12:13,048
Ugh!

608
00:12:13,058 --> 00:12:23,179
&nbsp

609
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:25,246
Welcome, Caitlin.

610
00:12:25,256 --> 00:12:25,271
&nbsp

611
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:27,838
Knew you'd come...

612
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:27,863
&nbsp

613
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:30,002
Flash.

614
00:12:30,012 --> 00:13:07,814
&nbsp

615
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,337
You guys all right?

616
00:13:09,347 --> 00:13:09,883
&nbsp

617
00:13:09,893 --> 00:13:11,115
Yeah, I'm okay.

618
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:11,117
&nbsp

619
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:12,617
Yeah, me too.

620
00:13:12,627 --> 00:13:12,619
&nbsp

621
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:15,253
I've lost my gun, but I'm all right.

622
00:13:15,263 --> 00:13:15,373
&nbsp

623
00:13:15,383 --> 00:13:18,346
Well, looks like you're gonna
have to phase us out of here.

624
00:13:18,356 --> 00:13:23,749
&nbsp

625
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,348
I can't. I...

626
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:25,373
&nbsp

627
00:13:25,383 --> 00:13:27,227
I don't know. Something's
holding me back.

628
00:13:27,237 --> 00:13:27,258
&nbsp

629
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:29,110
Can you open a breach?

630
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,098
&nbsp

631
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:35,664
- No dice.
- Yeah.

632
00:13:35,674 --> 00:13:35,666
&nbsp

633
00:13:35,676 --> 00:13:37,891
I don't think it's the cell. I...

634
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:38,492
&nbsp

635
00:13:38,502 --> 00:13:41,103
Grodd must be dampening
our powers somehow.

636
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:41,547
&nbsp

637
00:13:41,557 --> 00:13:42,780
Okay.

638
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:48,720
&nbsp

639
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,736
Harry?

640
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,884
&nbsp

641
00:13:52,894 --> 00:13:55,314
- You're all right.
- Wells.

642
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:55,339
&nbsp

643
00:13:55,349 --> 00:13:57,586
Hey! You got to help us get out of here

644
00:13:57,596 --> 00:13:57,588
&nbsp

645
00:13:57,598 --> 00:13:59,288
before the gorillas come back.

646
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,019
&nbsp

647
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:02,691
Hello, Flash.

648
00:14:02,701 --> 00:14:05,480
&nbsp

649
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,296
- Grodd.
- What?

650
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:07,298
&nbsp

651
00:14:07,308 --> 00:14:09,565
That's Grodd the gorilla?
He's talking through Wells?

652
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:09,567
&nbsp

653
00:14:09,577 --> 00:14:10,926
- That's a... a thing?
- Yeah.

654
00:14:10,936 --> 00:14:10,951
&nbsp

655
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:12,426
Yeah, sort of trips you out at first,

656
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:12,451
&nbsp

657
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:13,785
but trust me, you get used to it.

658
00:14:13,795 --> 00:14:13,810
&nbsp

659
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,387
Grodd, let him go.

660
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:16,412
&nbsp

661
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,579
This is between you and me.

662
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:18,604
&nbsp

663
00:14:18,614 --> 00:14:20,137
Not yet.

664
00:14:20,147 --> 00:14:21,579
&nbsp

665
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:23,846
- I need him.
- For what?

666
00:14:23,856 --> 00:14:23,848
&nbsp

667
00:14:23,858 --> 00:14:25,225
Why'd you lure him here?

668
00:14:25,235 --> 00:14:25,250
&nbsp

669
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,889
For you.

670
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:26,914
&nbsp

671
00:14:26,924 --> 00:14:29,695
Need your help.

672
00:14:29,705 --> 00:14:29,720
&nbsp

673
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,116
Help?

674
00:14:31,126 --> 00:14:31,119
&nbsp

675
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:32,881
Got a funny way of asking for it.

676
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:32,906
&nbsp

677
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,700
You sent me here!

678
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:34,702
&nbsp

679
00:14:34,712 --> 00:14:36,030
Remember?

680
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,114
&nbsp

681
00:14:40,124 --> 00:14:41,747
To live in this hell!

682
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:41,999
&nbsp

683
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:44,466
Where I am forced to serve

684
00:14:44,476 --> 00:14:44,468
&nbsp

685
00:14:44,478 --> 00:14:46,743
under the rule of Solovar.

686
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:46,768
&nbsp

687
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:47,992
Who's Solovar?

688
00:14:48,002 --> 00:14:48,017
&nbsp

689
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:49,868
Leader of Gorilla Kind.

690
00:14:49,878 --> 00:14:49,893
&nbsp

691
00:14:49,903 --> 00:14:52,321
Ruler of Gorilla City.

692
00:14:52,331 --> 00:14:52,399
&nbsp

693
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:54,191
And now...

694
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:54,216
&nbsp

695
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,354
he wants to rule the humans.

696
00:14:56,364 --> 00:14:56,379
&nbsp

697
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:59,325
He will bring war to your Earth.

698
00:14:59,335 --> 00:14:59,350
&nbsp

699
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,017
- Why?
- He has seen many conflicts

700
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:02,019
&nbsp

701
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:04,730
between gorillas and humans.

702
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:04,755
&nbsp

703
00:15:04,765 --> 00:15:07,223
He is afraid the humans will attack,

704
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:07,225
&nbsp

705
00:15:07,235 --> 00:15:09,124
but now that you're here,

706
00:15:09,134 --> 00:15:09,126
&nbsp

707
00:15:09,136 --> 00:15:11,594
he will bring the fight to you.

708
00:15:11,604 --> 00:15:11,596
&nbsp

709
00:15:11,606 --> 00:15:13,552
So you lured us here to stop him?

710
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:13,577
&nbsp

711
00:15:13,587 --> 00:15:16,153
As trespassers...

712
00:15:16,163 --> 00:15:16,701
&nbsp

713
00:15:16,711 --> 00:15:19,044
you will be sent to the arena...

714
00:15:19,054 --> 00:15:19,069
&nbsp

715
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,161
and executed.

716
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:21,539
&nbsp

717
00:15:21,549 --> 00:15:23,339
What? How about a signpost at the front?

718
00:15:23,349 --> 00:15:23,341
&nbsp

719
00:15:23,351 --> 00:15:24,654
"All trespassers will be executed."

720
00:15:24,664 --> 00:15:24,679
&nbsp

721
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:26,275
That wouldn't be the
worst idea, would it?

722
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:26,277
&nbsp

723
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:28,911
Will be Solovar's great honor...

724
00:15:28,921 --> 00:15:28,913
&nbsp

725
00:15:28,923 --> 00:15:30,904
to kill you...

726
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:30,929
&nbsp

727
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:32,491
himself.

728
00:15:32,501 --> 00:15:32,516
&nbsp

729
00:15:32,526 --> 00:15:35,451
- Mm.
- But, Flash...

730
00:15:35,461 --> 00:15:35,453
&nbsp

731
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:37,780
if he were to be defeated,

732
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,679
&nbsp

733
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:41,819
the other gorillas
would see his weakness

734
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,874
&nbsp

735
00:15:41,884 --> 00:15:44,326
and would no longer follow him.

736
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:44,328
&nbsp

737
00:15:44,338 --> 00:15:46,328
Well, I'm not gonna kill anyone,

738
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:46,330
&nbsp

739
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,630
not even a gorilla.

740
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:47,632
&nbsp

741
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:49,331
Kill or be killed!

742
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:49,333
&nbsp

743
00:15:49,343 --> 00:15:51,982
This is the only law
Gorilla Kind understands.

744
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:52,007
&nbsp

745
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,966
How do you benefit from this, Grodd?

746
00:15:53,976 --> 00:15:53,991
&nbsp

747
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:55,558
Solovar falls.

748
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:55,583
&nbsp

749
00:15:55,593 --> 00:15:57,583
I take his place.

750
00:15:57,593 --> 00:15:57,742
&nbsp

751
00:15:57,752 --> 00:15:59,784
I rule the gorillas,

752
00:15:59,794 --> 00:15:59,809
&nbsp

753
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:03,877
and I promise to keep
them in Gorilla City.

754
00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:06,884
&nbsp

755
00:16:06,894 --> 00:16:08,751
How do we know we can trust you?

756
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:08,753
&nbsp

757
00:16:08,763 --> 00:16:10,179
Because...

758
00:16:10,189 --> 00:16:11,389
&nbsp

759
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,989
even though you sent me away,

760
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:13,991
&nbsp

761
00:16:14,001 --> 00:16:16,570
your Earth is still my home.

762
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,628
&nbsp

763
00:16:17,638 --> 00:16:19,707
And there are those among you...

764
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:20,166
&nbsp

765
00:16:20,176 --> 00:16:22,050
I will never forget.

766
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:29,940
&nbsp

767
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,707
Kill Solovar,

768
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:31,709
&nbsp

769
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:34,675
and Central City will be spared.

770
00:16:34,685 --> 00:16:35,438
&nbsp

771
00:16:35,448 --> 00:16:38,808
Fail, and see your home...

772
00:16:38,818 --> 00:16:38,841
&nbsp

773
00:16:38,851 --> 00:16:41,341
turned to ash.

774
00:16:41,351 --> 00:16:46,040
&nbsp

775
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,016
Hey, Jesse, you got a sec?

776
00:16:48,026 --> 00:16:50,094
&nbsp

777
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:52,055
Did I do something wrong?

778
00:16:52,065 --> 00:16:52,963
&nbsp

779
00:16:52,973 --> 00:16:54,519
I don't... I don't think so.

780
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:54,544
&nbsp

781
00:16:54,554 --> 00:16:56,644
Okay, then why are you
being so cold with me?

782
00:16:56,654 --> 00:16:57,168
&nbsp

783
00:16:57,178 --> 00:16:58,667
Jesse, come on, you can talk to me.

784
00:16:58,677 --> 00:16:58,669
&nbsp

785
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:02,043
I know that this is about
more than just your dad.

786
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:07,789
&nbsp

787
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,593
Look, I guess...

788
00:17:09,603 --> 00:17:10,959
&nbsp

789
00:17:10,969 --> 00:17:12,555
I guess I thought...

790
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:12,580
&nbsp

791
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,195
one day we'd figure out
a way to be together.

792
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:15,405
&nbsp

793
00:17:15,415 --> 00:17:18,148
You know, but now that you
have your powers, it's...

794
00:17:18,158 --> 00:17:18,477
&nbsp

795
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:20,377
it's like I never hear from you.

796
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:20,676
&nbsp

797
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:22,184
Jesse, if...

798
00:17:22,194 --> 00:17:22,209
&nbsp

799
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:23,814
if you would,

800
00:17:23,824 --> 00:17:23,839
&nbsp

801
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:25,244
I want you to stay.

802
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:25,269
&nbsp

803
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,262
- I can't.
- Why?

804
00:17:27,272 --> 00:17:27,287
&nbsp

805
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,486
Because of your dad?

806
00:17:28,496 --> 00:17:28,511
&nbsp

807
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:30,187
Because Barry is going to find him.

808
00:17:30,197 --> 00:17:30,212
&nbsp

809
00:17:30,222 --> 00:17:33,069
Look, you don't know
that, okay? You don't.

810
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:37,555
&nbsp

811
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:39,811
When I first got my power,

812
00:17:39,821 --> 00:17:40,467
&nbsp

813
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,911
you were so lost not having yours.

814
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:42,936
&nbsp

815
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:45,525
You know, and I thought
maybe part of the reason

816
00:17:45,535 --> 00:17:45,527
&nbsp

817
00:17:45,537 --> 00:17:47,327
why you liked me was...

818
00:17:47,337 --> 00:17:47,624
&nbsp

819
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,489
'cause you were attracted
to the speed and not me.

820
00:17:49,499 --> 00:17:49,514
&nbsp

821
00:17:49,524 --> 00:17:51,298
I know, I know, okay?

822
00:17:51,308 --> 00:17:51,300
&nbsp

823
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,366
But I saw you out there today...

824
00:17:53,376 --> 00:17:53,368
&nbsp

825
00:17:53,378 --> 00:17:55,616
being Kid Flash.

826
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:56,805
&nbsp

827
00:17:56,815 --> 00:17:58,538
Okay, and you were complete, Wally.

828
00:17:58,548 --> 00:17:58,540
&nbsp

829
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,967
You were scary complete.

830
00:18:00,977 --> 00:18:00,992
&nbsp

831
00:18:01,002 --> 00:18:03,210
I could have all the speed in the world.

832
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:03,235
&nbsp

833
00:18:03,245 --> 00:18:05,687
I'm not complete without you.

834
00:18:05,697 --> 00:18:08,087
&nbsp

835
00:18:08,097 --> 00:18:09,695
Stay.

836
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:33,909
&nbsp

837
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,643
Barry, do you really think
you could kill this Solovar?

838
00:18:37,653 --> 00:18:37,871
&nbsp

839
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:40,171
Do you think you could take a life?

840
00:18:40,181 --> 00:18:55,931
&nbsp

841
00:18:55,941 --> 00:18:57,544
It is as I feared.

842
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:57,569
&nbsp

843
00:18:57,579 --> 00:19:00,584
The humans court war with Gorilla Kind.

844
00:19:00,594 --> 00:19:00,686
&nbsp

845
00:19:00,696 --> 00:19:02,569
Why did you not tell me, Grodd,

846
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:02,571
&nbsp

847
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:05,435
more humans had entered the city?

848
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:05,460
&nbsp

849
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,186
I was about to inform you, Solovar.

850
00:19:08,196 --> 00:19:09,878
&nbsp

851
00:19:09,888 --> 00:19:11,327
Why?

852
00:19:11,337 --> 00:19:11,970
&nbsp

853
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,921
Why are you here?

854
00:19:13,931 --> 00:19:13,965
&nbsp

855
00:19:13,975 --> 00:19:16,232
To study us like animals?

856
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:16,257
&nbsp

857
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:18,554
Make us your pets?

858
00:19:18,564 --> 00:19:18,579
&nbsp

859
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:20,538
No, no. I'm... I...

860
00:19:20,548 --> 00:19:21,741
&nbsp

861
00:19:21,751 --> 00:19:24,226
We came here in peace.

862
00:19:24,236 --> 00:19:24,493
&nbsp

863
00:19:24,503 --> 00:19:26,026
We entered your city by mistake.

864
00:19:26,036 --> 00:19:26,028
&nbsp

865
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:28,156
Uh, we mean you no harm.

866
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:28,969
&nbsp

867
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:30,664
Please...

868
00:19:30,674 --> 00:19:30,666
&nbsp

869
00:19:30,676 --> 00:19:32,666
just let me and my
friends go, and I promise,

870
00:19:32,676 --> 00:19:32,668
&nbsp

871
00:19:32,678 --> 00:19:33,933
we'll never come back here again.

872
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:40,809
&nbsp

873
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:43,109
My brethren have seen you.

874
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,080
&nbsp

875
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,050
Your fate is sealed.

876
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,654
&nbsp

877
00:19:47,664 --> 00:19:50,220
You will all die by my hand...

878
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:50,479
&nbsp

879
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,081
in the arena...

880
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:52,862
&nbsp

881
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:55,522
so that all will know
that Solovar's justice

882
00:19:55,532 --> 00:19:55,524
&nbsp

883
00:19:55,534 --> 00:19:58,292
is wise and swift.

884
00:19:58,302 --> 00:20:03,128
&nbsp

885
00:20:03,138 --> 00:20:05,122
All right, I'll make you a deal.

886
00:20:05,132 --> 00:20:06,802
&nbsp

887
00:20:06,812 --> 00:20:09,369
I'll fight you in the arena... just me.

888
00:20:09,379 --> 00:20:09,371
&nbsp

889
00:20:09,381 --> 00:20:11,076
But if I beat you,

890
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:11,500
&nbsp

891
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,139
you let my friends go,

892
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:13,141
&nbsp

893
00:20:13,151 --> 00:20:15,108
and you leave us alone for good.

894
00:20:15,118 --> 00:20:17,312
&nbsp

895
00:20:17,322 --> 00:20:18,717
I accept.

896
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:20,782
&nbsp

897
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:23,335
Humans and their arrogance.

898
00:20:23,345 --> 00:20:23,983
&nbsp

899
00:20:23,993 --> 00:20:26,117
First you will suffer.

900
00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:26,569
&nbsp

901
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:29,093
Then I will grant you each...

902
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:29,324
&nbsp

903
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:31,185
a horrible death.

904
00:20:31,195 --> 00:21:18,224
&nbsp

905
00:21:18,234 --> 00:21:20,891
Speedster versus super gorilla.

906
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:20,893
&nbsp

907
00:21:20,903 --> 00:21:23,127
Best worst video game ever.

908
00:21:23,137 --> 00:21:23,337
&nbsp

909
00:21:23,347 --> 00:21:26,032
Do you really think that
Barry can beat Solovar?

910
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:26,034
&nbsp

911
00:21:26,044 --> 00:21:28,485
Well, he'd better, for all of our sakes.

912
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:28,510
&nbsp

913
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,368
It's starting.

914
00:21:30,378 --> 00:21:39,840
&nbsp

915
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,622
After you die,

916
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:41,647
&nbsp

917
00:21:41,657 --> 00:21:44,848
your friends will follow
you into the black.

918
00:21:44,858 --> 00:21:44,850
&nbsp

919
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,950
- We'll see.
- Okay, Barry.

920
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:46,952
&nbsp

921
00:21:46,962 --> 00:21:48,385
I got a plan for you.

922
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:48,387
&nbsp

923
00:21:48,397 --> 00:21:50,687
It's all about the speed punches.

924
00:21:50,697 --> 00:21:50,689
&nbsp

925
00:21:50,699 --> 00:21:52,243
Speed punches.

926
00:21:52,253 --> 00:21:52,268
&nbsp

927
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:54,058
Come on, Barry.

928
00:21:54,068 --> 00:22:24,567
&nbsp

929
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:26,154
Change of plan, Barry.

930
00:22:26,164 --> 00:22:26,179
&nbsp

931
00:22:26,189 --> 00:22:27,391
It's all about the running away.

932
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:34,967
&nbsp

933
00:22:34,977 --> 00:22:36,533
What about the lightning throw?

934
00:22:36,543 --> 00:22:36,535
&nbsp

935
00:22:36,545 --> 00:22:38,402
Yes, Barry, lightning throw!

936
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:38,404
&nbsp

937
00:22:38,414 --> 00:22:40,437
Worth a shot!

938
00:22:40,447 --> 00:23:22,915
&nbsp

939
00:23:22,925 --> 00:23:24,281
That's oh for two.

940
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:24,283
&nbsp

941
00:23:24,293 --> 00:23:25,639
Come on, Barry, get up.

942
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:28,554
&nbsp

943
00:23:28,564 --> 00:23:31,739
All my days, this is quite
the reversal of our fortune.

944
00:23:31,749 --> 00:23:34,750
&nbsp

945
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,272
Reversal...

946
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:38,664
&nbsp

947
00:23:38,674 --> 00:23:40,931
Barry, it's time to
pull a reverse Flash.

948
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:44,156
&nbsp

949
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,577
Do it!

950
00:23:45,587 --> 00:24:00,228
&nbsp

951
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,763
He did it! He actually did it.

952
00:24:02,773 --> 00:24:02,788
&nbsp

953
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:04,250
He bloody well did it.

954
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:13,142
&nbsp

955
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:14,984
I won't kill him!

956
00:24:14,994 --> 00:24:16,454
&nbsp

957
00:24:16,464 --> 00:24:17,734
I won't!

958
00:24:17,744 --> 00:24:19,895
&nbsp

959
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:22,109
I know you all fear humans!

960
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:24,977
&nbsp

961
00:24:24,987 --> 00:24:27,711
You think we want war with Gorilla Kind!

962
00:24:27,721 --> 00:24:29,826
&nbsp

963
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,449
We don't!

964
00:24:31,459 --> 00:24:33,339
&nbsp

965
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:36,451
We're not all murderers and killers!

966
00:24:36,461 --> 00:24:36,945
&nbsp

967
00:24:36,955 --> 00:24:39,045
We only want peace!

968
00:24:39,055 --> 00:24:41,160
&nbsp

969
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,921
Which is why I'm sparing your leader!

970
00:24:43,931 --> 00:24:44,921
&nbsp

971
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:46,830
We call it mercy!

972
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,967
&nbsp

973
00:24:47,977 --> 00:24:49,076
Take him out.

974
00:24:49,086 --> 00:25:11,924
&nbsp

975
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:13,463
Oh...

976
00:25:13,473 --> 00:25:13,488
&nbsp

977
00:25:13,498 --> 00:25:14,829
what happened?

978
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:14,854
&nbsp

979
00:25:14,864 --> 00:25:16,287
Congratulations.

980
00:25:16,297 --> 00:25:16,289
&nbsp

981
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:17,814
You won.

982
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,541
&nbsp

983
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,164
What about Harry?

984
00:25:21,174 --> 00:25:21,189
&nbsp

985
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:23,704
He's still catatonic.

986
00:25:23,714 --> 00:25:31,493
&nbsp

987
00:25:31,503 --> 00:25:34,104
- Flash.
- I won.

988
00:25:34,114 --> 00:25:34,322
&nbsp

989
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,767
Solovar promised to let us go.

990
00:25:36,777 --> 00:25:37,343
&nbsp

991
00:25:37,353 --> 00:25:38,767
No.

992
00:25:38,777 --> 00:25:39,860
&nbsp

993
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,790
No? What do you...

994
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,119
&nbsp

995
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:43,485
I don't understand.

996
00:25:43,495 --> 00:25:43,510
&nbsp

997
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,132
Solovar's words mean nothing now.

998
00:25:46,142 --> 00:25:46,157
&nbsp

999
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:48,493
You never had any intentions
of letting us go, did you?

1000
00:25:48,503 --> 00:25:48,518
&nbsp

1001
00:25:48,528 --> 00:25:51,586
I told you I needed you.

1002
00:25:51,596 --> 00:25:51,611
&nbsp

1003
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:54,925
I could not defeat Solovar
in combat, but you could.

1004
00:25:54,935 --> 00:25:54,950
&nbsp

1005
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,985
You did, and now I am
the ruler of Gorilla City,

1006
00:25:58,995 --> 00:25:59,010
&nbsp

1007
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,302
and all the gorillas will follow me.

1008
00:26:01,312 --> 00:26:03,863
&nbsp

1009
00:26:03,873 --> 00:26:06,769
Solovar never wanted
to attack Central City.

1010
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:07,133
&nbsp

1011
00:26:07,143 --> 00:26:08,432
You do.

1012
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:08,434
&nbsp

1013
00:26:08,444 --> 00:26:10,501
You took my home away from me,

1014
00:26:10,511 --> 00:26:10,503
&nbsp

1015
00:26:10,513 --> 00:26:12,836
and now I will take it back!

1016
00:26:12,846 --> 00:26:12,838
&nbsp

1017
00:26:12,848 --> 00:26:15,072
The gorillas saw what you did, Flash.

1018
00:26:15,082 --> 00:26:15,074
&nbsp

1019
00:26:15,084 --> 00:26:17,241
They saw you defeat Solovar,

1020
00:26:17,251 --> 00:26:17,243
&nbsp

1021
00:26:17,253 --> 00:26:19,843
and now they are afraid of humans

1022
00:26:19,853 --> 00:26:19,845
&nbsp

1023
00:26:19,855 --> 00:26:21,828
and will do anything I order,

1024
00:26:21,838 --> 00:26:21,853
&nbsp

1025
00:26:21,863 --> 00:26:24,281
and I will order them
to invade your Earth,

1026
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:24,283
&nbsp

1027
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:25,983
and your city will burn.

1028
00:26:25,993 --> 00:26:25,985
&nbsp

1029
00:26:25,995 --> 00:26:27,651
You were planning this the whole time.

1030
00:26:27,661 --> 00:26:27,653
&nbsp

1031
00:26:27,663 --> 00:26:29,438
Yes.

1032
00:26:29,448 --> 00:26:30,289
&nbsp

1033
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:31,922
Father taught me well.

1034
00:26:31,932 --> 00:26:31,924
&nbsp

1035
00:26:31,934 --> 00:26:35,604
Always think ahead.

1036
00:26:35,614 --> 00:26:35,800
&nbsp

1037
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,128
And I had plenty of time to think

1038
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:38,130
&nbsp

1039
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,495
in cages built by you

1040
00:26:40,505 --> 00:26:40,520
&nbsp

1041
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,720
and then by Solovar.

1042
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:42,902
&nbsp

1043
00:26:42,912 --> 00:26:45,564
Then why don't you just kill us? Huh?

1044
00:26:45,574 --> 00:26:45,566
&nbsp

1045
00:26:45,576 --> 00:26:47,581
Since we already did your
damn dirty work for you.

1046
00:26:47,591 --> 00:26:47,606
&nbsp

1047
00:26:47,616 --> 00:26:48,972
Still need you.

1048
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:48,974
&nbsp

1049
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:50,574
I'm not doing anything for you.

1050
00:26:50,584 --> 00:26:50,576
&nbsp

1051
00:26:50,586 --> 00:26:52,454
Not you, Flash.

1052
00:26:52,464 --> 00:26:53,379
&nbsp

1053
00:26:53,389 --> 00:26:54,611
You.

1054
00:26:54,621 --> 00:26:58,050
&nbsp

1055
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,195
Me?

1056
00:26:59,205 --> 00:26:59,220
&nbsp

1057
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:02,722
You will open the breach to First Earth.

1058
00:27:02,732 --> 00:27:02,922
&nbsp

1059
00:27:02,932 --> 00:27:05,155
My army will cross that breach,

1060
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:05,157
&nbsp

1061
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:07,825
and all the humans in Central City

1062
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:07,827
&nbsp

1063
00:27:07,837 --> 00:27:10,921
will burn before Gorilla Kind!

1064
00:27:10,931 --> 00:27:11,330
&nbsp

1065
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,413
Grodd, you are smart,

1066
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,062
&nbsp

1067
00:27:14,072 --> 00:27:16,333
maybe smarter than all of us,

1068
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:16,335
&nbsp

1069
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:18,969
smart enough to know
that you cannot do this.

1070
00:27:18,979 --> 00:27:18,971
&nbsp

1071
00:27:18,981 --> 00:27:20,704
Intelligence and violence,

1072
00:27:20,714 --> 00:27:20,706
&nbsp

1073
00:27:20,716 --> 00:27:22,042
they're opposites from each other.

1074
00:27:22,052 --> 00:27:22,067
&nbsp

1075
00:27:22,077 --> 00:27:24,652
What you want to do, it's not logical,

1076
00:27:24,662 --> 00:27:24,677
&nbsp

1077
00:27:24,687 --> 00:27:27,292
not for someone as wise as you are.

1078
00:27:27,302 --> 00:27:27,870
&nbsp

1079
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,513
You forget, Flash,

1080
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:29,515
&nbsp

1081
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:31,014
I am an animal.

1082
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:31,016
&nbsp

1083
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:32,950
I am a gorilla.

1084
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:32,952
&nbsp

1085
00:27:32,962 --> 00:27:35,519
Kill or be killed!

1086
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:35,521
&nbsp

1087
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:37,654
I'm gonna get out of this
cell, and I'm gonna stop you.

1088
00:27:37,664 --> 00:27:43,873
&nbsp

1089
00:27:43,883 --> 00:27:46,808
No, you won't.

1090
00:27:46,818 --> 00:27:47,076
&nbsp

1091
00:27:47,086 --> 00:27:48,982
You will die.

1092
00:27:48,992 --> 00:28:10,044
&nbsp

1093
00:28:10,054 --> 00:28:12,078
- Snow?
- You okay?

1094
00:28:12,088 --> 00:28:12,081
&nbsp

1095
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:13,427
I...

1096
00:28:13,437 --> 00:28:14,083
&nbsp

1097
00:28:14,093 --> 00:28:16,550
I have a headache, I guess.

1098
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:16,552
&nbsp

1099
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:17,984
Ugh!

1100
00:28:17,994 --> 00:28:17,986
&nbsp

1101
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,386
And I think...

1102
00:28:19,396 --> 00:28:19,388
&nbsp

1103
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:21,086
I... is that me? I smell.

1104
00:28:21,096 --> 00:28:21,111
&nbsp

1105
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:22,823
That counts as okay.

1106
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:22,825
&nbsp

1107
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:24,291
Jesse, my daughter. Where's...

1108
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:24,293
&nbsp

1109
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:25,592
She's fine. She's on Earth-1.

1110
00:28:25,602 --> 00:28:25,594
&nbsp

1111
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:27,221
She's totally fine.

1112
00:28:27,231 --> 00:28:32,056
&nbsp

1113
00:28:32,066 --> 00:28:33,489
Barry?

1114
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:33,514
&nbsp

1115
00:28:33,524 --> 00:28:35,313
Cisco.

1116
00:28:35,323 --> 00:28:37,206
&nbsp

1117
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,973
You guys all came for me?

1118
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:38,998
&nbsp

1119
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:41,446
A city of evil genius apes.

1120
00:28:41,456 --> 00:28:41,914
&nbsp

1121
00:28:41,924 --> 00:28:43,176
Sounded like fun.

1122
00:28:43,186 --> 00:28:43,178
&nbsp

1123
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,414
Well, I don't deserve it, but...

1124
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:45,881
&nbsp

1125
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,602
thank you, Snow; thank you, Barry,

1126
00:28:48,612 --> 00:28:48,986
&nbsp

1127
00:28:48,996 --> 00:28:50,227
Cisco...

1128
00:28:50,237 --> 00:28:51,820
&nbsp

1129
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,244
Indiana.

1130
00:28:53,254 --> 00:28:55,057
&nbsp

1131
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,224
It's Julian Albert, thank you.

1132
00:28:57,234 --> 00:28:57,226
&nbsp

1133
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,072
And I came along for...

1134
00:28:59,082 --> 00:29:00,531
&nbsp

1135
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:01,931
I live for danger.

1136
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:01,956
&nbsp

1137
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:03,789
Looks like you came to the right place.

1138
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:03,790
&nbsp

1139
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,057
I still can't phase through the bars.

1140
00:29:06,067 --> 00:29:06,059
&nbsp

1141
00:29:06,069 --> 00:29:08,635
We have to find a way out
of here so we can stop him.

1142
00:29:08,645 --> 00:29:08,660
&nbsp

1143
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:11,562
You keep saying that, but
what if we can't get out?

1144
00:29:11,572 --> 00:29:11,564
&nbsp

1145
00:29:11,574 --> 00:29:13,440
What if we're stuck here?
What if this is the way...

1146
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:13,465
&nbsp

1147
00:29:13,475 --> 00:29:14,893
Well, we can't think like that.

1148
00:29:14,903 --> 00:29:18,149
&nbsp

1149
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,926
While there's life, there's hope.

1150
00:29:19,936 --> 00:29:21,922
&nbsp

1151
00:29:21,932 --> 00:29:23,541
And if there isn't life?

1152
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:23,543
&nbsp

1153
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,709
What is that supposed to mean?

1154
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:25,979
&nbsp

1155
00:29:25,989 --> 00:29:27,779
Grodd needs me to open the breach

1156
00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:27,804
&nbsp

1157
00:29:27,814 --> 00:29:28,928
so he can attack Earth-1.

1158
00:29:28,938 --> 00:29:28,953
&nbsp

1159
00:29:28,963 --> 00:29:30,920
What if I wasn't alive to do that?

1160
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:30,945
&nbsp

1161
00:29:30,955 --> 00:29:32,343
You planning on dying?

1162
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:32,368
&nbsp

1163
00:29:32,378 --> 00:29:33,936
Only if you kill me.

1164
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:35,285
&nbsp

1165
00:29:35,295 --> 00:29:38,631
Look, this is something
we have to consider.

1166
00:29:38,641 --> 00:29:38,656
&nbsp

1167
00:29:38,666 --> 00:29:40,599
Right now, I can't think of
any other way to stop them.

1168
00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:40,616
&nbsp

1169
00:29:40,626 --> 00:29:42,716
They'd have no other way
of getting to Central City.

1170
00:29:42,726 --> 00:29:42,718
&nbsp

1171
00:29:42,728 --> 00:29:44,024
He's right.

1172
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:44,353
&nbsp

1173
00:29:44,363 --> 00:29:46,320
Cisco's death would change

1174
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:46,345
&nbsp

1175
00:29:46,355 --> 00:29:48,329
the newspaper headline in the future.

1176
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:48,991
&nbsp

1177
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:50,758
- Headline?
- It's a long story.

1178
00:29:50,768 --> 00:29:50,783
&nbsp

1179
00:29:50,793 --> 00:29:53,550
But it would also make
another one come true,

1180
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:53,552
&nbsp

1181
00:29:53,562 --> 00:29:55,819
the one about Killer Frost.

1182
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:57,556
&nbsp

1183
00:29:57,566 --> 00:29:59,156
You want me to kill you?

1184
00:29:59,166 --> 00:29:59,158
&nbsp

1185
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,624
Think about it.

1186
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:00,626
&nbsp

1187
00:30:00,636 --> 00:30:02,099
Grodd doesn't know you have cold powers.

1188
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:02,124
&nbsp

1189
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,279
You might be able to use them.

1190
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:03,304
&nbsp

1191
00:30:03,314 --> 00:30:04,505
Cold powers?

1192
00:30:04,515 --> 00:30:04,530
&nbsp

1193
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,264
She... you have cold powers?

1194
00:30:07,274 --> 00:30:07,396
&nbsp

1195
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:09,533
I knew it. I knew that you and I

1196
00:30:09,543 --> 00:30:09,535
&nbsp

1197
00:30:09,545 --> 00:30:11,235
did not get Barry out of that mirror.

1198
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:11,237
&nbsp

1199
00:30:11,247 --> 00:30:13,036
Wait, now. Caitlin.

1200
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:13,038
&nbsp

1201
00:30:13,048 --> 00:30:14,605
If you kill someone,

1202
00:30:14,615 --> 00:30:14,607
&nbsp

1203
00:30:14,617 --> 00:30:16,206
there's no going back.

1204
00:30:16,216 --> 00:30:16,208
&nbsp

1205
00:30:16,218 --> 00:30:18,308
You'll be Killer Frost
for the rest of your life.

1206
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:18,310
&nbsp

1207
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,711
Now, I did not come all
this way to see that happen.

1208
00:30:20,721 --> 00:30:23,349
&nbsp

1209
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:25,705
Did you come here because
you "live for danger"

1210
00:30:25,715 --> 00:30:25,730
&nbsp

1211
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,085
or to protect me?

1212
00:30:28,095 --> 00:30:29,766
&nbsp

1213
00:30:29,776 --> 00:30:32,007
I just don't want to see you
become something you're not.

1214
00:30:32,017 --> 00:30:33,991
&nbsp

1215
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:35,218
Okay, Cisco.

1216
00:30:35,228 --> 00:30:35,249
&nbsp

1217
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:38,068
I'm not gonna kill you, and
neither is anyone else, okay?

1218
00:30:38,078 --> 00:30:38,093
&nbsp

1219
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:39,759
So let's come up with the next best plan

1220
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:39,761
&nbsp

1221
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,461
that doesn't involve
murdering one of our friends.

1222
00:30:41,471 --> 00:30:41,486
&nbsp

1223
00:30:41,496 --> 00:30:43,235
No, Cisco's right.

1224
00:30:43,245 --> 00:30:44,813
&nbsp

1225
00:30:44,823 --> 00:30:46,539
It's the only way.

1226
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:47,836
&nbsp

1227
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,843
One of us has to die.

1228
00:30:49,853 --> 00:31:00,223
&nbsp

1229
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,617
Ho!

1230
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:01,657
&nbsp

1231
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:02,718
Hey.

1232
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:02,743
&nbsp

1233
00:31:02,753 --> 00:31:04,518
Hi.

1234
00:31:04,528 --> 00:31:04,543
&nbsp

1235
00:31:04,553 --> 00:31:06,140
What you doing up there?

1236
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,089
&nbsp

1237
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:09,055
Just, uh, hanging out.

1238
00:31:09,065 --> 00:31:09,381
&nbsp

1239
00:31:09,391 --> 00:31:10,975
What're you... what're
you thinking about?

1240
00:31:10,985 --> 00:31:12,063
&nbsp

1241
00:31:12,073 --> 00:31:15,795
Wally. He wants me
to stay here with him.

1242
00:31:15,805 --> 00:31:15,820
&nbsp

1243
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,452
Ah.

1244
00:31:17,462 --> 00:31:17,632
&nbsp

1245
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:19,632
Yeah, he does.

1246
00:31:19,642 --> 00:31:19,634
&nbsp

1247
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,835
Guy is no dummy. Congratulations.

1248
00:31:21,845 --> 00:31:21,837
&nbsp

1249
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,672
Oh, that's great. Love...

1250
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:23,697
&nbsp

1251
00:31:23,707 --> 00:31:24,969
nothing like young love.

1252
00:31:24,979 --> 00:31:24,994
&nbsp

1253
00:31:25,004 --> 00:31:26,588
Yeah, I just... I don't...

1254
00:31:26,598 --> 00:31:26,813
&nbsp

1255
00:31:26,823 --> 00:31:29,042
I don't know if it's the right thing.

1256
00:31:29,052 --> 00:31:29,044
&nbsp

1257
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,313
Why?

1258
00:31:30,323 --> 00:31:30,338
&nbsp

1259
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:32,438
He's on his own journey.

1260
00:31:32,448 --> 00:31:32,463
&nbsp

1261
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:35,531
Besides, my dad just
got captured by gorillas.

1262
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:35,556
&nbsp

1263
00:31:35,566 --> 00:31:37,189
And if... if he does come back,

1264
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:37,214
&nbsp

1265
00:31:37,224 --> 00:31:39,110
how could I ever tell him I'm leaving?

1266
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,135
&nbsp

1267
00:31:39,145 --> 00:31:40,680
Well, 'cause you're human.

1268
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:40,712
&nbsp

1269
00:31:40,722 --> 00:31:42,977
That's... that's how. That's what we do.

1270
00:31:42,987 --> 00:31:42,985
&nbsp

1271
00:31:42,995 --> 00:31:44,217
Look, my point is this.

1272
00:31:44,227 --> 00:31:44,219
&nbsp

1273
00:31:44,229 --> 00:31:45,519
When it comes to love,

1274
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:45,521
&nbsp

1275
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:47,702
you got to go for it.

1276
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:47,727
&nbsp

1277
00:31:47,737 --> 00:31:49,623
You know? Everything else be damned.

1278
00:31:49,633 --> 00:31:49,625
&nbsp

1279
00:31:49,635 --> 00:31:51,358
'Cause if you don't,

1280
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:51,360
&nbsp

1281
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,160
you're gonna end up being
the kind of person that lives

1282
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:53,607
&nbsp

1283
00:31:53,617 --> 00:31:56,708
the rest of their life with regret.

1284
00:31:56,718 --> 00:31:56,838
&nbsp

1285
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,765
I mean, I know that telling your
dad that, you know, you're...

1286
00:31:58,775 --> 00:31:58,767
&nbsp

1287
00:31:58,777 --> 00:32:00,252
you're switching Earths,

1288
00:32:00,262 --> 00:32:00,277
&nbsp

1289
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:02,736
that's gonna be a difficult
conversation to have,

1290
00:32:02,746 --> 00:32:02,738
&nbsp

1291
00:32:02,748 --> 00:32:04,877
but one that you've to go for...

1292
00:32:04,887 --> 00:32:04,902
&nbsp

1293
00:32:04,912 --> 00:32:06,907
if you want to be happy.

1294
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:07,050
&nbsp

1295
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,076
But that's, you know, just my opinion.

1296
00:32:09,086 --> 00:32:09,078
&nbsp

1297
00:32:09,088 --> 00:32:10,444
What do I know?

1298
00:32:10,454 --> 00:32:10,446
&nbsp

1299
00:32:10,456 --> 00:32:13,237
I'm just a handsomer guy than your dad

1300
00:32:13,247 --> 00:32:13,262
&nbsp

1301
00:32:13,272 --> 00:32:15,722
with a song in his
heart. Good luck, Jesse.

1302
00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:39,899
&nbsp

1303
00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:43,245
He started coughing... violently.

1304
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:43,800
&nbsp

1305
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:46,134
And then he clutched
his side and keeled over.

1306
00:32:46,144 --> 00:32:47,481
&nbsp

1307
00:32:47,491 --> 00:32:49,245
The injury...

1308
00:32:49,255 --> 00:32:49,632
&nbsp

1309
00:32:49,642 --> 00:32:51,665
it must have ruptured
one of his kidneys.

1310
00:32:51,675 --> 00:32:53,469
&nbsp

1311
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:55,215
He went into shock.

1312
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:55,731
&nbsp

1313
00:32:55,741 --> 00:32:57,582
His heart stopped.

1314
00:32:57,592 --> 00:32:58,974
&nbsp

1315
00:32:58,984 --> 00:33:00,941
I couldn't resuscitate him.

1316
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:07,930
&nbsp

1317
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,791
Cold.

1318
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:11,590
&nbsp

1319
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,663
He's dead.

1320
00:33:12,673 --> 00:33:14,790
&nbsp

1321
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,854
He was of no use to me anyway.

1322
00:33:17,864 --> 00:33:42,619
&nbsp

1323
00:33:42,629 --> 00:33:44,267
He's gone, Barry.

1324
00:33:44,277 --> 00:33:45,321
&nbsp

1325
00:33:45,331 --> 00:33:46,750
Grodd is gone.

1326
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:57,024
&nbsp

1327
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:58,744
Come on, mate.

1328
00:33:58,754 --> 00:34:09,839
&nbsp

1329
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:11,345
Yo, it worked!

1330
00:34:11,355 --> 00:34:11,347
&nbsp

1331
00:34:11,357 --> 00:34:12,713
Shh!

1332
00:34:12,723 --> 00:34:12,715
&nbsp

1333
00:34:12,725 --> 00:34:13,775
It worked.

1334
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:13,800
&nbsp

1335
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,603
Allen, Allen, you all right, mate?

1336
00:34:15,613 --> 00:34:15,628
&nbsp

1337
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:17,862
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

1338
00:34:17,872 --> 00:34:17,887
&nbsp

1339
00:34:17,897 --> 00:34:19,620
I didn't freeze you too much, did I?

1340
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,590
&nbsp

1341
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,877
No. I'm good.

1342
00:34:23,887 --> 00:34:23,902
&nbsp

1343
00:34:23,912 --> 00:34:25,501
Well, then...

1344
00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:25,535
&nbsp

1345
00:34:25,545 --> 00:34:27,002
let's get the hell out of here.

1346
00:34:27,012 --> 00:34:27,027
&nbsp

1347
00:34:27,037 --> 00:34:28,095
Yeah.

1348
00:34:28,105 --> 00:34:36,282
&nbsp

1349
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:37,781
Go!

1350
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:37,806
&nbsp

1351
00:34:37,816 --> 00:34:40,240
- All right.
- Hallelujah.

1352
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:43,126
&nbsp

1353
00:34:43,136 --> 00:34:44,388
Let's go.

1354
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:51,165
&nbsp

1355
00:34:51,175 --> 00:34:52,216
All right.

1356
00:34:52,226 --> 00:34:52,241
&nbsp

1357
00:34:52,251 --> 00:34:54,101
We should be far enough out that you
should be able to use your powers.

1358
00:34:54,111 --> 00:34:54,126
&nbsp

1359
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:56,093
- We need a breach open right now.
- Guys, we got to go

1360
00:34:56,103 --> 00:34:56,118
&nbsp

1361
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,062
before they realize we're gone!

1362
00:34:58,072 --> 00:34:58,087
&nbsp

1363
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:00,225
It's too late for that.

1364
00:35:00,235 --> 00:35:00,780
&nbsp

1365
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,374
- Run!
- Run!

1366
00:35:02,384 --> 00:35:02,629
&nbsp

1367
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,462
Open a breach!

1368
00:35:04,472 --> 00:35:04,830
&nbsp

1369
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,510
Time to warp out of this madhouse.

1370
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,042
&nbsp

1371
00:35:08,052 --> 00:35:09,675
All right, go.

1372
00:35:09,685 --> 00:35:30,020
&nbsp

1373
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,721
Hey, gang, who wants to take
their mind off their troubles

1374
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:32,746
&nbsp

1375
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:35,324
with a "sure to take your mind off
your troubles" game of charades?

1376
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:35,349
&nbsp

1377
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,455
I'll go first. Okay.

1378
00:35:36,465 --> 00:35:36,480
&nbsp

1379
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,569
Ah, let's see. Movie... I mean...

1380
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:38,686
&nbsp

1381
00:35:38,696 --> 00:35:39,897
one word.

1382
00:35:39,907 --> 00:35:44,765
&nbsp

1383
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:46,210
Dad!

1384
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,614
&nbsp

1385
00:35:50,624 --> 00:35:51,780
Aww.

1386
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:51,782
&nbsp

1387
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:54,205
- You okay?
- Good, yeah.

1388
00:35:54,215 --> 00:35:54,230
&nbsp

1389
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,705
I'm sorry you guys missed it.

1390
00:35:55,715 --> 00:35:55,730
&nbsp

1391
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,996
I ain't.

1392
00:35:57,006 --> 00:35:57,021
&nbsp

1393
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:58,493
Ohhh.

1394
00:35:58,503 --> 00:35:58,518
&nbsp

1395
00:35:58,528 --> 00:36:00,151
Word of advice:

1396
00:36:00,161 --> 00:36:00,176
&nbsp

1397
00:36:00,186 --> 00:36:02,249
don't volunteer for these things.

1398
00:36:02,259 --> 00:36:02,274
&nbsp

1399
00:36:02,284 --> 00:36:03,836
Nothing ever tries to
rip you limb from limb

1400
00:36:03,846 --> 00:36:03,861
&nbsp

1401
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:04,915
if you don't volunteer.

1402
00:36:04,925 --> 00:36:04,940
&nbsp

1403
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:07,673
I'm fine. I'm so fine, thanks...

1404
00:36:07,683 --> 00:36:07,698
&nbsp

1405
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,264
thanks to our friends,

1406
00:36:09,274 --> 00:36:09,266
&nbsp

1407
00:36:09,276 --> 00:36:10,860
our good friends.

1408
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:10,977
&nbsp

1409
00:36:10,987 --> 00:36:12,109
You're welcome, Harry.

1410
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:12,134
&nbsp

1411
00:36:12,144 --> 00:36:14,079
Wow, I... I think...

1412
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:14,104
&nbsp

1413
00:36:14,114 --> 00:36:15,950
I just forgot how handsome you were.

1414
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:15,975
&nbsp

1415
00:36:15,985 --> 00:36:17,856
Oh, I forgot.

1416
00:36:17,866 --> 00:36:17,881
&nbsp

1417
00:36:17,891 --> 00:36:19,975
He's... you're still here.

1418
00:36:19,985 --> 00:36:19,977
&nbsp

1419
00:36:19,987 --> 00:36:21,208
Yeah.

1420
00:36:21,218 --> 00:36:21,233
&nbsp

1421
00:36:21,243 --> 00:36:22,380
Still here.

1422
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:22,405
&nbsp

1423
00:36:22,415 --> 00:36:26,189
I guess we have your
tactical and technical genius

1424
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:26,214
&nbsp

1425
00:36:26,224 --> 00:36:28,599
to thank for getting us out of that fix.

1426
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:28,624
&nbsp

1427
00:36:28,634 --> 00:36:31,130
No, no, nah.

1428
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:31,161
&nbsp

1429
00:36:31,171 --> 00:36:32,466
Nah?

1430
00:36:32,476 --> 00:36:32,491
&nbsp

1431
00:36:32,501 --> 00:36:33,655
Nah.

1432
00:36:33,665 --> 00:36:33,657
&nbsp

1433
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:34,872
You were completely right about him.

1434
00:36:34,882 --> 00:36:34,897
&nbsp

1435
00:36:34,907 --> 00:36:37,069
He's a total fraud. He's
not even a scientist.

1436
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:37,094
&nbsp

1437
00:36:37,104 --> 00:36:39,474
And I'm sure you couldn't even
remember an ATM code if you tried.

1438
00:36:39,484 --> 00:36:39,499
&nbsp

1439
00:36:39,509 --> 00:36:41,282
All those... all those numbers.

1440
00:36:41,292 --> 00:36:41,353
&nbsp

1441
00:36:41,363 --> 00:36:43,852
It's only four digits.
Why is he still here?

1442
00:36:43,862 --> 00:36:43,884
&nbsp

1443
00:36:43,894 --> 00:36:47,355
Because we couldn't do it without him.

1444
00:36:47,365 --> 00:36:47,688
&nbsp

1445
00:36:47,698 --> 00:36:49,721
I thank you, Francisco.

1446
00:36:49,731 --> 00:36:49,909
&nbsp

1447
00:36:49,919 --> 00:36:51,256
Fran... Francisco?

1448
00:36:51,266 --> 00:36:51,258
&nbsp

1449
00:36:51,268 --> 00:36:52,457
Don't ask.

1450
00:36:52,467 --> 00:36:52,459
&nbsp

1451
00:36:52,469 --> 00:36:53,534
Yo, so what actually happened?

1452
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:53,559
&nbsp

1453
00:36:53,569 --> 00:36:55,838
You fight some really
super-smart apes, or what?

1454
00:36:55,848 --> 00:36:55,863
&nbsp

1455
00:36:55,873 --> 00:36:57,889
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

1456
00:36:57,899 --> 00:36:57,914
&nbsp

1457
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,545
And they were smart,
but today, at least,

1458
00:37:00,555 --> 00:37:00,801
&nbsp

1459
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:02,561
we were a bit smarter.

1460
00:37:02,571 --> 00:37:17,755
&nbsp

1461
00:37:17,765 --> 00:37:19,084
How's he doing?

1462
00:37:19,094 --> 00:37:19,086
&nbsp

1463
00:37:19,096 --> 00:37:21,286
He's gonna be okay.

1464
00:37:21,296 --> 00:37:22,926
&nbsp

1465
00:37:22,936 --> 00:37:24,890
He's got some cuts and bruises,

1466
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:24,892
&nbsp

1467
00:37:24,902 --> 00:37:28,059
but Caitlin said he just
needs food and a little sleep.

1468
00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:28,084
&nbsp

1469
00:37:28,094 --> 00:37:29,465
Okay.

1470
00:37:29,475 --> 00:37:29,830
&nbsp

1471
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,597
Hey, I'm...

1472
00:37:31,607 --> 00:37:31,599
&nbsp

1473
00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:35,534
I'm sorry for being an
epic basket case lately.

1474
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:35,559
&nbsp

1475
00:37:35,569 --> 00:37:38,770
My, um... my dad was kidnapped once,

1476
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:38,772
&nbsp

1477
00:37:38,782 --> 00:37:40,973
and it turns your world.

1478
00:37:40,983 --> 00:37:42,302
&nbsp

1479
00:37:42,312 --> 00:37:45,423
You turn my world, Wally.

1480
00:37:45,433 --> 00:37:46,413
&nbsp

1481
00:37:46,423 --> 00:37:49,844
Look, I... I need you to
be honest about something.

1482
00:37:49,854 --> 00:37:50,414
&nbsp

1483
00:37:50,424 --> 00:37:51,664
Of course.

1484
00:37:51,674 --> 00:37:52,719
&nbsp

1485
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:54,313
When my dad wakes up,

1486
00:37:54,323 --> 00:37:54,338
&nbsp

1487
00:37:54,348 --> 00:37:56,989
if I tell him that I love him

1488
00:37:56,999 --> 00:37:56,991
&nbsp

1489
00:37:57,001 --> 00:37:59,524
and I'll always be his daughter

1490
00:37:59,534 --> 00:37:59,526
&nbsp

1491
00:37:59,536 --> 00:38:03,180
but that I want to move to Earth-1,

1492
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:03,891
&nbsp

1493
00:38:03,901 --> 00:38:05,342
what would you think about...

1494
00:38:05,352 --> 00:38:11,633
&nbsp

1495
00:38:11,643 --> 00:38:13,491
That's what I think.

1496
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:14,675
&nbsp

1497
00:38:14,685 --> 00:38:17,109
I'm glad we think alike.

1498
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,506
&nbsp

1499
00:38:19,516 --> 00:38:21,079
I see you're...

1500
00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:21,081
&nbsp

1501
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,717
you took my love advice.

1502
00:38:22,727 --> 00:38:22,742
&nbsp

1503
00:38:22,752 --> 00:38:24,483
You know, when it comes
to scientific advice,

1504
00:38:24,493 --> 00:38:24,485
&nbsp

1505
00:38:24,495 --> 00:38:26,118
mine is sometimes specious,

1506
00:38:26,128 --> 00:38:26,120
&nbsp

1507
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,519
but when it comes to
affairs of the heart,

1508
00:38:27,529 --> 00:38:27,521
&nbsp

1509
00:38:27,531 --> 00:38:30,422
well, I consider myself a genius.

1510
00:38:30,432 --> 00:38:30,424
&nbsp

1511
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:31,746
Okay, yeah, we're gonna go now.

1512
00:38:31,756 --> 00:38:31,771
&nbsp

1513
00:38:31,781 --> 00:38:32,800
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1514
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:32,825
&nbsp

1515
00:38:32,835 --> 00:38:34,363
Okay, great.

1516
00:38:34,373 --> 00:38:34,828
&nbsp

1517
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:37,543
Congratulations. I'm happy for you.

1518
00:38:37,553 --> 00:38:37,568
&nbsp

1519
00:38:37,578 --> 00:38:39,064
Invite me to the wedding.

1520
00:38:39,074 --> 00:38:42,169
&nbsp

1521
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:44,269
He's gonna be so pissed.

1522
00:38:44,279 --> 00:38:48,156
&nbsp

1523
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:49,734
Caitlin.

1524
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:49,876
&nbsp

1525
00:38:49,886 --> 00:38:51,500
Wait.

1526
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,480
&nbsp

1527
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:56,215
Listen, if I overstepped, then...

1528
00:38:56,225 --> 00:38:56,240
&nbsp

1529
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,016
I apologize.

1530
00:38:58,026 --> 00:38:58,018
&nbsp

1531
00:38:58,028 --> 00:38:59,566
Just, after drinks the other night...

1532
00:38:59,576 --> 00:38:59,591
&nbsp

1533
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:02,519
You were willing to
risk your life for me?

1534
00:39:02,529 --> 00:39:03,390
&nbsp

1535
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,909
I've been doing a lot
of silly things recently.

1536
00:39:05,919 --> 00:39:05,934
&nbsp

1537
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:08,260
I thought adding one more to
the list wouldn't do any harm.

1538
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:08,262
&nbsp

1539
00:39:08,272 --> 00:39:10,425
I like you, Julian. I do.

1540
00:39:10,435 --> 00:39:10,450
&nbsp

1541
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,117
And I like that you like me.

1542
00:39:13,127 --> 00:39:13,367
&nbsp

1543
00:39:13,377 --> 00:39:15,500
But I'm also afraid of my powers...

1544
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:15,502
&nbsp

1545
00:39:15,512 --> 00:39:17,402
and not what they could do to me,

1546
00:39:17,412 --> 00:39:17,404
&nbsp

1547
00:39:17,414 --> 00:39:20,439
but what they could do to
anyone who gets close to me.

1548
00:39:20,449 --> 00:39:20,557
&nbsp

1549
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:23,026
- Caitlin, I'm not afraid.
- You should be.

1550
00:39:23,036 --> 00:39:23,195
&nbsp

1551
00:39:23,205 --> 00:39:25,362
Fear me, Julian.

1552
00:39:25,372 --> 00:39:25,646
&nbsp

1553
00:39:25,656 --> 00:39:28,080
It's not a threat, just...

1554
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:28,255
&nbsp

1555
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:29,621
good advice.

1556
00:39:29,631 --> 00:39:32,437
&nbsp

1557
00:39:32,447 --> 00:39:35,053
Okay, fine.

1558
00:39:35,063 --> 00:39:35,055
&nbsp

1559
00:39:35,065 --> 00:39:36,607
I'll fear you.

1560
00:39:36,617 --> 00:39:37,812
&nbsp

1561
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:41,159
You know what really
helps me when I'm scared?

1562
00:39:41,169 --> 00:39:41,161
&nbsp

1563
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:42,728
What?

1564
00:39:42,738 --> 00:39:42,730
&nbsp

1565
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,101
Just a good fillet steak...

1566
00:39:45,111 --> 00:39:45,351
&nbsp

1567
00:39:45,361 --> 00:39:47,566
bit of béarnaise on the side,

1568
00:39:47,576 --> 00:39:47,568
&nbsp

1569
00:39:47,578 --> 00:39:49,656
mashed potatoes... does
the trick ever time.

1570
00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:49,681
&nbsp

1571
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:51,369
- Really?
- I promise.

1572
00:39:51,379 --> 00:39:51,371
&nbsp

1573
00:39:51,381 --> 00:39:53,071
I think we should find
a local steak house

1574
00:39:53,081 --> 00:39:53,073
&nbsp

1575
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:56,708
and be terrified together.

1576
00:39:56,718 --> 00:39:58,112
&nbsp

1577
00:39:58,122 --> 00:40:00,495
Sure. Together it is.

1578
00:40:00,505 --> 00:40:08,922
&nbsp

1579
00:40:08,932 --> 00:40:11,048
- Well...
- Hmm.

1580
00:40:11,058 --> 00:40:11,859
&nbsp

1581
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:13,743
- We did it.
- You did it.

1582
00:40:13,753 --> 00:40:13,768
&nbsp

1583
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:17,069
No, uh, we all did it.

1584
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:17,094
&nbsp

1585
00:40:17,104 --> 00:40:21,998
We changed the future
without changing who we are.

1586
00:40:22,008 --> 00:40:22,273
&nbsp

1587
00:40:22,283 --> 00:40:24,178
If we can keep doing this,

1588
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:24,204
&nbsp

1589
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:25,904
we can stop Savitar.

1590
00:40:25,914 --> 00:40:26,060
&nbsp

1591
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,943
Wherever he is, however
he's gonna come at us,

1592
00:40:27,953 --> 00:40:27,968
&nbsp

1593
00:40:27,978 --> 00:40:29,300
I can stop him.

1594
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:29,325
&nbsp

1595
00:40:29,335 --> 00:40:30,758
I know it now.

1596
00:40:30,768 --> 00:40:30,911
&nbsp

1597
00:40:30,921 --> 00:40:32,245
How do you do that?

1598
00:40:32,255 --> 00:40:32,270
&nbsp

1599
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,345
Do what?

1600
00:40:33,355 --> 00:40:33,347
&nbsp

1601
00:40:33,357 --> 00:40:36,323
Stay positive in the
face of overwhelming odds.

1602
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:39,339
&nbsp

1603
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:42,373
Because I plan on living
a long life with you,

1604
00:40:42,383 --> 00:40:42,422
&nbsp

1605
00:40:42,432 --> 00:40:44,689
and nothing's gonna
take that away from me.

1606
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:44,691
&nbsp

1607
00:40:44,701 --> 00:40:46,491
Good.

1608
00:40:46,501 --> 00:40:48,434
&nbsp

1609
00:40:48,444 --> 00:40:50,228
So does that mean no more nightmares?

1610
00:40:50,238 --> 00:40:50,230
&nbsp

1611
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,798
You're finally gonna
get some sleep tonight?

1612
00:40:52,808 --> 00:40:52,823
&nbsp

1613
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:56,593
Well... that last part
is entirely up to you.

1614
00:40:56,603 --> 00:40:56,703
&nbsp

1615
00:40:56,713 --> 00:40:58,537
Oh.

1616
00:40:58,547 --> 00:41:08,723
&nbsp

1617
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:10,854
Like I told Flash,

1618
00:41:10,864 --> 00:41:10,879
&nbsp

1619
00:41:10,889 --> 00:41:13,112
always think ahead.

1620
00:41:13,122 --> 00:41:13,295
&nbsp

1621
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:16,296
Now you will open the breaches

1622
00:41:16,306 --> 00:41:16,440
&nbsp

1623
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:18,307
and very soon,

1624
00:41:18,317 --> 00:41:18,332
&nbsp

1625
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:23,338
Central City will fall before Grodd.

1626
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:27,557
