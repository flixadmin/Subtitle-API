1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,680
Uncle Frank, maybe you wanna tell me
where the hell you've been

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,080
- since I was a kid?
- The Court has a secret society.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,760
If it's so secret,
how do you know about them?

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,360
Your father and I
were both members.

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,720
He was a drunk driver.
I watched him die.

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,960
My brother was making trouble
and they killed him.

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,440
One cannot deny a love.

9
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,960
I don't love you.

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,080
Look who's alive.

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,920
I just remembered there's someone
I need to kill.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,080
The clone is in place.

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,440
- What about Bruce Wayne?
- He should be waking up

14
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,520
as we speak.

15
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,200
I've always done whatever
the court has asked of me.

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,200
- What are you telling me?
- The city is on the brink of chaos.

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,360
Seems like judgement came to Gotham
earlier than expected.

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,280
Members of the Ruling Council,
Gotham has fallen ill.

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,240
Violence and crime continue to spread
like an unstoppable disease.

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,720
Drastic action must be taken.

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,080
To that end,

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,640
a weapon is being built.

23
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,160
A weapon intended
to be unleashed on Gotham

24
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,680
so that the city may be cleansed
and rebuilt by us.

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,280
The Head of our Court asks
that we reach

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,600
a unanimous vote to proceed.

27
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,840
Judgement has been passed.

28
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,160
Gotham must fall.

29
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,000
{\an5}I want to speak
with whoever's in charge.

30
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,240
{\an5}That would be me.

31
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,720
{\an5}Is the Court of Owls
behind my abduction?

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,320
{\an5}The Court is a tool. Nothing more.

33
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,080
{\an5}You can't get away with this.

34
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,800
{\an5}People will know I'm gone.

35
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,560
{\an5}We've taken precautions to ensure
your absence won't be noticed.

36
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
{\an5}My clone.

37
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,600
{\an5}He's in Gotham pretending
to be me, isn't he?

38
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,920
{\an5}Alfred will figure it out.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,160
{\an5}Perhaps.

40
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,640
{\an5}But by that time,

41
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,960
{\an5}I'm hoping
we've accomplished our goals.

42
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
Which is what?

43
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,280
{\an5}I need your help, Bruce.

44
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
{\an5}Eat.

45
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,360
{\an5}You're going to need your strength.

46
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,560
{\an5}We'll begin soon.

47
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,080
{\an5}<i>Aubrey James about...</i>

48
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,360
{\an5}All right, come on people, come on.

49
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,360
{\an5}Let's get back to work.
Joe, shut that off.

50
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,560
Can you believe this nonsense?

51
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,800
After all that's said and done,
who's back in charge?

52
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,000
{\an5}Aubrey James.
The original crook himself.

53
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,520
{\an5}How was the cabin?

54
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,880
{\an5}- What?
- You and your uncle,

55
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,880
{\an5}you must
have had a lot to catch up on.

56
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,440
{\an5}Oh, yeah.

57
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,040
{\an5}Any word on Nygma?

58
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,520
{\an5}No, but after gassing the cadets

59
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,600
and dangling me over an empty
stairwell, he just disappeared.

60
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,280
No, riddles, puzzles
or singing telegrams yet.

61
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,160
Who's Michael Ness?

62
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,480
The drunk driver

63
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,680
who hit and killed my father
when I was nine.

64
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,960
I think what my uncle said
got me thinking.

65
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,000
- What do you got?
- Not much.

66
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,520
He was convicted of vehicular
manslaughter, got six years.

67
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,720
Then got his ticket punched
in a prison stabbing a few months in.

68
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,560
- Silver lining.
- Yeah.

69
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,920
But I pulled his medical file
from Blackgate

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,520
and found something that wasn't
in the original case file.

71
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,040
He had chronic persistent hepatitis.

72
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,000
I was gonna ask Lee what it was
when she got in.

73
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,640
Chronic persistent hepatitis
is a non-progressive form

74
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,440
of liver inflammation.

75
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,560
- How do you know that?
- You kidding?

76
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,040
It's known as the Irish Curse.

77
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,520
With chronic inflammation,
you cannot drink.

78
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,520
Nothing. Not a drop. Not even beer.

79
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Well, this guy didn't get the memo.
His blood alcohol was off

80
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,840
the charts the night of the accident.

81
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,640
You're not hearing me, if this guy
had chronic liver inflammation,

82
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,880
if he blew a 0.1
on a blood-alcohol test,

83
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,280
he'd be dead
before he got behind the wheel.

84
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,880
If that's true, then someone
dummied up the report.

85
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,080
- Can you do some digging?
- Yeah.

86
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,360
- Find out who this guy was.
- Sure, but...

87
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,160
Hey, where you going?

88
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,520
Pretty cool?

89
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,080
I told you, the whole estate
was abandoned. Can you believe it?

90
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,640
As a matter of fact, I can.

91
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,960
You know,
the fresh air will do you good.

92
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,040
It smells like rotting death in here.

93
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,640
- I think someone's hungry, daisy.
- Stop it!

94
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,040
I told you I am fine.

95
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,280
I'm a grown man for crying out loud!

96
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,040
And you're hungry.

97
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,080
What's with you and all the plants?

98
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,760
They're my friends.

99
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,360
Your friends?

100
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,440
- Yeah.
- Wonderful.

101
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,920
You know, plants make better
friends than most people.

102
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,680
And some of them
helped save your life.

103
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,080
It's broth.

104
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,000
I even put in some White Willow
for your fever.

105
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,120
What is wrong with you?

106
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,960
For the millionth time,
I need to get back to Gotham.

107
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,400
What's the rush?

108
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,720
I was betrayed and shot.

109
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,320
I should be plotting my revenge.
Building an army.

110
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,880
Not drinking pinecone juice
with the crazy plant-lady.

111
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,080
So? Build an army.
No one's stopping you.

112
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,000
And I can even help
if you weren't being such a jerk.

113
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,600
Jerk.

114
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,280
Fine.

115
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,400
I need you to deliver a message
to Gabe.

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,040
Who's Gabe?

117
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,240
He's a moron.

118
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,920
But he's a loyal moron.

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,640
And every army starts
with one single loyal soldier.

120
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,520
"Please."

121
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,560
Please.

122
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay. Fine.

123
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,200
Thank you for meeting me.

124
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,560
Why here?

125
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,160
It's public, open, easy to spot
if anyone was watching us.

126
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,600
The driver who hit my father's
car that night wasn't drunk.

127
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,480
I think he did it on purpose

128
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,400
and someone made it look
like an accident.

129
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,880
Easy enough for The Court.

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,480
So let's assume I believe you.

131
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,000
What do you want from me?

132
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,720
I've just learned something
I'm still having trouble believing.

133
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,400
A weapon is en route,
headed for Gotham.

134
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,200
A weapon the Court intends to use
to destroy the city.

135
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,560
What are you talking about?

136
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,880
You said The Court controls Gotham.
Why would they wanna destroy it?

137
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,640
This isn't The Court as a whole.

138
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,000
It's a limited to a number
of high-ranking members.

139
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,880
Fanatics who believe
the city needs to be cleansed.

140
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,840
And you really think
they're capable of this?

141
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,600
They've done it before.

142
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,560
Twice in the city's history
they've laid waste to Gotham.

143
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,520
It's no bluff.

144
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,120
So, how do we stop it?

145
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,920
I have no idea.

146
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,640
I don't even know
what the weapon is.

147
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,080
But that's exactly
what I'm going to find out.

148
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,600
- I can help.
- No.

149
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,800
The Court knows
I reached out to you but that's all.

150
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,280
We need to keep it that way.

151
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,480
In case I'm discovered.

152
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,360
Be careful, Uncle Frank.

153
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,440
Sorry, I didn't mean to intrude.

154
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,680
I saw you earlier.

155
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,160
Who was that man you were with?

156
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,200
My uncle Frank.

157
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,720
I thought you two were estranged?

158
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,440
We recently reconnected.

159
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Good for you.

160
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,280
I've been coming here a lot.

161
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,200
The other day,
I saw this little old man,

162
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,800
must have been in his 90's.

163
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,000
All dressed up.

164
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,280
Standing in front of his wife's
grave, smiling.

165
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,480
I couldn't understand
what there was to smile about.

166
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,960
And then it occurred to me...

167
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,480
...they shared a whole life together.

168
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,760
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,440
How do you do that?

170
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,120
How do you just move on

171
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,520
leaving so much destruction
in your wake?

172
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,720
I wish I could do that.

173
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,960
- Yeah?
<i>- Hey.</i>

174
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,960
That driver that hit and killed
your father that night

175
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,560
was a career scumbag.

176
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
<i>What'd you find out?</i>

177
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,920
He did a stretch for Grand Theft Auto
among other things.

178
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,840
<i>And get this, a high-priced
lawyer who got him his plea</i>

179
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,400
was paid for by none other
than Carmine Falcone.

180
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,800
Okay. That's...

181
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,520
Easy. Okay, that's enough.

182
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,120
Boss, I can't believe it.

183
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,520
You know, that everyone
thinks you're dead?

184
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,360
- Yes.
- And that Barbara is running things?

185
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,440
Gabe. This might go faster
if you just listened.

186
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,960
I need to build an army
to exact my revenge

187
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,720
and to take back my throne,
will you help me?

188
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,040
Of course, I will.

189
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,440
When the guys hear
that you're still alive,

190
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,520
they'll come running.

191
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,800
I'll make sure of it.
What do you want me to do?

192
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,120
That!
I want you to do that, Gabe.

193
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,120
Right. I got it. No problem.

194
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,680
<i>Hey, Saul.</i>

195
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,440
There's something off about him.

196
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,720
No argument there.

197
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,120
I don't trust him.

198
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Gabe?

199
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,920
He's a human Labrador.

200
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,160
You whistle, he comes running.
Trust me. He's loyal.

201
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,960
I have this perfume.

202
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,360
One whiff,
and a man will do anything I ask.

203
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,000
Including telling the truth.

204
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,880
Look, now that Gabe is here

205
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,360
I'm afraid this is
where we part ways.

206
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,600
I have an army to build,
a war to plan.

207
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,800
And we really do not know
each other that well.

208
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
You understand?

209
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,360
No.

210
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,480
Maybe you can ask one of your plants.

211
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,000
I do not trust you.

212
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,320
I saved your life.

213
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,880
My men are on the way.

214
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,480
You trust him?

215
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,720
But I...
I thought we were friends?

216
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,040
Friends?

217
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,880
You're being serious.

218
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,160
Look, don't take this the wrong way,
but you are a bit of a freak.

219
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,200
Did she tell you not to trust me?

220
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,280
Yeah.

221
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,480
Why?

222
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,360
Smart girl.

223
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,400
Shall we begin?

224
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,880
The temple is some sort of maze,
is that it?

225
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,840
Everything is a maze, Bruce.

226
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,320
The only difference is whether
we realize our place within it.

227
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,560
Given enough time,
I will find a way out.

228
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,120
How much time?

229
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,920
How long have you been
blindly running down the corridors

230
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,200
of your life only to end up
in the same place?

231
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,840
It's time to pick a direction.

232
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,360
You can speak in cryptic riddles
all you want.

233
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,560
I'm not scared of you.

234
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,960
But you are scared of something,
aren't you?

235
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,920
Sit.

236
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,080
Let me show you
what I have to offer.

237
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,040
You have some nerve
showing up here.

238
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,880
We need to talk. Alone.

239
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,400
No. We don't.
You took my son from me.

240
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,800
And you took my father
away from me.

241
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,000
I'd say that makes us even.

242
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,080
Your father was killed
by a drunk driver.

243
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
No, he wasn't, driver wasn't drunk.

244
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,680
He hit us on purpose.
But I think you know that

245
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,560
because you paid for his lawyer.

246
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,120
Still think we have nothing
to talk about?

247
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,280
If you have a question for me,
son...

248
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,720
...why not go ahead and ask it.

249
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,000
Did you order the hit on my father?

250
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,120
No.

251
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,360
I respected your father.

252
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,280
Much more than the son
he left behind.

253
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,560
But someone did.

254
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,000
It was a hit?

255
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,880
Yes.

256
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,560
The Court of Owls.

257
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,720
What do you know about them?

258
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,680
I know my uncle is a member.

259
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,040
- Are you?
- No.

260
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,520
But we've built a partnership

261
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,520
which has been mutually
beneficial over the years.

262
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,000
You mean, you do their bidding.

263
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,040
Everyone does
The Court's bidding.

264
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,440
Some of us just know it.

265
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,560
The person who came to you...

266
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,920
...a member of The Court?

267
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,800
- Yes.
- Who was it?

268
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,920
Who ordered dead on my father?

269
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,760
I want a name.

270
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,160
Frank Gordon.

271
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,280
Your uncle.

272
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,000
Hello, Jim.

273
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,360
I thought we could use a drink.

274
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,920
Is it true?

275
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,760
Did you order the hit on my father?

276
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,640
Carmine called
The Court after you left.

277
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,880
You shouldn't have gone there.

278
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,520
It will raise suspicions.

279
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,840
Is it true?

280
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,120
Yes.

281
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,960
Why?

282
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,280
I already told you.

283
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,480
Your father was determined
to expose The Court

284
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,760
and became a risk.

285
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,320
- Simple as that.
- And so you had him killed?

286
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,800
Your own brother?

287
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,240
You wanna shoot me, Jim?

288
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,360
You'd be doing me a favor.
But it won't change anything.

289
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,920
The only thing we can do now
is finish what Peter started

290
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,280
and bring down The Court.

291
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,480
It's what he would have wanted.

292
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,440
What my father would have wanted
is for justice to be done.

293
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,360
And so do I.

294
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,320
Frank Gordon, you're under arrest
for the murder of Peter Gordon.

295
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,480
Turn around.

296
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,240
- Turn around!
- Have you not been listening?

297
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,000
You have the right to remain silent.

298
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,800
Anything you say
can and will be used

299
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,520
- against you in court of law.
- Arrest me and it's over.

300
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,720
- You have the right to an attorney.
- Stopping,

301
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,000
them is the only thing that matters.

302
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,640
My father mattered.

303
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,080
Dock 9C.

304
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,600
It's where the weapon
will be arriving.

305
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,480
It's all I've been able to find out.

306
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,040
I need to speak with The Court.
Try to buy some time.

307
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,120
You need to find out
when the weapon will be arriving,

308
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,680
and you need to do it
without The Court

309
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,160
finding out you're involved.

310
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,320
Otherwise,

311
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
we're both dead.

312
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,680
Make a choice, Jim.

313
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,320
I didn't think you had it in you.

314
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,520
I know.

315
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,040
You never did.

316
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,120
Is that what this is about?

317
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,040
No one gave you a gold star
for thuggery?

318
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,080
If you're gonna kill me,
then get on with it already.

319
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,640
I ain't gonna kill you.

320
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,920
We're gonna auction off
that right to the highest bidder.

321
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,600
We?

322
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,320
That would be my sales force.

323
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,080
- Hey.
- Bless you, buddy.

324
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,760
If he had just listened
to me but no.

325
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,160
Nobody listens to Ivy.

326
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,840
- That's a lot to take in.
- Tell me about it.

327
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,000
A secret organization
that controls all of Gotham?

328
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,200
If that's true, somebody should tell
them they're doing

329
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,560
a pretty terrible job.

330
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,560
He told you all of this at the cabin?

331
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,720
Most of it.

332
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,720
The weapon intended
to destroy the city,

333
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,560
that's a new wrinkle
he threw at me today.

334
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,560
Quite the family reunion
you're having.

335
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,480
I didn't mean to involve you
in all of these.

336
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,000
I just don't know
who to trust anymore.

337
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,200
The way I see it, as hard as it was
to hear what Falcone had to say.

338
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,760
At least, he confirmed
the existence of The Court.

339
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,320
So, I take my uncle at his word?

340
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,680
You work the lead.

341
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,520
Check the docks, but that's just me.
I tend to give apocalyptic warnings

342
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,960
of mass destruction
the benefit of the doubt.

343
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,560
But it wasn't my father
who was killed.

344
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,320
So, if you wanna go after your uncle
for what he did,

345
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,040
I got your back.

346
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,120
He says The Court has destroyed
the city twice before in its history.

347
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,320
- We can't take that chance.
- I'll call Judge Bam Bam.

348
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,600
Get a warrant.
We'll hit the dock and start kicking

349
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,240
- the doors today.
- No. He was very clear.

350
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,160
The Court can't know
I'm looking into this.

351
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,840
G.C.P.D. cannot be involved.

352
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,000
So, who do we know
who can raid the docks,

353
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,920
won't raise questions
and isn't connected to the G.C.P.D.?

354
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,440
No, no, no.

355
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,320
Feels a little light.

356
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,640
And you know...

357
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,760
...mummy's gonna need
a new pair of stilettos.

358
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,520
Capeesh?

359
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,040
Who's next?

360
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,840
Barbara Queen.

361
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,360
Jim?

362
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,440
What an unpleasant surprise.

363
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,880
Let me guess.

364
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,640
Do I hear a favor coming on?

365
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,680
I've been waiting a long time
for you to begin your journey.

366
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,040
The only journey
I'm going to take is back home.

367
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,920
Back to Gotham.

368
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,840
Then we share the same destination.

369
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,960
What are those?

370
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,760
Acupuncture needles?

371
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,080
Of a sort.

372
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,240
Think of them as keys.

373
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,040
A way to open the mind
through that which it locks away

374
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,880
even from itself.

375
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,920
What are the symbols on the ends?

376
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,200
You said you wanted
to return to Gotham.

377
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,440
Here we are.

378
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,360
Come on, Tom! It wasn't that bad.

379
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,080
No? Childish drivel.

380
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,680
I thought the acting was fine.
The music was lovely.

381
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,960
What about you, Bruce?

382
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,560
It's a... sorry, Mum,
I agree with Dad.

383
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,960
It was kind of lame.

384
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,640
"Kind of lame?" There's no such
word as "kind of."

385
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,240
- It was totally lame.
- Yeah.

386
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,920
Dad.

387
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,600
- Mom?
- Give me your money.

388
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,720
How did... how did you do that?

389
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,800
How did you do that?

390
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,880
What was that place?

391
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,200
- A memory.
- No.

392
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,440
No, it was real.

393
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,600
The mind can do far more
than recall memories.

394
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,360
If one knows how,
you can experience them,

395
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,960
relive them as if they were
happening for the first time.

396
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,560
You're saying we were inside my mind?

397
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,920
One is always inside
their own mind.

398
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,160
Pretending we are separate from it,
that is the falsehood.

399
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,080
How could you show me that?

400
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,360
How could you take me back there?

401
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,320
You've never left that alley, Bruce.
Not really.

402
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,120
And for you to be able to accept
what it is I have to teach,

403
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,680
you need to...

404
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,320
rest.

405
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
We'll try again soon.

406
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,680
Torture is fun.

407
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:43,480
However, I need to know
what is coming into Dock 9C.

408
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,640
I told you there is no Dock 9C.

409
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,680
- I can't tell you what I don't...
- What you don't know?

410
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,200
Yes, I've heard that one.

411
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,200
Now, tell me something
I haven't heard.

412
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,680
You don't know
what they're capable of.

413
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,800
Even when Don Falcone
was running things,

414
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,440
he never asked questions
about what came into 9C.

415
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,680
In case you haven't heard,

416
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,160
Don Falcone ain't running things,
baby.

417
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:15,000
Now, what is coming into Dock 9C?

418
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,440
Something already came in last week,
but they picked it up, okay?

419
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,160
The crate is still over there.

420
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,400
I swear, that's all I know. I swear!

421
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,000
So...

422
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,880
You must have a phone number
to alert them when things arrive?

423
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
What do you say
we give them a little call?

424
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,480
Because I would love an introduction.

425
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,600
Get them!

426
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,640
I swear I didn't tell them nothing.

427
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,560
Make sure you get him from all sides.

428
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,440
Potential bidders need to know
that he's alive and well.

429
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,280
Once we get these delivered,
the auction can begin.

430
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,520
Forgot these in the car.

431
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,680
Cannolis from Alberto's, boss.

432
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,480
Thank God. I'm starved.

433
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,000
Alberto's are my favorite.
They always put the cream...

434
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,360
Looks like you've got yourself
into quite the pickle.

435
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,720
You're sitting right next to me.
I think our fates

436
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,400
are somewhat intertwined.

437
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,680
No. I'll be fine.

438
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,760
What? What are you talking about?

439
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,880
Totally fine.

440
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,760
If you have a plan, tell me.

441
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,200
Tell me.

442
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,280
What? You want me to beg?
Is that it?

443
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,120
I want you to be nice to me.

444
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,240
- Nice to you?
- Yes! Is that too much to ask?

445
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,840
No.

446
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,160
No, it's not.

447
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,680
Okay. I'll be nice. I promise.

448
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,080
Now, what is your plan?
Lay it on me.

449
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,280
Watch and learn.

450
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,400
Canolli guy. Hey, quick question?

451
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,760
- Yeah.
- Yeah, with that...

452
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,920
If I had information, like,
really good information

453
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,800
that would get you a ton
more money for Penguin...

454
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,720
Would you let me go?

455
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,800
I don't know. Maybe. What is it?

456
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,080
I can't tell you in front of...

457
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,040
Let me whisper it in your ear.

458
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,840
Do you like my perfume?

459
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,760
You'll do anything I ask?

460
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,320
Super. Kill them all.

461
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,280
- Wait!
- Stop!

462
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,000
- Get his gun.
- Grab the gun!

463
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,760
- And give it to me.
- Give it to him!

464
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,680
- Now, tell him to untie us.
- Untie us!

465
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,800
- You don't have to yell.
- I'm sorry!

466
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,680
I just got so caught up
in the moment.

467
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,360
You know,
I like the idea of an auction, Gabe.

468
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,640
I think I'll auction you
off to myself.

469
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,840
Piece by bloody piece.

470
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,240
Carmine told us Jim came
to him asking questions

471
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,160
about his father's death.

472
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,920
What exactly does he know?

473
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,560
Only what Carmine knew.

474
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,720
That I gave the order
to have Peter killed.

475
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,760
Nothing can lead back to The Court.

476
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:30,000
After all these years, why would
he start looking into this now?

477
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,080
I don't know.

478
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,120
Believe me,
this is the last thing I wanted.

479
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,720
Which is why I'm here.

480
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,040
I know my nephew.

481
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,520
Jim won't stop until
one of us is dead.

482
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,760
Unfortunate.

483
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,280
He would have made a powerful ally
in what lies ahead.

484
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,600
In that case,

485
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,400
you know what you have to do.

486
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,840
James Gordon must be killed.

487
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,440
Barbara called.

488
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
What'd she say?

489
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,480
Apparently, Dock 9C
is being guarded

490
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,040
by a blade-wielding, psychopath
who almost killed them.

491
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,800
Of course, it is, did she find
out if anything's coming in?

492
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,960
That's the thing.

493
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,080
- It already has.
- I thought,

494
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,160
your uncle said the weapon wasn't
in the city yet.

495
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,560
He did. Which means either he's lying
or he didn't know.

496
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,880
Either way,

497
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,560
we have to assume
the Court already has it.

498
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,360
We still don't even know what it is.

499
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,320
We know one thing,
Barbara said the crate that she saw

500
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,840
was stamped with Indian Hill.

501
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,520
So, something from the freak factory
is gonna wipe out the city?

502
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,840
Gordon.

503
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,040
<i>We need to talk.</i>

504
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,200
Did you know the weapon is here?

505
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,800
<i>What? No.</i>

506
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,400
What the hell is going on, Frank?

507
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,840
<i>We're running out of time.
I'm at my house.</i>

508
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,600
<i>Go alone, come quickly.</i>

509
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,360
I trusted you, Gabe.

510
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,400
How did you repay that loyalty?

511
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,840
Betrayal.

512
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,840
Not for nothing.

513
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,640
But I was there after your mother
was killed when no one else was.

514
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,720
And how did you repay me?

515
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,320
By passing me over.

516
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,320
A valid point.

517
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,600
Perhaps we forget
that loyalty must be extended

518
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,080
before it can be returned.

519
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Yeah.

520
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,520
You were loyal to me once, Gabe.
I wonder could you be again?

521
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,840
Yes, boss.

522
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,840
I'd swear an oath on my dead
mother's grave right now.

523
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,920
God rest her soul.

524
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,240
No need for anything so dramatic.

525
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,320
Ivy? Would you mind ensuring

526
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,000
that Gabe's oath of loyalty
is noble and true?

527
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,360
If what is, what now?

528
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,120
Make him smell your perfume.

529
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
Right. Okay.

530
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,720
Raise your right hand.

531
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,400
Do you swear to be loyal and true
to Penguin?

532
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,080
No.

533
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,520
I don't understand. Why not?
Why can't he be loyal?

534
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,400
Go ahead. Answer.

535
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,400
I never was.

536
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,600
I only followed you out of fear.
We all did.

537
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,520
Actually, I can live with that.

538
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,280
Fear and respect. Management 101.

539
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,520
No one ever respected you.

540
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,560
We always saw you
for what you really are.

541
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,120
A tiny freak
who used to hold an umbrella.

542
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,880
Nothing more.

543
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,960
A freak?

544
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,520
A freak?

545
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,200
A freak.

546
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,960
Yes, I'll think I'm freaking, freak!

547
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,840
Thanks for coming.

548
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,880
The weapon The Court is planning
to use on Gotham...

549
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,840
Came from Indian Hill.

550
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,720
Any idea what it might be?

551
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,800
No.

552
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,440
Like I said, I had no idea
that it had already arrived.

553
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,160
It's clear that The Court
no longer trusts me.

554
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,640
Then why call me down here?

555
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,040
I'm supposed to kill you.

556
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,800
Which leaves us where?

557
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,840
That's up to you.

558
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,160
I need someone to replace me
on The Court.

559
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,320
Someone who can find out
what the weapon is

560
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,680
and how to stop it.

561
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,680
Someone I can trust.

562
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,280
You need to join
the Court of Owls, Jim.

563
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,120
It's the only way.

564
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,920
You just said they want me dead.

565
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,840
They still want you on The Court.

566
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,880
They just don't see now
how it's possible.

567
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,960
But I do.

568
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,760
At some point,

569
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,000
a woman named Kathryn
is going to call...

570
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,160
...to ask if you're dead.

571
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,840
And when she does...

572
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,280
I suggest you pick up.

573
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,920
And tell her what?

574
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,200
That you blame me
for your father's death.

575
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,480
I gave the order to have him killed,
and I deserved what I got.

576
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,680
What are you talking about?

577
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,160
You have his strength, Jim.

578
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,200
You can finish what he started.

579
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,320
For both of us.

580
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,440
He would have been so proud of you.

581
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,160
No!

582
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,280
Please.

583
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,080
Please, I'm sorry.
I'll do whatever you want.

584
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,120
Just, please don't make me
go back to her.

585
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,280
Give me your money!

586
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,280
No!

587
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,440
I have so much to teach you, Bruce.

588
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,560
But your pain,

589
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,200
it blocks you from
who I need you to become.

590
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,480
Who Gotham needs you to become.

591
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,560
If one's feelings and emotions
are strong enough,

592
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,080
their consequences can follow you
back into the real world.

593
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,240
I don't know what you want
from me.

594
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,200
Over the centuries,

595
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,320
we've tried to end the cycle
of crime and violence

596
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,440
that plagues Gotham,
only for it to start up again.

597
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,200
And do you know why it does?

598
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,480
People are afraid.

599
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,600
And fear breeds hopelessness.

600
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,360
I'm supposed to believe you care
about the people of Gotham?

601
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,440
I do.

602
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,000
Very much.

603
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,680
Which is where you come in.

604
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,680
Gotham needs something
I believe only you can provide.

605
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,960
What?

606
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,480
A protector, Bruce.

607
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,600
I can't protect Gotham.

608
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,080
Not by myself. No one can.

609
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,520
Perhaps.

610
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,280
But if you were to become a symbol.

611
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,800
A symbol against fear.

612
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,520
Then, Gotham can be reborn.

613
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,760
Okay. I admit it.

614
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,680
I might have lost my temper
there a little bit.

615
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,520
Sorry about that.

616
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,920
It's okay.

617
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,000
I don't know why I let him get to me.

618
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,800
Sticks and stones, right?

619
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,840
Words always hurt me
way more than sticks or stones.

620
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,440
Yeah, me too.

621
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,800
So, does this mean you're giving up
your plans for revenge?

622
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:22,040
I can't take on Nygma and Barbara,
and the rest of them by myself.

623
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,760
Who said anything about taking them
on by yourself?

624
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,080
Selina told me some
pretty crazy stories

625
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,040
about people
she met down in Indian Hill.

626
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,000
You said you wanna
build an army, right?

627
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,560
Well...

628
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,240
What about an army of freaks?

629
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,520
What kind of freaks?

630
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,200
Kathryn, I presume.

631
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,520
<i>Detective Gordon.</i>

632
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,680
<i>I can't say I'm entirely surprised.</i>

633
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,080
I killed my uncle.

634
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,280
I make no apologies for it.

635
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,640
<i>We understand.</i>

636
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,920
Good.

637
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,480
Then maybe it's time we meet.

638
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,600
<i>Agreed.</i>
