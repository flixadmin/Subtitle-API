1
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:11,930
[Godspeed] Infinite Velocity
will soon be mine.

2
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,599
And once my ascension is complete,

3
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:18,770
all will bow before
the might of Godspeed!

4
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:32,784
Gideon, let C.C.P.D.
know I've got Heart.

5
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:34,577
I'm bringing him in now.

6
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:37,080
Guess you couldn't
run away forever, Heart.

7
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:38,998
Argh!

8
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:43,628
[Godspeed] Never anger a god,
little one.

9
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:45,296
[electricity crackling]

10
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:55,932
Whoo! [laughs]

11
00:00:58,685 --> 00:00:59,685
Yo!

12
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:01,230
That was so crash.

13
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:05,024
What the hell was that?
You just phased through a speedster.

14
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:07,127
- Who didn't see me coming.
- Your molecules could've

15
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:09,612
conjoined on a quantum level.
Do you not know what that means?

16
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:12,282
No, I don't,
because I'm a freshman in college

17
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:14,485
and I don't learn quantum physics
till my junior year.

18
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:16,619
- You remember that, right, sis?
- Whatever.

19
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:19,539
Bart! You have to stop
pulling these crazy stunts,

20
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,517
you're still learning how
to control your meta-abilities.

21
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:24,919
My meta-abilities just saved the day.
You saw that.

22
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:27,880
Also, I'm expanding my boundaries.

23
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:31,098
Right? Who knows what else you could do,
if you actually push yourself?

24
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:32,302
Seriously?

25
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:34,137
Did you not just see my lightning lasso?

26
00:01:37,724 --> 00:01:38,933
Okay, that's really bad.

27
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,980
[Gideon] Warning. August Heart,
now located at 5724, Fontana Drive.

28
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:45,565
The Flash Museum.

29
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:53,823
[Godspeed] You're too late.

30
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,075
Now the future belongs to Godspeed.

31
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,721
- If he gets away...
- We'll never find him, but...

32
00:01:58,745 --> 00:02:00,705
- Mom and Dad'll kill us so...
- Screw it.

33
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:24,020
[Nora] Wait, the guy
we chased through time,

34
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:26,898
August Heart, has no speed
and no memory now?

35
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:29,567
And he has dozens of clones
all fighting each other?

36
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:30,777
Maybe even more now.

37
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,029
Hey, that was an amazing story
by the way.

38
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:34,673
The whole phasing through
the baddies like that.

39
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:35,657
Dude, that phasing...

40
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:36,842
Bro, I've been working
on that move for...

41
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:38,201
So epic!

42
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:40,745
- Thanks, bruh.
- Also, I'm Chester P. Runk.

43
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,581
Team Tech Guru
and it is an absolute pleasure

44
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:46,584
to meet the kinder of Flash and Iris.

45
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:48,836
Chester, we've already met.

46
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,548
You improved my gauntlet's
efficiency by, like, 2,000%.

47
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:54,816
You're also the smartest person we know.

48
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,845
- I am?
- Yeah, my God, absolutely.

49
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,639
Dude, you helped me
with my differentials

50
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:02,266
of mathematics homework all the time.

51
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,019
All the time. Don't forget that.

52
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,130
- Grammie Cecile!
- Grammie Cecile!

53
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:09,899
- Hi!
- [laughs] Hi!

54
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,693
Oh, my God.

55
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:14,070
I feel so much love from you two.

56
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:16,781
I can't wait to get to know you both.

57
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,533
- Oh, hey, Caitlin.
- What up, Cait?

58
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:20,159
Hi.

59
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:22,453
- It happened again?
- Yeah.

60
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:26,541
- Just wish Iris was here to meet them.
- Dad.

61
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,376
Mom's going to be fine,
it's okay.

62
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,168
Yeah.

63
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:33,381
Well, with Nora and Bart here,

64
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:35,384
at least we've got the extra muscle
that we need.

65
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:38,219
Uh-uh. West-Allen family
rule number one,

66
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:41,264
protect the timeline
at any and all cost.

67
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:42,557
We can't stay.

68
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:45,560
Actually...

69
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:47,811
you can.

70
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,022
- Really?
- What?

71
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:52,543
Look, the Godspeeds are recharging
themselves in the Speed Force,

72
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:55,820
so as long as that's the case,
there's no way back.

73
00:03:56,154 --> 00:03:57,155
So...

74
00:03:58,448 --> 00:04:00,241
maybe you are safer here with us.

75
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:01,617
- Oh.
- [Bart and Nora chuckle]

76
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:02,910
And, I don't know,

77
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:04,263
maybe you're the advantage we needed

78
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:06,080
to finally end this war,
once and for all.

79
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:08,249
Cecile's helping me with the MAD 2.0

80
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:09,932
so we can unlock
August Heart's memories.

81
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,335
But no luck yet.

82
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,254
- Okay, Barry, uh...
- [Barry] Yeah?

83
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:14,922
I think I got something.

84
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,551
Okay, so I was going through
my pop's old schematics

85
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,720
and I found this.

86
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,992
It reconverts the atomic mass
of nutrinovoltaic energy cells.

87
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:26,726
Pops called it
a solar encryption engine.

88
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:28,644
Cool. What does it do?

89
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:31,939
It neutralizes artificially-created
kinetic energy sources.

90
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:33,524
Like Godspeed's artificial speed.

91
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:35,818
[sing-song] And I already
built the prototype.

92
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:39,030
I just need to charge the battery
with an electromagnetic source.

93
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,073
Hey, have you seen Allegra lately?

94
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:43,910
Uh, no, not since yesterday
when she said goodbye to Esperanza.

95
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:45,912
Hmm. I'll find her.

96
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:50,541
With any luck, the S.E.E...
Mmm... S.E.E., get it?

97
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,044
Will be fully charged and functional
within an hour.

98
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,212
All right.

99
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:57,799
Dad, with this we can stop
Heart and his clones in his tracks.

100
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,134
We can win this war.

101
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:02,886
[sighs]

102
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,525
[Bart belches]

103
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:17,276
[both chuckle]

104
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,111
It's okay, Dad, we don't bite.

105
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:23,282
Mmm-hmm. Okay. Yo.

106
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,327
Check this out. [sniffles]

107
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,037
- I got one more.
- [Nora] No.

108
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,747
[inhales]

109
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,252
[belches]

110
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:36,629
- Oh! Gross.
- [Bart] Whoo!

111
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,632
Nora, you can just ignore the family
rules for a minute and rewind that?

112
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,884
Oh, sure. How would I do that?

113
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:45,847
Wait.

114
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,099
Is this about the other Nora?

115
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,186
You know about her?

116
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:54,564
- Totally, I mean...
- Yeah.

117
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:58,901
You and Mom told us a ton of stories
about her and I'm so glad that you did.

118
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:02,363
I feel like part of her
is still alive in me.

119
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:04,907
[alarm beeping]

120
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:08,286
[Caitlin] <i>Barry, we've got more Godspeed
clones southwest of City Hall.</i>

121
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:09,620
Okay.

122
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:10,913
Time to go to work.

123
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:12,497
Let's go.

124
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,377
[hesitates] "Let's go"?
You mean all three of us? Go?

125
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:18,963
Yeah, you ready?

126
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:21,090
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

127
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,173
[Barry] All right.

128
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:41,819
Okay, secure the area.

129
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:43,905
Make sure there are no civilians
in harm's way.

130
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,072
What about them?

131
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:47,241
Let 'em kill each other,
then clean up the mess.

132
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,625
- Dad...
- Okay, split up and keep moving.

133
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,228
We'll run out the clock until
they have to go back and recharge.

134
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,383
None of the Godspeeds are behind me.

135
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,827
- Nora, how many are following you?
- [XS] <i>None here either.</i>

136
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:08,971
<i>- Where the heck are they?</i>
- [Impulse] <i>Found them!</i>

137
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,184
[Godspeed clones] Kill the Adversary.
Strike him down.

138
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:15,311
Kill the Adversary.

139
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:18,456
Circle back. We'll fight them together.

140
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,399
No. I'm gonna lead them away
from the city.

141
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:21,901
No, you're not. Now listen to me...

142
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:30,867
[grunts]

143
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:43,714
You all right?

144
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:47,217
Uh...

145
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:48,719
Yeah.

146
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:52,723
Yeah. [chuckles] I mean, yeah.

147
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:54,701
They couldn't keep up
with the fleet-footed wonder.

148
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,352
They went to recharge, you idiot.

149
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,555
What's your problem?
You were supposed to circle back.

150
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,315
Bart, why did they all follow you
and not us?

151
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,072
What are you not telling me?

152
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,084
All right, which one of you
is going to tell me what's going on?

153
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,796
All those clones
just tried to kill you, Bart.

154
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,881
They were calling you "The Adversary."

155
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:27,717
Why? What's going on?

156
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,677
Dad, we can't talk about this.

157
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,514
Look, right now, I don't care about
what kind of rules I have in the future.

158
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,076
I want to know why every Godspeed
out there just tried to kill Bart.

159
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,685
Because he's my Thawne.

160
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:43,941
Dad, Godspeed is my archnemesis.

161
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,944
Okay? He's my one
Big Bad to Rule Them All.

162
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:48,279
Just like you and Thawne.

163
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:51,032
[sighs]

164
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:53,576
Bart.

165
00:08:54,035 --> 00:08:56,537
Thawne devoted his entire life
to destroying mine.

166
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,165
He murdered your grandma.

167
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,393
You can't just throw his name around
without knowing what it means.

168
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,878
- I know what it means!
- [Nora] Bart, it's okay.

169
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,256
Why don't we all just
try and take a breath?

170
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:16,557
Maybe we should go train?

171
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,160
If we want to take on those
clones again,

172
00:09:18,184 --> 00:09:19,977
we gotta work on our Fathwoom Boom.

173
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,484
Fine.

174
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:34,408
We'll be in the Speed Lab
if you need us.

175
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:51,509
Oh, thank the universe.
I've been looking for you everywhere.

176
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:54,029
Look, you are not gonna believe
what went down while you were gone.

177
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:58,849
Barry and Iris' kids showed up.
From the freakin' future.

178
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:02,353
Now, it's like we've got
two Marty McFly's.

179
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:06,357
- You okay?
- Yup.

180
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,567
Need something?

181
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:11,654
Well, the Godspeeds left
to go recharge again.

182
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:16,408
But the intervals between their attacks
are getting shorter and shorter.

183
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:20,287
So I need this ready
for when they come back.

184
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,081
Ta-da!

185
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,043
It's my pop's solar encryption engine.

186
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:29,922
I mean, I still gotta do
a few final tweaks,

187
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,633
but I also need a way
to charge the battery.

188
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:36,554
So you came to the human charger,
got it.

189
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,556
Fine, let's go.

190
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,974
You forgot your java.

191
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:42,268
- It's fine.
- Yeah, but you can just take it to-go

192
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:43,951
and hit it with a microwave blast later.

193
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:47,148
I already nuked it, Chester.
I just don't want it anymore.

194
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:48,691
Now, can we get this over with?

195
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:56,949
Nuked it, huh.

196
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,461
[Kramer] That's when the suspect
confessed to the bombing in Polokistan.

197
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,168
Did Creyke say anything else?

198
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,463
'Cause Kristen Kramer
died in that explosion.

199
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:13,799
And that means you're dead.

200
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:17,887
No. That was everything.

201
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,598
[FBI officer] Great.
That should be it on our end.

202
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,933
- The car you asked for is out front.
- Great. Thanks.

203
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:30,316
I'm having a hard time
trying to reach anybody in Central City.

204
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,079
It's like the whole town
lost cell service.

205
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:33,485
You tried C.C.P.D.?

206
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:34,612
Multiple times, no answer.

207
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,739
And I need to get
in contact with Cecile.

208
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:40,367
Hey, anything else
you wanna say to the Feds?

209
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,204
I've said all I needed to say.

210
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:44,288
Let's get moving.

211
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:52,379
[Gideon] Bhikkhuni Amala confirms
Wally West is in deep meditation,

212
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:54,632
handling unrest on the psychic plane.

213
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,760
Which means we're out of speedsters
to call.

214
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:01,597
Iris?

215
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,516
- Hey.
- Hi.

216
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:09,104
How are you here?
How is this possible?

217
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,108
Deon was able to stabilize me enough
to come back

218
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,691
until he can find a permanent cure.

219
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,318
[sighs with relief] Thank God.

220
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:16,737
I've missed you so much.

221
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,531
It's been impossible
without you here with me.

222
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:20,950
I'm here now.

223
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:22,618
And I'm gonna be fine.

224
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:26,455
With everything that's happened,
the war,

225
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:29,458
you needing to heal
in the Still Force...

226
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,377
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

227
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,254
Now that you're back, it's perfect.

228
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,107
Feels like you wanted to
tell me something.

229
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,132
It can wait.

230
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:38,550
Iris, uh...

231
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,386
So much has happened.

232
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:42,554
Um, you're not gonna
believe this, but...

233
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:44,139
Our son and daughter are here.

234
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:48,310
- How did you...
- I was watching from the Still Force.

235
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:51,105
Deon let me see everything
that happened.

236
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,189
And...

237
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:56,235
Yeah, they are amazing.
I mean, Nora, she's all grown up

238
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:59,238
and Bart, he's already a young man.

239
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,864
It's incredible.

240
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:04,076
- You were with me the whole time.
- Yeah.

241
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,248
So, you know who Godspeed is to Bart

242
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,874
and how much danger he's in?

243
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,753
Bart knows what Thawne's done to me,

244
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:17,464
the pain that he's caused,
so if Godspeed is Bart's Thawne...

245
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:19,925
Then what did he do to Bart?

246
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,886
Iris, those Godspeeds quit fighting
each other to go after him.

247
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,472
I don't think they're gonna stop
until they've killed our son.

248
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,893
Then we can't let him go out there
until the war's over.

249
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:39,069
Barry's never gonna believe this.

250
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:41,113
I can barely believe it either.

251
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:43,572
In the last 40 days,

252
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:46,994
Speed Force saturation in your body
has gone from zero to a hundred, Jay.

253
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:52,124
You know, a year ago
I thought I'd never run again,

254
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,335
but then I hit the jackpot.

255
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:55,586
And just in time, too.

256
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,630
Because an army of evil speedsters
is attacking Central City?

257
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:03,302
Joan, I know I'm rusty,

258
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,972
but Barry needs all the help he can get.

259
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:12,102
Fine, but I've got a patient
going into surgery at the clinic.

260
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,230
So, when you're out there,
please remember...

261
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,024
Be careful?

262
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:18,942
Watch your head.

263
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:22,363
Doctor's orders.

264
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,706
All right, old man,

265
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,001
time to get in on the action.

266
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,387
[groans]

267
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,766
[whooshing]

268
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:59,108
What the hell do you want?

269
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,151
[Godspeed clone] You, Jay Garrick.

270
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,322
We want you.

271
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:12,454
[zapping]

272
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,500
What gives, Bart?

273
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:19,169
You can throw stars with your lightning,

274
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:21,333
but you can't catch a ball of it
in under 20 seconds?

275
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,507
Nora... [panting]

276
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,883
it's a lot harder than it looks.

277
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:27,386
Well, maybe you should stop
focusing on being a badass

278
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,179
parkouring off every wall you see.

279
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,890
So, you agree? I do look badass.

280
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,098
- Ugh.
- That's it.

281
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,740
That's all that I've ever
wanted from you.

282
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,175
You don't understand.
I can do all the stuff. Not like...

283
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,857
Mom! Hi! [laughing]

284
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,779
I told you she'd be okay.

285
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:48,115
I'm just glad our family's
finally together.

286
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,451
I am so happy to see you guys.

287
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:51,970
I'm so sorry I couldn't get here sooner.

288
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,162
Oh, it's all good, seriously.

289
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:55,085
Deon already told us
about what happens when...

290
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,417
Never mind. Uh, what's up?

291
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,422
- We need to talk to you.
- Oh, can it wait?

292
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,967
We're working on a new move that
we're actually gonna use on Godspeed.

293
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,778
I think you're gonna like it a lot,
it's kinda of old school...

294
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,971
Bart, you won't be going into the field.

295
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:13,599
[Iris West] Yeah, Bart.

296
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:17,728
Your dad told me everything
and I saw the rest in the Still Force.

297
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:21,023
Look, it was one thing
when Godspeed was just some meta

298
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:22,750
that you two were fighting
in the future but...

299
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,026
He's your Thawne.

300
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:25,819
Which means it's personal.

301
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,112
Yeah, I mean...

302
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:32,075
Okay, Dad, I'm sorry for how
I reacted earlier,

303
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:35,496
but you don't know me

304
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:37,164
like that yet.

305
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:40,667
I can keep my cool, I promise, I can.
Tell them. I can keep my cool, right?

306
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,172
But... you can't.

307
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,012
Bart...

308
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,518
Dad...

309
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:02,856
I know Bart can be a bonehead,
but he's right.

310
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,234
You've only known him for a few hours.

311
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,361
I've known him for 19 years.

312
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:09,821
I got this. Trust me.

313
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,285
[sighs]

314
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,330
They are so incredible.

315
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:21,166
- We make great people.
- Yeah, we do.

316
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,015
Thought I'd find you moping in here.

317
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,978
- You always come here when you're angry.
- How could you turn on me like that?

318
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:43,551
You're supposed to have my back.

319
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:45,732
I still do.

320
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:48,402
Look, I get why you're angry.

321
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:51,238
After what Godspeed took from you,
from us.

322
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:52,531
Godspeed didn't...

323
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:56,034
Nora, Godspeed didn't take Uncle Jay.

324
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:00,622
He killed him.

325
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,460
[voice falters] He killed Uncle Jay.

326
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:09,381
Right in front of me.

327
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:19,808
Yeah, sure, Dad and Uncle Wally
taught me how to run

328
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,394
and how to meditate,
and all that's great.

329
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,231
Uncle Jay understood me.

330
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:31,612
He was the first person that saw
my impulsiveness as a strength

331
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:34,448
and not as a weakness.
He would literally tell me,

332
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:37,909
he'd say, "Bart,
sometimes you have to take a risk.

333
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,872
Sometimes you have to go with your gut.

334
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:47,628
It is impulsive, maybe,
but sometimes it's right."

335
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:54,051
He got me.

336
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:58,597
And now he's gone.

337
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,226
I know.

338
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:08,815
But you still got me and Mom and Dad.

339
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:12,027
How can... Can't we just tell them

340
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,154
what Godspeed did?

341
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:16,531
I feel like if Dad knew,
he would understand

342
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:18,533
why it has to be me who takes him down.

343
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:21,662
Because if we did that, we would be
breaking the most important rule.

344
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:23,372
I know, I know, I know.

345
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:29,086
Bart, Uncle Jay did say that stuff,
about taking risks.

346
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,381
But if he were here now
seeing what we were up against,

347
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,174
what do you think he would want to do?

348
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:42,265
[sighs] He'd tell me, "Sometimes
you have to take your hat off."

349
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:59,491
See? I'm always right.

350
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:02,619
Someti... You are sometimes right.

351
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:07,916
Look, I will take Godspeed down
for the both of us.

352
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:09,835
I promise.

353
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:13,797
But you just gotta stay here, okay?

354
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:25,225
[sighs]

355
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:28,871
[Caitlin] Since the MAD 2.0
isn't working,

356
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,480
we need to try another tactic.

357
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,654
Does this remind you of anything?

358
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,157
This seems so familiar.

359
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:47,164
[grunts]

360
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:51,792
Are you all right?

361
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,506
Ever since I lost my memories,

362
00:20:57,048 --> 00:21:00,844
I've been trying to understand who I am,
how I ended up like this.

363
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,847
Figured I must have had a breakdown.

364
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:07,184
Maybe somewhere there's a wife and kids

365
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,192
wondering what the hell happened
to their dad.

366
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,021
I don't know.

367
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,861
Am I ever gonna know who I am?

368
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:28,204
[sighs in frustration]

369
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,040
Come on. What's wrong with me?

370
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,252
So, I finally finished the last tweak
to the S.E.E.

371
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,798
Now, all that's left to do
is to finish charging the solar panel.

372
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:39,674
And... mwah! <i>Voilà.</i>

373
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:43,887
Oh, man, my pops would be so jazzed

374
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,014
to know that
this baby's maiden voyage'll be

375
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:49,726
take down psycho-speedsters. [exhales]

376
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,062
- You're almost done, right?
- How should I know?

377
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:58,235
Battery's not even 10% charged yet.

378
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:00,445
With your output capacity,

379
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:03,114
it should be almost 89% charged by now.

380
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:06,992
Allegra...

381
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:09,287
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

382
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,183
Are you sure?
'Cause like you've been acting...

383
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:13,375
Chester, I'm fine.

384
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,210
[alarm beeping]

385
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,046
More clones just showed up.
Is your father's device ready?

386
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,632
Chester's gadget, yes.
But the battery needs recharging.

387
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,385
It needs kinetic energy
to power it, right?

388
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:24,654
- Yeah.
- Could it be any source?

389
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:26,930
- Theoretically, yeah, but...
- All right. Stand back.

390
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,770
Hot damn! Yeah, it's ready now.

391
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:35,438
I need you two on comms with Iris.

392
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:37,857
Wait, Iris is back?

393
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:39,442
You heard him. Let's go.

394
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,037
- I'm in position.
- Nora, are you ready?

395
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,501
[XS] <i>On my way with the guests of honor.</i>

396
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:01,839
Now!

397
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,100
Holy shrap! It worked.

398
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:13,685
[both laughing]

399
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,939
[Chester] Uh, guys,
sensors are picking up

400
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:19,943
a massive increase
in the clones' kinetic energy.

401
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:21,568
They're recharging.

402
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,235
[grunts]

403
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,820
[grunts]

404
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:27,489
Nora.

405
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:35,582
[grunting]

406
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:51,598
[panting]

407
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:58,146
Nora? Nora?

408
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:05,236
Flash, we gotta go.

409
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:18,742
[Barry] You sure you're okay?

410
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,294
Dad, Mom, I'm fine. I swear.

411
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:25,006
So how did the Godspeeds
recover so fast?

412
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,384
Let alone recharge themselves?

413
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,053
It's like they got stronger
all of a sudden.

414
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,380
[Chester] I think I know how.

415
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:35,016
Okay, so the S.E.E. battery
needed 700 nanometers

416
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,143
of microwave energy to power the device.

417
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:40,897
But the battery wasn't charged
by Allegra. It was charged with...

418
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:41,981
My lightning.

419
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:45,777
Which is equivalent to five billion
nanometers of energy.

420
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,363
So Barry's lightning
supercharged the S.E.E.?

421
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:49,966
Yeah, when the Godspeeds were blasted,

422
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,450
they got a super dose
of his Speed Force Energy, too.

423
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:56,663
Barry, I'm so sorry.
Look, I should have seen this coming.

424
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:59,958
No, you did everything right.
This is not your fault.

425
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:03,670
Okay, so, how long
until the next batch shows up?

426
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:05,338
Forty-five minutes, tops.

427
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:09,151
I'll see if I can get my pop's device
working again before then.

428
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:10,844
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

429
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:16,423
[sighs] What are you thinking?

430
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:19,644
Even if we get the S.E.E. working,
we're still outnumbered.

431
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:22,731
We need reinforcements.

432
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:24,691
Hell to the yeah, you do.

433
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:28,862
How long were you listening?

434
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,323
Not long. Not long. I mean,
just long enough to hear

435
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:34,534
that Dad finally realized
that he should tag me in.

436
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,954
- He meant me, dumbass.
- No, I didn't.

437
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:40,040
Wait. What?

438
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:44,544
Nora, we almost died out there.
I couldn't protect you.

439
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,063
I'm not putting you
in that position again.

440
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:47,547
Yeah, but we didn't die.

441
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:50,258
And I can help.
Mom, a little backup here, please?

442
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:53,011
Nora, this war is unpredictable,
and it's getting more dangerous.

443
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:55,805
What do you think
Bart and I deal with every day in 2049?

444
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:58,617
Yeah, I mean, come on, we're heroes.
Danger's kind of part of the job...

445
00:25:58,641 --> 00:25:59,641
Not this time.

446
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,312
You don't just get to decide that.

447
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:04,105
I'm about to turn 30...

448
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:07,317
in four years.

449
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:11,321
The point is, unlike Bart,
I'm the real adult.

450
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:12,530
Yeah, we're your parents,

451
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:14,508
and we're saying right now
you're still not going out there.

452
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:17,577
- You can't stop me from fighting.
- Me neither. Mom?

453
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:20,037
Your father is right.

454
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,833
You can't just send us back to 2049,
that's not an option.

455
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:27,170
And we're not gonna
go watch TV at Grandpa Joe's.

456
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,893
We could always lock you in
a pipeline cell until this is all over.

457
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:31,883
- You wouldn't.
- [snickers]

458
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:33,885
We will if we have to.

459
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:43,853
[both sigh]

460
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:55,489
[knocking]

461
00:26:57,784 --> 00:26:58,910
So, uh...

462
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:00,912
battery's not the problem.

463
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:04,749
I checked the spectrum readings and...

464
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,669
You're not emitting microwaves.

465
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:10,380
You've been blasting ultraviolet light.

466
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:12,757
Like your cousin.

467
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:16,636
As far as I know,

468
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:22,225
you only hit that range
from channeling negative emotions.

469
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:23,393
Like anger

470
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:25,477
or pain.

471
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,774
Allegra, what's going on?

472
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:31,860
Nothing.

473
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:36,364
Before you said you nuked your coffee...

474
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,449
it was ice cold.

475
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:43,204
Then you called me Chester.
You never call me Chester.

476
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:49,669
Did you get in a fight with Esperanza?

477
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,964
'Cause you can always patch that up.

478
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:54,841
Not this time.

479
00:27:58,219 --> 00:27:59,262
Because she's dead.

480
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:05,268
Allegra, I'm so sorry.

481
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:08,062
It's not your fault.

482
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:09,981
It's mine.

483
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:15,236
Esperanza was my family,
and I should've been there for her.

484
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:19,866
Just like I should be able
to charge this stupid thing,

485
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:20,949
but I can't.

486
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:25,121
And now more people are gonna
get hurt and it's all my fault.

487
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:26,705
It's not...

488
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:28,708
your fault.

489
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:41,471
This whole parenting thing
is different this time around.

490
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:42,888
Yeah, I know.

491
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:48,603
I always knew our kids
would have a hard life being speedsters.

492
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:53,982
[sighs] But I never thought they'd have
to deal with a Thawne of their own.

493
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:58,279
It's like there's a curse on our family.

494
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:03,201
Tragedy follows us everywhere.

495
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:06,204
Maybe that's our real legacy.

496
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:09,457
You don't believe that.

497
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:14,212
This all started
the night Thawne killed my mom.

498
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:18,258
And I might not know where he is now,
but our fight still isn't over.

499
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:23,388
In the other timeline, Nora's Godspeed
killed her best friend, Lia.

500
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:27,016
And now I think this Godspeed
killed someone Bart loved.

501
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:32,689
History is repeating itself.

502
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:46,703
Iris, if we beat the Godspeed clones
here in 2021...

503
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:50,159
the real August Heart
will never get his powers back.

504
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:53,918
Which means that
when Nora and Bart go back to 2049,

505
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:55,962
there won't be a Godspeed there
to endanger them.

506
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:58,256
We have to break the chain.

507
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:04,386
We will.

508
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:06,431
[alarm blaring]

509
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:10,658
Hey, the Rebel Godspeeds managed to hack

510
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:13,271
S.T.A.R.'s communication systems
and send a transmission.

511
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:14,855
What does it say?

512
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:20,611
[Godspeed clone] <i>Flash,
turn over The Adversary now.</i>

513
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:24,282
<i>Or else the one he loves will die.</i>

514
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:27,744
<i>Jay Garrick.</i>

515
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:40,214
What did Joan say?

516
00:30:40,298 --> 00:30:43,051
It's true. Jay got his speed back
when the Speed Force was reborn.

517
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:44,833
And then those clones took him.

518
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:46,971
They're gonna kill Jay.

519
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:49,616
- I won't let them.
- Bart, we've got this under control.

520
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,641
No, you don't.

521
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:52,494
Okay, we're working on a plan.
Just give us some time.

522
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,395
We don't have time, Dad!

523
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:55,772
Uh...

524
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:59,108
Guys, I'm triangulating the Godspeed's
comm signals now.

525
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,504
It came from Zauriel Cathedral
on Morrison Ave.

526
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:03,688
Well, that's where I'm going.

527
00:31:03,738 --> 00:31:04,739
Bart, wait.

528
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:08,910
Dad, they knew how Bart would react
if they took Uncle Jay.

529
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:11,096
He knows he's running into a trap,
but he doesn't care.

530
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,664
You have to stop him.
You have to save him!

531
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,376
We have to save him.

532
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:31,808
Jay.

533
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:40,566
I won't let it happen again.

534
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:47,657
[breathing heavily]

535

[Godspeed clone] Your inability
to suppress your rash nature

536
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:55,206
shall be your undoing.

537
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:01,628
[Impulse screaming]

538
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:11,472
[continues screaming]

539
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:31,325
You want more speed? Come take mine.

540
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:33,744
- Nora, what are you doing?
- Buying you some time.

541
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:35,079
Save Bart.

542
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:41,210
[Godspeed clone]
His primal impulses killed him.

543
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:44,547
And now he's killed you, too.

544
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:13,618
[The Flash] Bart. Bart!

545
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:17,121
Can you hear me?

546
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:18,915
Bart!

547
00:33:19,874 --> 00:33:21,751
They're right behind me. Bart!

548
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:27,897
- Let's get him outta here.
- [Jay] Yeah.

549
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:30,301
Okay, that way.

550
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:32,511
All right. Put him down.

551
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:47,109
I say we give 'em heck, Flash.

552
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:48,193
On my mark.

553
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:58,746
I leave Central City for two seconds...

554
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:07,282
That won't hold them much longer.

555
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:10,132
Dad, Bart won't wake up.

556
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:35,283
I should've stopped him from going.

557
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:38,035
- Nora, this isn't your fault.
- Yes, it is.

558
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:41,289
I'm his older sister.
I'm supposed to keep him safe.

559
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:44,041
This is what Godspeed always does.

560
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,338
He always goes
after the people we love the most.

561
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:55,636
How's he doing?

562
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,263
He's still unresponsive.

563
00:34:57,722 --> 00:34:59,515
Bart's in some sort of
deep comatose state.

564
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:03,978
The Godspeeds were feeding off me
when Bart turned up.

565
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:05,941
And by the time they turned
their sights on him,

566
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:07,356
I had nothing left in the tank.

567
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,760
How did you know how to stop them?

568
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:14,030
Actually, it was my son's idea.

569
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:21,162
[Impulse whooping]

570
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:24,332
I guess sometimes
it pays to be impulsive.

571
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,043
Can't argue with that.

572
00:35:27,418 --> 00:35:29,021
Why hasn't Bart's speed
healing kicked in?

573
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:32,173
It has, but his Speed Force saturation
is so depleted

574
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:35,468
that whatever speed he has left
is being used to keep him alive.

575
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:37,887
I'll keep monitoring him,

576
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,389
but unfortunately
all we can do now is wait.

577
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:50,608
I don't know. Maybe if I would have
gotten there faster, Bart would be okay.

578
00:35:50,691 --> 00:35:52,151
No, you saved our butts.

579
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:53,443
She's right.

580
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:55,237
It's good to see you, man.

581
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,531
It's good to see you.

582
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:02,036
Digg filled me in, I figured
you could use a helping hand.

583
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:04,371
Jay Garrick. [chuckles]

584
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:07,291
- Look at you getting your speed back.
- Hey.

585
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:10,586
- And good timing, too.
- I'll say.

586
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,506
Listen, guys... this war isn't over.

587
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:17,843
Now there could be dozens
or hundreds of those things on the way.

588
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:19,637
I'll keep working on the S.E.E.

589
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:25,226
Hey, how about we use those gauntlets
to fire another entropy trap?

590
00:36:25,393 --> 00:36:27,311
Uh, synthetic entropy trap.

591
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:29,730
Unlike Time Trapper, mine are temporary.

592
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:31,774
And the stronger these clones get...

593
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:33,877
the faster they're gonna
break out of them.

594
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:36,901
So we don't have a way to depower them,
we don't have a way to capture them.

595
00:36:37,071 --> 00:36:39,448
- What do we have?
- We have August Heart.

596
00:36:40,658 --> 00:36:43,953
And we know he went to The Flash Museum
in 2049. We just don't know why.

597
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,515
But it must have something
to do with why

598
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:48,416
this war got started in the first place.

599
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,837
Which means Heart has the answer
locked inside his mind.

600
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:55,423
I need to unlock it.

601
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:59,468
What about the neural hyper collider?

602
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,347
We used it to project my consciousness
into the future.

603
00:37:03,431 --> 00:37:06,434
So maybe it could project
your consciousness into Heart's mind.

604
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:09,687
So, you wanna go inside
the mind of a psychopath?

605
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,147
It's the only option we have left.

606
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:15,192
If I readjust the tachyon booster
with a neuro-fiber housing...

607
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:16,610
I think it could work, kid.

Can you guys take care of things
in the field while I'm in there?

609
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:24,285
Of course. Central City's my hometown,
I'm not losing her that easy.

610
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:26,954
Me too.

[Joe] So... are we gonna talk about it?

614
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,300
Talk about what?

615
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:44,305
- That Creyke said that he saw you die.
- Just drop it, West.

616
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:50,060
I spent years letting Adam haunt me
for the pain that he caused.

617
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:51,604
The lives he took.

618
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:57,985

get back to doing my job.

As soon as I flip the collider,
your synaptic pathways will open.

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,076
And then Ms. Horton
will guide your consciousness into his.

Don't worry. I'm gonna be right here
with you the whole time.

seems harmless.

00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:01,423
But the real August Heart
is locked away inside of his mind.

631
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:04,969
- From what we know...
- He's a monster.

632
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:08,347
Be careful.

633
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:12,309
[Chester] The collider is primed.

634
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,770
Ms. Horton?

635
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:16,813
[clears throat]

636
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:18,606
I'm ready.

637
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:30,785
Yeah.

638
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:37,334
August...

639
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,611
If you're not comfortable with this,
you don't have to do it.

640
00:39:43,674 --> 00:39:44,675
It's okay.

641
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:48,178
I need to know who I am.

642
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,557
Even if it's someone I despise.

643
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:55,060
Yeah.

644
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,231
Okay.

645
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:04,028
[electricity crackling]

646
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:11,452
Barry's synapses are ready
for transference.

647
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:20,044
Barry, follow my voice.

648
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:35,476
[Heart] <i>Flash.</i>

649
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:54,119
[The Flash] I've been here before.

650
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:57,998
[Heart] <i>No, you have not.</i>

651
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:01,543
<i>This is my mind.</i>

652
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:04,004
<i>My place.</i>

653
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:07,091
<i>My future sanctum.</i>

654
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:11,177
Heart?

655
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:15,766
Congratulations. You finally found me.

656
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:17,642
Well done.

657
00:41:19,228 --> 00:41:20,312
You knew I was coming.

658
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:24,525
Actually, I expected you a lot sooner.

659
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:28,696
But, hey, we can't all be overachievers.

660
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,574
You must have so many questions.

661
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:35,327
Good thing I have all the answers.

662
00:41:37,413 --> 00:41:40,874
[distorted voice]
This is gonna be so much fun.
