1
00:00:00,524 --> 00:00:04,735
So much torque,
the chassis twisted coming off the line.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,777
Barely kept her on the track.

3
00:00:08,531 --> 00:00:11,448
-So, what's your best time?
-I've never driven her.

4
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:12,612
Why not?

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,326
It scares the shit out of me.

6
00:00:19,748 --> 00:00:20,993
That's my dad.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,205
He was coming up
in the pro stock-car circuit.

8
00:00:25,628 --> 00:00:27,336
Last race of the season.

9
00:00:28,464 --> 00:00:32,674
A guy named Kenny Linder
came up from inside, in the final turn.

10
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:37,008
He clipped his bumper
and put him into the wall at 120.

11
00:00:40,182 --> 00:00:42,553
I watched my dad burn to death.

12
00:00:45,102 --> 00:00:47,178
I remembered hearing him scream.

13
00:00:50,357 --> 00:00:54,899
But the people that were there
said he had died before the tanks blew.

14
00:01:01,282 --> 00:01:03,654
They said it was me who was screaming.

15
00:01:07,204 --> 00:01:09,611
I saw Linder about a week later.

16
00:01:10,999 --> 00:01:14,414
I had a wrench, and I hit him.

17
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:19,460
And I didn't intend to keep hitting him,
but when I finished, I couldn't lift my arm.

18
00:01:24,843 --> 00:01:27,132
He's a janitor at a high school.

19
00:01:28,263 --> 00:01:30,800
He has to take the bus to work every day.

20
00:01:32,016 --> 00:01:34,720
And they banned me
from the tracks for life.

21
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:42,847
I live my life a quarter-mile at a time.

22
00:01:44,693 --> 00:01:47,480
Nothing else matters.
Not the mortgage, not the store...

23
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,061
...not my team and all their bullshit.

24
00:01:51,782 --> 00:01:54,154
For those 10 seconds or less...

25
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,320
...I'm free.

26
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,053
So, how is it, anyways,
that the gang came to be?

27
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,421
-What?
-The gang.

28
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:24,923
The gang?
No, they don't call themselves a gang.

29
00:02:25,018 --> 00:02:27,343
-What do they call themselves?
-They're a team.

30
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:31,434
-They call themselves a team.
-All right. How did the team come to be?

31
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:34,187
Well, that's a whole lot of history.

32
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,310
-I've got time.
-Okay. Vince grew up with my brother.

33
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,400
Actually, he didn't ever actually grow up,
as you can tell.

34
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:45,484
But they were friends as kids.

35
00:02:45,702 --> 00:02:48,275
And Letty, she just lived down the street.

36
00:02:48,454 --> 00:02:51,703
Always into cars, though.
Ever since she was, like, 10 years old.

37
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,372
So, naturally, you know,
my brother always had her attention.

38
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:59,708
-And then she turned 16--
-And then she had Dom's attention.

39
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:02,922
Yeah. It's funny how that works, isn't it?

40
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:04,920
Yeah.

41
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,711
How does Jesse fit into the whole thing?

42
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:15,805
Jesse. Well, Jesse and Leon just sort of
showed up one night and never, ever left.

43
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:19,929
It's just the way my brother is, you know.
Dom's like....

44
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:23,438
He's like gravity.

45
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:26,773
Everything just gets pulled to him.

46
00:03:28,403 --> 00:03:29,779
Even you.

47
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,365
No.

48
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:34,866
No.

49
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:38,160
The only thing that pulled me in was you.

50
00:03:38,245 --> 00:03:41,079
Being friends with your brother
is just a bonus.

51
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,375
That's good.

52
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:50,745
That's good. It's nice to come first
every once in a while.

53
00:03:54,383 --> 00:03:55,414
Want to go for a drive?

54
00:04:34,124 --> 00:04:36,366
-Yeah?
-The hijackers have hit again.

55
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:41,535
Bi/kins has decided that we're gonna move
on Johnny Tran and his guys at 17:00.

56
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,504
Un/ess you say otherwise.

57
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,464
/f you agree, just say yes.

58
00:04:46,092 --> 00:04:48,085
-Yeah.
-Who is that?

59
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:52,089
It's just a wrong number.

60
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:46,439
Yes, sir. Yeah, I know, but--

61
00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:49,326
Yeah. Yes, sir.

62
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:50,946
Yeah. I got it.

63
00:07:55,331 --> 00:07:57,371
The DVD players were purchased legally.

64
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,708
All we've got are a couple
of low-rent weapons charges...

65
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:03,083
...and some outstanding speeding tickets.

66
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:04,831
-So, they're out.
-Yeah.

67
00:08:05,048 --> 00:08:06,625
Father bailed them out.

68
00:08:07,758 --> 00:08:11,506
Is this the kind of intelligence
I can expect from you, O'Conner?

69
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:19,515
-You're gonna put this on me?
-I can put it on whoever I want to.

70
00:08:19,601 --> 00:08:22,306
-Perks of the job.
-No, you can't put this on me--

71
00:08:22,395 --> 00:08:24,269
No, wait a minute. Let me tell you.

72
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:28,566
I don't care if you have to aim at someone
and blow your cover to smithereens.

73
00:08:28,651 --> 00:08:31,188
You've got 36 hours to crack this bastard...

74
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:34,361
...or you might want to think
about another career.

75
00:08:45,414 --> 00:08:48,830
It's Toretto, Brian.
It always has been Toretto.

76
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,083
Tran and Hector are....

77
00:08:52,503 --> 00:08:54,295
They're just fumes.

78
00:08:57,549 --> 00:09:00,254
I know you've been lying to me.
My question is this:

79
00:09:00,343 --> 00:09:04,008
Have you been lying to yourself
because you can't see past Mia?

80
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,632
He won't go back to prison.

81
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:12,471
Well, that's a choice
he's going to have to make.

82
00:09:16,565 --> 00:09:18,972
There's all kinds of family, Brian.

83
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:23,188
And that's a choice
you're gonna have to make.

84
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,203
You ready for this?

85
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,443
Nice car.
What's the retail on one of those?

86
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,643
More than you can afford, pal. Ferrari.

87
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:23,321
Smoke him.

88
00:11:18,248 --> 00:11:20,039
So, what's wrong, Brian?

89
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:22,708
Nothing, man, I'm fine.

90
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:26,419
Come on. Obviously something's off.

91
00:11:26,964 --> 00:11:30,664
Look, I have my good days and bad days
just like anybody else.

92
00:11:31,343 --> 00:11:34,925
Brian, don't lose that cool of yours.
That's your meal ticket.

93
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:39,723
My meal ticket?
I can't pay for my own shrimp?

94
00:11:39,891 --> 00:11:41,350
I got the shrimp.

95
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:44,341
No, that's one thing about me
you don't understand.

96
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:48,101
I don't take handouts.
I earn my way, every step.

97
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:51,396
I need something extra on the side,
like you.

98
00:11:51,484 --> 00:11:53,441
What do you mean, like me?

99
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:56,606
-What's that supposed to mean?
-That's what I mean.

100
00:11:56,697 --> 00:11:59,401
-What does that mean, like me?
-Don't try--

101
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:01,608
I'm not stupid, all right?

102
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:06,072
I know that there's no way you paid
for all that shit you got under the hood--

103
00:12:06,163 --> 00:12:09,531
There's no way you paid for
what's under the hood of those cars...

104
00:12:09,624 --> 00:12:12,375
...by doing tune-ups and selling groceries.

105
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,211
Whatever it is you're in on,
I want in on it, too.

106
00:12:39,065 --> 00:12:41,141
-Well, what is this?
-Read it.

107
00:12:41,942 --> 00:12:44,231
-What is this for?
-It's directions.

108
00:12:46,238 --> 00:12:47,945
To Race Wars.

109
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:50,239
We'll see how you go.

110
00:12:51,242 --> 00:12:52,866
Then we'll talk.

111
00:13:39,156 --> 00:13:40,780
-How's it going?
-What's up?

112
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:43,535
-Welcome to Race Wars.
-Great. Thanks a lot.

113
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,637
Baby. Hey, baby.

114
00:14:09,806 --> 00:14:11,633
You should watch from the side.

115
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,180
I wouldn't want to get exhaust
on that pretty face.

116
00:14:14,268 --> 00:14:18,348
-Put your money where your mouth is.
-I'll race you for that sweet little ass.

117
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:20,894
You want ass,
why don't you hit Hollywood Boulevard?

118
00:14:20,982 --> 00:14:24,066
You want an adrenaline rush,
it'll be two large.

119
00:14:24,151 --> 00:14:27,152
Right here. Right now.
What's it gonna be?

120
00:14:29,823 --> 00:14:31,233
You got it.

121
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,296
"Another one bites the dust"

122
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,504
Come on. What you got?

123
00:14:59,222 --> 00:15:00,680
See ya.

124
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,623
-What's up?
-Hey, what's up, Jesse?

125
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:41,369
What's in your hand?

126
00:15:41,465 --> 00:15:43,837
Throwing down the pink slip, just like you.

127
00:15:43,925 --> 00:15:46,546
-The pink slip to what? The Jetta?
-Yeah.

128
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,507
-You can't bet your dad's car.
-It's all right.

129
00:15:49,597 --> 00:15:50,877
I ain't losing.

130
00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:54,472
This fool is running a Honda 2000.
I'll win.

131
00:15:54,643 --> 00:15:59,185
That way, me and my dad can roll
when he gets out of prison. It's all good.

132
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:02,889
They're gonna throw him right back
in prison after he kills you.

133
00:16:10,531 --> 00:16:12,487
You visualize the win.

134
00:16:12,574 --> 00:16:16,238
Visualize the win, Jesse. I'm serious.
You got to listen to me, man.

135
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:17,869
Who are you racing?

136
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:24,455
Jesse, don't do it.

137
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:28,248
I bet you he's got more than $100,000
under the hood of that car.

138
00:16:51,398 --> 00:16:52,975
Too soon, junior.

139
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,476
No!

140
00:17:00,614 --> 00:17:01,811
Shit!

141
00:17:02,448 --> 00:17:03,611
Oh, God!

142
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,710
Yo! Heads up, bro. We got problems.

143
00:17:16,794 --> 00:17:18,537
-What?
-Jesse.

144
00:17:20,046 --> 00:17:22,085
Where's Jesse going?

145
00:17:22,256 --> 00:17:25,755
-He just raced Tran for slips.
-Oh, shit.

146
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:40,555
-Where's he going?
-He went to the car wash.

147
00:17:40,772 --> 00:17:42,728
Whatever. Go fetch my car.

148
00:17:43,315 --> 00:17:44,940
Go fetch your car?

149
00:17:45,901 --> 00:17:47,561
We're not on your block.

150
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:50,273
You better watch who you talk to like that.

151
00:17:50,822 --> 00:17:51,936
Toretto!

152
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,115
SWAT came into my house...

153
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:02,324
...disrespected my whole family,
because somebody narked me out.

154
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,495
And you know what? It was you!

155
00:18:29,854 --> 00:18:31,893
Get off of him, man.

156
00:18:41,238 --> 00:18:43,029
Dom, chill out, man. Come on!

157
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:44,906
I never narked on nobody!

158
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:47,523
I never narked on nobody!

159
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:27,604
Mia.

160
00:19:32,363 --> 00:19:34,735
I have respected you
and I haven't said shit.

161
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:36,567
Now I am asking you not to go.

162
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:39,529
-I'm doing this for both of us.
-Don't give me that crap.

163
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:41,078
You're doing this for you.

164
00:19:41,162 --> 00:19:45,290
Why are you insisting on doing this?
Dom, please, just don't.

165
00:19:57,259 --> 00:19:59,750
-Mia, what's going on?
-What?

166
00:19:59,844 --> 00:20:02,335
-You know what I'm talking about.
-No, I don't.

167
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,679
You always have tears in your eyes
when Dom drives away?

168
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:07,350
What's the matter with you?

169
00:20:07,434 --> 00:20:10,007
What's he racing off
in the middle of the night for?

170
00:20:10,103 --> 00:20:13,269
-You know about the trucks?
-No, Brian! What trucks?

171
00:20:13,356 --> 00:20:17,222
-Jesus Christ. What?
-Listen to me.

172
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:19,943
Mia, I'm a cop.

173
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:24,156
What are you talking about, Brian?
What is this?

174
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:27,690
Ever since the first time I met you,
I've been undercover.

175
00:20:28,952 --> 00:20:30,150
I'm a cop.

176
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:36,831
Oh, you bastard.

177
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:40,949
You bastard.

178
00:20:43,339 --> 00:20:45,165
-Mia.
-Get off of me, Brian!

179
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:47,000
Mia! Listen to me!

180
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:50,832
Everything I ever said
I felt about you was real.

181
00:20:50,928 --> 00:20:53,549
I swear to God.
You have to believe me, Mia.

182
00:20:53,639 --> 00:20:57,256
But this isn't about you and me.
Your brother's out there to pull a job.

183
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:00,801
We're running out of time. Those truckers
aren't laying down anymore.

184
00:21:00,895 --> 00:21:04,643
Maybe they'll make it through tonight,
but every law enforcement agency...

185
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:06,439
...is coming down on them.

186
00:21:06,524 --> 00:21:09,441
If you don't want anything to happen
to them...

187
00:21:09,527 --> 00:21:12,611
...you have to get in that car
with me right now and help me.

188
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:17,488
Mia, you are the only person
that can help me right now.

189
00:21:18,284 --> 00:21:21,617
Please, Mia. Please help me.

190
00:21:33,547 --> 00:21:36,381
Civics are stashed somewhere
outside of Thermal.

191
00:21:36,466 --> 00:21:39,751
They wouldn't double back,
and Highway 10 is too well patrolled.

192
00:21:39,843 --> 00:21:42,797
-So, what does that leave us with?
-All this.

193
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:54,598
-Nexte/.
-This is Officer Brian O'Conner.

194
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:59,149
Serial number 34762.
I need a cell phone trace.

195
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,395
-Okay. What's the ce// number?
-Mia, what is it?

196
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:07,696
Come on, Mia.
She needs Dom's cell phone number now.

197
00:22:11,036 --> 00:22:15,744
323-555-6439.

198
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,405
Thank you. Yeah, you get that?

199
00:22:45,606 --> 00:22:49,437
All right, we're one man short.
Letty, I need you on the left side.

200
00:22:51,736 --> 00:22:55,069
Your sister's right about this one.
This don't feel good.

201
00:22:55,197 --> 00:22:59,324
-Don't do that.
-Something's wrong.

202
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:02,243
-Stop.
-We shouldn't be doing this without Jesse.

203
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:06,324
This is the mother Iode.
We've been on this for three months.

204
00:23:06,415 --> 00:23:08,905
After this, it's a long vacation for everyone.

205
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,957
-Let's go.
-I hope so.

206
00:23:14,505 --> 00:23:17,588
Listen, the other night I had a dream...

207
00:23:18,091 --> 00:23:20,795
...that you and I were
on the beach in Mexico.

208
00:23:21,177 --> 00:23:23,216
-Really?
-Really.

209
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:28,547
Come on. Let's make this happen.

210
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:36,139
-Leon, keep on those scanners.
-Copy that.

211
00:23:39,692 --> 00:23:41,731
All right, let's go.

212
00:23:52,327 --> 00:23:55,411
Okay, we traced the number
to the northbound 86.

213
00:23:55,497 --> 00:23:59,992
Mi/e 114, outside Coache//a.
We'// keep the trace open, Officer.

214
00:24:00,334 --> 00:24:01,745
Let me see this.

215
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:08,789
I think we're about 40 miles away.

216
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,841
What are you gonna do?

217
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:14,128
What are you gonna do?

218
00:24:46,414 --> 00:24:48,489
Okay! Go time!

219
00:25:04,178 --> 00:25:06,633
We're all good.
I got nothing on the scanners.

220
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:08,002
Keep going.

221
00:25:22,568 --> 00:25:23,731
Vince!

222
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:26,479
Vince, don't! Get back in!

223
00:25:28,073 --> 00:25:29,187
Vince!

224
00:25:34,828 --> 00:25:36,536
He's got a damn shotgun! Leon!

225
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:38,910
Back off! Get him off of there!

226
00:25:41,584 --> 00:25:42,864
Oh, shit!

227
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,596
Get me off this thing! Pull up!

228
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:01,055
Unhook yourself. Do it!

229
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,426
-Do it!
-I can't get--

230
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:04,894
You can do it!

231
00:26:05,937 --> 00:26:07,396
Come on, Vince!

232
00:26:14,903 --> 00:26:17,476
Dom! I'm pulling up to distract him!

233
00:26:24,953 --> 00:26:26,411
Come on, boy!

234
00:26:27,622 --> 00:26:29,744
Shot doesn't get better than this.

235
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:36,075
Son of a bitch!

236
00:26:40,924 --> 00:26:43,249
Take me off here,
or I'll have to unhook the wire!

237
00:26:43,343 --> 00:26:47,589
Try it again. One, two, three!

238
00:26:59,607 --> 00:27:01,184
Unhook yourself!

239
00:27:02,943 --> 00:27:04,816
I can't get my arm free!

240
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:07,144
-Vince, grab my hand!
-My arm!

241
00:27:07,238 --> 00:27:09,029
Listen, give me your hand.

242
00:27:09,198 --> 00:27:11,653
I'm gonna pull you off the rig!

243
00:27:14,827 --> 00:27:16,452
Vince!

244
00:27:16,537 --> 00:27:18,529
Hold on!

245
00:27:18,622 --> 00:27:20,745
Give me your hand! Listen to me!

246
00:27:27,588 --> 00:27:28,583
Dominic!

247
00:27:28,672 --> 00:27:29,870
Shit!

248
00:27:33,426 --> 00:27:35,549
-Dominic!
-Hang on!

249
00:27:36,137 --> 00:27:39,054
Dom! Move out of the way.
I'm coming to get him.

250
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,488
Letty!

251
00:28:06,286 --> 00:28:07,317
Leon!

252
00:28:07,412 --> 00:28:08,491
Pull back for Letty.

253
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,860
Get her out of there/

254
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:11,367
I'm on it! Go!

255
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:23,217
I've got her! You get Vince off that truck.

256
00:28:28,555 --> 00:28:30,796
Letty! Come on, baby.

257
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:32,928
You okay?

258
00:28:33,017 --> 00:28:35,424
Oh, shit. Come on, girl, you all right?

259
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,101
Come on, let me look at you.
Come on. We got to go. Let's go.

260
00:28:52,908 --> 00:28:54,402
Vince!

261
00:29:22,683 --> 00:29:23,845
Take the wheel.

262
00:29:23,934 --> 00:29:26,638
-What do you mean?
-Put your foot on the gas!

263
00:29:27,395 --> 00:29:29,683
I'm gonna get him.
Put your foot on the gas!

264
00:29:29,772 --> 00:29:31,017
Okay!

265
00:29:34,401 --> 00:29:37,484
-Come on. Keep it steady.
-I got it!

266
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,986
All right, hold on, Vince.

267
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:44,699
He's having a hard time holding on.
Get me a little closer.

268
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,064
All right.

269
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:49,069
-Closer.
-I'm moving in.

270
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,032
Hold it right there!

271
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:52,952
Go!

272
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,699
You got to hang in here with me now!

273
00:29:57,795 --> 00:29:59,953
We'll get you off. Give me your arm!

274
00:30:00,047 --> 00:30:02,205
Vince, look at me! Don't let go!

275
00:30:06,177 --> 00:30:08,750
Come on, Vince!
Throw this arm around me!

276
00:30:09,555 --> 00:30:11,879
Vince, don't let go!

277
00:30:16,102 --> 00:30:18,177
Come on, Mia. Get closer!

278
00:30:23,733 --> 00:30:25,441
Mia, get closer! Come on.

279
00:30:25,526 --> 00:30:27,399
Come on, Vince. Here we go!

280
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:56,748
Shit.

281
00:31:00,388 --> 00:31:03,922
It's gonna be okay, Letty. I love you.

282
00:31:07,185 --> 00:31:08,810
-Watch her.
-I got her.

283
00:31:09,729 --> 00:31:12,267
Come on, Vince! Hang in there! Come on!

284
00:31:16,443 --> 00:31:19,609
If he doesn't get to an ambulance
in 10 minutes, he's dead.

285
00:31:19,696 --> 00:31:22,151
-Hold the pressure. Hold his arm up.
-I got it.

286
00:31:28,077 --> 00:31:31,031
Yeah. Yeah, this is Officer Brian O'Conner.

287
00:31:31,247 --> 00:31:33,702
I'm off-duty MAPD.

288
00:31:33,832 --> 00:31:36,619
I need a life flight roll out right away.

289
00:31:37,752 --> 00:31:42,045
My 20 is Highway 86, mile marker 147.

290
00:31:42,589 --> 00:31:45,625
I got one trauma victim,
about 24 years of age.

291
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:48,290
Six-foot, maybe 200 pounds.

292
00:31:48,469 --> 00:31:52,217
He's got a deep laceration to his right arm
with arterial bleeding.

293
00:31:52,306 --> 00:31:56,682
And he's got a shotgun wound
close range to his left flank.

294
00:31:58,603 --> 00:32:00,511
Yeah, he's going into shock!

295
00:33:40,562 --> 00:33:42,470
Dom, put the gun down now!

296
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,892
-Move your car.
-No bullshit!

297
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,439
Put it down now! No more running!

298
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,111
I'm not running!

299
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:56,647
-Where's Leon and Letty?
-They're long gone!

300
00:33:56,741 --> 00:33:59,777
Then it's over.
I didn't call the police, but don't push me!

301
00:33:59,869 --> 00:34:02,786
-Put the gun down. I swear to God!
-You are the cop!

302
00:34:02,872 --> 00:34:04,282
You're a cop!

303
00:34:05,874 --> 00:34:09,242
Brian, I got to find Jesse before they do.

304
00:34:09,335 --> 00:34:12,205
-I'm all the kid's got.
-I'll call in the plates.

305
00:34:12,296 --> 00:34:15,996
PD will pick him up way before
Johnny even gets near him.

306
00:34:16,174 --> 00:34:19,625
-Move your car.
-Dom, stop it! It's over. Please.

307
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,468
Mia, stay out of it!

308
00:34:27,016 --> 00:34:30,219
Dominic, I am so sorry.

309
00:34:30,603 --> 00:34:32,809
I don't know what I'm doing, Dom.

310
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:37,142
I'm so scared right now.
I don't know what's going on.

311
00:34:37,233 --> 00:34:39,984
What were you thinking, man?

312
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:42,559
I don't know! I panicked! I'm sorry.

313
00:34:42,654 --> 00:34:44,563
I'm scared!

314
00:34:44,656 --> 00:34:47,740
I don't know what I'm doing!
Will you please help me?

315
00:34:52,287 --> 00:34:53,781
Dom!

316
00:35:12,637 --> 00:35:13,965
Jesse!

317
00:35:14,055 --> 00:35:15,549
No, Jesse!

318
00:35:30,277 --> 00:35:31,901
No, Dom, no!

319
00:38:26,755 --> 00:38:30,124
Call 911. You call 911!

320
00:39:04,953 --> 00:39:07,705
I used to drag here back in high school.

321
00:39:08,415 --> 00:39:12,577
That railroad crossing up there
is exactly a quarter mile away from here.

322
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:16,373
On green, I'm going for it.

323
00:41:50,923 --> 00:41:53,165
That's not what I had in mind.

324
00:42:39,714 --> 00:42:41,622
You know what you're doing?

325
00:42:42,091 --> 00:42:44,166
I owe you a 10-second car.

326
00:49:57,949 --> 00:50:00,618
I live my life a quarter mile at a time.

327
00:50:02,244 --> 00:50:03,904
Nothing else matters.

328
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:07,534
For those 10 seconds or less...

329
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,245
...i'm free.
