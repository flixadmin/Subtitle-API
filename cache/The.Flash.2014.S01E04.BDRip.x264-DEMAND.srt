1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,604
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,765
When I was a child, I saw my mother
killed by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,400
My father went to
prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,567
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,851
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,523
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,209
And one day, I'll find who killed my
mother and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,203
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,044
Previously on The Flash: What
did you say your name was again?

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,771
- Barry Allen.
- Felicity.

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,767
How's Barry doing?

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,889
- It's a secret.
- What kind of secret?

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,930
- The kind I have to keep.
- I just have a little experience...

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,084
with liking someone who
doesn't see you the same way.

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,368
- Dad, the thing is...
- You two are dating.

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,249
- So you're not mad?
- Oh, I'm mad.

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,568
What does the fastest man
alive do on his day off?

18
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,720
Before the lightning...

19
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,611
if I wasn't still at the lab,
I'd be at home chilling.

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,285
Now my days off are different.

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,010
Now they aren't so lonely.

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,128
The lightning didn't
just give me speed...

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,921
it also gave me friends.

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,847
- This isn't remotely anatomically correct.
- That's not the point, Dr. Snow.

25
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,009
Then what is the point?

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,207
To have fun.

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,567
And to continue your
ongoing training.

28
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,009
We're testing the speed of your mind
by pushing your ability to multitask.

29
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,600
I'm waiting on you, Dr. Wells.

30
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,687
One hundred
eighty-two seconds, gentlemen.

31
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,371
Heads up.
I think we got something.

32
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,042
Two-eleven. Two-eleven.
We're being robbed.

33
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,284
Hey, cool it.

34
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,126
A hundred fifty-eight
seconds to go.

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,005
Checkmate.

36
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,367
- Wait, checkmate?
- Checkmate.

37
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,803
I guess we still have a few things
left to learn, don't we, Mr. Allen?

38
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,289
Armed robbery at
Fourth and Kolins.

39
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,687
For the record, I crushed it
in Operation and Ping-Pong.

40
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,006
It's not as easy as it looks.

41
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,681
Where's the nearest hospital?

42
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,968
St. Andrews.
Seven blocks north, two east.

43
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,124
Call the ER, tell them
they have an incoming GSW.

44
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,681
I want this locked up all the
way to the end of the block.

45
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,805
Tow truck was stolen.

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,244
The armored car driver is in stable condition,
though no one's sure how he got there.

47
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,084
Did you check the
security cameras?

48
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,562
Camera storage drive was stolen.
Guys are pros.

49
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,728
Everything's still here.

50
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,043
Including what I think they're
after. The Kahndaq Dynasty diamond.

51
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,806
It was on its way to Central
City Museum for exhibition.

52
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,611
Right. Iris was trying
to talk me into going.

53
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,641
I'm not much of a museum guy, but
she really wants to do something...

54
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,722
I'm just gonna walk away now.

55
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,325
Sorry, captain, I was at the
hospital visiting a friend.

56
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,802
There's nothing missing. It looks
like someone interrupted the robbery.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,731
- Guard says there was three of them.
- Actually, it was four.

58
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,771
I mean that's how many I would bring if
I were doing a robbery of this nature.

59
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,849
That's definitely
a four-guy truck.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,924
A driver,
two more to cover the guards...

61
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,846
and somebody used liquid nitrogen
to open this door, so four bad guys.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,367
Thank you, Mr. Allen,
for your brilliant insight.

63
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,326
For somebody so fast,
you're slow on the improvising.

64
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,205
Did you see anything that
can help us catch these guys?

65
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,246
Yeah.

66
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,488
One of them lost his mask.

67
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,846
I saw his face.

68
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,366
Look at these mug shots of Central City's
most wanted. See if you can find...

69
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,567
That's him.

70
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,485
Damn.

71
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,846
Leonard Snart.

72
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,281
"Leonard"? That's almost
as bad as "Bartholomew."

73
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,726
Snart ain't sexy either.

74
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,730
Snart's father was a cop.
A bad cop.

75
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,605
Took his anger out on his kids,
till he went to prison.

76
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,043
Snart's dad is in prison too?
We should start a club.

77
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,929
He shows up, like,
every six months.

78
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,651
He cases a job for weeks
before he makes his move.

79
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,848
Then he does a job, gets away.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,048
That's before the
Streak was around.

81
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,726
Did you just refer to yourself
in the third person?

82
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,850
I referred to the Streak. I've
been thinking of a new name.

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,446
- What do you think about the Flash...?
- Coffee break.

84
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,082
Thought I'd bring Central City's finest
java over to Central City's finest.

85
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,282
Thanks, I'm off caffeine.

86
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,531
My dad's been mad ever since
I told him about me and Eddie.

87
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,967
No, you mean he's mad at you
because you didn't tell him.

88
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,444
Uh, that sounds like you're taking his side.
You know his "I'm not talking to you...

89
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,763
but I have a bag full of judgmental
looks I'll try on you later"?

90
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,321
I've been on the receiving
end of those a few times.

91
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,006
Speaking of communications,
or lack thereof...

92
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,766
after all these journalism
classes, I got an idea.

93
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,604
- Huh.
- I started a blog.

94
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,003
What's it about? Your brownie
obsession? You shouldn't broadcast that.

95
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,801
No. Something important. Something
Central City needs to know about:

96
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,769
The Streak.

97
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,890
He's out there, Barry.

98
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,725
Rumor has it he stopped
an armed car robbery earlier.

99
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,451
- Heh. - I was hoping
I could take a look at the file...

100
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,127
I'm not at liberty to discuss an
ongoing police investigation with you.

101
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,760
Since when, Mr. Blabbermouth?

102
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,681
Take it from someone who's been studying
the impossible since they were 11.

103
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,884
Blogging about this, it's gonna
bring the crazies to your door.

104
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,442
- My blog is anonymous.
- Anonymous or not, it's not safe.

105
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,729
You never know what kind of weirdoes
are out there on the Internet.

106
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,405
I can vouch for that.

107
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,127
The Internet is full of
weirdoes, and nerd rage.

108
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,169
Lots and lots of nerd rage.

109
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,446
Hi. Felicity Smoak.

110
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,011
Iris West.

111
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,204
Barry Allen.
But you both already knew that.

112
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,011
- Uh, Felicity is... - The girl
that you met in Starling City.

113
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,486
The computer-er, right?

114
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,481
You two worked on one of Barry's
unexplainable cases.

115
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,690
Which, long story short,
was definitely explainable.

116
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,969
So the lightning
came through here?

117
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,204
Yeah.

118
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,962
There's been some rumors
the last few weeks.

119
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,044
People seen a red blur
tearing through the streets.

120
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,486
What the hell is it, man?

121
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,085
Maybe it was a drone.

122
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,483
Some top-secret army thing.

123
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,767
When I was a kid...

124
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,084
my grandfather used to take my sister
and me to this diner, The Motor Car.

125
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,409
Food was for crap,
but the view was great.

126
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,404
Right across from the
Central City precinct.

127
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,885
I still go there. I listen to their
radios, I learn their response times.

128
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,769
There are 40 banks
in Central City...

129
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,691
each of them within 60 seconds
of police response.

130
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,327
That's the advantage of hitting
a moving target.

131
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,448
Once the armored car called 911

132
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,884
we had 182 seconds before any
cop could be on the scene.

133
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,840
No one could've gotten there
fast enough to stop us.

134
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,322
But something did.

135
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,241
And you lost your cool.

136
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,004
You know the rules.

137
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,170
We don't shoot guards or cops,
unless it's the only option.

138
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,606
We don't need the heat.

139
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,449
The heat?

140
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,121
What the hell do you
think the blur is, Snart?

141
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,566
You're right.

142
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,883
Screw this, screw you. I'm out.

143
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,801
Well, if you're out, you're out.

144
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,488
This blur...

145
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,525
is a man.

146
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,925
We're gonna have to up our game.

147
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,883
Iris seems very nice.

148
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,408
And really pretty,
like super pretty.

149
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,607
Congratulations.

150
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,204
Iris isn't my girlfriend.

151
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,362
She's just a friend...

152
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,931
who actually has a boyfriend.

153
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,647
Oh. That's interesting.

154
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,290
I guess.

155
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,569
What are you really doing here?
I mean, it's good to see you...

156
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,883
but do you and Oliver
need something...? No.

157
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,247
No, I came because
I wanted to see you.

158
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,161
L... Heh.
I heard you're out of the coma.

159
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,722
Didn't call. Didn't write.

160
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,726
Didn't race over...

161
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,891
Oliver told you?

162
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,801
Honestly, I heard you two talking on
that rooftop in Starling City that night.

163
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,571
I wanna see it.

164
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,410
And by "it" I mean your speed.

165
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,406
In case you thought I was talking
about something else, which I was not.

166
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,771
- Uh, okay, you see that building?
- Uh-huh.

167
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,923
Keep your eyes on it.

168
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,084
Whoo-hoo!

169
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,762
You took a picture of me?

170
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,129
- From the top of that building?
- Yeah. Don't Instagram that.

171
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,328
- Unbelievable.
- Heh.

172
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,450
Your shoes are smoking!

173
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,447
That's fine, it happens sometimes.
That's why I have a friction-proof suit.

174
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,445
Where did you get that?

175
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,765
I'll show you.

176
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,730
This is where my team monitors
the police bands for activity.

177
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,446
We can track anything that's
happening. Check this out:

178
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,802
- We've got our own satellite.
- I know.

179
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,486
- I've hacked into it from time to time.
- Rude.

180
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,849
It is, of course, so wonderful
to see you again, Felicity.

181
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,642
I'm just wondering how much of our
operation she needs to know about.

182
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,484
I'm really good at
keeping secrets.

183
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,007
- Felicity works for the Arrow.
- Sweet.

184
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,531
And you, apparently, are not.

185
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,162
Now it's all making sense.
You know who the Arrow is.

186
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,481
Wait.

187
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,324
Do you know who the Arrow is?

188
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,490
Uh...

189
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,486
Let's just say that my team has a similar
setup but with more pointy objects.

190
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,846
Welcome, Miss Smoak.

191
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,325
Dr. Wells?

192
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,767
The Dr. Wells?

193
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,691
Please call me Harrison,
Felicity.

194
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,001
You know who I am?

195
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,324
Ranked second in the National Informative
Technology competition at age 19.

196
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,967
Graduated MIT with master's degree in
cyber security and computer sciences.

197
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,849
I know who you are.

198
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,004
I keep an eye out for promising
talent in scientific fields.

199
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,367
That's what brought
me Cisco and Caitlin.

200
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,567
And I foresaw...

201
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,687
great things from you.

202
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,208
Speaking of great things...

203
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,203
wanna see something cool?

204
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,050
- How fast can he run?
- He hasn't reached his top speed yet...

205
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,043
theoretically speaking.

206
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,727
- So is he really okay? - His heart
rate is in normal range for him.

207
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,282
No, I mean,
the lightning bolt changed him.

208
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,209
Do any of you really
know how much?

209
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,362
We know a fair amount.

210
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,765
If everything about him is sped
up, is he gonna age faster?

211
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,924
What would happen if he ran too
fast? Would he just be running...

212
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,050
and then poof, he's dust
in a red costume?

213
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,242
Everything we do here, at S.T.A.R.
Labs, is to protect Barry Allen.

214
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,166
Trust us, Felicity,
he is in very good hands here.

215
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,250
Wanna see how fast
I can run backwards?

216
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,121
Don't worry.
He heals quickly too.

217
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,562
Ah, I don't get it.
Why would Snart come here?

218
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,250
Snart's been deterred before...

219
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,246
but once he goes after something, he
doesn't stop until he gets it, ever.

220
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,285
Joe, I want you to know that
I'm really serious about Iris.

221
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,086
She's an amazing woman.
I can really see myself...

222
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,807
Did I ever tell you about that wild
night I had my last day of college?

223
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,241
I don't think so. No.

224
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,801
Not even after we kicked
back a few beers after work?

225
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,805
We've never done that.

226
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,848
Oh, right. Those are things
I do with my friends.

227
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,209
Since we've never done those
things, we ain't friends.

228
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,962
So there's absolutely no reason I
need to know about your dating life.

229
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,285
I just don't want my personal relationship
with your daughter to affect our...

230
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,649
- working relationship. - It ain't
about you, Eddie. It's about her.

231
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,963
So as long as we don't
talk about you and her...

232
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,485
we will be cool.

233
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,722
Maybe we should just
listen to the radio.

234
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,886
When a man loves a woman

235
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,328
Let's get it on

236
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,245
Quiet is good.

237
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,685
Hey, you two.

238
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,041
We're not a two.

239
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,851
- Oh. No. We're a one and one.
- Yeah.

240
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,684
Has Barry been showing you some
of the sights in Central City?

241
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,367
Yes. Um, I have seen
some pretty amazing things.

242
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,845
Really?

243
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,889
Well, if you got some time...

244
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,361
maybe we can show you some
of Central City's nightlife.

245
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,525
Oh. No. I get plenty
of nightlife in Starling City.

246
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,241
This is something that I don't
think that you're gonna wanna miss.

247
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,608
Trivia Night at Jitters.

248
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,367
Eddie's not really excited about it,
I admit, but could be our night, guys.

249
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,330
Our night to win $75
worth of cappuccinos.

250
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,209
Uh, yum.

251
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,044
I'm gonna go call work, check
in, make sure everything's okay.

252
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,521
- I'll be back in a second.
- Okay.

253
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,203
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

254
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,364
Trivia Night with you and Eddie,
forcing this double-date thing.

255
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,562
Because that girl is great.

256
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,647
And she happens to come from your
very rare species of adorable nerds.

257
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,247
- Why didn't you tell me more about her?
- There's nothing to tell.

258
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,881
She's just a friend.

259
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,249
Barry, girls don't just hop on trains
and travel hundreds of miles...

260
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,485
to see someone that they don't like.
See, this is why you need my help.

261
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,088
Bring her tonight.
We'll have fun.

262
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,121
Yeah.

263
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,805
Fun.

264
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,921
You wanted state-of-the-art, Snart. I
bring you state-of-the-art, my good sir.

265
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,321
- What's this?
- It might not look like much...

266
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,767
but neverjudge a book
by its cover, you know?

267
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,764
Fires highly-concentrated
combustible liquid fuel...

268
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,002
that ignites on
contact with the air.

269
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,929
I don't need to heat things up.

270
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,242
I need to slow them down.

271
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,090
That's the one then.
You're drawn right to it.

272
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,443
Stolen from S.T.A.R. Labs
after the incident, heh...

273
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,843
with nothing but the skeleton security
crew to guard the tech inside.

274
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,121
Emits some sort of substance, not
sure what it is, like a white flame.

275
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,282
But it's not hot, it's cold.

276
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,762
Glasses look like they're made of
the same tech. What are they for?

277
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,440
Glare. You'll see.

278
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,602
Who else knows you took this?

279
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,450
Just us.

280
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,649
No, just me.

281
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,169
Sorry, pal.

282
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,531
Party people, who's ready
to get their trivia on?

283
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,727
Everybody, welcome.
We got some new challengers.

284
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,963
Please welcome E = MC Hammer.

285
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,322
I did it because E = MC squared is
Einstein's formula for kinetic energy, right?

286
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,443
And, you know,
"Can't touch this."

287
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,364
That's great, Barry.

288
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,443
So where is Felicity?

289
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,840
I'm not sure.

290
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,530
I told her it started at...

291
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,208
Feel free to buy
yourself that dress.

292
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,330
- Heh. Totally overdressed for
Trivia Night. - No, you look amazing.

293
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,607
Yeah, you do.

294
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,570
"E = MC Hammer."

295
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,048
- It's funny. Ha, ha.
- See?

296
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,847
It wasn't until 1852 when the
transcontinental rail road...

297
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,646
laid their tracks through
this thriving cattle town...

298
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,768
that we became
officially incorporated.

299
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,407
That same year the worst flood
this area has ever seen hit.

300
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,531
But from that disaster rose
Central City's greatest hero:

301
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,849
Cattle rancher Bobby
"Bovine" McFeely.

302
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,001
Bovine McFeely saved 17 cows
from the great flood.

303
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,801
Hey, kid. Gum?

304
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,802
And now for the exhibit I'm sure
you've all come here to see...

305
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,931
the historic Kahndaq
Dynasty diamond.

306
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,966
Be careful. Get too close and
you'll set off the proximity alarms.

307
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,327
Wouldn't want to do that.

308
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,165
Three is Pasteur. Mm-mm.

309
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,926
- Three is Erdel, and four is Pasteur.
- Right.

310
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,531
Five?

311
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,881
- Descartes.
- Descartes.

312
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,246
Are they even
speaking English?

313
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,564
And the points go
to E = MC Hammer.

314
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,265
- Yeah. All right. Ha, ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

315
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,529
I knew you two would
make a good team.

316
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,924
- So, Felicity, what do you do?
- I work in computer sciences...

317
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,162
at Queen Consolidated. Really?

318
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,164
Do you have a boyfriend
in Starling City?

319
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,164
Um, no. No, there is no one.

320
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,004
I'll get us more drinks.

321
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,051
And I had too many of those first
ones, so I will be right back.

322
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,883
- What?
- Dude.

323
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,810
"Dude"? What...?

324
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,851
Are you still gonna tell me she's
not into you? Look at that dress?

325
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,924
And when I asked her the
boyfriend question, she froze.

326
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,481
Yeah, you're particularly
sly with that one.

327
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,604
Felicity is smart,
nice and pretty.

328
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,641
And most importantly she is the first
girl that I have seen you with...

329
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,122
that understands and appreciates
you for the amazing person...

330
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,521
that I am always
telling you that you are.

331
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,126
She's perfect for you.

332
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,203
So, what are you waiting for,
Barry?

333
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,882
How long has it been missing?

334
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,202
I don't know.

335
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,326
I'm gonna ask you again, Cisco.

336
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,489
And when I do...

337
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,723
I expect a more specific answer
than "I don't know."

338
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,124
Now, how long has
this weapon been gone?

339
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,849
A day.

340
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,527
Maybe two. One janitor didn't
show up for work this morning.

341
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,769
He was probably the one who
took it. I didn't think that...

342
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,571
You didn't think.

343
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,441
Because if you had, you would've
discussed with me first...

344
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,241
your desire to build something that
could hurt anyone, and in particular...

345
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,164
Barry Allen.

346
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,890
I'm sorry.

347
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,202
If you just let me explain...

348
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,729
You know how I feel about weapons, Cisco,
they do not belong in S.T.A.R. Labs.

349
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,690
Now, you're gonna figure out
a way to locate this gun...

350
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,287
and you're gonna
do it right now.

351
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,082
This thing you built...

352
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,520
what can it do?

353
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,488
Bad stuff.

354
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,806
You said to call if there
was anything suspicious.

355
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,005
This guy went through the
tour twice. Nobody does that.

356
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,322
This is Detective West, I have a
visual on Leonard Snart at the museum.

357
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,369
Requesting immediate backup.

358
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,964
I'm sorry. I thought I knew it.
I got excited, and I just hit it.

359
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,726
Maybe they'll get it wrong too.

360
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,850
Oh, yeah, I'm sure that the team
named Pride and Padawans...

361
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,082
doesn't know the name
of Han Solo's ship.

362
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,924
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

363
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,604
Oh, honey, you are so cute
when you're confused.

364
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,325
Someone spotted Snart.
I gotta go.

365
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,403
- I'll cover for you.
- What will you say?

366
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,484
I tell people Oliver's at a
night club or nursing a hangover.

367
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,524
- None of which will work for me.
- Bad stomach ache. Diarrhea.

368
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,081
- I'm not comfortable with that excuse.
- Just go.

369
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,969
Stay safe.

370
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,846
And I'm talking to air now,
which is odd.

371
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,843
I'm still doing it.

372
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,691
Snafl!

373
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,448
- You okay?
- Aah!

374
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,409
It burns.

375
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,722
Time for a test run.

376
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,082
Let's see how fast you are.

377
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,851
No!

378
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,690
No.

379
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,243
- It's still numb.
- It's like third-degree frostbite.

380
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,801
- I thought he had hyper-healing
- it's been slowed.

381
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,645
If your cells weren't regenerating
at the rate they are...

382
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,802
your blood vessels would've
frozen solid.

383
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,521
The nerve damage would've been
permanent. You're lucky to be alive.

384
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,170
Snart wasn't another metahuman.

385
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,524
He has some kind of gun. It
froze things. It slowed me down.

386
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,368
Enough that I wasn't
able to save someone.

387
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,444
According to his records, Snart
didn't even finish high school.

388
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,849
So how did he build a handheld,
high-tech snow machine?

389
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,281
S.T.A.R. Labs
built the cold gun.

390
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,808
Dr. Wells and Caitlin
had nothing to do with this.

391
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,366
I built the gun.

392
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,450
You did?

393
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,290
- Why?
- Because speed and cold are opposites.

394
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,201
Temperature is measured by how quickly
the atoms of something are oscillating.

395
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,724
Faster they are, the hotter it is. When things
are cold, they're slower on the atomic level.

396
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,090
- When there's no movement,
it's called... - Absolute zero.

397
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,367
Yeah.

398
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,041
I designed a compact cryo-engine
to achieve absolute zero.

399
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,205
I built it to stop you.

400
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,244
I didn't know who you were then,
Barry.

401
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,371
I mean, what if you turned out to be
some psycho, like Martin or Nimbus?

402
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,841
But I didn't, did I?

403
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,927
We built the entire structure you're
standing in to do good, and it blew up.

404
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,365
You can understand why Cisco would
wanna be prepared for the worst.

405
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,131
I can understand that, but
what I can't understand is...

406
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,487
why you didn't tell
me what you did.

407
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,440
After all we've been through, I thought
you trusted me. I thought we were friends.

408
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,001
- We are, Barry.
- If you had just told me...

409
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,526
I could've been prepared.

410
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,567
But instead someone
died tonight.

411
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,889
And I have to live with that.

412
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,643
No, Cisco, we all do.

413
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,244
Theater-goers remain shaken after
surviving tonight's bizarre attack...

414
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,290
The news, are you okay?

415
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,680
I'm fine.

416
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,930
How long is this gonna go on?

417
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,961
Seems like the cold treatment
is going around.

418
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,363
- Not now, Iris, please?
- Yes, now.

419
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,491
You did the same thing when I signed up
for the police academy without telling you.

420
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,690
You didn't speak to me for weeks,
not until I withdrew my application.

421
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,808
Well, I am not withdrawing
this time, Dad.

422
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,247
I am dating Eddie,
whether you like it or not.

423
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,209
- Eddie is my partner.
- I know.

424
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,410
But you don't know. You're not a cop. You
don't know what having a partner means.

425
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,688
Wherever I go, he goes.

426
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,204
And where I go isn't
always safe, Iris.

427
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,007
I need to be 100
percent focused.

428
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,482
Now there's a part of me
that isn't focused...

429
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,604
that doesn't see Eddie as my
partner, but as your boyfriend.

430
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,768
So if he gets hurt...

431
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,730
or worse, and I'm there...

432
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,281
how am I gonna look at you?

433
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,965
How are you gonna look at me?

434
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,442
Now, I'm not mad at you.

435
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,850
But that's why this
is so hard for me.

436
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,845
Do you understand?

437
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,843
- We're going back tonight.
- Back where?

438
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,810
To the museum. That diamond
isn't gonna steal itself.

439
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,610
Super-gun freeze your brain,
Snart?

440
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,326
The museum will be crawling
with police and the Streak.

441
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,289
This can stop the Streak.
It hurt him.

442
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,523
And I know his real weakness,
so we go.

443
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,004
- Unless you want out.
- We both want out. Alive.

444
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,651
So you thought I
hadn't made a plan.

445
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,241
At least I taught you something.

446
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,851
So, what are you waiting for?
Shoot me.

447
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,131
You better put a bullet in my brain
right now because if you don't...

448
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,601
if I ever see either
one of you again...

449
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,401
You don't get it, do you?
This blur is out there.

450
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,522
Central City ain't your
playground anymore.

451
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,802
Sure it is.

452
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,285
Barry.

453
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,484
Barf)'-

454
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,290
What are you doing?

455
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,329
You should get
back to your hotel.

456
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,926
- Get some sleep.
- You should too.

457
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,124
Not go back to my hotel,
I meant get some sleep.

458
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,809
I can't.

459
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,685
Every time I close my eyes,
I see that man's face.

460
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,561
I watched him die.

461
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,209
I have to go faster.

462
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,045
Barry, it's not your fault.

463
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,323
And it's not Cisco's either.

464
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,650
I know you're upset, but you have to
look at this from his point of view.

465
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,049
No, I get it.
He didn't trust me.

466
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,604
Barry, when you met us...

467
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,810
me, Oliver and Dig, we were this
well-oiled archery machine...

468
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,282
but it didn't start out that
way. And unlike you guys...

469
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,762
we weren't tossed together overnight,
we came together one at a time.

470
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,969
It took much more than watching Oliver do
the salmon ladder to make me trust him.

471
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,766
I've seen firsthand what
this life can do to people.

472
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,609
It's a lonely path.

473
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,570
Don't make it any lonelier
than it has to be.

474
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,244
Freeze!

475
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,087
Wanna end up like that door?

476
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,323
Hi there.

477
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,242
I figured out a way
to track Captain Cold.

478
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,164
You gotta stop
naming these guys.

479
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,924
Barry, listen to him.

480
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,047
How?

481
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,885
The cold gun is powered
by an engine-control unit.

482
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,407
A microcomputer that regulates
air to fuel ratio...

483
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,564
so the sub-cooled fluid in the
chambers don't overflow and...

484
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,881
- Explode.
- Right.

485
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,647
This ECU was receiving updates
wirelessly from my tablet.

486
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,326
If I boost the signal
using Central City's network...

487
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,324
and send a false update, we'll
get a ping back and then...

488
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,482
We can locate Snart.

489
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,880
How long will it take?

490
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,567
Uh, first, I have to hack into the
city's network, so 30 minutes maybe?

491
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,250
I can do it in less than one.

492
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,926
When it comes to hacking,
I'm the fastest woman alive.

493
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,289
Ah! That was not as
badass as I pictured.

494
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,330
- All right, I'm in.
- Are you kidding?

495
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,171
All right,
I'm sending the updates.

496
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,369
- We're connected.
- Network is triangulating the location.

497
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,322
We got him. He's heading west on
Nelson toward the train station.

498
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,201
If he's leaving, it appears Mr. Snart
may have gotten what he came for.

499
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,131
When we put our minds to it,
dude, nothing can stop us.

500
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,762
Oh, you turned your earpiece off.
How are we gonna talk to each other?

501
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,006
I don't feel talking right now.

502
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,442
Suspect spotted at Central
City train station.

503
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,488
We got Snart.

504
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,321
- Wait here for backup.
- Wait for backup? No way.

505
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,124
That's an order.

506
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,570
You should go after Barry.

507
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,121
- You heard him, Felicity.
- He wants to do this alone.

508
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,527
Of course he said that.
He's hurt.

509
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,569
You're his team and his friends.

510
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,691
If I had a nickel for every time the Arrow
told me to back off, I'd be as rich as Oliver.

511
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,640
Who I mention because he's the
richest person I know, or used to be.

512
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,848
The point is...

513
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,246
you have your partner's back.
No matter what.

514
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,526
I have something
that might help.

515
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,801
I'm your partner,
not your assistant.

516
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,050
There's nowhere to run.

517
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,445
I didn't see you before.

518
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,807
Your mom know you're out
past your bedtime?

519
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,441
If you wanted to get away, you should've
taken something faster than a train.

520
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,882
That's if I wanted to get away.

521
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,730
I've seen your weakness.

522
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,727
At the armored car,
then at the theater.

523
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,124
So while you're busy saving
everybody, I'll be saving myself.

524
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,481
Good luck with that.

525
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,850
Pretty fast, kid.

526
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,051
But not fast enough.

527
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,886
Thank you.

528
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,328
- For what?
- You forced me to up my game.

529
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,967
Not only with this gun, but
with how I think about a job.

530
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,565
It's been educational.

531
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,767
Drop it.

532
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,810
This is a prototype cold gun, four
times the size, four times the power.

533
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,929
I was wondering who
you were talking to.

534
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,449
Hey, unless you wanna taste your
own medicine, I'd back the hell up.

535
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,967
Your hands are shaking.
You've never killed anyone.

536
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,209
There's a first time for
everything, Captain Cold.

537
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,401
I will shoot you.

538
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,288
You win, kid.

539
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,847
I'll see you around.

540
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,971
Hey, leave the diamond.

541
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,171
Don't push your luck.

542
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,088
I couldn't shoot
him if I wanted to.

543
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,567
This is actually the
S.T.A.R. Labs vacuum cleaner.

544
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,126
With a lot of LEDs.

545
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,882
Let's get you warm.

546
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,604
Thank you.

547
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,168
We've been trying
to track Snart...

548
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,369
but he must've disconnected
the signal somehow.

549
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,202
We'll find him, Cisco.

550
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,124
Together.

551
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,531
You have a great team here,
Barry.

552
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,490
Speaking of teams...

553
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,563
I should probably
get back to mine.

554
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,520
It's nice meeting you,
Miss Smoak.

555
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,081
Please extend a hello
to the Arrow for us.

556
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,446
I Will.

557
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,167
Bye, Felicity.

558
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,966
Bye, Barry.

559
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,444
Remarkable young woman.

560
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,568
She's special.

561
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,241
Yeah, she is.

562
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,727
Cisco...

563
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,089
don't you ever...

564
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,122
do anything like that again.
Do you understand me?

565
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,967
Yes, sir.

566
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,366
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

567
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,529
If you're looking for Eddie,
he's in Evidence.

568
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,848
I am looking for you.

569
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,891
I came to apologize again.

570
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,644
You're really trying to hit
that magic number, aren't you?

571
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,564
Look, Dad...

572
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,724
I just want you to know there
is nothing that you could do...

573
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,167
that would ever change
the way I look at you.

574
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:03,120
And I'm sorry. I should've thought how
it would affect you if Eddie and I...

575
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,930
Listen.

576
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,331
Chasing down this Snart
character tonight...

577
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,562
he had the draw on me.

578
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,968
Eddie saved my life.

579
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,330
Maybe I underestimated him.

580
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,325
From now on, no more secrets.

581
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,847
No more secrets.

582
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,290
- Well, go see Eddie.
- Heh, okay.

583
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,122
Thank him for watching out
for your old man.

584
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,365
- Did I just yelp?
- Ha, ha. Yeah.

585
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,847
- I yelped.
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

586
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,164
- Don't tell me you're here to save me.
- This is still one of the safest ways to travel.

587
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,051
I thought that was airplanes.

588
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,290
Remember you told me you had
a little experience...

589
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,920
liking somebody who didn't
see you the same way?

590
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,887
That was Iris, right?

591
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,369
How did you know?

592
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,488
It's the little things.

593
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,241
The way you linger on her
when she isn't looking.

594
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,846
The smile you fake
to play the part.

595
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,367
Quiet dreams you
keep to yourself.

596
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,531
Like you and Oliver.

597
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,525
Takes one to know one.

598
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,083
I'm afraid it'll
change everything.

599
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,289
It Will.

600
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,487
But maybe that's not
such a bad thing.

601
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,006
What is wrong with us? We are
perfectly perfect for each other.

602
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,730
Yet we're sitting here
pining for people we can't have.

603
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,370
Guess what they say is true.

604
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,289
Opposites do attract.

605
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,648
If you ever need anything,
I will race over in a heartbeat.

606
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,201
Same.
Well, as fast as I can run.

607
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,767
Which may take me a while,
but I will still come.

608
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,569
Bye, Felicity.

609
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,923
Bye, Barry.

610
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,249
Whoo-hoo!

611
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,445
I know it's been a while
since we pulled that job.

612
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,646
I know it didn't
go so well for you.

613
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,929
And I know I said we were
finished, but things have changed.

614
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:24,409
If I wanna keep working in Central
City, I'm gonna need a new kind of crew.

615
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,961
I'm gonna need someone like you.

616
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,364
You're tolerant of extremes,
you have certain skills.

617
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,364
You just need some direction.

618
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,046
And I can give that to you.

619
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,281
You still like
playing with fire?

620
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,363
You're gonna love this.

621
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,969
So...

622
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,488
are you in, Mick,
or are you out?

623
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,687
Yeah, buddy, I'm in.
