00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,357
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

314
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,735
ANATOLY, I CAN'T LET YOU
STEAL THESE DRUGS.

315
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,069
IT'S NOT MATTER OF "LET."

316
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,488
I HAVE INVITATION
TO BE HERE.

317
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,781
INVITATION? FROM WHOM?

318
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,287
OLIVER, HAVE YOU BROUGHT
ANATOLY KNYAZEV TO STAR CITY?

319
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,497
YES, I DID.

320
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,332
AND HE JUST TOLD ME
THAT HIS OPERATION

321
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,584
WAS NEARLY COMPROMISED
BY MY TEAM.

322
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,503
WELL, I SAID,
"THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

323
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,630
THE TEAM NO LONGER
EXISTS."

324
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,298
THE HELL IT DOESN'T!

325
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,216
WHEN I TOLD YOU TO STAND
DOWN, I MEANT IT.

326
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,842
ANATOLY IS HERE
FOR A REASON.

327
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,470
TO STEAL DRUGS.

328
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,221
I HAD TO GIVE HIM THAT
TO GET WHAT I WANTED.

329
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,768
HE'S HERE TO KILL
ADRIAN CHASE.

330
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,812
OLIVER.

331
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:20,360
WE DON'T HIRE CRIMINALS

332
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,029
AND PAY THEM
WITH DIABETES DRUGS.

333
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,572
CHASE HAS KILLED
INNOCENT PEOPLE

334
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,325
IN THIS WHOLE SICK GAME
HE'S BEEN PLAYING,

335
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,035
TRYING TO GET TO ME.

336
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,537
STAR CITY WILL NOT
BE SAFE

337
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,205
UNTIL HE IS
IN THE GROUND,

338
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,666
AND THERE IS NO PRICE
I WILL NOT PAY
TO SEE THAT HAPPEN.

339
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,834
EVEN SELLING YOUR SOUL?

340
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,377
BETTER MY SOUL
THAN YOURS

341
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:41,088
OR FELICITY'S OR CURTIS'
OR ANYONE ON THE TEAM.

342
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,009
SO YOU GOT ANATOLY
TO KILL CHASE

343
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,053
SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO.

344
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,596
I CREATED PROMETHEUS,
JOHN.

345
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,640
I CREATED
THIS WHOLE THING.

346
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:54,519
CHASE'S DEATH SHOULD BE
ON MY CONSCIENCE,

347
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,604
NOT YOURS.

348
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,483
WHAT THE HELL DID CHASE
DO TO YOU, MAN,

349
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,528
TO CONVINCE YOU TO THINK
THAT ANY OF THIS IS OK?

350
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,071
THIS IS A MISTAKE, OLIVER,

351
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,865
A MISTAKE THAT YOU WILL NOT
BE ABLE TO COME BACK FROM.

352
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,158
AND I'M NOT
GONNA LET YOU MAKE IT.

353
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,077
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA
LET YOU GET HURT.

354
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,497
AND SO HERE WE ARE.

355
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,252
FELICITY WAS RIGHT.

356
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,546
PROMETHEUS TRYING TO
CONVINCE YOU THAT YOU ARE

357
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,673
RESPONSIBLE
FOR EVERYTHING BAD

358
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,759
THAT'S HAPPENED TO PEOPLE,
OLIVER, I SWEAR THAT'S

359
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,301
JUST A BUNCH OF CRAP.

360
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:31,765
TELL THAT TO LAUREL.
TELL THAT TO...TOMMY.

361
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,391
TELL THAT
TO MY MOTHER.

362
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,142
TELL THAT
TO BILLY MALONE.

363
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,019
MAYBE TELL IT TO THEA.

364
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,648
SHE'S SO DAMAGED THAT
SHE HAD TO LEAVE TOWN.

365
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,317
THIS IS NOT
POST-TRAUMATIC
STRESS, JOHN.

366
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,779
THIS IS A TRUTH THAT I
WAS KEEPING MYSELF

367
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,448
FROM SEEING, AND I AM
NO LONGER DOING THAT.

368
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:52,159
ANATOLY AND HIS MEN WILL
KILL ADRIAN CHASE.

369
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,703
THAT IS THE SOLUTION.

370
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,791
THE TEAM IS DONE.

371
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,543
SO I'M TELLING YOU.
I'M NOT ASKING YOU.

372
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:05,047
I'M TELLING YOU...
FOR THE LAST TIME,

373
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,133
STAND DOWN.

374
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,401
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

375
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,445
REALLY? I MEAN, OLIVER
CAN'T GO AFTER CHASE HIMSELF,

376
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,613
SO HE FINDS GUYS WHO CAN?

377
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,239
HE LET THEM STEAL
FROM A COMPANY

378
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,741
THAT WAS BARELY HANGING ON.

379
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,993
OLIVER PUT HUNDREDS
OF JOBS ON THE LINE.

380
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,787
AND I KNOW HE KNOWS
THAT 'CAUSE I WAS
IN THE SAME BRIEFING.

381
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,121
YEAH. SPEAKING
OF WHICH,

382
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,790
WHY HAVEN'T YOU GONE
BACK INTO CITY HALL?

383
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,291
JOHN: BECAUSE LANCE
BANNED HIM TILL CHASE

384
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,918
IS TAKEN OFF THE BOARD.

385
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,419
SOMETHING TO DO WITH RENE
THREATENING TO "POP A CAP

386
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,796
IN HIS ASS."

387
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,926
WHAT ABOUT BREAKING
UP THE TEAM?

388
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,218
[SIGHS]

389
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,053
PROMETHEUS IS IN OLIVER'S
HEAD, CURTIS,

390
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,973
LIKE I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

391
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,766
HEY. CAN WE

392
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:57,809
TALK IN PRIVATE?

393
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,353
UM...YEAH.

394
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,562
YEAH.

395
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,164
HEY.

396
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,542
YOU AND I NEED TO
TALK SOME SENSE

397
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,460
INTO OLIVER BEFORE
HE DOES SOMETHING

398
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,045
THAT HE'S GONNA
REGRET.

399
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,964
I'M NOT STOPPING YOU.

400
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,216
WELL, FELICITY, I KNOW
YOU'RE FULL THROTTLE
WITH THIS HELIX,

401
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,718
BUT IT HAS TO BE
THE BOTH OF US.

402
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,344
WE HAVE TO PRESENT
A UNITED FRONT

403
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,971
SO WE HAVE
THE BEST CHANCE OF
GETTING THROUGH TO HIM.

404
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,931
-WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T.
-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

405
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,349
THE TEAM HAS BEEN AFTER
CHASE FOR MONTHS,

406
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,934
AND HE'S ALWAYS BEEN
ONE STEP AHEAD OF US.

407
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,561
IF OLIVER THINKS THAT THE
BRATVA IS OUR BEST CHANCE

408
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:42,979
AT GETTING TO HIM,

409
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:46,106
THEN MAYBE WE SHOULD STAY
OUT OF HIS WAY.

410
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,988
AND WHEN CHEMICALS

411
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,990
FROM BOTH
MEDICINES BIND,

412
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,951
IT CREATES
POWERFUL OPIOID.

413
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,579
IT'S MORE ADDICTIVE
THAN HEROIN.

414
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,748
JUST WHAT
THE WORLD NEEDS.

415
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,544
REVENUE IS
WHAT BRATVA NEEDS.

416
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:10,089
IT'S GOTTEN BAD, OLIVER.

417
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,008
I'M UNDER MUCH PRESSURE.

418
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,594
TH...THIS DRUG
WILL HELP SECURE

419
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,721
MY POSITION AS PAKHAN.

420
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,973
SO THAT'S WHY YOU NEED
THE MEDICINE.

421
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,309
TO MANUFACTURE
A STREET DRUG.

422
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,311
YOU SHOULDN'T
BE HERE, JOHN.

423
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,856
YOU SHOULD'VE KNOWN
THAT CURTIS WOULD HACK
THE LOCKS, OLIVER.

424
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,775
I DIDN'T THINK I COULD BE
MORE DISAPPOINTED.

425
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,901
I GUESS I WAS WRONG.

426
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,570
I'LL LET YOU HAVE ROOM.

427
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,744
I'M NOT GONNA KEEP
HAVING

428
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,412
THE SAME
CONVERSATION.

429
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,040
THAT'S TOO BAD 'CAUSE I
DEDICATED 5 YEARS OF MY LIFE

430
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:46,292
TO YOUR CRUSADE.

431
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,963
SO I'M THE ONE THAT GETS
TO SAY IF I NEED PROTECTING,

432
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,089
NOT YOU.

433
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,423
I'M NOT GONNA HAVE

434
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,841
YOUR DEATH
ON MY CONSCIENCE.

435
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,551
OLIVER, DON'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT YOUR CONSCIENCE,

436
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:58,178
NOT WHEN YOU GET BACK
IN BED WITH THE BRATVA.

437
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:01,849
THIS ISN'T YOU, MAN.

438
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,643
THE OLIVER I KNOW
WOULD NEVER LET

439
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,436
A GROUP OF DANGEROUS
CRIMINALS

440
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,271
CRAWL INTO HIS CITY,

441
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,189
LET THEM STEAL MEDICINE.

442
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,818
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT KIND OF MAN I AM.

443
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,488
WHAT?!

444
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,658
WHAT THE HELL DID CHASE
DO TO YOU, OLIVER?

445
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,200
WHATEVER IT WAS, HE M...HE
MESSED WITH YOUR HEAD

446
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,911
IN A WAY I DIDN'T THINK
WAS POSSIBLE.

447
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,997
LOOK AT ME, MAN.
I COULD HELP YOU.

448
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,581
I'M YOUR BROTHER.

449
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,416
YOU DON'T WANT ME
AS A BROTHER.

450
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,335
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

451
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,838
CHASE SHOWED ME
THE TRUTH ABOUT MYSELF.

452
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,758
YOU SIGNED ON
FOR A CRUSADE

453
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,302
THAT TURNED OUT TO BE
AN OUTLET.

454
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,472
IT WAS AN EXCUSE

455
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,683
FOR ME TO MURDER
PEOPLE.

456
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,101
OLIVER, PLEASE.

457
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,894
I PUT ON A HOOD,
AND I CREATED A PERSONA

458
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,939
BECAUSE, JOHN,
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY,

459
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,483
SOMETHING IN ME BROKE.

460
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,487
SOMETHING IS SICK
INSIDE OF ME.

461
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,739
THE CRUSADE...
ALL OF THIS...

462
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:02,284
THE FOUNDATION
OF IT IS A LIE.

463
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,370
SO I DISBANDED
THE TEAM

464
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,122
BECAUSE I WON'T
SIT BY

465
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:10,459
AND WATCH ALL OF YOU
PARTICIPATE

466
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,378
IN MY MURDER SPREE.

467
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,340
I AM
BEYOND REDEMPTION.

468
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,134
YOU AND THE TEAM
