1
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:00,032
I'll find you later.

2
00:04:02,702 --> 00:04:03,745
It's not safe.

3
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:08,833
Let me send some men with you.

4
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,255
I'm going alone.

5
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:03,596
In the name of the one true queen,
Daenerys Targaryen,

6
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,307
I sentence you to die.

7
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:08,684
Grey Worm!

8
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:17,026
It's over.

9
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:19,362
These men are prisoners.

10
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:21,739
It is not over until
the queen's enemies are defeated.

11
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:23,950
How much more defeated
do you want them to be?

12
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,993
- They're on their knees.
- They are breathing.

13
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:29,205
Look around you, friend. We won.

14
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,707
I obey my queen's commands,
not yours.

15
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,126
And what
are the queen's commands?

16
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:38,089
"Kill all who follow
Cersei Lannister."

17
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,675
These are free men.

18
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:43,135
They chose to fight for her.

19
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,850
Easy, men. Easy! Easy.

20
00:05:58,776 --> 00:05:59,819
Jon.

21
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,657
We should speak with the queen.

22
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,825
Blood of my blood.

23
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,419
You kept all your promises to me.

24
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:00,966
You killed my enemies
in their iron suits.

25
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,518
You tore down their stone houses.

26
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:20,819
You gave me the Seven Kingdoms!

27
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,002
Torgo Nudho.

28
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:42,925
You have walked beside me
since the Plaza of Pride.

29
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:47,012
You are the bravest of men,
the most loyal of soldiers.

30
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:51,266
I name you commander
of all my forces,

31
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:55,312
the Queen's Master of War.

32
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,869
Unsullied.

33
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:17,376
All of you were torn from your
mothers' arms and raised as slaves.

34
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,378
Now...

35
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,839
...you are liberators!

36
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:27,010
You have freed the people of King's
Landing from the grip of a tyrant!

37
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,515
But the war is not over.

38
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:37,688
We will not lay down our spears
until we have liberated

39
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,857
all the people of the world!

40
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,695
From Winterfell to Dorne,

41
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:49,366
from Lannisport to Qarth,

42
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:53,454
from the Summer Isles to the Jade Sea!

43
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:59,042
Women, men and children

44
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:03,088
have suffered too long
beneath the wheel.

45
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:08,886
Will you break the wheel with me?

46
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:20,938
You freed your brother.

47
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,877
You committed treason.

48
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:27,130
I freed my brother.

49
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,511
And you slaughtered a city.

50
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,804
Take him.

51
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,794
What are you doing here?

52
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:34,633
Hey, what happened?

53
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,468
I came to kill Cersei.

54
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,554
Your queen got there first.

55
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:46,061
She's everyone's queen now.

56
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:47,896
Try telling Sansa.

57
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:57,906
Wait for me outside the city gates.
I'll come find you.

58
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:59,074
Jon.

59
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:02,619
She knows who you are.

60
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,956
Who you really are.

61
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,749
You'll always be a threat to her.

62
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,254
And I know a killer when I see one.

63
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,955
Did you bring any wine?

64
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:49,249
No.

65
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:51,918
Ah...

66
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,462
Well...

67
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,591
thank you for coming to see me.

68
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:01,970
Our queen doesn't keep prisoners
for long.

69
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:06,516
I suppose there's
a crude kind of justice.

70
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:11,438
I betrayed my closest friend
and watched him burn.

71
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:15,358
Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes:

72
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,736
"See, I told you."

73
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,159
It just occurred to me.

74
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:28,371
I'm talking to the only man alive
who knows where I'm going.

75
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,167
So is there life after death?

76
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:36,963
Not that I've seen.

77
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:39,800
I should be thankful.

78
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:43,512
Oblivion is the best
I could hope for.

79
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:46,181
I strangled my lover.

80
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:50,435
I shot my own father with a crossbow.
I betrayed my queen.

81
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,020
- You didn't.
- I did.

82
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:57,150
And I'd do it again,
now that I've seen what I've seen.

83
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,612
I chose my fate.

84
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:03,406
The people of King's Landing did not.

85
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,911
I can't justify what happened.

86
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:10,705
I won't try.

87
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,670
- But the war is over now.
- Is it?

88
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:22,217
When you heard her
talking to her soldiers,

89
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,262
did she sound like someone
who's done fighting?

90
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:36,481
She liberated the people
of Slaver's Bay.

91
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:39,609
She liberated the people
of King's Landing.

92
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:41,528
And she'll go on liberating

93
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:44,614
until the people of the world
are free...

94
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:46,157
and she rules them all.

95
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:49,452
And you've been by her side,
counselling her.

96
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:50,745
Until today.

97
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:53,665
Until today.

98
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:59,296
Varys was right.

99
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,381
I was wrong.

100
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:04,259
It was vanity
to think I could guide her.

101
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,928
Our queen's nature is fire and blood.

102
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:09,097
You think our house words
are stamped on our bodies

103
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,349
when we're born
and that's who we are?

104
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,768
Ah, then I'd be fire and blood too.

105
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,273
She's not her father,
no more than you're Tywin Lannister.

106
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:23,570
My father was an evil man.
My sister was an evil woman.

107
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:27,115
Pile up all the bodies
of all the people they ever killed,

108
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:30,201
there still won't be half as many
as our beautiful queen slaughtered

109
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:31,453
in a single day.

110
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:32,662
Cersei left her no choice.

111
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:34,998
The moment the gates fell,
the battle was over.

112
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,459
She saw her friend beheaded.

113
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:39,377
She saw her dragon
shot out of the sky.

114
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,838
And she burned down a city for it.

115
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:45,050
Ah, it's easy to judge when you're
standing far from the battlefield.

116
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,718
Would you have done it?

117
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:49,638
What?

118
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:53,767
You've been up there,
on a dragon's back.

119
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,020
You've had that power.
Would you have burned the city down?

120
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:03,109
I don't know.

121
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:04,527
Yes, you do.

122
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:09,616
You won't say because
you don't want to betray her...

123
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:12,869
but you know.

124
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,463
What's it matter what I'd do?

125
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:26,424
It matters more than anything.

126
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:33,640
When she murdered
the slavers of Astapor,

127
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,310
I'm sure no one
but the slavers complained.

128
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:40,188
After all, they were evil men.

129
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:45,819
When she crucified hundreds of
Meereenese nobles, who could argue?

130
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:47,570
They were evil men.

131
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:52,283
The Dothraki khals she burned alive?

132
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:54,911
They would have done worse to her.

133
00:24:56,413 --> 00:25:00,542
Everywhere she goes, evil men die

134
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,794
and we cheer her for it.

135
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,630
And she grows more powerful

136
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:09,009
and more sure
that she is good and right.

137
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:19,185
She believes her destiny is
to build a better world for everyone.

138
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:20,687
If you believed that...

139
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,606
if you truly believed it,

140
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,610
wouldn't you kill whoever stood
between you and paradise?

141
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,769
I know you love her.

142
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:07,776
I love her too.

143
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:15,575
Not as successfully as you.

144
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:22,957
But I believed in her
with all my heart.

145
00:26:30,882 --> 00:26:34,135
Love is more powerful than reason.

146
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,807
We all know that.

147
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,308
Look at my brother.

148
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,649
"Love is the death of duty."

149
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:55,698
You just came up with that?

150
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:04,249
Maester Aemon said it
a long time ago.

151
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:14,259
Sometimes duty is the death of love.

152
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:23,893
You are the shield
that guards the realms of men.

153
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:26,229
You've always tried
to do the right thing.

154
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:27,981
No matter the cost,

155
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:31,359
you've tried to protect people.

156
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:36,656
Who is the greatest threat
to the people now?

157
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:46,875
It's a terrible thing I'm asking.

158
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:50,170
It's also the right thing.

159
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:56,050
Do you think I'm the last man
she'll execute?

160
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:02,682
Who is more dangerous than
the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?

161
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,531
That's her decision.
She is the queen.

162
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:29,292
I'm sorry it came to this.

163
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:42,430
And your sisters?

164
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:47,769
Do you see them bending the knee?

165
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:53,358
My sisters will be loyal
to the throne.

166
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:57,153
Why do you think Sansa
told me the truth about you?

167
00:28:57,237 --> 00:28:59,239
Because she doesn't want Dany
to be queen.

168
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:02,116
- She doesn't get to choose.
- No.

169
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,660
But you do.

170
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:07,080
And you have to choose now.

171
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,600
Episode 6 - The Iron Throne.

172
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:09,947
When I was a girl,
my brother told me it was made

173
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:13,493
with 1,000 swords
from Aegon's fallen enemies.

174
00:33:16,454 --> 00:33:18,247
What do 1,000 swords look like

175
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:21,209
in the mind of a little girl
who can't count to 20?

176
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:26,297
I imagined a mountain of swords
too high to climb.

177
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,965
So many fallen enemies,

178
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:30,134
you could only see
the soles of Aegon's feet.

179
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:33,346
I saw them executing
Lannister prisoners in the street.

180
00:33:34,514 --> 00:33:36,557
They said they were acting
on your orders.

181
00:33:37,642 --> 00:33:40,269
- It was necessary.
- Necessary?

182
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:42,104
Have you been down there?

183
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:43,523
Have you seen?

184
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:46,275
Children, little children, burned!

185
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:51,697
I tried to make peace with Cersei.

186
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:57,245
She used their innocence
as a weapon against me.

187
00:33:57,328 --> 00:33:59,622
- She thought it would cripple me.
- And Tyrion?

188
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,462
He conspired behind my back
with my enemies.

189
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:10,049
How have you treated people
who've done the same to you,

190
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:12,260
even when it broke your heart?

191
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:16,264
Forgive him.

192
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:20,810
- I can't.
- You can.

193
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,482
You can forgive all of them,
make them see they made a mistake.

194
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:28,359
Make them understand.

195
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:34,407
Please, Dany.

196
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:40,955
We can't hide behind small mercies.

197
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,458
The world we need

198
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:47,295
won't be built by men
loyal to the world we have.

199
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:51,215
The world we need
is a world of mercy. It has to be.

200
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:52,633
And it will be.

201
00:34:55,886 --> 00:35:00,683
It's not easy to see something
that's never been before.

202
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:04,895
A good world.

203
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,148
How do you know?

204
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:11,777
How do you know it'll be good?

205
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:13,571
Because I know what is good.

206
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:16,157
And so do you.

207
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,576
- I don't.
- You do.

208
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:20,870
You do. You've always known.

209
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:25,958
What about everyone else?

210
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,588
All the other people
who think they know what's good.

211
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:35,301
They don't get to choose.

212
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:42,433
Be with me.

213
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:46,145
Build the new world with me.

214
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:48,773
This is our reason.

215
00:35:48,856 --> 00:35:50,232
It has been from the beginning,

216
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:53,778
since you were a little boy
with a bastard's name

217
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:56,989
and I was a little girl
who couldn't count to 20.

218
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,659
We do it together.

219
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:04,538
We break the wheel together.

220
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,210
You are my queen.

221
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:13,589
Now, and always.

222
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:37,324
Where's Jon?

223
00:43:38,242 --> 00:43:39,535
He is our prisoner.

224
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:40,786
So is Lord Tyrion.

225
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:42,830
They were both to be brought
to this gathering.

226
00:43:42,913 --> 00:43:45,791
We will decide what we do
with our prisoners.

227
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:47,334
This is our city now.

228
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:49,837
If you look outside the walls
of your city,

229
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,381
you'll find thousands of Northmen
who will explain to you

230
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:56,260
why harming Jon Snow
is not in your interest.

231
00:43:56,343 --> 00:43:59,263
And you will find thousands
of Unsullied who believe that it is.

232
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:01,932
Some of you may be quick to forgive.

233
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:04,184
The Ironborn are not.

234
00:44:04,268 --> 00:44:06,145
I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.

235
00:44:06,228 --> 00:44:07,938
You swore to follow a tyrant.

236
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:09,857
She freed us from a tyrant.

237
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,358
Cersei is gone because of her,

238
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:13,902
and Jon Snow put a knife
in her heart.

239
00:44:13,986 --> 00:44:16,155
Let the Unsullied give him
what he deserves.

240
00:44:16,238 --> 00:44:19,491
Say another word about killing
my brother and I'll cut your throat.

241
00:44:19,575 --> 00:44:21,034
Friends, please.

242
00:44:23,162 --> 00:44:26,039
We've been cutting
each other's throats long enough.

243
00:44:26,123 --> 00:44:29,084
Torgo Nudho.
Am I saying that properly?

244
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,339
If it weren't for you and your men,

245
00:44:34,423 --> 00:44:36,925
we would've lost the war
with the dead.

246
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:39,386
This country owes you
a debt it can never repay,

247
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:41,138
but let us try.

248
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:44,683
There is land in the Reach.
Good land.

249
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:47,311
The people that used to live there
are gone.

250
00:44:47,394 --> 00:44:48,437
Make it your own.

251
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,190
Start your own house
with the Unsullied as your Bannerman.

252
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:53,901
We've had enough war.

253
00:44:53,984 --> 00:44:56,153
Thousands of you, thousands of them.

254
00:44:56,236 --> 00:44:58,155
You know how it ends.

255
00:44:58,238 --> 00:44:59,907
We need to find a better way.

256
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:02,451
We do not need payment.

257
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:04,036
We need justice.

258
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,080
Jon Snow cannot go free.

259
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:11,960
It's not for you to decide.

260
00:45:12,044 --> 00:45:13,503
You are not here to speak!

261
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:16,965
Everyone has heard enough words
from you.

262
00:45:19,176 --> 00:45:21,094
You're right.

263
00:45:21,178 --> 00:45:23,597
And no one's any better for it.

264
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,226
But it's not
for you to decide.

265
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:31,271
Jon committed his crime here.

266
00:45:31,355 --> 00:45:34,733
His fate is for our king to decide.

267
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:36,151
Or our queen.

268
00:45:36,235 --> 00:45:38,403
We don't have a king or queen.

269
00:45:39,696 --> 00:45:42,783
You're the most powerful people
in Westeros.

270
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:46,203
Choose one.

271
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,881
Make your choice, then.

272
00:46:20,654 --> 00:46:23,240
My lords and ladies...

273
00:46:25,826 --> 00:46:30,330
I suppose this is the most important
moment of our lives.

274
00:46:30,414 --> 00:46:34,334
What we decide today will reverberate
through the annals of history.

275
00:46:35,002 --> 00:46:39,006
I stand before you as one
of the senior lords in the country.

276
00:46:40,382 --> 00:46:42,175
A veteran of two wars.

277
00:46:43,385 --> 00:46:48,765
And I like to think my experience has
led to some small skill in statecraft

278
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:50,058
- and under...
- Uncle?

279
00:46:53,145 --> 00:46:54,187
Please sit.

280
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:28,555
Well, we have to choose someone.

281
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:31,350
Um...
Why just us?

282
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:37,022
Um...

283
00:47:38,899 --> 00:47:42,569
We represent all the great houses,
but whomever we choose,

284
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:45,989
they won't just rule over
lords and ladies.

285
00:47:46,073 --> 00:47:49,284
Maybe the decision about
what's best for everyone

286
00:47:49,368 --> 00:47:50,577
should be left to...

287
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:53,705
well, everyone.

288
00:48:08,095 --> 00:48:10,847
Maybe we should give the dogs
a vote as well.

289
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:12,349
I'll ask my horse.

290
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:24,111
I suppose you want the crown.

291
00:48:24,194 --> 00:48:25,237
Me?

292
00:48:26,196 --> 00:48:27,280
The Imp?

293
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:31,785
Half the people hate me
for serving Daenerys,

294
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:33,954
the other half hate me
for betraying her.

295
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:39,376
- Can't think of a worse choice.
- Who, then?

296
00:48:46,133 --> 00:48:50,178
I've had nothing to do but think
these past few weeks.

297
00:48:51,888 --> 00:48:53,765
About our bloody history.

298
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:57,853
About the mistakes we've made.

299
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:10,657
What unites people?

300
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:14,453
Armies?

301
00:49:16,413 --> 00:49:17,456
Gold?

302
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:21,501
Flags?

303
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:29,926
Stories.

304
00:49:32,596 --> 00:49:35,640
There's nothing in the world
more powerful than a good story.

305
00:49:38,018 --> 00:49:39,603
Nothing can stop it.

306
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:42,898
No enemy can defeat it.

307
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:46,276
And who has a better story...

308
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:49,237
than Bran the Broken?

309
00:49:53,158 --> 00:49:56,369
The boy who fell
from a high tower and lived.

310
00:49:58,038 --> 00:50:01,958
He knew he'd never walk again,
so he learned to fly.

311
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:07,130
He crossed beyond the Wall,
a crippled boy,

312
00:50:07,214 --> 00:50:09,382
and became the Three-Eyed Raven.

313
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,346
He is our memory,

314
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:16,473
the keeper of all our stories.

315
00:50:17,224 --> 00:50:21,520
The wars, weddings, births,
massacres, famines.

316
00:50:21,603 --> 00:50:23,522
Our triumphs,

317
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:26,149
our defeats,

318
00:50:26,233 --> 00:50:27,400
our past.

319
00:50:29,361 --> 00:50:32,072
Who better to lead us
into the future?

320
00:50:35,283 --> 00:50:38,787
Bran has no interest in ruling
and he can't father children.

321
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,247
Good.

322
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:42,666
Sons of kings
can be cruel and stupid,

323
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:44,167
as you well know.

324
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:47,212
His will never torment us.

325
00:50:51,466 --> 00:50:54,594
That is the wheel
our queen wanted to break.

326
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:04,938
From now on, rulers will not be born.

327
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:10,944
They will be chosen on this spot by
the lords and ladies of Westeros...

328
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:12,529
to serve the realm.

329
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:23,206
I know you don't want it.

330
00:51:24,332 --> 00:51:27,794
I know you don't care about power.

331
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:33,883
But I ask you now,
if we choose you...

332
00:51:35,552 --> 00:51:36,970
will you wear the crown?

333
00:51:38,847 --> 00:51:41,766
Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms
to the best of your abilities

334
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:44,477
from this day until your last day?

335
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:53,069
Why do you think I came all this way?

336
00:51:59,826 --> 00:52:01,953
To Brandon of House Stark...

337
00:52:03,371 --> 00:52:04,581
I say aye.

338
00:52:16,259 --> 00:52:17,302
Aye.

339
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:24,976
Aye.

340
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:27,270
Aye.

341
00:52:30,357 --> 00:52:31,399
Aye.

342
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:35,278
Aye.

343
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:41,076
Aye.

344
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,203
Aye.

345
00:52:43,328 --> 00:52:44,663
Aye.

346
00:52:44,746 --> 00:52:46,665
- Aye.
- Aye.

347
00:52:46,748 --> 00:52:47,791
Aye.

348
00:52:49,793 --> 00:52:52,295
I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye.

349
00:52:54,381 --> 00:52:55,423
Aye.

350
00:53:06,726 --> 00:53:08,895
I love you, little brother.
I always will.

351
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:10,647
You'll be a good king.

352
00:53:12,065 --> 00:53:15,235
But tens of thousands of Northmen
fell in the Great War

353
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:17,320
defending all of Westeros.

354
00:53:17,404 --> 00:53:19,280
And those who survived
have seen too much

355
00:53:19,364 --> 00:53:22,200
and fought too hard
ever to kneel again.

356
00:53:25,078 --> 00:53:27,664
The North will remain
an independent kingdom,

357
00:53:28,707 --> 00:53:30,542
as it was for thousands of years.

358
00:53:55,692 --> 00:53:58,445
All hail Bran the Broken,

359
00:53:58,528 --> 00:54:02,198
First of His Name, King of the Andals
and the First Men,

360
00:54:03,366 --> 00:54:07,829
Lord of the Six Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

361
00:54:10,707 --> 00:54:13,668
All hail Bran the Broken!

362
00:54:25,513 --> 00:54:26,639
Lord Tyrion...

363
00:54:28,892 --> 00:54:30,351
you will be my Hand.

364
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:35,607
No, Your Grace, I don't want it.

365
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:37,609
And I don't want to be king.

366
00:54:39,819 --> 00:54:41,279
I don't deserve it.

367
00:54:42,405 --> 00:54:45,074
I thought I was wise, but I wasn't.

368
00:54:45,158 --> 00:54:49,245
I thought I knew what was right,
but I didn't.

369
00:54:51,498 --> 00:54:53,082
Choose Ser Davos.

370
00:54:53,166 --> 00:54:54,584
Choose anyone else.

371
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:56,878
- I choose you.
- You cannot.

372
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:58,797
Yes, I can.

373
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,299
- I'm king.
- This man is a criminal.

374
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:04,719
- He deserves justice.
- He just got it.

375
00:55:04,803 --> 00:55:07,263
He's made many terrible mistakes.

376
00:55:07,347 --> 00:55:10,266
He's going to spend
the rest of his life fixing them.

377
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:16,815
It is not enough.

378
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:27,867
Giving you to the Unsullied
would start a war.

379
00:55:29,452 --> 00:55:31,538
Letting you walk free
would start a war.

380
00:55:32,705 --> 00:55:35,959
So our new king has chosen
to send you to the Night's Watch.

381
00:55:38,086 --> 00:55:39,629
There's still a Night's Watch?

382
00:55:42,173 --> 00:55:44,926
The world will always need a home
for bastards and broken men.

383
00:55:49,973 --> 00:55:52,100
You shall take no wife,

384
00:55:52,183 --> 00:55:54,310
hold no lands,

385
00:55:54,394 --> 00:55:55,937
father no children.

386
00:55:59,232 --> 00:56:02,068
The Unsullied wanted your head
of course,

387
00:56:02,151 --> 00:56:05,321
but Grey Worm has accepted
the justice of a life sentence.

388
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:09,450
Sansa and Arya wanted you freed,

389
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:14,247
but they understand our new king
needs to make peace.

390
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:15,874
No one is very happy.

391
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:19,669
Which means it's a good compromise,
I suppose.

392
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:22,922
Was it right?

393
00:56:26,509 --> 00:56:27,552
What I did?

394
00:56:30,847 --> 00:56:32,056
What we did.

395
00:56:36,311 --> 00:56:37,812
It doesn't feel right.

396
00:56:45,028 --> 00:56:46,946
Ask me again in 10 years.

397
00:57:10,011 --> 00:57:12,639
I don't expect
we'll ever see each other again.

398
00:57:17,393 --> 00:57:18,811
I wouldn't be so sure.

399
00:57:20,063 --> 00:57:21,481
A few years as Hand of the King

400
00:57:21,564 --> 00:57:24,400
would make anyone want to
piss off the edge of the world.

401
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:06,419
All the men have boarded.

402
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:08,004
Good.

403
00:59:09,297 --> 00:59:12,550
We sail for the Isle of Naath.

404
00:59:43,623 --> 00:59:45,583
<i>I wish
there'd been another way.</i>

405
00:59:47,627 --> 00:59:49,128
Can you forgive me?

406
01:00:01,432 --> 01:00:03,851
The North is free, thanks to you.

407
01:00:05,895 --> 01:00:07,772
But they lost their king.

408
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:11,609
Ned Stark's daughter
will speak for them.

409
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:15,988
She's the best they could ask for.

410
01:00:36,926 --> 01:00:39,637
You can come see me, you know,
at Castle Black.

411
01:00:40,763 --> 01:00:42,598
I can't.

412
01:00:42,682 --> 01:00:46,060
You think anyone will dare tell you
women aren't allowed?

413
01:00:51,816 --> 01:00:53,234
I'm not going back north.

414
01:00:55,278 --> 01:00:56,404
Where are you going?

415
01:00:58,865 --> 01:01:00,658
What's west of Westeros?

416
01:01:02,618 --> 01:01:04,954
I don't know.

417
01:01:05,037 --> 01:01:06,330
No one knows.

418
01:01:07,623 --> 01:01:09,792
It's where all the maps stop.

419
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:13,588
That's where I'm going.

420
01:01:22,597 --> 01:01:23,639
You have your Needle?

421
01:01:24,974 --> 01:01:26,017
Right here.

422
01:01:48,122 --> 01:01:49,332
Your Grace.

423
01:01:58,841 --> 01:02:01,135
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you needed me.

424
01:02:03,596 --> 01:02:05,932
You were exactly where
you were supposed to be.

425
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:21,645
That's not... Uh...

426
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:28,277
What's this?

427
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,154
<i>A Song of Ice and Fire.</i>

428
01:06:31,322 --> 01:06:32,948
Archmaester Ebrose's history
of the wars

429
01:06:33,032 --> 01:06:35,326
following the death of King Robert.

430
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:37,578
I helped him with the title.

431
01:06:40,456 --> 01:06:43,000
I suppose I come in
for some heavy criticism.

432
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:45,544
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

433
01:06:45,628 --> 01:06:48,255
Oh, he's kind to me.
Never would've guessed.

434
01:06:52,426 --> 01:06:53,969
He's not kind?

435
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:56,388
- He...
- He what?

436
01:06:57,515 --> 01:06:58,933
What does he say about me?

437
01:07:05,105 --> 01:07:08,442
I don't believe you're mentioned.

438
01:07:30,297 --> 01:07:31,340
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

439
01:07:31,423 --> 01:07:32,633
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

440
01:07:51,527 --> 01:07:54,446
We appear to be missing
a Master of Whisperers.

441
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:55,656
And a Master of Laws.

442
01:07:56,949 --> 01:07:58,784
- And a Master of War.
- Yes, Your Grace.

443
01:07:58,867 --> 01:08:00,536
Suitable prospects
will be brought to you

444
01:08:00,619 --> 01:08:02,621
for an audience in the coming weeks.

445
01:08:03,956 --> 01:08:06,584
And Drogon? Any word?

446
01:08:06,667 --> 01:08:08,544
He was last spotted flying east,
toward...

447
01:08:08,627 --> 01:08:09,837
The farther away, the better.

448
01:08:12,047 --> 01:08:13,340
Perhaps I can find him.

449
01:08:14,508 --> 01:08:15,926
Do carry on with the rest.

450
01:08:17,177 --> 01:08:18,971
As you wish, Your Grace.

451
01:08:21,348 --> 01:08:22,641
Ser Podrick.

452
01:08:31,442 --> 01:08:34,111
We serve at your pleasure,
King Bran the Broken,

453
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:36,864
ruler of the Six Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

454
01:08:37,865 --> 01:08:39,867
- Long may he reign.
- Long may he reign.

455
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:41,827
- Long may he reign.
- Long may he reign.

456
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:43,287
Long may he reign.

457
01:08:44,788 --> 01:08:45,998
That will improve.

458
01:08:47,124 --> 01:08:48,459
I'm sure it will.

459
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:58,177
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,

460
01:08:58,260 --> 01:08:59,428
Lord of Highgarden,

461
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:02,681
Lord Paramount of the Reach
and Master of Coin,

462
01:09:03,724 --> 01:09:06,226
would you say the crown's debt to you
has been paid?

463
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:08,062
In full, my lord Hand.

464
01:09:08,145 --> 01:09:09,355
Good.

465
01:09:09,438 --> 01:09:11,690
Time to start incurring a new one.

466
01:09:11,774 --> 01:09:13,067
We have hungry people to feed.

467
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,943
Can we expect some assistance
in this regard?

468
01:09:15,027 --> 01:09:16,695
Indeed we can.

469
01:09:16,779 --> 01:09:20,324
Lord Davos, we have an armada
to rebuild and ports to repair.

470
01:09:20,407 --> 01:09:22,576
We have.
These projects will begin as soon as

471
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:26,538
the Master of Coin and Lord
of Lofty Titles provides funding.

472
01:09:26,622 --> 01:09:29,208
The Master of Coin looks forward
to helping the Master of Ships,

473
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:32,002
but first he has to ensure
we're not wasting coin,

474
01:09:32,086 --> 01:09:33,796
or soon there won't be no more coin.

475
01:09:33,879 --> 01:09:35,089
"Any more."

476
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:36,632
You Master of Grammar now too?

477
01:09:36,715 --> 01:09:38,133
Grandmaester...

478
01:09:38,676 --> 01:09:42,262
it is my theory, based on my years
of work on the Casterly Rock sewers,

479
01:09:42,346 --> 01:09:44,348
that clean water
leads to a healthier population.

480
01:09:44,431 --> 01:09:46,975
The Archmaester has done
some research on this subject

481
01:09:47,059 --> 01:09:49,478
- and it turns out...
- The strong live and the weak don't.

482
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:52,731
Find the best builders
and set them to the task.

483
01:09:52,815 --> 01:09:56,235
Oh, speaking of builders,
all the best brothels burned down.

484
01:09:56,318 --> 01:09:59,113
The Master of Coin
is willing to fund reconstruction.

485
01:09:59,196 --> 01:10:02,074
Uh, the Archmaester
is less than enthusiastic

486
01:10:02,157 --> 01:10:04,493
about the salutary effects
of brothels.

487
01:10:04,576 --> 01:10:06,787
Well, I imagine
