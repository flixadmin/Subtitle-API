1
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,380
<i>It's a joyous day for me,</i>

2
00:03:11,577 --> 00:03:14,622
<i>because my autobiography,</i>

3
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,542
<i>is being released.</i>

4
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:20,541
I'm a very misunderstood man.

5
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:24,624
If you want to know the real Sanjay Dutt,

6
00:03:24,944 --> 00:03:26,186
read my autobiography.

7
00:03:26,864 --> 00:03:30,144
It's my story,
but written by my buddy, D. N. Tripathi.

8
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:32,869
And he wishes that I read you a chapter.

9
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:38,347
"Chapter one...

10
00:03:38,507 --> 00:03:39,949
Bapu and Sanju.

11
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:43,111
Bapu is Mahatma Gandhi.

12
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,430
And, Sanju... Yours truly, Sanjay Dutt.

13
00:03:45,511 --> 00:03:49,391
Our lives have followed
quite a similar graph."

14
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,230
-Hey, Tripathi...
-Yes.

15
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:57,275
Killer opening! Moved me to tears.

16
00:03:57,435 --> 00:04:00,234
Your wish is my command.
I've put my soul into it.

17
00:04:00,314 --> 00:04:02,754
Mohammed... Sudama... come here.

18
00:04:03,432 --> 00:04:05,836
Tripathi has written a rump-ripping book.

19
00:04:06,276 --> 00:04:08,797
Read us a chapter. Nanny, take a seat.

20
00:04:10,995 --> 00:04:13,116
The book is titled "Sage Sanju".

21
00:04:13,196 --> 00:04:14,639
"Chapter one...

22
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,920
Bapu and Sanju.

23
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,558
Bapu is Mahatma Gandhi.

24
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,838
And, Sanju... Yours truly, Sanjay Dutt.

25
00:04:22,683 --> 00:04:25,441
Our lives have followed
quite a similar graph.

26
00:04:25,562 --> 00:04:28,962
For instance, we've both spent
a lot of time in prison.

27
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:31,484
He's a national hero.

28
00:04:32,124 --> 00:04:34,124
I'm a Bollywood hero.

29
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:36,043
He was against violence.

30
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:39,888
He walked with a stick
but never used it as a weapon

31
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:44,366
I had an AK-56 rifle
and never used it either.

32
00:04:45,046 --> 00:04:46,684
He dreamed of a free India.

33
00:04:47,046 --> 00:04:50,410
I dream of... my freedom."

34
00:04:50,888 --> 00:04:53,086
Maanyata, it's a slow starter.

35
00:04:53,568 --> 00:04:56,486
Don't worry, the story picks up later.

36
00:05:02,931 --> 00:05:04,008
Hold this...

37
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,494
pick up the bell... ring it.

38
00:05:07,136 --> 00:05:09,494
Go around and worship me.

39
00:05:09,573 --> 00:05:13,571
You've elevated me to Mahatma Gandhi
in the first chapter.

40
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,615
By the end, you'll turn me into god!

41
00:05:15,737 --> 00:05:18,708
Find a temple for sale.

42
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,735
He'll put me on the altar.

43
00:05:20,814 --> 00:05:22,134
Sorry, Tripathi.

44
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:25,336
Buddy, tell me...

45
00:05:26,298 --> 00:05:29,057
are shoes allowed inside a temple?

46
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:31,504
Not at all, Sanju.

47
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,219
Then how dare you wear shoes
in front of God?

48
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,062
Sanju, I'd told you, I'm no biographer.

49
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:42,781
I'm a songwriter...

50
00:05:44,022 --> 00:05:45,541
Sanju... please!

51
00:05:52,545 --> 00:05:55,063
What about me reminds you of Gandhi?

52
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:56,823
I'll write another draft.

53
00:05:57,907 --> 00:06:00,427
<i>Shithead, you jacked my book!</i>

54
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:04,144
<i>Our correspondent is outside</i>
<i>the Supreme Court.</i>

55
00:06:04,588 --> 00:06:08,151
<i>In moments, we'll know</i>
<i>whether the actor, Sanjay Dutt,</i>

56
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,363
<i>will go to prison or be free.</i>

57
00:06:10,588 --> 00:06:14,990
<i>In 2006, the Anti-Terrorism Court</i>
<i>had sentenced Sanjay Dutt</i>

58
00:06:15,071 --> 00:06:18,111
<i>to six years imprisonment</i>
<i>in the Mumbai bomb blast case.</i>

59
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,832
<i>He'd appealed to the Supreme Court</i>
<i>against the judgment.</i>

60
00:06:22,032 --> 00:06:26,235
<i>The judgment was expected next week.</i>

61
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:28,632
<i>But we've just received information</i>

62
00:06:28,711 --> 00:06:31,553
<i>the Supreme Court</i>
<i>will give its verdict today.</i>

63
00:06:32,034 --> 00:06:35,396
<i>Stay tuned, as we report live</i>
<i>from the Supreme Court.</i>

64
00:06:35,798 --> 00:06:37,996
<i>Dinesh, give us an update.</i>

65
00:06:38,075 --> 00:06:41,758
<i>The verdict is out.</i>
<i>Sanjay Dutt will go to prison.</i>

66
00:06:41,838 --> 00:06:44,481
<i>The Court has sentenced him to five years,</i>

67
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:47,236
<i>for possession of an AK-56 rifle.</i>

68
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:50,160
<i>When does he go to prison?</i>

69
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,083
<i>The Court has given him</i>
<i>a month to surrender</i>

70
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:57,240
<i>so he can complete his films.</i>

71
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,201
<i>His father, late Sunil Dutt,</i>
<i>popular actor and politician...</i>

72
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:04,601
<i>his mother, late Nargis,</i>
<i>iconic actor of the '60s...</i>

73
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:08,127
<i>the scion of this eminent family,</i>
<i>Sanjay, will go to prison.</i>

74
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:10,886
<i>Let's hear what people have to say.</i>

75
00:07:11,403 --> 00:07:14,809
<i>Five years is nothing.</i>
<i>He should be hanged!</i>

76
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:17,208
<i>Traitor... a bloody terrorist!</i>

77
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:19,413
<i>Celebrities have it easy.</i>

78
00:07:19,765 --> 00:07:21,885
<i>Such terrorists should be shot dead!</i>

79
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:36,654
Come inside.

80
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:51,179
<i>When the kids start school,</i>

81
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:54,055
<i>they are sure to be asked...</i>

82
00:07:54,695 --> 00:07:58,978
<i>"Where's your terrorist-dad? In prison?"</i>

83
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,696
<i>It'll be easier for them to say,</i>
<i>"No, he's dead."</i>

84
00:08:18,384 --> 00:08:19,672
<i>Sanju!</i>

85
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:22,903
Suicide may solve your problem,

86
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:24,186
not your kids'.

87
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:28,665
They'll still be called terrorist's kids.

88
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,988
We decided to fight, didn't we?

89
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,748
-That we'll get the truth out there.
-Didn't we try?

90
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,991
What did we get? Bapu and Sanju!

91
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,909
That's what you get with knuckleheads.

92
00:08:46,988 --> 00:08:48,068
Write it yourself.

93
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:50,952
Struggled with a four-line suicide note.

94
00:08:51,034 --> 00:08:52,832
Imagine a 400-page book!

95
00:08:52,953 --> 00:08:54,246
We'll find a good writer.

96
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,590
Why will they be interested?

97
00:08:56,671 --> 00:08:59,595
It's said,
"Bad choices make good stories."

98
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:03,432
And you're the king of bad choices.

99
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:06,634
Some writer out there
will understand this.

100
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:22,038
Sanju, be respectful.

101
00:09:22,117 --> 00:09:24,164
<i>She's no Tripathi. She's Winnie Diaz.</i>

102
00:09:24,602 --> 00:09:26,044
<i>World's top biographer.</i>

103
00:09:26,882 --> 00:09:28,127
<i>She's down from London.</i>

104
00:09:28,212 --> 00:09:31,040
Control slang like...
rump-ripper, jacked...

105
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:32,686
Got it.

106
00:09:46,325 --> 00:09:47,166
Winnie

107
00:09:47,846 --> 00:09:49,811
I won't take much of your time.

108
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:53,089
-I wanted--
-I can't write your biography. I'm sorry.

109
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,616
Why not?

110
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:01,211
...I asked around and...

111
00:10:02,171 --> 00:10:04,810
And they said I'm a terrorist.

112
00:10:10,414 --> 00:10:13,012
Who are these people? Do they know me?

113
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:16,536
Do they hang out with me?

114
00:10:16,976 --> 00:10:18,896
Then how can they be so sure?

115
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:23,454
Their opinion is based
merely on TV and print news.

116
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:26,619
And these TV anchors, newspaper reporters,

117
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:28,630
who dish out opinions every day,

118
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:30,656
haven't met me either!

119
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:34,422
The media has maligned me.

120
00:10:35,023 --> 00:10:38,538
So, I need a good writer
to present my side of the story.

121
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:44,064
You think millions
will read your biography?

122
00:10:44,502 --> 00:10:46,311
It doesn't work like that.

123
00:10:46,465 --> 00:10:50,864
Thousands of books
rot away in book stores.

124
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:53,465
Once in a blue moon a book comes that--

125
00:10:53,546 --> 00:10:55,901
That's a rump-ripper!

126
00:10:56,063 --> 00:10:58,911
My story's that!

127
00:10:59,111 --> 00:11:00,749
What's there in your life story?

128
00:11:04,346 --> 00:11:08,149
Give me just one hour.
Guns, drugs, alcohol...

129
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:10,829
Pick any chapter, I'll tell you the story.

130
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:13,268
I guarantee, you'll be jacked...

131
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:18,751
I mean... jack... it'll be a J K Rowling.

132
00:11:20,117 --> 00:11:22,070
I have a month to surrender.

133
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,394
This time I may not survive.

134
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:28,355
One hour, please.

135
00:11:34,597 --> 00:11:37,199
5 p.m. tomorrow. Right here.

136
00:11:38,714 --> 00:11:42,320
At 6 p.m., I'll tell you
if I'm jacked or not.

137
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:59,882
From Amitabh Bachchan to Sachin Tendulkar

138
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:01,803
you've upset everyone.

139
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:07,968
So many heroes, but you'll pen
a terrorist's biography!

140
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:11,974
This is fake news.

141
00:12:13,322 --> 00:12:17,449
He too is a fake.
This is a pressure tactic.

142
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,127
-Who are you?
-Zubin Mistry.

143
00:12:20,617 --> 00:12:22,125
I construct malls.

144
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:25,371
I suggest you don't write this book.

145
00:12:28,052 --> 00:12:30,688
<i>And you came all the way to suggest it?</i>

146
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:35,136
I'm here daily to jog. Saw you here, so...

147
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:38,338
Jog in a suit? Is work-wear shorts?

148
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:43,737
He hit me.

149
00:12:43,817 --> 00:12:46,338
He's on cocaine, LSD, heroin...

150
00:12:47,732 --> 00:12:51,859
A womanizer, too. Ask him his score.

151
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,897
Any number less than 200, he's lying.

152
00:12:54,981 --> 00:12:58,736
Want to know his truth? Call me.

153
00:13:09,903 --> 00:13:11,423
Sanju.

154
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:18,786
For once, I feel like thanking the press.

155
00:13:18,906 --> 00:13:21,545
One headline, and you're here.

156
00:13:22,184 --> 00:13:25,310
-Why did you get this printed?
-I didn't, Winnie.

157
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,825
Reporters live outside my gate.
They follow me everywhere.

158
00:13:28,905 --> 00:13:30,423
If you were a doctor,

159
00:13:30,504 --> 00:13:33,425
they'd print, "Sanju ill",
an actress... "Sanju's new lady."

160
00:13:33,505 --> 00:13:36,230
They want spicy headlines. Not the truth.

161
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:38,790
-That's why we've come to you.
-Will he tell me the truth?

162
00:13:39,227 --> 00:13:41,868
Nothing but the truth. Fire away.

163
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:47,708
Excluding your wife,
how many women have you slept with?

164
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,269
Look here.

165
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:59,073
Should I count the prostitutes or...

166
00:13:59,193 --> 00:14:01,036
No, let's keep them aside.

167
00:14:01,678 --> 00:14:04,753
Never kept a score-card.

168
00:14:05,353 --> 00:14:10,440
But once, I did the math,
I recalled around 308.

169
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:14,878
I must've missed a few.
On the safe side, let's say... 350.

170
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:23,559
Do you know him?

171
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:28,203
Zubin! He was my friend.

172
00:14:28,924 --> 00:14:30,680
I nicknamed him "God".

173
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:33,762
Since you picked him,
let's start with chapter "God".

174
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:43,809
1981... my debut film.
He was always on the sets.

175
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:47,378
Dad was directing me
and I was nervous as hell.

176
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:50,764
<i>Is this love?</i>

177
00:14:52,248 --> 00:14:54,652
<i>Yes, my dove!</i>

178
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,768
Cut...

179
00:14:56,888 --> 00:15:00,177
Sonny, your lips are off sync.

180
00:15:00,255 --> 00:15:03,294
Match them to the song.

181
00:15:04,298 --> 00:15:09,454
And... a romantic reaction
when the girl sings.

182
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:11,494
But, Dad, where's the girl?

183
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,812
How do I react to a cold camera?

184
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:17,340
An actor's job is to imagine.

185
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,695
Imagine a beautiful actress
in front of you.

186
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:25,215
Ganpat, come here. Observe.

187
00:15:32,177 --> 00:15:35,381
<i>Is this love?</i>

188
00:15:36,861 --> 00:15:39,151
<i>Yes, my dove!</i>

189
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:46,265
<i>In your absence</i>
<i>Day and night eclipse</i>

190
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:49,982
<i>And an hour is forever</i>

191
00:15:50,301 --> 00:15:53,386
<i>Is this love?</i>

192
00:15:54,825 --> 00:15:57,104
<i>Yes, my dove!</i>

193
00:15:58,626 --> 00:15:59,784
Cut.

194
00:16:01,349 --> 00:16:03,947
Come. Give it a go.

195
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:06,427
Let's give him a heroine.

196
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,073
Ganpat, come here.

197
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:12,831
Hold this and stand here.

198
00:16:13,157 --> 00:16:15,028
-Don't move.
-Good idea.

199
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:21,513
<i>Is this love?</i>

200
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,231
<i>Yes, my dove!</i>

201
00:16:27,397 --> 00:16:32,073
<i>In your absence</i>
<i>Day and night eclipse</i>

202
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:35,598
<i>And an hour is forever</i>

203
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:38,757
<i>Is this love?</i>

204
00:16:38,838 --> 00:16:40,195
<i>Yes!</i>

205
00:16:41,036 --> 00:16:43,116
<i>Yes, my dove!</i>

206
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,721
Cut it!

207
00:16:45,241 --> 00:16:48,838
Well played, Ramu. Ace!

208
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,557
Sonny...

209
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:57,359
-You've been smoking?
-No, Dad.

210
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:01,725
Now you lie, too?

211
00:17:03,124 --> 00:17:07,762
Thousands struggle to be an actor...
with no luck.

212
00:17:07,841 --> 00:17:12,567
You've got it on a silver platter,
respect that.

213
00:17:13,207 --> 00:17:16,684
Drinking, smoking...
will show on your face.

214
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:18,849
The camera spares no one.

215
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:24,007
Quit smoking or I'll shelve the film.

216
00:17:38,335 --> 00:17:43,738
Smoke with your left hand.
Fathers sniff the right hand.

217
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,859
Bro, I'm the first actor in the world
to romance a bandit.

218
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,977
But, dad praised the cameraman.

219
00:18:00,056 --> 00:18:01,942
"Well played, Ramu! Ace!"

220
00:18:02,102 --> 00:18:05,152
However well I do, he never praises me.

221
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:08,261
He insults me publicly.

222
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:13,389
-Reason with him.
-That would be suicide.

223
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,903
You're too scared of your dad.

224
00:18:17,141 --> 00:18:19,146
Hey, try this.

225
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:22,233
It bumps up confidence.

226
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:26,507
Gladiators would take this before a fight.

227
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,467
Watch.

228
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:38,793
Put this in your nose... and snort it all.

229
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:42,908
I make my Pomeranian snort it
and he thinks he's an Alsatian.

230
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:44,831
Try it.

231
00:18:47,275 --> 00:18:49,791
Hey! I've been taking it for years.

232
00:18:50,392 --> 00:18:53,197
I'm stronger than you. Try me.

233
00:19:09,842 --> 00:19:11,239
<i>O light of my soul!</i>

234
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:17,916
<i>If you're heaven's king, I'm your queen</i>

235
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:23,845
<i>If you're the needle, I'm the thread</i>

236
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:30,285
<i>Then why our union</i>

237
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:35,082
<i>So half-baked, half-baked?</i>

238
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:39,855
Dad thinks that I can't lip sync to songs.

239
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:01,655
<i>I'm a fine catch, so are you</i>

240
00:20:01,855 --> 00:20:04,456
<i>Marry me, my love</i>

241
00:20:04,815 --> 00:20:09,531
<i>Let sparks fly</i>
<i>So fine, so bright</i>

242
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:24,220
<i>I'm a fine catch, so are you</i>

243
00:20:24,414 --> 00:20:27,018
<i>But, I'm a free bird</i>

244
00:20:27,382 --> 00:20:32,151
<i>Keep your fireworks</i>
<i>Too fine, too bright</i>

245
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,819
<i>Take my hand</i>
<i>Marry me quick</i>

246
00:20:34,937 --> 00:20:37,783
<i>Make me yours in a click</i>

247
00:20:37,982 --> 00:20:40,354
<i>Listen up, I'm a wild stallion</i>

248
00:20:40,476 --> 00:20:43,540
<i>Why reduce me to a mere medallion?</i>

249
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:48,067
<i>I'm a fine catch, so are you</i>

250
00:20:48,266 --> 00:20:50,863
<i>Marry me, my love</i>

251
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:54,869
<i>Let sparks fly</i>
<i>So fine, so bright</i>

252
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,429
<i>No way, love!</i>

253
00:20:56,509 --> 00:20:59,184
<i>I'm a fine catch, so are you</i>

254
00:20:59,264 --> 00:21:01,829
<i>But, I'm a free bird</i>

255
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:07,227
<i>Keep your fireworks</i>
<i>Too fine, too bright</i>

256
00:21:11,152 --> 00:21:14,719
<i>That night, one more Pomeranian</i>
<i>turned into an Alsatian.</i>

257
00:21:14,802 --> 00:21:16,831
<i>God's powder was magic.</i>

258
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:19,316
<i>My confidence was sky-rocketing.</i>

259
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:24,235
-Where's the bottle?
-Your dad chucked it.

260
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:29,475
Damn! For how long will he control me?

261
00:21:30,358 --> 00:21:33,234
My father controlled me for 60 years.

262
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,754
-How did he let go?
-He popped it.

263
00:21:38,718 --> 00:21:40,929
Dudes, don't leave. The vodka's coming.

264
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,117
The bar's closed, Sanju.

265
00:21:43,196 --> 00:21:46,800
Dad thinks cutting supply
will make us quit?

266
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,882
I have a back-up daddy

267
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,078
who'll fill up our mugs.

268
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:53,765
-Back-up dad?
-My girlfriend's pop.

269
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,525
Is daddy home?

270
00:22:09,044 --> 00:22:11,410
Yes, don't sneak in through the balcony.

271
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,211
I'll ring the doorbell. Wake him.

272
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:17,447
At this hour?

273
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:20,091
What's so important?

274
00:22:21,369 --> 00:22:23,090
I want something, baby.

275
00:22:27,851 --> 00:22:30,533
I'll be there in five. Open the door.

276
00:22:39,214 --> 00:22:40,535
Wake up your dad.

277
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:50,106
Dad, mom... wake up. Sanju's here.

278
00:22:50,184 --> 00:22:52,295
At 1 a.m.? Is everything okay?

279
00:22:52,376 --> 00:22:54,460
Took him six months to muster courage.

280
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,100
He'd said, once his career kick started,

281
00:22:57,221 --> 00:22:59,616
he'll ask for my hand.

282
00:22:59,698 --> 00:23:02,462
Just the hand, or all of you?

283
00:23:06,023 --> 00:23:07,899
We'll ask for the 18-year-old scotch.

284
00:23:08,097 --> 00:23:09,459
Will the old fart agree?

285
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:12,381
If he doesn't agree, we grab and flee!

286
00:23:14,505 --> 00:23:16,503
Hello, child. How are you?

287
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,546
Before you ask for anything,
I have something for you.

288
00:23:25,382 --> 00:23:26,184
Ten rupees?

289
00:23:26,744 --> 00:23:29,467
My father's gift to me
when I joined the Navy.

290
00:23:29,548 --> 00:23:32,842
He said, "There are two kinds of bills."

291
00:23:33,158 --> 00:23:35,508
"Real and fake."

292
00:23:35,746 --> 00:23:38,431
When you tug at a real bill...

293
00:23:40,592 --> 00:23:41,680
it won't tear.

294
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:44,867
You're starting your career.

295
00:23:44,947 --> 00:23:48,032
Life will pull you left and right.

296
00:23:48,113 --> 00:23:53,270
But if you stay honest,
nothing can rip you apart.

297
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:57,834
My father's wisdom is now yours.

298
00:23:58,362 --> 00:23:59,831
Homi, let him sit.

299
00:23:59,911 --> 00:24:01,514
Sit.

300
00:24:02,432 --> 00:24:03,918
Now tell us.

301
00:24:04,155 --> 00:24:05,959
What brings you here?

302
00:24:08,118 --> 00:24:12,798
The real reason we're here is...
we have the midnight urge.

303
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,603
Can't control it anymore.

304
00:24:21,922 --> 00:24:25,164
Look, we're weak with idioms.

305
00:24:25,838 --> 00:24:28,645
Tell us clearly, what's a "midnight urge"?

306
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:30,483
Midnight urge means...

307
00:24:37,006 --> 00:24:39,327
I'm 21 now. It's a biological need.

308
00:24:39,487 --> 00:24:43,044
As soon as midnight strikes...
the urge surges.

309
00:24:43,485 --> 00:24:47,287
I need it now... or I'm gonna explode!

310
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,419
But dad doesn't allow it.

311
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:53,567
He's orthodox. So I sin in secret.

312
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:57,652
Once, I was enjoying an 18-year-old
on the terrace... dad walked in.

313
00:24:57,733 --> 00:25:01,329
I told him frankly, "Dad, I'm an adult.

314
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,492
My friends do it every night.
Their parents never object."

315
00:25:04,734 --> 00:25:08,850
He said, "Alright, have your 18-year-old.
But don't hide.

316
00:25:08,931 --> 00:25:11,575
Do it openly on the dining table,
before the family.

317
00:25:11,654 --> 00:25:13,976
And that too, only once a month."

318
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:16,702
Daddy, how will once a month
quench this thirst?

319
00:25:17,213 --> 00:25:19,055
Now I frequent the illicit joints.

320
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:21,615
16, 18, 21...
I grab whatever is available.

321
00:25:22,097 --> 00:25:27,016
I park on a lonely stretch,
and indulge in the backseat.

322
00:25:27,096 --> 00:25:28,699
Only fear is the cops.

323
00:25:29,183 --> 00:25:31,420
They peek when you're about to peak.

324
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,986
Ma'am, try the backseat.

325
00:25:36,699 --> 00:25:39,104
You were a Navy Captain.

326
00:25:39,183 --> 00:25:42,312
You must've tasted the best
on every shore.

327
00:25:43,862 --> 00:25:48,384
Be kind, let us taste some from your home.

328
00:25:50,677 --> 00:25:52,824
-May we get one each?
-What!

329
00:25:53,223 --> 00:25:54,466
Okay, we'll share one.

330
00:25:56,587 --> 00:25:59,238
When daddy gets the urge,
you happily serve.

331
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:03,108
All we get is a "How dare you!"
Sorry, I've promised my friend.

332
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:06,150
I'm gonna grab one.

333
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,398
Stop!

334
00:26:11,186 --> 00:26:12,154
Soda or water?

335
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:19,391
And return my papa's box.

336
00:26:23,156 --> 00:26:24,515
Can I say something?

337
00:26:25,563 --> 00:26:28,033
Your papa was wrong.

338
00:26:28,111 --> 00:26:32,994
Life doesn't just pull you left and right.

339
00:26:33,607 --> 00:26:36,476
It also pulls you up and down.

340
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:50,279
<i>I drank all night with my friends.</i>

341
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,319
<i>And returned home in the morning.</i>

342
00:27:02,681 --> 00:27:04,447
I'm going for a jog.

343
00:27:12,287 --> 00:27:13,128
Sit.

344
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:20,404
Sorry, sonny. I yelled at you publicly.

345
00:27:21,012 --> 00:27:25,423
I'm stressed, so couldn't control myself.

346
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:28,088
A request...

347
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:31,773
Please focus on your work.

348
00:27:31,853 --> 00:27:35,370
Your mother should feel proud
when she sees your first film.

349
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,976
She may not be able to see your next.

350
00:27:41,097 --> 00:27:41,895
Why?

351
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:48,497
She has cancer of the pancreas.

352
00:27:49,176 --> 00:27:52,775
I'm taking her to New York.
Sloan Hospital.

353
00:27:52,854 --> 00:27:55,500
Why didn't anyone tell me?

354
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:58,899
She hid it from you
so your work won't suffer.

355
00:27:59,301 --> 00:28:01,898
She's been in pain all year.

356
00:28:02,337 --> 00:28:04,742
But acts fit in front of you.

357
00:28:04,823 --> 00:28:06,421
Where are you?

358
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:09,223
In the dining. Want some tea?

359
00:28:09,302 --> 00:28:10,499
Half a cup.

360
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,979
Hide it.

361
00:28:14,103 --> 00:28:15,465
Don't cry in her presence.

362
00:28:15,546 --> 00:28:18,421
She's acting. So must you.

363
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:22,265
Up so early?

364
00:28:23,587 --> 00:28:25,874
Did you tell Sanju we're off to New York?

365
00:28:26,942 --> 00:28:30,110
What? Haven't shared the news?

366
00:28:31,388 --> 00:28:34,915
Take a deep breath.
You're gonna be shocked.

367
00:28:36,186 --> 00:28:39,112
I've been offered a Hollywood film.

368
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:42,188
Now I'll mouth English dialogues.

369
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,268
James Bond.

370
00:28:58,317 --> 00:29:01,233
I wish they had songs like our films.

371
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:05,476
<i>This heart has lost its mate</i>

372
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:09,875
<i>No one knows where my liver went</i>

373
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:13,521
A song here, a dance there,

374
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,480
and the Oscar's mine!

375
00:29:16,161 --> 00:29:18,162
You shouldn't have retired!

376
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:21,160
Retired? I still act, don't I?

377
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:44,286
<i>Dad took mom to New York.</i>

378
00:29:44,363 --> 00:29:46,725
<i>And I started spending more time with God.</i>

379
00:29:48,808 --> 00:29:52,807
I was 18 when I lost my parents
in a car crash.

380
00:29:52,887 --> 00:29:55,285
I was going to kill myself.

381
00:29:55,689 --> 00:29:57,731
A fakir saved me.

382
00:29:57,971 --> 00:30:01,728
He said, "The Lord who created pain,
also created a remedy."

383
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:03,332
Here.

384
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:06,454
Put it under your tongue.
It'll melt away all pain.

385
00:30:06,534 --> 00:30:09,620
He gets it from the Himalayas.
So it's expensive.

386
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:12,052
But I'll send him the money.

387
00:30:37,298 --> 00:30:40,864
<i>The first time I did drugs,</i>
<i>was 'cause I was upset with dad.</i>

388
00:30:41,263 --> 00:30:43,991
<i>The second time, 'cause mom was dying.</i>

389
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,387
<i>By the third time, I was an addict.</i>

390
00:30:50,668 --> 00:30:53,262
<i>Then I got the news</i>
<i>that mom was in a coma.</i>

391
00:30:53,381 --> 00:30:55,581
<i>Dad summoned me to America.</i>

392
00:30:55,662 --> 00:30:57,626
<i>I traveled with my sisters...</i>

393
00:30:57,787 --> 00:30:59,590
<i>and 20 grams of cocaine.</i>

394
00:31:02,665 --> 00:31:04,953
<i>Being caught at the airport,</i>
<i>would've meant</i>

395
00:31:05,272 --> 00:31:08,628
<i>20 years in prison... even for my sisters.</i>

396
00:31:09,197 --> 00:31:10,948
<i>But back then, 20 years in prison,</i>

397
00:31:11,027 --> 00:31:12,588
<i>versus 20 grams of cocaine...</i>

398
00:31:12,826 --> 00:31:14,790
<i>my choice was crystal clear.</i>

399
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:18,440
<i>I was so irresponsible</i>

400
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:20,589
<i>that instead of spending time with mom,</i>

401
00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:23,313
<i>I'd smoke away in the fire exit.</i>

402
00:31:23,553 --> 00:31:26,564
<i>Then one night, walked into my life...</i>

403
00:31:27,991 --> 00:31:30,758
<i>Mr. Kamlesh Kanhaiyalal Kapasi.</i>

404
00:31:48,882 --> 00:31:51,640
-What did you steal?
-Twins...

405
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:55,839
-O Lord Ganesha!
-This is Jesus' jurisdiction.

406
00:31:56,241 --> 00:31:59,123
Lord Ganesha doesn't operate here.
What did you steal?

407
00:31:59,444 --> 00:32:02,481
I'd gone to keep the idol inside.

408
00:32:12,444 --> 00:32:16,247
I'm a fan of your parents.

409
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:19,606
Thought Lord Ganesha
will heal your mother.

410
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,731
But, what's "Twins"?

411
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:29,089
Eggs. Back home we call them Twins.

412
00:32:31,696 --> 00:32:33,573
Hope "The Twins" haven't parted ways.

413
00:32:33,936 --> 00:32:35,138
They are out of shape.

414
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,331
Come.

415
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:41,815
-Where?
-To get The Twins back in shape.

416
00:33:17,584 --> 00:33:19,308
Ever seen a topless girl?

417
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,300
Of course, I have.

418
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,264
-Where? On TV?
-No, live.

419
00:33:24,468 --> 00:33:27,950
My physics teacher, back home...

420
00:33:28,346 --> 00:33:30,304
his mother slipped in the bathroom.

421
00:33:30,423 --> 00:33:33,268
I broke the door,
hauled her on my shoulder

422
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:34,829
and put her in the ambulance.

423
00:33:34,986 --> 00:33:37,625
Stark naked... topless, bottomless.

424
00:33:37,906 --> 00:33:39,669
How old was she?

425
00:33:39,749 --> 00:33:41,309
Ninety. No, 91.

426
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,431
I did see stuff. I'm not naive.

427
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,392
-Ever had alcohol?
-Of course.

428
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,845
There's a saying back home...

429
00:34:10,964 --> 00:34:13,122
"Jam-jam bam-bam."

430
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,648
Translate that.

431
00:34:15,044 --> 00:34:16,563
"Jam-jam" is money.

432
00:34:16,762 --> 00:34:18,487
And "bam-bam"?

433
00:34:19,843 --> 00:34:21,040
Sex.

434
00:34:22,886 --> 00:34:26,484
Your jacket took away jam-jam,
I lost my bam-bam.

435
00:34:26,883 --> 00:34:29,564
You owe me a blonde.

436
00:34:35,286 --> 00:34:36,891
Cover me.

437
00:34:47,928 --> 00:34:49,135
Don't! You'll land in prison.

438
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:50,571
Relax.

439
00:35:42,986 --> 00:35:43,954
Run!

440
00:35:58,915 --> 00:36:00,994
Stop joking. We could've been arrested.

441
00:36:01,155 --> 00:36:03,322
Noble cause, brother.

442
00:36:05,835 --> 00:36:09,676
Your mom's in the hospital
and you're snorting?

443
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,003
Hey, Mr. Righteousness.

444
00:36:12,163 --> 00:36:14,074
We've been friends for just five minutes.

445
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,235
-Control your emotions.
-Friendship?

446
00:36:17,516 --> 00:36:20,922
You aren't a good son!
How'll you be a good friend?

447
00:36:25,397 --> 00:36:27,526
Get lost! I don't need a friend.

448
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,604
Hey, stop!

449
00:36:42,962 --> 00:36:44,451
I just can't quit.

450
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:50,569
Alright, go!

451
00:36:51,164 --> 00:36:55,332
If my friend was on drugs,
I wouldn't abandon him.

452
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,927
I'd thrash him till he quit.

453
00:37:06,132 --> 00:37:07,213
Throw it.

454
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:09,733
-I'll quit tomorrow.
-Now.

455
00:37:09,892 --> 00:37:11,420
I promise, tomorrow.

456
00:37:12,457 --> 00:37:15,134
-Let go my twins.
-Let go the powder.

457
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:17,491
-Twins first.
-Powder first.

458
00:37:17,772 --> 00:37:20,103
-I'm desperate.
-It's the time to fight.

459
00:37:20,463 --> 00:37:21,657
Say, "I'm a tiger."

460
00:37:21,855 --> 00:37:23,256
-Now, rorr.
-"Rorr"?

461
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:25,975
Once more.

462
00:37:30,258 --> 00:37:33,180
I quit! I promise.

463
00:37:35,539 --> 00:37:39,455
Never abandon me, Master.
Such words of wisdom...

464
00:37:39,778 --> 00:37:42,978
Rorr, jam-jam bam-bam, twins.

465
00:37:43,939 --> 00:37:45,348
Guess what?

466
00:37:45,468 --> 00:37:46,946
You didn't twist my twins...

467
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,062
but this.

468
00:37:57,586 --> 00:37:59,749
<i>I was seeking drugs in New York.</i>

469
00:37:59,826 --> 00:38:01,585
<i>Instead, I found a friend.</i>

470
00:38:01,665 --> 00:38:04,786
Kamlesh Kanhaiyalal Kapasi.
They call me Kamli.

471
00:38:04,986 --> 00:38:08,664
As Sex-spear has said, "What's in a name?"

472
00:38:09,185 --> 00:38:11,676
-Who?
-Sex-spear.

473
00:38:12,314 --> 00:38:13,703
William...

474
00:38:14,266 --> 00:38:16,471
-Sir, will you have snakes?
-Snakes?

475
00:38:16,748 --> 00:38:18,947
Snakes. There are lots in the hole.

476
00:38:19,712 --> 00:38:20,917
I'll get it, sir.

477
00:38:25,352 --> 00:38:29,197
<i>In his accent, snacks were "snakes"</i>
<i>and hall was "hole".</i>

478
00:38:29,438 --> 00:38:32,354
<i>He brought back our smiles.</i>

479
00:38:32,433 --> 00:38:37,202
<i>And miraculously,</i>
<i>his idol got mom out of coma.</i>

480
00:38:37,404 --> 00:38:38,873
Ready, everyone?

481
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:40,956
Smile.

482
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,438
At your film premiere,
I'll sit between father and son.

483
00:39:01,237 --> 00:39:04,363
As you appear on screen, I'll whistle.

484
00:39:09,001 --> 00:39:12,770
At your wedding, I'll dance on the table.

485
00:39:13,124 --> 00:39:15,121
Warn Ruby not to be embarrassed.

486
00:39:18,003 --> 00:39:22,561
<i>Mom didn't know Ruby wasn't talking to me.</i>

487
00:39:26,886 --> 00:39:28,531
<i>Mom didn't have much time left.</i>

488
00:39:28,936 --> 00:39:30,251
<i>I decided</i>

489
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:34,369
<i>I'd apologize to Ruby's dad</i>
<i>and ask for her hand.</i>

490
00:39:35,046 --> 00:39:36,729
I love Ruby and I want to...

491
00:39:39,647 --> 00:39:41,371
I've come to apologize.

492
00:39:41,652 --> 00:39:44,449
-I misbehaved that day.
-It's alright, child.

493
00:39:44,611 --> 00:39:46,540
-A tipple often does that.
-No, Daddy.

494
00:39:47,098 --> 00:39:50,133
I wasn't just drunk...
I had also done cocaine.

495
00:39:50,577 --> 00:39:56,652
Let me confess. The next day I did LSD.

496
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:59,180
But I've been clean for a month.

497
00:40:01,574 --> 00:40:02,659
Congratulations!

498
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,580
I'll go meet Ruby.

499
00:40:09,376 --> 00:40:11,503
-Ruby.
-Wait.

500
00:40:11,824 --> 00:40:14,376
Meet her on the 22nd
at Hotel Sun and Sand,

501
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:16,424
with these flowers.

502
00:40:16,862 --> 00:40:18,739
-What's on the 22nd?
-Wait.

503
00:40:25,504 --> 00:40:27,662
That's for your parents.

504
00:40:27,823 --> 00:40:29,830
And that's for you. Write your name.

505
00:40:29,909 --> 00:40:32,622
"Ruby weds..." Who's this Rustom?

506
00:40:35,662 --> 00:40:39,425
All this for a 10 rupee bill?
I'll glue it up.

507
00:40:39,505 --> 00:40:43,309
I'm glad you tore it. It led us to Rustom!

508
00:40:43,387 --> 00:40:46,518
He's a doctor in New York.
Not a junkie like you.

509
00:40:47,713 --> 00:40:49,024
Daddy, let me meet Ruby--

510
00:40:54,593 --> 00:40:56,749
Then what should I call you? Old fart?

511
00:40:57,146 --> 00:41:00,593
Meet Ruby over my dead body.

512
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,471
Fine, I'll wait.

513
00:41:02,551 --> 00:41:03,395
For what?

514
00:41:03,478 --> 00:41:05,074
For you to die, old fart!

515
00:41:07,795 --> 00:41:09,713
Rascal! Scoundrel!

516
00:41:09,912 --> 00:41:12,120
Get out!

517
00:41:12,201 --> 00:41:14,154
I'll break your legs, you swine.

518
00:41:16,478 --> 00:41:20,683
<i>Every addict looks for an excuse</i>
<i>to start again.</i>

519
00:41:20,844 --> 00:41:23,074
<i>My excuse was Ruby.</i>

520
00:41:32,598 --> 00:41:37,041
<i>Ruby, Ruby, Ruby</i>
<i>Let's rendezvous</i>

521
00:41:44,362 --> 00:41:47,612
<i>To have you back</i>

522
00:41:48,246 --> 00:41:51,768
<i>Your old man I'll hack</i>

523
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:59,407
<i>It's a win-win!</i>

524
00:41:59,488 --> 00:42:03,292
<i>He gets heaven, I get you</i>

525
00:42:05,135 --> 00:42:08,454
<i>The world has no heart</i>

526
00:42:08,534 --> 00:42:12,015
<i>So leave it, old fart</i>

527
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:16,212
<i>Goodbye, old man! Just die, old man!</i>

528
00:42:16,452 --> 00:42:21,580
<i>Your daughter, don't worry</i>
<i>Once you're dead, we'll marry</i>

529
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,937
<i>The sincerest prayers are always granted.</i>

530
00:42:26,853 --> 00:42:31,338
<i>The old man died</i>
<i>of a massive heart attack.</i>

531
00:42:31,495 --> 00:42:36,775
<i>The news was tragic. But I won't lie,</i>

532
00:42:36,857 --> 00:42:38,944
<i>I was ecstatic.</i>

533
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:44,498
<i>Ruby, Ruby, Ruby</i>
<i>Get set to rendezvous</i>

534
00:42:51,585 --> 00:42:56,309
<i>Ruby, Ruby, Ruby</i>
<i>You and I, we'll rendezvous</i>

535
00:42:58,178 --> 00:43:02,021
<i>This was my chance to win back Ruby.</i>

536
00:43:06,741 --> 00:43:10,825
<i>I had to show her,</i>
<i>I was more reliable than her fiancé.</i>

537
00:43:13,754 --> 00:43:17,949
<i>A minor problem... I was stoned.</i>

538
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,548
Papa!

539
00:43:20,107 --> 00:43:22,035
Don't abandon us, Papa.

540
00:43:22,237 --> 00:43:25,510
-Sanju, that's not papa.
-Wake up.

541
00:43:25,954 --> 00:43:27,110
That's not papa!

542
00:43:31,397 --> 00:43:33,792
Ha! I wondered how he'd shrunk so much.

543
00:43:38,235 --> 00:43:40,870
Is this our papa?

544
00:43:42,915 --> 00:43:44,953
Papa!

545
00:43:45,434 --> 00:43:47,645
Why did you abandon us?

546
00:43:47,801 --> 00:43:49,633
Wake up. Try!

547
00:43:52,918 --> 00:43:54,356
He isn't waking up.

548
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:56,926
Mummy, don't cry.

549
00:43:57,046 --> 00:43:59,277
Your son-in-law is with you.

550
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:05,248
Have you read the Holy Gita?

551
00:44:05,885 --> 00:44:08,804
"Everything happens for the best."
Superb!

552
00:44:09,604 --> 00:44:12,163
"Nothing we create...

553
00:44:12,527 --> 00:44:15,319
so nothing should we mourn."

554
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,043
Did you create this old man?
Gave him birth?

555
00:44:24,002 --> 00:44:25,406
Let her grieve.

556
00:44:25,487 --> 00:44:28,165
When my puppy died, I was bawling.

557
00:44:28,245 --> 00:44:31,889
A full-grown husband's exit
deserves howling.

558
00:44:31,968 --> 00:44:33,486
Take your time, Mummy.

559
00:44:33,566 --> 00:44:37,609
But remember, only the body perishes.

560
00:44:37,688 --> 00:44:39,379
The soul is eternal.

561
00:44:39,617 --> 00:44:41,089
Away with this body.

562
00:44:41,367 --> 00:44:43,253
Focus on the soul.

563
00:44:46,854 --> 00:44:49,018
Papa conked and you say, "All okay?"

564
00:44:50,408 --> 00:44:53,013
How shall we dispose the body?

565
00:44:53,133 --> 00:44:55,256
Bury it? Cremate it?

566
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,694
God, that's not our papa.

567
00:44:59,774 --> 00:45:02,575
Move that body. It's freaking confusing.

568
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:04,097
Move it.

569
00:45:04,823 --> 00:45:05,903
So, Ruby...

570
00:45:10,497 --> 00:45:11,736
What did I do?

571
00:45:16,215 --> 00:45:18,900
No one can tell it's secondhand.

572
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,699
A very fair price.

573
00:45:21,504 --> 00:45:22,908
Five hundred dollars.

574
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:26,183
What's this?

575
00:45:26,626 --> 00:45:28,181
Robbed a beggar?

576
00:45:28,262 --> 00:45:30,993
Robbed a barber! He cuts his own hair.

577
00:45:31,072 --> 00:45:33,062
Puts three dollars in the piggy bank.

578
00:45:33,181 --> 00:45:37,104
-Who's gonna count this?
-Call from India. It's Sanju!

579
00:45:37,183 --> 00:45:39,191
Awesome!

580
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:46,546
Sanju, perfect timing.
I'm buying my first car.

581
00:45:46,626 --> 00:45:48,434
I need you here, bro.

582
00:45:50,906 --> 00:45:52,990
Ruby's getting married.

583
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,267
<i>Please come.</i>

584
00:45:54,428 --> 00:45:57,679
-You snorting again?
-No. I swear.

585
00:45:57,756 --> 00:46:00,151
Please... come down.

586
00:46:00,753 --> 00:46:02,309
Sanju... Hello?

587
00:46:06,478 --> 00:46:08,593
Sir, no need to count.

588
00:46:08,755 --> 00:46:11,034
-The car will have to wait.
-Why?

589
00:46:11,114 --> 00:46:14,283
Need to buy a ticket to India.

590
00:46:16,914 --> 00:46:17,997
Sorry, sir.

591
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:20,074
Didn't want the car? Why make me count?

592
00:46:28,398 --> 00:46:29,518
Hello, Ruby.

593
00:46:29,798 --> 00:46:32,721
I'm Kamlesh Kanhaiyalal Kapasi.
Sanju's friend.

594
00:46:33,517 --> 00:46:35,363
Sir, can you go inside?

595
00:46:35,604 --> 00:46:36,680
Take a loo break.

596
00:46:38,481 --> 00:46:41,282
-Need to discuss a private matter.
-Come.

597
00:46:45,243 --> 00:46:48,533
Whatever the matter,
say it in front of me.

598
00:46:48,932 --> 00:46:50,921
It'll upset you.

599
00:46:51,162 --> 00:46:54,084
Take a stroll outside. Lovely weather.

600
00:46:58,012 --> 00:46:59,325
Really?

601
00:47:02,726 --> 00:47:04,852
Then name Ruby's favorite animal.

602
00:47:10,611 --> 00:47:11,847
You live in New York?

603
00:47:12,408 --> 00:47:15,813
Ask any jeweler there...

604
00:47:16,011 --> 00:47:18,132
They'll all say... "Penguin".

605
00:47:19,492 --> 00:47:20,892
-Know why?
-Why?

606
00:47:21,011 --> 00:47:24,455
For a month, Sanju hopped
from jeweler to jeweler

607
00:47:24,612 --> 00:47:28,414
for a wedding necklace
with a penguin pendant.

608
00:47:28,934 --> 00:47:30,418
And finally got it!

609
00:47:30,538 --> 00:47:32,344
But when he returned to India,

610
00:47:32,462 --> 00:47:34,938
he discovered that you were engaged.

611
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,776
He was shattered, so took to drugs again.

612
00:47:38,858 --> 00:47:41,024
But yesterday, he braved up.

613
00:47:41,102 --> 00:47:43,216
Flushed all the drugs down the drain.

614
00:47:43,658 --> 00:47:45,938
Swore never to touch them again.

615
00:47:46,018 --> 00:47:48,669
He prayed, "Lord, bring Ruby back."

616
00:47:49,468 --> 00:47:51,256
Sanju's back.

617
00:47:51,739 --> 00:47:52,904
Can you come back?

618
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,149
The wedding date, venue... it's all set.

619
00:47:57,230 --> 00:47:59,381
Nothing changes, except the groom.

620
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:01,304
The wedding cards have been printed.

621
00:48:01,386 --> 00:48:04,383
We'll put a "Sanju" sticker
over your name.

622
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:05,955
Don't sweat the small stuff.

623
00:48:11,107 --> 00:48:14,954
Ruby, in America
there'll be no house help.

624
00:48:15,154 --> 00:48:17,306
You'll be cleaning, mopping, washing...

625
00:48:17,467 --> 00:48:19,909
Imagine washing his sweaty underpants!

626
00:48:21,548 --> 00:48:23,037
I told you, you'd be upset.

627
00:48:23,117 --> 00:48:26,790
Sanju will be at the Marriage Registrar's,
tomorrow at 4 p.m.

628
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:42,712
Mister, what's her favorite food?

629
00:48:44,997 --> 00:48:47,274
Waffles. Sanju knows.

630
00:48:49,046 --> 00:48:50,358
Her favorite film?

631
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:52,878
<i>Mary Poppins.</i>

632
00:48:52,998 --> 00:48:55,796
Sanju knows. You have no clue.

633
00:48:56,318 --> 00:48:57,647
Ruby, 4 p.m. tomorrow.

634
00:48:58,046 --> 00:49:00,074
The Marriage Registrar's office.

635
00:49:15,409 --> 00:49:17,400
Where did you get money for this?

636
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:19,766
Your wallet, checks... They're with me.

637
00:49:22,407 --> 00:49:24,611
The wedding necklace...

638
00:49:24,731 --> 00:49:25,763
What about it?

639
00:49:25,882 --> 00:49:28,248
I sold it to God.

640
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:42,451
-Where's he?
-He isn't home.

641
00:49:42,529 --> 00:49:44,330
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

642
00:49:57,217 --> 00:50:00,975
I wait at the Registrar's office
and you get stoned here?

643
00:50:01,495 --> 00:50:05,054
No sweat. We'll marry tomorrow.

644
00:50:08,456 --> 00:50:12,138
You'd flushed the drugs!
Fished them out again?

645
00:50:18,379 --> 00:50:21,062
Where's the wedding necklace?

646
00:50:22,622 --> 00:50:24,150
Where is it?

647
00:50:24,631 --> 00:50:26,821
Where's the bloody necklace?

648
00:50:35,663 --> 00:50:37,027
The wedding necklace.

649
00:51:01,753 --> 00:51:03,471
Please wait, Ruby.

650
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:07,439
I'm sorry...

651
00:51:08,196 --> 00:51:09,151
Yuck.

652
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:12,912
He's not in his senses.
Won't remember a thing tomorrow!

653
00:51:12,992 --> 00:51:16,401
I swear, he did buy the wedding necklace.

654
00:51:18,594 --> 00:51:20,795
He's too far gone

655
00:51:21,074 --> 00:51:23,601
and to expect you'll hang on is not right.

656
00:51:25,044 --> 00:51:28,280
You move on, I'm with him.

657
00:51:38,401 --> 00:51:39,599
Kamlesh.

658
00:51:39,961 --> 00:51:40,886
Yes, Ruby.

659
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:43,043
Don't ever tell him what he did.

660
00:51:43,561 --> 00:51:45,204
He'll be devastated.

661
00:51:45,486 --> 00:51:46,763
Tell him...

662
00:51:47,841 --> 00:51:50,211
that rotten Ruby never showed up.

663
00:52:09,248 --> 00:52:10,851
You've been drinking?

664
00:52:10,971 --> 00:52:14,652
What I wanna say needs courage.

665
00:52:15,454 --> 00:52:17,931
So I downed a couple.

666
00:52:18,771 --> 00:52:19,975
Tell me.

667
00:52:21,452 --> 00:52:24,502
Your son will die before your wife!

668
00:52:24,981 --> 00:52:28,015
-He can't handle his life.
-Why?

669
00:52:28,736 --> 00:52:31,614
He sees you nursing your ailing wife.

670
00:52:32,298 --> 00:52:36,737
Any responsibility at home,
film industry, society...

671
00:52:37,098 --> 00:52:39,575
he sees you never shirk it.

672
00:52:42,266 --> 00:52:44,056
And your son...

673
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,778
He's an ordinary guy.

674
00:52:48,058 --> 00:52:51,067
No goals, no purpose in life.

675
00:52:51,148 --> 00:52:55,621
He says,
"There are three things to life, bro."

676
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:59,750
"C, B, S."

677
00:53:00,584 --> 00:53:03,706
"Chew, brew and scr..."

678
00:53:09,225 --> 00:53:12,706
The problem is, you want him to be you!

679
00:53:14,545 --> 00:53:15,671
He's buried...

680
00:53:16,034 --> 00:53:19,306
buried under the weight of your legacy!

681
00:53:19,788 --> 00:53:23,549
He knows, however hard he toils,
he can never be as great.

682
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:26,390
So, he doesn't even try.

683
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:31,230
Feels a hero with nobodies like me.

684
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:34,717
"Yo, Kamli...", "Hey, Kamli..."

685
00:53:38,433 --> 00:53:41,357
What should I do, Kamlesh?

686
00:53:41,436 --> 00:53:42,919
Sir, you...

687
00:53:47,437 --> 00:53:49,195
Just be his friend.

688
00:53:49,275 --> 00:53:51,122
Sit with him.

689
00:53:51,522 --> 00:53:52,875
Drink with him.

690
00:53:52,954 --> 00:53:55,519
Use a few cuss words, and say...

691
00:53:55,597 --> 00:54:00,205
"Sonny, it's okay to be ordinary."

692
00:54:00,681 --> 00:54:02,761
"You don't have to be Sunil Dutt."

693
00:54:02,841 --> 00:54:05,518
"It's okay to be Sanjay Dutt.”

694
00:54:05,997 --> 00:54:09,443
Sir, please save him.

695
00:54:11,203 --> 00:54:12,244
If he dies,

696
00:54:12,324 --> 00:54:15,968
whom will I tell, "Let go my twins"?

697
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:21,445
Please, sir, save him.

698
00:54:24,249 --> 00:54:25,852
Save him.

699
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:47,254
I showed the distributors your film.

700
00:54:47,372 --> 00:54:52,216
They went crazy...
"What a freaking actor!"

701
00:54:57,572 --> 00:54:59,260
Has mom seen the posters?

702
00:54:59,542 --> 00:55:01,296
She's in hospital.

703
00:55:01,813 --> 00:55:02,694
What happened?

704
00:55:04,059 --> 00:55:06,253
She slipped into a coma again.

705
00:55:06,334 --> 00:55:09,937
-I just met her yesterday!
-No, day before.

706
00:55:10,017 --> 00:55:13,698
You've woken up after two days. It's okay.

707
00:55:17,864 --> 00:55:19,579
I've spoken to the doctors.

708
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:22,660
They recommend a rehab center in America.

709
00:55:22,978 --> 00:55:23,819
Ready?

710
00:55:24,545 --> 00:55:25,510
No!

711
00:55:25,747 --> 00:55:27,181
Please don't send me there, Dad.

712
00:55:27,342 --> 00:55:28,983
Just a few days, sonny.

713
00:55:29,465 --> 00:55:30,582
No.

714
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:37,987
Come out. We won't send you anywhere.

715
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:40,783
I had one cigarette, you packed me off
to boarding school.

716
00:55:40,864 --> 00:55:43,591
I was just six.
Couldn't even tie my shoelaces.

717
00:55:43,671 --> 00:55:44,905
I missed mom.

718
00:55:46,749 --> 00:55:47,628
Please come out.

719
00:55:48,826 --> 00:55:50,551
I won't go anywhere.

720
00:55:50,834 --> 00:55:53,228
I'll stay with mom in the hospital!

721
00:55:58,026 --> 00:56:00,915
<i>Dad agreed... on one condition.</i>

722
00:56:01,037 --> 00:56:04,195
<i>That I wouldn't do drugs in the hospital.</i>

723
00:56:04,472 --> 00:56:05,831
<i>And I promised.</i>

724
00:56:06,431 --> 00:56:08,760
<i>I started spending</i>
<i>every night at the hospital.</i>

725
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,755
<i>I'd stare at mom for hours.</i>

726
00:56:12,074 --> 00:56:14,433
<i>I'd hold her hand and talk to her.</i>

727
00:56:14,792 --> 00:56:16,760
The premiere's next week.

728
00:56:16,921 --> 00:56:18,201
Won't you come?

729
00:56:18,636 --> 00:56:19,592
Get up, Mom.

730
00:56:19,915 --> 00:56:21,678
You gotta see me act.

731
00:56:22,037 --> 00:56:23,875
You'll be proud, Mom.

732
00:56:24,921 --> 00:56:25,845
Mom.

733
00:56:28,235 --> 00:56:29,400
<i>Then one day...</i>

734
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,919
<i>I couldn't resist.</i>

735
00:56:45,018 --> 00:56:46,338
<i>Sanju...</i>

736
00:58:01,068 --> 00:58:03,112
<i>Mom never saw my film.</i>

737
00:58:03,829 --> 00:58:07,354
<i>She died three days before the premiere.</i>

738
00:58:07,912 --> 00:58:09,193
<i>She'd left a note...</i>

739
00:58:09,273 --> 00:58:12,074
<i>"Even if I'm gone, the show must go on."</i>

740
00:58:19,235 --> 00:58:24,600
<i>They call me Rocky</i>
<i>Yes, my name is Rocky!</i>

741
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:32,282
<i>Friend and foe</i>
<i>To both I say hello</i>

742
00:58:33,122 --> 00:58:39,439
<i>Friend and foe</i>
<i>To both I say hello</i>

743
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:46,323
<i>They call me Rocky</i>
<i>Yes, my name is Rocky!</i>

744
00:58:49,045 --> 00:58:50,725
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

745
00:58:52,205 --> 00:58:55,003
Excuse me, Mr. Dutt.
Is anyone sitting here?

746
00:58:55,923 --> 00:58:58,648
Yes... my wife.

747
00:59:20,411 --> 00:59:22,772
<i>Sanju, you'll be a film star!</i>

748
00:59:24,533 --> 00:59:26,972
<i>Dad worries a lot about you.</i>

749
00:59:27,092 --> 00:59:29,852
<i>I've been offered a Hollywood film.</i>

750
00:59:30,015 --> 00:59:32,657
<i>At your wedding, I'll dance on the table.</i>

751
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:38,814
Sanju.

752
00:59:47,096 --> 00:59:48,219
What happened?

753
00:59:49,421 --> 00:59:51,903
Mom opened her eyes before she died.

754
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,979
She touched my head to bless me.

755
00:59:59,902 --> 01:00:02,901
Not sure if it happened
or I was hallucinating...

756
01:00:03,543 --> 01:00:05,262
I'm a mess, Dad.

757
01:00:05,543 --> 01:00:08,584
I can't tell what's real
and what's imaginary.

758
01:00:11,823 --> 01:00:13,023
Are you real, Dad?

759
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:16,670
Buddy, listen.

760
01:00:16,828 --> 01:00:18,587
Is that Mr. Sunil Dutt?

761
01:00:19,304 --> 01:00:21,628
-Is dad there?
-Yes.

762
01:00:23,548 --> 01:00:24,790
Please save me, Dad.

763
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:26,073
I want to quit drugs.

764
01:00:26,232 --> 01:00:27,629
I want to live.

765
01:00:31,672 --> 01:00:34,676
You'll be fine, sonny.

766
01:00:40,993 --> 01:00:42,794
<i>Dad got me to America for treatment.</i>

767
01:00:46,151 --> 01:00:50,396
<i>I was given a list.</i>

768
01:00:56,796 --> 01:00:59,118
<i>He was shocked that I was still alive.</i>

769
01:01:07,842 --> 01:01:09,766
<i>My treatment started.</i>

770
01:01:13,401 --> 01:01:15,886
<i>As the drugs stopped, my body rebelled.</i>

771
01:01:16,203 --> 01:01:18,047
<i>A storm unleashed within.</i>

772
01:01:18,369 --> 01:01:21,043
<i>Often I shivered as if inside an ice slab.</i>

773
01:01:21,163 --> 01:01:23,204
<i>Biting cold I couldn't bear.</i>

774
01:01:24,845 --> 01:01:27,086
<i>Often my body was ablaze.</i>

775
01:01:27,244 --> 01:01:28,683
<i>I was burning.</i>

776
01:01:30,165 --> 01:01:31,726
<i>Bombs exploded in my head.</i>

777
01:01:31,846 --> 01:01:34,449
<i>My pulse would spike up to 150.</i>

778
01:01:34,648 --> 01:01:36,527
<i>My hands would tremor.</i>

779
01:01:36,607 --> 01:01:39,168
<i>Depression, anxiety... I couldn't bear it.</i>

780
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:00,256
<i>I couldn't take it. I ran away.</i>

781
01:02:00,738 --> 01:02:02,373
<i>I was desperate for drugs.</i>

782
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:25,543
<i>The only person who'd lend me money</i>

783
01:02:25,664 --> 01:02:28,821
<i>was 1500 miles away, in New York.</i>

784
01:02:32,663 --> 01:02:36,385
<i>Like a madman,</i>
<i>I took off for New York... on foot.</i>

785
01:03:07,595 --> 01:03:09,876
<i>I realized the power of attire.</i>

786
01:03:10,075 --> 01:03:12,231
<i>When the clothes were clean, I got rides.</i>

787
01:03:12,793 --> 01:03:15,915
<i>When dirty, I got alms.</i>

788
01:03:21,916 --> 01:03:23,636
<i>Both served well.</i>

789
01:03:25,798 --> 01:03:28,477
<i>A few days of begging</i>
<i>earned me a bus ticket.</i>

790
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:31,635
<i>In 12 days, I was in New York.</i>

791
01:03:49,843 --> 01:03:51,726
I'll have one drink and go back.

792
01:03:53,169 --> 01:03:54,683
Never had a drink with you.

793
01:03:55,483 --> 01:03:59,086
Just one and I'll go away.

794
01:04:35,578 --> 01:04:37,695
When your mom was in hospital,

795
01:04:37,895 --> 01:04:41,217
she'd send these recordings.

796
01:04:41,698 --> 01:04:43,099
Ever listened to them?

797
01:04:49,215 --> 01:04:51,701
<i>Silly piglet, how are you?</i>

798
01:04:52,941 --> 01:04:56,179
<i>Remember, when angry,</i>
<i>I'd call you "piglet"?</i>

799
01:04:57,218 --> 01:05:00,864
<i>And you'd say, "Why are you</i>
<i>calling your husband names?"</i>

800
01:05:01,024 --> 01:05:04,339
<i>"If I'm a piglet, my father's the swine!"</i>

801
01:05:06,101 --> 01:05:08,426
<i>Hello, Sanju. This is Mr. Swine.</i>

802
01:05:08,585 --> 01:05:11,465
<i>-Working hard?</i>
<i>-Don't worry about me.</i>

803
01:05:11,785 --> 01:05:14,145
<i>I won't die before I see your film.</i>

804
01:05:14,384 --> 01:05:16,990
<i>I'm by your side. Steadfast!</i>

805
01:05:17,071 --> 01:05:18,790
<i>Like a Master said,</i>

806
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:22,667
<i>Wherever you go</i>

807
01:05:23,187 --> 01:05:26,711
<i>My shadow will follow</i>

808
01:05:26,831 --> 01:05:29,788
<i>Tell him your theory of the Masters.</i>

809
01:05:30,428 --> 01:05:33,351
<i>Before the movies, I was a radio jockey.</i>

810
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:37,830
<i>I encountered thousands of songs</i>
<i>with beautiful, deep verses.</i>

811
01:05:38,069 --> 01:05:40,390
<i>I accepted those songwriters</i>
<i>as my Masters.</i>

812
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:44,677
<i>When in trouble, I say,</i>
<i>"Guide me, O Master."</i>

813
01:05:44,757 --> 01:05:47,234
<i>And a song comes to rescue.</i>

814
01:05:47,312 --> 01:05:50,716
<i>So which Master can help Sanju?</i>

815
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:52,757
Majrooh Sultanpuri.

816
01:05:52,838 --> 01:05:55,596
<i>Presenting from Sloan Hospital...</i>

817
01:05:56,276 --> 01:05:57,635
<i>Water, please.</i>

818
01:05:58,836 --> 01:06:00,480
Dad, it's the tape.

819
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:06,678
<i>Here's some water. Please rest.</i>

820
01:06:06,758 --> 01:06:08,682
<i>What about the song?</i>

821
01:06:08,804 --> 01:06:12,319
<i>Tomorrow, I promise! Rest now.</i>

822
01:06:15,641 --> 01:06:16,923
Which song was it, Dad?

823
01:06:19,967 --> 01:06:23,082
<i>Don't you ever stop</i>

824
01:06:23,803 --> 01:06:25,967
<i>With your head hung in despair</i>

825
01:06:27,287 --> 01:06:30,046
<i>After this woeful walk over thorns</i>

826
01:06:30,126 --> 01:06:33,126
<i>You will enjoy</i>
<i>The embrace of blossoms</i>

827
01:06:34,209 --> 01:06:36,932
<i>Wanderer,</i>
<i>O wanderer</i>

828
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:41,048
<i>O Wanderer</i>

829
01:06:47,689 --> 01:06:53,574
<i>Break every shackle</i>

830
01:06:57,290 --> 01:07:02,298
<i>Smith each into</i>

831
01:07:03,935 --> 01:07:07,375
<i>A sword</i>

832
01:07:08,899 --> 01:07:14,335
<i>Fight every battle</i>

833
01:07:15,497 --> 01:07:20,305
<i>Conquer every peak</i>

834
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:33,902
<i>You may be shattered</i>

835
01:07:34,503 --> 01:07:37,148
<i>Show them you ain't battered</i>

836
01:07:37,268 --> 01:07:41,141
<i>Hope still simmers in your soul!</i>

837
01:07:42,624 --> 01:07:44,787
<i>When your spirit you wield</i>

838
01:07:45,349 --> 01:07:47,945
<i>The heavens will yield</i>

839
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:51,990
<i>Lead you unfettered to your goal</i>

840
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:55,548
<i>If by miseries you're hunted</i>

841
01:07:56,027 --> 01:07:58,307
<i>If your weapons are blunted</i>

842
01:07:58,747 --> 01:08:03,235
<i>Stop failure's advances</i>
<i>With those broken lances</i>

843
01:08:03,315 --> 01:08:05,511
<i>Climb every mountain</i>

844
01:08:06,192 --> 01:08:08,551
<i>Conquer every peak</i>

845
01:08:08,832 --> 01:08:11,597
<i>Strive, do not bow down</i>

846
01:08:12,193 --> 01:08:14,152
<i>Attain what you seek!</i>

847
01:08:14,352 --> 01:08:16,672
<i>Climb every mountain</i>

848
01:08:17,073 --> 01:08:19,397
<i>Conquer every peak</i>

849
01:08:19,799 --> 01:08:22,675
<i>Strive, do not bow down</i>

850
01:08:22,754 --> 01:08:25,154
<i>Attain what you seek!</i>

851
01:08:41,519 --> 01:08:44,283
<i>Take by the scruff of the neck</i>

852
01:08:44,364 --> 01:08:47,362
<i>The dark clouds of misery</i>

853
01:08:47,563 --> 01:08:51,803
<i>Rattle them till they reveal</i>
<i>The abode of Victory</i>

854
01:08:52,166 --> 01:08:55,245
<i>With the stars you'll be crowned</i>

855
01:08:55,445 --> 01:08:58,283
<i>The sky, your playground</i>

856
01:08:58,402 --> 01:09:03,131
<i>Break away from the herd</i>

857
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:08,487
<i>Fortune will be yours</i>
<i>That so far frowned</i>

858
01:09:09,207 --> 01:09:13,129
<i>Stop failure's advances</i>
<i>With those broken lances</i>

859
01:09:16,609 --> 01:09:18,894
<i>Climb every mountain</i>

860
01:09:19,375 --> 01:09:21,692
<i>Conquer every peak</i>

861
01:09:22,051 --> 01:09:25,252
<i>Strive, do not bow down</i>

862
01:09:25,331 --> 01:09:27,254
<i>Attain what you seek!</i>

863
01:09:27,334 --> 01:09:29,853
<i>Climb every mountain</i>

864
01:09:30,254 --> 01:09:32,614
<i>Conquer every peak</i>

865
01:09:33,054 --> 01:09:35,696
<i>Strive, do not bow down</i>

866
01:09:35,975 --> 01:09:38,220
<i>Attain what you seek!</i>

867
01:09:38,737 --> 01:09:43,576
<i>Attain what you seek!</i>

868
01:09:43,656 --> 01:09:49,538
<i>Attain what you seek!</i>

869
01:09:55,312 --> 01:10:01,391
<i>Fight every battle</i>

870
01:10:02,715 --> 01:10:07,632
<i>Conquer every peak</i>

871
01:10:11,157 --> 01:10:13,596
He's off drugs for 18 months.

872
01:10:14,116 --> 01:10:17,953
Wear sunglasses,
our boy is glowing like a floodlight.

873
01:10:19,761 --> 01:10:24,876
As your Sex-spear says,
"All's well that ends well."

874
01:10:26,436 --> 01:10:29,321
Take the bags. The taximeter's on.

875
01:10:29,883 --> 01:10:31,320
Hurry up.

876
01:10:32,242 --> 01:10:33,399
It's not "the end" yet.

877
01:10:33,477 --> 01:10:36,481
<i>The doctor warned, he could relapse.</i>

878
01:10:36,564 --> 01:10:39,601
If he starts again, he'll die.

879
01:10:40,284 --> 01:10:42,842
Please keep him away from bad company.

880
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,722
Thank you, son.

881
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:05,408
Dad, you carry on. I'll join you.

882
01:11:10,848 --> 01:11:13,015
For how long can we stop him?

883
01:11:13,372 --> 01:11:17,291
Now he must fight his own battles.
Let's go.

884
01:11:17,728 --> 01:11:19,572
I thought you wouldn't meet me.

885
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:21,775
How could I not?

886
01:11:21,973 --> 01:11:25,253
I thought of you every day
the past 18 months.

887
01:11:28,176 --> 01:11:30,577
I have a special welcome-back gift.

888
01:11:30,736 --> 01:11:33,935
Haven't seen such fine stuff in 18 years.

889
01:11:34,455 --> 01:11:36,900
Just to celebrate your return.

890
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:41,339
Normally, I don't share
such exclusive stuff with anyone.

891
01:11:42,978 --> 01:11:44,296
To your health.

892
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:51,419
Bro, that's my dose. It's potent.

893
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:53,098
Too strong for you.

894
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:55,947
Doesn't such potent stuff
ruin your health?

895
01:11:57,344 --> 01:11:59,540
Your parents must've
gifted you strong genes.

896
01:11:59,661 --> 01:12:01,100
How are they?

897
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:04,308
They're fine... by the grace of God.

898
01:12:04,589 --> 01:12:06,945
Amazing!
They're reborn after the car crash?

899
01:12:15,068 --> 01:12:17,905
Glucose powder suits me fine.

900
01:12:18,825 --> 01:12:19,869
Now try that!

901
01:12:27,388 --> 01:12:28,995
I cracked it!

902
01:12:29,073 --> 01:12:32,233
You took glucose and fed me drugs.

903
01:12:33,472 --> 01:12:36,069
You aren't an addict, you're a peddler!

904
01:12:36,431 --> 01:12:38,676
Posed as a friend for my money.

905
01:12:42,354 --> 01:12:44,953
Bro, I'll return your money.

906
01:12:45,033 --> 01:12:46,718
Great idea!

907
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,915
Return those five years
which I was too numb to feel.

908
01:12:51,875 --> 01:12:55,520
My father hasn't slept in five years.
Return that lost sleep.

909
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:59,678
I lost Ruby. Can you get her back?

910
01:13:00,038 --> 01:13:02,881
My sisters stopped smiling.
Return that smile.

911
01:13:02,959 --> 01:13:05,040
Can you? You peddler!

912
01:13:32,682 --> 01:13:35,121
My real gods.

913
01:13:36,081 --> 01:13:36,926
And one more.

914
01:13:40,285 --> 01:13:42,004
Lord Ganesha, MD.

915
01:13:42,886 --> 01:13:44,722
He's lived with me in prison, too.

916
01:13:50,485 --> 01:13:51,608
You're crying?

917
01:13:52,844 --> 01:13:54,169
Was the story so bad?

918
01:13:56,177 --> 01:13:57,810
Will you write it?

919
01:14:09,891 --> 01:14:11,374
We'll continue then.

920
01:14:14,694 --> 01:14:17,575
Winnie, do you have a boyfriend?

921
01:14:18,293 --> 01:14:21,099
-Yes. Why?
-Tell him, he's very lucky.

922
01:14:21,662 --> 01:14:23,618
'Cause I'm intelligent and good looking?

923
01:14:24,894 --> 01:14:27,175
-'Cause I'm going to prison.
-Stop it.

924
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:30,263
When he's happy he blabbers.

925
01:14:50,622 --> 01:14:53,223
So, you met the terrorist.

926
01:14:53,303 --> 01:14:56,869
Also figured why you're
desperate to stop me.

927
01:14:57,429 --> 01:15:01,025
Once a drug-peddler, now a big builder.

928
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:06,309
Even his lies seem true.

929
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:12,309
Ask him why his best friend, Kamlesh,
hasn't spoken to him in 20 years.

930
01:15:13,274 --> 01:15:14,832
Ask him.

931
01:15:44,038 --> 01:15:46,518
I'm writing a book
on your friend, Sanjay Dutt.

932
01:15:48,244 --> 01:15:49,599
He's not my friend.

933
01:15:52,602 --> 01:15:56,486
But he says, "Kamli is my best friend."

934
01:15:58,681 --> 01:15:59,600
In a past life.

935
01:16:01,162 --> 01:16:06,885
Then in this life, why are you
glued to the TV watching his news?

936
01:17:00,377 --> 01:17:04,141
-You called from India?
-Right. And you hung up.

937
01:17:04,338 --> 01:17:05,345
So, I'm here.

938
01:17:06,583 --> 01:17:10,578
Look, I promise, I won't even
mention you in the book.

939
01:17:14,428 --> 01:17:16,542
-Shall we sit somewhere?
-Sure.

940
01:17:17,218 --> 01:17:19,501
I know a great place.

941
01:17:22,389 --> 01:17:23,266
Where?

942
01:17:26,104 --> 01:17:27,464
Follow Aunt Annie.

943
01:17:34,226 --> 01:17:35,627
Remember this place?

944
01:17:58,397 --> 01:18:02,191
He loves you. Why did you cut off ties?

945
01:18:04,195 --> 01:18:06,202
Do you know what RDX is?

946
01:18:08,277 --> 01:18:10,515
It was used in the Mumbai bomb blasts.

947
01:18:10,593 --> 01:18:12,279
And where was it stored?

948
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,119
In a truck parked at Sanjay Dutt's house.

949
01:18:17,198 --> 01:18:19,998
He knew Mumbai would be bombed,
but kept mum.

950
01:18:20,077 --> 01:18:23,247
-Who told you?
-The man who loved him the most.

951
01:18:23,685 --> 01:18:24,599
Who?

952
01:18:25,482 --> 01:18:27,879
Sunil Dutt... his father.

953
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:51,166
Tell me your side of the story.

954
01:18:51,247 --> 01:18:53,248
If he's a terrorist, I'll scrap the book.

955
01:18:53,408 --> 01:18:56,169
I flew 12000 km just to meet you.

956
01:18:56,249 --> 01:18:59,089
And I wasted 12 years of my life with him.

957
01:18:59,410 --> 01:19:00,608
No more time for him.

958
01:19:00,688 --> 01:19:02,689
He's the one with no time.
He's off to prison.

959
01:19:02,770 --> 01:19:04,492
Know what he's taking along?

960
01:19:17,136 --> 01:19:19,416
This story has four characters.

961
01:19:19,532 --> 01:19:21,295
Sanjay Dutt, Sunil Dutt,

962
01:19:21,375 --> 01:19:24,020
I, and the Babri mosque.

963
01:19:25,377 --> 01:19:29,214
Babri mosque was demolished
on 6th December, 1992.

964
01:19:30,017 --> 01:19:31,422
Riots burned the country.

965
01:19:33,103 --> 01:19:35,500
<i>Mr. Dutt was then a Member of Parliament.</i>

966
01:19:35,659 --> 01:19:37,018
<i>He'd stopped making films.</i>

967
01:19:37,098 --> 01:19:39,181
<i>All his time was spent serving people.</i>

968
01:19:39,863 --> 01:19:41,982
<i>When riots erupted in his constituency</i>

969
01:19:42,061 --> 01:19:45,619
<i>and Muslim homes were burnt,</i>
<i>he plunged into relief work.</i>

970
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:49,510
<i>And his son, unconcerned,</i>
<i>lived in his own world.</i>

971
01:19:56,505 --> 01:20:01,465
<i>He was no longer the drug-addict.</i>

972
01:20:01,545 --> 01:20:05,711
<i>He reigned as an A-list film star</i>
<i>those 12 years.</i>

973
01:20:06,072 --> 01:20:09,028
<i>As for me... my IT business</i>
<i>was prospering.</i>

974
01:20:09,267 --> 01:20:11,987
<i>I made tons of money.</i>
<i>But had one grouse...</i>

975
01:20:12,466 --> 01:20:14,191
<i>I was still a virgin.</i>

976
01:20:14,273 --> 01:20:17,430
<i>Then I met a girl, Pinky.</i>

977
01:20:17,511 --> 01:20:22,955
<i>I flew every weekend to Mumbai,</i>
<i>hoping to get lucky.</i>

978
01:20:25,634 --> 01:20:28,631
<i>The result... I was jetlagged 24/7.</i>

979
01:20:29,071 --> 01:20:31,437
Still on the runway? Not taken off?

980
01:20:31,517 --> 01:20:33,518
Sir, we've landed.

981
01:20:33,598 --> 01:20:34,395
Landed?

982
01:20:34,473 --> 01:20:37,193
<i>This time, Sanju had</i>
<i>invited Pinky for dinner.</i>

983
01:20:37,874 --> 01:20:41,721
<i>The mission was to make sure I score.</i>

984
01:20:47,198 --> 01:20:48,682
Pinky loves pink.

985
01:20:48,762 --> 01:20:51,159
She asked for a pink t-shirt.

986
01:20:51,239 --> 01:20:53,560
So you bought the store?

987
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:54,478
Superb!

988
01:20:57,404 --> 01:20:59,801
Control... You're drinking too much.

989
01:21:00,163 --> 01:21:02,322
Need courage to open my account.

990
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,804
Account! Which bank?

991
01:21:04,925 --> 01:21:08,767
My aunt's cousin is a banker.
You'll be done in a jiffy.

992
01:21:09,042 --> 01:21:11,682
-You need an account, too?
-No, I have many accounts.

993
01:21:20,365 --> 01:21:22,048
What's all this?

994
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:24,136
All for you.

995
01:21:26,127 --> 01:21:29,168
This pink t-shirt, sweater,

996
01:21:30,931 --> 01:21:32,056
lin-jer-ree...

997
01:21:34,809 --> 01:21:39,172
This pink nightie, just for you! Try it.

998
01:21:39,374 --> 01:21:44,171
No, I'll stick to the t-shirt.

999
01:21:49,739 --> 01:21:50,819
One moment.

1000
01:21:52,614 --> 01:21:54,855
Do you know why
nighties are called nighties?

1001
01:21:55,654 --> 01:21:56,539
Why?

1002
01:21:57,459 --> 01:21:59,621
'Cause they are worn at night.

1003
01:22:01,097 --> 01:22:05,859
Scriptures say,
hour and attire must match.

1004
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:23,105
I've got her in the nightie.

1005
01:22:23,468 --> 01:22:25,864
-Your job is to get her out of it.
-Done!

1006
01:22:27,421 --> 01:22:31,108
Don't overdrink,
or there'll be no bam-bam.

1007
01:22:32,511 --> 01:22:35,626
I'm out of here. Freshen up.

1008
01:22:35,786 --> 01:22:36,867
I'll change, too.

1009
01:23:00,756 --> 01:23:04,153
<i>On a journey to the moon</i>

1010
01:23:05,595 --> 01:23:09,196
<i>Let's dance, let's swoon</i>

1011
01:23:10,235 --> 01:23:13,678
<i>It's one night's delight</i>

1012
01:23:15,041 --> 01:23:17,678
<i>Then our paths will divide</i>

1013
01:23:19,358 --> 01:23:22,921
<i>On a journey to the moon</i>

1014
01:23:24,164 --> 01:23:27,597
<i>Let's dance, let's swoon</i>

1015
01:23:28,761 --> 01:23:32,002
<i>Just one night's delight</i>

1016
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:36,481
<i>Come, set me alight</i>

1017
01:23:37,041 --> 01:23:38,281
Kamli...

1018
01:23:43,088 --> 01:23:45,966
Kamli, wake up.

1019
01:23:46,127 --> 01:23:47,206
Get up.

1020
01:23:48,447 --> 01:23:50,372
Time for bam-bam.

1021
01:23:50,573 --> 01:23:51,887
Wake up. You're a tiger.

1022
01:23:52,167 --> 01:23:54,207
Roar!

1023
01:23:54,567 --> 01:23:55,486
Come on.

1024
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:14,853
<i>You are no saint</i>

1025
01:24:15,176 --> 01:24:19,052
<i>Nor am I</i>

1026
01:24:19,854 --> 01:24:24,219
<i>It's one night's delight</i>

1027
01:24:24,501 --> 01:24:28,457
<i>Let's not be uptight</i>

1028
01:24:32,299 --> 01:24:36,417
<i>On a journey to the moon</i>

1029
01:24:37,178 --> 01:24:41,304
<i>Let's dance, let's swoon</i>

1030
01:24:41,864 --> 01:24:45,901
<i>Just one night's delight</i>

1031
01:24:46,421 --> 01:24:50,228
<i>Come, set me alight</i>

1032
01:25:04,785 --> 01:25:06,952
Baby, you ready?

1033
01:25:07,031 --> 01:25:08,512
Have breakfast, Kamli.

1034
01:25:08,833 --> 01:25:11,348
-You're meeting some girls today.
-I have a girlfriend.

1035
01:25:11,429 --> 01:25:14,229
Forget her. She's a floozy.

1036
01:25:14,309 --> 01:25:17,356
-Shush... she'll hear you.
-She's gone.

1037
01:25:17,874 --> 01:25:20,350
You were very irresponsible last night!

1038
01:25:20,711 --> 01:25:23,192
You passed out and I had to bam-bam...

1039
01:25:23,513 --> 01:25:25,916
and then wrap up your pink store.

1040
01:25:27,273 --> 01:25:29,712
Chill, I'll set it up
for the next attempt.

1041
01:25:29,790 --> 01:25:32,475
Tell me you're lying.

1042
01:25:33,479 --> 01:25:37,034
I was checking her loyalty towards you.

1043
01:25:37,356 --> 01:25:41,641
I held her hand,
she rubbed it with her thumb.

1044
01:25:41,962 --> 01:25:44,558
That's all she does.

1045
01:25:44,877 --> 01:25:47,038
Never goes further.

1046
01:25:47,997 --> 01:25:49,600
With me, she went further, bro.

1047
01:25:50,564 --> 01:25:52,840
I said, "Nightie."

1048
01:25:55,598 --> 01:25:56,838
She took it off?

1049
01:26:03,082 --> 01:26:05,002
It was clear,
she can't be my sister-in-law.

1050
01:26:05,882 --> 01:26:07,606
No one cheats on my best friend!

1051
01:26:08,492 --> 01:26:11,683
It was guilt-free bam-bam.
What's her name?

1052
01:26:12,243 --> 01:26:14,082
You slept with her
and don't know her name?

1053
01:26:14,161 --> 01:26:16,247
Name after the game? Bad manners!

1054
01:26:16,329 --> 01:26:18,365
You swine!

1055
01:26:19,567 --> 01:26:22,765
I've unveiled her true colors.

1056
01:26:22,846 --> 01:26:25,454
You should be grateful.

1057
01:26:26,652 --> 01:26:27,768
<i>Hey, Sanju.</i>

1058
01:26:28,249 --> 01:26:30,646
<i>Your pop's buddying up to the Muslims.</i>

1059
01:26:30,968 --> 01:26:33,013
-Drill sense into him.
-Who the hell...?

1060
01:26:33,095 --> 01:26:35,532
<i>You half-Muslim!</i>

1061
01:26:35,611 --> 01:26:38,731
<i>Your sister is sizzling hot.</i>
<i>Shall I get her raped?</i>

1062
01:26:39,009 --> 01:26:39,852
Hey!

1063
01:26:41,979 --> 01:26:44,733
<i>It's a stone. Could've been a grenade.</i>

1064
01:26:45,052 --> 01:26:48,530
<i>Your pop's loading trucks</i>
<i>with relief material, right?</i>

1065
01:26:48,935 --> 01:26:53,015
<i>-I'll bump him off.</i>
<i>-Hello!</i>

1066
01:27:07,624 --> 01:27:10,219
-Let's get out of here.
-We've got a threat call.

1067
01:27:10,421 --> 01:27:13,139
You wake up late. I've already got five.

1068
01:27:13,339 --> 01:27:15,141
Barking dogs seldom bite.

1069
01:27:15,261 --> 01:27:17,388
Out here you can be shot.

1070
01:27:17,469 --> 01:27:18,503
We'll shield him.

1071
01:27:19,142 --> 01:27:20,783
We'll take the bullet.

1072
01:27:20,863 --> 01:27:24,625
We'll defend Mr. Dutt
till our last breath.

1073
01:27:24,706 --> 01:27:26,630
With that toy? Does it even work?

1074
01:27:26,709 --> 01:27:28,464
Yes, it does.

1075
01:27:34,111 --> 01:27:36,667
When did you last fire it? World War II?

1076
01:27:37,068 --> 01:27:38,467
Stop it, Sanju.

1077
01:27:38,546 --> 01:27:40,264
Hurry, load the truck.

1078
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:42,754
Reason with dad. He never listens to me.

1079
01:27:42,874 --> 01:27:45,867
Look at him, and then at yourself.

1080
01:27:45,947 --> 01:27:47,429
He helps strangers.

1081
01:27:47,509 --> 01:27:50,635
While you bam-bam your best friend's girl.

1082
01:28:12,034 --> 01:28:14,955
<i>Hey, Kamli, remember the strip club?</i>

1083
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:18,243
I lost out on a chick for your jacket.

1084
01:28:18,722 --> 01:28:22,037
<i>Remember, you owed me a blonde.</i>

1085
01:28:22,436 --> 01:28:24,880
Let's say Pinky is the blonde,
and we're square!

1086
01:28:26,046 --> 01:28:28,000
<i>I'm in New York on the 22nd.</i>

1087
01:28:28,082 --> 01:28:29,920
I'll wait outside the same club.

1088
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:32,722
Wear that red jacket

1089
01:28:33,402 --> 01:28:35,568
<i>and I'll know you've forgiven me.</i>

1090
01:28:38,603 --> 01:28:40,083
Kamli, please forgive me.

1091
01:28:42,930 --> 01:28:43,772
Kamli...

1092
01:28:47,485 --> 01:28:52,931
<i>They say, "Life is what happens</i>
<i>when you're making other plans."</i>

1093
01:28:53,249 --> 01:28:57,727
<i>While he was planning his trip,</i>
<i>life had other plans.</i>

1094
01:29:18,221 --> 01:29:20,375
<i>Twelve bombs exploded that day.</i>

1095
01:29:20,454 --> 01:29:23,295
<i>250 people died. 800 were injured.</i>

1096
01:29:23,374 --> 01:29:25,781
<i>Police investigations revealed a name...</i>

1097
01:29:26,183 --> 01:29:27,461
<i>Tiger Memon.</i>

1098
01:29:28,017 --> 01:29:30,497
<i>In the riots following</i>
<i>the Babri mosque demolition,</i>

1099
01:29:30,576 --> 01:29:33,940
<i>Tiger Memon's office was burnt down.</i>
<i>He struck back.</i>

1100
01:29:34,863 --> 01:29:38,017
<i>As the truth unfolded, many were arrested.</i>

1101
01:29:39,537 --> 01:29:41,864
Kamlesh, read the news?

1102
01:29:44,107 --> 01:29:44,983
No. Why?

1103
01:29:45,062 --> 01:29:47,340
Your friend was involved
in the Bombay bomb blasts.

1104
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:49,422
He's been arrested.

1105
01:29:49,499 --> 01:29:51,788
He had an AK-56 rifle.

1106
01:29:55,624 --> 01:29:58,464
Did you possess an AK-56 rifle?

1107
01:29:58,865 --> 01:29:59,788
No, sir.

1108
01:30:07,507 --> 01:30:11,308
Did you possess an AK-56?

1109
01:30:11,709 --> 01:30:12,908
I'll tell you, sir.

1110
01:30:13,428 --> 01:30:15,108
I'll tell you everything...

1111
01:30:15,828 --> 01:30:17,394
but please don't tell dad.

1112
01:30:27,997 --> 01:30:29,831
-Babu?
-Kamli.

1113
01:30:31,272 --> 01:30:34,560
I knew you'd come.

1114
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,161
I'm glad.

1115
01:30:36,756 --> 01:30:40,553
Sir, I'm sure the AK-56 charges are bogus.

1116
01:30:44,763 --> 01:30:47,320
-Here's Sanju's confession.
-Read it.

1117
01:30:56,118 --> 01:30:59,120
Dad would send relief material
to riot victims.

1118
01:30:59,562 --> 01:31:01,007
Majority of them were Muslims.

1119
01:31:02,762 --> 01:31:04,881
Some people didn't approve.

1120
01:31:05,681 --> 01:31:07,200
They thought dad was pro-Muslim.

1121
01:31:08,809 --> 01:31:10,330
That's when the threats started...

1122
01:31:11,604 --> 01:31:14,404
to murder us and rape my sisters.

1123
01:31:15,203 --> 01:31:16,447
I was terrified.

1124
01:31:17,125 --> 01:31:20,488
Then there were two attacks on dad.

1125
01:31:20,928 --> 01:31:23,404
I requested special protection,
but was denied.

1126
01:31:24,286 --> 01:31:27,015
I feared a mob attack any time.

1127
01:31:28,409 --> 01:31:31,448
Hanif and Samir, producers of my film...

1128
01:31:32,327 --> 01:31:36,255
suggested I keep... an assault rifle,
for protection.

1129
01:31:46,052 --> 01:31:49,773
<i>In January, Samir, Hanif,</i>
<i>and Salem came home.</i>

1130
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:20,302
<i>They gave me three rifles</i>
<i>and some bullets,</i>

1131
01:32:20,381 --> 01:32:22,423
<i>which I kept in my car.</i>

1132
01:32:25,625 --> 01:32:27,150
<i>Soon, I panicked.</i>

1133
01:32:28,428 --> 01:32:32,422
I'll keep only one rifle
till the riots end.

1134
01:32:32,543 --> 01:32:34,586
Please take away the rest.

1135
01:32:35,191 --> 01:32:36,712
<i>They came back two days later.</i>

1136
01:32:37,191 --> 01:32:41,708
<i>I returned two rifles.</i>
<i>Kept one rifle and 250 bullets.</i>

1137
01:32:43,674 --> 01:32:46,909
<i>On 2nd April, I went to Mauritius</i>
<i>for a film shoot.</i>

1138
01:32:47,429 --> 01:32:50,469
<i>I got news of Hanif and Samir's arrest.</i>

1139
01:32:50,790 --> 01:32:54,513
<i>I feared they'd rat me out.</i>

1140
01:32:55,394 --> 01:32:57,390
<i>I called my friend, Yusuf Nulwala.</i>

1141
01:32:58,270 --> 01:33:01,117
Yusuf, go to my house.

1142
01:33:02,161 --> 01:33:03,753
<i>Go to my room.</i>

1143
01:33:04,315 --> 01:33:06,394
<i>You'll find a black bag.</i>

1144
01:33:09,076 --> 01:33:11,321
<i>There's some stuff in it.</i>

1145
01:33:11,718 --> 01:33:13,195
<i>Destroy it.</i>

1146
01:33:27,567 --> 01:33:29,003
<i>Then one day, dad called.</i>

1147
01:33:29,882 --> 01:33:33,401
The papers say,
you possess an AK-56 rifle.

1148
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:35,525
AK-56? No, Dad!

1149
01:33:35,686 --> 01:33:38,163
I've got you a meeting
with the Police Commissioner.

1150
01:33:38,283 --> 01:33:39,361
Come to Bombay.

1151
01:33:40,682 --> 01:33:43,725
<i>Dad informed the cops about my arrival,</i>

1152
01:33:43,970 --> 01:33:47,804
<i>and assured them he'll get me</i>
<i>to the police station.</i>

1153
01:33:47,924 --> 01:33:49,165
<i>But...</i>

1154
01:33:53,132 --> 01:33:54,253
Mr. Sanjay Dutt.

1155
01:34:01,896 --> 01:34:03,850
Deliver the luggage to his father.

1156
01:34:04,929 --> 01:34:06,009
Come with me.

1157
01:34:06,170 --> 01:34:07,930
-What's the problem, officer?
-Come.

1158
01:34:09,132 --> 01:34:10,417
Sir, what happened?

1159
01:34:12,175 --> 01:34:13,373
Get in.

1160
01:34:23,814 --> 01:34:26,776
Last time, we won the fight against drugs.

1161
01:34:27,862 --> 01:34:32,577
But this time...
the battle will be tougher.

1162
01:34:34,056 --> 01:34:37,503
-I'll need you, son.
-I'm not going anywhere, sir.

1163
01:34:38,179 --> 01:34:40,579
The "snakes" are in the "hole."

1164
01:34:41,058 --> 01:34:42,221
Grab a bite.

1165
01:34:43,741 --> 01:34:45,347
Sleep in Sanju's room.

1166
01:34:46,624 --> 01:34:48,061
I'll be here for a while.

1167
01:34:53,588 --> 01:34:54,669
Switch off the fan.

1168
01:34:55,266 --> 01:34:56,823
Sir, it's hot.

1169
01:34:58,941 --> 01:35:01,226
He sleeps without a fan, too.

1170
01:35:25,471 --> 01:35:27,277
<i>For security reasons,</i>

1171
01:35:27,358 --> 01:35:32,514
<i>Sanju was kept in isolation</i>
<i>in a windowless cell.</i>

1172
01:35:33,113 --> 01:35:36,398
<i>His only companions were ants.</i>

1173
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:39,316
It's been seven days, soldiers.

1174
01:35:39,993 --> 01:35:41,476
When will I get bail?

1175
01:35:44,921 --> 01:35:46,481
Tell me.

1176
01:35:47,719 --> 01:35:48,759
Please...

1177
01:36:08,484 --> 01:36:10,409
Sir, the pot is overflowing.

1178
01:36:11,209 --> 01:36:12,408
Sir.

1179
01:36:17,807 --> 01:36:18,727
Please help!

1180
01:36:23,247 --> 01:36:24,366
Help!

1181
01:36:32,090 --> 01:36:36,575
<i>He suffered inside prison</i>
<i>and his dad, outside.</i>

1182
01:36:39,693 --> 01:36:41,171
Look, the terrorist's pop.

1183
01:37:01,536 --> 01:37:02,422
Come.

1184
01:37:06,177 --> 01:37:07,537
Give him a shave.

1185
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:11,905
You're done.

1186
01:37:12,463 --> 01:37:14,301
Come, wash your face.

1187
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:16,461
You speak English!

1188
01:37:16,979 --> 01:37:19,908
I've done my Masters. Even had a bank job.

1189
01:37:21,066 --> 01:37:22,465
How'd you land here?

1190
01:37:23,063 --> 01:37:24,701
My wife cheated on me.

1191
01:37:25,541 --> 01:37:26,542
I killed her!

1192
01:37:27,384 --> 01:37:29,151
Chopped her into pieces,

1193
01:37:29,231 --> 01:37:33,265
stuffed her in a bag
and left it on a long distance train.

1194
01:37:34,184 --> 01:37:35,186
A porter saw me,

1195
01:37:35,628 --> 01:37:37,031
and here I am.

1196
01:37:37,553 --> 01:37:40,347
-I'll skip the shave.
-Why?

1197
01:37:40,625 --> 01:37:43,425
Need a beard for my next film.

1198
01:37:43,706 --> 01:37:46,555
I'm playing Santa Claus.
He had a big beard.

1199
01:37:46,834 --> 01:37:50,230
I've to let it grow.

1200
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:54,316
Hello! This is Sunil Dutt.

1201
01:37:55,078 --> 01:37:55,993
A moment.

1202
01:37:56,431 --> 01:37:57,632
Mr. Dutt.

1203
01:37:59,670 --> 01:38:01,314
Sir, the minister's bathing.

1204
01:38:01,752 --> 01:38:05,955
Morning, noon and evening?

1205
01:38:06,473 --> 01:38:07,673
He's always in the bath!

1206
01:38:07,753 --> 01:38:10,317
Health reasons, sir.

1207
01:38:10,717 --> 01:38:14,398
He has a fungal infection on his thigh.

1208
01:38:15,558 --> 01:38:17,317
I'll pass on your message.

1209
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:21,245
<i>Everyone avoided Mr. Dutt.</i>

1210
01:38:21,402 --> 01:38:25,675
<i>Terror charges being stigmatic,</i>
<i>no one wanted any involvement.</i>

1211
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:32,320
Partner, we've been roomies for 180 days.

1212
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:36,004
That's longer than any girl
I've been with.

1213
01:38:38,008 --> 01:38:41,604
Supreme Court will hear
my bail petition today.

1214
01:38:42,682 --> 01:38:45,166
Which means I'm a free bird.

1215
01:38:49,008 --> 01:38:50,764
I'll miss you.

1216
01:38:52,008 --> 01:38:54,973
-Your bail's been rejected.
-What?

1217
01:38:55,134 --> 01:38:58,168
Bail is always tough in the Terror Act.

1218
01:38:58,690 --> 01:39:00,126
Sir...

1219
01:39:37,985 --> 01:39:40,260
Dad, what's up with my bail?

1220
01:39:40,381 --> 01:39:44,138
Don't worry, sonny.
We're going to the Supreme Court.

1221
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:45,260
You get better.

1222
01:39:45,825 --> 01:39:48,902
Why are you lying?

1223
01:39:50,262 --> 01:39:54,268
I know my bail's rejected.
I've been in for six months.

1224
01:39:54,346 --> 01:39:57,065
You know the Prime Minister...
the President... speak to them.

1225
01:39:57,143 --> 01:40:00,865
What have I done?
Killed anyone? Fire a bullet?

1226
01:40:01,503 --> 01:40:03,310
Just kept a gun, for your protection!

1227
01:40:03,752 --> 01:40:05,108
My protection?

1228
01:40:07,065 --> 01:40:11,350
I'd rather you shot me with that gun!

1229
01:40:18,310 --> 01:40:19,470
He'll never appreciate me.

1230
01:40:21,115 --> 01:40:25,872
Praises my sisters all the time...
"Ace! Well played!"

1231
01:40:27,631 --> 01:40:29,238
I want to die.

1232
01:40:29,717 --> 01:40:30,515
Please help me.

1233
01:40:36,834 --> 01:40:38,279
There's cyanide in the tea.

1234
01:40:41,355 --> 01:40:42,236
Drink up.

1235
01:40:48,439 --> 01:40:49,678
Vodka in the tea?

1236
01:40:49,758 --> 01:40:51,996
Now chill! Don't blabber about dying.

1237
01:40:52,074 --> 01:40:53,439
Think of your dad!

1238
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,886
He strives from dawn to dusk
for your bail.

1239
01:40:56,046 --> 01:40:59,680
Begs lawyers, politicians, cops...

1240
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:03,126
Sleeps on the floor
'cause you have no bed.

1241
01:41:03,447 --> 01:41:05,603
Doesn't use the fan
'cause you don't have one.

1242
01:41:05,683 --> 01:41:09,279
People call him, "Terrorist's pop."

1243
01:41:10,242 --> 01:41:13,171
You've twisted his twins,
now spare him your suicide!

1244
01:41:13,648 --> 01:41:15,924
Fight! You'll definitely get bail.

1245
01:41:24,565 --> 01:41:25,805
Once out of prison...

1246
01:41:26,605 --> 01:41:28,489
get a sexy girlfriend.

1247
01:41:29,213 --> 01:41:32,611
I'll get you drunk and bam-bam her!

1248
01:41:33,169 --> 01:41:34,608
Then, we're even.

1249
01:41:36,450 --> 01:41:39,735
"I want to die." Enough! You're a tiger.

1250
01:41:40,331 --> 01:41:42,970
"Rorr"... come on.

1251
01:41:43,492 --> 01:41:44,852
"Rorr!"

1252
01:41:53,694 --> 01:41:55,661
<i>He spent 452 days in prison.</i>

1253
01:41:56,461 --> 01:41:58,735
<i>The Supreme Court finally</i>
<i>granted him bail.</i>

1254
01:41:59,457 --> 01:42:01,737
<i>But his name was now</i>
<i>synonymous with the word...</i>

1255
01:42:04,743 --> 01:42:07,179
<i>The public and the press hated him.</i>

1256
01:42:07,817 --> 01:42:11,381
<i>He was being tried under the Terror Act...</i>

1257
01:42:11,701 --> 01:42:13,905
<i>he feared his bail would be canceled.</i>

1258
01:42:14,701 --> 01:42:17,781
<i>His only hope was political intervention.</i>

1259
01:42:18,258 --> 01:42:22,109
<i>An influential minister in the capital</i>
<i>agreed to meet him.</i>

1260
01:42:22,507 --> 01:42:23,343
Hello, sir.

1261
01:42:24,424 --> 01:42:27,662
Come... sit.

1262
01:42:28,385 --> 01:42:29,871
How's daddy?

1263
01:42:30,509 --> 01:42:31,508
He has a fever.

1264
01:42:31,587 --> 01:42:33,304
Very good...

1265
01:42:34,663 --> 01:42:36,425
What brings you here?

1266
01:42:37,346 --> 01:42:38,633
Sir, I'll be honest.

1267
01:42:39,790 --> 01:42:40,787
I did possess a gun.

1268
01:42:41,587 --> 01:42:43,907
I should be tried under the Arms Act.

1269
01:42:44,589 --> 01:42:46,714
But they've slapped me
with the Terror Act.

1270
01:42:48,036 --> 01:42:50,831
If I was involved in the bomb blasts,

1271
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:52,430
would I return to India?

1272
01:42:52,909 --> 01:42:55,033
I could've run away from Mauritius.

1273
01:42:55,558 --> 01:42:57,315
Taken asylum in another country.

1274
01:43:06,555 --> 01:43:08,755
-He's dozed off!
-Speak louder.

1275
01:43:11,355 --> 01:43:15,077
Sir, I got a gun because
I feared a mob attack.

1276
01:43:19,798 --> 01:43:23,480
<i>If the minister really slept</i>
<i>or play acted to avoid us</i>

1277
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:25,398
<i>is still a mystery.</i>

1278
01:43:30,166 --> 01:43:31,207
How's daddy?

1279
01:43:32,842 --> 01:43:35,719
-He has a fever.
-Very good...

1280
01:43:37,403 --> 01:43:38,850
What brings you here?

1281
01:43:40,366 --> 01:43:43,323
Our legs brought us here...
we'll go back swimming.

1282
01:43:43,402 --> 01:43:45,765
Very good...

1283
01:43:45,965 --> 01:43:48,132
Let me know if I can help.

1284
01:43:48,691 --> 01:43:50,726
<i>It was evident, we were on our own.</i>

1285
01:43:51,487 --> 01:43:54,488
<i>I decided that until Sanju was cleared</i>
<i>of terror charges,</i>

1286
01:43:54,808 --> 01:43:58,127
<i>I'd be by his side. But the next day...</i>

1287
01:44:05,895 --> 01:44:06,891
Babu, where's Sanju?

1288
01:44:07,532 --> 01:44:08,732
In the preview theatre.

1289
01:44:19,092 --> 01:44:21,137
No one goes in. Mr. Dutt's orders.

1290
01:44:21,218 --> 01:44:27,054
Tell the Court, you knew about
the bomb blast conspiracy.

1291
01:44:29,738 --> 01:44:30,861
Kamlesh,

1292
01:44:31,182 --> 01:44:32,378
please wait outside.

1293
01:44:47,426 --> 01:44:48,386
Where are you going?

1294
01:44:49,185 --> 01:44:51,542
FBI raided my office.

1295
01:44:52,261 --> 01:44:53,220
Why?

1296
01:44:58,464 --> 01:45:00,585
What's that got to do with the FBI?

1297
01:45:01,781 --> 01:45:04,429
My company works with
the American government.

1298
01:45:04,753 --> 01:45:06,908
Now they'll investigate our association.

1299
01:45:07,506 --> 01:45:09,388
Terror charges freak them out.

1300
01:45:12,548 --> 01:45:13,513
Sorry, buddy.

1301
01:45:14,514 --> 01:45:16,189
I've put you through all this...

1302
01:45:17,749 --> 01:45:21,957
-Call me when you get there.
-No... my phone will be tapped.

1303
01:45:23,715 --> 01:45:25,991
We must disconnect for a few years.

1304
01:45:28,630 --> 01:45:31,518
Don't worry. I understand. Go...

1305
01:45:33,074 --> 01:45:35,194
Hey, Kamli. You're a tiger.

1306
01:45:43,317 --> 01:45:44,474
Let's go.

1307
01:45:54,478 --> 01:45:56,767
First time ever I lied to Sanju.

1308
01:45:56,845 --> 01:45:58,562
I can be friends with an addict.

1309
01:45:59,321 --> 01:46:04,846
Even with a guy who slept with my girl.
But with a terrorist? I'm no fool!

1310
01:46:07,363 --> 01:46:10,120
Every time I drink, I miss him...

1311
01:46:10,721 --> 01:46:12,083
yearn to call him.

1312
01:46:13,449 --> 01:46:15,248
Then I remind myself...

1313
01:46:16,126 --> 01:46:19,282
there was a truck full of RDX
at his house.

1314
01:46:19,363 --> 01:46:21,086
He's a bloody terrorist!

1315
01:46:23,132 --> 01:46:24,329
Are we done?

1316
01:46:28,045 --> 01:46:29,128
<i>Mail from Winnie.</i>

1317
01:46:29,649 --> 01:46:30,733
Where's she?

1318
01:46:31,774 --> 01:46:32,573
America.

1319
01:46:33,890 --> 01:46:35,009
She won't write the book.

1320
01:46:38,370 --> 01:46:40,896
<i>Sanjay Dutt was given 30 days</i>
<i>to surrender.</i>

1321
01:46:41,055 --> 01:46:42,332
<i>That time is over.</i>

1322
01:46:42,492 --> 01:46:46,572
<i>He's on his way to prison.</i>

1323
01:46:47,133 --> 01:46:48,060
<i>Clothes off.</i>

1324
01:46:49,019 --> 01:46:50,134
Raise your hands.

1325
01:46:52,854 --> 01:46:54,011
Turn.

1326
01:46:58,021 --> 01:46:58,976
Bend.

1327
01:47:01,456 --> 01:47:02,575
Cough.

1328
01:47:03,137 --> 01:47:04,259
Harder.

1329
01:47:42,148 --> 01:47:44,985
You dropped Sanju's story
for a book on museums?

1330
01:47:47,431 --> 01:47:50,912
-Museums don't lie.
-Nor did Sanju.

1331
01:47:51,271 --> 01:47:54,989
But a news report
became your gospel truth.

1332
01:47:57,478 --> 01:47:58,437
What's this?

1333
01:47:59,073 --> 01:48:02,230
Prison has a community radio
for prisoners' reform.

1334
01:48:02,630 --> 01:48:04,954
Sanju hosts a show.

1335
01:48:05,438 --> 01:48:07,755
He wants you to hear this episode.

1336
01:48:07,954 --> 01:48:09,434
Took great pains to smuggle it out.

1337
01:48:13,758 --> 01:48:14,922
My number.

1338
01:48:15,242 --> 01:48:17,158
You'll need it after you're done.

1339
01:48:30,962 --> 01:48:33,165
<i>Howdy, Yerwada!</i>

1340
01:48:33,245 --> 01:48:37,600
This is your buddy, Sanju!

1341
01:48:41,488 --> 01:48:45,803
Today's topic is "newspapers."

1342
01:48:46,444 --> 01:48:49,371
There were no newspapers 400 years ago.

1343
01:48:49,691 --> 01:48:51,407
News traveled word of mouth.

1344
01:48:51,486 --> 01:48:53,564
<i>Then, someone printed the first newspaper.</i>

1345
01:48:53,682 --> 01:48:56,890
<i>Soon, selling news became big business.</i>

1346
01:48:57,254 --> 01:49:03,529
Today, India has 105,437
registered publications,

1347
01:49:03,968 --> 01:49:06,977
thousands of radio stations,
TV channels and the internet.

1348
01:49:07,654 --> 01:49:10,092
And they're in a rat race...

1349
01:49:10,967 --> 01:49:13,011
fighting for readership.

1350
01:49:13,411 --> 01:49:16,575
More readers means more money from ads.

1351
01:49:17,615 --> 01:49:21,494
And how do you lure readers?
With the truth?

1352
01:49:22,818 --> 01:49:23,700
No.

1353
01:49:24,459 --> 01:49:27,215
With news that's spicy!

1354
01:49:28,251 --> 01:49:31,057
And how do you do that?

1355
01:49:31,623 --> 01:49:33,422
Easy! With a question mark.

1356
01:49:36,019 --> 01:49:41,783
When I was on bail,
these question marks were on my tail.

1357
01:49:41,865 --> 01:49:43,460
SANJU IN A BRAWL?

1358
01:49:48,222 --> 01:49:49,947
SANJU SOZZLED?

1359
01:49:52,944 --> 01:49:56,423
<i>Dad decided to fight back.</i>

1360
01:49:56,503 --> 01:49:59,108
Mr. Dutt, what a surprise!

1361
01:49:59,188 --> 01:50:01,144
How many pages does your paper have?

1362
01:50:02,026 --> 01:50:03,905
-Twenty four.
-Cut it down to eight.

1363
01:50:04,903 --> 01:50:07,791
Then you won't need
fake news to fill pages.

1364
01:50:08,427 --> 01:50:09,708
Please come.

1365
01:50:11,626 --> 01:50:16,671
If our reportage bothers you, sue us.

1366
01:50:18,232 --> 01:50:20,066
How can I fight you?

1367
01:50:20,148 --> 01:50:21,711
You have James Bond with you.

1368
01:50:22,551 --> 01:50:23,438
James Bond?

1369
01:50:23,518 --> 01:50:26,392
James Bond has a license to kill.

1370
01:50:26,673 --> 01:50:29,429
He has legal immunity.

1371
01:50:29,631 --> 01:50:32,199
Similarly, you have these question marks.

1372
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:35,235
In Court, you'll state,
"This isn't confirmed news."

1373
01:50:35,316 --> 01:50:38,514
"Just speculation.
Don't miss the question mark."

1374
01:50:38,595 --> 01:50:40,276
"According to sources..."

1375
01:50:43,358 --> 01:50:45,475
These are your James Bond!

1376
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:55,077
<i>Bandu Boss, I'll be there. Tell me when.</i>

1377
01:50:55,237 --> 01:50:58,207
<i>Last day of Ganesha festival.</i>

1378
01:50:58,526 --> 01:50:59,962
<i>Done.</i>

1379
01:51:02,081 --> 01:51:06,528
Your son graces events by gangsters.

1380
01:51:07,168 --> 01:51:09,965
Cops have 60 such phone taps.

1381
01:51:10,364 --> 01:51:13,722
He's not focused on work.
His last 12 films tanked.

1382
01:51:14,204 --> 01:51:19,567
His bail can be revoked.
In short, he's finished!

1383
01:51:20,122 --> 01:51:23,733
Then state that with conviction.

1384
01:51:24,813 --> 01:51:27,888
Put a full stop. Not a question mark.

1385
01:51:41,777 --> 01:51:45,651
Mr. Editor, don't write his obituary yet.

1386
01:51:45,733 --> 01:51:47,573
My son will rise again.

1387
01:51:48,172 --> 01:51:51,218
I'll prove you wrong.

1388
01:51:51,537 --> 01:51:53,616
I'm around, and so are you.

1389
01:51:53,777 --> 01:51:54,933
We'll meet again.

1390
01:52:00,337 --> 01:52:05,178
<i>A lousy editor writing me off</i>
<i>was unacceptable to dad.</i>

1391
01:52:05,737 --> 01:52:09,700
<i>He resolved to get my life back on track.</i>

1392
01:52:09,859 --> 01:52:14,058
If you hobnob with gangsters,
won't the press hound you?

1393
01:52:14,699 --> 01:52:16,066
Gangster? Who, Dad?

1394
01:52:18,420 --> 01:52:19,622
Bandu Boss.

1395
01:52:20,659 --> 01:52:22,581
Aren't you attending his event?

1396
01:52:24,308 --> 01:52:27,624
What's the option? They're dangerous.

1397
01:52:28,466 --> 01:52:29,622
Don't go.

1398
01:52:29,942 --> 01:52:32,950
They'll kill me. They shot Gulshan Kumar.

1399
01:52:33,191 --> 01:52:35,989
-Fired at Rakesh Roshan.
-Don't go, sonny.

1400
01:52:36,346 --> 01:52:39,945
If the snoopy press
ensures my safety, I won't go.

1401
01:53:00,315 --> 01:53:01,512
Why are we here, Dad?

1402
01:53:01,593 --> 01:53:04,591
When I was to marry your mom,

1403
01:53:04,793 --> 01:53:09,637
a notorious don... Mastan, got livid.

1404
01:53:10,397 --> 01:53:13,074
"Nargis is the pride
of the Muslim community."

1405
01:53:13,716 --> 01:53:16,601
"If a Hindu marries her,
we'll slaughter him."

1406
01:53:17,081 --> 01:53:19,080
I called him and said...

1407
01:53:20,198 --> 01:53:23,559
"Let's meet and talk."

1408
01:53:23,719 --> 01:53:28,322
He agreed. 1 a.m... right here.

1409
01:53:29,677 --> 01:53:32,240
-You came here alone?
-No.

1410
01:53:32,725 --> 01:53:34,566
My Master was with me.

1411
01:53:35,082 --> 01:53:37,323
-Which one?
-Sahir Ludhianvi.

1412
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:40,762
I reached an hour earlier.

1413
01:53:41,165 --> 01:53:44,644
I let Sahir's song
play in my mind on loop.

1414
01:53:45,245 --> 01:53:50,851
When the don arrived,
I said, "I love Nargis deeply."

1415
01:53:51,650 --> 01:53:53,126
"I want to marry her."

1416
01:53:53,607 --> 01:53:55,764
"And I'll keep her happy forever."

1417
01:53:56,244 --> 01:54:00,014
"If to love someone is wrong, shoot me."

1418
01:54:00,292 --> 01:54:03,290
"If right, give me a hug."

1419
01:54:03,847 --> 01:54:05,248
On our wedding day,

1420
01:54:05,609 --> 01:54:07,735
the biggest bouquet...

1421
01:54:09,093 --> 01:54:10,133
came from Mastan!

1422
01:54:12,609 --> 01:54:15,451
-What song was it, Dad?
-Will you sing it?

1423
01:54:16,457 --> 01:54:18,373
Sing along with me.

1424
01:54:20,893 --> 01:54:24,378
<i>Vicious or vile, let no power</i>

1425
01:54:24,459 --> 01:54:26,896
<i>Ever let you cower</i>

1426
01:54:27,096 --> 01:54:30,254
-Dad, not here.
-Come on, catch the beat.

1427
01:54:31,217 --> 01:54:34,742
<i>Vicious or vile, let no power</i>

1428
01:54:34,862 --> 01:54:37,620
<i>Ever let you cower</i>

1429
01:54:38,217 --> 01:54:44,941
<i>Look evil in the eye</i>
<i>Your head held high</i>

1430
01:54:45,422 --> 01:54:51,945
<i>So what if this be your last breath?</i>

1431
01:54:52,703 --> 01:54:59,149
<i>Rejoice, you never died before your death!</i>

1432
01:55:07,912 --> 01:55:13,946
Sonny, go... let Bandu Boss have it.

1433
01:55:14,347 --> 01:55:16,114
He'll never call again.

1434
01:55:16,194 --> 01:55:19,792
<i>Break</i>

1435
01:55:19,871 --> 01:55:23,589
<i>Every shackle</i>

1436
01:55:25,597 --> 01:55:31,271
<i>Smith each into</i>

1437
01:55:32,191 --> 01:55:35,555
<i>A sword</i>

1438
01:55:36,876 --> 01:55:37,877
Stop!

1439
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:43,200
Hey, the great Sanju!

1440
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:45,276
Boss, look who's here.

1441
01:55:46,796 --> 01:55:48,075
The star!

1442
01:55:48,677 --> 01:55:50,361
Welcome!

1443
01:55:51,043 --> 01:55:54,400
No calendar at home?
You're ten days early!

1444
01:55:54,478 --> 01:55:58,119
Welcome... sit.

1445
01:56:01,761 --> 01:56:04,042
May I speak in private?

1446
01:56:04,121 --> 01:56:05,240
In private?

1447
01:56:05,802 --> 01:56:07,565
They're family.

1448
01:56:08,967 --> 01:56:10,403
Close your ears.

1449
01:56:12,364 --> 01:56:16,327
We reject condoms
and eject large families.

1450
01:56:17,410 --> 01:56:19,167
Now tell me.

1451
01:56:21,685 --> 01:56:23,647
I can't attend the Ganesha festival.

1452
01:56:25,813 --> 01:56:27,328
Are you sloshed?

1453
01:56:27,727 --> 01:56:29,730
I've already announced to the world.

1454
01:56:29,848 --> 01:56:31,849
My parents are joining, too.

1455
01:56:31,968 --> 01:56:34,536
I too have a father. He disapproves.

1456
01:56:37,052 --> 01:56:39,169
He approves when you meet
the gangs in Dubai?

1457
01:56:40,210 --> 01:56:42,937
Did I have a choice? I was scared.

1458
01:56:45,133 --> 01:56:47,013
You ain't scared of me?

1459
01:56:48,091 --> 01:56:50,054
Boys, show him fear.

1460
01:57:10,901 --> 01:57:13,138
Wanna see your brains?

1461
01:57:16,181 --> 01:57:19,140
Blow them out, but first... hear me out.

1462
01:57:20,702 --> 01:57:25,550
If I attend your event,
the press will print...

1463
01:57:25,827 --> 01:57:26,948
"Sanju-Gangsters Romance."

1464
01:57:27,466 --> 01:57:31,502
If I don't attend, "Gang kills Sanju."

1465
01:57:31,741 --> 01:57:33,707
Either ways, it'll make headlines.

1466
01:57:33,908 --> 01:57:37,747
But, the second headline
won't shame my dad.

1467
01:57:38,308 --> 01:57:39,864
He'll cry gallons.

1468
01:57:40,466 --> 01:57:44,033
But when he faces the world,
his head will be held high.

1469
01:57:44,670 --> 01:57:46,311
Not bowed down in shame.

1470
01:57:48,426 --> 01:57:51,795
If this makes sense... fine.

1471
01:57:54,992 --> 01:57:56,070
If not, shoot me.

1472
01:57:59,472 --> 01:58:01,556
-Boss...
-Shut up!

1473
01:58:07,515 --> 01:58:08,840
I'll leave now.

1474
01:58:09,601 --> 01:58:11,794
If I've overstepped, I'm sorry.

1475
01:58:34,726 --> 01:58:37,601
<i>Bandu Boss never called.</i>

1476
01:58:38,646 --> 01:58:40,322
<i>But he showed up!</i>

1477
01:58:46,645 --> 01:58:48,483
It's a family tradition.

1478
01:58:48,883 --> 01:58:51,086
No murders during the Ganesha fest.

1479
01:58:51,732 --> 01:58:53,607
Decided to kill you after the fest.

1480
01:58:54,045 --> 01:58:55,969
These ten days, I only thought of you.

1481
01:58:56,527 --> 01:59:00,374
You risked life to keep
your dad's head unbowed.

1482
01:59:00,773 --> 01:59:03,731
Who does such a stupid thing?

1483
01:59:03,810 --> 01:59:06,809
Head, a few degrees up or down,
what bloody difference?

1484
01:59:09,016 --> 01:59:11,291
I prayed to the Lord for you.

1485
01:59:11,653 --> 01:59:14,012
Told him, "He's one gutsy guy."

1486
01:59:14,249 --> 01:59:17,659
"Help him. Get his charges dropped."

1487
01:59:18,059 --> 01:59:20,055
The Lord said, "Bandu Boss, done!"

1488
01:59:21,134 --> 01:59:22,293
Here are the offerings.

1489
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:27,421
Success guaranteed!

1490
01:59:27,620 --> 01:59:29,376
-Lord Ganesha...
-Glory be thine!

1491
01:59:29,498 --> 01:59:31,216
Be thine!

1492
01:59:31,935 --> 01:59:33,535
Stay in touch.

1493
01:59:33,738 --> 01:59:34,703
Let's go.

1494
01:59:40,816 --> 01:59:44,345
Get Bandu Boss teary-eyed often.

1495
01:59:44,505 --> 01:59:46,381
Free sweets will follow.

1496
01:59:47,463 --> 01:59:48,580
Sir, it's the director.

1497
01:59:52,226 --> 01:59:53,505
Yes, bro.

1498
01:59:53,585 --> 01:59:55,303
Where are you? We are ready to shoot.

1499
01:59:55,384 --> 01:59:58,584
Insane traffic on the highway.

1500
01:59:59,346 --> 02:00:01,312
A truck hit a car.

1501
02:00:03,546 --> 02:00:06,783
Hey, move that taxi.

1502
02:00:07,507 --> 02:00:08,870
Listen.

1503
02:00:09,112 --> 02:00:10,472
I've called the landline.

1504
02:00:13,829 --> 02:00:15,507
Landline's for all and sundry.

1505
02:00:15,588 --> 02:00:17,470
You're my bro, always call on my cell.

1506
02:00:17,553 --> 02:00:20,030
We missed the sunrise shot.

1507
02:00:20,431 --> 02:00:22,868
Shoot it at sunset.

1508
02:00:22,989 --> 02:00:24,870
The audience won't know shit.

1509
02:00:24,949 --> 02:00:28,073
<i>Now hang up or we'll miss the sunset.</i>

1510
02:00:29,473 --> 02:00:32,551
Time to introduce you to Master no. 2.

1511
02:00:33,794 --> 02:00:36,996
He'll teach you to respect work.

1512
02:00:37,355 --> 02:00:39,634
If you keep missing sunrise shoots,

1513
02:00:39,713 --> 02:00:42,075
the sun will set on your career.

1514
02:00:42,316 --> 02:00:45,080
Do good work and the press
will change its opinion, too.

1515
02:00:45,838 --> 02:00:47,437
Good work?

1516
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:49,116
With such trashy scripts.

1517
02:00:50,999 --> 02:00:52,365
Here...

1518
02:00:53,404 --> 02:00:56,917
Kinky King, Rowdy Romeo...

1519
02:00:57,519 --> 02:01:00,805
Munnabhai MBBS, Punky Prince...

1520
02:01:00,887 --> 02:01:02,684
Aamir and Shah Rukh grab the best.

1521
02:01:03,043 --> 02:01:06,800
-Do you read these scripts?
-Cover to cover.

1522
02:01:06,919 --> 02:01:09,728
All read and rejected.

1523
02:01:10,168 --> 02:01:12,844
"Munnabhai MBBS." Read this one?

1524
02:01:12,964 --> 02:01:15,283
-I did.
-What's the story?

1525
02:01:17,688 --> 02:01:19,052
It's trash!

1526
02:01:20,487 --> 02:01:22,764
There's a hospital...

1527
02:01:22,884 --> 02:01:27,132
where a patient gets murdered...
every day!

1528
02:01:27,693 --> 02:01:31,407
Then kidneys are stolen.
It's a horror story.

1529
02:01:31,647 --> 02:01:33,170
I need a family film.

1530
02:01:33,448 --> 02:01:36,693
The draft I read has no murders.

1531
02:01:37,850 --> 02:01:42,851
-Why did you read it?
-I'm playing your father in this film.

1532
02:01:43,411 --> 02:01:46,773
I'll set up Master no. 2 in your car.

1533
02:01:46,854 --> 02:01:50,533
Listen to the song on loop at full volume.

1534
02:01:58,092 --> 02:02:00,900
<i>If you shirk from work</i>

1535
02:02:03,339 --> 02:02:06,257
<i>You get no perk, you jerk</i>

1536
02:02:06,336 --> 02:02:08,017
Turn it off!

1537
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:10,864
It's Mr. Dutt's order to play this song
the whole month.

1538
02:02:10,944 --> 02:02:14,300
And check that you lip sync.

1539
02:02:20,503 --> 02:02:22,625
<i>If you shirk from work</i>

1540
02:02:22,704 --> 02:02:24,020
I am singing.

1541
02:02:25,181 --> 02:02:27,749
<i>You get no perk, you jerk</i>

1542
02:02:28,187 --> 02:02:30,663
<i>If duties you duck</i>
<i>You land up in muck</i>

1543
02:02:30,944 --> 02:02:33,505
<i>On bankruptcy's brink</i>
<i>Not a dime for a drink</i>

1544
02:02:33,666 --> 02:02:36,553
<i>Toil hard buddy</i>
<i>Listen to your daddy...</i>

1545
02:02:36,990 --> 02:02:38,866
-Lip sync fine?
-Yes.

1546
02:02:38,946 --> 02:02:41,705
Report to dad. Bloody snitch!

1547
02:02:45,233 --> 02:02:48,149
<i>Dad signed this film after a 12 year gap</i>

1548
02:02:48,311 --> 02:02:50,669
<i>just to discipline me.</i>

1549
02:02:50,790 --> 02:02:55,113
Must an ER patient fill an admit form?

1550
02:02:59,792 --> 02:03:01,677
<i>He was always punctual on the sets.</i>

1551
02:03:01,836 --> 02:03:04,032
-Has the hero arrived?
-Yes, sir.

1552
02:03:04,593 --> 02:03:07,593
<i>So I too, had to be on time.</i>

1553
02:03:10,721 --> 02:03:12,836
Shall we rehearse?

1554
02:03:18,882 --> 02:03:20,321
Just for the shot, Dad!

1555
02:03:21,559 --> 02:03:24,075
Hey, pal. No fear, I'm here.

1556
02:03:26,319 --> 02:03:30,120
You lied to me shamelessly for ten years.

1557
02:03:35,401 --> 02:03:39,601
"Now that your father's proud,
why'd you fret?"

1558
02:03:39,804 --> 02:03:43,124
That's my dialogue.
I'm playing the father.

1559
02:03:43,644 --> 02:03:45,450
But, Father...
I couldn't become a doctor."

1560
02:03:45,529 --> 02:03:46,407
Again.

1561
02:03:46,924 --> 02:03:50,321
You lied to me shamelessly for 10 years.

1562
02:03:50,842 --> 02:03:54,492
Now that your father's proud,
why'd you fret?

1563
02:03:54,650 --> 02:03:55,607
Once again?

1564
02:03:55,769 --> 02:03:59,406
<i>Prison time was easier than this.</i>

1565
02:03:59,527 --> 02:04:01,654
<i>Dad's discipline roasted me.</i>

1566
02:04:02,615 --> 02:04:06,289
<i>But, I won't ever forget</i>
<i>that "magic hug" scene.</i>

1567
02:04:06,527 --> 02:04:08,732
Your mom gets a thousand hugs.

1568
02:04:10,256 --> 02:04:12,095
Spare one for dad.

1569
02:04:17,213 --> 02:04:20,377
<i>Neither of us heard it</i>
<i>when the director called, "Cut!"</i>

1570
02:04:20,655 --> 02:04:22,495
<i>We were weeping.</i>

1571
02:04:22,855 --> 02:04:25,454
<i>It was a lifetime since we had hugged.</i>

1572
02:04:33,694 --> 02:04:35,860
...Sanjay Dutt for "Munnabhai MBBS."

1573
02:04:40,542 --> 02:04:41,536
Go on, sonny.

1574
02:04:55,066 --> 02:04:58,023
Mr. Dutt, didn't I tell you
that Sanju will be back!

1575
02:04:58,383 --> 02:05:00,546
Really? Did you?

1576
02:05:00,625 --> 02:05:01,827
Didn't I?

1577
02:05:02,910 --> 02:05:05,506
-I told... someone.
-Who?

1578
02:05:05,665 --> 02:05:07,502
Our Associate Editor.

1579
02:05:07,742 --> 02:05:10,027
Told him to print, "Sanju will be back."

1580
02:05:10,107 --> 02:05:12,350
He must've forgotten.

1581
02:05:12,590 --> 02:05:15,746
Make it tomorrow's headline...
"Sanjay Dutt is back."

1582
02:05:18,348 --> 02:05:20,434
Without a question mark.

1583
02:05:29,117 --> 02:05:30,714
Look, Munnabhai's pop!

1584
02:05:39,356 --> 02:05:40,878
<i>Look, the terrorist's pop!</i>

1585
02:05:44,758 --> 02:05:45,761
What happened, Dad?

1586
02:05:45,843 --> 02:05:50,515
It's the second time
you've made me cry with joy.

1587
02:05:51,796 --> 02:05:56,079
<i>The first time dad cried with joy</i>
<i>was in our preview theater.</i>

1588
02:05:56,439 --> 02:06:00,599
<i>That day a headline read,</i>
<i>"RDX truck at Dutt house."</i>

1589
02:06:12,167 --> 02:06:17,524
<i>Tell the judge that you knew about</i>
<i>the bomb blast conspiracy.</i>

1590
02:06:23,687 --> 02:06:28,132
<i>The first time dad cried with joy</i>
<i>was in our preview theater.</i>

1591
02:06:28,373 --> 02:06:32,412
<i>That day a headline read,</i>
<i>"RDX truck at Dutt house."</i>

1592
02:06:32,729 --> 02:06:35,249
<i>But that's another episode.</i>

1593
02:06:35,448 --> 02:06:36,654
<i>I'll save it for another day.</i>

1594
02:06:36,895 --> 02:06:39,092
<i>Let's get back to dad.</i>

1595
02:06:39,211 --> 02:06:41,529
<i>I got another chance to make dad happy.</i>

1596
02:06:43,410 --> 02:06:45,817
<i>Dad was being honored</i>
<i>at a Consulate dinner.</i>

1597
02:06:47,056 --> 02:06:49,577
You guys never praise me.

1598
02:06:49,935 --> 02:06:52,013
So, here I am as chief guest.

1599
02:06:52,213 --> 02:06:56,336
<i>Dad was unaware, his son would</i>
<i>sing his praises tonight!</i>

1600
02:06:56,416 --> 02:07:00,254
<i>I was to make the introduction speech.</i>

1601
02:07:11,743 --> 02:07:12,862
Dad, I'll be back.

1602
02:07:14,140 --> 02:07:16,139
Sir, there's a minor problem.

1603
02:07:16,340 --> 02:07:20,147
Today's headline said, "Blast suspect
to attend diplomatic event."

1604
02:07:21,028 --> 02:07:25,180
The Embassy wanted you off the guest list.

1605
02:07:25,619 --> 02:07:28,669
We said, "That would be rude."

1606
02:07:29,310 --> 02:07:32,106
"We'll seat him away from the diplomats."

1607
02:07:44,508 --> 02:07:46,595
My speech... When's that?

1608
02:08:06,674 --> 02:08:09,191
Sonny, what's the problem?

1609
02:08:10,355 --> 02:08:13,957
I'm right here. Read out your speech.

1610
02:08:16,355 --> 02:08:17,795
I wanted everyone to hear it.

1611
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:25,876
Learn to ignore such people.

1612
02:08:26,557 --> 02:08:32,479
Time for Master no. 3.
I'll set the song in your car.

1613
02:08:33,044 --> 02:08:34,038
Anand Bakshi.

1614
02:08:34,119 --> 02:08:38,528
He'll teach you to deal with humiliation.
Okay?

1615
02:08:41,003 --> 02:08:43,279
Sanju...

1616
02:08:48,485 --> 02:08:52,283
Hey, pal. No fear, I'm here!

1617
02:08:54,005 --> 02:08:55,051
Go, sleep.

1618
02:09:00,085 --> 02:09:02,890
<i>Wish I'd read him the speech,</i>

1619
02:09:03,374 --> 02:09:05,850
<i>for... the next morning,</i>
<i>he didn't wake up.</i>

1620
02:10:14,271 --> 02:10:16,069
<i>If life had a rewind button...</i>

1621
02:10:16,748 --> 02:10:19,831
<i>I'd go back and read him the speech!</i>

1622
02:10:26,389 --> 02:10:30,717
Today, I'll try the impossible...
an attempt to thank dad.

1623
02:10:31,154 --> 02:10:34,191
In the past, I never found the words.

1624
02:10:34,271 --> 02:10:38,880
To define what dad's done for me...
every word fell short.

1625
02:10:45,678 --> 02:10:47,522
<i>...a wife dying in the hospital,</i>

1626
02:10:48,082 --> 02:10:50,277
<i>a son destroyed by drugs.</i>

1627
02:10:50,758 --> 02:10:53,037
<i>Dad fought all alone.</i>

1628
02:10:53,477 --> 02:10:55,763
He's the reason I'm alive.

1629
02:10:57,642 --> 02:11:01,238
Tried to thank him then
but couldn't find the words.

1630
02:11:01,599 --> 02:11:04,125
<i>Dad walked long peace marches…</i>

1631
02:11:04,687 --> 02:11:07,403
<i>from Hiroshima to Nagasaki...</i>
<i>Mumbai to Amritsar.</i>

1632
02:11:08,284 --> 02:11:10,842
<i>But none wore off his shoes as much as</i>

1633
02:11:11,282 --> 02:11:13,328
the jostle between courts and cops.

1634
02:11:14,086 --> 02:11:16,966
<i>Legal costs forced dad to sell his house.</i>

1635
02:11:17,124 --> 02:11:19,003
<i>Not once did he complain!</i>

1636
02:11:19,645 --> 02:11:25,169
Wanted to thank him then
but couldn't find the words.

1637
02:11:26,086 --> 02:11:30,372
Now, after a lifetime,
I've found the words.

1638
02:11:34,768 --> 02:11:38,854
You deserved a better son, Dad.

1639
02:11:39,774 --> 02:11:43,131
<i>One who'd support you... not be a burden.</i>

1640
02:11:44,047 --> 02:11:47,097
<i>One known for his honesty,</i>
<i>not his travesties.</i>

1641
02:11:47,658 --> 02:11:50,575
One more like you and less like me.

1642
02:11:56,901 --> 02:11:59,978
That son would've never loved you as much

1643
02:12:00,058 --> 02:12:02,216
as this no-good sonny does!

1644
02:12:02,737 --> 02:12:04,101
<i>I could never say it, but...</i>

1645
02:12:07,578 --> 02:12:08,936
You're my strength,

1646
02:12:09,697 --> 02:12:10,897
<i>my solace,</i>

1647
02:12:11,740 --> 02:12:13,024
my pride.

1648
02:12:13,104 --> 02:12:14,543
You're my world, Dad.

1649
02:12:19,098 --> 02:12:20,303
Love you, sonny.

1650
02:12:30,069 --> 02:12:32,425
<i>Had dad lived another year,</i>

1651
02:12:32,505 --> 02:12:35,542
<i>he'd have witnessed what he yearned for.</i>

1652
02:12:39,590 --> 02:12:42,468
...I do not find you to be a terrorist.

1653
02:12:47,432 --> 02:12:49,271
<i>I was acquitted from the Terror Act.</i>

1654
02:12:49,631 --> 02:12:53,547
<i>I got six years under the Arms Act.</i>

1655
02:12:53,869 --> 02:12:56,755
<i>The judge clearly said</i>
<i>I was not a terrorist.</i>

1656
02:12:57,393 --> 02:12:58,591
<i>But the next morning,</i>

1657
02:12:58,752 --> 02:13:02,190
<i>no headline read "Dutt not a terrorist."</i>

1658
02:13:04,357 --> 02:13:08,516
<i>All said, "Dutt gets</i>
<i>six years in the blast case."</i>

1659
02:13:11,114 --> 02:13:13,280
Till date, I'm branded a terrorist.

1660
02:13:19,155 --> 02:13:23,801
Master no. 3 was to teach me
to deal with insults.

1661
02:13:25,358 --> 02:13:29,400
But with dad's death,
that song remains a mystery.

1662
02:13:30,122 --> 02:13:34,805
If you can crack that song, do tell.

1663
02:13:35,281 --> 02:13:39,367
Until tomorrow,
Sanju says, "Adios, amigos."

1664
02:13:54,403 --> 02:13:55,929
I want to meet Sanju.

1665
02:14:15,494 --> 02:14:16,613
How are you?

1666
02:14:16,853 --> 02:14:19,251
They don't let me step out,
the rest is fine.

1667
02:14:19,371 --> 02:14:23,340
Yeah. Sticklers for rules!
Weren't letting me in, either.

1668
02:14:23,816 --> 02:14:25,734
Missing me? Boyfriend vamoosed?

1669
02:14:28,173 --> 02:14:29,617
I'm no Pinky.

1670
02:14:31,620 --> 02:14:34,219
-You met Kamli?
-Yes.

1671
02:14:34,298 --> 02:14:35,935
In your recording, you say...

1672
02:14:36,655 --> 02:14:42,059
on the day the RDX news appeared,
your dad cried with joy.

1673
02:14:42,140 --> 02:14:43,301
Yes.

1674
02:14:43,382 --> 02:14:44,738
Kamlesh has a different version.

1675
02:14:44,817 --> 02:14:47,218
When he came to the preview theater,

1676
02:14:47,664 --> 02:14:50,982
your dad was urging you
to confess in court

1677
02:14:51,143 --> 02:14:53,860
that you knew about
the bomb blasts conspiracy.

1678
02:15:00,666 --> 02:15:01,702
The moron!

1679
02:15:03,063 --> 02:15:04,106
Get Kamli here.

1680
02:15:05,430 --> 02:15:08,827
-Tell me about it.
-No. I'll tell him directly.

1681
02:15:08,909 --> 02:15:11,547
It's hard to get permission.

1682
02:15:15,391 --> 02:15:17,911
Remember this number, 88.0.

1683
02:15:18,152 --> 02:15:19,826
-What's that?
-A radio frequency.

1684
02:15:19,905 --> 02:15:22,031
There's an FM mic in our studio.

1685
02:15:22,555 --> 02:15:27,708
Park close to the prison walls
and tune in.

1686
02:15:30,755 --> 02:15:31,837
Kamlesh won't come.

1687
02:15:33,352 --> 02:15:38,235
Tell him... 6th June. He won't refuse.

1688
02:15:41,278 --> 02:15:45,195
It's his dad's birthday.
Bloody emotional blackmailer!

1689
02:15:45,715 --> 02:15:46,798
Will you come?

1690
02:16:19,963 --> 02:16:21,966
<i>Howdy, Yerwada!</i>

1691
02:16:22,085 --> 02:16:26,007
<i>This is your buddy, Sanju!</i>

1692
02:16:29,367 --> 02:16:32,214
Today's topic is "friendship."

1693
02:16:32,615 --> 02:16:34,650
My best friend was Kamli.

1694
02:16:35,532 --> 02:16:39,290
Great guy. But fell prey to drugs.

1695
02:16:40,136 --> 02:16:42,931
<i>No... not the psychotropic drugs.</i>

1696
02:16:43,332 --> 02:16:49,658
But the ones that are slid
under our doors, daily.

1697
02:16:50,454 --> 02:16:52,536
<i>We have them with our morning tea.</i>

1698
02:16:53,016 --> 02:16:56,217
Drugs called "News."

1699
02:16:57,060 --> 02:16:58,777
<i>These drugs are sold on TV too.</i>

1700
02:16:59,097 --> 02:17:03,295
Haven't you heard those
cacophonous debates

1701
02:17:03,577 --> 02:17:05,781
that numb our minds?

1702
02:17:06,502 --> 02:17:09,540
Courts take years
to just understand a case.

1703
02:17:09,741 --> 02:17:13,222
But these panelists
pass verdicts in an hour.

1704
02:17:13,822 --> 02:17:15,627
Back then, a headline said...

1705
02:17:21,060 --> 02:17:22,866
<i>It was fake news.</i>

1706
02:17:22,945 --> 02:17:26,463
No cop, no prosecutor,
no witness ever said

1707
02:17:26,543 --> 02:17:28,582
there was a truck with RDX at my house.

1708
02:17:29,181 --> 02:17:30,306
<i>So, why this headline?</i>

1709
02:17:30,625 --> 02:17:35,387
During riots, a truck with relief material
was parked at our house.

1710
02:17:37,303 --> 02:17:39,585
<i>Some jerk spread a rumor it had RDX.</i>

1711
02:17:39,667 --> 02:17:42,549
And a journo printed this spicy news.

1712
02:17:42,628 --> 02:17:45,707
Read my Supreme Court judgment.

1713
02:17:45,986 --> 02:17:48,271
I was never accused of possessing RDX!

1714
02:17:50,036 --> 02:17:54,148
But which journo bothers with facts?

1715
02:17:54,390 --> 02:17:57,154
All they want is "Breaking News!"

1716
02:17:59,674 --> 02:18:01,394
This headline worked like a drug.

1717
02:18:02,390 --> 02:18:05,114
In Kamli's head,
I morphed into a terrorist.

1718
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:09,915
He put a full-stop to our friendship.

1719
02:18:10,913 --> 02:18:14,397
Didn't even notice
that the headline had a question mark!

1720
02:18:24,565 --> 02:18:26,719
<i>This news shattered dad.</i>

1721
02:18:27,119 --> 02:18:30,119
In desperation, he brought in a lawyer.

1722
02:18:31,442 --> 02:18:34,044
-What's this?
-Your ticket to freedom.

1723
02:18:34,321 --> 02:18:36,166
Sign and turn approver.

1724
02:18:36,244 --> 02:18:38,402
-Approver?
-Government witness.

1725
02:18:40,927 --> 02:18:45,481
Tell the Court, you knew about
the bomb blast conspiracy.

1726
02:18:47,203 --> 02:18:49,489
Kamlesh, please wait outside.

1727
02:18:53,687 --> 02:18:57,449
-I knew nothing about the bomb blasts.
-But tell the Court that you knew.

1728
02:18:57,811 --> 02:19:00,688
Tell them who got the RDX,
who made the bombs,

1729
02:19:01,088 --> 02:19:02,410
and who planted them.

1730
02:19:02,490 --> 02:19:06,253
-I know nothing!
-I'll give you the names.

1731
02:19:06,574 --> 02:19:09,650
You help the State with missing links.

1732
02:19:09,730 --> 02:19:14,412
In return, the State
will let you go scot-free.

1733
02:19:15,497 --> 02:19:18,854
-I'll be branded a terrorist.
-You're already branded.

1734
02:19:18,934 --> 02:19:21,573
It's a lie, a sign will make it the truth.

1735
02:19:22,574 --> 02:19:24,619
The country will spit on me.

1736
02:19:25,417 --> 02:19:26,814
Leave the country.

1737
02:19:27,134 --> 02:19:28,653
London, Kenya... Pick a place.

1738
02:19:29,772 --> 02:19:34,538
And dad? My sisters? Dad, heard that?

1739
02:19:34,617 --> 02:19:37,778
Don't worry about us. Leave the country.

1740
02:19:43,298 --> 02:19:46,780
Sir, I don't have a law degree.

1741
02:19:47,500 --> 02:19:49,269
In fact, I'm a college dropout.

1742
02:19:49,510 --> 02:19:52,348
But I know, this is rotten advice.

1743
02:19:52,990 --> 02:19:56,078
I brand him "Terrorist's pop"
and run away?

1744
02:19:56,676 --> 02:19:58,232
People will hate dad.

1745
02:19:58,432 --> 02:20:01,716
His life's work, respect...
All down the drain!

1746
02:20:01,800 --> 02:20:04,194
-Listen to me...
-You listen to me.

1747
02:20:04,274 --> 02:20:07,394
Get lost!
You might be a great lawyer,

1748
02:20:07,474 --> 02:20:11,036
but with a broken nose,
you'll look like a clown.

1749
02:20:17,682 --> 02:20:20,076
You're going to pay for this.

1750
02:20:34,003 --> 02:20:35,125
What happened, Dad?

1751
02:20:36,407 --> 02:20:37,757
Ace, sonny!

1752
02:20:47,294 --> 02:20:49,768
<i>For the first time,</i>
<i>my father cried with joy.</i>

1753
02:20:50,526 --> 02:20:52,132
That day, I was his hero.

1754
02:20:54,250 --> 02:20:56,848
The same day,
I turned villain for my friend.

1755
02:20:57,846 --> 02:21:01,728
Hey, Kamli. Hope you can hear me.

1756
02:21:03,210 --> 02:21:04,734
When I come out...

1757
02:21:06,450 --> 02:21:08,173
meet me once, buddy.

1758
02:21:09,892 --> 02:21:11,610
If you do, I'll be happy.

1759
02:21:13,250 --> 02:21:16,534
If you don't,
I'll live with your fond memories.

1760
02:21:19,016 --> 02:21:24,178
I'll remember, the first nude girl
my friend saw was 91.

1761
02:21:27,018 --> 02:21:30,578
I'll remember, he perked me up
with vodka-infused tea.

1762
02:21:32,698 --> 02:21:38,464
And to meet me, he bought an air-ticket
with the pennies saved for his first car.

1763
02:21:40,624 --> 02:21:43,746
Hey, Kamli. We're getting old, bro.

1764
02:21:45,982 --> 02:21:47,783
Give me one last hug.

1765
02:21:55,466 --> 02:21:59,103
Tiger, this one's for you.

1766
02:21:59,502 --> 02:22:03,700
<i>On the pathway of time,</i>
<i>At this bend</i>

1767
02:22:04,062 --> 02:22:08,108
<i>I am glad I met such a friend</i>

1768
02:22:08,706 --> 02:22:12,710
<i>Scars are healed</i>
<i>And sorrows end</i>

1769
02:22:12,788 --> 02:22:17,028
<i>Just at the thought</i>
<i>I have such a friend</i>

1770
02:22:17,110 --> 02:22:21,306
<i>On the pathway of time,</i>
<i>At this bend</i>

1771
02:22:21,548 --> 02:22:25,592
<i>I am lucky to find such a friend</i>

1772
02:23:12,849 --> 02:23:14,244
Sanju, take care.

1773
02:23:34,770 --> 02:23:36,813
Sanju! Here...

1774
02:23:37,255 --> 02:23:40,571
A picture, please!

1775
02:23:49,693 --> 02:23:50,652
<i>Sanju!</i>

1776
02:24:40,189 --> 02:24:41,108
Did you marry?

1777
02:24:42,267 --> 02:24:43,389
Opened your account?

1778
02:24:46,834 --> 02:24:49,108
Bam-bam without marriage?

1779
02:24:49,470 --> 02:24:52,990
At 80, we'll go to the holy river
to wash our sins.

1780
02:24:53,070 --> 02:24:55,717
If I don't sin, what'll I wash?
My underwear?

1781
02:24:59,152 --> 02:25:00,833
One pic, please!

1782
02:25:02,995 --> 02:25:04,718
Look here.

1783
02:25:12,481 --> 02:25:13,361
The book?

1784
02:25:15,438 --> 02:25:17,317
Master no. 3's song...

1785
02:25:19,802 --> 02:25:21,163
Named the book the same.

1786
02:25:22,203 --> 02:25:23,241
I've cracked it, too.

1787
02:25:24,839 --> 02:25:26,919
Really? Which song?

1788
02:25:26,999 --> 02:25:31,047
Hey, terrorist! Give me a bloody pic!

1789
02:25:35,282 --> 02:25:37,288
<i>Let them talk</i>

1790
02:25:37,485 --> 02:25:38,927
<i>Let them mock</i>

1791
02:25:39,409 --> 02:25:41,485
<i>The path beckons</i>

1792
02:25:41,563 --> 02:25:43,844
<i>You just walk</i>

1793
02:25:45,002 --> 02:25:45,849
Let's go, Kamli.

1794
02:25:48,888 --> 02:25:53,165
<i>Let them talk</i>

1795
02:25:53,889 --> 02:25:56,611
<i>Let them mock</i>

1796
02:25:59,209 --> 02:26:04,176
<i>The path beckons</i>

1797
02:26:04,454 --> 02:26:09,290
<i>You just walk</i>

1798
02:26:16,252 --> 02:26:17,453
Papa, what's this?

1799
02:26:19,093 --> 02:26:22,419
A story of two dads.

1800
02:26:22,978 --> 02:26:25,453
Your dad and my dad.

1801
02:26:26,373 --> 02:26:27,975
Read it someday.

1802
02:26:28,295 --> 02:26:31,421
And be like my dad, not like your dad.

1803
02:26:34,738 --> 02:26:36,941
Your son resembles your dad.

1804
02:26:37,021 --> 02:26:38,704
It's him, reincarnated.

1805
02:26:44,100 --> 02:26:45,299
Just kidding.
