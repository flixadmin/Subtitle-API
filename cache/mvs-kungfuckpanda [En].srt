1
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:50,285
Legend tells of a legendary warrior,

2
00:00:50,286 --> 00:00:53,497
whose kung fu skills
were the stuff of legend.

3
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:58,440
He travelled the land
in search of worthy foes.

4
00:01:09,033 --> 00:01:10,701
I see you like to chew.

5
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:13,934
Maybe you should chew on my fist.

6
00:01:14,538 --> 00:01:18,270
The warrior said anything
for his mouth was full.

7
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:20,419
Then he swallowed.

8
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:24,235
And then he spoke.
Enough talk. Let's fight.

9
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:31,513
He was so deadly in fact,
that his enemies will go blind,

10
00:01:31,514 --> 00:01:34,161
from over exposure to pure
awesomeness.

11
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:36,248
My eyes!
He's too awesome!

12
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:38,978
And attractive.
How can we re-pay you?

13
00:01:39,814 --> 00:01:42,106
There is no charge for awesomeness.

14
00:01:42,357 --> 00:01:44,338
Or attractiveness.

15
00:01:46,715 --> 00:01:51,845
It mattered not how many foes he faced.
They were no match for his voracity.

16
00:02:04,461 --> 00:02:08,611
Never before had a panda
been so feared, and so loved.

17
00:02:09,883 --> 00:02:12,594
Even the most heroic heroes
in all of China,

18
00:02:12,595 --> 00:02:17,974
The Furious Five.
Bowed in respect to this great master.

19
00:02:18,224 --> 00:02:19,976
We should hang out.

20
00:02:19,977 --> 00:02:21,915
Agreed.

21
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:25,961
But hanging out would
have to wait.

22
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:30,027
Cause when you're facing the ten
thousand demons of demon mountain.

23
00:02:30,486 --> 00:02:34,281
There is only one thing
that matters and that’s...

24
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:36,992
Get up!
You'll be late for work.

25
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:47,502
Po...
Get up!

26
00:03:02,204 --> 00:03:05,457
Hey, Po.
What are you doing up there?

27
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:07,479
Ahh.. nothing.

28
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:15,696
Monkey, Mantis, Crane, Viper,
Tigress ... Roarrrr!

29
00:03:15,801 --> 00:03:17,365
Ahh...

30
00:03:20,888 --> 00:03:23,808
Po. Let's go.
You're late for work.

31
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,872
Coming!

32
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:36,902
Sorry Dad.

33
00:03:36,903 --> 00:03:39,802
Sorry, doesn't make the Noodles.

34
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:42,283
What were you doing up there?
All that noise?

35
00:03:42,285 --> 00:03:45,057
Oh...nothing.
Just had a crazy dream.

36
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,997
About what? Uh?
What were you dreaming about?

37
00:03:47,998 --> 00:03:49,707
What was I...aah...

38
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,648
... I was dreaming about a...

39
00:03:54,378 --> 00:03:55,838
Noodles.

40
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:59,570
Noodles?
You were really dreaming about noodles?

41
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:02,052
Uhh... Ya,
what else would I be dreaming about?

42
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:04,596
Oh, careful.
That soup is - sharp!

43
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:10,018
Oh... happy day.
My son finally having the noodle dream.

44
00:04:11,311 --> 00:04:15,378
You don't know how long
I have been waiting for this moment.

45
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:17,421
This is a sign, Po.

46
00:04:17,463 --> 00:04:19,590
Uh... a sign of what?

47
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:23,667
You are almost ready to be
entrusted with the secret ingredient,

48
00:04:23,668 --> 00:04:26,409
... of my secret ingredient soup.

49
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,442
And then you will fulfill your destiny
and take over the restaurant.

50
00:04:31,547 --> 00:04:34,969
Just as I took over from my father
who took over from his father.

51
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,473
who won it from a friend
over a game of mahjong.

52
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:40,130
Dad, dad, dad.
It was just a dream.

53
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:42,853
No, it was the Dream.

54
00:04:42,854 --> 00:04:46,261
Wu Xiang noodles.
Po, broth runs through our veins.

55
00:04:46,543 --> 00:04:50,479
But Dad, didn't you ever
wanted to do something else?

56
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,329
Something, beside noodles.

57
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,307
Actually, when I was young
and crazy.

58
00:04:55,308 --> 00:04:59,420
I thought of running away
and learning how to make tofu.

59
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:00,853
So why didn't you?

60
00:05:00,854 --> 00:05:03,079
Oh, because it was
a stupid dream.

61
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,093
Can you imagine me making tofu?

62
00:05:06,094 --> 00:05:08,595
Ha, ha, ha. Tofu!

63
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:12,536
No, we all have our place
in this world.

64
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:16,531
My is here and yours is...
... I know "is here".

65
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:19,866
No, it’s tables 2, 5 ,7 and 12.

66
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:22,353
Service with a smile.

67
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:53,157
Well done, students...

68
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:55,223
... if you were trying
to disappoint me.

69
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:58,413
Tigress, you need more ferocity.
Monkey greater speed.

70
00:05:58,414 --> 00:06:01,353
Crane, height. Viper, subtlety.
Mantis... Master Shifu...

71
00:06:01,354 --> 00:06:03,210
Master Shifu... What?

72
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:06,567
It...its Master Oogway,
he wants to see you.

73
00:06:16,722 --> 00:06:21,060
Master Oogway, you summoned me?
Is something wrong?

74
00:06:26,482 --> 00:06:31,466
Why must something be wrong
for me to want to see my old friend?

75
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:36,866
So, nothing is wrong?
Well, I didn't say that.

76
00:06:54,008 --> 00:06:55,718
You were saying?

77
00:06:56,072 --> 00:06:58,387
I have had a vision.

78
00:06:58,388 --> 00:07:01,974
Tai Lung will return.

79
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,314
That is impossible.
He's in prison.

80
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,192
Nothing is impossible.

81
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:16,874
Zeng, fly to Chordom Prison.
Tell them to double the guards,

82
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,428
Double the weapons.
Double everything.

83
00:07:19,429 --> 00:07:21,263
Tai Lung does not leave
that prison.

84
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:23,119
Yes, Master Shifu.

85
00:07:24,954 --> 00:07:29,876
One often meets his destiny on
the road he takes to avoid it.

86
00:07:29,897 --> 00:07:32,691
We have to do something. We can't
just have him march in the valley.

87
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:34,818
And take his revenge.
He'll, he'll...

88
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:38,941
Your mind is like this water
my friend. When it is agitated...

89
00:07:38,943 --> 00:07:41,574
... it becomes difficult to see.

90
00:07:41,575 --> 00:07:48,143
But if you allow it to settle,
the answer becomes clear.

91
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:52,564
The Dragon's scroll.

92
00:07:52,814 --> 00:07:55,525
It is time.
But who?

93
00:07:55,526 --> 00:07:59,320
Who is worthy to be trusted
with the secret to limitless power?

94
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:03,324
To become the Dragon Warrior.

95
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:06,202
I don't know.

96
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:09,236
Excuse me. Sorry.

97
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:11,551
Oo...oo sorry.
Hey, watch it Po.

98
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:14,658
Sorry.
Aah... Oop!

99
00:08:14,763 --> 00:08:17,317
Sorry, a thousand pardon.

100
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:19,298
What?

101
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:23,364
Master Oogway is choosing
a Dragon Warrior, today.

102
00:08:23,365 --> 00:08:26,127
Everyone, everyone, go!
Get to the Jade Palace!

103
00:08:26,128 --> 00:08:28,348
One of the five is going
to get the Dragon's Scroll.

104
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:31,445
We have been waiting a thousand
years for this. Just take the bowl!

105
00:08:31,705 --> 00:08:35,198
This is the greatest day in Kung Fu
history! Don't worry about it. Just go!

106
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:37,669
Po! Where are you going?

107
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,620
To the Jade Palace.

108
00:08:40,776 --> 00:08:43,279
But you're forgetting your noodle cart.

109
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,710
The whole valley will be there and
you will sell noodle to all of them.

110
00:08:47,711 --> 00:08:50,306
Selling noodles?

111
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:54,102
But Dad. You know I was kind
of thinking, maybe I...

112
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:56,923
Ya?
I was kind of thinking, maybe I...

113
00:08:56,924 --> 00:08:58,697
Ahh...Haa..?

114
00:09:00,337 --> 00:09:05,175
Could also sell the bean buns.
They're about to go bad.

115
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:08,897
That's my boy!
I told you that dream was a sign.

116
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:12,067
Ya...
I'm glad I had it.

117
00:09:58,142 --> 00:09:59,685
Almost there.

118
00:10:00,123 --> 00:10:02,417
What?
No!

119
00:10:02,626 --> 00:10:05,232
No! No!

120
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:09,861
Sorry Po.
We'll bring you back a souvenir.

121
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,744
No, I'll bring you back a souvenir.

122
00:10:22,978 --> 00:10:26,325
It's a historic day.
Isn't it Master Oogway?

123
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:31,267
Yes. The one I feared
I would not live to see.

124
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:35,511
Are your students ready?
Yes, Master Oogway.

125
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:38,091
Now know this old friend...

126
00:10:38,093 --> 00:10:45,687
Whomever I chose will not only bring
peace to the valley, but also to you.

127
00:10:50,128 --> 00:10:53,637
Let the tournament begin!

128
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,461
No, no, no, wait!
I'm coming.

129
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:19,427
Hey! Open the door.

130
00:11:21,304 --> 00:11:23,743
Let me in!

131
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:26,434
Citizens of the Valley of Peace.

132
00:11:26,684 --> 00:11:29,395
It is my great honour
to present to you,

133
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:34,441
Tigress, Viper, Crane, Monkey, Mantis.

134
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:37,027
The Furious Five!
Ah...Ah...Ahh...

135
00:11:48,587 --> 00:11:51,958
They're The Furious Five!
Aah..aah... ouch!

136
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:53,856
Warriors prepare!

137
00:11:53,857 --> 00:11:58,159
Blast, No, Quick Po.
Ready for battle.

138
00:11:59,724 --> 00:12:03,477
The thousand tons of fire!
Ho...ha...howw!

139
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:06,920
Wow... Look at that!
Hey! Get out of the way!

140
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:12,547
Uhh...Oh...ohh!
Ah...ah...aah!

141
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:25,060
Hiyaah...ouch!

142
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:44,112
And finally, Master Tigress.

143
00:12:45,405 --> 00:12:49,640
Believe me citizens,
you have not seen anything yet.

144
00:12:49,641 --> 00:12:51,077
I know!

145
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:57,020
Master Tigress faces Iron Arms
and its Blades of Death.

146
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:12,759
I sense the Dragon Warrior
is among us.

147
00:13:18,061 --> 00:13:20,813
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,

148
00:13:20,814 --> 00:13:25,922
Master Oogway will now choose
the Dragon Warrior.

149
00:13:25,924 --> 00:13:28,665
Hah...butta...
No, no, no wait!

150
00:13:29,864 --> 00:13:31,689
Yaa...ahh.

151
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,521
Ha...ha...haah!

152
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:50,759
Ha...ha...haah.
Po! What are you doing?

153
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:52,479
What does it look
like I'm doing?

154
00:13:52,594 --> 00:13:55,826
Stop! Stop!
I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior.

155
00:13:58,814 --> 00:14:03,594
But I don't understand,
you finally have the noodle dream.

156
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:07,546
I lied.
I don't dream about noodles, Dad.

157
00:14:09,693 --> 00:14:15,970
I love Kung Fu...uuu!

158
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:30,182
Oh come on son.
Let's get back to work.

159
00:14:31,422 --> 00:14:33,424
Heay...okay.

160
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:37,596
Ahh...aahh...aah.

161
00:14:37,597 --> 00:14:41,839
Po!...Heay...heay...hey.
Oh...Somebody...

162
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:07,975
Oh. What's going on?

163
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:11,648
... Where?

164
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:15,334
Why are you pointing...?

165
00:15:15,934 --> 00:15:21,616
Oh. Okay. Sorry. I just wanted
to see who the Dragon Warrior was?

166
00:15:21,617 --> 00:15:23,957
How interesting?

167
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,803
Master, are you pointing at me?

168
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:29,938
Him.
Who?

169
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:33,231
You.
Me?

170
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:39,008
The universe has brought
us the Dragon Warrior.

171
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:42,914
What? What?
What? What!

172
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,190
Stop wait.
Who told you to...

173
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:05,575
Master Oogway, wait.

174
00:16:05,576 --> 00:16:09,912
That crabby panda can't possibly
be the answer to our problem.

175
00:16:09,913 --> 00:16:13,770
You were about to appoint the Tigress.
and that thing fell in front of her.

176
00:16:13,771 --> 00:16:18,187
That was just an accident.
There are no accidents.

177
00:16:32,913 --> 00:16:35,937
Forgive us Master.
We have failed you.

178
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:41,069
No. If the panda has not quit by
morning, then I would have failed you.

179
00:17:02,377 --> 00:17:04,253
Wait, wait, wait!

180
00:17:04,254 --> 00:17:07,173
I bring a message from Master Shifu.

181
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:16,515
What? Double the guard.
Extra precautions.

182
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:19,531
Your prison may not be adequate?

183
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:25,169
You doubt my prison security?

184
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,827
Absolutely not!

185
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:30,716
Shifu does.
I'm just the messenger.

186
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:34,552
I'll give you a message
for your Master Shifu.

187
00:17:34,782 --> 00:17:38,724
Escape from Chordom prison
is impossible.

188
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,251
Impressive isn't it?

189
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:49,651
Yes, very impressive.
It is very impressive.

190
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,466
One way in.
And one way out.

191
00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:56,603
One thousand guards
and one prisoner.

192
00:17:56,783 --> 00:18:01,097
Yes, except that prisoner is Tai Lung.

193
00:18:04,811 --> 00:18:06,580
Take us down.

194
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,045
Ahh...ahh...ahh...ahh
Oh...oo...oh..

195
00:18:24,443 --> 00:18:27,172
Oh my...

196
00:18:30,335 --> 00:18:33,693
Behold Tai Lung.

197
00:18:35,236 --> 00:18:37,925
I'll umm...I'll just
wait right here.

198
00:18:37,926 --> 00:18:42,263
It's nothing to worry about.
It's perfectly safe.

199
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:44,486
Both posts.
At the ready.

200
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:49,348
Hey tough guy.
Did you hear...

201
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:51,939
Oogway is finally going to give
someone the Dragon Scroll...

202
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,832
...and it's not going to be you.

203
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,672
What are you doing?
Don't get him mad.

204
00:18:55,673 --> 00:18:57,356
What is he going to do about it?

205
00:18:57,357 --> 00:19:00,935
I've got him completely immobilised.

206
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:03,622
Haa...haa...haa...haa!

207
00:19:03,826 --> 00:19:07,485
Oh...Did I step on
the wooly kiddy's tail?

208
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:10,462
I'm gonna... I've seen enough.

209
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,915
I'm gonna tell Shifu that he
has nothing to worry about.

210
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,610
No, he doesn't.
Okay I'll tell him that.

211
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:18,621
Hmm...
Can we please go now?

212
00:19:42,717 --> 00:19:44,573
Oh. Wait a second.

213
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:51,475
I think there has been
a slight mistake.

214
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:53,504
Err...Everyone seems
to think I'm err...

215
00:19:55,675 --> 00:19:59,342
Ahh...The sacred Hall of Warriors.

216
00:19:59,358 --> 00:20:01,339
No way.

217
00:20:01,422 --> 00:20:03,257
Look at this place.

218
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:06,964
Master Flying-Rhino's armour.

219
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:08,679
With authentic battle damage!

220
00:20:09,774 --> 00:20:13,184
Wow...the Sword of Heroes.

221
00:20:13,215 --> 00:20:16,592
Said to be so sharp, you can cut
yourself just by looking ... Aah!...Oww!

222
00:20:18,647 --> 00:20:20,920
The invisible Dragon of Destiny.

223
00:20:21,566 --> 00:20:25,821
Uuhhs... I've only seen paintings
of that painting.

224
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:31,774
Aah...ah...ha...ha...ha...
Heeyah...yah.. Aah...ah...ah..

225
00:20:31,868 --> 00:20:34,537
Noo..! Ho...oh, oh, oh...

226
00:20:35,715 --> 00:20:38,029
The legendary Urn of Whispering Warriors.

227
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,586
Said to contain souls of the
entire Tenshu army.

228
00:20:44,463 --> 00:20:47,800
Hello?
Have you finished sightseeing?

229
00:20:47,842 --> 00:20:50,073
Sorry. I should have
come to see you first.

230
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:51,991
My patience is running thin.
Ohh?

231
00:20:51,992 --> 00:20:55,062
Well. I mean, it's not like
you are going anywhere.

232
00:20:55,063 --> 00:20:57,272
You turn around.
Sure.

233
00:20:57,273 --> 00:21:01,592
Hey, how is it going?
How do you get 500...Master Shifu!... Ooh!...

234
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,205
Ohh...whooo...

235
00:21:03,206 --> 00:21:07,064
Someone broke that...
But I'm going to fix it...I...

236
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:10,455
Do you have some glue...
Whooo....

237
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:12,719
Aah...ouch...ooo!
I've a splinter.

238
00:21:13,825 --> 00:21:16,848
So you are the legendary Dragon Warrior?
Hmm...

239
00:21:17,065 --> 00:21:20,020
Ahh, I guess so?
Wrong!

240
00:21:20,023 --> 00:21:23,334
You are not the Dragon Warrior.
You will never be the Dragon Warrior...

241
00:21:23,335 --> 00:21:27,296
... until you've learned the secret
of the Dragon scroll.

242
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:31,466
Wow...so...
How does this work?

243
00:21:31,468 --> 00:21:34,615
Do you have a ladder?
a trampoline or...?

244
00:21:34,616 --> 00:21:37,410
Umph...You think it is that easy?

245
00:21:37,411 --> 00:21:41,007
That I'm just going to hand you
the secret to limitless power?

246
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,039
No! I...

247
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,957
One must first master the highest
level of Kung Fu

248
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:49,087
and that is clearly impossible
if that one is someone like you.

249
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:50,633
Someone like me?
Yes!

250
00:21:50,634 --> 00:21:54,820
Look at you!
This fat blob. Flabby arms.

251
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:57,533
Those are sensitive.
in the flabby parts.

252
00:21:57,534 --> 00:22:00,245
And this ridiculous belly.
Hey...whooo...

253
00:22:00,246 --> 00:22:04,625
And utter disregard for personal hygiene.
Now wait a minute.

254
00:22:04,626 --> 00:22:07,980
That's a little uncalled for.
Don't stand that close. I can smell your breath.

255
00:22:07,982 --> 00:22:09,462
Listen, Oogway said that I was the...

256
00:22:09,463 --> 00:22:11,765
Uh... the Wushi Finger Hold.

257
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:13,122
Never... Master Shifu don't...

258
00:22:14,123 --> 00:22:16,805
Haa...oh... You know this hold?

259
00:22:16,806 --> 00:22:19,803
Developed by Master Wushi in the
3rd dynasty. Yes.

260
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:22,618
Oh. Then you must know what happens
when I flex my pinky.

261
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,286
No, no, no...

262
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:29,140
You know the hardest part of this?...
The hardest part is cleaning up afterwards.

263
00:22:29,146 --> 00:22:32,270
Humm...
Okay. Okay, take it easy.

264
00:22:32,271 --> 00:22:34,615
Now listen closely, Panda.

265
00:22:34,616 --> 00:22:37,881
Oogway may have picked you,
but when I'm through with you,...

266
00:22:37,882 --> 00:22:41,199
I promise you,
you're going to wish he hadn't.

267
00:22:41,513 --> 00:22:42,868
Are we clear?

268
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:45,921
Yes, we're clear, we're clear.
We are so clear.

269
00:22:45,922 --> 00:22:49,644
Good. Hmm, Hmm, Hmm.
I can't wait to get started.

270
00:23:29,265 --> 00:23:30,517
Let's begin.

271
00:23:30,518 --> 00:23:31,789
Wait, wait, wait.

272
00:23:34,635 --> 00:23:37,208
Now?
Yes now.

273
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:41,193
Unless you think that the great Oogway was
wrong and you are not the Dragon Warrior.

274
00:23:41,194 --> 00:23:46,918
Okay. Well, I don't know
if I can do all of those moves.

275
00:23:47,157 --> 00:23:50,035
Well, if we don't try,
we will never know, will we?

276
00:23:50,036 --> 00:23:53,956
Yes, it's just, maybe we can find
something more suited to my level.

277
00:23:53,957 --> 00:23:56,242
And what level is that?
Well you know...

278
00:23:56,243 --> 00:24:00,286
I'm not a master, but
let's just start at zero.

279
00:24:00,287 --> 00:24:05,540
Level zero.
There is no such thing as level zero.

280
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,596
Hey, maybe I can start with that.

281
00:24:07,597 --> 00:24:10,600
That. We use that
for training children.

282
00:24:10,601 --> 00:24:13,213
And popping the door
open when it is hot.

283
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:16,184
But if you insist.

284
00:24:16,185 --> 00:24:18,496
Wow... The Furious Five.

285
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:21,079
You're so much bigger
than your action figures.

286
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:23,779
Except for you, Mantis.
You're about the same.

287
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,154
Go ahead, Panda.
Show us what you can do.

288
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:34,347
Ahh...Are they going to watch? Or should I just
wait until they get back to work or something?

289
00:24:34,493 --> 00:24:38,414
Hit it.
Okay, I mean, I just ate,

290
00:24:38,415 --> 00:24:43,560
and so I'm still digesting, so my
Kung Fu may not be as good as later on.

291
00:24:43,561 --> 00:24:45,672
Just hit it.

292
00:24:47,673 --> 00:24:51,136
What'd you got?
You've got nothing cos' I got it right here.

293
00:24:51,242 --> 00:24:54,389
You picking on my friends?
Get ready to fell the thunder.

294
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,921
Come on, crazy feet.
What're you going to do about crazy feet?

295
00:24:56,922 --> 00:24:59,953
Come on. I'm a blur. I'm a blur.
You've never seen Bear style.

296
00:24:59,954 --> 00:25:01,785
You've only seen Praying Mantis.

297
00:25:01,786 --> 00:25:06,425
Or Monkey style.
Imagine snake-kiddy Snake.

298
00:25:06,426 --> 00:25:08,433
Would you hit it!

299
00:25:08,818 --> 00:25:11,549
Alright. Alright.

300
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:20,600
Why don't you try it again?
A little harder.

301
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:23,853
How's that?
Oohhh...

302
00:25:33,315 --> 00:25:34,978
Oh, that hurts!

303
00:25:42,032 --> 00:25:44,420
This will be easier than I thought.

304
00:25:45,191 --> 00:25:47,800
Feeling a little nausea...
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

305
00:25:51,838 --> 00:25:54,746
Oohh... My tenders.

306
00:26:22,701 --> 00:26:24,388
How did I do?

307
00:26:24,431 --> 00:26:28,081
There is now a level zero.

308
00:26:29,624 --> 00:26:33,252
Don't deny that.
I don't understand what Master Oogway was thinking.

309
00:26:33,253 --> 00:26:38,132
Poor guy is going to get himself killed.
He is so fighty.

310
00:26:38,133 --> 00:26:43,137
The Dragon Warrior fell out
of the sky in a ball of fire.

311
00:26:43,138 --> 00:26:45,810
When he walks,
the very ground shakes.

312
00:26:46,734 --> 00:26:51,144
One would think that Master Oogway would
choose someone who actually knew Kung Fu.

313
00:26:51,146 --> 00:26:55,600
Yes. Or could at least touch his toes.
Or even see his toes.

314
00:27:20,026 --> 00:27:21,423
Okay.

315
00:27:30,078 --> 00:27:31,955
Great.

316
00:27:36,335 --> 00:27:37,916
Ooouuch!

317
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:47,957
Oh hey. Hi.
You're up?

318
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:52,749
Am now.
I was just..er...someday...eh?

319
00:27:53,376 --> 00:27:57,124
The Kung Fu stuff is hard work, right?
Your biceps sore.

320
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,942
I've had a long day and rather
disappointing day, so...er...

321
00:28:03,922 --> 00:28:07,384
Ya...I should probably get to sleep now.

322
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,540
Ya... Ya...of course.
Okay. Thanks.

323
00:28:09,637 --> 00:28:12,104
It's just, I'm such a big fan...

324
00:28:12,626 --> 00:28:15,250
You guys were so totally amazing
at the battle of the Weeping River.

325
00:28:15,251 --> 00:28:19,067
Outnumbered. A thousand to one.
But, you didn't stop. You just,....

326
00:28:21,043 --> 00:28:23,211
Oh. Sorry about that.

327
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:27,403
Ahh... Look you don't belong here.

328
00:28:27,445 --> 00:28:31,678
Er...I know, I know.
You're right.

329
00:28:31,699 --> 00:28:35,070
I don't have it.
It's just, my whole life, I dream of...

330
00:28:35,071 --> 00:28:38,786
No, no, no. I meant you don't
belong here, I mean in this room.

331
00:28:38,914 --> 00:28:43,298
But this is my room.
Property of Crane.

332
00:28:43,418 --> 00:28:46,671
Oh, okay right, right.
So...

333
00:28:46,672 --> 00:28:50,175
Ya, you want to get to sleep.
Keeping you up.

334
00:28:50,185 --> 00:28:52,051
We've got big things tomorrow.

335
00:28:52,323 --> 00:28:56,285
Alright. You are awesome. The last thing
I'm going to say. Okay, bye-bye.

336
00:29:00,122 --> 00:29:03,025
What was that?
I didn't say anything.

337
00:29:03,026 --> 00:29:06,896
Okay. Alright. Goodnight.
Sleep well.

338
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,072
Seem a little bit awkward.

339
00:29:13,176 --> 00:29:15,628
Master Tigress, didn't mean
to wake you. Just a...

340
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:18,482
You don't belong here.
Ah ya...ya, of course...

341
00:29:18,483 --> 00:29:23,137
This is your room...
I mean you don't belong in the Jade Palace.

342
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:27,437
You're a disgrace to Kung Fu and if
you have any respect of who we are,

343
00:29:27,438 --> 00:29:32,058
and what we do,
you will be gone by morning.

344
00:29:37,053 --> 00:29:39,284
Big fan.

345
00:29:45,978 --> 00:29:49,982
I see you've found the Sacred Peach
Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

346
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,125
Is that what this is?
I'm so sorry.

347
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,951
I thought it was just
a regular peach tree.

348
00:29:57,424 --> 00:30:01,916
I understand, you eat
when you are upset.

349
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:05,976
Upset? I'm not upset.
Why would I be upset?

350
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:09,938
So, why are you upset?

351
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:18,780
I probably sucked more today
than anyone in the history of Kung Fu.

352
00:30:19,134 --> 00:30:20,864
In the history of China.

353
00:30:20,865 --> 00:30:22,575
In the history of sucking.

354
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:25,228
Probably.
And the Five...man,

355
00:30:25,229 --> 00:30:27,780
you should have seen them,
they totally hate me.

356
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:30,750
Totally.
How's Shifu ever going to turn me

357
00:30:30,751 --> 00:30:33,345
into the Dragon Warrior?

358
00:30:34,774 --> 00:30:38,319
I mean I'm not like the Five,
I've got no claws.

359
00:30:38,361 --> 00:30:40,425
No wings,
no venom.

360
00:30:40,426 --> 00:30:43,908
Even Mantis got those thingies.

361
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:48,349
May be I should just quit
and go back to making noodles.

362
00:30:51,415 --> 00:30:56,801
Quit. Don't quit.
Noodles. Don't noodles.

363
00:30:57,712 --> 00:31:02,384
You are too concerned with
what was and what will be.

364
00:31:02,385 --> 00:31:07,285
There's a saying.
Yesterday is history,

365
00:31:07,314 --> 00:31:12,310
Tomorrow is a mystery,
But today is a gift.

366
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:16,293
That is why it is called the "present".

367
00:31:45,341 --> 00:31:47,343
Oh No!
What's happening?

368
00:31:47,761 --> 00:31:50,827
To your battle stations!
Go! Go! Go!

369
00:31:58,896 --> 00:32:02,107
Fire Cross-Bow!
Fire!

370
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:06,420
Fire!

371
00:32:14,131 --> 00:32:16,716
Tai Lung's free. I must warn Shifu.

372
00:32:16,737 --> 00:32:18,781
You are not going anywhere.
Neither is he!

373
00:32:18,782 --> 00:32:21,137
Let go of me.
Bring it up!

374
00:32:23,224 --> 00:32:25,413
Wait! Bring it back!

375
00:32:43,575 --> 00:32:46,140
He's going this way.
He won't get far.

376
00:32:46,141 --> 00:32:48,435
Archers!

377
00:33:55,227 --> 00:33:57,813
We Dead.
So very, very dead.

378
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,066
Ha..Ha. Not yet, we're not.
Now!

379
00:34:48,632 --> 00:34:51,707
Can we run now?
Yes.

380
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:14,407
I am glad Shifu sent you.

381
00:35:15,658 --> 00:35:18,452
I was beginning to feel
I'm being forgotten.

382
00:35:18,598 --> 00:35:24,833
Fly back there and tell them, the
real Dragon Warrior is coming home.

383
00:35:36,407 --> 00:35:38,701
Good Morning, Master.

384
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:41,412
Panda!

385
00:35:41,413 --> 00:35:44,019
Panda! Wake up!

386
00:35:45,082 --> 00:35:48,856
Hmm, hmm, hmm...
He's quitted.

387
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:53,360
What do we do now Master
with the Panda gone?

388
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:55,404
Who will be the Dragon Warrior?

389
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:58,391
All we can do is resume our training
and trust that in time...

390
00:35:58,497 --> 00:36:01,614
the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed.

391
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,600
What are you doing here?

392
00:36:04,642 --> 00:36:06,915
Haa...hey.
Good Morning Master.

393
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:09,079
I thought I'll warm up a little.

394
00:36:11,232 --> 00:36:14,844
You're stuck.
Stuck?...No...What?...Stuck?

395
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:18,542
No...This is one of the...
Ya...I'm stuck.

396
00:36:18,614 --> 00:36:21,325
Help him.
Oh dear.

397
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,238
Lift me on three.
One, two, ....

398
00:36:27,998 --> 00:36:29,751
Thank you.
Don't mention it.

399
00:36:29,822 --> 00:36:32,084
No really. I appreciate it...
...Ever.

400
00:36:33,086 --> 00:36:37,215
You actually thought you could
learn to do a full split in one night.

401
00:36:38,256 --> 00:36:41,419
It takes years to develop
ones flexibility.

402
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,618
And years longer to apply it in combat.

403
00:36:54,731 --> 00:36:56,352
Put that down!

404
00:36:56,353 --> 00:37:00,841
The only souvenirs we collect down here
are bloody knuckles and broken bones.

405
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:04,490
Yaa...ha...ha...ha.
Excellent!

406
00:37:04,594 --> 00:37:06,326
Let's get started.

407
00:37:08,118 --> 00:37:10,600
Are you ready?
I was born ready...Oww!

408
00:37:11,413 --> 00:37:15,000
Oww!...Oh!. I'm sorry brother.
I thought you said you're ready.

409
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:18,190
That was awesome!
Let's go again!

410
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:48,848
I've been taking it easy on you Panda
but no more. Your next opponent...

411
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,618
...will be me.
Alright. Ya...Let's go!

412
00:37:54,225 --> 00:37:56,164
Step forth!

413
00:37:56,685 --> 00:37:59,683
The true path to victory is to find
your opponent's weakness.

414
00:37:59,684 --> 00:38:01,769
And make him suffer for it.

415
00:38:02,212 --> 00:38:06,485
Oh yeah. To take his strength
and use it against him.

416
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:10,115
Until he finally falls or quits.

417
00:38:10,116 --> 00:38:15,120
But a real warrior never quits.
Don't worry Master, I'll never quit.

418
00:38:25,713 --> 00:38:28,716
If he is smart he won't
come back those steps.

419
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:32,634
But he will.
He's not going to quit, is he?

420
00:38:32,845 --> 00:38:35,346
He's not going to quit bouncing.
I'll tell you that.

421
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:50,517
Oouch! I thought you said
accupuncture will make me feel better.

422
00:38:50,518 --> 00:38:54,053
Trust me it will.
It's just not easy finding right nerve points

423
00:38:54,054 --> 00:38:56,633
under all this...fat?
Fur!

424
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,770
I was going to say fur.
Sure you were.

425
00:38:59,016 --> 00:39:01,215
Who am I to judge a warrior
based on his size?

426
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:05,422
So I mean, look at me.
I'm over here.

427
00:39:05,423 --> 00:39:08,879
Haa...aah...
Maybe you should take a look at this again.

428
00:39:09,296 --> 00:39:11,694
Ohh... Okay.

429
00:39:11,921 --> 00:39:15,652
Oouch!
Stop! Stop it!

430
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:16,905
Eee...ouch!

431
00:39:17,387 --> 00:39:20,285
I know Master Shifu is trying
to inspire me and all.

432
00:39:20,411 --> 00:39:24,123
But if I didn't know any better
I'll say he's trying to get rid of me.

433
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,943
I know he can seem like heartless.
Aaahh...!

434
00:39:31,944 --> 00:39:34,133
But you know he wasn't
always like that.

435
00:39:34,134 --> 00:39:39,930
According to legend there was once a time
when Master Shifu actually used to spy...

436
00:39:39,931 --> 00:39:43,331
No...
Yes, but that was before...

437
00:39:43,704 --> 00:39:46,502
Before what?
Before Tai Lung.

438
00:39:46,503 --> 00:39:49,357
Aah...ya.
We are not really suppose to talk about him.

439
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:52,595
Well if he is going to stay here
he should now.

440
00:39:52,608 --> 00:39:54,760
Guys, guys,
I know about Tai Lung.

441
00:39:54,761 --> 00:40:00,134
He was a student. The first to ever
master the 1000 scrolls of Kung Fu.

442
00:40:00,262 --> 00:40:04,245
And then he turned bad
and now he's in jail.

443
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:06,609
He wasn't just a student.

444
00:40:10,793 --> 00:40:13,890
Shifu found him as a cub.

445
00:40:15,255 --> 00:40:17,766
And he raised him as his son.

446
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,591
And when the child showed
talent in Kung Fu

447
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,829
Shifu trained him.

448
00:40:27,975 --> 00:40:32,291
He believed in him. He told him
he was destined for greatness.

449
00:40:33,709 --> 00:40:36,900
It was never enough for Tai Lung.

450
00:40:38,255 --> 00:40:40,466
He wanted the Dragon Scroll.

451
00:40:40,507 --> 00:40:44,424
But Oogway saw darkness
in his heart and refused.

452
00:40:45,137 --> 00:40:48,474
Outraged, Tai Lung
laid waste to the Valley.

453
00:40:50,642 --> 00:40:53,113
He tried to take the Scroll by force.

454
00:40:53,228 --> 00:40:57,461
And Shifu has to destroy
what he had created.

455
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:01,194
But how could he?

456
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:18,940
Shifu loved Tai Lung like he
has never love anyone before.

457
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,720
What's it?

458
00:41:37,082 --> 00:41:40,210
And now he has a chance
to make things right.

459
00:41:40,211 --> 00:41:42,505
To train the true Dragon Warrior.

460
00:41:42,546 --> 00:41:44,746
And he is stuck with you.

461
00:41:45,111 --> 00:41:49,281
A big fat Panda who
treats it like a joke.

462
00:41:50,261 --> 00:41:52,388
Ohh... That's it!
Wait! My fault!

463
00:41:52,389 --> 00:41:54,457
I accidentally tweaked his facial nerves.

464
00:41:56,705 --> 00:41:59,082
And may have also stopped his heart.

465
00:42:02,919 --> 00:42:04,775
Inner peace.

466
00:42:06,006 --> 00:42:08,425
Inner peace.

467
00:42:10,802 --> 00:42:16,015
Inner...in...in...in
inner peace.

468
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:23,230
Look whoever is making that
flapping sound quiet down.

469
00:42:26,841 --> 00:42:29,696
Inner...Quaaa!

470
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:35,596
Oh, Zeng, excellent.

471
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,693
I could use some good news now.

472
00:42:41,405 --> 00:42:42,865
Aaahh....

473
00:42:45,919 --> 00:42:47,717
Master. Master.
Hmm...

474
00:42:47,718 --> 00:42:52,102
I...I..have ...It's a...
It's a very bad news.

475
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:58,324
Aah... Shifu. There's just news.
No good or bad.

476
00:42:58,524 --> 00:43:01,767
Master, your vision was right.

477
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:05,276
Tai Lung has broken out of prison.
He's on his way.

478
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,149
That is bad news...

479
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:13,904
... if you do not believe that
the Dragon Warrior can stop him.

480
00:43:14,362 --> 00:43:18,180
Panda? Master, that Panda
is not the Dragon Warrior.

481
00:43:18,181 --> 00:43:21,450
He wasn't even meant to be here.
It was an accident.

482
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:24,261
There are no accidents.

483
00:43:25,164 --> 00:43:28,292
Yes, I know.
You said that already.

484
00:43:28,334 --> 00:43:32,609
Twice.
Well, that was no accident either.

485
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:35,098
Thrice.
My old friend.

486
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:40,050
The Panda will never fulfill
his destiny, nor you, yours.

487
00:43:40,052 --> 00:43:43,597
Until you let go of the
illusion of control.

488
00:43:43,682 --> 00:43:45,979
Illusion?
Yes.

489
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:48,312
Look at this tree, Shifu.

490
00:43:48,314 --> 00:43:51,170
I cannot make it blossom
when it suits me.

491
00:43:51,172 --> 00:43:54,656
Nor make it bear
fruit before it's time.

492
00:43:54,661 --> 00:43:57,361
But there are things
we can control.

493
00:43:58,717 --> 00:44:01,175
I can control when
the fruit will fall.

494
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:06,887
I can control where
to plant the seed.

495
00:44:07,455 --> 00:44:10,478
That is no illusion, Master.

496
00:44:11,876 --> 00:44:15,663
Ah...yes, but no matter
what you do

497
00:44:15,768 --> 00:44:18,612
That seed will grow
to be a peach tree.

498
00:44:18,721 --> 00:44:21,597
You may wish for an
apple or an orange.

499
00:44:21,911 --> 00:44:27,102
But you will get a peach.
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung.

500
00:44:27,432 --> 00:44:34,823
Maybe it can, if you are willing
to guide it, to nurture it.

501
00:44:34,877 --> 00:44:36,764
To believe in it.

502
00:44:36,765 --> 00:44:40,886
But how? How?
I need your help, Master.

503
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:44,831
No, you just need to believe.

504
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:50,803
Promise me, Shifu.
Promise me, you will believe.

505
00:44:50,871 --> 00:44:56,625
I... I will try.
Hmm...Good.

506
00:44:58,795 --> 00:45:01,298
My time has come.

507
00:45:03,049 --> 00:45:07,269
You must continue your journey
without me.

508
00:45:07,429 --> 00:45:10,126
What?...what?...what are you...
Wait!

509
00:45:11,224 --> 00:45:12,996
Master.

510
00:45:13,351 --> 00:45:15,327
You can't leave me.

511
00:45:18,627 --> 00:45:22,276
You must believe.

512
00:45:23,526 --> 00:45:25,904
Master.

513
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:57,945
I'm not scared...yet.
Sound like fun. He maybe a wolf.

514
00:45:57,946 --> 00:46:01,031
You may be the scariest bandit
in Harjin Province.

515
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,734
But you're a lousy tipper.
Really.

516
00:46:03,752 --> 00:46:06,693
So, how did you
get out of there alive?

517
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:13,220
I mean I didn't actually said that,
but I thought it, in my mind.

518
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:16,640
If he could read my mind
he would have been like...what?

519
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:19,039
Order up!
You like it?

520
00:46:20,868 --> 00:46:22,836
This is really good.

521
00:46:22,837 --> 00:46:25,701
Now, come on. You should try
my dad's secret ingredient soup.

522
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:28,280
He actually knows the secret ingredient.

523
00:46:28,672 --> 00:46:30,782
What are you talking about?
This is amazing.

524
00:46:30,783 --> 00:46:33,350
Wow...you are really a good cook.
I wish my mouth was bigger.

525
00:46:33,362 --> 00:46:35,580
Tigress, you got to try this.
Hmm...

526
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:39,870
It is said that the Dragon Warrior can
survive for months at a time on nothing

527
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:44,287
but the dew of a single Gingko leaf
and the energy of the universe.

528
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,733
I guess my body doesn't know
it's the Dragon Warrior yet.

529
00:46:49,191 --> 00:46:54,655
I need lard more than dew
and the universe juice.

530
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,870
What?
Oh nothing, Master Shifu.

531
00:47:01,871 --> 00:47:04,148
Ha...ha...ha...ha!

532
00:47:04,644 --> 00:47:07,772
You will never be the Dragon Warrior
unless you lose 500 pounds.

533
00:47:07,773 --> 00:47:11,213
and brush your teeth.
What is the noise you're making?

534
00:47:11,214 --> 00:47:13,180
Laughter?
I have never heard of it.

535
00:47:13,277 --> 00:47:18,511
Work hard Panda and maybe someday
you'll have ears like mine.

536
00:47:19,658 --> 00:47:21,618
That's good.
Oh...oh, yup.

537
00:47:21,764 --> 00:47:24,366
Ears?
It's not working for you.

538
00:47:24,392 --> 00:47:26,472
I thought they're pretty good.
It's Shifu!

539
00:47:26,681 --> 00:47:28,925
Of course it's Shifu.
What do you think I'm doing?

540
00:47:31,273 --> 00:47:34,075
Master Shifu.
Aahh...

541
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:39,252
You think this is funny!
Tai Lung has escaped from prison!

542
00:47:39,253 --> 00:47:41,032
And you all are acting like children!
What?

543
00:47:41,034 --> 00:47:45,346
He's coming for the Dragon Scroll and
you're the only one who can stop him.

544
00:47:48,415 --> 00:47:51,694
Ha...and here I am saying you've
got no a sense of humour.

545
00:47:51,695 --> 00:47:55,687
I am gonna... step down.
What? You're serious?

546
00:47:55,688 --> 00:48:00,234
And I have to...aaa...not...
Master Oogway will stop him.

547
00:48:00,235 --> 00:48:03,246
He did it before. He'll do it again.
Oogway cannot!

548
00:48:03,873 --> 00:48:06,465
Not anymore.
Haa?

549
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:09,465
Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.

550
00:48:09,518 --> 00:48:11,088
The Panda?
Yes, the Panda!

551
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:14,851
Master please, let us stop Tai Lung?
This is what you train us for!

552
00:48:14,852 --> 00:48:19,961
No! It is not your destiny to defeat
Tai Lung! It is his!

553
00:48:20,424 --> 00:48:22,176
Where did he go?

554
00:48:28,891 --> 00:48:31,977
You cannot leave!
A real warrior never quit!

555
00:48:32,112 --> 00:48:34,000
Watch me!

556
00:48:36,064 --> 00:48:38,984
Come on! How am I suppose
to beat Tai Lung?

557
00:48:39,162 --> 00:48:41,128
I can't even beat you to the stairs.

558
00:48:41,129 --> 00:48:44,318
You will beat him because
you are the Dragon Warrior.

559
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,407
Ouch!
You don't believe that!

560
00:48:46,408 --> 00:48:48,335
Oh! You never believed that.

561
00:48:48,336 --> 00:48:51,358
From the first moment I got here,
you've been trying to get rid of me.

562
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,769
Yes, I was!

563
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:58,982
But now I ask you to trust in your Master
as I have come to trust in mine.

564
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:03,537
You are not my Master.
And I am not the Dragon Warrior.

565
00:49:03,643 --> 00:49:07,051
Then why didn't you quit?
You knew I was trying to get rid of you.

566
00:49:07,073 --> 00:49:10,144
Yet you stayed.
Ya. I stayed.

567
00:49:10,145 --> 00:49:13,699
I stayed because every time
you threw a brick at my head

568
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,384
Or said I smelled, it hurt!

569
00:49:16,905 --> 00:49:21,845
But it could never hurt more than it
did everyday in my life just being me.

570
00:49:22,591 --> 00:49:30,194
I stayed because I thought if anyone
could change me, could make me not me...

571
00:49:30,403 --> 00:49:34,986
...it was you. The greatest
Kung Fu teacher of all of China.

572
00:49:34,995 --> 00:49:40,657
But I can change you! I can turn
you into the Dragon Warrior. And I will!

573
00:49:41,709 --> 00:49:45,233
Come on, Tai Lung is
on his way right now.

574
00:49:45,327 --> 00:49:47,432
And even if it takes him
a hundred years to get here.

575
00:49:47,433 --> 00:49:52,169
How are you going to change
this into the Dragon Warrior?

576
00:49:52,274 --> 00:49:53,637
Hah?

577
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:57,328
How?

578
00:49:58,256 --> 00:49:59,768
How?

579
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:04,913
How?
I don't know!

580
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,386
I do not know

581
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:23,644
That's what I thought.

582
00:51:00,993 --> 00:51:03,481
This is what she trains for it

583
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:12,174
Tigress!

584
00:51:15,507 --> 00:51:17,522
Don't try and stop me.

585
00:51:20,157 --> 00:51:22,631
We are not trying to stop you.
What?

586
00:51:22,634 --> 00:51:24,663
We are coming with you.

587
00:52:37,439 --> 00:52:40,797
What?
I eat when I am upset, okay!

588
00:52:41,756 --> 00:52:43,638
Oh! No need to explain.

589
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:47,723
I just thought you might be monkey.
He hides his almond cookies in the top-shelf.

590
00:53:08,698 --> 00:53:10,495
Don't tell Monkey.

591
00:53:10,512 --> 00:53:12,139
Look at you.
Yaaa..!

592
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:16,875
I know I disgust you.
No, I mean, how did you get up there?

593
00:53:16,876 --> 00:53:22,060
I don't know,...I...
I don't know. Just get the cookies.

594
00:53:22,061 --> 00:53:27,529
And yet you are 10 feet off the ground
and have done a perfect split.

595
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:33,326
No, this?
This is just an accident!

596
00:53:48,903 --> 00:53:51,885
I know you are trying to be
all mystical and Kung Fu-ee.

597
00:53:52,553 --> 00:53:55,847
But could you least tell me
where we are going?

598
00:54:04,898 --> 00:54:11,145
You drag me all the way
out here for a bath?

599
00:54:14,323 --> 00:54:19,349
Panda, we do not wash our pits
in the pool of sacred tears.

600
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:21,580
Uuh?...The pool of...

601
00:54:21,581 --> 00:54:26,502
This is where Oogway unraveled
the mysteries of harmony and focus.

602
00:54:26,503 --> 00:54:30,778
This is the birth place of Kung Fu.

603
00:54:44,373 --> 00:54:47,125
Do you want to learn Kung Fu?

604
00:54:47,126 --> 00:54:51,222
Yes
Then I am your Master.

605
00:54:51,275 --> 00:54:53,152
Okay!

606
00:54:54,466 --> 00:54:56,986
Don't cry.
Okay.

607
00:55:02,244 --> 00:55:08,148
When you focus on Kung Fu,
when you concentrate, you stink.

608
00:55:08,417 --> 00:55:13,292
But perhaps that is my fault.
I cannot train you the way I trained the Five.

609
00:55:13,672 --> 00:55:18,009
I see now that the way to get
through to you is with this.

610
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:21,096
Aah great, cause I am hungry.

611
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:25,558
Good, when you have been trained
you may eat.

612
00:55:27,164 --> 00:55:28,707
Let's begin.

613
00:56:38,763 --> 00:56:40,338
After you, Panda.

614
00:56:40,339 --> 00:56:45,385
Just like that.
No sit-ups. No, ten-mile hike.

615
00:56:45,676 --> 00:56:50,874
I vowed to train you and you've been
trained. You are free to eat.

616
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,270
Enjoy

617
00:56:58,579 --> 00:57:01,881
Hey!
I said you are free to eat.

618
00:57:02,882 --> 00:57:04,759
Have a dumpling.

619
00:57:13,326 --> 00:57:16,121
You are free to eat.
Am I?

620
00:57:15,767 --> 00:57:17,737
Are you?

621
00:58:42,808 --> 00:58:44,810
I am not hungry.

622
00:58:48,021 --> 00:58:49,924
Master.

623
00:59:21,205 --> 00:59:22,728
Cut it!

624
00:59:39,056 --> 00:59:42,857
Where is the Dragon Warrior?
How do you know you are not looking at her?

625
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:45,829
You think I'm a fool.

626
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:49,545
I know you are not the Dragon Warrior.
None of you!

627
00:59:49,755 --> 00:59:53,013
I heard how he fell out of the sky
on a ball of fire.

628
00:59:53,014 --> 00:59:57,637
But he's a warrior unlike anything
in the world has ever seen.

629
00:59:57,647 --> 01:00:01,097
Po?
So that is his name.

630
01:00:01,307 --> 01:00:02,907
Po!

631
01:00:03,121 --> 01:00:06,276
Finally, a worthy opponent.

632
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:09,439
The battle will be legendary.

633
01:00:28,854 --> 01:00:31,043
We got this, help her.

634
01:00:55,296 --> 01:00:57,642
Monkey!
Jump!

635
01:01:10,018 --> 01:01:11,770
Mantis!

636
01:01:15,669 --> 01:01:17,421
Now!

637
01:02:02,964 --> 01:02:05,528
Shifu, taught you well.

638
01:02:08,219 --> 01:02:10,555
But he didn't teach you everything.

639
01:02:14,246 --> 01:02:17,706
You have done well, Panda.
Done well?

640
01:02:17,728 --> 01:02:21,581
Done well!
I have done awesome!

641
01:02:22,525 --> 01:02:26,013
The mark of a true hero is humility.

642
01:02:26,383 --> 01:02:30,163
But yes,
you have done, awesome.

643
01:02:37,789 --> 01:02:40,312
Five?
Fives!

644
01:02:40,314 --> 01:02:42,419
They're dead.
No, they are breathing.

645
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:44,650
They're asleep?
No, their eyes are open.

646
01:02:44,651 --> 01:02:46,777
We were no match for
his nerve attack.

647
01:02:46,778 --> 01:02:49,071
He has gotten stronger.

648
01:02:49,321 --> 01:02:51,490
Tai Lung?
Stronger!

649
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:55,619
He's too fast.
Sorry, Po.

650
01:02:57,108 --> 01:03:00,699
I thought we could stop him.
He could have kill you.

651
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,923
Why didn't he?
So you can come back here...

652
01:03:02,924 --> 01:03:06,526
...and strike fear into our hearts.
But it won't work.

653
01:03:06,984 --> 01:03:10,341
It might. I mean a little.

654
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:13,857
I'm pretty scared.
You can defeat him, Panda.

655
01:03:13,865 --> 01:03:17,994
Are you kidding?
If they can't... They're Five Masters.

656
01:03:17,995 --> 01:03:19,412
I'm just one me.

657
01:03:19,413 --> 01:03:23,221
But you have the one thing
that no one else does,

658
01:03:28,233 --> 01:03:30,569
You really believe I'm ready.

659
01:03:30,715 --> 01:03:34,030
You are, Po.

660
01:04:23,306 --> 01:04:26,663
Behold, the Dragon Scroll.

661
01:04:26,977 --> 01:04:29,645
It is yours.
Wait.

662
01:04:30,073 --> 01:04:32,481
What happens when I read it?
No one knows.

663
01:04:32,483 --> 01:04:35,858
But legend says you will be able
to hear a butterfly's wings beat.

664
01:04:35,859 --> 01:04:38,797
Wow! Really? That's cool.
Yes!

665
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:44,180
And see light in the deepest cave.
You will feel the universe in motion around you.

666
01:04:44,181 --> 01:04:48,114
Wow! Can I punch through walls?
Can I do a quadruple back flip?

667
01:04:48,115 --> 01:04:51,347
Focus. Focus. Focus!
Oh, ya...yah.

668
01:04:51,453 --> 01:04:54,355
Read it Po.
And fulfill your destiny.

669
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:59,813
Read it and become the Dragon Warrior.
Wow...!

670
01:05:05,284 --> 01:05:07,150
It's impossible to open.

671
01:05:13,229 --> 01:05:14,814
Thank you.

672
01:05:14,855 --> 01:05:17,195
Probably, loosen it up for you.

673
01:05:18,338 --> 01:05:20,590
Okay, here goes.

674
01:05:25,453 --> 01:05:29,117
Aargh...!

675
01:05:32,038 --> 01:05:33,769
It's blank.
What?

676
01:05:33,811 --> 01:05:37,248
Here, look.
No, I am forbidden to look upon it.

677
01:05:43,424 --> 01:05:48,605
Blank!
I don't...I don't understand.

678
01:05:49,492 --> 01:05:55,500
Okay. So like Oogway was
just a crazy old turtle after all.

679
01:05:56,001 --> 01:05:58,638
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

680
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:02,591
Oh, come on.
Face it. He picked me by accident.

681
01:06:02,734 --> 01:06:05,382
Of course I'm not Dragon Warrior.

682
01:06:05,737 --> 01:06:07,593
Who am I kidding?

683
01:06:07,947 --> 01:06:11,076
But who will stop Tai Lung?
He will destroy everything.

684
01:06:11,077 --> 01:06:14,080
And everyone.
No.

685
01:06:14,495 --> 01:06:18,216
Evacuate the Valley.
You must protect the villagers...

686
01:06:18,217 --> 01:06:19,790
... from Tai Lung's rage.

687
01:06:20,292 --> 01:06:21,634
What about you, Master?

688
01:06:21,635 --> 01:06:23,199
I will fight him.
What?

689
01:06:23,274 --> 01:06:27,003
I can hold him off long enough
for everyone to escape.

690
01:06:27,027 --> 01:06:29,884
But Shifu, he'll kill you.

691
01:06:29,968 --> 01:06:32,866
Then I would have finally
paid for my mistake.

692
01:06:33,325 --> 01:06:35,264
Listen to me, all of you.

693
01:06:35,265 --> 01:06:39,089
It's time for you to continue
your journey without me.

694
01:06:39,091 --> 01:06:41,724
I am very proud to have
been your master.

695
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:05,268
We got to get them out safely.

696
01:07:05,272 --> 01:07:07,608
Come little one, let's find your Mama.

697
01:07:07,609 --> 01:07:11,214
Viper, gather the southern farmers.
Mantis, the north.

698
01:07:11,215 --> 01:07:13,092
Crane, light the way.

699
01:07:32,027 --> 01:07:34,905
Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.

700
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,185
Hey Dad.

701
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:47,375
Po!

702
01:07:52,421 --> 01:07:55,111
It's good to have you back son.

703
01:07:57,426 --> 01:08:01,238
Good to be back.
Let's go Po.

704
01:08:03,619 --> 01:08:09,646
For our next shop, it's time to face it.
The future of noodles is diced cut vegetables.

705
01:08:09,647 --> 01:08:14,099
No longer slices.
Also, I was thinking...

706
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:19,124
... maybe this time we'll have
a kitchen you can stand up in.

707
01:08:19,125 --> 01:08:21,590
Hmm!
You like that?

708
01:08:27,517 --> 01:08:35,140
Po, I'm sorry things didn't work out.
It just wasn't meant to be.

709
01:08:38,924 --> 01:08:43,352
Po, forget everything else.
Your destiny still awaits.

710
01:08:43,366 --> 01:08:48,329
We are noodle-folk.
Broth runs deep through our veins.

711
01:08:48,454 --> 01:08:55,003
I don't know dad. Honestly,
sometimes I can't believe I'm your son.

712
01:08:57,841 --> 01:09:03,661
Po, I think it's time I told you
something I should have told you...

713
01:09:03,662 --> 01:09:06,042
... a long time ago.

714
01:09:06,221 --> 01:09:08,118
Okay.

715
01:09:08,699 --> 01:09:13,373
The secret ingredient of
my secret ingredient soup...

716
01:09:13,374 --> 01:09:19,735
Ohh...
The secret ingredient is...

717
01:09:20,401 --> 01:09:22,653
Nothing!
Hah?...

718
01:09:22,664 --> 01:09:25,197
But you heard me.
Nothing!

719
01:09:25,718 --> 01:09:28,239
There is no secret ingredient.

720
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:31,491
Wait, wait.
It's just plain old noodle soup.

721
01:09:31,492 --> 01:09:33,933
You don't add some kind
of special sauce or something.

722
01:09:33,934 --> 01:09:36,449
Don't have to.
To make something special...

723
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:39,373
...you just have to believe it is special.

724
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:52,201
There is no secret ingredient.

725
01:10:12,913 --> 01:10:15,571
I have come home, Master.

726
01:10:15,593 --> 01:10:19,333
This is no longer your home
and I am no longer your master.

727
01:10:19,438 --> 01:10:23,153
Yes, you have a new favourite.

728
01:10:23,158 --> 01:10:26,797
So where is this Po?

729
01:10:27,861 --> 01:10:32,066
Did I scare him off?
This battle is between you and me.

730
01:10:33,011 --> 01:10:38,713
So that's how it's going to be.
That is how it must be.

731
01:10:53,763 --> 01:10:56,427
I rotted in jail for 20 years...

732
01:10:56,428 --> 01:11:00,354
...because of your weakness!
Obeying your master is not weakness!

733
01:11:00,355 --> 01:11:03,581
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior!

734
01:11:03,582 --> 01:11:09,698
You always knew.
But when Oogway said otherwise...

735
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:14,727
What did you do?
What did you do!

736
01:11:17,361 --> 01:11:20,123
Nothing!
You were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior.

737
01:11:20,125 --> 01:11:23,307
That was not my fault!
Not your fault!

738
01:11:23,308 --> 01:11:25,709
Who failed my every dream?

739
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:28,219
Who told we should train
until my bones cracked?

740
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:31,509
Who denied me my destiny?!!

741
01:11:40,112 --> 01:11:43,261
It was never my decision to make!

742
01:11:48,474 --> 01:11:50,518
It is now.

743
01:11:55,419 --> 01:11:58,669
Give me the Scroll.

744
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:00,555
I would rather die!

745
01:12:51,023 --> 01:12:54,815
What I ever did,
I did to make you proud!

746
01:12:54,816 --> 01:12:58,008
Tell me how proud you are Shifu?

747
01:12:58,114 --> 01:13:02,866
Tell me!
Tell meeee!

748
01:13:12,244 --> 01:13:15,851
I...I have always
been proud of you.

749
01:13:16,871 --> 01:13:22,272
From the first moment
I have been proud of you.

750
01:13:22,919 --> 01:13:27,058
And it was my pride
that blinded me.

751
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:31,114
I love you too much
to see what you were becoming.

752
01:13:31,511 --> 01:13:36,203
What I was turning you into.

753
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:40,514
I'm... I'm sorry.

754
01:13:48,881 --> 01:13:53,628
I don't want your apology.
I want my Scroll.

755
01:13:55,137 --> 01:13:56,931
What?

756
01:13:56,581 --> 01:13:58,687
Where is it?

757
01:13:59,146 --> 01:14:03,942
Dragon Warrior has taken Scroll
half way across China by now.

758
01:14:04,755 --> 01:14:08,342
You will never see
that Scroll, Tai Lung!

759
01:14:08,384 --> 01:14:10,282
Never!

760
01:14:12,317 --> 01:14:14,245
Hey!

761
01:14:18,729 --> 01:14:20,710
...Stairs.

762
01:14:21,868 --> 01:14:24,204
Who are you?

763
01:14:24,205 --> 01:14:29,001
Buddy...
I am the Dragon Warrior.

764
01:14:31,753 --> 01:14:33,927
You?

765
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:36,060
Him?
He's a Panda.

766
01:14:36,061 --> 01:14:38,315
You're a Panda.
What are you going to do, Big Guy?

767
01:14:38,816 --> 01:14:40,584
Sit on me.

768
01:14:40,585 --> 01:14:42,566
Don't tempt me.

769
01:14:42,671 --> 01:14:46,416
Now, I'm going to use this.

770
01:14:46,851 --> 01:14:49,311
You want it. Come get it.

771
01:14:50,041 --> 01:14:51,543
Finally.

772
01:15:17,421 --> 01:15:19,799
That Scroll is mine!

773
01:16:49,968 --> 01:16:52,575
The Scroll has given him power.

774
01:17:30,861 --> 01:17:34,204
Finally.
Oh yes.

775
01:17:35,053 --> 01:17:40,516
The power of the Dragon Scroll
is mine!

776
01:17:44,729 --> 01:17:46,751
It's nothing!

777
01:17:48,857 --> 01:17:51,735
It's okay. I didn't get
it the first time either.

778
01:17:51,985 --> 01:17:57,578
What?
There is no secret ingredient.

779
01:17:59,493 --> 01:18:01,786
It's just you.

780
01:18:10,649 --> 01:18:13,720
Stop it! Ho, ho, ho.
I'm going to pee.

781
01:18:15,508 --> 01:18:19,491
Don't...don't...don't.
Ha...ha...ha...

782
01:19:26,617 --> 01:19:30,892
You can't defeat me.

783
01:19:35,292 --> 01:19:43,331
You...you're just a big
fat Panda!

784
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:45,673
I'm not a big fat Panda.

785
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:49,384
I'm the Big Fat Panda!

786
01:19:51,057 --> 01:19:54,237
The Wushi finger hold?
Oh, you know this hold.

787
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:58,040
You're bluffing. You're bluffing!
Shifu didn't teach you that!

788
01:19:58,314 --> 01:20:01,576
No, I figured it out.

789
01:20:01,577 --> 01:20:03,349
Skedush...!

790
01:20:22,775 --> 01:20:24,819
Ah... look!

791
01:20:20,249 --> 01:20:22,988
The Dragon Warrior.

792
01:20:49,806 --> 01:20:55,269
That's my boy!
The big lovely Kung Fu warrior is my son!

793
01:20:57,128 --> 01:20:59,066
Yes.

794
01:21:00,054 --> 01:21:02,567
Thanks Dad.

795
01:21:10,836 --> 01:21:13,203
Hey guys.

796
01:21:16,852 --> 01:21:20,491
Master.
Master.

797
01:21:22,566 --> 01:21:26,483
Master?
Master Shifu?

798
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:43,832
Master!
Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay?

799
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:48,382
Po.
You are alive.

800
01:21:48,383 --> 01:21:50,196
Or we are both dead.

801
01:21:50,197 --> 01:21:52,211
No Master, I didn't die.

802
01:21:52,212 --> 01:21:55,472
I defeated Tai Lung.
You did?

803
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:04,877
... Wow!
It is as Oogway foretold.

804
01:22:05,336 --> 01:22:09,173
You are the Dragon Warrior.

805
01:22:09,423 --> 01:22:14,157
You have brought peace
to this Valley.

806
01:22:17,189 --> 01:22:20,559
And to me.
Thank you.

807
01:22:21,997 --> 01:22:25,143
Thank you, Po.

808
01:22:25,144 --> 01:22:29,201
Thank you. Thank you...

809
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,124
No, Master...

810
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:38,638
No, no, no!
Don't die Shifu, please!

811
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:43,783
I'm not dying, you idiot!
Aah... Dragon Warrior...

812
01:22:44,936 --> 01:22:50,379
I'm simply at peace.
Finally.

813
01:22:51,547 --> 01:22:55,680
Oh...So I should stop talking.

814
01:22:56,072 --> 01:22:58,178
If you can.

815
01:23:15,987 --> 01:23:19,094
Do you want to get
something to eat?

816
01:23:20,324 --> 01:23:22,368
Yes
