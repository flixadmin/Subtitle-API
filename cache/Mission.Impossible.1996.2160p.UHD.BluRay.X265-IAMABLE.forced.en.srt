1
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:24,942
It was good...

2
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,821
...that you called us.

3
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,868
I don't know what happened.

4
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,871
We were at the bar...

5
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,124
...drinking...

6
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,961
...having fun...

7
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,672
I don't even know...

8
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,342
...how I got here.

9
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,933
You're the only one who can help me.

10
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,024
Come on... come on,

11
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,527
Tell me what I need to know.

12
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:09,861
Come on.

13
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,114
They'll kill me,

14
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,119
You asked for my help.

15
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,455
Come on.

16
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,628
The contact in Minsk...

17
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,593
Dimitri...

18
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:34,636
...Miediev.

19
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,569
What now?

20
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:53,989
Now we drink.
