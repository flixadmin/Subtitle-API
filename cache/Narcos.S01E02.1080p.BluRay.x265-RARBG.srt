[Speaks Spanish] What about Pablo Escobar?
He's the richest of them all.

158
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,217
Escobar gives money to the poor.

159
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,595
You're right.
Escobar is a man of the people.

160
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,013
He's all right with me.

161
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,723
Ok, then.

the day they kidnapped marta ochoa,

169
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:57,843
was also the day the lion

[Speaks Spanish] Good afternoon.

- [Steve] Si.

Does the cat have any papers?

Sir, this couple has no sanitary b-47 form

Well, I guess he's talking about puff.

184
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:53,646
[Man continues in Spanish] Yes, sir.
They brought an American cat with them.

185
00:12:54,775 --> 00:13:00,280
Sure, but without the i-435, I can't
officially state that it is indeed a cat.

186
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:06,286
I also can't guarantee
that it's American.

187
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,833
Sir, I'm not trying
to make your life more difficult.

Pablo was trying to get into politics.

When he said he was going
to be president of Colombia, he meant it.

- [Speaking Spanish] Hello, Pablo.
- Hello, Valeria.

Don't worry.
Everything will be perfect.

[Pablo] I'm just not used
to these type of things.

Just be yourself.

Ma'am, it would be best
if you weren't here.

208
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:42,174
Look, tata,
there are a lot of people here.

man known as "the Robin hood of the poor"

222
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:26,051
for his generosity
with the poor of medellin.

00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,261
[Steve]
Yeah, you heard that right.

224
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:32,099
She just compared Pablo Escobar
to fucking Robin hood.

When you've run out of ways
to hide your money,

227
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,314
that's when you give it to the poor.

228
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,441
But I don't want to get ahead of myself.

229
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:45,195
[In Spanish] Tell us about your program,
"medellin without slums," Mr. Escobar.

230
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,281
I was born in rionegro,
not too far from here.

231
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:53,078
And I asked myself how a government
that exists for the people

232
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,956
can be so out of touch
with what they need.

Hospitals, social and athletic programs,

234

plus the construction
of 400 houses in this community.

I hear you told your mother that one day
you would be president of Colombia.

Do you have any political aspirations,
Mr. Escobar?

None at all.
My business takes up most of my time.

238
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,432
I will tell you one thing, Valeria.

239
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:20,730
For decades, our country has been led by
Lopez and other families that are wealthy

240
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,567
who made their fortune
off exploiting the poor.

241
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:27,946
They don't know what
common people dream of, but I do...

00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,466
- Connie, you know who that is?
- — [Pablo continues indistinctly]

I can't believe it.

245
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,957
They don't even know
he's a fucking drug dealer.

- [Pablo] Thank you very much.

Pablo was just a blip on my radar.

I didn't know
I was about to be a blip on his.

00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,246
[Steve] Well, we've been waiting
for hours. Thanks for coming out.

Uh, my wife's a little exhausted,
so here is the cat's vaccination...

I'm sorry?

What do you do at
the United States embassy, Mr. Murphy?

257
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,972
I am in, uh,
janitorial services.

258
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,267
Janitorial services.

Your embassy must be very clean.

00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:31,194
the journalist who first
interviewed Pablo... watch out.

I'm sorry, Pablo... I'm sorry.

277
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,193
Forgive me.

278
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,825
It won't happen again.

279
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,076
I promise.

00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:34,382
How can I apologize? Huh?

281
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,524
Want to put it in my ass? Hm?

00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:56,863
[Steve]
You gotta give it to her.

who figured the best way
to get inside narco information

287
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,505
was to hang out
with the same women they did.

Don't go overboard.

It's the truth.

What can you offer me to drink?

Whiskey or tap water.

What you're missing
in this apartment is a woman.

It's fine the way it is.

00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,585
Well, I wasn't offering.

299
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,261
Here.

300
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:50,518
If you were a client,
you would have paid me already.

301

- And you wouldn't know my real name.
- — don't take it the wrong way.

302
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:01,112
It's cash from uncle Sam
for the information you never gave me.

303
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,700
Take it.

304
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:09,787
And my visa?

I can pay, too.

than uncle Sam, Javi.

00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,743
Give me a kiss.

314
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:02,257
I guess I'll have to find another girl.

315
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:06,094
Good luck with that.
We're all going to medellin.

316
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,263
Some of us are even going by plane.

317
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,142
Helena?

318
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:14,644
Helena.

319
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,024
Whose party is it?

320
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,988
[Panting]

321
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,617
- [Gunfire in distance]
- [Connie] Oh, god! What was that?

322
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:30,827
[Steve] That was like a .38.

323
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,870
- About four blocks away.
- Oh... [laughs]

324
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,378
- [Automatic gunfire outside]
- [Connie gasps]

325
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,800
[Car alarm wailing]

326
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:52,515
- Welcome to Bogota'.
- [Connie panting]

327
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:55,393
- Should we do it under the bed?
- [Laughs]

328
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,504
[Speaking Spanish] Just one thing...
Who told you about this?

329
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:27,592
Mother Teresa of Calcutta.

330
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:41,939
[Man 1 in Spanish] Pablo says they're
not going to pay a dime for marta ochoa.

331
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:43,274
Gustavo, too.

332
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:48,154
- [Man 2] And Jorge?
- [Man 1] No. Jorge doesn't agree.

333
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:51,658
- [Man 2] Then what?
- [Man 1] They're all going to a meeting.

334
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,743
At las margaritas.

335
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,496
- [Man 2] Everyone?
- [Man 1] Yeah, they'll all be there.

336
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:57,955
[Recording stops]

337
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:08,257
[Steve]
First day at the American embassy.

338
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:10,885
- I met my partner...
- Javier?

339
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,179
Who introduced me to the DEA.

340
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,022
[Javier]
Murphy, this is Weaver and wisnicki.

341
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,016
These guys are r.I.P.
"Retired in place."

342
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,018
- Eat me, pena.
- Paid vacation's over, fellas.

343
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:20,502
Murphy and I are going to medellin.

344
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:23,439
We'll telex the t-3 reports.
They go straight to Washington.

345
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,984
We are going to medellin?

346
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:31,197
- [Steve] Then the mil group.
- Jarheads... this is Murphy.

347
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,657
Murphy, this is mil group.

348
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,244
They advise Colombian military
on communist threats in the countryside.

349
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:37,704
Hey, those are classified.

350
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:40,915
- Now they're declassified.
- That's the ambassador's call.

351
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,500
No problem.

352
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,465
[Steve] And the last stop...
The ambassador's office.

353
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:50,842
Why do you need this intel?

354
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:54,887
There's an unusual number of prostitutes
headed to medellin this weekend.

355
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:56,639
Every high-end girl in Bogota'.

356
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:58,891
First class airfare,
five-star hotels.

357
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,144
The narcos are having a meeting
and then a party.

358
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:03,604
What does the m-19
have to do with this?

359
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:06,566
Somebody kidnapped marta ochoa.
Intel suggests it was m—19.

360
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:09,569
I need access to the m-19 files
to confirm.

361
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,948
If I find out one single dollar
of American taxpayer money

362
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:17,452
went to any of those hookers,
it'll be your ass.

363
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,662
Ok, thank you.
One last thing, ambassador.

364
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:20,955
Yes, agent pena?

365
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:23,764
I'm filing a visa request
for my informant. I need your signature.

366
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,501
You're bothering me.

367
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:29,547
She sure likes you.

368
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,382
Is your informant really a prostitute?

369
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:33,259
Everybody works for somebody.

370
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:44,103
[Steve] The very next day,
I was flying with pena to medellin,

371
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:45,938
Pablo's home turf.

372
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:58,326
First stop: Carlos holguin school,
colonel Carrillo's base of operations.

373
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:11,589
- [Speaking Spanish] Good day, major.
- Good day.

374
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:16,594
Your intel was good. The traquetos
are gathering at las margaritas.

375
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:20,515
[Speaking English] I want you
to meet our new DEA, Steve Murphy.

376
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:22,225
[Speaking Spanish] Fresh meat.

377
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:29,607
[Steve] Then we went straight to a fancy
hotel where the narcos were about to meet.

378
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:36,322
The pictures I took that day
helped to ID guys for months to come.

379
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,786
- There was Carlos lehder...
- [Camera shutter clicks]

380
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,416
- [Shutter clicks]
- The ochoa brothers...

381
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,383
Fernando galeano, "the wolfman

382
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:08,604
Is that gacha?

383
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:12,066
I've never seen him
with other traffickers.

384
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:18,739
[Steve] And last but not least...
Gustavo and Pablo.

385
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:22,660
Get pictures of that fucker.

386
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:26,038
[Indistinct chatter in Spanish]

387
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:31,419
[Steve] They were all under one roof
and pena got us there to document it all.

388
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,796
[Shutter clicks]

389
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:39,719
What we didn't know was
that we were witnessing the formation

390
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:41,888
of the famed medellin cartel.

391
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:45,766
Pablo took advantage
of the kidnapping of marta ochoa

392
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:49,228
to bring all the narcos together
for the very first time.

393
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:53,357
And then he proclaimed himself
their leader.

394
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:58,529
[Speaking Spanish]
What I propose at this moment, gentlemen,

395
00:28:58,613 --> 00:29:02,491
is that we form an organization.

396
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:09,582
Pool our resources to train soldiers,
trade knowledge and buy information.

397
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:15,713
And so the message is clear,
we're going to name our group

398
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:18,049
"death to kidnappers."

399
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:20,134
[Appreciative murmurs]

400
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:21,886
What I propose:

401
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:25,723
I will manage all operational aspects.

402
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:28,392
All you need to do
is cover my expenses.

403
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:34,440
What you gentlemen will receive in return:
Two things.

404
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,568
One... I promise to end the kidnapping.

405
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:42,114
Two... and at this moment,
the most important...

406
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,411
I promise to return
marta ochoa to her family.

407
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,081
- [Overlapping murmurs]
- [Man] Salud.

408
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:53,668
[All] Death to kidnappers!

409
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,256
[Up-tempo music playing]

410
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,134
[Steve] We knew the meeting was over
when the hookers came to play.

411
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:05,554
Pefia had finally
gotten one of his informants

412
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,556
right into the heart of the action.

413
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:12,436
[Man speaking Spanish]
Come in! Enjoy! Ooh!

414
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,481
Don't forget la quica!
Take care of him, too.

415
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:22,196
Sit down, my love.

416
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:27,493
- How are you? — good. And you?

417
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,537
I like your hat.

418
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,455
It looks good on you.

419
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,958
- Do you think so?
- Yes, it looks good.

420
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,292
Let's see.

421
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:39,046
- Very cute.
- [Indistinct chatter]

422
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:47,471
[Speaking English]
She should be here by now.

423
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:49,974
You think she slipped?

424
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,143
Nah, she's no dummy.

425
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,566
Maybe she's getting pretty for you.

426
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:04,405
[Gacha grunting]

427
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:16,292
Aah... [groans]

428
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:19,795
[Steve]
Helena wanted a us visa so bad,

429
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:22,715
she was willing to do anything
to help our cause.

430
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:25,634
And that was a problem.

431
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:30,181
- [Speaking Spanish] You're tired.
- Hm?

432
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,225
Let me relax you a bit.

433
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:42,026
So what happened at that meeting
that made you so tired?

434
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:49,408
What did you hear?

435
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:51,786
Nothing.
Just making conversation.

436
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,457
[Carrillo speaking English] They're
telling me the girl left a long time ago.

437
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:05,758
- She's already dead.
- — no, they wouldn't kill her at the hotel.

438
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,551
Then they killed her somewhere else.

439
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:09,428
She knew the risks.

440
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:11,472
If we're going back,
we go back now.

441
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,398
[Speaking Spanish]
I want you to find the girl.

442
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,064
I can pick up a sicario.
You ok with that?

443
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:22,149
- I'm going with you.
- — what about fresh meat?

444
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:24,628
[In English] Gonna stick around here
and see if she shows up, ok?

445
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:27,488
- Yeah, and where are you going?
- We're gonna go look for her.

446
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,073
[Speaking Spanish]
That's it, guys.

447

- [Men chattering in Spanish, laughing]
- — [breath trembling]

448
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,341
- Guys.
- Hey, what happened?

449
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,677
That little girl doesn't move.
Like a dead cow.

450
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,137
What, did you kill her?

451
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:53,514
[Overlapping chatter in Spanish]

- Where's the girl, asshole?
- [Whispers] I don't know.

456
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:28,257
[Panting] I don't know.

457
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:30,801
[Carrillo] Choke him.

Gacha wants to know
if she knows something.

I don't like them bruised.
