1
00:00:15,572 --> 00:00:18,074
Are you okay?

2
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,335
- You are a lifesaver.
- Yeah, man.

3
00:01:52,502 --> 00:01:55,171
- We can't thank you enough.
- No, hey, mad props.

4
00:01:55,338 --> 00:01:57,238
I could have sworn the guy said south.

5
00:01:57,424 --> 00:02:00,009
But then all of a sudden
we're off the main road.

6
00:02:00,176 --> 00:02:03,226
I'm trying to read the map while
driving, a bonehead maneuver.

7
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:06,307
And then all of a sudden, bam,
we're in that ditch.

8
00:02:06,474 --> 00:02:09,018
Yeah, bam. I'm like,
"What the hell?" You know?

9
00:02:09,185 --> 00:02:12,897
Yes. Oh, yes, and my coffee mug.
Of coffee? My mug of coffee.

10
00:02:13,064 --> 00:02:16,860
It spills all over my pants, I mean...
Just a nightmare.

11
00:02:17,026 --> 00:02:20,029
There's your Sony GPS, I mean, for real.

12
00:02:34,377 --> 00:02:36,171
Let's just...

13
00:02:42,677 --> 00:02:47,390
Like I said,
we couldn't be more grateful.

14
00:03:02,363 --> 00:03:04,365
Can't we just dump them here?

15
00:03:04,532 --> 00:03:06,409
What, and somebody finds them?

16
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:07,619
Then what?

17
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:10,287
People have seen us.

18
00:03:16,085 --> 00:03:17,685
Hey, you're gonna flood it, man.

19
00:03:17,796 --> 00:03:20,596
I'm not gonna flood it.
She's not gonna flood, all right?

20
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:23,092
We're just gonna stay positive, right?

21
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:24,886
We're gonna clean up this mess.

22
00:03:25,053 --> 00:03:26,930
And you, start.

23
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,432
Goddamn it. See, you flooded it.

24
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,934
All right.

25
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,646
All right. You know what?
The RV is going to start now.

26
00:03:34,813 --> 00:03:36,563
The RV is going to start right now.

27
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:39,233
It's gonna start.
We're gonna drive it to your house.

28
00:03:39,317 --> 00:03:40,517
- My house?
- Your house.

29
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,237
We're gonna drive it over there
and park it overnight.

30
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:45,740
- And then tomorrow...
- Man, not my house.

31
00:03:45,907 --> 00:03:49,536
Shut up. Shut up.

32
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,634
After we finish cleaning up this mess

33
00:04:05,093 --> 00:04:06,928
we will go our separate ways.

34
00:04:07,095 --> 00:04:09,973
Our paths will never cross.

35
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:12,433
And we will tell this to no one.

36
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,435
Understood?

37
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,773
Oh, what, I can talk now?

38
00:04:19,816 --> 00:04:24,279
Fine. That goes double for me.

39
00:04:27,365 --> 00:04:30,159
Okay. Okay.

40
00:04:30,326 --> 00:04:32,161
Be good to me.

41
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,085
Yes!

42
00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:46,342
Yes. Okay. Okay.

43
00:04:46,843 --> 00:04:47,969
Thank you.

44
00:05:07,697 --> 00:05:09,616
Oh, shit.

45
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:38,394
Walt?

46
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:42,732
You coming out?

47
00:05:51,157 --> 00:05:53,618
{\an8}Yeah, absolutely.

48
00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:56,579
<i>We've got looky-loos
in both directions, Dan.</i>

49
00:05:56,788 --> 00:05:59,248
<i>Better plan on being late
if you're going to work.</i>

50
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:04,045
<i>This is Lisa in the Skycopter, we'll have
more Albuquerque traffic on the hour.</i>

51
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:08,257
{\an8}Hey, you wanna hear something funny?

52
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:13,012
{\an8}We had a faculty meeting last Thursday,

53
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:16,849
{\an8}and the topic was senior-class photos,

54
00:06:17,058 --> 00:06:19,644
{\an8}and how we had instituted
a new rule last year

55
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:22,772
{\an8}that seniors are allowed
to have photos taken

56
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:25,149
by a photographer of their choice.

57
00:06:25,316 --> 00:06:27,777
{\an8}You know, not necessarily
the photographer

58
00:06:27,944 --> 00:06:30,655
{\an8}that the school hires, right? So...

59
00:06:32,073 --> 00:06:35,492
{\an8}So anyway, some of the senior girls

60
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,790
{\an8}were going to that Glamour Shots
place to have their photos taken.

61
00:06:40,957 --> 00:06:44,377
{\an8}And now they're bringing us
all these photos,

62
00:06:44,585 --> 00:06:46,503
and Joan Everman...
You know Joan.

63
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:48,881
...suddenly has to go through
all the photos...

64
00:06:48,965 --> 00:06:52,677
{\an8}...and turn them down
because they show cleavage.

65
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,641
Did you get enough pancakes, sweetie?

66
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,810
Yeah. I'm good.

67
00:07:00,977 --> 00:07:02,145
Okay.

68
00:07:02,311 --> 00:07:06,691
You know, even the
small-busted girls have cleavage.

69
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:13,031
Apparently there's some new type of
brassiere or something.

70
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:14,866
The Wonderbra.

71
00:07:15,992 --> 00:07:18,161
It's the Wonderbra.

72
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:19,912
Yeah?

73
00:07:20,663 --> 00:07:22,707
Okay.

74
00:07:26,252 --> 00:07:29,589
{\an8}<i>Hey there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter Jr.</i>

75
00:07:29,756 --> 00:07:33,176
{\an8}<i>We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave us a message.</i>

76
00:07:33,342 --> 00:07:36,721
<i>Hello, Mr. White.
This is AT&T calling.</i>

77
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:40,016
<i>Are you happy with your current
long-distance service?</i>

78
00:07:40,183 --> 00:07:43,333
<i>Because if you're not,
I would definitely really, really love</i>

79
00:07:43,436 --> 00:07:45,688
<i>to talk to you
as soon as possible about...</i>

80
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:47,732
Hello, this is Walter White speaking.

81
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:49,942
You said he was practically dead, okay?

82
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:51,801
You said he would die any minute.

83
00:07:51,944 --> 00:07:55,239
{\an8}Listen, I am having breakfast
with my family right now,

84
00:07:55,406 --> 00:07:58,367
{\an8}and I really don't appreciate
these sales calls.

85
00:07:58,534 --> 00:08:00,953
{\an8}<i>Well, too bad, man, because guess what.</i>

86
00:08:01,162 --> 00:08:02,371
{\an8}<i>He's still not dead.</i>

87
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:04,248
I went and put my ear to the RV.

88
00:08:04,415 --> 00:08:07,460
I can hear him, like,
rolling around in there, all right?

89
00:08:07,668 --> 00:08:10,922
I think he's awake, man.
I think he's trying to get loose.

90
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:13,339
<i>Where the hell are you?
I'm freaking out here.</i>

91
00:08:13,424 --> 00:08:16,219
- Calm down, damn it.
<i>- You gonna help me clean this up?</i>

92
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:19,472
{\an8}- We got loose ends here.
- Calm down.

93
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,265
{\an8}I will be there after school.

94
00:08:21,432 --> 00:08:23,559
{\an8}<i>After school. Are you shitting me?</i>

95
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,728
Ditch it, man. Call in sick.

96
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:28,564
{\an8}Listen, that is just
not gonna work for me.

97
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:30,431
{\an8}I'm not interested in that at all.

98
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:33,903
And I would appreciate it
if you don't call here anymore.

99
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,615
{\an8}Damn. They're so annoying,
those people.

100
00:08:41,744 --> 00:08:45,248
{\an8}- You have a good day, sweetie.
- Okay, Mom. You too.

101
00:08:45,414 --> 00:08:47,125
Bye, honey.

102
00:08:51,754 --> 00:08:54,090
{\an8}- Drive safe.
- Okay.

103
00:09:05,977 --> 00:09:11,274
{\an8}<i>Yo, yo, yo, 1, 4, 8, 3 to the 3
to the 6 to the 9, representing the ABQ.</i>

104
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,111
<i>What up, beyotch?
Leave it at the tone.</i>

105
00:09:30,126 --> 00:09:33,963
So the term "chiral"

106
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,466
derives from the
Greek word "hand."

107
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:43,639
Now, the concept here being that just
as your left hand and your right hand

108
00:09:43,806 --> 00:09:48,311
are mirror images of one another,
right, identical and yet opposite

109
00:09:48,644 --> 00:09:51,355
well, so, too,
organic compounds can exist

110
00:09:51,522 --> 00:09:55,318
as mirror-image forms of one another

111
00:09:55,484 --> 00:09:57,569
all the way down at the molecular level.

112
00:09:57,653 --> 00:10:01,324
But although they may look the same

113
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:04,827
they don't always behave the same.

114
00:10:04,994 --> 00:10:07,163
For instance...

115
00:10:09,832 --> 00:10:11,584
For instance.

116
00:10:13,377 --> 00:10:15,922
I'm sorry. For instance...

117
00:10:16,088 --> 00:10:17,673
Thalidomide.

118
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,595
The right-handed isomer
of the drug thalidomide

119
00:10:22,803 --> 00:10:24,803
is a perfectly fine, good medicine

120
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:27,850
to give to a pregnant woman
to prevent morning sickness.

121
00:10:28,017 --> 00:10:31,729
But make the mistake of giving
that same pregnant woman

122
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:36,275
the left-handed isomer
of the drug thalidomide,

123
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:42,114
and her child will be born
with horrible birth defects.

124
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:46,702
Which is precisely what happened
in the 1950s.

125
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:53,042
So chiral, chirality,
mirrored images, right?

126
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:57,755
Active, inactive, good, bad.

127
00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:02,468
So.

128
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:05,471
- Yes, Ben.
- Is this gonna be on the murder?

129
00:11:08,391 --> 00:11:09,475
What?

130
00:11:09,642 --> 00:11:12,103
Is this gonna be on the midterm?

131
00:11:15,398 --> 00:11:18,234
Chirality on the midterm?
No, no. Well, maybe.

132
00:11:18,401 --> 00:11:22,613
Maybe. Yes, you know...
But prepare for it to be on the midterm.

133
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:25,074
Can't hurt to know it, right? So...

134
00:11:25,241 --> 00:11:27,493
Knowledge is power.

135
00:12:42,943 --> 00:12:45,571
Oh, no. Oh, no, no. No.

136
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:54,997
Not good. Not good, not good.

137
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,518
What the...?

138
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:38,791
Hey. Hey. Hey, you.

139
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:40,793
Hey, listen, you.

140
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:42,711
No, no, no!

141
00:13:46,882 --> 00:13:48,217
Oh, God.

142
00:14:33,053 --> 00:14:34,430
Okay.

143
00:14:50,613 --> 00:14:52,573
MILFs?

144
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,075
The hell is a MILF?

145
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:16,680
Now what?

146
00:15:20,434 --> 00:15:22,436
Lock the other one out in the RV.

147
00:15:22,603 --> 00:15:24,355
He's:

148
00:15:24,522 --> 00:15:25,689
- You're sure?
- Yes.

149
00:15:25,898 --> 00:15:27,524
- You're positive?
- You know what?

150
00:15:27,608 --> 00:15:30,277
- Feel free to go check.
- Good idea. Maybe I should

151
00:15:30,444 --> 00:15:32,737
before he, too, wanders off
down the street.

152
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:35,282
- Okay, you know what? I am sick...
- All right.

153
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:36,825
Just...

154
00:15:36,992 --> 00:15:39,828
The one downstairs, tell me about him.

155
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:43,499
Oh, come on. Anything. Something.
Start with his name, at least.

156
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,000
Krazy-8.

157
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:47,795
Krazy-8.
What the hell does that even mean?

158
00:15:47,962 --> 00:15:52,633
I don't know, man, okay? It means,
like, Krazy-8, okay? I don't know.

159
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,719
So you work with him regularly.

160
00:15:55,928 --> 00:15:57,888
No, not him so much.

161
00:15:58,055 --> 00:16:00,808
- His cousin, mainly.
- Who's his cousin?

162
00:16:00,975 --> 00:16:03,875
- The guy out in the RV.
- All right, all right, all right.

163
00:16:03,978 --> 00:16:06,522
Krazy-8's one level higher.

164
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:08,190
One level higher.

165
00:16:08,357 --> 00:16:12,027
Yeah, you know.
Not, like, street level. Higher.

166
00:16:12,194 --> 00:16:15,072
You know how there's, like,
a Starbucks on every corner?

167
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:18,909
Krazy-8 is like the dude that sells
Starbucks' beans.

168
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:20,703
Okay, so he's a distributor.

169
00:16:22,496 --> 00:16:26,333
Okay, so is he...? I mean, is...?

170
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,088
In other words,
what is his reputation for violence?

171
00:16:31,755 --> 00:16:36,510
Well, he did try to kill us both
yesterday, so there's that.

172
00:16:36,677 --> 00:16:40,014
Look, what I'm trying to say
is that he's a distributor, right?

173
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,684
He's a businessman.
He's a man of business.

174
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:46,144
It would therefore
seem to follow that he is

175
00:16:46,228 --> 00:16:50,024
capable of acting out of
mutual self-interest, yes?

176
00:16:50,691 --> 00:16:51,734
What?

177
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,614
Do you think he is capable
of listening to reason?

178
00:16:57,698 --> 00:17:00,617
What kind of reason? You mean,
"Dear Krazy-8, hey, listen"

179
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:04,451
if I let you go, you promise not to
come back and waste my entire family?

180
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,957
No Colombian neckties?"
That kind of reason?

181
00:17:07,124 --> 00:17:10,919
No, man, I can't say as I have high
fucking hopes where that's concerned.

182
00:17:17,217 --> 00:17:18,927
What was that?

183
00:17:19,553 --> 00:17:21,096
What was what?

184
00:17:28,437 --> 00:17:30,105
We didn't tie him up.

185
00:17:30,272 --> 00:17:33,067
- Why the hell didn't we tie him up?
- Oh, God.

186
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:36,904
- Because he was out cold.
- Yeah, but what if he's faking it?

187
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:41,408
You know, like, if it was me,
I'd be all faking being knocked out, yo.

188
00:17:41,617 --> 00:17:46,080
And then, when the coast is clear,
I'd be up looking for weapons and shit.

189
00:17:46,246 --> 00:17:48,415
Ready to pounce.

190
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:13,806
No, see. Now, if it was me,

191
00:18:13,941 --> 00:18:16,485
and I couldn't find
a decent enough weapon

192
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:20,322
I would just lie back down
and bide my time.

193
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:16,503
So now what do we do?

194
00:19:20,257 --> 00:19:27,014
You keep asking me that
like you think I have some answer.

195
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:30,058
- Well, you gotta do something.
- We.

196
00:19:30,225 --> 00:19:33,520
We have got to do something,
and I am open to suggestions.

197
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:36,190
Man, okay,
this whole thing was your deal.

198
00:19:36,356 --> 00:19:38,192
Don't you dare put that on me.

199
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:41,695
You brought those guys out there.
This is your responsibility.

200
00:19:41,862 --> 00:19:44,198
Like I came to you, begging to cook meth.

201
00:19:44,364 --> 00:19:48,786
"Oh, hey, nerdiest old dude I know,
you wanna come cook crystal?" Please.

202
00:19:48,952 --> 00:19:50,704
I'd ask my diaper-wearing granny,

203
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:53,665
but her wheelchair wouldn't fit
in the RV.

204
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,883
What about the phosphate gas?

205
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,552
Phosphine gas. What about it?

206
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:08,388
I mean, do you think
it still might kill him?

207
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:11,205
You know, with, like,
a delayed reaction or something?

208
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:14,895
I don't know.

209
00:20:15,062 --> 00:20:17,564
- You're supposed to be a scientist.
- Look.

210
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:22,069
This isn't even the issue
that demands immediate attention.

211
00:20:22,236 --> 00:20:25,656
We have got a body in that RV.
And it's getting warmer outside.

212
00:20:25,823 --> 00:20:27,115
Understand?

213
00:20:27,282 --> 00:20:30,577
And we have got to
do something about that soon.

214
00:20:30,744 --> 00:20:32,996
And in a way that
no one will ever find it.

215
00:20:33,205 --> 00:20:38,001
Now, that last part
is very, very important.

216
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:43,131
Therefore, it seems to me

217
00:20:43,298 --> 00:20:48,929
that our best course of action
would be chemical disincorporation.

218
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:55,227
Dissolving in strong acid.

219
00:21:01,942 --> 00:21:04,778
Oh, man, that's messed up.

220
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:08,949
I mean, you're not serious.

221
00:21:11,118 --> 00:21:12,870
You serious?

222
00:21:19,835 --> 00:21:21,795
Well, who's gonna do that?

223
00:21:21,962 --> 00:21:23,881
And don't look at me.

224
00:21:26,383 --> 00:21:28,302
I guess we'll both do it together.

225
00:21:28,468 --> 00:21:31,638
No, Mr. White, okay,
I'm not good with dead bodies.

226
00:21:32,306 --> 00:21:37,060
Look, we are in this fifty-fifty. Okay?

227
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:45,152
I guess the only other fair way
to go about this would be

228
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:50,324
that one of us deals with
the body situation

229
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:56,830
while the other one of us deals with
the Krazy-8 situation.

230
00:22:03,921 --> 00:22:07,424
In a scenario like this,
I don't suppose it is bad form

231
00:22:07,591 --> 00:22:12,054
to just flip a coin.

232
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:23,439
- Heads or tails?
- No, I'll do the body in the acid, okay?

233
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:26,401
Heads or tails?

234
00:22:34,534 --> 00:22:37,371
Heads. Heads.

235
00:22:54,972 --> 00:22:57,140
Best two out of three?

236
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:19,079
<i>Yo, yo, yo, 1, 4, 8, 3 to the 3
to the 6 to the 9, representing the ABQ.</i>

237
00:23:19,287 --> 00:23:22,916
<i>What up, beyotch?
Leave it at the tone.</i>

238
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:26,670
<i>Hey, Mr. White, it's me. Pick up.</i>

239
00:23:26,837 --> 00:23:29,548
<i>I got a container question.</i>

240
00:23:30,506 --> 00:23:33,552
<i>Hello, Mr. White.
Pick up the phone, man.</i>

241
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:36,054
- Yes.
- Yo, what kind of plastic, man?

242
00:23:36,221 --> 00:23:39,349
<i>Polyethylene.</i>

243
00:23:39,891 --> 00:23:41,891
How the hell am I supposed to know that?

244
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:43,519
Because I told you.

245
00:23:43,687 --> 00:23:50,360
Look, just look at the bottom
for a triangle

246
00:23:50,526 --> 00:23:52,863
stamped LDPE.

247
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,906
<i>It should be molded into the plastic.</i>

248
00:23:55,073 --> 00:23:57,617
Yeah, yeah, yeah, LDPE.
Right on, got it.

249
00:23:57,826 --> 00:24:02,122
I don't know, man.
This feels kind of flimsy.

250
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,833
Any decent acid's
gonna eat right through this.

251
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,543
- Not hydrofluoric.
- Why not?

252
00:24:09,755 --> 00:24:14,051
Look, you skipped, clowned around,

253
00:24:14,217 --> 00:24:17,929
or otherwise jerked off
through every lecture I ever gave.

254
00:24:18,096 --> 00:24:21,391
As far as I'm concerned,
your chemistry education is over.

255
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:25,062
Oh, okay, be a dick about it. Jesus.

256
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:31,735
So, hey, have you done the thing?

257
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:39,951
Yeah, I'm working up to it.

258
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:47,250
You know what?
I bet he doesn't even wake up.

259
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:51,296
You know, not even if you took him
to the hospital right now.

260
00:24:52,172 --> 00:24:54,822
Now, if it was me,
I would just try and think of it

261
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:58,594
like I was doing him a favor.

262
00:25:23,662 --> 00:25:26,665
<i>I need a check approval
on checkstand eight.</i>

263
00:25:26,832 --> 00:25:30,710
<i>Approval on checkstand eight, please.
Thank you.</i>

264
00:25:43,682 --> 00:25:45,433
Yeah.

265
00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:12,562
Who's there?

266
00:27:16,524 --> 00:27:19,277
What, you fucking break in?
Show me who's there.

267
00:27:23,573 --> 00:27:25,951
Yeah. I see you.

268
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,413
What you gonna do?

269
00:27:32,082 --> 00:27:33,166
Hey.

270
00:27:34,626 --> 00:27:36,044
Hey...!

271
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,550
Hey.

272
00:27:43,176 --> 00:27:45,303
I need water.

273
00:27:46,263 --> 00:27:48,265
Hey, hello.

274
00:27:49,474 --> 00:27:51,977
Bring me some water, would you?

275
00:27:54,062 --> 00:27:55,771
Please.

276
00:29:10,221 --> 00:29:12,223
You don't like the crust?

277
00:29:24,027 --> 00:29:25,277
Where's my cousin Emilio?

278
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:32,202
He dead?

279
00:29:55,934 --> 00:29:58,228
Oh, I'm a coward.

280
00:31:25,773 --> 00:31:30,487
Hey, Mr. White. Hey, Mr. White?

281
00:31:31,488 --> 00:31:32,655
Oh, fuck.

282
00:31:36,326 --> 00:31:40,330
Are you smoking weed? Oh, my God.

283
00:31:40,788 --> 00:31:43,208
Wait a minute, is that my weed?

284
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:48,838
What the hell, man? Make yourself
at home, why don't you?

285
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:56,346
- So, what'd you end up buying?
- Nothing.

286
00:31:57,847 --> 00:32:01,851
No store in town sells a plastic bin
big enough for a body.

287
00:32:03,228 --> 00:32:06,773
I don't suppose you could buy two bins?

288
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,860
And just:

289
00:32:11,194 --> 00:32:13,613
Legs in one, torso in the other?

290
00:32:13,821 --> 00:32:16,616
Oh, God.

291
00:32:17,033 --> 00:32:20,203
I don't suppose you could kiss my ass?

292
00:32:28,461 --> 00:32:30,421
So

293
00:32:31,714 --> 00:32:33,633
How'd it go?

294
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:44,310
- You didn't do it?
- Not yet.

295
00:32:44,477 --> 00:32:48,231
Oh, God.

296
00:32:49,566 --> 00:32:52,360
- Oh, damn. I gotta go.
- Hey, hey.

297
00:32:52,569 --> 00:32:55,446
What? No, no, no. Come back here.

298
00:32:55,613 --> 00:32:59,075
- Sorry. I'll do it tomorrow, I promise.
- Tomorrow.

299
00:32:59,284 --> 00:33:01,434
I've got a doctor's appointment.
I gotta go.

300
00:33:01,578 --> 00:33:04,956
Look, stay away from him.
He's awake.

301
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:10,587
Hey, man, we flipped a coin.

302
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:14,591
We flipped a coin.

303
00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:22,181
We're good?

304
00:33:22,473 --> 00:33:26,936
We're very good.
We're excellent, I'd say.

305
00:33:29,522 --> 00:33:35,486
Oh, would you look at that face?
Smile, peanut.

306
00:33:39,157 --> 00:33:41,784
So who's up for knowing?

307
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,206
It's...

308
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:49,709
Yeah.

309
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:52,795
- Girl.
- Girl?

310
00:33:52,962 --> 00:33:56,049
- You sure?
- Pretty sure.

311
00:33:59,927 --> 00:34:02,889
Oh, God. Can I tell you,
that's exactly what I was hoping.

312
00:34:03,056 --> 00:34:04,807
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

313
00:34:04,974 --> 00:34:07,977
You remember you said that
when she's 16 and starts dating.

314
00:34:09,187 --> 00:34:12,815
Looking fabulous. Let me see
if they're done with the blood sugar

315
00:34:12,982 --> 00:34:16,486
then we'll get you out of here.
I'll be right back.

316
00:34:43,471 --> 00:34:45,765
Who's Jesse Pinkman?

317
00:34:52,522 --> 00:34:56,401
- Jesse...?
- Jesse Pinkman.

318
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,780
He called just this morning.

319
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:03,741
- Walt, please don't deny it.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

320
00:35:03,908 --> 00:35:07,537
It says on his MyShout page
he attended Wynne.

321
00:35:07,704 --> 00:35:10,540
- Was he one of your students?
- Yeah.

322
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:14,293
He was nobody.

323
00:35:15,586 --> 00:35:20,049
Who is he to you? Why is he calling?
What is this big secret

324
00:35:20,216 --> 00:35:25,096
you seem to be discussing
with some druggie burnout?

325
00:35:27,765 --> 00:35:31,561
You don't come home last night until 2
in the morning. You don't tell me

326
00:35:31,728 --> 00:35:37,233
where you've been. You spent
the entire night in the bathroom, Walt.

327
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:43,281
Tell me what's going on with you.
Don't you think you owe me that?

328
00:35:46,576 --> 00:35:49,579
Who is this Jesse Pinkman to you?

329
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:56,669
He sells me pot.

330
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:04,093
- He sells you pot?
- Marijuana, yeah.

331
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:08,765
Not a lot. I mean, I don't know.

332
00:36:10,141 --> 00:36:12,477
I kind of like it.

333
00:36:12,643 --> 00:36:17,607
Are you out of your mind?
What are you, like, 16 years old?

334
00:36:17,774 --> 00:36:22,945
Your brother-in-law is a DEA agent.
What is wrong with you?

335
00:36:23,362 --> 00:36:27,074
Look, Skyler...

336
00:36:30,453 --> 00:36:34,957
I just haven't quite been myself lately.

337
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:40,213
- Yeah. No shit. Thanks for noticing.
- I haven't been myself lately,

338
00:36:40,379 --> 00:36:42,507
but I love you.

339
00:36:43,132 --> 00:36:48,471
Nothing about that has changed.
Nothing ever will.

340
00:36:48,638 --> 00:36:51,641
So right now, what I need

341
00:36:51,808 --> 00:36:56,145
is for you to climb down out of my ass.

342
00:36:59,148 --> 00:37:03,152
Can you do that?
Will you do that for me, honey?

343
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:08,825
Will you please, just once,
get off my ass?

344
00:37:09,325 --> 00:37:10,827
You know.

345
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,498
I'd appreciate it. I really would.

346
00:37:35,434 --> 00:37:36,769
Stop.

347
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,075
Stop in 15 minutes.

348
00:38:17,393 --> 00:38:19,645
<i>Your face is too sharp.</i>

349
00:38:24,984 --> 00:38:30,656
<i>Powder. Powder!
Take a powder, go on.</i>

350
00:38:33,534 --> 00:38:37,830
<i>Nice. Beautiful talcum powder.
Lucky you, number eight.</i>

351
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:43,711
Just meat, it's all just a bunch of meat.

352
00:38:50,343 --> 00:38:52,845
Oh, Jesus.

353
00:38:56,766 --> 00:38:58,434
You're cool, you're cool.

354
00:38:58,643 --> 00:39:03,022
You're all good, you're all...
You're all good. You know it.

355
00:39:03,189 --> 00:39:08,361
It's fine. It's just a bunch of meat.
Come on. You're good.

356
00:39:30,675 --> 00:39:31,884
Excuse me.

357
00:39:33,302 --> 00:39:38,891
Excuse me. You. Yes, you.
May I talk to you?

358
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:43,771
Hey, hey, hey.
This is private property.

359
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,880
- Just a minute. I wanna talk to you.
- No, not interested.

360
00:39:46,983 --> 00:39:51,070
- Come on.
- Hey, don't touch me. Do not touch me.

361
00:39:51,237 --> 00:39:53,387
All right. Look, not touching.
Not touching.

362
00:39:53,489 --> 00:39:56,242
Look, lady, whatever you're selling,
I ain't buying, yo.

363
00:39:56,409 --> 00:40:03,082
Well, my name is Skyler White, yo.
My husband is Walter White, yo.

364
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,210
He told me everything.

365
00:40:06,919 --> 00:40:09,422
- Seriously?
- That's right.

366
00:40:09,755 --> 00:40:15,928
And just so you know,
my brother-in-law is a DEA agent,

367
00:40:16,095 --> 00:40:21,934
and I will not hesitate to call him.
Not if I have to. Understood?

368
00:40:22,768 --> 00:40:26,272
This is your one and only warning.

369
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:30,484
Do not sell marijuana to my husband.

370
00:40:32,653 --> 00:40:36,615
- Okay.
- I mean it. Don't call our house again.

371
00:40:36,782 --> 00:40:41,328
You stay away from him,
or you will be one sorry individual.

372
00:40:42,621 --> 00:40:46,876
- You get me?
- I think so, yeah.

373
00:40:47,043 --> 00:40:50,796
No more marijuana. I can dig it.

374
00:40:51,255 --> 00:40:54,341
You can dig it. Wonderful.

375
00:41:05,144 --> 00:41:08,344
Not that it's any of my business,
but you might wanna consider

376
00:41:08,481 --> 00:41:10,483
a different line of work.

377
00:41:11,025 --> 00:41:12,651
Okay.

378
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:10,251
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's go to your house, you know.

379
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:17,591
Makes perfect sense. Let's
completely screw up your house,

380
00:42:17,758 --> 00:42:22,555
so you never wanna spend another
night in it. Sure. You know, why not?

381
00:42:27,393 --> 00:42:30,896
Yeah, and how's about
I send over my psycho-bitch wife

382
00:42:31,063 --> 00:42:33,858
to, you know, break your balls
and threaten you?

383
00:42:34,066 --> 00:42:36,016
God, that would be hilarious, you know.

384
00:42:36,152 --> 00:42:38,552
And then, you know,
the killer in the basement

385
00:42:38,654 --> 00:42:41,782
the one who's completely
my responsibility

386
00:42:41,949 --> 00:42:45,244
hell, let's just let him live down there.

387
00:42:45,411 --> 00:42:50,958
Just, I don't know, make sure
to feed him, like, three times a day.

388
00:42:52,585 --> 00:42:57,256
Sure, why not? It's been really amazing.
Thank you so much for the opportunity.

389
00:42:57,673 --> 00:43:02,094
I always dreamt about, I don't know,
melting bodies.

390
00:43:25,284 --> 00:43:27,786
You got a brother in the goddamn DEA?

391
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:33,292
- What?
- You said you were

392
00:43:33,459 --> 00:43:38,130
just doing some ride-along. Yes or
no, do you have a brother in the DEA?

393
00:43:38,797 --> 00:43:42,968
- He's a brother-in-law.
- Well, there's a load off my mind.

394
00:43:43,177 --> 00:43:44,377
Where did you hear that?

395
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:48,474
Your freaking wife told me
when she was here all up in my shit.

396
00:43:48,807 --> 00:43:52,519
Yeah, that's right.
She almost caught me moving Emilio.

397
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,814
Good job on
wearing the pants in the family.

398
00:43:56,357 --> 00:43:59,068
And why'd you go and tell her
I was selling you weed?

399
00:44:00,653 --> 00:44:03,072
Because somehow it seemed preferable

400
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:07,701
to admitting that I cook crystal meth
and killed a man.

401
00:44:16,335 --> 00:44:17,753
Is that what I think it is?

402
00:44:18,003 --> 00:44:21,674
Yeah. Yeah, it is. I smoked a bowl.
So what? My house, my rules.

403
00:44:22,216 --> 00:44:24,176
Hey, no, no.
Don't give me that, okay?

404
00:44:24,343 --> 00:44:28,847
I held up my end. I already took care of
Emilio. You're still diddling around

405
00:44:29,014 --> 00:44:31,564
- trying to get your nut up.
- Yeah, well, boo-hoo.

406
00:44:31,684 --> 00:44:33,686
I have the truly awful job here.

407
00:44:33,852 --> 00:44:35,896
You wanna talk awful?
You wanna go there?

408
00:44:36,063 --> 00:44:40,234
Try dragging 200 pounds of stink
up a flight of stairs.

409
00:44:40,401 --> 00:44:42,695
I barely got him in the bathtub.

410
00:44:43,112 --> 00:44:46,282
Bathtub, what...?
What do you mean, bathtub?

411
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:49,076
Another thing. Why you got me
running around town

412
00:44:49,243 --> 00:44:51,643
trying to find
some stupid piece of plastic

413
00:44:51,745 --> 00:44:54,039
when I have a perfectly good tub
I can use?

414
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:00,212
Oh, God.

415
00:45:00,921 --> 00:45:02,881
Hey. Hey.

416
00:45:57,603 --> 00:46:01,148
I'm sorry, what were you asking me?
Oh, yes.

417
00:46:01,315 --> 00:46:05,611
That stupid plastic container
I asked you to buy.

418
00:46:05,778 --> 00:46:09,365
You see, hydrofluoric acid
won't eat through plastic.

419
00:46:09,573 --> 00:46:16,121
It will, however, dissolve metal,
rock, glass, ceramic.

420
00:46:16,288 --> 00:46:18,457
So there's that.

421
00:46:35,307 --> 00:46:37,393
Okay, here we go.

422
00:46:44,316 --> 00:46:46,151
Okay.

423
00:46:51,532 --> 00:46:53,492
Here I go.
