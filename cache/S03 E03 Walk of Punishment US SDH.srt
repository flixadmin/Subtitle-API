( exhales )

7
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,996
Edmure:
<i>If I may, nephew,</i>

8
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,499
I encountered a situation
with one of my lieutenants

9
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,501
at the Stone Mill
which may have some bearing--

10
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:15,088
Why don't you shut your mouth
about that damned mill?

11
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,840
And don't call him "nephew."
He is your king.

12
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,175
Robb knows
I meant him no disr--

13
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:22,845
You're lucky
I'm not your king.

14
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,641
I wouldn't let you wave
your blunders around
like a victory flag.

15
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,352
My blunder sent
Tywin's mad dog

16
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,563
scurrying back
to Casterly Rock with
his tail between his legs.

17
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,607
I think King Robb understands
we're not gonna win this war

18
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,484
if he's the only one
winning any battles.

19
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,902
No, there's glory enough
to go around.

20
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,654
It's not about glory.

21
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,242
Your instructions were to wait
for him to come to you.

22
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,618
I seized an opportunity.

23
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,662
What value was the mill?

24
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,831
The Mountain was garrisoned
across the river from it.

25
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,290
Robb:
<i>Is he there now?</i>

26
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,376
Of course not.
We took the fight to him.

27
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,836
He could not withstand us.

28
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,797
I wanted to draw
the Mountain into the west,

29
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,385
into our country where
we could surround him
and kill him.

30
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,470
I wanted him to chase us,

31
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,849
which he would have done
because he is a mad dog

32
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,184
without a strategic thought
in his head.

33
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,146
I could have that head
on a spike by now.

34
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,942
Instead, I have a mill.

35
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,530
Edmure:
<i>We took hostages.</i>

36
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:25,950
Willem Lannister.
Martyn Lannister.

37
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,619
Willem and Martyn Lannister
are 14 years old.

38
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,164
Martyn is 15,
I believe.

39
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,588
Tywin Lannister
has my sisters.

40
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,631
Have I sued for peace?

41
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,966
No.

42
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,426
Do you think
he'll sue for peace

43
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,596
because we have
his father's

44
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,640
brother's
great-grandsons?

45
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,688
No.

46
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,648
How many men
did you lose?

47
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,526
208.

48
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,695
But for every man we lost,
the Lannisters--

49
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,740
We need our men more
than Tywin needs his!

50
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,998
I'm sorry.

51
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,334
- I didn't know.
- You would have.

52
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,545
Right here today
at this gathering
if you had been patient.

53
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,840
We seem to be running
short of patience here.

54
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,510
You know who isn't?

55
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,639
Tywin Lannister.

56
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,683
( chains rattling )

57
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,521
<i>( chair squeaking )</i>

58
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,583
( sighs )

59
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,960
Intimate.
Lovely table.

60
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:26,088
<i>Better chairs than the old</i>
<i>small council chamber.</i>

61
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,425
Conveniently close
to your own quarters.
I like it.

62
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:32,178
What news of Jaime?

63
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,643
20,000 unwashed
Northerners

64
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,394
have known about
his escape for weeks.

65
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,022
<i>Collectively, you control</i>
<i>more spies and informants</i>

66
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,941
than the rest
of the world combined.

67
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,401
Do you mean to tell me
that none of you

68
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,070
has any notion
of where he is?

69
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,948
- We are trying, my lord.
- Try harder.

70
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,160
<i>What do we have, then?</i>

71
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:59,330
Robb Stark and most
of his bannermen
are in Riverrun

72
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,959
for the funeral
of his grandfather
Lord Hoster Tully.

73
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:08,464
In Stark's absence,
Roose Bolton holds
Harrenhal,

74
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,676
which would
seem to make him
Lord of Harrenhal,

75
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,844
- in practice
if not in name.
-<i> Well, let him have it.</i>

76
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,680
The name suits
our purposes

77
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,474
far more than that
useless pile of rubble.

78
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:21,727
The Lord of Harrenhal
will make a worthy suitor
for the widow Arryn.

79
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,814
For which I am extremely
grateful to you, my lord.

80
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,817
<i>Lady Arryn and I</i>
<i>have known each other</i>
<i>since we were children.</i>

81
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,986
She has always been...

82
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,405
positively predisposed
toward me.

83
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,992
A successful courtship
would make Lord Baelish

84
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,827
acting Lord of the Vale.

85
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,496
Titles do seem
to breed titles.

86
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,790
You'll leave for the Eyrie
as soon as possible

87
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,542
and bring Lysa Arryn
into the fold.

88
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,545
Then the young wolf can add
his own aunt to the list

89
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,505
of people who have
taken up arms against him.

90
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:52,425
Far be it from me
to hinder true love,

91
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:56,929
<i>but Lord Baelish's</i>
<i>absence would present</i>
<i>certain problems.</i>

92
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,931
The royal wedding
may end up

93
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,809
being the most expensive
event in living memory.

94
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,770
<i>Summer has ended,</i>
<i>hard days lie ahead.</i>

95
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:08,774
Not a good time
to leave the crown's
finances unattended.

96
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,110
Tywin:
<i>Fully agreed.</i>

97
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,113
Which is why I'm naming you
new Master of Coin.

98
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,032
- ( chuckles )
- Master of Coin?

99
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,868
It would appear to be
a position that best
suits your talents.

100
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,786
I'm quite good
at spending money,

101
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,747
but a lifetime
of outrageous wealth

102
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,498
hasn't taught me much
about managing it.

103
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:28,252
I have no doubt you will
prove equal to this challenge.

104
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,920
Hear, hear.

105
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,132
Man:
<i>♪ He lifted her</i>
<i>high in the air ♪</i>

106
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,509
♪ He sniffed and roared
and smelled her there ♪

107
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,720
♪ She kicked and wailed,
a maid so fair ♪

108
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,389
♪ But he licked the honey
from her hair ♪

109
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,100
All:
♪ From there to here,
from here to there ♪

110
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,311
♪ All black and brown
and covered with hair ♪

111
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,521
♪ He smelled that girl
in the summer air ♪

112
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,608
♪ The bear, the bear
and the maiden fair... ♪

113
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,736
I hope you're pleased.

114
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,280
If you had armed me,
they never would have
taken us.

115
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,282
You were armed
when we were taken.

116
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,909
I was in chains
if you recall.

117
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,911
Our little match would
have ended quite quick

118
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,788
if my hands
weren't bound.

119
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:07,333
All my life I've been
hearing, "Jaime Lannister,

120
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,919
what a brilliant swordsman."

121
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,380
You were slower
than I expected.

122
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,048
And more predictable.

123
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,508
I've been sitting
in a muddy pen

124
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,551
wrapped in chains
for the past year.

125
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,428
And I'm a woman.
I was still beating you.

126
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,639
You were not beating me.

127
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,933
Maybe you were as good
as people said...

128
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,143
once.

129
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:29,271
Or maybe people just love
to overpraise a famous name.

130
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,149
<i>( horse neighs )</i>

131
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,778
When we make camp tonight,
you'll be raped.

132
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,530
More than once.

133
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,574
None of these fellows
have ever been with
a noblewoman.

134
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,453
You'd be wise
not to resist.

135
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,455
- Would I?
- They'll knock
your teeth out.

136
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,998
You think I care
about my teeth?

137
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:51,168
No, I don't think you
care about your teeth.

138
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,215
If you fight them,
they will kill you.

139
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,050
Do you understand?

140
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,511
I'm the prisoner
of value, not you.

141
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,930
Let them have
what they want.
What does it matter?

142
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,307
- What does it matter?
- Close your eyes.

143
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,268
Pretend they're Renly.

144
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,063
If you were a woman,
you wouldn't resist?

145
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,774
You'd let them
do what they wanted?

146
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,610
If I was a woman,
I'd make them kill me.

147
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,029
But I'm not,
thank the gods.

148
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,661
If I had a proper forge,
I could make it good as new.

149
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,496
Doesn't have
to look pretty.

150
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,166
It just has to keep
the arrows out of my heart.

151
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,293
Why are you
helping him?

152
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,170
He takes us prisoner
and now he's our friend?

153
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,213
Thoros:
<i>You're not our prisoner,</i>
<i>little lady.</i>

154
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,340
- What am I?
- Our guest.

155
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,509
No one's put
any chains on you.

156
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,011
So I can
walk away, then?

157
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,055
These woods aren't safe
for Ned Stark's daughter.

158
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,099
You're lucky we found you.

159
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,648
Hound:
You think you're good with
that bow, you little twat?

160
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,484
Anguy:
Better than anyone
you've ever met.

161
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,527
Hound:
<i>A coward's weapon.</i>

162
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,571
<i>I like to fight up close.</i>

163
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:04,116
I like to see a man's face
when I put the steel in him.

164
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,285
Why?
So you can kiss him?

165
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,287
You remember
the last time
you were here?

166
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,957
Looks like every other
shit inn on the road.

167
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,502
Now, apologies,
but you're one ugly fucker

168
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,754
and I'd rather not
see you no more.

169
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,175
( grunts )

170
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,344
Watch your head.

171
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,720
- ( bangs wagon )
- Off we go.

172
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,932
- Man:<i> Walk up!</i>
<i>- ( horse neighs )</i>

173
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,188
What are you doing?
We're about to leave.

174
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,523
I'm staying.

175
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,236
You're what?

176
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,613
I baked some brown bread
for the innkeep

177
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,406
and she said
she never had better.

178
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,367
Told Thoros
she's keeping me
as a payment

179
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,743
for all the free meals
she's given him.

180
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:50,037
Anyway, it's not me
the Brotherhood wants.

181
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,373
My brother ain't no king.

182
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,166
I'm not a Stark
of Winterhell.

183
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,459
Winterfell.

184
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,963
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

185
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,301
Well, I made you
something.

186
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,599
What is it?

187
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,685
It's a wolf.

188
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,774
Yes, it is.

189
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,610
That's the tail?

190
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,945
Yeah.

191
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,408
Well, be safe.

192
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,285
Yeah, you, too.

193
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,078
Don't get stabbed.

194
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:34,123
You don't...

195
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,708
burn your fingers.

196
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,304
Good-bye, Hot Pie.

197
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,514
Good-bye, Arry.

198
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,736
Up you go, little lady.

199
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,120
Arya:
<i>Hey, Hot Pie.</i>

200
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,415
It's really good.

201
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,341
A person could
almost be forgiven

202
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,593
for forgetting
we're at war.

203
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:34,475
It often comforts me
to think that even in
war's darkest days,

204
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,018
in most places
in the world

205
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:40,314
absolutely nothing
is happening.

206
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,777
I've missed you, Uncle.

207
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,945
Father missed you, too,

208
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,530
from the day you left.

209
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,991
Maybe he never said it
in so many words--

210
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,576
Maybe?

211
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,870
Your father
was a stubborn old ox.

212
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:56,622
I was surprised
when he died.

213
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:59,667
Didn't think death
had the patience.

214
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,546
I'm glad
you were with him.

215
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,215
I wish to the gods
I had been.

216
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,887
Did you make peace
in the end?

217
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,848
After 30 years of fighting,

218
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,142
I don't think he remembered
what started it.

219
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,938
He asked me to stop
calling myself Blackfish.

220
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,148
He said it was
an old joke

221
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,401
and it was never funny
to begin with.

222
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,822
I told him people had been
calling me Blackfish

223
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,324
for so long, they don't
remember my real name.

224
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,997
Every time he would leave
for the capital

225
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,750
or fight in a campaign,

226
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,585
I'd see him off.

227
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,964
"Wait for me,
little Cat," he'd say.

228
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,967
"Wait for me

229
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,637
and I'll come back
to you."

230
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,306
And I would sit
at this window

231
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,017
every day when the sun
came up, waiting.

232
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,399
I wonder

233
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:08,068
how many times
did Bran or Rickon

234
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,112
stare across the moors
of Winterfell

235
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,072
waiting for me
to return.

236
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,576
<i>I will never</i>
<i>see them again.</i>

237
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,287
( crying )

238
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,956
You mustn't think it.

239
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,375
We don't know the truth.

240
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,627
They could be in hiding.

241
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,759
Robb believes
they're alive.

242
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,510
And he must go on
believing.

243
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,889
He's got to remain strong
if he's to prevail.

244
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,517
And you must remain
strong for him.

245
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,447
You're Robb Stark's wife.

246
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,783
Hold still.

247
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,161
Is it true
what they say about him?

248
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,581
I don't know.
What do they say about him?

249
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,958
That he can turn
into a wolf at night.

250
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,628
True.

251
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,172
And he eats the flesh
of his enemies.

252
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,090
True.

253
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,054
You're a Lannister,
aren't you?

254
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,305
Martyn Lannister.

255
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,517
Martyn Lannister.

256
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,768
You've nothing to fear.

257
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,895
My husband
doesn't eat children.

258
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,316
Unless it's a full moon.

259
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,944
It's not a full moon
tonight, is it?

260
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,695
See?

261
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,906
Nothing to fear.

262
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,283
( fabric rips )

263
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,827
<i>( wind howling )</i>

264
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,552
Always the artists.

265
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,407
It's only horses.

266
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,825
No men.

267
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,662
You said
there was dead crows.

268
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,956
There was.

269
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,085
How many men were here?

270
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:32,254
About 300.

271
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,423
And you know
what those men are now?

272
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,805
We're all
the same to them--
meat for their army.

273
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,434
Do you think
anyone got away?

274
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,060
Mance:
<i>It's not impossible.</i>

275
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,438
<i>You don't go far</i>
<i>betting against Mormont.</i>

276
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,773
But dead or alive,

277
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,026
he took a big gamble
coming north.

278
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,944
<i>And he lost.</i>

279
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,447
His best fighting men
are dead.

280
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,658
And whether
he's Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch

281
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,702
or a blue-eyed corpse,

282
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,413
he's a long way
from home.

283
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,916
Tormund.

284
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,918
Climb the Wall.

285
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,129
Take Orell
and 20 good men.

286
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:15,797
And take this one.

287
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,425
He knows Castle Black's
defenses better
than any of us.

288
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,094
And if he's useful, good.
If not...

289
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,472
throw him off the Wall.

290
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,183
See if crows can fly.

291
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,686
We're finally going to war,
old friend?

292
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,313
Hide near Castle Black.

293
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,732
When I give the signal,
hit them in the night.

294
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,276
They've got a big old wall
to hide behind,

295
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,320
but it only guards
one side.

296
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,571
( chuckles )

297
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,323
- We'll meet again.
- Aye.

298
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,575
- If you do your job.
- Ah.

299
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,661
How will we see
your signal?

300
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,497
Send your eagle above
the Wall every night.

301
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,333
When it's time, I'm going
to light the biggest fire

302
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,627
the North has ever seen.

303
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,380

Ghost?

308
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:39,423
What have we here?
Frozen crows?

309
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,341
We've come a long way.

310
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,221
Craster:
<i>Smaller flock</i>
<i>than you went north with.</i>

311
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:48,432
We can talk inside.

312
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,351
Oh, can we?

313
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,915

<i>- Woman #2: They need</i>
<i>some water.</i>

314
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,251

Craster:
<i>Keep your eyes</i>
<i>where they belong.</i>

320
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,438
They're not for you.

321
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,066
Bet you feed that pig
better than you feed us.

322
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:42,319
Aye, pig's got
value to me.

323
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:46,448
You should all be kissing
my feet for letting you in.

324
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,660
I'd have turned you all away
if I wasn't a godly man.

325
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,913
You are a godly man?

326
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:56,500
I am.
I got no fear of
what's out there.

327
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,502
<i>When the white cold comes,</i>

328
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:02,798
<i>your swords and cloaks</i>
<i>and bloody fires</i>
<i>won't help you.</i>

329
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:07,177
The only ones left will be
those who are right
with the gods.

330
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,595
The real gods.

331

on my fist.

334
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:26,154
Women.

335
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,115
That sow right there
gave birth

<i>to a litter of eight.</i>

337
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,327
Barely a grunt.

338
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,873
And she's almost as fat
as this one here.

339
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,292
Now why don't
you dine on him?

340
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,003
Carve off what you need
as you go.

341
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,382
Well, look at him.
He's a walking feast.

- ( wailing )
- That's it.

349
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,970
<i>You're nearly there.</i>

350
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,351
One more push
should do it.

351
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,729
( wailing )

352
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,983
<i>( baby crying )</i>

353
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,572
What is it?
What is it?

354
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,586
<i>( water dripping )</i>

355
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,047
<i>( door opens )</i>

356
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,851
( breathing heavily )

357
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,898
Keep quiet.

358
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,653
( groans )

359
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,509
( groans )

360
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,888
If you can't ride,
we don't stand a chance.

361
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,974
I can ride.

362
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,268
You're sure?

363
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,314
( groans )

364
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,489
( groans )

365
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,825
Ride east.
Follow the rising sun.

366
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,494
<i>Your sister's</i>
<i>waiting for you.</i>

367
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,997
I'll make you a Lord
of the Iron Islands for this.

368
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,290
We're not in
the Iron Islands.

369
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,042
- Go.
- Come on.

370
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,627
Come on.
Come on.

371
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,671
Come on. Come on.

372
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,510
Man:
<i>Come on back.</i>

373
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,349
Stannis:
<i>You refuse to tell me</i>
<i>where you're going?</i>

374
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,561
Melisandre:
<i>I don't know yet.</i>
<i>The fires will show me.</i>

375
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:47,272
- How long will you be gone?
- I don't know.

376
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:49,816
You're abandoning me.

377
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,901
I will never abandon you.

378
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,864
You are the Son of Fire.

379
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,533
- I am sworn to serve you.
- Then serve me.

380
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,618
When I return,
you will understand.

381
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,665
My enemies think
they've destroyed me.

382
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,377
They're laughing at me

383
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,964
the way Renly
laughed at me.

384
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,800
I want Joffrey dead.

385
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,969
I want Robb Stark dead.

386
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,725
Make me another son.

387
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,602
I cannot.

388
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,020
Why?

389
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,564
You don't have the strength.
It would kill you.

390
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,442
I'm not so easily killed.
Men have been trying
for years.

391
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,866
I want you.

392
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,174
Your fires burn low,
my king.

393
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:03,056
There is another way.
A better way.

394
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,809
You told me your magic
requires a king's blood.

395
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,560
- Yes.
- I'm the one true king.

396
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,229
You are.

397
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,231
But there are others
with your blood
in their veins.

398
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,778
You will sit
on the Iron Throne,

399
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,613
but first there must
be sacrifices.

400
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:21,449
The Lord of Light
demands it.

401
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,165
<i>( birds screeching )</i>

402
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:35,505
The Walk of Punishment
is a warning, Your Grace.

403
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:38,591
- To whom?
- To any slave who
contemplates doing

404
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,261
whatever these slaves did.

405
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,805
Give me your water.

406
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:47,684
Khaleesi, this man
has been sentenced to death.

407
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,900
Here, drink.

408
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,194
( mutters )

409
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,488
Barristan:
<i>Leave this place, Your Grace.</i>

410
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,157
Leave tonight,
I beg you.

411
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,867
And what is she
to do for soldiers?

412
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,953
Barristan:
<i>We can find sellswords</i>
<i>in Pentos and Myr.</i>

413
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:10,665
Is it "we" already,
Ser Barristan?

414
00:29:10,748 --> 00:29:14,502
If you want to sit on
the throne your ancestors
built, you must win it.

415
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,546
That will mean blood
on your hands before
the thing is done.

416
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:19,799
The blood of my enemies,
not the blood of innocents.

417
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,597
Jorah:
How many wars have you
fought in, Ser Barristan?

418
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,682
- Three.
- Have you ever seen a war

419
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:30,143
where innocents didn't die
by the thousands?

420
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:37,692
I was in King's Landing
after the sack, khaleesi.

421
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:41,112
You know what I saw?
Butchery.

422
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,364
Babies, children,
old men.

423
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,867
More women raped
than you can count.

424
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,577
There's a beast
in every man

425
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,455
and it stirs when you put
a sword in his hand.

426
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,916
But the Unsullied
are not men.

427
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,667
They do not rape.

428
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,545
They do not put cities
to the sword unless they're
ordered to do so.

429
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:02,217
If you buy them,
the only men they'll kill
are those you want dead.

430
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,260
Do you disagree,
Ser Barristan?

431
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,930
When your brother Rhaegar
led his army into battle
at the Trident,

432
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,641
men died for him
because they believed in him,

433
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,100
because they loved him,

434
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,811
not because they'd been bought
at a slaver's auction.

435
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,316
I fought beside the last dragon
on that day, Your Grace.

436
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,362
I bled beside him.

437
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:25,865
Rhaegar fought valiantly,
Rhaegar fought nobly,

438
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,617
and Rhaegar died.

439
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,246
Did you know him well,
Ser Barristan?

440
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:35,750
I did, Your Grace.
Finest man I ever met.

441
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:38,169
I wish I had known him.

442
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,046
But he was not
the last dragon.

443
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,936
All?
Did this one's ears
mishear, Your Grace?

444
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,854
They did not.
I want to buy them all.

445
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,482
( speaking Valyrian )

446
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,498
There are 8,000 Unsullied
in Astapor.

447
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,667
Is this what you mean
by all?

448
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,377
Yes. 8,000.

449
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,462
<i>And the ones</i>
<i>still in training as well.</i>

450
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:34,642
Master Greizhen
says they cannot sell
half-trained boys.

451
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,894
<i>If they fail</i>
<i>on the battlefield,</i>

452
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,105
they will bring shame
upon all of Astapor.

453
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,316
I will have them all
or take none.

454
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,902
Many will fall in battle.
I'll need the boys to pick
up the swords they drop.

455
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,529
( groans )

456
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,327
Master Kraznys says
you cannot afford this.

457
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,167
Your ship will buy you
100 Unsullied.

458
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:04,339
- ( men laugh )
- Because Master Kraznys
is generous.

459
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:08,593
<i>The gold you have left</i>
<i>is worth 10.</i>

460
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,388
But good Master Kraznys
will give you 20.

461
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,851
The Dothraki
you have with you--

462
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,984
The Dothraki you have are not
worth what they cost to feed,

463
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,654
<i>but Master Kraznys will give</i>
<i>you three Unsullied</i>

464
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,238
<i>for all of them.</i>

465
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,242
Master Kraznys asks
how you propose to pay

466
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:38,956
for the remaining
7,877 Unsullied.

467
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,215
I have dragons.
I'll give you one.

468
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,927
( speaking Valyrian )

469
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,930
You will win the throne
with dragons, not slaves,
Your Grace.

470
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,516
Khaleesi, please.

471
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,318
Three dragons.

472
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,695
- One.
- Two.

473
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:09,904
One.

474
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,078
( whispering )

475
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,373
( speaks Valyrian )

476
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,542
Missandei:
<i>They want the biggest one.</i>

477
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,086
- Done.
- Done.

478
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,552
I'll take you
as well, now.

479
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:35,263
You'll be Master
Kraznys' gift to me.

480
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,598
A token of a bargain
well struck.

481
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:51,279
Khaleesi,
a dragon is worth
more than any army.

482
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,573
Aegon Targaryen
proved that.

483
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,285
You're both here
to advise me.

484
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,788
I value your advice,
but if you ever question me
in front of strangers again,

485
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,458
you'll be advising
someone else.

486
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,710
Is that understood?

487
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,339
<i>Do you have a name?</i>

488
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,884
This one's name
is Missandei, Your Grace.

489
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,219
Do you have a family?
A mother and a father

490
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,263
you'd return to
if you had the choice?

491
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:20,558
No, Your Grace.
No family living.

492
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:23,811
You belong to me now.
It is your duty to tell
me the truth.

493
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,272
Yes, Your Grace.
Lying is a great offense.

494
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,734
Many of those on
the Walk of Punishment
were taken there for less.

495
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,487
I offered water to one
of the slaves dying on
the Walk of Punishment.

496
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,656
Do you know
what he said to me?
"Let me die."

497
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,534
There are no masters
in the grave, Your Grace.

498
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,370
Is it true what
Master Kraznys told me

499
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:44,415
about the Unsullied?
About their obedience?

500
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,168
All questions have been
taken from them.

501
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,128
They obey, that is all.

502
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,839
<i>Once they are yours,</i>
<i>they are yours.</i>

503
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,883
They will fall on their swords
if you command it.

504
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:57,512
And what about you?
You know that I'm taking
you to war.

505
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:01,682
<i>You may go hungry.</i>
<i>You may fall sick.</i>

506
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,851
You may be killed.

507
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,561
<i>Valar morghulis.</i>

508
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:09,106
Yes, all men
must die.

509
00:35:10,107 --> 00:35:12,318
But we are not men.

510
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:25,706
Tyrion:
<i>A surprising place to keep</i>
<i>the royal ledgers.</i>

511
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,834
Littlefinger:
<i>I'm surprised you're surprised.</i>

512
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,047
This is the safest place
in the city.

513
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,882
Not for bastards.

514
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,218
That's all of them,
my lord.

515
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,388
Tyrion:
<i>Thank you, my dear.</i>
<i>Pod.</i>

516
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,641
Pod.
Take them outside.

517
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:46,227
- I'll be there in a moment.
- Yes, my lord.

518
00:35:56,904 --> 00:36:00,449
I hear you owe that boy
a significant debt.

519
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,243
Only my life.

520
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,370
Not all that significant,
I'm afraid.

521
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,289
You should
have him knighted.

522
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:09,500
If only the Master of Coin
had such power.

523
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,670
If only.

524
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,757
I owe you
a significant debt.

525
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,968
Our redheaded friend.

526
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,971
You secured her release
when the queen detained her.

527
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,931
Oh, that.

528
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:27,184
Of course.
A simple misunderstanding.

529
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,811
Apparently,
Her Grace believed

530
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:32,899
that you two had some sort
of special relationship.

531
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,860
We don't.
I did fuck her once.

532
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,112
- I know.
- But we don't.

533
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:39,614
I know.

534
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,324
But how would the queen
get that idea?

535
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:44,118
Why don't you ask her?

536
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,749
Any advice for me
on my new position?

537
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,668
Keep a low profile.

538
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:56,088
If I had a gold dragon

539
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,133
for every time I heard
that joke, I'd be richer
than you are.

540
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:01,093
Well, you are
richer than I am.

541
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,137
Good point.

542
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,515
They're only numbers.
Numbers on paper.

543
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,977
Once you understand that,
it's easy to make them behave.

544
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,520
Trivial even.

545
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,314
- You want a real challenge?
-<i> ( women giggling )</i>

546
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,732
Try whores.

547
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,318
I've tried quite a few.

548
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,987
Well, lots of work to do.

549
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,615
Enjoy the Eyrie.

550
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,784
Come on,
I'm here later.

551
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,661
Come on.

552
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,749
Tonight, then.

553
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,836
Looks like dull reading.

554
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,880
Tyrion:
You think all reading
is dull reading.

555
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,925
It's an opinion I share with
some of the finest men I know.

556
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,511
The secret history
of the Seven Kingdoms
is written in these pages.

557
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,222
Unless Lord Twatbeard
made up a bunch of numbers

558
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,682
to hide what
he's really up to.

559
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,767
Unless he made it
all up, yes.

560
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,353
- Podrick, do keep up.
- Yes, my lord.

561
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,647
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

562
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,942
After a long consultation
with my colleague Ser Bronn,

563
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,860
I finally found
a suitable reward

564
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,113
for the services
you've provided
over and above

565
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,781
<i>what might be</i>
<i>considered reasonable.</i>

566
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,409
Tell me, Pod,

567
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,203
have you ever been
with a woman?

568
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:11,455
- No, my lord.
- Wonderful.

569
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:17,169
Genna specializes
in first-timers.

570
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,006
She's not bad with
second-timers, either.

571
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,882
Uh, my lord...

572
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,385
A fair enough repayment
for putting your spear

573
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,721
through my would-be
killer's face,
wouldn't you say?

574
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,475
Now, as it happens,

575
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,061
Marei...

576
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:37,398
is quite the spear
handler herself.

577
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:40,943
She's here to thank you
for staying by my side

578
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,738
as the battle raged
all around me.

579
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,448
He's handsome.

580
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:48,784
You didn't tell me
he was handsome.

581
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:53,914
Kayla is famous
from here to Volantis

582
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,083
in certain circles.

583
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,419
<i>One of four women</i>
<i>in the world</i>

584
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:02,381
who can perform a proper
Meereenese Knot.

585
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,718
My lord, I don't even...

586
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,595
<i>She's here to thank you</i>

587
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,930
<i>for being a thoroughly</i>
<i>respectful fellow</i>

588
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:13,017
who's never once failed
to address me as "my lord."

589
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,272
Be back in time
for my supper.

590
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,112
Pace yourself, lad.

591
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,032
For years I've heard
that Littlefinger

592
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,034
is a magician.

593
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:33,454
Whenever the crown needs money,
he rubs his hands together

594
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,998
and, poof,
mountains of gold.

595
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,459
Let me guess.
He's not a magician.

596
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,461
No.

597
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,548
- He's stealing it?
- Worse, he's borrowing it.

598
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,510
What's wrong with that?

599
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:50,805
We can't afford to pay it back,
that's what's wrong with it.

600
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,349
The crown owes millions
to my father.

601
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,684
Seeing as it's his grandson's
ass on the throne,

602
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,978
I imagine he'll forgive
that debt.

603
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,272
Forgive a debt, my father?

604
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,650
For a man of the world,
you're strangely naive.

605
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,360
I've never borrowed
money before.

606
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,987
I'm not clear on the rules.

607
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,489
Well...

608
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,533
<i>Ahem!</i>

609
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,287
The basic principle is

610
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,831
I lend you money,

611
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,333
and after an agreed upon
period of time,

612
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:21,710
you return it
with interest.

613
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,170
And what if I don't?

614
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,214
Well, you have to.

615
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,674
But what if I don't?

616
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,009
This is why
I don't lend you money.

617
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:32,513
Anyway, it's not my father
I'm worried about.

618
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,515
It's the Iron Bank
of Braavos.

619
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,433
We owe them
tens of millions.

620
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:41,188
If we fail to repay
these loans, the bank
will fund our enemies.

621
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,983
One way or another,
they always get
their gold back.

622
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,651
<i>( door opens )</i>

623
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,946
Ah, the return
of the conquering hero.

624
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,115
Does he have a little
jaunt in his step?

625
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,992
The lad's
practically skipping.

626
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,827
You were gone
a long time.

627
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,620
I trust you got
your money's worth.

628
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,122
Or should I say
my money's worth?

629
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,918
Oh, it was a gift,
Podrick.

630
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,545
This is more than
I give you in a year.

631
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,381
He's a squire.
You don't pay him.

632
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:10,384
Oh, then it's much more
than I give you in a year.

633
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:11,886
They wouldn't
take it, my lord.

634
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,514
Maybe they're trying
to curry some favor

635
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,099
<i>with the new</i>
<i>Master of Coin.</i>

636
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,185
Have you ever known a whore
to turn down gold?

637
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,896
They were happy enough
to take it when I gave it
to them.

638
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,731
What did you tell them?

639
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,232
I didn't tell them
anything.

640
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,027
- What did you do to them?
- Lots of things.

641
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,070
And they seemed
to like these things?

642
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,655
Yes, my lord.

643
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,115
<i>Of course</i>
<i>they seemed to like it.</i>

644
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,742
They're paid
to seem to like it.

645
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,036
Only they weren't paid.

646
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,997
What are you saying?
These ladies enjoyed
him so much,

647
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,750
they gave him
the time for free?

648
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,335
Is that what
you're telling us?

649
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,049
Sit down, Podrick.

650
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,058
We're going
to need details.

651
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,310

00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,575
You're only
making it worse.

692
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,457
Locke:
<i>Take her over there</i>
<i>where it's dark.</i>

693
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,917
I'd like a little privacy.

694
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,126
( grunts )

695
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,004
- ( Brienne gasping )
- Come on!

696
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:41,757
( screaming )

697
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,683
You know who she is,
don't you?

698
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,606
A big dumb bitch
from who cares where.

699
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:01,902
Never been with
a woman that big.

700
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:04,738
Jaime:
<i>She's Brienne of Tarth.</i>

701
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:07,407
Her father
is Lord Selwyn Tarth.

702
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,992
Heard of Tarth?

703
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,079
Man:
<i>I'm gonna cut your throat!</i>

704
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:15,040
They call it
the Sapphire Isle.
Do you know why?

705
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:18,126
Every sapphire
in Westeros

706
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,628
was mined on Tarth.

707
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:23,090
<i>Sapphires are gemstones.</i>

708
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:26,426
-<i> The blue ones.</i>
<i>- I know what they are.</i>

709
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,264
Lord Selwyn would pay
his daughter's weight

710
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,975
in sapphires
if she's returned to him.

711
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:36,270
<i>But only if she's alive,</i>

712
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:39,273
her honor unbesmirched.

713
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,775
<i>( Brienne screaming )</i>

714
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:44,152
<i>( men shouting )</i>

715
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,618
Bring her back here.

716
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,036
Man:
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

717
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,455
-<i> Get up.</i>
<i>- Man #2: Come on.</i>

718
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,250
Man #3:
<i>Come on, on your feet.</i>

719
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,628
Locke:
<i>Unbesmirched.</i>

720
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,340
Not defiled.

721
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:08,302
Fancy word
for a fancy man.

722
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,680
I hated to read
as a child,

723
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:14,766
<i>but my father forced me</i>
<i>to study the books</i>
<i>every morning</i>

724
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,978
<i>before I could practice</i>
<i>with sword or horse.</i>

725
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:21,398
Two hours
every day holed up in
the maester's chambers.

726
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:24,860
I learned a lot
of fancy words.

727
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:27,154
I bet you did.

728
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:31,366
<i>( Brienne screams )</i>

729
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,372
Your father,

730
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:40,250
he'd pay your weight
in gold to get you back?

731
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,630
You'll be a rich man
till the end of your days.

732
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,506
<i>And your sons</i>
<i>will be rich men</i>

733
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,884
<i>and their sons</i>
<i>after them.</i>

734
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,178
Lands, titles--

735
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,680
you'll have them all.

736
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:58,185
The North
can't win this war.

737
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,979
You're a smart man.
You understand that.

738
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,856
We have the numbers.
We have the gold.

739
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:04,816
Aye, you have both.

740
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:09,363
Fighting bravely
for a losing cause

741
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,323
is admirable.

742
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:14,034
Fighting for
a winning cause

743
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,286
is far more rewarding.

744
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,830
Hard to argue with that.

745
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:25,045
Now that we're speaking
together man to man,

746
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:29,424
I wonder if you need
to keep me chained
to this tree.

747
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,760
I'm not asking to be freed
from my constraints,

748
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:35,597
but if I could sleep
lying down,

749
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,474
my back would
thank you for it.

750
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:39,476
I'm not as young

751
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:42,187
and resilient
as I was once.

752
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,314
None of us are.

753
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:48,652
Locke:
<i>Unchain Ser Jaime</i>
<i>from the tree.</i>

754
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:51,071
Man:
<i>Come on, men.</i>

755
00:49:56,868 --> 00:50:00,080
Suppose you'll be wanting
something to eat.

756
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,957
I'm famished, actually.

757
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,918
Locke:
<i>I think we've got a spare</i>
<i>partridge on the fire.</i>

758
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:07,796
Well, I do like partridge.

759
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:17,305
Bring the bird over here
and the carving knife.

760
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:23,270
Will this work
as a table, my lord?

761
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,063
Oh, yes.
Yes, this will do nic--

762
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,232
ah!

763
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,276
On the stump.

764
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:38,910
You think you're
the smartest man there is.

765
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,957
That everyone alive
has to bow and scrape

766
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,959
and lick your boots.

767
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:48,670
- My father--
- And if you get
in any trouble,

768
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,339
all you've got to do
is say "my father"

769
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:54,342
and that's it,
all your troubles are gone.

770
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,847
- Don't.
- Have you got
something to say?

771
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:06,438
Careful.
You don't want to say
the wrong thing.

772
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:12,569
You're nothing
without your daddy,

773
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:15,989
and your daddy
ain't here.

774
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:18,408
Never forget that.

775
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:22,078
Here, this should
help you remember.

776
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,791
