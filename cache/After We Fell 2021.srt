1
00:00:55,078 --> 00:00:57,847
No. You gotta get out now!
I can't do this anymore.

2
00:00:57,881 --> 00:00:59,715
I will not let her see you
like this.

3
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:02,317
- You need help!
- I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.

4
00:01:02,351 --> 00:01:04,586
- You're always sorry.
- Come on.

5
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,488
How am I supposed to
believe you?

6
00:01:06,522 --> 00:01:08,524
- Every time!
- You've been trying...

7
00:01:08,557 --> 00:01:11,493
Do you know how many times
you've promised you would stop?

8
00:01:11,527 --> 00:01:13,362
- This is not my fault.
- Not your fault?

9
00:01:13,395 --> 00:01:15,330
You're drunk.
In the middle of the day.

10
00:01:15,364 --> 00:01:17,767
- Of course they fired you.
- Can we please talk about this?

11
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:20,770
- You don't give a shit about us.
- Please.

12
00:01:20,804 --> 00:01:22,014
- You have to go.
- Don't do this.

13
00:01:22,038 --> 00:01:23,672
Get out and don't come back

14
00:01:23,705 --> 00:01:25,340
till you're sober.

15
00:01:25,374 --> 00:01:26,408
Daddy?

16
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:28,778
Daddy!

17
00:01:32,015 --> 00:01:33,917
Daddy, don't go!

18
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,985
No! No, no, no. Dad, please!

19
00:01:37,854 --> 00:01:39,621
No, don't go.

20
00:01:39,655 --> 00:01:43,092
- Please don't go, please!
- Tessa! Tessa!

21
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:48,131
Please, daddy. Don't go.
Daddy, please don't go.

22
00:01:48,164 --> 00:01:51,366
Daddy! No!

23
00:02:02,846 --> 00:02:06,049
I can't tell you how good it is
to see you again, Tessie.

24
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:13,823
There's towels in the bathroom,
if you want to take a shower.

25
00:02:13,857 --> 00:02:16,658
- I'll make us some food.
- Thanks.

26
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:29,404
This is good.

27
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:33,076
I remember you were
quite the cook, Tessie.

28
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:36,045
- Thanks.
- Just like your mom.

29
00:02:39,148 --> 00:02:41,184
I tried to call you, you know.

30
00:02:41,217 --> 00:02:45,721
Sent you gifts
every birthday, Christmas.

31
00:02:45,755 --> 00:02:47,656
She didn't tell you, did she?

32
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:51,460
No.

33
00:02:52,527 --> 00:02:53,830
Yeah.

34
00:02:53,863 --> 00:02:56,698
So the prodigal father
has returned.

35
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:00,803
What for?
What do you want?

36
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:04,007
You can stay, if...
If you want to.

37
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,010
We have room, and I don't
want you out on the street.

38
00:03:12,115 --> 00:03:14,984
- Are you still drinking?
- Can you excuse us for a second?

39
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:20,223
I know that this isn't
the most convenient,

40
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:22,225
but you, of all people,
should appreciate me

41
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:25,061
- giving him a second chance.
- Me, of all people, would know

42
00:03:25,094 --> 00:03:26,896
that he's probably
out there right now

43
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,032
shoving all of our shit
into his pockets.

44
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,101
He's gonna hurt you.

45
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:34,469
- You don't know him.
- Neither do you.

46
00:03:34,503 --> 00:03:37,006
It's been, what, 10 years
since you last saw him?

47
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:40,709
Nine.

48
00:03:42,577 --> 00:03:44,680
Look, I'm just trying
to protect you.

49
00:03:44,713 --> 00:03:46,883
I don't need you to protect me.

50
00:03:59,162 --> 00:04:00,930
I know exactly why you're here,

51
00:04:00,964 --> 00:04:03,632
so you may as well just
take this and be on your way.

52
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,905
I don't want your money, kid.

53
00:04:10,605 --> 00:04:13,142
All I want is a relationship
with my daughter.

54
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:19,182
- If you hurt her...
- Hey, whoa, easy.

55
00:04:19,215 --> 00:04:21,784
I know you have no reason
in the world to trust me,

56
00:04:21,818 --> 00:04:23,953
but how about
you give me a shot, huh?

57
00:04:39,802 --> 00:04:42,704
Well, have you found
a place in Seattle yet?

58
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:44,307
- Nope.
- No?

59
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,676
- Nope.
- I'm gonna miss you, dude.

60
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:49,321
Gonna have to start watching
<i>the Kardashians</i>

61
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:51,713
to get my fill of drama
in your absence.

62
00:04:51,748 --> 00:04:54,851
Landon, I'm only going
to Seattle.

63
00:04:54,884 --> 00:04:57,586
You're just a facetime away.
You can always visit.

64
00:04:57,619 --> 00:05:00,256
Between work and school,
you are gonna be swamped.

65
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:02,657
You're not gonna have
any time for anything,

66
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:05,962
like friends, family and
especially not people like...

67
00:05:09,365 --> 00:05:12,534
People like who? Me?

68
00:05:15,637 --> 00:05:18,241
Is there something you wanna
tell me, or should I ask Landon?

69
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:20,043
He seems to know
a lot more than I do.

70
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:24,013
Not today, Satan. I am
gonna see you both this weekend,

71
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:26,115
- at the lake house.
- Don't bet on it.

72
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:27,716
- Okay.
- We'll be there.

73
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:35,657
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

74
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,692
When was this
supposed to happen?

75
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:41,297
- A week?
- What? A week?

76
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,033
You're going away in a week,
you haven't even told me?

77
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:47,203
When was I supposed to tell you?
Because you left.

78
00:05:48,404 --> 00:05:50,273
Yeah, I'm here. I came back.

79
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:52,175
And I came back for you.

80
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,310
I couldn't get a hold
of you for nine days.

81
00:05:54,343 --> 00:05:56,578
I didn't know
if I'd ever see you again.

82
00:05:59,782 --> 00:06:01,317
So, what, is that it then?

83
00:06:02,952 --> 00:06:05,620
I mean...

84
00:06:05,654 --> 00:06:10,193
Yeah, this... this job's a huge
opportunity for me. And...

85
00:06:10,226 --> 00:06:14,263
And I'm hoping, I was hoping,
that you would come with me.

86
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,771
I was hoping that we could move
to London after graduation.

87
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:26,909
And how was I supposed
to know that?

88
00:06:26,943 --> 00:06:28,377
Well, I was gonna tell you.

89
00:06:28,411 --> 00:06:31,047
But it doesn't really matter
anymore, does it?

90
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,182
You've made up your mind,
you've got a plan.

91
00:06:33,216 --> 00:06:35,127
Envisioned your life in a way
that doesn't have me in it.

92
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:37,386
You are in it,
if you want to be.

93
00:06:40,323 --> 00:06:42,691
Look, I get that you're angry.

94
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:44,260
And we do
need to talk about this,

95
00:06:44,293 --> 00:06:46,362
except I have
to get to class, so...

96
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:51,734
We will continue
this discussion.

97
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:53,269
Oh, that's really big of you.

98
00:06:53,302 --> 00:06:56,038
To find time in
your busy schedule. Thank you.

99
00:07:08,317 --> 00:07:09,651
Hey.

100
00:07:28,337 --> 00:07:30,006
Hi, mom, how's London?

101
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:32,808
Good. I just wanted
to check you're okay.

102
00:07:32,842 --> 00:07:36,279
I heard that Tessa took the job
with Vance, in Seattle.

103
00:07:36,312 --> 00:07:37,747
Where did you hear that?

104
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,849
Christian and I
were talking earlier.

105
00:07:39,882 --> 00:07:41,184
That's kind of weird.

106
00:07:41,217 --> 00:07:42,785
He and I have known each other

107
00:07:42,818 --> 00:07:44,287
since long before you were born.

108
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,322
<i>I'd prefer not everyone
knows my business.</i>

109
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:48,157
Mom, I'm gonna call you back.

110
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:09,979
Do you need a ride somewhere?

111
00:08:13,049 --> 00:08:15,418
Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

112
00:08:25,962 --> 00:08:27,797
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

113
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:32,235
Hey, you wanna come inside?

114
00:08:35,905 --> 00:08:37,373
Fuck it, why not.

115
00:08:44,046 --> 00:08:45,181
Enjoy.

116
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,218
What are we drinking about?

117
00:08:49,252 --> 00:08:51,954
I didn't know
we needed a reason.

118
00:08:51,988 --> 00:08:53,122
Cheers to that.

119
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:02,865
Oh, look at her in this one.

120
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:04,400
Mmm.

121
00:09:06,836 --> 00:09:08,971
She looks really happy.

122
00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:13,142
I've really been trying.
Now more than ever.

123
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:14,944
- Yeah.
- Well...

124
00:09:14,977 --> 00:09:18,447
Clearly not right now.
But I am trying.

125
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:21,284
You know, you really remind me
of me when I was your age.

126
00:09:21,317 --> 00:09:23,819
- Fuck that.
- Mmm, yeah.

127
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:26,422
- Seriously?
- Hey. Hey, buddy.

128
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:28,424
Private conversation,
if you don't mind.

129
00:09:28,457 --> 00:09:30,860
Hey, just trying
to get some ideas.

130
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:33,029
Whoa!

131
00:09:33,062 --> 00:09:35,364
That is my daughter,
you fucking piece of shit.

132
00:09:45,908 --> 00:09:47,009
Hey.

133
00:09:49,612 --> 00:09:51,314
I'm sorry, who is this?

134
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:54,583
What are you doing here?

135
00:09:54,617 --> 00:09:57,320
Uh, bonding.

136
00:09:57,353 --> 00:09:58,387
- Hey, Tess.
- Hardin...

137
00:10:00,356 --> 00:10:01,891
What the hell did you do?

138
00:10:01,924 --> 00:10:04,560
- I didn't do any...
- The bartender called me.

139
00:10:04,593 --> 00:10:06,595
Oh, come on.
It wasn't a big deal.

140
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:09,865
- Look, he's fine.
- You're drunk.

141
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,967
I had a drink. I just...
Look, it was...

142
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:13,478
- I was backing up your dad.
- Really?

143
00:10:13,502 --> 00:10:15,971
I didn't start...
He started it actually, so...

144
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:17,340
Somebody called the cops.

145
00:10:17,373 --> 00:10:19,175
You probably called the cops,
you snitch.

146
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,077
Okay, let's go.

147
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,079
Don't be mad at him.

148
00:10:23,112 --> 00:10:24,380
He loves you.

149
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:27,116
That's all.

150
00:10:28,617 --> 00:10:30,453
Whoa!

151
00:10:30,486 --> 00:10:35,958
Yeah, you see that?
Solid guy right there.

152
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:38,194
- Why would anyone leave you?
- I don't know.

153
00:10:38,227 --> 00:10:40,296
Yeah, this is just...
It's so enjoyable.

154
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:42,598
Why wouldn't I stay?

155
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:44,033
I think we're in trouble.

156
00:10:44,066 --> 00:10:46,202
Hey, hey, hey, easy.

157
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:21,670
You know, I'm not sure
that I like this new friendship.

158
00:11:21,704 --> 00:11:24,140
I was just trying to be nice.

159
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:26,942
I offered him a ride, and
the bar was actually his idea.

160
00:11:26,976 --> 00:11:29,945
He's an alcoholic,
and so are you.

161
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:34,283
Two alcoholics walk into a bar.

162
00:11:39,255 --> 00:11:41,390
I'm glad
you think this is funny.

163
00:11:41,424 --> 00:11:44,059
I was showing him some
pictures of you on my phone,

164
00:11:44,093 --> 00:11:45,461
and this asshole leans over

165
00:11:45,494 --> 00:11:47,963
and starts saying
what he'd like to do to you.

166
00:11:50,734 --> 00:11:53,102
So... I mean, so?

167
00:11:53,135 --> 00:11:55,404
So I told him
I've already done that.

168
00:12:17,326 --> 00:12:19,295
- Hardin...
- What?

169
00:12:23,332 --> 00:12:25,167
I'm apologizing.

170
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:51,059
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:52,294 --> 00:12:54,063
I'm so sorry.

172
00:12:59,101 --> 00:13:01,704
- Please forgive me.
- I, that's...

173
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:06,509
- That's not fair.
- Please forgive me.

174
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:09,645
- What if...?
- Shh, he's asleep.

175
00:13:41,477 --> 00:13:43,479
Tessa.

176
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:46,248
Oh, Tessa.

177
00:13:58,294 --> 00:14:00,095
Oh, fuck...

178
00:14:17,446 --> 00:14:21,317
So, uh, I heard
you guys are moving.

179
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,320
Yeah, yeah. I actually need
to start packing.

180
00:14:24,353 --> 00:14:26,689
I'll just finish up
and get out of here.

181
00:14:26,722 --> 00:14:28,557
No, no, no.
No, I didn't mean it like...

182
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:30,760
Nah, nah.
You don't need me around here.

183
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:33,429
I'll just... I got
a few errands to run anyway.

184
00:14:33,462 --> 00:14:34,831
Dad...

185
00:14:38,902 --> 00:14:40,770
That feels really weird to say.

186
00:14:44,607 --> 00:14:45,842
Well, that'll be my ride.

187
00:14:48,477 --> 00:14:49,779
You're leaving now?

188
00:14:50,914 --> 00:14:52,916
Yeah.

189
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:54,149
Come here.

190
00:14:56,786 --> 00:14:59,121
Thank you so much
for letting me stay.

191
00:15:01,758 --> 00:15:03,692
No, stay, stay. He's coming.

192
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:07,563
Uh, hey, don't...

193
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:13,302
Don't disappear on me again.

194
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,411
Hardin.

195
00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:31,654
So you shipping me out next?

196
00:15:37,526 --> 00:15:39,561
- You okay?
- You know, it's not like

197
00:15:39,595 --> 00:15:40,897
I want to leave you.

198
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:43,799
You don't have to.

199
00:15:46,002 --> 00:15:49,438
Vance's offer, it's literally...
It's a dream come true.

200
00:15:49,471 --> 00:15:51,775
I've wanted to live in Seattle
since I was a kid.

201
00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:53,743
The only thing
that would make it better

202
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:55,611
is if you came with me.

203
00:15:55,644 --> 00:15:58,580
I don't... I don't know
why you want me there.

204
00:16:00,382 --> 00:16:02,651
I don't really fit
into that flashy lifestyle.

205
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:04,821
It's never been the kind of
thing you've been after...

206
00:16:04,854 --> 00:16:06,923
- I want to make a life together.
- So do I.

207
00:16:06,956 --> 00:16:08,490
So stay here, and we can.

208
00:16:08,524 --> 00:16:10,292
- You're not listening.
- I am listening.

209
00:16:10,325 --> 00:16:12,361
- I've wanted this job since I...
- I know.

210
00:16:12,394 --> 00:16:14,898
You have a great job in Seattle.
That is great.

211
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:17,734
I'm happy for you. But I don't.
I don't have anything there.

212
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:20,335
- You'd have me.
- Okay, that's not enough.

213
00:16:25,407 --> 00:16:27,309
You know I didn't mean that.

214
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,582
Well, if I'm...

215
00:16:33,615 --> 00:16:37,252
If I'm not enough, that's...
That's your problem.

216
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:38,855
But you're not gonna stop me.

217
00:17:25,434 --> 00:17:27,302
Vance publishing, please hold.

218
00:17:27,336 --> 00:17:28,972
No, I can't. I'm swamped.

219
00:17:29,005 --> 00:17:30,840
You're gonna have to speak
to my assistant.

220
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:32,708
No, the new one.

221
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,012
Um, well, I'll try
and squeeze you in

222
00:17:36,045 --> 00:17:37,981
for 30 minutes this afternoon.

223
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:39,783
Tessa! Hey, come in.

224
00:17:39,816 --> 00:17:42,085
- I can come back.
- No, no. Come in. I'm just...

225
00:17:42,118 --> 00:17:43,853
- I'm heading out.
- Yeah.

226
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:47,957
- Um, you have a safe trip.
- Okay. See you.

227
00:17:49,726 --> 00:17:52,628
Are you sure that you're okay
driving up by yourself?

228
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:55,064
- She's not going by herself.
- I'm taking Smith with me.

229
00:17:58,367 --> 00:18:00,469
Besides, I prefer to get us
settled up there

230
00:18:00,502 --> 00:18:03,438
while Christian
finishes things here.

231
00:18:03,472 --> 00:18:05,809
Have you decided what part
of town you'll be staying in?

232
00:18:05,842 --> 00:18:08,410
No, I'm still deciding
between two places.

233
00:18:08,443 --> 00:18:10,847
It's scary trying to pick
somewhere off the Internet.

234
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,681
No, Tessa. Just stay with us.

235
00:18:12,714 --> 00:18:14,050
You know,
until you get situated.

236
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,651
No, no. I couldn't ask...

237
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:19,022
You didn't.
Come on, it'll be fun.

238
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:20,556
Christian will be thrilled.

239
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:22,992
He's been dying
to spend time with hardin.

240
00:18:23,026 --> 00:18:26,729
Uh, well, he's actually
not coming with me.

241
00:18:26,763 --> 00:18:28,965
Oh.

242
00:18:28,998 --> 00:18:31,333
Well, when he comes
to visit, then.

243
00:18:34,804 --> 00:18:38,141
You know, between us,

244
00:18:38,174 --> 00:18:40,977
Christian was disappointed
hardin turned him down

245
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,879
on his job offer.

246
00:18:42,912 --> 00:18:46,548
What... what job was that?

247
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:50,419
Basically, anything he wanted.

248
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:06,870
Hey.

249
00:19:06,903 --> 00:19:09,005
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't walk away from me.

250
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:11,506
- Hey, don't follow me.
- Tess, I'm sorry.

251
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,642
I didn't mean it.
I shouldn't have said it.

252
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:15,711
Can you stop saying things
you don't mean?

253
00:19:15,745 --> 00:19:17,180
I can't tell what's true.

254
00:19:17,213 --> 00:19:18,915
Can you stop making decisions

255
00:19:18,948 --> 00:19:20,850
without talking things
through first?

256
00:19:22,852 --> 00:19:24,020
Okay.

257
00:19:25,922 --> 00:19:27,623
Okay.

258
00:19:27,656 --> 00:19:30,659
Kimberly invited me to stay
with them in Seattle,

259
00:19:30,692 --> 00:19:32,829
- if that's not weird?
- Did she?

260
00:19:32,862 --> 00:19:34,831
No, no, no. It's not weird.

261
00:19:34,864 --> 00:19:36,933
It's good. It's great.

262
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:40,003
Vance is always gone,
so I think it'll be a win-win.

263
00:19:40,036 --> 00:19:41,403
Yeah.

264
00:19:43,572 --> 00:19:46,441
How do you think they make
that work, the long-distance?

265
00:19:46,475 --> 00:19:48,410
I don't know, they communicate?

266
00:19:49,913 --> 00:19:52,916
Heh, wait, wait, wait.
What was that?

267
00:19:52,949 --> 00:19:55,651
- What?
- The thing underneath the thing

268
00:19:55,684 --> 00:19:58,221
that you just said.

269
00:19:58,254 --> 00:19:59,789
Why didn't you tell me

270
00:19:59,822 --> 00:20:02,624
that Vance offered you
a job in Seattle?

271
00:20:02,658 --> 00:20:04,193
Because I wasn't gonna take it.

272
00:20:04,227 --> 00:20:07,096
But why didn't you tell me
that you weren't gonna take it?

273
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,132
Here I am,
begging you to come with me,

274
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:11,901
- just to find out that...
- He kept on harping on me.

275
00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:13,970
It wasn't something
I wanted to deal with.

276
00:20:14,003 --> 00:20:16,873
Remember, at the time,
I had no idea you were going.

277
00:20:18,274 --> 00:20:20,043
We do need to stop

278
00:20:20,076 --> 00:20:21,978
keeping secrets from each other.

279
00:20:24,513 --> 00:20:25,782
Agreed.

280
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:46,736
We'll have fun
this weekend, okay?

281
00:20:47,804 --> 00:20:48,938
Okay.

282
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,124
You look like popeye.

283
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:14,197
- A very sexy popeye, come on.
- Get up, we're gonna be late.

284
00:21:19,202 --> 00:21:21,304
We could've just met you there,
couldn't we?

285
00:21:21,337 --> 00:21:23,006
Why did we have to
all come together?

286
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,574
- We could've made our own way.
- It's a long drive.

287
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:26,943
And this way, we get to have

288
00:21:26,976 --> 00:21:29,544
some very much needed
family time.

289
00:21:29,578 --> 00:21:30,545
Yeah.

290
00:21:30,579 --> 00:21:31,914
Much needed, great.

291
00:21:33,016 --> 00:21:34,817
You're lucky I love you.

292
00:21:36,085 --> 00:21:39,889
Okay, I spy with my little eye

293
00:21:39,922 --> 00:21:41,124
something black.

294
00:21:41,157 --> 00:21:44,293
Black. Easy, hardin's soul.

295
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:45,962
- Oh, yeah, ha-ha!
- Hey!

296
00:21:45,995 --> 00:21:47,196
- Come on, boys!
- That's why.

297
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,065
- Boys...
- That's why your soul is black.

298
00:21:49,098 --> 00:21:50,933
Hey, don't touch this!

299
00:22:13,923 --> 00:22:15,124
Shut up!

300
00:22:33,943 --> 00:22:36,045
Are you still going to New York?

301
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:40,817
Yeah, I've got everything set up
at nyu, so I'm just gonna...

302
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,286
I guess, go with the flow,
you know?

303
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:47,056
Mmm. I need
to get better at that.

304
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:50,726
Are you having...
You having second thoughts?

305
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,796
And third and fourth
and fifth and...

306
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,933
I don't know. I'm just worried
that I made the wrong decision.

307
00:22:56,966 --> 00:23:00,669
- Tess...
- It's just, apparently...

308
00:23:00,702 --> 00:23:05,141
Hardin wanted me to go england
with him after graduation.

309
00:23:05,174 --> 00:23:07,977
And I don't know.
Maybe I should.

310
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,712
You've been
gushing about Seattle

311
00:23:10,746 --> 00:23:12,381
since the day I first met you.

312
00:23:12,415 --> 00:23:13,950
Why stray from your path?

313
00:23:15,251 --> 00:23:18,154
- Go with the flow?
- No, no.

314
00:23:18,187 --> 00:23:20,957
Cop-out. That's not you.
That's me.

315
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,792
You have to do you.

316
00:23:22,825 --> 00:23:25,027
Yeah, and what about him?

317
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:28,231
What about him?
Mr. Grumpy? He's...

318
00:23:28,264 --> 00:23:32,101
If he loves you, he could...

319
00:23:32,135 --> 00:23:33,836
Follow you. I'm just saying.

320
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,073
Ooh! Wow.

321
00:23:37,106 --> 00:23:39,742
Mm, some hard truth.
It's tough love.

322
00:23:39,775 --> 00:23:42,879
- I'm gonna need more wine.
- Good luck.

323
00:23:46,449 --> 00:23:48,851
See? Did you see...?

324
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:18,181
I don't want to lose this.

325
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,885
I don't either.

326
00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:29,158
But, "if adventures
will not befall

327
00:24:29,192 --> 00:24:32,261
a young lady in her own village,
she must seek them abroad."

328
00:24:33,829 --> 00:24:35,498
But, "there is nothing
like staying

329
00:24:35,531 --> 00:24:37,033
at home for real comfort."

330
00:24:38,367 --> 00:24:39,936
"You Pierce my soul.

331
00:24:39,969 --> 00:24:42,205
I'm half agony, half hope."

332
00:24:42,238 --> 00:24:44,207
"We are all fools in love."

333
00:24:47,343 --> 00:24:48,844
I thought you were Darcy.

334
00:24:48,878 --> 00:24:51,180
And you've just been
Jane Austen the whole time.

335
00:24:59,555 --> 00:25:02,124
So are you gonna show me
what you're writing there?

336
00:25:02,158 --> 00:25:04,860
I... maybe.

337
00:25:04,894 --> 00:25:05,894
Someday.

338
00:25:09,065 --> 00:25:10,399
Someday.

339
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:21,344
- Reservation for Scott.
- Yes, Mr. Scott. Right this way.

340
00:25:29,385 --> 00:25:32,455
- Thank you.
- Hardin?

341
00:25:32,488 --> 00:25:36,492
- Ha! Hey, Lilly. How are you?
- Mm!

342
00:25:36,525 --> 00:25:38,828
- How are you?
- No fucking way.

343
00:25:38,861 --> 00:25:40,896
- Long time, huh?
- It's been forever.

344
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,966
- This is Tessa. Tessa, Lillian.
- Hi.

345
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,501
Nice dress.

346
00:25:49,238 --> 00:25:50,940
I'll be over in a second.

347
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,447
I might get something
different, but...

348
00:25:58,481 --> 00:26:00,082
Really?

349
00:26:00,116 --> 00:26:01,917
Crab cakes.

350
00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:04,487
- Good evening, folks.
- Yes. Good evening.

351
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,555
I'm Robert. I'll be
taking care of you tonight.

352
00:26:06,589 --> 00:26:08,924
Can I get you started
with a round of drinks?

353
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:11,927
Yeah. I think we'll do
a bottle of cab for the table.

354
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:14,830
- And some water for us.
- I think we're ready to order.

355
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:17,833
- Great, what'll it be?
- You're gonna get the...

356
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,503
- Crab cakes.
- Yes. And I'm gonna get the...

357
00:26:20,536 --> 00:26:22,238
- Fish and chips.
- Fish and chips.

358
00:26:22,271 --> 00:26:24,573
And also, we would
like to get a sablefish

359
00:26:24,607 --> 00:26:26,409
for after the meal to take home.

360
00:26:26,442 --> 00:26:28,010
That's a good choice.

361
00:26:29,512 --> 00:26:31,881
- And for you?
- Um, is there anything

362
00:26:31,914 --> 00:26:33,582
that you'd recommend?

363
00:26:33,616 --> 00:26:37,086
The cedar-planked salmon
is our specialty.

364
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:40,923
Okay. I'm more into like pasta?

365
00:26:40,956 --> 00:26:43,192
Carbs, yeah. I love carbs.

366
00:26:43,225 --> 00:26:46,429
Um, we have
a squid-ink spaghetti.

367
00:26:47,563 --> 00:26:49,165
Um, it was lovely to see you

368
00:26:49,198 --> 00:26:52,168
and to meet you guys,
but I'll have to go. Sorry.

369
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:55,204
Too fancy. How about we
whip you up something special?

370
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,842
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

371
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,412
Can I get you anything,
or do you need a minute?

372
00:27:03,446 --> 00:27:05,981
Yeah, you can come back.

373
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:07,249
Robert.

374
00:27:09,318 --> 00:27:10,953
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you, Robert.

375
00:27:10,986 --> 00:27:12,254
Thank you.

376
00:27:18,394 --> 00:27:19,895
Alone at last.

377
00:27:22,064 --> 00:27:23,632
Ooh!

378
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:25,234
That's good.

379
00:27:29,705 --> 00:27:33,309
Come on, before they get home.

380
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,914
Ow, ow!

381
00:27:44,587 --> 00:27:47,490
I really hope they're having
more than one cocktail.

382
00:27:49,058 --> 00:27:51,660
You do kind of like it, though.

383
00:27:51,694 --> 00:27:53,496
The thrill of being caught.

384
00:28:01,437 --> 00:28:03,172
Oh, that's nice.

385
00:28:38,574 --> 00:28:39,675
Trust me.

386
00:30:55,745 --> 00:30:58,514
I really wish you
were coming to Seattle.

387
00:31:01,717 --> 00:31:05,554
- Can I ask you a question?
- Mmm.

388
00:31:05,588 --> 00:31:08,490
Does your moving to Seattle
have anything to do with Trevor?

389
00:31:12,461 --> 00:31:18,400
No. No. I mean...
We barely even talk anymore.

390
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:26,108
Did you ever
have feelings for him?

391
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,645
- That's two questions.
- Tess, be honest.

392
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,590
Uh, there was a moment when...

393
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:46,796
Hey! Seriously? That's not fair!

394
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,632
Hardin!

395
00:31:57,774 --> 00:31:59,708
<i>Leave a message.</i>

396
00:32:01,778 --> 00:32:04,580
Hey, where are you?
Can you give me a call back?

397
00:32:41,717 --> 00:32:45,354
- Robert.
- Right. Um, Tessa.

398
00:32:45,387 --> 00:32:46,923
So, what are you doing out here?

399
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:52,829
I had a fight with my...

400
00:32:52,862 --> 00:32:54,998
It's complicated.

401
00:32:55,031 --> 00:32:58,534
Well, a few of us are doing
after hours, if you wanna join.

402
00:32:58,567 --> 00:33:00,737
- Um, yeah.
- Yeah?

403
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,237
- Yeah.
- Okay.

404
00:33:03,706 --> 00:33:05,975
Heh, you probably
should've worn a coat.

405
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:13,649
- So you live here, right?
- Born and raised.

406
00:33:13,682 --> 00:33:16,285
But I actually just got
into med school.

407
00:33:16,318 --> 00:33:18,788
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah, so just working here,

408
00:33:18,822 --> 00:33:19,856
saving up till then.

409
00:33:19,889 --> 00:33:21,724
- Wow, congratulations.
- Thanks.

410
00:33:21,758 --> 00:33:23,392
Where are you going?

411
00:33:23,425 --> 00:33:24,828
Uw was my dream,

412
00:33:24,861 --> 00:33:26,930
but mount sinai gave me
a scholarship

413
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:30,299
- I couldn't pass up, so...
- Mount sinai is in...?

414
00:33:30,332 --> 00:33:31,868
- NYC.
- Okay.

415
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:33,870
New York City.
You've heard of it.

416
00:33:33,903 --> 00:33:35,604
The big apple, you know?

417
00:33:35,637 --> 00:33:38,574
And Nora, actually, Nora and I
went to undergrad together

418
00:33:38,607 --> 00:33:41,710
and then she moved out there,
so I'll know someone.

419
00:33:41,745 --> 00:33:43,612
Talking shit? Yeah?

420
00:33:43,645 --> 00:33:45,614
She's already got
the New York attitude.

421
00:33:45,647 --> 00:33:48,383
- Tess. Hey.
- Hey! Hey.

422
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:50,652
Okay, so this is Robert,
and this is Nora.

423
00:33:50,686 --> 00:33:53,722
Yes, there will be a test
afterwards.

424
00:33:53,757 --> 00:33:55,825
And they both live in New York.

425
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:57,761
Thank you.

426
00:33:57,794 --> 00:33:59,796
In New York? Pleasure.

427
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,331
Hey! What? Oh, my god!

428
00:34:03,532 --> 00:34:05,869
How are you? It's been...

429
00:34:05,902 --> 00:34:08,604
- You remember Robert, right?
- Yeah.

430
00:34:08,637 --> 00:34:11,440
I remember Robert. I'll do
an old fashioned, actually.

431
00:34:11,473 --> 00:34:13,042
Oh. I'm off, actually.

432
00:34:13,076 --> 00:34:15,812
You're still wearing your
name tag and your uniform, so...

433
00:34:18,413 --> 00:34:20,884
So I heard
that you're moving to Seattle.

434
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:23,652
Yeah, um, I'm actually
transferring for work.

435
00:34:23,685 --> 00:34:25,721
Ah, I'm jealous.

436
00:34:25,755 --> 00:34:27,623
I'd much rather be
in Seattle than New York.

437
00:34:27,656 --> 00:34:29,658
I keep telling hardin
he should give it a shot.

438
00:34:29,691 --> 00:34:32,594
- It's not for me.
- No, it's not for him.

439
00:34:32,628 --> 00:34:33,739
- It's the best.
- It's the best.

440
00:34:33,763 --> 00:34:35,397
It is, yeah.
My girlfriend and I,

441
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:37,801
we've lived in capitol hill
for a few years now.

442
00:34:37,834 --> 00:34:41,370
- Oh, your girlfriend?
- Yeah, my girlfriend, Riley.

443
00:34:41,403 --> 00:34:43,705
We should probably leave now.

444
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,675
I don't really
wanna go just yet.

445
00:34:49,411 --> 00:34:50,947
I'm gonna head home.

446
00:34:55,952 --> 00:34:57,553
Let me walk you out.

447
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,462
- I'm really sorry about all of...
- You don't have to apologize.

448
00:35:07,496 --> 00:35:08,832
Sorry.

449
00:35:08,865 --> 00:35:11,100
Sorry. Heh!

450
00:35:11,134 --> 00:35:12,969
I don't know why I do that.

451
00:35:14,503 --> 00:35:16,705
I could guess, but I won't.

452
00:35:21,778 --> 00:35:24,013
Um, it was nice meeting you.

453
00:35:24,047 --> 00:35:26,615
You too.

454
00:35:26,648 --> 00:35:28,017
And thanks for...

455
00:35:29,886 --> 00:35:30,887
Mm-hm.

456
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,992
I'm not expecting anything,

457
00:35:36,025 --> 00:35:40,063
but if someday you find
yourself in the city...

458
00:35:42,899 --> 00:35:46,102
Give me a call. Or don't.

459
00:35:46,135 --> 00:35:47,737
It's up to you.

460
00:36:09,058 --> 00:36:10,860
Hey.

461
00:36:10,894 --> 00:36:12,929
Hey.

462
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,063
Morning.

463
00:36:21,738 --> 00:36:24,640
- What's that face?
- How was... how was last night?

464
00:36:24,673 --> 00:36:27,709
Oh, it was good. It was...
It was fine.

465
00:36:27,744 --> 00:36:29,078
Nora's nice. She's, uh...

466
00:36:29,112 --> 00:36:31,848
She's kind of a big deal
on the restaurant scene,

467
00:36:31,881 --> 00:36:34,549
so she's gonna show me around
when I get to New York.

468
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:37,452
- That's really convenient.
- It's all about... heh-heh.

469
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:42,825
How was... How was the hot tub?

470
00:37:10,987 --> 00:37:12,487
Guess what Landon found.

471
00:37:25,301 --> 00:37:28,704
I thought that we were gonna be
more open with each other.

472
00:37:34,844 --> 00:37:36,746
So did I.

473
00:37:36,779 --> 00:37:39,648
I didn't ask for his number.
He just gave it to me. It...

474
00:37:39,681 --> 00:37:42,584
No. I just found another
guy's number in your things.

475
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,689
You made it look like you were
with Lillian last night.

476
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,726
- Lillian's my friend.
- So is he.

477
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:51,794
You guys just met.
How could you be friends?

478
00:37:51,828 --> 00:37:55,064
You do this. You sabotage
every good moment that we have.

479
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:57,699
No. If I wanted to try
and sabotage a good moment,

480
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:59,736
I would have brought
up your moment with Trevor,

481
00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:02,105
- but I'll do one at a time.
- Why can't you let things be?

482
00:38:02,138 --> 00:38:04,639
- Like, let us be happy for once.
- Tess, you must admit,

483
00:38:04,673 --> 00:38:07,276
if I were moving away
with an admitted love interest,

484
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,846
- you'd have feelings about that.
- Love interest?

485
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:11,814
We're friends. From work.

486
00:38:11,848 --> 00:38:13,750
You don't get to choose
who I have as friends.

487
00:38:13,783 --> 00:38:15,985
They don't wanna
be your fucking friends!

488
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:17,920
Then why can't you
just trust me?

489
00:38:17,954 --> 00:38:20,089
I do trust you.
It's them I don't trust.

490
00:38:20,123 --> 00:38:21,656
No, you don't.

491
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,760
You don't trust me.
You don't trust anyone.

492
00:38:23,793 --> 00:38:24,961
You just control them.

493
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:33,936
Is this really about them,
or is this about me moving?

494
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,939
The irony is, I got you
the damn job in the first place.

495
00:38:36,973 --> 00:38:40,675
I mean, I might have had
something to do with it.

496
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:42,677
Tess, how many freshmen
do you know

497
00:38:42,711 --> 00:38:44,280
with jobs
at top publishing firms,

498
00:38:44,313 --> 00:38:47,582
their transfer's taken care of,
places to live, how many?

499
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,685
Wow.

500
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:53,056
This honesty thing's
really paying off for us.

501
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:54,723
So I won't...

502
00:38:54,757 --> 00:38:58,027
I won't give up Seattle for
you, so you just turn on me?

503
00:39:00,763 --> 00:39:03,066
There is a big difference
between not being able

504
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:05,068
to live without someone
and loving them.

505
00:39:21,384 --> 00:39:24,320
He is scared of losing you.
He loves you.

506
00:39:24,353 --> 00:39:27,990
He knows you're the best thing
that's ever happened to him.

507
00:39:28,024 --> 00:39:31,227
- Well...
- No, Tessa, it's true.

508
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,730
You've changed his life.
He knows it.

509
00:39:34,764 --> 00:39:35,998
We all know it.

510
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,103
You stay in touch. Okay.

511
00:39:40,136 --> 00:39:41,636
Bye.

512
00:40:42,465 --> 00:40:44,834
She's gonna thrive
up there, man.

513
00:40:44,867 --> 00:40:46,435
What, and that's a bad thing?

514
00:40:48,471 --> 00:40:52,008
This is a big step for her.
You should be happy for her.

515
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:53,276
I am.

516
00:40:56,112 --> 00:40:57,712
I am happy.

517
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,957
You could come with her.
I've got loads of work for you...

518
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,259
- I don't wanna do that.
- You'd get great benefits.

519
00:41:10,293 --> 00:41:12,361
I don't want your handouts.

520
00:41:12,395 --> 00:41:14,197
I'm sorry, I...

521
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:17,099
They're the reason I'm here,
and I don't want any more help.

522
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:20,903
Tessa didn't get a favor.

523
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,738
She's excellent.

524
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:24,207
She earned this position.

525
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:28,444
She does deserve it.

526
00:41:31,247 --> 00:41:33,382
I'm sure she'll do smashingly.

527
00:41:49,398 --> 00:41:50,866
Tessa?

528
00:41:55,204 --> 00:41:56,405
Tess?

529
00:42:00,109 --> 00:42:02,178
Tess?

530
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,217
<i>Pain.</i>

531
00:43:15,251 --> 00:43:16,385
<i>Lately, I've become</i>

532
00:43:16,419 --> 00:43:18,487
<i>very well acquainted with it.</i>

533
00:43:18,521 --> 00:43:21,924
<i>The slow and steady aching pain,</i>

534
00:43:21,957 --> 00:43:24,427
<i>the type that comes when
you've been hurt repeatedly</i>

535
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,195
<i>by the same person.</i>

536
00:43:32,968 --> 00:43:35,204
<i>You finally breathe,</i>

537
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:37,973
<i>thinking that yesterday's
problem will stay in the past</i>

538
00:43:38,007 --> 00:43:41,077
<i>when, in fact,
it's today's problem,</i>

539
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:42,411
<i>tomorrow's problem,</i>

540
00:43:42,445 --> 00:43:44,947
<i>and the problem
of every day after that.</i>

541
00:43:49,385 --> 00:43:52,988
<i>Only in those rare moments
when he pulls me to his chest</i>

542
00:43:53,022 --> 00:43:55,624
<i>and makes promises
he never seems able to keep</i>

543
00:43:55,658 --> 00:43:57,560
<i>does the pain disappear.</i>

544
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:09,105
Shit. She looks upset.

545
00:44:11,073 --> 00:44:12,441
- Hey!
- Hey!

546
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,644
Let me take that
for you upstairs.

547
00:44:15,678 --> 00:44:17,079
Oh, thanks.

548
00:44:19,382 --> 00:44:21,650
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

549
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,955
Well, you look...

550
00:44:28,391 --> 00:44:29,625
terrible.

551
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,495
Come here.

552
00:45:10,132 --> 00:45:11,400
Oh, uh, excuse me.

553
00:45:11,434 --> 00:45:13,602
Do you guys know
where Bagley hall is?

554
00:46:39,188 --> 00:46:41,357
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey.

555
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:43,192
<i>Hey. What's going on?</i>

556
00:46:43,225 --> 00:46:44,761
<i>Hardin, come back here!</i>

557
00:47:01,845 --> 00:47:04,280
Tess, wait. Don't hang up.
That was iskra, my trainer.

558
00:47:04,313 --> 00:47:06,348
- I'm at the gym.
- I'm kicking his ass, Tess!

559
00:47:06,382 --> 00:47:08,484
And he is not kicking my ass.

560
00:47:08,517 --> 00:47:10,820
I didn't mean to hang up.

561
00:47:10,854 --> 00:47:12,822
I think you did,
and I know exactly why,

562
00:47:12,856 --> 00:47:16,492
'cause I would have
thought the same thing.

563
00:47:16,525 --> 00:47:19,361
Yeah, I'm a little relieved.

564
00:47:19,395 --> 00:47:21,530
It's nice,
showing Landon the ropes.

565
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:24,533
<i>Don't take all day.</i>

566
00:47:24,567 --> 00:47:25,567
<i>Okay, one minute.</i>

567
00:47:27,771 --> 00:47:29,104
You okay, though?

568
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:31,574
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

569
00:47:31,607 --> 00:47:33,375
How was the drive down?
Was it not too long?

570
00:47:33,409 --> 00:47:35,611
<i>It was good, but when
you get in the city,</i>

571
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,546
<i>the traffic's terrible.</i>

572
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,849
It takes like 20 minutes
to go a mile.

573
00:47:41,584 --> 00:47:42,852
And Vance and Kimberly's?

574
00:47:42,886 --> 00:47:44,386
Yeah, yeah, it's great.

575
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,455
The, um... The place is amazing.

576
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:48,357
It's like...

577
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:50,593
It's huge. It's like a palace.

578
00:47:50,626 --> 00:47:51,728
Nice.

579
00:47:52,896 --> 00:47:55,497
<i>I'm really glad, Tess.</i>

580
00:47:58,233 --> 00:48:00,402
- I'm sorry I hurt you.
- <i>You don't...</i>

581
00:48:00,436 --> 00:48:02,471
No, I...

582
00:48:04,273 --> 00:48:05,909
I just want you to be happy.

583
00:48:05,942 --> 00:48:07,409
You deserve to be happy.

584
00:48:09,578 --> 00:48:11,180
It's cool that you're boxing.

585
00:48:11,213 --> 00:48:13,917
I know, right?
I really fucking like it.

586
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:15,752
It's nice to be able
to punch people

587
00:48:15,785 --> 00:48:17,286
and not have anyone
call the police.

588
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,858
I think that
that's a step forward.

589
00:48:23,492 --> 00:48:24,894
Right?

590
00:48:26,228 --> 00:48:27,596
I'm trying a new approach.

591
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:29,665
Hardin. This is not
leisure hour. Come on.

592
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:32,368
I really have to go now,
but I'm so glad you called.

593
00:48:32,401 --> 00:48:34,436
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

594
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:35,905
All right. We'll talk soon.

595
00:48:35,939 --> 00:48:38,273
- <i>Bye, Tess.</i>
- Bye.

596
00:48:49,853 --> 00:48:53,188
- Yes.
- He's a pretty boy.

597
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:55,859
You scared to fight Landon?
You heard... oh, shit!

598
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:57,526
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

599
00:49:07,837 --> 00:49:09,906
Vance publishing, please hold.

600
00:49:15,979 --> 00:49:17,981
Selfies, huh?

601
00:49:18,014 --> 00:49:22,952
No, I was... I was just
showing hardin my new office.

602
00:49:22,986 --> 00:49:24,620
Mm-hm.

603
00:49:26,823 --> 00:49:28,624
Seattle looks good on you.

604
00:49:44,707 --> 00:49:47,342
So how's it going?

605
00:49:48,778 --> 00:49:52,816
Fine. Yeah.
I mean, work, school.

606
00:49:52,849 --> 00:49:55,451
It's a lot, but it's fine.

607
00:49:55,484 --> 00:49:57,686
Give it time. You'll settle in.

608
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,622
You'll find a place.
It's exciting.

609
00:50:00,656 --> 00:50:02,826
Are you sure
that you don't want a glass?

610
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,764
I think she might be
on to us, darling.

611
00:50:07,797 --> 00:50:13,002
Well, we have some news.

612
00:50:13,036 --> 00:50:14,838
We just found out...

613
00:50:14,871 --> 00:50:16,672
We're having a baby.

614
00:50:16,705 --> 00:50:20,309
Are you kidding?
I'm so happy for you guys.

615
00:50:20,342 --> 00:50:22,678
I'm gonna tell hardin though,
if that's all right with you.

616
00:50:22,711 --> 00:50:24,013
Yeah, yeah, of course.

617
00:50:24,047 --> 00:50:25,714
Ken mentioned that he'd managed

618
00:50:25,749 --> 00:50:28,383
to get his gpa up to a 4.0.

619
00:50:28,417 --> 00:50:30,486
He must be looking forward
to graduating.

620
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:35,424
Yeah, that's great.
Um, I didn't even know that.

621
00:50:35,457 --> 00:50:36,558
It's because of you.

622
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:40,063
I mean,
I didn't write his papers.

623
00:50:40,096 --> 00:50:43,699
No, well...
Maybe not, I'm sure he did that.

624
00:50:43,733 --> 00:50:46,069
But, well, he has got
a gift, that boy.

625
00:50:46,102 --> 00:50:47,569
But he's stubborn as hell.

626
00:50:47,603 --> 00:50:48,838
You're one to talk.

627
00:50:49,939 --> 00:50:51,841
Touché.

628
00:50:55,078 --> 00:50:56,946
Well, I should get some sleep,

629
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,782
but I will see
you guys tomorrow?

630
00:50:58,815 --> 00:51:00,750
Yeah, of course.

631
00:51:00,784 --> 00:51:02,852
And you should take this.

632
00:51:02,886 --> 00:51:04,821
It's too nice of a bottle
to go to waste.

633
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:06,588
- Yes, please.
- Don't worry about me.

634
00:51:06,622 --> 00:51:07,991
I won't have any.

635
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:10,559
- You don't need any more.
- Good night, darling.

636
00:51:10,592 --> 00:51:12,528
- Good night.
- You have to suffer like me.

637
00:51:17,767 --> 00:51:21,403
There you are.
I just got back from the gym.

638
00:51:21,436 --> 00:51:22,872
<i>You did?</i>

639
00:51:22,906 --> 00:51:27,609
Wow, you must be getting
pretty good.

640
00:51:29,846 --> 00:51:31,114
Are you drunk?

641
00:51:31,147 --> 00:51:33,382
I was hanging out
with Vance and Kimberly,

642
00:51:33,415 --> 00:51:36,685
and she gave me
the rest of the bottle.

643
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:37,854
Oh, yeah?

644
00:51:37,887 --> 00:51:39,923
So how much wine have you had?

645
00:51:39,956 --> 00:51:43,059
I'm on my...

646
00:51:43,092 --> 00:51:44,560
Third?

647
00:51:44,593 --> 00:51:49,732
<i>You were actually
quite the topic.</i>

648
00:51:49,766 --> 00:51:51,667
You didn't answer
my call earlier.

649
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,537
<i>No, I know. I've been at work
since, like, 8:00.</i>

650
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:57,040
Except for taking
office selfies.

651
00:51:57,073 --> 00:52:00,609
- Which you didn't respond to.
- Tessa.

652
00:52:00,642 --> 00:52:02,644
Hardin Allen Scott.

653
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,748
Why are you laughing?

654
00:52:05,782 --> 00:52:08,017
It's just all so ridiculous.

655
00:52:09,518 --> 00:52:11,754
I think you need
to put that wine down.

656
00:52:11,788 --> 00:52:13,622
Make me.

657
00:52:13,655 --> 00:52:15,524
Well, I would if I was there.

658
00:52:15,557 --> 00:52:17,961
<i>What else would you make me do?</i>

659
00:52:19,162 --> 00:52:20,662
<i>Theresa Lynn young,</i>

660
00:52:20,696 --> 00:52:23,066
are you trying
to have phone sex with me?

661
00:52:25,201 --> 00:52:27,737
Tell me what you would do
if you were here.

662
00:52:29,504 --> 00:52:32,708
- Are you lying in your bed?
- <i>Mm-hm.</i>

663
00:52:32,742 --> 00:52:34,110
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

664
00:52:35,644 --> 00:52:37,646
- Are they closed?
- <i>Mm-hm.</i>

665
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:38,848
Are you sure?

666
00:52:57,666 --> 00:53:00,669
Fuck, I wish I was there
watching you right now.

667
00:53:00,702 --> 00:53:04,173
You like that, don't you?
Watching me?

668
00:53:05,674 --> 00:53:07,176
Fuck, yeah, I do.

669
00:53:12,749 --> 00:53:13,816
<i>How'd you sleep?</i>

670
00:53:15,151 --> 00:53:16,185
<i>Good.</i>

671
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:19,789
Not as good as I do with you.

672
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:21,690
I know the feeling.

673
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,663
Come here. I miss you.

674
00:53:27,696 --> 00:53:29,866
I miss you too.

675
00:53:29,899 --> 00:53:32,701
Don't say "too." It sounds like
you're just agreeing with me.

676
00:53:38,107 --> 00:53:40,209
I love you.

677
00:53:40,243 --> 00:53:41,844
I love you.

678
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:11,107
Tessa? Tessa?

679
00:54:12,641 --> 00:54:16,179
Tess! No, no, no, Tessa! Tessa!

680
00:54:18,247 --> 00:54:21,818
Tessa! Tessa!

681
00:54:21,851 --> 00:54:23,052
Tess!

682
00:54:23,086 --> 00:54:24,854
No, no, no!

683
00:54:29,292 --> 00:54:31,194
- I love you.
- I love you too.

684
00:54:33,863 --> 00:54:36,032
Fuck you! No, no!

685
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:12,068
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

686
00:55:14,703 --> 00:55:17,073
What... what are you doing here?

687
00:55:17,106 --> 00:55:20,176
Well, I came to see you.
But I can leave.

688
00:55:23,046 --> 00:55:24,147
No.

689
00:55:26,349 --> 00:55:28,084
- I'm gonna get my bags.
- Mm-mm.

690
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:35,792
Give us a hand.

691
00:55:37,794 --> 00:55:39,962
What's the fastest
train you've been on?

692
00:55:39,996 --> 00:55:41,864
- There's this train in Japan.
- Oh, hey!

693
00:55:41,898 --> 00:55:43,166
- Hey, hey.
- Hardin.

694
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:44,333
Smith, what's up?

695
00:55:44,367 --> 00:55:45,935
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

696
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:47,270
He asked if he could stay,

697
00:55:47,303 --> 00:55:49,872
and I thought you might
be all right with that.

698
00:55:49,906 --> 00:55:52,241
It's a lovely place.
Where should I drop my stuff?

699
00:55:52,275 --> 00:55:53,976
- Uh, let me show you.
- Cool.

700
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:55,878
I'll call you guys
when dinner's ready.

701
00:55:55,912 --> 00:55:58,247
- Sounds good.
- It's this way.

702
00:55:58,281 --> 00:56:00,715
It's nice to see
a smile back on her face.

703
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:01,750
It is.

704
00:56:08,224 --> 00:56:10,993
So, um, I found this.

705
00:56:12,195 --> 00:56:13,695
And I'm really sorry,

706
00:56:13,729 --> 00:56:16,032
but once I picked it up,
I couldn't put it down.

707
00:56:24,073 --> 00:56:27,143
You're a brilliant writer, Tess.

708
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:29,345
And I came across
that page about pain

709
00:56:29,378 --> 00:56:31,914
and I just wanted to apologize.

710
00:56:31,948 --> 00:56:33,950
The way I made you feel
is inexcusable.

711
00:56:33,983 --> 00:56:36,252
So I'm sorry.

712
00:56:36,285 --> 00:56:39,222
I didn't mean for you
to read any of this...

713
00:56:39,255 --> 00:56:41,124
- I'm sure you didn't.
- It's pretty raw.

714
00:56:42,325 --> 00:56:43,826
I needed to hear it.

715
00:56:45,161 --> 00:56:46,762
In your words.

716
00:56:46,796 --> 00:56:49,799
And I fucking hate myself

717
00:56:49,832 --> 00:56:52,235
for making you feel that way,
but I'm sorry.

718
00:56:56,806 --> 00:56:58,908
Thank you.

719
00:56:58,941 --> 00:57:00,409
Hey! Steaks are on!

720
00:57:03,479 --> 00:57:05,014
Be right there!

721
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,456
Oh.

722
00:57:13,489 --> 00:57:14,891
Will we?

723
00:57:21,397 --> 00:57:23,399
<i>I love you too.</i>

724
00:57:26,035 --> 00:57:28,304
We shouldn't keep them waiting.

725
00:57:28,337 --> 00:57:30,940
What? I mean,
I'm sure that they're fine.

726
00:57:30,973 --> 00:57:32,141
Come on, I'm hungry.

727
00:57:39,248 --> 00:57:41,417
He really wants me to go.
He keeps talking

728
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:43,986
about me wearing the hat
and the gown and everything.

729
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:46,989
- What's so bad about that?
- It just looks ridiculous.

730
00:57:47,023 --> 00:57:49,234
Can you imagine me in the hat
and the gown and everything?

731
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:50,860
I don't even wanna go
to the ceremony.

732
00:57:50,893 --> 00:57:52,929
I can't imagine it,
but I really wanna see it.

733
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:56,499
You gotta celebrate
your accomplishments.

734
00:57:56,532 --> 00:57:58,367
You don't wanna
look back and regret

735
00:57:58,401 --> 00:58:00,836
having not had
those experiences.

736
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:03,272
Trust me, I know firsthand.

737
00:58:05,208 --> 00:58:07,443
- I'll give it some thought.
- I think you should.

738
00:58:09,045 --> 00:58:10,446
- Hey, buddy.
- Hi.

739
00:58:10,479 --> 00:58:12,315
This needs turning,
do you wanna do it?

740
00:58:12,348 --> 00:58:14,784
- Why not?
- Okay. There you go. Grab that.

741
00:58:14,817 --> 00:58:18,287
- This is really nice.
- Yeah.

742
00:58:18,321 --> 00:58:23,025
You know, all of us
together, under one roof.

743
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:26,329
- Here we all are.
- Yeah.

744
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:32,134
- Well, tonight, anyway.
- Oh, come on.

745
00:58:32,168 --> 00:58:34,470
You two will work it out.

746
00:58:34,503 --> 00:58:36,405
Sometimes distance is
a good thing.

747
00:58:36,439 --> 00:58:37,740
Mmm.

748
00:58:38,874 --> 00:58:39,874
You think so?

749
00:58:41,477 --> 00:58:43,145
Honestly, I have no idea.

750
00:58:46,282 --> 00:58:49,452
Look, relationships...

751
00:58:51,988 --> 00:58:53,322
They're complicated.

752
01:00:06,062 --> 01:00:07,096
Hey.

753
01:00:25,014 --> 01:00:26,215
Did I do something?

754
01:00:30,019 --> 01:00:33,222
You've barely said a word to me
the whole night.

755
01:00:47,036 --> 01:00:49,438
I had this horrible dream
of you and Robert.

756
01:00:52,408 --> 01:00:55,411
I can't get it
out of my fucking head.

757
01:01:01,417 --> 01:01:04,019
But I'm here with you.

758
01:01:07,723 --> 01:01:09,458
That's exactly it.

759
01:01:14,997 --> 01:01:18,167
I can't help but think that
you should be with someone else.

760
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:23,472
Your life would be
so much easier.

761
01:01:29,345 --> 01:01:30,679
There's all this bad shit

762
01:01:30,713 --> 01:01:33,082
that I've been trying
to suppress for so long.

763
01:01:33,115 --> 01:01:34,517
It's just all coming up.

764
01:01:35,718 --> 01:01:37,553
And there's nothing I can do.

765
01:01:39,422 --> 01:01:42,057
The thought of losing you
is just, heh...

766
01:01:42,091 --> 01:01:44,160
It's pretty fucking dark
in here, Tess.

767
01:01:50,299 --> 01:01:52,067
Why didn't you just tell me?

768
01:01:52,101 --> 01:01:54,236
That's the whole point
of being open...

769
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:57,606
Because it's a burden for me,
and I don't wanna burden you.

770
01:02:09,452 --> 01:02:12,455
I don't want to be
with anyone else.

771
01:02:14,590 --> 01:02:16,292
I wanna be with you.

772
01:02:20,496 --> 01:02:21,597
Hey.

773
01:02:47,056 --> 01:02:49,492
Fuck me until
you forget about that dream.

774
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:52,221
Oh, fuck.

775
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:58,127
Look in the mirror.

776
01:04:00,496 --> 01:04:02,732
Oh, yes, baby.

777
01:04:02,766 --> 01:04:05,467
- You close?
- Yeah.

778
01:04:45,742 --> 01:04:47,710
We didn't
use protection last night.

779
01:04:50,646 --> 01:04:52,147
Yeah, I know.

780
01:04:53,783 --> 01:04:56,585
I'll have to go
to the drugstore tonight.

781
01:04:56,619 --> 01:04:58,721
I should get on the pill anyway.

782
01:05:03,392 --> 01:05:04,392
Yeah.

783
01:05:05,762 --> 01:05:08,330
Yeah, you with no condom,
on a regular basis,

784
01:05:08,364 --> 01:05:09,866
that's gonna work for me.

785
01:05:21,677 --> 01:05:23,145
Here are the kids.

786
01:05:27,216 --> 01:05:28,517
Hey, hey.

787
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:31,220
You look in better spirits
this morning.

788
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:35,792
Yeah, think I just needed
a good night's sleep.

789
01:05:39,863 --> 01:05:41,731
Oh, it's mom. One sec, guys.

790
01:05:41,765 --> 01:05:43,733
- Hi, mom.
- <i>Hi, my love.</i>

791
01:05:43,767 --> 01:05:44,901
<i>How are you doing?</i>

792
01:05:44,934 --> 01:05:46,936
Good, thanks. How are you?

793
01:05:46,970 --> 01:05:49,973
That must be about the wedding.

794
01:05:50,006 --> 01:05:51,373
Uh, whose wedding?

795
01:05:53,475 --> 01:05:56,645
- Trish is...? Oh, my god.
- Yeah.

796
01:05:56,679 --> 01:05:58,748
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's amazing.

797
01:05:58,782 --> 01:06:00,649
She deserves it.

798
01:06:00,683 --> 01:06:05,554
Yeah. And Mike is a good guy.
So he'll look after her.

799
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:07,656
- Okay, let's go.
- Oh!

800
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:09,725
- Okay.
- Come on, bud.

801
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,561
- Smith.
- What?

802
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:13,763
Hey, hey, hey! Backpack.

803
01:06:15,364 --> 01:06:16,565
Hey.

804
01:06:17,867 --> 01:06:21,004
- Bye.
- Bye.

805
01:06:21,037 --> 01:06:23,672
I will, I will, I will.
All right.

806
01:06:23,706 --> 01:06:24,841
Bye.

807
01:06:30,612 --> 01:06:33,883
What? What?

808
01:06:33,917 --> 01:06:34,951
So?

809
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:40,723
So, what do you wanna do today?

810
01:08:11,114 --> 01:08:14,483
- Got everything?
- Yep.

811
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,696
There's nothing...

812
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:29,598
There's nothing
you've forgotten?

813
01:08:32,035 --> 01:08:34,703
No, I think I'm good.

814
01:08:38,808 --> 01:08:41,911
What happened to our not keeping
secrets from each other?

815
01:08:41,945 --> 01:08:44,646
- What are you on about?
- You're not gonna tell me

816
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:46,115
about your mom's wedding?

817
01:08:47,616 --> 01:08:48,616
Tess...

818
01:08:50,452 --> 01:08:51,955
The only reason
I haven't told you

819
01:08:51,988 --> 01:08:54,556
- is because I don't want to go.
- Okay. Why...

820
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:56,059
Why don't you wanna go?

821
01:08:56,092 --> 01:08:58,393
I thought you wanted
to show me your hometown.

822
01:08:58,427 --> 01:09:03,166
I wanna show you London. I do
not wanna show you my hometown.

823
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:05,567
If you don't wanna bring me,
I think that that's fine.

824
01:09:05,601 --> 01:09:07,703
But it's her big day.

825
01:09:07,737 --> 01:09:10,006
I really think
you need to be there for her.

826
01:09:10,039 --> 01:09:13,675
If I was going,
I would bring you, but...

827
01:09:13,709 --> 01:09:15,745
Do you know what,
I'll think about it.

828
01:09:15,778 --> 01:09:18,147
- Okay?
- Okay.

829
01:09:18,181 --> 01:09:20,582
Hey, this was a good weekend.

830
01:09:20,616 --> 01:09:22,919
- How good?
- This good.

831
01:09:25,188 --> 01:09:27,156
Better.

832
01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:30,994
Can you come back on Wednesday?
Vance is having an event.

833
01:09:32,929 --> 01:09:34,496
I'll try.

834
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:41,971
Okay.

835
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:48,771
Richard?

836
01:10:48,805 --> 01:10:50,639
I nearly smashed
your fucking head in!

837
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:54,509
What the fuck are you thinking,
breaking in here?

838
01:10:54,543 --> 01:10:57,046
You weren't here, and, uh...

839
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,514
Tess told me
where you keep the key.

840
01:10:59,548 --> 01:11:02,118
You look like shit.

841
01:11:02,151 --> 01:11:05,721
Yeah, well, uh, I owe a guy.

842
01:11:05,755 --> 01:11:08,257
- How much are you in for?
- Five hundred.

843
01:11:29,846 --> 01:11:30,846
You can take this.

844
01:11:35,018 --> 01:11:36,052
Here.

845
01:11:38,587 --> 01:11:40,655
My dad gave me that.

846
01:11:40,689 --> 01:11:41,723
I never wear it.

847
01:11:43,259 --> 01:11:45,694
It's worth a lot more
than what you need, so...

848
01:11:45,728 --> 01:11:46,728
Thanks.

849
01:11:47,997 --> 01:11:49,832
Yeah.

850
01:11:51,367 --> 01:11:53,269
I'm gonna get better for her.

851
01:11:56,139 --> 01:11:57,173
I'm gonna get better.

852
01:11:58,274 --> 01:11:59,809
I promise.

853
01:12:12,789 --> 01:12:14,857
This should protect you
from pregnancy

854
01:12:14,891 --> 01:12:16,926
for the next three months.

855
01:12:16,959 --> 01:12:19,195
My concern is...

856
01:12:19,228 --> 01:12:21,197
You may not need it.

857
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:24,300
<i>It's your cervix.</i>

858
01:12:24,333 --> 01:12:26,736
<i>You may not be able
to get pregnant.</i>

859
01:12:26,769 --> 01:12:29,072
<i>We need to do more tests
before we know.</i>

860
01:12:50,126 --> 01:12:52,161
Hmm.

861
01:12:52,195 --> 01:12:53,796
As much as I'd like to help,

862
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:55,731
by the time you apply
for the transfer,

863
01:12:55,765 --> 01:12:58,034
you register and start classes,

864
01:12:58,067 --> 01:12:59,902
I don't think
it's worth the hassle.

865
01:12:59,936 --> 01:13:01,670
And I don't think
you're gonna get

866
01:13:01,703 --> 01:13:03,172
the classes you need
to graduate.

867
01:13:03,206 --> 01:13:04,907
I figured
you were gonna say this.

868
01:13:04,941 --> 01:13:07,810
- Just thought I'd give it a try.
- It's only two months.

869
01:13:07,844 --> 01:13:10,246
And you know, it's been
one of my biggest dreams

870
01:13:10,279 --> 01:13:13,082
to see you graduate.

871
01:13:13,116 --> 01:13:15,284
I guess it hasn't always
been a given, has it?

872
01:13:15,318 --> 01:13:17,787
No, no. It hasn't.

873
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:21,023
It has been a gift,
having you here.

874
01:13:21,057 --> 01:13:25,161
And I'm grateful that you were
willing to give me a chance

875
01:13:25,194 --> 01:13:26,661
to see me sober.

876
01:13:27,763 --> 01:13:28,931
Yeah.

877
01:13:31,167 --> 01:13:32,168
When was that?

878
01:13:33,436 --> 01:13:36,072
Oh, that was freshman year.

879
01:13:36,105 --> 01:13:37,840
Your mom, Vance and I.

880
01:13:39,308 --> 01:13:40,843
Never seen it before.

881
01:13:42,411 --> 01:13:44,679
You know she's getting married.

882
01:13:44,713 --> 01:13:46,149
- To Mike?
- To Mike.

883
01:13:46,182 --> 01:13:49,118
Oh, good for her. He always
seemed like a nice guy.

884
01:13:49,152 --> 01:13:52,421
I've always thought he was a bit
of a wanker, but if she's happy.

885
01:13:53,722 --> 01:13:54,991
Two months!

886
01:13:55,024 --> 01:13:56,259
It's just gonna go like...

887
01:14:28,858 --> 01:14:30,960
- Hey!
- Hello.

888
01:14:30,993 --> 01:14:32,428
Don't you two look gorgeous.

889
01:14:32,461 --> 01:14:33,863
Obviously.

890
01:14:36,432 --> 01:14:38,968
Relax, it's soda water.

891
01:14:39,001 --> 01:14:41,871
- Did you tell him? Did...?
- Vance called me.

892
01:14:41,904 --> 01:14:45,241
- Oh.
- Well, enjoy.

893
01:14:46,475 --> 01:14:48,844
- I have to go play hostess.
- Okay.

894
01:14:53,249 --> 01:14:56,085
They were ecstatic when
I told them you were coming.

895
01:14:56,118 --> 01:14:57,286
What, just them?

896
01:14:58,821 --> 01:15:02,158
Well, I was... I was happy.

897
01:15:03,292 --> 01:15:05,127
Um...

898
01:15:05,161 --> 01:15:07,296
I do have some bad news.

899
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:08,731
Oh. Uh, what?

900
01:15:10,399 --> 01:15:12,969
It's not looking like
I'm gonna be able to get here

901
01:15:13,002 --> 01:15:15,771
- for another two months.
- What, uh...?

902
01:15:15,805 --> 01:15:17,440
What do you mean, like visit?

903
01:15:17,473 --> 01:15:19,308
Wait, what?

904
01:15:19,342 --> 01:15:21,844
What? What do you mean?

905
01:15:21,877 --> 01:15:23,779
I mean, like, for good.

906
01:15:26,249 --> 01:15:29,819
Like... uh, wait.

907
01:15:29,852 --> 01:15:32,922
- Do you mean like move here?
- It's two months, though.

908
01:15:32,955 --> 01:15:34,924
- I wonder if I should even...
- Are you serious?

909
01:15:34,957 --> 01:15:37,893
Should I call the whole thing
off? Maybe I should cancel it.

910
01:15:37,927 --> 01:15:40,463
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

911
01:15:42,565 --> 01:15:47,036
Hate to break it up,
but I wanna dance!

912
01:15:47,069 --> 01:15:48,904
Come on!

913
01:15:48,938 --> 01:15:50,840
How are you, my boy?

914
01:15:55,478 --> 01:15:57,513
- There's my boy.
- Hey.

915
01:15:57,546 --> 01:16:00,583
- How are you?
- Never better.

916
01:16:08,524 --> 01:16:11,827
- I gotta go to work.
- Go ahead.

917
01:17:24,367 --> 01:17:27,636
- Let's go. Right now. Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

918
01:17:37,646 --> 01:17:39,415
You're moving here.

919
01:17:42,718 --> 01:17:44,687
Yeah.

920
01:18:10,546 --> 01:18:12,415
Right.

921
01:18:12,448 --> 01:18:15,317
- Your elbows are up again.
- Oh, man.

922
01:18:15,351 --> 01:18:16,552
All right, then.

923
01:18:18,287 --> 01:18:19,955
You looking forward
to visiting home?

924
01:18:19,989 --> 01:18:21,257
I know I am.

925
01:18:22,759 --> 01:18:24,460
Oh, I see.

926
01:18:24,493 --> 01:18:27,363
Celebrating your mom's happiness
doesn't sound appealing?

927
01:18:27,396 --> 01:18:29,565
It's not that.

928
01:18:29,598 --> 01:18:31,167
So, what's going on?

929
01:18:34,637 --> 01:18:36,238
I really want to bring Tessa,

930
01:18:36,272 --> 01:18:38,574
but I don't want to bring her
around my old life.

931
01:18:38,607 --> 01:18:40,443
It's just a sad house
in a sad place.

932
01:18:45,014 --> 01:18:48,384
Has she ever made you feel badly
about your past?

933
01:18:48,417 --> 01:18:51,387
- No.
- The only way you can find out

934
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:55,090
if you trust her
is to trust her.

935
01:18:55,124 --> 01:18:57,660
And it'd mean the world to
Trish, having you both there.

936
01:19:04,366 --> 01:19:06,101
Look. Seriously, mate.

937
01:19:08,204 --> 01:19:11,540
Your wedding is
a moment that's...

938
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:16,645
Bigger than anything else
that you can possibly imagine.

939
01:19:16,679 --> 01:19:19,448
- Kind of changes you.
- Mm-hm.

940
01:19:19,482 --> 01:19:21,350
And that's why
they all fail, right?

941
01:19:21,383 --> 01:19:22,752
Not all of them.

942
01:19:22,786 --> 01:19:24,653
Not if you find the right one.

943
01:19:26,823 --> 01:19:30,159
You know, I believe

944
01:19:30,192 --> 01:19:33,696
that you have
two real great loves.

945
01:19:33,730 --> 01:19:37,399
So in your case,
that would be Tessa and you.

946
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:43,506
You gonna show me what you got?

947
01:19:43,539 --> 01:19:45,374
- Yeah. Come on, then.
- Aah!

948
01:20:02,558 --> 01:20:04,527
I got us tickets to england.

949
01:20:07,764 --> 01:20:09,164
Mmm...

950
01:20:26,850 --> 01:20:29,451
- Keep the change.
- Don't worry, mom. I'll get it.

951
01:20:29,485 --> 01:20:31,687
- No, no, no. I've got it.
- Hi.

952
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,722
Oh, it's so good
to see you both.

953
01:20:33,757 --> 01:20:36,292
Jesus, Tessa.
Is there a body in there?

954
01:20:36,325 --> 01:20:38,427
I didn't know how much I'd need.

955
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:39,796
Here you go.

956
01:20:39,829 --> 01:20:41,163
Thank you.

957
01:20:41,196 --> 01:20:42,698
How was the flight?

958
01:20:42,732 --> 01:20:44,466
Sorry it's not more comfortable.

959
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:47,269
I didn't expect the house
to sell on the first day.

960
01:20:47,303 --> 01:20:49,138
No, it's great.

961
01:20:49,171 --> 01:20:50,807
I left your bed up, hardin.

962
01:20:52,474 --> 01:20:54,610
I wasn't expecting
to sleep on the floor.

963
01:20:55,845 --> 01:20:58,347
It's perfect. Thank you.

964
01:20:58,380 --> 01:20:59,849
Well, you guys
must be exhausted.

965
01:20:59,883 --> 01:21:01,450
So I'll leave you to it.

966
01:21:01,483 --> 01:21:04,153
I'm staying next door at Mike's.

967
01:21:04,186 --> 01:21:05,287
Okay.

968
01:21:07,791 --> 01:21:09,625
Hey, give me a sec...

969
01:21:09,658 --> 01:21:12,628
- We're really happy for you.
- Thank you.

970
01:21:12,661 --> 01:21:14,798
I'm glad you came.

971
01:21:14,831 --> 01:21:17,232
I've gotta go to
the bridal store in the morning.

972
01:21:17,266 --> 01:21:18,802
I was wondering,
do you wanna come?

973
01:21:18,835 --> 01:21:22,504
- Yeah, I'd love to. That's...
- Great. Great.

974
01:21:22,538 --> 01:21:24,306
- Call me if you need me.
- Okay.

975
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:25,474
- Bye.
- Bye.

976
01:21:28,778 --> 01:21:31,447
Don't take any of my stuff
or go in my room,

977
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,415
and definitely don't have
any friends over, okay?

978
01:21:33,449 --> 01:21:36,251
<i>Yeah, yeah.
Hey, thanks for letting me stay here.</i>

979
01:21:36,285 --> 01:21:38,487
Yeah, well, don't thank me,
because it's not permanent.

980
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:39,823
<i>Yeah, yeah. I know.</i>

981
01:21:39,856 --> 01:21:41,791
Make sure you call
if there's a problem.

982
01:21:41,825 --> 01:21:43,860
<i>Sure thing, hardin. Bye.</i>

983
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:50,599
Who was that?

984
01:21:50,633 --> 01:21:52,468
That was a random homeless man

985
01:21:52,501 --> 01:21:54,436
who I've been letting sleep
on my couch.

986
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:56,773
All the hipsters
are doing it these days.

987
01:22:01,276 --> 01:22:03,679
- Thank you.
- Of course.

988
01:22:17,994 --> 01:22:20,429
- There's nothing to eat.
- What are you looking for?

989
01:22:20,462 --> 01:22:22,264
I don't know. Something edible.

990
01:22:22,297 --> 01:22:24,734
That I don't have to cook,
preferably.

991
01:22:24,768 --> 01:22:27,603
Look, why don't you take
the keys and go to sainsbury's.

992
01:22:27,636 --> 01:22:30,205
It'll give you something to do
when we're gone.

993
01:22:31,407 --> 01:22:32,408
Hi.

994
01:22:32,441 --> 01:22:33,777
- You ready?
- Yep.

995
01:22:37,947 --> 01:22:39,715
Are you sure
you're not jet-lagged?

996
01:22:39,749 --> 01:22:41,526
- I feel fine.
- You don't have to go, you know.

997
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:42,550
Hardin.

998
01:22:45,421 --> 01:22:47,791
Come on, Tessa. Let's do this.

999
01:23:23,492 --> 01:23:25,570
I really shouldn't. I'm sorry,
guys. Have one for me.

1000
01:23:25,594 --> 01:23:26,963
Hey, man. Come on. Man.

1001
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:39,241
Yep. That's it.

1002
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:47,483
You really look amazing.

1003
01:23:49,485 --> 01:23:51,587
It's beginning to feel real.

1004
01:23:55,524 --> 01:23:56,960
What's her dress like?

1005
01:23:58,393 --> 01:24:01,463
Mmm... I can't tell you.

1006
01:24:02,932 --> 01:24:04,666
You're seriously
not gonna tell me?

1007
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:05,969
Yeah, I can't tell you.

1008
01:24:06,002 --> 01:24:08,037
You're gonna
have to wait and see.

1009
01:24:10,606 --> 01:24:12,474
Don't care that much anyway.

1010
01:24:17,113 --> 01:24:19,481
Please tell me.

1011
01:24:19,515 --> 01:24:21,416
No, I won't tell you.

1012
01:24:27,422 --> 01:24:28,858
I'm so glad you came.

1013
01:24:30,994 --> 01:24:33,763
You're my better place, Tess.

1014
01:25:24,713 --> 01:25:26,883
- What the fuck?!
- Oh, fu...!

1015
01:25:26,916 --> 01:25:30,753
Vance! Fucking hell!

1016
01:25:30,787 --> 01:25:34,489
- It's not what you think.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

1017
01:25:34,523 --> 01:25:36,926
Well, it clearly fucking is!

1018
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,627
You're getting married tomorrow.

1019
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:41,496
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1020
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:42,999
The love of your life, Kimberly,

1021
01:25:43,032 --> 01:25:45,068
is carrying your child
while you're here...

1022
01:25:45,101 --> 01:25:46,903
- That's enough!
- What is wrong with you?

1023
01:25:46,936 --> 01:25:48,637
Hardin?

1024
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:50,073
- Vance?
- Yeah.

1025
01:25:50,106 --> 01:25:51,707
He's been fucking my mom!

1026
01:25:51,741 --> 01:25:53,542
Please, hardin, just stop it!

1027
01:25:53,575 --> 01:25:55,745
Don't yell at me. You don't
get to tell me what to do.

1028
01:25:55,778 --> 01:25:58,114
You were getting fucked
on the counter like a slag.

1029
01:25:58,147 --> 01:25:59,749
Don't you talk to your mom
like that.

1030
01:25:59,782 --> 01:26:01,416
- Oh, fuck off!
- Hey.

1031
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:03,652
Who the fuck are you
to tell me what to do, huh?

1032
01:26:03,685 --> 01:26:05,496
- You really want to know?
- No, Christian, don't.

1033
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,589
- Enough, hardin!
- Stop, stop.

1034
01:26:07,623 --> 01:26:10,559
- Hardin, please stop it!
- Stop it! Ugh!

1035
01:26:10,592 --> 01:26:12,561
Please, hardin.

1036
01:26:12,594 --> 01:26:14,898
Hardin, that's enough!

1037
01:26:14,931 --> 01:26:16,132
That's enough!

1038
01:26:17,599 --> 01:26:21,104
Enough. That's enough.

1039
01:26:21,137 --> 01:26:23,940
You're getting married tomorrow.
Did you forget?

1040
01:26:25,674 --> 01:26:28,745
Who the fuck does that?
What are you going to tell Mike?

1041
01:26:28,778 --> 01:26:31,915
Hardin, Christian and I...

1042
01:26:31,948 --> 01:26:33,415
- He's...
- What?

1043
01:26:38,054 --> 01:26:39,989
It's not that simple.

1044
01:26:48,597 --> 01:26:50,166
Okay, let's go.

1045
01:26:50,199 --> 01:26:51,734
- Tessa, don't.
- Let's go.

1046
01:26:57,273 --> 01:26:59,541
Are you all right?

1047
01:27:27,804 --> 01:27:29,238
Can you...?

1048
01:27:45,288 --> 01:27:48,557
It's okay. It's okay.

1049
01:27:48,590 --> 01:27:51,127
It is not okay.

1050
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:53,162
It's not okay.

1051
01:28:07,243 --> 01:28:11,781
- Please, don't ever let me go.
- I won't. I'll never let you go.

1052
01:28:21,723 --> 01:28:25,862
That even though
you're a superhero in my eyes,

1053
01:28:25,895 --> 01:28:27,897
you are still human.

1054
01:28:29,631 --> 01:28:33,236
Mike Richards,
do you take Trish Daniels

1055
01:28:33,269 --> 01:28:35,637
for better or worse?

1056
01:28:38,307 --> 01:28:39,541
I do.

1057
01:28:43,112 --> 01:28:44,747
I really do.

1058
01:28:49,052 --> 01:28:52,789
I'm happy to pronounce
you husband and wife.

1059
01:29:22,684 --> 01:29:24,363
- Hardin...
- I have nothing to say to you.

1060
01:29:24,387 --> 01:29:26,389
- Come on.
- Get the fuck off me!

1061
01:29:26,422 --> 01:29:28,825
Do you wanna go again, old man?

1062
01:29:28,858 --> 01:29:31,060
If that's what it takes, yeah.

1063
01:29:33,162 --> 01:29:37,366
- There's a bar in the hotel.
- A fucking bar?

1064
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:38,835
It's just down the street.

1065
01:29:40,702 --> 01:29:42,338
I'll wait there for you.

1066
01:29:57,086 --> 01:29:59,088
I can come if you want me to.

1067
01:30:01,991 --> 01:30:04,894
But either way,
I think you should go.

1068
01:30:07,296 --> 01:30:09,698
She looks like
she doesn't need telling.

1069
01:30:09,732 --> 01:30:11,767
Yeah. She definitely knows.

1070
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:16,705
I'm gonna go sit with her,
but if anything goes wrong,

1071
01:30:16,739 --> 01:30:18,274
just come find me.

1072
01:30:33,756 --> 01:30:36,993
I'm surprised to see you here.

1073
01:30:37,026 --> 01:30:38,227
Yeah.

1074
01:30:42,798 --> 01:30:47,136
I'm afraid I won't be able
to stay as angry as I am.

1075
01:30:49,005 --> 01:30:50,840
Trust me, I am.

1076
01:30:56,979 --> 01:31:00,883
But what do I do? I love him.

1077
01:31:00,917 --> 01:31:04,921
And I love the life we're
building, and I love Smith.

1078
01:31:19,001 --> 01:31:21,003
You wanted to talk, let's talk.

1079
01:31:28,878 --> 01:31:31,347
I know you feel betrayed.

1080
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:33,783
I want to explain myself.

1081
01:31:33,816 --> 01:31:36,118
But I honestly don't know
where to begin.

1082
01:31:40,089 --> 01:31:42,959
- I guess that makes us done then.
- Look, listen.

1083
01:31:45,494 --> 01:31:47,496
You are so important
to me and your mom.

1084
01:31:47,530 --> 01:31:49,532
Are you serious?

1085
01:31:49,565 --> 01:31:52,201
Now you two want to play
some sort of united front?

1086
01:31:52,235 --> 01:31:54,470
- Fuck off with that.
- You wouldn't be so angry

1087
01:31:54,503 --> 01:31:56,138
if you didn't care.

1088
01:31:58,074 --> 01:32:01,877
You know, I wish I could say
I'm surprised...

1089
01:32:04,013 --> 01:32:05,348
But I'm not.

1090
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:09,118
They have a history together.

1091
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:14,190
One that I'm not sure
I can compete with.

1092
01:32:17,393 --> 01:32:21,030
I was gonna tell you ages ago,
but your mom didn't want...

1093
01:32:23,566 --> 01:32:25,167
Tell me what?

1094
01:32:28,037 --> 01:32:29,272
Tell me what?

1095
01:32:41,450 --> 01:32:44,120
Hardin is Christian's son.

1096
01:32:56,499 --> 01:32:58,100
Fuck!

1097
01:32:58,134 --> 01:33:02,204
- You... what the fuck!
- I'm so sorry.

1098
01:33:02,238 --> 01:33:03,839
No!

1099
01:33:18,387 --> 01:33:19,889
I'm sorry.

1100
01:33:21,490 --> 01:33:23,092
I have to go.
