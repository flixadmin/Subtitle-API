1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,460
I can have Norwegian friends and
be myself at the same time.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,860
Come on! Are you all deaf?!?

3
00:00:07,884 --> 00:00:09,884
- Now!
- Come on!

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,900
Out, out, out!

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:18,300
Two conditions: You pay for the
bus and I become the bus boss.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,140
Maybe we are better off
with someone else.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:28,460
If I think about him being with
someone else, then I'll just break.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,740
Why don't you believe in Allah?

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,160
Islam... or religion in general, just
creates a lot of anxiety in people.

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,280
Sana!

11
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,200
SATURDAY
09:58

12
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,000
-

13
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:08,248
-

14
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,180
- Where have you been tonight?
- I slept at Yousef's.

15
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:15,654
- Yousef?
- Yeah.

16
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,560
I saw Yousef with Sana outside last night.

17
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,600
Mom, I am 20 years old!
I can go out. Oh my God!

18
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:24,624
Don't "Oh my God" me. Hello?

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,580
My phone died.

20
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,820
Why didn't you tell us?
Why didn't you call?

21
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,420
I've just said my phone died!
I haven't done anything wrong!

22
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,660
Where were you last night?

23
00:02:36,384 --> 00:02:37,884
I don't understand you.

24
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,460
You don't need to understand,
this is very easy, Elias!

25
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,360
Tell me where you were last night!

26
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,340
- What do you want, mom?
- I want to know where have you been.

27
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,500
It's very simple.

28
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,380
As long as you live in this
house, you follow our rules.

29
00:02:55,404 --> 00:02:57,604
- Oh my God!
- No discussion.

30
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,500
And you know you have a
sister who is 17 years old!

31
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,700
You have to be a role model for her!

32
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,980
Why do you bring her into this?
She'll be 18 in a few months.

33
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,390
She can take care of herself now!

34
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:08,391
Yeah, but... listen!

35
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,800
I know she is mature enough but...

36
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,000
I am not thrilled about her and Yousef
spending so much time together.

37
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,840
- What's wrong with that?
- Is there something between them?

38
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,950
Don't ask me! You have
to ask her about that!

39
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,860
I see... Sana told me she met
Yousef outside by chance.

40
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,790
Yeah! If she said that
you have to trust her.

41
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,200
You have to stop being so skeptical
and start trusting your children.

42
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
Oh my God!

43
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,900
When Elias woke up, Eskild was sitting
there and started hitting on him.

44
00:03:49,924 --> 00:03:52,724
He was like: "Hi, are you
waking up with me?"

45
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,020
Elias didn't understand anything!

46
00:03:55,044 --> 00:04:00,319
He looked terrified and
threw up all over Eskild!

47
00:04:00,488 --> 00:04:03,328
Then he stopped hitting on him.

48
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,900
- Vilde!
- No.

49
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,500
Hi!

50
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,900
Hi.

51
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,500
- What's up?
- We are talking about last Friday's party.

52
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,840
You should have been there! It was so
fucking fun! So many handsome boys!

53
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,130
Yeah! Are you crazy? You
took them for yourself!

54
00:04:41,154 --> 00:04:44,354
There is something about those
west-side boys... They are like...

55
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,160
- That Alexander!
- Yeah. The tall one?

56
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:50,184
Yeah! He was something...

57
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,360
He was so cute with those curls!

58
00:04:52,884 --> 00:04:54,784
- Didn't you hook up with him?
- Huh?

59
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,122
You have to take the
chance once it's there!

60
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,210
You went around both, in the
front and in the back.

61
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:02,934
And not only in the bus,
to put it that way...

62
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,750
You really enjoyed yourself, at least!

63
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,540
- We texted you, though.
- Yeah. What were you doing on Friday?

64
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,060


65
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,940
Nothing, we just...

66
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,340
Nothing special. Chilling out.
We were tired.

67
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,900
- But you'll join the Karaoke on Friday?
- Yes, you must!

68
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,480
- It will be fucking fun!
- Karaoke?

69
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,020
Yes, you have to check out the event
Sara posted on our bus page.

70
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,940
There's a karaoke party. Lots of
people from school are coming.

71
00:05:42,964 --> 00:05:44,964
I think it will be fucking fun!

72
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,340
- We should invite those boys.
- Yeah! Then you could get to meet them.

73
00:05:50,364 --> 00:05:52,364
- Yes. Oh my God!
- It will be so fun!

74
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,340
The bus page?

75
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,720
Yeah! On Facebook.

76
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,660
Yes. It is actually our old bus
group, but I added you, didn't I?

77
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,260
I don't think so.

78
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,860
Didn't  I? Okay, sorry.
I'll do it right away.

79
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,300
It will be fun as fuck. Is Magnus coming?

80
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,940
Of course Magnus is coming.
If I come, he comes.

81
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,760
And in more that one way...

82
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,900
TUESDAY
10:01

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Karaoke party

84
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,900
- It will be great.
- Hope you have singing voices.

85
00:06:41,905 --> 00:06:44,105
Vilde: It will be super awesome!

86
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,480
Did you feel that Sara was trying to
hide something from us yesterday?

87
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,140
No... What's that?

88
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,500
I don't know, I just have a bad feeling.

89
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,760
If you think about it...

90
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,180
those girls can simply take the
whole bus and throw us away.

91
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,180
They are paying for it.

92
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,640
Yeah, but...

93
00:07:33,645 --> 00:07:40,945
Why would they bother joining forces with
us if they are going to throw us out?

94
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,120
Because they wanted that bus!

95
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,700
I don't think they are that psycho.

96
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,400
And didn't Sara say that she would
send me a copy of the contract?

97
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,460
Yeah... I don't know. Maybe?

98
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,280
- Yeah. She said it but she hasn't done it.
- No...

99
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:25,040
When did all this Russ stuff
become so important to you?

100
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,280
I have to ask her about that contract.

101
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,200
Sara! Can I talk to you?

102
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,960
I was just wondering what is
going on with the bus contract.

103
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What do you mean?

104
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,700
Weren't you supposed to send me a
copy of the contract proposal?

105
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,360
I did! Didn't I? I think I did!

106
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,580
I don't think you did.

107
00:09:04,604 --> 00:09:06,804
Maybe you forgot to do it?

108
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,480
Like when you "forgot" to add
me and Noora to the bus page?

109
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,490
No, I think I did.

110
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:20,684
Maybe I have the wrong e-mail address?

111
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,760
Or did it end in the spam filter?

112
00:09:23,044 --> 00:09:24,319
Spam filter?

113
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,480
Because Mari's copy did that.

114
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,160
Oh, yeah...

115
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,720
Here is it.

116
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,900
Good.

117
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,940
Mari sent me a message saying we have
to have a contract meeting on Monday,

118
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,940
and you have to come because
you are the boss, so...

119
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,340
Sana, I don't mean to
lead things so much.

120
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:06,384
I am just so used to be the bus boss...

121
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,740
Then stuff just happens.

122
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,660
I don't mean to override you, in any way.

123
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,120
No, it's all right.

124
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,460
But, did you see the Karaoke event?

125
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,900
Yeah.

126
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,020
- It would be cool if everybody came.
- Yeah! We are coming.

127
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,800
Cool! I feel like we have to
merge the buses a little more.

128
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,020
Get to know each other.

129
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,450
True.

130
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,150
THURSDAY
15:43

131
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,720
What are you doing?

132
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,520
Have you seen my green veil?

133
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,300
You are looking through my things!?

134
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:01,219
No.

135
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,520
Yes!

136
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,220
Why?

137
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,920
Because I don't know what
you're doing anymore.

138
00:11:09,944 --> 00:11:11,944
I am not doing anything!

139
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,020
You go out with all your friends and
suddenly I see you outside with Yousef.

140
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,000
You don't tell me anything. I
am worried, don't you see?

141
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,700
You talk about my friend as if
they were criminals or something!

142
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,940
It's not like all non-Muslims lie
or drink or have lots of sex!

143
00:11:33,564 --> 00:11:35,164
I know that, Sana.

144
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,660
Then why can't you trust that I
have friends who are good people?

145
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
I trust you, Sana.

146
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,280
But I know many young people don't
follow the same rules as you.

147
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,260
And you know Norwegian society has
lots of customs that don't suit us.

148
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,660
There are lots of things on
Islam that don't suit us!

149
00:11:54,684 --> 00:11:56,684
That don't suit me!

150
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,220
Like its view on homosexuality

151
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:05,900
and why Islam says that Muslim men
can marry non-religious women,

152
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:08,925
but Muslim women can't.

153
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,740
Isn't that a bit gender discriminatory?

154
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,764
At least in the society we live in?

155
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:20,740
When Islam says that the Quran should
adapt to any society you live in?

156
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,790
Where is all this coming from?

157
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,200
I am just asking!
Am I not allowed to?

158
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,120
Yes, you are allowed to ask.
You are allowed to ask.

159
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,720
And what? Don't you
have any answers?

160
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,130
I am just worried about you, Sana.

161
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,750
I don't want you to get hurt.

162
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,320
I won't get hurt!

163
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,340
Were you fighting with mom?

164
00:13:09,764 --> 00:13:10,814
Could you tell?

165
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,000
I heard it.

166
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,540
What did you do with
Yousef the other day?

167
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,080
With Yousef?

168
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,160
Yeah, mom told me she saw you together.

169
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,220
Oh, yeah.

170
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,240
He just walked me home from Noora's.

171
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,340
You like him?

172
00:13:57,664 --> 00:13:59,864
Huh? No!

173
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,400
Yousef is a nice guy.

174
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
It's just that he is not a Muslim.

175
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,820
Yousef is the most Muslim guy I know.

176
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,520
He doesn't drink, he is always
respectful to everyone.

177
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,620
Yes, but he doesn't believe in Allah.

178
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,200
"Doesn't believe in Allah..."

179
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,780
You know how many people I know
who say they believe in Allah?

180
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,080
But they still drink, steal or vandalize?

181
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,320
What's more important?

182
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:00,344
Saying that you believe in Allah?

183
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,020
Or living as if you believe in Allah?

184
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,260
The most important thing for me at
least, is that my sister...

185
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,510
is doing well,

186
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,240
with a good guy.

187
00:15:21,264 --> 00:15:24,064
Not with one who just
goes to the mosque.

188
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,670
I don't think that mom agrees with you.

189
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,360
Do you know that mom only
wants the best for us?

190
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:41,160
It's just she was born in a totally different
country in a totally different time.

191
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,920
She doesn't know what
is to be like us.

192
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,300
Now you have to stop
showing such a sad face.

193
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,520
Because when you are sad, I am sad too.

194
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,970
I am not sad.

195
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,760
That's good.

196
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,440
There is a party in Løkka tomorrow.

197
00:16:25,764 --> 00:16:27,164
If you want to come.

198
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,600
With your friends?

199
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,800
Those who were in the
apartment the other day?

200
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,800
Fun! Fun!

201
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,720
Yeah, yeah! Of course! We'll come!

202
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,560
- Bring Yousef!
- Yeah! I'll do that.

203
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,950
FRIDAY
20:39

204
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,260
- "So then, you are Elias, right?"
- Elias? Your brother?

205
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,840
Then I go up to him and I stroke
him, just a little bit on his side.

206
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,850
And then I feel a shiver
going through him, like...

207
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,580


208
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,760
He left pretty early but he...

209
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,360
He seemed open for...

210
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,200
- For more fun!
- Are you crazy?

211
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,700
I can send you the money with Vipps.

212
00:18:00,724 --> 00:18:02,324
- Vipps me?
- Yeah.

213
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:04,705
- How much?
- How much does it cost?

214
00:18:05,904 --> 00:18:06,604
Hello?

215
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,260
- 112.
- It's not!

216
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,560
- 112 Kronen for a beer.
- I can give you...

217
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,340
It's 112,40 or 112,50.

218
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,420
To Elias Bakkoush: 
ARE YOU COMING?

219
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,840
Imagine there's no heaven.

220
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,880
It's easy if you try.

221
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,840
No hell below us,

222
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:56,380
above us is only sky.

223
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:02,220
Imagine all the people

224
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:09,200
living for today.

225
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,520
Imagine there's no countries...

226
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,420
... nothing to kill or die for.

227
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,840
And no religion too.

228
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:40,260
Imagine all the people

229
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:47,860
living life in peace.

230
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:54,380
You may say I'm a dreamer,

231
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,020
but I'm not the only one.

232
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,780
I hope someday you'll join us,

233
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,200
and the world will be as one.

234
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:18,820
Imagine no possessions,

235
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,900
I wonder if you can.

236
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,160
No need for greed or hunger.

237
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:37,580
A brotherhood of man.

238
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:43,380
Imagine all the people

239
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:50,500
sharing all the world.

240
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:57,380
You may say I'm a dreamer,

241
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:03,260
but I'm not the only one.

242
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:10,060
I hope someday you'll join us.

243
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,700
And the world will live as one.

244
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,300
Thank you!

245
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,900
- Super!
- My God.

246
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,700
- Oh, I love you so much.
- I love you too.

247
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Do you remember the first time
I introduced you to the girls?

248
00:21:29,024 --> 00:21:30,299
Yeah!

249
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,660
It's so weird thinking about it!
It was so long time ago!

250
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:37,890
And you were standing there like:
"We met at Ramadan in the mosque".

251
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,960
- I remember.
- You were so...

252
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,280
Okay, we'll talk later. I'm going to meet
Eskild, I want to tell him something.

253
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,780


254
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,800
(Mama) SORRY FOR LOOKING
THROUGH YOUR STUFF.

255
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,020
YOU ARE SMART AND STRONG. YOU CAN
MANAGE WITHOUT MY DUMB ADVICE.

256
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,980
William has a new girlfriend.

257
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Did you know it?!

258
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,580
You knew it?!

259
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,440
- I was going to tell you, but...
- Did you know it last week?!

260
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,220
I sat there and I told you lots of
things about William and you knew it?

261
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,500
I am sorry, I should have told you.

262
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Sana, Elias is in trouble.

263
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,200
(Yelling obscenities to each other)

264
00:22:47,224 --> 00:22:49,224
What the fuck is wrong with you?

265
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,180
Elias! Elias stop!

266
00:22:53,204 --> 00:22:54,279
Leave!

267
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,220
Elias, leave!

268
00:22:56,244 --> 00:22:57,744
Elias stop!

269
00:22:57,768 --> 00:22:59,419
Elias! What are you doing?!

270
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,920
Fucking kids!

271
00:23:00,924 --> 00:23:02,924
Elias!

272
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,940
Are you all right?

273
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,560
We have to go to the emergency room.

274
00:23:27,284 --> 00:23:28,184
Let's go then!

275
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,760
- Are you coming?
- Yes, of course.

276
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:27,380
- What has just happened? Really scary.
- Why did they do that? I don't get it.

277
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,220
- It is probably because they are gay.
- No! Do you think so?

278
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,860
Yes, they are Muslims and
the other guys are gay.

279
00:24:33,865 --> 00:24:35,465
That's a reason to fight.

280
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,834
It's insane if it's the case. I think
her brother is a little crazy.

281
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,460
Do you remember that bus
meeting at Sana's place?

282
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,420
Her brother totally snapped!
He screamed and...

283
00:24:46,425 --> 00:24:48,445
- Do you know what Vilde said?
- No.

284
00:24:48,464 --> 00:24:50,439
That he called Sana "slave".

285
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,340
Seriously? That's sick. No
wonder why she is psycho.

286
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,380
No, I don't want to be there when...

287
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,280
Could you just check that
there's nobody in those stalls?

288
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,280
Nobody. What were you saying?

289
00:25:09,204 --> 00:25:14,204
I don't want to be there when Sana finds
out she is not going to be on the bus.

290
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,180
- Did they sign the contract?
- Yes, earlier today.

291
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,220
Sara was really paranoid because Sana was
starting to suspect anything, right?

292
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,500
But fortunately she managed
to get away with it.

293
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,420
I feel sorry for her.

294
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:33,114
But, hello? She is really stupid
if she doesn't get we own the bus

295
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,660
cause we are paying for it and
she doesn't have any rights.

296
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,020
Do you know she wasn't the real bus boss?
It was Vilde!

297
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,340
I don't get why she bothered joining
the bus in the first place.

298
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,180
Isn't that really disrespectful
to her religion?

299
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,420
Specially if she wears a hijab.

300
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:51,430
She is supposed to be a good
representation for Islam.

301
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,460
- The other girls seems cool though!
- I agree.

302
00:25:54,484 --> 00:25:56,484
Specially Noora!

303
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,760
Oh my God! She is so pretty.

304
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:55,400
