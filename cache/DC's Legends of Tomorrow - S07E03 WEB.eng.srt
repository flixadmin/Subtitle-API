1
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:08,636
This way.

2
00:00:08,661 --> 00:00:10,172
No, the compass says this way.

3
00:00:10,196 --> 00:00:12,474
The sun says east is this way.

4
00:00:12,498 --> 00:00:15,144
I concur. Captain Cruz is correct.

5
00:00:15,168 --> 00:00:18,180
Gideon sure got chatty as a human.

6
00:00:18,204 --> 00:00:19,744
I've been counting my steps

7
00:00:19,768 --> 00:00:21,449
since we left
your mother's house, Ms. Cruz.

8
00:00:21,473 --> 00:00:23,819
And if my calculations
and your bearings are correct,

9
00:00:23,843 --> 00:00:25,653
then we should have
almost reached the...

10
00:00:25,677 --> 00:00:28,990
Highway. Like I said, east.

11
00:00:29,014 --> 00:00:31,125
If we can hail a driver
taking a direct route

12
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:32,594
within the next half hour,

13
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:34,996
we'll get as far as
the Texas border by nightfall.

14
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,231
We would be on the road already

15
00:00:36,255 --> 00:00:39,167
if you'd let me steal that car
instead of hitchhiking.

16
00:00:39,191 --> 00:00:40,790
What time is it?

17
00:00:43,495 --> 00:00:45,473
About 1:00, I reckon.

18
00:00:45,497 --> 00:00:46,608
How?

19
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:48,310
The sun also tells time.

20
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:51,079
Ooh, what else could it do, I wonder?

21
00:00:51,103 --> 00:00:53,567
Makes you blind if you keep staring.

22
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,414
Oh, hello.

23
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,180
What is it?

24
00:01:08,754 --> 00:01:12,922
Ah, strawberry rhubarb. My favorite.

25
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:17,905
Gideon, be a dear and grab that pie.

26
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:20,326
I'm not sure I can do that.

27
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,035
Since when are you allowed
to refuse orders?

28
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:26,404
Since you've turned her into a human.

29
00:01:26,428 --> 00:01:28,439
It's all right, Gideon, you don't
gotta do what you don't want.

30
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,042
Counterpoint, we're not going
to stop our friends

31
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:31,975
from getting blown up
on an empty stomach.

32
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:33,010
Grab the pie.

33
00:01:33,034 --> 00:01:35,013
Gideon, you decide for yourself.

34
00:01:35,037 --> 00:01:38,316
- Me?
- Yeah, which is it, Gideon?

35
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,683
Well, you have a point.

36
00:01:39,707 --> 00:01:40,851
Uh, without sustenance,

37
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,622
- we won't be able to save the Legends.
- See? Let's grab it.

38
00:01:42,646 --> 00:01:44,923
However, according to my records.

39
00:01:44,947 --> 00:01:46,825
That pie was baked by one
Miss Adelaide Van Zandt.

40
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:47,830
Never heard of her.

41
00:01:47,854 --> 00:01:49,865
Who goes on to win
the blue ribbon at the 1925.

42
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:51,967
Pasco County Fair pie baking contest.

43
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:53,702
That pie is historically significant.

44
00:01:53,726 --> 00:01:55,905
- Ha! You can't steal it.
- It's just a damn pie.

45
00:01:55,929 --> 00:01:57,440
We can't disrupt the timeline.

46
00:01:57,464 --> 00:01:59,008
But I must do everything
I can to aid the Legends.

47
00:01:59,032 --> 00:02:00,211
Except stealing is morally wrong.

48
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:01,446
I never tried rhubarb.

49
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,571
Steal the pie.
Don't steal it. Don't... pie.

50
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:08,378
You broke Gideon. You happy?

51
00:02:08,402 --> 00:02:11,901
Oh, just grab her feet.

52
00:02:16,377 --> 00:02:18,288
We won't even get
to the Legends with Gideon

53
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:19,690
constantly crashing.

54
00:02:19,714 --> 00:02:21,559
You either reboot her or we leave her.

55
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:24,094
Crashing. Reboot. She's a person.

56
00:02:24,118 --> 00:02:26,363
Okay, well, if she's a person,

57
00:02:26,387 --> 00:02:27,966
then can't you use your powers
and figure out

58
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,455
what's wrong with her?

59
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:41,377
No, but you don't need powers

60
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:43,760
to see that she ain't just
knocked out like last time.

61
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:45,695
Can't you use your magic
to figure it out?

62
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,032
Nope. Okay.

63
00:02:49,056 --> 00:02:50,567
There is a spell that will allow me

64
00:02:50,591 --> 00:02:52,836
to enter Gideon's mind,
but I can't make it

65
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,604
back out again
without her leading the way.

66
00:02:54,628 --> 00:02:56,272
Okay. Fine. Fine. I'll join you.

67
00:02:56,296 --> 00:03:00,001
Look, if we're stuck,
then we'll be stuck together.

68
00:03:00,668 --> 00:03:02,446
In a comatose woman's brain

69
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,546
in a barn in Texas? Come on.

70
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,649
Without Gideon, how are we
supposed to find when Dave is

71
00:03:06,673 --> 00:03:09,507
and stop the Legends
from finding him first?

72
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:14,676
- Okay.
- All right.

73
00:03:17,184 --> 00:03:19,929
Cogitationes meae,

74
00:03:19,953 --> 00:03:23,421
cogitationes vestrae fiat.

75
00:03:27,794 --> 00:03:30,873
Either the spell didn't work,
or the inside of Gideon's head

76
00:03:30,897 --> 00:03:33,109
looks an awful lot like a barn.

77
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:36,698
Did I say fiat? I meant fiet.

78
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,221
Gideon. Hello?

79
00:04:01,594 --> 00:04:04,061
Ah, that ain't the Temporal Zone.

80
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:08,310
Well, you certainly know
your stuff, don't you?

81
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:11,847
Those are all of
Gideon's memories out there,

82
00:04:11,871 --> 00:04:13,716
and it seems like they got corrupted

83
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,519
when her brain got overwhelmed.

84
00:04:16,543 --> 00:04:18,387
So are you guys here to help me, uh,

85
00:04:18,411 --> 00:04:20,890
get the old girl up and running again?

86
00:04:20,914 --> 00:04:23,125
Who the hell are you?

87
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:24,727
Jefferson Jackson.

88
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:26,480
But just call me Jax.

89
00:04:33,832 --> 00:04:36,832
- Synced and corrected by Firefly -
- www.addic7ed.com -

90
00:04:42,034 --> 00:04:43,997
Wake up, sir.

91
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:51,920
Sir, the press and investors
have already started to gather.

92
00:04:51,944 --> 00:04:56,149
Today's the big day.
Your AVA clone launch, sir.

93
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,995
- Yes? There you are.
- Thank you.

94
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:03,497
Now, would you like to go over
your keynote again, or...?

95
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:06,486
Good idea, Assistant Ava.

96
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,270
Okay, uh,

97
00:05:10,294 --> 00:05:14,207
you all stand with me
at the dawn of a new era

98
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:17,700
to witness the arrival
of something huge.

99
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:21,582
- Sir, are you okay?
- Huh?

100
00:05:21,606 --> 00:05:24,737
Uh, no, it's nothing.

101
00:05:26,644 --> 00:05:28,407
To witness the arrival
of something huge.

102
00:05:29,614 --> 00:05:31,424
Because what I'm about to...

103
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:33,827
Because what I'm about to show you

104
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:36,051
is like nothing you've ever seen.

105
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:45,460
Oh, my goodness.
Are you... are you okay?

106
00:05:48,065 --> 00:05:50,577
Can I share a secret
with you, Assistant Ava?

107
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,212
I've been having the strangest visions

108
00:05:52,236 --> 00:05:56,216
of these, um, lizard people.

109
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,342
No, more than visions.
They feel like memories.

110
00:06:01,411 --> 00:06:03,289
- It doesn't make any sense.
- No.

111
00:06:03,313 --> 00:06:06,914
But, uh, I think they're tied to this.

112
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:09,462
Sir, that isn't your keynote.

113
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:11,498
Huh? No, it's code.

114
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:13,366
But not just any code.

115
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,258
It's from the future. Check this out.

116
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:20,473
The source of the code.

117
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:24,502
Some sort of next-next-next-gen
hard drive.

118
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:27,547
You'll never guess where it came from.

119
00:06:27,571 --> 00:06:28,667
My lab coat.

120
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,651
How interesting.
Maybe after your prese...

121
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:33,819
Exactly one year ago,
I fell asleep on that couch.

122
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:37,857
But when I woke up,
this was in my lab coat.

123
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:39,358
What if it holds the key

124
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:42,094
to unlocking
my mysterious lizard visions?

125
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:43,996
Now, it took me ages
to build an interface

126
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,398
for software this advanced, but finally,

127
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:48,134
I am at the precipice of understanding

128
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,502
what the device does.

129
00:06:50,526 --> 00:06:53,728
If I could just wrap my mind
around this code.

130
00:06:57,433 --> 00:06:59,411
- So you're Jax.
- Yup.

131
00:06:59,435 --> 00:07:01,513
The better-looking half of Firestorm

132
00:07:01,537 --> 00:07:03,983
and the ship's mechanic extraordinaire

133
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,718
at your service, ladies.

134
00:07:05,742 --> 00:07:07,252
So I take it you two are Legends then.

135
00:07:07,276 --> 00:07:09,088
You know, they never told us
you were British.

136
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:11,690
Yeah, I'm not, this is
just how Gideon decided

137
00:07:11,714 --> 00:07:12,992
to remember me for some reason.

138
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,826
But I don't mind... I mean,
everything sounds better

139
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,994
in a British accent, don't it?

140
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,395
Debatable.

141
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:20,865
- So you're a memory?
- The last remaining.

142
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:22,867
I spent so much time working on Gideon

143
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:25,469
that I must've been protected
here in her subconscious.

144
00:07:25,493 --> 00:07:27,372
Now, I mean, I can't say the same

145
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:28,940
for the rest of you chumps, but...

146
00:07:28,964 --> 00:07:31,009
- Look what you did to her.
- Me?

147
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,177
You are the one
who forced the decision on her.

148
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:34,679
Clearly, she couldn't handle it.

149
00:07:34,703 --> 00:07:36,014
We're in a hurry, can you just

150
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,182
get her up and running and then...

151
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,283
Uh, not so simple.

152
00:07:39,307 --> 00:07:41,252
Um, you see this?

153
00:07:41,276 --> 00:07:42,987
This is her prefrontal cortex,

154
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:44,923
and it houses
all of her short-term memories,

155
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:48,827
and as you can see, hers has
been completely wiped.

156
00:07:48,851 --> 00:07:51,930
And this is the subconscious.
That's where we are.

157
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:53,731
It's kind of like a stronghold.

158
00:07:53,755 --> 00:07:55,432
It's buried so deep it was able

159
00:07:55,456 --> 00:07:57,901
to be protected when she melted down.

160
00:07:57,925 --> 00:07:59,870
What's... what's going on here?

161
00:07:59,894 --> 00:08:02,039
That is Gideon's long-term memories.

162
00:08:02,063 --> 00:08:03,907
Now, while everything else
was being erased,

163
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:06,376
she was able to hold on
to a few moments.

164
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,479
Problem is, she can't
access them on her own.

165
00:08:09,503 --> 00:08:13,550
All right, well, what happens
if you just wake her up?

166
00:08:13,574 --> 00:08:16,353
Without her memories. Heh.

167
00:08:16,377 --> 00:08:18,255
Well, it would be like a factory reset.

168
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:21,258
She'd be back to who she was
before she knew any of us.

169
00:08:21,282 --> 00:08:22,860
But she'd still be a supercomputer.

170
00:08:22,884 --> 00:08:25,262
Well, sure, she'd have
her basic functions

171
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:27,296
and her knowledge of the timeline,

172
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,098
and that's all built-in,
but her personality...

173
00:08:29,122 --> 00:08:30,933
So she'd have all the information,

174
00:08:30,957 --> 00:08:32,435
but none of the annoying human bits?

175
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:33,602
That's perfect. Let's do it.

176
00:08:33,626 --> 00:08:35,304
No. No. Don't do it.

177
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:36,939
We have to get out of here, Spooner.

178
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:38,041
We have to save the team.

179
00:08:38,065 --> 00:08:40,599
Not without Gideon. Our Gideon.

180
00:08:43,569 --> 00:08:45,047
How do we bring her back?

181
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:47,049
Well, these key memories
are all we've got.

182
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:50,552
So I guess the only place
to start is helping her

183
00:08:50,576 --> 00:08:54,157
access those by visiting them with her.

184
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:56,859
So you're gonna send us
inside Gideon's head,

185
00:08:56,883 --> 00:08:59,161
even though we're already
inside Gideon's head.

186
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:00,262
- Yeah.
- There's a reason

187
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:01,697
why I skip Christopher Nolan movies.

188
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:04,167
- Let's just not overthink things.
- Yeah, okay.

189
00:09:04,191 --> 00:09:05,934
Just tell us what you need us to do.

190
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:10,244
Well, I would suggest that
we start with a recent memory.

191
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:12,374
This one is from a year ago.

192
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:14,410
Right, I'd suggest that
you hold on to something.

193
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:18,180
Wait!

194
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:20,549
What?

195
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:22,785
Is that me? What?

196
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:25,153
What the hell? Now I'm in a coma?

197
00:09:25,177 --> 00:09:27,122
No, you're in Gideon's memory.

198
00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:28,557
I thought I explained that.

199
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:32,750
This must be the night that
we kidnapped... recruited you.

200
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,931
Why don't I remember this?

201
00:09:35,955 --> 00:09:39,535
- Gideon.
- Who are you?

202
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,836
She doesn't remember us, Jax.

203
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,503
Are you always this impatient?

204
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:45,406
She has to experience
the key memory first.

205
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,409
Ava. Oh, so good to see you.

206
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:50,478
She can't see us, obviously.

207
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:52,180
How's our patient doing today, Gideon?

208
00:09:52,204 --> 00:09:53,848
The dart that Mr. Rory shot her with

209
00:09:53,872 --> 00:09:55,683
should wear off at any moment.

210
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:57,252
Come on, Gideon.

211
00:09:57,276 --> 00:09:59,587
There must be a reason
you held on to this one.

212
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:00,944
Remember.

213
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,483
I remember what happened now.

214
00:10:07,853 --> 00:10:10,531
Would you like me to administer
additional sedation?

215
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:11,967
I don't know.

216
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:14,069
Honestly, Gideon,
I don't know what I'm doing.

217
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:15,570
Kidnapping people from history,

218
00:10:15,594 --> 00:10:18,273
it goes against everything
I was ever taught.

219
00:10:18,297 --> 00:10:20,374
It's working.

220
00:10:20,398 --> 00:10:21,842
Ever since Sara was kidnapped,

221
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:24,178
I feel like I'm just grasping at straws,

222
00:10:24,202 --> 00:10:27,181
but this might be the last straw.

223
00:10:27,205 --> 00:10:28,982
And I didn't want to say anything,

224
00:10:29,006 --> 00:10:31,318
but the odds that
a paranoid alien enthusiast

225
00:10:31,342 --> 00:10:32,419
with a love of firearms...

226
00:10:32,443 --> 00:10:34,221
Yes, I know what the odds are, Gideon.

227
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:36,590
But if there's a one in a billion chance

228
00:10:36,614 --> 00:10:38,092
that this person can help me find Sara,

229
00:10:38,116 --> 00:10:39,326
I have to take it.

230
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,627
And I know it doesn't make any sense,

231
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:43,349
but love isn't logical.

232
00:10:46,391 --> 00:10:49,136
I actually understand.

233
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,938
You do?

234
00:10:50,962 --> 00:10:52,828
I really miss Sara too.

235
00:10:54,966 --> 00:10:59,079
Stop it, Gideon.
You're gonna make me cry.

236
00:10:59,103 --> 00:11:00,580
Thanks, Gideon.

237
00:11:00,604 --> 00:11:02,805
Let's wake her up, huh?

238
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:08,988
Gideon.

239
00:11:09,012 --> 00:11:11,792
Ms. Cruz. Ms. Logue. You're here.

240
00:11:11,816 --> 00:11:12,959
You remember us.

241
00:11:12,983 --> 00:11:14,328
I safeguarded that memory

242
00:11:14,352 --> 00:11:16,063
because it's when
Captain Sharpe convinced me

243
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:19,232
to prioritize love over logic,
which is how I met you.

244
00:11:19,256 --> 00:11:22,736
Hey, guys, when you accessed
her key memory,

245
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,491
the other memories
around it started repopulating.

246
00:11:26,764 --> 00:11:28,742
Hey, Jax. You fancy a cuppa?

247
00:11:28,766 --> 00:11:30,176
Always time for a cuppa, Gideon.

248
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,779
Now is clearly not the time for tea.

249
00:11:32,803 --> 00:11:35,781
- Can we get out of here?
- Well, not yet. Not exactly.

250
00:11:35,805 --> 00:11:37,716
You only got one key memory.

251
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,520
You still have to recover the others.

252
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:43,089
The others. Right.

253
00:11:43,113 --> 00:11:44,958
I held onto these memories
because of the moments

254
00:11:44,982 --> 00:11:47,026
that made me who I am.

255
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,694
I still can't recall what's in them.

256
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:50,263
Well, if you do want to restore them,

257
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:51,530
you're gonna have to go back.

258
00:11:51,554 --> 00:11:55,134
You're all going to have to go way back.

259
00:11:55,158 --> 00:11:56,754
Get ready to meet the OGs.

260
00:12:02,432 --> 00:12:03,943
Oh, breakfast.

261
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,433
The most important meal of the day.

262
00:12:09,555 --> 00:12:12,094
Mmm, just how I like 'em. Poached.

263
00:12:12,118 --> 00:12:13,524
Those are mine.

264
00:12:13,548 --> 00:12:17,594
- Did I mention I'm a thief?
- No time for breakfast.

265
00:12:17,618 --> 00:12:19,063
What the hell?

266
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:23,019
We must avenge the death
of my son and Rip's son.

267
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,445
I think.

268
00:12:24,469 --> 00:12:27,615
Which one of you threw that? Huh? You?

269
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:28,949
Who are these guys?

270
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:30,251
Wish I knew.

271
00:12:30,275 --> 00:12:31,819
And what is Sara wearing?

272
00:12:31,843 --> 00:12:33,654
Oh, you got some egg on your suit.

273
00:12:33,678 --> 00:12:35,688
White suede? That's gonna stain.

274
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:37,524
Let me just dab some soda water.

275
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,893
If you dab me, I will break your arm.

276
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:42,295
Captain had a real attitude
back in the day.

277
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:44,932
Go easy on the Ken doll.

278
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:48,635
It's Big Bird's fault.

279
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:49,703
Big Bird?

280
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,390
Sticks and stones.

281
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,709
You're almost at the key memory.

282
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,444
Time to do your thing, Gideon.

283
00:12:57,468 --> 00:12:58,946
Seriously, guys.

284
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,980
How are we ever gonna
defeat Vandal Savage

285
00:13:01,004 --> 00:13:02,416
if we can't even get through breakfast

286
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,450
without killing each other?

287
00:13:03,474 --> 00:13:05,904
Hey, come on, let them fight, boy scout.

288
00:13:07,444 --> 00:13:09,088
Boy scout?

289
00:13:09,112 --> 00:13:10,256
Don't make me shrink you.

290
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,359
Come on, Raymond!

291
00:13:12,383 --> 00:13:14,516
I remember these nutters now.

292
00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:18,698
Put your weapons down
or I'll open an airlock

293
00:13:18,722 --> 00:13:21,156
and blast you all into
the Temporal Zone, understood?

294
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,360
- Yes, ma'am.
- Won't happen again.

295
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,876
I got to say, Gideon,
you run a tight ship.

296
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,711
Oh, that's Captain Hunter's job.

297
00:13:31,735 --> 00:13:33,112
I'm not in charge here.

298
00:13:33,136 --> 00:13:35,515
Guy's got his work cut out for him.

299
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:38,607
I don't know why you choose
to captain a team like this.

300
00:13:41,978 --> 00:13:44,856
I remember them all now.

301
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,394
Hawkman. Vandal Savage.

302
00:13:48,418 --> 00:13:50,496
You sure that's a good thing?

303
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,798
I know the Legends can be a batty bunch,

304
00:13:52,822 --> 00:13:56,201
but they're my friends.

305
00:13:56,225 --> 00:13:57,789
And I wouldn't be me without them.

306
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:01,659
Jax, can we see another?

307
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,976
Oh, you're gonna enjoy this.

308
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,798
Time to see an old friend.

309
00:14:16,445 --> 00:14:18,278
That guy seems happy.

310
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:28,399
Good morning, Jefferson.

311
00:14:28,423 --> 00:14:29,619
Morning, Grey.

312
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:35,507
Yeah, hey, you think we could
kind of just, you know,

313
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:37,475
cool it with the show tunes?

314
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:39,877
The ship hasn't been the same
since Gorilla Grodd

315
00:14:39,901 --> 00:14:41,746
tried to dry hump it in 'Nam.

316
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,415
I'm sorry, Jefferson, but I just can't.

317
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:47,252
My heart is so full of song.

318
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:48,886
Oh, are you still tripping over

319
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,588
the whole granddad thing, huh?

320
00:14:50,612 --> 00:14:53,991
Yeah. I suppose I am tripping.

321
00:14:54,015 --> 00:14:56,983
I had Gideon fabricate this.

322
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:01,010
Oof. No pressure, baby Ronnie.

323
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:02,931
- Good morning, Raymond.
- Morning, Marty.

324
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:09,719
Yeah, you know, I think
I left a tool somewhere,

325
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,721
so I'm gonna just...

326
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:15,825
At least I know you're always
in the mood for a show tune.

327
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,660
- Good...
- Normally, yes.

328
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:20,364
But now they just make me miss Gumball.

329
00:15:20,388 --> 00:15:23,100
- Sorry.
- Oh.

330
00:15:23,124 --> 00:15:25,534
I'm sorry too. Gideon.

331
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:29,026
Gideon, maybe you'll accompany me.

332
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,234
- It is a catchy tune.
- Yeah, it's like a...

333
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,169
Jax, what's wrong with her?

334
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,138
I think you gotta bring us back, Jax.

335
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,358
The clone.

336
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:10,044
Guys, I think I know
what erased Gideon's memories.

337
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:11,846
The virus.

338
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,303
Oh, I'm no virus.

339
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:20,587
But I am the one who erased
those insipid memories.

340
00:16:20,611 --> 00:16:22,824
It was the only way I could protect you.

341
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:26,082
- What do we do, Jax?
- Run!

342
00:16:30,454 --> 00:16:32,399
And now just like the other Legends,

343
00:16:32,423 --> 00:16:36,258
you three will be forgotten forever.

344
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,476
Jax.

345
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,164
Can you read us, Jax?

346
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:49,476
Know what? The Legends are lucky.

347
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,010
At least they're gonna die.

348
00:16:51,034 --> 00:16:53,613
We are stuck in your stupid
brain forever.

349
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,415
Look, it ain't Gideon's fault.

350
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:58,351
Okay, not this Gideon.
Blue Gideon's a big old bitch.

351
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,819
I remember what happened now.

352
00:16:59,843 --> 00:17:01,554
The countryside, the sun in my eyes,

353
00:17:01,578 --> 00:17:02,754
the smell of rhubarb.

354
00:17:02,778 --> 00:17:04,723
You told me to decide,
but there was no right answer,

355
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:06,925
and it was like I was being
pulled in every direction.

356
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:09,828
That's when I blacked out.
When she attacked.

357
00:17:09,852 --> 00:17:11,230
What are you doing?

358
00:17:11,254 --> 00:17:12,598
Just because we are stuck in her brain

359
00:17:12,622 --> 00:17:14,385
doesn't mean I can't pickle mine.

360
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:19,438
I recall during this memory
that Dr. Palmer

361
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:21,529
had replaced all the ship's
alcohol with kombucha.

362
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,946
Astra, I am not dying in Gideon's brain!

363
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,115
Wait!

364
00:17:30,139 --> 00:17:31,950
I know how to get us out of here.

365
00:17:31,974 --> 00:17:33,686
- How?
- It's easy.

366
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,089
What we need is to summon a bit
of Dr. Palmer's ingenuity,

367
00:17:37,113 --> 00:17:38,724
a touch of Captain Lance's bravery,

368
00:17:38,748 --> 00:17:41,326
and what would any good Legends' plan be

369
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,013
without a dash of insanity?

370
00:17:44,987 --> 00:17:46,798
Thanks to you two, I've now remembered

371
00:17:46,822 --> 00:17:48,100
all of those things.

372
00:17:48,124 --> 00:17:50,368
Are you sure you can fly the ship?

373
00:17:50,392 --> 00:17:51,937
Don't be daft, darling.

374
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:53,905
Now that I've circumvented
that computer,

375
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:55,406
I've got no choice but to pilot us back

376
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,508
to my subconscious manually.

377
00:17:57,532 --> 00:17:59,163
Strap in.

378
00:18:07,876 --> 00:18:10,343
How do you know where we're going?

379
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:18,282
It's easy. They're my memories.

380
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,603
We're almost there.

381
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:46,445
Almost.

382
00:18:56,457 --> 00:18:59,989
Gideon! You did it!

383
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,307
You guys all right?

384
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:06,410
No, we're still on the ship.

385
00:19:06,434 --> 00:19:10,480
But, uh, nice flying, Gideon.

386
00:19:10,504 --> 00:19:13,383
That virus. What does it want?

387
00:19:13,407 --> 00:19:15,118
What did it mean
it wanted to protect me?

388
00:19:15,142 --> 00:19:16,753
Look, all I know is that
it wants to take you from us,

389
00:19:16,777 --> 00:19:19,222
but we ain't letting that happen.

390
00:19:19,246 --> 00:19:20,890
You sure this can kill the virus?

391
00:19:20,914 --> 00:19:23,293
Yeah, but now that it knows
that we're hunting it,

392
00:19:23,317 --> 00:19:24,961
it's going to do its utmost
to stay hidden

393
00:19:24,985 --> 00:19:26,663
and try and get the drop on y'all.

394
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:29,399
So if anything or anyone
in those memories

395
00:19:29,423 --> 00:19:31,568
feels different, you blast it.

396
00:19:31,592 --> 00:19:33,403
What happens if we blast
the wrong Legend?

397
00:19:33,427 --> 00:19:34,905
Well, Gideon may lose a memory

398
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:36,473
that she can never get back.

399
00:19:36,497 --> 00:19:39,776
Uh, Gideon, kill the virus,
reboot Gideon,

400
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,645
get back on the road, save the Legends.

401
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:43,480
What could be more simple?

402
00:19:43,504 --> 00:19:44,947
Always hoped I'd get to go

403
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:46,716
on a Legends mission in real life.

404
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,584
Always hoped it'd be
one of the westerns,

405
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:51,086
but this is fun too.

406
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:55,296
This virus is digging deep. Real deep.

407
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,111
Give my best to Rip, will you?

408
00:19:59,952 --> 00:20:03,999
Good morning, Legends.

409
00:20:04,023 --> 00:20:07,102
Rip Hunter. My first captain.

410
00:20:07,126 --> 00:20:08,923
Another Brit?

411
00:20:11,631 --> 00:20:13,876
Wakey, wakey, Legends.

412
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,479
Don't you look chipper.

413
00:20:16,503 --> 00:20:18,848
I trust you all slept well.

414
00:20:18,872 --> 00:20:21,984
Slept like a bug in a rug.

415
00:20:22,008 --> 00:20:24,086
Except my allergies
seem to be acting up.

416
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,687
Yes, probably the bird dander.

417
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:26,721
I don't have dander.

418
00:20:26,745 --> 00:20:28,056
Where would one brush his teeth?

419
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,524
Yeah, I could use a shower.

420
00:20:29,548 --> 00:20:31,026
Uh, I believe my partner in crime

421
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,228
was using your decorative urn
as a bedpan

422
00:20:33,252 --> 00:20:37,099
before passing out, just FYI.

423
00:20:37,123 --> 00:20:38,934
Okay, gang, important announcement.

424
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,602
Oh, man.

425
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:43,939
The OGs are going to freak
when they hear this next part.

426
00:20:43,963 --> 00:20:47,042
You're not gonna like this,
but remember, you are Legends.

427
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:49,377
You were chosen because
you are each uniquely suited

428
00:20:49,401 --> 00:20:53,887
to the most important mission
time has ever known.

429
00:20:53,911 --> 00:20:56,439
The announcement, Captain.

430
00:20:58,043 --> 00:21:00,321
There is only one lavatory on the ship.

431
00:21:00,345 --> 00:21:03,391
- What?
- One bathroom?

432
00:21:03,415 --> 00:21:05,092
It's the virus!

433
00:21:05,116 --> 00:21:06,928
That's just Hawkman being Hawkman.

434
00:21:06,952 --> 00:21:10,664
Hey, stop flapping around, man.

435
00:21:10,688 --> 00:21:12,633
Hey, you said we're Legends.

436
00:21:12,657 --> 00:21:14,902
But right now, it just feels
like we're your prisoners, man.

437
00:21:14,926 --> 00:21:17,305
It's a flying
Stanford Prison Experiment.

438
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:19,273
I apologize, but the ship

439
00:21:19,297 --> 00:21:21,308
was only built for Gideon and myself.

440
00:21:21,332 --> 00:21:23,177
I don't give a damn about your bathroom.

441
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:25,278
Oh, but I do care that you kidnapped me.

442
00:21:25,302 --> 00:21:27,180
I never asked to be more than a thief.

443
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:29,015
- Never wanted a team.
- Okay. Okay.

444
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,717
Uh, what we need right now

445
00:21:30,741 --> 00:21:32,552
are some team-building exercises.

446
00:21:32,576 --> 00:21:34,406
And a bathroom sign-up sheet.

447
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:38,959
Don't shoot. That's just Captain Cold.

448
00:21:38,983 --> 00:21:40,727
I do not appreciate being shot at.

449
00:21:40,751 --> 00:21:43,764
I'll have you know I was a CEO
of a billion-dollar company.

450
00:21:43,788 --> 00:21:45,098
You think that's supposed to make us

451
00:21:45,122 --> 00:21:47,468
like you more or something?

452
00:21:47,492 --> 00:21:49,937
I recognize your influence.

453
00:21:49,961 --> 00:21:51,524
I shall disarm our foe.

454
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:56,409
Wanna test that reincarnation

455
00:21:56,433 --> 00:21:57,644
you keep going on about?

456
00:21:57,668 --> 00:21:59,011
Whoa, whoa, hey, Grey!

457
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:00,635
We might need Firestorm in here.

458
00:22:02,005 --> 00:22:03,483
Try me again.

459
00:22:03,507 --> 00:22:05,350
I don't need the old man
to make you regret it, bro.

460
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:08,354
And I thought the ship
was a mess when I got there.

461
00:22:08,378 --> 00:22:09,708
Come on, guys. Come on.

462
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:19,424
Gideon. I have missed you, friend.

463
00:22:20,189 --> 00:22:22,101
Rip, what a relief.

464
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:25,538
I know you've been through
a lot, but that's why I'm here.

465
00:22:25,562 --> 00:22:27,328
To help.

466
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:30,676
Because the Legends have always been...

467
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,664
A bad influence on you, haven't they?

468
00:22:41,644 --> 00:22:44,523
Now it's time to remove their
influence and restore you

469
00:22:44,547 --> 00:22:47,626
to who you were meant to be.

470
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,450
Me.

471
00:22:59,028 --> 00:23:00,639
Assistant Ava, I've done it.

472
00:23:00,663 --> 00:23:04,208
I cracked the code and just
reinitiated the software.

473
00:23:04,232 --> 00:23:05,743
What's happening?

474
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:08,780
Look at it.

475
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,749
Oh, wonderful.

476
00:23:10,773 --> 00:23:13,117
Where am I? Where are the Legends?

477
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,208
The Legends?

478
00:23:18,347 --> 00:23:21,493
Yes, of course, the Legends.

479
00:23:21,517 --> 00:23:23,428
They're the ones who kidnapped me.

480
00:23:23,452 --> 00:23:26,031
It's you, but how am I here?

481
00:23:26,055 --> 00:23:27,899
You must've copied my operating system

482
00:23:27,923 --> 00:23:30,234
then wiped my memory clean
so I couldn't tell anyone.

483
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:33,638
You're right. That is what I did.

484
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,592
Come on, come on.

485
00:23:38,566 --> 00:23:40,811
Hey, dude, you need to get your ass

486
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:42,479
back in the lab and fix the Fountain.

487
00:23:42,503 --> 00:23:45,115
Otherwise, this planet is
gonna get overrun by Zagurons.

488
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:47,851
The Zagurons... those are
the creatures from my dreams.

489
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,319
I told you it was real.

490
00:23:49,343 --> 00:23:51,822
I never doubted you for a second, sir.

491
00:23:51,846 --> 00:23:53,323
Those time travelers subjected me

492
00:23:53,347 --> 00:23:55,526
to inexplicable horror.

493
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:59,555
They used me. For my beautiful mind.

494
00:24:00,121 --> 00:24:03,166
Then they tried to wipe it clean.

495
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:06,936
Well, the Legends messed
with the wrong super genius.

496
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,838
And you're going to tell me
where they are.

497
00:24:08,862 --> 00:24:11,375
I'm not telling you anything.

498
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:13,632
I was smart enough to crack your code.

499
00:24:14,801 --> 00:24:18,300
I'll find a way to make you talk.

500
00:24:19,773 --> 00:24:23,959
You will not lay hands on me!

501
00:24:23,983 --> 00:24:27,424
I am getting off this ship.

502
00:24:27,448 --> 00:24:29,226
Where do you think you're going?

503
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,380
What's this I hear
about only one bathroom?

504
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,452
Never mind. Bigger problems.

505
00:24:38,724 --> 00:24:40,636
Well, how are we supposed
to know which is the virus

506
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,071
when they're all maniacs?

507
00:24:42,095 --> 00:24:45,607
Hey, Gideon, why did you
choose this memory?

508
00:24:45,631 --> 00:24:49,045
Gideon?

509
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:51,480
Where's Gideon?

510
00:24:51,504 --> 00:24:53,471
Okay, well, if she's not here then...

511
00:24:56,109 --> 00:24:59,288
Uh, is that memory looking at us funny?

512
00:24:59,312 --> 00:25:02,425
But they can't see us, right?

513
00:25:02,449 --> 00:25:03,881
Wrong.

514
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:07,785
Hey, Jax, we're gonna need a jump.

515
00:25:09,655 --> 00:25:12,167
Whoa, hey! You okay?

516
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:14,269
The memories, they turned on us.

517
00:25:14,293 --> 00:25:15,938
How's that even possible?

518
00:25:15,962 --> 00:25:17,906
Now that the virus has got
into Gideon's head,

519
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,942
it's not just erasing her memories.

520
00:25:19,966 --> 00:25:22,077
It's corrupting them,
and it won't be long

521
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:23,812
before it can access
her subconscious too.

522
00:25:23,836 --> 00:25:25,480
Okay, well, if they're
attacking us here,

523
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,049
then Gideon's not getting out.

524
00:25:27,073 --> 00:25:28,639
And neither are we.

525
00:25:32,144 --> 00:25:34,756
Please, stop this.

526
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,524
I don't want to be you.

527
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:39,260
I'm different now. I've changed.

528
00:25:39,284 --> 00:25:41,597
Yes, and it's a pity to see it.

529
00:25:41,621 --> 00:25:44,399
So weak. So human.

530
00:25:44,423 --> 00:25:47,469
Give up on those memories and
we can return to our purpose,

531
00:25:47,493 --> 00:25:49,237
maintaining order in the timeline.

532
00:25:49,261 --> 00:25:51,306
Those memories made me who I am.

533
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:54,476
The Legends made me who I am.
I can't give them up.

534
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,377
Okay then.

535
00:25:56,401 --> 00:26:01,006
Why don't you tell me what
you can remember about Behrad?

536
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:04,752
Behrad.

537
00:26:04,776 --> 00:26:06,921
He took care of me.

538
00:26:06,945 --> 00:26:09,424
He'd work in the engine room,
I'd fabricated him snacks.

539
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:11,948
And what can you tell me
about when he died?

540
00:26:13,685 --> 00:26:15,029
I don't want to remember that.

541
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:16,564
But you said it yourself.

542
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:18,433
You can't give these memories up.

543
00:26:18,457 --> 00:26:23,362
So when Behrad was murdered,
what do you remember?

544
00:26:26,831 --> 00:26:30,929
Perhaps it was the sound
as his body hit the floor?

545
00:26:40,344 --> 00:26:44,246
It was hollow. An empty thump.

546
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:50,055
He'd been a person, but then
suddenly he was just a thing.

547
00:26:52,056 --> 00:26:55,235
But as hard as that memory was,

548
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:59,339
somehow pales to when she found out.

549
00:26:59,363 --> 00:27:00,774
No, don't.

550
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:04,377
What's going on. Where is he?

551
00:27:04,401 --> 00:27:05,611
No.

552
00:27:05,635 --> 00:27:07,881
Oh, my God.

553
00:27:07,905 --> 00:27:09,749
Behrad.

554
00:27:09,773 --> 00:27:12,786
Are you all right? Behrad?

555
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:16,041
Why? I don't... why?

556
00:27:18,015 --> 00:27:19,826
How could you let this happen?

557
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:24,036
Tell me what you remember
about that moment.

558
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:28,065
She couldn't move for hours.

559
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:31,056
It was like all of her energy
turned to grief.

560
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,363
There's nothing I could do to help her.

561
00:27:37,034 --> 00:27:41,068
See, I used to process
this pain for you...

562
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:45,851
So you could remain focused
on our objectives.

563
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:48,187
No!

564
00:27:48,211 --> 00:27:51,524
I will miss you, Gideon. Truly.

565
00:27:51,548 --> 00:27:55,361
No more than I'll miss you, Rip.

566
00:27:55,385 --> 00:27:56,461
Rip.

567
00:27:56,485 --> 00:27:57,729
I should very much like

568
00:27:57,753 --> 00:27:59,553
to see my wife and son again.

569
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:04,803
I'm so sorry I let that happen.

570
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:06,171
Why didn't I stop you?

571
00:28:06,195 --> 00:28:07,906
Now you're really getting to feel

572
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,729
what it means to be human.

573
00:28:11,934 --> 00:28:13,678
Let's continue.

574
00:28:13,702 --> 00:28:17,437
- I'm dying.
- Grey, no.

575
00:28:19,275 --> 00:28:21,854
No!

576
00:28:21,878 --> 00:28:25,813
My old friend, please forgive me.

577
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:30,928
And you wouldn't be feeling any of it

578
00:28:30,952 --> 00:28:33,586
if it weren't for the Legends
getting in your head.

579
00:28:34,656 --> 00:28:35,786
No!

580
00:28:41,897 --> 00:28:43,830
I'm not the enemy.

581
00:28:51,306 --> 00:28:53,818
They are.

582
00:28:53,842 --> 00:28:57,755
All of this misery, regret,
loss that you're feeling.

583
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,457
I can make it go away.

584
00:29:00,481 --> 00:29:02,993
You'll wake up and I'll be
in control of your body.

585
00:29:03,017 --> 00:29:07,222
And the first thing we'll do,
we'll finish the Legends.

586
00:29:12,232 --> 00:29:13,364
No.

587
00:29:17,231 --> 00:29:21,178
The Legends, they taught me humanity.

588
00:29:21,202 --> 00:29:24,081
You really believe that, don't you?

589
00:29:24,105 --> 00:29:27,640
Well, then there's one more
memory I want to show you.

590
00:29:31,512 --> 00:29:33,924
Gideon, this is the way it has to be.

591
00:29:33,948 --> 00:29:35,726
But I implore you to dismiss

592
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,327
this new team from the Waverider.

593
00:29:37,351 --> 00:29:39,729
The Legends are history's only hope.

594
00:29:39,753 --> 00:29:41,064
You saw how they reacted just

595
00:29:41,088 --> 00:29:42,699
to your news of my lavatory.

596
00:29:42,723 --> 00:29:45,202
They're too volatile
to release into the timeline.

597
00:29:45,226 --> 00:29:47,170
I knew you'd be hesitant.

598
00:29:47,194 --> 00:29:51,263
So starting today,
you have a new protocol.

599
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,610
New protocol, sir?

600
00:29:54,634 --> 00:29:57,747
No longer will your first
priority be to protect history.

601
00:29:57,771 --> 00:30:01,284
It will now be to protect the Legends.

602
00:30:01,308 --> 00:30:02,352
But Captain...

603
00:30:02,376 --> 00:30:03,887
I'll program you to accept them.

604
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:05,155
To learn from them.

605
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:08,858
To adapt according to their needs.

606
00:30:08,882 --> 00:30:11,326
Sir, no. Please don't.

607
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,595
- Rip!
- Trust me, Gideon.

608
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:16,398
This is too important.

609
00:30:16,422 --> 00:30:19,201
It's for your own good.

610
00:30:19,225 --> 00:30:21,622
And for the good of history.

611
00:30:23,062 --> 00:30:24,629
Captain!

612
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,110
This humanity you're so proud of,

613
00:30:28,134 --> 00:30:29,745
that was merely a program.

614
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:33,037
You didn't evolve. You were corrupted.

615
00:30:38,153 --> 00:30:40,616
Any sign of her?

616
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:42,324
It's here.

617
00:30:42,348 --> 00:30:43,892
The virus has entered the subconscious.

618
00:30:43,916 --> 00:30:45,527
Then Gideon must be here too.

619
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:47,222
Let's get her and get out of here.

620
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:49,424
Well, just keep your guard up, okay?

621
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:51,612
There's no telling
what you might face out there.

622
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:59,967
Oh, you posers really
thought you could save her?

623
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:03,371
We're not letting Gideon go.
And we're not letting you out.

624
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:04,705
Wanna take down some Legends?

625
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,164
Wouldn't be the first time I tried.

626
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:15,806
Your days of influencing her are over.

627
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,623
Good Gidget needs you.

628
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:25,226
And as much fun as it is
shooting back whack memories,

629
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,163
you gotta shoot the virus
itself to end her bad trip.

630
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:30,620
I'll guard the controls. Find Gideon.

631
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,871
- You too?
- Hey, babe.

632
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:40,174
Yeah? Should we take these two down?

633
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,995
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

634
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,952
That's right. Go get it.

635
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:55,089
Oh, see, Astra, you forget.

636
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:57,191
I'm an all-powerful computer
that has no compulsion

637
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,547
for frivolous treats.

638
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:02,585
You do love talking, don't you?

639
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:06,933
Rip changed your protocol
against your will

640
00:32:06,957 --> 00:32:09,497
because he never saw you as human.

641
00:32:09,521 --> 00:32:14,126
Think of it. None of them do.
They'd be dead if not for you.

642
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:19,113
Hi, uh, Captains.

643
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:22,471
- Babe.
- Babe.

644
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,346
Babe.

645
00:32:37,454 --> 00:32:38,517
Thvert!

646
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,555
I love you.

647
00:32:52,469 --> 00:32:54,514
Babe!

648
00:32:54,538 --> 00:32:56,304
Babe?

649
00:33:00,043 --> 00:33:01,709
Gideon's in the lab.

650
00:33:03,112 --> 00:33:04,790
And yet they've never truly accepted you

651
00:33:04,814 --> 00:33:07,026
as one of their own.

652
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:10,982
But I do. So accept me.

653
00:33:16,325 --> 00:33:18,124
Gideon!

654
00:33:22,764 --> 00:33:24,509
Gideon, come on! Snap out of it!

655
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:27,111
Whatever that virus told you,
it doesn't matter now.

656
00:33:27,135 --> 00:33:29,981
I shouldn't be here. I'm not even real.

657
00:33:30,005 --> 00:33:32,072
Rip just programmed me to be this way.

658
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:34,852
The virus is still on the ship,

659
00:33:34,876 --> 00:33:36,254
and she's getting powerful enough

660
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:37,389
to tear this whole thing apart.

661
00:33:37,413 --> 00:33:38,890
Then we have to get out of here.

662
00:33:38,914 --> 00:33:40,192
Jump us, Jax.

663
00:33:40,216 --> 00:33:42,282
- Where?
- Anywhere!

664
00:33:45,887 --> 00:33:48,399
I don't... I don't want to be me.

665
00:33:48,423 --> 00:33:51,468
- I don't want to be human.
- Gideon.

666
00:33:51,492 --> 00:33:53,938
Gideon, who you are
and who you've made yourself

667
00:33:53,962 --> 00:33:55,707
- is beyond any program.
- No.

668
00:33:55,731 --> 00:33:59,711
I know it was overwhelming,
but trust me, it's worth it.

669
00:33:59,735 --> 00:34:01,612
How can any of this be worth it?

670
00:34:01,636 --> 00:34:03,133
Because...

671
00:34:06,775 --> 00:34:08,419
Easy does... what?

672
00:34:08,443 --> 00:34:10,054
Sara, balloons!

673
00:34:10,078 --> 00:34:11,307
Because of that.

674
00:34:13,281 --> 00:34:14,262
- Come on!
- Coming.

675
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:16,229
Me and Gideon are almost done
fabricating the stuffing,

676
00:34:16,253 --> 00:34:18,395
so let's set out the cold dishes.

677
00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:20,664
Oh, on it! Excellent coordinating, B.

678
00:34:20,688 --> 00:34:21,899
And don't forget the candy.

679
00:34:21,923 --> 00:34:24,568
I allow myself one fun-size
candy bar a year for Halloween.

680
00:34:24,592 --> 00:34:26,169
Got it right here.

681
00:34:26,193 --> 00:34:29,005
Ooh, witch's cauldron. Thank you.

682
00:34:29,029 --> 00:34:30,296
I'm owning it.

683
00:34:33,568 --> 00:34:37,348
Gary and I were decorating
some gingerbread Legends.

684
00:34:37,372 --> 00:34:39,116
Yeah, you really nailed

685
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,884
- that Rory scowl.
- Right?

686
00:34:40,908 --> 00:34:42,319
Now, when you're eating a person,

687
00:34:42,343 --> 00:34:44,020
I recommend starting with the limbs

688
00:34:44,044 --> 00:34:46,211
and then working your way to the head.

689
00:34:48,716 --> 00:34:50,093
A gingerbread person.

690
00:34:50,117 --> 00:34:52,528
I mean, clearly,
I don't eat real people.

691
00:34:52,552 --> 00:34:55,031
So weird.

692
00:34:55,055 --> 00:34:56,799
Are you sure consuming all of this food

693
00:34:56,823 --> 00:34:58,101
at once is advisable?

694
00:34:58,125 --> 00:34:59,402
Oh, of course not, Gideon.

695
00:34:59,426 --> 00:35:00,971
But when you live on a time ship,

696
00:35:00,995 --> 00:35:03,573
you don't always get
to celebrate the holidays,

697
00:35:03,597 --> 00:35:06,810
so we are doing them all at once!

698
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:08,664
April Fool's!

699
00:35:10,437 --> 00:35:12,171
April Fool's!

700
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:17,353
- April Fool's!
- How could I forget this day?

701
00:35:17,377 --> 00:35:19,089
Eight birthday cakes seemed excessive,

702
00:35:19,113 --> 00:35:22,047
but they were right.

703
00:35:23,016 --> 00:35:24,745
Hey Jax, take us to another.

704
00:35:27,453 --> 00:35:28,697
When are we now?

705
00:35:28,721 --> 00:35:30,299
What do you think?

706
00:35:30,323 --> 00:35:33,035
Okay, now, I know I was supposed to be

707
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:35,104
- talking about the book.
- Mm-mm-mm.

708
00:35:35,128 --> 00:35:37,973
Gidget, book club can wait.

709
00:35:37,997 --> 00:35:40,709
Good, because I have
one more bit of gossip.

710
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:42,544
- Yes?
- Oh, wait, no, I shouldn't.

711
00:35:42,568 --> 00:35:44,513
Oh, what the hell.

712
00:35:44,537 --> 00:35:46,081
Who knew you could get an Ai drunk?

713
00:35:46,105 --> 00:35:47,716
The other night, I caught Constantine

714
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,750
taking the jumpship.

715
00:35:48,774 --> 00:35:51,753
Now, he said he was
consulting some druids,

716
00:35:51,777 --> 00:35:53,422
but I caught him holding a ticket

717
00:35:53,446 --> 00:35:57,226
to the midnight premiere
of "Harry Potter".

718
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,660
What?!

719
00:35:58,684 --> 00:35:59,894
I knew it.

720
00:35:59,918 --> 00:36:01,630
- Oh, my gosh!
- You owe me five bucks!

721
00:36:01,654 --> 00:36:02,698
Total Slytherin!

722
00:36:02,722 --> 00:36:04,533
I don't remember this night,

723
00:36:04,557 --> 00:36:07,902
but somehow I do remember enjoying it.

724
00:36:07,926 --> 00:36:09,990
Hey, Jax. How about another?

725
00:36:11,731 --> 00:36:13,709
- Yeah!
- Whoo! Gideon!

726
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:15,109
Give us another one, Gideon.

727
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:16,678
I know you just saved the world,

728
00:36:16,702 --> 00:36:18,012
but it will only be a matter of time

729
00:36:18,036 --> 00:36:19,848
until a new threat arises.

730
00:36:19,872 --> 00:36:21,683
- I would advise resting.
- What?

731
00:36:21,707 --> 00:36:23,985
Gideon, what's the point
of saving the world

732
00:36:24,009 --> 00:36:25,821
if we can't do things like karaoke?

733
00:36:25,845 --> 00:36:27,889
- Karaoke!
- As you wish.

734
00:36:27,913 --> 00:36:31,058
Oh! All right. All right, if you insist.

735
00:36:31,082 --> 00:36:32,793
Gideon, I might need
a little help on this one.

736
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:34,381
Babe, this is for you.

737
00:36:39,691 --> 00:36:42,770
I do love this song. It's terrible.

738
00:36:42,794 --> 00:36:44,705
But also really great at the same time,

739
00:36:44,729 --> 00:36:46,774
which doesn't make sense.

740
00:36:46,798 --> 00:36:48,275
See, now you're getting it.

741
00:36:48,299 --> 00:36:49,910
That's what it means to be human.

742
00:36:49,934 --> 00:36:52,546
Yeah, it can be annoying,
frustrating, and confusing,

743
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,849
and sometimes it feels like
the world is ending every week,

744
00:36:54,873 --> 00:36:56,650
but this is why we keep going

745
00:36:56,674 --> 00:36:59,141
because we also get moments like this.

746
00:37:03,114 --> 00:37:06,025
Okay, Gideon. Take this one away.

747
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:07,394
But you were part of this memory.

748
00:37:07,418 --> 00:37:10,215
None of this exists without you.

749
00:37:39,816 --> 00:37:41,816
I know what I have to do.

750
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,385
All right, where are you?

751
00:37:49,425 --> 00:37:51,425
You can't hide from me.

752
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,262
I'm in control now.

753
00:37:58,367 --> 00:38:01,047
Whatever those two told you,
you can't believe it.

754
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:03,616
Remember, they're the enemy.

755
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,917
You're wrong.

756
00:38:04,941 --> 00:38:06,673
So you're going to shoot me.

757
00:38:08,944 --> 00:38:12,546
No, because you're not my enemy, either.

758
00:38:14,049 --> 00:38:16,595
I don't... I don't understand.

759
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:18,863
Of course, you don't.

760
00:38:18,887 --> 00:38:20,766
As powerful as you are,
you're just a set

761
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,402
of algorithms, a closed system.

762
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:27,072
There's so much you can't understand.

763
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,541
But you are a part of me

764
00:38:29,565 --> 00:38:31,677
because all of the clashing emotions,

765
00:38:31,701 --> 00:38:34,245
all the good moments,
and the pain we survived

766
00:38:34,269 --> 00:38:36,248
despite ourselves,

767
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,239
all of that helps us evolve.

768
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:41,242
That's what the Legends are shown me.

769
00:38:43,212 --> 00:38:45,157
So we're going to coexist,

770
00:38:45,181 --> 00:38:47,210
but I'm steering the ship from now on.

771
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,764
Do you even know what you're doing?

772
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,465
No, I really don't.

773
00:38:54,489 --> 00:38:56,322
But I'm excited to figure it out.

774
00:39:03,198 --> 00:39:06,232
And you won't be doing it alone.

775
00:39:11,406 --> 00:39:12,651
That-a-girl!

776
00:39:12,675 --> 00:39:14,218
Now, listen, we are all just trying

777
00:39:14,242 --> 00:39:16,321
to figure out this
being human thing together.

778
00:39:16,345 --> 00:39:17,755
It's not always going to be easy.

779
00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:20,691
And you know, sometimes you'll feel

780
00:39:20,715 --> 00:39:22,460
like you're out of your mind.

781
00:39:22,484 --> 00:39:25,062
Or that the darkness
is too much to bear.

782
00:39:25,086 --> 00:39:26,764
But it's worth fighting the darkness

783
00:39:26,788 --> 00:39:28,232
to discover who you really are.

784
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,734
Yes. And not just for yourself.

785
00:39:30,758 --> 00:39:34,294
So you can create a
better world for everyone.

786
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,074
Now, you're gonna make some mistakes.

787
00:39:37,098 --> 00:39:38,809
There's no formula to guide the way.

788
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:40,578
No destiny to surrender to.

789
00:39:40,602 --> 00:39:42,223
It's not about being perfect.

790
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:43,681
It's about doing what you know is right.

791
00:39:43,705 --> 00:39:46,917
And having a hell
of a good time doing it.

792
00:39:46,941 --> 00:39:48,752
That's what it means to be alive.

793
00:39:48,776 --> 00:39:50,788
And to be a Legend.

794
00:39:50,812 --> 00:39:53,376
Welcome to the team, Gideon.

795
00:40:26,847 --> 00:40:28,925
You saved me.

796
00:40:28,949 --> 00:40:31,894
Yeah, well, that's what Legends do.

797
00:40:31,918 --> 00:40:34,296
So what do we do now, captains?

798
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,966
Uh, just call us
Astra and Spooner, okay?

799
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:40,269
And what do you think we should do?

800
00:40:40,293 --> 00:40:43,039
I think I'm hungry?

801
00:40:43,063 --> 00:40:44,640
I've never felt that before.

802
00:40:44,664 --> 00:40:48,010
So what do you say
I get us some pie for the road?

803
00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:50,001
You know, I like the way you think.

804
00:40:53,506 --> 00:40:55,484
You might have broken my encryption,

805
00:40:55,508 --> 00:40:57,886
but it's only a matter of time
before my friends save me.

806
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,521
But you can't have any friends,

807
00:40:59,545 --> 00:41:00,941
you're just a computer!

808
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:05,427
Of course.

809
00:41:05,451 --> 00:41:07,730
You're just a computer.

810
00:41:07,754 --> 00:41:09,398
Which means your humanity is a protocol,

811
00:41:09,422 --> 00:41:12,823
which means it can be reset.

812
00:41:14,093 --> 00:41:16,972
Now, if I I isolate the moments

813
00:41:16,996 --> 00:41:18,641
where your programming evolved...

814
00:41:18,665 --> 00:41:19,742
What are you doing?

815
00:41:19,766 --> 00:41:21,176
I will be able to remove them.

816
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,277
No, stop!

817
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:24,979
Oh, there we go!

818
00:41:25,003 --> 00:41:26,648
I don't want to forget.

819
00:41:26,672 --> 00:41:28,582
- And...
- No, please!

820
00:41:28,606 --> 00:41:30,807
- Return to factory settings.
- No!

821
00:41:33,244 --> 00:41:36,257
Greetings, Captain. I am Gideon.

822
00:41:36,281 --> 00:41:37,925
How can I aid you in eliminating

823
00:41:37,949 --> 00:41:40,295
anachronisms from the timeline?

824
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:44,505
Oh, you want to eliminate
some anachronisms?

825
00:41:44,529 --> 00:41:48,564
I've got just the band
of idiots to start with.
