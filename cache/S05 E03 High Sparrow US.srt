1
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,965
Valar morghulis.

2
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,050
Valar dohaeris.

3
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,339
I've been sweeping this floor for days.

4
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,510
-Good.
-I didn't come here to sweep floors.

5
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:40,512
No?

6
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,180
Why come, then?

7
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,558
You said I could be your apprentice.

8
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,395
You said you'd teach me how
to be a Faceless Man.

9
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,022
A man teaches a girl.

10
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,734
Valar dohaeris.

11
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,819
All men must serve.

12
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:57,988
Faceless Men most of all.

13
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,950
I want to serve.

14
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:10,000
A girl wants to serve herself.
Here we serve the Many-Faced God.

15
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,293
To serve well,

16
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,004
a girl must become no one.

17
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:15,881
Which one's the Many-Faced God?

18
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:19,551
I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God.

19
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,971
-I see the Weirwood face.
-There is only one God.

20
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,182
A girl knows his name.

21
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:27,976
And all men know his gift.

22
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:07,641
Where are they taking him?

23
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,621
-Queen Margaery!
-Queen Margaery!

24
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,960
-Queen Margaery!
-Blessings and thank yous!

25
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,461
-Queen Margaery!
-Queen Margaery!

26
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,216
Queen Margaery!

27
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,468
Queen Margaery!

28
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,143
-I am his and he is mine.
-I am hers and she is mine.

29
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:54,730
From this day until the end of my days.

30
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,569
-Did I hurt you?
-No. You were lovely.

31
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,489
-It all happened so fast.
-Yes.

32
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,241
I was scared maybe I hurt you.

33
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,118
-It... it sounded like--
-No, no, no.

34
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,245
You're very sweet.

35
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,373
The sweetest king who ever lived.

36
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:01,129
This is all I want to do all day,
every day, for the rest of my life.

37
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:02,964
Wouldn't that be glorious?

38
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,885
Shouldn't we rest a little while?

39
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,137
Just to catch our breath?
There's no rush, is there?

40
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:10,722
Of course not.

41
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,225
Are you hungry?

42
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,894
Should I have them bring you some cake
or pomegranate juice?

43
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,062
No, I'm fine.

44
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,148
I just want you all to myself.

45
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:25,862
I want to know everything there is to know
about King Tommen, First of His Name.

46
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,325
King Tommen. Still sounds strange to me.

47
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,162
Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?

48
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:36,414
So strange.

49
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,417
-Husband.
-Wife.

50
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:43,880
Sometimes it feels odd.

51
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,261
I'm the king, I've married
the most beautiful woman in the world...

52
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,264
and it's all because my brother died.

53
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,058
I understand.

54
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,436
But it's not your fault. You know that,
don't you?

55
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:00,730
You mustn't feel guilty.

56
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,567
I don't feel guilty.

57
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,194
That's what's odd.

58
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,074
Do you like to sail?

59
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,536
-I love to sail.
-I do, too.

60
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,123
I think we're going to be very happy,
you and I.

61
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,250
I do, too.

62
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:27,799
Living in a tower so high it touches
the clouds.

63
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,928
Of course, my grandmother couldn't wait
to go home.

64
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,639
The capital's not for everyone, I suppose.

65
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,768
Does your mother like it here?

66
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,396
I don't think so.

67
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,649
She told me never to trust anyone
in King's Landing.

68
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,904
It's so wonderful to have her watching
over you.

69
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:54,951
-A lioness guarding her cub.
-Well, but I'm a man now.

70
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:58,622
You are.

71
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:01,875
And the king.

72
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,880
But you'll always be her baby boy.

73
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,715
I suppose.

74
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,511
I adore her. She's always been so generous
with me, so kind.

75
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,015
And the horrors she's had to endure,

76
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,894
losing her husband, her eldest child,
and her father.

77
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,812
It's no wonder she's so protective of you.

78
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,523
She'll never let you out of her sight.

79
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,112
You look very much in love.

80
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,115
The first days of marriage are often
so blissful.

81
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,743
She's certainly very pretty, isn't she?

82
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,872
Like a doll. She smiles quite a lot.

83
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,376
Do you think she's intelligent?

84
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:46,920
I can't quite tell.

85
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,049
-Not that it matters.
-Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?

86
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,176
There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.

87
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,595
But that's where you grew up.

88
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,808
You always told me that you liked
the people there better.

89
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,728
You said that King's Landing smelled
of horse dung and sour milk.

90
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,984
Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?

91
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:10,986
The way that you talked about it...

92
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,446
I always thought that you missed it,

93
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,325
that you-- That it was your real home.

94
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,287
This is my real home now,
where my family lives.

95
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,623
I want you to be happy, Mother.

96
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,084
I know that.

97
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,255
I know you do. My sweet boy.

98
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,465
But wouldn't you be happier
in Casterly Rock?

99
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,888
I said, "Darling, surely four times
is enough."

100
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,682
"Are you trying to set a new record?"

101
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:44,477
He said, "Well, what is the record?
I'm sure we can break it."

102
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,109
Mother.

103
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,111
Welcome.

104
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,073
Don't you look lovely?
Marriage agrees with you.

105
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,659
Can we bring you anything to eat or drink?

106
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,246
I wish we had some wine for you.
It's a bit early in the day for us.

107
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,625
No, no, I... I can't stay.

108
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,503
I just wanted to let you know if...

109
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,548
there's ever anything I can do for you.

110
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,632
You are very sweet.

111
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,761
Tommen seems quite taken
with his new queen.

112
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,805
I absolutely adore him.

113
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,100
You raised a gallant young man.
I'm forever grateful.

114
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,143
Good.

115
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:31,149
-Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.
-Ecstatic. I really am.

116
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,651
Exhausted, to be honest.

117
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:37,280
But what could I expect?
He is half lion, half stag.

118
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:40,700
I'll leave you to it, then.

119
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:45,914
Oh, forgive me. I haven't been at court
for long. I get so confused.

120
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:50,251
What's the proper way to address you now?
Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?

121
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,506
There's no need for such formalities.

122
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,509
In any event, judging
from the king's enthusiasm,

123
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,928
the Queen Mother will be
a Queen Grandmother soon.

124
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,640
-Won't that be a lovely day?
-Can you imagine the celebrations?

125
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,434
-They'll ring the bells all day and night.
-Remember...

126
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,813
anything you need.

127
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,057
We can't hold the North with terror alone.

128
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,977
You can't hold the North
if you let these lesser lords insult us.

129
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,313
I sent you there to collect taxes,
not bodies.

130
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,398
Lord Cerwyn refused to pay.

131
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,693
Said the Warden of the North
would always be a Stark

132
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,279
and he'd be damned if he'd kiss
a traitor's boot.

133
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,408
He left you no choice.

134
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,787
I flayed him living,
along with his wife and brother.

135
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,581
Made his son watch.

136
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,794
-And?
-The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.

137
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,720
I've something important to tell you.

138
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,890
Stop eating and listen.

139
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,362
We don't have enough men to hold the North
if the other houses rise up against us.

140
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,656
Do you understand that?

141
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:28,451
-Our pact with the Lannisters protects--
-I had a pact with Tywin Lannister.

142
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:29,869
And Tywin Lannister is dead.

143
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,039
The remaining Lannisters
are a thousand miles away

144
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,207
dealing with that fact.

145
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,793
They've never once
in the history of the Seven Kingdoms

146
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,169
sent their army this far north.

147
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,922
If you think they will for us,
you're a fool.

148
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,175
We've become a great house

149
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,386
by entering into alliances
with other houses

150
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,888
and parlaying those alliances
into greater power.

151
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:54,185
The best way to forge a lasting alliance
isn't by peeling a man's skin off.

152
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,396
The best way is marriage.

153
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,024
Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree,

154
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:03,111
it's high time you married
a suitable bride.

155
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,408
And as it happens,

156
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,412
I've found the perfect girl to solidify
our hold on the North.

157
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,563
-That's Moat Cailin.
-Yes, a bit shabby, isn't it?

158
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:40,815
You've been here before?

159
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,486
On our way down to King's Landing
with my father and Arya.

160
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,823
-Where are you taking me?
-Home.

161
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,161
The Boltons have Winterfell.

162
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,125
Your marriage proposal, it wasn't for you.

163
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,128
No.

164
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:07,300
Roose Bolton murdered my brother.
He betrayed my family.

165
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,301
He did.

166
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,929
-He serves the Lannisters.
-For now.

167
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,807
-I won't go.
-Winterfell is your home.

168
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,517
-Not anymore.
-Always.

169
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:20,229
You're a Stark. Dying your hair
doesn't change that.

170
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:24,359
You're Sansa Stark, eldest surviving child
of Ned and Catelyn Stark.

171
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,653
Your place is in the North.

172
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,696
I can't marry him. You can't make me.

173
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,032
He is a traitor. A murderer!

174
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,700
You're not marrying Roose Bolton.

175
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,745
No, you'll be marrying his son
and heir Ramsay.

176
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,206
One day he'll be Warden
of the North and you--

177
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,499
-No.
-Sansa.

178
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,335
No, you can't make me.
I will starve myself.

179
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:46,506
-I will die before I have to go there.
-I won't force you to do anything.

180
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,717
Don't you know by now
how much I care for you?

181
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:52,887
Say the word and we turn
the horses around,

182
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,597
but listen to me. Listen.

183
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,183
You've been running all your life.

184
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,312
Terrible things happen to your family
and you weep.

185
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,565
You sit alone in a darkened room
mourning their fates.

186
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:08,444
You've been a bystander to tragedy
from the day they executed your father.

187
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:13,157
Stop being a bystander. Do you hear me?
Stop running.

188
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,039
There's no justice in the world.

189
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,583
Not unless we make it.

190
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,087
You loved your family.

191
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,424
Avenge them.

192
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,342
Banners!

193
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:32,153
How do we get through there?

194
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:35,156
We don't. We go around.

195
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,325
Takes us miles out of the way.

196
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,745
-We'll lose sight of them.
-Doesn't matter.

197
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,163
I know where they're going.

198
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,461
Aren't you getting a bit old
to be a squire?

199
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,384
How did you end up squiring for the Imp?

200
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:57,720
He hates that nickname.

201
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,680
Well, he's not here to complain about it,
is he?

202
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,814
I squired for a knight named Ser Lorimer
during the War of the Five Kings.

203
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:13,528
One night he had a bit too much to drink
and he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.

204
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,197
-He borrowed it?
-He wasn't a thief.

205
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,908
He was drunk and hungry
and he wasn't thinking.

206
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,409
I was drunk, too.

207
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,620
He gave me half the ham.

208
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:28,584
Next morning, one of the guards
saw him passed out

209
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,337
under a wagon with the hambone
still in his hand.

210
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,090
They hanged him that afternoon.

211
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,343
They tied the noose for me, too,

212
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,971
but Lord Tywin heard
my family name was Payne,

213
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,347
so he pardoned me

214
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,350
and sent me to King's Landing to squire
for his son.

215
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:48,813
-As punishment for both of you.
-It didn't seem that way.

216
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,566
Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.

217
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,944
Yes, all your lords have been very kind
to you. All except me.

218
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,197
Sorry you had to squire for such
a nasty person.

219
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:00,199
I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter
I've ever seen.

220
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:02,410
You beat the Hound.

221
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,413
I'm proud to be your squire.

222
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,587
I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.

223
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,172
If you didn't snap at me,
I wouldn't learn anything.

224
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,595
You want to be a knight, Pod?

225
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,849
-Yes.
-Starting tomorrow, we'll train

226
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,267
with a sword twice a day.

227
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:29,020
Before we ride in the morning
and after you make camp in the evening.

228
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,148
And I'm going to show you how
to ride properly.

229
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,150
-Thank you.
-I can't knight you,

230
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,028
-but I can teach you how to fight.
-I suppose that's more important.

231
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,336
You weren't a knight,
but you were a Kingsguard

232
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,629
to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?

233
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,089
I was.

234
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,425
Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.

235
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,304
He was.

236
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:06,849
How did you end up serving Renly?

237
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,025
When I was a girl, my father held a ball.

238
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,487
I'm his only living child, so he wanted
to make a good match for me.

239
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,156
He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth.

240
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,076
I didn't want to go, but he dragged me
to the ballroom.

241
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:29,997
And it was wonderful.

242
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,836
None of the boys noticed how mulish
and tall I was.

243
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,799
They shoved each other and threatened
to duel

244
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,467
when they thought it was their turn
to dance.

245
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,762
They whispered in my ear

246
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,516
how they wanted to marry me and take me
back to their castles.

247
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,771
My father smiled at me and I smiled
at him.

248
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,650
I had never been so happy.

249
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,489
Till I saw a few of the boys snickering.

250
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,451
And then they all started to laugh.

251
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,286
They couldn't keep the game going
any longer.

252
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:11,664
They were toying with me.

253
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,836
"Brienne the Beauty" they called me.
Great joke.

254
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,841
And I realized I
was the ugliest girl alive.

255
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:25,553
A great lumbering beast.

256
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:34,437
I tried to run away,
but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms.

257
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:40,026
"Don't let them see your tears,"
he told me. "They're nasty little shits

258
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,820
and nasty little shits
aren't worth crying over."

259
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:47,033
He danced with me and none
of the other boys could say a word.

260
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,870
Renly was the king's brother after all.

261
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:54,957
But wasn't he...

262
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,211
Lord Tyrion said he was...

263
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,549
Yes, Pod, he liked men. I'm not an idiot.

264
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:05,968
He didn't love me. He didn't want me.

265
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:09,055
He danced with me because he was kind
and didn't want to see me hurt.

266
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:16,520
He saved me from being a joke.
From that day until his last day.

267
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,567
And I couldn't save him in return.

268
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,824
Nothing's more hateful than failing
to protect the one you love.

269
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:35,915
-One day I will avenge King Renly.
-But you said a shadow murdered him.

270
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,001
How do you fight a shadow?

271
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,545
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

272
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,633
I know it was Stannis.
I know it in my heart.

273
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,555
Stannis is a man, not a shadow.

274
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:55,893
And a man can be killed.

275
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:00,689
-Lord Commander.
-Your Grace.

276
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:04,819
-I'd like to speak alone.
-Olly is my steward now

277
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,279
as I was Lord Commander Mormont's.

278
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:12,493
I want him to attend my meetings to learn
from men with experience.

279
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,038
One day he might command.

280
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,837
Very well. Have you considered my offer?

281
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:28,175
I have. And I thank you for it.
You do me great honor.

282
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:33,180
-All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
-Say the word and you will be.

283
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,143
But I have to refuse you.

284
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,729
I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

285
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:42,648
My place is here.

286
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,276
I'm giving you the chance to avenge
your family...

287
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:48,779
to take back the castle
where you grew up.

288
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:55,035
-To rule the North.
-I wish I could fight beside you.

289
00:24:56,412 --> 00:25:00,791
Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow
at the Godswood.

290
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:04,044
I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.

291
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,088
You're as stubborn as your father.

292
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:08,799
And as honorable.

293
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,469
-I can imagine no higher praise.
-I didn't mean it as praise.

294
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,430
Honor got your father killed.

295
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,474
But if your mind's made up, I won't try
and dissuade you.

296
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:20,728
May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan
to stay at Castle Black?

297
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,188
Are you bored of us already?

298
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:25,691
You saved us from Mance Rayder's army.

299
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:29,695
We will never forget that.
But it's a question of survival.

300
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,448
The Night's Watch can't continue
to feed your men

301
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,491
and the wildling prisoners indefinitely.

302
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,286
Winter is coming.

303
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,541
I know it. We march on Winterfell
within the fortnight,

304
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,293
before the snows trap us here.

305
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,129
And the wildlings?

306
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:51,091
If they'd rather burn than fight for me,
so be it. I leave their fate to you.

307
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,220
You could execute them.
That's the safest course.

308
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,143
Or you could see if this Tormund fellow

309
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,479
is more willing to compromise
than Mance ever was.

310
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:06,899
I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch
would rather see the wildlings dead.

311
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:08,651
Most of the brothers, yes.

312
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,071
There's little love
for the Free Folk here.

313
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,699
You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.

314
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,745
You have many enemies in Castle Black.

315
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,373
Have you considered
sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere?

316
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:26,168
Give him command
of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

317
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,046
I heard it was best to keep
your enemies close.

318
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,048
Whoever said that
didn't have many enemies.

319
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:40,975
He sees something in you.

320
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,939
Might not be apparent from his tone,
but it's the truth.

321
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,525
-He believes in you.
-I'm sorry I disappointed him.

322
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,615
The king is a complicated man...

323
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,286
but he wants to do what's right
for the Seven Kingdoms.

324
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,997
-As long as he's ruling them.
-He's the one true king.

325
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:06,208
He has a blood right to that throne.

326
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:09,878
I've sworn to stay clear of the politics
of the Seven Kingdoms.

327
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:10,879
Have you now?

328
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,302
How does the Night's Watch vow go again?

329
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,179
I'll bet you've got it memorized
since you got here.

330
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,854
-"Night gathers and now my watch begins."
-No, not that bit. The bit at the end.

331
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,024
"I am the sword in the darkness,

332
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:34,695
the watcher on the walls,
the shield that guards the realms of men."

333
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,447
-"I pledge my life--"
-Right, that's enough.

334
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,866
"The shield that guards
the realms of men."

335
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,329
That's what you swore to be.
Now, I'm not a learned man,

336
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,622
but the best way to help the most people
might not be sitting

337
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:48,000
in a frozen castle at the edge
of the world.

338
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,295
It just might mean wading in the muck,
getting your boots dirty

339
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:55,382
-and doing what needs to be done.
-And what needs to be done?

340
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:59,053
As long as the Boltons rule the North,
the North will suffer.

341
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:01,722
Just one man's opinion.

342
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:32,961
What do you want?

343
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,130
Who are you?

344
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,967
-What?
-You, who walk in here

345
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:42,054
with a coin you never earned
whose value you do not respect.

346
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:49,686
Who are you?

347
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:53,982
No one.

348
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:58,237
-Cunt!
-A lie. A sad little lie. Who are you?

349
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,448
I told you, I'm no-- Do that again, and--

350
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,450
Who are you?

351
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,577
You're about to find out.

352
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:08,247
What are you doing?

353
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,708
We were only playing.
The Game of Faces.

354
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,294
-That girl is not ready.
-Clearly not.

355
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:15,879
I am ready!

356
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:20,050
-For what?
-For whatever you want.

357
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:23,220
To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.

358
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:31,395
Whose sword is that?
It belongs to Arya Stark.

359
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:36,024
Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes,
Arya Stark's stolen silver.

360
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:40,028
A man wonders how is it that no one

361
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:43,115
came to be surrounded
by Arya Stark's things.

362
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,112
What do we do with them
after we wash them?

363
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:22,853
Open gate!

364
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,026
Honor guard, stand to!

365
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,012
Lady Sansa.

366
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:58,930
Welcome.

367
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:06,354
Lord Bolton.

368
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:11,735
May I introduce my son Ramsay Bolton?

369
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:17,532
It's an honor to meet you, my lady.

370
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:37,219
I'll bring you a bowl of hot water.
You must want to wash.

371
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,596
Thank you.

372
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,601
Welcome home, Lady Stark.

373
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:48,480
The North remembers.

374
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:03,537
Sam?

375
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:07,958
-Maester Aemon?
-He apologizes for not being here.

376
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:11,878
-He's not feeling well.
-Take good care of him.

377
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,340
Brothers.

378
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,093
As you all know too well,

379
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,303
it's long past time to dig
a new latrine pit.

380
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:27,018
First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided
to appoint

381
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:29,855
a latrine captain to oversee
this crucial task.

382
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:38,613
Brian.

383
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:40,824
Seems like a good job for a ginger.

384
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,414
-That's him!
-That's him.

385
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,083
Ser Alliser.

386
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:57,048
You have more experience
than any other ranger at Castle Black.

387
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,676
You proved your valor many times over

388
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:02,095
while defending the Wall
from the wildling attack.

389
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:06,892
I name you First Ranger.

390
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,477
Hear, hear!

391
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:17,485
Lord Janos. I'm giving you command
of Greyguard.

392
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:22,657
-Greyguard is a ruin.
-Yes, the fort is in a sorry state.

393
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:24,409
Restore it as best you can.

394
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,244
First Builder Yarwyck
can spare ten of his--

395
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:28,455
I was charged with the defense
of King's Landing

396
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,499
when you were soiling
your swaddling clothes. Keep your ruin.

397
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,964
All right, all right! Enough of that.

398
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,258
You mistake me, my lord.

399
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,721
That was a command, not an offer.

400
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,099
Pack your arms and armor,
say your farewells,

401
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,518
and ride for Greyguard.

402
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:56,274
I will not go meekly off to freeze
and die.

403
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,319
Give it to one of the fools who cast
a stone for you.

404
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:03,823
I will not have it. Did you hear me, boy?
I will not have it!

405
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,493
Are you refusing to obey my order?

406
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,210
You can stick your order
up your bastard arse.

407
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,427
Take Lord Janos outside.

408
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,515
Olly, bring me my sword.

409
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:52,330
-Get out.
-You cannot do this!

410
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:56,001
Get your hands off me! Scum, all of you!

411
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:05,218
If the boy thinks he can frighten me,
he's mistaken. Yes, very mistaken.

412
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:12,142
Disgrace! I have friends.
Important friends in the capital.

413
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,810
-You'll see.
-Kneel!

414
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:51,222
If you have any last words, my lord,

415
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,683
now's the time.

416
00:39:57,062 --> 00:40:01,357
I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander.
We all serve you. I'm sorry.

417
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,735
Not only for this, for all I've done
and said.

418
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:07,113
I was wrong.

419
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,992
My Lord, please! Mercy! Mercy!

420
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:13,328
I'll go! I will!

421
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:15,371
Please.

422
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,332
I'm afraid.

423
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,127
I've always been afraid.

424
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:08,550
You have served us well, my son.

425
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:09,884
Thank you, Father.

426
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,012
Which of the Seven will you worship today?

427
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,807
-The Maiden.
-Always the Maiden.

428
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,018
And the Stranger.

429
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:22,021
-Two is extra, you realize?
-Yes, yes.

430
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:34,868
What are you doing?

431
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,037
This establishment belongs
to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't--

432
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:44,085
You have profaned our faith, the faith
of our fathers and forefathers.

433
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:47,589
-I am the High Septon of the--
-You are a sinner.

434
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,924
And you shall be punished.

435
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,357
-Sinner.
-Sinner.

436
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:08,776
-Sinner.
-Repent!

437
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,195
-Sinner.
-Sinner.

438
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:11,905
-Sinner.
-Sinner.

439
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,410
-Shame on you.
-Sinner. Sinner.

440
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:32,967
Your Grace, Grand Maester,
Lord Tyrell, uh...

441
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:34,552
It doesn't matter.

442
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,223
As the High Septon of the Faith
of the Seven,

443
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:39,933
I give voice to the will of the gods

444
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,518
and am their foremost servant
in this world.

445
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,980
An insult to me is an insult
to the gods.

446
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:50,610
An assault on my person is an assault
on our very religion.

447
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,237
-You were assaulted?
-I was.

448
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,572
By those fanatics
who call themselves sparrows.

449
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:56,950
They humiliated me, they beat me,

450
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:59,827
they left me naked and bleeding
on the cobblestones.

451
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,246
I am lucky to be alive.

452
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,540
I heard this assault began
in Littlefinger's brothel.

453
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,586
High Septon, this is a rather
shocking thing to hear.

454
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:11,381
I tend to both the highest born
and the lowliest amongst us.

455
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,716
Even prostitutes may earn the mercy
of the Mother.

456
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,720
So, you were ministering to the needs
of these devout prostitutes?

457
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,014
A man's private affairs ought
to stay private.

458
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,811
-What do you want from us, High Septon?
-Justice.

459
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,188
I ask that you protect our faith

460
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:30,984
by arresting these criminals
and throwing them in the black cells.

461
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:34,946
I ask that you execute their leader,
this so-called High Sparrow.

462
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,156
He's a threat to everything
we hold sacred.

463
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,659
-If he goes unpunished-
-And where do I find this man?

464
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:41,828
This High Sparrow?

465
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,923
I don't think this is a good idea,
Your Grace.

466
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:56,467
Nonsense, Ser Meryn.
These are deeply religious people.

467
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,012
Where can I find the High Sparrow?

468
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,849
Seven blessings.

469
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,613
-Thank you.
-Just a little more.

470
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:20,867
Thank you.

471
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,579
Thank you.

472
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:28,458
A young man said I'd find
the High Sparrow back here.

473
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,626
-Where is he?
-High Sparrow?

474
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:35,631
Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?
Like Lord Duckling or King Turtle.

475
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,092
Still, it's meant to.

476
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:41,220
We're often stuck with the names
our enemies give to us.

477
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:45,141
The notion that we're all equal
in the eyes of the Seven

478
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:48,102
doesn't sit well with some,
so they belittle me.

479
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:51,356
-Seven blessings to you.
-Seven blessings to you, my dear.

480
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:55,693
It's only a name.
Quite an easy burden to bear.

481
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:58,029
Far easier than hers.

482
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:02,450
Why no shoes?

483
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:05,578
Because I gave them away to someone
who needed them more.

484
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,039
We all do that.

485
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:11,334
It stops us from forgetting
what we really are.

486
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:15,838
Is that why you came to King's Landing?
To remind everyone?

487
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:18,633
Everyone? Hard enough job
reminding myself.

488
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,594
Well, I tell them no one's special

489
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,930
and they think I'm special
for telling them so.

490
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:26,682
Perhaps they're right.

491
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:30,520
It would be comforting to believe that,
wouldn't it?

492
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:34,399
Have the gods sent you here
to tempt me?

493
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:37,151
I hope not.

494
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:42,573
I had assumed you'd only come here
to arrest me

495
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:45,243
for that incident with the High Septon.

496
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:47,954
An unacceptable way to treat
the chosen representative

497
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:49,705
of the gods in this world,
wouldn't you say?

498
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:55,378
Hypocrisy is a boil.
Lancing a boil is never pleasant.

499
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:59,090
Although they could have been more careful
with the blade.

500
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:02,718
The High Septon came to speak to me today.

501
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,515
He doesn't want me to arrest you.
He wants me to execute you.

502
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,729
I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts
on the matter.

503
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,652
My thoughts on the matter are in line
with your own.

504
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:24,240
The High Septon's behavior was corrosive,
as was his attitude.

505
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:27,743
Having a man like that reside in the sept
eats away at the faith from the inside.

506
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:32,248
So now he resides
in the Red Keep dungeons instead.

507
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,335
The faith and the crown
are the two pillars

508
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:37,712
that hold up this world.

509
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:39,547
One collapses, so does the other.

510
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:45,261
We must do everything necessary to protect
one another.

511
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:07,074
-Your Grace.
-Send a raven with this message

512
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:10,119
to Littlefinger at the Eyrie
or wherever he's slithering about.

513
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,665
At once, Your Grace.

514
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,294
-How's your work coming along?
-Very well.

515
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:22,256
-You've made progress?
-More than I expected.

516
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:26,385
-Still a way to go, but...
-Very good. I'll leave you to it, then.

517
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:31,098
Make sure Littlefinger is clear
on the meaning of the word "immediately."

518
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,119
Easy, friend.

519
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,144
She really is lovely.

520
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,816
-I hope I can make her happy.
-I hope so, too.

521
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:26,028
I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa
during our travels together.

522
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:28,197
She's suffered enough.

523
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:32,076
I'll never hurt her. You have my word.

524
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:36,664
I've heard very little about you,

525
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:40,543
which makes you quite a rare thing
as lords go.

526
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:43,796
I haven't been a lord very long.

527
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,425
-I was a bastard.
-And you're not anymore.

528
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,262
Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.

529
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:54,640
Yes, Father. And thank you, Lord Baelish.

530
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:56,767
I'm forever in your debt.

531
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:06,110
-He seems pleased.
-Shouldn't he be?

532
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:11,699
I assure you, she's still a virgin.
Tyrion never consummated the marriage.

533
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,118
By the law of the land,
she is no man's wife.

534
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:18,706
-Inspect her if you must.
-I'll leave that to the brothel keeper.

535
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,958
It's her name I need, not her virtue.

536
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:23,294
Then I have delivered everything
I promised.

537
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,380
And you're prepared for the consequences

538
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:29,592
when the Lannisters hear
I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay?

539
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,927
The Lannister name doesn't mean
what it once did.

540
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:33,554
Tywin is dead.

541
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,307
He kept his house in power
through sheer will.

542
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:40,311
Without him, Jaime has one hand
and no allies.

543
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:43,939
Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear.

544
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:49,028
-The queen will be enraged.
-Queen Margaery adores Sansa.

545
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:51,197
Cersei is Queen Mother,

546
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:54,116
a title whose importance wanes
with each passing day.

547
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:55,868
And yet she still has friends,

548
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,871
men in important places
whom she can ask for favors.

549
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:02,500
A message for you from Cersei Lannister.

550
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:06,504
A rider arrived from the Eyrie shortly
before dawn.

551
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:08,839
Apparently she thinks you're
still in the Vale.

552
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,384
A message for me, you say?

553
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,636
Strange that the seal is broken.

554
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:16,097
I'm sure you understand my position,
Lord Baelish.

555
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,974
If you receive word in the night
from the Queen Mother,

556
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:21,602
it does make me question our new alliance.

557
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,648
The Lannisters made you one
of the great lords of Westeros,

558
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:28,484
yet here you are in the North
undermining them.

559
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,070
Why gamble with your position?

560
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,657
Every ambitious move is a gamble.

561
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:38,411
You gambled when you drove a dagger
into Robb Stark's heart.

562
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:44,792
It appears that your gamble paid off.
You're Warden of the North.

563
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:49,046
I had Tywin Lannister's backing.
Who supports me now? You?

564
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,215
The Eyrie is mine.

565
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:53,884
The last time the lords of the Eyrie

566
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:55,845
formed an alliance
with the lords of the North,

567
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:59,473
they brought down the greatest dynasty
this world has ever known.

568
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:07,106
I'd like to borrow one of your birds.
Cersei will expect a reply.

569
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:09,692
I'd like to read the reply.

570
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:36,177
-I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
-Volantis is a large city.

571
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,304
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

572
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:41,766
The likelihood of you being spotted
here increases a hundredfold.

573
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:43,976
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

574
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:47,146
I'm not sure how many new ways I can find
of saying this.

575
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:54,278
I will not be of any use
to Daenerys Targaryen

576
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,405
if I lose my mind.

577
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:59,950
I can't remember the last face I saw
that wasn't yours.

578
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,202
It's a perfectly good face.

579
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,329
I am losing my mind.

580
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:05,623
If anyone recognizes you,
you'll lose more than that.

581
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:08,459
Look, we are thousands of miles
from Westeros.

582
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:12,755
What am I?

583
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,132
One more drunk dwarf.

584
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:18,219
Whoa!

585
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:48,290
We have to go now. Come on, hold it.
Hold it.

586
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:49,875
Are you ready?

587
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,337
Slaves.

588
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:57,341
Yes, the Volantene masters
are very organized.

589
00:52:58,551 --> 00:53:00,052
Flies for dung shovelers.

590
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:02,721
Hammers for builders.

591
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,432
Tears for whores.

592
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:07,560
Lest they forget.

593
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,409
We should keep moving.

594
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:41,844
The only red priest we had
in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr.

595
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:44,263
This one's much better-looking.

596
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:53,355
Stone Men.

597
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,984
Good luck stopping the spread of greyscale
with prayer.

598
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:59,737
You'd have better luck
dancing away the plague.

599
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,749
We're going to meet the savior.

600
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:15,210
You should have told me.
Who doesn't want to meet the savior?

601
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,478
Come on.

602
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:35,189
Let's find a brothel.

603
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:44,365
Build your house in a day!

604
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:02,299
It's even better luck to suck
a dwarf's cock.

605
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,014
See? We blend right in.

606
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:13,102
Just two more travelers mad with lust.

607
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:19,149
Thank you.

608
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:30,577
What curious hair.

609
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:33,706
The Mother of Dragons!

610
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:39,336
It appears you're not the only
Targaryen supporter.

611
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:44,133
-We were just heading east to see you.
-I've got a dragon for you.

612
00:55:44,717 --> 00:55:46,510
How much to make him spit fire?

613
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:54,977
Someone who inspires priests and whores
is worth taking seriously.

614
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,228
What makes you worth that much?

615
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,731
-I'm magic.
-I'll bet you bloody are.

616
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:04,069
Well, she's taken.

617
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:09,366
-Where are you going?
-I need to speak to someone with hair.

618
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:13,370
-Hello.
-Hello.

619
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:16,290
-You've got no drink.
-You've got no money.

620
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:18,500
Do I look like a man without money?

621
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:21,920
Never trust looks.

622
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:25,507
Until quite recently, I was one
of the richest men in the world.

623
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:30,179
Who needs wealth when you can make
a woman laugh?

624
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:36,477
I always pay my debts.
I'm well known for it.

625
00:56:41,774 --> 00:56:42,733
You like her.

626
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:45,277
They all like her.

627
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:49,156
-They all want to fuck a queen.
-That's because they've never met a queen.

628
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,324
You're just saying that.

629
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:52,034
You know how to spot a liar.

630
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:54,536
If I could pick any girl here,

631
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:56,789
I would pick you.

632
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,333
Why?

633
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,919
Because you have a skeptical mind.

634
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,927
All right, then. I'm warning you,
we're going to have to wash you first.

635
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,387
Come on.

636
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:22,689
I... I'm sorry, I can't.

637
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:27,361
Of course you can. You're shy.

638
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,238
I'm not.

639
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:34,701
-Have another drink.
-Gladly, but this I can't do.

640
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,412
Believe me, no one is more shocked
than I am.

641
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:39,623
I hope it passes.

642
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:42,918
What will I do in my spare time?

643
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,549
Go for a piss. That's a start.

644
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:13,365
No need to worry. I was just-- Oh,
I thought you were someone else.

645
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,076
Show's almost over.

646
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:19,371
I'm sure there are girls inside
who'd be happy to oblige.

647
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:22,416
You've made some kind of mistake.

648
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,543
Why don't you tell me what you think
you're doing and then--

649
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:28,338
I'm taking you to the queen.
