"Sonic the Hedgehog"
by ARJUKEN27

2
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,137
So I know what you think

3
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:16,043
Why is the hedgehog so handsome being chased?
by a madman with a mustache from the civil war

4
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:21,048
To be honest, it feels like I've run
all my life, is this too much

5
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:24,284
Am I too fast?
I do, you know what

6
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,310
let's step back

7
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:36,430
This is the island where I come from

8
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,367
That's all there, beach
sandy, terraced waterfalls

9
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,302
General access to loop de loop

10
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:48,375
And I don't need to catch a school bus, because of me
can run around the island in less than two seconds

11
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:52,813
Also no school, me
know, beautiful island right

12
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:58,279
Hey / I was born with outside power
usual, I was told to keep it a secret

13
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,287
And like other children, me
do the opposite

14
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,393
That's Long Claw, he takes care of me

15
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:10,330
He was consciously obiwan kenobi,
if Obiwan Kenobi has a beak

16
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,735
Sonic, someone can
saw you / Nobody saw me

17
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:18,263
I'm too fast, and me
want to bring you this3

18
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,303
Get down

19
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:30,517
Apparently with great power, followed
with criminals with great strength

20
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,315
And I guide them
right at us

21
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,835
Listen carefully Sonic

22
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,239
You have no strength like
whatever i've seen

23
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,275
And that means someone
will always want

24
00:02:55,275 --> 00:03:00,111
The only thing to stay safe
is to stay hidden

25
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:05,052
This world is at the end
far from the universe

26
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:08,789
You should be safe there / I'm not
Want to leave without you / You must

27
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:12,385
This ring will be your item
the most valuable

28
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,065
If you ever have
found, use one

29
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:21,001
Never stop running

30
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,060
Now leave

31
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,398
Long Claw

32
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,042
No

33
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,611
No

34
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:01,739
I have one car















35
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:41,214
Hey man! Where's the fire

36
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:43,421
There are kids living around here

37
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,652
That's kind of funny, sorry

38
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:54,630
What

39
00:05:33,176 --> 00:05:36,510
Tom, we need you on your way
Maine, there's a gang shot

40
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:41,651
Just kidding, ducks steal bagels

41
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:43,677
But they need help

42
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,691
Hi guys

43
00:05:55,798 --> 00:05:59,302
You almost got killed out here, what
You are some kind of adrenaline junkie

44
00:05:59,302 --> 00:06:01,470
It must be hard to be slow all the time

45
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,998
I'll tell you what, today
is your lucky day

46
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:11,440
Have you ever felt so alive

47
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:15,718
This is good, you're good

48
00:06:15,718 --> 00:06:17,220
Gosh

49
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,553
Good recovery

50
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:24,627
Let's make this
our little secret, okay

51
00:06:24,627 --> 00:06:26,095
You have never seen me

52
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:28,690
I've never been here

53
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:44,981
So what do you expect?
Small dirty hedgehog

54
00:06:44,981 --> 00:06:47,116
Eat berries struggling to survive

55
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:52,121
Think again, because I live
my best life on earth

56
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,714
I have a library

57
00:06:56,559 --> 00:07:00,394
And the most advanced security system

58
00:07:11,674 --> 00:07:12,698
Oh no

59
00:07:14,377 --> 00:07:17,580
And if I've ever been found, me
will follow the long claw instructions and

60
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,640
use my ring for
escape to a new planet

61
00:07:20,516 --> 00:07:24,578
The beautiful small world is safe
filled only with mushrooms

62
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:28,490
Disgusting and smelly mushrooms

63
00:07:30,092 --> 00:07:31,720
Mushroom

64
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:34,463
Let's not worry about it all

65
00:07:34,463 --> 00:07:37,333
This is Green Hills

66
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,427
The best place on earth



















67
00:08:10,702 --> 00:08:14,072
These are my people,
and I dare say

68
00:08:14,072 --> 00:08:16,541
I am a creature
their favorite sky

69
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:19,170
Then what if they are
didn't know i existed

70
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:23,581
My favorite person is Lord Donuts

71
00:08:23,581 --> 00:08:25,709
Protector of this city

72
00:08:26,384 --> 00:08:30,755
And defenders of all large creatures
and small / good morning

73
00:08:30,755 --> 00:08:32,691
Hello Daisy Dapne

74
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:36,253
Lord Donuts lives with Pretzely

75
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:41,264
He is super good with animals, and
strangely born without a bulge

76
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:43,601
Ouch, ouch, ouch

77
00:08:43,601 --> 00:08:46,969
There is one person who doesn't like me

78
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:51,109
I think it's because of the blue devil / me
almost caught him last night

79
00:08:51,109 --> 00:08:54,273
Say hello to Crazy Carl

80
00:08:56,348 --> 00:08:58,078
We are happy to be together

81
00:08:59,651 --> 00:09:02,120
I know you're out there!

82
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,023
I know you are real!

83
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,549
No, I'm not!

84
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:09,995
The night's stay is my favorite

85
00:09:09,995 --> 00:09:11,520
Please, please, please

86
00:09:12,063 --> 00:09:13,999
Yes, Keanu

87
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:18,003
You were a national treasure when I found it
yourself / Oh, stop the champ

88
00:09:18,003 --> 00:09:23,008
There is a bomb on the bus / Sudden Quiz
hotshot, classic sentence

89
00:09:23,008 --> 00:09:25,705
Basically we are like family

90
00:09:26,111 --> 00:09:27,979
Although we have not met

91
00:09:27,979 --> 00:09:32,517
You don't think of your isolation
make you a little crazy

92
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:37,421
Crazy I No, you're wrong

93
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:41,526
And rule out whose name
'' friend '', deep inside

94
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:43,628
You're still a bit lonely

95
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:52,227
Maybe afraid you will
alone forever

96
00:10:07,352 --> 00:10:08,686
Hey

97
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:10,245
No, no

98
00:10:10,588 --> 00:10:13,258
Down there, come on, come on

99
00:10:13,258 --> 00:10:18,219
Get out of there, get out
from there you are an intruder

100
00:10:18,496 --> 00:10:21,366
Betty as a veterinarian
most respected on green hill

101
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:23,961
What is the fastest way to
destroy raccoons

102
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:30,100
What is that

103
00:10:30,642 --> 00:10:33,373
What is like that
I think / Uh-huh, okay

104
00:10:34,412 --> 00:10:38,372
That's rather small, is that bad? Just open it

105
00:10:43,721 --> 00:10:47,559
Dear Thomas, we have reviewed
your proposal to the San Francisco Police Department

106
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:50,427
And after the review and
background check

107
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:53,565
We are happy to tell you, you have
selected to join our team

108
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:55,261
Oh god / Wow

109
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,370
Oh god / bye

110
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,633
Sanfransisco sucks

111
00:11:03,174 --> 00:11:04,540
False

112
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:09,104
Cistern

113
00:11:09,514 --> 00:11:12,279
You never have doubts, yes / No.

114
00:11:14,652 --> 00:11:17,689
I don't believe this / You did it

115
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:20,284
What is that

116
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:24,289
Apartments for rent,
I found it on zilla

117
00:11:24,662 --> 00:11:29,293
I think Ozzy and I can fly there
tomorrow and look at the surroundings

118
00:11:30,435 --> 00:11:32,427
This happened that fast

119
00:11:32,837 --> 00:11:38,343
Ah, that's the craziest thing, you applied
the work, you get the work

120
00:11:38,343 --> 00:11:40,645
Background check
pending back

121
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:44,309
Don't think I don't know the time
you use neighbor's wifi

122
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:47,218
Correction, I still use the wifi

123
00:11:47,218 --> 00:11:50,388
Are you sure it's okay with this

124
00:11:50,388 --> 00:11:52,118
Tell Mr. Wachowski

125
00:11:52,357 --> 00:11:54,559
What do you do all the time
I'm in veterinary school

126
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,553
I'm doing a second job to pay
rent and / Jobs to pay spp

127
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,660
You sacrifice for me, me
happy to sacrifice for you

128
00:12:04,102 --> 00:12:06,662
Beib, you sure you're okay with this

129
00:12:07,472 --> 00:12:11,671
I mean there's Wachowski protecting
this city more than 50 years

130
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,638
This is a big change

131
00:12:15,146 --> 00:12:17,411
I'm positive

132
00:12:17,815 --> 00:12:20,011
Time for this person to come out
and prove himself

133
00:12:20,251 --> 00:12:24,188
I like greenhouses, but you know
I want to help you with a problem

134
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:29,185
Someone will need me in a life situation
or die and I will be there for him

135
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:32,830
I understand, I'm very proud of you

136
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,629
Thank you

137
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:40,630
So with a heavy heart I tell you I have
accept a position in the San Francisco police department

00:12:43,107 --> 00:12:46,566
This will be hard for the city
my hometown, and all my friends

140
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:51,442
But this is something that I am
think I need, to grow

141
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,779
As an officer

142
00:12:54,152 --> 00:12:55,518
And a man

143
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:00,053
What do you think, pretty cool

144
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:02,158
Not so bad, right

145
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:05,423
All I have to do is

146
00:13:06,397 --> 00:13:08,127
Tell everyone who needs donuts

147
00:13:10,235 --> 00:13:12,761
Wow, the match

148
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:58,511
Very cool

149
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:05,554
Tonight's score and draw

00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:11,396
And from pitcher pitcher
the most terrible

152
00:14:11,396 --> 00:14:14,525
softball ball on Green hill, also sonic

153
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:19,526
If you win this match you will
will be the most player in green hills

154
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:27,475
Hit to the left, he's really bad

155
00:14:30,048 --> 00:14:31,816
Oh, I can not

156
00:14:31,816 --> 00:14:35,719
Come on sonic

157
00:14:46,331 --> 00:14:47,731
I did not get it

158
00:14:56,174 --> 00:14:58,176
Wait

159
00:14:58,176 --> 00:14:59,735
Come on

160
00:15:05,183 --> 00:15:07,084
Secure

161
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:11,155
Oh yes, yes, yes, I did it

162
00:15:11,155 --> 00:15:12,748
You see that, I've done it

163
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,583
I did it

164
00:15:26,671 --> 00:15:28,606
I really am alone

165
00:15:29,273 --> 00:15:31,469
Alone, forever

166
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:09,003
I'm sure nobody noticed
that giant blue explosion, right?

167
00:16:19,123 --> 00:16:24,462
Hi Wade / Hi Tom, wade
here, what happened

168
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:29,467
I think the electricity is off / Electric
extinguished, the whole city panicked

169
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:32,770
What should I do / Okay,
calm down, take a deep breath

170
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:36,036
Call Gill, see if he can
find a channel that goes out and

171
00:16:36,307 --> 00:16:40,077
Call Jen to see if she can
bring the generator to the station

172
00:16:40,077 --> 00:16:44,412
Call Tim before Gill

173
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:48,611
Call the team / I will
call you back

174
00:16:50,354 --> 00:16:53,518
Okay, fine, you can take care of this

175
00:16:54,091 --> 00:16:57,653
What is the first thing he is
say to do

176
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:01,966
Right, calm down

177
00:17:19,784 --> 00:17:21,582
40 minutes ago

178
00:17:21,786 --> 00:17:25,623
The surge of energy turns off electricity
throughout the Pacific Northwest

179
00:17:25,623 --> 00:17:29,427
What do we know / guess
our first is EMP

180
00:17:29,427 --> 00:17:32,296
But electromagnetic waves
has no power like that

181
00:17:32,296 --> 00:17:34,765
Nasa has ruled out attacks
meteor or solar incandescent

182
00:17:34,765 --> 00:17:37,564
The energy department says it's not
power plant malfunctions

183
00:17:37,635 --> 00:17:40,238
Sounds very good to us
in knowing what that is

184
00:17:40,238 --> 00:17:45,643
That could be the beginning of a bigger attack, I think
we have to send regiments 5 and 6 / No, no

185
00:17:46,043 --> 00:17:48,513
This requires a more complicated mind

186
00:17:48,513 --> 00:17:53,042
Someone who understands technology / We send
lab rat / Not lab rat carelessly

187
00:17:53,317 --> 00:17:54,685
Lab rats with teeth

188
00:17:54,685 --> 00:17:59,223
You're not suggesting who I think you are
suggest / I know he's a little weird / Strange / No.

189
00:17:59,223 --> 00:18:02,393
He is horribly terrible
psychology / But he's also brilliant

190
00:18:02,393 --> 00:18:05,429
5 Phd, and lQ cross the line and

191
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:09,161
he's revolutionary drone technology / You
sure he can overcome this

192
00:18:09,267 --> 00:18:11,168
He has a record of perfect surgery

193
00:18:11,168 --> 00:18:13,137
Remember the coup in Pakistan / No.

194
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:17,041
Or the algabanistan / lt's rebellion
not even country / Exactly

195
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,101
And you can be grateful
on Robotnik for that

196
00:18:19,176 --> 00:18:25,013
I can't believe you brought that madman
in this case / I don't either, but

197
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,317
We have no choice

198
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:17,068
Are you in charge?
here / Yes, I do / Not

199
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:19,264
False I am the authority

200
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:22,302
His name / Major

201
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:28,009
You never say
this before, this is top

202
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:30,581
The world is full of hungry little monkeys

203
00:19:30,581 --> 00:19:33,484
I will clarify it

204
00:19:33,484 --> 00:19:38,122
-

205
00:19:38,122 --> 00:19:40,557
Agent Stone / Doctor says you're basic

206
00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:43,127
I run the sweeping order

207
00:19:43,127 --> 00:19:45,289
10 miles in all directions,
that should be enough

208
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,999
He still sees me funny

209
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:52,703
Yes / Tell him to stop, or I'll check
its history / If you don't stop seeing a doctor

210
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,804
I'm not deaf

211
00:19:53,804 --> 00:19:57,332
And tell him to
report to me, blah blah blah

212
00:19:57,408 --> 00:20:01,479
Excuse me, listen bro, I don't know what
You realize / I'm sorry, major, what's your name

213
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:03,448
Bennin / Nobody cares

214
00:20:04,015 --> 00:20:06,350
Nobody cares, listen

215
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,514
Major, nobody cares,
nobody cares who you are

216
00:20:10,054 --> 00:20:12,523
Because no one cares
with your poor achievements

217
00:20:12,523 --> 00:20:17,723
And no matter how much
proud of your mama, now you're level 3

218
00:20:18,496 --> 00:20:22,266
You have completed Charlotte's web
spoiler warning, he died in the end

219
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:24,929
This is very scary

220
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:29,073
Ah, my children

221
00:20:29,073 --> 00:20:31,406
See what comes out
from my egg bag

222
00:20:32,109 --> 00:20:34,271
You know what I like about machines

223
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:38,349
They do as they are told,
they follow their program

224
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:42,420
They don't need time off
to get drunk with friends

225
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,355
You do as you are told

226
00:20:44,355 --> 00:20:47,692
Stand there, at the end
your personal hole

227
00:20:47,692 --> 00:20:50,628
and watch my machine do your work

228
00:20:52,596 --> 00:20:53,962
You can feel Stone

229
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:55,332
I can feel it doctor

230
00:20:55,332 --> 00:20:57,358
This is evolution

231
00:20:58,335 --> 00:21:00,031
This is evolution

232
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:36,630
Stone agent / doctor

233
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:39,669
You see something
useful in this picture

234
00:21:40,344 --> 00:21:41,812
There is no doctor at all

235
00:21:41,812 --> 00:21:47,046
Of course you don't, your eyes are trained to
find traces of native american wolf shadows

236
00:21:57,294 --> 00:21:59,463
That's amazing / No.

237
00:21:59,463 --> 00:22:01,165
What is extraordinary is

238
00:22:01,165 --> 00:22:03,134
I determine the exact weight

239
00:22:03,134 --> 00:22:05,069
From this creature

240
00:22:05,069 --> 00:22:08,205
And my computer could not find
any match anywhere

241
00:22:08,205 --> 00:22:10,107
In the animal kingdom of the earth

242
00:22:10,107 --> 00:22:15,068
This power outage is not an attack
terrorist and that's not a big foot baby

243
00:22:15,446 --> 00:22:19,247
This person, this is something else

244
00:22:20,084 --> 00:22:21,484
Fully

245
00:22:22,186 --> 00:22:24,382
Switch the search unit to the footprint

246
00:22:25,523 --> 00:22:27,685
That's a small step for humans

247
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:30,351
One big jump for me

248
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:43,474
OK, OK, everything's fine

249
00:22:43,474 --> 00:22:48,479
You play baseball, get a little angry, thunder
shot your ass, and now they come for you

250
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:51,448
Fine, fine, the earth is no longer safe

251
00:22:51,448 --> 00:22:53,551
It's time for plan B, the mushroom world

252
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:56,320
I have to bring my stuff.
okay, just important stuff,

253
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,623
OK, toothbrush, toothpaste,
hair gel, cute hat

254
00:22:59,623 --> 00:23:02,660
This catalog

255
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,195
My entire comic collection

256
00:23:04,195 --> 00:23:08,399
Leave the backpack
No, of course not, that's stupid

257
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:10,367
OK, what else

258
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:12,393
The ring, of course

259
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,472
Here it is, its time,
mushroom planet, here I come

260
00:23:17,174 --> 00:23:20,406
Oh no, they are outside,
I have to go somewhere else

261
00:23:30,688 --> 00:23:33,283
Hi / Hey / What are you doing

262
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:38,158
Coloring with Jojo and Rachel / Oh,
that sounds fun

263
00:23:38,295 --> 00:23:40,230
There is something interesting here,
we have a power cut

264
00:23:40,598 --> 00:23:42,233
The whole city is darkened

265
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:46,637
His behavior is like a sign to me, tell me
I have to get out of here / Wade must be crazy / Yes

266
00:23:46,637 --> 00:23:48,731
He doesn't have much to lose

267
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,609
How is your sister She already
convince you to leave me /

268
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:54,845
No, but he told me to check
your phone for a dating application

269
00:23:54,845 --> 00:23:57,314
Stupid Apps on my phone

270
00:23:57,715 --> 00:24:00,708
Because you're there / You're family

271
00:24:03,354 --> 00:24:05,380
Impossible

272
00:24:07,324 --> 00:24:08,659
The raccoon is back

273
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:12,630
They are ready for a surprise / You're surprised,
it shouldn't be a tranquilizer gun

274
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:16,499
They are just hungry, and
also not for bears

275
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:21,497
Good, I know / Tom / I'm kidding, me
will only use it to scare him

276
00:24:21,705 --> 00:24:25,142
Maybe to death,
okay baby, bye / Tom

277
00:24:34,351 --> 00:24:37,515
I entered, with minimum damage

278
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:41,325
Here it is, it doesn't work
on earth, never mind

279
00:24:41,325 --> 00:24:48,129
You will safe world, safe world filled with
mushrooms, mushrooms that will be your only friend

280
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,501
That sounds bad, me
can't do this

281
00:24:50,501 --> 00:24:52,265
You have to do this,
There are no other options

282
00:24:54,338 --> 00:24:56,440
Well

283
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,243
SFPD! Background check!

284
00:24:59,243 --> 00:25:00,541
Paws in the air

285
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,039
Miaw

286
00:25:13,123 --> 00:25:14,358
San

287
00:25:14,358 --> 00:25:16,520
Fransico

288
00:25:43,754 --> 00:25:44,722
What

289
00:26:07,378 --> 00:26:08,607
Blue Devil

290
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:23,651
Donut Lord / You can talk

291
00:26:24,461 --> 00:26:25,394
You do not

292
00:26:25,696 --> 00:26:28,723
You're not here to
kidnapped me, right? You kidnapped me

293
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,436
Okay, that's a fair point, what are you

294
00:26:32,436 --> 00:26:35,472
Why are you hiding in my garage / me
need somewhere safe

295
00:26:35,472 --> 00:26:40,672
And you're the only person I can think of, donut lord / Why
You keep calling me donut lord / Because you talk to donuts

296
00:26:40,778 --> 00:26:42,646
I need that to get out

297
00:26:42,646 --> 00:26:45,282
Fair / Wait, where are all the mushrooms

298
00:26:45,282 --> 00:26:47,718
Why am I still on earth

299
00:26:47,718 --> 00:26:50,620
No, I lost my ring / What

300
00:26:58,095 --> 00:26:59,563
Is this your aircraft carrier

301
00:27:00,197 --> 00:27:04,066
Not in the mood for that / You think
I see, I don't even wear pants

302
00:27:11,308 --> 00:27:14,011
They are coming for me / Who is coming
for you, what does that have to do with me

303
00:27:14,011 --> 00:27:17,004
I don't have time to explain, but
You have to help me / No, I don't

304
00:27:17,347 --> 00:27:22,653
Why / My legs are normally classified
as a deadly weapon, it feels like spaghetti

305
00:27:22,653 --> 00:27:24,455
I need your help, please

306
00:27:24,455 --> 00:27:26,549
This is life or death

307
00:27:32,629 --> 00:27:34,621
Okay, come with me

308
00:27:37,534 --> 00:27:39,400
Uh, hello

309
00:27:50,647 --> 00:27:53,817
Fine, stay here, and don't
noisy / Good plan, great plan

310
00:27:53,817 --> 00:27:56,685
We have worked well together, practically
finish each other's sentences

311
00:27:58,989 --> 00:28:01,083
I hope you are right

312
00:28:03,427 --> 00:28:04,395
Hello there

I can help

00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:12,302
Good morning my friend

I'm from the electricity company.
investigating blackouts

316
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,210
If you don't mind, I want to
take some reading at your house

317
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,012
That's right, you're from the electricity company

318
00:28:22,012 --> 00:28:26,211
You must know my friend Spencer,
we play softball together / Spens

319
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,218
He's a good guy

320
00:28:29,052 --> 00:28:31,622
Yes, yes, please come in / OK

321
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:34,758
Take all the readings
you need, except

322
00:28:34,758 --> 00:28:38,028
Electricity company took
reading from outside the house

323
00:28:38,028 --> 00:28:40,122
They can check it

324
00:28:40,764 --> 00:28:43,267
Also my friend Spencer works
for gas companies

325
00:28:43,267 --> 00:28:46,470
Prefer fressbee, so
You want to tell me why

326
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:49,463
You think I'm stupid enough to
let you into my house

327
00:28:57,281 --> 00:28:59,750
Sorry, Mr. Wachowski

328
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,412
You better call me Tom

329
00:29:01,718 --> 00:29:03,754
Unless my dentist calls me Tim

330
00:29:03,754 --> 00:29:06,523
He called me that long ago,
it would be strange if I corrected him

331
00:29:06,523 --> 00:29:09,326
Tom, the dentist called Tim

332
00:29:09,326 --> 00:29:12,129
You probably know this whole city has

333
00:29:12,129 --> 00:29:13,497
experienced a power outage

334
00:29:13,497 --> 00:29:15,465
Yep, there's no light, I know that

335
00:29:15,465 --> 00:29:19,994
20 minutes ago, I tracked the anti-pulse, with
a similar sign that caused the damage

336
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:37,588
Listen, uh, sir. Doctor

337
00:29:37,588 --> 00:29:39,216
Robotics doctor

338
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,181
But my dad calls me Rob

339
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,395
Listen from Robotnik

340
00:29:45,395 --> 00:29:49,032
I'm sure this is very serious, but

341
00:29:49,032 --> 00:29:51,024
has nothing to do with me, you
can ask everyone in the city

342
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:54,433
Everyone knows me / I know

343
00:30:05,983 --> 00:30:08,652
Maybe one day you
will achieve your goal

344
00:30:08,652 --> 00:30:11,355
get the card

345
00:30:11,355 --> 00:30:12,689
But the truth is

346
00:30:12,689 --> 00:30:17,184
I passed everything you would do

347
00:30:18,629 --> 00:30:20,664
before I was a toddler

348
00:30:20,664 --> 00:30:24,334
I made a formula while you
still spewing formula milk

349
00:30:24,334 --> 00:30:27,004
I was breastfed actually / Good

350
00:30:27,004 --> 00:30:28,973
Rub it on the face of my orphan

351
00:30:29,306 --> 00:30:31,608
Mr. Wachowski, are you familiar

352
00:30:31,608 --> 00:30:35,477
with US code 904 title 10 article 104

353
00:30:36,246 --> 00:30:37,447
No / Whoever

354
00:30:37,447 --> 00:30:41,282
Anyone who tries to help the enemy
The United States will suffer

355
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:44,451
And I will catch you

356
00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:47,190
And that will be worse

357
00:30:48,358 --> 00:30:50,020
Worse than death

358
00:30:52,629 --> 00:30:56,099
I'm a ball, just a normal ball,
blending with other balls

359
00:30:56,099 --> 00:30:58,261
Shut up sonic / You're the shut up Sonic

360
00:30:59,136 --> 00:31:03,130
I hope they don't scan me with
xray, I have a shameful lunch

361
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:15,214
Don't be afraid

362
00:31:16,553 --> 00:31:18,579
Over here

363
00:31:20,357 --> 00:31:23,691
Why don't you use the carpet

364
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,498
Yes

365
00:31:28,498 --> 00:31:31,127
Maybe just the ceiling of the house,
nothing can be seen here

366
00:31:39,076 --> 00:31:40,203
This is the problem

367
00:31:41,812 --> 00:31:43,440
I was never wrong

368
00:31:44,114 --> 00:31:46,481
Uh, there's first time
for everything i guess

369
00:31:46,616 --> 00:31:51,486
I think raccoons have the cleanest mouths
of all animals that eat rubbish

370
00:32:03,133 --> 00:32:04,431
look at that

371
00:32:05,402 --> 00:32:06,700
I am right

372
00:32:07,337 --> 00:32:09,473
Not surprised

373
00:32:09,473 --> 00:32:11,305
We try this again

374
00:32:21,618 --> 00:32:23,553
I'll give you five

375
00:32:23,553 --> 00:32:26,250
seconds to tell
where am I Lima?

376
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:29,326
What are you talking about / Four / Hey
champ, I'm a cop

377
00:32:29,326 --> 00:32:31,989
You threaten the officer / How are you
threatening someone who never existed

378
00:32:32,162 --> 00:32:33,630
Three

379
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,565
Come on, use your brain

380
00:32:35,565 --> 00:32:39,102
You might find it
poor excuse to continue living

381
00:32:39,102 --> 00:32:43,673
And two, one! Wait!

382
00:32:43,673 --> 00:32:47,075
Don't hurt him

383
00:32:57,654 --> 00:33:00,123
This feels excessive

384
00:33:03,126 --> 00:33:04,094
Still behind me

385
00:33:20,377 --> 00:33:22,573
Do not worry, I get
He is exactly where I want him

386
00:33:25,282 --> 00:33:28,514
You can trust we will
deliver the package with this thing

387
00:33:30,654 --> 00:33:33,783
This is a plan
bad, what am I thinking

388
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,635
We gotta get out of here / Oh
don't tell me that

389
00:33:45,635 --> 00:33:50,300
That's all you have, I'm just getting started

390
00:34:08,124 --> 00:34:10,059
Doctor

391
00:34:10,327 --> 00:34:12,162
Are you OK? Yes

392
00:34:12,162 --> 00:34:15,189
I saw a man run out of
Here, I think / You have to stop them

393
00:34:16,466 --> 00:34:18,235
Open your mouth

394
00:34:18,235 --> 00:34:20,337
and say you think you are
must stop them

395
00:34:20,337 --> 00:34:23,773
No, I think maybe I should
check see you're fine

396
00:34:23,773 --> 00:34:28,778
You know what it's hard to be
the smartest person in the world

397
00:34:28,778 --> 00:34:32,237
Good, you got it

398
00:34:32,482 --> 00:34:36,686
Whatever the creature is, that's a task
us to secure it

399
00:34:36,686 --> 00:34:40,145
Neutralize it, find
the source of his strength

400
00:34:40,457 --> 00:34:42,492
And if it's against

401
00:34:42,492 --> 00:34:46,190
We destroy, piece by piece

402
00:34:47,163 --> 00:34:49,394
See what makes it tick

403
00:34:50,534 --> 00:34:53,770
Doctor, optical telephone

404
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:56,205
Tell me I need a new frame

405
00:34:56,439 --> 00:34:58,067
They know what that is

406
00:34:58,542 --> 00:34:59,643
Oh

407
00:34:59,643 --> 00:35:01,703
Bring the porcupine thorn

408
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:08,218
Alright guys

409
00:35:08,218 --> 00:35:10,551
You have to talk now, who are you

410
00:35:11,254 --> 00:35:14,791
What are you / I hedgehog, I guess that's clear

411
00:35:14,791 --> 00:35:16,359
And I'm in big trouble

412
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:20,397
You're in big trouble, you don't hit
Government freaks behind there

413
00:35:20,397 --> 00:35:25,068
You think your problem, I lost
My ring / Ring, what are you talking about / Okay

414
00:35:25,068 --> 00:35:28,371
The ring is how all civilization
sophisticated international travel

415
00:35:28,371 --> 00:35:30,340
And mine above

416
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:33,674
the sharp one that's only me
look in your tight shirts

417
00:35:34,177 --> 00:35:36,713
So I want you to take me
to San Francisco for me

418
00:35:36,713 --> 00:35:39,615
can get my ring back
and go to the planet mushroom

419
00:35:41,284 --> 00:35:43,253
Mushroom Planet / Yes

420
00:35:43,687 --> 00:35:45,280
Right

421
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:51,695
Okay buddy, come out / Sorry, what

422
00:35:51,695 --> 00:35:55,498
Listen, this is the worst time
got me in trouble okay

423
00:35:55,498 --> 00:35:57,467
You want me to save
you, I saved you

424
00:35:57,467 --> 00:36:01,071
Now please, go search
your ring, and your mushroom soil

425
00:36:01,071 --> 00:36:02,772
I hope I will wake up
on a hospital bed

426
00:36:02,772 --> 00:36:06,300
And the doctor will tell me, my surgery
was a big success, so goodbye

427
00:36:06,576 --> 00:36:09,205
Okay, bye / bye

428
00:36:12,515 --> 00:36:15,752
Why don't you go / I don't
know where Sanfransisco is / West

429
00:36:15,752 --> 00:36:18,588
West / Straight, you can't
miss it / Good, that's cool

430
00:36:18,588 --> 00:36:22,218
I'm really cool to say
bye now

431
00:36:25,428 --> 00:36:29,666
So, when I fell
in Pacific cold water

432
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:30,964
I realized a few things

433
00:36:31,768 --> 00:36:34,204
I don't know where I'm going

434
00:36:34,204 --> 00:36:36,706
B salt water smell

435
00:36:36,706 --> 00:36:41,711
C I shouldn't be on this planet
now, but I am there, why

436
00:36:41,711 --> 00:36:43,713
Because you shot me / I know

437
00:36:43,713 --> 00:36:45,215
You shoot me

438
00:36:45,215 --> 00:36:47,241
I heard you first

439
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:50,787
Just pile / I'm wet

440
00:36:50,787 --> 00:36:54,057
I'm cold there is a fish in my head

441
00:36:54,057 --> 00:36:57,585
And obviously I can't
do this alone

442
00:37:03,633 --> 00:37:06,403
Really you will help
Me / Get in the truck

443
00:37:06,403 --> 00:37:11,007
I think it's my fault, this happened
/ Not all of you

444
00:37:11,007 --> 00:37:14,244
That's all your fault / What

445
00:37:14,244 --> 00:37:16,008
Yes

446
00:37:16,346 --> 00:37:19,942
Travel

447
00:37:20,417 --> 00:37:22,249
What do I do

448
00:37:22,585 --> 00:37:27,250
Well, there will be rules on this trip, number
one do as I say every time

449
00:37:27,691 --> 00:37:31,528
Ready / Please stop it
with mister donut

450
00:37:31,528 --> 00:37:33,596
I have the name Tom

451
00:37:33,596 --> 00:37:37,692
I'm Sonic / Sonic

452
00:37:38,735 --> 00:37:42,739
So you spy on us for years
don't say it's a spy

453
00:37:42,739 --> 00:37:45,408
We just hang out
only I was not invited

454
00:37:45,408 --> 00:37:49,713
And nobody knew I was there / Me
Can not believe, there is every moment

455
00:37:49,713 --> 00:37:52,615
You should be called super observation

456
00:37:52,615 --> 00:37:55,385
Come back and stop it
the car now / what

457
00:37:55,385 --> 00:37:59,222
The biggest rubber ball in the world,
we have to see it / No.

458
00:37:59,222 --> 00:38:02,283
No, this is not a trip
that's fun okay

459
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:07,197
The government must be your digest,
and catch me, this is serious

460
00:38:07,197 --> 00:38:11,567
You're right, that's bad
cool / I got your stuff

461
00:38:12,135 --> 00:38:15,503
How do we get there?
there, when you arrive

462
00:38:34,991 --> 00:38:37,527
Check what happened

463
00:38:37,527 --> 00:38:41,760
You will see Wade with a glass object
that, what is that, teleportation box

464
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:46,503
This is a paid telephone

465
00:38:46,503 --> 00:38:48,571
Just do this, just us

466
00:38:48,571 --> 00:38:50,699
Stay in the car, no
anyone saw you

467
00:38:51,274 --> 00:38:52,298
Well

468
00:39:10,693 --> 00:39:13,696
Okay, this is the coolest place in the world

469
00:39:13,696 --> 00:39:15,324
You have to stay there

470
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,239
Remain strong

471
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,219
Hello

472
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:39,722
Wayne it's me / hi

473
00:39:39,722 --> 00:39:44,160
Someone asked a question
to me, a little scary

474
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,563
Like remind me of Man In Black

475
00:39:46,563 --> 00:39:49,732
But not handsome

476
00:39:49,732 --> 00:39:51,301
What kind of question is that

477
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:52,667
Question about

478
00:39:53,069 --> 00:39:55,903
Terrorist / I told him

479
00:39:56,072 --> 00:40:00,643
He doesn't know to make a bomb

480
00:40:00,643 --> 00:40:05,604
Wait, listen, this is very important, don't
tell anyone we talk okay

481
00:40:08,551 --> 00:40:11,350
I guess he already knows

482
00:40:11,721 --> 00:40:16,091
Mr. Korosky

483
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:20,330
I want you to know, people
hit my face

484
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,764
Son

485
00:40:21,764 --> 00:40:25,568
He beat me at the cafe for small wounds

486
00:40:25,568 --> 00:40:30,939
Embarrassing me, in front of the school,
and you know what I'm responding to

487
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,344
I assume you reported to the officer

488
00:40:34,344 --> 00:40:36,579
You know that's unacceptable

489
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:40,183
I tested world efficiency

490
00:40:40,183 --> 00:40:42,452
Use technology for
solve inefficient efficiency

491
00:40:42,452 --> 00:40:44,754
That's a straw for a year

492
00:40:44,754 --> 00:40:47,622
And I never tried again

493
00:40:47,991 --> 00:40:49,058
To this day

494
00:40:49,058 --> 00:40:53,120
Hey / No you're going to be bullied

495
00:40:53,529 --> 00:40:58,167

00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:00,966
Hello / hello

499
00:41:08,044 --> 00:41:11,281
Wait / No

500
00:41:11,281 --> 00:41:15,048
You just sit there / don't bother

501
00:41:15,585 --> 00:41:17,019
Less

502
00:41:24,127 --> 00:41:26,722
Nobody erases my memory here

503
00:41:27,397 --> 00:41:30,231
I won't talk to people like that

504
00:41:32,669 --> 00:41:36,128
This clearly helps you

505
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:38,435
Sonic

Sonic

There are a lot of things that me
never do

530
00:43:26,115 --> 00:43:28,675
I will not be forever

531
00:43:29,052 --> 00:43:31,112
I just missed my chance

532
00:43:36,426 --> 00:43:38,261
I think this is the place

00:43:38,261 --> 00:43:41,564
You live in a short dream

You were just about to fight with
hedgehogs disguised badly

Do you see a lot
that, close to the toilet

570
00:48:46,302 --> 00:48:49,805
The floor is very tight

571
00:48:49,805 --> 00:48:53,008
There is no stopping

572
00:48:53,008 --> 00:48:56,240
Rub my list

And you can do it in this room

579

Come on

That's how bad you eat

582
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:42,751
Spicy hot dogs

583
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:46,188

No, don't ever do that again

590
00:50:04,647 --> 00:50:06,275
I like it

591
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:09,541
I messed this place up

592
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:14,256
I know we have to go, the earth will
safer / But what if wrong

593
00:50:15,057 --> 00:50:16,992
Maybe I can have a life here

594
00:50:21,597 --> 00:50:24,032
Hey / You have to sleep

595

accused of domestic terrorism

600
00:51:32,072 --> 00:51:35,008
Wachowski is dangerous

601
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:37,307
And there is information about him

602
00:51:46,086 --> 00:51:47,645
What did he say where he went

603
00:51:50,557 --> 00:51:52,225
Maybe

604
00:51:52,225 --> 00:51:56,253
Maybe not, as you say

605
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:58,732
Sit agent

Yes

608

That's what I call it
good and bad cops

609
00:52:15,248 --> 00:52:18,116
Cheer yourself up

610
00:52:19,319 --> 00:52:21,755
Rate it approx

611
00:52:21,755 --> 00:52:25,592
Fasten the vehicle / Local weather

612
00:52:25,592 --> 00:52:27,494
This should be it

613
00:52:27,494 --> 00:52:30,330
Still in

So what's on your bucket list / me

Yes everyone has a bucket list right / Yes

619
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,546
You who left earth and

620
00:52:46,546 --> 00:52:48,214
Not clear

621
00:52:48,214 --> 00:52:49,749
Oh don't be sure

622
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:54,754
Your best friend is a magnet for danger

623
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:58,525
I mean / I like you

624
00:52:58,525 --> 00:53:01,561
Of course, but we are not best friends

625
00:53:01,561 --> 00:53:03,330
You put me in last night

626
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:07,767
Okay, that's animal friend. Okay

627
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:10,770
Embarrassing conversation topic

00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:15,037
Bucket list gives
Okay / here's the thing

629
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:18,078
I always feel

630
00:53:18,078 --> 00:53:20,809
I don't know, like a nanny
than the original police

631
00:53:21,481 --> 00:53:23,483
So I will prove it to myself

632
00:53:23,483 --> 00:53:27,250
At high pressure, move to san
Francis became a street cop

633
00:53:27,687 --> 00:53:30,555
And, why not, look

Okay / But why

Why did you leave Greenhills

637
00:53:42,035 --> 00:53:46,172
You must understand
small town greenhills

638
00:53:46,172 --> 00:53:50,243
Not small, there are hundreds
people / it's a small town dude

639
00:53:50,243 --> 00:53:53,079
It's a perfect city and people need you

640
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:58,084
Help me clean, and can call
someone else to do that

641
00:53:58,084 --> 00:54:00,253
Of course they can call
anyone but they don't

642
00:54:00,253 --> 00:54:02,017
They call you

643
00:54:18,405 --> 00:54:21,239
Cup chip stamp

644
00:54:21,808 --> 00:54:24,607
Mayhem

645
00:54:34,054 --> 00:54:37,490
You don't make sense / you come

646
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:40,756
People about me / Zeroman
will kill you

647
00:54:42,462 --> 00:54:45,565
What is more important

648
00:54:45,565 --> 00:54:48,000
Tell the people you care about

649
00:54:54,174 --> 00:54:56,109
I am indeed

650
00:55:05,618 --> 00:55:07,353
You know what, I'm wrong about you

651
00:55:07,353 --> 00:55:10,090
Not saying, you are more like

00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:13,151
stop it

653
00:55:18,832 --> 00:55:22,168
I was forced

654
00:55:22,168 --> 00:55:25,472
Hey, this is perfect and you
leave / Why did you do that

655
00:55:25,472 --> 00:55:30,310
Okay / wait, don't wait

Sonic

659
00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:00,230
This is lucky

660
00:56:02,175 --> 00:56:06,746
Yes dear, Sonic is running

661
00:56:06,746 --> 00:56:10,083
Sorry

662
00:56:10,083 --> 00:56:13,753
Don't know see you dance / Yes you dance

663
00:56:13,753 --> 00:56:17,383
That's all you have / Wow
thanks for asking

664
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,628
Sonic

665
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:26,225
You come / I'll go

666
00:56:35,608 --> 00:56:37,736
I think there's a baby

667
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,195
That's my turn

668
00:56:55,195 --> 00:56:59,633
Hey stop fighting,
keep that stuff / Okay dad

669
00:57:11,144 --> 00:57:13,746
Just get / drive the car

670
00:57:13,746 --> 00:57:16,316
I take care of this

671
00:57:16,316 --> 00:57:18,615
To me, see what we get

672
00:57:28,061 --> 00:57:31,364
Back to my life, today

673
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,662
Move aside

674
00:57:37,237 --> 00:57:39,365
Hey we made it

675
00:57:43,977 --> 00:57:46,479
We don't / Who is this person

676
00:57:46,479 --> 00:57:50,149
Never thought where / my turn

677
00:57:50,149 --> 00:57:52,719
Straight ahead

678
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:57,089
That's Vin Diesel

679
00:58:03,763 --> 00:58:06,165

680
00:58:06,165 --> 00:58:09,158
With your body / Hey

681
00:58:09,502 --> 00:58:11,738
Where did you learn from / here

682
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:15,505
That happens when we speed up

683
00:58:16,309 --> 00:58:19,212
Could not reach it,
bring it closer / What

684
00:58:19,212 --> 00:58:20,713
Closer

685
00:58:20,713 --> 00:58:24,673
Oh you mean this / Yes

686
00:58:37,697 --> 00:58:41,361
Give it to me

687
00:58:46,706 --> 00:58:50,473
That's sweet, let's keep this

688
00:58:53,346 --> 00:58:56,316
We will be very bad

689
00:58:59,152 --> 00:59:01,018
You have that trick right

690
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,992
Move aside

691
00:59:09,195 --> 00:59:12,231
That doesn't sound good / Get rid of it

692
00:59:12,231 --> 00:59:16,430
Remove from the window / Me
turn off / okay pull over

693
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,211
What i got

Closer / That's the way

695
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,518
It's still here

696
00:59:36,522 --> 00:59:40,186
Keep away from me

697
00:59:49,035 --> 00:59:50,367
Sonic

698
01:00:06,753 --> 01:00:08,381
You are ok

699
01:00:08,554 --> 01:00:10,182
Tell him

700
01:00:15,995 --> 01:00:17,630
Do we get him?

701
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:20,466
Oh no

702
01:00:20,466 --> 01:00:23,095
There are survivors in this city

703
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,636
We are

704
01:00:32,011 --> 01:00:34,378
To the wall

705
01:00:34,947 --> 01:00:37,083
I won't need you

706
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:41,020
Humans cannot be relied on, and are stupid

707
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:43,756
But my genes are great

708
01:00:43,756 --> 01:00:46,157
They are everything to me

709

You are right

Don't do it / okay get it

This power is the engine

01:04:32,218 --> 01:04:35,450
Finally able to reach its potential

734
01:04:41,494 --> 01:04:43,258
Will be alright

735
01:04:44,697 --> 01:04:47,333
It will be OK

736
01:04:47,333 --> 01:04:51,304
I know Tom, what am I?

I didn't know you had to
help me / I don't know

741
01:05:05,251 --> 01:05:09,021
He looks just

How messed up

743
01:05:11,524 --> 01:05:14,392

810
01:09:19,171 --> 01:09:21,003
Montana

811
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:24,241
Yes it is serious

812
01:09:30,316 --> 01:09:33,150
You just saved our lives

813
01:09:41,026 --> 01:09:43,188
How much longer, me
can't stand it here

814
01:09:45,297 --> 01:09:47,733
Hello there is someone there

815
01:09:47,733 --> 01:09:50,069
Your child is in that bag

816
01:09:50,069 --> 01:09:53,506
No, yes it's a child
but not mine

817
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:56,166
Not your child

818
01:09:56,508 --> 01:10:00,279
Relax I'm a cop, he is
love it there, buddy

819
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:04,273
Why I like it here, at
here worse than before

820
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:08,285
Children

821
01:10:09,254 --> 01:10:12,452
Is anyone there

822
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:27,339
What did you keep in this bag

823
01:10:27,339 --> 01:10:29,208
A pickle jar

824
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:32,110
Okay, what are we looking for

825
01:10:33,579 --> 01:10:34,672
Here it is

826
01:10:35,748 --> 01:10:39,051
Okay what is happening now / Now
I have to do

827
01:10:39,051 --> 01:10:42,988
Think about where the ring appeared
and I throw / Just like that

828
01:10:43,522 --> 01:10:46,924
We did it / Yes

829
01:10:47,426 --> 01:10:50,596
Sorry we didn't make it all in
Your bucket list / It's OK

830
01:10:50,596 --> 01:10:52,326
I do what I want most

831
01:10:53,365 --> 01:10:54,767
You both

832
01:10:54,767 --> 01:10:58,604
Very sweet / What / No.

833
01:10:58,604 --> 01:11:02,641
We are not sweet / we are missing children
live by your own rules

834
01:11:02,641 --> 01:11:05,411
Exactly / Really / Yes
and our rules

835
01:11:05,411 --> 01:11:08,677
Includes emotion sensor / If
you said so

836
01:11:09,114 --> 01:11:11,481
Okay then fine

837
01:11:13,452 --> 01:11:17,219
You will go / We must
Go too. Okay

838
01:11:22,561 --> 01:11:24,052
One more thing

839
01:11:31,737 --> 01:11:33,672
I'm sorry I was very rude to you

840
01:11:36,408 --> 01:11:38,775
I know it was a tough decision
to leave me

841
01:11:39,645 --> 01:11:42,347
Get away from something you care about

842
01:11:42,347 --> 01:11:44,516
It must be very painful

843
01:11:44,516 --> 01:11:46,417
Really you want to go

844
01:11:47,419 --> 01:11:49,047
I don't want to go

845
01:11:49,188 --> 01:11:50,520
But I cannot stay

846
01:11:50,823 --> 01:11:53,759
As long as I'm here, me
for dangerous people

847
01:11:53,759 --> 01:11:55,421
I can't do it

848
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:59,264
I just want you to know
these past two days

849
01:11:59,264 --> 01:12:03,599
It has been two days
the best of my life

850
01:12:06,438 --> 01:12:10,075
I will miss you

851
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:12,271
I miss you too

852
01:12:13,212 --> 01:12:16,148
Terimakaish / For what

853
01:12:16,682 --> 01:12:19,015
To save my life

854
01:12:35,667 --> 01:12:38,694
Okay, someone left the cellphone

855
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:08,200
Welcome to
Sanfrancisco, Mr. Wokosky

856
01:13:08,734 --> 01:13:10,803
I enjoy

857
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,172
It's a government man
who tried to kill us

858
01:13:13,172 --> 01:13:18,133
Unsuccessful / Yes, what will you do

859
01:13:19,611 --> 01:13:20,846
It's a flight suit

860
01:13:20,846 --> 01:13:23,081
Designed for my body temperature

861
01:13:23,081 --> 01:13:27,486
Subtract / Oh yeah he's still / The good one

862
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:29,488
You're fired Thomas

863
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:32,491
Oh hot talk, I take a lot

864
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:36,295
Does he have a name or us?
call him severe destruction

865
01:13:36,295 --> 01:13:37,996
Hey watch your mouth

866
01:13:37,996 --> 01:13:39,624
You want to get more
than I gave

867
01:13:40,299 --> 01:13:45,101
Time / Hajar on his face
Amazing / Talk time over

868
01:13:45,470 --> 01:13:48,674
Time to press the button / You
that fly is impressive

869
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:51,041
Sir is right, let's face it

870
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:53,611
Never chase me / Confidence

871
01:13:54,046 --> 01:13:57,380
Stupid people change for intelligence

872
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:05,290
That's not good

873
01:14:05,724 --> 01:14:07,159
Sonic

874
01:14:07,159 --> 01:14:10,262
You can be super fast, and not survive

875
01:14:10,262 --> 01:14:12,390
Maybe it will explode / Yes

876
01:14:13,298 --> 01:14:16,530
Don't worry, I know
What to do

877
01:14:22,774 --> 01:14:25,277
I did not expect this

878
01:14:25,277 --> 01:14:28,509
I didn't expect it, so it doesn't count

879
01:15:28,173 --> 01:15:33,743
Come on

880
01:15:56,268 --> 01:15:57,803
Oh

881
01:15:57,803 --> 01:16:01,506
Hi glad you're on
here / Can I ask for help

882
01:16:01,506 --> 01:16:05,204
Oh he will be born

883
01:16:09,381 --> 01:16:11,817
Genius advice

884
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,518
Do not run

885
01:16:13,518 --> 01:16:15,749
It will get worse if you do

886
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:19,524
And bad for you / Okay

887
01:16:19,524 --> 01:16:21,026
You want it fast

888
01:16:21,026 --> 01:16:23,325
Come on, quickly

889
01:16:25,197 --> 01:16:26,597
The hard way is indeed

890
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:48,584
That's illegal anyways

891
01:16:50,222 --> 01:16:53,692
So here it is again, we've been through
very much together

892
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:58,697
Now you understand why there is a doctor
crazy robot chasing super sonic hedgehog

893
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:01,599
Want to know what it is / Yes you too

894
01:17:18,784 --> 01:17:21,754
How could it be

895
01:17:34,266 --> 01:17:36,394
Yes ma'am

896
01:17:40,138 --> 01:17:43,233
Yes, here it is

897
01:17:51,183 --> 01:17:52,981
I cannot lose him

898
01:18:06,531 --> 01:18:09,467
Can't beat him, me too

899
01:18:13,305 --> 01:18:15,399
Contact

900
01:18:19,277 --> 01:18:21,337
You are alone there

901
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,772
This is from 7 miracles

902
01:18:56,481 --> 01:18:59,974
You are an extraordinary little creature

903
01:19:02,387 --> 01:19:06,757
It will be fun to bring you
back to the lab, for the procedure

904
01:19:07,259 --> 01:19:09,455
There is the last word

905
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:13,030
Damn

906
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,371
I must say
to you / it was made possible

907
01:19:19,371 --> 01:19:23,172
You are very selfish

908
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:31,916
You think you are

909
01:19:33,318 --> 01:19:36,049
Don't know you / Damn

910
01:19:39,958 --> 01:19:41,950
Auto pilot adjust

911
01:19:42,394 --> 01:19:43,995
Why

912
01:19:43,995 --> 01:19:46,398
Why did you waste your life for this

913
01:19:46,398 --> 01:19:48,924
Think that's why I don't have friends

914
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:52,437
Next thing you know, best friend
and there is a wedding in the city

915
01:19:52,437 --> 01:19:55,207
Like no one
do better

916
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:58,276
And where are we? Oh yeah

917
01:19:58,276 --> 01:20:00,108
You will die

918
01:20:02,347 --> 01:20:04,509
I'm sorry, Sheriff

919
01:20:05,417 --> 01:20:08,753
Devil Blue

920
01:20:08,753 --> 01:20:10,789
This is the real creature

921
01:20:10,789 --> 01:20:13,657
And not always created by me

922
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:18,658
Be careful / Tom

923
01:20:32,477 -->01:20:34,912
I mean to be good here but

924
01:20:35,113 --> 01:20:38,242
Someone must get it
ice, make the body fresh

925
01:20:40,485 --> 01:20:43,288
He is just a funny little alien

926
01:20:43,288 --> 01:20:45,018
He doesn't belong here

927
01:20:47,025 --> 01:20:49,227
That little alien

928
01:20:49,227 --> 01:20:51,363
And more human

929
01:20:51,363 --> 01:20:53,331
You ever

930
01:20:53,331 --> 01:20:56,995
His name is Sonic, this is his house

931
01:20:58,069 --> 01:21:00,300
My friend

932
01:21:24,062 --> 01:21:26,622
He is all yours

933
01:21:27,098 --> 01:21:29,124
We are back,

934
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:34,435
I think you have something that belongs to me

935
01:21:45,283 --> 01:21:47,385
This is my home

936
01:21:47,385 --> 01:21:49,821
And I don't use to run anymore

937
01:21:49,821 --> 01:21:54,122
I use to protect my friend

938
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:53,818
Damn / guess what

939
01:22:53,818 --> 01:22:56,447
I did not leave the earth, but you

940
01:22:56,721 --> 01:22:58,383
You know what

941
01:23:46,704 --> 01:23:50,141
I told you I could / We can

942
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:04,314
This is yours / Thank you very much

943
01:24:05,356 --> 01:24:08,986
There is no pushing anyone out of
building / You know I can't promise that

944
01:24:12,397 --> 01:24:15,433
Pretty good / Thank you

945
01:24:15,433 --> 01:24:17,101
You have to explain this

946
01:24:17,101 --> 01:24:21,129
Donut / No, he's the one

947
01:24:21,339 --> 01:24:23,274
We have things, you get your things

948
01:24:23,374 --> 01:24:25,605
Oh, God

949
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:31,139
Jojo

950
01:24:33,751 --> 01:24:35,151
We can't go back there

951
01:24:36,488 --> 01:24:38,218
We

952
01:24:40,391 --> 01:24:42,383
It's like we go home

953
01:24:43,127 --> 01:24:44,220
Really

954
01:24:46,064 --> 01:24:50,058
I can't feel it
I checked my bucket list

955
01:24:52,370 --> 01:24:54,271
What I want to do

956
01:24:57,609 --> 01:24:59,669
I checked it

957
01:25:00,445 --> 01:25:02,313
Yes, like that

958
01:25:02,313 --> 01:25:05,617
Everything's good

959
01:25:05,617 --> 01:25:09,387
It was an ordinary day at Greenhills

960
01:25:09,387 --> 01:25:12,186
Let's go

961
01:25:12,657 --> 01:25:17,095
You have never seen
intergalactic battles

962
01:25:17,095 --> 01:25:19,360
Robots and doctors

963
01:25:27,972 --> 01:25:30,074
You were there / Yes

964
01:25:30,074 --> 01:25:33,306
There are more

965
01:25:43,688 --> 01:25:45,247
Mr. and Mrs. Wokosky

966
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:47,157
Yes

967
01:25:49,427 --> 01:25:51,763
I'm talking about awards
from your government

968
01:25:51,763 --> 01:25:55,461
Keep calm on new accidents
that never happened

969
01:25:59,103 --> 01:26:01,539
I need to fix that / What is that

970
01:26:01,539 --> 01:26:03,474
You will see

971
01:26:04,208 --> 01:26:06,268
Okay

972
01:26:08,479 --> 01:26:11,082
Oh / oh yes

973
01:26:11,082 --> 01:26:12,584
You will see

974
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:16,783
There is something more
Good / You made it possible

975
01:26:17,689 --> 01:26:20,058
Never end

976
01:26:20,058 --> 01:26:24,052
Um, thank you, we appreciate it

977
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:27,498
Hey I think we can close
file about robotic people

978
01:26:27,966 --> 01:26:29,267
This disappears

979
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:33,398
I'm sorry but no
there is that person there

980
01:26:34,672 --> 01:26:38,443
That's right / You've never been connected

981
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:40,511
With aliens

982
01:26:40,511 --> 01:26:45,142
Want to chat with him

983
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:49,787
you mean little blue people, no

984
01:26:49,787 --> 01:26:52,757
That again

985
01:26:53,491 --> 01:26:56,188
OK / OK

986
01:26:57,261 --> 01:26:59,526
Thank you / OK

987
01:27:05,036 --> 01:27:08,404
That's very possible

988
01:27:08,539 --> 01:27:10,642
So you want to watch a movie or something

989
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:13,544
Sorry, night school, you
must return to your cave

990
01:27:13,544 --> 01:27:15,580
It's three o'clock in the afternoon

991
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:18,683
You know what you become
when you're tired / me, no

992
01:27:18,683 --> 01:27:22,754
You guys are very uncool / Yes we know

993
01:27:22,754 --> 01:27:26,919
Where you going / me
must return to my cave

994
01:27:41,639 --> 01:27:44,973
Oh are you kidding me?

995
01:27:45,576 --> 01:27:47,442
I do not believe

996
01:27:47,779 --> 01:27:49,543
How you

997
01:27:49,747 --> 01:27:52,410
That's all here

998
01:28:02,193 --> 01:28:05,263
Look / You're kidding

999
01:28:05,263 --> 01:28:09,030
Oh how are you

1000
01:28:09,267 --> 01:28:11,566
I like it

1001
01:28:14,605 ​​--> 01:28:17,508
Alright, back home

1002
01:28:17,508 --> 01:28:20,273
Thank you very much


















1003
01:28:59,026 --> 01:29:02,485
My insanity remains absolute

1004
01:29:04,198 --> 01:29:06,258
That's right, Agent Stone

1005
01:29:10,771 --> 01:29:14,139
You just start

1006
01:29:15,042 --> 01:29:16,442
Do something

1007
01:29:17,778 --> 01:29:21,115
Come on it's amazing

1008
01:29:21,115 --> 01:29:22,606
What is wrong with you

1009
01:29:23,050 --> 01:29:26,214
Here it is

1010
01:29:27,154 --> 01:29:30,157
There is no source anymore, there is no supply

1011
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:32,524
There is no way home

1012
01:29:33,994 --> 01:29:35,758
Unless people die here

1013
01:29:38,766 --> 01:29:40,735
I'm going home at Christmas

1014
01:29:59,553 --> 01:30:02,216
Look at this

1015
01:30:06,193 --> 01:30:08,458
Be happy
