1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,421
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:04,506 --> 00:00:07,509
<i>Last night,
some psycho froze a cop to death.</i>

3
00:00:07,717 --> 00:00:09,844
<i>He was using
super-cooled liquid helium.</i>

4
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:11,513
It's one of the most effective substances
in the world

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,847
for rapid temperature reduction.

6
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:16,309
He just wants to know where it comes from
so we can track down the guy.

7
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:18,269
- You confess to murder?
- Yes, I do.

8
00:00:18,603 --> 00:00:21,272
I'm not a criminal, you know.
I'm just insane.

9
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:23,775
- I almost crossed the line tonight.
- How out of character.

10
00:00:23,942 --> 00:00:25,819
- Scared me a little.
- Welcome to my world.

11
00:00:26,111 --> 00:00:28,279
- I can freeze you, like we planned.
- But?

12
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:29,656
I can't bring you back.

13
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:32,409
Solution A14.
No, no, no, no.

14
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:38,748
<i>I'm just thinking of all those
poor mice you're experimenting on.</i>

15
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:41,292
What're you gonna do now?
Look for this Malone guy yourself?

16
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:43,044
Honestly,
I haven't thought that far ahead.

17
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:46,339
Nora.

18
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:50,009
You are gonna help save my wife.

19
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:51,886
<i>My husband did terrible things.</i>

20
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:54,264
<i>But he did those terrible things
for my sake.</i>

21
00:00:54,514 --> 00:00:56,725
I'm dying. He wants to save me.

22
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,353
I'd like to make a confession.
I'm the man that's been freezing people.

23
00:01:00,645 --> 00:01:02,647
A16. It worked.

24
00:01:02,856 --> 00:01:04,566
- Am I dead?
<i>- I can't believe it worked.</i>

25
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:07,318
I'm coming for you, Nora.
I'm coming to save you.

26
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:34,846
Where is everybody?

27
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:37,557
Listen up!

28
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:42,187
Ace Chemicals makes the liquid helium
Victor Fries uses to power his weaponry.

29
00:01:42,395 --> 00:01:44,939
Fries was spotted
entering the building 20 minutes ago.

30
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:49,694
He's desperate and extremely dangerous.
Let's do this.

31
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,984
Damn.

32
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,548
What the hell happened here?

33
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:58,763
Night janitor. Could be a hostage.

34
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,181
Detectives.

35
00:03:05,562 --> 00:03:08,314
Canisters gone.
Looks like he got what he was after.

36
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,608
What's he planning?

37
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,659
"Free my wife."

38
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:37,468
How was Switzerland?

39
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:41,306
There are mountains, snow,

40
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:43,474
people are polite.

41
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:47,729
Alfred said you wanted to talk to me.

42
00:03:49,314 --> 00:03:52,692
Alfred wanted me to speak with you.
He's worried about you.

43
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:56,362
He's worried that you might be concealing
any trauma you must be feeling.

44
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:58,489
He needn't worry.

45
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,160
I tell him I'm fine, which I am,
and he doesn't believe me.

46
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:04,329
You were violently abducted.

47
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:06,873
You nearly died.
You must have been very scared.

48
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,669
It's normal to feel trauma,
it's nothing you need to be ashamed of.

49
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:13,630
I wasn't scared.

50
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,341
No? What did you feel?

51
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:22,013
I felt alive. Intensely alive.

52
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:27,852
Do you think I'm abnormal?

53
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:31,606
You're certainly unusual.
If you're being honest.

54
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:34,776
I'm always honest.

55
00:04:35,944 --> 00:04:38,071
That's a good way to be.

56
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:41,324
- Tough to pull off.
- I try.

57
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,411
- And how do you feel now?
- As I say, I feel fine.

58
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:47,246
Invigorated.

59
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:51,709
I have a second chance at life.

60
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:55,296
What do you plan to do with that chance?

61
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:57,215
My plans remain unchanged.

62
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,218
Find the man who killed my parents.

63
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:02,720
Bruce, you need closure.

64
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:05,848
Exactly.

65
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:11,771
Closure. Not a dangerous
and possibly endless obsession.

66
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:14,357
I'll find him.

67
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:16,734
You're a schoolboy,
not a homicide detective.

68
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:19,529
I believe people can be
two things at once. Don't you think so?

69
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:25,326
Yes, they can. So, you find the culprit.
What then?

70
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:29,914
I'll let the law take its course.

71
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:35,169
- Is that the truthful answer?
- It's the answer I'm giving you.

72
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:39,590
- What happened to Honest Bruce?
- That's a very good question.

73
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:46,889
I guess that's the other Bruce.

74
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,228
Sorry. I don't mean
to be flippant with you.

75
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:57,358
This conversation
has been very useful. Clarifying.

76
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:00,820
Perhaps we can do it again sometime.

77
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,114
Sure. We can do that.

78
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:08,911
"Free my wife?"

79
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:12,707
This guy thinks by killing seven cops,
he can get us to free his wife?

80
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:15,293
I'll free my boot up his frozen ass!

81
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:19,464
Tin can lunatic son of a bitch,
I'll tear his...

82
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:21,549
I'm gonna take a breath.

83
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,845
Well, what about the hostage, the janitor?
Any demands?

84
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:27,180
Not yet.

85
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:28,806
Obviously, we're dealing with a madman

86
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:30,808
and once he realizes
that we're not gonna release his wife,

87
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:33,728
he's gonna come to us,
try to get her, right?

88
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:35,146
What else would he do?

89
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:38,316
- I guess.
- When he does, we'll be ready for him

90
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:40,276
and we'll take him.

91
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:42,653
- Where is she now?
- In a holding cell.

92
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:44,322
Lee and a paramedic are seeing to her.

93
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:47,575
Lee says if she doesn't move
to a hospital soon, she could die.

94
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:49,035
Damn it.

95
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:52,538
We can't secure Gotham General.
It's too many access points.

96
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:54,123
Too many civilians.

97
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,711
Arkham.
They have a full ER facility, right?

98
00:06:59,003 --> 00:07:00,171
We'll take her to Arkham.

99
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:02,006
<i>This way, she can get the care she needs</i>

100
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,384
and we can capture Fries
without endangering any civilians.

101
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,637
- Makes sense.
- Sense?

102
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:11,432
It's a lunatic asylum
filled with crazy people.

103
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:14,685
- You got any better ideas?
- No.

104
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:18,147
You prep her to travel.
I'll call the director at Arkham.

105
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:21,526
And get that out to the press.
I want Fries taking the bait.

106
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:25,696
I'll gonna let you tell Lee that
we're taking her patient to the nut house.

107
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:28,282
- She'll understand.
- Oh, yeah. Totally. Completely.

108
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,076
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

109
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:34,205
You plan on using a dying woman as bait?
A tethered goat? At Arkham?

110
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:35,540
It's not like that.

111
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:37,708
Are you going to tell her husband
where you're taking her?

112
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:40,294
- Yes, but--
- Then it is like that.

113
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,047
It's the least bad of several bad options.

114
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:46,050
We could spread false word
that she's at Gotham General,

115
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,010
but what happens when Fries attacks?

116
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:50,263
It's filled with people
who are too sick to move.

117
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,889
This is the rational way to go.

118
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:54,308
Sometimes, the rational way
is not the best way.

119
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:56,936
If there were better way,
we would take it.

120
00:07:57,228 --> 00:08:00,690
Just trust me,
Nora Fries will be perfectly safe.

121
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:05,653
- I got to go.
- I'm going with her.

122
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:07,697
Lee, there are doctors at Arkham.

123
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,282
She is my patient.

124
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:11,784
I used to work there.
I know those doctors. I'm going.

125
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,161
It's not safe.

126
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:15,413
It's safe for Nora,
but it's not safe for me?

127
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,999
- No, now, now, now, look--
- Yeah. Keep thinking, hotshot.

128
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:20,418
- I'm gonna get my stuff.
- No. You know what I meant.

129
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:23,421
If you use this on me, I'm gonna scream.

130
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:44,984
Who was that?

131
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:46,903
One of Fries' victims.

132
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:52,033
I'd hoped to extract traces of
Fries' formula from the man's tissue,

133
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,202
but no such luck.

134
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,162
Speaking of, you had a call.

135
00:08:56,454 --> 00:09:00,458
The GCPD wants to transfer Nora Fries
to Arkham medical wing.

136
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,210
You mean, the wife?

137
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:04,128
<i>Apparently, she's very sick.</i>

138
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,923
The police think
Fries may try to break her out.

139
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:09,800
They need a more secure medical location.

140
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:14,263
Fries must be doing all this
to save his wife.

141
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:17,141
How romantic.

142
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:18,726
<i>How perfect.</i>

143
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:22,146
Here I am, desperately in need
of his cryonic expertise

144
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:24,440
and he's going to make a house call.

145
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,656
The fates are smiling on us.

146
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:34,492
Swiftly, Peabody, we must prepare.

147
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,210
...<i>having recovered
from being frozen solid</i>

148
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:47,838
<i>before stumbling out
to the bewilderment of the GCPD.</i>

149
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:50,007
<i>He was taken to Gotham Memorial,</i>

150
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,802
<i>where he was treated for minor injuries
and released.</i>

151
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,181
<i>We are now getting word that Nora Fries,
wife of the infamous Mr. Freeze,</i>

152
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:00,184
<i>is being taken to the medical wing
of Arkham Asylum.</i>

153
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:02,395
Arkham?

154
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:06,816
She belongs in a hospital.
Not thrown in among lunatics.

155
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:12,571
It's a trap. Of course it is.

156
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:15,032
They're using her to get to me!

157
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:19,203
The fools. They think
walls and guns can stop me?

158
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:23,374
They have no idea.

159
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:37,555
They'll learn.

160
00:10:55,573 --> 00:10:56,991
Let me go, you brutes!

161
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:04,707
- I want to speak to Professor Strange.
- Director Strange is very busy today.

162
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,501
<i>But rest assured,
nothing happens at Arkham</i>

163
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:09,420
not according to his wishes.

164
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:12,298
What is this thing?
What're you doing to me?

165
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,217
You're to be the face
of our rehabilitation program.

166
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:18,929
If we can cure a man like
Oswald Cobblepot, we can cure anyone.

167
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:24,769
I refuse.
I refuse to be part of your program.

168
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,897
- You have no choice.
- Know this, woman.

169
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:31,359
Nobody yet has failed to regret
vexing the Penguin,

170
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,487
and you are vexing me!

171
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,616
Oh.

172
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:43,579
Make your next decision very carefully.

173
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:25,746
Duck.

174
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:27,957
Duck.

175
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,292
Duck.

176
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,423
<i>Duck.</i>

177
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:37,675
<i>Duck.</i>

178
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:40,469
<i>Duck.</i>

179
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:44,974
- Thank God. It was only a dream.
<i>- Duck.</i>

180
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:46,851
It was only a dream.

181
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:48,227
<i>Goose!</i>

182
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:50,479
You're supposed to chase me.

183
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:53,649
You're the goose.

184
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:57,153
No, no. I'm a...

185
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,321
I'm the...

186
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:01,073
I'm a penguin.

187
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:04,368
Goose! Goose!

188
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:07,621
Goose! Goose!

189
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:11,292
- Problem?
- He's not being the goose.

190
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:15,379
<i>It's fun to participate
in group, Mr. Cobblepot.</i>

191
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,006
You should try.

192
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,051
Yes.

193
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:23,804
Yes, I'd be glad to.

194
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,559
What is it they want me to do?

195
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:31,395
Be the goose.

196
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,397
Okay.

197
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:53,292
Sweet Mother. Is that Penguin?

198
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,668
<i>Duck.</i>

199
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:57,296
Duck.

200
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:58,631
<i>Seems drugged.</i>

201
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:00,883
<i>He's been quite agitated
since he arrived.</i>

202
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:03,594
We put him on a mild sedative
to keep him from hurting himself.

203
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:08,224
Dr. Thompkins, my assistant, Miss Peabody,
will accompany you to the infirmary.

204
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:11,185
<i>- She can provide whatever you need.</i>
- Thank you.

205
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:13,562
<i>Duck.</i>

206
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:15,397
<i>Duck.</i>

207
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:18,692
<i>Duck.</i>

208
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:20,778
We'll set up by the main gate.

209
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,947
You should probably get
the inmates back in their cells.

210
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:24,907
<i>Duck.</i>

211
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:26,534
Duck.

212
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:29,995
- Duck.
<i>- Harv, come on.</i>

213
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,456
<i>Duck.</i>

214
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,459
<i>Duck.</i>

215
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:38,420
<i>Duck.</i>

216
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:49,390
I trust you won't mind sharing the wing
with our dear Miss Kean.

217
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:51,350
You've got to be kidding me.

218
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,811
Oh, do you know Sleeping Beauty?

219
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:55,479
That's my name for her.

220
00:14:56,063 --> 00:15:00,192
So lovely, so still. Like an angel.

221
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:01,777
Uh-huh.

222
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:03,404
Is there a problem?

223
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,823
No. No problem at all.

224
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:17,334
Pinkney, I want obstacles set up to keep
Fries from getting to the main building.

225
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,003
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
- What about the bus?

226
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,171
Yeah, good idea.

227
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:24,091
And, Harvey,
I want a shooter up on that roof.

228
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:28,637
Jim? Jim, Jim, my old friend!

229
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:32,433
- Jim. Help, please.
- Wait! Wait.

230
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:38,731
Give us a minute.

231
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,154
Thank God you're here.
You have to help me. They're torturing me.

232
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:47,781
Torture is what you do.

233
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,452
- The doctors here are trying to help you.
- It's torture, I'm telling you.

234
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,747
- I don't see any signs of it.
- It's mental torture.

235
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:58,417
It's therapy. You're insane, remember?

236
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,420
That's what your lawyers said anyhow.

237
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:04,214
<i>Goodbye, Penguin.</i>

238
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:09,053
You owe me, Jim Gordon. I lied for you!

239
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,390
He killed Galavan! Not me! It was him!

240
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:14,767
<i>It was him!</i>

241
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:18,604
<i>You owe me, Jim Gordon. I lied for you!</i>

242
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:22,566
<i>He killed Galavan! Not me! It was him!</i>

243
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:25,527
<i>It was him! It was him!</i>

244
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,665
I should say,
that's learned him, Master Bruce.

245
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,960
We're supposed to have a training session.

246
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:44,546
Yeah.
Well, I got held up in the city, didn't I?

247
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,549
Besides, I thought your chat with
Dr. Thompkins would keep you occupied.

248
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,468
And I thought you were against therapy.

249
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,930
Well, that's before I realized
you're still keen on keeping secrets.

250
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:55,599
If I'd told you what Selina and I
had planned, you would have stopped me.

251
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:58,435
Because I didn't, I got the name
of my parents' killer from Silver.

252
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,271
Then you made us leave Gotham.

253
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:03,941
We lost more than a month we could have
spent searching for M. Malone.

254
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:07,778
We left the city because you were at the
end of your emotional and physical rope,

255
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:11,782
and quite frankly, you're incapable of
catching a common cold let alone a killer.

256
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:13,450
Will you stop?

257
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:18,288
Now, I need to ask you
a very important question.

258
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,543
Are we in this together,

259
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,046
or not?

260
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:28,966
Yes.

261
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:31,760
We're in this together.

262
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:35,389
Right, well, I told you
I had some business in the city.

263
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:39,643
I went to see a sergeant I know and
we did some digging in some GCPD files

264
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,187
for any M. Malones
that fit our particulars.

265
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,648
Age, size, height, race.

266
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,943
Whether they were free
during the murder of your parents.

267
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:49,570
And?

268
00:17:57,453 --> 00:17:58,912
Patrick Malone.

269
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:04,168
Goes by the nickname "Matches."

270
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:08,130
<i>Delightful chap, really.
Committed his first murder when he was 15.</i>

271
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:11,008
Suspected of half a dozen since.

272
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,593
<i>Now, I need to ask you,</i>

273
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,972
if you were in charge, what next?

274
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:19,349
You could've gotten this information
from Detective Gordon.

275
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:20,559
Why didn't you contact him?

276
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,686
I'm the one asking the questions now,
Master Bruce.

277
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:26,690
We find this man, what do you plan to do?

278
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:35,574
- Kill him.
- No.

279
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:40,454
- You can't stop me--
- I bloody can, and I will.

280
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:44,166
You're too young to have a death
on your conscience, Master Bruce.

281
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:48,128
- But--
- I know how your parents deserve justice

282
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,005
and I know you're not gonna stop
till you find it.

283
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:55,177
But when we find this Malone,
I will kill him and not you.

284
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:56,929
That is the deal.

285
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,264
Do you accept?

286
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:03,519
- Yes.
- Say it.

287
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:08,524
We find him, we make him talk.

288
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,902
You kill him.

289
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:33,257
You have no idea what you're missing.

290
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:40,889
Bitch.

291
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:43,934
Where am I?

292
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,396
- Where am I?
- Nora.

293
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,982
Try not to exert yourself.

294
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,651
- You're in a hospital.
- Who are you?

295
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,153
This is not Gotham General.

296
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:58,740
No. You're in a more secure place.

297
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:01,618
I'm Doctor Thompkins. Lee.

298
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,290
They're scared of Victor.

299
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,001
Yes.

300
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,963
Victor only did these terrible things
because of me.

301
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,716
You're not responsible
for your husband's actions.

302
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:17,384
He's not an evil man.

303
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:21,597
He believes the good of saving me
outweighs the bad of his actions.

304
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:23,307
I understand.

305
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,684
But he's not my concern right now,
you are,

306
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,311
and you have to try and stay calm.

307
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,480
You're stable,
but you're still very fragile.

308
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,483
I could have saved him.

309
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,528
I saw him going down this path.

310
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:39,656
Becoming more and more obsessed.

311
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:43,744
Why didn't I do something?

312
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,791
I know what you mean.
It's hard when you love someone.

313
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:55,005
You see the person that they were,
the person they could still become.

314
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,427
You close your eyes to the truth.

315
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,433
He's coming for me, isn't he?

316
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,145
The police think so.

317
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,105
So stubborn, my Victor.

318
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:16,193
- You're pregnant.
- Yes.

319
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,321
Do you know yet if it's a boy or a girl?

320
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:21,531
Not yet.

321
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,368
I always wanted a girl.

322
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,081
You shouldn't be here.

323
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:34,044
Let's focus on you
and not worry about me. Okay?

324
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:45,222
Winter stakeout
at the loony bin. Fabulous.

325
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:49,393
Nora doesn't have long. Fries knows that.
He'll come soon.

326
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:53,313
He'd better.
We could freeze to death waiting.

327
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:55,148
Which would be ironic.

328
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,908
You hear that?

329
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:09,413
Take cover!

330
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,165
<i>- Let's go. Heads up!</i>
<i>- Eyes open.</i>

331
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:17,254
<i>Open fire!</i>

332
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:29,850
<i>Move, move, keep going.
Get the door. Go.</i>

333
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:34,688
- Hands in the air!
- I can't. I can't. Don't shoot.

334
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:37,399
- Where's Victor Fries?
- I don't know!

335
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:39,109
Please! Help me!

336
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:45,866
Let's go. Come on.

337
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:54,291
Mommy? Mommy?

338
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,837
Mommy!

339
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:01,673
Hello?

340
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:12,476
Huh?

341
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:31,828
Copy that.
Fries took out a wall in the east wing.

342
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:34,831
Have B team cut him off.
We'll head directly to the infirmary.

343
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:37,918
Alpha to Bravo. Continue pursuing suspect.
We're headed to the infirmary.

344
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:40,921
Copy that. Maintaining pursuit.

345
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,096
Take cover!

346
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,107
Nora!

347
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:18,500
What the hell?

348
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,210
Uh-oh.

349
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:25,382
Go!

350
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:11,219
<i>Hello, Victor.</i>

351
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:13,597
<i>Forgive me
for getting straight to the point.</i>

352
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:16,099
I'm a great admirer of your work and

353
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:19,269
I'd like to offer a way out
of your situation.

354
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,605
- Who are you?
<i>- I'm a friend.</i>

355
00:25:21,897 --> 00:25:24,774
But let me ask you.
Once you rescue your wife,

356
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:29,237
what is your plan? To steal a vehicle?
Blast your way out?

357
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:33,950
There is a set of keys on the chair.

358
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:37,495
<i>They belong to a vehicle
that is waiting by the loading docks.</i>

359
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:44,502
- How do I know it's not a trap?
- It is not a trap.

360
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:46,213
It is an exchange.

361
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:48,548
<i>You get your wife and your freedom.</i>

362
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:51,384
I can keep the police at bay
while you escape.

363
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:57,599
As thanks, you will leave me one cartridge
of your cryonic formula.

364
00:25:58,225 --> 00:25:59,643
<i>What do you say?</i>

365
00:26:00,936 --> 00:26:02,979
<i>The police are coming,
you can't beat them all</i>

366
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:07,234
and time is running out for you
and for Nora.

367
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:24,167
Go fetch that, would you, Miss Peabody?

368
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,844
Fries is in the building. We have to go.

369
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,390
We can't leave her. The staff bailed
when the alarm went off, she'll die.

370
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:40,767
So, we take her with us. Come on.

371
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:44,813
Careful.

372
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:49,276
Thank you.

373
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,325
I'll take it from here.

374
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:07,043
Victor, Victor listen to me.
We're trying to help her.

375
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:08,586
- You're killing her.
<i>- No, no.</i>

376
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:10,005
- Victor.
<i>- Victor, I understand</i>

377
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:12,132
- why you're doing this.
- I'm saving her life.

378
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:14,551
At the cost of how many other lives?

379
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:17,095
Too many to turn back now.

380
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:21,224
Soon as I've done what I need to do,
I'll give myself up.

381
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,601
But now we have to leave.

382
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:27,981
Victor, I'm a doctor, if we move her now,
she might die.

383
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:30,066
A doctor, good.

384
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:32,402
You're coming with us
to push the wheelchair, let's go.

385
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:35,363
- No, no way!
- Jim, I'm going. She's my patient.

386
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:37,615
I can't let you do that. I'll go, take me.

387
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:40,076
Jim, it's not your call. She needs me.

388
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:42,579
I'm not gonna hurt her.

389
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:44,914
I don't wanna hurt anyone
unless I have to.

390
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:49,085
- Jim, I'm going.
- Victor, please, don't do this.

391
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:52,756
Nora, don't worry, it's all under control.

392
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:57,260
- Help.
- We have to go, now. You, in there.

393
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:02,015
- Do what he is saying. We'll be okay.
- Now!

394
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,143
Okay.

395
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:16,696
Okay, let's go.

396
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:35,340
Thank you so much.

397
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:49,145
<i>Lee!</i>

398
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:55,318
Lee!

399
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:11,000
Apologies, officers, the extreme
cold has shorted the wiring.

400
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:12,460
We're working on it.

401
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:14,170
<i>Well, work on it quick!</i>

402
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:15,630
Oh, we are.

403
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:17,674
We are.

404
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:22,262
Please put that somewhere very safe,
would you, Miss Peabody?

405
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:24,722
Good news, officers.

406
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:33,690
Did Fries say anything,
anything at all about his plans?

407
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:36,943
No, nothing. He just said sorry.

408
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:40,029
Yo, partner! What'd we miss?

409
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,157
Fries got away with Nora and Lee.

410
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:44,534
I put a BOLO out on the vehicle,
but that's all we got.

411
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:47,495
Fries has to put his wife on ice
as quickly as possible, right?

412
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:50,498
He can't go home, there's cops
at the door. Where's he gonna go?

413
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:52,750
He's got the equipment with him.
He could freeze her anywhere.

414
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,172
Wait, now he could freeze her,
but he can't keep her frozen,

415
00:29:57,672 --> 00:29:59,424
not without one of those cryo chambers
he built.

416
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:00,800
Then he is going home.

417
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:02,927
They're still at his house,
they were never taken into evidence.

418
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:05,388
It's where he went, has to be. Come on.

419
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:24,741
Victor, please think about this.

420
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:27,744
How will you take care of her
if you're in prison?

421
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:31,247
I won't, you will. Gotham will.

422
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:33,541
It's the law,
as long as she's legally alive,

423
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,085
she's a ward of the city and
the city has to keep her alive and safe.

424
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:38,046
Victor.

425
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:40,757
I'm here, darling. I've brought you home.

426
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:42,842
I'm so tired.

427
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:46,054
I know. It will all be over soon.

428
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:48,890
Victor...

429
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:53,978
I want you to let me go. Let me die.

430
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:58,608
Nora, you don't mean that.
I can do this, the process works.

431
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,778
So, I should wake up one day,
with you in prison?

432
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:05,657
Or dead?
A life alone isn't one that I want.

433
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:09,953
I'll be there when you wake up.
I'll be there, I'll find a way, I will.

434
00:31:10,328 --> 00:31:11,704
There's always hope.

435
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:15,041
As long as you're alive,
there's hope, right?

436
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:20,713
Yes, there's hope.

437
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:24,259
Okay.

438
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:31,599
My necklace, the one that you gave me
on our first anniversary,

439
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,145
it's on the night stand.
Would you get it for me please, dear?

440
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:41,651
Go. I'm strong enough to use it
if I need to.

441
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,996
If you hurry, you can make it out
before he gets back.

442
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:54,998
I'm not leaving you.

443
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,791
This must be very stressful
for you and your baby.

444
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,376
We're fine.

445
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:00,837
Could I have some water?

446
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:17,645
Thank you.

447
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:24,569
You heard him,
he's not a bad man at heart.

448
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:28,531
- You have to tell them that.
- I will.

449
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:32,535
Please tell them that I'm very sorry
for my part in this.

450
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:37,415
I saw the man that he was becoming
and I did nothing.

451
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:41,502
Because I loved him.

452
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,382
You know what that's like, don't you?

453
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:49,385
I do.

454
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:52,889
Thank you.

455
00:32:54,557 --> 00:32:57,727
You've been very kind.
God bless you and your baby.

456
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:00,647
Nora, I got it.

457
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:03,232
I've got it.

458
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,111
Victor.

459
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:10,907
I love you.

460
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:15,078
Please don't blame yourself.

461
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:18,247
I love you.

462
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:24,212
See you soon.

463
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:28,091
You should stand back.

464
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:18,808
I felt the breeze
when you came in the window.

465
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,484
I'm glad you came. I need a favor.

466
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:30,737
Nice to see you, Selina.

467
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:33,364
Sorry for not telling you
that I was skipping town

468
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:35,241
to go to my castle in France.

469
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,161
- It's a chalet in Switzerland.
- Whatever.

470
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:40,830
Where's the King of Snotty England?

471
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:42,999
Alfred went to the city.

472
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:51,507
This is the man that Silver told us about.
Alfred tracked him down.

473
00:34:54,594 --> 00:34:57,346
Patrick Malone.
I thought his name started with M?

474
00:34:57,805 --> 00:34:59,515
The M stands for "Matches,"
that's a nickname.

475
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:01,434
That's a lame nickname.

476
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:05,980
So, you found him.
What do you need me for?

477
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:08,649
I need you to get me a gun.

478
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:12,862
- So, you're gonna kill him?
- Yes.

479
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:14,530
Your butler know?

480
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:16,324
Alfred thinks
he's gonna be the one to kill him,

481
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:18,159
that's why I'm asking you.

482
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:21,704
You couldn't even push that guy
out of the window.

483
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:24,916
So, how do you expect to do this?

484
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:29,462
Because this man killed my parents.

485
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,552
You ever even fired a gun before?

486
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:38,387
Please, Selina,
you're the only person I can--

487
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:40,389
You don't even know
what you're asking, Bruce.

488
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:42,308
Yeah, sure, the guy deserves it.

489
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:48,147
But doing this,
you won't ever, ever be the same.

490
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:54,362
That's what I'm counting on.

491
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:08,876
Crap, how'd you wanna play this one?

492
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,797
Slow and careful,
no gun play if we can help it.

493
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:15,007
Set up a perimeter, I'm gonna look inside.

494
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:18,636
Roger. Perimeter. Hey, set up a perimeter.

495
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,063
Give me one more moment, Doctor,
and I'll put myself in your charge.

496
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,617
No. No.

497
00:36:41,993 --> 00:36:43,578
No, no, no, no, no!

498
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:45,079
No, no, no, no, no!

499
00:36:45,496 --> 00:36:46,539
Nora!

500
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:49,625
I don't understand, it works,
my formula works! How?

501
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:53,796
She switched cartridges.

502
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:56,299
She changed her cartridges?

503
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:01,804
Did you know?
Did you know she switched the cartridges?

504
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:02,972
No.

505
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:08,561
I'm so sorry.

506
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:11,981
<i>Mr. Fries,
this is the GCPD, you're surrounded.</i>

507
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:16,944
<i>Please come out and give yourself up
and let's avoid any more sadness.</i>

508
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:19,488
Yeah.

509
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:23,326
No more sadness.

510
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:28,164
Will you be very kind

511
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:31,834
and go tell the police
that I will do as they say?

512
00:37:36,714 --> 00:37:40,843
Nora loved you very much.
I'm envious of the bond you had.

513
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,936
GCPD. Victor?

514
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:38,776
Oh, my God.

515
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,256
Hey. You should go back to bed.

516
00:39:01,924 --> 00:39:03,050
Can't sleep.

517
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:08,347
Heard you on the phone.

518
00:39:09,223 --> 00:39:13,394
Hugo Strange called.
Victor Fries died in Arkham infirmary.

519
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:15,312
<i>They couldn't revive him.</i>

520
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:17,898
You okay?

521
00:39:18,816 --> 00:39:21,277
I am. Are you?

522
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:26,866
Wish you hadn't gone.

523
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:33,414
Wish you hadn't put our baby at risk.

524
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:37,084
You put us at risk
when you put Nora at risk.

525
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:39,795
- She was under my care.
- That was different, that was police work.

526
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:41,464
That was you, it's all you.

527
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:44,592
Arkham was actually Barnes' idea,
but it made sense,

528
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,927
- it was good police work.
- What about Galavan?

529
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:49,221
Was that good police work, too?

530
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,183
- What about him?
- The way he died.

531
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:55,644
Whatever the truth is,
it's not what you told me.

532
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:56,979
How do you know?

533
00:39:57,313 --> 00:39:59,648
Because I know
when you're being dishonest.

534
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:02,943
And you know what?
If anybody deserves to die, it's Galavan.

535
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:08,324
But don't talk to me about police work,
it's you, you lied to me.

536
00:40:30,096 --> 00:40:32,848
I know you say
there are no hopeless cases.

537
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:34,600
And there are none.

538
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:38,979
The beauty of life can spring forward
from even the harshest of climates.

539
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:43,609
We simply need to be more <i>aggressive</i>
in our treatment.

540
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:47,738
Now, I must go see to our newest guest.

541
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:05,673
Good morning, Victor.

542
00:41:09,844 --> 00:41:11,095
Where am I?

543
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,140
Legally, your corpse
is in the Arkham morgue,

544
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:18,811
but obviously you're here. Indian Hill.

545
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,564
Indian Hill is a toxic waste dump.

546
00:41:22,231 --> 00:41:23,899
A useful fiction.

547
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,110
You're the one who spoke to me in Arkham.

548
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:29,780
Hugo Strange.
Pleasure to meet you face to face.

549
00:41:30,406 --> 00:41:31,866
How is it I am not dead?

550
00:41:33,117 --> 00:41:34,702
It's simply astonishing, isn't it?

551
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:38,539
<i>My guess is that you absorbed some of
your own formula over the past months.</i>

552
00:41:38,831 --> 00:41:41,333
Your body underwent
a profound cellular change,

553
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:44,170
when you were brought in here,
you were actually overheating.

554
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:46,922
Now look there, at the thermometer.

555
00:41:49,008 --> 00:41:52,386
It's negative 20 degrees
and I'm not even cold.

556
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:56,765
The formula appears to have lowered
your core body temperature.

557
00:41:57,099 --> 00:42:00,269
You can only survive
in severe hypothermic conditions,

558
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:02,771
anything above freezing will kill you.

559
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:05,733
<i>But never fear,
you won't be locked in there forever.</i>

560
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:09,361
We've made some modifications to your suit
to allow you to walk freely.

561
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:13,115
<i>For now, rest. Tomorrow we begin work.</i>

562
00:42:13,908 --> 00:42:17,077
One project in particular
I think you will find fascinating.

563
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:19,455
I should have died with Nora.

564
00:42:21,457 --> 00:42:22,958
This all should have ended.

565
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:26,086
<i>Then take this opportunity, Victor,</i>

566
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,839
pretend you did die.

567
00:42:29,924 --> 00:42:35,095
Death is not an ending,
death is a new beginning.

568
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:48,210
