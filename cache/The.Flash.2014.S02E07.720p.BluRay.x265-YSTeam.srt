BARRY: My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:09,968
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:13,058
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:16,225
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,807 --> 00:00:18,684
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:22,025
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,362
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,527
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,736 --> 00:00:29,829
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:31,035
Zoom wants me dead.

11
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:32,950
The meta-humans
that he's sending from Earth-2,

12
00:00:33,115 --> 00:00:34,743
they don't care how many
innocent people get in the way.

13
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,002
I have to go.

14
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,454
I need you to tell me
that it's okay.

15

16
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,340
Barry!

17
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:44,674
Is this the face of your
hero, Central City?

20
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:50,683
Seriously. You got your ass kicked.

21
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,265
I can't feel my legs.

22
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:03,530
- JOE: All right, I got you.
- Okay.

23
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:04,861
All right, I got you.

24
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,828
(GRUNTS)

25
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:12,200
I can't do it right now all right?

26
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,956
- Oh, yes you can, Barry.
- No, no, no.

27
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,457
(GRUNTS)

28
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,335
We were making so much progress.

29
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:18,585
Yep, six whole steps.

30
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,042
Someone get me a Bozo button.

31
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,466
Hey, give yourself some credit.
You just broke your back.

32
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:25,548
Yeah. A normal person would've been
paralyzed the rest of his life.

33
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,381
Hmm. How long until I'm fully healed?

34
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,265
The initial MRI I took a week ago
showed a complete dislocation

35
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:35,599
at the T-twelve to L-one interspace
of the thoracolumbar junction.

36
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,603
But this is the MRI I took this morning.

37
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,938
It's remarkable,
but you're almost completely healed.

38
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,152
I'm still having trouble breathing.

39
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,438
That's totally normal
with a spinal injury.

40
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,403
It should clear up soon.

41
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,620
JOE: We're gonna get you back
in that suit, Barr.

42
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:53,037
Real quick. Trust me.

43
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,122
What are we gonna do about Zoom?

44
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,793
No sign of him since Cisco nailed him
with that tranq dart.

45
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,421
And I haven't vibed since then.

46
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,418
Maybe Zoom's not coming back.

47
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,750
I highly doubt that.

48
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,965
Which is why
I'm gonna go do something about it.

49
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:09,921
What do you mean go do something about it?

50
00:02:10,212 --> 00:02:13,262
I need access to your breach room
and your speed cannon.

51
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,766
Why is that?

52
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:17,223
Because, Barry, it's time to go home.

53
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:27,856
So, you show up on our Earth,
you screw everything up,

54
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:31,117
and now you want to go home.
Sounds very familiar.

55
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,574
Again, that wasn't me.

56
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,911
I need to go take care of Zoom
once and for all

57
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,996
before anyone else gets killed.

58
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,418
How do you plan on doing that?

59
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:41,668
I'll think of something.

60
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,712
Ramon, if you'll escort me
to the speed cannon.

61
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,213
No, no. You can't go through the breach.

62
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,546
Yeah, he can.
Jay taught us how to send people.

63
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,881
That's not what I mean.

64
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,216
Look, if you can figure out
how to stop Zoom on your Earth,

65
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,722
you can figure out how to do it here.

66
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:56,014
We need you to stay here
until we defeat Zoom, Dr. Wells.

67
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,393
What I need, Dr. Snow, is to return home.

68
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,526
I'm gonna do that,
with or without your assistance.

69
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:11,192
What are you doing?
If Harry wants to go, bye.

70
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,576
Look, like it or not, Cisco,
we need his help.

71
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,487
I'm not sure another plan
from Wells is what we need.

72
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,574
Yeah. I mean, the last bright idea he had
nearly got Barry killed.

73
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:21,492
I know. But Jay's gone.

74
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,704
And Dr. Wells knows Zoom
better than anyone.

75
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:27,295
So, until Barry is back on his feet again,

76
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,301
we need to keep Wells around
in case Zoom returns.

77
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,179
Caitlin, if he doesn't want to be here,
then we're better off without him.

78
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:34,588
Let him go.

79
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,554
I can't do that. Not yet.

80
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,603

81

Oh, snap, meta-human attack.

Nope. Nope. My bad.
That is just an alert for me.

83
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,650
For what?

84
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,783
Oh, it's just a reminder.

85
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,819
Oh, with who?

86
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,576
With the lovely Kendra Saunders,
the barista at Jitters.

87

Oh, she makes a mean latte.

I think we're gonna go out
for dinner and a movie.

maybe some breakfast.

127
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:56,279
My plan

128
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,901
was to get The Flash's help
and use that help to stop Zoom.

129
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:02,411
And my plan failed.
I don't have another plan.

Except to go back home

131
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,624
and face Zoom myself.

132
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,874
So, let's say you go back to your Earth
and you fight Zoom.

00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,629
He will kill you.

And then how does that help your daughter?

Look, the best way to save Jesse

136
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,797
is for you to stay here.

of these breaches is gonna get me home.

00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,228
how to close all the breaches.

143
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,610
Then, you'd be stuck here.

All of them except one.

147
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,913
So Zoom only has one way
to get to this world.

148

- The breach at S.T.A.R. Labs.

he had just stolen a serum
from their storage cooler.

It's called Cortexin.
It's used to treat encephalopathy.

Uh, blood disease in the brain.

a couple of minutes later, dead.

Caitlin always kind.

333
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,864
Why did you bring me here?

334
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,452
Need help.

335
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,538
I don't understand.

336
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,670
How did I become Grodd?

337
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,467
Oh.

338
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,506
That's a long story, Grodd. Um...

339
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:33,472
The dark matter
from the particle accelerator explosion,

340
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,517
that's how this happened.

341
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:38,815
Repeat.

342
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,942
Repeat?

(ECHOING) Need to repeat Grodd!

345
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:54,748
You want me to make more like you?

346
00:17:56,616 --> 00:17:57,709
I don't know how to do that.

(CHUCKLES)

354
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,207
That was a hell of an idea you had,
bringing Henry here.

355
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,421
Well, he may not have his mother,
but he's got two amazing fathers.

356
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:52,088
- Seemed like he needed both.
- (BOTH CHUCKLING)

- My girl.
- Mmm.

358
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:00,765
So, how did Grodd become sentient?

359
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,308
A few years ago, S.T.A.R. Labs
had this contract

360
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,443
with the military to research and awaken

361
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,652
latent mind reading capabilities
for interrogation purposes.

362
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,567
And I'm guessing Grodd
was one of the test subjects.

363
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:13,451
Right. But then,
Dr. Wells shut down the program.

364
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,409
And we all thought it was to save Grodd

365
00:19:15,695 --> 00:19:18,869
from all the crazy
mind control experiments.

366
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:22,662
But it was really so that Dr. Wells
could use the accelerator explosion

367
00:19:22,952 --> 00:19:24,704
to create a 1,500 pound
mind-controlling gorilla

368
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,624
that he could manipulate.

369
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:28,417
- Hmm.
- (COMPUTER WHIRRS)

370
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,551
What kind of algorithm is that?

371
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,464
It's an algorithm meant
to extrapolate Grodd's location

372
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,383
from places we know he's already been.

373
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,480
HARRISON: Hello.

374
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,981
And there we have it.

375
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,233
No spinal cord edema,
I don't see any subacute hemorrhaging,

You're all good, Barry.

378
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,276
I'd give you some physical therapy,

379
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,952
but you don't need it.

380
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,288
I'm really glad you're here, Dad.

381
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,582
Me too.

382
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:05,171
I tried to call, but you can't get a cell
in Granite Peak National Park. So...

00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,999
Granite Peak?
What, you went camping by yourself?

384
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:09,382
Yeah, yeah. I got a tent.

385
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,130
I went fishing every day.

386

392
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,612
Ithink we found them.

393
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,322
Yeah?

394
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,742
Grodd has to be in one of these
three bell towers.

395
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,653
The only reason
we couldn't find them on any cameras

396
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,034
underneath the city before is

397
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,580
'cause he upgraded from a bachelor pad

398
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,657
to a penthouse, like a baller.

399
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,077
Okay. So, we know where he is,
we still don't know how to get her.

400
00:20:45,368 --> 00:20:46,461
We got a plan for you.

401
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,753
What's the plan?

402
00:20:47,954 --> 00:20:49,047

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

408
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,059
I found another suit in the Time Vault.

409
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:02,352
I thought he was dead.

410
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,771
He's dead. This is...
this is Harrison Wells from Earth-2.

411
00:21:05,221 --> 00:21:06,314
Earth-2?

412
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,606
- I'll explain later.
- If we can

413
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,565
get Harry to convince Grodd

414
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,148
that he's his father,

415
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,151
maybe we can convince
him to let Caitlin go.

416
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,575
I'm not gonna be able to help
if anything goes wrong.

417
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:22,323
That's a chance I'm willing to take.

418
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,252
Looks like we're oh-for-two
in the bell towers, huh?

419
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:34,919
I like to think of it more as now,
we know exactly where they are.

420
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,929
Okay, let's do this again.
Give me your best Wells. (SIGHS)

I'm not doing the Wells again, Ramon.
I told you...

00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,055
Look, I Just made these
anti-mind control ear buds.

423
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,721
They could fail, and if they do,
you're toast.

424
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:46,480

This time, up the creep factor,
like, a lot more.

432

And,

433
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,083
make it a little more sincere.

434
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:13,708
Like you really love me,
but you're gonna have to kill me anyway.

435
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,135

00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,403
Now, we wait.

443
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,738
So, this is what it's like.

444
00:22:41,484 --> 00:22:43,657
Every time you go after
one of those meta-humans?

445
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,205
Uh... (SIGHS) pretty much.

446
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,288
Only Cisco and Caitlin
are normally the ones in here,

447
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,667
and I'm the one out there.

448
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,246
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't be.

449
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:56,335
Iris showed me what happened with Zoom.

450
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,465
That was hard to watch.

451
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,757
I can only imagine
what that must've been like for you.

452
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,518
He showed everyone in Central City that
their hero wasn't good enough to stop him.

453
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,101
Well, that's certainly
what it looked like.

454
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,397
Was he right?

455
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,653
(CHUCKLES)

456
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:18,154
Your body's healed, Barry.

457
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,112
And yet, here you are,

458
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,365
feeling the shame of losing.

459
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:26,954
I can't stop him.

460
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,665
I know it, he knows it.

461
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,999
And now,
everyone in this city knows it, too.

462
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,169
They don't believe in me anymore, Dad.

463
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,923
At my trial for your mother's death,
a lot of our family and friends

464
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,257
were in the courtroom.

465
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:45,386
They heard awful things about
what I had done to your mother.

466
00:23:45,673 --> 00:23:46,766
It didn't matter that it wasn't true.

467
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,098
Every day, I could see it on their faces,
the moment

468
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:51,855
when I lost them,

469
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,400
until everybody had
stopped believing in me.

470
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,819
Well, that was my reality, you know?

471
00:23:58,144 --> 00:24:01,273
I was gonna serve a life sentence
for a crime I didn't commit.

472
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,613
But worse than that, every time I looked
at someone in the eye,

473
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,278
from that moment forward,
they were gonna believe

474
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,614
that I had killed the woman I loved

475
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,366
in front of our son.

476
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:20,593
So, yeah. I do know
what's it's like being destroyed.

477
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,343
How did you get past that?

478
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,304
I embraced it.

479
00:24:31,886 --> 00:24:34,015
Accepting it was the only way
that I could move forward.

480
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,479
But I knew that if I could survive that,

481
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:41,902
and learn to believe in myself again,
then I could survive anything.

482
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,114
You know what lit that belief in me,
Barry?

483
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,950
You. (CHUCKLES)

484
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:54,327
Eleven-year-old you running around,
believing in me, gave me that hope.

485
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,712
And now, I'm giving it back to you, Son.

486
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,633
No more monsters can take that from us.

487
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:19,026
So, one of the main differences
between ape and human brains

488
00:25:19,308 --> 00:25:22,563
is the white matter and connectivity
in the brain cells.

489
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,982
The chemicals that
you were treated with as an infant

490
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:30,576
were meant to overcome those differences
and cause an explosive growth of both,

491
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:34,284
similar to what humans experience
in their first few years of life.

492
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:38,290
Maybe, these chemicals can be used
to duplicate that growth,

493
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,832
then we won't need
a particle accelerator explosion.

00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:22,353
The first and the last time.

649
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:25,405
That thing still gives me the creeps.
We should destroy it.

650
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,815
Let's do that,
but see if you can figure out

651
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,530
how to get it back on this ring first.

652
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:30,985
Might be nice to have something like that

653
00:34:31,193 --> 00:34:32,786
instead of carrying around
a bag all the time.

654
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,117
I can help you with that.

655
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,375
What?

656
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,164
I know a thing or two
about microtechnology.

657
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,621
Yeah. You know a thing or two
about a lot of things.

658
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,382
Well, as long as what he knows
keeps my son and these good people safe.

659
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:47,088
The more you know, the better.

660
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,711
Pleasure to meet you, Harrison.

661
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,092
Again.

662
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:51,594
Dr. Allen.

663
00:34:53,048 --> 00:34:54,096
Good to see you.

664
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,639
Cisco.

665
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:56,849
- Let's go.
- Take care.

666
00:34:58,512 --> 00:35:01,766
So, Dr. Wells, this place on your Earth
that we've sent Grodd,

667
00:35:02,224 --> 00:35:03,442
what is it, exactly?

668
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:10,239
It's a refuge where gorillas subjected
to lab experiments, like Grodd,

669
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,614
(WHIRRS)

670
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,204
can roam freely.

671
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:19,746
I know it's for the best,
but I still feel like I betrayed him.

672
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,753
No, don't say that. You didn't betray him.

673
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,206
You gave him a better life.

674
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,922
I still don't understand, though. I...

675
00:35:29,793 --> 00:35:33,764
Why do the breaches on our Earth
lead to different places on yours?

676
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,599
I don't know yet,

677
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:37,764
Ramon.

678
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,519
But I do know we have to close them all.

679
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,271
And I don't know how to do that.

680
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,730
You don't have to do it alone anymore.
Any of it.

681
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,445
Together, we defeated Grodd.

682
00:35:47,936 --> 00:35:48,983
And if we stay that way,

683
00:35:49,521 --> 00:35:52,445
we will figure out how to close
the breaches, get Zoom,

684
00:35:52,983 --> 00:35:54,110
and get you your daughter back.

685
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:57,952
Thank you.

686
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,583
Oh, this one is definitely a keeper.

687
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,880
(CHUCKLES) Oh, yeah.

688
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:09,838
He could've done just the standard
baking-soda-and-vinegar volcano,

689
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,172
but no.

690
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,838
Barry wanted to do
a molecular structure

691
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,052
- of chocolate and nougat.
- (CHUCKLES)

692
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,432
- It's my favorite candy bar.
- (LAUGHS)

693
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,847
Who does that in the sixth grade?

694
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,887
Why, a true science nerd.

695
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,394
- Like father, like son, I suppose.
- (IRIS WEST CHUCKLES)

696
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:25,775
(CHUCKLES)

697
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,275
All right, Dad. We should get going.

698
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,271
Yeah. Uh, Joe? Can I?

699
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:30,605
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

700
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:33,528
Iris.

701
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,405
Thank you so much
for reaching out to me.

702
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,327
I am so glad you did.

703
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:38,996
- Me, too.
- Mmm.

704
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:41,786
Joe,

705
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:43,581
there are no words, man.

706
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,210
Thanks.

707
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:51,259
All right. Um, I'm gonna swing by my lab
before I come home.

708
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:54,170
Which reminds me,
Patty, she's a smart girl.

709
00:36:54,753 --> 00:36:55,971
She's not buying your whole sick story.

710
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,264
All right.

711
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,389
Patty? Would this be a new girlfriend?

712
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,141
Uh, yeah.

713
00:37:02,344 --> 00:37:03,688
Something like that, yeah.

714
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:05,856
We'll talk about it on the way
to the bus station.

715
00:37:06,014 --> 00:37:07,186
Come on.

716
00:37:10,018 --> 00:37:11,144
- Bye.
- HENRY: See you.

717
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,695
You okay?

718
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:20,909
(SIGHS)

719
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,286
It's embarrassing. I... I love Barry

720
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:26,369
like he's my own son, but
when I'm reminded that he isn't,

721
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,043
I start to wonder
what it would've been like if, you know...

722
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,253
Dad, you would've been just as amazing
with your own son,

723
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,840
just like you were with me and Barry.

724
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,273
I hear you've been spending

725
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,983
a lot of time up here.

726
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:54,815
Well, you know what they say.

727
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,150
When the CSI's away...

728
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,902
It's good to see you on your feet again.

729
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,456
It must have been
all that canned soup you had.

730
00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:06,333
Or maybe the homemade stuff
Joe brought you.

731
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:11,585
(STUTTERS) Yeah.
I wasn't actually sick, Patty.

732
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,588
Yeah, I figured that out. (CHUCKLES)

733
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:15,634
(SIGHS)

734
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:19,885
Why did you lie to me?

735
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,594
My dad was in town.
I needed to spend some time with him.

736
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,686
You couldn't just tell me that?

737
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:32,273
You gotta understand, Patty.
My dad was convicted of murder.

738
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,313
When someone's image
has been tarnished like that,

739
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,447
it's hard for some people to see past it.

740
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,072
And you seriously think
I'm one of those people?

741
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,579
No, I know.
I should've given you more credit.

742
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,240
No, you should've given yourself
more credit.

743
00:38:47,449 --> 00:38:50,043
This isn't about your father, Barry.
This is about you.

744
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:55,925
I need to know that I can trust you,
if we're gonna do this.

745
00:38:58,418 --> 00:38:59,510
Okay.

746
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,135
I'm serious.

747
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:03,679
- (CHUCKLES)
- I can tell.

748
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,893
You cannot always be a smart ass.

749
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,367
- Hi.
- Hi.

750
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:32,166
I didn't know if you liked
flowers or chocolate. So...

751
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:34,710
I got you both.

752
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,715
Well, I'm allergic to chocolate

753
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,378
and I think that flowers
are a waste of money.

754
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,009
Um...

755
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:43,972
I have lollipops in my car?

756
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:46,266
Cisco, I'm joking.

757
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,597
- Oh, God.
- (LAUGHS)

758
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,978
This is great. Thank you.

759
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,894
Listen, I wanted to come over here

760
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:54,900
and say I'm sorry

761
00:39:56,184 --> 00:39:57,527
for bailing the other night.

762
00:39:58,061 --> 00:39:59,985
I'm a liaison with the C.C.P.D.,

763
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,695
and there was an emergency
and I had to be there.

764
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,443
- The C.C.P.D.?
- Yeah.

765
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,579
(CHUCKLES) Wow, that's really cool.

766
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,452
And very brave.

767
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,123
Thank you.

768
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:14,295
And this is very, very sweet, Cisco.

769
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,418
Um...

770
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:17,878
What is this?

771
00:40:18,248 --> 00:40:19,670
- Oh, see, that right there?
- Mmm-hmm.

772
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,844
That's a digital movie projector.

773
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,512
I loaded all of Princess Bride on there.

774
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,632
- (CHUCKLES)
- Mmm-hmm. That's right.

775
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,177
So, all we need is a wall or, you know,

776
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,768
someplace where we can

777
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,059
pick up our date where we left off.

778
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,851
Well, if we're going to pick up

779
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:39,277
right where we left it...

780
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,356
(CHUCKLES)

781
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:57,960
Whoa.

782
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,916
Whoa. What? What's wrong?

783
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:06,885
Nothing.

784
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,349
You're just a really amazing kisser.

785
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,557
(CHUCKLES)

786
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,518
Okay.

787
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:18,268
Let's go watch Princess Bride.

788
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:21,358
- Let's.
- There's a great wall up on the roof.

789
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:30,826
