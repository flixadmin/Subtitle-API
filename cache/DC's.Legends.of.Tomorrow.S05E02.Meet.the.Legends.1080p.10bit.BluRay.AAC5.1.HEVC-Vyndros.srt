1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,504
<i>[Kevin] The Legends of Tomorrow
are everywhere.</i>

2
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:07,757
<i>Since they defeated a demon with
the help of a dragon on national TV,</i>

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,510
<i>they've become a worldwide obsession.</i>

4
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:13,889
<i>Sure, we've all been mesmerized
by the global phenomenon</i>

5
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,390
<i>known as "Legends Mania."</i>

6
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:16,474
Yum.

7
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:20,770
And the Oscar for Best Picture
goes to...

8
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:25,150
<i>[Kevin] But who are the people beneath
those supersized public personas?</i>

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,445
<i>What are they like
when the spotlight is off?</i>

10
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,238
I'm Kevin Harris,

11
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:32,657
and my documentary film crew
is the first ever

12
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,951
to be granted unfettered access
to their lives

13
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,078
and their ship, the Waverider.

14
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:41,791
So, strap in, because today,
we meet the Legends.

15
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,466
[Kevin] So, why don't we start
with just a brief introduction?

16
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,760
And let us know what we're doing today
on the Waverider.

17
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:52,761
Uh, yeah.

18
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:56,264
Hi, I'm... I'm Ava Sharpe.

19
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,558
After Congress shut down
the Time Bureau,

20
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,185
Sara went off to help Oliver Queen...

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,438
...and, uh, I had to fight to keep
the Waverider from being impounded.

22
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,982
<i>Bad luck that the senator
chairing the committee was</i>

23
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,151
<i>the same person
we almost killed last year.</i>

24
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:11,404
Senator Wellington, I know the Time
Bureau may have been compromised...

25
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:14,574
...but you must allow the Waverider
to continue patrolling the timeline.

26
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,702
Ms. Sharpe, how do we know
these so-called "Legends"

27
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,621
can be trusted with time travel?

28
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,249
Oh, there's simply no transparency.

29
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:26,586
Which is why you all are here.
Right? To show everyone what we do.

30
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,964
What could go wrong?

31
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,258
<i>[Kevin] The Waverider
was surprisingly quiet</i>

32
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,426
<i>because half the team
was away on a mission.</i>

33
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,305
Oh, the crossover.
Yeah, had to take a rain check.

34
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:41,726
See, when you are a superhero!
amusement park impresario...

35
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,354
.../historian that rises from the dead,

36
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,982
your dance card tends
to get pretty full. [chuckles]

37
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,194
<i>- For two full minutes, I was not alive.
-[guitar strumming]</i>

38
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,697
<i>That changes you, man.</i>

39
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,032
<i>Don't get me wrong, I love fame.</i>

40
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,660
<i>No one says no to you about anything.</i>

41
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,371
Hey, man, that's a cool hat.
Can I have it?

42
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,542
But still, something doesn't feel right.

43
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,549
Oh, sorry.

44
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,758
Hang on.

45
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,512
There we go.

46
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,764
<i>[Behrad] Hi, I'm Behrad Tarazi.</i>

47
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,182
I guess you probably think I'm some kind

48
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,060
of awesome future man
since I'm from 2044.

49
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:29,149
<i>My literal birthday was yesterday,
which is pretty wild, man.</i>

50
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,734
[baby cries]

51
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,737
That's me. Hey, baby Behrad.

52
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,573
Be easy and go with the flow.

53
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,534
Like Wu-Tang Clan and Bruce Lee.

54
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,953
I mean, now, that we're no longer
D-list superheroes,

55
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,872
we can just go where we want.

56
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,040
Do as we please.

57
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,708
Why have I stuck around?

58
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,711
Tell you the truth,
I have no bloody clue.

59
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,130
I am bored as a post, ain't I?

60
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,966
Gids, I'm nicking the Jumpship,
all right?

61
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,384
I'll see you when I see you.

62
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,428
[Gideon] The Jumpship is fully totemed.

63
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,348
She's a mad old bat,
that one. [chuckles]

64
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,978
Hi, I'm Mona Wu. I'm a Kaupe.

65
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,733
That's basically like a werewolf,
but Hawaiian.

66
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,363
I'm also a literary agent for...

67
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,531
<i>...romance novelist Rebecca Silver,</i>

68
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,575
[whispers] who is secretly Mick Rory.

69
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:24,704
Jeez, Peter, take me out on a date first
before you try to... You know.

70
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,707
<i>Basically, what I do is,
I sell movie rights,</i>

71
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,001
<i>get book advances, that kind of stuff.</i>

72
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:33,046
You're telling me that
you don't have a single dollar

73
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,215
for a Rebecca Silver book advance?

74
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,342
Okay, now you're not
just disrespecting me,

75
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,427
[distorted voice]
you're disrespecting my client!

76
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,512
[Wolfie roars]

77
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,640
Not now!

78
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,017
Pay up, or I will thrash you!

79
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,144
[growls]

80
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,272
Hi, I'm, uh, Gary Green.

81
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:56,569
Um, if I had to sum myself up
in two words, they would be, uh...

82
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,904
fully forgiven. [chuckles]

83
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,491
A lot of things happened last year
that you could misconstrue

84
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,284
as potentially maybe being my fault.

85
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:07,539
<i>But thankfully, everyone agrees that
at worst, I was just a hapless rube</i>

86
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:11,376
<i>who got manipulated by
the forces of hell to betray humanity.</i>

87
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,712
<i>Uh, I had a Fairy Godmother named Nora,
but we separated amicably</i>

88
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,965
after she granted me
my heart's deepest wish.

89
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,468
Gary, what the hell are you doing?
Come on. We got bigger fish to fry.

90
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,846
Nora made me Constantine's apprentice.

91
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,180
[Constantine] Gary!

92
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,265
Call me!

93
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,771
[Kevin] So, uh, how does your girlfriend
feel about the documentary being made?

94
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:36,234
Actually I haven't told Sara
about the documentary yet.

95
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,653
I just think it was a little awkward
over the phone.

96
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,948
<i>It's.., it's better to spring it on her
when she gets back from the big mission.</i>

97
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,826
Okay, big smiles, everyone.

98
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,328
And nobody mention Oliver Queen.

99
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,580
<i>Why'?</i>

100
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:50,665
Because he died.

101
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,292
Shouldn't have done the crossover.

102
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,710
[door opens]

103
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,756
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

104
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,884
-[Ray] Yay, team!
- Yeah.

105
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,594
[exclaim]

106
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,678
[all] Bros!

107
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,472
Orange drink or limeade?

108
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,806
Alcohol.

109
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,975
Hey, love. Welcome back, baby.

110
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,018
Mmm.

111
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,687
- What is going on?
- Before you object, let me explain.

112
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,191
The only way that I could stop Senator
Wellington from cutting off our funding,

113
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,569
was to be clear and transparent
about our process.

114
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,820
Get it?

115
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,823
So, you're shooting a documentary
about the Legends?

116
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,867
Not me per se... [clears throat]

117
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,744
Hi, Captain Lance. Huge fan.

118
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,747
Uh, I'm the director, Kevin Harris.
You can call me "Kev."

119
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,791
Uh, just carry on, do what you're doing.
We're not even here.

120
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,586
That's Kev. He's got it under control.

121
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:41,633
And what if I wanna talk about
something in private?

122
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,886
It's not a problem. That's what
the confessional interviews are for.

123
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:49,140
Oh. [scoffs] Okay, so I can...
I could just say it to the camera.

124
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:52,018
- Sure.
- My girlfriend, she's lost her mind.

125
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,978
[chuckles awkwardly]

126
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,897
She just...
She really probably needs a nap.

127
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,649
She gets a little sleepy
after a long mission.

128
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,026
Um... Oh, Mick!

129
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,487
Why don't you tell us all
what you do on the ship, huh?

130
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,323
I steal stuff.
Get out of my way, you putz.

131
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,868
Okay. [laughs nervously]
He's just joking. Uh, Ray!

132
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,788
Who else saved the multi-verse?

133
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,166
Oh. Uh, well, the Flash, Supergirl,

134
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,834
- Batwoman...
- Cool.

135
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,169
- Yeah.
- What, no Superman?

136
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,587
Couldn't have been that big a deal.

137
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,089
Oh, no, no, Superman was there.

138
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,632
He's very handsome.

139
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,051
- It's good to have you back, buddy.
- Yeah.

140
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,136
Hey, we're missing someone.

141
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,888
Where's Charlie?

142
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,390
Took the Jumpship for a joyride.

143
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,518
Oh, a joyride to check the timeline.

144
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,728
Right? It's called a time scout.

145
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,856
Now, who wants to visit
the temporal zone? Shall we?

146
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:45,613
[man grunts] Guys, I'm still outside!
I'm still outside!

147
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,906
Don't leave me!

148
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,159
Hi, I'm Ray Palmer. The Atom. [chuckles]

149
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:54,455
This documentary is an exciting
opportunity for me to improve my image.

150
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,584
<i>A lot of people still confuse me
for the demon</i>

151
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,169
<i>who possessed me
and opened up the gates of hell.</i>

152
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,464
<i>His name was Neron,
and he is no longer with me.</i>

153
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,425
Or inside me, or...

154
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,344
I really wish that you could
meet my girlfriend Nora.

155
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,973
Uh, but she works

160
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,442
[Mona gasps] Is this a Timequake?

161
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:28,031
See? I knew the timeline was
still in jeopardy. What do we got?

162
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,867
Time pirates? Time terrorism?
Time sex tourism?

163
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,160
Wow, Ava.

164
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,329
You could be a supervillain
if you applied yourself.

165
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,247
Gideon, what's the point of origin?

166
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,876
[Gideon] It appears my Jonah Hex has...
Beebo loves.., loves you.

167
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,419
Gideon may have a virus.

168
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,755
Doesn't she make everything work?

169
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,048
We are perfectly safe.

170
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,551
Guys, that was a Class 5 Timequake!
That is so dangerous.

171
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,596
Okay, guys, let's just try to
keep our composure, shall we?

172
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:55,892
I've triangulated the Timequake
to 1917 St. Petersburg, Russia.

173
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,561
Let's go and shrink the problem.

174
00:07:58,645 --> 00:07:59,812
- Uh...
- Not good.

175
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,689
I'm developing a catchphrase?

176
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,775
[Gideon] Executing time jump now.

177
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,861
No, Gideon,
we're not taking a film crew to...

178
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:14,327
Imperial Russia. Yeah, great.

179
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,787
This is great, Ray.

180
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,832
[Nate] All right, Legends,
put on your babushkas

181
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,378
because we are rushing into Russia.

182
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,755
And now, you're copying my thing.

183
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,298
[Nate] Totally.
I just got really excited.

184
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,342
Okay, listen, babe,
this may seem like a problem,

185
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,594
but let's turn it into
a proble-tunity, huh?

186
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,972
Maybe a party-snake
is just what the doctor ordered.

187
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,350
Uh, what's a party-snake?

188
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,852
"Sneak." Party-sneak.

189

it's more of a fun funeral-sneak.

193
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,199
Who died?

194
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,202
[Nate] Grigori Rasputin,
aka The Mad Monk.

195
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,497
Equal parts mystic advisor
and manipulative hornball.

196
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,417
[Ray] Rasputin was
notoriously hard to kill.

197
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,837
It took cyanide, a gun,
and drowning before he stayed dead.

we sure he stayed dead?

204
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:29,193
Rasputin came back from the dead,
and it caused a Timequake.

205
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,780
Ugh, this is the kind of problem
that I can wrap my head around.

206
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,158
So, I need you guys

207
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,660
to forget about
this documentary film crew

208
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,829
and focus on the mission at hand. Yes?

209
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,623
Yes, we need to minimize the mishap.

210
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,459
[Agent Sharpe] Oh, right,
that's good, because

211
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,794
saving the day
is what the Legends do best.

-[Nate whispers] Ava, you're in my shot.
- Oh, sorry.

Gideon, what does
the historical record say?

214
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,927
[Gideon] Perhaps time loop.., time loop
released him from Marion Ravenwood.

215
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,053
Of course!

216
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,556
Okay, B-money, with me.

217
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,267
We're gonna fix Gideon,
get our guests back to 2020.

218
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,854
Mona, Nate, Ray,
I want you three researching Rasputin.

219
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,481
Figure out
what his next move's gonna be.

220
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,982
Okay? Let's do it.

221
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,570
[Agent Sharpe] Hey, Ray, sorry.
But just...

222
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,614
Hey...

223
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,993
-is everything okay with Sara?
- Oh, um, I don't know,

224
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,455
but I do know that Oliver's death
was pretty tough on her.

225
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,290
Yeah.

226
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:27,710
Maybe you should write Sara
a condolence card.

227
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,259
That's actually not a bad idea.
I guess I could

228
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,429
put my thoughts and feelings into words
on a card.

229
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:43,017
What if more baddies started coming back
throughout history?

230
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:47,522
If they do,
we can call 'em "evil do-overs."

231
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,856
"Villa-agains."

232

-[Nate] Mmm...
- It's a good idea.

234

- We could take a vote. Like a team vote.
- Okay, let's vote.

00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,741
- Encores.
- Villa-agains.

Encores.

but I hope you never loved him at all."

302

Sara and I aren't the type
to give each other cards, anyway.

303
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,545
I'd rather do something for her,

304
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,589
you know, like fix this
Rasputin situation and get the Legends

305
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,759
the heck out of Russia
before they screw something up.

306
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,263
Uh, you can cut the last part
of that out, right?

307
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,350
Apparently, when Rasputin cured
the Tsarina's only son,

308
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,936
<i>the two fell madly in love.</i>

309
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,649
I think if Rasputin realized
how much the Tsarina loved him,

00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,755
God has spared Rasputin again!

468
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:21,256
Kill her!

469
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,134

[roars]

475
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,278
Nate, I'm coming for you, buddy.

476
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:53,330
- Nate, snap out of it.
-[grunts]

477
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,374
- I remember her, Ray.
- Who?

478
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,043
I don't know her name,
but she was on the ship with us.

479
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,671
[grunts] Mission's blown.
We need to retreat.

480
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,839
<i>[Mick] I'm not done with you, you rats!</i>

481
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,508
<i>Good thing Sara's not watching this.</i>

[exhales]

483
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,181
[sighs]

484
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,692
[Sara] So, you guys decided to go off
on your own and face Rasputin?

485
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,485
I thought I could calm him down.

486
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,862
I thought I could make him fall in love.

487
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,782
And I thought I could,
you know, assassinate him.

488
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:33,412
None of that was ever going to happen.
He's fresh out of Hell.

489
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,748
- Well, let's kill him, then.
- You.., you can't!

490
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,875
Look, John said that he can't be killed

491
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,461
while the chit of his soul
is in hell, or...

492
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,338
Whatever that means.

493
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,715
Look, Sara, we're really sorry.

494
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,592
We thought we could
make things easier for you

495
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,260
by.., by taking this off of your plate.

496
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,012
And risking your own necks?

497
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,973
Look, I already have
one dead friend on my plate,

498
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,057
I'm good there.

499
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,767
And you know,

500
00:23:56,435 --> 00:24:00,063
none of you self-absorbed megastars
even bothered

501
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,274
to ask me how I was doing.

502
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:05,694
Look, Sara, I...
I told them not to mention Oliver, okay?

503
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,821
I thought you wouldn't
want to be reminded.

504
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,114
Reminded?

505
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:10,699
What...

506
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:14,369
Did you think that I could just forget
that my friend died?

507
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,704
No, I...

508
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,706
Look, I know things have been
crazy around here.

509
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,458
[Sara] Crazy around here?

510
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:23,503
You still have no idea
what I saw out there.

511
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,505
What did happen?

512
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,843
Countless Earths died.

513
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:34,014
I became a Paragon
and traveled back to the Big Bang.

514
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,641
We restarted the universe,

515
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,268
and now, no one even remembers
what we've changed.

516
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,481
- It's a lot to process.
- Yeah, I know.

517
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:47,736
So, you could see why I want to
talk to my friends about it,

518
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,322
and instead, I get cameras

519
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,033
in my face.

520
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,288
<i>[Agent Sharpe] "Agent Sharpe
lacks</i> a <i>delicate touch</i>

521
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:01,708
and is extremely deficient
at relating to people." [scoffs]

522
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:05,379
That is straight from
my Time Bureau personnel review.

523
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,422
Pretty harsh.

524
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,009
I wrote that review.

525
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,845
Yeah, of course I'm bummed
that we let Sara down,

526
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,932
but I am glad I got to meet Rasputin.
Little help?

527
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,101
[whooshing]

528
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:24,898
[grunts] I mean, the guy
got in my head and laid a bomb.

529
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:27,693
- He freaked your bean, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

530
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:31,613
He also told me about the mystery woman
that I was in love with before I died.

531
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,199
I know it sounds crazy, but it just...

532
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,534
It feels right.

533
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,953
Sounds like you got
some soul searching to do.

534
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,038
Wanna watch
<i>How Stella Got Her Groove Back</i> again?

535
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,209
No, my groove feels fine.

536
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:47,587
You think I have either split memory
or partial amnesia?

537
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,507
That's like what's happening
with Gideon.

538
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,509
Her memory is processing
what I thought was phantom data,

539
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,636
but maybe it's real data
from a different timeline.

540
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,724
Either you're a computer who caught
the same virus as Gideon...

541
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:02,269
Or, when we fixed Heyworld,
we changed the timeline.

542
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,229
Damn, we deducted the hell outta that.

543
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,188
I have to tell Sara.

544
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,399
Wait. Five minutes. Five minutes.
Stay on the inversion table.

545
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,109
Your back's gonna thank me.

546
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:14,364
[sighs] Okay, so clearly, we shouldn't
have avoided asking Sara about Oliver,

547
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,700
but in my defense,
I was desperately afraid

548
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,493
I was gonna say the wrong thing,
you know?

549
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,539
I don't know what she needs, and
everything I try seems to make it worse.

550
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,960
Hold on, Behrad, so, you're saying

551
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,920
Gideon's glitching
because we fractured time?

552
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,756
Look, at least we didn't break time.

553
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,966
We just sort of dinged it up.

554
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,718
<i>- Hello?</i>

555
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,387

Now, what was it that man

559
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,356
Yes.

Mr. Kevin Harris.</i>

562
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,282
They left the director behind?

<i>I've invited my dearest Tsarina
and her family over for dinner.</i>

564

Tonight

565
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:06,124
will be a night
that you can remember. [laughs]

566
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,128
That.., that doesn't sound right.

567
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,213
What?

568
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,507
The.., the laugh.
You need to nail the laugh

569
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,592
before we kill the Romanovs
and take the throne.

570
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,886
It's a work in progress.
How about this...

571
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,554
[clears throat]

572
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,350
[laughing maniacally]

573
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,936
He's gonna kill the Romanovs.

574
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,480
Making him an immortal Tsar.

575
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,566
We can handle this.

576
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,276
We can? What about the team?

577
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:36,822
Shh. They're not thinking straight,
and their cover's blown.

578
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,740
Look, this is up to you and me, B.

579
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,076
We're gonna stop
this assassination alone.

580
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,702
Yes.

581
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,663
Yes.

582
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:55,882
What's this?
Is this a smudge on this goblet?

583
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,927
Every detail must be perfect.

584
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,264
Tonight, I am dining
with the Imperial Family.

585
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,599
Take it back.

586
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,271
They are going to love the tea cakes.

587
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,983
I've laced them with cyanide. [chuckles]

588
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,987
Hello? Kevin? Right here.

589
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,783
- Your guests have arrived.
- The Romanovs are here!

590
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,494
Welcome.

591
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,957
It is such a shame that
your daughters could not attend.

592
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,127
I know how much they must have missed
their Uncle Rasputin.

593
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,964
Word of your death
sent them into mourning,

594
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:39,342
but none were so heartbroken as I.

595
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,468
[Rasputin] on.

596
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:42,846
Music!

597
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:52,314
How did you manage to survive
being poisoned, shot,

598
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,025
and thrown into the river, Grigori?

599
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,027
Oh, I have a very hearty constitution.

600
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:00,739
Damn it.

601
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,909
The Red Wedding's about to start,
and I don't see the tea cakes anywhere.

602
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,120
[Behrad whispers] All I see is cookies.

603
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,165
Tea cakes? My favorite.

604
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,709
The cookies are the tea cakes.

605
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,505
What is the meaning of this?

606
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,717
Forgive me, sire, I saw a bug.

607
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,223
Grigori, what is going on?

608
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,600
<i>What have you done?</i>

609
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,144
Oops. I think we forgot the cameraman.

610
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,230
That's Kevin, the director.
He's really more of an auteur.

611
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,941
We should get out there.

612
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,734
Sara clearly wants to handle this alone.

613
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,028
But are we gonna let her?

614
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,657
Go.

615
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,827
Nicholas, Alexei, come.

616
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,079
Wait!

617
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:52,916
You will stay exactly where you are.

618
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,002
For years, I have flattered you both,

619
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,755
our subjects adore you,

620
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:01,049
the army needs you,

621
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,469
and look at the state
of our beloved Russia.

622
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,637
[Sara] Hey.

623
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,723
Let me guess, you're the only one
that can save it.

624
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,601
- Not today, Grigori.

- What the hell?
- Raw meat.

did you get the shot, Kevin?

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean,
it's obvious that this is all fake.

wiped out half the population.

Why wouldn't we just find baby Hitler
and make him wrestle baby Stalin?

All right, everybody,

everything you see on camera.

[Agent Sharpe] Not isolated?
What do you mean?

772

- Okay. Hey, whoa! No, no, don't do it...
- Don't!

00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:59,212
I always do, love. I always do.

785
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:06,052
[reciting incantation]

786
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,139
[sighs]

787
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,892
You know,
sometimes what happens on this ship

788
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,394
really would be hard
for an audience to follow.

789
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,401
That love letter you wrote,

790
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:23,778
it was good.

791
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,364
Very good.

792
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:30,952
Gee, thank you, Mick.
This means so much coming from you.

793
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:35,957
Listen, um, I'm giving up the writing.
It's getting in the way of my thievery.

794
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,585
So, I'm handing the Rebecca Silver
novels over to you.

795
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,003
Someone deserving.

796
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,550
<i>Me'?</i>

797
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,804
This is... This is so much.
Are you sure?

798
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,139
Yes, I'm sure. That's why I'm saying it.

799
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,353
There's a novelist inside you.

800
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,899
There's more inside of me
than just Wolfie?

801
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,026
Yes. That's right.

802
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:11,242
Well, it was great living with you
on the Waverider.

803
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:15,538
- What?
- Yeah, I... I can't stay here to write.

804
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,331
I need to be free.

805
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,543
I need to fall in love and break hearts.

806
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:23,504
I can't do Rebecca Silver justice here.

807
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:24,422
But... But I--

808
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,383
But you tried writing on the ship
and ran out of ideas?

809
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:28,509
I mean, frankly, Mick,

810
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:32,513
<i>your latest novel Carjacked, it sucked.</i>

811
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:37,310
But don't worry. Rebecca Silver
is about to have her comeback.

812
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,104
You'll see.

813
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,110
You were my favorite.

814
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,369
How's it going, Gideon?

815
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,913
[Gideon] The phantom memory scrub
is proceeding without a hitch.

816
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:01,250
The flaws only go
as far back as the last two years.

817
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,044
Oh, it feels good
to get my thoughts straight.

818
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,712
Good work, Gidi.

819
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,465
- I'm turning in.
- Good night, B.

820
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,967
- Don't stay up too late, Nate.
- You got it.

821
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,552
-[Gideon] Dr. Heywood?
- Mmm.

822
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,013
I have encountered a glitch
during the Heyworld event.

823
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,182
Show me.

824
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:32,740
<i>Nate...</i>

825
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,702
<i>if you're seeing this,
we altered my future at Heyworld.</i>

826
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,829
<i>I don't know where I'll be
or who I'll be, but...</i>

827
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,915
<i>I know that I love you.</i>

828
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,377
<i>Find me.</i>

829
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:49,632
Gideon! Gideon, who was that?
Play it again.

830
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,342
[Gideon] Memory scrub complete.
