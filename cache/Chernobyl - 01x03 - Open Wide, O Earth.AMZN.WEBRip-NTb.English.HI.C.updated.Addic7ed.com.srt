Now, I'm afraid, a long war must begin.

There is an enormous
amount of radioactive debris

589
00:47:37,657 --> 00:47:39,857
and contamination
spread out across a zone

590
00:47:39,859 --> 00:47:42,393
of approximately 2600 square kilometers.

591
00:47:42,395 --> 00:47:47,864
This entire region must
be completely evacuated.

592
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:52,036
We must go to every town,
every village to ensure this.

593
00:47:52,038 --> 00:47:57,974
And all animals still
surviving within the zone,

594
00:47:57,976 --> 00:48:01,011
whether domesticated or wild,

595
00:48:01,013 --> 00:48:05,015
must be presumed contaminated
and will have to be destroyed

596
00:48:05,017 --> 00:48:08,452
to prevent the spread
of radiation and disease.

597
00:48:08,454 --> 00:48:11,955
In the immediate area
surrounding Chernobyl,

598
00:48:11,957 --> 00:48:17,527
uh, every rock, every tree,
the very ground itself,

599
00:48:17,529 --> 00:48:21,798
has absorbed a dangerous
amount of radionuclides,

600
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,568
which will be carried by the
wind and the rain if left exposed.

601
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:27,003
So we will have to raze entire forests.

602
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:29,138
We will have to rip up
the top layer of earth

603
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,540
and bury it under itself,

604
00:48:30,542 --> 00:48:34,110
approximately, 100 square kilometers.

605
00:48:35,714 --> 00:48:39,182
Um, and finally, we
will need to construct

606
00:48:39,184 --> 00:48:44,220
a containment structure
around the power plant itself,

607
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:47,824
which will, of course,
still be extremely...

608
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:52,395
There will be deaths.

609
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,567
What amount of time,

610
00:48:57,569 --> 00:48:59,235
and how many men do you require?

611
00:48:59,237 --> 00:49:03,106
We expect this liquidation
effort to take three years

612
00:49:03,108 --> 00:49:05,475
and approximately 750,000 men,

616

I mean no disrespect, but I was
wondering if you could tell me why.

I assure you, I don't know
who you're talking about.

She was arrested by the KGB.

You are the first deputy
chairman of the KGB.

I am.

628

That's why I don't have to bother
with arresting people anymore.

629
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:03,231
But you are bothering
with having us followed.

630
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,035
I think the deputy chairman is busy.

631
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:09,204
No, no. It's perfectly understandable.

Comrade, I know you've
heard the stories about us.

When I hear them, even I am shocked.

634
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,679
But we are not what people say.

635
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,515
Yes, people are following you.

636
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:23,017

They follow me.

00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,501
- You really don't trust us?
- Of course I do.

643
00:50:40,503 --> 00:50:43,549
But you know the old Russian proverb:

"Trust but verify."

And the Americans think that

Good day, Professor.

653
00:51:24,813 --> 00:51:28,482
No, that went surprisingly well.

654
00:51:28,484 --> 00:51:30,718
You came off like a naive idiot.

- Are you all right?
- They didn't hurt me.

658
00:52:05,353 --> 00:52:07,953
They let a pregnant woman
into a room with a...

You want to stop?

00:52:35,616 --> 00:52:38,149
Is that a choice I even have?

668
00:52:46,226 --> 00:52:49,727
Do you think the fuel will actually
melt through the concrete pad?

669
00:52:49,729 --> 00:52:53,331
I don't know. A 40% chance maybe.

670
00:52:55,768 --> 00:52:58,636
I said 50. (CHUCKLES)

671

mean the same thing:

(SIGHING)

674

Maybe the core will melt
through to the groundwater.

675
00:53:08,314 --> 00:53:10,781
Maybe the miners who I've
told to dig under the reactor

00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:13,250
will save millions of lives.

Maybe I'm killing them for nothing.

678
00:53:20,793 --> 00:53:22,893
I don't want to do this anymore.

679
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:25,896
I want to stop.

680

But I can't.

and you will stop at nothing

Because that is who you are.

(DOOR UNLOCKING)

Did you know that they
were running a safety test?

692
00:54:23,221 --> 00:54:26,055
- Yeah.
- There's something else.

693
00:54:27,292 --> 00:54:30,593
Akimov says they shut the reactor down,

694
00:54:30,595 --> 00:54:32,995
and Toptunov confirms it.

695
00:54:32,997 --> 00:54:36,723
- They pressed AZ-5.
- Apparently not soon enough.

696
00:54:36,726 --> 00:54:38,325
No.

697
00:54:38,328 --> 00:54:43,031
They say Akimov pressed AZ-5,

698
00:54:43,034 --> 00:54:45,735
and then the reactor exploded.

them, I would have put it under

701
00:54:52,616 --> 00:54:56,485
but they both agreed. They were adamant.

Comrade?

703
00:55:04,495 --> 00:55:08,597
- Do you think it's possible?
- I think it makes no sense.

704
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:11,800
I think it's what I would say if I
was trying to cover my own mistakes.

705
00:55:11,802 --> 00:55:13,435
But?

706
00:55:14,505 --> 00:55:16,304
I believed them.

707
00:55:18,342 --> 00:55:19,908
Then you should pursue it.

708
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:23,979
We have to pursue every possibility,
