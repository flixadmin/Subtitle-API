1
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,420
It's the sense of touch.

2
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,260
What?

3
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,270
Any real city you walk
you know?

4
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,210
You brush past people.
People bump into you.

5
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,310
In L.A. nobody touches you.

6
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,320
We're always behind
this metal and glass.

7
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,690
I think we miss
that touch so much

8
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,760
that we crash into each other
just so we can feel something.

9
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,960
You guys okay?

10
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,090
I think he hit his head.

11
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,030
You don't think that's true?

12
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,040
Stay in your car.

13
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,940
Graham I think
we got rear-ended.

14
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,100
I think we spun around twice.

15
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,180
And somewhere in there one of us lost
our frame of reference.

16
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,680
And I'm gonna
go look for it.

17
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,520
- Calm down ma'am.
- I am calm!

18
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,560
I need to see your registration
and insurance.

19
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,660
Why? It's not my fault! It's her fault!

20
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,460
- She do this!
- My fault?

21
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,620
Ma'am you really need
to wait in your vehicle.

22
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,630
- My fault?
- Stop in middle of street!

23
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,400
Mexicans no know how to drive.

24
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,200
- She "blake" too fast.
- I "blake" too fast? I "blake" too fast.

25
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,010
- I'm sorry you no see my "blake" lights.
- Ma'am.

26
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,910
See I stop when I see a long line of cars
stopped in front of me.

27
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,850
Maybe you see over
steering wheel you "blake" too!

28
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,480
- Ma'am!
- I call immigration. Look what you do my car.

29
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,280
Officer can you please
write in your report

30
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,360
how shocked I am to be hit
by an Asian driver!

31
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,660
- Ma'am!
- Ma'am no. See Detective...

32
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,870
All right. You've got
to calm down.

33
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,610
- Hey Detective! Nice entrance.
- Fuck you.

34
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,020
- Hey you okay?
- I'm freezin'.

35
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,890
Shit. I heard
it might snow.

36
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,360
- Get outta here.
- That's what I heard.

37
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,230
- You got a smoke?
- Nah. I quit.

38
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,960
Yeah me too.

39
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,570
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

40
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,010
Hey Bob.

41
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,050
You get one free box of ammunition.
What kind do you want?

42
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,840
Yo Osama! Plan a jihad
on your own time.

43
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,540
What do you want?

44
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,480
- Are you making insult at me?
- Am I making insult "at" you?

45
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,880
- Is that the closest you can come to English?
- Yes I speak English! I am American citizen.

46
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,420
- Oh God here we go.
- I have right like you.

47
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,390
- I have right to buy gun.
- Not in my store you don't!

48
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,720
- Andy get him outta here now!
- Go wait in the car.

49
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,790
Now. Get out!

50
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,530
- You're an ignorant man!
- I'm ignorant? You're liberating my country

51
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,690
and I'm flying 747 s into your mud huts
and incinerating your friends?

52
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,810
- Get the fuck out!
- No you get the fuck out!

53
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,570
No don't touch me!
He cheat me!

54
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,570
- Andy now!
- Let's go.

55
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,180
Okay.

56
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,720
You can give me the gun
or give me back the money.

57
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,120
And I am really hoping
for the money.

58
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,190
- What kind of ammunition do you want?
- Whatever fits.

59
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,260
We got a lot of kinds.

60
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,730
We got long colts
short colts bull heads

61
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,390
flat nose hollowpoints
wide cutters

62
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,940
and a dozen more that'll fit
any size hole.

63
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,800
Just depends upon how
much bang you can handle.

64
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,010
I'll take the ones
in the red box.

65
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,850
- You know what those are?
- Can I have them?

66
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,660
Did you see any white people waitin' an hour
and 32 minutes for a plate of spaghetti?

67
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,700
And how many cups of coffee
did we get?

68
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,670
You don't drink coffee!
And I didn't want any.

69
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,540
Man that woman poured cup after cup
to every single white person around us.

70
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,700
But did she even ask you
if you wanted any?

71
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,780
We didn't get any coffee that you didn't want
and I didn't order

72
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,110
and that's evidence
of racial discrimination?

73
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,220
Did you notice
that our waitress was black?

74
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,790
And black women don't think
in stereotypes?

75
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,860
You tell me. When was
the last time you met one

76
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,320
who didn't think she knew
everything about your lazy ass

77
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,650
before you even opened
your mouth huh?

78
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,090
That waitress sized us up
in two seconds.

79
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,890
We're black and black people don't tip.
She wasn't gonna waste her time.

80
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,000
Somebody like that? Nothing you can do
to change their mind.

81
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,540
How much did you leave?

82
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,610
You expect me to pay
for that kind of service?

83
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,110
What? What the fuck
is you laughin' at man?

84
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,180
I'm seriously starting to think that
you're jealous of Karen.

85
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,480
Hardly. I'd just like to see you get through
a meal without calling her or anyone else.

86
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,120
Okay no more phone calls. As a matter of fact
you can hold the battery.

87
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,060
Okay?

88
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,860
Ten bucks says
she calls you in the car.

89
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,660
Wait wait wait.
See what that woman just did?

90
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,830
- You see that?
- She's cold.

91
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,230
She got colder
as soon as she saw us.

92
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,470
- Ah come on don't start.
- Man look around you man.

93
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,050
You couldn't find a whiter safer or better-lit
part of this city right now.

94
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,040
But yet this white woman
sees two black guys

95
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,840
who look like UCLA students
strolling down the sidewalk

96
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,380
and her reaction
is blind fear?

97
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,990
Look at us dog. Are we dressed
like gangbangers?

98
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,420
Huh? No.
Do we look threatening? No.

99
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,430
Fact. If anybody should be
scared around here it's us!

100
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,500
We're the only two black faces surrounded
by a sea of over-caffeinated white people

101
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,300
patrolled by
the trigger-happy L.A.P.D.

102
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,960
So you tell me.
Why aren't we scared?

103
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,270
'Cause we got guns?

104
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,170
You could be right.

105
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,480
- Get the fuck outta the car!
- Gimme the keys!

106
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,310
- Hurry up! Get down!
- Okay okay okay okay.

107
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:56,650
- No no! Please!
- Don't look at me! Turn around!

108
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,280
- Come on! Go!
- We're fine! Just keep moving!

109
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:09,940
No no no! Take that voodoo-assed thing
off of there right now.

110
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,330
I know you just didn't call
Saint Christopher voodoo.

111
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,300
Man's the patron saint
of travelers dog.

112
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,270
You had a conversation
with God huh? What did God say?

113
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,510
"Go forth my son and leave big slobbery
suction rings on every dashboard you find"?

114
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,120
Why the hell do you do that?

115
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,050
Look at the way your crazy ass drive
then ask me again.

116
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,330
Chevy pickup and Mercedes
driving north on Balboa.

117
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,130
Pickup cuts in front. Driver of the Mercedes
gets pissed pulls a gun.

118
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,930
Doesn't realize the guy in the pickup is a cop
coming off shift.

119
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,000
This Barry Gibb dude is a cop?

120
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,470
Yeah. Name's Conklin.
He's a narc out of Wilshire.

121
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,200
I got the Mercedes.

122
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,940
Mercedes takes a shot at him.
Detective Conklin returns fire. One shot.

123
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,610
Mercedes rolls to a stop.
Driver opens the door falls out dead.

124
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,510
He looks very relaxed
for just having shot somebody.

125
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,480
He says he kept tryin'
to drive away.

126
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,720
The Mercedes kept pulling up next to him
screaming waving a gun.

127
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,360
Shot back in self-defense.

128
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:10,660
- Anybody actually see who shot first?
- They just heard two bangs.

129
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,590
Find me a witness.

130
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,540
That is a nice gun.

131
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,210
The car's registered
to a Cindy Bradley.

132
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,220
And that's not Cindy.

133
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,090
That is a William Lewis.

134
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,200
Found under the front seat.
Hollywood Division.

135
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,600
Looks like Detective Conklin
shot himself the wrong nigger.

136
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,310
- How much longer are you gonna be?
- This is the last one.

137
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,350
Thank you.

138
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,460
You don't think reporters
listen to police calls?

139
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,360
I need to talk to you
for a second.

140
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,700
You just give me a minute
all right?

141
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,330
- Find Flanagan will you? Now.
- Yes sir.

142
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,380
Yes honey?

143
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,450
I want the locks changed
again in the morning.

144
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,510
You want...

145
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,240
Why don't you just go lie down?
Have you checked on James?

146
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,650
Of course. I've checked on him every five
minutes since we've been home.

147
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,660
Do not patronize me. I want the locks
changed again in the morning.

148
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,020
It's okay. Just go to bed.

149
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,630
You know didn't I just ask you
not to treat me like a child?

150
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,990
I'm sorry Miss Jean.

151
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,530
Is okay I go home now?

152
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,430
It's fine. Thank you
very much for staying.

153
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,560
- You're welcome no problem. Good night.
- Good night.

154
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,170
We'll see you tomorrow.

155
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:05,370
I would like the locks
changed again in the morning.

156
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,810
And you might mention
that we'd appreciate it

157
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,080
if next time they didn't send
a gang member.

158
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,520
- A gang member? You mean that kid in there?
- Yes yes.

159
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:16,320
Yes. The guy with the shaved head
the pants around his ass the prison tattoo.

160
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,860
- Those are not prison tattoos.
- Oh really? And he's not gonna sell our key

161
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,520
to one of his gangbanger friends
the moment he is out our door?

162
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,560
We've had a tough night.

163
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,330
- It'd be best if you went...
- And wait for them to break in?

164
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,870
I just had a gun
pointed in my face.

165
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,100
You lower your voice!

166
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,970
And it was my fault
because I knew it was gonna happen.

167
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,580
But if a white person sees two black men
walking towards her

168
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,200
and she turns and walks in the other direction
she's a racist right?

169
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,910
Well I got scared
and I didn't say anything.

170
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,310
And ten seconds later
I had a gun in my face!

171
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:49,620
I am telling you. Your amigo in there is gonna
sell our key to one of his homies.

172
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,190
And this time it'd be really fucking great
if you acted like you actually gave a shit!

173
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,380
All right what have we got?
Talk to me Karen.

174
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,460
Flanagan doesn't think
anybody has the story yet.

175
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,930
I'm the goddamn District Attorney
of Los Angeles.

176
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,230
If my car gets jacked
it's gonna make news.

177
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,130
Fuck!

178
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,600
Why did these guys
have to be black?

179
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,140
I mean why?
No matter how we spin this

180
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,270
I'm either gonna lose the black vote
or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.

181
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:49,580
You're worrying too much. You have
a lot of support in the black community.

182
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,210
All right. If we can't duck this thing
we're gonna have to neutralize it.

183
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:56,910
What we need is a picture of me
pinning a medal on a black man.

184
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,990
Bruce?

185
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,820
The firefighter.

186
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,860
The one who saved the camp or something.
Northridge. What's his name?

187
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,970
He's Iraqi.

188
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,260
He's Iraqi?
Well he looks black.

189
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,170
He's dark-skinned sir but he's Iraqi.
His name's Saddam Khahum.

190
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,240
Saddam?
His-His name's Saddam?

191
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:21,510
That's real good Bruce. I'm gonna pin a medal
on an Iraqi named Saddam.

192
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,780
Give yourself a raise!

193
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,260
It's been good
doing business with you.

194
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,760
- How soon can I have them?
- I'm picking them up right now.

195
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:37,490
Look you're not listening to me.
This is an emergency.

196
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,460
I keep telling you he's in pain.
He can't sleep.

197
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,470
Mr. Ryan your father has been to the clinic
three times in the last month.

198
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,870
He is being treated for a urinary tract infection.
That is by no means an emergency.

199
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,340
If you have any more questions
about your HMO plan

200
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,780
make an appointment to come in between
10:00 and 4:00 Monday through Friday.

201
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,940
What does my father do
about sleeping tonight?

202
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,920
I don't know.
I'm not a doctor.

203
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,920
- I wanna talk to your supervisor.
- I am my supervisor!

204
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,820
- What is your name?
- Shaniqua Johnson.

205
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,620
Shaniqua.
Big fucking surprise that is.

206
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,280
Bronson Avenue Westwood.

207
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,080
Vehicle is described as a black
late-model Lincoln Navigator.

208
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,710
California plates
4 Peter Charles Ida 315.

209
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,260
Suspects are two black males
approximately 20 years of age.

210
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,830
That's not it. That's not the vehicle John.
The plates don't match.

211
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,670
The driver's gotta be 40. Nobody jacks a car
and takes it to Studio City.

212
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,180
They were doin' something!

213
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,790
Enthusiastic.

214
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,160
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em please.

215
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,500
I'm gonna need to see your driver's license
and registration.

216
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,760
No problem.

217
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,770
I'm gonna have to reach inside the glove
compartment to get the registration.

218
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,740
- Is that okay?
- Nice and slow please.

219
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,110
How are you tonight Officer?

220
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,080
Excellent.

221
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,360
Here you go.

222
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,990
Stay inside the vehicle please.

223
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:36,170
Let's do it again right now.

224
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,300
Step outta the car please sir.

225
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,110
Wait a minute Officer.
I haven't been drinking or anything.

226
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,440
Then we shouldn't have
a problem.

227
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,210
He doesn't drink.
He's a Buddhist for Christ's sake.

228
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,150
No it's okay.

229
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,780
It's fine.

230
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,560
Step onto the sidewalk sir.

231
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,660
That's good. Right there.

232
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,730
Look at me.

233
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,770
I want you to stand
on your right foot.

234
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:12,040
Touch your nose with the index finger
of your left hand.

235
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,010
I told you he doesn't drink.

236
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,780
Ma'am I'm only gonna tell you
one time to stay in the vehicle.

237
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,450
- Ma'am?
- Honey honey I'm okay. I got this.

238
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,820
Don't you "ma'am" me. Who the hell
do you think you're talking to?

239
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,230
Look Officer my wife
has had a couple of drinks...

240
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,300
Both of you turn around. Put your hands on
top of your head and interlock your fingers.

241
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,200
Wait. We're only a block
away from our house.

242
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,630
Hands on your head.
Interlock your fingers.

243
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,870
- Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.
- I'm a television director.

244
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,740
Me and my wife were just coming home
from an awards show.

245
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,110
Take your hands off him.
He's done nothing wrong.

246
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,370
Put your hands on top
of your head ma'am.

247
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,980
- Do what he says.
- Fuck you!

248
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,950
- Put your hands...
- And you keep your filthy hands off me!

249
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,720
You motherfucking pig!

250
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,320
- Just stop talking!
- That's quite a mouth you have.

251
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,190
Of course you know that.

252
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:06,060
Fuck you! That's what
this is all about isn't it?

253
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,960
You thought you saw a white woman blowin' a
black man. That drove your cracker ass crazy.

254
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,800
Will you just shut
your fucking mouth!

255
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,960
I'd listen to your husband ma'am.

256
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,370
Put your legs open.

257
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,410
Do you have any guns or knives
or anything I might get stuck with?

258
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,850
I'm wearing a cocktail dress.
What do you think?

259
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,450
You'd be surprised
some of the places I've found weapons.

260
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,520
He's clean.

261
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,390
What do you think we should do about this
Mr. Thayer?

262
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:38,060
My partner and I just witnessed your wife
performing fellatio on you

263
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,330
while you were operating
a motor vehicle.

264
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,530
That's reckless endangerment
which incidentally is a felony.

265
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:51,140
We could charge your wife with lewd conduct
and performing a sexual act in public.

266
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,180
You say you're a block
from home.

267
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,580
We could use our discretion

268
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,750
and let you go with a warning

269
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:05,290
or we could cuff you and put you
in the back of the car.

270
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,860
What do you think
we should do sir?

271
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:20,570
Look we're sorry and

272
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:26,200
we would appreciate if you would
just let us go with a warning please.

273
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,550
The man's apologizing Tommy.

274
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,710
I think we can let him go. Don't you?

275
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,050
Yeah.

276
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,360
All right.

277
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,300
You can go.

278
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,810
You folks drive safe now huh?

279
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,440
Let's go Tommy.

280
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,490
It won't close.

281
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,780
I can do that.

282
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,560
Dad you couldn't even
get it open.

283
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,560
Have respect for your father.
Give me the gun!

284
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,330
Here. Now you can shoot
anybody you want.

285
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,200
Dorri that man
could've killed your mother.

286
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,800
You think I should let crazy people
do what they want to us?

287
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,410
Farhad it won't close.

288
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,550
Dorri you should be at work.

289
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,930
Who are you calling?

290
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,660
I'm gonna report their asses.
Sons of bitches.

291
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,760
You actually believe they're gonna take
anything you have to say seriously?

292
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,770
Do you have any idea how that felt? To have
that pig's hands all over me?

293
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,740
And you just stood there!

294
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,940
And then you apologized
to him?

295
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,950
What did you want me to do?
Get us both shot?

296
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,540
They were gonna shoot us
on Ventura Boulevard! Pathetic.

297
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:51,350
Well maybe you would've been satisfied
with just being arrested.

298
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,330
Oh I get it. Much better to let him
shove his hand up my crotch

299
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,230
than get your name
in the paper.

300
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,530
You finally got me
figured out 'cause see

301
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,470
that's exactly
what I was worried about.

302
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,570
Oh? You weren't afraid that all your good
friends at the studio

303
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,540
were gonna read about you in the morning
and realize he's actually black?

304
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,200
You need to calm down
right now.

305
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:19,150
What I need is a husband who will not just
stand there while I am being molested!

306
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,220
They were cops for God sakes!
They had guns!

307
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,620
Maybe I should've let them
arrest your ass.

308
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,490
Sooner or later you gotta find out
what it is really like to be black.

309
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,330
Fuck you man.
Like you know.

310
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:37,130
The closest you ever came to being black
Cameron was watching The Cosby Show.

311
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:40,330
At least I wasn't watching it with
the rest of the equestrian team.

312
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,600
You're right Cameron.
I got a lot to learn

313
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,800
'cause I haven't quite learned
how to shuck and jive.

314
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,780
Let me hear it again.
Thank you mister policeman.

315
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,610
You sure is mighty kind
to us poor black folk.

316
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:56,250
You be sure to let me know next time
you wanna finger-fuck my wife.

317
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,760
How the fuck do you say
something like that to me?

318
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,520
You know fuck you!

319
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,830
That's good. A little anger.
It's a bit late but it's nice to see!

320
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,670
How's it goin'?

321
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,580
Okay.

322
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,750
You didn't get scared
or something did you?

323
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,650
There's no monsters in the closet right?
'Cause I hate monsters.

324
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,730
There's no such thing
as monsters.

325
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,420
- Ah that's a good thing.
- I heard a bang.

326
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,130
Like a truck bang?

327
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,330
Like a gun.

328
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:28,410
That's funny 'cause we moved
outta that bad neighborhood.

329
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:32,610
And there's not
too many guns around here.

330
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,080
How far can bullets go?

331
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,160
They go pretty far.

332
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:40,160
But they usually get stuck
in something and stop.

333
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,820
What if they don't?

334
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,690
You thinking about that bullet that came
through your window?

335
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,090
'Cause we never
did find it did we?

336
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,730
I think it didn't see me
'cause I was under the covers.

337
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:59,830
Hmm. You think it was that same
bullet that you heard tonight?

338
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,210
You think
we should move again?

339
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,280
I like it here.

340
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,360
Me too. But if that bullet found out
where we lived...

341
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,460
Oh hold on.

342
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,060
What?

343
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,250
So stupid!
How can I forget this?

344
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,630
What?

345
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,260
Nah. Forget it.
You ain't gonna believe me.

346
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,870
Tell me.

347
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,400
Okay.

348
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,370
When I was five this fairy
came into my room one night.

349
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:32,840
- Right.
- I told you you weren't gonna believe me.

350
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,450
- Okay go to sleep now you little rat.
- No tell me.

351
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,850
Okay.

352
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:45,220
So this fairy comes into my room and I'm like
"Yeah right you're a fairy."

353
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,350
Anyway we're talking you know.

354
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:50,550
And she's flying all around the room
knocking down all my posters and stuff.

355
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,030
She was flying?

356
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,760
She had these little stubby wings.
She could've glued 'em on you know?

357
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,500
Like I'm gonna believe she's a fairy.

358
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,570
So she said "I'll prove it."

359
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:03,270
So she reaches
into her backpack.

360
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:05,710
And she pulls out
this invisible cloak.

361
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:10,410
She ties it around my neck
and she tells me that it's impenetrable.

362
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,750
You know what
impenetrable means?

363
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,720
It means that nothing
can go through it.

364
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,080
No bullets. Nothing.

365
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,990
She told me that if I wore it
nothing would hurt me.

366
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:26,060
So I did. And my whole life
I never got shot stabbed.

367
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,130
Nothing.
I mean how weird is that?

368
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:33,170
Only she told me that I was supposed to give it
to my daughter on her fifth birthday.

369
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,040
And I forgot.

370
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,640
Can I touch it?

371
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,800
Sure go ahead.

372
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:44,210
- I don't feel it.
- Yeah. It's pretty cool huh?

373
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:48,180
I can take it off and tie it around your
shoulders. She told me how to do it.

374
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,920
- Unless you think it's stupid.
- Don't you need it?

375
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,820
No not anymore.

376
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,860
So what do you think?
You want it?

377
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,930
Okay let's get outta here.

378
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,900
Okay.

379
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,250
Put your head up.

380
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,890
Okay. Is that too tight?

381
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,500
Do you feel anything at all?

382
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:42,000
Good. Then
it's just right.

383
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,780
Do I take it off
when I have a bath?

384
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:53,650
No you leave it on
all the time.

385
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:59,120
Until you have a daughter when she turns five
then you give it to her.

386
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,350
Okay?

387
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:04,730
Okay.

388
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,300
Okay.
Good night sweetie.

389
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,160
Good night.

390
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:54,710
Nah nah. You wanna listen to music
of the oppressor you go right ahead man.

391
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,810
How in the lunacy of your mind is hip-hop
music of the oppressor?

392
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,180
Listen to it man!
"Nigger this nigger that."

393
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,760
You think white people go around calling
each other honkies all day man?

394
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,360
"Hey honky how's business?"

395
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,390
"Going great cracker.
We're diversifying."

396
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:14,360
How 'bout this huh? Listen. You like that?
Man's singin' about lynchin' niggers.

397
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,230
And you think there's
a difference don't you? Huh?

398
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,430
Gonna buy me a rope
and lynch me a nigger

399
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,700
You have absolutely no idea where hip-hop
music comes from do you?

400
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,350
I'd shoot 'em dead first
but I done broke my trigger

401
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,710
See back in the '60s we had
smart articulate black men.

402
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,980
Gonna get out my sheet
Put my hood on my head

403
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:34,120
Like Huey Newton Bobby Seale
Eldridge Cleaver Fred Hampton.

404
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,620
Gonna string 'em up good

405
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,480
These brothers were speaking out good
and people were listening!

406
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,280
Then they'll be dead

407
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,390
Then the FBI said
"No we can't have that."

408
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,220
Home of the brave
and the land of the free

409
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,460
"Let's give the niggers this music
by a bunch of mumbling idiots

410
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,360
and sooner or later
they'll all copy it and nobody

411
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,440
will be able to understand
a fucking word they say.

412
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:52,730
End of problem."

413
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,940
What the fuck
was that dog?

414
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,620
- Holy shit!
- What?

415
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,230
Man we done ran over
a Chinaman.

416
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,160
You're sayin' there's a Chinaman
under this truck?

417
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,400
What part don't you understand?

418
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:27,370
There's a Chinaman stuck
underneath the fucking truck.

419
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,570
- Help me.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

420
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:37,340
Ah God. What the hell did he do
just leap out in front of the truck?

421
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,490
Man! This is so
completely fucked up.

422
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,480
Oh really? No shit!

423
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,610
Okay hold up.
Hold up hold up hold up.

424
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,730
- Get back in the truck.
- What?

425
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,990
- Yes get back in the truck.
- You think we didn't drag him far enough?

426
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,030
No we gonna drive away.
And he gonna let go.

427
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,760
He's not gonna let go Anthony.

428
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,960
You know why? Because he's stuck
underneath the fucking truck!

429
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:03,340
Now if he could've let go he probably would've
considered that option half a block back.

430
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,930
What you and I gotta do just grab his arms
and pull him from underneath.

431
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,640
You grab his arm
it's gonna fall off.

432
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,580
Then you gonna be standing in the street
holding a Chinaman's arm.

433
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,410
Then what your ass
gonna do huh?

434
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:18,080
If we leave this man here he dies.
Then we're up for murder charges.

435
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:22,130
Just grab his arm.
We'll just pull him out.

436
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,560
I don't wanna cause any problems Lieutenant.
I just want a new partner.

437
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,730
I understand.
Your partner's a racist prick.

438
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,310
But you don't wanna stir up
any bad feelings with him.

439
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,200
He's been on the force
for a long time.

440
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,470
Seventeen years.

441
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,810
And I do have
to work here sir.

442
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,310
So you don't mind that there's
a racist prick on the force.

443
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:47,390
You just don't want him
to ride in your car.

444
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,280
If you need me to go on record
about this sir I will.

445
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,220
That'd be great.
Write a full report.

446
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,090
Because I'm anxious to
understand how an obvious bigot

447
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:58,130
could've gone undetected
in this department for 17 years.

448
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,360
Eleven of which he was under
my personal supervision.

449
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,900
Which doesn't speak very highly
of my managerial skills.

450
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,770
But that's not your concern.
I can't wait to read it.

451
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:10,770
What if I said I wanted a new partner
for personal reasons?

452
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:14,140
So now you're saying he's not a racist prick
you just don't like him.

453
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,180
- Yes sir.
- That's not a good enough reason.

454
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,180
Then I guess I should think of a better one
and get back to you.

455
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,150
So you think I'm asking you
to make one up.

456
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:28,020
Uh no sir. I just can't
think of one... right now.

457
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,190
You wanna know what I heard?

458
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,690
I heard it was a case
of uncontrollable flatulence.

459
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,030
You want me to say
he has flatulence?

460
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:38,900
Not him. You. You have
uncontrollable flatulence.

461
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,670
You're too embarrassed to ride with anybody
else so you're requesting a one-man car.

462
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:45,400
I'm not... comfortable with that
Lieutenant.

463
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,450
I wouldn't be either. Which is why I understand
your need for privacy.

464
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,310
Just like I'm sure you understand how hard
a black man has to work to get to

465
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:55,580
say where I am in a racist fucking
organization like the L.A.P.D.

466
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,660
And how easily
that can be taken away.

467
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,920
Now that being said
it's your decision.

468
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:06,860
You can put your career and mine on the line
in pursuit of a just cause

469
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,870
or you can admit to having
an embarrassing problem

470
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,270
of a personal nature.

471
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,610
Fuck.

472
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,140
Excuse me.

473
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,840
Excuse me. Sir?

474
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,880
You finished?

475
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,110
I replaced the lock. But you got
a real problem with that door.

476
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,690
You fix the lock?

477
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:05,990
Nah I replaced the lock.
But you gotta fix that door.

478
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,490
- Just fix the lock!
- Sir listen to me.

479
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,690
What you need
is a new door.

480
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:15,360
- I need new door?
- Yeah.

481
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,940
Okay. How much?

482
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:21,900
I don't... Sir you're gonna have to call
somebody that sells doors.

483
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,140
You try to cheat me right?
You have a friend that fix door?

484
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,370
Nah I don't have a friend
that fix doors bro.

485
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,810
Then go and fix
the fucking lock you cheater.

486
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,680
You... You know what?

487
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,310
Why don't you just pay for the lock
and I won't charge you for the time.

488
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,820
You don't fix the lock!
I pay! You think I'm stupid?

489
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,020
You fix the fucking lock
you cheater!

490
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,690
- I'd appreciate if you'd stop calling me names.
- Then fix the fucking lock!

491
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:49,160
I replaced the lock!
You gotta fix the fucking door!

492
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,500
You cheat!
You fucking cheater!

493
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,330
- Fine. Don't pay.
- What?

494
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:58,170
- Have a good night.
- What? No. Wait!

495
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:01,250
Wait! You come back here!
You fix the lock!

496
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,210
Come here! You fix my lock!
Fix the fucking lock!

497
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,420
I understand. You run over a Chinaman.
Stuff him in the back.

498
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,390
Then bring the truck here
so I can share in the experience.

499
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,260
Come on man. It's a little bit of blood.
It'll wash right off.

500
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,730
- Georgie burn this thing.
- Burn it?

501
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,060
It's a brand-new Navigator.
All you need is a little piece of carpet.

502
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,110
You watch the Discovery Channel?

503
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,610
- Not a lot.
- They got some good shit on that channel.

504
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,310
Every night there is a show with somebody
shining a blue light

505
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:39,610
and finding tiny specks of blood splattered
on carpets and walls and ceiling fans

506
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:44,280
bathroom fixtures and special-edition plastic
Burger King tray cups.

507
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,860
The next thing they show is some
stupid redneck in handcuffs

508
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:52,160
who looks absolutely stunned
that this is happening to him.

509
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,290
Sometimes the redneck is actually
watching the Discovery Channel

510
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,400
when they break in
to arrest him.

511
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:02,740
And he still can't figure out how on earth
they could've caught him!

512
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:14,620
Do I look like I wanna be
on the Discovery Channel?

513
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,980
No.

514
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,890
Then get the fuck
outta my shop.

515
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,250
Oh yeah make sure
you get that.

516
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,730
Without him things could've gone really
fucking wrong tonight.

517
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:32,670
- Fuck!
- Don't! Don't you dare.

518
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,570
Don't.

519
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,770
Graham Waters.

520
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:42,140
No. No he's not here Mom.

521
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,590
I'm not gonna go
looking for him.

522
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,980
Look he'll be home when...
Just leave it alone.

523
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:54,750
Mom I can't talk to you right now okay?
I'm having sex with a white woman.

524
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:57,290
Okay where were we?

525
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,860
I was white and you were
about to jerk off in the shower.

526
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,830
Oh shit!

527
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:05,060
Come on.

528
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,140
I would've said you were Mexican but I don't
think it would've pissed her off as much.

529
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,510
Why do you keep everybody
at a certain distance huh?

530
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,340
- What you start to feel something and panic?
- Come on Maria.

531
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,920
You're just pissed
'cause I answered the phone.

532
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,320
That's just where
I begin to get pissed.

533
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,820
I mean really what kind of man
speaks to his mother that way?

534
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,990
Oh this is about my mother.
What do you know about my mother?

535
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:32,960
If I was your father
I'd kick your fucking ass.

536
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,440
Okay. I was raised badly.

537
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:39,970
Why don't you take your clothes off
get back into bed and teach me a lesson?

538
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:44,040
You want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.
How 'bout a geography lesson?

539
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:48,270
My father's from Puerto Rico.
My mother's from El Salvador.

540
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:51,440
Neither one of those is Mexico.

541
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,980
Ah. Then I guess
the big mystery is

542
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,580
who gathered all those remarkably
different cultures together

543
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,720
and taught them all how to park
their cars on their lawns?

544
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,850
Pop you okay?

545
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,980
If I could piss I'd be okay.

546
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,260
I'm... Jesus.

547
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,870
I'm done now.

548
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,990
Give me a hand.

549
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:47,440
Wait a goddamn minute!

550
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,200
- Wait a minute.
- Whoa whoa whoa.

551
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:55,650
All right. Okay. Okay.

552
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,680
Wait wait wait.
Stop stop!

553
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,450
- I gotta go back.
- Okay.

554
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,830
What are you gonna
stand there and stare at me?

555
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,440
- So Conklin just shot him?
- Mm-hmm.

556
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,480
- They know each other? It's a grudge thing?
- Sir.

557
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:41,210
Not as far as we can tell.

558
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,620
You think this is
racially motivated?

559
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,060
Well a dozen people heard the shots.
Nobody saw anything.

560
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:49,130
- Who do we have on it?
- Graham Waters.

561
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:53,220
Waters. Tell him he speaks
to no one but me.

562
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:56,490
Call a press conference for 4:00
and I want Waters here at 3:30.

563
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,500
And would someone
please find Flanagan.

564
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:03,770
Oh! What up Mo Phat?

565
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:08,240
Man robs purses from old ladies and you
"Hey how's it goin' Mo Phat?"

566
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:11,370
That nigger will steal teeth
from a cripple man.

567
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,010
You callin' him a thief?
And we do what?

568
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,090
The man steals
from black people.

569
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,520
Only reason black people
steal from their own

570
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,250
- is 'cause they terrified of white people.
- Man please.

571
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:25,190
Think about it. Sherman Oaks.
Burbank. Santa Monica.

572
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:27,860
All scary-ass places
for a brother to find himself.

573
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,370
Drop Mo Phat at a Starbucks
in Toluca Lake

574
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,600
that nigger will run like a rabbit soon
as somebody say "decaf latte."

575
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,940
What the fuck did you do to my car?

576
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,750
Sorry I take your car Miss Jean.

577
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:51,820
I turn key to my car
but nothing.

578
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,860
James wanted
to take this to school.

579
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:56,660
But I don't want the kids
to fight over it.

580
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,530
- Are these clean or dirty?
- All clean senora!

581
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:05,570
You know Maria just once I would like to
wake up and find these dishes in the cabinet.

582
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,460
Si senora.
No problem.

583
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,980
I'm startin' to understand now.

584
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:15,880
By your work you're settin'
an example for our neighborhood.

585
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,480
Sort of like a big brother
kind of thing right?

586
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,980
Yeah you laugh man.

587
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:25,150
But you have never seen me steal
from a black person ever in your life.

588
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:29,690
What the hell do you think
you doin' right now man?

589
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:31,130
Wavin' down the bus.

590
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,530
Put your hand down dog!
Are you outta your mind?

591
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:36,000
You actually expect me
to get on a bus?

592
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,370
No. I was hopin' we could
push your car across town.

593
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,400
You know why? 'Cause we just
don't do stuff like that no more.

594
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:43,130
You have no idea do you?

595
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,730
You have no idea why they put them great
big windows on the sides of buses do you?

596
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,400
- Why?
- One reason only.

597
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:53,810
To humiliate the people of color
who are reduced to ridin' on 'em.

598
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:55,280
I didn't know that.

599
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:58,360
You could fill the Staples Center
with what you don't know.

600
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,420
You know the Kings
are playin' tonight.

601
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,890
You don't like hockey! The only reason
you say you do is to piss me off!

602
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:06,330
I love hockey.

603
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,020
Cut! Print. Moving on.

604
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:12,330
Okay that takes us into scene 12.

605
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:15,530
Jamal that's what
I'm talking about.

606
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:18,770
Right on.

607
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:22,240
- Cam you got a second?
- Yeah Fred I just wanna grab some coffee.

608
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,110
Yeah. Listen.
I think we need another take buddy.

609
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,950
That looked pretty terrific man.

610
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:32,220
This is gonna sound strange but is Jamal
seeing a speech coach or something?

611
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,260
What do you mean?

612
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:37,830
Have you noticed uh...
This is weird for a white guy to say

613
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,690
but have you noticed he's talking
a lot less black lately?

614
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,260
No I haven't noticed that.

615
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,140
Really? Like in this scene he was supposed
to say "Don't be talkin' 'bout that."

616
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:51,770
And he changed it to
"Don't talk to me about that."

617
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:53,210
Wait a minute.

618
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:58,040
You think because of that the audience
won't recognize him as being a black man?

619
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:01,180
- Come on!
- Is there a problem Cam?

620
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,880
Excuse me?

621
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,350
Is there a problem Cam?

622
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,790
No we don't have
a problem.

623
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:16,160
I mean 'cause all I'm saying is
it's not his character.

624
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,860
Eddie's supposed to be
the smart one not Jamal right?

625
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,700
You're the expert here.
But to me it rings false.

626
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,840
- We're gonna do it one more time.
- Thanks buddy.

627
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,880
Everybody back to one please.
Let's do it one more time.

628
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,510
Jamal um...

629
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,360
Morning Carol.
Who do I have?

630
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,260
Hold for a minute please.
Mr. Trujillo called and cancelled

631
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,100
but you have a walk-in
Mr. Ryan.

632
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:56,100
Send him in.

633
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,510
- Mr. Ryan.
- Yeah.

634
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,770
My name is Shaniqua Johnson.

635
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:03,440
I believe we spoke last night.

636
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:06,850
Oh yeah. I wanted
to apologize about that.

637
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:10,150
I haven't been gettin' too much sleep.
My father's in a lot of pain.

638
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:12,780
Oh! I'm sorry to hear that.

639
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:17,060
This doctor he's been seein' says
he's got a urinary tract infection.

640
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,630
But he's been takin' this medicine for a month
and he keeps gettin' worse.

641
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:22,730
And he's been back to see
Dr. Robertson?

642
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:25,530
Yeah. Between you and me
the man's an idiot.

643
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:27,570
- Really?
- No offense.

644
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:31,160
But the guy sees 100 patients an hour.
I think his nurses are doing most of the work.

645
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:36,300
Mmm. If you're unhappy your father's
welcome to see a doctor outside the network.

646
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:40,820
And if this new doctor
says it's not an infection

647
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:44,050
says it's his prostate and it needs to be
operated on is that gonna be covered?

648
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:47,780
- Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes...
- What good is that gonna do?

649
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:50,550
I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.

650
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:54,220
All right.
You know what I can't do?

651
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:56,930
I can't look at you without
thinking about the five or six

652
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,440
more qualified white men
who didn't get your job.

653
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:01,270
It's time for you to go.

654
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:04,470
I'm saying this 'cause I'm hoping
that I'm wrong about you.

655
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:06,370
I'm hoping that someone like yourself

656
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:08,540
someone who may have
been given a helping hand

657
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,440
might have a little compassion
for someone in a similar situation.

658
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,710
Carol I need security
in my office!

659
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:16,910
You don't like me
that's fine. I'm a prick.

660
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,580
My father doesn't deserve
to suffer like this.

661
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,660
He was a janitor.
He struggled his whole life.

662
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:23,590
Saved enough to start
his own company.

663
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:25,660
Twenty-three employees
all of them black.

664
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,460
Paid 'em equal wages when
no one else was doing that.

665
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:33,560
For 30 years he worked side by side with
those men sweeping and carrying garbage.

666
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,430
Then the city council decides

667
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:38,770
to give minority-owned companies
preference in city contracts.

668
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:41,640
And overnight
my father loses everything.

669
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:45,150
His business his home
his wife. Everything!

670
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,950
Not once does he blame
your people.

671
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:52,520
I'm not asking you
to help me.

672
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:56,960
I'm asking that you do this small thing
for a man who lost everything

673
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,390
so people like yourself
could reap the benefits.

674
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,790
And do you know
what it's gonna cost you?

675
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:03,830
Nothing.

676
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,940
Just a flick of your pen.

677
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:10,470
Your father sounds like
a good man.

678
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:14,670
And if he'd come in here today I probably
would've approved this request.

679
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:19,250
But he didn't come in. You did.
And for his sake it's a real shame.

680
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:22,250
- Get him the hell outta my office.
- Prick.

681
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:34,020
Sir I spoke to our employee and he told you
you needed to replace or repair the door.

682
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,630
He say he fix the lock.

683
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,460
- You come here see how "fix-ed" it is!
- You're yelling again.

684
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,470
I am not yelling!
I'm upset!

685
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,940
Yes... Yes I am.

686
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:44,670
Mom are you all right?

687
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:49,040
Stop washing.
Insurance must take picture.

688
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:51,910
Okay?

689
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,380
Look what they wrote.

690
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:56,520
They think we're Arab.

691
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:58,660
When did Persian
become Arab?

692
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:01,590
I want his name. Yes.

693
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,320
Oh my God.

694
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,460
- I want his name! Give me his name!
- Dad?

695
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:08,000
I'm not giving you
his name sir.

696
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,830
- Dad did they take the gun?
- Not fix my lock! I want his name!

697
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I'm gonna hang up now sir.

698
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:17,840
Don't hang up! Shit!

699
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:19,770
Oh thank God.

700
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:08,690
Mom?

701
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:10,990
Mom it's cold.
Come on.

702
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,520
Did you find your brother?

703
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,780
No Mom.

704
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:51,800
I was doin' good.

705
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:56,570
I was... I was doin' real good.

706
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:02,170
- I know Mom.
- I was doin'...

707
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,620
It's okay.

708
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,190
Did you find your brother?

709
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,900
No Mom.

710
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:29,740
Tell him to come home.

711
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:36,510
Tell him I'm not mad okay?
Okay baby?

712
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:39,120
Okay Mom.

713
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,720
Okay baby.

714
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:43,410
Okay.

715
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,490
Okay.

716
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:25,100
- Did you apologize to your mother?
- She wasn't there.

717
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:30,660
Internal Affairs called. Found something
in the Mercedes.

718
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:36,960
That's lunch. One hour.

719
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,000
I tried to call.

720
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:11,580
- Sounded like you're havin' a bad day huh?
- Yeah.

721
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:17,640
What?

722
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:19,650
I got scared Cam.

723
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:25,190
It's not like I haven't been pulled over before.
You know?

724
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,290
But not like that.

725
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:30,630
And yes
I was a little drunk.

726
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,700
And I was mouthing off.

727
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:36,990
I'm sorry.

728
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:40,870
But when that man was putting
his hands on me...

729
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:42,600
I don't wanna talk about it.

730
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:46,140
I can't believe
you let him do that baby.

731
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:51,080
Look I know what you did
was the right thing. Okay?

732
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:55,310
But I was humiliated!

733
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:57,580
For you.

734
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:02,220
I just couldn't stand to see that man
take away your dignity.

735
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,300
Yeah. That's what happened.

736
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:08,430
- Oh baby don't do this.
- No. No you're right.

737
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,330
I ain't doin' it.

738
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:12,940
You gonna walk away
from me?

739
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:16,340
- Cameron!
- Just go home.

740
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:26,380
Mm-hmm. I understand.

741
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:30,150
Thanks.

742
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:36,190
- Has your father read his policy?
- He doesn't read English.

743
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,300
Mr. Golzari you said
you called the locksmith?

744
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:45,360
Yes. I tell him fix it.

745
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:49,130
They said their man told you

746
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:52,540
to fix the door
and you didn't do so.

747
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:56,840
Are you saying it's his fault?

748
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,290
Insurance company is calling it negligence.
They're not covering this.

749
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:15,220
No. This store is all we have.

750
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:34,380
I really am sorry.

751
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,070
What time
you must go to work?

752
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:02,080
Not until tonight.

753
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,650
Go home and sleep.

754
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:09,550
It's okay. It's okay.
Go home and sleep.

755
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:33,900
Hey.

756
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,050
Maybe they didn't tell you
but I've been reassigned.

757
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,350
Yeah they told me.

758
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:44,250
I just wanted to say
good luck

759
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:46,190
and it was good
ridin' with you.

760
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,950
You too.

761
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,230
Wait till you've been on the job
a few more years.

762
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:57,530
- Yeah.
- Look at me look at me.

763
00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:02,270
Wait till you've been doin' it
a little longer.

764
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:06,310
You think you know
who you are hmm?

765
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,240
You have no idea.

766
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:15,810
Yo Gomez
you ready to roll homie?

767
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,750
Ready amigo.

768
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:30,520
Radio check 2-1-L-2-3.

769
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:35,300
21-L-23 picking up strange noises
from your car.

770
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,210
21-L is your mike open
by any chance?

771
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,560
Call it in.

772
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,860
Ma'am?

773
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,990
Can you hear me?

774
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:36,530
Paramedics are rolling.
They'll be here in two minutes.

775
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:39,700
- Get an extinguisher and get that fire out.
- Jesus.

776
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:46,780
Ma'am are you hurt?

777
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:49,940
- Can you move?
- I... I can't breathe.

778
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:56,050
Okay I'm gonna get you out.

779
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:04,300
It's okay.

780
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,070
Okay. Okay.

781
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:13,070
Okay I'm gonna get
you out.

782
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,380
No!

783
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:22,540
- It's okay.
- Get away from me!

784
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,710
Get away.
Stay away from me!

785
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:29,080
Not you! Not you!

786
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:31,990
- It's okay.
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

787
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:35,690
- Keep away from me!
- Lady I'm tryin'... I'm tryin' to help you.

788
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:38,320
Fuck you!
Not you!

789
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:41,400
Somebody!
Anybody else!

790
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:45,160
- Please somebody! Not you!
- Stop moving!

791
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:48,760
No! Get your filthy
fucking hands off me!

792
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:53,040
Stop moving. Lady I'm not
gonna fucking hurt you!

793
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:00,450
Okay. Okay.

794
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:03,080
Please don't touch me. Don't don't.

795
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:06,990
I'm not gonna touch you.
But there's nobody else here yet

796
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:09,120
and that's gasoline there.

797
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:14,030
We need to get you
outta here right away. Okay?

798
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:16,330
Oh my God. Oh my God.

799
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:22,200
Okay. I need to reach across your lap.
Can I do that please?

800
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:27,380
Yeah. Yeah.

801
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:30,440
Thanks.

802
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:38,190
Is anything broken?

803
01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:40,730
I-I don't think so.

804
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:43,730
Okay. Then that's good.

805
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:46,360
Are you... Are you
gonna get me out?

806
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:49,730
Yeah I'm gonna get
you out. Okay?

807
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:53,170
Look at me. Look at me.
I'm gonna get you out.

808
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:00,840
Oh fuck!

809
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:03,970
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

810
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:08,920
I'm gonna have to cut your belt okay?

811
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:11,120
I'm gonna have to cut the belt.

812
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:13,720
It's okay it's okay.

813
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:16,520
It's okay. Okay
we're gonna get you out.

814
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:18,930
Everything's gonna be fine.
Look at me!

815
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:21,530
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're gonna get you outta here.

816
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:23,360
Everything's gonna be fine.

817
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:42,550
Ryan!

818
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,720
Pull!

819
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:35,660
It's okay.

820
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:47,450
It's okay.

821
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:51,180
All right.
It's okay it's okay.

822
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,760
It's all right.
I got it. I got it.

823
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:55,920
Ma'am? Ma'am
can you walk with me?

824
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:58,330
It's cool it's cool.

825
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:02,760
Here we go. All right
you're doin' great.

826
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:37,170
The D.A. Wanted me to apologize.
He really wanted to be here himself.

827
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:40,000
No he didn't! If he did his own dirty work none
of us would have jobs.

828
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:42,370
- Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.
- Graham Waters.

829
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:45,310
- Thanks for coming in.
- He just pulled into the garage.

830
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:48,540
Great. Press conference is in ten minutes
so we'll make this short.

831
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:52,020
Internal Affairs says this Conklin has two
suspicious shootings on his record.

832
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:55,380
Both black men. Both times he was cleared
but only just.

833
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:58,290
Detective Lewis
makes black man number three.

834
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:01,860
You know any reason why we shouldn't
hang Conklin for this?

835
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,060
Well it's more complicated
than we originally thought.

836
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:13,040
We found $300000 in the trunk of the car
that Detective Lewis was driving.

837
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:15,270
Shit!

838
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:19,870
Ah. Go down to the garage. Tell him
to stay in the car until he hears from me.

839
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:23,850
You found the money in the Mercedes.
I thought that wasn't his car.

840
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:27,780
The car's registered to a Cindy Bradley.
We haven't been able to get in touch with her.

841
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,380
Apparently she uh
left town this morning.

842
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:35,260
So it wasn't Lewis's car. He may not
have known the money was in it.

843
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:45,300
You really think you're gonna
be able to make that fly?

844
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:49,600
Latasha Harlins
Rodney King.

845
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:52,680
- These names ring a bell Detective?
- Yeah vaguely.

846
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:58,270
We have attorneys for this slain police officer
camping in our offices.

847
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:01,110
We have his mother
and a half dozen men of the cloth

848
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:04,120
who swear that Lewis was one of
the twelve apostles of Christ.

849
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:05,690
We have two black city councilmen

850
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:09,060
and a congresswoman
who call on the hour every hour

851
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:12,560
demanding to know what the district attorney
intends to do about this.

852
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:15,690
And you want him to walk
into that press room

853
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:18,860
and tell them all that
the situation is complicated?

854
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:25,540
Give us a minute.

855
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:29,340
No problem.

856
01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:39,050
Who knows about the money?

857
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:41,180
You gotta be kiddin' me.

858
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:45,160
There are only two people
in this room.

859
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:48,600
Myself my partner
Ferguson and Internal Affairs.

860
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:51,200
- Jim Ferguson?
- Yeah.

861
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,210
Okay. I guess
I don't see a problem.

862
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,780
As it wasn't Lewis's car the money isn't clear
evidence of any wrongdoing.

863
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:03,880
And even if it was we aren't going to
prosecute a dead man.

864
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:08,420
Which means the money Internal Affairs
is holding can't be considered evidence.

865
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:10,820
You can do this dance
if you want to

866
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:14,390
but I'm willing to bet when the coroner's report
comes back tomorrow

867
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:17,460
it's going to say that Detective Lewis
was coked out of his head.

868
01:09:18,970 --> 01:09:20,400
Fucking black people huh?

869
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:22,520
What did you just say?

870
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,640
I mean

871
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:27,240
I know all the sociological
reasons why per capita

872
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:30,400
eight times more black men
are incarcerated than white men.

873
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:34,380
Schools are a disgrace. Lack of opportunity.
Bias in the judicial system.

874
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:36,480
All that stuff.
All that stuff!

875
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:40,610
But still it's gotta get to you
on a gut level as a black man.

876
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:43,690
They just can't keep their hands
out of the cookie jar.

877
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:50,920
Of course you and I know
that's not the truth.

878
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,160
But that's the way
it always plays doesn't it?

879
01:09:53,330 --> 01:09:56,730
And assholes like Lewis keep feeding
the flames. It's gotta get to you.

880
01:09:56,870 --> 01:10:00,270
What did you say
you did for the D.A. Again?

881
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,310
You coach ball down in Compton.
Am I right?

882
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,340
Oh please don't do that.

883
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,240
Don't act like you know
something about me okay?

884
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:11,320
What do you think those kids need... to make
them believe to give them hope?

885
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:14,010
You think they need another
drug-dealing cop

886
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:17,090
or do you think they need
a fallen black hero?

887
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:21,750
Why don't you cut through the bullshit
and just tell me what it is you want.

888
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:26,560
The D.A.'s squad loses
its lead investigator next month.

889
01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:30,570
Rick is quite adamant that his replacement
be a person of color.

890
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:34,800
It's a high-profile position and he wants
to send the right message to the community.

891
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:38,570
And the right message is
"Look at this black boy I just bought?"

892
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:43,580
Well fuck you very much.
But thanks for thinking of me.

893
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:46,150
Actually we were thinking of you.

894
01:10:46,290 --> 01:10:49,410
Until we saw that.

895
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:51,580
It's your brother's file.

896
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,780
Twenty-something years old
and already three felonies.

897
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,620
Three strikes law. Kid's going away
for life for stealing a car.

898
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,390
Christ that's a shitty law.

899
01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:02,470
There's a warrant in there.

900
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:06,970
But still hey he had
every opportunity you had.

901
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:11,710
Fucking black people huh?

902
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:20,490
So all uh... all I need to do
to make this disappear

903
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:22,880
is to frame
a potentially innocent man?

904
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:26,320
What are you? The fucking defender
of all things white?

905
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:30,120
We're talking about a white man
who shot three black men.

906
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:34,960
And you're arguing with me that maybe
we're not being fair to him?

907
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:38,040
You know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe Lewis did provoke this.

908
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:40,300
And maybe he got exactly
what was coming to him.

909
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:43,410
Or maybe stoned or not
just being a black man in the Valley

910
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:45,840
was enough to get him killed.

911
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:49,350
There was no one there to see who shot first
so there is no way to know.

912
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:53,540
Which means we
could get this wrong.

913
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:58,480
Maybe that's what happened
with your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.

914
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:03,030
Maybe Lewis isn't the only one
who deserves the benefit of the doubt.

915
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:05,530
You're the one closest to all this.

916
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:07,630
You need to tell us.

917
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,900
What does your gut tell you?

918
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:29,850
So? Graham?

919
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:32,050
What do I tell 'em?

920
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:36,090
You tell me and I'll tell them.

921
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:46,870
Well I think given
Detective Conklin's history

922
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:50,010
it's pretty clear
what happened last night.

923
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:52,770
Okay.

924
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:11,690
Before I get to why we're here

925
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:15,730
I know that many of you have heard we had
our car stolen last night.

926
01:13:15,870 --> 01:13:20,200
And as you could imagine my wife and I
are both pretty shaken up.

927
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:22,140
But we're okay.

928
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:26,870
And Jean and I truly appreciate all your calls
and your concern. Thank you.

929
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:32,540
Now just after 9:00 p.m. Last night
Detective William Lewis

930
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:35,280
an eight-year veteran of the force and an
active member of the black community

931
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:39,550
was gunned down
by a fellow officer.

932
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,280
Get outta the car!

933
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:41,850
Gimme the keys!
Get out... What the fuck?

934
01:14:43,890 --> 01:14:45,860
Whoa! What the fuck
are you doing man?

935
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:47,860
Shit! You wanna get killed nigger?

936
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:50,860
Say that again!

937
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,230
- Say that again!
- You stupid motherfucker!

938
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:56,630
Say it again huh!
Call me a nigger again!

939
01:14:56,770 --> 01:14:59,100
- Man what the fuck? Get off!
- Fuck you!

940
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,970
- Shoot him!
- I'll blow your head off!

941
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:05,130
- Shoot this motherfucker!
- I swear to God I'm gonna blow your head off!

942
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,710
Stop talkin' and shoot!

943
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:10,680
- Stop! Let's go! Here comes the po-po.
- Get off of me!

944
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:15,550
Hey hey! Where you goin' man? Hell no!

945
01:15:15,690 --> 01:15:17,620
- Oh shit.
- Anthony! Anthony!

946
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:21,460
Get the fuck outta my car!

947
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:23,820
Shit! Damn!

948
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:26,120
- What are you doin' man? Get outta the car!
- Fuck you!

949
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:34,070
Car 25 in pursuit of a black Navigator.
West bound.

950
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:44,010
2-2 Ida Tom Adam 3...
Oh Christ!

951
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:51,780
- Get the fuck outta the car!
- You get the fuck outta the car!

952
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,320
- Get outta the fucking car!
- It's my fucking car!

953
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:56,790
- It's my fucking gun!
- Fuck it's my gun now!

954
01:15:56,930 --> 01:15:59,090
Gimme my fucking gun!

955
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:08,170
Fuck!

956
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:13,840
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

957
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:20,740
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

958
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:26,580
Slowly step out
of the vehicle.

959
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:30,390
- Get out of my car.
- You so brave you get outta the car man.

960
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:37,270
Turn off the engine.
Throw the keys out the window.

961
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:53,320
You fucking want me?
Here I am you pig fuck!

962
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:54,890
Lie face down on the ground.

963
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:57,460
- Spread your arms and legs.
- No you lie face down!

964
01:16:57,590 --> 01:16:59,750
Don't come any closer!
Down on your knees!

965
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:02,260
Fuck you! What are you gonna do?
Pull the fucking trigger!

966
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,330
On your knees now!

967
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:06,130
You get on your knees
and suck my fucking dick!

968
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:09,030
Do I look like
I'm fucking joking with you?

969
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:10,690
That's what you look like
a fucking joke to me.

970
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:13,000
- This man is making threatening gestures.
- Threatening gestures?

971
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:15,440
You wanna see a threatening gesture?
I got a threatening gesture.

972
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:19,240
- I know this man! I know this man!
- Get back.

973
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:21,870
- Give me some space. I know this guy.
- Get outta the way.

974
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:23,110
Step away.

975
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:25,220
Give me some goddamn room.
I know this guy.

976
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,650
- Man don't walk up on me!
- See what's happening here?

977
01:17:29,790 --> 01:17:31,950
Do you wanna die here huh?
Is that what you want?

978
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:33,990
'Cause these guys
really wanna shoot you.

979
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:36,690
And the way you're acting
they'll be completely fucking justified.

980
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:37,960
Fuck you!

981
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:41,230
Fuck me? I'm not the one who's fucked here.
You're the one.

982
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:43,560
'Cause you're the one whose head's
gonna be blown off

983
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,030
- and onto that man's patio.
- Officer Hanson step away.

984
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:49,370
He's a friend of mine okay?
He's a fucking friend! This man is not armed!

985
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:52,380
He's not gonna shoot you me
or anybody else all right?

986
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:54,570
So give me two goddamn seconds.
Can you do that?

987
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:57,950
Lower your firearm.
Lower your firearm!

988
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,350
You startin' to understand
the situation?

989
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:09,190
What do you want from me?

990
01:18:09,330 --> 01:18:13,820
Unless you think your wife is better off with
a husband who has a bloody stump for a head

991
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:15,830
I want you to sit on that curb
put your hands on your head

992
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:18,160
and do nothing until I speak
with these officers.

993
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:21,240
I'm not sittin' on no curb I'm not puttin'
my hands on my head for nobody.

994
01:18:21,370 --> 01:18:25,370
Then stand where you are and keep your
hands in sight. Can you do that huh?

995
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,570
Yeah I can do that.

996
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:32,950
Good.

997
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:36,850
I told this man to stay where he is
and keep his hands in plain sight.

998
01:18:36,990 --> 01:18:41,720
This man better be related to you by blood
because this is fucking nuts.

999
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:43,920
I need this favor.

1000
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:48,060
You can check the guy's name his license.
He's got no priors no warrants.

1001
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,730
I need to let him go
with a warning.

1002
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:55,770
- What kind of fucking warning?
- A harsh warning.

1003
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:00,210
Thank you.

1004
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:07,080
You've been warned. Do you understand me?
Do you understand me!

1005
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:10,450
You want something from me?
'Cause I'm right here.

1006
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:14,620
- I'm trying to help you.
- I didn't ask for your help did I?

1007
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,960
Go home.

1008
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,930
Yeah that I can do.

1009
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:45,350
Look at me.

1010
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:49,480
You embarrass me.

1011
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:51,680
You embarrass yourself.

1012
01:21:34,670 --> 01:21:36,130
Daddy's home!

1013
01:21:55,790 --> 01:21:57,780
- What's up?
- Give me my money!

1014
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,320
- What? What money?
- Daddy!

1015
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:03,720
- To pay for my store. Give me my money!
- Honey stay inside. Elizabeth!

1016
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:05,130
Give me my money!

1017
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:09,960
- I want my fucking money! Give me that truck!
- That's not my truck!

1018
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:12,400
- Daddy?
- Elizabeth!

1019
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:16,770
Hey you know what?
Hey I got $50. Here.

1020
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:19,170
Fifty dollars?
You took everything!

1021
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:23,080
- Mommy?
- I'm coming I'm coming!

1022
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:27,450
- He doesn't have it.
- Hasn't got what?

1023
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:32,790
I have it. He doesn't
have the impenetrable cloak!

1024
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:34,820
Lara stay outta the street!

1025
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:05,850
- It's okay Daddy.
- What... What?

1026
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:07,420
I'll protect you.

1027
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:37,380
It's okay. Daddy's okay.

1028
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:40,730
It's a really good cloak.

1029
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:03,440
How's it goin'?

1030
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:34,210
I sent her out for groceries
and that was two hours ago Carol.

1031
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:36,240
Well you are one to talk.

1032
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:40,210
You go through like
six housekeepers a year?

1033
01:25:40,350 --> 01:25:43,650
I'm not snapping at you!
I am angry.

1034
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:46,980
Yes! At them! Yes!

1035
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:51,420
At them the police
at Rick at Maria

1036
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:55,220
at the dry cleaners
who destroyed another blouse today

1037
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:59,020
at the gardener who keeps
over-watering the lawn.

1038
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:00,100
I...

1039
01:26:01,830 --> 01:26:04,330
I just thought that...

1040
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:08,030
Carol I just thought that
I would wake up today

1041
01:26:08,170 --> 01:26:11,110
and I would feel better
you know?

1042
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:15,200
But I was still mad.
And I realized...

1043
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:19,220
I realized that it had nothing to do
with my car being stolen.

1044
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:25,020
I wake up like this
every morning!

1045
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:29,090
I am angry all the time
and I don't know why.

1046
01:26:29,230 --> 01:26:32,530
Carol I don't know why!
And I...

1047
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:37,330
Yeah yeah call me back.

1048
01:26:37,470 --> 01:26:39,300
Bye.

1049
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,280
Really appreciate this.

1050
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:34,650
No problem.

1051
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,360
So how long you been
out there tonight? It's cold.

1052
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:44,660
Hour maybe.

1053
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,460
Big surprise huh?

1054
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,830
Yeah this ain't exactly
"pick up a brother" territory.

1055
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,700
True.

1056
01:28:51,870 --> 01:28:53,840
So where you headed?

1057
01:28:54,010 --> 01:28:56,070
Anywhere the other side
of the hill.

1058
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:57,970
I'm goin' to El Segundo.

1059
01:28:58,140 --> 01:29:00,410
El Segundo's cool.

1060
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:01,710
You've been there?

1061
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:03,710
Fuck no.

1062
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,210
That's some good music.

1063
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:17,990
No really. I'm startin'
to understand it.

1064
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:21,790
Wrote me a country song
myself just yesterday.

1065
01:29:21,970 --> 01:29:24,200
I'll bet you did.

1066
01:29:25,670 --> 01:29:27,500
Whatever.

1067
01:29:41,490 --> 01:29:43,790
So what was goin' on
in the Valley tonight?

1068
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,550
Ice-skatin'.

1069
01:29:46,730 --> 01:29:47,820
Ice-skatin'.

1070
01:29:47,990 --> 01:29:50,480
Love the ice-skatin'.

1071
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:54,220
When I was a kid I always
wanted to be a goalie.

1072
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:55,920
Come on!

1073
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:59,300
What you... you think
that's funny or somethin'?

1074
01:29:59,470 --> 01:30:01,410
I think you're having fun.

1075
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:03,470
Yeah. Whatever.

1076
01:30:13,290 --> 01:30:14,310
Something else funny?

1077
01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:16,650
Oh yeah.

1078
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:20,920
Yeah? What's that?

1079
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:22,620
People man. People.

1080
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:25,800
People like me.

1081
01:30:25,930 --> 01:30:29,260
No no no.
I'm not laughin' at you man.

1082
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,890
Yeah I can see that.

1083
01:30:32,070 --> 01:30:35,670
- Why don't you laugh outside?
- Why are you gettin' all bent outta shape?

1084
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:38,440
I'm not gettin' bent man.
Just pulling over.

1085
01:30:41,110 --> 01:30:45,140
Come on man keep drivin'.
I said I'm not laughing at you.

1086
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:47,650
And I'm not telling you
to get the fuck out of my car.

1087
01:30:47,790 --> 01:30:50,350
Why you bein' a fucking jerk?
Just drive the car.

1088
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,320
I've got a better idea.
Get out now.

1089
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:54,050
Fine. You want me
to show you? I'll show you.

1090
01:30:54,230 --> 01:30:56,790
Get your hands out of your pocket.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

1091
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,930
- Who the fuck you think you're talkin' to?
- Put your hands where I can see!

1092
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:01,830
You wanna see what's in my hands?
I'll show you what's in my fuckin' hands!

1093
01:31:27,290 --> 01:31:28,820
Oh God.

1094
01:31:38,170 --> 01:31:39,640
Oh God.

1095
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:19,740
Thank you Brother Merle.
That was Merle Haggard on KYHA.

1096
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:21,900
The scene of country music
here in L.A.

1097
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,210
It's a cold night
and it's getting colder.

1098
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:28,320
We're giving out tickets to the rodeo coming
to the Fairplex in Pomona.

1099
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:36,120
- Hey you okay?
- I'm freezin'.

1100
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:39,200
Shit. I heard
it might snow.

1101
01:32:39,330 --> 01:32:41,630
- Get outta here.
- That's what I heard.

1102
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:45,000
- You got a smoke?
- Nah. I quit.

1103
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:47,230
Yeah me too.

1104
01:32:47,410 --> 01:32:49,900
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

1105
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:55,210
Hey Bob.

1106
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:25,240
Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!

1107
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:28,340
- Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!
- Do you speak English?

1108
01:34:28,470 --> 01:34:32,410
I am speaking English you stupid cow!
My husband name Choi Jin Gui!

1109
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:36,180
- Jin Gui!
- Ma'am!

1110
01:34:36,350 --> 01:34:39,550
Kim Lee.

1111
01:34:45,490 --> 01:34:48,290
I thought you were dead.
I called every hospital.

1112
01:34:48,430 --> 01:34:52,590
It's okay. I'm okay.

1113
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:55,860
I went crazy speeding.
I drove into car.

1114
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,830
My God. Are you okay?

1115
01:34:57,970 --> 01:35:00,490
I got into big fight
with poor woman.

1116
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:02,130
I called her names.

1117
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:05,610
Oh fine.
I die from worry

1118
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:07,770
and you laugh.

1119
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,180
Thank you for finding me.

1120
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:19,050
- Will you do something for me?
- Anything.

1121
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:22,490
Go to the locker.

1122
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:27,060
No next one.

1123
01:35:30,170 --> 01:35:32,900
In my wallet
there's a check.

1124
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:35,100
Bring it here.

1125
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:46,380
Oh I get it. When I said get me
a black Lincoln Navigator

1126
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:49,850
you thought I said get me
a white piece of shit panel van.

1127
01:35:49,990 --> 01:35:54,980
- Fine fine. Just give me whatever for it.
- You should see this.

1128
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:13,040
I'll take the van.

1129
01:36:13,180 --> 01:36:15,370
They're chained to the van.

1130
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:17,140
So I'll take them too.

1131
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:20,570
You wanna buy
these Chinamen?

1132
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:22,740
Don't be ignorant.
They're Thai or Cambodian.

1133
01:36:22,890 --> 01:36:25,020
Entirely different kind of chinks.

1134
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:28,250
- What the hell are you gonna do with 'em?
- Sell 'em. What you think?

1135
01:36:28,390 --> 01:36:32,690
I'll give you 500 apiece
and you can keep the van.

1136
01:36:50,850 --> 01:36:53,750
Oh no!

1137
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:59,790
No! No!

1138
01:37:16,170 --> 01:37:18,010
This is Dorri.

1139
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:34,550
My baby. My poor baby!

1140
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:39,300
Mom.

1141
01:37:39,430 --> 01:37:44,060
I promise you... I promise I'm gonna
find out who did this Mom.

1142
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,730
Oh I already know.

1143
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:52,440
You did.

1144
01:37:54,810 --> 01:37:59,410
I asked you to find your brother
but you were busy.

1145
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:03,320
We weren't much good
to you anymore were we?

1146
01:38:07,790 --> 01:38:10,780
You got things to do.
You go ahead. I'll sign the papers.

1147
01:38:10,930 --> 01:38:12,730
I wanna stay.

1148
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:16,490
I just wanna wait
with my baby.

1149
01:38:26,380 --> 01:38:28,140
He came home.

1150
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:31,150
Did you know that?

1151
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:34,080
My little boy.

1152
01:38:34,220 --> 01:38:35,980
When I was sleepin'

1153
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:39,150
he brought me groceries.

1154
01:38:39,290 --> 01:38:41,260
It's the last thing he did.

1155
01:39:20,630 --> 01:39:22,600
What happened?

1156
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:30,970
What did you do?

1157
01:39:32,110 --> 01:39:34,640
What did you do?

1158
01:39:36,850 --> 01:39:38,710
I shoot a little girl.

1159
01:39:38,850 --> 01:39:41,050
What?

1160
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:43,980
No she's okay. She's...

1161
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:47,750
She's... Here.

1162
01:39:47,890 --> 01:39:53,090
The gun shoot her
but she's okay Dorri.

1163
01:39:53,230 --> 01:39:56,200
Nothing happened.

1164
01:39:57,940 --> 01:39:59,060
She's my...

1165
01:40:00,810 --> 01:40:02,570
What are you
talking about Daddy?

1166
01:40:06,410 --> 01:40:08,170
My angel.

1167
01:40:10,350 --> 01:40:12,250
My angel!

1168
01:40:14,090 --> 01:40:16,680
She came to protect me.

1169
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:20,390
To protect us!

1170
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:23,920
You understand?

1171
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:30,290
Take this. Please.

1172
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:33,770
Take it.

1173
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:40,700
Hey! Hey!

1174
01:40:40,850 --> 01:40:44,370
Everything is okay Dorri.

1175
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:46,210
It's okay.

1176
01:40:51,290 --> 01:40:52,880
Okay Daddy.

1177
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:54,580
Okay.

1178
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:19,040
Jean?

1179
01:41:19,180 --> 01:41:21,180
- Rick?
- Yeah. What's wrong.

1180
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:23,980
I fell down the stairs.

1181
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:27,420
- Are you all right?
- I tried calling you.

1182
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:30,720
I couldn't get through
to anyone. Not...

1183
01:41:30,860 --> 01:41:34,260
Not Kath not Marge not Julie.

1184
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:37,100
I'm getting in the elevator. I'll be in my car.
I'll be home in 20 minutes.

1185
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:40,200
It's okay. Maria drove me to emergency.
It's just a bad sprain.

1186
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:42,700
Carol was the only one
that was home and

1187
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:46,470
she said she couldn't come get me
because she was getting a massage.

1188
01:41:46,610 --> 01:41:48,980
That's because she's a bitch.

1189
01:41:49,110 --> 01:41:53,020
She's been my friend for ten years.

1190
01:41:53,150 --> 01:41:54,980
All right honey.
Feel better.

1191
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:57,380
I'll be there soon.

1192
01:41:59,620 --> 01:42:01,490
I love you.

1193
01:42:01,630 --> 01:42:03,820
I love you too.

1194
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:38,220
Miss Jean.

1195
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:42,890
Would you like to sit up?

1196
01:42:48,610 --> 01:42:51,770
Here. Good!

1197
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:02,580
Do you wanna hear
something funny?

1198
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:04,620
What Mrs. Jean?

1199
01:43:06,490 --> 01:43:09,260
You're the best friend
I've got.

1200
01:46:22,420 --> 01:46:23,750
Hi.

1201
01:46:24,490 --> 01:46:25,960
Hi.

1202
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:33,890
I love you.

1203
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:05,550
All right.

1204
01:48:05,690 --> 01:48:09,020
Everybody out man.
You're free to go.

1205
01:48:11,860 --> 01:48:14,190
All right come on.

1206
01:48:14,370 --> 01:48:17,770
Come on now! This is America.
Time is money. Chop chop!

1207
01:48:17,900 --> 01:48:19,340
Come on y'all.

1208
01:48:22,670 --> 01:48:24,400
Come on.

1209
01:49:01,110 --> 01:49:03,140
That's $40.

1210
01:49:03,310 --> 01:49:06,180
Buy everybody chop suey.
You understand?

1211
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:10,120
Dopey fucking Chinaman.

1212
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:50,090
Oh my God!
What the hell is wrong with you?

1213
01:49:50,230 --> 01:49:53,720
Uh-uh! Don't talk to me
unless you speak American!
