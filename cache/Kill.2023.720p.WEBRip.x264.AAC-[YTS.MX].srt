00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,696
-Good work. See you soon, fucker.
-Yes, sir!

4
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,158
Rathod!

5
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,451
Hurry up, man!

6
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,204
I haven't even taken a peaceful dump
in 10 days.

7
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:13,425
You smell like shit.

8
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:17,179
As if you are smelling
like a bouquet of roses.

9
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,809
Captain Viresh Chatwal.

10
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:26,063
I'll see you in the room.

11
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:30,609
Captain Amrit Rathod.

12
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,449
Dude, don't wake me up until tomorrow.

13
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,826
Come on, bro.

14
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,704
Let's have a couple of drinks
and then drop dead.

15
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:45,207
Bro!

16
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,500
Tulika's trying to get in touch.

17
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,252
It's urgent. Call her.

18
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,931
You are missing, man.
Please call me back right now

19
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:02,349
Amrit, where are you?

20
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,476
I've been trying to reach you for days.

21
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,146
Dad has fixed my engagement with someone.

22
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,898
It's happening tomorrow.

23
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,107
Tomorrow!

24
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,403
I'm coming to Ranchi.

25
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:28,500
Sister,

26
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,337
why did you agree to this engagement?

27
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:36,258
It doesn't matter who I get engaged to.

28
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,511
I will only marry Amrit.

29
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,811
Careful.

30
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,946
Welcome! Bless you!

31
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,424
-Congratulations, Mom.
-To you, too.

32
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:18,968
-Thank you.
-Please come.

33
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,970
Do visit us.

34
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,096
Good bye.

35
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:46,578
You... are so dead!

36
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,081
Listen up, all is set.

37
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,499
Meet me in the washroom
in five minutes.

38
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,376
Nice thought! But, no.

39
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:55,337
Didn't I say
I can't run away from Ranchi?

40
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:56,964
-It's too risky.
-Trust me.

41
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,341
We'll be gone before anyone finds out.
Come on.

42
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:00,884
Impossible.

43
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,138
Did you hear the fireworks earlier?

44
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,767
They were real gunshots.

45
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:11,478
They can very well be aimed at us.

46
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,147
My dad...

47
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:17,484
is too powerful.
So... no, thank you. Leave for now.

48
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,361
Aren't you dying to be with me?

49
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,282
Why do I need to die to be with you?

50
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,663
I want to live my life with you,
Captain Rathod.

51
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,090
Abort.

52
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,134
What?

53
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:43,719
But I'm in position.

54
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,888
It's risky, tiger. Abort mission.

55
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,730
She didn't elope fearing her dad.

56
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,524
What if she refuses to marry you
because of him? Then what?

57
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:01,653
Bro,

58
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,865
our love is much more powerful
than her dad.

59
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,533
What a line, Captain!

60
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,545
The engagement was lovely.

61
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,631
We'll see you soon.

62
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,925
-Bless you!
-Just a second.

63
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:24,510
Bless you, dear.

64
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,804
Put the bags inside.

65
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,015
I'll take her in. You come back.

66
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,029
Oh, man!

67
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:48,659
Bro, please drop me off.

68
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,078
Dad has started calling me.

69
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:57,084
I swear, once he's onto something,
he just doesn't stop.

70
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,630
Sorry.

71
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,382
Thank you.

72
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,758
Bloody hell!

73
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:48,886
Hello?

74
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,014
Why have a phone
if you're not going to bloody answer?

75
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,640
To watch YouTube videos!

76
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,601
Fani!

77
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:00,480
I was trying to make it to the train.
Don't think you'd want me to miss it.

78
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,107
Listen carefully.

79
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,610
We've reached the railway crossing.

80
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,403
You have 30 minutes for the job.

81
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,655
What's your coach number?

82
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,661
Fani?

83
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,750
Coach number?

84
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:24,129
Excuse me... what coach is this?

85
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,506
-A1.
-A1. Thank you.

86
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,551
Fani, answer me!

87
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,054
Fani?

88
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,513
A1.

89
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,432
A1.

90
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,517
Remember, you just have 30--

91
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:44,441
If I die early it will be only
because of this moron.

92
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,068
Uncle, please...

93
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,199
You!

94
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,201
It's me!

95
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,411
Amrit, we were to meet in Delhi.

96
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:58,038
You're going to get me killed.

97
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,082
I have to go.
Dad will come looking for me.

98
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,291
Amrit!

99
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,679
Amrit?

100
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,100
What!

101
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,229
Amrit, what are you doing?

102
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,615
Tulika Singh...

103
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:36,243
will you please marry me?

104
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,205
You're totally mad.

105
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,749
Completely cuckoo!

106
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,751
Please say yes quickly,

107
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,754
this commode is a buffet of aromas.

108
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,841
Yes.

109
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,260
-Yes?
-Yes!

110
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,641
Just a moment.

111
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,204
Why is your face glowing?

112
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,085
Are you from the army?

113
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:28,170
Yes.

114
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,797
In fact, both of us are.
We're Captains.

115
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,342
It's my childhood dream to join the Army.

116
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,594
Yeah? Then you should.

117
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:40,599
It's an emotional conflict between
Mommy Dearest and Mother India.

118
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,976
-Mom won't let me join.
-Shut up!

119
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:44,978
You need an excuse to pick on me.

120
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,229
That's the truth.

121
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,623
Please move your leg out of the way.

122
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,625
-Sorry.
-Sorry!

123
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,094
Are you a student?

124
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:19,638
Yes, sir.

125
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,599
Where do you study?

126
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,268
I study at Kanpur University.

127
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,895
Really?

128
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:31,024
My son just got accepted
into Kanpur University.

129
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,986
-But I'm nervous to send him so far away.
-Why is that?

130
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,001
-Mom, I'm going to the washroom.
-Take Virat.

131
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,045
Please, I'll manage.

132
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,174
Coaching, hostel, tuition... I'll guide
him with everything. Don't worry.

133
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,803
That will be a huge help to him.

134
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,179
Take my number down.

135
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,641
Two-- two-two--

136
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,893
Sorry, kid. It's occupied.

137
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:08,937
-The other one as well?
-Yes.

138
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:11,565
Yes, nine-eight-two-two--

139
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,567
Nine-eight-two-two--

140
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,069
-Three-three...
-That's quite a phone number!

141
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,571
It's a VIP number.

142
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,573
Wait. I'm going to the other side.

143
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,428
What's your name?

144
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:42,554
Gangadhar Mahto.

145
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,222
Gangadhar Mahto.

146
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,600
Why are they preparing to leave?

147
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,518
The next station is two hours away.

148
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:49,603
Is it?

149
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,756
I heard you.

150
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:21,092
I've boarded the evening train.
I'll be in Delhi by morning.

151
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,220
Hello?

152
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,514
Mother, we'll reach by 7:30.

153
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,849
No, baby...

154
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:31,102
our Amritsar tickets
need to be booked.

155
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:34,397
I wasn't even supposed to be here.
He begged and pleaded...

156
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,858
-Your voice isn't clear.
-Hello?

157
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,110
Hello?

158
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:45,784
-Pinky, are you getting any reception?
-No, I'm not getting any reception.

159
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,744
Forget it, I'll call in the morning.

160
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,310
Sit tight!

161
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,437
Nobody moves!

162
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:19,568
Where are you running?
Stop him. Catch him!

163
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,946
Come on, take out the money!

164
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:26,575
Where's Ahaana?

165
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,577
-She went to the washroom.
-I'll check.

166
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,290
-Where are you going?
-Dad... Ahaana.

167
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,713
-Hey!
-What's stopping you?

168
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,464
We know each other!

169
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,679
Don't you remember?
I asked you for the coach number?

170
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,807
And you flashed a radiant smile
and said, A1!

171
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,851
I even thanked you.

172
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,394
Now we are friends, right?

173
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,190
Give it to me.

174
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,484
Help!

175
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,953
Which face wash do you use?

176
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,705
He's blocking my view.

177
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,624
Look how her face is lighting up
the night!

178
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,375
-Excuse me--
-Step back!

179
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:22,714
The entire State's police force
will be unleashed on you.

180
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,507
You have no idea
who you're messing with.

181
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,469
He's Baldeo Singh Thakur.

182
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,387
Owner of Shanti Transport.

183
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,350
Holy cow!

184
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:35,977
We've hit the jackpot!

185
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,896
Get out of here.

186
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,023
Virat!

187
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:48,531
Since we've found our gold mine,
let's stop the looting here.

188
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,158
How about we kidnap them?

189
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,663
-You're making a huge mistake.
-Is it?

190
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,873
I'm warning you--

191
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,167
Baldeo!

192
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,297
-Nobody moves.
-Stay back!

193
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,049
What's with all this wailing?

194
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,300
My son!

195
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,552
Your baby boy is still alive.

196
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,554
That big guy is dead.

197
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,681
What's his--

198
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,015
Hey!

199
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:17,894
My child!

200
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,646
What was his name?

201
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,816
I'm waiting.

202
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:27,070
Virat.

203
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,698
Virat?

204
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,700
Dammit!

205
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,077
Had I known,
I wouldn't have killed him.

206
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,287
I'm a huge fan of Virat.

207
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:37,455
Shit!

208
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,670
You still haven't told me
about your face wash.

209
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,214
Give me that watch!

210
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,425
Quick!

211
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,970
Mobile, wallet, all of it quick!
Give it here!

212
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,724
Give me your wallet!
Get it out!

213
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,978
What are you staring at?
Do you want me to stab you?

214
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,104
Quick, give it!

215
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,357
We'll kill you.

216
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,484
Let's go.

217
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:15,994
I've never had sex in a moving train.

218
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,495
Let go of me!

219
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,581
Leave her, please!

220
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,381
I'll kill her!

221
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,728
-Uncle!
-Dad!

222
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,229
-Move!
-Dad!

223
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,536
Leave, while you still can!

224
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,457
-Dad.
-Let's go.

225
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,541
Amrit!

226
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,044
Are you okay?

227
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:08,922
I'll check that side.

228
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,632
Dad...

229
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:15,303
-Get up.
-Have some water.

230
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,430
He's bleeding!

231
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,643
They've disconnected the emergency brakes.

232
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,146
We can't stop the train.

233
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,024
-Ahaana.
-Ahaana! She'd gone to the washroom.

234
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,193
Look for her.

235
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:31,945
We'll go and check.

236
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,823
-But you all need to get out of here.
-I'll help you up.

237
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,199
Let's go.

238
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,326
Come on.

239
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,702
Mom...

240
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:52,590
Ahaana?

241
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,467
Ahaana?

242
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:56,845
I'll look that side.

243
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:59,848
Mom, she came this way.
I'll go ahead and check.

244
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,767
-Let me look...
-Mom, you go on with Dad.

245
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:03,852
-Come.
-Let's go!

246
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,770
Uncle!

247
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:06,855
Pick him up.

248
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,816
-Hey, move!
-Pick him up.

249
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,109
Be careful.

250
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:12,735
Amrit.

251
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,864
Go with them.
And don't sit together.

252
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:16,990
No--

253
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,533
No one's seen you
besides those two, Tuli.

254
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,493
Amrit, come with us.

255
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,453
I'll be fine. I swear.

256
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,247
-I'll be right there.
-Amrit...

257
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,331
Go!

258
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:26,916
Just go.

259
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,335
I'll be right there.

260
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,642
You shouldn't have killed him, bro.

261
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,895
We could've contained him.
It's a huge mess now.

262
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:50,023
It was a split-second decision.
He would have killed Tulika's mom.

263
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,320
They put a knife through him.

264
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:57,947
Dad.

265
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:00,617
Dad!

266
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:03,786
What will I tell Mom?

267
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:06,789
We have to inform Beni.

268
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:13,171
We get off in 10 minutes
and meet him.

269
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,547
How can we just leave, Uncle?

270
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,008
They will have to pay for this.

271
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,551
He was our uncle, after all.

272
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,678
We'll look this side,
you guys check that way.

273
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,639
We won't spare anyone!

274
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:24,307
He was Beni's brother!

275
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,934
No!

276
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,062
Not a word to Dad.

277
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,067
And no one will touch those bastards.

278
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,070
Only Ravi has the right to avenge
his dad's death.

279
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,658
Let's find Baldeo Singh Thakur
to pay for this sin.

280
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,956
I won't spare them.

281
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,916
Let's go!

282
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,714
Sarju!

283
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,273
Fuckers, stop!

284
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,152
Or else I'll slay the kid.

285
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:02,780
-Dad!
-Where's Thakur?

286
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:07,160
Where is Baldeo Singh Thakur?

287
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,705
Let the kid go.

288
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:14,000
Let's discuss this calmly--

289
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:15,752
Viresh!

290
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,755
Move your ass!

291
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,431
Bastard!

292
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:44,655
You killed my dad.

293
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,574
I won't spare you!

294
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,133
Amrit?

295
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,052
What happened?

296
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:51,013
Those bastards took Viresh.

297
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:52,473
What?

298
00:23:57,812 --> 00:23:59,480
-Amrit, I can't find Ahaana--
-Tulika--

299
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:15,121
Let go of me. Untie me!

300
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:29,635
You won't get away with this.

301
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:32,805
Your partner's on his way to hell.

302
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:35,057
You're set to follow soon.

303
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:37,810
How many in your gang?

304
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:40,396
-And which coaches are they in?
-Fuck off!

305
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,817
You're still alive because
we're here.

306
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:48,321
If I'd met you on the battlefield,
I'd bury you alive.

307
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,032
If I let go for even a second,

308
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,409
you'll lose your legs.

309
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,454
You won't die.

310
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,581
Just no legs!

311
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:04,587
Tell me.

312
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,550
B1, A1, A2, and A3.

313
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,344
There are 36 bandits.

314
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:13,221
They've blocked all four coaches.

315
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,681
Ahaana isn't here.
She's not in A2 either.

316
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:19,810
Could she have gone the other way?

317
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,815
Sit down!

318
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:39,956
Move!

319
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,381
Where's Ravi?

320
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:52,843
Where the hell is he?

321
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:07,692
Yes?

322
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:12,738
What?

323
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,119
Siddhi!

324
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,926
The train's slowing down.

325
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:41,434
Let me go!

326
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:32,943
Brother-in-law...

327
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,375
Who did this?

328
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,155
Where's the gun? Give it to me!

329
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,532
It won't work.
I've fired from this already.

330
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:21,409
-I don't care--
-These country-made guns can backfire!

331
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:22,535
Brother!

332
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:24,537
Ravi isn't here. They've got him.

333
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,163
That's why I brought him here.

334
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:32,670
We need Ravi back.

335
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:37,174
And the guy who did this to Babban.

336
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:39,552
Baldeo Singh Thakur.

337
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:43,055
Owner of Shanti Transport.

338
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:45,182
What rubbish!

339
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:46,434
I'm telling the truth.

340
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,436
Your brother was my uncle.

341
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:51,063
Baldeo Singh Thakur is the reason
he's dead.

342
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,942
You can ask Ravi.

343
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:03,451
This guy has a partner.

344
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:07,079
The way they've been fighting...

345
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,706
I'm sure they're from the army.

346
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,459
To catch them, think like Dhoni.

347
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,336
-Dhoni?
-Mahendra.

348
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:16,964
Lower your guard.

349
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:20,593
The moment he charges to attack,
deliver your punch. Knockout!

350
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:38,235
Careful there, brother!

351
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:42,239
-You go that way.
-Be careful!

352
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:45,242
-Careful!
-Move ahead.

353
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:47,244
Okay.

354
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,511
Let me go!

355
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,021
Just in case.

356
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:17,525
What do you mean?

357
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:20,528
Are you worried about me?

358
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,530
It's not safe, Tulika.

359
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:30,788
The only thing that should matter is,

360
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:34,416
starting tomorrow, I'll be your wife.

361
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:37,294
I'm warning you,

362
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,547
I'm very demanding.

363
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:57,815
Amrit, please bring Ahaana back.

364
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,568
She's my life.

365
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:03,571
I'll bring Ahaana back.

366
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:05,072
I promise.

367
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,270
Is he in the Army?

368
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:29,651
A National Security Guard Commando.

369
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,529
Why didn't you tell me about him?

370
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,535
What good would that do?

371
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,039
I got engaged with
whoever you chose, didn't I?

372
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:46,168
If father-daughter are done
with suitor shopping,

373
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,419
then help me in.

374
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:48,545
My foot is slipping.

375
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:50,547
I'd rather throw you on the tracks.

376
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,425
Shut up and stay there!

377
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:02,995
Hold him.

378
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:05,289
Keep an eye on him.

379
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:37,905
-Sohail!
-Sohail!

380
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:44,912
Arif!

381
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:48,540
Arif! Stop! Arif, don't do this!

382
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:50,918
Hey, let go!

383
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:02,054
Hold his hand.

384
00:37:18,362 --> 00:37:20,322
Arif!

385
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:24,034
You stabbed him! Arif!

386
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,410
My child!

387
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,581
Catch him!

388
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,333
Nobody moves.

389
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:34,086
Someone help him.

390
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:38,090
Thrash him!

391
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:08,370
Arif, open your eyes.

392
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,248
Arif!

393
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,776
We meet again!

394
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:06,738
Are you okay?

395
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:08,240
Yeah. Shit!

396
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,742
It's looking bad, bro!

397
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:17,624
Come on. Get up. Up!

398
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,879
You're not holding the weapon right.

399
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:29,386
You'll twist your delicate wrist.

400
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:32,514
A weapon is also called
an arm for a reason.

401
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,766
Treat it as an extension of you.
Show it some love.

402
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:39,020
The arm stays flexible
and the wrist must be...

403
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:40,772
Firm!

404
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,026
One hit at the jugular and...

405
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:49,406
Game over!

406
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,660
I speak from experience.
I'll teach you.

407
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:56,288
Take the key! Get out of here.

408
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:57,789
Hurry! Be careful!

409
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:04,171
Running away and leaving your Dad behind?

410
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:12,179
Why don't you call the cops now?

411
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,181
Where are your cops? Call them now!

412
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:39,456
Tulika!

413
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:56,348
Let me go!

414
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,729
Hey, pretty girl!

415
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:05,982
What's your problem?

416
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,363
You're no soldier, Miss.

417
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:16,743
He is, though!

418
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,247
But considering the situation...

419
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,999
it doesn't seem likely that
he'll be able to save you.

420
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,001
That won't be necessary.

421
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:27,003
Bravo!

422
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:28,755
Let's have some fun!

423
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:35,136
Didn't I tell you not to--

424
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:46,898
Tulika!

425
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,401
Tulika!

426
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:09,921
Tuli!

427
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,925
You've got some balls!

428
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:22,183
Amrit...

429
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:32,819
Amrit...

430
00:43:56,301 --> 00:44:00,013
No! Tulika!

431
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:36,276
-Where's dad?
-In B1.

432
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:38,486
We're getting off in five minutes.
Get dad and pack everything.

433
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:39,571
-Alright.
-Uncle!

434
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:41,656
Bring his family.

435
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:47,287
Come on. Get moving!

436
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,039
Uncle? Hurry up!

437
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:51,916
There's no time to waste.

438
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:58,923
Get up.

439
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:00,550
And throw them off.

440
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:26,743
Happy fourth anniversary!

441
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:34,501
How do you remember every year?

442
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:36,628
That's because I love you more.

443
00:46:37,337 --> 00:46:39,964
"I love you more!" Rubbish!
Show me your hands.

444
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,466
My hands?

445
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:42,884
-Yes! Show them.
-Here you go.

446
00:46:44,344 --> 00:46:45,345
All yours!

447
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:47,096
Amrit.

448
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:53,353
Look, you have a proper crescent moon.

449
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:55,897
Which means, I love you more.

450
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,985
But your lifeline seems longer.

451
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,111
See?

452
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:18,002
I am joining our lifelines together.

453
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,006
Now we share only one life.

454
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:38,398
Bechan!

455
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:28,489
Stay back!

456
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,464
Let me go Fani!

457
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:46,883
-Let's get out.
-I won't spare you.

458
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:32,261
Hold him up.

459
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:50,029
Stop him!

460
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,455
What are you waiting for? Go!

461
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:18,307
Stop or I'll kill--

462
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:19,726
-Uncle!
-Uncle!

463
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:29,128
Get the other bags.
Quick! We have to get off.

464
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:33,132
Uncle...

465
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:39,055
They killed Dad!

466
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:43,893
Fucking hell!

467
00:51:45,812 --> 00:51:49,524
That Commando's love
has fallen on us like a bomb.

468
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:51,901
He's killing everyone.

469
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:55,530
What do you mean?

470
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:57,657
They are family, Fani.

471
00:51:57,782 --> 00:52:00,785
Exactly why I saved him
and brought him back.

472
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:05,206
Wonder why everyone
is a fountain of love today?

473
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:10,419
Why the hell did you kill that girl?

474
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:11,921
Tell me!

475
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:15,174
I didn't want to dance around trees
with her.

476
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:17,677
I was going to ransom her.

477
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,595
She was challenging me.
Sliced my arm.

478
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:20,680
So, I killed her.

479
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:24,308
Do you have any idea what you've done?

480
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,602
Do you realize whose daughter she was?

481
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:29,146
Uncle, these guys aren't regular soldiers.

482
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:30,606
They're commandos.

483
00:52:30,857 --> 00:52:32,358
We're not safe on the train.

484
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:34,068
You think we're safe outside?

485
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,028
Baldeo Singh Thakur will spare us?

486
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:38,573
He killed his daughter!

487
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:50,209
We can't leave any of them alive now.

488
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,962
We have to kill them all. Get it--

489
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:55,214
No one will touch Baldeo Singh Thakur.

490
00:52:55,298 --> 00:52:57,884
Screw your ideas!

491
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:00,136
At least listen to my golden words.

492
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,846
How much worse do you want it to be?

493
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:04,473
The Goddess of Wealth is shining
Her golden light at us.

494
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:05,850
And you do not want to see it!

495
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:09,896
Kidnap his family. Ask him for ransom.
And then kill them all.

496
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,856
How many of us will you get killed?

497
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:13,107
Exactly my point!

498
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:15,735
What will you give to the families
who've died today?

499
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:22,116
How will our own people survive, Dad?

500
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:29,957
Baldeo Singh Thakur
is the root cause of all this.

501
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:34,879
He must pay!

502
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:50,645
The commandos were in B1, right?

503
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,021
Yes.

504
00:54:01,656 --> 00:54:02,657
Easy there.

505
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:06,911
I'll get the first aid box.

506
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:15,461
Did you find Ahaana?

507
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:17,797
Where is she?

508
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:19,840
What took you so long, Baldeo?

509
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:21,801
-What happened to Ahaana?
-Where are the kids?

510
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:25,554
Say something.

511
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,932
Why are you crying?

512
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:30,685
Tulika was with you. Where is she?

513
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:32,311
Why won't you say anything?

514
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:33,980
Where is Tulika?

515
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:36,941
They killed Tulika.

516
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:38,693
What?

517
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,571
Killed?

518
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:44,949
Who killed her?

519
00:54:45,074 --> 00:54:47,493
-That can't be!
-I don't believe you!

520
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:50,496
They just...

521
00:54:50,997 --> 00:54:55,209
They pushed her off the train!

522
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,888
She was in pink.

523
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:10,975
No! My child!

524
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,601
Everything turned red.

525
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:14,979
My baby!

526
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:16,480
Red!

527
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:18,274
Tulika.

528
00:55:57,188 --> 00:55:59,356
Please find Ahaana and get her back.

529
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:01,942
She is my life.

530
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,405
I'll get Ahaana back.

531
00:56:08,324 --> 00:56:10,076
I promise.

532
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,861
What are you doing?

533
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:47,238
I need to go.

534
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,241
We're greatly outnumbered here.

535
00:56:50,783 --> 00:56:52,618
They're going to get off
at the next station anyway.

536
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:56,747
I promised her

537
00:56:58,124 --> 00:56:59,875
that I'd bring Ahaana back.

538
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,753
If they find out she's Tulika's sister,

539
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:04,797
they won't spare her.

540
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:06,757
Let's go then.

541
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:08,759
-I'm coming along.
-Viresh!

542
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:10,261
You're in no condition to fight.

543
00:57:10,386 --> 00:57:12,513
-I don't care, I'm coming along.
-Listen to me!

544
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:14,515
They need you here.

545
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,392
-But--
-Just listen to me.

546
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:18,894
I've already lost Tuli.

547
00:57:20,813 --> 00:57:22,273
I don't want to lose you.

548
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,655
They'll get off this train for sure

549
00:57:30,823 --> 00:57:32,908
but only for their funeral.

550
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:39,331
Speak! Where are the commandos?

551
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:40,791
Move it!

552
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:44,545
Bastard, who are they with?

553
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,672
How would I know?

554
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:53,846
You don't know?

555
00:57:56,807 --> 00:58:00,686
Who's with them?
Mother? Father?

556
00:58:10,446 --> 00:58:12,448
-Tell me!
-I don't know anything!

557
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:13,657
Fani!

558
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:19,079
We're wasting time.

559
00:58:24,335 --> 00:58:25,628
Bastards...

560
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:07,378
Please!

561
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:09,505
We've managed to escape the bandits.

562
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:12,383
Please let us go.
They'll kill us otherwise.

563
00:59:12,508 --> 00:59:14,009
-Please let us go ahead.
-Please.

564
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:38,158
Where's dad?

565
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:41,662
He isn't back?

566
00:59:55,676 --> 00:59:56,719
Hey! What are you hiding?

567
00:59:58,554 --> 00:59:59,555
Get back.

568
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:20,200
No, please!

569
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:22,328
Tell that father of yours,

570
01:00:22,453 --> 01:00:23,579
I'm coming for him.

571
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:33,339
Ranjan!

572
01:00:33,714 --> 01:00:35,215
-Make space.
-Ranjan.

573
01:00:35,716 --> 01:00:36,842
Ranjan. What happened?

574
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,344
Lay him down.

575
01:00:38,469 --> 01:00:39,595
Get aside.

576
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,221
-Ranjan!
-Get some water.

577
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:42,348
Ranjan!

578
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:45,976
That Commando...

579
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:49,229
he's coming for you.

580
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,607
-It's okay, take it easy.
-You relax.

581
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:53,108
Ranjan!

582
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:55,235
Ranjan! No!

583
01:00:55,486 --> 01:00:56,820
-Ranjan!
-Ranjan!

584
01:00:58,697 --> 01:00:59,823
-Ranjan!
-Ranjan!

585
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:06,789
You started this mess.

586
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:09,750
And we've to pay the price.

587
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:12,378
We're not going to fight them.

588
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:14,129
We want to get off this train.

589
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:16,632
What the fuck did you say?
You want to get off?

590
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:19,176
My father's still with them.

591
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:21,512
Are you blind? Ranjan returned alone.

592
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:24,765
He must be dead already.

593
01:01:30,646 --> 01:01:33,273
-Because of you!
-Stop it!

594
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,780
Enough!

595
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:45,536
Let go of me.

596
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:49,289
What's this drama about?

597
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:51,834
Bunch of fucking cowards!

598
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:53,794
Cribbing away to glory.

599
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:56,797
If you don't have the balls to fight...

600
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:59,425
then sit at home
and give instructions.

601
01:01:59,675 --> 01:02:01,301
You don't deserve to be bandits.

602
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:03,178
We want to get off. That's it!

603
01:02:03,554 --> 01:02:05,597
I'm with him.

604
01:02:05,806 --> 01:02:07,057
You want to leave?

605
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:08,350
Let's do it.

606
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:10,811
Let's get off!

607
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:12,771
Do you think you'll be safe then?

608
01:02:14,815 --> 01:02:17,860
Baldeo Singh Thakur is just
another passenger on the train.

609
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:21,071
Helpless. Vulnerable. Powerless.

610
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:22,865
But if he gets off this train,

611
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:27,202
he'll make sure
to get every last one of us killed.

612
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:29,079
Still want to leave?

613
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:34,710
Let's move on.

614
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:36,587
I won't walk in the front.

615
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:38,088
You lead.

616
01:03:59,628 --> 01:04:00,879
Move it. Go!

617
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:02,256
Keep walking!

618
01:04:02,506 --> 01:04:03,674
You stay back.

619
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:04,758
Go on!

620
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:06,635
Keep moving.

621
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:09,638
Walk! Move ahead!

622
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:10,931
Come on!

623
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:15,394
Ravi, what happened?

624
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:18,146
Badlu...

625
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:19,773
Uncle!

626
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:21,775
Uncle, come here!

627
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,527
-Badri!
-Fani!

628
01:04:24,403 --> 01:04:26,280
-Uncle!
-Make way.

629
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:51,930
No!

630
01:04:52,431 --> 01:04:53,682
Bring him here!

631
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:55,058
Move it. Go!

632
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:00,188
Keep walking!

633
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:02,316
Sarju!

634
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:04,818
Murari!

635
01:05:10,574 --> 01:05:12,826
Bechan!

636
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:13,952
Badlu!

637
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:16,079
Get him down.

638
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:21,084
Get him down.

639
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:22,461
Murari!

640
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:24,212
Hold him! Get him down!

641
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:27,591
Get him down.
Let's bring Bilas down.

642
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:31,345
Bechan! Badlu!

643
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:35,974
Bilas!

644
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:37,476
Get him down.

645
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:44,608
Get him down.

646
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,241
Dad!

647
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:57,120
Dad!

648
01:06:02,751 --> 01:06:03,752
Dad!

649
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:09,132
Untie him.

650
01:06:10,759 --> 01:06:12,260
Hold him up.

651
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:16,264
Dad!

652
01:06:16,515 --> 01:06:18,141
Fani!

653
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:20,811
Pull yourself together.

654
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:23,146
They killed Dad.

655
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:00,428
Siddhi!

656
01:09:00,512 --> 01:09:02,305
Siddhi, don't.

657
01:09:02,556 --> 01:09:04,057
-Move aside, Uncle.
-Don't.

658
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:06,184
Move aside, I'll--

659
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:09,896
I'll tear them apart!

660
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:13,358
I know you can.
But understand this.

661
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:17,070
They've put up this display to rattle us.

662
01:09:17,696 --> 01:09:21,199
They're lurking nearby for us
to fall into their trap.

663
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:25,328
Siddhi, we'll take our revenge.

664
01:09:25,579 --> 01:09:26,705
Do you hear me?

665
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:28,832
Get a grip.

666
01:09:29,958 --> 01:09:32,711
We will avenge him. Okay.

667
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:41,094
Bloody...

668
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:43,388
Listen.

669
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:46,474
No more of your stunts. Got it?

670
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:48,476
No more nonsense.

671
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:49,853
Where is it?

672
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:53,231
Where is this maternal love
coming from?

673
01:09:53,732 --> 01:09:56,234
Why don't you put me
back in a cradle?

674
01:09:56,735 --> 01:09:59,112
You'll get everyone killed.

675
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:03,366
We've had differences
for the first time in 30 years.

676
01:10:03,491 --> 01:10:06,244
You've pissed on all my principles.

677
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:13,752
Foster a dog or a cat,

678
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:16,379
but don't foster misconceptions, Dad.

679
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:18,882
You are not a Spider-man or Batman.

680
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:21,885
"With great power comes
great responsibility."

681
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:24,971
We are bandits. We are thieves.

682
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:27,223
Our entire extended family.

683
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:32,270
Sacrifice and principles, my ass.

684
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:02,676
Have you seen a young girl here?
Around 15-16 years old?

685
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:14,020
You're here. Where is Sohail?

686
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:16,314
Sohail's safe.

687
01:11:16,398 --> 01:11:17,649
He's in A3 ahead.

688
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:19,818
Viresh is with him.

689
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:23,822
Don't worry.

690
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:31,329
I'm looking for a 15-16 years old girl.

691
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:33,331
Have any of you seen her?

692
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:34,457
Yes.

693
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:36,084
There was one.

694
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:38,878
But the bandits took her

695
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:41,715
along with a few others to another coach.

696
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:50,098
Get out of this coach. Hurry.

697
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:52,100
Clear out. Come on, get up.

698
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:55,979
-Move ahead.
-Let's go.

699
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:05,989
Careful... hurry!

700
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:09,743
Leave the bag!

701
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:11,619
Sit down!

702
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:14,372
Didn't you hear me?

703
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:15,874
Where are you going?

704
01:12:44,402 --> 01:12:46,404
We also want to come with you.

705
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,162
It's too risky.

706
01:12:54,662 --> 01:12:55,914
They're capable of anything.

707
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:59,292
It may even get beyond me.
Please understand.

708
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:00,668
It's okay.

709
01:13:00,919 --> 01:13:03,922
We didn't do anything
thinking it wasn't our fight.

710
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:07,801
If we'd all helped you from the start
then perhaps Arif--

711
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:09,677
I'll come too.

712
01:13:14,099 --> 01:13:15,350
Don't go by my physique.

713
01:13:15,934 --> 01:13:17,560
I can be very helpful.

714
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:39,207
Fire!

715
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:41,584
Sir, the train is on fire.

716
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:47,340
Who the hell!

717
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:51,928
Hello?

718
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:56,015
Fire? On this train?

719
01:14:01,229 --> 01:14:02,981
Who put the lock here?

720
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:11,781
Seems like the fire was here.

721
01:14:17,996 --> 01:14:20,248
What a bummer!
No one saw the fire.

722
01:14:23,751 --> 01:14:25,712
The police are here!

723
01:14:26,421 --> 01:14:28,047
Thank God!

724
01:14:35,013 --> 01:14:37,015
Those assholes locked it and ran away.

725
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:47,525
We're arriving at a station, Uncle.

726
01:14:51,029 --> 01:14:53,907
Siddhi, check the coach.

727
01:14:54,032 --> 01:14:55,909
Get all our things

728
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:58,786
and make sure
you gather all of our people.

729
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:05,919
Fani, check the other coach.

730
01:15:06,294 --> 01:15:08,671
If you find Baldeo Singh Thakur,
finish him off.

731
01:15:08,755 --> 01:15:10,381
-Thakur--
-No arguments!

732
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:14,677
Pull the emergency brakes. Do it!

733
01:15:24,187 --> 01:15:26,564
Shut the doors.

734
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:36,199
Get off.

735
01:15:38,326 --> 01:15:39,827
Worried about me, are you?

736
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:43,331
Your fatherly love
has finally blossomed today.

737
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:44,666
Hey!

738
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:53,091
Run! Run!

739
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:01,599
That guy in the light shirt.

740
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:02,850
He's their leader!

741
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:07,981
Police!

742
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:16,864
The police are here.

743
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:34,882
The train has picked up speed.

744
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:38,136
The police must've informed
at the next station.

745
01:16:39,012 --> 01:16:40,888
Why are we getting involved
with the police?

746
01:16:41,139 --> 01:16:42,140
We won't.

747
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:46,769
Get here!

748
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:54,277
These guys will face the cops.

749
01:17:18,259 --> 01:17:20,011
No! Natthu!

750
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:35,193
It'll come in handy.

751
01:17:38,363 --> 01:17:39,906
Let's throw these two out.

752
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:25,136
Why?

753
01:19:26,012 --> 01:19:27,722
Why did you kill my dad?

754
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:30,892
Why did you kill my dad?

755
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:09,096
Why?

756
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:11,432
Why did you kill my son?

757
01:20:11,516 --> 01:20:13,476
Why? Why?

758
01:20:22,527 --> 01:20:24,779
Why did you kill my child?

759
01:20:27,532 --> 01:20:28,908
Arif!

760
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:38,918
What's taking Siddhi so long?

761
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,545
I'll check.

762
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:43,923
Wait a minute.

763
01:20:44,549 --> 01:20:46,175
Don't open the shutter yet.

764
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:49,345
Uncle!

765
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:52,306
Uncle! Uncle.

766
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:58,187
-Uncle... My brother... Siddhi...
-What happened?

767
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:00,940
-Siddhi...
-What happened to him?

768
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:10,366
Come with me. Hold her here.

769
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:12,159
Hold her.

770
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:47,153
Uncle...

771
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:56,370
Move!

772
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:09,258
Take the passengers and move forward.

773
01:22:09,342 --> 01:22:10,384
We fucked up.

774
01:22:11,886 --> 01:22:13,763
We should've gotten off with Fani.

775
01:22:17,892 --> 01:22:19,644
You ensured he's safe.

776
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:23,272
Uncle, let's get off.

777
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:29,862
I agree.

778
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:34,867
Even I think so.

779
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:36,786
Please listen to us.

780
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:38,913
Let's get off.

781
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,172
Uncle, we should get off.

782
01:22:48,673 --> 01:22:50,174
Uncle!

783
01:22:55,429 --> 01:22:56,681
Come! Walk ahead.

784
01:22:57,056 --> 01:22:58,182
Move!

785
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:02,061
-All of you. Move!
-Keep walking!

786
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:17,702
Walk ahead.

787
01:23:18,452 --> 01:23:19,954
Come out!

788
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:23,082
Or else we'll kill
every last one of them.

789
01:23:27,962 --> 01:23:29,505
Come out now.

790
01:23:37,888 --> 01:23:39,348
Stay right there.

791
01:23:39,849 --> 01:23:41,100
Not a step!

792
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:44,353
Or I'll carve him like a turkey.

793
01:24:03,998 --> 01:24:06,000
-Dad!
-Ahaana!

794
01:24:09,754 --> 01:24:11,130
Bring him here.

795
01:24:12,131 --> 01:24:13,466
Easy.

796
01:24:13,883 --> 01:24:15,426
Sit!

797
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,388
You need to lie down.
Don't get up, please.

798
01:24:19,513 --> 01:24:21,390
-You've lost a lot of blood.
-Amrit...

799
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,392
-Please lie down.
-The police are here.

800
01:24:23,476 --> 01:24:25,895
The police are with us.
Please don't get up.

801
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:28,814
I'm back!

802
01:24:28,898 --> 01:24:30,775
Drop your weapons!

803
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:42,286
Stand back.

804
01:24:42,912 --> 01:24:47,291
What a dumb fuck! Asked me to drop
my weapon. And it dropped on his skull!

805
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:49,001
How tragic.

806
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:54,799
Look! Happy days are here again.

807
01:24:57,301 --> 01:25:00,429
Dad's other li'l princess, isn't it?

808
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:03,432
Kill one and another appears.

809
01:25:03,557 --> 01:25:05,559
-Baldeo, you are a magician!
-Killed?

810
01:25:08,312 --> 01:25:09,313
Dad?

811
01:25:12,191 --> 01:25:13,317
Tuli?

812
01:25:15,569 --> 01:25:17,822
No, no, no, no. Dad!

813
01:25:18,072 --> 01:25:19,949
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

814
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:37,341
Run!

815
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:38,843
Uncle!

816
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:42,888
Come here.

817
01:25:43,514 --> 01:25:44,890
Uncle!

818
01:25:44,974 --> 01:25:46,559
I'm okay.

819
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:49,478
Stop!

820
01:25:54,358 --> 01:25:55,860
Where did the prick go?

821
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:17,548
Show yourself!

822
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:19,842
Come out!

823
01:26:43,282 --> 01:26:47,161
Soldier sir! Please save me!

824
01:26:59,048 --> 01:27:00,299
Ravi!

825
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:01,800
Uncle.

826
01:27:04,803 --> 01:27:07,056
Stop. Hold it!

827
01:27:08,182 --> 01:27:11,560
Uncle, gunshots were fired
in the next coach.

828
01:27:12,186 --> 01:27:13,312
It must be the police.

829
01:27:14,188 --> 01:27:15,564
Let's not kill him.

830
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:17,691
We can use him as bait.

831
01:27:24,949 --> 01:27:26,575
Move back.

832
01:27:32,081 --> 01:27:37,211
Little soldier boy.
A broken soldier toy! Soldier!

833
01:27:58,357 --> 01:27:59,858
Don't let them escape.

834
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:06,050
Fucking hell!

835
01:29:06,175 --> 01:29:07,176
Come on, walk!

836
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:10,804
We're arriving at a station. Hurry up!

837
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:11,930
Come on!

838
01:29:12,306 --> 01:29:15,809
Hold him tight!
You don't know him well.

839
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:20,689
He was trying very hard to be a Rambo.

840
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:24,359
I sat him in my lap
and bled him to death.

841
01:29:25,944 --> 01:29:27,654
It was beautiful!

842
01:29:28,113 --> 01:29:31,158
Didn't ask his name,
tell me yours before you die.

843
01:29:32,451 --> 01:29:35,454
Soldier? Hear me, soldier?

844
01:29:35,913 --> 01:29:37,331
Fani!

845
01:29:38,207 --> 01:29:39,833
You haven't killed him?

846
01:29:40,626 --> 01:29:42,252
Nope, I didn't.

847
01:29:42,336 --> 01:29:44,088
What's your name?

848
01:29:45,964 --> 01:29:49,718
-What's the problem?
-Didn't I tell you to kill him?

849
01:29:49,802 --> 01:29:52,096
Let go of me!
We can't keep him alive!

850
01:29:52,221 --> 01:29:53,889
Sometimes you're stubborn like a child.

851
01:29:53,972 --> 01:29:54,973
We can't keep him alive!

852
01:29:55,057 --> 01:29:56,725
Or we won't survive.

853
01:29:56,975 --> 01:29:58,727
-What do you need...
-What kind of father are you?

854
01:29:58,811 --> 01:30:00,979
-You're making things worse.
-You never agree with me.

855
01:30:01,063 --> 01:30:02,606
Baldeo will make our life hell.

856
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:24,378
Soldier, no!

857
01:30:30,884 --> 01:30:32,427
Uncle!

858
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:34,763
Don't let them go!

859
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:38,642
Uncle!

860
01:30:41,895 --> 01:30:43,897
Dad!

861
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:47,401
Dad!

862
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:51,280
Get water!

863
01:30:52,156 --> 01:30:53,866
Dad! Dad!

864
01:30:59,788 --> 01:31:01,248
Dad!

865
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:03,041
How badly he's burnt!

866
01:31:03,667 --> 01:31:04,793
Look at his face...

867
01:31:17,681 --> 01:31:19,057
Bloody hell!

868
01:31:48,337 --> 01:31:50,088
Get up. Let's go!

869
01:31:58,305 --> 01:31:59,473
Okay, go!

870
01:32:41,181 --> 01:32:43,183
Who kills like this?

871
01:32:45,519 --> 01:32:48,063
I killed four of your people.

872
01:32:49,648 --> 01:32:52,401
You finished off 40 of my family!

873
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:56,863
You're not a protector.

874
01:32:59,408 --> 01:33:01,535
You're a monster.
A fucking monster!

875
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:18,802
Commando! Are you still a trainee?

876
01:33:20,345 --> 01:33:22,848
You can barely keep up with me.

877
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:25,559
How will you protect the nation?

878
01:33:43,327 --> 01:33:44,661
No!

879
01:33:59,092 --> 01:34:00,719
Soldier boy!

880
01:34:03,847 --> 01:34:08,602
This is exactly how
I killed your li'l miss sunshine.

881
01:34:13,357 --> 01:34:16,234
She thought she could defy me.

882
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:23,867
Now you will meet the same fate as her.

883
01:34:24,493 --> 01:34:26,119
Tulika's hero--

884
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:53,386
Do I need to die to be with you?

885
01:38:57,390 --> 01:39:00,018
I want to live my life with you,
Captain Rathod.
