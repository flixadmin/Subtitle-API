Yeah! Watch it, nerd!

I swear, if anybody hears about this...

65

We're dead!

00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:43,558
All clear.

67
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,144
See, Lucas? We made it.

68
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,726

- Still made it. Fart face.

Shh.

70

The hell?

73
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,438
That's weird.

74
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,357
That isn't gonna work, dingus.

Oh, really?

I gotta warn you again,
and you're banned for life.

168
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,205
You wanna be banned for life, lard-ass?

169
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,343
Didn't think so.

170
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,715
Afternoon, ladies.

171
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,301
Afternoon, Billy.

172
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,175
Dig the new suit, Mrs. Wheeler.

173
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,513
Thank you.

174
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,434
- Hey.
- Hey.

175
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:39,886
You busy?

176
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,055
You're our first customer, so...

177
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,226
What now?

178
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:50,583
And then El, she just... slams the door.

179
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,901
Right in my face.

180
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:53,056
Uh-huh?

181
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,235
You know, it is that
smug son of a bitch, Mike.

182
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,240
He's corrupting her, I'm telling you.

183
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,872
And I'm just gonna lose it. I
mean, I am gonna lose it, Joyce.

184
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,909
Just take it down, Hopper.

185
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,493
I need for them to break up.

186
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,158
That is not your decision.

187
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:09,706
They're spending entirely
too much time together.

188
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,997
You agree with me about that, right?

189
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,955
Well, I mean, they're
just kissing, right?

190
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,757
Yeah, but it is constant.

191
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,141
It is constant.

192
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,009
Okay? That is not normal,

193
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,640
that is not healthy.

194
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,353
You can't just force them apart.

195
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,647
I mean, they're not
little kids anymore, Hop.

196
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,898
They're teenagers.

197
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,479
If you order them around like
a cop, then they're gonna rebel.

198
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,895
It's just what they do.

199
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,493
So what, I'm just supposed to
let them do whatever they want?

200
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,659
No, I didn't say that. I think
you should... talk to them.

201
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,079
No. No. 'Cause talking doesn't work.

202
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,738
Not yelling. Not ordering.

203
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,447
But talk to them.

204
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,957
You know, like a heart-to-heart.

205
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,958
A heart-to-heart?

206
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:54,707
What is that?

207
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:58,375
You sit them down and you talk
to them, like you're their friend.

208
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,215
I find if you talk to them
like you're on their level,

209
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,801
then they really start to listen.

210
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,346
And then, you know, you could
start to create some boundaries.

211
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,886
- Boundaries.
- Yeah, but,

212
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,805
Hop, it's really important
that no matter how they respond,

213
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,057
you stay calm.

214
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,396
You cannot lose your temper.

215
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,436
Uh...

216
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,858
Maybe you could do it for me?

217
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,105
No.

218
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,516
Yeah, you could. Yeah, you
could. You come over after work.

219
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,033
- Yes.
- No.

220
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,697
It only works if it comes from you.

221
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,454
But...

222
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:34,041
- But?
- Maybe I can help you...

223
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,671
find the right words.

224
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,718
♪ Ooh, whoa! ♪

225
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,143
♪ Some days won't end ever
and some days pass on by ♪

226
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,886
♪ I'll be workin' here forever... ♪

227
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,555
- Thanks, hon.
- For you.

228
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,981
For you.

229
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,896
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

230
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,196
Oh, no, no, no, no! Nancy!

231
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,034
Sorry.

232
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:11,722
- How 'bout a piece on Iran?
- I want something local.

233
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,517
I hear there's a beauty
pageant at the fair this year.

234
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,206
Yeah, I'm looking for
above the fold here, Bruce.

235
00:22:17,231 --> 00:22:19,111
Then clearly you haven't
seen Lucy Lebrock,

236
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,594
because I'm not sure
she'll fit above the fold!

237
00:22:22,894 --> 00:22:23,964
Fellas!

238
00:22:23,989 --> 00:22:26,239
In six hours, we go to
print. I need something real.

239
00:22:26,356 --> 00:22:27,696
Oh, I think they're real.

240
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,805
What about Starcourt?

241
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,022
I... I was just...

242
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,105
thinking...

243
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,855
I mean, I know everyone
loves the mall, but...

244
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,362
how many small businesses
have closed since it opened?

245
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,494
Like, five on Main, at least.

246
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,658
It's changing the fabric of our town

247
00:22:48,683 --> 00:22:51,853
- in a way...
- "The Death of Small-Town America".

248
00:22:51,961 --> 00:22:52,971
I like it.

249
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,286
I like it a lot.

250
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,498
But I think I've got
something even spicier.

251
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:01,884
It's about the missing
mustard on my hamburger.

252
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,593
You think you can follow the clues

253
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,426
and solve the case of the
missing condiment, Nancy Drew?

254
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:11,931
Sorry.

255
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,603
Look out, Phil, she
might be after your job!

256
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,070
Ow, ow, ow. Ow.

257
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,441
Better?

258
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,904
Still stings.

259
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,656
Is that a new zit?

260
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,033
What is wrong with you?

261
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,988
I was just asking!

262
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,328
I call it... the Forever Clock.

263
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,334
All right? Powered by wind.
Very useful in the apocalypse.

264
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,002
Then, I give you...

265
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,588
the Slammer.

266
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,928
Pretty neat, huh?

267
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,101
But this...

268
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,393
this is my masterpiece.

269
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,442
I would like you to meet...

270
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,312
Cerebro.

271
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,073
What exactly are we looking at here?

272
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,741
An unassembled one-of-a-kind
battery-powered radio tower.

273
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,872
So, it's a... a ham radio.

274
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,367
The Cadillac of ham radios.

275
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,463
This baby carries a
crystal-clear connection

276
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,538
over vast distances.

277
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,581
I'm talking North Pole to South.

278
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,457
I can talk to my girlfriend
whenever and wherever I choose.

279
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,379
Girlfriend?

280
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,263
Wait, so her name is Suzie?

281
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,253
Suzie with a "z". She's from Utah.

282
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,623
Girls go to science camp?

283
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,968
- Suzie does. She's a genius.
- Is she cute?

284
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,175
Think Phoebe Cates, only hotter.

285
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,686
- What's going on?
- Going to talk to Dustin's girlfriend.

286
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,148
Girlfriend?

287
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,742
Alrighty, one scoop of chocolate.
That's a buck-twenty-five.

288
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,360
Anything else?

289
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,161
Ooh, Purdue.

290
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,368
- Fancy.
- Yeah, I'm excited.

291
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,452
Yeah, you know, I considered it,

292
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,706
Purdue, but then I was
like, you know what?

293
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,791
I really think I need some
real-life experience, you know,

294
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,166
before I hit college,
see what it feels like.

295
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,673
Kinda like, uh, I don't know,

296
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,355
see what it's like to earn a
working-man's wage, you know? Uh...

297
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,884
Oh, I'm sorry.

298
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,387
- I think that's, like, really important.
- Yeah, totally.

299
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,180
Yeah, anyway, this was, like, so fun.

300
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,143
We should kind of like,
you know, I don't know,

301
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,544
maybe hang out this weekend or...

302
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,369
Oh, sorry about that. Uh...

303
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,153
I don't know. Maybe next weekend or...

304
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,979
Yeah, I'm busy.

305
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,315
Oh, that's cool. I'm...

306
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,108
I'm working here next weekend, so...

307
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,435
the following weekend's better for me.

308
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,488
No. I'm sorry, I can't.

309
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,781
Okay. Thanks.

310
00:25:34,093 --> 00:25:35,133
I...

311
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:37,488
This is... my first day here.

312
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,043
And another one bites the dust.

313
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,541
You are oh-for-six, Popeye.

314
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,127
Yeah, yeah, I can count.

315
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,012
You know that means you suck.

316
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,549
Yep, I can read, too.

317
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,802
Since when?

318
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,433
It's this stupid hat.

319
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,050
I am telling you, it is totally
blowing my best feature.

320
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:58,557
Yeah, company policy is a real drag.

321
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:03,439
You know, it's a crazy idea,
but have you considered...

322
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,080
telling the truth?

323
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,105
Oh, you mean, that I
couldn't even get into Tech

324
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,440
and my douchebag dad's
trying to teach me a lesson,

325
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,276
I make three bucks an hour, and
I have no future? That truth?

326
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,658
Hey, twelve o'clock.

327
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,369
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Okay... Uh...

328
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:19,742
I'm going in. Okay?

329
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:21,829
And you know what?

330
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,542
- Screw company policy.
- Oh, my God, you're a whole new man.

331
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,995
Right? Ooh.

332
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,205
Ahoy, ladies! Didn't see you there.

333
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:32,126
Would you guys like to set sail
on this ocean of flavor with me?

334
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,375
I'll be your captain.

335
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,877
I'm Steve Harrington.

336
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,178
Oh, God.

337
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,542
Can I get you guys a little
taste of the Cherries Jubilee?

338
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,057
No? Anybody?

339
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,600
Banana Boat? Four people, four spoons?

340
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,154
Share it in the booth?
Anybody? It's hot out there.

341
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,229
I know this is a difficult
conversation to have...

342
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:52,315
but I hope you know that
I... care about you very much.

343
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,779
- And I know that you...
- Eye contact.

344
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,285
And I know that you...

345
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,162
both care about each other very much.

346
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,646
This does not sound like me at all.

347
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,576
Just keep going. Come on.

348
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,840
Which is why I think it's important
to establish these boundaries...

349
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,757
moving forward...

350
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,595
No looking. You know this.

351
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:19,838
Come on.

352
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,515
... so we can build an environment...

353
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:23,926
uh...

354
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,057
where we...

355
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,018
all feel comfortable

356
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,234
and trusted

357
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,111
and open...

358
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,611
"Share our feelings..."

359
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,244
... to sharing our feelings...
This isn't gonna work.

360
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,082
Um, it's not gonna work.
It's not gonna work.

361
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,365
Yes, it will! I promise.

362
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,701
Oh, come on.

363
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,407
Maybe I'll just kill Mike.

364
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,460
I'm the chief of police,
I could cover it up.

365
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,246
You got this.

366
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,310
I promise.

How are you? So good to see you.

378

So, um, Georgie has
his 13th birthday coming up.

379
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,496
Oh, my gosh, 13?

Cerebro works best at a hundred meters.

You know, I'm pretty sure
people in Utah have telephones.

386
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,731
Yeah, but Suzie's Mormon.

387
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,771
Oh, shit. She doesn't have electricity?

388
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,943
Oh, that's the Amish.

389
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,480
- What are Mormons?
- Super religious white people.

390
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,902
They have electricity
and cars and stuff, but...

391
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,777
since I'm not Mormon, her
parents would never approve.

392
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,196
It's all a bit...

393
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,155
Shakespearean.

394
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,281
Shakespearean?

395
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,289
Yeah. Like Romeo and Juliet.

396
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,370
Right.

397
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,115
- Star-crossed lovers.
- I got it.

398
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,206
Hey, guys!

I have to go home.

- Sorry, man.

402
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,630
Curfew.

403
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,682
- Come on, let's go.
- Good luck.

404
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,676
- Curfew at 4:00?
- They're lying.

00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,724

Thank you.

422
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,849
Perfect form.

423
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:32,806
Well...

424
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,563
your form is amazing.

00:31:35,973 --> 00:31:37,143
I'm sorry, I mean, I...

426
00:31:37,931 --> 00:31:40,561
I've seen you... uh, teaching...

427
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,321
... lessons. Swimming lessons.

428
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,947
You know, I could, uh...

429
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,236
I could teach you, if you like.

430
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,323
Oh.

431
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,525
I know all the styles.

432
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,162
Freestyle.

433
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,202
Butterfly.

434
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,370
Breaststroke.

435
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,415
- Oh.
- Oh!

436
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,711
You okay?

437
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,715
I didn't think you... I
didn't think you taught adults.

438
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,379
Well, I offer more, uh...

439
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,144
advanced lessons to select clientele.

440
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:14,209
Oh.

441
00:32:14,234 --> 00:32:17,114
Come to think of it,
there is a good pool

442
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,478
out at a Motel 6 on Cornwallis.

443
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,983
It's very quiet.

444
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,731
You know, very private.

445
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:25,817
Mm.

446
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,610
Shall we say tonight?

447
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,777
Eight o'clock?

448
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,118
I'm sorry.

449
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:36,471
I can't.

450
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,956
Can't what? Have fun?

451
00:32:39,394 --> 00:32:41,104
- Mrs. Wheeler!
- No.

452
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:45,798
I... I... I just, uh... I don't
think I need any lessons.

453
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,844
Oh, you see, I think you do.

454
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,218
I just don't think that
you've had the right teacher.

455
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,852
- I, uh...
- It will be

456
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,350
the workout of your life.

457
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,524
Made it.

458
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,687
Yeah, only took five hours.

459
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,609
Why couldn't we just play D&D?

460
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,283
I'm so thirsty.

461
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,125
Did you seriously just
drink the rest of our water?

462
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,407
Pretty impressive, right?

463
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,670
- Yeah.
- Now, you ready to meet my love?

464
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,069
- Okay, sure.
- Yeah.

465
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:10,798
Suzie, this is Dustin.
Do you copy? Over.

466
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,755
One sec. She's probably...
She's still there.

00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:18,847
Suzie...

468
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,640
this is Dustin. Do you copy? Over.

469
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,688
I'm sure she's there. It's just...

470
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,918
- Yeah.
- You know, maybe she's, like, busy or...

471
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,692
- Yeah.
- It's around dinnertime.

472
00:34:31,717 --> 00:34:32,787
- Mmm.
- Yep.

473
00:34:32,812 --> 00:34:33,892
Here.

474
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:39,115
Suzie, do you copy?
This is Dustin. Over.

475
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:46,786
Suzie, do you copy?
This is Dustin. Over.

476
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,640
Hey, guys, I'm home.

477
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,351
Guys?

478
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,188
Hello?

479
00:35:32,404 --> 00:35:33,424
Ah!

480
00:35:33,449 --> 00:35:35,159
So, who do you wanna speak to next?

481
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,295
I'm talking about Frasier, Sam.

482
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:43,434
He had a couple of sips of Chianti
tonight and asked me to marry him.

483
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,149
Did you say a
couple of sips, or barrels?

484
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,322
Ahh!

485
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,860
- Ah, they're funny, don't you think?
- Yes.

486
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,413
I just wish they'd get
back together again already.

487
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:00,615
Me too.

488
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,719
You don't think that I still...

489
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,543
- Well, of course I...
- You bet your...

490
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,748
Tell everyone that I'll call
after the wedding tomorrow.

491
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,381
Tomorrow? What's the rush?

492
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,176
Frasier has thoughtfully
and romantically

493
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,350
arranged for us to be married

494
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,889
at the Marino estate.

495
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,706
Shit, shit.

496
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,760
Hawkins Post.

497
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,216
Um, hold on, I'm...

498
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,511
I'm sorry, can you...

00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:36,212
moving forward, so that we can
create an environment where...

503
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:41,012
you feel comfortable
and trusted and open.

504
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:45,893
Shit.

505
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,812
"To share our feelings".

506
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,748
Hey.

507
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,293
Yes?

508
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,706
Can I talk to you guys a minute?

509
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,265
Hi.

510
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,183

What I, uh...

518
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,444
needed to say to you...

519
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,701
What I wanted

520
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,660
to say to you...

521
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:30,867
is that, um...

522
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,285
Uh-oh.

523
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,495
I think we're in trouble.

524
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,463
No.

525
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,839
No, nobody's in trouble, okay?

526
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,296
I just, um...

527
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,470
Uh...

528
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,018
You know what?

529
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,805
Your mom called.

530
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,564
What?

531
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,441
Yeah.

532
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,608
She needs you home right away.

533
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,454
Is everything okay?

534
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,660
No, I don't think so.

535
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,525
It's your grandma.

536
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,451
- Is she dead?
- No.

537
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,908
- Did she fall again?
- No.

538
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,327
Does she have cancer?

539
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,839
- No.
- Then I don't understand.

540
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,338
What's wrong with Nana?

541
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,471
Nothing! There's
nothing wrong with Nana!

542
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,379
- What?
- But...

543
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:33,678
there's something very wrong with
this thing between you and El.

544
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,813
Oh, you lying piece of shit!

545
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:44,856
You're crazy!

546
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,032
Crazy?

547
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,695
You want to see real crazy?

548
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,525
You disrespect me again.

549
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,535
Okay?

550
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,710
Here's what's gonna happen.

551
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,627
I'm gonna drive you home.

552
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,045
And I'm gonna speak...

553
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,512
and you're going to listen.

554
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,560
And then, maybe...

555
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,983
maybe by the end of it, maybe
if you're lucky, maybe...

556
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,687
I will continue

557
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:27,653
to allow you to date my daughter.

558
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,583
Nod if you understand!

559
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:42,332
... do you copy? This is Dustin. Over.

560
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:49,842
Suzie! This is Dustin.
Do you copy? Over.

561
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:56,061
Suzie, this is your
Dustin. Do you copy? Over.

562
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,228
- Suzie...
- Dustin, come on! She's not there.

563
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,869
She's there, all right? She'll pick up.

564
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:05,564
- Maybe Cerebro doesn't work.
- Or maybe Suzie doesn't exist.

565
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:06,609
She exists!

566
00:42:06,634 --> 00:42:09,364
She's a genius and she's
hotter than Phoebe Cates?

567
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,358
No girl is that perfect.

568
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:12,946
Is that so?

569
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,490
I mean...

570
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:16,831
you're perfect.

571
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,789
I mean, like, per...
perfect in your own way.

572
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,620
In your special... your own special way.

573
00:42:23,348 --> 00:42:24,558
Relax, I was teasing.

574
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:28,745
I'm obviously perfect and
Dustin's obviously lying.

575
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,505
Come on, Don Juan.

576
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,844
- Where are you going?
- Home.

577
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:38,514
Well... guess it's
just you and me, Byers.

578
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,389
Um... it's late.

579
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,268
Sorry.

580
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,806
Maybe tomorrow we can play D&D.

581
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,018
Or something fun. Like we used to?

582
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,066
Yeah, sure.

583
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:51,985
Welcome home.

584
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:00,827
Yeah.

585
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,287
Welcome home.

586
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,584
Shit.

587
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:08,918
Shit.

588
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,132
Suzie? Suzie, is that you?

589
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,104
The silver cat feeds...

590
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:27,146
when blue meets yellow in the west...

591
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:33,738
A trip to China sounds
nice... If you tread lightly...

592
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,903
The week is long...

593
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,240
The silver cat feeds...

594
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,050
