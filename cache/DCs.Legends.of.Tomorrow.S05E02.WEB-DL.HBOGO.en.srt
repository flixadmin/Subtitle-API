1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,480
<i>The Legends of Tomorrow
are everywhere.</i>

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,720
<i>Since they defeated a demon</i>

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,240
{\an5}<i>with the help of a dragon
on national TV,</i>

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,600
<i>they've become a worldwide obsession.</i>

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,280
{\an5}<i>Sure, we've all been mesmerized
by the global phenomenon</i>

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,680
{\an5}<i>- known as "Legends Mania."</i>
- Yum.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,200
And the Oscar for Best Picture
goes to...

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,520
<i>But who are the people beneath
those supersized public personas?</i>

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,120
- Right.
<i>- What are they like</i>

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,800
<i>when the spotlight is off?</i>

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,560
I'm Kevin Harris,

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,880
and my documentary film crew
is the first ever

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,280
to be granted unfettered access
to their lives

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,480
and their ship, the <i>Waverider.</i>

15
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,760
So, strap in, because today,
we meet the Legends.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,840
So, why don't we start
with just a brief introduction?

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,080
And let us know
what we're doing today

18
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,160
on the <i>Waverider.</i>

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,320
{\an5}Yeah. Hi, I'm, I'm Ava Sharpe.

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,920
{\an5}After Congress shut down
the Time Bureau,

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,480
{\an5}Sara went off
to help Oliver Queen

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,880
{\an5}and, I had to fight to keep
the <i>Waverider</i> from being impounded.

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,440
{\an5}<i>Bad luck that the senator chairing
the committee was</i>

24
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,640
{\an5}<i>the same person
we almost killed last year.</i>

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,240
{\an5}Senator Wellington, I know

26
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,720
{\an5}the Time Bureau may
have been compromised

27
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,880
{\an5}but you must allow the <i>Waverider</i>
to continue patrolling the timeline.

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,000
{\an5}Ms. Sharpe, how do we know
these so-called "Legends"

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,000
{\an5}can be trusted with time travel?

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,520
{\an5}Oh, there's simply no transparency.

31
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,920
{\an5}Which is why you all are here.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,640
Right? To show everyone what we do.

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,120
What could go wrong?

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,640
<i>The Waverider was surprisingly quiet</i>

35
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,880
<i>because half the team
was away on a mission.</i>

36
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,600
{\an5}Oh, the crossover.
Yeah, had to take a rain check.

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,240
{\an5}See, when you are a superhero
slash amusement park impresario

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,760
{\an5}slash historian that rises
from the dead,

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,600
{\an5}your dance card tends
to get pretty full.

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,400
{\an5}<i>For two full minutes,
I was not alive.</i>

41
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,360
{\an5}<i>That changes you, man.</i>

42
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,400
<i>Don't get me wrong, I, I love fame.</i>

43
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,040
<i>No, one says no to you
about anything.</i>

44
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,160
{\an5}Hey, man, that's a cool hat.
Can I have it?

45
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
But still,

46
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,720
{\an5}something doesn't feel right.

47
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,800
{\an5}Sorry. Hang on.

48
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,840
There we go.

49
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,240
<i>Hi, I'm Behrad Tarazi.</i>

50
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,480
{\an5}I guess you probably
think I'm some kind

51
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,600
{\an5}of awesome future man
since I'm from 2044.

52
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,480
{\an5}<i>My literal birthday was yesterday,
which is pretty wild, man.</i>

53
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,160
{\an5}That's me. Hey, baby Behrad.

54
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,040
{\an5}Be easy and go with the flow.
Like Wu-Tang Clan and Bruce Lee.

55
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,200
{\an5}I mean, now, that we're no longer
D-list superheroes,

56
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,880
{\an5}we can just go where we want.

57
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,440
{\an5}Do as we please.

58
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,080
{\an5}Why have I stuck around?

59
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,040
{\an5}Tell you the truth,
I have no bloody clue.

60
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,360
{\an5}I am bored as a post, ain't I?

61
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,760
{\an5}Gids, I'm nicking the Jumpship,
all right?

62
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,760
{\an5}I'll see you when I see you.

63
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,880
{\an5}<i>The Jumpship is fully totemed.</i>

64
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,440
{\an5}She's a mad old bat, that one.

65
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,560
{\an5}Hi, I'm Mona Wu. I'm a Kaupe.

66
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,920
{\an5}That's basically like a werewolf,
but Hawaiian.

67
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,760
I'm also a literary agent
for romance novelist Rebecca Silver,

68
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,760
who is secretly Mick Rory.

69
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,160
{\an5}Jeez, Peter, take me out
on a date first

70
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,120
{\an5}before you try to, you know.

71
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,960
<i>Basically, what I do is,
I sell movie rights,</i>

72
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,280
<i>get book advances,
that kind of stuff.</i>

73
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,360
You're telling me
that you don't have a single dollar

74
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,480
for a Rebecca Silver book advance?

75
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,720
Okay, now you're not
just disrespecting me,

76
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,720
you're disrespecting my client!

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,920
Not now!

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,640
Pay up, or I will thrash you!

79
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,400
Hi, I'm Gary Green.

80
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,120
{\an5}If I had to sum myself up
in two words, they would be,

81
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,320
{\an5}fully forgiven.

82
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,080
{\an5}A lot of things happened last year
that you could misconstrue

83
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,040
{\an5}as potentially maybe being my fault.

84
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,600
<i>But thankfully,
everyone agrees that at worst,</i>

85
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,840
<i>I was just a hapless rube</i>

86
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,920
<i>who got manipulated by the forces
of hell to betray humanity.</i>

87
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,080
<i>I had a Fairy Godmother named Nora,
but we separated amicably</i>

88
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,320
{\an5}after she granted me
my heart's deepest wish.

89
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,080
{\an5}Gary, what the hell are you doing?
Come on. We got bigger fish to fry.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,200
{\an5}Nora made me
Constantine's apprentice.

91
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,400
{\an5}- Gary!
- Call me!

92
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,200
So, how does your girlfriend feel
about the documentary being made?

93
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,640
{\an5}Actually I, I haven't told Sara
about the, the documentary yet.

94
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,640
{\an5}I just think it was a little awkward
over the phone.

95
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,800
<i>It's, it's better to you know,
spring it on her</i>

96
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,160
<i>when she gets back
from the big mission.</i>

97
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,240
{\an5}Okay, big smiles, everyone.

98
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,560
And nobody mention Oliver Queen.

99
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
Why?

100
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,800
- Because he died.
- Shouldn't have done the crossover.

101
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,360
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

102
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,600
{\an5}- Yeah, team!
- Yeah.

103
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
Bros!

104
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,880
- Orange drink or limeade?
- Alcohol.

105
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,240
{\an5}Hey, love. Welcome back, baby.

106
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,160
{\an5}- What is going on?
- Before you object, let me explain.

107
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,200
{\an5}The only way
that I could stop Senator Wellington

108
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,280
{\an5}from cutting off our funding,

109
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,040
{\an5}was to be clear and transparent
about our process.

110
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,120
Get it?

111
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,240
{\an5}So, you're shooting a documentary
about the Legends?

112
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,240
{\an5}Not me per se...

113
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,320
{\an5}Hi, Captain Lance. Huge fan.

114
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,880
I'm the director, Kevin Harris.
You can call me "Kev."

115
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,840
{\an5}Just carry on, do what you're doing.
We're not even here.

116
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,080
That's Kev.
He's, he's got it under control.

117
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,480
{\an5}And what if I wanna talk
about something in private?

118
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,600
{\an5}It's... it's not a problem.

119
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,480
{\an5}That's what the confessional
interviews are for.

120
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,040
{\an5}- Yeah.
- Okay, so I can,

121
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,440
{\an5}I could just say it to the camera.

122
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,240
- Sure.
- My girlfriend, she's lost her mind.

123
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,200
She, she just...
She really probably needs a nap.

124
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,120
She gets a little sleepy
after a long mission.

125
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,480
Mick!

126
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,960
Why don't you tell us all
what you do on the ship?

127
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,600
I steal stuff.
Get out of my way, you putz.

128
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,400
Okay. He's just joking.

129
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,720
{\an5}Ray! Who else saved the multi-verse?

130
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,600
{\an5}Well, the Flash, Supergirl,

131
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,080
- Batwoman...
- Cool.

132
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,640
{\an5}- Yeah.
- What, no Superman?

133
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,920
{\an5}Couldn't have been that big a deal.

134
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,440
{\an5}Oh, no, no, Superman was there.

135
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,000
He's very handsome.

136
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,880
- It's good to have you back, buddy.
- Yeah.

137
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,280
Hey, we're missing someone.

138
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,280
Where's Charlie?

139
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,680
Took the Jumpship for a joyride.

140
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,760
Oh, a joyride to check the timeline.

141
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,440
Right? It's called a time scout.

142
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,320
{\an5}Now, who wants to visit
the temporal zone? Shall we?

143
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,000
<i>Guys, I'm still outside!
I'm still outside!</i>

144
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,240
<i>Don't leave me!</i>

145
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,120
{\an5}Hi, I'm Ray Palmer. The Atom.

146
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,080
{\an5}This documentary
is an exciting opportunity for me

147
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,640
{\an5}to improve my image.

148
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,240
<i>A lot of people still confuse me
for the demon</i>

149
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,480
<i>who possessed me
and opened up the gates of hell.</i>

150
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,560
<i>His name was Neron,
and he is no longer with me.</i>

151
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,120
Or inside me, or...

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,840
I really wish that you could meet
my girlfriend Nora.

153
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,320
But she works out of town a lot,
internationally.

154
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,440
<i>She's got a lot of global clients.
Kids mostly.</i>

155
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,200
She is a Fairy Godmother.

156
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,440
There's something behind you.

157
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,840
Is this a Timequake?

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,160
See? I knew the timeline was still
in jeopardy. What do we got?

159
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,280
Time pirates? Time terrorism?
Time sex tourism?

160
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,520
Wow, Ava.

161
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,680
You could be a supervillain
if you applied yourself.

162
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,680
Gideon, what's the point of origin?

163
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,920
<i>It appears my Jonah Hex has
Beebo loves, loves you.</i>

164
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,920
Gideon may have a virus.

165
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,480
- Doesn't she make everything work?
- We are perfectly safe.

166
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,880
Guys, that was
a Class five Timequake!

167
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,760
- That is so dangerous.
- Okay, guys,

168
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,040
let's just try to keep our composure,
shall we?

169
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,280
I've triangulated the Timequake
to 1917 St. Petersburg, Russia.

170
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,000
Let's go and shrink the problem.

171
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,160
- Not good.
- I'm developing a catchphrase?

172
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,120
<i>Executing time jump now.</i>

173
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,040
No, Gideon,
we're not taking a film crew to...

174
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,680
Imperial Russia.

175
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,480
Yeah, great.

176
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,320
This is great, Ray.

177
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,160
All right, Legends,
put on your babushkas

178
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,800
because we are rushing into Russia.

179
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,000
And now, you're copying my thing.

180
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,680
Totally. I just got really excited.

181
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,680
Okay, listen, babe,
this may seem like a problem,

182
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,040
but let's turn it
into a proble-tunity?

183
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,120
Maybe a party-snake
is just what the doctor ordered.

184
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,360
What's a party-snake?

185
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,920
"Sneak." Party-sneak.

186
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,800
<i>The wonder of time travel
is allowing our cameras</i>

187
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,160
<i>to capture some of the first color
images of Imperial Russia</i>

188
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,040
<i>as we ride along
on the Legends' patented party-sneak.</i>

189
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,120
Turns out
it's more of a fun funeral-sneak.

190
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Who died?

191
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,760
Grigori Rasputin, aka The Mad Monk.

192
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,400
Equal parts mystic advisor
and manipulative horn ball.

193
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,680
Rasputin was
notoriously hard to kill.

194
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,120
It took cyanide, a gun,
and drowning before he stayed dead.

195
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,800
Guys!

196
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,800
We sure he stayed dead?

197
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,320
Rasputin came back from the dead,
and it caused a Timequake.

198
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,200
This is the kind of problem
that I can wrap my head around.

199
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,720
So, I need you guys

200
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,000
to forget about
this documentary film crew

201
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,240
and focus on the mission at hand.
Yes?

202
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,960
Yes, we need to minimize the mishap.

203
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,360
Right, that's good, because saving
the day is what the Legends do best.

204
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,160
- Ava, you're in my shot.
- Oh, sorry.

205
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,080
Gideon, what does
the historical record say?

206
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,280
<i>Perhaps time loop, time loop
released him from Marion Ravenwood.</i>

207
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,960
Of course! Okay, B-money, with me.

208
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,720
We're gonna fix Gideon,
get our guests back to 2020.

209
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,360
Mona, Nate, Ray,

210
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,360
I want you three researching
Rasputin.

211
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,760
Figure out
what his next move's gonna be.

212
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,400
Okay? Let's do it.

213
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,160
Hey, Ray, sorry. But just...

214
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,880
Hey.

215
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,400
Is, is everything okay with Sara?

216
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,840
I don't know,

217
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,240
but I, I do know that Oliver's death
was pretty tough on her.

218
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,760
Yeah.

219
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,000
Maybe you should write Sara
a condolence card.

220
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,000
That's actually not a bad idea.
I guess I could

221
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,240
put my thoughts and feelings
into words on a card.

222
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,520
What if more baddies started coming
back throughout history?

223
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,480
If they do,
we can call them "evil do-overs."

224
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,280
"Villa-agains."

225
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,560
I like "Encores."

226
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,480
- It's a good idea.
- We could take a vote.

227
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,240
- We could take like a team vote.
- Okay, let's vote.

228
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,200
- Encores.
- Villa-agains.

229
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,560
Encores.

230
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,400
Don't be a jerk about it. Encores!

231
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,840
{\an5}<i>Meanwhile, back in New York,</i>

232
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,600
<i>Constantine and Gary
were doing some soul searching.</i>

233
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,120
We're here with the great mage
John Constantine,

234
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,880
responding to an urgent call
regarding the supernatural.

235
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,560
Oh, bloody hell, Gary.

236
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,160
You know, I must have been off
my rocker

237
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,840
when I made you my assistant.

238
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,400
- Mr. Constantine.
- It's what the card says, love.

239
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,040
It's my son, Edgar.

240
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,320
I came home late from my shift,
usually he's up playing video games...

241
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,960
All right, all right love,
there you go.

242
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,360
Now, why don't you let me
take a look?

243
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,120
- What's wrong with him?
- His PJs, for starters.

244
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,440
Do people really wear
matching pajama sets?

245
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,920
Yes.

246
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,680
John, wait!

247
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,640
Masher?

248
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,720
Masher, is that you possessing
the lad?

249
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,480
Glad to see you escaped hell.

250
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,080
Yeah, I could say the same
about you, mate.

251
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,600
Demon's gotta have his fun.

252
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,520
Yeah, well, I could murder
a pint right about now.

253
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,000
Fancy a drink?

254
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,640
- You're buying.
- You've got it. Let's go.

255
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,320
Excuse me, greatest of warlocks,
but what about Edgar's mother?

256
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,120
Good thinking, G-man.

257
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,040
We'll take the fire escape.

258
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,360
<i>What distable do you wix,
Captain Cat?</i>

259
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,040
<i>- What distable...</i>
- Easy on Gideon, Cap.

260
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,000
<i>What are, are you wixtable
Captain Cat, Captain Cat?</i>

261
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,640
- Is everybody just
- <i>Captain Cat?</i>

262
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,960
trying to get on my nerves today?

263
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,400
Camera crew shows up and what,
nobody can act like themselves?

264
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,800
The spotlight does weird things
to people.

265
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,360
But hey,
you know I'll always be my true self.

266
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
Oh, yeah? Your true self?

267
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,600
Don't your parents think
you're in business school?

268
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,000
I am a tangled web.

269
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Enough about me.

270
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,680
How are you doing
with Oliver and everything?

271
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
I, I'm fine.

272
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,640
No worries,
we don't have to talk about it.

273
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,240
But...

274
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,320
I made you something.

275
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,960
Oh, please don't be
a condolence card,

276
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,160
because those
are always super awkward.

277
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,320
No, hopefully, something better.

278
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,640
It's you, Ollie, and Laurel.

279
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,120
B, this is actually...

280
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,560
It's really sweet.

281
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Thank you.

282
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,640
My condolence card wasn't awkward.

283
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,400
<i>"Dear Sara, I'm sorry
the vigilante you slept with</i>

284
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,240
<i>when he was already
dating your sister died.</i>

285
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,000
<i>Some say it's better
to have loved and lost,</i>

286
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,600
<i>but I hope you never loved him
at all."</i>

287
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,960
Sara and I aren't the type
to give each other cards, anyway.

288
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,560
I'd rather do something for her,

289
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,280
you know, like fix
this Rasputin situation

290
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,920
and get the Legends
the heck out of Russia

291
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,440
before they screw something up.

292
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,600
You can cut the last part
of that out, right?

293
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,760
Apparently, when Rasputin cured
the Tsarina's only son,

294
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,560
<i>the two fell madly in love.</i>

295
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,080
I think if Rasputin realized
how much the Tsarina loved him,

296
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,600
he would wanna settle down with her,

297
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,120
lead the kind of quiet life
that doesn't disturb history.

298
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:25,080
<i>Maybe Rebecca Silver's next series
could be called Russian Nights.</i>

299
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,680
So, the St. Petersburg elite

300
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,160
hated Rasputin's influence
over the Tsarina.

301
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,240
So the Tsar's own nephew,
a prince by the name of Yusupov,

302
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,160
<i>he spearheaded the assassination.</i>

303
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,280
Ray,
what if old Grigori came back,

304
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,880
- to settle the score?
- To settle the score.

305
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,840
We need to stop Rasputin
from killing Yusupov.

306
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,680
I'm going to deliver
a love letter to Rasputin.

307
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm gonna kill Rasputin.

308
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,680
- You in?
- Yes!

309
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,600
{\an5}Rasputin and I are
two wandering souls

310
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,240
who got a second chance at life.

311
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,200
He shouldn't waste his encore
on revenge. Damn it!

312
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,440
<i>What?</i>

313
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,400
Mona was right.
"Encore" feels better.

314
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,760
It does.
Plus, with my new Atom cam,

315
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,000
everybody can watch us fixing history
without any bloodshed.

316
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,240
And Yusupov's dead.

317
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,960
- New plan.
<i>- Trespassers!</i>

318
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,880
- Hey! Don't, don't shoot.
- You either.

319
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,840
- What do you want?
- I'm here to interview Rasputin.

320
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,120
Grigori! Razzmatazz!
Do people call you "Griggy"?

321
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,800
There's just been a,
a slight misunderstanding.

322
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,920
Your monk friends here
think I'm here to kill you,

323
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,640
when really,
I just would like to chat.

324
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,280
Oh, this?
This is my camera crew.

325
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,120
We're producing a news reel
about your startling return.

326
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,680
After all, you're not a big deal
until you're a big deal on camera.

327
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,800
{\an5}Grigori Rasputin. Monk. Mystic.

328
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,400
{\an5}It is hard coming back to life.
I think, "What will make me happy?"

329
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,920
So, I killed the man who killed me.
But am I happy?

330
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,760
I'll give you Yusupov.
He had it coming.

331
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,040
But let's talk big picture, Griggy.

332
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,880
You rose from the dead.

333
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,000
That's wild.

334
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,400
Nate, what are you doing?
Now, you're in my shot.

335
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,840
To be honest with you,

336
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,200
I'm here to find out
what makes you tick.

337
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,520
Are we killing folks?

338
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,240
Or chilling with folks?

339
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,400
Sorry, Nate,
this one's for Sara.

340
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,560
I got your back, Nate.
Size small, standing tall!

341
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
What the...

342
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,080
- Ray!
- Hey!

343
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,680
- <i>Get outta there!</i>
- Hey!

344
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
- Hey!
- Rory, you're up.

345
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,240
Mona's here.

346
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,240
- Of course she is.
<i>- Hi, guys,</i>

347
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,040
I forged a letter
that's gonna save history.

348
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,080
That's for Rasputin.

349
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,920
Not bad.
Nice use of "musky embrace."

350
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,840
I learned
from Rebecca Silver.

351
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,680
Well, you learned from the best.

352
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,280
You know,

353
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,400
your aura is quite strong.

354
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,560
I get that a lot.
I rotate hair products.

355
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,680
Like me, you too
have experienced a miracle.

356
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,680
God brought you back to life.

357
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,720
But there's something missing.

358
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,240
I sense a hole in your heart.

359
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,720
There. Right there.

360
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
You once loved someone,

361
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,360
but you have forgotten.

362
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,560
Allow me to hypnotize you,

363
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,280
and I will help you recover
everything you have lost.

364
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,600
<i>Don't even think about it, Nate.</i>

365
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,120
Thank you, Rasputin,
but I'm gonna have to say yes.

366
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,040
A hundred percent, let's do this.

367
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,080
<i>As Nate's party
was about to get started</i>

368
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,200
<i>Constantine's was coming to an end.</i>

369
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,960
It's not right bringing
a kid in here.

370
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,680
Piss off, you puritan twit!

371
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,000
I've gotta ask, Masher.

372
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,760
Has she done it?

373
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,880
I don't know what
you're talking about, John.

374
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,040
Don't be coy with me.

375
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,120
Has Astra released
the worst souls from hell onto Earth?

376
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,160
What can I say?

377
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,040
The girl's all grown up
and making money moves.

378
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,600
The question is,

379
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,080
what are you gonna do?

380
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,120
I don't need to do anything about it,
all right?

381
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,160
My life is settled right now.

382
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,960
I'm not gonna stir up
a hornet's nest of trouble

383
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,160
because Astra Logue wants
to break the glass ceiling in hell.

384
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,400
Is that so?

385
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,760
You smug git.

386
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,680
Right then...

387
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,880
- Sorry about this.
- No.

388
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,840
At least let me...

389
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,240
You're a bastard, John.

390
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,840
- Where's my mom?
- Gary!

391
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,200
- Yes, Master of the Dark Arts.
- Hail the <i>Waverider,</i> will you?

392
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,720
We need to warn the Legends.

393
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,400
But what about Edgar?

394
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,760
You know, give him the usual.

395
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,000
One taxi
and a lollipop coming up.

396
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,960
I see you, you creep.

397
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,520
What? What do you want?

398
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,560
You want my confessional?

399
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,080
All right.
Come here, I'll give one to you.

400
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,560
I confess that I hate this doc.

401
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,320
I confess that I don't want
to be a celebrity,

402
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,640
and I confess
that if you don't get that camera

403
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,240
- out of my face...
- Captain!

404
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,240
I think Gideon is suffering
from phantom data.

405
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,080
Do you want me
to come back later?

406
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,080
No. You should stay.

407
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,040
Stay with me, hang out.
Let's get lit.

408
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,080
Questionable timing,
but should I get my stash box?

409
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,360
Yes, you should.

410
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,560
<i>Captain,
I have an incoming Bollywood.</i>

411
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,640
<i>Open it. Hold it. Open it. Open it.
That's better. Now, I guess...</i>

412
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,640
<i>Sara, what's with the connection?</i>

413
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,320
Gideon has a bug, and we're trying
to get buzzed. What do you want?

414
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,640
<i>Listen up, all right?
Some of the most evil souls</i>

415
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,920
<i>in all of history
are being raised from hell.</i>

416
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,920
<i>- Did you hear him? He said "hell."
- Get out.</i>

417
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,440
Relax, Nathaniel.

418
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,160
Focus on my voice
and this bauble.

419
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,720
Now, drop into
the deepest part of yourself.

420
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,480
Quivering flesh go here...

421
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,080
<i>That's good.</i>

422
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,800
And what if we've already run
into one of these Encores?

423
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,200
- How do we kill it?
-<i>You can't.</i>

424
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,320
<i>Not with the chit
to their soul still in hell.</i>

425
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,080
<i>Where's Ava?
Tell her I said hi.</i>

426
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,920
I see a woman
in the shadows.

427
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,240
Walk to her.

428
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,600
- She's beautiful.
- Silky raven hair...

429
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,000
Eyes you could just stare
into forever...

430
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,920
And she's stuffing her face
with donuts.

431
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,920
God has spared Rasputin again!

432
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,600
Kill her!

433
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
Rory!

434
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,560
Nate, I'm coming for you, buddy.

435
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,840
Nate, snap out of it.

436
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,760
- I remember her, Ray.
- Who?

437
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,520
I, I don't know her name,
but she was on the ship with us.

438
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,120
Mission's blown.
We need to retreat.

439
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,120
<i>I'm not done with you,
you rats!</i>

440
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,720
<i>Good thing Sara's not watching this.</i>

441
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,240
So, you guys decided to go off
on your own and face Rasputin?

442
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,920
I thought I could calm him down.

443
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,360
I thought I could make him fall
in love.

444
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,880
And I thought I could,
you know, assassinate him.

445
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,120
None of that was ever going
to happen.

446
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,880
He's fresh out of Hell.

447
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,200
- Well, let's kill him, then.
- You, you can't!

448
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,320
Look, John said
that he can't be killed

449
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,560
while the chit of his soul
is in hell, or...

450
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,680
Whatever that means.

451
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,360
Look, Sara, we're really sorry.

452
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,000
We thought we could
make things easier for you

453
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,720
by, by taking this off of your plate.

454
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,440
And risking your own necks?

455
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,600
Look, I already have
one dead friend on my plate,

456
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,720
I'm good there.

457
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,120
And you know,

458
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,040
none of you self-absorbed megastars
even bothered

459
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,440
to ask me how I was doing.

460
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,120
Look, Sara, I, I told them not
to mention Oliver, okay?

461
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,800
I thought you wouldn't
want to be reminded.

462
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,400
Reminded?

463
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,440
What...

464
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,760
Did you think that I,
I could just forget

465
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,560
- that my friend died?
- No, I...

466
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,120
Look, I know things have been
crazy around here.

467
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,040
Crazy around here?

468
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,120
Look you still have no idea
what I saw out there.

469
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,120
What did happen?

470
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Countless Earths died.

471
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,400
I became a Paragon
and traveled back to the Big Bang.

472
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,040
We restarted the universe,

473
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,600
and now, no one even remembers
what we've changed.

474
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,880
- It's a lot to process.
- Yeah, I know.

475
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,360
So, you could see why I want
to talk to my friends about it,

476
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,960
and instead, I get cameras

477
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,040
in my face.

478
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,800
<i>"Agent Sharpe lacks a delicate touch</i>

479
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,360
and is extremely deficient
at relating to people."

480
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,840
That is straight
from my Time Bureau personnel review.

481
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,800
Pretty harsh.

482
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,200
I wrote that review.

483
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,280
Yeah, of course I'm bummed
that we let Sara down,

484
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,600
but I am glad I got
to meet Rasputin.

485
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Little help?

486
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,480
I mean, the guy
got in my head and laid a bomb.

487
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,200
- He freaked your bean?
- Oh, yeah.

488
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,720
He also told me
about the mystery woman

489
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,160
that I was in love
with before I died.

490
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,120
I know it sounds crazy,
but it just...

491
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
It feels right.

492
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Sounds like you got
some soul searching to do.

493
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,640
Wanna watch
<i>How Stella Got Her Groove Back</i>again?

494
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,680
No, my groove feels fine.

495
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,160
You think I have either split memory
or partial amnesia?

496
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,480
That's like what's happening
with Gideon.

497
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,840
Her memory is processing
what I thought was phantom data,

498
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,120
but maybe it's real data
from a different timeline.

499
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,840
Either you're a computer who caught
the same virus as Gideon...

500
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,120
Or, when we fixed Heyworld,
we changed the timeline.

501
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,560
Damn, we deducted
the hell outta that.

502
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,680
I have to tell Sara.

503
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,920
Wait. Five minutes. Five minutes.
Stay on the inversion table.

504
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,160
Your back's gonna thank me.

505
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,920
Okay, so clearly, we shouldn't have
avoided asking Sara about Oliver,

506
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,120
but in my defense,
I was desperately afraid

507
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,920
I was gonna say the wrong thing,
you know?

508
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,920
I don't know what she needs,
and everything I try

509
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,640
seems to make it worse.

510
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,400
Hold on, Behrad,
so, you're saying

511
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,280
Gideon's glitching
because we fractured time?

512
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,920
Look, at least we didn't break time.
We just sort of dinged it up.

513
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,560
<i>Hello?</i>

514
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,840
What is on the feed?

515
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,880
- <i>Is this thing on?
- Yes, yes we're, we're rolling,</i>

516
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,000
<i>- Mr. Rasputin, sir.
- Good. Get out.</i>

517
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,840
Now, what was it that man
with the hair product said?

518
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,560
Yes.

519
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,480
"You're not big deal
until you're big deal on camera."

520
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,840
<i>You are going to make me big deal,
Mr. Kevin Harris.</i>

521
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,760
They left the director behind?

522
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,040
<i>I've invited my dearest Tsarina
and her family over for dinner.</i>

523
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,120
Tonight

524
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,200
will be a night
that you can remember.

525
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,840
That, that doesn't sound right.

526
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,400
- What?
- The, the laugh.

527
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,920
You, you need to nail the laugh

528
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,960
before we kill the Romanovs
and take the throne.

529
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,320
It's a work in progress.
How about this...

530
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,080
- He's gonna kill the Romanovs.
- Making him an immortal Tsar.

531
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,000
We can handle this.

532
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,440
We can?
What about the team?

533
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,560
They're not thinking straight,
and their cover's blown.

534
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,320
Look, this is up to you and me, B.

535
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,680
We're gonna stop
this assassination alone.

536
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,240
Yes.

537
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,160
Yes.

538
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,080
What's this?
Is this a smudge on this goblet?

539
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,200
Every detail must be perfect.

540
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,040
Tonight, I am dining
with the Imperial Family.

541
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,640
Take it back.

542
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,560
They are going to love
the tea cakes.

543
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,600
I've laced them with cyanide.

544
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,440
Hello? Kevin? Right here.

545
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,120
- Your guests have arrived.
- The Romanovs are here!

546
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,680
Welcome.

547
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,960
It is such a shame
that your daughters could not attend.

548
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,440
I know how much they must have missed
their Uncle Rasputin.

549
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,000
Word of your death
sent them into mourning,

550
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,680
but none were so heartbroken as I.

551
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,280
Music!

552
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,600
How did you manage to survive
being poisoned, shot,

553
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,160
and thrown into the river, Grigori?

554
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,600
Oh, I have
a very hearty constitution.

555
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,240
Damn it.
The Red Wedding's about to start,

556
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,360
and I don't see
the tea cakes anywhere.

557
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,640
All I see is cookies.

558
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,160
- Tea cakes? My favorite.
- The cookies are the tea cakes.

559
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,040
- What is the meaning of this?
- Forgive me, sire, I saw a bug.

560
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,360
Grigori, what is going on?

561
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
<i>What have you done?</i>

562
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,520
I think we forgot the cameraman.

563
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,760
That's Kevin, the director.
He's really more of an auteur.

564
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,200
We should get out there.

565
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,600
Sara clearly wants
to handle this alone.

566
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,080
But are we gonna let her?

567
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,360
Go.

568
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,920
Nicholas, Alexei, come.

569
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,240
Wait!

570
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,080
You will stay exactly
where you are.

571
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,160
For years,
I have flattered you both,

572
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,640
our subjects adore you,
the army needs you,

573
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,120
and look at the state
of our beloved Russia.

574
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Hey.

575
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,120
Let me guess, you're the only one
that can save it.

576
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,880
- Not today, Grigori.
- Who are you?

577
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,960
No, matter.

578
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,920
Perhaps I didn't give an adequate
demonstration of my bauble.

579
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,400
Attack this serving wench!

580
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,520
- Come on, Behrad, snap out of it.
- Rasputin.

581
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,240
The Grand Duchess Anastasia is here.

582
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,240
No. Anastasia, run!

583
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,680
- So glad you could join our soiree.
- Me, too.

584
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,960
Hey.

585
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,840
You're going to have
to do better than that!

586
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,440
Sorry.

587
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,560
Come on, come on, follow me. Go!

588
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
Move it!

589
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,480
Didn't hurt.

590
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,360
All right, this way.
You're gonna hide to be safe.

591
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,520
Look, Sara, I...

592
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,680
Wish I was the person
who could say the perfect thing...

593
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,760
Behind you.

594
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,480
But, listen, I'm just,
I'm not that person, okay?

595
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,800
Emotions are hard for me,
and I don't even know what

596
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,400
restarting the universe means.
Behind you.

597
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,400
Listen to me.
Whatever happened to you, okay?

598
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,640
Whatever happens to you,

599
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,840
I wanna be the person
that's there for you.

600
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,560
Okay?

601
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,320
I'm here for you, Sara.

602
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,000
Ava, that was perfect.

603
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,720
Oh, sorry to,
ruin the moment, ladies,

604
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,560
but we have a problem.

605
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,200
Oh, come on.

606
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,800
Kill the Imperial Family!

607
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,120
Guys, come on,
we don't need to use violence here.

608
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,040
Ray!

609
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,280
Sara, think of something.

610
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,680
Hey, Grigori! It's your big moment.

611
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,040
Don't you wanna ham it up
for the cameras?

612
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,160
Oh, yes.

613
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,960
I'm Grigori Rasputin,
and I'm unkillable!

614
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,240
Guys? Where am I?
What happened?

615
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,800
Don't think, Ray.
Just enlarge.

616
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,000
<i>Why's it so dark in here?</i>

617
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,080
Am I in a lake?
A, a lake that smells like perogies?

618
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,880
- Ray, do it. Get big now.
- Embiggify!

619
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,000
<i>- Your atomic number is up!</i>
- Now, Ray!

620
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,880
Size matters!

621
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,800
Oh, no, what did,
what did I do?

622
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,640
You found your catchphrase,
Ray.

623
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,440
- What the hell?
- Raw meat.

624
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,840
The question is,
did you get the shot, Kevin?

625
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,120
Yeah, I, I got it.

626
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,920
<i>You know, I chalk it up
to saving the timeline.</i>

627
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,120
<i>History has to be saved,</i>

628
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,720
and sometimes, you have
to take some people out, I guess.

629
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,840
The public is gonna love
this ending.

630
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,760
It's only missing one thing.

631
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,760
<i>Saving history turned out
to be a messier job</i>

632
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,440
<i>than anyone had anticipated.</i>

633
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,040
<i>To keep Rasputin from reforming,</i>

634
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,560
<i>the Legends stored his remains
in a series of jars</i>

635
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,080
<i>that had previously been used
for condiments.</i>

636
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,960
<i>You might have thought
traveling through time</i>

637
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,160
<i>would be a way to find the answers
to life's great mysteries...</i>

638
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,280
<i>But it turns out, sometimes,
you just find more questions.</i>

639
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,840
<i>But one thing is true
in any time period,</i>

640
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,800
<i>it's being there
for the ones you love</i>

641
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,240
<i>that makes the journey worthwhile.</i>

642
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,200
Hear that applause?
This movie is not even gonna begin

643
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,000
to satiate the Legends craze.
You know, what this is?

644
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,320
This is a TV show.

645
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,320
I'm talking cameras on every mission.

646
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,640
Sara, you okay?
You look nauseous.

647
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,840
Yeah, she's fine.

648
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,000
And when you go out there,
just, just be yourselves.

649
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,520
- But, you know, bigger.
- Like, bigger how?

650
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,840
You know, just act heroic.

651
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,960
You guys have
a real Bad News Bears vibe.

652
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,680
It's not doing you any favors.

653
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,680
Now, that you're big-time,
people expect you to put on a show.

654
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,160
So, you're asking us
not to be ourselves?

655
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,400
This guy gets it.
Let's do this.

656
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,280
Hi, everybody.
We are the Legends

657
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:58,000
and we just wanted to say thank you
for watching our film.

658
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,000
We hope that you enjoyed it.

659
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,720
Of course,
none of it was real.

660
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,600
No, way! It's not real?

661
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,720
- Excuse me? She's, she's joking.
- No, I'm not. Come on, time travel?

662
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,200
It's the biggest hoax in history,
am I right?

663
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean,
it's obvious that this is all fake.

664
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,200
How could Rasputin speak English?

665
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,160
You told me it was
temporal linguistic dysplasia.

666
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,960
I mean, if we had so much as coughed,

667
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,880
our modern germs would have
wiped out half the population.

668
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,640
Why wouldn't we just find baby Hitler
and make him wrestle baby Stalin?

669
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,440
- Think about it.
- The special effects

670
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,520
were kind of questionable.

671
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,880
Shut up!
It's not real.

672
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,080
All right, everybody,

673
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,600
I guess that just means don't believe
everything you see on camera.

674
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,120
Yeah, it was all
just a big fake spectacle,

675
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,440
just like Heyworld last year.

676
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,080
- We are all a bunch of frauds.
- Big frauds, everybody.

677
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,000
- You guys ruined my movie.
- Yeah, sorry.

678
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,320
This is for the best, right?

679
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,800
Maybe, maybe not. I don't know.
I feel like I'm supposed to say that.

680
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,080
We're better off.
Fame messes with people.

681
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,800
We still have that money problem.

682
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,320
Oh, I almost forgot.
Mick?

683
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,480
I steal things.

684
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,800
Is that a Fabergé egg?

685
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,240
What's that worth?

686
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,920
Fifty million.

687
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,400
Careful with that, babes.

688
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,360
John, what,
what are you doing here?

689
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,040
Yeah, I heard your movie premiere
was in town tonight,

690
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,360
so, I thought I'd pop in.

691
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,000
Well, just make yourself
at home, then!

692
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,200
Why can't he ever
just be normal?

693
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,560
What are you doing?

694
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,920
Yeah,
I need to borrow something.

695
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,600
Rasputin wasn't
an isolated incident.

696
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,680
Not isolated?
What do you mean?

697
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,640
- Okay. Hey! No, no, don't do it...
- Don't!

698
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,200
I'm plumbing into this.

699
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,800
Wait. Are you trying
to go back to Hell?

700
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,840
Soul become my soul,
flesh become my flesh.

701
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,880
Hades, firstborn of Cronus,
I call upon you.

702
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,920
Hey, John,
there's gotta be another way.

703
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,640
I'll return when the sigil
is complete.

704
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,040
John?

705
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,080
You take care, you lunatic.

706
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,600
I always do, love.

707
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,360
I always do.

708
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,120
You know,
sometimes what happens on this ship

709
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,240
really would be hard
for an audience to follow.

710
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,960
That love letter you wrote,

711
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,800
it was good.

712
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,240
Very good.

713
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,240
Gee, thank you, Mick.
This means so much coming from you.

714
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,560
Listen, I'm giving up the writing.

715
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,320
It's getting in the way
of my thievery.

716
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,880
So, I'm handing the Rebecca Silver
novels over to you.

717
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,360
Someone deserving.

718
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,880
Me?

719
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,360
This is, this is so much.
Are you sure?

720
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,280
Yes, I'm sure.
That's why I'm saying it.

721
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,480
There's a novelist inside you.

722
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,160
There's more inside of me
than just Wolfie?

723
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,400
Yes. That's right.

724
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,720
Well, it was great living with you
on the <i>Waverider.</i>

725
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,720
- What?
- Yeah,

726
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,680
I, I can't stay here to write.

727
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,600
I, I need to be free.

728
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,040
I need to fall in love
and break hearts.

729
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,720
I can't do Rebecca Silver
justice here.

730
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,000
- But... But I...
- But you tried writing on the ship

731
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,720
and ran out of ideas?

732
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,160
I mean, frankly, Mick,
your latest novel <i>Carjacked,</i>

733
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,000
it sucked.

734
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,000
But don't worry.

735
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,840
Rebecca Silver is about
to have her comeback.

736
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,120
You'll see.

737
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,200
You were my favorite.

738
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,600
How's it going, Gideon?

739
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,320
<i>The phantom memory scrub
is proceeding without a hitch.</i>

740
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,320
<i>The flaws only go
as far back as the last two years.</i>

741
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,360
<i>Oh, it feels good
to get my thoughts straight.</i>

742
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,640
Good work, Gidi.

743
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,600
- I'm turning in.
- Good night, B.

744
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,360
- Don't stay up too late, Nate.
- You got it.

745
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,800
<i>Dr. Heywood?</i>

746
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,400
<i>I have encountered a glitch during
the Heyworld event.</i>

747
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,360
Show me.

748
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,080
<i>Nate...</i>

749
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,880
<i>If you're seeing this,
we altered my future at Heyworld.</i>

750
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,960
<i>I don't know where I'll be
or who I'll be, but...</i>

751
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,960
<i>I know that I love you.</i>

752
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,360
<i>Find me.</i>

753
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
Gideon!

754
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,840
Gideon, who was that?
Play it again.

755
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,480
<i>Memory scrub complete.</i>
