Thanks...

Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?
Handcuffs? What is this?

It's called abuse of power.

You told me
to round them up.

I didn't tell you
to hand...

00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,519
Cut 'em loose. Oh, man.
This is embarrassing.

I'm sorry, guys,
really, I...

you treat old friends?

know who the hell this guy is.

Doesn't matter who I am, Tej.
I'm, like, nobody, okay?

524
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:20,989
Nobody. So, then,
who is he?

525

Him? He's nothing.
He's, like, less than me.

Well, thanks
to your botched Berlin job,

you all made Interpol's

Top 10.

00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:42,844
That's all right.

00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,597
Well, not you, Roman.
What do you mean?

535
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,057
You just missed the cut.
You're number 11, so...

536
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,226
I'm... I missed?
Yeah.

537
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,853
ROMAN: That's impossible!

538
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:53,813
What number did
they come in at?

539
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,193
Six, eight, nine, ten.

540
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,445
She's 10?
Mmm-hmm.

541
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,614
That's impossible.
There's no way she's a 10.

542
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,532
Oh, she's definitely a 10.
(SCOFFS)

543
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:09,454
How about we focus on someone who
we're not gonna find on anybody's list.

544
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,414
We're awaiting
hard confirmation,

545
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:15,376
but I believe that's the cyber
terrorist known as Cipher.

546
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,380
Wait, no. Cipher's an organization.
Not a person.

547
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:20,673
Not according
to our sources.

548
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:21,966
What does she want?

549
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,176
No one knows.

550
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,428
Cipher is like
a digital act of God.

551
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:29,891
They... Well, she can manipulate
world systems from the shadows.

552
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,643
Anything that can be hacked
is hers to play with.

553
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:35,396
And here's the kicker.
You'll never find her linked to any of it.

554
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,733
Her digital identity is scrubbed
every few seconds, worldwide.

555
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,151
So, basically,
she's the bogeyman.

556
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,404
Damn, she's one of the hottest
bogeymans I've ever seen.

557
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,366
I mean, if y'all know her,
tell her to get at your boy.

won't mess with her.

why he's turned.

to track Dom.

it's kind of a big job.

in an extra pair of hands.

a whole hell of a lot better.

you wanna tell me why

you just put me in a room with this

Let's get one thing clear.
I ain't on your team.

586
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:17,290
I don't care about you, your
crew, or your little family.

587
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:18,750
I'm here for Cipher.

588
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,668
What are you gonna do, apply for a job?
Head Asshole?

You know, I think that tight T-shirt's
cutting off the circulation to your brain.

00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,214
You should get
a bigger size.

591
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:29,427
Cipher came to me first.
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.

592
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,012
When I said no,
she went after my brother.

593
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:34,307
Ah, yes, brother Owen.
Who could forget him, huh?

little black site prison.

596
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,440
Cipher corrupted him
and left him for dead.

597
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,775
So, if ll get a shot
to take her down,

598
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,109
believe me, Flex,
I'm taking it.

599

You're taking my boot right up your
ass, is what you're taking.

600
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,948
Guys, guys. The fastest way to
find Cipher is through Toretto.

601
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,450
Now, aside from myself,
there's only two men in the world

602
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,869
that have ever managed to actually
track him down with any success.

603
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,789
And guess what. They're both
standing in front of me right now.

you two are gonna work together.

I'm gonna take
that as a yes.

seeing this?

was where we started.

627
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,447
But Cipher's already
created an evasion

628
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,617
that masks their location by pinging
random spots all over the globe,

but it was
a good thought, Roman.

So, she's made
my program obsolete.

is why you're here.

You see, in order for God's Eye
to give off all these false pings,

636
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:39,348
means they have to be

01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,528
Da-da.

1116
01:22:30,112 --> 01:22:31,864
Please don't hurt him,
I'm begging you.

1117
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:34,324
I don't want you to beg.

1118
01:22:36,827 --> 01:22:38,287
I want you to learn.

1119
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:39,997
Learn what?

1120
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:44,960
I understand why you did what you did.
I really do.

1121
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:48,755
Da-da.

1122
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:53,469
But it was
the wrong choice.

1123
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:56,847
This is the consequence
of that.

1124
01:22:58,599 --> 01:22:59,600
(MUFFLED SCREAMING) No!

1125
01:22:59,766 --> 01:23:01,518
No! No!

1126
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:02,936
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

1127
01:23:04,271 --> 01:23:05,898
Save your son!

1128
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:07,399
No!

1129
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:08,650
(GUNSHOTS)

1130
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,402
(CRYING)

1131
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:18,410
(SHUSHING)

1132
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:33,842
(EXHALES)

1133
01:23:34,593 --> 01:23:37,054
Can you pull up the footage
from the guy in the alley?

1134
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:38,847
Traffic cams.

1135
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:40,015
I got you.

1136
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:45,604
I knew it.

1137
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:47,356
I recognize that guy.

1138
01:23:48,315 --> 01:23:49,566
That's Connor Rhodes.

1139
01:23:49,983 --> 01:23:52,653
I met him when I was working
with Shaw's brother.

1140
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:55,030
He wanted us to get
the Nightshade device for him.

1141
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:56,657
Connor Rhodes.

1142
01:23:57,491 --> 01:23:59,868
He's also linked to somebody
I'd quite like to forget.

1143
01:23:59,952 --> 01:24:01,453
It's Mose Jakande.

1144
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:04,122
Warlord who tried
to get God's Eye.

1145
01:24:04,206 --> 01:24:06,875
Which means that's twice that Dom
has messed up Cipher's business.

1146
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:22,182
Everything you're
feeling right now,

1147
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:25,185
this rage, a sense of
loss, it's not real.

1148
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:30,524
It's a survival instinct
wired deep into our brains

1149
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:33,277
to ensure continuation
of the species.

1150
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:37,948
When early man would
visit a watering hole,

1151
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:39,950
if they didn't
watch their child,

1152
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:42,452
and it got snatched
by a crocodile,

1153
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:49,501
our brains would create a
painful but instructional memory,

1154
01:24:50,961 --> 01:24:52,713
so it would
never happen again.

1155
01:24:54,965 --> 01:24:58,051
This idea of "family"
that is so core with you,

1156
01:24:58,218 --> 01:25:00,012
that rules your world,

1157
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:03,557
it's a biological lie.

1158
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:07,019
You don't
have to accept it.

1159
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:10,522
I don't.

1160
01:25:13,483 --> 01:25:16,486
Did you really think you
could destroy two of my teams

1161
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:18,322
without any repercussions?

1162
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:22,367
I wouldn't have even looked your
way if you hadn't done that.

1163
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:24,953
You didn't even know
you had a kid.

1164
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:29,875
You can thank me for that and start
doing the job I'm asking you to do.

1165
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:31,460
Help you start a war.

1166
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:33,462
Is that what
you think I want?

1167
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:37,424
That's so limited.

1168
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:41,053
I didn't take that football
to start a war

1169
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:43,847
any more than I took your
son to start a family.

1170
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:46,725
Taking your son
got me the codes.

1171
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:49,311
The codes will
get me the nukes

1172
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:51,772
and the nukes
will get me what I want

1173
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:56,360
today, tomorrow,
and every day after that.

1174
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:58,028
And what's that?

1175
01:26:00,197 --> 01:26:01,448
Accountability.

1176
01:26:03,909 --> 01:26:06,119
The second I fire off
one of those nukes,

1177
01:26:06,203 --> 01:26:09,581
I put the superpowers
of this world on notice that,

1178
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:11,208
when they cross the line,

1179
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:16,254
I'm gonna be there
to hold them responsible.

1180
01:26:18,048 --> 01:26:20,008
Because the truth is, Dom,

1181
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:22,094
to the world out there,

1182
01:26:25,055 --> 01:26:27,641
ll am the crocodile
at the watering hole.

1183
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:35,941
We've got one
last job to do.

1184
01:26:37,818 --> 01:26:39,111
DOM: Cipher.

1185
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:49,913
If I were you,
I'd kiss my son.

1186
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:57,546
Because whether you value it or
not, all of this,

1187
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:01,717
your plane,
your security, and you,

1188
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:04,803
are still on this earth
because of him.

1189
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,395
RAMSEY: The problem we've had with tracking
Cipher is there's nothing to trace.

1190
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:14,896
But now,
we have Rhodes' information.

1191
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:16,815
And we're getting
snapshots of his data

1192
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:18,650
before it's
scrubbed off the net.

1193
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:20,068
That looks like somebody's
bank account,

1194
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:21,403
so why don't we
just go ahead...

1195
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:22,654
It's a longitude.

1196
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:25,615
Given the fact that
Dom hit a Russian motorcade,

1197
01:27:25,699 --> 01:27:27,993
it's safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead and bring up the map.

1198
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,204
Good. Let's start here
and run the possibilities.

1199
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:34,624
Yalta, Poltava...

1200
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:36,168
It's like they just
threw letters together.

1201
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:37,502
Kronyu rt.

1202
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:38,795
MR. NOBODY: It's "VIadovin."

1203
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:40,547
What are you doing here?
What?

1204
01:27:40,714 --> 01:27:42,507
Told you I was gonna check
in on you from time to time

1205
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:43,592
to see how
you were doin".

1206
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:45,135
By the way, not so hot.

1207
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:48,346
But there's nothing
in Vladovin. It's justice.

1208
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:49,598
That's funny.

1209
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:51,808
Could've sworn there was a
secret Russian naval base

1210
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:53,810
where they retrofitted
Cold War submarines.

1211
01:27:53,894 --> 01:27:56,188
Well, technically,
it's not Russian anymore.

1212
01:27:56,855 --> 01:27:57,814
The base was taken over

1213
01:27:57,898 --> 01:28:00,192
by a terror group of military
separatists about a month ago,

1214
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:01,943
and the Russians
haven't taken it back yet,

1215
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:04,237
so there is a little
window of opportunity here.

1216
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:06,865
Russian submarines.
Nuclear football.

1217
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:10,202
It sounds like everything we
do, our legs gonna be blown off.

1218
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:13,622
It sounds like you still number
11 on the list. (CHUCKLES)

1219
01:28:14,164 --> 01:28:15,707
It sounds like
you've changed

1220
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:18,210
since your little punk-ass
facial hairs done came in.

1221
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:19,419
Guys, guys.

1222
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:21,838
Hey, we gotta call this in.
All the way up the chain.

1223
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:24,716
That's good thinking, champ,
except unfortunately,

1224
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,843
the Russian
Minister of Defense

1225
01:28:26,927 --> 01:28:29,679
got himself involved in a
little incident on US territory,

1226
01:28:29,763 --> 01:28:31,890
and the two governments aren't
talking to each other for a while.

1227
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,600
By the time they do,
it'll be too late.

1228
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:35,477
So, any other
suggestions?

1229
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,396
HOBBS: Yeah. I got one.

1230
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:41,066
How about we just
stop them ourselves?

1231
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:43,026
You're talking about
a Russian military base.

1232
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:44,277
Separatist.

1233
01:28:44,361 --> 01:28:45,445
Whatever.
It's suicide.

1234
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:46,988
It's stopping World War lll.

1235
01:28:49,115 --> 01:28:50,200
What's it gonna be, rook?

1236
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:52,786
You gonna close your
eyes on this one, too?

1237
01:28:52,953 --> 01:28:54,412
Pray that
the apocalypse doesn't come

1238
01:28:54,496 --> 01:28:55,914
knocking on your
mama's front door?

1239
01:28:56,623 --> 01:28:58,959
Or, are you gonna
saddle up, be a man,

1240
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:01,545
and save the entire
goddamn world?

1241
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:10,011
You know,
I think I figured it out.

1242
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:11,429
What's that?

1243
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:13,473
Rule number three.
Which is?

1244
01:29:14,975 --> 01:29:16,101
There are no rules.

1245
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:18,353
(MR. NOBODY LAUGHS)

1246
01:29:18,436 --> 01:29:21,565
What'd I tell you, Luke?
I knew he'd get it in three.

1247
01:29:21,731 --> 01:29:23,275
LITTLE NOBODY: Aerial
transport leaves in an hour.

1248
01:29:23,358 --> 01:29:25,944
Take whatever vehicle you want.
All bets are off.

1249
01:29:26,111 --> 01:29:27,821
All bets are off?
Bets are off?

1250
01:29:27,946 --> 01:29:29,281
Do svidanyal!

1251
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:56,808
Letty, I don't like
telling you this one bit.

1252
01:29:57,309 --> 01:29:58,768
But the game's changed.

1253
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:02,147
Before, we were just trying to catch
Dom, but now, after all this,

1254
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:04,149
I want you to know,
If 1 have to,

1255
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:06,776
I'm gonna put him down.

1256
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:11,406
Then you might have
to take us both down.

1257
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:14,451
ROMAN: I'm freezing, man.

1258
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:16,202
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
This ain't for me.

1259
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:19,205
I come from a different
kind of lifestyle, brah.

1260
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:24,836
Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with it.

1261
01:30:26,046 --> 01:30:30,008
I tried to take a piss,
I didn't even recognize myself.

1262
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:32,677
Man, that's entirely
too much information.

1263
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:33,929
I'm just sayin'.

1264
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:35,764
Well, one thing's
for sure.

1265
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:39,142
Dom's gotta be either working
with them or making a trade,

1266
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:40,685
because no one
would be this insane

1267
01:30:40,769 --> 01:30:42,354
to hit this place
without a damn army.

1268
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:45,690
I wouldn't be

02:03:44,042 --> 02:03:45,627
(LAUGHS)

1749
02:03:50,506 --> 02:03:54,636
You know, after 16 years,
I figure it's time for a little break.

1750
02:03:55,261 --> 02:03:56,429
Wow.

1751
02:03:58,014 --> 02:04:00,016
Daddy's stayin' home.

1752
02:04:01,392 --> 02:04:02,685
(LAUGHS)

1753
02:04:06,481 --> 02:04:07,523
Nobody.

1754
02:04:07,607 --> 02:04:08,650
Keep in touch.

1755
02:04:09,108 --> 02:04:10,693
Ah. Hang on a second.

1756
02:04:11,027 --> 02:04:13,196
This could be interesting.

1757
02:04:18,076 --> 02:04:19,243
(SIGHS) What made
you think I'd do it?

1758
02:04:20,495 --> 02:04:21,746
Brotherhood.

1759
02:04:21,829 --> 02:04:25,416
I saw that look you gave
Cipher, knew you wanted revenge.

1760
02:04:25,750 --> 02:04:27,251
Glad I did it.

1761
02:04:30,588 --> 02:04:33,091
I can't believe
you went to see my mother.

1762
02:04:34,133 --> 02:04:36,386
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

1763
02:04:48,398 --> 02:04:50,400
All this fuss over you.

1764
02:04:51,067 --> 02:04:52,402
(COOING)

1765
02:04:56,406 --> 02:04:57,865
Yes.

1766
02:05:02,912 --> 02:05:06,040
Elena, I promised
to keep our son safe.

1767
02:05:08,209 --> 02:05:10,378
And now,
he always will be.

1768
02:05:18,469 --> 02:05:22,765
I wanna introduce you to the most
important person in my universe.

1769
02:05:24,434 --> 02:05:26,853
One who never gave up on me.

1770
02:05:32,567 --> 02:05:33,609
He's beautiful.

1771
02:05:35,403 --> 02:05:36,946
<i>DOW.: You've heard me say</i>

1772
02:05:37,488 --> 02:05:39,699
that you never turn
your back on family,

1773
02:05:41,659 --> 02:05:45,747
and I wanna thank you all for
never turning your back on me.

1774
02:05:50,293 --> 02:05:51,878
You wanna meet them?

1775
02:05:52,587 --> 02:05:54,088
All right.

1776
02:05:54,881 --> 02:05:56,257
Everyone,

1777
02:05:57,550 --> 02:05:58,968
meet Brian.

1778
02:06:00,053 --> 02:06:01,929
(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

1779
02:06:04,849 --> 02:06:05,850
(COOING)

1780
02:06:08,227 --> 02:06:09,479
HOBBS: To Brian!

1781
02:06:09,562 --> 02:06:11,439
ROMAN: Welcome
to the family, Brian.

1782
02:06:11,522 --> 02:06:14,233
Okay, I guess
it's my turn to say grace.

1783
02:06:14,692 --> 02:06:17,236
We thank you
for giving us family.

1784
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:21,657
We sit here in praise.
Thank you for giving us the strength...
