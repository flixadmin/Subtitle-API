1
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,240
Easy, boy.

2
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,270
What do you expect?
They're savages.

3
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,770
One lot steals a goat from another lot,

4
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,240
before you know it
they're ripping each other to pieces.

5
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,820
I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this.

6
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,120
I never seen a thing like this,
not ever in my life.

7
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,410
How close did you get?

8
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,950
- Close as any man would.
- We should head back to the Wall.

9
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,040
Do the dead frighten you?

10
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,290
Our orders were to track the wildlings.

11
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,630
We tracked them.
They won't trouble us no more.

12
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,170
You don't think he'll ask us how they died?

13
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,220
Get back on your horse.

14
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,440
Whatever did it to them
could do it to us.

15
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,150
They even killed the children.

16
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,110
It's a good thing we're not children.

17
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,280
You want to run away south,
run away.

18
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,320
Of course,
they will behead you as a deserter.

19
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,580
If I don't catch you first.

20
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,250
Get back on your horse.

21
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,710
I won't say it again.

22
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,320
Your dead men seem
to have moved camp.

23
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,700
They were here.

24
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,750
See where they went.

25
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,130
What is it?

26
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,550
It's...

27
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,090
Go on, Father's watching.

28
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,010
And your mother.

29
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,520
Fine work, as always.
Well done.

30
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,310
Thank you.

31
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,270
I love the detail that you've managed
to get in these corners.

32
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,190
Quite beautiful.

33
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,190
The stitching...

34
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,530
Oh, no, no, no. This stitch is very...

35
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,200
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

36
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,130
And which one of you
was a marksman at ten?

37
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,680
Keep practicing, Bran.

38
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,810
Go on.

39
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,600
Don't think too much, Bran.

40
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,190
Relax your bow arm.

41
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,830
- Quick, Bran!
- Faster.

42
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,410
Lord Stark!

43
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,500
My lady.

44
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,750
A guardsman just rode in from the hills.

45
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,880
They've captured a deserter
from the Night's Watch.

46
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,300
Get the lads to saddle their horses.

47
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,390
Do you have to?

48
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,600
He swore an oath, Cat.

49
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,730
Law is law, my lady.

50
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,810
Tell Bran he's coming too.

51
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,320
Ned.

52
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,740
Ten is too young
to see such things.

53
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,400
He won't be a boy forever.

54
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,080
And winter is coming.

55
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,430
Good lad, go run back and get the rest.

56
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,150
White walkers.

57
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,980
I saw the white walkers.

58
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,980
White walkers.

59
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,150
The white walkers, I saw them.

60
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,580
I know I broke my oath.

61
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,290
And I know I'm a deserter.

62
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,840
I should have gone back to the Wall
and warned them, but...

63
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,010
I saw what I saw.

64
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,680
I saw the white walkers.

65
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,470
People need to know.

66
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,470
If you can get word to my family...

67
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,890
tell them I'm no coward.

68
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,980
Tell them I'm sorry.

69
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,660
Forgive me, Lord.

70
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,210
In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

71
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,300
- the first of his name...
- Don't look away.

72
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,260
...King of the Andals and the First Men...
- Father will know if you do.

73
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,720
...Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and protector of the realm,

74
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,720
I, Eddard of the House Stark,

75
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,390
Lord of Winterfell
and Warden of the North,

76
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,980
sentence you to die.

77
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,450
You did well.

78
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,110
You understand why I did it?

79
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,110
Jon said he was a deserter.

80
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,780
But do you understand
why I had to kill him?

81
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,530
"Our way is the old way"?

82
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,830
The man who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.

83
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,250
Is it true he saw the white walkers?

84
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,250
The white walkers have been gone
for thousands of years.

85
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,920
So he was lying?

86
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,760
A madman sees what he sees.

87
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,620
What is it?

88
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,670
Mountain lion?

89
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,380
There are no mountain lions
in these woods.

90
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,350
It's a freak.

91
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,020
It's a direwolf.

92
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,530
Tough old beast.

93
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,910
There are no direwolves
south of the Wall.

94
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,080
Now there are five.

95
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,370
You want to hold it?

96
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,420
Where will they go?

97
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,250
Their mother's dead.

98
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,920
They don't belong down here.

99
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,840
Better a quick death.
They won't last without their mother.

100
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,970
- Right. Give it here.
- No!

101
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,760
Put away your blade.

102
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,810
- I take orders from your father, not you.
- Please, Father!

103
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,730
I'm sorry, Bran.

104
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,890
Lord Stark?

105
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,190
There are five pups.

106
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,650
One for each of the Stark children.

107
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,280
The direwolf is the sigil of your house.

108
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,870
They were meant to have them.

109
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,290
You will train them yourselves.

110
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,290
You will feed them yourselves.

111
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,290
And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.

112
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,640
What about you?

113
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,180
I'm not a Stark.

114
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,390
Get on.

115
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,900
What is it?

116
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,620
The runt of the litter.
That one's yours, Snow.

117
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,980
As your brother,
I feel it's my duty to warn you...

118
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,230
you worry too much.

119
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,690
- It's starting to show.
- And you never worry about anything.

120
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,900
When we were seven and you jumped off
the cliffs at Casterly Rock,

121
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:25,410
100-foot drop into the water...
you were never afraid.

122
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,160
There was nothing to be afraid of
until you told Father.

123
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,870
"We're Lannisters.
Lannisters don't act like fools. "

124
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,840
- What if Jon Arryn told someone?
- But who would he tell?

125
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,340
My husband.

126
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,220
If he told the king, both our heads would be
skewered on the city gates by now.

127
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,890
Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know,
it died with him.

128
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,600
And Robert will choose
a new Hand of the King,

129
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,310
someone to do his job while he's off
fucking boars and hunting whores.

130
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,110
Or is it the other way around?

131
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,990
And life will go on.

132
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,700
You should be the Hand of the King.

133
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,410
That's an honor I can do without.

134
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,160
Their days are too long,

135
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,950
their lives are too short.

136
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,700
All these years,

137
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,960
and I still feel like an outsider
when I come here.

138
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,460
You have five northern children.

139
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,000
You're not an outsider.

140
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,630
I wonder if the old gods agree.

141
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,760
It's your gods with all the rules.

142
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,850
I am so sorry, my love.

143
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,610
- Tell me.
- There was a raven from King's Landing.

144
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,280
Jon Arryn is dead.

145
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,910
A fever took him.

146
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,950
I know he was like a father to you.

147
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,120
- Your sister, the boy?
- They both have their health,

148
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,250
gods be good.

149
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,850
The raven brought more news.

150
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,350
The king rides for Winterfell...

151
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,190
with the queen and all the rest of them.

152
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,440
If he's coming this far north...

153
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,030
there's only one thing he's after.

154
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,530
You can always say no, Ned.

155
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,590
We'll need plenty of candles
for Lord Tyrion's chamber.

156
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,460
- I'm told he reads all night.
- I'm told he drinks all night.

157
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,760
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his...

158
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,430
stature?

159
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,430
We've brought up eight barrels of ale
from the cellar.

160
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,770
Perhaps we'll find out.

161
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,730
In any case, candles.

162
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,780
Why is your mother so dead set on us
getting pretty for the king?

163
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,650
It's for the queen, I bet.
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.

164
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,820
I hear the prince is a right royal prick.

165
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,410
Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab
with his right royal prick.

166
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,460
Go on, Tommy, shear him good.

167
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,880
He's never met a girl he likes better
than his own hair.

168
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,540
Gods, but they grow fast.

169
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,500
Brandon!

170
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,630
I saw the king.
He's got hundreds of people.

171
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,840
How many times have I told you?
No climbing.

172
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:54,930
But he's coming right now, down our road.

173
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,350
I want you to promise me,

174
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,150
no more climbing.

175
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,150
I promise.

176
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,370
- Do you know what?
- What?

177
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,700
You always look at your feet
before you lie.

178
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,620
Run and find your father.

179
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,790
Tell him the king is close.

180
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:13,590
Where's Arya?
Sansa, where's your sister?

181
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,060
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Oh.

182
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,100
What are you doing with that on?

183
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,610
Go on.

184
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,650
Move!

185
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,650
Your Grace.

186
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,830
You've got fat.

187
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,470
- Cat!
- Your Grace.

188
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,060
Nine years... Why haven't I seen you?
Where the hell have you been?

189
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:30,730
Guarding the North for you, Your Grace.
Winterfell is yours.

190
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,190
- Where's the Imp?
- Will you shut up?

191
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,820
Who have we here?

192
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,530
You must be Robb.

193
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,620
My, you're a pretty one.

194
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,910
Your name is?

195
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,410
Arya.

196
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,210
Oh, show us your muscles.

197
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,840
You'll be a soldier.

198
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,140
That's Jaime Lannister,
the queen's twin brother.

199
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,390
Would you please shut up?

200
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,820
My queen.

201
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,940
Take me to your crypt.
I want to pay my respects.

202
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,910
We've been riding for a month, my love.

203
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,030
Surely the dead can wait.

204
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,030
Ned.

205
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,920
Where's the Imp?

206
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,430
Where is our brother?

207
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,300
Go and find the little beast.

208
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,350
Tell me about Jon Arryn.

209
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,810
One minute he was fine and then...

210
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,770
burned right through him,
whatever it was.

211
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,940
I loved that man.

212
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,400
We both did.

213
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:06,860
He never had to teach you much,
but me? You remember me at 16?

214
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,830
All I wanted to do

215
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,580
was crack skulls and fuck girls.

216
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,830
- He showed me what was what.
- Aye.

217
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,580
Don't look at me like that.
It's not his fault I didn't listen.

218
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,170
I need you, Ned,

219
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,970
down at King's Landing, not up here
where you're no damn use to anybody.

220
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,640
Lord Eddard Stark...

221
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,060
I would name you the Hand of the King.

222
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,650
I'm not worthy of the honor.

223
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,190
I'm not trying to honor you.

224
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,030
I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom

225
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:48,870
while I eat, drink and whore my way
to an early grave.

226
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,830
Damn it, Ned, stand up.

227
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,330
You helped me win the Iron Throne,

228
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,170
now help me keep the damn thing.

229
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,670
We were meant to rule together.

230
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:03,630
If your sister had lived,
we'd have been bound by blood.

231
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,170
Well, it's not too late.

232
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,510
I have a son,
you have a daughter.

233
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,010
We'll join our houses.

234
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:41,170
It is true what they say
about the northern girls.

235
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,720
Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?

236
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,470
I did hear something about that.

237
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,770
And the queen and her twin brother.

238
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,940
They say that he is the most handsome man
in the Seven Kingdoms.

239
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,940
And the other brother?

240
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,270
- The queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one...

241
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,190
and there's the clever one.

242
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,990
Mmm...

243
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,370
I hear they call him the Imp.

244
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,280
I hear he hates that nickname.

245
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,790
Oh? I hear he's more than earned it.

246
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,160
I hear he's a drunken little lecher,

247
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,750
prone to all manner of perversions.

248
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,670
Clever girl.

249
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,260
We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.

250
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,180
Have you?

251
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,680
- Already?
- Oh!

252
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,310
The gods gave me one blessing.

253
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,690
- Don't get up.
- My lord.

254
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,490
Should I explain to you the meaning of
a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?

255
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,650
You have much to teach me, no doubt,

256
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,950
but our sister craves your attention.

257
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,660
She has odd cravings, our sister.

258
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,830
A family trait.

259
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,420
Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown.

260
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:07,380
- Don't leave me alone with these people.
- I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early.

261
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,840
And this is the first of many courses.

262
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,180
I thought you might say that.

263
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,930
But since we're short on time...

264
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,350
Come on, girls.

265
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,100
See you at sundown.

266
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,320
Close the door!

267
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,500
Did you have to bury her
in a place like this?

268
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,580
She should be on a hill somewhere

269
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,050
with the sun and the clouds above her.

270
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,210
She was my sister.

271
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,010
This is where she belongs.

272
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,510
She belonged with me.

273
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,190
In my dreams,
I kill him every night.

274
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:11,030
It's done, Your Grace.
The Targaryens are gone.

275
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,160
Not all of them.

276
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,040
Daenerys!

277
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,920
Daenerys.

278
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:36,050
There's our bride-to-be.

279
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,640
Look, a gift from Illyrio.

280
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,810
Touch it.

281
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,140
Go on, feel the fabric.

282
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,070
Mmm.

283
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,070
Isn't he a gracious host?

284
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:02,120
We've been his guests for over a year
and he's never asked us for anything.

285
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,120
Illyrio's no fool.

286
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,040
He knows I won't forget my friends

287
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,420
when I come into my throne.

288
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,510
You still slouch.

289
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,180
Let them see.

290
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:26,730
You have a woman's body now.

291
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,620
I need you to be perfect today.

292
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,540
Can you do that for me?

293
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,670
You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?

294
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,680
No.

295
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:09,390
When they write the history
of my reign, sweet sister,

296
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,480
they will say it began today.

297
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,880
It's too hot, my lady.

298
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,070
Where is he?

299
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,070
The Dothraki are not known
for their punctuality.

300
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,470
May I present my honored guests?

301
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:26,140
Viserys of House Targaryen,

302
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,760
the third of his name,

303
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:31,270
the rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men,

304
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,690
and his sister,

305
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:35,690
Daenerys of House Targaryen.

306
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,150
Do you see how long his hair is?

307
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,070
When Dothraki are defeated in combat

308
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,780
they cut off their braid
so the whole world can see their shame.

309
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:51,750
Khal Drogo has never been defeated.

310
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:57,080
He's a savage, of course,
but he's one of the finest killers alive.

311
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,590
And you will be his queen.

312
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,260
Come forward, my dear.

313
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,510
Where is he going?

314
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,340
- The ceremony is over.
- But he... But he didn't say anything.

315
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,590
Did he like her?

316
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,470
Trust me, Your Grace,
if he didn't like her, we'd know.

317
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,850
It won't be long now.

318
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:01,610
Soon you will cross the narrow sea
and take back your father's throne.

319
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,700
The people drink secret toasts
to your health.

320
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,280
They cry out for their true king.

321
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,700
When will they be married?

322
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:18,370
Soon.
The Dothraki never stay still for long.

323
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,750
Is it true they lie with their horses?

324
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,800
I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.

325
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,050
Do you take me for a fool?

326
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,880
I take you for a king.

327
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:31,140
Kings lack the caution
of common men.

328
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,970
My apologies if I've given offense.

329
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,680
I know how to play a man like Drogo.

330
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,600
I give him a queen
and he gives me an army.

331
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,560
I don't want to be his queen.

332
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,030
I want to go home.

333
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,030
So do I.

334
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,490
I want us both to go home,

335
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,830
but they took it from us.

336
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,750
So tell me, sweet sister,

337
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,540
how do we go home?

338
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,420
I don't know.

339
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,800
We go home with an army.

340
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,180
With Khal Drogo's army.

341
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,390
I would let his whole tribe fuck you,

342
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,600
all 40,000 men and their horses too,

343
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,390
if that's what it took.

344
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,200
Do you think Joffrey will like me?

345
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,540
What if he thinks I'm ugly?

346
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,090
Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.

347
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,090
He's so handsome.

348
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,970
When would we be married?
Soon? Or do we have to wait?

349
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:56,180
Hush now.
Your father hasn't even said yes.

350
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,970
Why would he say no?

351
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,020
He'd be the second most powerful man
in the kingdoms.

352
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,190
He'd have to leave home.

353
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,860
He'd have to leave me.

354
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,990
And so would you.

355
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:12,450
You left your home to come here.

356
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,320
And I'd be queen someday.

357
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,830
Please make Father say yes!

358
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,750
- Sansa...
- Please, please!

359
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,750
It's the only thing I ever wanted.

360
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,810
Fill that up!
Boys, Rodrik, come on.

361
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:40,970
Come on!

362
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,850
Come here, you little beauty!

363
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,950
Is he dead yet?

364
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,500
Uncle Benjen.

365
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,710
You got bigger.

366
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,680
Rode all day.

367
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,390
Didn't want to leave you alone
with the Lannisters.

368
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,850
Why aren't you at the feast?

369
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:21,720
Lady Stark thought it might
insult the royal family

370
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,770
to seat a bastard in their midst.

371
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,980
Well, you're always
welcome on the Wall.

372
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,060
No bastard was ever
refused a seat there.

373
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,900
So take me with you
when you go back.

374
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,900
- Jon...
- Father will let me if you ask him.

375
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,820
I know he will.

376
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,620
The Wall isn't going anywhere.

377
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,410
I'm ready to swear your oath.

378
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,670
You don't understand
what you'd be giving up.

379
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,710
We have no families.

380
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,550
- None of us will ever father sons.
- I don't care about that.

381
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,630
You might, if you knew what it meant.

382
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:01,470
I'd better get inside,

383
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,890
rescue your father from his guests.

384
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,980
We'll talk later.

385
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,740
Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.

386
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,040
What are you doing back there?

387
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,370
Preparing for a night with your family.

388
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,500
I've always wanted to see the Wall.

389
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,420
You're Tyrion Lannister,

390
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,090
the queen's brother?

391
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,890
My greatest accomplishment.

392
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:44,100
And you, you're Ned Stark's bastard,
aren't you?

393
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,730
Did I offend you? Sorry.

394
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,320
You are the bastard, though.

395
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,950
Lord Eddard Stark is my father.

396
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,820
And Lady Stark is not your mother,

397
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:04,950
making you... the bastard.

398
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,080
Let me give you some advice, bastard.

399
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,040
Never forget what you are.

400
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,500
The rest of the world will not.

401
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,210
Wear it like armor...

402
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:19,300
and it can never be used to hurt you.

403
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:23,640
What the hell do you know
about being a bastard?

404
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,560
All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes.

405
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,870
You at a feast...

406
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,500
it's like a bear in a trap.

407
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,090
The boy I beheaded...

408
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,340
- did you know him?
- Of course I did. Just a lad.

409
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,600
But he was tough, Ned,

410
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,970
a true ranger.

411
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,480
He was talking madness.

412
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,440
Said the walkers slaughtered his friends.

413
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,860
The two he was with are still missing.

414
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,990
Hmph. A wildling ambush.

415
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:23,070
Maybe.

416
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,910
Direwolves south of the Wall,

417
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,240
talk of the walkers,

418
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:31,910
and my brother might be
the next Hand of the King.

419
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:38,380
Winter is coming.

420
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:42,880
- Uncle Benjen.
- Robb boy.

421
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,470
- How are you?
- I'm good.

422
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:50,680
Is this your first time
in the North, Your Grace?

423
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:53,560
Yes. Lovely country.

424
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,690
I'm sure it's very grim
after King's Landing.

425
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:06,370
I remember how scared I was when
Ned brought me up here for the first time.

426
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,160
Hello, little dove.

427
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,330
But you are a beauty.

428
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,750
- How old are you?
- Thirteen, Your Grace.

429
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,460
You're tall. Still growing?

430
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,420
I think so, Your Grace.

431
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,670
And have you bled yet?

432
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,260
No, Your Grace.

433
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,390
Your dress, did you make it?

434
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:37,440
Such talent.
You must make something for me.

435
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,400
I hear we might share
a grandchild someday.

436
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,610
I hear the same.

437
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,950
Your daughter will do well in the capital.

438
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:50,410
Such a beauty shouldn't stay
hidden up here forever.

439
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:10,050
- Your pardon.
- I hear we might be neighbors soon.

440
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:13,640
- I hope it's true.
- Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.

441
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:16,980
I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate
your new title, if you accept.

442
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,190
It would be good
to have you on the field.

443
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,690
The competition has become a bit stale.

444
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,070
- I don't fight in tournaments.
- No?

445
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:25,740
Getting a little old for it?

446
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,740
I don't fight in tournaments

447
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,240
because when I fight a man for real,

448
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:34,120
I don't want him to know what I can do.

449
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:37,790
Well said.

450
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:40,500
Arya!

451
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,550
It's not funny!

452
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:47,300
She always does this.

453
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,840
This was my favorite dress
and she ruined it.

454
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:52,430
She always does it
and it's not funny!

455
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,390
Time for bed.

456
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,150
I'm a Northman.

457
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:13,370
I belong here with you, not down south
in that rats' nest they call a capital.

458
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:17,160
I won't let him take you.

459
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,290
The king takes what he wants.

460
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,710
That's why he's king.

461
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:28,420
I'll say, "Listen, fat man. "

462
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,840
"You are not taking
my husband anywhere.

463
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:34,890
"He belongs to me now. "

464
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,690
How did he get so fat?

465
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:45,110
He only stops eating
when it's time for a drink.

466
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,150
It's Maester Luwin, my lord.

467
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:52,530
Send him in.

468
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,160
Pardon, my lord, my lady.

469
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:59,790
A rider in the night...

470
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,080
from your sister.

471
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,430
- Stay.
- This was sent from the Eyrie.

472
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:20,680
What's she doing at the Eyrie?

473
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:23,350
She hasn't been back there
since her wedding.

474
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:33,700
What news?

475
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,780
She's fled the capital.

476
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,660
She says Jon Arryn was murdered.

477
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:44,670
By the Lannisters.

478
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:47,460
She says the king is in danger.

479
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:49,840
She's fresh widowed, Cat.

480
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,590
She doesn't know what she's saying.

481
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:57,010
Lysa's head would be on a spike right now
if the wrong people had found that letter.

482
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:59,310
Do you think she would risk her life,

483
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:01,020
her son's life,

484
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,520
if she wasn't certain
her husband was murdered?

485
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,610
If this news is true...

486
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:17,280
and the Lannisters conspire
against the throne,

487
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:19,830
who but you can protect the king?

488
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:22,200
They murdered the last Hand.

489
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:24,540
Now you want Ned to take the job?

490
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,540
The king rode for a month
to ask for Lord Stark's help.

491
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:31,170
He's the only one he trusts.

492
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:35,510
You swore the king an oath, my lord.

493
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,220
He's spent half his life
fighting Robert's wars.

494
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:41,350
He owes him nothing.

495
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:46,480
Your father and brother
rode south once

496
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,230
on a king's demand.

497
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:53,280
A different time.

498
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:56,740
A different king.

499
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:01,430
When do I meet with the khal?
We need to begin planning the invasion.

500
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:04,970
If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown,
you shall have it.

501
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:08,140
- When?
- When their omens favor war.

502
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:11,810
I piss on Dothraki omens.

503
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,610
I've waited 17 years to get my throne back.

504
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:19,510
A Dothraki wedding without at least
three deaths is considered a dull affair.

505
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:44,910
A small gift, for the new khaleesi.

506
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:48,450
Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.

507
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,540
Thank you, ser.

508
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:55,920
Are you from my country?

509
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,090
Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.

510
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:00,920
I served your father for many years.

511
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:04,010
Gods be good, I hope to
always serve the rightful king.

512
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,910
Dragon's eggs, Daenerys,

513
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,790
from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai.

514
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:35,830
The ages have turned them to stone,

515
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,920
but they will always be beautiful.

516
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:41,840
Thank you, Magister.

517
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:52,580
She's beautiful.

518
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:58,080
Ser Jorah, I...

519
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:00,960
I don't know how to say "thank you"
in Dothraki.

520
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:03,880
There is no word for "thank you"
in Dothraki.

521
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:27,030
Make him happy.

522
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,420
No.

523
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,590
Do you know the common tongue?

524
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,140
No.

525
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,610
Is "no" the only word that you know?

526
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:49,440
No.

527
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,850
Rough night, Imp?

528
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:21,930
If I get through this without squirting

529
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,940
from one end or the other,
it'll be a miracle.

530
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,850
I didn't pick you for a hunter.

531
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:30,070
The greatest in the land -
my spear never misses.

532
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,110
It's not hunting if you pay for it.

533
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,210
Are you as good with a spear
as you used to be?

534
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:46,790
No, but I'm still better than you.

535
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,420
I know what I'm putting you through.

536
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:53,210
Thank you for saying yes.

537
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,640
I only ask you because I need you.

538
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,390
You're a loyal friend. You hear me?

539
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:04,060
A loyal friend.

540
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,850
The last one I've got.

541
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,770
- I hope I'll serve you well.
- You will.

542
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:14,280
And I'll make sure you don't look
so fucking grim all the time.

543
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:17,860
Come on, boys,
let's go kill some boar!

544
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,580
Come on, you.

545
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:48,750
Stop! Stop.

546
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,880
Are you completely mad?

547
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,510
- He saw us.
- It's all right, it's all right.

548
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:00,680
- It's all right.
- He saw us!

549
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,930
I heard you the first time.

550
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,350
Quite the little climber, aren't you?

551
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,440
- How old are you, boy?
- Ten.

552
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,150
Ten.

553
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:26,330
The things I do for love.
