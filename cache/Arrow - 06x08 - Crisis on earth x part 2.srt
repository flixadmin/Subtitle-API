1
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:09,455
Oh, my God.

2
00:00:09,457 --> 00:00:10,723
Oh, my God
what?

3
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:12,191
Who is that?

4
00:00:14,896 --> 00:00:16,862
That's Tommy Merlyn.

5
00:00:16,864 --> 00:00:20,099
He died over
4 years ago.

6
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:22,868
Oliver, who's
Tommy Merlyn?

7
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:28,507
Thea's other brother...

8
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:33,679
and my best friend.

9
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:45,691
We're gonna need
a moment alone.

10
00:00:50,331 --> 00:00:52,665
- He's a crony.
- Anachronism.

11
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:54,333
That's what
I said.

12
00:00:54,335 --> 00:00:56,135
Lately we've been dealing
with anachronisms.

13
00:00:56,137 --> 00:00:58,504
It's people and things
displaced throughout time.

14
00:00:58,506 --> 00:01:00,273
Ok, but why would Nazis
from 1945

15
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:01,907
want to crash my wedding?

16
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:04,510
Crab legs. They
were delicious.

17
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,912
Well, Iris
has a point, though.

18
00:01:06,914 --> 00:01:08,714
If they're out of time,
they would've targeted

19
00:01:08,716 --> 00:01:10,216
the military
or law enforcement.

20
00:01:10,218 --> 00:01:11,717
Tommy was plucked
from 5 years ago

21
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,185
and put in the Prometheus
wardrobe.

22
00:01:13,187 --> 00:01:14,720
That doesn't make any sense.

23
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:16,422
It does if we're not dealing with
an anachronism.

24
00:01:16,424 --> 00:01:17,923
Visitors
from another earth?

25
00:01:17,925 --> 00:01:19,925
Whoa. There are more
than one?

26
00:01:19,927 --> 00:01:21,360
There are 52,
actually.

27
00:01:21,362 --> 00:01:23,162
Though
I'm hard pressed

28
00:01:23,164 --> 00:01:24,964
to think of one where
Nazis are ascendant.

29
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:27,366
I can.

30
00:01:27,368 --> 00:01:29,935
There's
a 53rd earth,

31
00:01:29,937 --> 00:01:32,371
and it's called
Earth-X.

32
00:01:42,383 --> 00:01:44,383
It doesn't have
a designation

33
00:01:44,385 --> 00:01:47,920
because it's a place
so awful, so horrific,

34
00:01:47,922 --> 00:01:50,156
no sane person would
ever travel there.

35
00:01:50,158 --> 00:01:51,724
It's basically

36
00:01:51,726 --> 00:01:54,960
our earth--same history,
same timeline--

37
00:01:54,962 --> 00:01:58,397
with one crucial
and critical difference.

38
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,899
So let me
hypothesize.

39
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:01,901
The Nazis developed
the atomic bomb

40
00:02:01,903 --> 00:02:03,402
before
the United States did,

41
00:02:03,404 --> 00:02:05,204
and they were more
than happy to use it.

42
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:07,740
Yes,
the Nazis won the war,

43
00:02:07,742 --> 00:02:10,376
and New York, London, Paris,
Moscow--all obliterated.

44
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:14,113
The SS set up outposts not
only all throughout Europe

45
00:02:14,115 --> 00:02:17,149
but also all throughout
the Americas,

46
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:19,418
and Hitler continued
his brutal reign

47
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,921
aided by prime ministers
and presidents

48
00:02:21,923 --> 00:02:23,589
sympathetic to him

49
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:26,292
until his death in 1994.

50
00:02:26,294 --> 00:02:30,329
Now they're not happy
ruling just one earth.

51
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:33,165
God. This is making me
physically ill.

52
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:35,267
Yeah, the line starts
behind me.

53
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:37,436
W--we have to find them.

54
00:02:37,438 --> 00:02:39,038
I mean, do you think
they're using the breach

55
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,639
to hop between worlds?

56
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:42,641
That or they're operating
from a staging area

57
00:02:42,643 --> 00:02:44,477
somewhere in Central City
or close by.

58
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,245
Well,
good thing we have

59
00:02:46,247 --> 00:02:49,115
a metric ton of smart people
in this building...and Rory.

60
00:02:49,117 --> 00:02:51,851
Let's get to work on finding
our new friends from Earth-X.

61
00:02:51,853 --> 00:02:53,185
Earth-X.

62
00:02:53,187 --> 00:02:54,653
That's right.

63
00:02:56,991 --> 00:02:59,525
And I'm dead
on this earth.

64
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:02,228
"This earth."

65
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,663
I'd almost prefer that.

66
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:08,033
I was born into the Reich.

67
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:10,269
The whole world
is the Fatherland.

68
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:12,071
We don't have
elementary schools

69
00:03:12,073 --> 00:03:13,839
and summer camps.

70
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:18,744
We have youth groups,
military training.

71
00:03:20,515 --> 00:03:22,515
We all grow up
without choice.

72
00:03:22,517 --> 00:03:24,216
You have a choice now.

73
00:03:24,218 --> 00:03:26,051
You can tell me
where to find

74
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:28,421
the others from Earth-X.

75
00:03:29,857 --> 00:03:32,858
On my Earth,
you are my best friend.

76
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:37,263
I would die for you.

77
00:03:37,265 --> 00:03:40,499
I would've died for you.

78
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:42,435
Would have?

79
00:03:42,437 --> 00:03:43,869
You beat me to it.

80
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:45,704
I lost you.

81
00:03:45,706 --> 00:03:47,306
It was like--

82
00:03:47,308 --> 00:03:48,908
it was like
losing a limb.

83
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,376
And...

84
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,680
You weren't just
my best friend.

85
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:56,649
Tommy, you were
my brother,

86
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:58,684
and you sacrificed
yourself

87
00:03:58,686 --> 00:04:00,820
for a woman that
we both loved.

88
00:04:00,822 --> 00:04:03,689
And I was there, and
I had you right here.

89
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:11,797
You were
a good man here.

90
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:16,402
And I believe that
you still can be.

91
00:04:16,404 --> 00:04:17,603
No. You don't understand.

92
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:19,905
If I--if I talk,
if I break,

93
00:04:19,907 --> 00:04:22,575
the Fuehrer will kill
my father.

94
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:24,910
He'll kill my mother,
everyone that I love.

95
00:04:24,912 --> 00:04:27,112
I will not let
that happen.

96
00:04:27,114 --> 00:04:29,882
I will stop him.

97
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:33,385
Do you think you
can do that?

98
00:04:33,387 --> 00:04:36,055
I promise you that
I can do that.

99
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:49,235
Then you really are
a special kind of idiot.

100
00:04:50,571 --> 00:04:53,939
Your naivete would be
charming

101
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:58,210
if your weakness
wasn't so pathetic.

102
00:04:58,212 --> 00:05:01,747
Is this how it is
on your planet--

103
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:04,583
everybody swayed
by sentiment?

104
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:08,954
Is everyone here
really so weak?

105
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,658
The Reich will change that.

106
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,994
The weak will be eliminated.

107
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:16,428
Your entire world
will be enslaved,

108
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,965
but you, you...

109
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:22,368
You won't be around
to witness it.

110
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:27,439
He is going to feel
your skull crack

111
00:05:27,441 --> 00:05:29,008
under the weight of his boot.

112
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:34,179
Everyone you care about,
everyone you love,

113
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:37,383
they're going to die badly...

114
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:45,558
In ways that would give
even monsters nightmares.

115
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:53,866
I really wish that I
could live to see it.

116
00:05:53,868 --> 00:05:54,900
No.

117
00:05:54,902 --> 00:05:56,969
T--Tommy, don't!

118

He's gone.

121
00:06:38,012 --> 00:06:39,612
Who?

122
00:06:39,614 --> 00:06:41,380
Merlyn?

123
00:06:42,817 --> 00:06:44,416
The biosensor in his suit

124
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:46,418
indicates his heart stopped.

125
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,454
He always seemed
kind of soft to me.

126
00:06:49,924 --> 00:06:51,724
Oliver.

127
00:06:51,726 --> 00:06:54,326
He died for you.

128
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:57,029
And we will make
his death worthwhile.

129
00:06:57,031 --> 00:06:58,731
That doesn't change
the fact

130
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:01,033
that now we're down
a man.

131
00:07:01,035 --> 00:07:03,035
Keep your focus
where it belongs

132
00:07:03,037 --> 00:07:05,904
and get to work on
locating that Prism.

133
00:07:05,906 --> 00:07:08,107
Watch your tone,

134
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:10,409
or I'll watch it for you.

135
00:07:16,117 --> 00:07:17,750
Oliver!

136
00:07:19,353 --> 00:07:22,488
Did you just tell me
to watch my tone?

137
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,592
You're angry...

138
00:07:28,062 --> 00:07:29,595
And I like it.

139
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:30,796
Don't you mock me.

140
00:07:30,798 --> 00:07:32,598
Don't threaten me,

141
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,133
or have you forgotten?

142
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:37,302
I can end your life

143
00:07:37,304 --> 00:07:40,305
before you birth your
next thought.

144
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:46,478
Try it once I break
every bone in your body.

145
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,583
Ok, we're all
a little emotional.

146
00:07:51,585 --> 00:07:53,452
Here's what I suggest.

147
00:07:53,454 --> 00:07:56,655
I will stop vibrating
my hand;

148
00:07:56,657 --> 00:07:59,925
you stop breaking my wrist;

149
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:04,697
and you be
10% less brooding.

150
00:08:12,773 --> 00:08:16,175
We accomplish nothing by
arguing amongst ourselves.

151
00:08:16,177 --> 00:08:18,577
It's the accomplishing nothing
that has me concerned.

152
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:20,979
We came here
to conquer this Earth,

153
00:08:20,981 --> 00:08:22,481
or have you forgotten?

154
00:08:22,483 --> 00:08:23,882
Locate the Prism...

155
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:26,719
Please.

156
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:28,687
Once we have identified

157
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:30,956
the location
of the target,

158
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,792
I will devise a plan
of attack.

159
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm sorry about Merlyn.

160
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:45,471
He should've died
in the Church

161
00:08:45,473 --> 00:08:47,539
before he allowed
himself to be captured.

162
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,341
Kara, we need
that Prism.

163
00:08:49,343 --> 00:08:51,143
We are running
out of time.

164
00:08:51,145 --> 00:08:54,546
You have to trust
in the plan, Oliver.

165
00:08:54,548 --> 00:08:57,049
You should. It's yours.

166
00:08:57,051 --> 00:08:59,885
And do you trust me?

167
00:09:02,022 --> 00:09:06,391
Yes, with all of my heart.

168
00:09:14,443 --> 00:09:16,838
You're kidding me.
Are you kidding me?

169
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:18,939
This feels like a really bad
wedding prank.

170
00:09:18,941 --> 00:09:20,707
No, I wish.

171
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:22,175
You want us to come, then?
I mean, Dig's on the mend,

172
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:23,810
but Dinah, Rene, and I can
be up there in a--

173
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:25,312
what's another word
for "Flash"?

174
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,813
No, I need you guys in
the bunker, expanding

175
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:28,348
our search for
the Earth-Xers.

176
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,250
I linked S.T.A.R. Labs'
system up with ours

177
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:32,152
so you can know what's
going on as we do.

178
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,420
Copy that.

179
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:35,355
I will get to work
on hacking

180
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:36,790
Palmer Tech's
spectrometers--heh--

181
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:39,559
to help the search
for Nazis.

182
00:09:39,561 --> 00:09:41,762
See you soon.

183
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:44,798
Hey, Caitlin
and Wells are trying

184
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,267
to track down
the Earth-Xers using

185
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:49,536
some sort of
dimensional something.

186
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:52,306
Vibrations. I told Curtis
to do the same thing

187
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:54,207
with quantum field analysis.

188
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:57,911
I'm sorry about Tommy.

189
00:09:57,913 --> 00:09:59,513
It wasn't Tommy.

190
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,481
He said that they are
trying to mount

191
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:03,016
some sort of invasion.

192
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:05,452
Guess the silver lining
to Black Siren is that we

193
00:10:05,454 --> 00:10:07,721
have experience
with doppelgangers.

194
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,759
So if it's not Tommy
I'm reading on your face,

195
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:14,261
what's up?

196
00:10:14,263 --> 00:10:16,530
You know what it is.

197
00:10:17,018 --> 00:10:18,951
Well, maybe we should wait

198
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:21,353
until we repel invaders
from another earth

199
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:23,122
to have this conversation.

200
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:24,957
Remember when we got
back from Ivy town?

201
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,225
Do you remember
Ivy town?

202
00:10:26,227 --> 00:10:27,993
Mm, so fondly.

203
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:31,964
When we got back, you
said that we could do this

204
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:34,300
and we could still
have our lives.

205
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:36,602
- Hmm.
- That was you.

206
00:10:36,604 --> 00:10:38,037
Yeah.

207
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:40,539
So, um...

208
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,409
This impending invasion
notwithstanding,

209
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:48,180
may we take 2 minutes
and talk about this?

210
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:50,716
Yeah.

211
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:58,591
Maybe what wasn't fair
was me saying

212
00:10:58,593 --> 00:11:00,292
I didn't want to marry you.

213
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:01,827
I mean not the way I did,

214
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,562
not with the most terrible
timing in the world.

215
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:04,864
Well, was it
how I said it?

216
00:11:04,866 --> 00:11:06,065
Because I know that
it was really--

217
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:08,200
I mean, it was
spontaneous.

218
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:12,605
No, it was so lovely.
It was so sweet.

219
00:11:12,607 --> 00:11:14,273
I love you.

220
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,010
I just don't want to be
married.

221
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:21,247
I don't...want
to be married to anyone.

222
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:22,715
You didn't feel that way
when we got engaged

223
00:11:22,717 --> 00:11:24,683
two years ago.

224
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,852
Right. And then 10 minutes later,
I got shot and paralyzed,

225
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:29,221
and Barry and Iris have a wedding,
and Nazis crash it.

226
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:30,756
You didn't know that
was gonna happen

227
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:32,391
when you said
you didn't want to marry me.

228
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:33,893
My point is...

229
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,229
We have something so good,

230
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:40,232
we have something
so great going.

231
00:11:41,836 --> 00:11:43,602
Let's not change that.

232
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:45,971
Let's just stand pat with
the cards that we're holding.

233
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:47,840
I want to move forward.

234
00:11:47,842 --> 00:11:50,242
Felicity, I love you...

235
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,346
And I want to marry you.

236
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:58,417
I love you. I love you.

237
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:03,088
I will always, always,
always love you.

238
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:08,193
Please respect me on this.

239
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:16,101
Ok.

240
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,971
Thank you.

241
00:12:25,446 --> 00:12:27,413
Felicity's got her
friend working on

242
00:12:27,415 --> 00:12:29,281
Palmer Technology's
spectrometry satellites.

243
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:30,683
Ok, but what about
the Waverider?

244
00:12:30,685 --> 00:12:32,284
I mean, a time-traveling
spaceship must have

245
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:34,286
some sort of tracking
technology that we can use.

246
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:35,955
Yeah, not exactly.

247
00:12:35,957 --> 00:12:37,690
It's, uh, it's
in the stone age.

248
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:38,991
Oh, like,

249
00:12:38,993 --> 00:12:40,693
literally in
the stone age.

250
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:43,495
Ok. Well, parallel earth
jumping is kind of

251
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:45,164
Cisco's specialty.

252
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,132
And since he's so busy
being unconscious right now,

253
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:49,201
I guess we're on our own.

254
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,736
Oh, perfect
timing, man.

255
00:12:50,738 --> 00:12:52,104
We're trying to find

256
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:53,539
the guys
from Earth-X,

257
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,307
and we're coming
up with nothing.

258
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:57,443
I'm sorry. W-would
you excuse us for a moment?

259
00:12:57,445 --> 00:13:02,481
Happily. We don't
want to step on whatever...

260
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:03,716
- Come on, Harry.
- Awkward, awkward thing...

261
00:13:03,718 --> 00:13:05,451
- It's not about you.
- That is.

262
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:07,886
Grey, we got Nazis
from a parallel earth running around.

263
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,521
We don't have
time for--

264
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,890
Which is precisely why
we cannot afford to be

265
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,492
at odds with each other
right now.

266
00:13:13,494 --> 00:13:15,327
I hardly need a psychic
connection to know

267
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:16,895
that you're upset
with me,

268
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:18,397
but I could stand
to know why.

269
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,299
Just forget about
it, man.

270
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:22,134
It would make some sense
if my decision to be

271
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:25,204
with my family forced you
to leave the Waverider,

272
00:13:25,206 --> 00:13:27,139
but I--I accounted
for that variable,

273
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:28,741
and yet you're--
you're still upset.

274
00:13:28,743 --> 00:13:31,210
- You just don't get it.
- No, I don't get it.

275
00:13:31,212 --> 00:13:35,147
My retirement requires
you to give up nothing.

276
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:38,083
It requires me
to give up you, Grey.

277
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:42,187
Look, I thought I made
my peace with it.

278
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:45,357
I thought, "Ok, fine. I'll stay
on the Waverider.

279
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:46,825
"Maybe I can't be
Firestorm,

280
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,527
but I can still be
a Legend."

281
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:50,763
But then it hit me.

282
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:53,032
I still can't be
Firestorm

283
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:55,467
and I can't be a Legend
with you.

284
00:13:57,004 --> 00:14:01,940
I never knew my father,
but I got to know you.

285
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,909
You're the closest thing
I've got to a dad,

286
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:07,880
and now you're leaving.

287
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:20,325
Hey.

288
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:21,660
Hey.

289
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:22,961
How are you?

290
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,129
Um, well, punching Nazis,

291
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:25,898
that was definitely
as satisfying

292
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,599
as I imagined it would be.

293
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:28,834
It's...

294
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:30,402
You ok?

295
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:33,238
Yeah. Oh, me? No. I'm--
I'm fi--I'm ok.

296
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,108
I'm completely ok.
I'm ok, ok?

297
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,843
- Ok.
- Ok.

298
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:42,815
This isn't gonna
be a thing, right?

299
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:45,984
Yeah. No, no, I'm--I'm ok.
I'm good.

300
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:49,421
Hey. I was
looking for you.

301
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:51,490
- Hey.
- Are you ok?

302
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:53,092
Why does everybody ask
me that question? Heh.

303
00:14:53,094 --> 00:14:55,661
Uh, well, you
sort of look like you

304
00:14:55,663 --> 00:14:58,030
just killed
someone's puppy.

305
00:14:58,032 --> 00:15:00,032
Uh, no.

306
00:15:00,034 --> 00:15:01,500
I'm--I'm fine.

307
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:04,570
It's just this whole
thing with Sara was--

308
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:06,438
God, it was
a mistake. Heh!

309
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,808
A mistake, but you came here
to have fun at a wedding,

310
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:13,245
and, um, ok,
Nazi invaders aside,

311
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:14,913
you--you had
a good time, right?

312
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:18,817
No. I mean, this--this
was all kinds of wrong.

313
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:22,955
Waking up with a strange
woman in a strange bed,

314
00:15:22,957 --> 00:15:26,258
I have never had a
one-night stand before.

315
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,527
And this whole thing
has just,

316
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:31,029
it's got me spinning,
Kara.

317
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:34,266
I mean, what--what if
I made a huge mistake?

318
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,567
- No, Alex--
- Ok, no, no, no.

319
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:36,869
I mean, look, I know

320
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:39,071
I want to have kids,

321
00:15:39,073 --> 00:15:42,975
but Maggie was real.

322
00:15:42,977 --> 00:15:45,644
I mean, what we had,
that was real.

323
00:15:45,646 --> 00:15:49,047
And now, um, with
everything, I just--

324
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:52,050
I chose to
let her go.

325
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:54,052
I chose that.

326
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:55,554
I mean, what was
I thinking?

327
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:57,656
Alex, Maggie was amazing,

328
00:15:57,658 --> 00:15:59,491
and you two were amazing
together,

329
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:01,860
but the best
part about her

330
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:05,464
was that she showed you
how to be true to yourself.

331
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:07,699
You want kids.
She doesn't.

332
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:12,271
You--you just had to do
what was right for you.

333
00:16:12,273 --> 00:16:15,440
What if I was wrong?

334
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:26,385
How long till you brainiacs
find these Nazis?

335
00:16:26,387 --> 00:16:27,653
Oh, my answer hasn't
changed in the 2 minutes

336
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:30,088
since you
last asked me.

337
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,590
Sorry.

338
00:16:31,592 --> 00:16:35,260
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

339
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:38,497
I'm dealing with
some Oliver stuff,

340
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:40,933
not "Nazis ruined
the happiest day of our life" stuff

341
00:16:40,935 --> 00:16:43,602
but...

342
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:45,237
Stuff.

343
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:49,741
Stuff. Like you don't
want to marry him stuff?

344
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:51,643
You might have said it
a little loudly

345
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:53,111
at the rehearsal dinner.

346
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,047
- Ah.
- What happened?

347
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:56,682
I thought at the salon, you
said you guys were good.

348
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:59,718
We are good. And we're
great. We're just as--

349
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,587
we're just as good as we
were the last time we got engaged

350
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:03,155
and I got shot.

351
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:08,560
That was the beginning
of the end for us.

352
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:13,165
I don't want to
tempt fate again,

353
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,000
you know?

354
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:20,806
A break-in at
Dayton Optical Systems?

355
00:17:20,808 --> 00:17:22,307
Ohh! I know
this sounds terrible,

356
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,243
but maybe we should let
the police handle it.

357
00:17:24,245 --> 00:17:26,545
I mean, we need our peeps
to focus on the Nazis.

358
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:28,413
- This is Nazis.
- How do you know?

359
00:17:30,985 --> 00:17:34,253
- I'll go get Barry.
- Yeah, ok.

360
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:59,978
Just a quick reminder,

361
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,981
super speed--
I don't have it.

362
00:18:02,983 --> 00:18:05,651
Noted.

363
00:18:05,653 --> 00:18:08,420
So what do we know
about this place?

364
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,188
Why are the Earth-Xers
targeting it?

365
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,057
Dark Arrow, distorted:
Because...

366
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:17,029
They had something
we need.

367
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,600
Whatever you stole...

368
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:22,901
We're gonna
want it back.

369
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:25,671
Your confidence is
predictable.

370
00:18:25,673 --> 00:18:28,440
You've faced some of
the greatest evils known to man,

371
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:30,042
and you've
defeated them,

372
00:18:30,044 --> 00:18:32,511
but if you think so
highly of yourselves

373
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:34,046
that you can defeat
any threat

374
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:36,014
that comes
your way...

375
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:47,192
How do you feel
about us?

376
00:18:53,543 --> 00:18:55,776
This is sick.

377
00:18:55,778 --> 00:18:57,078
Do you mean looking
at your reflection

378
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,048
and seeing only
weakness? I agree.

379
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,383
Thawne?

380
00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:04,618
Direct from Earth-1.

381
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,188
Do you like my face?

382
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,756
It's the face you were
wearing

383
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:10,224
when I became the Flash.

384
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:11,525
I thought I'd put it
on again.

385
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,151
You know, for
old time's sake.

386
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,353
Plus, handsome.

387
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:17,654
I watched you die.

388
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,789
Or did you?

389
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,791
It's time travel,
Barry.

390
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,326
So very confusing.

391
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,961
I always seem to be
saying that to you,

392
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,295
don't I?

393
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,431
Tommy killed himself.

394
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,299
I heard your Tommy
died years ago.

395
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,568
That's what
this earth does.

396
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,804
It makes people soft.

397
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:36,306
We've been watching you.

398
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,775
We've been watching
all of you

399
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,845
and how you've squandered
the potential of 2 worlds.

400
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,983
On our earth, we've developed
a meritocracy.

401
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:48,418
We've accomplished
greatness.

402
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,120
You're perverse.

403
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,823
No, Kara, you're
the perversion.

404
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:56,193
The most powerful being
on the planet

405
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,929
rendered weak by
saccharine Americana?

406
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,400
My pod was blessed to
crash in the Fatherland.

407
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:04,701
Then go back there.

408
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,205
This is not your earth.
Leave.

409
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,407
I don't
answer to the likes of you.

410
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,043
My allegiance is to
the Fatherland

411
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,911
and to my wife.

412
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:17,347
His wife?

413
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:20,717
Gross!
No offense.

414
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,388
Last chance. Go home.

415
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,589
And stay there

416
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,357
all of you.

417
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,631
And what
do you think that's going to do?

418
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,767
Bullets bounce off of me.

419
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:39,036
Oh, this arrow won't.

420
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,185
Is that a kryptonite
arrow?

421
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,287
Why do you have
a kryptonite arrow?

422
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,923
In case an evil you
ever showed up.

423
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,403
Get the Prism
out of here!

424
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,671
Are you all right?

425
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:15,839
I'm pissed.

426
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,276
Well, take it out
on that.

427
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,658
Hey.

428
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,461
It's gonna fall.

429
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,496
All right.
Get me over there.

430
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,678
Get the workers to safety!

431
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,127
We need to stabilize
the building.

432
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:38,522
The site's cleared.

433
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,824
- And stabilized.
- Nice work.

434
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,592
Let's not
celebrate just yet.

435
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,161
We gave those doppelgangers
the window they needed to escape.

436
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:45,695
Escape with what?

437
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,264
Dayton Optical Systems
calls it the Prism.

438
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:49,966
What on earth do they need
a sub-light generator for?

439
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,501
It's basically
a spectral emitter that...

440
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,170
Uses quantum entanglement.

441
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:54,471
You could also
use it to create

442
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,072
a stable
fusion reaction.

443
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:58,542
Ok, which
all means what?

444
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:02,345
No. Guys, really,
I would like to know

445
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:04,214
what you're
talking about.

446
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,550
You got this.

447
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,186
Well, basically, the device
they stole can be converted

448
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:10,187
to a neutron bomb.

449
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:11,721
Pfooo.

450
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,190
I take it back.

451
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:15,192
The bottom line is
that we have to catch

452
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:17,060
these parallel-earth
goose-steppers.

453
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,062
This might help.

454
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,198
- Is that a kryptonite arrow?
- Yup.

455
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,566
I know I shouldn't
have to ask this question,

456
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,000
but I have to ask
this question.

457
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,769
Oliver didn't
shoot Kara, did he?

458
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,004
Sort of. The other
Archer and flying woman

459
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,674
are Oliver and Kara
of Earth-X.

460
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:32,375
When you said that
Earth-X was horrible,

461
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:33,910
you might have
undersold it.

462
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,246
Wait a minute. How--how
could there be another Kara?

463
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,081
Well, there are 53 karas,

464
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,649
just like there's
53 Kryptons

465
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,117
and 53 Earths.

466
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,452
And the Thawne
from our earth

467
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:43,753
is working
with them.

468
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,755
He's an idiot.

469
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,591
Ok, if that arrow has
not-so-Supergirl's blood on it, we c--

470
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,326
We could track it using
quantum analysis.

471
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:51,061
We could.

472
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:53,430
Hey, guys, I think
I might have a quicker way.

473
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,101
These red blood cells
are suffused

474
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,736
with shortwave
radiation.

475
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,738
- Solar radiation?
- Yeah, incredibly high amounts.

476
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,306
Like nothing
I've ever seen.

477
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,641
Can you track it?

478
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,176
Well, I once caught
a deranged serial killer

479
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,078
off his face cream, so...

480
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,145
No joke. Heh!

481
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:10,747
Let's just do it
and fast.

482
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,148
Ok.

483
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,421
Will it work?

484
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:22,826
It will with
a few adjustments

485
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:25,061
and a significant
power source.

486
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:26,630
My husband's on his
way to handle that

487
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:27,897
as we speak.

488
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:31,334
Your husband
has a choice to make.

489
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:32,869
Me or the Reich?

490
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,437
That's right.

491
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:37,107
Because we have 2 goals,

492
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:41,311
and my worry is if we can't
accomplish them both,

493
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,413
he's gonna choose you

494
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:46,082
over a second earth
flying under our banner.

495
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:48,718
Oliver will not
abandon our mission.

496
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,287
I've seen this before.

497
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:55,292
In 1945, Hitler and his men
were equally shortsighted.

498
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:57,494
Hitler was driven
by passion

499
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,129
and childish need.

500
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:01,598
Oliver is 10 times
the man Hitler ever was.

501
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,068
Not when he's blinded
by his love for you.

502
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:09,939
If it comes to Oliver

503
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,875
choosing between me
and the Reich,

504
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:15,045
I'll make sure he
chooses the Fatherland.

505
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,046
How?

506
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:18,381
If it comes to it...

507
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:21,017
By taking the choice
out of his hands.

508
00:25:23,663 --> 00:25:25,775
Maybe tracking her off
of face cream would've been easier.

509
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:29,360
Supergirl-X's blood
is filled with solar radiation--

510
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,062
more than it should be--
but if I could try to get that to act

511
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,563
as a kind of beacon.

512
00:25:34,565 --> 00:25:36,098
Hey, ahem.

513
00:25:38,235 --> 00:25:39,735
How do you do it?

514
00:25:39,737 --> 00:25:41,403
Do what, Rory?

515
00:25:41,405 --> 00:25:43,639
Bring the other you
out of you.

516
00:25:43,641 --> 00:25:45,407
You don't want to know.

517
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:46,842
Sure I do.

518
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:51,313
It happens when I am
scared or angry.

519
00:25:52,405 --> 00:25:53,806
Oh.

520
00:25:53,807 --> 00:25:56,775
So if I were to, um, boo!

521
00:25:58,812 --> 00:25:59,911
Nice try.

522
00:26:01,949 --> 00:26:03,749
Boom. Whatever's going
on with Kara-X's blood,

523
00:26:03,751 --> 00:26:04,950
it's intensifying.

524
00:26:04,952 --> 00:26:06,451
Worse for her is
better for us.

525
00:26:06,453 --> 00:26:07,719
Better for us for
tracking her at least.

526
00:26:07,721 --> 00:26:09,755
We should have her
location any minute.

527
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,132
I can't believe
he's back.

528
00:26:20,134 --> 00:26:23,101
I don't know if I'll
ever be rid of him.

529
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:26,104
I know. And I know
how much you're hurting.

530
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:28,106
I just keep looking
for closure,

531
00:26:28,108 --> 00:26:30,342
but every time I see
him, all I see is--

532
00:26:30,344 --> 00:26:32,310
your mother dying.

533
00:26:37,151 --> 00:26:39,785
You're gonna stop him.

534
00:26:39,787 --> 00:26:41,086
How do you know?

535
00:26:41,088 --> 00:26:42,788
Because you always do.

536
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:46,825
And because we're not
gonna let you do it alone.

537
00:26:46,827 --> 00:26:49,594
We're getting close
on a location.

538
00:26:49,596 --> 00:26:51,129
Look, guys, I'm sorry.

539
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:53,331
This is not how this week
was supposed to go.

540
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:55,133
We can't think about
that right now.

541
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:56,468
You should.

542
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:59,337
We fight to protect
the people that we love,

543
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:01,706
so you guys recognize
what you have.

544
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:04,176
Recognize it and cherish it

545
00:27:04,178 --> 00:27:06,178
and let it make you stronger,

546
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,914
because if you do that,

547
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:11,116
you will always find your
way back to one another.

548
00:27:12,953 --> 00:27:15,120
It's the same for you
and Felicity, man.

549
00:27:15,122 --> 00:27:17,422
I don't know, Barry.
I d--I--

550
00:27:17,424 --> 00:27:20,592
she told me she doesn't
believe in marriage.

551
00:27:20,594 --> 00:27:22,360
I'm not feeling sorry
for myself.

552
00:27:22,362 --> 00:27:26,097
I just--I think that if
she loved me

553
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:28,166
the way I loved her, she
would want to marry me.

554
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:29,768
Oliver, I've known
Felicity for 5 years,

555
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,369
and I'm
here to tell you,

556
00:27:31,371 --> 00:27:33,672
as sure as I'm standing
here, she loves you.

557
00:27:33,674 --> 00:27:35,507
Felicity...

558
00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:37,509
- And I appreciate that.
- Is standing behind you.

559
00:27:37,511 --> 00:27:38,510
She's right there.

560
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,646
We got 'em.

561
00:27:41,648 --> 00:27:43,481
They're at a shipping
depot outside Danville.

562
00:27:43,483 --> 00:27:45,217
All right. We'll
get the band back together.

563
00:27:45,219 --> 00:27:47,152
Yeah.

564
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:50,622
- Oliver, I--
- It's ok.

565
00:27:50,624 --> 00:27:52,657
We can talk when
I'm--when I'm back.

566
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:54,125
But right now,
I need--

567
00:27:54,127 --> 00:27:55,727
I need to have
my head in the game.

568
00:27:55,729 --> 00:27:58,230
Get your head in the game.

569
00:28:55,689 --> 00:28:58,256
Supergirl and Firestorm
are sweeping the perimeter.

570
00:28:58,258 --> 00:29:00,458
It's done. It's
wall-to-wall Nazis in there.

571
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,061
Alex and I will take
up breach positions

572
00:29:03,063 --> 00:29:04,896
on the northwest
corner,

573
00:29:04,898 --> 00:29:06,631
if that's ok
with you.

574
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:07,899
S.T.A.R. Labs thinks
they converted

575
00:29:07,901 --> 00:29:08,900
the sub-light
generator--

576
00:29:08,902 --> 00:29:09,935
the Prism that
they stole--

577
00:29:09,937 --> 00:29:11,770
into some kind of
superweapon.

578
00:29:11,772 --> 00:29:14,072
Speaking of super, theirs
is our biggest threat.

579
00:29:14,074 --> 00:29:16,274
Agreed.
Let's take her out first.

580
00:29:21,548 --> 00:29:22,781
Hey.

581
00:29:22,783 --> 00:29:25,116
Hey.

582
00:29:25,118 --> 00:29:26,184
You ok?

583
00:29:26,186 --> 00:29:28,720
Yeah.

584
00:29:28,722 --> 00:29:31,523
No. You know?

585
00:29:31,525 --> 00:29:33,124
Yeah.

586
00:29:34,761 --> 00:29:37,162
It's gonna be ok.

587
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:42,233
Mustard.

588
00:29:42,235 --> 00:29:46,671
You people have breaches
but no mustard.

589
00:29:46,673 --> 00:29:48,173
Um, what are you
even doing here?

590
00:29:48,175 --> 00:29:49,541
Yeah, why didn't
you go with them?

591
00:29:49,543 --> 00:29:51,810
Go where?

592
00:30:05,826 --> 00:30:07,625
Couldn't have left one
for me?

593
00:30:07,627 --> 00:30:09,627
I'm saving Nazi you
for you.

594
00:30:09,629 --> 00:30:11,129
There's no sign
of the Prism.

595
00:30:11,131 --> 00:30:12,998
Well, it's got to be
here somewhere.

596
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,532
We got incoming.

597
00:30:36,423 --> 00:30:38,323
I see...

598
00:30:38,325 --> 00:30:40,058
Their Flash,
their Supergirl.

599
00:30:41,595 --> 00:30:43,228
Hyah!

600
00:30:49,202 --> 00:30:51,169
Yeah, I see them.

601
00:30:51,171 --> 00:30:54,205
Where's their Arrow?

602
00:31:13,209 --> 00:31:14,708
It was in the fridge.

603
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,377
Did you check
the fridge?

604
00:31:16,379 --> 00:31:18,512
Oh. Thank you, sweetheart.

605
00:31:18,514 --> 00:31:19,980
Any word from the team?

606
00:31:19,982 --> 00:31:21,548
They're over at
the shipping depot,

607
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,317
but it's just radio silence.

608
00:31:30,426 --> 00:31:32,993
Oh, God.

609
00:31:32,995 --> 00:31:35,029
There is no God.

610
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:28,248
You and you, hide.

611
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,616
What about Caitlin?

612
00:32:29,618 --> 00:32:32,252
It's gonna get a lot
colder in here.

613
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:37,985
Burn.

614
00:34:01,343 --> 00:34:03,477
Afraid of a little heat?

615
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,513
No.

616
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:11,151
I'm afraid of nothing.

617
00:34:12,388 --> 00:34:16,156
Bet you're pretty angry
and scared right now.

618
00:34:16,158 --> 00:34:19,193
I told you, I don't
fear anything.

619
00:34:19,195 --> 00:34:20,994
Actually...

620
00:34:22,264 --> 00:34:24,865
He was talking about me.

621
00:34:24,867 --> 00:34:26,366
Didn't think
this through, did you?

622
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:28,702
Just you against us.

623
00:34:32,842 --> 00:34:35,075
I don't need to think
to kill you.

624
00:34:37,346 --> 00:34:40,113
Anyone else want to be
a hero?

625
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,587
They wanted to wait,

626
00:34:46,589 --> 00:34:48,055
but I didn't think
we'd ever get

627
00:34:48,057 --> 00:34:50,524
a better entry line
than that.

628
00:34:56,899 --> 00:34:58,632
Uh! Thanks.

629
00:35:51,086 --> 00:35:53,453
What the hell is that?

630
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:58,325
Metallo.

631
00:36:28,624 --> 00:36:31,058
Hate to do this
to that handsome face, but...

632
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,505
Is everyone all right?

633
00:36:42,506 --> 00:36:43,906
We're gonna have
to work on

634
00:36:43,908 --> 00:36:45,707
your definition of "all right,"
Oliver.

635
00:36:45,709 --> 00:36:47,943
Yo, Grey,
you good?

636
00:36:47,945 --> 00:36:50,979
It seems my retirement
was somewhat tardy.

637
00:36:57,554 --> 00:37:01,556
Well, here we are.

638
00:37:01,558 --> 00:37:04,259
This is fun...for me,

639
00:37:04,261 --> 00:37:08,096
not so much for you.

640
00:37:08,098 --> 00:37:10,562
All the times you've
killed me,

641
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:16,972
and now here all I have
to do is kill you once.

642
00:37:16,974 --> 00:37:21,109
Enough, Eobard. Enough.

643
00:37:21,111 --> 00:37:22,678
Hey, you might want
to listen to her.

644
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,912
We know that if you

645
00:37:23,914 --> 00:37:25,480
wanted to kill us,

646
00:37:25,482 --> 00:37:27,916
you wouldn't have put these
dog collars on us first.

647
00:37:27,918 --> 00:37:29,818
Now I know what it feels
like to hate myself.

648
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,154
Well done.

649
00:37:32,156 --> 00:37:34,523
It wasn't a problem.

650
00:37:34,525 --> 00:37:37,659
Hey. Uh!

651
00:37:39,296 --> 00:37:41,830
The pain, the pain.

652
00:37:41,832 --> 00:37:44,132
I don't know how much
longer I can bear it.

653
00:37:44,134 --> 00:37:46,335
It's all right.
It's all right.

654
00:37:46,337 --> 00:37:49,104
You're gonna be all right
because we found her.

655
00:37:49,106 --> 00:37:52,841
We found her,
and now we have her.

656
00:37:55,846 --> 00:37:57,479
I love you.

657
00:37:57,481 --> 00:38:01,316
Now, very soon, this
nightmare will be over,

658
00:38:01,318 --> 00:38:03,952
and I'll take you home.

659
00:38:03,954 --> 00:38:06,788
So stand.

660
00:38:12,129 --> 00:38:15,263
S.T.A.R. Labs is secure.

661
00:38:15,265 --> 00:38:16,531
If you
hurt my friends...

662
00:38:16,533 --> 00:38:17,833
I did hurt your friends.

663
00:38:19,303 --> 00:38:21,803
I really enjoyed hurting
your friends.

664
00:38:21,805 --> 00:38:23,372
Are they alive?

665
00:38:23,374 --> 00:38:27,442
Yes, yes, for now.

666
00:38:27,444 --> 00:38:29,478
We need your Kara's
cooperation.

667
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,381
Well, we don't need it.
It would be preferable.

668
00:38:32,383 --> 00:38:33,982
But for the time being,

669
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,617
you are more valuable
as leverage.

670
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:37,686
What do you want
my sister for?

671
00:38:37,688 --> 00:38:39,821
To save my life.

672
00:38:39,823 --> 00:38:42,724
That's your little
mission statement, isn't it?

673
00:38:42,726 --> 00:38:46,428
Help people, save lives.

674
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:49,531
Well, now's your chance.

675
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:53,068
The General is dying.

676
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,736
Her blood.

677
00:38:54,738 --> 00:38:57,205
She's been exposed to
too much solar radiation.

678
00:38:57,207 --> 00:38:59,641
Yes, like Icarus,

679
00:38:59,643 --> 00:39:01,877
I flew
too close to the sun.

680
00:39:01,879 --> 00:39:04,246
But we can save her.

681
00:39:04,248 --> 00:39:05,881
We're going to save her.

682
00:39:05,883 --> 00:39:07,482
All we need is a new heart.

683
00:39:07,484 --> 00:39:10,585
And, luckily,
on this planet, we found

684
00:39:10,587 --> 00:39:12,387
the perfect donor.

685
00:39:14,091 --> 00:39:16,858
You stay the hell
away from my sister.

686
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:20,195
Mmm. Such loyalty.

687
00:39:21,231 --> 00:39:22,864
My sister tried to
kill me.

688
00:39:22,866 --> 00:39:25,400
That's why
you stole the Prism?

689
00:39:25,402 --> 00:39:26,768
So you could duplicate
a red sun, weaken Kara,

690
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,236
and cut into her?

691
00:39:28,238 --> 00:39:30,806
Can't make an omelet
with invulnerable eggs.

692
00:39:30,808 --> 00:39:33,308
Hey.

693
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,444
I'm gonna kill you.

694
00:39:36,713 --> 00:39:38,480
Nah, you won't.

695
00:39:38,482 --> 00:39:40,949
You're weak.

696
00:39:40,951 --> 00:39:44,719
And all of you choose
the high road.

697
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:47,089
You're heroes.

698
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:06,274
I thought we were
gonna die.

699
00:40:06,276 --> 00:40:08,743
If I had a dime for every
time I thought that, I--

700
00:40:08,745 --> 00:40:10,378
I'd have $2.40.

701
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,447
I really thought I'd
have more than that.

702
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:14,416
It was Oliver,
but it wasn't Oliver.

703
00:40:14,418 --> 00:40:15,984
It was Oliver
in the high castle.

704
00:40:15,986 --> 00:40:17,953
I just mean there is
so much out there

705
00:40:17,955 --> 00:40:19,488
for us to be
afraid of--

706
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:21,089
Multiple earths,
aliens,

707
00:40:21,091 --> 00:40:22,557
doppelgangers from
the third Reich.

708
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:24,726
I mean, what else
is coming?

709
00:40:24,728 --> 00:40:26,294
And that thought
wakes me up at night.

710
00:40:26,296 --> 00:40:27,829
How do you ever
get back to sleep?

711
00:40:27,831 --> 00:40:29,998
Barry's by my side.

712
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,333
- Shut up.
- I'm sorry.

713
00:40:31,335 --> 00:40:32,634
- I know you and Oliver--
- No, no.

714
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:35,003
Shut up.

715
00:40:40,144 --> 00:40:41,710
We're not alone.

716
00:41:00,364 --> 00:41:02,797
Stalag S.T.A.R. Labs.

717
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:05,167
What are we gonna do?

718
00:41:12,176 --> 00:41:14,809
Kara.

719
00:41:14,811 --> 00:41:17,145
Where's Kara?
They're gonna kill her.

720
00:41:17,147 --> 00:41:19,347
It's ok. We're
gonna get her back.

721
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:21,183
We need to figure
out where we are first.

722
00:41:21,185 --> 00:41:23,785
Yeah, about that.

723
00:41:23,787 --> 00:41:27,556
This is somewhat
disconcerting.

724
00:41:30,227 --> 00:41:32,194
I don't think
this is our earth.

725
00:41:35,832 --> 00:41:38,533
We're on Earth-X.
