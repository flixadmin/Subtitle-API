FELICITY: VICTIMS 3
AND 4 WERE NOT RANDOM.

THOSE NAMES ARE
ON THE LIST.

00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,676
WHAT THE HELL
IS THE LIST?

GET THIS STRAIGHT.

YOU GOT A TO KILL LIST,

478
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,522
AND I'M
THE OUT-OF-CONTROL ONE?

479
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:14,732
OLIVER: I HAVEN'T USED
THAT LIST,

480
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,734
I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT
IN 4 YEARS.

481
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,318
CURTIS: WAIT. 4 YEARS?
I THOUGHT THERE WAS

482
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,653
SOME OTHER GUY
IN THE HOOD.

483
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,906
NO. THAT WAS OLIVER.

GREEN ARROW...
ALL HIM.

OLIVER: THAT NOTEBOOK
BELONGED TO MY FATHER,

486
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,453
AND WHEN I WAS FIRST
STARTING OUT,

487
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,956
I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS
MY WAY TO SAVE THE CITY.

WE NOW KNOW THE MESSAGE

PRETTY ACCURATE.

I WAS TRYING TO HELP
THIS CITY.

494
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,138
PROMETHEUS ISN'T.

EVELYN: YOU
CONVINCED ME

496

TO NOT GET REVENGE
ON RUVÉ DARHK
FOR MY PARENTS

497
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,393
BECAUSE KILLING
WOULD TARNISH

498
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:55,106
THE BLACK CANARY'S
LEGACY.

SECOND, YOU KNEW
THAT I WAS A KILLER
WHEN YOU CAME ON BOARD.

A CITY COUNCILMAN.

506
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,039
YOU NEED TO ANAGRAM
THE NAMES ON THE LIST
AGAINST STAR CITY'S POPULATION

507
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:15,334
BECAUSE THAT SHOULD POINT
US TOWARD PROMETHEUS'
NEXT TARGETS.

TAKING A LITTLE TIMEOUT.

618
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,264
I EXPECTED THEM
TO BE UPSET WITH ME,
AND THAT'S FINE,

619
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,849
BUT, JOHN, THEY
SEEMED HORRIFIED.

NO. I WOULDN'T
CALL IT THAT.

621
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:25,603
JUST A BIT SURPRISED.

623
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,147
IT DOES SHOW HOW FAR
YOU'VE COME.

624
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,608
I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT GUY
IN A LONG TIME,

625
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:33,651
AND THE WAY
THE KIDS REACTED,

626
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:34,945
I THINK IT PROVES
HOW MUCH YOU'VE CHANGED.

627
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,572
EXCEPT I HAVEN'T.

628
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:40,326
I KILLED DAMIEN DARHK,
AND I HAVEN'T STOPPED SINCE.

YEAH. WELL, DON'T
FORGET WHO YOU'RE
TALKING TO, MAN.

I KNOW FIRSTHAND
WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE A MURDERER.

631
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:54,840
I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A GOOD KILL

632
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:59,345
AND ONE MADE OUT
OF PURE RAGE.

633
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,096
YOU KILLED
DAMIEN DARHK,

634
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,098
OLIVER, BECAUSE YOU HAD TO.

635

BECAUSE YOU HAD TO.

637
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,269
THE LIST WAS
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

638
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:10,314
YOU WERE TARGETING
LAWYERS, STOCKBROKERS.

639
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,566
YOU WERE KILLING
AS A FIRST RESORT,
NOT A LAST.

640
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:16,987
WELL, PROMETHEUS IS JUST
DREDGING ALL THAT UP AGAIN.

641
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:22,493
I WANT TO MOVE FORWARD.
I'M TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD,

I FEEL STUCK.

644
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,584
I THINK YOU'RE BEING
HARD ON YOURSELF,

645
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:31,960
WHICH IS A BIT ANNOYING
BECAUSE THAT'S USUALLY

MINE AND FELICITY'S JOB,

I THINK YOU'RE EVOLVING.

YOU'RE GROWING.

WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?

652
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:46,975
BECAUSE THAT GUY
WITH THE LIST WOULDN'T

653
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:49,769
HAVE EVEN THOUGHT TO
ASK THE QUESTION.

654

A CLEANUP ON AISLE 12,

OF POTENTIAL VICTIMS.

UPSET WITH ME,

SHOWING UP DESPITE THAT.

IN ORDER TO COVER
THAT MUCH GROUND,

A STORY

00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,696
ABOUT HER
GRANDFATHER.

761
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:35,156
SHE SAID HE GREW
A TURNIP SO LARGE

762
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:38,451
THAT HE COULD NOT PULL
IT UP BY HIMSELF,

763
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,037
SO HE ASKED HIS WIFE
TO HELP,

764
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,831
BUT TOGETHER,
THEY COULD NOT DO IT.

765
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:47,335
SO HE ASKED MY UNCLE,
MY AUNT, EVERYBODY
TO PITCH IN,

766
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:50,756
BUT YET THEY COULD NOT
PULL THE TURNIP OUT
OF THE GROUND.

767
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,468
AND SO I SAID,

768
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,388
"MAMA, MAMA,

769
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,934
DID HE EVER PULL
THE TURNIP OUT OF THE GROUND?"

770
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:04,770
