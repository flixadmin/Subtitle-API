Man:

00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,963
<i>do you think we could</i>

6
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,131
Locke:
<i>Depends if he's had</i>
<i>any practice.</i>

7
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,718
Is that the sort of thing
you and your sister go
in for, Kingslayer?

8
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,681
- She loosened you up for us?
-<i> ( men laughing )</i>

9
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,897
He's going to fall.

10
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,483
He's going to
fall off his horse.
Someone help him.

11
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,196
( grunts )

12
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,744
Water.

13
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,705
Water.

14
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,332
Please, water.

15
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,918
Wa-water.

16
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,503
Water, please.

17
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,547
Please. Please.

18
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,215
( men laughing )

19
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,098
If I die,
you won't be getting--

20
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,600
Oh, enough.

21
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,518
Here.

22
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,903
Can't say that I've ever
seen a man drink horse piss
that fast.

23
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,113

- ( grunts )

26
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,140
Stop!

27
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,358
Far enough.

28
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,988
( groans )

29
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,790
- ( grunts )
- ( groans )

30
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:27,642
Do that again
and I'll take your other hand.

31
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,940
Come on, you.

32
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,202
Oh, Lord Tyrion.
Come in, come in.

33
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,246
I hope we might speak.

34
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,999
In confidence.

35
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,668
Oh, always in confidence.

36
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,753
About the events
of the Blackwater.

37
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:58,548
Perhaps this is
the wrong time?

38
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,341
Oh, no.
It's a wonderful time.

39
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,094
I thought one
of your little birds

40
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,972
might have knowledge of
my sister's intentions to--

41
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,765
End your life?

42
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,351
I didn't inherit
Littlefinger's spies

43
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,103
along with his position,
I'm afraid.

44
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,147
Which is why
I'm coming to you.

45
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,482
- I need proof.
- Proof? ( snickers )

46
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,568
- Will there be a trial?
- I need to know.

47
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,905
I have no proof,
only whispers.

48
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,324
( grunts )

49
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,328
Before all this nastiness,

50
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,915
I was going to tell you
the story of how I was cut.

51
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,751
Do you want
to hear it still?

52
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,086
I don't know.
Do I?

53
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,922
As a boy, I travelled
with a troupe of actors

54
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,924
through the Free Cities.

55
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,551
One day in Myr,

56
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,471
a certain man
made my master an offer

57
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,639
too tempting to refuse.

58
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,100
I feared the man meant
to use me as I'd heard

59
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,311
some men used small boys.

60
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,938
But what he wanted
was far worse.

61
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,566
He gave me a potion

62
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,777
that made me powerless
to move or speak,

63
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,863
yet did nothing
to dull my senses.

64
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,407
With a hooked blade
he sliced me,

65
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,452
root and stem,
chanting all the while.

66
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,997
He burned my parts
in a brazier.

67
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,373
The flames turned blue

68
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:18,211
and I heard a voice
answer his call.

69
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,719
I still dream of that night.

70
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,097
Not of the sorcerer,

71
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,349
not of his blade.

72
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,060
I dream of the voice
from the flames.

73
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,062
Was it a god?
A demon?

74
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,022
A conjuror's trick?

75
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,024
I don't know.

76
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,653
But the sorcerer called
and a voice answered.

77
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,947
And ever since that day,

78
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,742
I have hated magic and
all those who practice it.

79
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,203
But you can see
why I was eager to aid

80
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:55,665
in your fight against
Stannis and his Red Priestess.

81
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:59,418
A symbolic revenge of sorts.

82
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:03,464
Yes, ahem.
I feel the need
for actual revenge

83
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,466
against the actual person

84
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,969
who tried
to have me killed.

85
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:11,389
Which will require a degree
of influence, which--

86
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,850
You do not possess

87
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,561
at the moment.

88
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,855
But influence is largely

89
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,024
a matter of patience,
I have found.

90
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,444
Once I had served
the sorcerer's purpose,

91
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,156
he threw me out
of his house to die.

92
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,908
I resolved to live

93
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,410
to spite him.

94
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,828
<i>I begged.</i>

95
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:37,081
I sold what parts
of my body remained to me.

96
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,375
I became
an excellent thief

97
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,879
and soon learned
that the contents
of a man's letters

98
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:47,049
<i>are more valuable</i>
<i>than the contents</i>
<i>of his purse.</i>

99
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,552
Step by step,

100
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,305
one distasteful task
after another,

101
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,725
I made my way
from the slums of Myr

102
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,978
to the small council chamber.

103
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,900
Influence grows like a weed.

104
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,653
I tended mine patiently

105
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,115
until its tendrils
reached from the Red Keep

106
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,452
all the way across
to the far side of the world

107
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:18,497
where I managed to wrap
them around something

108
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,708
very special.

109
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,257
- The sorcerer.
- ( muffled speaking )

110
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,677
Hello, my old friend.

111
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,931
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

112
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,267
I have no doubt
the revenge you want

113
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,769
will be yours in time...

114
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,813
if you have
the stomach for it.

115
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,775
( muffled shouting )

116
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,277
When people talk about
the Night's Watch,

117
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,738
they never mention
the shoveling.

118
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,949
Or the shit.

119
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,701
They tell you about honor,
pardoning crimes,

120
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,161
and protecting the realm,

121
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:01,457
but shoveling
really is most of it.

122
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,253
And getting attacked
or killed or worse.

123
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,838
And that.
But when you're not
getting attacked or killed,

124
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,131
usually you're shoveling.

125
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,968
- ( pigs snorting )
- Oh, look.

126
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,511
More shit.

127
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,639
I was starting
to wonder what to do

128
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,349
with the rest of my day.

129
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,726
We need to get
out of here.

130
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,146
When the Lord Commander
says we go, we go.

131
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,316
The Lord Commander
told us to go to the Fist
of the First Men.

132
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,069
- How'd that turn out for us?
- He had no way of knowing.

133
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,570
We do now.

134
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,322
We know what's out there.

135
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,450
Craster's been out here
surviving.

136
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,036
So he's your
new protector now?

137
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,579
Our good friend Craster?

138
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,248
We're like the sons
he never had.

139
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,834
Rast:
<i>Mormont isn't</i>
<i>gonna save you.</i>

140
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,212
This lummox here
isn't gonna save you.

141
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,714
When the walkers
come calling,

142
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,300
Craster will serve us up
like so many pigs.

143
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,761
If we want to live...

144
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,308
we'll have to look out
for ourselves.

145
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,561
Shh, shh, shh.

146
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,230
<i>( footsteps )</i>

147
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,566

( baby crying )

149
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,283
- You woke him.
- I'm sorry.

150
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:21,871
- He's beautiful.
- Shh!

151
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,040
<i>( baby crying )</i>

152
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,419
( quietly )
He's beautiful.

153
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,421
<i>Does he have a name?</i>

154
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:34,175
- No.
- Are you going
to give him one?

155
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,509
Why?

156
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,724
Here.

157
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,101
- Gilly.
- You said to hold it for you
until you came back.

158
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,770
- You're back.
- I wanted you to have it.

159
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,772
I don't want
your stupid thimble.

160
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,900
I want to save
my baby's life.
Can you do that?

161
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,027
Can you?

162
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,947
I don't have time
for you.

163
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,325
I don't have time
for anyone but him

164
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,661
because he doesn't
have much time.

165
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,539
( baby crying )

166
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,754

-<i> ( cawing continues )</i>
<i>- ( wings flutter )</i>

168
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,980
You have to go
after him.

169
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,066
How?

170
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,026
<i>You know how.</i>

171
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,708
( cawing )

172
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,258
( caws )

173
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,969
Brandon.

174
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,264
- Mother.
- How many times
have I told you?

175
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,808
- No climbing.
- Mother, I need to find it.
It's here.

176
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,601
- It's calling me.
- I want you to promise me.

177
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,562
No more climbing.
Promise me.

178
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,272
Promise me!
Promise me!

179
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,649
- Mother! Mother!
- Promise me!
Promise me, Bran!

180
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:14,984
<i>Promise me!</i>

181
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,528
( gasps )

182
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,040
Is he very large?

183
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,959
No larger than usual,
apparently.

184
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,004
- And yet they
said that he was--
- Extraordinary.

185
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,673
The most extraordinary man
they've ever had.

186
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,133
And they've had
a lot of men.

187
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,135
We're talking about
the same Podrick?

188
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,846
The quiet boy
in Lord Tyrion's service?

189
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,264
Seems a bit simple?

190
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,350
What did he do to them?

191
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,727
I don't know, my lord.

192
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,229
The girls are usually
quite descriptive.

193
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,106
So what did they say?

194
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,276
They said it was hard
to describe.

195
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,611
Huh.

196
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:03,699
Prodigies appear
in the oddest of places.

197
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:07,620
And what did Littlefinger say
about this loss of income?

198
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,914
He was too preoccupied
to notice.

199
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,124
He's leaving
for the Eyrie soon.

200
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,751
I'm helping him prepare
for his journey.

201
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,420
Ah, yes, to pursue
his enduring love

202
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,924
of the Lady Arryn
and the title that
comes with her.

203
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,051
Sad, really.

204
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,094
Is that all it takes

205
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,056
to make our friend lose
interest in poor Sansa Stark?

206
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,768
He hasn't spoken to her
since the last time,

207
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,520
as far as I know.

208
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,231
But I don't think
he's lost interest.

209
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,274
What makes you say so?

210
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,779
- His shipboard inventory.
- Ah.

211
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,241
You can read.

212
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,326
Rare for a woman
in your profession.

213
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,287
- Former profession.
- Of course.

214
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,958
I'm missing something obvious
you're about to point out?

215
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,751
<i>Two featherbeds.</i>

216
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,462
He's bringing
two featherbeds
for the cabin.

217
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,967
Who is important enough
to Littlefinger

218
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,511
to merit a featherbed
besides Littlefinger?

219
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,763
Could he be bringing
one of his girls?

220
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:10,432
He's not interested
in them, my lord.

221
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,101
How do you know?

222
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,270
Because I'm one
of his girls.

223
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,690
Prodigies in
odd places indeed.

224
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,444
Rhaenyra Targaryen
was murdered by her brother,

225
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,989
or rather his dragon.

226
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,616
It ate her
while her son watched.

227
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,368
( laughs )

228
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:32,538
What's left of her
is buried in the crypts
right down there.

229
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,752
Cersei:
<i>The ceremony is traditionally</i>
<i>held in the main sanctum,</i>

230
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,964
which seats
700 comfortably.

231
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,425
Olenna:
There appears to be a good
deal of room elsewhere

232
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,136
on the premises
for everyone else.

233
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,472
There aren't
more than 700 people
of any importance.

234
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,475
No, the rest are there
to look adoringly

235
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,728
upon the 700
to remind them

236
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,856
how superior they must be
to have the best seats.

237
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,482
Over there in that urn,

238
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,776
the ashes
of Aerion Targaryen.

239
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,945
Aerion Brightflame
they called him.

240
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,032
He thought drinking wildfire
would turn him into a dragon.

241
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,993
- ( laughs )
- He was wrong.

242
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,495
And, of course,
there's the Mad King,

243
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,289
killed by my uncle.

244
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,916
Would you like
to see where the last
Targaryens are buried?

245
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,128
Are you sure Lady Margaery
doesn't find all this
a bit macabre?

246
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,088
Oh, no, it's quite
all right, Your Grace.

247
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,841
I'd love to see
their tombs, really.

248
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:27,718
It's like taking a walk
through history.

249
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,139
<i>( door closes )</i>

250
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,308
- Joffrey:
The tomb's just up here.
- This is so exciting.

251
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,934
Olenna:
You were married here,
Your Grace?

252
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,271
- Yes.
- Must seem like
only yesterday.

253
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,856
Seems like a lifetime ago.

254
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:42,941
Your husband,
was he buried
here as well?

255
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,153
No, he wanted his remains
returned to Storm's End.

256
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:49,865
- Such a tragedy.
- A fairly predictable tragedy.

257
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:51,659
Hunting and drinking
don't mix.

258
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,035
I should say not.

259
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,371
My son's a hunter.
It helps him forget

260
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,040
he's never been within
a mile of a real battle.

261
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,043
I seem to recall
he laid siege to
Storm's End

262
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,920
for the better part
of a year.

263
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,755
All he laid siege to

264
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,590
was the banquet table
in the command tent.

265
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:10,260
I told him to stay out
of Robert's rebellion.

266
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,430
He had no business
fighting an actual warrior.

267
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,309
We mothers
do what we can

268
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,561
to keep our sons
from the grave.

269
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,230
But they do seem
to yearn for it.

270
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,274
We shower them
with good sense,

271
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,444
and it slides right off
like rain off a wing.

272
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,572
And yet the world
belongs to them.

273
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,742
( scoffs )
A ridiculous arrangement,
to my mind.

274
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,619
<i>( Margaery laughs )</i>

275
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,289
The gods have seen fit
to make it so.

276
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,419
My father didn't
want them here.

277
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,045
He was going to have
their bodies burned

278
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,839
and thrown
in the Blackwater,

279
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:50,092
but the High Septon
convinced him otherwise.

280
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,552
I'm glad he did.

281
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,431
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

282
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,099
I know they did
terrible things
at the end,

283
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:01,061
but their ancestors
built this.

284
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,940
Margaery:
Sometimes severity

285
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,692
is the price we pay
for greatness.

286
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,488
( chuckles )
I couldn't agree more.

287
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,744
<i>( crowd shouting )</i>

288
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,208
Shall we go and see them?

289
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,919
If you give them
your love,

290
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,131
they will return it
a thousandfold.

291
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,967
I've spoken with them.

292
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,969
I know how they feel
about you.

293
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:37,389
You led the defense
of King's Landing.

294
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:41,602
They adore you.

295
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,820
- Open the doors.
-<i> ( doors open )</i>

296
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,239
<i>( crowd cheering )</i>

297
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,163
Joffrey.

298
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,957
Wait.

299
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,960
- Man: Lady Margaery!
- Woman: Lady Margaery!

300
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,713
Bless you,

00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,257

<i>Gods bless King Joffrey!</i>

307
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,405
Theon:
How far is it
to Deepwood Motte?

308
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,824
Boy:
Not far, my lord.

309
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,867
Your sister is waiting
for you there.

310
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,619
- She sent you to save me?
- Yes.

311
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:44,581
I served them,
the men who were
torturing you.

312
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,125
I did what they
told me and waited
for the right moment.

313
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,545
Why would you risk
your life for me?

314
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,422
I grew up
on Saltcliffe,
my lord.

315
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,717
I was only a boy
when they took you away.

316
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,886
My father brought me
and my brothers up
to the bluffs

317
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,889
so we could watch the ship
that carried you off.

318
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,892
I remember the look
on my father's face
when he told us,

319
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,895
"That's Balon Greyjoy's
last living son."

320
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,607
And those are the words
I heard over and over again

321
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,818
when I saw what
they were doing to you.

322
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,820
Those men,

323
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,865
they said my father knew
what they were doing to me.

324
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,869
Did he?

325
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,788
I-- I don't know,
my lord.

326
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:28,333
They-- they never
told me much.

327
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,381
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

328
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,886
My sister's men
are loyal to her.

329
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,179
<i>We don't need</i>
<i>to hide from them.</i>

330
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,265
Not all those
are your sister's men.

331
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,851
Some of them are loyal
to your father.

332
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,273
- ( Theon chuckles )
- What is it?

333
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,858
Theon:
I was just thinking
how jealous I was

334
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,985
when my father told Yara
to take this place.

335
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,945
What did he tell
you to do?

336
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,239
Raid fishing villages.

337
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,074
He didn't trust me.

338
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,659
Thought I was a Stark.

339
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,662
Ha. I could never
be a Stark.

340
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,290
Robb Stark always
reminded me of that.

341
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,792
- He lorded it over you?
- Didn't have to.

342
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,921
All he had to do was be.

343
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:17,925
Be who he was born to be.

344
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,594
His life fit him
better than his clothes.

345
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:23,013
How could someone like that
ever be a brother to me?

346
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,307
<i>He's the King</i>
<i>in the North.</i>

347
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,642
<i>And me...</i>

348
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,353
my father gave me
a choice

349
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,355
and I made it.

350
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,608
I could never
be a Stark.

351
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:38,278
But ironborn,

352
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,614
that's what
I was born to be.

353
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,288
I paid the iron price
for Winterfell.

354
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:56,672
I murdered those boys.

355
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,593
The Stark boys?

356
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,930
Never found them.

357
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:08,725
Just some poor orphans
living with a farmer.

358
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,773
I let Dagmer
slit their throats

359
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,775
and I let him
burn the bodies...

360
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,530
so I could keep
Winterfell...

361
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,742
and make my father proud.

362
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,246
Maybe it's not too late.

363
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,710
It is.

364
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,878
( sniffles )

365
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,470
My real father lost his head
at King's Landing.

366
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,933
I made a choice...

367
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,396
and I chose wrong.

368
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,609
And now I've burned
everything down.

369
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,739
Not everything,
my lord.

370
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,451
She's up here.

371
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,758
- Yara.
-<i> Shh.</i>

372
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,134
Wait.

373
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,479
I brought him back.
He killed the others.

374
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,439
What?
No, I didn't.

375
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,274
You can't!

376
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,860
( gasps )
No, please stop!

377
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,324
No!
( sobbing )

378
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,326
Put him back
where he belongs.

379
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,038
( screams )

380
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,352
Eat.

381
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,816
What are you doing?

382
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,235
I'm dying.

383
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:26,279
You can't die.

384
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,615
You need to live

385
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:31,159
to take revenge.

386
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,620
I don't care
about revenge.

387
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,455
You coward.

388
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,626
A little misfortune
and you're giving up.

389
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,296
Misfor--

390
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,798
misfortune?

391
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,466
You lost your hand.

392
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,344
My sword hand.
I was that hand.

393
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,304
( scoffs )

394
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,849
You have a taste--

395
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,726
one taste
of the real world

396
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,604
where people have
important things
taken from them

397
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,440
and you whine
and cry and quit.

398
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,110
You sound like
a bloody woman.

399
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,138
I know what
you did for me.

400
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:37,475
You told them Tarth
was full of sapphires.

401
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,481
It's called
the Sapphire Isle

402
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,692
because of the blue
of its water.

403
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,822
You knew that.

404
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,998
Why did you help me?

405
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,383
<i>( pen scratching )</i>

406
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,974
( sighs )

407
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,564
( sighs )

408
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,943
You wanted to speak to me?

409
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,195
Yes, about Jaime.

410
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,989
What about him?

411
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,616
I wanted to make sure

412
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,743
we're doing everything
we can to get him back.

413
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:43,124
When Catelyn Stark
took Tyrion prisoner...

414
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,626
( blows )

415
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,628
what did I do
in response?

416
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,965
- You started a war.
- And if I would start a war

417
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,175
for that lecherous
little stump,

418
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,095
what do you think I am doing
for my oldest son and heir?

419
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:58,014
Whatever you can.

420
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,475
Whatever I can.

421
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,948
- You're still here.
- Yes.

422
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,659
<i>( pen scratching )</i>

423
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,161
Why?

424
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,746
Did it ever occur to you

425
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,665
that I might be the one
who deserves your confidence

426
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,084
and your trust,
not your sons?

427
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,920
Not Jaime or Tyrion,
but me.

428
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,339
Years and years
of lectures on family

429
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,425
and legacy--

430
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,801
the same lecture,
really,

431
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:38,179
just with tiny,
tedious variations--

432
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,056
did it ever occur to you
that your daughter

433
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,643
might be the only one
listening to them?
Living by them?

434
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:47,188
That she might have
the most to contribute
to your legacy

435
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,025
that you love so much more
than your actual children?

436
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,235
( blows )

437
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,993
All right.
Contribute.

438
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,789
The Tyrells are a problem.

439
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,878
The Tyrells helped us
defeat Stannis Baratheon.

440
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,672
The Tyrells saved your life,
your children's lives.

441
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,926
Margaery has her claws
in Joffrey.

442
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,597
She knows how
to manipulate him.

443
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,223
Good.

444
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,975
I wish you knew
how to manipulate him.

445
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,438
I don't distrust you
because you're a woman.

446
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,941
I distrust you
because you're not as smart
as you think you are.

447
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,819
You've allowed that boy
to ride roughshod over you

448
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,739
and everyone else
in this city.

449
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,205
Perhaps...

450
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:48,583
you should try stopping him
from doing what he likes.

451
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,631
I will.

452
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,592
Girl:
<i>Do you like it, Nana?</i>

453
00:27:57,675 --> 00:28:00,887
Another golden rose.
How original.

454
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,473
I eat from plates
stamped with roses.

455
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,767
I sleep in sheets
embroidered with roses.

456
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,436
I have a golden rose
painted on my chamber pot,

457
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,106
as if that makes it
smell any better.

458
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,607
Roses are boring, dear.

459
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,068
"Growing strong."

460
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:18,321
Ha! The dullest words
of any house.

461
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,240
"Winter is coming!"

462
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,534
Now that's memorable.

463
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:25,412
"We do not sow."
Strong. Strong.

464
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,372
Those are houses
you watch out for.

465
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:31,709
Direwolves and krakens,
fierce beasts.

466
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,670
But a golden rose
growing strong--

467
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:37,173
ha, that strikes fear
in the heart.

468
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,469
Look, little loves.

469
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,680
A spider in the garden.

470
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,391
Run along now.

471
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,184
Grow strong.

472
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,896
My lady.

473
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,150
I wanted to personally
welcome you to King's Landing.

474
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,694
The city has been made
brighter by your presence.

475
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,905
The city is made brighter
by my presence?

476
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,283
Is that your usual line,
Lord Varys?

477
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,868
Are you here
to seduce me?

478
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,578
A little obvious,
perhaps.

479
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,580
Oh, no, please.

480
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,833
Seduce away.
It's been so long.

481
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,377
Though I rather think
it's all for naught.

482
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,839
What happens when
the nonexistent bumps
against the decrepit?

483
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,176
A question for
the philosophers.

484
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,345
But you've come mincing
all this way for something.

485
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,556
- So?
- Might I sit?

486
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,391
No.

487
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,686
Come, I've heard
you're such a clever man.

488
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:34,272
I'm curious why
you've sought me out.

489
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,193
You've taken an interest
in Sansa Stark.

490
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,527
Have I?

491
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,404
Because I spoke to her
once in this garden

492
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:44,365
and one of your little spies
came running to tell you?

493
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,825
Why shouldn't I take
an interest?

494
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,285
- She's an interesting girl.
- Is she?

495
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,329
No, not particularly.

496
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,206
But she's had
an interesting childhood.

497
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,125
She has, sadly.

498
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,461
Well, forgive me for wasting
your time, then.

499
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:59,923
I thought we shared
certain hopes for
her well-being.

500
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,174
Come, come.

501
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,885
You surrender
rather easily.

502
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,638
Walk with me.

503
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,723
I know the walls
have ears,

504
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:10,850
but apparently
the shrubbery does, too.

505
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,728
I choose my allies
carefully

506
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:16,814
and my enemies
more carefully still.

507
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,691
Which is Sansa Stark?

508
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,402
Neither.
A babe in the woods.

509
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,738
- I admired her father.
- Yes.

510
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:25,907
Ned Stark
had many admirers,

511
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,492
and how many
stepped forward

512
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,786
when the executioner
came for his head?

513
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,704
I could not help
Lord Stark.

514
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:35,041
- Perhaps I can help
his daughter.
- How?

515
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:38,545
You're not
the only one who has
taken an interest in her.

516
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,213
That's hardly surprising.

517
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,590
She's a beautiful girl
with a famous name.

518
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:46,052
Indeed.
She'd make a lovely match
for the right suitor.

519
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,888
It almost feels
as if you're about
to arrive at the point.

520
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,641
Littlefinger is not long
for the capital.

521
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,893
A confidant of mine
has told me

522
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:56,771
that when he goes,
Sansa Stark goes with him.

523
00:30:56,854 --> 00:30:58,731
And why have you come
to me with this matter?

524
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:02,902
Littlefinger was born
with no lands, no wealth,
no armies.

525
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,821
He has acquired
the first two.

526
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,239
How long before
he has the army?

527
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,741
Perhaps you'll laugh,

528
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,451
but I know him
better than most

529
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,620
and this is the truth.

530
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:17,458
Littlefinger is one
of the most dangerous
men in Westeros.

531
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,877
If Robb Stark falls,

532
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,879
Sansa Stark is the key
to the North.

533
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:25,133
And if Littlefinger
marries her, he'll have
the key in his pocket.

534
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,176
Which seems such a shame.

535
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,387
Why should a man
with such a low reputation

536
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,097
steal away
such a lovely bride?

537
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,474
( chuckles )
You must despise him.

538
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,685
You're working so hard
to undermine him.

539
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,646
Actually,
I rather enjoy him.

540
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,815
But he would see
this country burn

541
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:43,109
if he could be
king of the ashes.

542
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,986
You are a clever man,
Lord Varys.

543
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,904
You are too kind.

544
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,490
I believe I have
a possible solution.

545
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,367
One doesn't need
to be clever for that.

546
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,785
It's all rather obvious,
isn't it?

547
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,584
<i>( waves crashing )</i>

548
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,002
<i>( seabirds calling )</i>

549
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,466
Ahem.

550
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,384
I didn't mean
to disturb you.

551
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,219
You haven't.

552
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,180
We'd like
some privacy, please.

553
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,223
If you wouldn't mind
waiting back inside the keep.

554
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,811
Or if you'd be kind enough
to give me your names,

555
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,689
I'll ask the king
to speak with you himself.

556
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,986
What did you pray for?

557
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,656
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?

558
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,367
I'll tell you
what I prayed for
in the sept this morning.

559
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:36,621
Let's see,
for my family's
health and happiness,

560
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,999
for an end to the war,
for a short winter.

561
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,585
Boring and traditional,
I'm afraid.

562
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:46,130
- And you?
- I'm sorry, I just can't.

563
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,091
My cousin Alanna

564
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,551
was the most beautiful
girl I'd ever seen.

565
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,720
When I was 12, I was
all elbows and knees

566
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,181
and Alanna looked
like a goddess sent
to torture me.

567
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:57,016
- Pig-face, she called me.
- ( laughs )

568
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,060
Pig-face?
That's ridiculous.

569
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,145
I think it had something
to do with my nose.

570
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,856
Whenever she passed me
in the halls, she'd oink.

571
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,818
- ( snorts )
- ( laughs )

572
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,320
So I prayed that she'd catch
a horrible skin disease.

573
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,614
A week after that,
she came down with
porridge plague.

574
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,158
- Porridge plague?
- You don't have it
in the North?

575
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,911
Your skin starts
to look like boiled oats

576
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:19,622
and eventually your face
slides off and you die
in agony.

577
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,416
But that's awful.

578
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,295
- ( laughs )
- You're--

579
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,423
I believed you!

580
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,341
Porridge plague.
I'm an idiot.

581
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,385
Don't say that.
No, you're not.

582
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:35,138
So what happened
to Alanna?

583
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,265
Oh, she grew up to be
the most beautiful woman

584
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,101
and married a handsome lord
and they have darling children

585
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,103
and live in a castle
by the sea.

586
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,647
It's all terribly
frustrating.

587
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,567
I'm sure she's jealous
of you now.

588
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,736
You'll be married
here in the capital

589
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:53,448
and she'll have to come
watch and pretend to be
happy that you're queen.

590
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,117
( laughs )

591
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,996
I want us to be friends,
good friends.

592
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,081
That would make me
very happy.

593
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,626
You must see Highgarden.

594
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,920
You'd love it there.
I know you would.

595
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,757
We have a great
masquerade the night
of the harvest moon.

596
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,300
You should see
the costumes.

597
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,760
People work on them
for months.

598
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,305
I-- I don't think
the queen

599
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,890
would let me leave
King's Landing.

600
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,767
The Queen Regent,
you mean.

601
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,019
Once I marry Joffrey,
I'll be queen.

602
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:29,358
And if you were
to marry Loras...

603
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:35,615
Oh, your place would
be at Highgarden,
wouldn't it?

604
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,993
We would be sisters,
you and I.

605
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:40,828
Would you like that?

606
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,345
His name was Bannen.

607
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,263
He was a good man,

608
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,182
a good ranger.

609
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,351
He came to us from--

610
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,021
where did he come from?

611
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,690
Down White Harbor way.

612
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,776
He came to us
from White Harbor.

613
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,987
Never failed
in his duty.

614
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,990
He kept his vows
the best he could.

615
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,994
He rode far,
fought fiercely.

616
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,457
We shall never see
his like again.

617
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,794
All:
And now his watch
has ended.

618
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,006
And now his watch
has ended.

619
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,597
Didn't think a broke foot
could kill a man.

620
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,392
It wasn't his foot
that killed him.

621
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,769
That bastard Craster
starved him to death.

622
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,896
Craster's got
his daughters to feed.

623
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,439
Rast:
<i>You on his side?</i>

624
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,442
We can't just show up
and steal all his food.

625
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,945
We're brothers
of the Night's Watch,
not thieves.

626
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,947
The day we leave,

627
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,617
Craster will tap
a barrel of our wine

628
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,871
<i>and sit down to a feast</i>
<i>of ham and potatoes</i>

629
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,622
<i>and laugh at us</i>

630
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:09,041
starving in the snow.

631
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,462
He's a bloody wildling
is all he is.

632
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,510
Never knew Bannen
could smell so good.

633
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:26,392
<i>( dog barking )</i>

634
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,438
<i>( pigs snorting )</i>

635
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,900
You have one son,
don't you, Mormont?

636
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,862
I had my 99th.

637
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,074
You ever meet a man
with 99 sons?

638
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:47,204
And more daughters
than I can count.

639
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,749
- I'm glad for you.
- Are you now?

640
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:53,377
Me, I'll be glad when you
and yours have gone.

641
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,296
As soon as our wounded
are strong enough.

642
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,465
Ah.

643
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,216
They're as strong
as they're gonna get.

644
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,095
Them that's dying,

645
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,181
why don't you
cut their throats
and be done with it?

646
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,974
<i>Hmm?</i>

647
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,394
<i>Or leave them</i>
<i>if you've not the stomach</i>

648
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,771
and I'll sort them myself.

649
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,439
( chuckles )

650
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,983
Karl:
<i>Whose throat you</i>
<i>gonna cut, old man?</i>

651
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,988
Wait outside.

652
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,367
It's cold outside
and there's nothing
to eat.

653
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,701
My wives gave you bread.

654
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:29,163
There's sawdust
in the bread.

655
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:30,748
You don't like it,

656
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,959
you go out there
and eat the snow.

657
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,884
I'd rather eat
what you've got
hidden away.

658
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,014
I told you
to wait outside.

659
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,849
He's sitting there
drinking our wine,

660
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,476
eating his fill
while we die.

661
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,188
I gave you crows enough.

662
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,523
I've got to feed
my women!

663
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,358
So you admit you've got
a hidden larder, then?

664
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,859
How else'd you make it
through winter?

665
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,029
Enough!
Out!

666
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,864
I am a godly man.

667
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,199
You're a stingy bastard!

668
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:06,867
Bastard?

669
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,121
Out with you,
you little thief.

670
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:13,833
And you!
And you!

671
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:18,170
Go sleep in the cold
on empty bellies.

672
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,882
I'll chop the hands
off the next man

673
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,176
who calls me bastard.

674
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,818
You are a bastard.

675
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:47,116
A daughter-fucking,
wildling bastard.

676
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,076
( shouts )

677
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,788
- ( women screaming )
- ( gurgling )

678
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,959
Mormont:
The gods will
curse us for this.

679
00:38:57,043 --> 00:39:00,296
- By all the laws--
- There are no laws
beyond the Wall.

680
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,839
Now show us where
he hides the food

681
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:04,133
or you'll get
the same as he did.

682
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,135
Unhand her.

683
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,304
- I shall have
your head for this.
- ( grunts )

684
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,184
<i>( sword clatters )</i>

685
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,727
( shouting )

686
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,896
- ( woman screaming )
- ( men shouting )

687
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,282
( groans )

688
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,131
( gasping )

689
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,066
- Quickly. Quickly.
- What's happening?

690
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:05,820
- I'm not going out there.
- No, we have to go. Now!

691
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,989
( baby crying )

692
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,991
( swords clanging )

693
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,536
Follow me.
I know the best way.

694
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,206
Come on.

695
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,839
Run fast, Piggy,

696
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,091
and sleep well!

697
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,927
I'll be cutting your throat
one of these nights.

698
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,934
Arya:
Can I take
this hood off yet?

699
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,811
I do apologize,
little lady,

700
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,397
but it's better for you
if you don't see where
we're going.

701
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,440
<i>( horse neighs )</i>

702
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,693
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

703
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,863
Halt!

704
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,996
- What is it?
- Blackstrap rum.

705
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,331
Ugh!

706
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,709
Not easy finding
molasses in wartime.

707
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,752
Gendry:
I'd have some.

708
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,424
Let's go home.

709
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,526
Gendry:
<i>What is this place?</i>

710
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,654
Somewhere neither wolves
nor lions come prowling.

711
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:42,166
You look like
a bunch of swineherds.

712
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,501
Anguy:
<i>Some of us</i>
<i>were swineherds.</i>

713
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:47,254
And some of us tanners
and masons.

714
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,464
That was before.

715
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,633
You're still swineherds

716
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:53,427
and tanners
and masons.

717
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:56,472
You think carrying
a crooked spear makes
you a soldier?

718
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:59,850
No.

719
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:03,229
Fighting in a war
makes you a soldier.

720
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,272
Beric Dondarrion?

721
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,941
<i>You've seen better days.</i>

722
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,193
And I won't see them again.

723
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,947
Stark deserters.

724
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,324
Baratheon deserters.

725
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,201
You lot aren't
fighting in a war.

726
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,786
You're running from it.

727
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,955
Last I heard, you were
King Joffrey's guard dog.

728
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:24,959
But here you are
1,000 miles from home.

729
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,752
Which of us is running?

730
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,504
Untie these ropes
and we'll find out.

731
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:32,216
What are you doing
leading a mob of peasants?

732
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,135
Ned Stark ordered me
to execute your brother

733
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,470
<i>in King Robert's name.</i>

734
00:42:36,553 --> 00:42:39,223
Ned Stark is dead.

735
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,558
King Robert is dead.

736
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,727
My brother's alive.

737
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,856
You're fighting
for ghosts.

738
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,900
That's what we are--

739
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:53,612
ghosts waiting for you
in the dark.

740
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:56,156
You can't see us,

741
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,992
but we see you.

742
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,327
No matter whose cloak
you wear--

743
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,080
Lannister, Stark,
Baratheon--

744
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,165
you prey on the weak,

745
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,668
the Brotherhood
without Banners
will hunt you down.

746
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,837
You found god?
Is that it?

747
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,840
Aye.
I've been reborn

748
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,758
in the light
of the one true god.

749
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,177
<i>As have we all.</i>

750
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,763
<i>As would any man who's seen</i>
<i>the things we've seen.</i>

751
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,599
If you mean to murder me,
then bloody well
get on with it.

752
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:25,811
You'll die
soon enough, dog.

753
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:28,856
But it won't be murder,
only justice.

754
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,275
Anguy:
<i>And a kinder fate</i>
<i>than you deserve.</i>

755
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,027
<i>Lions you call</i>
<i>yourselves.</i>

756
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,738
At the Mummer's Ford,
girls of seven years
were raped

757
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,906
<i>and babes</i>
<i>still on the breast</i>

758
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,700
were cut in two while
their mothers watched.

759
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,286
I wasn't at
the Mummer's Ford.

760
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,955
Dump your dead children
at some other door.

761
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,874
House Clegane was built
upon dead children.

762
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,752
I saw them lay Prince Aegon
and Princess Rhaenys

763
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,045
before the Iron Throne.

764
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,130
Do you take me
for my brother?

765
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,591
Is being born
Clegane a crime?

766
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:58,385
- Murder is a crime.
- I never touched
the Targaryen babes.

767
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,680
I never saw them,
never smelled them,

768
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,098
never heard them bawling.

769
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:06,894
You want to cut my throat,
get on with it!

770
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,355
But don't call me murderer

771
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,231
and pretend that you're not.

772
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,275
You murdered Mycah.

773
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,735
The butcher's boy.

774
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,862
My friend.

775
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,990
He was 12 years old.
He was unarmed.

776
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,742
<i>And you rode him down.</i>

777
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,203
You slung him
over your horse
like he was some deer.

778
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,288
Aye, he was a bleeder.

779
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,541
You don't deny
killing this boy?

780
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,085
I was Joffrey's
sworn shield.

781
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,795
- The boy attacked the prince.
- That's a lie!

782
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:36,256
I hit Joffrey.
Mycah just ran away.

783
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,925
Then I should have
killed you.

784
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:41,678
Not my place
to question princes.

785
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,140
You stand accused of murder.

786
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,393
But no one here knows
the truth of the charge,

787
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,895
so it is not for us
to judge you.

788
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:52,147
Only the Lord of Light
may do that now.

789
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,819
I sentence you
to trial by combat.

790
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:01,323
So, who will it be?

791
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:04,660
Should we find out
if your fire god

792
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,620
really loves you, priest?

793
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:10,165
Or you, archer?
What are you worth
with a sword in your hand?

794
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,169
Or is the little girl
the bravest one here?

795
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,757
Aye.

796
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,968
She might be.

797
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:25,180
But it's me you'll fight.

798
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,905

799
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,409
<i>( Kraznys speaking Valyrian )</i>

The master says
they are untested.

801
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,421
He says you would be wise
to blood them early.

802
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:00,174
There are many small cities
between here and there,

803
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,259
cities ripe for sacking.

804
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,138
<i>Should you take captives,</i>

805
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:09,516
the masters
will buy the healthy ones
and for a good price.

806

In 10 years,
some of the boys
you send them

809
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,904
may be Unsullied
in their turn.

810
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:24,198
Thus all shall prosper.
