1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,240
<i>How will we be remembered?</i>

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,360
<i>Will it be
for saving the world twice?</i>

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
<i>Nope, we're the team who broke time.</i>

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,360
<i>That's right. History
has been torn to shreds.</i>

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,200
<i>Which means, it's up to us</i>

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,080
<i>to put it back together again
piece by piece,</i>

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,240
<i>fixing these so-called anachronisms
before we get torn to shreds.</i>

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,040
<i>So please, don't call us heroes.</i>

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,800
<i>We're Legends.</i>

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,480
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,840
I told you, I was leaving
to create an organization

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,960
to replace the Time Masters.

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,080
- Fifteen minutes ago.
- For you.

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,760
Forming the Time Bureau
has been the work

15
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,760
of the last five years of my life.

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,360
They are undependable,
unpredictable, dangerous.

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,680
Yeah.

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,920
My decision to leave
had nothing to do with you.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,360
I could feel myself losing control.

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,400
The animal was in charge, not me.

21
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,720
Tell me what we're facing here.

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,600
That information is need-to-know.

23
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,720
Welcome back, Kuasa.

24
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,720
<i>This is A.R.G.U.S.</i>

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,600
<i>Anti-meta-human curfew is in effect.</i>

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,200
<i>Citizens, please stay in your homes.</i>

27
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,480
HQ, this is Transport X-17.

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,840
En route to facility.

29
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,440
<i>Copy, X-17.</i>

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,200
<i>Standing by to receive prisoner.</i>

31
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,880
What the hell?

32
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,480
Hey!

33
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,560
Code 99.

34
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,240
We have a code 99!

35
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,520
So there's this theory

36
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,760
{\an5}that the phrase
"bring home the bacon"

37
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,680
started in a town in Old England.

38
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,440
{\an5}Bacon was awarded to any man
who can truthfully say

39
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,960
{\an5}he and his wife had not argued
that past year.

40
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,480
The same cannot be said
of you and Ms. Jiwe, however.

41
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,200
No, because I'm eating bacon.

42
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,840
- But since you asked...
- I didn't.

43
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,960
Hey, it is a little awkward.

44
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,320
I mean, I am a little resentful...

45
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,440
Please, if you need
to discuss this with someone,

46
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,440
I would suggest Amaya.

47
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,640
Yeah, I know.
We should talk things out, but...

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,320
Amaya.

49
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,480
Acute arachnoid somnambulism.

50
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,960
Now, this really is fascinating.

51
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,280
Oh, my God.

52
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,280
She's having a dream she's a spider.

53
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,360
{\an5}We gotta wake her up
before she crawls into the engine.

54
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,160
- Amaya!
- You're not supposed

55
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,280
to wake a sleepwalker,

56
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,520
{\an5}especially when they're stuck
to the ceiling.

57
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,840
Why not? Amaya!

58
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,480
That's why.

59
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
Are you okay?

60
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,480
I... I was, I was having a nightmare.

61
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,680
{\an5}And in the process,
summoned the ashe of a spider.

62
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,880
{\an5}- Astonishing!
- No, Martin. It isn't.

63
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,200
What if I summoned a rhino

64
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,040
{\an5}and I crashed through the hull
of the ship?

65
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,640
Or a lion and I mauled someone?

66
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,600
{\an5}Well, if the victim was Mr. Rory,
I can imagine...

67
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,920
{\an5}It's gonna be okay.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,840
{\an5}We're gonna figure out what's going
on with you and your totem.

69
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,000
What do you think
I've been trying to do

70
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,160
for the past six months?

71
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,000
{\an5}In my experience, there is no problem
that cannot be solved

72
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,880
by the rigorous application
of science.

73
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,680
It's a mystical totem, Martin.

74
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,560
{\an5}I believe we should start
in the med bay.

75
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,680
Please, please.
Come with me. Come with me.

76
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,160
<i>Code 99.</i>

77
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,720
<i>This is Agent Gary Green.</i>

78
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,840
<i>Seattle, Washington, 2042.</i>

79
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,120
{\an5}<i>I just witnessed a female meta
of unknown origin.</i>

80
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,440
<i>She killed everyone.</i>

81
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,320
Hey. What's going on?

82
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,840
{\an5}We intercepted a distress call
from one of Rip's Time Bureau agents.

83
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,960
Why? Actually, forget it.

84
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,720
- I don't care.
- It's the dweeby one, Gary.

85
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Still don't care.

86
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,680
{\an5}Yeah, I gotta go
with Mick on this one.

87
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,200
Why would we help those ass clowns?

88
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,640
I mean, that's not our job.

89
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,160
{\an5}Hopefully, that little time
dweeb learns his lesson.

90
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,800
{\an5}Agreed, but last time I checked,
we help people who are in trouble.

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't.

92
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,160
Something feels off about this place.

93
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,640
Yeah. Like, where is everybody?

94
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,200
Martial law. It's a police state.

95
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,880
- How do you know?
- I can smell pigs.

96
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,400
He's right.

97
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,400
All the cars on the street
are military.

98
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,120
More pigs! Get down! Get down!

99
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,840
That's A.R.G.U.S., covert
paramilitary organization.

100
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,320
Yeah, but it seems they've
forgotten how to be covert.

101
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,520
The signal we intercepted
came from over there.

102
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,160
Should be here somewhere.

103
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,320
Gary!

104
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Gary!

105
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,400
{\an5}- Gary!
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

106
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,560
She's gonna kill me.

107
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,080
The chick from your distress call?

108
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
Agent Sharpe.

109
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,560
She hates you guys.

110
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,520
Well, feeling's mutual.

111
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,560
Look, you said there was
a female meta killing everyone.

112
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,360
{\an5}- What's going on?
- No, this is classified

113
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,560
Time Bureau business.

114
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,080
Open your mouth and say some words.

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,320
Guess you're gonna have to decide
who you're more afraid of,

116
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,560
Agent Sharpe or Mick here.

117
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,720
The Bureau got a ping
on some unregulated time travel.

118
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,680
But when I got here, the person
I was supposed to arrest...

119
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,520
Was a meta-human
who had no problem murdering people?

120
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,880
Her powers let her control water.

121
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,360
A human squirt gun. Big deal.

122
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,160
No, you guys really have no idea
how dangerous this woman is.

123
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,600
Dweeb's right.
That chick's dangerous.

124
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,320
She just blew through
those pigs like it was nothing.

125
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,280
Actually, I fought someone

126
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,200
with water powers like this
a few years ago.

127
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,320
It was not very pleasant.

128
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,960
Well, why would
a time-traveling meta-human

129
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,760
come to 2042 to kill
a bunch of A.R.G.U.S. agents?

130
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
She didn't.

131
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,040
She came here to kill their prisoner.

132
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,480
Well, it looks like she struck out.

133
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,960
Something tells me our assassin
doesn't give up so easily.

134
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,200
- You got a plan, Captain?
- Why?

135
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,440
We saved Four-eyes.
Mission accomplished.

136
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,960
And Four-Eyes' mission
was to prevent the anachronism.

137
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,360
You mean stop the water witch

138
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,720
before she kills whoever
was in the back of that truck?

139
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,040
Gideon, scan A.R.G.U.S.' logs.

140
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,640
See if you can ID the prisoner.

141
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,320
<i>I can do better than that, Captain.</i>

142
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,160
<i>I can project the prisoner's
most likely destination.</i>

143
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,240
Even better.

144
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,480
Zari Tomaz?

145
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,280
Come with us if you want to live.

146
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,240
Yeah, I used that one once.

147
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,360
Come on, let's get out of here.

148
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,320
Yeah, I don't know who you are
or what you're doing

149
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,160
but you're gonna lead A.R.G.U.S.
right here.

150
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,960
No, don't worry.
We can protect you.

151
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,160
Who's gonna protect you?

152
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,480
<i>This is A.R.G.U.S.</i>

153
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,960
<i>Sara Lance, Nathaniel Heywood,</i>

154
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,720
<i>Raymond Palmer, and Mick Rory,
you are listed</i>

155
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,640
<i>in the Meta-human Registry
as missing.</i>

156
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,880
<i>You are hereby under arrest</i>

157
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,040
<i>for violating
the Anti-Meta-human Act.</i>

158
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,160
Anti-Meta-human?

159
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,160
Yeah, meta-humans
have been illegal since 2021.

160
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,000
- Didn't you guys get the memo?
- No.

161
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,920
Well, nice to meet you. I'm out.

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,600
Wait, your life is still in danger!

163
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,520
<i>- Remain where you are.</i>
- Ditto. Bye.

164
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,800
<i>Detainment units have been notified.</i>

165
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,960
Hate to destroy
futuristic technology, but...

166
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,320
Stand down!

167
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,640
Go! Go!

168
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,880
You are surrounded.

169
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Under the Meta-human Act of 2021,
you are under arrest.

170
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,480
On the ground!

171
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,800
Hands behind your head!

172
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,160
Final warning!

173
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,000
Do as they say.

174
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,400
You gotta be kidding me.

175
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,560
That's an order.

176
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,640
Don't suppose
I get to call my lawyer.

177
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,080
- What?
- I wanted to shoot someone.

178
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,440
All right, let's get back
to the Waverider,

179
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,080
see if we can get a line on Tomaz.

180
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,440
Why?

181
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,120
Pretty sure she just told us
to screw off.

182
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,160
Doesn't change the fact
that there's a rogue time traveler

183
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,240
trying to kill her.

184
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,440
- I can see why.
- Let's go.

185
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,840
There's nothing to worry about.

186
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,400
Gideon can't find anything
medically wrong with you.

187
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,320
I told you, Martin.
My problem is mystical.

188
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,600
It's not scientific.

189
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,360
Believe me, mysticism
is merely science

190
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,920
that hasn't been understood yet.

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,120
Hey! Did you figure out
what's wrong with her?

192
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
I'm sitting right here, Nathaniel.

193
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,080
I suggest we consider
a new battery of tests...

194
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,840
- I don't think there's...
- To check on an overactive

195
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,880
hippocampus,
latent chromosomal imbalance,

196
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,000
not to mention temporal dysplasia.

197
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,080
I'll ask Jax to adjust
Gideon's diagnostic algorithm.

198
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,320
There's no algorithm
for what's wrong with me.

199
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,240
It's my totem.

200
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,840
It's the legacy of my ancestors.

201
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,320
Great, so let's go talk
to your ancestors.

202
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,320
We're on a time ship.

203
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,440
This totem means
I protect my village,

204
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,120
not mess with its history.

205
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,360
What is her problem?

206
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,920
Side effect of temporal dysplasia,
I suspect.

207
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,160
Hey, how you feeling?

208
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,280
Like I just understood

209
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,280
what you meant
by the term "mansplaining".

210
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,280
I take it from Nathaniel's
premature return.

211
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,160
You didn't have much luck
with Ms. Tomaz.

212
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Well, that was interesting.

213
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,840
Turns out Zari's a bit of a,
not very nice person.

214
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,120
Apparently, it's illegal
to be a meta-human in 2042.

215
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,120
You know what I don't get? A.R.G.U.S.

216
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,160
- In 2016, they weren't...
- Idiots.

217
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,280
Well, I was gonna say

218
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,640
they weren't trying to control
the city with killer drones, but...

219
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,680
Any authoritarian organization
always goes bad, always.

220
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,160
Which means
it's only a matter of time

221
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,280
before Rip and his Time Bureau
turn into the Time Gestapo.

222
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,800
In case you've forgotten,
the Time Bureau only exists

223
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,840
to clean up your time mess.

224
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,720
Which now includes
an at-large time assassin

225
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,240
and a fugitive hacker!

226
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,960
Is that your way of thanking us
for rescuing you?

227
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,800
Gideon, do we have
a location on Zari yet?

228
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,200
<i>Negative, Captain.</i>

229
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,360
<i>I'm afraid Ms. Tomaz
has stepped up her efforts</i>

230
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,760
<i>to remain undetected.</i>

231
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,720
Damn, I can see why.
Look at this rap sheet.

232
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,640
Burglary, larceny,
grand larceny, identity theft,

233
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,160
trespassing, digital trespassing,
meta-human smuggling, conspiracy...

234
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,600
Impressive.

235
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,280
Multiple religious infractions.

236
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,360
- What do you mean?
- Zari's Muslim.

237
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,600
And apparently religion
is illegal in 2042.

238
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,360
Rory, if you had this much heat
on you, where would you go?

239
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,520
My bar.

240
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,840
What have they done to my bar?

241
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,640
Too much, Ray, too much.

242
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,040
What? I look like
I just robbed a bank.

243
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,560
Or a costume store.

244
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
There she is.

245
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,560
You run, scream,
or sic one of those drones on us,

246
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,760
I'll light you up.

247
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,960
You got that, missy?

248
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,160
Are you guys stalking me?

249
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,360
Not me, but for some reason,
my boss has a bee in her bonnet

250
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,400
about protecting you
from that water bitch.

251
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,680
Not you, sweetheart.

252
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,320
Yeah, I can take care of myself.

253
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,600
Is that right?

254
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,360
Is that why you're in this bar?

255
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,920
Looking to hire muscle?

256
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,840
Look, you can trust us, okay?

257
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
We're the good guys.

258
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,440
Oh, don't be fooled by our disguises.

259
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
Good guy!

260
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,480
It's her.

261
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,560
Let's get out of here. Come on.

262
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,840
Oh, a pool party.

263
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Cute tricks.

264
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,720
Get her to the ship!

265
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,160
You guys have a ship?

266
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,320
Is it a big ship?

267
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,480
How about a diversion, Rory?

268
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,800
Who wants to fight?

269
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
Go!

270
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,680
Okay, this is almost amazing.

271
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,280
What do you mean, "almost"?

272
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,280
Don't worry. You'll be safe here.

273
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,920
Who's the woman that's after you?

274
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,600
No idea.

275
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,000
Any idea of why someone
would want to kill you?

276
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,720
Yeah, I can think
of quite a few, actually.

277
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,080
Look, if we're gonna help you,

278
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,080
you need to start being
more straightforward.

279
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,120
What is she doing here?

280
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,240
Water woman was trying to kill her,
so we're, protecting her.

281
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,280
No, this is technology
you are not allowed to see.

282
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,520
Civilians are not allowed
to know about time travel.

283
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,800
Wait, you guys are time travelers?

284
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,440
Nice one, Gary.

285
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,160
Okay, that's on me.

286
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,680
But still, our job is to prevent
the anachronism.

287
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,080
Which means, capturing
the assassin, not the target.

288
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,760
I can't believe...

289
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,040
You guys are time-traveling
superheroes?

290
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,760
Yeah, we've actually
saved the world, twice.

291
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,880
Not that we're counting.

292
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,840
Really? You saved the world.

293
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,200
- Twice!
- Then why does it still suck?

294
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,480
Just for the record...

295
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,720
dealing with that messed-up
police state of yours?

296
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,480
That's on our to-do list, so...

297
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,040
But after we capture the person
trying to kill you.

298
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,200
And we need your help to do it.

299
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,480
Oh, I get it.

300
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,000
Since you have no way
of tracking this water psycho,

301
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,720
you plan to use me as bait, right?

302
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,720
Right.

303
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,800
Okay, I'll help you,
on one condition.

304
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,120
You help me break my brother
out of the A.R.G.U.S. facility

305
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,280
where they're holding him.

306
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
Prison break.

307
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,480
- I'm in.
- No, no.

308
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,000
No, no, no, no, no,
they're not helping you,

309
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,240
because they're still helping me.

310
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,560
Guys, this mission has gone
way off-the-rails as it is.

311
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,800
Zari's brother is not the priority.

312
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,440
If you really want my help,
then that's my price.

313
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,480
Guess we're breaking
into an A.R.G.U.S. prison.

314
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,320
Okay, so I've been
doing some research.

315
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,120
Turns out there's a root
from your region of Zambesi

316
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,440
that's known for its spiritual
healing properties.

317
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,360
- The Lyoga root?
- That's the one.

318
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,960
It's a powerful hallucinogen.

319
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,400
Yes, and people use it
to go on vision quests.

320
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,720
Oh, so you admit that my problem
might be mystical in nature?

321
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,120
Well, if you say it's mystical,
then it's mystical.

322
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,480
Anyways, I was having
a chat with Gideon.

323
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,080
And it turns out, our favorite
talking supercomputer

324
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,640
is really great at synthesizing
pretty much anything.

325
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
No.

326
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,800
Please tell me you didn't.

327
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,720
We re-created the Lyoga root
extract right here on the ship.

328
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,160
I mean, Gideon did most of the work.
I pushed, like, seven buttons.

329
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,440
Nate, this is a really bad idea.

330
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,800
A single miscalculation
could be lethal.

331
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,160
Which is why I did a quality
control test on myself first.

332
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,360
What?

333
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,240
- You already took it?
- Yeah.

334
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,840
I just had to make sure it was safe.

335
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,360
So far, pretty good.

336
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,040
The tongue, getting a little numb.

337
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,080
But, you should drink it now
so we peak at the same time, please.

338
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Okay.

339
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,160
Right, we should be
sitting down for this.

340
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,000
The room should be dark.

341
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,320
Gideon?

342
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,600
Okay.

343
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,200
So what do we do now?

344
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,920
Believe it or not,
this is my first vision quest.

345
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,560
Do we chant?

346
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,640
- No.
- No.

347
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,840
We stop talking.

348
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,040
Close your eyes and just breathe.

349
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,640
Breathing in.

350
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,280
Breathing out. Breathing in again...

351
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
Nate.

352
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,160
Sorry.

353
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,480
- Rory, don't.
- Just a little.

354
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,560
Maybe later.

355
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,080
Which way?

356
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,520
My brother's in the east wing annex.

357
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,720
The blueprints Gideon downloaded
said the control panel's this way.

358
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,320
You guys open the cell.

359
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,680
Let's go talk to your brother.

360
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,160
Now.

361
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,640
Hey! How's it going?

362
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,200
There's no maintenance
scheduled here till tomorrow.

363
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,000
Really? We got a call that,
something was broken.

364
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,400
- Yeah? What?
- Your nose.

365
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,560
Says here my brother's
being held in cell 4587.

366
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,000
You guys got a location
on the other security console?

367
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,600
Yep, all clear.

368
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,320
All right, which cell do
we need to open?

369
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,880
It's room 4587.

370
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Okay, I'm on it.

371
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,240
Wait a minute.

372
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,840
You mean everybody
locked up in here is a meta?

373
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,840
Yeah. Looks like A.R.G.U.S.
is conducting experiments on them.

374
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,760
Guys, open the cell, now.

375
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,480
I can do a lot better than that.

376
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,040
What are you doing?

377
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,600
What does it look like?

378
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,680
Hurry! This way. Come on.

379
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,800
Let's go!

380
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,120
I thought you were just
gonna open her brother's cell.

381
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,000
You didn't see
what we saw on the monitors.

382
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,080
A.R.G.U.S. is experimenting
on these prisoners.

383
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,360
Hey, where's Zari?

384
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,120
What the hell is going on?

385
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,320
I thought this was just
about grabbing your brother.

386
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,200
Yeah, about that? Sorry.

387
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,400
- Sorry for what?
- There is no brother.

388
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,360
There is no prison break.

389
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,760
It's a heist.

390
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,240
You used us.

391
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,720
We bent over backwards to help you.

392
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,880
As lies go,
this was a pretty white one.

393
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,800
This used to be my brother's.

394
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,960
Now it's mine.

395
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,640
Oh, my God.

396
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,760
- Nate?
- Not supposed to talk.

397
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
Nate, look.

398
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,880
Not supposed
to open your eyes either.

399
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,960
Oh! I think I'm starting to peak.

400
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,160
Amaya, you okay?

401
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
Oh, boy.

402
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,920
Where's Zari?

403
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,160
Go! Go!

404
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,320
Oh, man!

405
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,360
Knock yourself out.

406
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,320
About time.

407
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,760
<i>Nate, buddy?</i>

408
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,960
<i>We need you to bring
the Waverider to us, now.</i>

409
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,280
Stay.

410
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Okay...

411
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,040
Yeah, I can...

412
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,840
I can do that.

413
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,840
<i>My face! My face!</i>

414
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,240
<i>This room is huge!</i>

415
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,080
Pulling up the anchor!

416
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,680
Raising the sails!

417
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,640
Full speed ahead!

418
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,040
That's enough, Zari!

419
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,320
You're not going anywhere without us.

420
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Is that right?

421
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,360
That's a cool getaway.

422
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,960
Don't worry. I'll follow her.

423
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,480
Where's Pretty?

424
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,320
Nate, how are we doing
with that rescue?

425
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,680
I'm giving her all she's got,
Captain!

426
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,040
The ship can't take
much more of this!

427
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,560
<i>Actually, Dr. Heywood,
the engines are still idling.</i>

428
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,560
Then why does it feel like
my face is peeling off?

429
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,160
<i>Yo, are you high or something, man?</i>

430
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
You have no idea.

431
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,680
Gideon, take command of the ship.

432
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,560
I'll arrange a rendezvous point.

433
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,720
Let's get out of here.

434
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,440
Where's Stein anyway?

435
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,120
<i>I believe he's checking on Ms. Giwe.</i>

436
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,040
<i>She seems to be experiencing
a, well, unusual side effect.</i>

437
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,560
<i>And as for Mr. Heywood, he's in...</i>

438
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,160
We got bigger fish to fry.

439
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,000
Ray, you have eyes on Zari?

440
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,560
<i>Yep, I'm on her tail, not literally.</i>

441
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,360
<i>I'm following her posterior
from a respectable distance.</i>

442
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,880
I can't believe
she played us like that.

443
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,400
The whole sob story
about her brother,

444
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,120
just an excuse to get her hands
on some magical necklace.

445
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,080
When we find that chick,
I am gonna kill her.

446
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,320
I like her.

447
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,280
When you say kill her,
what you really mean is...

448
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,800
Kill her. And slowly.

449
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,440
No, no, no, no, no, no,
we have to restore the timeline.

450
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,800
Which means, getting Ms. Tomaz

451
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,800
back to the A.R.G.U.S. black site
where she belongs

452
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,720
and tracking down your time assassin.

453
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,600
Oh, and cleaning up
the prison debacle!

454
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,240
Don't worry, Gary. We got this.

455
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,200
Jeez Louise, this disaster
keeps getting bigger

456
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,640
and bigger and bigger.

457
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,200
What are you doing?

458
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,440
Well, I hate to say it,
but Gary's right.

459
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,000
We gotta put Zari back in the bottle.

460
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,320
Look, she's not exactly
my favorite person either right now.

461
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,400
But...

462
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,640
you didn't see how it was back there.

463
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,040
The way A.R.G.U.S.
was treating those people?

464
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,200
She played us, Jax.

465
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,040
We're lucky that it's not us
in that prison instead.

466
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,560
She had a water witch travel
through time to hunt her down.

467
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,200
I mean, did Zari really act
any differently

468
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,960
than you would've in that situation?

469
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,640
I'm just saying, do we really
want to be the people

470
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,640
who put her back in a meta prison?

471
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,480
Is that who we are?

472
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,040
I can see through my hand.

473
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,560
Are you on drugs?

474
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,080
Your face.

475
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,640
I want your face.

476
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,200
Okay, buddy.

477
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,120
Not a good idea.

478
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,480
- Gideon!
<i>- As I was trying to tell you,</i>

479
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,840
<i>Mr. Heywood is under the influence
of a hallucinogenic compound.</i>

480
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,720
To help Amaya with her totem problem.

481
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,360
Okay? It's totally safe.

482
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,280
People in her village do it
all the...

483
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,160
It's safe, I think.

484
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,360
<i>As for Ms. Giwe,</i>

485
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,680
<i>Professor Stein helped her
to the medical bay.</i>

486
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,560
Get him to his quarters now!

487
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,560
Give him some water
and maybe his fidget spinner.

488
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,040
I told you, bro.
Let's go. Come on now.

489
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,120
Cobra!

490
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,400
All right, all right. Just...

491
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,880
Amaya.

492
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
Amaya.

493
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,840
What is this place?

494
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,880
You are in the world between worlds.

495
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,200
Who are you?

496
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,000
I am your blood.

497
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,120
I am all who have come before you.

498
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,480
I can feel the fear inside you.

499
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,480
It is a burden that weighs
heavy on your heart.

500
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,160
My totem, I can feel it
growing stronger.

501
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,640
I fear that I'm losing
control over it.

502
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,000
You can't stop the
forces of nature...

503
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,280
no more than you can stop
a charging stallion.

504
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,480
You must learn to run beside it.

505
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,480
But why is it getting stronger?

506
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,160
The totem's strength grows

507
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,720
when the threats that you must
face become more powerful.

508
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,400
But you cannot face
this new threat alone.

509
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,200
You must find the girl.

510
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,640
She needs your protection.

511
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,360
Do not fail this new totem-bearer.

512
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,040
Do not resist your power.

513
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,320
Trust in it.

514
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
Zari.

515
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,440
Look, I don't want to fight,
but we gotta go.

516
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,080
We can't stay here. It's not safe.

517
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,360
I don't understand.

518
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,720
They're not here.

519
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,680
Nobody's here.

520
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,840
They were supposed to meet me here.

521
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,880
This was supposed to be our Jannah.

522
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,600
Jannah?

523
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,360
It means "sanctuary" in Arabic.

524
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,760
My brother had powers
because he wielded this.

525
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,000
He fought against A.R.G.U.S.'
injustices, so he was hunted.

526
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,080
We all were.

527
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,680
The night we were leaving,
A.R.G.U.S. raided our house.

528
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,960
Killed my brother...

529
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,280
and took the only part
that's left of him.

530
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,560
And that's how you got caught,
trying to steal it the first time?

531
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,280
Yeah, I couldn't let
A.R.G.U.S. keep it.

532
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,480
With my brother gone,
I needed its power

533
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,440
to help me protect my parents, but...

534
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,280
- Maybe they got away.
- Where?

535
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,360
Can't you see
there's nowhere left to go?

536
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,400
This was our last hope.

537
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,640
Zari, I'm sorry about everything

538
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,880
that's happened to your family,
but we really have to...

539
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,040
Sara, the water woman
just showed up,

540
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,680
and she looks pretty grumpy.

541
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,400
Like "kill anyone that gets
in her way" grumpy.

542
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,360
<i>Send us your coordinates.
We're on our way.</i>

543
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,280
What's going on now?

544
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,560
<i>Unidentified ship
approaching, Captain.</i>

545
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,080
- A.R.G.U.S.?
<i>- No, Captain.</i>

546
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,480
<i>It's the Time Bureau.</i>

547
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,600
I don't understand.

548
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,640
How does the Time Bureau
know where we were?

549
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,560
Gary!

550
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,520
I'm sorry, I know you said
you could handle it.

551
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,280
But you guys can't handle anything!

552
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,480
I should go.

553
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,240
<i>Sara Lance.</i>

554
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,880
<i>I see that you and your team
have managed</i>

555
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,560
<i>to get yourselves
in over your heads, again.</i>

556
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,920
- Chill, lady.
- We were just trying to help.

557
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,600
<i>By starting a prison riot
at the A.R.G.U.S. facility?</i>

558
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,680
<i>When are you going
to learn that the Legends</i>

559
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,520
<i>should not be interfering
with Bureau affairs?</i>

560
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,040
Maybe when you stop
screwing things up.

561
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,880
Perhaps it's best not
to antagonize someone

562
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,760
on such a large time ship.

563
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,640
I don't care what Gary says.

564
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,640
We don't need backup.

565
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,400
<i>Sara! I need backup!</i>

566
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,680
Sara!

567
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,840
Where are you guys?

568
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,040
<i>Interesting, sounds like
one of your team members</i>

569
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,040
<i>has stumbled sideways
into finding our assassin.</i>

570
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,200
Yes, that's rather our style.

571
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,800
<i>Just give us his coordinates.</i>

572
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,520
We would be happy
to save him for you.

573
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,200
You know these guys
are just gonna hand Zari back

574
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,320
to those A.R.G.U.S. bastards,

575
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,840
who are gonna do
God knows what to her.

576
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,040
<i>And if you don't comply,</i>

577
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,600
<i>we would also be happy
to scatter you all into space.</i>

578
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,720
Did you just shoot at us?

579
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,640
<i>I am not screwing around.
Give us those coordinates.</i>

580
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,480
<i>The next one will not
be a warning, Ms. Lance.</i>

581
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,960
I knew we shouldn't have trusted
that time dweeb.

582
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,840
Just give her what she wants.

583
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,160
Fine.

584
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,040
<i>I'll uplink their coordinates
to you now.</i>

585
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,720
You gotta be kidding me.

586
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,400
- Ready?
<i>- Ready to receive.</i>

587
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,640
- They're gone.
- I can see that, Gary.

588
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,320
Track their signature
and follow them.

589
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,640
That was easier
than I thought it'd be.

590
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,800
Is this what you're looking for?

591
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,400
So you do have it.

592
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,000
But are you capable of using it?

593
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,000
What are you offering for the totem?

594
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,240
I can give you
what you really want, Zari.

595
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,440
What you want more
than that little trinket.

596
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,480
I can give you revenge.

597
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,880
Revenge on A.R.G.U.S.

598
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,880
They targeted you and your family.

599
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,800
Turned you all
into fugitives and criminals.

600
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,000
They should die.

601
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,320
In exchange for your help,
I give you this?

602
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,880
You can't control this power.

603
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,320
It wasn't meant for you.

604
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,920
I can free you from this burden

605
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,800
and help you get justice
for your family.

606
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,440
Maybe picking a fight
with the Time Bureau

607
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,800
wasn't the best strategy.

608
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,120
Yep, well, they fired on us first.

609
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,440
<i>And if they continue to do so,</i>

610
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,400
<i>we will sustain critical damage
in less than five minutes.</i>

611
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,520
<i>Four minutes.</i>

612
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,240
Well?

613
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,760
I... I guess I have to say...

614
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,280
Sorry.

615
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,520
Come on, Ray. She's too much for us.

616
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,920
- We gotta move.
- And she tastes terrible!

617
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,720
- What's happening?
- Time pukes are shooting at us.

618
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,160
At least you seem to be
feeling better, Ms. Ziwe.

619
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,720
Yeah, Nathaniel's plan,
while ill-advised, was beneficial.

620
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,560
Quiet! The marshmallows are talking.

621
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,880
Get to the jump ship!

622
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,320
Get a fix on Ray's position

623
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,200
while Stein and I keep
our Time Bureau friends busy.

624
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,600
Not you, space ranger. Sit!

625
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,720
I really love this show.

626
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,320
Gideon, status.

627
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,920
<i>The jump ship has been deployed.</i>

628
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,880
<i>I don't believe our pursuers noticed.</i>

629
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,320
<i>Oh, dear!
I'm afraid our rear deflectors</i>

630
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,880
<i>have been completely lost, Captain.</i>

631
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,960
Sara, please.

632
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,120
We still have enough time to arrange
a détente with the Time Bureau.

633
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,520
A compromise, if you will.

634
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,320
Sorry, Martin. I don't compromise.

635
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,320
Would you please help me
talk some sense into her?

636
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,920
I like broccoli!

637
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,720
Gideon, divert everything
to our forward shields.

638
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,280
You guys might want to hold on.

639
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,360
Gideon, hail the Time Bureau.

640
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,480
<i>- What are you doing?</i>
- Being true to who we are.

641
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,800
My team doesn't roll over
on their own.

642
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,000
Zari Tomaz is not one of your own.

643
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,160
<i>Either way, we're not gonna let you,
A.R.G.U.S., or anyone else</i>

644
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,600
<i>put her behind bars for who she is.</i>

645
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,920
So you'd rather kill
your team and mine?

646
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,480
<i>Collision in ten seconds, Captain.</i>

647
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,120
<i>Last chance, Ms. Lance!</i>

648
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,800
Sara, this is madness!

649
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,040
Change your course!

650
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,040
I'm good.

651
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,800
<i>Impact in three, two, one.</i>

652
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,840
Are we dead?

653
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,080
Did... did we die?

654
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,080
<i>The Time Bureau vessel jumped away.</i>

655
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,880
Gideon, make sure
they're not following us.

656
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,520
Professor, you all right?

657
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,760
Nothing that a cup of tea won't fix.

658
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,200
One cup of Lyoga root tea
for the professor coming up,

659
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,520
'cause you're my best friend!

660
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,480
What made you change your mind?

661
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,360
Thought about what my brother
would want me to do.

662
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,480
Weren't your friends supposed
to be coming to rescue us?

663
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,640
Good point.

664
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,040
You had your chance.

665
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,560
I was willing to offer you
a compromise.

666
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,120
But now I have to kill you.

667
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,880
I'm afraid we can't let you do that!

668
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,080
If anyone's gonna kill Haircut,
it's me, lady.

669
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,640
- Thanks, Mick.
- Pleasure.

670
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,160
You think you could stop me?

671
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,960
Trust in it.

672
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,000
What are you doing?

673
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,080
Trusting it.

674
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,120
How?

675
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,280
Stay down.

676
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,880
I can do this all day.

677
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,960
I would kill you.

678
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,480
But I'd just be killing myself.

679
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,920
All right, Gideon.
How are we doing?

680
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,680
<i>Our time jump from Jannah
remained undetected, Captain.</i>

681
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,480
<i>I think we can safely say
our Time Bureau problem is...</i>

682
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,920
<i>Oh, bollocks.</i>

683
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,920
<i>- Perhaps I spoke too soon.</i>
- What is it?

684
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,480
<i>Incoming transmission
from Agent Sharpe.</i>

685
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,520
Put her on.

686
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,480
Oh. Hey, Ava.

687
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,800
How was your day?

688
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,520
<i>You do realize that
that little stunt of yours</i>

689
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,880
<i>could've destroyed us both.</i>

690
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,720
You tried to kill us first.

691
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,200
<i>No, I tried to warn you first.</i>

692
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,840
<i>But you don't take warnings, do you?</i>

693
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,600
Now you're starting to get it.

694
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,520
<i>Well, this isn't a warning.
It's a promise.</i>

695
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,360
<i>If I ever track you down again,</i>

696
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,560
<i>you and your band of idiots
will be exiled to the dawn of time.</i>

697
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,360
<i>Whatever leniency
Hunter gave you is over.</i>

698
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,240
<i>What a bitch.</i>

699
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,640
You took the words right out
of my mouth, Gideon.

700
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,880
Plot a course to 2042.

701
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,760
Hey, how do you feel?

702
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,440
Yeah, much better.

703
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,520
And you?

704
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,960
I thought the hangover
I got drinking with P.T. Barnum

705
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,600
was bad, oof.

706
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,840
Hey, I wanted to thank you.

707
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,240
I've gotten a handle
on my totem again.

708
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,280
That's great.

709
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,560
You can at least try not
to sound so disappointed.

710
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,360
It's cool.

711
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,560
I just thought you were staying
on the ship

712
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,920
because your totem was out of whack,
and now that it's back in whack...

713
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,040
I can't go.

714
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,880
This whole experience
has made me realize

715
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,280
that my fate is entwined
with someone else's.

716
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,160
Zari's.

717
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,080
Well...

718
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,640
Sara said we're dropping her
back off in 2042.

719
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,280
{\an5}We could've dropped you off anywhere.

720
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,360
Why this dump?

721
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,960
With Jannah gone, this is home.

722
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,240
Oh. Well, you got a lot
of heat on you.

723
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,440
I can handle heat.

724
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,640
Thanks.

725
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,720
Wait!

726
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,000
It's not safe for you here.

727
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,520
There's no reason to suggest
that sorceress won't return for you.

728
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,920
Well, it's not like
I have any other options.

729
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,280
That amulet, it's not an amulet.

730
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,440
It's a totem, like mine.

731
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,160
We're bound together somehow...

732
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,240
in a way that I have yet
to understand.

733
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,120
Come with us.

734
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,120
That's all nice and weird, but...

735
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,880
Totems, they guide us
in strange ways.

736
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,720
What if yours guided you to us?

737
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,440
What would you rather do?

738
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,800
Hide from A.R.G.U.S. your whole life

739
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,400
or do something really stupid,
like time travel?

740
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,280
I'm not a superhero.

741
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,360
Neither am I.

742
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,520
Good.

743
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,880
You can't pedal forever,
you little nerd!

744
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,120
Come on! Come on!

745
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,240
Where are you, nerd?

746
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,200
I think he went down this way!

747
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,240
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

748
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,880
He went down here! Down here!

749
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,960
Hello?

750
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,680
Hi, what's your name?

751
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,080
Mine's Ray Palmer.
