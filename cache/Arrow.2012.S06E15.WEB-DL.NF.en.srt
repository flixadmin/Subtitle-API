[Oliver] <i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:03,503
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:06,923
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,467
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

5
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,928
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

6
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:13,888
<i>But by night, I'm someone else.</i>

7
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:16,349
<i>I am something else.</i>

8
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,435
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,228
[Oliver] <i>Previously on</i>Arrow...

10
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,397
The new police captain,
she's on my payroll,

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,357
<i>along with a few other city officials.</i>

12
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,609
<i>See, guys like you never understand.</i>

13
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,446
<i>Why destroy a city,
when you could take it over?</i>

14
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,908
Mr. Ramirez suffered
a traumatic hemothorax.

15
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,660
The injury caused his lung to recollapse.

16
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,328
Oliver Queen, you're under arrest.

17
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,663
On what charges?

18
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,082
Murder, assault, burglary, and kidnapping,

19
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,501
all stemming from your activity
as the Green Arrow.

20
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,627
I think I just found something.

21
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,296
There's a record on how Watson
found out you were Wild Dog.

22
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,464
There's an audio recording.

23
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:51,092
The FBI's provided definitive proof
that Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow.

24
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,677
I'm gonna release
the defendant on bail.

25
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,638
What's your name?

26
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,724
Laurel Lance.

27
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,647
-Ollie.
-Yeah.

28
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,442
Jean here has some good news for you.

29
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,694
I'm only used to good news
if it's accompanied by bad news.

30
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,322
[Jean] Well,
this news is unequivocal, Oliver.

31
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,741
I can get the case
against you dismissed.

32
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:16,785
Uh...

33
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,120
Have a seat. Tell me more.

34
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:22,582
I pored over the discovery documents
produced by the district attorney.

35
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:27,295
Apparently, the FBI leveraged
Rene Ramirez to testify against you

36
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:30,256
based on surveillance that was leaked
by a known criminal.

37
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,382
Cayden James.

38
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,092
[Jean] "Fruit of the poisonous tree."

39
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,094
It's a legal metaphor positing that

40
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:38,264
if the source of the evidence is tainted,
the evidence itself is tainted.

41
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,309
Mr. James' actions were not only illegal,

42
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,769
but his death makes it impossible

43
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,854
to corroborate the evidence
against Mr. Ramirez.

44
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,273
So, if there's no case against Rene,
there's no case against me.

45
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,817
We're going before Judge McGarvey

46
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,735
on my motion to dismiss this afternoon.

47
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,028
Jean, you sure?

48
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,489
You can just make this go away?

49
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,282
Ollie, she's positive.

50
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,618
Okay, I know you're not used
to getting good news,

51
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,745
but this is what it sounds like.

52
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,374
[door opens]

53
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:08,169
Mr. Mayor, we got an emergency at SCPD.

54
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,463
Like I said, it was accompanied
by some bad news.

55
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,881
Jean, this is wonderful.

56
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,299
I will see you at the courthouse
this afternoon.

57
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,384
Okay.

58
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,678
So?

59
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,721
Laurel just walked into
police headquarters.

60
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,723
-What, to surrender?
-[Quentin] Not exactly.

61
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,600
She told them she's Laurel Lance.

62
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,686
Our Laurel Lance.

63
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,190
Okay, why is she claiming
to be Laurel Lance?

64
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,193
Well, Dinah is out for blood,
and Laurel Lance, public figure,

65
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,488
is a much more difficult target
than Black Siren.

66
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,365
Except it's a lie.

67
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,201
It's all one big lie.

68
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,745
We need to get to her
before she gets to the press.

69
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,622
I woke up in a cell

70
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,584
and I managed to break down the door,

71
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,711
and I just... I ran.

72
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,212
They held you for two years?

73
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,672
I don't remember.

74
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,133
{\an8}<i>They kept me drugged.</i>

reported dead, killed in a prison riot.</i>

{\an8}[Laurel]<i>Damien Darhk, he stabbed me.</i>

77
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:02,015
{\an8}<i>And the next thing I knew, I was...</i>

78
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,683
{\an8}<i>I was in that cell.</i>

79
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,727
{\an8}I don't know how,
but this is really, really bad.

80
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,228
Rather, we should have seen this coming.

81
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,689
Should've known that she'd eventually
try to pull something like this.

82
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,232
Why would Damien Darhk do this to you?

83
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,567
[reporter 2] Why would he fake your death?

84
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,194
I don't know why
he would wanna fake my death.

85
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,531
Maybe... Maybe to torture
the Green Arrow?

86
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,909
[reporter 3] So,
you know who the Green Arrow is?

87
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,870
Ollie! Ollie!

88
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,040

-Daddy.
-[reporter 1] Can you tell us any more

92
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,217
information on...

93
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,843
[Reporter 2] You notably
outed Miss. Lance

94
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,553
as the Black Canary at her funeral.

95
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,013
And now it seems a little suspicious

96
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,474
in light of the recent allegations
that you are the Green Arrow.

97
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,309
It doesn't and it's not.

98
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,104
I have made no secret of the fact
that when necessary,

99
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,691
I have been in contact
with Green Arrow and his team.

100
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,069
He told me about Laurel Lance.

101
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,445
I wasn't talking to myself.

102
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,696
[reporter 3] Is that true, Miss Lance?

103
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,157
[Reporter 4] Miss Lance, is Oliver Queen
the Green Arrow?

104
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,789
I really do think that Miss Lance

105
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,625
could use some time with her family
and some privacy.

106
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,126
Let's go.

107

110
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,855
{\an8}You said you wanted me
to be more like Laurel,

111
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,107
{\an8}so I thought I'd give it a try.

112
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,150
{\an8}Oh, I really wish I'd believe that.

113
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,945
{\an8}Where's the money you stole from the city?

114
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,906
{\an8}Yeah... About that, slight hiccup.

115
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,492
{\an8}So, I went to where I stashed it,

116
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,369
{\an8}and it's been cleaned out.

117

It's gone. Poof.

118
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,206
So, without the money you, what,

119
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,292
decided to become Laurel Lance,

120
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,044
'cause she's a public figure
and harder to kill?

121
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,798
{\an8}You're really that afraid
of Dinah Drake, aren't you?

122
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,258
Not just afraid of Dinah.

123
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,887
Afraid of whoever manipulated Cayden James
into thinking I killed his son.

124
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,307
'Cause that's probably
who killed James, too.

{\an8}I mean, she could've
just easily killed both of them.

{\an8}I don't exactly have
an airtight alibi for Cayden.

{\an8}I believe his son was killed

but payday is Friday.

158
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,367
{\an8}And my officers
aren't gonna get their checks.

159
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,036
Captain Hill, I'm still working
on recovering the money that was extorted.

160
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,664
And I have an idea to buy us time
that I wanted to run past you.

161
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,790
Let's hear it.

162
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,209
The department has
years of seized assets.

163
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,794
Sports cars, mansions,

164
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,796
{\an8}even a stuffed polar bear,
if you can believe it.

165
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,132
{\an8}-Mmm-hmm.
-At least two-thirds of the property

166
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,967
{\an8}has cleared the court process for sale.

167
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,470
{\an8}If we auction it off,
we can raise as much as $30 million.

168
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,555
{\an8}Thirty?

169
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,307
{\an8}Set that in motion.

170
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,435
{\an8}Thank you.

171
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,605
{\an8}-Hello.
-Don't talk to me.

172
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,774
{\an8}Captain Hill,
can I talk to you for a minute?

173
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,985
{\an8}-It's about Laurel Lance.
-That's a hell of a thing, isn't it?

174
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,278
{\an8}She said they faked her death

175
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,447
{\an8}and then she was
held captive for two years.

176
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,323
{\an8}Yeah, sure is.

177
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,117
{\an8}Uh, anyone catch that case yet?

178
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,618
You want it? It's yours.

179
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,371
But right now, she's going
to the hospital for a GSW.

180
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,456
I'm patient.

181
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,503
{\an8}[knock at door]

182
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,674
{\an8}-C-Dog.
-Hey, Zoe.

183
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,343
{\an8}Great. Love that that name's
sticking around. That's amazing.

184
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,388
{\an8}The babysitter had to go home
two hours ago.

185
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,556
{\an8}Where's my dad?

186
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,349
Have a seat.

187
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,020
Something happened.

188
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,980
He's gonna be okay,

189
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,024
but I need to tell you about it.

190
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,403
[Jean] This is inappropriate.

191
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,864
My motion should be heard
in open court.

192
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,449
I requested to be heard in chambers.

193
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,160
Oh, to what, hide the embarrassment
of having your case dismissed?

194
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,662
Actually we're taking Mr. Ramirez
off our witness list.

195
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,624
Considering he was your sole witness
against Mr. Queen,

196
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,460
-I renew my motion to have...
-He's not our sole witness.

197
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,463
What? No, no, no, no.
Discovery on this case is closed.

198
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,423
[Armand] This is newly-discovered
information, Your Honor.

199
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,717
We'll make the witness' proffer
available to the defense,

200
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,135
in accordance with <i>Brady v. Marilyn.</i>

201
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,345
Who is the witness?

202
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,472
Someone with enemies
on both sides of the law.

203
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,265
That's why we're doing this in chambers

204
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,476
and why I granted
the district attorney's request

205
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,602
for a suppression order.

206
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,980
All right, I get it, it's sensitive.
What is the witness' name?

207
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,107
Roy Harper.

208
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,907
How did they even find Roy?

209
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,367
I mean, we didn't know where he was.

210
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,910
We didn't even know
what name he was working under.

211
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,286
I didn't think anybody did.

212
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,830
-Did you?
-No. No...

213
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,542
God, I couldn't even find him
for your guys' wedding reception.

214
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,418
[John] It doesn't matter
how they did it. They did.

215
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,795
Now we have to figure out what to do next.

216
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,588
He's definitely not
cooperating voluntarily.

217
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,798
Well, it's been two years.

218
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,591
I mean, there might be some
pressure points we don't know about,

219
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,218
some people he cares about, some...

220
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,304
-It's been a long time.
-[Oliver] Either way,

221
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,765
we need to know
what Roy is going to say in court,

222
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,685
which means we need to know
where he is right now.

223
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,936
[John] Oliver, he's a state witness.

224
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,188
I know our whole thing is extralegal,

225
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,440
but maybe we should let
your lawyer deal with this.

226
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,068
The DA's office does not have
the capabilities of finding Roy.

227
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,530
Which means,
this was either Diaz or Anatoly.

228
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,115
You think whoever's
pulling the strings on this

229
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,199
is still tugging them?

230
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,451
Well, if you're in the mood
for some witness tampering,

231
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,495
I think I have a line
on where the DA is holding Roy.

232
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,914
They rented out several rooms in
the top floor of a hotel downtown.

233
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,292
Hotel. Easily guarded position
with lots of civilians,

234
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,295
we break in, get spotted, Oliver,
we make their case for them.

235
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,798
Guys, if Ollie is right, and Roy
is in trouble with Diaz or Anatoly,

236
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,134
we need to be protecting him.

237
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,846
So we wait until dark to do recon.

238
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,391
And then find possible points of entry.

239
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,687
No exertion or sudden movements.

240
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,314
Don't wanna risk reopening the wound.

241
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,233
[Quentin clearing throat]

242
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,902
Hey, uh, could you...
Could you give us a minute please?

243
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:14,989
[sighs]

244
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,199
What, is Mom coming
to visit or something?

245
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,785
[sighing] Okay, firstly,
she's not your mom.

246
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,037
And second, no.

247
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,331
I called her right after your
little performance for the cameras

248
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,416
and told her to hold off a bit
while I checked you out.

249
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,752
That poor woman has been burned
enough by this sort of thing.

250
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,505
More of Laurel's stuff.

251
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,300
You know, I was just getting used
to the last outfit.

252
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,843
Well, Forensics has that one.

253
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:39,013
Anyway, you wanna pass
for the real Laurel,

254
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,890
you better get used to her style.

255
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,225
You call this "style"?

256
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,979
Look, are you here just to make sure
my health insurance is up to date,

257
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,564
or are you here to protect me from her?

258
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,861
Just get dressed.

259
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,786
Hey.

260
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,082
Laurel Lance, she died in this hospital.

261
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,459
I pronounced her. There was an autopsy.

262
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,420
Of course, I've seen my share of things

263
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,672
I once would've considered miraculous.

264
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:17,259
I mean, in a world where a man
can run faster than light,

265
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,886
I suppose anything's possible.

266
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:22,056
That's why I need to rule out the chance
that this person could be an impostor.

267
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,599
The DNA test will tell us that.

268
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,227
Excuse me.

269
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,524
-Hey.
-Hey.

270
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,526
Look, I know what you're
doing here, all right?

271
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,486
You're going after Laurel 'cause
of what happened to your friend,

272
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,654
and I get that, okay?

273
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,615
It's what I would do
if someone I loved was dead.

274
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:42,034
You mean it's just what you'd do
with a criminal, Quentin,

275
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,661
which, by the way, is what she is.

276
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,413
Yeah, but you and I both know that,

277
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,374
but, you know, she's turned herself
into a beloved public figure.

278
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,170
She's also said that she's got
no compunctions about outing Oliver.

279
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,298
I don't think she'll stop with him.

280
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,218
-So you're doing this for my sake?
-For all of our sakes.

281
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,679
I've been making progress with her, Dinah.

282
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,722
Okay? I'm not finished.

283
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,683
But if she lives as my Laurel...

284
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,352
She's not your Laurel.

285
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:12,106
Your Laurel wouldn't have murdered
Vince or anyone else.

286
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,274
She did.

287
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:16,360
And you are delusional
if you think you can change her.

288
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,447
No. I'm telling you,
I've been changing her, okay?

289
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,908
All I'm asking for you
is just a chance. Please?

290
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,288
What's taking her so long?

291
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,963
-Where'd she go?
-[nurse] The police officer took her.

292
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,756
Said something about a safe house.

293
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,800
No, no. I am the lead detective
on this case.

294
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,392
-You did this.
-What are you talking about?

295
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,436
I wanna know
where she is, too, you know.

296
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:52,897
[sighs]

297
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,321
Is my father not coming?

298
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,744
-Where are you taking me?
-To see Mr. Diaz.

299
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,163
[car starting]

300
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,965
[Green Arrow] I'm guessing Roy's
in the room with the police outside?

301
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,303
Yeah. Eating the wrong end
of a phone book.

302
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,056
[sighs] It's risky terrain.

303
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,974
You just told me he's getting beaten on.

304
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,851
You're still not sure we should do this?

305
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,645
Two-man team on the balcony.

306
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,730
[John] If we can get past them,
that's our best bet.

307
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:38,067
John, he's in there 'cause of me.
He's been on the run for three years.

308
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,360
Oliver, that's his choice.

309
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,946
I know that,
but did I learn anything from it?

310
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,656
Roy put on the hood.

311
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,992
He sacrificed himself for me.

312
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,744
And I asked you to do the same thing,

313
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:51,539
at the expense of your safety
and your family.

314
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,291
Difference was,
I wanted to put on the hood.

315
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,878
Oliver, listen, I've been good
for the past two months, good.

316
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,505
But instead of giving me back the hood,

317
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,048
you've had Cisco make me a new suit.

318
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:04,426
There it is. It's a 15-second opening.
That is our window.

319
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,642
[door opens]

320
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,484
We got it from here.

321
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,903
Head back to SCPD before you're missed.

322
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,613
[Anatoly] Laurel.

323
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,240
[speaking Russian]

324
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,326
Is it Laurel or "Laurel" these days?

325
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,787
So confusing, this doppelganger business.

326
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,998
But you seem to have figured it out.

327
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,541
Diaz killed Cayden.

328
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,084
He told me.

329
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,503
No honor among thieves.

330
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,297
Or crime lords, I guess.

331
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,090
Well...

332
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,510
Diaz manipulated the both of us,
lied to the both of us.

333
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,388
This whole time, he's had his own agenda.
That doesn't bother you?

334
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,015
I'm not sentimental.

335
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,017
I am Russian.

336
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,686
I'm in the city for two reasons only.

337
00:14:56,145 --> 00:15:00,316
One is revenge against Oliver Queen,

338
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,151
and two is money.

339
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,404
I'm happy to work
with whoever can get me either.

340
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,240
You're in the city
because the Bratva cast you out.

341
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,784
Well, there's that, too.

342
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,665
There is a 15-second window

343
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,584
where neither roof guard
is watching the HVAC vent.

344
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,668
We can get in that way.

345
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,545
All right, well, did you see him,
is he okay?

346
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,215
-We can get him out.
-I know. And I'm coming with you.

347
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,594
I thought you didn't do this anymore.

348
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,803
Ollie, it's Roy.

349
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,472
Right, but, Thea, you shouldn't do this.

350
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,849
And I understand
it's hypocritical pointing out

351
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,893
that you have a personal involvement.

352
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,144
Doesn't make me wrong.

353
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,023
More importantly,
you have not been field-ready

354
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,399
since you got out of your coma.

355
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,276
I'll be fine. Okay?

356
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,278
And did you guys even measure the vents?

357
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,281
Because you should be asking
if I'm the right size to fit through them.

358
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,616
Don't think either of you two can.

359
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,993
Where are you guys keeping my suit?

360
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,164
You okay?

361
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,749
It's just like riding a bike.

362
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,584
It really isn't.

363
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,003
I can buy you a few extra seconds.

364
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,339
I'm ready.

365
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,423
All right.

366
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,847
What's that for?

367
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,766
There's not a home game tonight, is there?

368
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,082
[grunts]

369
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,627
[officer] You wanna keep going,
or are you gonna testify?

370
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,005
I'm not a lawyer,

371
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,550
but I'm pretty sure torturing your witness
isn't gonna be great for your case.

372
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,178
You don't think we know how to
put you in a world of hurt

373
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,680
without leaving a mark?

374
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,394
No.

375
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,229
[groaning]

376
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,529
Are you getting this?

377
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,740
I'm enhancing their badge numbers.

378
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,534
{\an8}Just when you thought Oliver took down
all the crooked cops last year.

379
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,244
I'm going in.

380
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,121
[Felicity] <i>I wouldn't.
They got six more guys in the hall.</i>

381
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,207
Stand down.
I know it's hard, but you have to wait.

382
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,625
[Roy grunts]

383
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,587
[groaning, coughing]

384
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,048
I'm working up an appetite here.

385
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,508
Hey.

386
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,677
We're gonna get some Big Belly Burger.

387
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,346
You decide to play nice,
I might give you the fries.

388
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:51,987
Is that my hood?

389
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,615
It looks good on you.

390
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,334
I'm sorry if you're seeing someone.

391
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,919
I'm not. I didn't take your advice.

392
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:10,172
No kids, no wife,
and I really, really hate minivans.

393
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,634
How did they find you?

394
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,219
I was in St. Roch,

395
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:19,139
and the Star City cops, they tased me,
and they threw me in the back of a van.

396
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,100
They knew everything,
they knew about Oliver,

397
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,352
they knew about me faking my death,
they knew it all.

398
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,937
SCPD SWAT incoming.

399
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,439
Speedy, you wanna get out of there now.

400
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,690
Speedy, move.

401
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,486
Okay, we're leaving.

402
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,154
No, you're leaving.

403
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,864
I'm in no shape to be swinging
from the rooftops.

404
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,574
I'm not leaving without you.

405
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,078
-They're coming in hot.
-You gotta go right now.

406
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,621
Damn it, Speedy, get out of there!

407
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,705
I'm getting you out of here.

408
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,250
-No, you can't. You have to go.
-No.

409
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,501
I'm not leaving you.

410
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,461
[Green Arrow] <i>Speedy, they're right
outside the door!</i>

411
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,381
I'm not losing you again.

412
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,675
Just go sit.

413
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:55,926
Thea.

414
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,147
What the hell do you think you're doing?

415
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,356
I needed some air.

416
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,775
You're gonna need air.

417
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,738
-What the hell did you just do?
-I just saved your life.

418
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,449
There's too many of them in there.
They would have killed you both.

419
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,826
Look...

420
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,662
We will get Roy back.

421
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,372
I am promising you,

422
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,166
we will get him back.

423
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:38,177
They're really circling the wagons now.
They've upped security tenfold.

424
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,553
He was bleeding internally,

425
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,722
so if we don't get to him soon,
they're going to kill him.

426
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:45,100
They will not, because they need him
alive to testify against me.

427
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,685
Not "they." Diaz.

428
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,395
I pulled financials
on both the police officers

429
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,479
that were torturing Roy.

430
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,523
They both receive generous
dividend payments

431
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,942
from stocks of a Corto Maltese-based
shell corporation.

432
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,736
They financed the company
that was manufacturing

433
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,487
the drug I used to treat my injury.

434
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,032
Ricardo Diaz's company.

435
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,075
Both officers were on duty
when Cayden James was killed,

436
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,410
and all the officers
that were there tonight,

437
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,204
we have reason to believe
they're working with Diaz, too.

438
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,040
So Diaz has been playing us
since the beginning.

439
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,917
Or he's just been playing you.

440
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,174
She's upset. She's worried about Roy.

441
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,634
Yeah, so am I.

442
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,682
-I had to pull you out of there.
-No, you could've come in.

443
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,434
I come in there, and it's you and me

444
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,686
against a SWAT team, in a tight space,

445
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,230
nobody comes out of there.

446
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,940
Especially not Roy.

447
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,735
You know, there are times

448
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:42,157
when I feel like my life
completely fell apart when Roy left.

449
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:46,578
From my bloodlust,
to Malcolm, to the coma...

450
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:51,458
Knowing he was out there,
that he was okay,

451
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,670
it made my life just a little bit easier.

452
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,507
Ever since Mom died,
I haven't known much of anything

453
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,510
other than the fact
that I want to make sure he is safe.

454
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,304
And I will do whatever it takes
to make sure that happens.

455
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,806
We all will, Speedy.

456
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,267
[John] Felicity may have just
found something.

457
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,270
SCPD just requisitioned
a transport prisoner van.

458
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,022
They're moving Roy to a new safe house.
We just don't know when.

459
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,148
That's it.

460
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,401
That's when we get him.

461
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:18,986
There's something else.

462
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,572
[Dinah Drake] No, no, no, no, okay.

463
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,741
You know what, who can tell me
where Laurel Lance is?

464
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,993
Can you tell me that?

465
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,328
And when will he be available?

466
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,082
No, no, no, no.
No, thank you. I'll call back.

467
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,668
I swear, this isn't me, okay?

468
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,503
I need to speak with you.

469
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:38,880
You too.

470
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,935
Turn the cameras off.

471
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:54,938
[clicks]

472
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,193
Cayden James was murdered right there.

473
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,070
By Ricardo Diaz.

474
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:06,033
-Oh, my God.
-And it was covered up by the SCPD.

475
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,411
I thought Cayden James
was killed by another inmate

476
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,163
when he was transferred to Iron Heights.

477
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,956
Felicity found out what actually happened.

478
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,375
Never made it to Iron Heights.

479
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,545
The cops on duty are on Diaz's payroll.

480
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,422
They faked the transfer.

481
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,590
Doing that would take...

482
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,760
A systemic breach
of the police department.

483
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,970
Worse than last year's corruption.

484
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,555
I didn't think that was even possible.

485
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,806
Neither did I.

486
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:33,435
Dinah, I know that
you don't believe in me right now,

487
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,729
and I know the two of you
don't trust each other,

488
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:36,813
for good reason,

489
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:40,567
but the both of you believe in the badge.

490
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:44,404
I need you working together,
I need to know how deep this goes.

491
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:48,075
I need to know who in that room
we can trust.

492
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,994
Which means you gotta
put your vendetta on hold.

493
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,499
Okay.

494
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,250
[Quentin] We can work it out at my place.

495
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,711
The walls here have got ears.

496
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,630
And this is why I couldn't find Laurel.

497
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,465
'Cause those bent cops sprung her.

498
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,383
Or they took her someplace worse.

499
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,847
Diaz's feelings were so hurt
when you tried to run.

500
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,892
It's as if you don't
trust him or something.

501
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,019
I'm still trying to figure out why you do.

502
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,438
For me, it's more a matter
of money than trust.

503
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,482
Either way, Diaz better.

504
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,527
Why blow up city
when you can control it, yes?

505
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,945
[grunting]

506
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,017
You're as good as they said you were.

507
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,814
Do you know that fighting for trophies

508
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,859
is not the same as fighting for your life?

509
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,070
Break you of your bad habits.

510
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,950
Welcome to the team.

511
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,955
That's a lot of money
for a man with bad foot.

512
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:21,084
I didn't break it,
I just had to break him.

513
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,676
Building a family, Anatoly.

514
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,595
Family.

515
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,557
Isn't that what "Bratva" means?

516
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,809
-"Brotherhood"?
<i>-Da.</i>

517
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,812
See, family,

518
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,273
they rely on one another.

519
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,526
Family trust each other.

520
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:51,781
See, when a family does well,
each member prospers.

521
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,784
But if just one person

522
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,663
betrays their family...

523
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,835
Give us the room!

524
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,003
Move!

525
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,923
[speaking Russian]

526
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,596
The money that you stole from Cayden

527
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,516
was also my money.

528
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,561
I earned it, just like you.

529
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,064
Except I didn't take more than my share.

530
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:27,525
Well, you've got it all back, obviously.
So why am I here?

531
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,694
It's 'cause our business is not concluded.

532
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,614
You might have convinced Anatoly that
you're worth staying in bed with,

533
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,325
but I have a psycho vigilante
coming after me.

534
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,618
[Diaz] Dinah Drake.

535
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,703
Mmm?

536
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,121
I see it all.

537
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,959
I know it all. I control it all.

538
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,294
I've been working on this for months.

539
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:50,715
See, Cayden, he's just a small piece
of a much larger puzzle.

540
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,927
And so are you.

541
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,512
I just wanna
get the hell out of this city.

542
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,013
Where you wanna go?

543
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,057
Hmm?

544
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,017
-Do what?
-Live.

545
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,688
Without always having to look
over my shoulder.

546
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,402
I don't want you
to worry about Dinah Drake.

547
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,571
I don't want you
to worry about Oliver Queen

548
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,407
or any of those chumps

549
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:18,493
who can't see two inches past their face.

550
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:23,331
Anatoly said that you had a plan
to take control of the city.

551
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,667
Now, isn't that something...

552
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,257
Worth staying in bed for?

553
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,222
I don't know, Felicity.

554
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,560
Maybe it's a little soon, bringing up
taking back the mantle from Oliver,

555
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,811
but it's been two months.

556
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,479
A hell of a two months, though.

557
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,481
And Oliver's just not ready to step down,

558
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,525
not with everything that's going on.
It's too much.

559
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:52,527
It's crazy what's...

560
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,447
They're moving Roy in 10 minutes.

561
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,123
[tires screeching]

562
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,210
Don't move.

563
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,213
Roy, back away from the door.

564
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,181
It's a decoy.

565
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,933
They faked Cayden James' transfer,
they faked this one, too.

566
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,602
So where is Roy?

567
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,567
Mr. Harper. Good to meet you.

568
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,410
You said they were moving him.

569
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,079
Yeah, they must have put Roy
into a different vehicle

570
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,914
when they were in the underground
and I didn't have eyes on them.

571
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,249
Which means he could have been
picked up at any point last night.

572
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,876
How many cars left the hotel
in that time frame?

573
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,086
Nearly 300.

574
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,671
I'm tracking license-plate numbers,
but it's gonna take some time.

575
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,549
If it takes more than an hour,
I'm gonna start breaking fingers.

576
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,343
There's that Queen temper.

577
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:01,721
I'll contact Lyla, see if A.R.G.U.S.
can help with finding Roy.

578
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,102
How are you holding up?

579
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,187
-I've been better.
-Yeah, I know.

580
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,564
It's because you're blaming yourself
for Roy's situation

581
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,900
instead of accurately
blaming Ricardo Diaz.

582
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,902
Well, Roy wouldn't be in this situation

583
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,530
if he didn't fall on his sword
for me three years ago.

584
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,281
That was his choice, Oliver.

585
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,784
And I believed then
and I still believe it was the right one.

586
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:26,162
I'm worried that I didn't
rescue him from that hotel room

587
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,372
'cause I wouldn't have been able

588
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,624
to bear the responsibility
if things went bad.

589
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,084
You didn't go into that hotel room

590
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,878
because your gut told you
things would go bad.

591
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,505
And that gut's kept you alive
for 11 years

592
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:36,923
and it kept Roy alive last night.

593
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,883
Maybe. How do I know?

594
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,511
I could ask Cisco
to find a parallel universe

595
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:42,595
in which you did.

596
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,389
But in the meantime,
if you could just stop

597
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:48,393
finding ways to blame yourself,
that would be so great.

598
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,355
-Is that what I'm doing?
-That's what you're always doing.

599
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:53,940
Maybe you have a point.

600
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:54,941
Hmm?

601
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,901
Last night, John basically asked me

602
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,987
why I haven't given him the hood back.

603
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,280
Yeah, I know, he told me.

604
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,532
I told him you probably just thought
it wasn't the right time.

605
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,200
Am I on the money?

606
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,703
I don't know.

607
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,377
You have a strength
one doesn't see much.

608
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,008
You wanna join my team?

609
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,426
Sure.

610
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,344
Do you offer medical and dental?

611
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,308
You know, my police friends are
telling me you're not cooperating.

612
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,102
You're not playing ball.

613
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,396
You won't testify against Queen?

614
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,190
If you actually think
that I would do that,

615
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,733
then you're an idiot.

616
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,235
[chuckles] One of us is.

617
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:42,864
See, but I'm not the type of guy
that believes giving a beating

618
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,118
is the only way

619
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,078
to cause some pain.

620
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,502
How's Speedy?

621
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,089
She came out of retirement.

622
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,217
Why would she do that?

623
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:06,387
Why the hell would Queen
let his baby sister

624
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,973
dress up like Will Scarlet?

625
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,893
All right, I gotta ask.

626
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,938
That's a moot point.

627
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,693
You see, the real question is,

628
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,866
who do I gotta bring the pain to?

629
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,119
Do I gotta bring it to you?

630
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,999
Or her?

631
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,593
Shift sergeant was definitely
in on it. Look at this.

632
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,304
[sighs] Diaz has got his fingers in deep.

633
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,306
Listen.

634
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,100
Thanks for doing this, all right?

635
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,811
-Backing off Laurel.
-It's temporary.

636
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,021
Until we can get the department
back under control.

637
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,273
[knock at door]

638
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:04,779
Hi, Daddy.

639
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,115
-Hi.
-Speak of the devil.

640
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,993
-Can I talk to you?
-Yeah.

641
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,286
I've got a lot I'd like to say.

642
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,538
Can we not do the whole screaming thing,

643
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,831
because the only thing that's gonna happen

644
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,875
is my father's gonna have to
renovate his apartment.

645
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,878
Plus, I'm here about Ricardo Diaz.

646
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,759
I'd ask how you're doing, but...

647
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,973
Felicity and A.R.G.U.S.
are working on locating Roy.

648
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,896
You know, it's been a while
since I offered you

649
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,814
a little big-brother advice.

650
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,525
Do you mind?

651
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,654
This should be good.

652
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,283
When we find Roy... Not if, but when

653
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,869
we find Roy,

654
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,206
I think maybe you should go with him.

655
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,503
-Where?
-Wherever he's going.

656
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:07,383
I mean, Thea, I'd miss you like crazy,

657
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,887
but you said that you haven't
been the same without him.

658
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,473
So maybe you shouldn't be without him.

659
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:17,685
-You really think I should go?
-I don't want you to go, obviously.

660
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:23,399
But you've seen what... What having
Felicity in my life has done for me.

661
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:27,111
You deserve that same
kind of happiness, Speedy.

662
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,656
Wherever it is.

663
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,325
[John] Got news.

664
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,327
-Location on Roy?
-[John] Laurel.

665
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,413
She showed up at Lance's apartment
with intel on Ricardo Diaz.

666
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,675
He has some plan to take over the city,

667
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,386
whatever that means.
I don't exactly have details.

668
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,681
No, he just let you leave
after you stole all that money.

669
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,601
Let you come over here
and tell us all of this.

670
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,104
Well, I'm rather charming.
Don't you think?

671
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,814
So where's Roy?

672
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,317
They had him brought
to some rundown casino.

673
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,528
I heard some guys talking about it
on my way out.

674
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:11,280
-I can take you there.
-So Diaz can take these guys out?

675
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,865
Is that part of the plan?

676
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:16,202
Look, we really don't have a choice, okay?
We need to take this chance.

677
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:19,497
All right, why are you doing this?
Going against Diaz?

678
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,209
Because it occurred to me
that if I'm gonna be Laurel,

679
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,670
I should probably start acting like it.

680
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,215
[sighs]

681
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,931
Yeah, John. We have a location on Roy.
Let's get ready to move.

682
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,808
All right, fine.

683
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,060
-Just this once.
-No.

684
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,188
You don't trust me. I don't trust you.

685
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,733
So I'd rather be in the field shorthanded.

686
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,121
[Green Arrow] Only two guards.

687
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,081
Diaz clearly wasn't expecting us.

688
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,583
Black Siren didn't warn him.

689
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,876
-Let's go.
-Wait.

690
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,003
If we go in there without
knowing our primary objective,

691
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,129
no one is coming out.

692
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,131
Our primary objective is to get Roy.

693
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,716
What about Diaz? He's in there, too.

694
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,135
And we just found out that he's
the one that's behind everything bad

695
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,721
that's been happening in the city
for the past six months.

696
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,015
So let's get 'em both.

697
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,854
-Overwatch, you in yet?
-[Felicity] <i>Uplinking now.</i>

698
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,731
<i>Huffing and puffing and blowing
all those firewalls down,</i>

699
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:27,815
<i>but before I finish,</i>

700
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,443
if he's a smart guy,
and we know that he is,

701
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,528
this will definitely tip him off
that you're there.

702
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,489
-We need to know where Roy is.
<i>-Copy that.</i>

703
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,115
I pulled the blueprints of the casino
from the city.

704
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,200
I'll guide you through.

705
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,576
<i>Head up the escalator.</i>

706
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:46,250
Three vigilantes, including your
red girlfriend just showed up.

707
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,127
It's time for a change of scenery.

708
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,504
You know what to do.

709
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,224
Four hostiles with full autos
right in front of you.

710
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,577
-Which way?
-According to thermals,

711
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,163
Diaz has Roy
through the door on the north wall.

712
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,504
Unit 545 requesting backup. Shots fired.

713
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,131
Arrows.

714
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,924
Make that, "Arrows fired."

715
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,135
Get away from him!

716
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,763
On the ground. Now!

717
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,811
I love it when you visit me, Mr. Mayor.

718
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,772
I love it even more when you leave.

719
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,192
No kill shots. I need him alive.

720
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,578
Speedy! No!

721
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,329
[grunting]

722
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,004
[grunting]

723
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,390
Ahh!

724
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,748
We have a problem.

725
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:51,209
{\an8}One of Diaz's cops
alerted the legitimate cavalry.

726
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,002
{\an8}The SCPD is headed your way en masse.

727
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,814
So you're just a hired hand?

728
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,775
I used to be Pakhan.

729
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,443
You cost me that.

730
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,695
I've got him. Go help Speedy.

731
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,789
Ugh!

732
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,541
[groaning]

733
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,711
[sirens blaring]

734
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,463
You okay?

735
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,591
Don't move.

736
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,219
Not all those guys are on my payroll.

737
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:44,845
Yet.

738
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:47,014
But even the ones who aren't,

739
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:51,602
they find the anti-vigilante bill
very motivating.

740
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:52,812
Speedy.

741
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,188
Get in the van,

742
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,190
and drive Roy away.

743
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,526
-What about Diaz?
-I got Diaz.

744
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,029
No, you don't.

745
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,615
You know that, right?

746
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,826
If you stay here,

747
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,911
you're gonna get yourself a collar.

748
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:12,832
And it's not like you can
just take me away with you, right?

749
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,667
But you already knew that.

750
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,086
That's why you let your sister drive off.

751
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,672
You made your choice.

752
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:23,759
Freeze!

753
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,814
-How do you feel?
-[grunts]

754
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:39,275
Like I've been beaten within an inch
of my life with a telephone book.

755
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,901
[John] Two broken ribs and a bruised lung.

756
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,486
You have to take it easy
for a few days, Roy.

757
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,905
Well, that's the good part
about being a fugitive.

758
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,365
There's nowhere else I have to be.

759
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,577
How's Anatoly?

760
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,539
SCPD. I had to bail. What about Diaz?

761
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:54,999
Same.

762
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,625
How are Quentin and Dinah doing

763
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,253
with their investigation into the SCPD?

764
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,504
They're working on it.

765
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,840
I'm not a lawyer,
but what are the effects of us

766
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:05,551
having the government's star witness
in our protection instead of theirs?

767
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,303
[Oliver] Not as much as you would think.

768
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:10,514
They'll add witness tampering
and obstruction

769
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,808
to their very long list of charges.

770
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,477
Hmm. Cherry on top.

771
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:17,897
We did it all for Thea.

772
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,026
And for Roy.

773
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,654
I would have done it for any of you guys.

774
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,663
[clears throat]

775
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,958
[sighs] My father's asleep.

776
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,752
I came to see you.

777
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,547
Okay.

778
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,221
[Oliver sighs]

779
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,559
You didn't set us up.

780
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,728
Gee, Ollie, you sound surprised.

781
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,022
So I came by to say thank you.

782
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,191
And yet still unconvinced.

783
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,818
You're not Laurel.

784
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,070
Not our Laurel.

785
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,864
And saying that you are
to a bunch of press...

786
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,660
No. That does not make it so.

787
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,747
You're right. I'm not.

788
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,126
But I'm willing to try.

789
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,712
And I can't make any promises.
I am who I am,

790
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,758
but I'm willing to try if you're
willing to give me the space to.

791
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,386
Well, that sounds fair.

792
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,806
You're staying here?

793
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,224
Quentin, he...

794
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,643
My father offered me his couch.

795
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:42,273
It's pretty on point with the whole
"rescue Laurel Lance" story, so...

796
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,524
Yeah.

797
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,236
I'll be checking in.

798
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,072
Looking forward to it.

799
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,495
[phone vibrates]

800
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,589
Home sweet home.

801
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,174
Nice.

802
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:11,385
For the past three years, I've been
sleeping with the cockroaches.

803
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:17,057
I feel like
I should have been there with you.

804
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,186
Is that too presumptuous or confusing?

805
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,979
I know that last time we saw each other,

806
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,731
I said that we should probably see...

807
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,785
[beeps]

808
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:41,415
Master. I've located
the heir of Ra's al Ghul.
