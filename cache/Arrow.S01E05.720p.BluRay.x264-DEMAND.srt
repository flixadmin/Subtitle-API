1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,169
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,923
For five years, I was stranded on an island
with only one goal.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,920
Survive.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,650
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,167
Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish...

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,607
...to use the list of names he left me...

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,650
...and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,002
To do this, I must become someone else.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,650
I must become something else.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,649
Previously on Arrow:

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,321
Company Mrs. Queen invested in
doesn't exist.

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,165
Tempest purchased a warehouse
in Starling City.

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,931
Could never tell if the playboy thing
was all an act.

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,651
But I guess after a while,
it doesn't really matter.

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,280
He is a vigilante. He's a damn criminal.

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,609
Here's the security footage.
What do you want me to look for?

17
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,724
Anything out of the ordinary.
What is that? Play that again.

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,564
You're under arrest on suspicion...

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,768
- What is going on?
- ...of assault--

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,809
- Are you out of your mind?
- And murder.

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,164
- Dinner.
- Come-- Hey, I've got an idea.

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,288
Why don't you let me shoot that thing...

23
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,411
...and you can go pick up the bloody, dead,
disgusting animal?

24
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,044
- What?
- Try.

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,570
Breathe. Everything breathe.

26
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,530
Breathe. Aim.

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,126
- Fire.
- Yeah.

28
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,449
Aim that tree.

29
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,003
Breathe.

30
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,683
- What does that mean?
- "You will die badly."

31
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,004
Get.

32
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,809
Wait. Wait. You can't leave me here.
Don't do this to me. Please.

33
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,487
Please! I didn't do anything!

34
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,962
- Stay back.
- The police think they know who I am.

35
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,610
They think I'm the vigilante.

36
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,003
The man in the hood,
terrorizing the city's criminals.

37
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,960
They also think they have me trapped.
That I have no way out.

38
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,965
They're only half-right.

39
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,484
- This is a mistake.
- I'll be asking you a few questions.

40
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,644
Standard stuff for the report.
Have you been arrested before?

41
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,605
It's okay, I know the answer to that one.
Plenty of times.

42
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,010
- Like I said, this is a mistake.
- As far as I can tell, the mistake I made...

43
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,721
...was not shooting you down at the docks
when I had the chance.

44
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,930
- I am not who you think I am.
- Oh, you're exactly who I think you are.

45
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,606
You're a menace
who doesn't care about who he hurts.

46
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,162
You're doing it with bows and arrows
instead of trust funds and yachts.

47
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,888
Detective, you hate me. I get it.

48
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,008
But that doesn't make me a vigilante.

49
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,521
No, the security camera footage of you...

50
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,490
...from the Unidac Auction
with the green hood does that.

51
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,484
Again, I ran into the stairwell
once I heard shooting.

52
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,646
I saw a dufﬂe I thought maybe belonged
to the shooter, looked inside and saw...

53
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,410
- ...a hood.
- You took it home?

54
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,927
We can't find it.
What about harassing Adam Hunt?

55
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,208
Happened to take place
across the street...

56
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,408
- ...from your little bash.
- Coincidences.

57
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,164
No. When they pile up like that,
it becomes evidence.

58
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,129
- Parents are here.
- Tell them to wait.

59
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,170
- I wanna see my son.
- I'm in the middle of an interrogation.

60
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,921
Detective, I know you hate my family,
but I had no idea you'd go so far...

61
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,481
...to arrest my son without any grounds.

62
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,927
I have solid grounds,
and I have evidence.

63
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,010
Which you can present
to Queen's attorney when he gets here.

64
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,449
Until then, this interrogation
is over, detective.

65
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,163
Sure. You have 15 minutes.

66
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,765
Detective Lance appears to be
on some personal vendetta.

67
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,809
He is.

68
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,566
He blames me
for the death of his daughter.

69
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,727
He also thinks
that I dress up in a green hood...

70
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,566
...and shoot people with arrows.
- Important thing is not to say anything...

71
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,725
- ...until your attorney gets here.
- Fine. I want Laurel.

72
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,171
Oliver, I don't think your ex-girlfriend
can be counted on to be objective here.

73
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,564
She knows me better than anyone.
She knows that I could never be this guy.

74
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,041
- Walter, you say Lance has a vendetta?
- Yes.

75
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,771
I think Laurel can get him off of it.

76
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,482
He raised her to do the right thing.

77
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,007
That includes representing
an innocent man.

78
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,083
So, Morn...

79
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,161
...please.

80
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,202
Oliver Queen was arrested today
on suspicion of being the vigilante...

81
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,880
...that has been targeting the wealthy
and corrupt.

82
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,003
Laurel.

83
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,845
- Mrs. Queen, what--?
- It's Oliver. Something's happened.

84
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,048
It's been all over the news.

85
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,122
- These charges are ludicrous.
- I know.

86
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,011
- Can I ask you, who's representing him?
- Well, that's why I'm here.

87
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,925
He wants you to represent him.

88
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,327
- Me?
- Yes. I told him it was a bad idea.

89
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,926
But, to be frank, I am desperate.

90
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,203
He says if you don't represent him,
he doesn't want any attorney.

91
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,284
Mrs. Queen,
my father is the arresting officer.

92
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,329
- Yes.
- I don't think it's a good idea...

93
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,126
...for me to represent someone
I've been involved with.

94
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,803
Listen, I am sorry for what your family
is going through--

95
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,042
No. No apologies.

96
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,161
Your idealism, I think, is why my son,
for all his mistakes, is so smitten with you.

97
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,848
Regardless,
it was a bad idea on his part...

98
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,647
...and I am sorry
if I made you feel uncomfortable.

99
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,848
Docket ending 1-9-4-1,
People v. Oliver Queen.

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,923
Murder, aggravated assault...

101
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,165
...assault with intent,
menacing and trespassing.

102
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,568
- Where's your attorney, Mr. Queen?
- I'm representing myself, judge.

103
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,724
I'm not sure that's the wisest course,
Mr. Queen.

104
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,247
I think it is.

105
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,529
- I'm innocent.
- Then we'll consider that your plea.

106
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,206
- Thank you.
- Now, as to bail.

107
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,842
Your Honor, Mr. Queen's family
owns a pair of private jets.

108
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,681
While on the subject of their wealth,
there is virtually no bail amount...

109
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,047
...that could guarantee his presence
at trial.

110
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,331
So then I guess it's a good thing
that the people's case is so circumstantial.

111
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,324
Dinah Laurel Lance. I'd like to file my
appearance on behalf of the defendant.

112
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,888
Mr. Queen's wealth should not deprive him
of the right to be released on bail...

113
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,089
- ...under the presumption of innocence.
- He is a flight risk.

114
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,571
Then minimize the risk.

115
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,601
The defendant is willing submit to home
confinement and electronic monitoring...

116
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,287
...through the wearing of a UKG-45
administrated ankle device.

117
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,805
- No, he wouldn't.
- Sold.

118
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,850
- Your Honor--
- Bail is set at $15 million...

119
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,326
...5 million dollars bond.

120
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,281
Defendant to see Probation
for the fitting of a GPS device.

121
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,246
I knew you couldn't resist saving my ass.

122
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,450
- Gonna make me regret this, aren't you?
- No. It's gonna be like old times.

123
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,281
Fortunately, with the legal case,
there's no way that you're this vigilante.

124
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,569
- I agree.
- He's actually trying to make a difference.

125
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,411
We both know that's not really your style.

126
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,841
Mom, it's not that bad.

127
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,685
Okay, this device has a direct line
into the precinct.

128
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,162
You stay on the property, you're golden.
Any questions?

129
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,130
I'm having a sizable get-together
here tomorrow evening...

130
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,648
...and there is a likely chance
it spills into the outdoor pool.

131
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,243
Pool deck's fine. Step on the grass, they're
sending a team to forcibly subdue you.

132
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,448
- Thank you, officer.
- Of course.

133
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,406
- A sizable get together?
- I am confined for the foreseeable future.

134
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,604
I might as well make the most of it.
Party is gonna be themed.

135
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,041
I'm thinking prison.

136
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,487
Burning Man meets
Shawshank Redemption.

137
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,122
The invite says,
"Come before Oliver Queen gets off."

138
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,041
Maybe a party's not in the best of taste,
considering the circumstances.

139
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,086
Tommy, the circumstances are why
we're having the party in the first place.

140
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,084
I want people to know I'm not worried
about any of this.

141
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,242
Well, that makes one of us.

142
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,563
- Before you start yelling--
- Why yell?

143
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,087
You're defending the man
that killed your sister.

144
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,480
Oliver did not kill Sara.

145
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,483
She wouldn't have been on that boat.

146
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,564
Have you considered the possibility that
that's the reason...

147
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,970
- ...you're trying to make him this menace?
- It is the videotape, the suspicious timing.

148
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,920
- That is the reason.
- This is Oliver Queen we're talking about.

149
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,402
He wrecks fancy cars and he dates models.
He doesn't kill people.

150
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,604
No, he just uses them. Like he used Sara.
And like he used you.

151
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,161
He's only asked you to be his lawyer
to get at me.

152
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,569
No, he asked me to be his lawyer
to get through to you.

153
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,044
You hate the hood and you hate Oliver
and you want them to be the same person.

154
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,728
But Oliver isn't the reason why Sara died
or the reason Mom left.

155
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,405
I don't have to listen to this.

156
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,244
And by the way...

157
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,806
...you're not the only one
who misses them.

158
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,769
Yeah?

159
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,605
Thank you for coming. Shut the door.

160
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,130
Just a matter of time
before the police caught up with you.

161
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,971
- Except they didn't.
- Oliver, they got you on video.

162
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,481
I knew the camera was there,
I knew the police...

163
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,531
...would review the footage and arrest me.
All part of the plan.

164
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,205
So you wanted to get arrested?

165
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,882
I returned to Starling City
and a few days later the vigilante appears.

166
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,361
Somebody
was gonna make the connection.

167
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,648
What part of serving yourself
to the cops...

168
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,763
...will help you avoid going to prison?

169
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,369
- There's more to it.
- There better be...

170
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,761
...because your family is freaking out.

171
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,605
Oliver, your mother and your sister
just got you back...

172
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,286
...and now you're gonna put them
through a trial?

173
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,802
- Don't you care?
- Of course I care.

174
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,001
The mission comes first.

175
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,569
Who is he?

176
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,241
Leo Mueller.

177
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,765
German arms dealer, suspected in the theft
of 100 M2-49 squad automatic weapons.

178
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,287
- Okay.
- Last night he arrived in Starling City...

179
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,521
...to sell the guns.

180
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,730
Don't you imagine there's enough trouble
you're in than to go after this guy?

181
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,043
I imagine what would happen if a gang
got military hardware.

182
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,647
I imagine our city's streets
turned into a war zone.

183
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,203
But you're under house arrest, Oliver,
which means you can't go after this guy.

184
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,128
Look. For now, I would just like you
to shadow Mueller.

185
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,567
I would like you to track his movements.

186
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,326
I wanna know where the buy
is happening.

187
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,282
Okay.

188
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,567
- And how am I supposed to track him?
- Well, you know us billionaire vigilantes.

189
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,765
We do love our toys.

190
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,401
Wow.

191
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,925
Ow.

192
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,929
Whoo.

193
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,121
Oh, that's sweet.

194
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,847
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- No, I didn't.

195
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,561
In fact, this meeting isn't taking place.

196
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,522
How long have you been head of Security
at Queen Consolidated, Josiah?

197
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,651
- Going on seven years now, sir.
- Sounds about right.

198
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,207
But what I'm about to tell you
will test the bounds of your discretion.

199
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,206
You're aware of the Queen's Gambit?
Robert Queen's ill-fated yacht?

200
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,606
I found it.

201
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,287
Sir, the boat went down
in the North China Sea five years ago.

202
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,201
Which is why my discovery
of its remains in a warehouse downtown...

203
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,289
...was unexpected, to say the least.

204
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,928
I want you to transfer those remains
to a secure location.

205
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,406
Can I count on you?

206
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,686
What's going on, sir?

207
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,367
That's very much
what I'm trying to determine.

208
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,165
Thank you both for coming.

209
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,608
Thank you.
It's nice to get out of the house.

210
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,563
I'll cut right to it. Detective Lance arrested
your client without consulting my office.

211
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,361
So, congratulations,
I am willing to consider a plea in this case.

212
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,601
Absolutely not.

213
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,888
Mr. Queen spent five years in seclusion...

214
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,129
...on a deserted island,
cut off from civilization.

215
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,171
It is quite possible he's suffering
from some form of post-traumatic stress.

216
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,847
Given that,
we would support a plea of insanity...

217
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,602
...conditional on a period of indeterminate
incarceration at a psychiatric facility.

218
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,041
- No, thank you. I'm not crazy.
- Finally something we agree on.

219
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,124
- He's not a nut. He's a killing machine.
- I'm neither.

220
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,409
There is nothing you can say
that I would believe.

221
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,649
I'll take a polygraph.

222
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,521
- Polygraphs are inadmissible.
- In front of a jury.

223
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,887
I'll talk a polygraph in front of him.

224
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,564
He's the one I need to convince.

225
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,246
I'm gonna need a minute.

226
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,006
You're looking at life in prison.
What Spencerjust offered you is a gift.

227
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,961
I'm not crazy. I am innocent.
I kind of wanna take the polygraph...

228
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,725
...and if I take it and I fail,
then I will consider making a deal.

229
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,169
Fine.

230
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,521
I'll set up the poly. And I will tell Spencer
that we're not pleading out.

231
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,368
But, Oliver? You have a family. Friends.
People who actually care about you.

232
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,923
So don't for one second think you're the
only person with something to lose here.

233
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,809
I'll be right back.

234
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,566
Please. Sit. You're making me feel rude.

235
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,005
I do apologize
for my men's treatment of you.

236
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,006
They're...

237
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:30,041
They're trained to view any stranger
as hostile.

238
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,283
I'm Edward Fyers, by the way.

239
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,764
And you are?

240
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,922
I'm Oliver Queen.

241
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,765
I was shipwrecked here.
I don't know for how long.

242
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,442
My family has money, lots of money.

243
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,045
You would be--

244
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,887
You'd be really well compensated
for my rescue.

245
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,721
Well, I look forward to that.

246
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,928
But for the moment, let's just talk.

247
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,764
About what?

248
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,167
Well, for instance...

249
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,965
...this gentleman.

250
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,964
Do you know him?

251
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,086
- No.
- No?

252
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,729
- No. Who's he?
- You're a poor liar.

253
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,646
I've been polite.

254
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,247
I'll offer you one more chance
before my manners leave me.

255
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,722
Hey. Hey. I don't know this guy.

256
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,400
L-- I thought I was on this island
all by myself.

257
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,806
Do you know what this island is named?

258
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,045
We're on Lian Yu.
Mandarin for "purgatory."

259
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,601
But I can make it feel like hell.

260
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,088
I don't know why you're protecting him.

261
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,324
You're young. Foolish.

262
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,040
Perhaps you don't know why either.

263
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,925
Think on that
when you're begging for death.

264
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,644
He's yours now.

265
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,002
Hey, Speedy. One of the workers left a keg
too far from the bar.

266
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,881
Can you ask them to move it? Please?
I got the ankle thingy.

267
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,568
I don't want to set off a SWAT invasion.

268
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,642
Hey, all this stuff, it's gonna be fine.
I promise.

269
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,167
Yeah, well, when you and Dad left
on the yacht...

270
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,370
...you promised me I'd see you
in a few days, which didn't happen.

271
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,967
This is different than that.
I didn't do any of this stuff.

272
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,329
You know that. Right?

273
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,131
You're out all the time.

274
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,251
You have those scars, and since you've
been back, you've been acting really weird.

275
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,688
None of this makes me
some Robin Hood wannabe.

276
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,602
And you gave me this.
I mean, it's an arrowhead.

277
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,842
Oh, man.

278
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,001
Thea, I bought that in the gift shop
of the Beijing Airport.

279
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,524
Now I'm sort of happy I didn't buy you
the shot glass with the panda on it...

280
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,048
...because then you'd be worried
I was Panda Man.

281
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,604
You know,
I knew you couldn't be this person.

282
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,044
I just-- I can't lose you again.

283
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,490
Deal.

284
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,001
Moira, thank you for coming
on such short notice.

285
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,165
Yes. Could you please make this quick.
I'm in the midst of a family emergency.

286
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,966
Yes, of course.
It's all over the local news.

287
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,441
Possibly even national.

288
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,682
- Well, I know what you're thinking.
- Do you?

289
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,731
My son is not the man targeting the list.
The charges are preposterous.

290
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,089
Not according to the district attorney,
assistant attorney...

291
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,369
...the investigating detective
and the police that filed charges.

292
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,763
- That detective has a vendetta.
- Why?

293
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,007
Is there something untoward
about your family?

294
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,563
If so, something really needs
to be done about that.

295
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,243
Is your name Oliver Queen?

296
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,244
You don't know who I am, detective?

297
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,243
The questions calibrate the polygraph.

298
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,124
- Is your name Oliver Queen?
- Yes.

299
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,449
Were you born in Starling City,
May 16th, 1985?

300
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,806
Yes.

301
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,604
- Is your hair blue?
- No.

302
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,603
Ever been to Iron Heights prison?

303
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,370
No.

304
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,281
Are you the man in this picture?

305
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,403
Where can I find the man in this picture?

306
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,366
No.

307
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,483
- You steal $40 million off Adam Hunt?
- No, I didn't.

308
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,881
Were you marooned on an island
for five years?

309
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,166
- Yes.
- Is that relevant?

310
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,569
Since you asked, whatever happened
to your client on that island...

311
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,564
...turned him into a cold-blooded killer.

312
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,571
The physician reported that 20 percent
of your body is covered in scar tissue.

313
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,641
The machine won't work
unless you ask a question.

314
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,251
Did that happen to you there?

315
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,161
Yes.

316
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,370
When you came back, you told everyone
that you were alone on that island.

317
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,448
Are you claiming that your scars
were self-inflicted?

318
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,049
No.

319
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,727
I wasn't alone. I didn't wanna talk
about what happened on the island.

320
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,929
- Why not?
- The people that were there tortured me.

321
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,329
Have you killed anyone?

322
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,124
Yes.

323
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,121
When I asked your daughter Sara
to come on my father's yacht with me.

324
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,487
I killed your daughter.

325
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,326
I'd have to study the data,
but just eyeballing it, he's telling the truth.

326
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,641
Hmm.

327
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,007
Can I assume you'll be recommending
Ms. Spencer...

328
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,162
...to drop all charges against my client?

329
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,802
No. I know a guilty man when I see one.
He is guilty.

330
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,089
Whether you can see it or not.

331
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,128
- Hi, everybody.
- Hey.

332
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:08,162
I'm very touched that you came to celebrate
with me before I am sent up the river.

333
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,166
Closest neighbors are 6 miles away,
so don't worry about the noise.

334
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,607
Actually, on second thought...

335
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,881
...let's wake those losers up!

336
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,965
If you think this is what prison's like,
you are in for a rude awakening.

337
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,406
Mueller's car's been in the warehouse
district of the Glades for 45 minutes.

338
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,722
Yeah, it's a good place for an arms deal.

339
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,406
Okay, since it's going down tonight,
what do we do?

340
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,246
- Drop a dime on Mueller with the cops?
- No. The man in the hood...

341
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,250
...he's gonna stop them.

342
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,562
Oliver, you can't leave the house.

343
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,520
It doesn't have to be me in the hood.

344
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,410
That's why you threw
this ridiculous party?

345
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,327
A hundred witnesses placing you
at the house...

346
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,841
...while I'm across town
dressed as a vigilante?

347
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,402
I thought it was gonna be enough
just for you to be seen in the hood.

348
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,201
I didn't count on Mueller showing up,
and the possibility that the Glades...

349
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,609
...could be flooded with machine guns.

350
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,604
Look...

351
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,727
...I promise, it was never my intention
to put you in harm's way.

352
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,851
Oliver, I didn't think joining your crusade
was ever gonna be risk-free.

353
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,930
I just don't like being played.

354
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,047
You have gotten used to lying
to everyone else...

355
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,726
...but I'm the one guy you don't lie to.

356
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,365
You're right.

357
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,280
I'm sorry.

358
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,726
So am I going to jail?

359
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,883
No, man.

360
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,682
I gotta stop an arms deal.

361
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,129
- Hello?
- Mr. Steele.

362
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,609
I'm sorry to bother you, sir.
This is Mike Vogel down in Security.

363
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,808
I have some sad news for you.

364
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,247
The company's head of Security,
Josiah Hudson...

365
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,323
...was in a car accident tonight.

366
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,642
He's dead, sir.

367
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,205
Hello.

368
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,041
Do we have a legal meeting or something?
Because I have friends over.

369
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,847
Do you think maybe
you can tear yourself away...

370
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,050
...from this inappropriately themed rave
for a couple minutes?

371
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,291
Wow.

372
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,244
I can't remember the last time
that I've been in this room.

373
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,804
I can. Halloween 2005.
We were getting ready for Tommy's party.

374
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,682
Ah. Yes, I wore those horrible fishnets.

375
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,251
I thought you looked good.

376
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,688
Listen...

377
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,202
...I just wanted to come by
and apologize...

378
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,609
...for my father's behavior today
during the polygraph.

379
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,927
You don't have to apologize for him.
He has a right to feel any way that he wants.

380
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,811
It wasn't just Sara, Ollie.

381
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,564
What do you mean?

382
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:34,051
After Sara died,
my father threw himself into his work.

383
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,409
I think that's part of the reason
I'm an attorney.

384
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,042
He ran to the law and I followed.

385
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,565
But my mother couldn't.

386
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,845
So she left him.

387
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,407
Left us.

388
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,526
Look, I'm not trying to tell you this
to make you feel bad or worse.

389
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,570
I just-- I really want you
to understand him.

390
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,921
Why don't you hate me?

391
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,691
You should.

392
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,604
I did.

393
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,689
For so long, I did, Ollie.

394
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,529
But after today, I realized...

395
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,291
...I was so focused
on what happened to my family...

396
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,650
...that I didn't even stop and wonder
what could have happened to you.

397
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,161
I didn't know about the torture
or your scars.

398
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:43,164
What happened to you on that island
was far more than you deserved.

399
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,289
And I was wrong
that I didn't ask you before.

400
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,166
But I'm asking you now.
I need to know. I need to see.

401
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,761
Are you sure?

402
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,089
Yes.

403
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,923
How did you survive this?

404
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,765
There were times when I wanted to die.

405
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,890
In the end...

406
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,371
...there was something I wanted more.

407
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,969
You don't-- Laurel, you don't have to go.

408
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,886
Amazing. You have resolve
I didn't credit you for.

409
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,364
Or perhaps
he truly doesn't know anything.

410
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,210
Yes.

411
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,689
You should put him out of his misery.

412
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,251
The M249 machine gun.

413
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:16,290
Gas-powered, air-cooled,
fires up to 800 rounds per minute.

414
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,960
We need to move. Now.

415
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,881
Go. Come on.

416
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,485
Let's go.

417
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,722
Well, I'm not accustomed
to being summoned to the office...

418
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,167
...in the middle of the night.

419
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,727
Well, what was it that was so important
that I had to race down here?

420
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,084
I found the Queen's Gambit, Moira.

421
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,804
I know you secretly
had the boat salvaged.

422
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,487
I wanted to move it to a secure location
before confronting you about it.

423
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,561
In fact, I sent Josiah Hudson to
the warehouse for precisely that purpose...

424
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,771
...but he died mysteriously
in a car accident.

425
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,530
I hope you now have a better understanding
of why it is I've been so distant of late.

426
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,605
It's very disconcerting to discover the
person with whom you share your home...

427
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,566
...your bed and your heart,
has been lying to you so convincingly.

428
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,401
I would be a fool not to consider
all the things you have told me were lies.

429
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,126
- Walter, you're my husband.
- Yes, I am.

430
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,525
Walter, please.

431
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,724
You've got to stop looking into this.
It's not safe.

432
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,761
You'll be-- You'll be upsetting people.
People with influence.

433
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,847
You are very far out of your depth.

434
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,929
Man in the hood, 1. Gang bangers, zero.

435
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,242
Hang on. Yeah?

436
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,246
Mr. Queen, if you're entertaining guests
upstairs...

437
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,244
- ...should I have drinks sent up?
- No, it's just me here...

438
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,641
...and I'm on my way back down.

439
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,766
Good job. Now get back here.

440
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,851
Yeah. Yeah.

441
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,964
How did you know I was in trouble?

442
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,964
When the guy was fighting you,
he broke the ankle monitor.

443
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,963
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

444
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,408
- Oliver.
- Mom, I promise.

445
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,845
This is on you. By accusing my son
publicly, you've made him a target.

446
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,810
Do you have any idea
who attacked Oliver?

447
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,522
We haven't identified him. It must be
someone with a grudge against the hood.

448
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,971
- What are you doing?
- Just got a call from my lieutenant.

449
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,569
An arms dealer was attacked
across town tonight.

450
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,445
By the vigilante.
Multiple witnesses put him there.

451
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,884
In light of that, all charges against your son
are dropped.

452
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,169
I'm truly sorry for what's happened
to your family, Quentin.

453
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,569
But would you kindly get the hell out
of my house?

454
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,723
Mr. Lance?

455
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,760
Thank you.

456
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,207
Moira. Did we have an appointment?

457
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,729
No. But I decided to screw propriety
after you tried to have my son killed.

458
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,369
I'm sure you understand
I was justified in suspecting your son...

459
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,000
...of being the vigilante
targeting our associates.

460
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,049
I had to take steps.

461
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,965
And now that you know
your steps were taken in error?

462
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,963
That Oliver is not your enemy?

463
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,408
I offer my sincerest apologies.

464
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,564
I know you found out
I had the yacht salvaged.

465
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,167
Just as I know
you had Josiah Hudson killed.

466
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,404
Well, accidents tend to befall people
who are too curious.

467
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,211
I've been the good soldier.

468
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,082
I've done everything you asked.

469
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,248
But if any member of my family
so much as gets a paper cut...

470
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,564
...I will burn your entire world to ashes.

471
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,806
I tell you, island dangerous.
But you not tell them where to find me.

472
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,362
You stronger than I thought.

473
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,602
Take it. I lead them off. You stay.

474
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,051
Remember, everything breathe.
You breathe, you survive here longer.

475
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,846
I'm coming with you.

476
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,331
- Rough party.
- My father told me what happened.

477
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,363
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

478
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,968
These are your polygraph results.

479
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,566
My father asked you
if you'd ever been to Iron Heights.

480
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,804
It's the prison where the vigilante saved me
last week.

481
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,404
It's also where you and I went
on our eighth-grade field trip.

482
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,527
When you said
that you had never been there...

483
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,765
...I thought maybe you were just nervous,
or that you'd forgotten.

484
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,291
But then I looked at your results...

485
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,407
...and there is a slight flutter in your answer
to that question.

486
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,685
And if you lied on one,
you could have lied on others.

487
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,721
What happened to me being too selfish
to be a masked crusader?

488
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,645
Oliver, I saw your scars.

489
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,965
Do you wanna know why I don't talk
about what happened to me there?

490
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,525
Because, if people knew...

491
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,891
...if you knew...

492
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,766
...you'd see me differently.

493
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,366
And not as some vigilante guy.

494
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,489
As damaged.

495
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,570
I don't sleep.

496
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,571
I barely eat.

497
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,329
I can barely sign my name...

498
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,564
...let alone aim a bow and arrow.

499
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,401
After last night...

500
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,648
...clearly we're still attracted
to one another.

501
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,563
Oliver...

502
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,881
...nothing can ever happen between us.

503
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,964
I know.

504
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,000
So you lied to her.

505
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,567
Or maybe you just gave her
a version of the truth.

506
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,530
I told her what she needed to hear.
She was too close.

507
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,246
The sad thing is...

508
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,607
...I think you actually believe that.

509
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,684
I think things didn't go down exactly
as you planned.

510
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,724
You didn't count on so many people
having questions.

511
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,530
Doubting you.

512
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,451
You didn't think about what happens
when you lie.

513
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,210
- Thank you, Chris.
- Walter?

514
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,567
Especially when you lie to ones you love most.

515
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,324
What is this?

516
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,761
Business trip.

517
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,124
I decided it's long overdue for me
to inspect our holdings in Melbourne.

518
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,649
And how long will you be?

519
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,683
I don't know.

520
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,161
When you were stuck on that island...

521
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,482
...plotting your grand plan to save the city...

522
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,246
...I don't think you stopped
to consider the effect...

523
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,165
...it would have on the people in your life.

524
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,768
Let's go.

525
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,050
- It's fine.
- Come on. You're okay.

526
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,680
No, no, no. Put it--

527
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,170
Or how it might hurt them.

528
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,169
You're wrong.

529
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,371
I think about it all the time.

530
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,723
And just to be clear,
not being able to tell my family the truth...

531
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,523
...it doesn't hurt anyone worse
than it hurts me.

532
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,369
- Where you going?
- Mueller still has guns. I have to stop him.

533
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,444
- Oliver.
- He had his chance.

534
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:57,006
Twenty-eight crates, four guns
in each crate, $250,000 cash.

535
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,362
Take it or leave it.

536
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,403
That's the deal.

537
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,091
Yeah, okay.

538
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,364
Leo Mueller, you have failed this city.
