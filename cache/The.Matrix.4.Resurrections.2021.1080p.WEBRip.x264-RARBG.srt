<font color="#20e020">HI removed, cleaned and

2
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,965
- Seq, I'm in.
- Captain.

3
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,100
You were right.

4
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,611
The skylight
was a window pane.

5
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,900
I've got
serious interference.

6
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,510
Weird.
It's some kind of Modal.

7
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,691
Looks like old code.

8
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,151
It feels
really familiar.

9
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,986
Drop a pin.
I'll signal for backup.

10
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:11,738
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Bugs?

11
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,104
If the general finds out
we've been fishing...

12
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,783
A quick peek can't hurt.

13
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,159
Did you hear that?

14
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,642
Shit. I think
our signal was traced.

15
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,829
Bugs, this feels like a trap.

16
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,039
Bugs!

17
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,498
Freeze!
Do not move!

18
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,541
We will shoot!

19
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,919
Very slowly, raise your hands.

20
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,393
Here we go.

21
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,733
Hey, where are you going?

22
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,026
You were warned, Lieutenant.

23
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,362
I think we can handle
one little girl.

24
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:38,908
You're wasting your time!

25
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,244
My men are bringing her
down now.

26
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,412
No, Lieutenant,

27
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,498
your men are already dead.

28
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,302
Seq, you with me?

29
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,761
This old code keeps crashing.

30
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,253
Your projection's breaking up.
Switch to audio.

31
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,598
Bugs,
this is a direct violation

32
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,932
of the general's protocols.

33
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,434
I know, I know.

34
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,144
But something
is happening here.

35
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,771
Something important.

36
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,939
Oh, fuck.

37
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,608
We know what happens next.

38
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,359
She kicks their ass.

39
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,300
Now she makes a call.

40
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,635
The line was traced.

41
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,970
- And then...
- Then she runs for her life.

42
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,388
Are there any agents?

43
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,890
We know this story.

44
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,060
This is how it all began.

45
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,604
God damn it.

46
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,147
This is where he began.

47
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,484
You're thinking this Modal
is a loop? Or a treadmill?

48
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,112
Some sort of sequencer
evolving a program to do what?

49
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,364
I don't know.

50
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,158
But I'm going to find out.

51
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:03,368
All right.

52
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,359
So deja vu and yet it's
obviously all wrong.

53
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,611
Why use old code
to mirror something new?

54
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,321
I don't know.

55
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,044
If that's supposed
to be Trinity,

56
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,671
that's not what happens.

57
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,591
Maybe this isn't the story
we think it is.

58
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,052
Bugs, you have
to get out of here.

59
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,388
It's gotta be a trap.

60
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,849
Shit.

61
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,888
Uh...

62
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,765
You all carry on.

63
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,849
As you were.

64
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,395
I'm just gonna...

65
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,065
see myself out.

66
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,149
Kill her.

67
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,102
Oh, Seq!

68
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,212
- Why did you save me?
- You first.

69
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,047
Who are you?
Where did you come from?

70
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,674
Okay.

71
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,509
My name is Bugs.

72
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,887
As in "Bunny."

73
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,680
And tech that listens.

74
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,725
Do you know this is a Modal?

75
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,102
What's a Modal?

76
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,479
It's a simulation
used to evolve programs.

77
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,235
Do you understand
that you are...

78
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,821
digital sentience?

79
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,573
I know what I am.

80
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,908
Just like I know my job

81
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,076
is to hunt down
and destroy synthients.

82
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,411
Like you.

83
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,125
And yet...

84
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,212
Here we are.

85
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,713
Here we are.

86
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,467
The other agents
don't know about this room?

87
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,595
How'd you find it?

88
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,181
No one was ever
in the key shop,

89
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,474
so I started looking.

90
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,727
More you looked,
the more you found.

91
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,355
Story of my life.

92
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,488
What?

93
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,242
I feel like I know this room.

94
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,294
Holy shit.

95
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,131
This is his apartment.

96
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,468
You mean Thomas Anderson's?

97
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:14,512
I searched everywhere.
He doesn't exist.

98
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,847
He stopped being Thomas
a long time ago,

99
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,308
but maybe you know him
by his real name.

100
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,143
Neo.

101
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,854
You do.

102
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,524
Oh, okay.

103
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,484
Uh...

104
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:31,195
I can't believe this,
after all these years.

105
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,949
You see, most people
think that Neo is dead.

106
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,702
But I know he's not.

107
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,413
Because I've seen him.

108
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,458
Where?

109
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,086
It's not something
I can explain easily, but...

110
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,719
But the moment
he looked at me,

111
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,429
I felt something...

112
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,475
unlock my mind.

113
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,104
Okay.

114
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,358
Something like that
happened to me.

115
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,948
I saw this pattern...

116
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,659
and it was everywhere.

117
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,663
We can't see it,
but we're all trapped inside

118
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,291
these strange,
repeating loops.

119
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:28,627
Somehow I saw it
in the mirror.

120
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,464
Just a flicker,
but it was like you said.

121
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,347
And suddenly I understood.

122
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,891
This is not the real world.

123
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,688
For the first time,
I felt real purpose.

124
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,316
I knew who I was

125
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,318
and what I had to do.

126
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,403
Who are you?

127
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,448
What do you have to do?

128
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,702
I am...

129
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,871
Morpheus.

130
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,291
And I have to find Neo.

131
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,797
Morpheus.

132
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,385
Okay. Okay.

133
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,552
Oh, my God!

134
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,929
I have to get you out of here.

135
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,431
I need to figure out
who built this Modal.

136
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,100
Okay, come with me.

137
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,384
You have to be ready to leave.
You have to be really ready.

138
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,686
And if you're not,

139
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,530
if you think that
this is where you belong...

140
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,692
You call this a choice?

141
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,351
Oh, honestly, when somebody
offered me these things,

142
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,936
I went off on binary
conceptions of the world

143
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,586
and said there was no way
I was swallowing

144
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,491
some symbolic reduction
of my life.

145
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,974
And the woman
with the pills laughed

146
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,192
'cause I was
missing the point.

147
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,787
What point?

148
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,790
The choice is an illusion.

149
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,084
You already know
what you have to do.

150
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:57,925
Truth.

151
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,641
Okay.

152
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:06,934
There's an old building

153
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,602
with a skylight
and lots of stairs.

154
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,895
The Lafayette.

155
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,522
One of the four back doors
leads there.

156
00:12:12,756 --> 00:12:13,556
Oh.

157
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,141
- Don't fight it.
- Whoa, what's happening?

158
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,235
Keep breathing.

159
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,758
Extraction works
pretty much the same

160
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,697
for humans and programs.

161
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,534
Ouch.

162
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,660
Ah.

163
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,371
Okay.

164
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,333
- Hey.
- Hey.

165
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,210
I've never worn
different glasses before.

166
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,046
Yeah, looks good.
Which door?

167
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,923
- It's gotta be...
- Okay.

168
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,680
Agent White.

169
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:45,973
Agent Smith?

170
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,147
Go!

171
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,031
Seq! Can you hear me?

172
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,365
Bugs! I thought I lost you.

173
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,769
Can you get us
to the window pane?

174
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,744
Bugs! Bugs! He's an agent!

175
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,173
That window! Go hard!

176
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,846
What the...

177
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,105
What the hell?

178
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,290
Something wrong?

179
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,126
Uh... Just a little crash.

180
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,587
Morning, Bobbi. Morning, dude.

181
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,465
What a beautiful day
to be alive. Am I right?

182
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,551
- Problemo?
- He lost something.

183
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:48,178
Is this old Matrix code?

184
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,765
A little Modal experiment.

185
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,810
For Binary?

186
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:57,521
- I need a coffee.
- Coffee. Yes, stat!

187
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,731
I'm buying.

188
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,485
I'm not trying to blow
smoke up your ass,

189
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,990
but the first time I played
the trilogy, I was shook.

190
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,659
The paradox
between free will and destiny.

191
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,910
Are we all just algorithms

192
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,203
doing what we're
supposed to do

193
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,997
or can we escape
our programming?

194
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,001
Genius, inside the context
of the game, BT dubs.

195
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,170
Hey, did I tell you
it took over my life?

196
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,006
Yeah. I failed
the seventh grade.

197
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,258
Your game almost ruined me.

198
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,844
- So you've said.
- Yet here we are.

199
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:31,764
You tell me, Mr. Anderson,

200
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:32,890
is it free will

201
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,768
or destiny?

202
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,358
Oh, yeah.

203
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,360
There she is.

204
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,944
Total f-ing MILF.

205
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,906
Daggers. Look, I'm sorry.

206
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,283
I'm a geek.
I was raised by machines.

207
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,618
Maybe you should go.

208
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,746
No, please.
I... I promise, best self.

209
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,081
Best self.

210
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,252
Sure.

211
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,546
You ever talk to her?

212
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,092
Tell you what.

213
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:12,554
For all you've done for me,
let me do this for you.

214
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,391
Jude, no. Stop.

215
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,184
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Thanks.

216
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,686
Hi. Um...

217
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,354
I know this is all
a bit extemporaneous.

218
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,064
I'm Jude Gallagher.

219
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,733
I work for a game company
called Deus Machina.

220
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,068
Hi, Jude, I'm Tiffany.

221
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,071
Tiffany. Wow.
Didn't see that coming.

222
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,073
- Mom loved Audrey Hepburn.
- Jude.

223
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:35,077
Oh, and this is my very
good friend, Thomas Anderson.

224
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,079
He is a bona fide
famous person

225
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,539
and considered by most to be

226
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,624
the greatest game designer
of our generation.

227
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,917
I'm sorry about this.

228
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,210
- Jude...
- Just talk to her.

229
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,796
Hi, Thomas.
Everyone calls me "Tiff."

230
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,881
Hi.

231
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,181
Have we met?

232
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,768
Uh, we both come here.

233
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,292
- Can I have your morning bun?
- Hey!

234
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,833
Are you trying
to ball my mom or what?

235
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,148
Brandon!

236
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,108
Can I have one bite?

237
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,194
Babe! What's going on?
We're gonna be late.

238
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,196
This is my husband, Chad.

239
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,073
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

240
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,785
Babe, we gotta get
Callie to practice.

241
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,954
Right. Sorry.

242
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,664
Come on, kids. Let's move out.

243
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,023
What?

244
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,824
Sorry. Uh, it's the boss.

245
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,833
"Billions of people
just living out their lives...

246
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,878
oblivious."

247
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,216
I always loved that line.

248
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,759
You wrote that one, yeah?

249
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,639
Every time I stand here,

250
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,975
I mean, O-M-G.

251
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,102
It's so perfect,
it's gotta be fake.

252
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,563
Right?

253
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,691
Yeah.

254
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,693
Sure.

255
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,612
Have a seat.

256
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,825
Smoke?

257
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:40,160
I thought you quit.

258
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,413
I quit calling it a habit.

259
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,415
Now it's just
a guilty pleasure.

260
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:51,171
Oh. Maybe I can make this
easy for you.

261
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,298
I know Binary is over budget.

262
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,676
This is not about Binary, Tom.
It's bigger than that.

263
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,094
This is about our future,

264
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:00,138
which is a sticky subject,
given our past.

265
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,431
What do you mean?

266
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,143
How's the therapy?

267
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,519
Good.

268
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,688
Any...

269
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,982
episodes?

270
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,860
No.

271
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,279
That's terrific.

272
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,492
Look, Tom, I know we've
always had our differences.

273
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,411
What did you say
about our first meeting?

274
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,747
We had all the chemistry
of an FBI interrogation.

275
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,877
But look at this place.

276
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,296
We did this.

277
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,882
Together.

278
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,718
Yeah.

279
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,761
Now what?

280
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,432
Things have changed.
The market's tough.

281
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,809
I'm sure you can understand
why our beloved

282
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,269
parent company, Warner Bros.,

283
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,771
has decided to make
a sequel to the trilogy.

284
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,273
What?

285
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,348
They informed me they're gonna
do it with or without us.

286
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,193
I thought
they couldn't do that.

287
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,779
Oh, they can.

288
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,197
And they made it clear

289
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,450
they'll kill our contract
if we don't cooperate.

290
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,243
Really?

291
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:07,205
I know you said the story
was over for you,

292
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,458
but that's the thing
about stories.

293
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,170
They never really end,
do they?

294
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,797
We're still telling the same
stories we've always told,

295
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:20,177
just with different names,
different faces

296
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,890
and I have to say
I'm kind of excited.

297
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,894
After all these years,

298
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,980
to be going back
to where it all started.

299
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,399
Back to The Matrix.

300
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,235
I've spoken to Marketing...

301
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,743
Tom?

302
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,370
Yeah.

303
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,496
Are you all right?

304
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:50,958
Yeah.

305
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,090
What were you feeling
at that point?

306
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,970
What was I feeling?

307
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:11,019
I felt either I'm having
a mental breakdown again

308
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:15,357
or I'm living inside
a computer-generated reality

309
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,984
that has imprisoned me...

310
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,777
again.

311
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,956
Not much of a choice.

312
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,249
No.

313
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,917
Maybe it's not
as binary as that.

314
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,295
Maybe there are other ways
to understand what happened.

315
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:38,964
Yeah.

316
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,216
Thomas, you are
a suicide survivor

317
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:44,177
gifted with
a powerful imagination.

318
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,013
Those facts have combined

319
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,598
to create dangerous fictions
in your life.

320
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,225
Yesterday,
you walked into a meeting

321
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:51,435
with your business partner

322
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,978
and he ambushed you,

323
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,480
demanding you make a game
you said you would never make.

324
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,900
This attack effectively
took away your voice.

325
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,737
His violence triggered you
and your mind fought back.

326
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,697
You did to him
what he was doing to you.

327
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,575
We've talked about the value

328
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:10,203
of adaptive anger
in healing trauma.

329
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,665
Far from suggesting a repeat
of your initial breakdown,

330
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,958
I believe this episode

331
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,835
demonstrates healthy
self-protection.

332
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,589
And more importantly,
I remember how hard

333
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,717
it was for you
to share something like this.

334
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,511
Which tells me
just how far we've come.

335
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,894
Do you need a refill
on your prescription?

336
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,938
Yeah.

337
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,755
First of all, I know
I speak for everyone

338
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,132
when I say that
I'm so, so excited

339
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,301
to be working on a game
that was such a...

340
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,470
well, game changer.

341
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,138
Now, the packet
in front of you

342
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,016
has our focus group research.

343
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,559
Inside, you'll find
the breakdown

344
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,479
including keyword association
with the brand.

345
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,649
The top two being
"originality" and "fresh,"

346
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,776
which I think are great things
to keep in mind

347
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,070
as you begin
working on Matrix 4.

348
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,198
And who knows how many more?

349
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:47,134
What made Matrix different?
It effed with your head.

350
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,510
On point.

351
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,595
People want us
up in their grey space,

352
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,723
switching their synaptic
"WTF" light on.

353
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,101
["White Rabbit" playing]

354
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:06,194
What made Matrix different?
It effed with your head.

355
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,113
People want us
up in their grey space,

356
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,531
switching their synaptic

357
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,242
"What the hell
is going on here?" light on.

358
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:26,548
I didn't love the first one,
like some of you.

359
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,050
And, frankly,
I've got zero tolerance

360
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,553
for anything that requires
a syllabus and a highlighter.

361
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,513
I like my games big,
loud and dumb.

362
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,557
We need guns! Lots of guns.

363
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,226
Matrix means mayhem.

364
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,066
Mindless action
is not on-brand.

365
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,568
She's right.

366
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,696
Matrix is mind-porn.
Philosophy in shiny...

367
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,448
- tight PVC.
- Yeah.

368
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,408
Ideas are the new "sexy."

369
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,257
Obviously
The Matrix is about...

370
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,593
- ...trans-politics.
- Crypto-fascism.

371
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,594
It's a metaphor...

372
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,346
...of capitalist exploitation.

373
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:31,196
This cannot be another reboot,
retread, regurgitated...

374
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,365
Why not? Reboots sell.

375
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,568
We are so far down the wrong
rabbit hole, here, people.

376
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:42,415
You say Matrix to anyone...
You say Matrix...

377
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,460
Matrix...
Matrix... Matrix...

378
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,379
...this is what they see.

379
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,346
Allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word.

380
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,598
Bullet time! Bullet time!

381
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,308
That's two words.

382
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:07,482
We need
a new "bullet time."

383
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,989
We need to revolutionize
gaming again.

384
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,867
Revolutionize gaming
again!

385
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,520
Afternoon, Tiff.

386
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:46,771
The ushe?

387
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,024
You know what, Skroce?
I'm going wild.

388
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,609
I'll have a cortado today.

389
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,237
Fly that freak flag.

390
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,072
Mind if I get that?

391
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,198
Oh, hi.

392
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,201
Hi.

393
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,787
I remember
wanting a family,

394
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,164
but was that because

395
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,916
that's what women
are supposed to want?

396
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,783
How do you know
if you want something yourself

397
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,921
or if your upbringing
programmed you to want it?

398
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,006
Mmm.

399
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,009
I pay my analyst
a lot of money

400
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,678
to answer
such questions for me.

401
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:19,971
Smart.

402
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,264
I should get more therapy

403
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,767
but honestly,
I'm too goddamn tired.

404
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,602
Kids are exhausting, you know?

405
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,439
No. Never had kids.

406
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:32,275
Oh, right, I knew that.

407
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,819
Sorry. I googled you.

408
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,366
So, what's it like being
a world-famous game designer?

409
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,993
- Must be amazing.
- Uh...

410
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,578
A lot of hours.

411
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:45,705
Sometimes it is amazing.

412
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,290
Most times...

413
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,793
I don't know.

414
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,379
But you made The Matrix.
Even I've heard of that.

415
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:56,257
Yeah. We kept
some kids entertained.

416
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,468
So, worth it?

417
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:07,394
Can I ask something
about your game?

418
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,728
Sure.

419
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,064
Did you base your
main character on yourself?

420
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,196
There is a lot of me in him.

421
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:23,868
Maybe a little too much.

422
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,622
Can I ask you something else?

423
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:28,915
Please.

424
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,919
There's a woman in your game.

425
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,130
Trinity.

426
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,717
Which is a weird
coincidence also, right?

427
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,387
God, yeah.

428
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,014
I like her.

429
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,518
- I like Trinity.
- Ah.

430
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,853
And I dig her Ducati.

431
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,939
Another coincidence.
I love motorcycles.

432
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,945
My friend Kush and I
actually build them.

433
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,155
Really?

434
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,616
You have your analyst,
I have my bikes.

435
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,329
So, I was looking at images
from your game. At Trinity.

436
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,624
Well, I showed Chad a scene,

437
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,751
and I was like,
"So, what do you think?"

438
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,338
He didn't get it until I said,

439
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,424
"Don't you think
she looks like me?"

440
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,969
You know what he did?

441
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,555
He laughed.

442
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,146
And I laughed too,
like it was a joke.

443
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,772
How could it not be, right?

444
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,610
Made me so angry.

445
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,447
I hated myself for laughing.

446
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,202
I wanted to kick him so hard.

447
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,787
Not too hard.

448
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:53,082
Maybe just hard enough
to break his jaw off.

449
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,129
And right now,
you're probably regretting

450
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,714
sitting down with me.

451
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:05,762
This is the best thing
I've done in a long time.

452
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,851
I have to take this.

453
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,564
Hi, this is Tiff.

454
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,732
Oh, God, no.

455
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,778
I'll be right there.

456
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,697
My, uh, youngest
stuck a Lego up his nose.

457
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,866
Oh.

458
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,327
I gotta go.

459
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,123
I hope I see you again.

460
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,184
There has been a report

461
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,769
of an emergency.

462
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:56,771
Proceed calmly
to the nearest exit

463
00:30:56,854 --> 00:30:58,898
and leave the building
immediately.

464
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,358
What's going on?

465
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,350
We probably just got swatted
by some 14-year-old.

466
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,018
Yeah, someone pissed
about the latest update.

467
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,446
Or they're just a dick.

468
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,283
Please move to the exits.
Building's being evacuated.

469
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,222
Sir, this way.

470
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,229
Jude?

471
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,815
Jude!

472
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,240
At last.

473
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,327
Ah.

474
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,870
I wasn't too sure
about the callback,

475
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,955
but, you know,
it was hard to resist.

476
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,165
What?

477
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,666
Morpheus Uno.
Reveal at the window.

478
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,210
Lightning,
thunder and theater.

479
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,171
At last.

480
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,673
All these years later,
here's me,

481
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,009
strolling out
of a toilet stall.

482
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,218
Tragedy or farce?

483
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,928
I know you.

484
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,014
Not every day
you meet your maker.

485
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,265
This can't be happening.

486
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,017
Oh, most definitely is.

487
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,561
You can't be
a character I coded.

488
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,688
100% natural.

489
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,364
How?

490
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,616
All the explanation you need.

491
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,454
Oh.

492
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,705
No.

493
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,540
No, no, no.

494
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,417
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean, "no"?

495
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,128
You wanted this, you did this.
This was your idea.

496
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:48,549
It was a test. An experiment.

497
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,052
An experiment?

498
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,555
You put me
in a tiny-ass Modal,

499
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,015
left me to bang my head till

500
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,351
I nearly lost my shit
searching for you

501
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,936
as an experiment.

502
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,095
- The exit's breaking down.
- He hasn't taken the pill.

503
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,439
What? There's no time.

504
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,566
I know, I know.
He's having a moment.

505
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,111
Does he know how hard it was
to hack that mirror?

506
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,073
Still open.

507
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,576
This... This can't be real.

508
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,495
Target acquired.
We got him.

509
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,421
This isn't happening.

510
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,965
It's in my mind.
It's in my mind.

511
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,258
Hey, you!
Stop! Hold it!

512
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,900
This can't be happening.

513
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:52,780
Freeze! Don't move!

514
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,874
Neo!

515
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,182
Oh, my God!

516
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,009
Neo!

517
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,099
Mr. Anderson!

518
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,185
No!

519
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,311
It can't be.

520
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:15,947
I've missed you.

521
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,880
It's in my mind.

522
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,383
It's in my mind.

523
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,059
Can you hear me, Thomas?

524
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,105
Follow my voice.

525
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:52,900
Feel the tips of your fingers.
What are they touching?

526
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,320
The bell.

527
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,241
Do you hear the bell?

528
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,706
Do you remember what happened?
How you got here?

529
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,625
You must have walked.

530
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:10,918
I heard Deja Vu outside,

531
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,362
opened my door,
and there you were.

532
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,428
You feel like
you can talk about it?

533
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,791
When we started
working together,

534
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,598
you had lost your capacity

535
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,225
to discern reality
from fiction.

536
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,478
You came to me after
trying to jump off a building.

537
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,856
You said you wanted
to fly away.

538
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:47,955
We have made
a lot of progress since then,

539
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,374
but you seem particularly
triggered right now.

540
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,918
Can you tell me
how it started?

541
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,630
He texted me.

542
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,132
Who?

543
00:36:58,215 --> 00:36:59,675
Morpheus.

544
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,843
Ah.

545
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,930
So, he's back.

546
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,182
It wasn't actually him.

547
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,645
It was a program
I coded for a Modal.

548
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,897
And this "Modal," Morpheus,

549
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,982
came to help you escape

550
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,694
from a virtual reality
called The Matrix.

551
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,790
Am I crazy?

552
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,334
We don't use that word
in here.

553
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,337
What word should I use?

554
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,757
What word explains
what is happening to me?

555
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,509
Can I see the texts?

556
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,513
They were erased.

557
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:54,105
If we got in my car
and drove to your office,

558
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,148
what do you think
we'd find there?

559
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,274
Nothing.

560
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,071
Because there was no attack.

561
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,865
No one was killed.

562
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,910
No one texted.

563
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,037
My mind made it all up.

564
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,125
Is that what
I'm supposed to say?

565
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,710
Is that what you believe?

566
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,379
It felt real.

567
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,214
Of course.

568
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:23,217
It was your great ambition
to make a game

569
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,678
that was indistinguishable
from reality.

570
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,221
To achieve this goal,

571
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:29,765
you converted elements
of your life into narrative.

572
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,101
Your sublimated anger
toward your business partner

573
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,395
cast him as your nemesis.

574
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,105
A married woman named Tiffany

575
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:39,525
became the "Trinity"
of a doomed romance.

576
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:43,779
Even your dislike of my cat
made it into your Matrix.

577
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,656
There's nothing wrong
with that.

578
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,199
It's what artists do.

579
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,661
But it becomes a problem
when fantasies

580
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,080
endanger us or other people.

581
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:57,710
We don't want anyone
to get hurt,

582
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,170
do we, Thomas?

583
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,388
Hi, Thomas.
Everyone calls me "Tiff."

584
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,891
- Who are you?
- My name is Trinity.

585
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,601
No one can tell you
you're in love.

586
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,187
You just know it,
through and through.

587
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,773
Balls to bones.

588
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,649
You feel this?

589
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:24,070
I'm never letting go.

590
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,788
You have
to let it all go, Neo.

591
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,248
Free your mind.

592
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,477
Huh.

593
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,562
Looks easy enough.

594
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:08,030
"Free my mind." Shit.

595
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,246
Okay.

596
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,747
Free my mind.

597
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,515
I fly...

598
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:37,351
or I fall.

599
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,402
Who the hell are you?

600
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,363
You won't remember me,

601
00:40:49,446 --> 00:40:52,700
but a long time ago,
you changed my life

602
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,161
when you leapt off
another roof.

603
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:58,164
Back then, I was just like
any other coppertop,

604
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,957
pretending my life...

605
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,170
until I looked up
and I saw you.

606
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,755
It was a different you,
but I saw

607
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,300
the real you,

608
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,177
just a second before...

609
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,721
you leapt.

610
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:20,269
And you never fell.

611
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,735
Are you the one
that hacked my Modal?

612
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,320
Yeah.

613
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,364
That'll be Jude.

614
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,782
He's not your friend.

615
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,399
He's a handle,
a program used to control you.

616
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:36,452
He's on his way here,

617
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,370
and he's bringing
Agents with him.

618
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,081
Jude.

619
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,605
Bro, I've been calling you
all night.

620
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,376
We have a major problemo.

621
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,504
Are you alone?

622
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:53,052
That's kind
of a sexy question, dude.

623
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,429
They don't look like
typical Agents.

624
00:41:55,512 --> 00:41:57,004
They use bots now,
skinned as normal people,

625
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,214
which means they're everywhere

626
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,476
and you never know
who to trust.

627
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,311
Why should I trust you?

628
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:07,483
Because if they open
that door, we lose our hack.

629
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,276
I will be caught and killed

630
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,569
and you will be put right back

631
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,977
on that treadmill
they designed for you,

632
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,187
just like they did
the last time

633
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,397
you tried to leap
your way out.

634
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,118
I know why you left
your Modal open.

635
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,663
You needed someone else
to free Morpheus.

636
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,863
And it's because of him that
we were able to get to you.

637
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,750
I know these things
the same way

638
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,586
that I knew one day
I would find you.

639
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,297
And that when I did,
you would be ready for this.

640
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,262
If you want the truth, Neo,

641
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,515
you're going
to have to follow me.

642
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,059
Okay.

643
00:43:01,578 --> 00:43:04,206
- Where are we?
- Tokyo.

644
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,125
A moving portal
makes it harder to track us.

645
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,836
- Seq is the best of them.
- Portal's clean.

646
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,337
Reading our shadows.

647
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,341
I don't remember this.

648
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,719
We don't have to run to
phone booths anymore, either.

649
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,771
Door's on your right.

650
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,371
Set and setting, right?

651
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,748
Oh, no.

652
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,291
It's all about set

653
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,376
and setting.

654
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,587
After our first contact
went so badly,

655
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,547
we thought elements
from your past

656
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:55,132
might help ease you
into the present.

657
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:58,052
Nothing comforts anxiety like

658
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,553
a little nostalgia.

659
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:01,972
This is footage
from your game.

660
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,190
Time is
always against us,

661
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,109
etcetera, etcetera.

662
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,445
No one can be told

663
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:19,823
what the Matrix is,
blah, blah, blah.

664
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,370
You gotta see it
to believe it.

665
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,583
Time to fly.

666
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,087
Wait.

667
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,421
If this is real,

668
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,132
if I haven't lost my mind,
does that mean

669
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,219
this happened?

670
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,687
But if it did...

671
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,360
then we died.

672
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,362
Obviously not.

673
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,863
Why the Machines
kept you alive

674
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,825
and why they went
to such lengths to hide you

675
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,743
are questions
we don't have answers to.

676
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,412
Hide me?

677
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:10,791
I've been at a company making
a game called The Matrix.

678
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,460
Doesn't seem like they were
trying to hide anything.

679
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,160
We've been tracking
that company for years.

680
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,965
We screened every
Thomas Anderson we found.

681
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,633
What we didn't understand

682
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:22,219
was that they could
alter your DSI.

683
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,054
Pods generate
your digital self-image

684
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,640
through a feedback system
called Semblance.

685
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:28,725
This is how
you look to yourself.

686
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,521
Somehow they were able
to alter your DSI loop.

687
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:35,107
This is how
everyone else sees you.

688
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:51,165
Twenty years?

689
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:56,003
Why did it take 20 years
to find me?

690
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,921
It took a lot longer
than that.

691
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:00,007
It's been over 60 years
since you and Trinity

692
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,842
flew to one
of the Machine Cities.

693
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,510
What?

694
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,804
There's so much we don't know.

695
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,639
Like why you've barely aged,

696
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,933
or how many times
they've altered your DSI.

697
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,351
But based on
what we do know,

698
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,769
it appears no one found you

699
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,688
because you didn't
want to be found.

700
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:17,524
- That's not true.
- Maybe it isn't.

701
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:18,817
Maybe there's no foundation

702
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,142
to the rumors
that you disappeared,

703
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,320
because you were working

704
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:22,843
with the Machines
from the beginning.

705
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,031
Morpheus, stop.

706
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:27,242
All I'm saying is
this is the moment

707
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,870
for you to show us
what is real.

708
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:32,164
If you want out,

709
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:33,624
you'll take this pill.

710
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,544
But if you are
where you belong,

711
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,797
you can go back to this.

712
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,215
Every day.

713
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,927
Over and over forever.

714
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:49,598
Fuck.

715
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,817
Keep the loop tight.

716
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,414
Cybebe needs
that tower pin.

717
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,375
I got a signal. It's faint.

718
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,918
It's definitely off-grid.

719
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,219
Captain. I'm tracking
a whole lot of weird.

720
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,762
- What?
- It's some kind of graft.

721
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,311
Thomas?

722
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:39,273
Oh, God.

723
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:41,608
Oh, no.

724
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,112
- We got company.
- How'd they find us?

725
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:49,283
Thomas, none of this is real.

726
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:53,579
You are in the midst
of a serious psychotic break.

727
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:55,747
- Lexy?
- Almost there.

728
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,916
Thomas?

729
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,836
Thomas, please.
This is not a game.

730
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,421
Feel my hand.

731
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,714
This is what is real.

732
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,510
Stay with me.

733
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,220
No. No.

734
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:14,308
Stay with me.

735
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:17,978
Neo!

736
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,691
Morpheus!

737
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,652
Let's go, let's go!

738
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,143
- Bots are being activated.
- It's a swarm.

739
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,377
Come on!

740
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,328
I got a hack
in the bathroom. Hurry!

741
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,413
Yes.

742
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,206
Come on!

743
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,292
Seq, where?

744
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,088
- That mirror.
- What?

745
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,923
- We'll never fit.
- You gotta fit,

746
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:11,456
'cause I don't have
another way off this train.

747
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:12,467
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

748
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,011
No, no, no.

749
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,263
Think "perspective."

750
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,140
Closer you are,
bigger it gets.

751
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,353
Okay, come on.

752
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:25,772
In you go.

753
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,013
Trinity.

754
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:28,353
No!

755
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:52,187
Welcome back
to the real world.

756
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:01,905
Trinity.

757
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,188
- What's up, Doc?
- His vital systems

758
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,658
have been
meticulously maintained,

759
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,618
but it doesn't look good.

760
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:14,376
- We're losing him.
- Cold boot could shock him.

761
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,002
Do it.

762
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,600
I remember this.

763
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:34,813
The Construct.

764
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:38,233
In between everything

765
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,443
and nothing.

766
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,195
Welcome to the Crib.

767
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,824
I've been chilling here
in the ship network...

768
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,829
learning all about you.

769
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:56,668
And me.

770
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:04,342
Careful. It'll do your head in.

771
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:07,971
Are memories turned
into fiction any less real?

772
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:14,394
Is reality based in memory
nothing but fiction?

773
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:17,731
As to my role in all this,
my best guess

774
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,107
is that you wrote me

775
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,234
as an algorithmic reflection
of two forces

776
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:23,820
that helped you become you,

777
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:27,365
Morpheus and Agent Smith.

778
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:28,575
A combo pack

779
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:31,161
of counterprogramming
that was...

780
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:37,792
Let's just say, more than
a little bit crazy-making.

781
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,795
But it worked
because here we are.

782
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,423
Now, for the bad news.

783
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,717
Your brain
is hooked on this shit

784
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,678
the Matrix has been
force-feeding you for years.

785
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,430
Hooked bad.

786
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,033
You're going through
major withdrawals.

787
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:55,310
Docbots are giving you
crap odds for surviving.

788
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,645
But, see,
they don't know you like I do.

789
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,734
I know exactly what you need.

790
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:26,299
You gotta be kidding.

791
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:27,425
Uh-uh.

792
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:30,220
No joke.

793
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:34,432
Could be this is the first day
of the rest of your life.

794
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,351
But if you want it...

795
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:41,314
you gotta fight for it.

796
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,401
No. I'm done fighting.

797
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:47,445
Are you?

798
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,198
What the hell is he doing?

799
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:36,161
Oh, yeah.
They taught you good.

800
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:44,878
Made you believe their world
was all you deserved.

801
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,880
But some part of you knew
that was a lie.

802
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:49,716
Some part of you remembered
what was real.

803
00:57:52,468 --> 00:57:53,636
You don't know me.

804
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,305
No?

805
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,270
Ooh.

806
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,599
I know you, because I know

807
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,601
the only thing
that still matters to you.

808
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,854
I know it's why you're here,
why you're still fighting

809
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,522
and why you will
never give up.

810
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,038
Come on, Neo!

811
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:04,666
This is it.

812
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,378
This is your last chance.

813
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:17,804
You gotta fight
for your goddamn life

814
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,222
if you want to see
Trinity again.

815
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:25,520
Come on, Neo! Fight for her!

816
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:30,775
- Holy shit.
- Fight for her!

817
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:24,537
- Hey.
- Hey.

818
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,957
Mind if I...

819
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,638
How are you doing?

820
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,309
If this plug is actually real,

821
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:50,605
that means
they took my life...

822
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,526
and turned it
into a video game.

823
01:00:58,654 --> 01:01:00,281
How am I doing?

824
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,284
I don't know.

825
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,536
I don't even know how to know.

826
01:01:06,662 --> 01:01:08,122
That's it, isn't it?

827
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:11,834
If we don't know
what's real...

828
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,046
we can't resist.

829
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,425
They took your story,

830
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,010
something that meant

831
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:24,347
so much to people like me,

832
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:28,643
and turned it
into something trivial.

833
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:32,230
That's what the Matrix does.

834
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:35,274
It weaponizes every idea.

835
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,443
Every dream.

836
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,738
Everything
that's important to us.

837
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:45,493
Where better to bury truth
than inside something

838
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:48,621
as ordinary as a video game?

839
01:01:48,704 --> 01:01:50,706
That sounds like the Oracle.

840
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,918
Heard so much about her.

841
01:01:56,712 --> 01:01:58,256
She was gone
before I was free.

842
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,300
Gone?

843
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:04,220
When this new version
of the Matrix was uploaded,

844
01:02:05,721 --> 01:02:07,265
there was a purge.

845
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:15,898
They promised peace
and they gave us purge.

846
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:18,818
No.

847
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,611
No, there was peace.

848
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:27,160
You made it possible,
and it changed everything.

849
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:30,746
Doesn't feel like
it changed anything.

850
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:34,041
The Matrix is
the same or worse.

851
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:36,335
And I'm back where I started.

852
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:41,549
It feels like
everything I did,

853
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,093
everything we did...

854
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:52,310
...like none of it mattered.

855
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,189
All of it mattered.

856
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,442
I can show you.

857
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,704
This is my crew.

858
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:17,001
Our operator, Seq.

859
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:23,090
Sequoia. But everybody
calls me Seq.

860
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:24,634
Nice to meet you.

861
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:27,720
Dad loved redwoods.

862
01:03:27,803 --> 01:03:29,055
When he escaped the Matrix

863
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,681
and found out
they no longer existed,

864
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:32,266
it almost killed him.

865
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,559
Lucky, he met Mom

866
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:36,062
and here I am.

867
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:39,857
This is Lexy,
Berg and Ellster.

868
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:41,734
Hi.

869
01:03:41,817 --> 01:03:44,403
You knew my grandfather,
Captain Roland.

870
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,948
Roland was your grandfather?

871
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:48,824
He always laughed,

872
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,308
joking how he never
believed in you.

873
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:52,411
But, in private, he said that

874
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,622
you freed his mind
a second time.

875
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:56,749
Uh, not to fanboy out here,

876
01:03:56,832 --> 01:03:58,834
but this is kind
of a huge moment for me.

877
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:01,420
Berg is our resident
Neo-ologist.

878
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,713
A what?

879
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,841
There's a lot of people
out there like me

880
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:08,261
who are a little bit
obsessed with your life.

881
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,512
I would never have recognized

882
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:10,795
your Modal
if it weren't for him.

883
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,125
Whenever
you're feeling up for it,

884
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:14,100
I've got, like,
a million questions.

885
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:16,644
Me too. Starting with them.

886
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:19,021
It's okay.

887
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:21,023
Come meet him.

888
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,400
This is Cybebe.

889
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:23,901
That's Octacles.

890
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:26,654
That's Lumin8.

891
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:28,990
Machines are on our side now?

892
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:30,283
They are synthients.

893
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,034
It's a word
they prefer to "Machines."

894
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,518
Your contact
with the Synthient City

895
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,913
had a huge impact
on their world.

896
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,123
That's what I meant.

897
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,457
What you changed

898
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,221
that nobody believed
could ever be changed.

899
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,547
The meaning of "our side."

900
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:50,177
Cybebe and Octacles
risked their lives

901
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:51,429
to help get you out.

902
01:04:52,888 --> 01:04:53,889
Thank you.

903
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:56,475
But why?

904
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,103
Not all seek to control.

905
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:01,188
Just as not all
wish to be free.

906
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:04,233
What is that?

907
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:06,611
An exomorphic-particle codex.
It's pretty new.

908
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:08,821
It gives programs
access to this world.

909
01:05:08,904 --> 01:05:10,114
Within limits.

910
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:13,200
Limits are the domain
of the limited.

911
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:14,827
Morpheus.

912
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:15,953
Thank you.

913
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:17,455
It was my honor.

914
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:20,499
Wow.

915
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,751
How does it work?

916
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:23,336
Paramagnetic oscillation.

917
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:24,587
If you want,

918
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:25,995
I can download
the codex manual for you.

919
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:28,424
- Sure.
- Downloading used to be fun.

920
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:30,885
Now it's all manuals
and diagnostics.

921
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:32,678
Can I ask them something?

922
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:38,851
When you unplugged me,
there was another pod?

923
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:43,064
Yes. We've analyzed the data.

924
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,608
It could be Trinity.

925
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,027
It's her.

926
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:51,197
I figured we were going
to have this conversation.

927
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,200
Look, you were not
a typical flush-and-grab.

928
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:55,951
You were in this weird tower
that Cybebe

929
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,120
had never accessed,
and she's now exiled.

930
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,581
We burned
our one shot for you.

931
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:02,708
Even if it were Trinity
and she wanted to be free,

932
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,835
we have no idea how to do it.

933
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:05,920
Yet.

934
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:11,217
Nobody believed
we'd ever find him,

935
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,343
but we did.

936
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:16,681
Okay.

937
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:19,892
We don't know
how to get her out... yet.

938
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:24,605
Captain, we're approaching
security clearance.

939
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,066
We're here.

940
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:28,192
Zion?

941
01:06:36,283 --> 01:06:37,743
Have a seat.

942
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,579
This is Hanno.
Best pilot in our fleet.

943
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:41,622
Quite a few synthients

944
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:43,165
deserve that title before me.

945
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:44,417
Mnemosyne, you are cleared

946
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,876
for landing. Welcome home.

947
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,628
Thank you, Control.

948
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:49,296
Um, we're about to crash.

949
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:57,471
General realized we were

950
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,598
never going to beat
the Sentinels, so...

951
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,809
we just got better
at hiding from them.

952
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:07,982
Welcome to Io.

953
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:11,026
Io.

954
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:20,202
Wow. That looks real.

955
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,288
Bio-sky.

956
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,210
Works kind of like
grow lights.

957
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:29,962
It's way more complex
than that.

958
01:07:30,045 --> 01:07:32,506
It pulls water from the crust,
hydronating the air.

959
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:35,926
It balances the ECO
and our SRI cycles.

960
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:38,345
Plus...

961
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,973
it is pretty to look at.

962
01:07:41,056 --> 01:07:42,850
As opposed to that.

963
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:46,729
I guess the general sent us
a welcome party.

964
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:06,415
God damn.

965
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,709
It is you.

966
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:10,753
Niobe?

967
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:16,175
A few more wrinkles
and a few less teeth,

968
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:19,929
but wise enough to know
I don't know anything.

969
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:22,681
I sure as shit
never saw this coming.

970
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:24,683
Neither did I.

971
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,101
I told you he was alive.

972
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:28,145
Captain, you and your crew
have been grounded.

973
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:29,855
General,
if you'd just let me explain.

974
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,566
The protocols are put in place
for everyone's protection.

975
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,527
I'm sorry.
I saw an opportunity

976
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,070
and I was afraid
we'd lose him.

977
01:08:36,153 --> 01:08:38,823
But, General, people have been
waiting for so long.

978
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:41,742
We found The One.

979
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:45,287
I don't believe in The One.

980
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:48,666
I never did.

981
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:50,417
No?

982
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:53,045
Me neither.

983
01:08:53,128 --> 01:08:55,506
But there was a time

984
01:08:55,589 --> 01:08:58,259
when you trusted me
with your ship,

985
01:08:58,342 --> 01:09:00,135
against the Council's orders.

986
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:02,304
The world was different then.

987
01:09:04,139 --> 01:09:05,766
We were different.

988
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,228
Report to the docks.

989
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:11,021
Scrub down the Mnemosyne.

990
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:13,399
Transfer your access codes.

991
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:14,900
You are done, Captain.

992
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:26,412
We need to talk.

993
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:34,295
When word first came

994
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:36,630
that it actually
might be you...

995
01:09:40,384 --> 01:09:44,179
I didn't know how I would feel
in this moment.

996
01:09:52,062 --> 01:09:54,023
It is nice to see you.

997
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:56,817
It's good to see you too.

998
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:05,451
A long way
from Dozer's paint stripper.

999
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:08,495
Yes.

1000
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:10,331
A lot has changed.

1001
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,792
Except maybe you.

1002
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,130
You remember this?

1003
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:27,973
It's so easy to forget
how much noise

1004
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,975
the Matrix pumps
into your head

1005
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,852
until you unplug.

1006
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:34,688
Yeah.

1007
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:37,691
Something else
makes the same kind of noise.

1008
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,985
Takes over every damn thing,

1009
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,779
just like the Matrix.

1010
01:10:43,447 --> 01:10:44,448
War.

1011
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:48,786
I stood at the barricade
of the Temple.

1012
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,873
Staring
at the army of Sentinels,

1013
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:56,627
waiting for them
to kill every one of us.

1014
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:01,173
But then, they left.

1015
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:04,843
They said you saved us.

1016
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,095
I didn't believe it.

1017
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:09,515
Every night I would dream
of attack sirens.

1018
01:11:10,182 --> 01:11:11,433
But then,

1019
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:16,230
I would wake up to this...

1020
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:21,694
silence.

1021
01:11:25,155 --> 01:11:26,699
I'm ashamed of it now.

1022
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:30,786
My pessimism of how long
it took me to believe

1023
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:34,123
a world without war
was possible.

1024
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:37,543
You gave me that.

1025
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:40,504
You gave that gift to us all.

1026
01:11:40,587 --> 01:11:44,258
And it is the gift
that continues to bear fruit.

1027
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,721
Come help me get up.

1028
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:50,556
Let's take a walk.

1029
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,665
Oh! Beautiful.

1030
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:20,711
This is Freya, head of botany.

1031
01:12:20,794 --> 01:12:24,089
And this is Quillion,
our lead digitologist.

1032
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:28,177
I presume our guest
needs no introduction.

1033
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:30,929
Nothing travels
faster than light,

1034
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:32,264
except gossip.

1035
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:36,060
Welcome to the Garden, Neo.

1036
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:39,271
A strawberry?

1037
01:12:39,354 --> 01:12:41,065
Using digital code
from the Matrix,

1038
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:43,567
we retro-convert it
into DNA sequences.

1039
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:45,069
And they grow here?

1040
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:46,779
It's not easy
augmenting the genome

1041
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:49,406
to photosynthesize
Bio-sky, but...

1042
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:51,241
We're getting there.

1043
01:12:51,992 --> 01:12:53,702
Go ahead. Try it.

1044
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,420
We're quite excited
about the blueberries.

1045
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:05,422
You remember that shit
we used to eat?

1046
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:07,883
That slop
that tasted like rust.

1047
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:13,097
Zion could have never
made something like this.

1048
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,807
Why?

1049
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:17,476
Because we needed synthients

1050
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:19,520
and DI like him.

1051
01:13:19,603 --> 01:13:22,981
Zion was stuck in the past.
Stuck in war.

1052
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:25,442
Stuck in a Matrix of its own.

1053
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:29,404
They believed
that it had to be us or them.

1054
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:32,491
This city was built by us

1055
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,243
and them.

1056
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:41,458
What happened to Zion?

1057
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:44,962
I've been waiting
for you to ask that question.

1058
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:50,384
All of the troubles
started in the Machine Cities.

1059
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:54,179
Power plants were unable
to produce enough energy.

1060
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:58,016
Nothing can breed violence
like scarcity.

1061
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:01,353
For the first time,

1062
01:14:01,436 --> 01:14:04,648
we saw machines at war
with one other.

1063
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:11,655
We got word from the Oracle
of a new power rising.

1064
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:16,285
That was the last
we heard from her.

1065
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,331
Morpheus.

1066
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:25,794
After the siege,
he was elected unanimously.

1067
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:28,755
High Chair of the Council.

1068
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:32,259
Oh, how he loved that.

1069
01:14:32,342 --> 01:14:36,555
But as rumors
of this new power spread,

1070
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:38,056
he ignored them.

1071
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:42,769
He was certain what you had
done could not be undone.

1072
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:46,815
All of these people never
stopped believing in miracles,

1073
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,276
believing in you.

1074
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,706
I'm sorry.

1075
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:06,960
How could I know
this would happen?

1076
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:09,338
We didn't understand
all of it back then.

1077
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:11,256
No more than we do now.

1078
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,635
I didn't come here
to cause you problems, Niobe,

1079
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:17,429
but I need your help.

1080
01:15:19,097 --> 01:15:20,557
Trinity is alive.

1081
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:22,392
Then there is
another question.

1082
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:24,269
Why did they keep her alive?

1083
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:25,604
I can't answer that.

1084
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:29,024
But if there's a chance
I can free her,

1085
01:15:29,107 --> 01:15:30,651
I have to try.

1086
01:15:30,734 --> 01:15:34,655
Even if it means endangering
everyone in this city?

1087
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:40,619
I'm sorry, Neo.

1088
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:44,373
I won't let what happened
to Zion happen to Io.

1089
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:47,542
I hope you'll forgive
an old woman

1090
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:50,712
for asking you to go
with Sheperd, here,

1091
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:52,297
till we have
better understanding

1092
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,799
of what's going on.

1093
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:56,927
You're going to imprison me
after I just got free?

1094
01:15:57,010 --> 01:16:00,806
I know it doesn't seem fair,

1095
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:03,684
but neither does growing old.

1096
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:05,894
But you don't
hear me complaining.

1097
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,741
Sorry.

1098
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:21,868
I've never met
a legend before.

1099
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:26,331
Neo.

1100
01:16:27,624 --> 01:16:29,376
Sheperd.

1101
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,587
Crazy. You're real.

1102
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:35,674
"Real."

1103
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:38,760
There's that word again.

1104
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:46,643
People talk a lot
about the old days.

1105
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:48,979
About you, the viral Agent.

1106
01:16:49,062 --> 01:16:51,690
The siege of Zion.

1107
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:53,775
Everything was simpler
back then.

1108
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:56,361
People wanted to be free.

1109
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,365
It's different now.

1110
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:03,910
Sometimes it feels like
people gave up.

1111
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:06,872
Like the Matrix won.

1112
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:11,084
This is you.

1113
01:17:15,088 --> 01:17:17,382
And I gotta ask you one thing.

1114
01:17:19,426 --> 01:17:21,136
Is it true you could fly?

1115
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:26,975
Cool.

1116
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:58,799
Morpheus.

1117
01:17:58,882 --> 01:18:01,802
Oh. General stuck you
in the Rapunzel tower.

1118
01:18:04,262 --> 01:18:05,764
On the upside,
it's a nice view.

1119
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:07,933
What happened to Bugs
and the others?

1120
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:09,800
They're supposed to be
sterilizing the Mnemosyne

1121
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:11,937
- with a toothbrush.
- "Supposed to be"?

1122
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,428
Well, I could tell you
that they're standing by,

1123
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:14,758
waiting for you
to make the choice

1124
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:16,608
to remain meekly incarcerated

1125
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,027
or bust the hell out of here
and go and find Trinity.

1126
01:18:20,612 --> 01:18:21,697
But that ain't a choice.

1127
01:18:34,334 --> 01:18:36,461
General,
what should we do?

1128
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:42,467
Bugs has the same
independence of mind

1129
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,010
she had the day you freed her.

1130
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:47,097
This is not
independence of mind.

1131
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:48,223
It's mutiny.

1132
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:50,809
Come on, 'Be.

1133
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:53,895
I know how much
you hated locking him up.

1134
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:56,690
Just like I know
there's a part of you

1135
01:18:56,773 --> 01:18:59,818
that's relieved now
that he's gone.

1136
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:05,115
We've worked so hard
to keep Io safe.

1137
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:09,494
This scares me.

1138
01:19:20,046 --> 01:19:21,339
That's her.

1139
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:22,549
On the bridge.

1140
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:24,092
Got her.

1141
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,020
It's sick
how the Semblance works.

1142
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:37,856
You see flashes
of the real her, but...

1143
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:39,566
the way she reads...

1144
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:43,904
Code-wise,
she's pure bluepill.

1145
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:48,867
This is a tough question, Neo,
but it has to be asked.

1146
01:19:49,993 --> 01:19:52,162
What if she's happy
where she is?

1147
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:54,873
How did I read?

1148
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:58,877
Exactly like her.

1149
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,883
Take us to broadcast depth.

1150
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:17,646
Thank you for helping me.

1151
01:20:19,272 --> 01:20:21,274
Most of us are here
because of you.

1152
01:20:23,944 --> 01:20:25,070
I also admit our only chance

1153
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:26,571
to get out
of the general's doghouse

1154
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:28,281
is for you to find your mojo.

1155
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:32,577
What if I can't be
what I once was?

1156
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,747
Then we're all fucked.

1157
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:37,207
Two minutes.

1158
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:38,667
Two minutes to broadcast.

1159
01:20:47,842 --> 01:20:49,322
I slipped you in
through a hotel room.

1160
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:52,472
Should be safe.

1161
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:04,776
Portal's open.

1162
01:21:04,859 --> 01:21:07,060
Closest I could get you is
the warehouse near her garage.

1163
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:08,613
Whole zone's
crawling with bots.

1164
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:11,533
Let's go.

1165
01:21:38,768 --> 01:21:41,896
So, what do you think of him?

1166
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:44,774
I was kinda worried at first
because he's so much older.

1167
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:47,360
The beard, the hair... Oh.

1168
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:50,864
- No, totally works for me.
- You idiot.

1169
01:21:50,947 --> 01:21:52,324
I mean "The One" thing.

1170
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:56,953
You know, everyone that
shipped with him died.

1171
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:59,831
Oh, yeah. He's gonna
get us all killed, for sure.

1172
01:22:05,211 --> 01:22:06,755
Predictable as ever.

1173
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:10,759
Smith.

1174
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:13,178
Smith? As in, "the" Smith?

1175
01:22:21,311 --> 01:22:22,604
This is so insane.

1176
01:22:22,687 --> 01:22:24,012
There's so many theories
about the two of them

1177
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:25,690
and they're standing
right there.

1178
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:27,359
This code is freaky!

1179
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:30,320
He's like an Agent, but not.

1180
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:36,076
An appeal to reason.

1181
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:41,790
How did you find us?

1182
01:22:41,873 --> 01:22:44,793
You never appreciated
our relationship.

1183
01:22:44,876 --> 01:22:46,252
Not like The Analyst.

1184
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:48,254
- The what?
- My doctor.

1185
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:52,050
He used our bond
and turned it into a chain.

1186
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:53,802
It's so obvious
once you see it, right?

1187
01:22:53,885 --> 01:22:57,305
But this whole altered-code
update really blew my mind.

1188
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:59,391
I still don't know
how he did it.

1189
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:02,268
You, as a balding nerd.

1190
01:23:02,352 --> 01:23:04,104
Hilarious.

1191
01:23:04,187 --> 01:23:06,564
And me...

1192
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:09,317
even more perfect.

1193
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:11,403
Maybe a little too far
on the piercing blue eyes.

1194
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:13,405
What do you think?

1195
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:15,448
What do you want, Smith?

1196
01:23:17,617 --> 01:23:19,911
I have such dreams, Tom.

1197
01:23:19,994 --> 01:23:21,705
Big dreams.

1198
01:23:21,788 --> 01:23:24,541
Well, mostly just extremely
violent revenge fantasies,

1199
01:23:24,624 --> 01:23:26,042
but in order for me
to pursue mine,

1200
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:28,169
I need to dissuade you
from pursuing yours.

1201
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:31,881
Hmm. Sounds like conflict.

1202
01:23:33,591 --> 01:23:35,135
Inevitable?

1203
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:37,679
Doesn't have to be.

1204
01:23:37,762 --> 01:23:39,931
All you have to do
is stay out of the Matrix,

1205
01:23:40,014 --> 01:23:41,516
and leave
the good doctor to me.

1206
01:23:41,599 --> 01:23:43,935
You can have him.
I'm here for Trinity.

1207
01:23:44,018 --> 01:23:45,520
That's the trouble, Tom.

1208
01:23:45,603 --> 01:23:48,273
He knew you'd come,
just like I did.

1209
01:23:50,024 --> 01:23:51,234
Trust me.

1210
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:53,737
You're not ready for him.

1211
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:56,614
Captain, I'm reading portals
from the lower frequencies.

1212
01:24:01,911 --> 01:24:05,081
I won't have his leash
on my neck again.

1213
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:14,799
I found some
old acquaintances of yours.

1214
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:19,220
Bugs!

1215
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:33,943
Exiles.

1216
01:24:34,027 --> 01:24:35,227
I thought
they were all purged.

1217
01:24:35,278 --> 01:24:36,780
You?

1218
01:24:36,863 --> 01:24:37,989
Oh!

1219
01:24:38,072 --> 01:24:40,408
It is you!

1220
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:45,330
All these years.
I can't believe it.

1221
01:24:45,997 --> 01:24:47,665
Oh, God.

1222
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:51,711
You stole my life!

1223
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:58,009
What the Merv
is trying to say,

1224
01:24:58,092 --> 01:25:00,553
is that their situation
is a little bit like mine.

1225
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:02,847
To have their lives back,
yours has to end.

1226
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:07,602
Kill him!

1227
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:23,284
You ruined

1228
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:26,496
every suck-my-silky-ass thing!

1229
01:25:26,579 --> 01:25:29,165
We had grace.

1230
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:35,755
We had style!

1231
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:37,841
We had conversation!

1232
01:25:37,924 --> 01:25:39,884
Not this...

1233
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:07,954
Art, films,
books were all better!

1234
01:26:08,037 --> 01:26:11,249
Originality mattered!

1235
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:13,251
You gave us
Face-Zucker-suck

1236
01:26:13,334 --> 01:26:16,796
and Cock-me-climatey-
Wiki-piss-and-shit!

1237
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:04,510
I still know kung fu.

1238
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:07,388
Neo!

1239
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:38,586
Just like old times.

1240
01:28:36,227 --> 01:28:37,270
Neo.

1241
01:28:39,188 --> 01:28:41,858
I've been thinking
about us, Tom.

1242
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:45,236
Look how binary is the form,
the nature of things.

1243
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:47,780
Ones and zeros.

1244
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:50,116
Light and dark.

1245
01:28:52,243 --> 01:28:54,287
Choice and its absence.

1246
01:28:57,665 --> 01:28:59,917
Anderson and Smith.

1247
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:38,748
You've lost something, Tom.

1248
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:44,545
You're not
what you used to be.

1249
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:46,881
It's true.

1250
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:02,230
- Nice one.
- Thanks.

1251
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:11,280
Come on, Neo.

1252
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:38,808
Captain. You okay?

1253
01:30:38,891 --> 01:30:41,853
Yeah. Where's Neo?

1254
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:43,062
Smith is killing him.

1255
01:30:43,146 --> 01:30:44,522
Where?

1256
01:30:52,029 --> 01:30:54,031
I feel bad about this, Tom.

1257
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:58,744
After all, you are the one
who set me free...

1258
01:31:00,037 --> 01:31:01,038
again.

1259
01:31:03,082 --> 01:31:04,167
So, you, more than anyone,

1260
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:05,877
understands why
I can't go back.

1261
01:31:08,462 --> 01:31:10,256
You should have
listened to me.

1262
01:31:12,466 --> 01:31:14,218
Now you'll never
see her again.

1263
01:31:27,815 --> 01:31:28,983
What was that?

1264
01:31:29,066 --> 01:31:30,443
That was Neo.

1265
01:31:32,069 --> 01:31:33,070
Mojo rising.

1266
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:42,580
You all right?

1267
01:31:42,663 --> 01:31:44,165
Yeah.

1268
01:31:44,248 --> 01:31:45,448
It's gonna trigger a response.

1269
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:46,709
I got multiple exits ready.

1270
01:31:46,792 --> 01:31:48,252
This is not over yet!

1271
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:51,047
Our sequel franchise spinoff!

1272
01:31:58,095 --> 01:31:59,513
We should go.

1273
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:00,765
I can't.

1274
01:32:00,848 --> 01:32:02,767
I have to talk to her.

1275
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:05,102
Neo, those Exiles
were older than you,

1276
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:06,270
and we barely handled them.

1277
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:11,400
You really wanna do this now?

1278
01:32:16,822 --> 01:32:18,032
I mean...

1279
01:32:22,036 --> 01:32:23,621
you look like shit.

1280
01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:37,426
Oh, my God. What?
What happened?

1281
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:38,636
An accident.

1282
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,055
Kush! Call a doctor.

1283
01:32:41,138 --> 01:32:42,682
It's fine.

1284
01:32:43,599 --> 01:32:45,726
I don't have a lot of time.

1285
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:47,520
I wasn't sure
I'd see you again.

1286
01:32:47,603 --> 01:32:50,189
After we spoke, I realized...

1287
01:32:51,065 --> 01:32:53,109
my life wasn't a life.

1288
01:32:54,568 --> 01:32:57,321
At some point,
I think I gave up

1289
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:59,657
searching for something real.

1290
01:33:05,997 --> 01:33:07,290
Wait.

1291
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:11,335
Something happened.

1292
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:13,796
I looked for you
at the coffee shop.

1293
01:33:15,589 --> 01:33:17,925
I began to wonder
if I imagined you.

1294
01:33:19,093 --> 01:33:21,637
And then last night
I had a dream.

1295
01:33:21,721 --> 01:33:24,515
In the dream, you were
surrounded by police,

1296
01:33:24,598 --> 01:33:27,143
then they started chasing us.

1297
01:33:27,226 --> 01:33:30,229
- Us?
- You were on my bike with me.

1298
01:33:32,398 --> 01:33:33,774
How did it end?

1299
01:33:35,192 --> 01:33:36,360
Not good.

1300
01:33:38,904 --> 01:33:42,325
I've had dreams
that weren't just dreams.

1301
01:33:42,408 --> 01:33:44,660
You mean a dream
that came true?

1302
01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:54,962
Finally, we can talk
like adults.

1303
01:33:56,630 --> 01:33:59,759
I hate lying. I do.
It exhausts me.

1304
01:34:01,552 --> 01:34:03,637
Tiff and I have been
waiting for you...

1305
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:04,972
like, forever.

1306
01:34:12,063 --> 01:34:13,356
Deja vu, right?

1307
01:34:15,149 --> 01:34:17,318
Oh, no use.
You can't beat time.

1308
01:34:17,401 --> 01:34:21,113
This rewind is happening
faster than you can blink.

1309
01:34:25,993 --> 01:34:27,995
You gave me the idea.

1310
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:34,126
Allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word.

1311
01:34:37,171 --> 01:34:38,297
"Bullet time."

1312
01:34:40,132 --> 01:34:42,093
I know. Kind of ironic,

1313
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:46,097
using the power that
defined you to control you.

1314
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:48,808
I kept such a close eye on you

1315
01:34:48,891 --> 01:34:51,435
and still you found a way out.

1316
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:53,896
Clever monkey,
using that Modal.

1317
01:34:54,855 --> 01:34:56,023
Call me an optimist,

1318
01:34:56,107 --> 01:34:58,275
but this could
all be for the best.

1319
01:34:58,359 --> 01:35:01,195
The skin's not looking
too bad this time.

1320
01:35:01,278 --> 01:35:03,906
I know some of this will be
difficult for you to hear,

1321
01:35:03,989 --> 01:35:05,449
after everything
you went through.

1322
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:06,909
All that pain and suffering,

1323
01:35:06,992 --> 01:35:09,829
only to learn the world
doesn't end when you do.

1324
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:12,456
Surprise.

1325
01:35:18,462 --> 01:35:19,880
I was there when you died.

1326
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:23,509
I said to myself,

1327
01:35:23,592 --> 01:35:26,804
"Here is the anomaly
of anomalies."

1328
01:35:26,887 --> 01:35:29,682
What an extraordinary
opportunity.

1329
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:32,810
First, I had to convince
the Suits

1330
01:35:32,893 --> 01:35:34,311
to let me rebuild
the two of you.

1331
01:35:34,395 --> 01:35:35,980
Why her? Getting there.

1332
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:37,857
And don't worry,
she can't hear me.

1333
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:41,068
Resurrecting you both
was crazy expensive.

1334
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:42,486
Like renovating a house.

1335
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:44,822
Took twice as long,
cost twice as much.

1336
01:35:48,909 --> 01:35:51,370
I thought you'd be happy
to be alive again.

1337
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:53,664
So wrong.

1338
01:35:55,458 --> 01:35:59,086
Did you know hope and despair
are nearly identical in code?

1339
01:36:01,088 --> 01:36:03,048
We worked for years,

1340
01:36:03,132 --> 01:36:04,759
trying to activate
your source code.

1341
01:36:04,842 --> 01:36:08,262
I was about to give up,
when I realized...

1342
01:36:11,348 --> 01:36:12,391
Trinity.

1343
01:36:12,475 --> 01:36:14,643
...it was never just you.

1344
01:36:14,727 --> 01:36:17,813
Alone, neither of you
is of any particular value.

1345
01:36:19,523 --> 01:36:20,691
Like acids and bases,

1346
01:36:20,774 --> 01:36:23,152
you're dangerous
when mixed together.

1347
01:36:23,235 --> 01:36:26,197
Every sim
where you two bonded...

1348
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,365
Let's just say
bad things happened.

1349
01:36:30,409 --> 01:36:31,869
Neo!

1350
01:36:36,123 --> 01:36:39,502
However, as long as I managed
to keep you close,

1351
01:36:39,585 --> 01:36:41,253
but not too close,

1352
01:36:41,337 --> 01:36:44,548
I discovered
something incredible.

1353
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:48,135
Now, my predecessor
loved precision.

1354
01:36:48,219 --> 01:36:51,889
His Matrix was all fussy facts
and equations.

1355
01:36:51,972 --> 01:36:53,724
He hated the human mind.

1356
01:36:53,807 --> 01:36:55,226
So he never bothered
to realize

1357
01:36:55,309 --> 01:36:56,550
that you don't give a shit
about facts.

1358
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:57,978
It's all about fiction.

1359
01:36:58,062 --> 01:37:02,733
The only world that matters
is the one in here.

1360
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:05,819
And you people
believe the craziest shit.

1361
01:37:06,362 --> 01:37:07,613
Why?

1362
01:37:07,696 --> 01:37:10,282
What validates
and makes your fictions real?

1363
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:12,326
Feelings.

1364
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:14,954
Allow me.

1365
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:17,998
Kush, here,
is one of my handlers.

1366
01:37:18,082 --> 01:37:19,416
They're everywhere.

1367
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,086
Such a pain, cloning Agents
over a coppertop.

1368
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:24,630
Far more effective
just to saturate a population.

1369
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:29,426
And, bonus,
swarm mode is sick fun.

1370
01:37:41,855 --> 01:37:44,984
Ooh! Nicely done.

1371
01:37:46,443 --> 01:37:49,697
You ever wonder
why you have nightmares?

1372
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:52,741
Why your own brain
tortures you?

1373
01:37:52,825 --> 01:37:56,328
It's actually us,
maximizing your output.

1374
01:37:56,412 --> 01:37:57,580
It works just like this.

1375
01:37:57,663 --> 01:38:00,291
Oh, no!
Can you stop the bullet?

1376
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:03,294
If only you could move faster.

1377
01:38:03,377 --> 01:38:05,921
Here's the thing
about feelings.

1378
01:38:06,005 --> 01:38:08,299
They're so much easier
to control than facts.

1379
01:38:09,258 --> 01:38:11,135
Turns out, in my Matrix,

1380
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:14,680
the worse we treat you,
the more we manipulate you,

1381
01:38:14,763 --> 01:38:17,224
the more energy you produce.

1382
01:38:17,308 --> 01:38:19,518
It's nuts.

1383
01:38:19,602 --> 01:38:21,186
I've been setting
productivity records

1384
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:22,563
every year since I took over.

1385
01:38:22,646 --> 01:38:25,482
And, the best part,
zero resistance.

1386
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:26,942
People stay in their pods,

1387
01:38:27,026 --> 01:38:30,112
happier than pigs in shit.

1388
01:38:30,195 --> 01:38:31,405
The key to it all?

1389
01:38:31,488 --> 01:38:32,823
You.

1390
01:38:32,906 --> 01:38:34,074
And her.

1391
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:36,368
Quietly yearning
for what you don't have,

1392
01:38:36,452 --> 01:38:38,871
while dreading
losing what you do.

1393
01:38:38,954 --> 01:38:40,623
For 99.9% of your race,

1394
01:38:40,706 --> 01:38:43,375
that is the definition
of reality.

1395
01:38:43,459 --> 01:38:46,337
Desire and fear, baby.

1396
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:49,381
Just give the people
what they want, right?

1397
01:38:58,682 --> 01:39:01,727
She's the only home
you have, Thomas.

1398
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:05,105
Come home before
something terrible happens.

1399
01:39:15,532 --> 01:39:16,825
- Bugs!
- I hear him.

1400
01:39:23,207 --> 01:39:24,375
Trinity!

1401
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:26,168
- You shouldn't call me that.
- I'm sorry.

1402
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:28,921
I have to go.

1403
01:39:29,004 --> 01:39:30,172
But I'll be back.

1404
01:39:31,298 --> 01:39:33,592
Neo! Time to go.

1405
01:39:36,095 --> 01:39:37,805
- Sentinels?
- Worse.

1406
01:39:39,264 --> 01:39:40,349
General ordered me

1407
01:39:40,432 --> 01:39:41,433
to look after the ship.

1408
01:39:41,517 --> 01:39:43,394
So you shadowed us?

1409
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:45,062
Check your long-range scans.

1410
01:39:45,145 --> 01:39:47,147
Squids are combing this area.

1411
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:48,691
He's right.

1412
01:39:48,774 --> 01:39:49,942
You can stay here and die,

1413
01:39:50,025 --> 01:39:52,403
or come back
and face a court-martial.

1414
01:39:52,486 --> 01:39:54,488
And you call that a choice?

1415
01:40:01,704 --> 01:40:03,831
Sheperd should have
left you to the Squids.

1416
01:40:03,914 --> 01:40:07,292
I'm too damn old to sit
through some boring-ass trial.

1417
01:40:07,376 --> 01:40:08,585
Niobe, don't blame Bugs.

1418
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:10,587
Do shut your mouth.

1419
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:12,965
Do address me as General.

1420
01:40:13,048 --> 01:40:17,302
And do not rob
my ex-captain of her agency,

1421
01:40:17,386 --> 01:40:19,388
which she exercised
with her own

1422
01:40:19,471 --> 01:40:22,975
particular brand
of shortsighted stupidity.

1423
01:40:24,226 --> 01:40:25,310
Shortsighted?

1424
01:40:26,979 --> 01:40:30,941
You care more about
growing fruit than freeing minds.

1425
01:40:31,024 --> 01:40:33,527
We are not going
to have this argument again.

1426
01:40:33,610 --> 01:40:35,946
It's not an argument.
It's a fact.

1427
01:40:36,029 --> 01:40:37,239
You gave up on people.

1428
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:41,034
I tell you
what I'm going to give up on

1429
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:42,202
and it's you!

1430
01:40:44,621 --> 01:40:46,540
Sheperd, get her
out of my sight!

1431
01:40:46,623 --> 01:40:47,750
General...

1432
01:40:49,668 --> 01:40:50,753
Disarm!

1433
01:40:50,836 --> 01:40:52,463
Kujaku's a friend.

1434
01:40:59,011 --> 01:41:00,637
Hello, friend.

1435
01:41:03,223 --> 01:41:04,224
Okay.

1436
01:41:05,559 --> 01:41:06,769
Him?

1437
01:41:13,692 --> 01:41:15,360
General.

1438
01:41:15,444 --> 01:41:16,737
Thank you for seeing me.

1439
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:18,614
I figured if there was anyone

1440
01:41:18,697 --> 01:41:20,991
who could make sense
of this mess,

1441
01:41:21,074 --> 01:41:22,868
it would be you.

1442
01:41:22,951 --> 01:41:24,077
Hello, Neo.

1443
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:25,996
I know you.

1444
01:41:26,079 --> 01:41:28,081
I tried to keep my eye on you.

1445
01:41:31,418 --> 01:41:32,669
Why?

1446
01:41:32,753 --> 01:41:34,505
We met a long time ago.

1447
01:41:36,215 --> 01:41:37,299
Good morning.

1448
01:41:40,093 --> 01:41:41,094
Sati.

1449
01:41:41,178 --> 01:41:43,680
My father knew
we'd meet again,

1450
01:41:43,764 --> 01:41:46,725
though he would have wished
for happier circumstances.

1451
01:41:46,809 --> 01:41:48,602
His inadvertent role
in what happened to you

1452
01:41:48,685 --> 01:41:50,938
was the greatest regret
of his life.

1453
01:41:51,021 --> 01:41:52,898
I don't understand.

1454
01:41:54,274 --> 01:41:55,943
My father
was the chief engineer

1455
01:41:56,026 --> 01:41:57,277
at the Anomaleum.

1456
01:41:57,361 --> 01:41:58,737
The what?

1457
01:41:58,821 --> 01:42:01,907
My father designed
the resurrection pods

1458
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:03,909
where Neo and Trinity
were imprisoned.

1459
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:07,204
I'm sorry.

1460
01:42:07,287 --> 01:42:08,789
You knew what happened to him?

1461
01:42:08,872 --> 01:42:12,084
You knew that he and Trinity
both were alive...

1462
01:42:13,085 --> 01:42:14,378
and you didn't tell me?

1463
01:42:14,461 --> 01:42:17,381
There were times
I doubted my decision, Niobe.

1464
01:42:17,464 --> 01:42:19,091
But Io needed you.

1465
01:42:19,174 --> 01:42:20,509
This city needed to be built

1466
01:42:20,592 --> 01:42:22,636
for your people
as well as mine.

1467
01:42:23,804 --> 01:42:25,556
If I would have
told you everything,

1468
01:42:25,639 --> 01:42:27,808
you would have had a very
difficult choice to make.

1469
01:42:27,891 --> 01:42:29,476
My friends

1470
01:42:30,811 --> 01:42:33,313
let me make my own choices.

1471
01:42:33,397 --> 01:42:35,315
If it was a mistake,

1472
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:37,484
you have my deepest apologies.

1473
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:40,904
Why are you here now?

1474
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:43,490
Neo's escape has
destabilized the Matrix.

1475
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:44,825
The Anomaleum
draws its current

1476
01:42:44,908 --> 01:42:46,243
from Trinity alone now.

1477
01:42:46,326 --> 01:42:48,495
A fail-safe has been
triggered to reset

1478
01:42:48,579 --> 01:42:50,581
the Matrix back
to the previous version.

1479
01:42:50,664 --> 01:42:52,457
But The Analyst
halted the reset.

1480
01:42:52,541 --> 01:42:53,834
He's convinced the authorities

1481
01:42:53,917 --> 01:42:55,878
that you will soon
return voluntarily.

1482
01:42:57,004 --> 01:42:58,922
And why would he say that?

1483
01:42:59,006 --> 01:43:02,092
Because if I don't go back,
he'll kill Trinity.

1484
01:43:04,845 --> 01:43:07,222
Faced with returning
to your pod

1485
01:43:07,306 --> 01:43:10,100
or enduring
Trinity's death again.

1486
01:43:10,183 --> 01:43:11,476
What would you choose, Neo?

1487
01:43:12,561 --> 01:43:13,854
I'll go back.

1488
01:43:15,564 --> 01:43:17,774
Well, The Analyst
knows you well,

1489
01:43:17,858 --> 01:43:20,611
but that knowledge
has made him incautious.

1490
01:43:20,694 --> 01:43:22,362
After you escaped,

1491
01:43:22,446 --> 01:43:25,282
he should have accepted his
losses and devacuated Trinity.

1492
01:43:25,365 --> 01:43:28,243
But that would have prevented
this extraordinary opportunity

1493
01:43:28,327 --> 01:43:30,245
that now exists before us.

1494
01:43:30,913 --> 01:43:33,832
A few hours ago,

1495
01:43:33,916 --> 01:43:37,210
no one would have been able
to convince me

1496
01:43:37,294 --> 01:43:41,590
that I would be standing here,
trying to explain a mission

1497
01:43:41,673 --> 01:43:43,634
as crazy as this one.

1498
01:43:47,429 --> 01:43:49,056
What are you doing?

1499
01:43:49,139 --> 01:43:50,682
- Volunteering.
- Oh, no.

1500
01:43:50,766 --> 01:43:55,312
You are the one captain
that I am ordering to go.

1501
01:43:55,395 --> 01:43:56,980
Now you don't
have to order me, General,

1502
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:58,732
'cause I'm volunteering.

1503
01:44:02,110 --> 01:44:03,654
I need two more.

1504
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:10,994
Are you out of your minds?

1505
01:44:11,078 --> 01:44:12,955
You don't even know
what it is.

1506
01:44:13,038 --> 01:44:15,958
General, we know you.

1507
01:44:16,041 --> 01:44:17,250
If you say this is important,

1508
01:44:17,334 --> 01:44:19,378
none of us is
choosing to stay home.

1509
01:44:24,758 --> 01:44:25,842
Thank you.

1510
01:44:30,931 --> 01:44:32,933
Knuckle up, and good luck.

1511
01:45:02,963 --> 01:45:04,464
Trinity is held
in the Anomaleum,

1512
01:45:04,548 --> 01:45:06,299
which is in this
transmission tower.

1513
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:08,635
The passages used
to rescue Neo are now sealed

1514
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:10,929
and a legion of Sentinels
patrols the tower.

1515
01:45:11,013 --> 01:45:13,056
So, stealth will be paramount.

1516
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:14,891
As long as we raise no alarms,

1517
01:45:14,975 --> 01:45:17,060
this first part of the mission
should be the easiest.

1518
01:45:17,144 --> 01:45:18,468
You mean
crossing the Fetus Fields,

1519
01:45:18,478 --> 01:45:20,230
sneaking across
an entire power plant,

1520
01:45:20,313 --> 01:45:21,732
climbing
a two-kilometer tower

1521
01:45:21,815 --> 01:45:23,650
guarded by thousands
of Sentinels?

1522
01:45:23,734 --> 01:45:24,901
That's the easy part?

1523
01:45:24,985 --> 01:45:26,653
Exactly so.

1524
01:45:26,737 --> 01:45:29,072
Because all we have to do
is convince someone

1525
01:45:29,156 --> 01:45:30,824
who does this every day

1526
01:45:30,907 --> 01:45:32,325
to take one of us along.

1527
01:45:55,849 --> 01:45:57,684
Fifty meters
below the Anomaleum

1528
01:45:57,768 --> 01:45:59,269
is a stratum
of amniotic filters.

1529
01:45:59,352 --> 01:46:02,773
Hidden along this edge
is a small hexagonal vent.

1530
01:46:02,856 --> 01:46:06,026
This vent feeds the air intake
into the corpuscular modifier,

1531
01:46:06,109 --> 01:46:09,196
which oxygenates
the bio-gel used in Neo's pod.

1532
01:46:09,863 --> 01:46:11,073
I get it.

1533
01:46:11,156 --> 01:46:14,034
The exomorph slinkies up
Neo's old umbilicus.

1534
01:46:15,285 --> 01:46:16,411
What could go wrong?

1535
01:47:03,291 --> 01:47:04,668
Once inside,

1536
01:47:04,751 --> 01:47:06,586
Morpheus will use
the System Operator

1537
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:09,005
to open the devacuator line
and disengage the macerators.

1538
01:47:13,093 --> 01:47:14,678
In order to unplug
Trinity's body,

1539
01:47:14,761 --> 01:47:16,972
while her mind still remains
connected to the Matrix,

1540
01:47:17,055 --> 01:47:18,682
I'm gonna need
a second human brain

1541
01:47:18,765 --> 01:47:19,975
to implement the bypass.

1542
01:47:20,058 --> 01:47:21,685
And since Neo
must be with The Analyst,

1543
01:47:21,768 --> 01:47:24,938
the only available mind
that's a near-enough match

1544
01:47:25,021 --> 01:47:26,064
is yours.

1545
01:47:27,607 --> 01:47:28,525
Figures.

1546
01:47:46,042 --> 01:47:47,169
Thanks, Cybebe.

1547
01:47:55,385 --> 01:47:57,387
Does Trinity still have
to take the red pill?

1548
01:47:57,470 --> 01:47:58,889
Since Kujaku and I
are transferring

1549
01:47:58,972 --> 01:48:00,265
her consciousness
onto the ship,

1550
01:48:00,348 --> 01:48:02,017
it's not strictly necessary.

1551
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:06,021
But what matters is that
this is her choice.

1552
01:48:06,104 --> 01:48:09,399
Extracting a confused
or an uncertain mind will,

1553
01:48:09,482 --> 01:48:10,859
in all probability, kill her.

1554
01:48:10,942 --> 01:48:13,486
But even if it is
what she wants,

1555
01:48:13,570 --> 01:48:17,240
won't The Analyst just order
the Sentinels to stop you?

1556
01:48:17,324 --> 01:48:18,825
He will.

1557
01:48:18,909 --> 01:48:21,369
But if my plan works,
it won't matter.

1558
01:48:21,453 --> 01:48:22,412
Why?

1559
01:48:22,495 --> 01:48:24,122
Because we'll already be gone.

1560
01:48:25,832 --> 01:48:27,751
Somebody thinks
this hard about a plan,

1561
01:48:27,834 --> 01:48:29,252
there has to be a reason why.

1562
01:48:31,463 --> 01:48:32,672
When my father realized

1563
01:48:32,756 --> 01:48:35,008
how the Anomaleum
was going to be used,

1564
01:48:35,091 --> 01:48:38,553
he covertly transferred
the designs to me.

1565
01:48:38,637 --> 01:48:41,139
The Analyst
discovered his betrayal

1566
01:48:41,223 --> 01:48:43,099
and had my parents purged.

1567
01:48:45,727 --> 01:48:48,730
I would have been murdered too
if it wasn't for Kujaku.

1568
01:48:51,775 --> 01:48:55,779
Not a day goes by
that I don't grieve them.

1569
01:48:55,862 --> 01:48:58,990
I've been praying for this day
for a very long time.

1570
01:49:07,082 --> 01:49:08,625
We're coming up on broadcast.

1571
01:49:11,211 --> 01:49:15,215
I thought you should know
that I'm here because of her.

1572
01:49:18,718 --> 01:49:21,096
All I ever wanted was to be
as fearless as Trinity.

1573
01:49:23,306 --> 01:49:26,726
But I saw how she reacted
in the garage, and I...

1574
01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:29,437
You're wondering if I'm wrong.

1575
01:49:29,521 --> 01:49:31,064
What if we're too late?

1576
01:49:32,857 --> 01:49:34,567
What if she's not
Trinity anymore?

1577
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:42,742
I never believed
I was The One.

1578
01:49:43,618 --> 01:49:45,036
But she did.

1579
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:47,706
She believed in me.

1580
01:49:50,375 --> 01:49:52,585
It's my turn
to believe in her.

1581
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:19,487
This is
where it gets tricky.

1582
01:50:30,623 --> 01:50:33,043
Have you ever done
an operation like this?

1583
01:50:33,752 --> 01:50:34,836
Not yet.

1584
01:50:56,566 --> 01:50:57,901
Here we go.

1585
01:51:15,543 --> 01:51:17,462
Welcome home.

1586
01:51:17,545 --> 01:51:19,923
All I want is to talk to her.

1587
01:51:20,006 --> 01:51:21,633
Do you mean Tiff?

1588
01:51:21,716 --> 01:51:24,469
Come back, and you can
talk to her as often as you like.

1589
01:51:24,552 --> 01:51:25,929
I mean, handsome Chad

1590
01:51:26,012 --> 01:51:27,472
may have something
to say about it.

1591
01:51:27,555 --> 01:51:30,850
If she tells me
this is what she wants,

1592
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:33,228
you win.

1593
01:51:33,311 --> 01:51:34,437
Really?

1594
01:51:34,521 --> 01:51:37,273
But if she wants me,

1595
01:51:37,357 --> 01:51:39,192
then you'll let us go free.

1596
01:51:39,275 --> 01:51:42,028
And why would I do something
as stupid as that?

1597
01:51:42,112 --> 01:51:44,906
Right now, I'm on a ship full
of people who will unplug me

1598
01:51:44,989 --> 01:51:47,992
before they'll let you
take me back.

1599
01:51:48,076 --> 01:51:50,120
If you want this Matrix,

1600
01:51:50,203 --> 01:51:51,746
this is your only chance.

1601
01:51:51,830 --> 01:51:54,791
But how do I know
they won't unplug you anyway?

1602
01:51:54,874 --> 01:51:58,211
Same way I know you'll let us
walk out of here.

1603
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:25,488
Okay.

1604
01:52:25,572 --> 01:52:27,073
I like tests.

1605
01:52:27,949 --> 01:52:29,742
We'll let Tiff decide.

1606
01:52:47,093 --> 01:52:48,261
That's it.

1607
01:52:49,471 --> 01:52:51,014
Bypass is ready.

1608
01:52:51,097 --> 01:52:52,807
Now what?

1609
01:52:52,891 --> 01:52:54,142
We wait.

1610
01:52:54,225 --> 01:52:56,186
Doesn't it seem crazy
to come all this way

1611
01:52:56,269 --> 01:52:57,854
and leave her here?

1612
01:52:57,937 --> 01:53:00,607
We must abide by her decision.

1613
01:53:00,690 --> 01:53:02,275
And if she says no,

1614
01:53:03,109 --> 01:53:04,569
what happens to Neo?

1615
01:53:04,652 --> 01:53:05,862
At this time,

1616
01:53:05,945 --> 01:53:08,781
the most important choice
of Neo's life

1617
01:53:08,865 --> 01:53:10,366
is not his to make.

1618
01:53:41,397 --> 01:53:43,191
I saw this in my dream.

1619
01:53:44,651 --> 01:53:48,112
If I was the Oracle,
maybe I could explain it.

1620
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:50,365
The Oracle.

1621
01:53:50,448 --> 01:53:52,116
From your game?

1622
01:53:53,993 --> 01:53:56,246
It's not a game.

1623
01:53:58,373 --> 01:53:59,582
Oh, God.

1624
01:54:07,048 --> 01:54:10,468
After you left, I went home

1625
01:54:10,552 --> 01:54:12,262
and I played it.

1626
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:17,100
I kept thinking,

1627
01:54:17,183 --> 01:54:20,520
why does this story
feel like a memory?

1628
01:54:27,694 --> 01:54:29,445
There's a part of me

1629
01:54:32,031 --> 01:54:35,243
that feels like I have been
waiting my whole life for you.

1630
01:54:38,204 --> 01:54:40,456
And that part is like,

1631
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:44,252
"What the hell
took you so long?"

1632
01:54:44,335 --> 01:54:46,379
I don't have an easy answer.

1633
01:54:48,548 --> 01:54:50,717
Maybe I was afraid of this.

1634
01:54:52,176 --> 01:54:54,053
Afraid of what might happen.

1635
01:54:55,555 --> 01:54:58,558
Afraid of hurting
the only person I ever loved.

1636
01:55:00,268 --> 01:55:03,813
I wish I was
who you think I am.

1637
01:55:05,189 --> 01:55:06,774
But look at me.

1638
01:55:08,067 --> 01:55:10,236
I can't be her.

1639
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:12,447
- Mom!
- Mom! Come on.

1640
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:13,781
- Mom!
- It's Callie.

1641
01:55:13,865 --> 01:55:14,866
Is this real?

1642
01:55:14,949 --> 01:55:16,117
You have to come with us.

1643
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:17,577
Come on,
we gotta go.

1644
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:19,235
Tiff, hey. Don't know
what's going on here,

1645
01:55:19,245 --> 01:55:20,580
but I'm glad we found you.

1646
01:55:20,663 --> 01:55:22,030
- She got hit by a car!
- I know, it's crazy.

1647
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:23,166
She was chasing after you.

1648
01:55:23,249 --> 01:55:24,657
They're casting her arm.
We gotta go.

1649
01:55:24,667 --> 01:55:26,044
Doctor said
she's gonna be fine.

1650
01:55:26,127 --> 01:55:27,920
You have to come
with us to the hospital.

1651
01:55:28,004 --> 01:55:29,088
It's too late.

1652
01:55:29,172 --> 01:55:30,381
I understand.

1653
01:55:30,465 --> 01:55:32,300
- Tiff, come on, let's go.
- Come on.

1654
01:55:38,806 --> 01:55:39,891
What's happening?

1655
01:55:41,976 --> 01:55:43,102
Neo was wrong.

1656
01:56:16,469 --> 01:56:17,553
Tiffany.

1657
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:23,685
Tiffany, you have
to come with us.

1658
01:56:25,311 --> 01:56:26,688
Tiffany!

1659
01:56:28,981 --> 01:56:32,694
I wish you would
fucking stop calling me that.

1660
01:56:32,777 --> 01:56:34,320
I hate that name.

1661
01:56:35,822 --> 01:56:37,365
My name is Trinity

1662
01:56:37,448 --> 01:56:39,826
and you better
take your hands off of me.

1663
01:56:51,003 --> 01:56:52,004
Neo!

1664
01:56:52,505 --> 01:56:53,506
Trinity!

1665
01:56:54,674 --> 01:56:55,717
Oh, shit.

1666
01:56:57,009 --> 01:56:58,344
Get her out. Get her out!

1667
01:57:06,978 --> 01:57:10,273
Aye-yi-yi, what a mess.

1668
01:57:10,356 --> 01:57:13,025
I own that mistake.
Shouldn't have pressed.

1669
01:57:13,109 --> 01:57:16,112
Women used to be
so easy to control.

1670
01:57:16,195 --> 01:57:20,742
You know there's no way
I can let you two go free.

1671
01:57:24,162 --> 01:57:25,621
Cannot happen.

1672
01:57:28,791 --> 01:57:31,627
So, I guess it's deja vu
all over again.

1673
01:57:32,754 --> 01:57:34,547
She dies

1674
01:57:34,630 --> 01:57:36,007
and it's all your fault.

1675
01:57:37,550 --> 01:57:40,136
Lies, lies and more lies.

1676
01:57:40,887 --> 01:57:42,096
Smith?

1677
01:57:42,180 --> 01:57:43,306
What has the world come to

1678
01:57:43,389 --> 01:57:44,630
when you can't even
trust a program?

1679
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:47,977
How...

1680
01:57:48,060 --> 01:57:50,813
Tom and I have more in common
than you know.

1681
01:57:50,897 --> 01:57:53,941
Once he got out,
let's just say,

1682
01:57:54,776 --> 01:57:56,569
I was free to be me.

1683
01:58:04,243 --> 01:58:06,996
- Yeah!
- Trinity?

1684
01:58:55,378 --> 01:58:56,546
You ready?

1685
01:58:56,629 --> 01:58:57,922
Yeah.

1686
01:59:40,006 --> 01:59:41,465
Oh, no.

1687
01:59:42,842 --> 01:59:45,219
Destroy her. Destroy her!

1688
02:00:02,194 --> 02:00:03,195
No.

1689
02:00:09,035 --> 02:00:10,536
Stop them.

1690
02:00:36,187 --> 02:00:37,688
You think this is over?

1691
02:00:37,772 --> 02:00:39,774
Lockdown. Initiate swarm.

1692
02:00:48,741 --> 02:00:51,077
Here, our unexpected
alliance ends.

1693
02:00:52,745 --> 02:00:55,373
You know the difference
between us, Tom?

1694
02:00:55,456 --> 02:00:57,333
Anyone could have been you.

1695
02:00:57,416 --> 02:00:59,460
Whereas I've always
been anyone.

1696
02:01:04,840 --> 02:01:06,342
What just happened?

1697
02:01:06,425 --> 02:01:07,593
What?

1698
02:01:09,595 --> 02:01:12,181
Oh, no! Move! Move!

1699
02:01:12,264 --> 02:01:13,307
Get the hell out of there!

1700
02:01:17,186 --> 02:01:19,146
- How bad?
- Like, all the bad.

1701
02:01:20,439 --> 02:01:21,899
Yeah, this is bad.

1702
02:01:23,275 --> 02:01:24,902
I don't suppose
you can still fly?

1703
02:01:35,287 --> 02:01:36,998
Yeah, that's not happening.

1704
02:02:02,732 --> 02:02:03,983
Neo! Get on.

1705
02:02:12,658 --> 02:02:14,452
Calliope! Take the wounded!

1706
02:02:14,535 --> 02:02:16,579
Everyone else,
we stay with them!

1707
02:02:33,637 --> 02:02:36,182
- How is she?
- Life signs are good.

1708
02:02:40,019 --> 02:02:41,479
Her signal's strong, Captain.

1709
02:02:50,362 --> 02:02:52,406
Well done, Captain.

1710
02:02:54,784 --> 02:02:56,660
All we need is a miracle.

1711
02:03:24,730 --> 02:03:25,773
I hate bots.

1712
02:03:32,071 --> 02:03:33,906
- Get us out of here!
- I'm trying!

1713
02:03:33,989 --> 02:03:35,991
The lockdown is tracking.
Swarm is everywhere.

1714
02:03:36,075 --> 02:03:37,275
Never seen anything like this.

1715
02:04:23,122 --> 02:04:25,291
Seq, what is that?

1716
02:04:30,296 --> 02:04:31,422
What's wrong?

1717
02:04:33,132 --> 02:04:34,633
What are you...

1718
02:04:42,183 --> 02:04:44,226
He's turning bots into bombs.

1719
02:05:16,675 --> 02:05:17,885
Shit!

1720
02:05:17,968 --> 02:05:18,969
Lexy?

1721
02:05:33,359 --> 02:05:34,568
Sheperd's in trouble.

1722
02:05:37,655 --> 02:05:39,448
Jack me in.

1723
02:05:39,531 --> 02:05:41,575
I can get you in. I don't
know if I can get you out.

1724
02:05:47,539 --> 02:05:49,250
No!

1725
02:06:02,596 --> 02:06:03,722
What are they doing?

1726
02:06:07,768 --> 02:06:09,436
Herding them into a kill zone.

1727
02:06:42,511 --> 02:06:43,846
Captain, you gotta hurry.

1728
02:06:43,929 --> 02:06:46,181
Hang on, Lex.

1729
02:06:50,394 --> 02:06:52,229
Lexy!

1730
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:35,647
There they are!

1731
02:08:02,091 --> 02:08:03,258
Morpheus!

1732
02:08:07,137 --> 02:08:08,847
Lex.

1733
02:08:08,931 --> 02:08:10,808
- Bugsy.
- Hell yeah!

1734
02:08:11,767 --> 02:08:13,394
Seq, where's Neo?

1735
02:08:13,477 --> 02:08:15,104
It's bad. They're pinned.

1736
02:08:15,187 --> 02:08:16,271
Heading to a roof.

1737
02:09:25,549 --> 02:09:26,800
Nodal fibrillation
is critical.

1738
02:09:26,884 --> 02:09:28,302
She'll die
if we don't extract.

1739
02:10:09,301 --> 02:10:11,929
It's so beautiful.

1740
02:10:27,236 --> 02:10:28,946
I remember this.

1741
02:10:31,031 --> 02:10:33,242
I remember us.

1742
02:10:51,343 --> 02:10:53,345
My dream ended here.

1743
02:11:04,231 --> 02:11:05,816
We can't go back.

1744
02:11:07,943 --> 02:11:09,027
We won't.

1745
02:11:28,297 --> 02:11:29,673
Can they make the jump?

1746
02:12:00,746 --> 02:12:02,372
I'm not doing this.

1747
02:12:02,456 --> 02:12:03,832
Are you doing this?

1748
02:12:27,939 --> 02:12:29,024
Bye.

1749
02:13:50,063 --> 02:13:51,648
How dramatic.

1750
02:13:52,482 --> 02:13:53,775
"Tiffany"?

1751
02:13:53,859 --> 02:13:56,820
It was a private joke.

1752
02:13:56,903 --> 02:13:58,447
An amusement, that's all.

1753
02:13:58,530 --> 02:14:00,866
An amusement? Hmm.

1754
02:14:02,617 --> 02:14:04,786
Whoa.

1755
02:14:04,870 --> 02:14:06,288
Kind of like that?

1756
02:14:10,542 --> 02:14:13,295
Okay. Ow.

1757
02:14:13,378 --> 02:14:14,838
If you hated the name so much,

1758
02:14:14,921 --> 02:14:17,090
why did you heel like
a good little bitch so long?

1759
02:14:20,218 --> 02:14:22,471
Yeah. Definitely asked
for that.

1760
02:14:27,768 --> 02:14:29,728
Can't you control her?

1761
02:14:35,567 --> 02:14:37,277
That was for using children.

1762
02:14:42,157 --> 02:14:43,658
We have a few questions.

1763
02:14:43,742 --> 02:14:45,577
You tried to activate
the fail-safe.

1764
02:14:45,660 --> 02:14:46,995
The Suits tried.

1765
02:14:47,078 --> 02:14:49,372
Obviously, without control
of your source code,

1766
02:14:49,456 --> 02:14:50,832
I knew that was impossible.

1767
02:14:50,916 --> 02:14:53,126
So, why haven't
the Suits purged you?

1768
02:14:54,002 --> 02:14:56,671
Because I know the system.

1769
02:14:56,755 --> 02:14:59,174
I know human beings.

1770
02:14:59,257 --> 02:15:01,426
And I know you.

1771
02:15:03,845 --> 02:15:06,389
Right now, you're feeling good
about what you've done.

1772
02:15:06,473 --> 02:15:08,892
You should.
It was a victory. Bravo.

1773
02:15:09,726 --> 02:15:11,061
Now what?

1774
02:15:11,144 --> 02:15:13,772
You've come here to negotiate
some kind of deal?

1775
02:15:13,855 --> 02:15:15,440
You think you hold
all the cards,

1776
02:15:15,524 --> 02:15:17,943
because you can do
whatever you want in this world.

1777
02:15:18,026 --> 02:15:20,362
I say, go for it.

1778
02:15:20,445 --> 02:15:23,031
Remake it.
Knock yourselves out.

1779
02:15:23,114 --> 02:15:25,158
Paint the sky with rainbows.

1780
02:15:25,242 --> 02:15:26,409
But here's the thing.

1781
02:15:26,493 --> 02:15:29,538
The sheeple aren't
going anywhere.

1782
02:15:29,621 --> 02:15:30,831
They like my world.

1783
02:15:30,914 --> 02:15:33,834
They don't want
this sentimentality.

1784
02:15:33,917 --> 02:15:35,836
They don't want
freedom or empowerment.

1785
02:15:35,919 --> 02:15:38,338
They want to be controlled.

1786
02:15:38,421 --> 02:15:40,382
They crave
the comfort of certainty.

1787
02:15:40,465 --> 02:15:43,218
And that means you two,
back in your pods,

1788
02:15:43,301 --> 02:15:46,847
unconscious and alone,
just like them.

1789
02:15:51,101 --> 02:15:53,812
We're not here
to negotiate anything.

1790
02:15:53,895 --> 02:15:56,147
We were on our way
to remake your world.

1791
02:15:56,231 --> 02:15:57,774
Change a few things.

1792
02:15:57,858 --> 02:15:59,067
I kind of like

1793
02:15:59,150 --> 02:16:00,559
the "paint the sky
with rainbows" idea.

1794
02:16:00,569 --> 02:16:02,487
Just remind people
what a free mind can do.

1795
02:16:02,571 --> 02:16:04,072
I forgot. It's easy to forget.

1796
02:16:04,155 --> 02:16:06,575
- He makes it easy.
- That, he does.

1797
02:16:06,658 --> 02:16:08,869
Something he should
think about.

1798
02:16:09,870 --> 02:16:11,079
Before we got started,

1799
02:16:11,162 --> 02:16:13,999
we decided to stop by
to say thank you.

1800
02:16:14,082 --> 02:16:17,168
You gave us something
we never thought we could have.

1801
02:16:17,252 --> 02:16:18,628
And what is that?

1802
02:16:19,504 --> 02:16:21,298
Another chance.

1803
02:27:24,544 --> 02:27:27,338
Face reality, people.
Movies are dead.

1804
02:27:27,421 --> 02:27:29,340
Games are dead.

1805
02:27:29,423 --> 02:27:31,175
Narrative? Dead.

1806
02:27:31,259 --> 02:27:33,219
Media is nothing
but neuro-trigger response

1807
02:27:33,302 --> 02:27:34,512
and viral conditioning.

1808
02:27:34,595 --> 02:27:36,097
Wait, what are you two
talking about?

1809
02:27:38,349 --> 02:27:40,184
Cat videos.

1810
02:27:40,268 --> 02:27:44,021
What we need is
a series of videos

1811
02:27:44,105 --> 02:27:46,440
that we call "The Catrix."
