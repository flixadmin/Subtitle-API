1
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:07,037
ELLARIA: The Lannisters have
declared war on house Tyrell.

2
00:00:07,038 --> 00:00:08,288
They have declared war
on Dorne.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,788
We must be allies now,
if we wish to survive.

4
00:00:12,329 --> 00:00:14,872
I offer vengeance...
justice...

5
00:00:15,329 --> 00:00:16,705
Fire and blood.

6
00:00:18,538 --> 00:00:19,579
SAM: I traveled south

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,329
under orders
from the Lord Commander.

8
00:00:21,663 --> 00:00:23,663
RANDYLL:
You ought to be a Maester.

9
00:00:23,872 --> 00:00:26,078
Spending your life reading
about the achievements

10
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:27,204
of better men.

11
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,078
SAM: It's a map of Dragonstone.

12
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:30,204
GILLY: That's dragonglass.

13
00:00:30,455 --> 00:00:31,895
A mountain of it,
beneath the ground.

14
00:00:32,038 --> 00:00:33,204
John needs to know.

15
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:34,955
You must send me away.

16
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:37,120
I command you to heal yourself.

17
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:39,413
I command you to find the cure.

18
00:00:46,288 --> 00:00:49,413
So why's a nice girl on her own
heading to King's Landing?

19
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,246
I'm going to kill the queen.

20
00:00:52,747 --> 00:00:54,537
I invited Euron Greyjoy,

21
00:00:54,538 --> 00:00:56,204
the new king
of the Iron Islands.

22
00:00:58,663 --> 00:01:02,079
The Iron Fleet is the greatest
armada Westeros has ever seen.

23
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,287
The surest way to
a woman's heart is with a gift.

24
00:01:05,288 --> 00:01:08,371
I won't return to King's Landing
until I have that for you.

25
00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:12,413
Shall we begin?

26
00:01:22,288 --> 00:01:25,121
( theme music playing )

27
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:11,246
( thunder crashing )

28
00:03:40,246 --> 00:03:43,037
Tyrion: On a night like this,
you came into the world.

29
00:03:43,038 --> 00:03:44,328
Varys:
I remember that storm.

30
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:47,078
All the dogs
in King's Landing

31
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:49,078
howled through
the night.

32
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,704
I wish I could
remember it.

33
00:03:50,705 --> 00:03:53,620
I always thought
this would be a homecoming.

34
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:55,412
Doesn't feel
like home.

35
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:57,746
We won't stay
on Dragonstone for long.

36
00:03:57,747 --> 00:03:59,038
Good.

37
00:04:00,455 --> 00:04:02,287
Daenerys:
Not so many lions.

38
00:04:02,288 --> 00:04:05,203
Varys: Cersei controls fewer
than half the Seven Kingdoms.

39
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,495
The lords of Westeros
despise her.

40
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:10,370
Even before your arrival,
they plotted against her.

41
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:13,871
- Now...
- They cry out for their true queen?

42
00:04:13,872 --> 00:04:16,495
They drink secret toasts
to my health?

43
00:04:16,496 --> 00:04:18,454
People used to tell my
brother that sort of thing,

44
00:04:18,455 --> 00:04:20,496
and he was stupid enough
to believe them.

45
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:29,328
If Viserys had three dragons
and an army at his back,

46
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:31,328
he'd have invaded
King's Landing already.

47
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:33,912
Conquering Westeros
would be easy for you.

48
00:04:33,913 --> 00:04:36,329
But you're not here
to be queen of the ashes.

49
00:04:37,955 --> 00:04:39,078
No.

50
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,328
We can take
the Seven Kingdoms

51
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:44,203
without turning it
into a slaughterhouse.

52
00:04:44,204 --> 00:04:46,787
If the great houses support
your claim against Cersei,

53
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:48,871
the game is won.

54
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,328
With the Tyrell army and
the Dornish on our side,

55
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:54,495
we have powerful allies
in the south.

56
00:04:54,496 --> 00:04:57,078
I never properly
thanked you for that.

57
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,829
They joined our side,
my queen,

58
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,370
because
they believe in you.

59
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:04,705
You served my father,
didn't you, Lord Varys?

60
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:07,328
I did.

61
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:08,662
And then you served
the man who overthrew him.

62
00:05:08,663 --> 00:05:10,412
I had a choice,
Your Grace...

63
00:05:10,413 --> 00:05:12,537
serve Robert Baratheon
or face the headman's axe.

64
00:05:12,538 --> 00:05:14,871
But you didn't
serve him long.

65
00:05:14,872 --> 00:05:16,329
You turned
against him.

66
00:05:17,788 --> 00:05:21,495
Robert was an improvement
on your father, to be sure.

67
00:05:21,496 --> 00:05:23,579
There have been
few rulers in history

68
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,662
as cruel
as the Mad King.

69
00:05:25,663 --> 00:05:28,120
Robert was
neither mad nor cruel.

70
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:30,662
He simply had no interest
in being king.

71
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,370
So you took it upon yourself
to find a better one.

72
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:35,579
Your Grace,

73
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,579
when I was ready to drink
myself into a small coffin,

74
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,620
Lord Varys told me about
a queen in the east who...

75
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:43,538
Before I came to power,
you favored my brother.

76
00:05:44,955 --> 00:05:48,245
All your spies,
your little birds,

77
00:05:48,246 --> 00:05:51,913
did they tell you Viserys
was cruel, stupid, and weak?

78
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:58,537
Would those qualities have made for a
good king in your learned opinion?

79
00:05:58,538 --> 00:06:01,203
Until your marriage
to Khal Drogo, Your Grace,

80
00:06:01,204 --> 00:06:03,704
I knew nothing about you,
save your existence

81
00:06:03,705 --> 00:06:06,037
and that you were said
to be beautiful.

82
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:09,746
So you and your friends traded me
like a prized horse to the Dothraki.

83
00:06:09,747 --> 00:06:11,746
Which you turned
to your advantage.

84
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,788
Who gave the order
to kill me?

85
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:19,829
King Robert.

86
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,579
Who hired
the assassins?

87
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,746
Who sent word to Essos
to murder Daenerys Targaryen?

88
00:06:25,747 --> 00:06:30,287
- Your Grace, I did what had to be done to...
- To keep yourself alive.

89
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:32,579
Lord Varys has proven
himself a loyal servant.

90
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,370
Proven himself loyal?
Quite the opposite.

91
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:38,078
If he dislikes one monarch,
he conspires to crown the next one.

92
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,495
What kind of a servant
is that?

93
00:06:40,496 --> 00:06:42,620
The kind
the realm needs.

94
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:45,996
Incompetence should not be
rewarded with blind loyalty.

95
00:06:45,997 --> 00:06:48,955
As long as I have my eyes,
I'll use them.

96
00:06:50,663 --> 00:06:52,662
I wasn't born
into a great house.

97
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:55,245
I came from nothing.

98
00:06:55,246 --> 00:06:58,203
I was sold as a slave
and carved up as an offering.

99
00:06:58,204 --> 00:07:02,037
When I was a child, I lived in
alleys, gutters, abandoned houses.

100
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:04,620
You wish to know
where my true loyalties lie?

101
00:07:04,621 --> 00:07:07,829
Not with any king or queen,
but with the people.

102
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,787
The people who suffer under despots
and prosper under just rule.

103
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:14,163
The people whose hearts
you aim to win.

104
00:07:15,955 --> 00:07:19,871
If you demand
blind allegiance,

105
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,620
I respect your wishes.

106
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:26,620
Grey Worm can behead me or
your dragons can devour me.

107
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:29,203
But if you let me live,
I will serve you well.

108
00:07:29,204 --> 00:07:32,495
I will dedicate myself to
seeing you on the Iron Throne

109
00:07:32,496 --> 00:07:34,996
because I choose you.

110
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:38,538
Because I know the people have
no better chance than you.

111
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,997
Swear this to me,
Varys.

112
00:07:50,496 --> 00:07:53,954
If you ever think
I'm failing the people,

113
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:57,162
you won't conspire
behind my back.

114
00:07:57,163 --> 00:07:59,120
You'll look me in the eye
as you have done today,

115
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:00,955
and you'll tell me
how I'm failing them.

116
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,955
I swear it,
my queen.

117
00:08:12,288 --> 00:08:16,203
And I swear this...
if you ever betray me,

118
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,913
I'll burn you alive.

119
00:08:21,246 --> 00:08:24,663
I would expect nothing less
from the Mother of Dragons.

120
00:08:27,747 --> 00:08:29,704
Forgive me, my queen.

121
00:08:29,705 --> 00:08:32,872
A red priestess from As'shai
has come to see you.

122
00:08:47,288 --> 00:08:49,038
( speaking Valyrian )

123
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:12,954
She once served another
who wanted the Iron Throne.

124
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:16,871
It didn't end well for
Stannis Baratheon, did it?

125
00:09:16,872 --> 00:09:18,537
No, it didn't.

126
00:09:18,538 --> 00:09:22,370
You chose an auspicious day
to arrive at Dragonstone.

127
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:24,245
We've just decided
to pardon those

128
00:09:24,246 --> 00:09:26,913
who once served
the wrong king.

129
00:09:30,872 --> 00:09:34,245
The Lord of Light doesn't have many
followers in Westeros, does he?

130
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:37,912
Not yet, but even those
who don't worship the Lord

131
00:09:37,913 --> 00:09:39,412
can serve his cause.

132
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,329
What does your lord
expect from me?

133
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:49,663
"The prince who was promised
will bring the dawn."

134
00:09:51,204 --> 00:09:52,954
I'm afraid
I'm not a prince.

135
00:09:52,955 --> 00:09:54,537
Missandei: Your Grace,
forgive me,

136
00:09:54,538 --> 00:09:57,495
but your translation
is not quite accurate.

137
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,245
That noun has no gender
in High Valyrian,

138
00:10:00,246 --> 00:10:03,203
so the proper translation
for that prophecy would be,

139
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:07,579
"The prince or princess who was
promised will bring the dawn."

140
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,746
Doesn't really roll
off the tongue, does it?

141
00:10:09,747 --> 00:10:11,288
No, but I like it
better.

142
00:10:12,872 --> 00:10:14,829
And you believe this
prophecy refers to me?

143
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,620
Prophecies are
dangerous things.

144
00:10:17,621 --> 00:10:20,954
I believe you have
a role to play.

145
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:22,829
As does another...

146
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,329
the King in the North,
Jon Snow.

147
00:10:26,621 --> 00:10:28,037
Jon Snow?

148
00:10:28,038 --> 00:10:30,829
- Ned Stark's bastard?
- You know him?

149
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,996
I travelled with him to the Wall
when he joined the Night's Watch.

150
00:10:33,997 --> 00:10:38,120
And why do you think the Lord of
Light singled out this Jon Snow?

151
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:40,829
Aside from the visions you've
seen in the flames, that is.

152
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,746
As Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch,

153
00:10:43,747 --> 00:10:45,996
he allowed the wildlings
south of the Wall

154
00:10:45,997 --> 00:10:48,078
to protect them
from grave danger.

155
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,662
As King in the North,

156
00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:52,495
he has united those wildlings
with the Northern houses,

157
00:10:52,496 --> 00:10:54,996
so together they may
face their common enemy.

158
00:10:54,997 --> 00:10:57,120
He sounds like
quite a man.

159
00:10:57,121 --> 00:10:59,495
Summon Jon Snow.

160
00:10:59,496 --> 00:11:01,162
Let him stand
before you

161
00:11:01,163 --> 00:11:02,787
and tell you the things
that have happened to him,

162
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:06,413
the things that he has
seen with his own eyes.

163
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:09,579
I can't speak
to prophecies

164
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,203
or visions
in the flames,

165
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,996
but I like Jon Snow
and I trusted him.

166
00:11:14,997 --> 00:11:17,495
And I am an excellent
judge of character.

167
00:11:17,496 --> 00:11:19,954
If he does
rule the North,

168
00:11:19,955 --> 00:11:21,705
he would make
a valuable ally.

169
00:11:23,038 --> 00:11:24,954
The Lannisters
executed his father

170
00:11:24,955 --> 00:11:27,120
and conspired
to murder his brother.

171
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:30,329
Jon Snow has even more reason
to hate Cersei than you do.

172
00:11:34,705 --> 00:11:36,495
Very well.

173
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,287
Send a raven north.

174
00:11:38,288 --> 00:11:40,287
Tell Jon Snow
that his queen

175
00:11:40,288 --> 00:11:43,287
invites him to come
to Dragonstone...

176
00:11:43,288 --> 00:11:45,038
and bend the knee.

177
00:11:49,204 --> 00:11:51,747
( chatter )

178
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,579
Gather round.
Come here.

179
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,078
Sansa: You think
it's really Tyrion?

180
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,579
It could be someone trying
to lure you into a trap.

181
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,120
Read the last bit.

182
00:12:05,121 --> 00:12:09,746
"All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes."

183
00:12:09,747 --> 00:12:11,495
What does that mean?

184
00:12:11,496 --> 00:12:14,413
It's something he said to me
the first night we met.

185
00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:17,580
You know him better
than any of us.

186
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:19,747
What do you think?

187
00:12:23,204 --> 00:12:25,829
Tyrion's not like
the other Lannisters.

188
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:29,620
He was always kind to me,
but it's too great a risk.

189
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:31,620
"The Seven Kingdoms
will bleed

190
00:12:31,621 --> 00:12:34,120
as long as Cersei sits
on the Iron Throne.

191
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:35,287
Join us.

192
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,121
Together, we can
end her tyranny."

193
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:43,287
Sounds like a charmer.

194
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:45,495
Of course, the casual mention
of a Dothraki horde,

195
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:48,454
a legion of Unsullied,
and three dragons...

196
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:49,997
a bit less charming.

197
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:53,162
What?

198
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:56,412
Fire kills wights,
you told me.

199
00:12:56,413 --> 00:12:57,580
What breathes fire?

200
00:12:59,663 --> 00:13:01,787
You're not suggesting
Jon meet with her?

201
00:13:01,788 --> 00:13:04,203
- No, too dangerous.
- But?

202
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:07,162
But if the Army of the Dead
makes it past the Wall,

203
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:09,663
do we have enough men
to fight them?

204
00:13:13,997 --> 00:13:16,370
If the Mad King's daughter
takes the Iron Throne,

205
00:13:16,371 --> 00:13:18,288
she'll destroy the realm
as we know it.

206
00:13:19,621 --> 00:13:22,537
Some of you are bannermen
of House Tyrell.

207
00:13:22,538 --> 00:13:25,662
But House Tyrell is in open
rebellion against the crown.

208
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:28,871
With their help,
the Mad King's daughter

209
00:13:28,872 --> 00:13:32,370
has ferried an army of
savages to our shores...

210
00:13:32,371 --> 00:13:36,162
mindless Unsullied soldiers who will
destroy your castles and your holdfasts,

211
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:40,328
Dothraki heathens who will burn
your villages to the ground,

212
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:42,537
rape and enslave
your women,

213
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:45,454
and butcher your children
without a second thought.

214
00:13:45,455 --> 00:13:50,328
This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards
centuries of service and loyalty.

215
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,162
- ( people murmuring )
- Cersei: You all remember the Mad King.

216
00:13:53,163 --> 00:13:56,704
You remember the horrors
he inflicted upon his people.

217
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:58,704
His daughter
is no different.

218
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:01,495
In Essos, her brutality
is already legendary.

219
00:14:01,496 --> 00:14:05,787
She crucified hundreds of
noblemen in Slaver's Bay.

220
00:14:05,788 --> 00:14:08,454
And when she
grew bored of that,

221
00:14:08,455 --> 00:14:10,704
she fed them
to her dragons.

222
00:14:10,705 --> 00:14:14,287
It is my solemn duty to protect
the people, and I will.

223
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:17,454
But I need your help,
my lords.

224
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:20,246
We must stand together,
all of us...

225
00:14:21,455 --> 00:14:23,454
if we hope to stop her.

226
00:14:23,455 --> 00:14:25,163
( all murmuring )

227
00:14:28,788 --> 00:14:31,872
She has three full-grown dragons,
Your Grace.

228
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:35,037
The same as Aegon
when he conquered

229
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:37,537
the Seven Kingdoms.

230
00:14:37,538 --> 00:14:39,913
How do you propose
to stop them?

231
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,705
We are currently at work
on a solution, my lord.

232
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,705
( chatter )

233
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,580
Lord Tarly.

234
00:14:57,413 --> 00:14:59,328
Ser Jaime.

235
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:01,037
I believe
you know my son.

236
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:02,038
Ser Jaime.

237
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,537
Rickard, isn't it?

238
00:15:03,538 --> 00:15:05,245
Dickon.

239
00:15:05,246 --> 00:15:06,787
That's it.

240
00:15:06,788 --> 00:15:08,787
Thank you for coming.

241
00:15:08,788 --> 00:15:12,704
The other lords of the Reach look to
you for guidance, now more than ever.

242
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:14,412
They might not have come
if you hadn't.

243
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,704
If my queen summons me,
I answer the call.

244
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:20,496
And I've heard what she
does to those who defy her.

245
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:25,746
You ride for
Horn Hill today?

246
00:15:25,747 --> 00:15:28,454
I have an army
to mobilize.

247
00:15:28,455 --> 00:15:30,787
Won't be long before
the fighting starts.

248
00:15:30,788 --> 00:15:33,246
And which side
will you be fighting for?

249
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,579
You were the only man to defeat
Robert Baratheon in battle.

250
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,495
Not even Rhaegar Targaryen
could do that.

251
00:15:39,496 --> 00:15:42,454
It's a long ride back to the
Reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?

252
00:15:42,455 --> 00:15:45,412
I want you to be my ranking
general in the wars to come.

253
00:15:45,413 --> 00:15:47,537
I want you to swear
allegiance to Cersei

254
00:15:47,538 --> 00:15:50,537
and I want you to help me
destroy her enemies.

255
00:15:50,538 --> 00:15:52,370
All her enemies.

256
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:54,413
Including
Olenna Tyrell.

257
00:15:57,163 --> 00:15:59,662
I'm a Tarly.

258
00:15:59,663 --> 00:16:01,163
That name
means something.

259
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:05,203
We're not oathbreakers.
We're not schemers.

260
00:16:05,204 --> 00:16:07,662
We don't stab
our rivals in the back

261
00:16:07,663 --> 00:16:10,496
or cut their throats
at weddings.

262
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:15,537
I swore an oath
to House Tyrell.

263
00:16:15,538 --> 00:16:18,872
You swore an oath to the
crown as well, Lord Tarly.

264
00:16:20,288 --> 00:16:22,662
I've known Olenna
since I was a child.

265
00:16:22,663 --> 00:16:25,287
She was
a great woman once.

266
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:27,662
Now she's broken.

267
00:16:27,663 --> 00:16:29,787
She wants revenge
so badly,

268
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,037
she brought the Dothraki
to our shores.

269
00:16:32,038 --> 00:16:35,955
The Dothraki in Westeros for
the first time in history.

270
00:16:38,621 --> 00:16:40,871
I know you don't
like my sister,

271
00:16:40,872 --> 00:16:44,037
but you have
to make a choice.

272
00:16:44,038 --> 00:16:46,078
Do you fight with us

273
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,204
or with foreign savages
and eunuchs?

274
00:16:53,455 --> 00:16:55,704
When the war is won,

275
00:16:55,705 --> 00:16:58,871
the queen will need
a new Warden of the South.

276
00:16:58,872 --> 00:17:01,704
I can think
of no better man

277
00:17:01,705 --> 00:17:03,538
than Randyll Tarly.

278
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,370
Ebrose: The infection
has spread too far.

279
00:17:08,371 --> 00:17:11,329
You should have cut off your arm
the moment you were touched.

280
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:15,163
How long?

281
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:20,037
It'll be years
before it kills you.

282
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,620
Could be 10.

283
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:23,287
Could be 20.

284
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:25,038
But how long until...?

285
00:17:26,455 --> 00:17:28,537
Your mind?

286
00:17:28,538 --> 00:17:31,413
Six months,
maybe fewer.

287
00:17:38,705 --> 00:17:39,705
( grunts )

288
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,204
Um...

289
00:17:46,747 --> 00:17:49,912
Pardon, Archmaester.

290
00:17:49,913 --> 00:17:52,912
I met Stannis Baratheon's
daughter at Castle Black.

291
00:17:52,913 --> 00:17:55,370
She had the greyscale
as a baby and was cured.

292
00:17:55,371 --> 00:17:56,954
- Ebrose: No.
- Isn't there some way...

293
00:17:56,955 --> 00:17:58,746
Ebrose: Does this look
like a baby to you?

294
00:17:58,747 --> 00:18:00,078
- No.
- Have you studied

295
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,120
the varying rates
of greyscale progression

296
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:03,747
in infants
and fully grown men?

297
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:07,163
No.

298
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:10,537
Ebrose:
Maester Cressen discovered

299
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:13,121
Shireen Baratheon's
affliction immediately.

300
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,288
This is quite advanced.

301
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:20,329
And beyond
our skills, ser.

302
00:18:23,788 --> 00:18:26,746
Were you a commoner, I'd have
you shipped to Valyria at once

303
00:18:26,747 --> 00:18:29,287
to live out your life
with the stone men.

304
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:33,121
As an anointed knight,
I'll allow you one more day.

305
00:18:35,913 --> 00:18:38,455
How you choose to spend
that time is up to you.

306
00:18:44,955 --> 00:18:45,955
Come, Samwell.

307
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,705
Should we send word
to your family, Ser...?

308
00:18:54,329 --> 00:18:55,329
Jorah.

309
00:18:57,163 --> 00:18:59,662
Jorah Mormont.

310
00:18:59,663 --> 00:19:01,704
Mormont?

311
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:03,454
There's no need.

312
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:06,038
I've been dead
to them for years.

313
00:19:07,705 --> 00:19:09,371
Ebrose:
Come, Samwell!

314
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:25,245
Qyburn: Have you ever been
down here, Your Grace?

315
00:19:25,246 --> 00:19:26,747
No, I can't say
I have.

316
00:19:28,997 --> 00:19:32,454
I haven't seen these since Robert had
them removed from the throne room.

317
00:19:32,455 --> 00:19:36,412
Curious that King Robert
did not have them destroyed.

318
00:19:36,413 --> 00:19:38,579
They were his trophies.

319
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,787
He couldn't
keep them around.

320
00:19:39,788 --> 00:19:41,704
They would have
made him look small.

321
00:19:41,705 --> 00:19:45,246
Sometimes he would come
down here and look at them.

322
00:19:47,705 --> 00:19:50,413
I believe he brought
his whores on occasion.

323
00:19:57,747 --> 00:19:59,538
Balerion the Dread.

324
00:20:01,371 --> 00:20:03,954
The beast that Aegon
rode across the sea.

325
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:06,871
His flames forged
the Iron Throne

326
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,747
and brought the Seven
Kingdoms to heel.

327
00:20:10,913 --> 00:20:12,079
Powerful...

328
00:20:13,204 --> 00:20:14,621
but not invincible.

329
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:22,412
Apparently,
one of Daenerys's dragons

330
00:20:22,413 --> 00:20:26,079
was wounded by spears in the
fighting pits of Meereen.

331
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,912
And if they can
be wounded,

332
00:20:29,913 --> 00:20:31,288
they can be killed.

333
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,579
The finest artillators and
blacksmiths in King's Landing

334
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,413
have been laboring day
and night, Your Grace.

335
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:48,455
If you'll kindly
pull that lever.

336
00:21:04,913 --> 00:21:07,455
Yara: If you want the
Iron Throne, take it.

337
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:12,620
We have an army, a fleet,
and three dragons.

338
00:21:12,621 --> 00:21:16,287
We should hit King's Landing now,
hard, with everything we have.

339
00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:18,787
The city will fall
within a day.

340
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:21,704
If we turn the dragons loose, tens of
thousands will die in the firestorms.

341
00:21:21,705 --> 00:21:23,287
It's called war.

342
00:21:23,288 --> 00:21:26,287
You don't have the stomach for it,
scurry back into hiding.

343
00:21:26,288 --> 00:21:27,620
I know
how you wage war.

344
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:30,370
We don't poison
little girls here.

345
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:31,662
Myrcella was innocent.

346
00:21:31,663 --> 00:21:33,037
She was a Lannister.

347
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:35,662
There are no
innocent Lannisters.

348
00:21:35,663 --> 00:21:38,954
My greatest regret is that
Oberyn died fighting for you.

349
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:40,829
Daenerys:
That's enough.

350
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,412
Lord Tyrion
is Hand of the Queen.

351
00:21:42,413 --> 00:21:43,830
You will treat him
with respect.

352
00:21:47,788 --> 00:21:50,830
I am not here to be
queen of the ashes.

353
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,245
That's very nice
to hear.

354
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,203
Of course,
I can't remember a queen

355
00:21:56,204 --> 00:21:59,162
who was better loved
than my granddaughter.

356
00:21:59,163 --> 00:22:01,120
The common people
loved her.

357
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:02,871
The nobles loved her.

358
00:22:02,872 --> 00:22:04,620
And what is left
of her now?

359
00:22:04,621 --> 00:22:07,454
Ashes.

360
00:22:07,455 --> 00:22:09,162
Commoners, nobles,

361
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:11,037
they're all
just children, really.

362
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,663
They won't obey you
unless they fear you.

363
00:22:16,663 --> 00:22:18,912
I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna,
for your counsel.

364
00:22:18,913 --> 00:22:20,829
I'm grateful
to all of you.

365
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,454
But you have chosen
to follow me.

366
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:25,829
I will not attack
King's Landing.

367
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,662
We will not attack
King's Landing.

368
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:32,328
Then how do you mean
to take the Iron Throne?

369
00:22:32,329 --> 00:22:33,663
By asking nicely?

370
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:37,203
We will lay siege
to the capital,

371
00:22:37,204 --> 00:22:38,912
surrounding the city
on all sides.

372
00:22:38,913 --> 00:22:40,704
Cersei will have
the Iron Throne,

373
00:22:40,705 --> 00:22:43,078
but no food for her army
or the people.

374
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:45,996
But we won't use
Dothraki and Unsullied.

375
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:48,037
Cersei will try to rally
the lords of Westeros

376
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:49,704
by appealing
to their loyalty,

377
00:22:49,705 --> 00:22:51,370
their love
for their country.

378
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:53,287
If we besiege the city
with foreigners,

379
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,996
we prove her point.

380
00:22:54,997 --> 00:22:56,620
Our army should be
Westerosi.

381
00:22:56,621 --> 00:22:58,912
And I suppose we're
providing the Westerosi?

382
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:00,203
You are.

383
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:03,580
Lady Greyjoy will escort
you home to Sunspear.

384
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:09,579
And her Iron Fleet
will ferry the Dornish army

385
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,579
back up to King's Landing.

386
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,412
The Dornish will lay
siege to the capital

387
00:23:14,413 --> 00:23:16,454
alongside
the Tyrell army.

388
00:23:16,455 --> 00:23:19,120
Two great kingdoms
united against Cersei.

389
00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:24,245
So, your master plan
is to use our armies.

390
00:23:24,246 --> 00:23:27,621
Forgive me for asking, but why did
you bother to bring your own?

391
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:32,120
The Unsullied will have
another objective.

392
00:23:32,121 --> 00:23:35,704
For decades, House Lannister has
been the true power in Westeros.

393
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:39,871
And the seat of that power
is Casterly Rock.

394
00:23:39,872 --> 00:23:41,787
Grey Worm
and the Unsullied

395
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:44,663
will sail for the Rock
and take it.

396
00:24:03,204 --> 00:24:04,830
Do I have
your support?

397
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:07,997
You have mine.

398
00:24:09,788 --> 00:24:11,663
Dorne is with you,
Your Grace.

399
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,329
Thank you all.

400
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:20,663
Lady Olenna, may I speak
with you alone?

401
00:24:27,872 --> 00:24:29,620
( door closes )

402
00:24:29,621 --> 00:24:34,037
I realize you're here out of hatred
for Cersei and not love for me.

403
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:37,954
But I swear to you,
she will pay for what she's done.

404
00:24:37,955 --> 00:24:40,620
And we will bring peace
back to Westeros.

405
00:24:40,621 --> 00:24:42,662
Peace?

406
00:24:42,663 --> 00:24:45,328
Do you think that's what
we had under your father?

407
00:24:45,329 --> 00:24:48,454
Or his father?
Or his?

408
00:24:48,455 --> 00:24:51,120
Peace never lasts,
my dear.

409
00:24:51,121 --> 00:24:53,455
Will you take a bit of
advice from an old woman?

410
00:24:55,496 --> 00:24:57,454
He's a clever man,
your Hand.

411
00:24:57,455 --> 00:25:01,287
I've known
a great many clever men.

412
00:25:01,288 --> 00:25:03,203
I've outlived them all.

413
00:25:03,204 --> 00:25:05,120
You know why?

414
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:06,662
I ignored them.

415
00:25:06,663 --> 00:25:10,162
The lords of Westeros
are sheep.

416
00:25:10,163 --> 00:25:11,538
Are you a sheep?

417
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:14,871
No.

418
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:17,162
You're a dragon.

419
00:25:17,163 --> 00:25:18,705
Be a dragon.

420
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:25,037
- ( knocking on door )
- Grey Worm: Mají.

421
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:26,538
( door opens )

422
00:25:29,747 --> 00:25:31,163
You leave tomorrow.

423
00:25:33,997 --> 00:25:36,412
Were you going
to say goodbye?

424
00:25:36,413 --> 00:25:39,037
I will see you
when I return.

425
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,913
But you don't know
when that will be.

426
00:25:42,913 --> 00:25:43,913
No one knows.

427
00:25:46,747 --> 00:25:48,747
I wish you
good fortune.

428
00:25:51,246 --> 00:25:52,288
Missandei.

429
00:26:00,788 --> 00:26:03,245
It is hard for me
to say goodbye to you.

430
00:26:03,246 --> 00:26:04,454
Why?

431
00:26:04,455 --> 00:26:06,120
You know why.

432
00:26:06,121 --> 00:26:07,204
I don't.

433
00:26:10,455 --> 00:26:13,872
Y-you are my weakness.

434
00:26:15,204 --> 00:26:17,328
That's what I am?

435
00:26:17,329 --> 00:26:18,787
Your weakness?

436
00:26:18,788 --> 00:26:22,496
When Unsullied are young,
the masters learn their fears.

437
00:26:23,913 --> 00:26:26,454
One boy is scared
of dogs,

438
00:26:26,455 --> 00:26:28,328
one boy hates
high places,

439
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:31,162
one is frightened
of the ocean.

440
00:26:31,163 --> 00:26:33,620
They make the boy
sleep with dogs

441
00:26:33,621 --> 00:26:35,537
or climb a cliff.

442
00:26:35,538 --> 00:26:37,829
They throw him
in the water.

443
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,120
If he learns
to swim, good.

444
00:26:40,121 --> 00:26:42,079
If he drowns, good.

445
00:26:43,288 --> 00:26:46,287
Either way,
strong Unsullied.

446
00:26:46,288 --> 00:26:48,704
But I had no fears.

447
00:26:48,705 --> 00:26:52,496
I was never the biggest,
never the strongest...

448
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,163
but I was bravest,
always.

449
00:26:58,621 --> 00:27:00,579
- I believe it.
- Until...

450
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,371
I meet Missandei
from the Isle of Naath.

451
00:27:05,913 --> 00:27:09,163
Now I have fear.

452
00:27:14,788 --> 00:27:15,997
I do, too.

453
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,038
( sniffles )

454
00:28:31,788 --> 00:28:33,204
No.

455
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:36,413
I want to see you.

456
00:28:37,788 --> 00:28:39,121
Please.

457
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:53,371
( panting )

458
00:30:11,955 --> 00:30:13,120
Might be useful.

459
00:30:13,121 --> 00:30:14,996
Ch'Vyalthan was
a dreadful writer,

460
00:30:14,997 --> 00:30:16,829
but an excellent
researcher.

461
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:19,287
- Archmaester, I wondered if I...
- And this one.

462
00:30:19,288 --> 00:30:21,162
Maester Faull was
quite the opposite...

463
00:30:21,163 --> 00:30:23,912
a brilliant stylist who invented
half the stories he tells.

464
00:30:23,913 --> 00:30:25,537
Um, I wanted
to ask you...

465
00:30:25,538 --> 00:30:27,328
If you're going
to write histories, Tarly,

466
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:28,912
you have to do
the research.

467
00:30:28,913 --> 00:30:30,787
If you want people
to read your histories,

468
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:33,037
you need
a bit of style.

469
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:35,037
I'm not writing
"A Chronicle of the Wars

470
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:36,871
Following the Death
of King Robert I"

471
00:30:36,872 --> 00:30:39,163
so it can sit
on a shelf unread.

472
00:30:41,496 --> 00:30:43,997
What?
You don't like the title?

473
00:30:45,204 --> 00:30:46,537
What would you call it, then?

474
00:30:46,538 --> 00:30:49,871
Mm, possibly something
a bit more poetic?

475
00:30:49,872 --> 00:30:52,620
We're not poets, Tarly.

476
00:30:52,621 --> 00:30:54,787
Um, Archmaester,
if I could just have a moment.

477
00:30:54,788 --> 00:30:56,537
This is your moment.

478
00:30:56,538 --> 00:30:57,997
Use it wisely.

479
00:30:59,913 --> 00:31:01,997
I may have found a way
to treat Ser Jorah.

480
00:31:03,621 --> 00:31:05,370
There are
two recorded cases

481
00:31:05,371 --> 00:31:07,203
of advanced greyscale
being cured.

482
00:31:07,204 --> 00:31:09,037
I found the procedure
in the study of rare diseases

483
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:10,370
by Archmaester Pylos.

484
00:31:10,371 --> 00:31:12,537
I'm familiar with
Archmaester Pylos

485
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,495
and his study
of rare diseases.

486
00:31:14,496 --> 00:31:16,495
- Oh, you are?
- Yes.

487
00:31:16,496 --> 00:31:18,413
And shall I tell you
how he died?

488
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,913
From greyscale.

489
00:31:22,705 --> 00:31:24,579
- Oh.
- The procedure's far too dangerous,

490
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,820
which is why
it's now forbidden.

491
00:31:44,329 --> 00:31:46,246
( cart wheels squeaking )

492
00:31:59,788 --> 00:32:01,496
( door opens )

493
00:32:10,163 --> 00:32:11,579
Hello.

494
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,121
- What are you doing?
- ( door closes )

495
00:32:15,496 --> 00:32:17,662
You're Jorah Mormont,

496
00:32:17,663 --> 00:32:19,621
the only son
of Jeor Mormont.

497
00:32:20,955 --> 00:32:22,746
My name
is Samwell Tarly,

498
00:32:22,747 --> 00:32:24,537
Sworn Brother
of the Night's Watch,

499
00:32:24,538 --> 00:32:27,328
training to serve
as maester at Castle Black.

500
00:32:27,329 --> 00:32:28,620
I knew your father.

501
00:32:28,621 --> 00:32:30,121
I was with him
when he died.

502
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,329
You are not dying today,
Ser Jorah.

503
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,954
Drink this.

504
00:32:45,955 --> 00:32:47,746
- What is it?
- Rum.

505
00:32:47,747 --> 00:32:49,907
Drink it all, please.
I'm afraid this is going to hurt.

506
00:32:55,872 --> 00:32:58,329
( coughing )

507
00:33:07,913 --> 00:33:10,328
( clears throat )

508
00:33:10,329 --> 00:33:12,997
If you could
take off your shirt.

509
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:21,246
( grunts )

510
00:33:26,788 --> 00:33:29,872
If you wouldn't mind,
bite down hard.

511
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:33,328
I'm sorry, but no one
knows I'm here,

512
00:33:33,329 --> 00:33:35,569
and if they hear you screaming,
then we're both finished.

513
00:33:39,413 --> 00:33:41,038
Jorah: Have you ever
done this before?

514
00:33:48,496 --> 00:33:49,496
No.

515
00:33:51,121 --> 00:33:53,747
But no one else will try it,
so I'm the best you've got.

516
00:33:57,246 --> 00:33:58,705
Have a seat.

517
00:34:02,913 --> 00:34:05,620
I'm going to have to remove the entire
upper layer of infected tissue,

518
00:34:05,621 --> 00:34:07,913
then apply a medicinal
ointment to the...

519
00:34:20,246 --> 00:34:23,746
- ( groaning )
- Shh, shh!

520
00:34:23,747 --> 00:34:25,996
Shh.

521
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,412
Again, I'm sorry,

522
00:34:28,413 --> 00:34:30,913
but please try
not to scream.

523
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:42,787
( grunting )

524
00:34:42,788 --> 00:34:44,455
( shushing )

525
00:34:49,663 --> 00:34:51,455
( whimpering )

526
00:35:07,288 --> 00:35:09,495
( groans )

527
00:35:09,496 --> 00:35:13,079
( muffled shouting )

528
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:27,163
( chatter, laughter )

529
00:35:29,621 --> 00:35:32,245
They say her dragons
are bigger than Aegon's.

530
00:35:32,246 --> 00:35:34,996
Horseshit. Cersei's just
trying to frighten us.

531
00:35:34,997 --> 00:35:36,579
I hope it's true.

532
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,620
If she lays siege to King's Landing,
prices will triple.

533
00:35:39,621 --> 00:35:42,996
As long as we get back
there before they start.

534
00:35:42,997 --> 00:35:45,538
One more round.
It's a long ride.

535
00:35:46,663 --> 00:35:48,996
Hot Pie:
Arry!

536
00:35:48,997 --> 00:35:50,204
Hello, Hot Pie.

537
00:35:51,496 --> 00:35:52,538
Sit down.

538
00:35:54,955 --> 00:35:56,204
Who's that for?

539
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:06,705
Mm. This is good.

540
00:36:08,705 --> 00:36:10,162
You think so?

541
00:36:10,163 --> 00:36:12,912
The secret is browning the
butter before making the dough.

542
00:36:12,913 --> 00:36:15,871
Most people don't do that 'cause
it takes up too much time.

543
00:36:15,872 --> 00:36:17,495
Mm, I didn't do that.

544
00:36:17,496 --> 00:36:19,037
You've been
making pies?

545
00:36:19,038 --> 00:36:21,370
One or two.

546
00:36:21,371 --> 00:36:23,370
I can't believe
you're here.

547
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:25,829
Did you meet
the big lady?

548
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,829
- Big lady?
- The lady knight?

549
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,037
You know, I figured she was a
knight 'cause she had armor on.

550
00:36:31,038 --> 00:36:34,871
She was looking for your sister,
but I told her about you.

551
00:36:34,872 --> 00:36:36,371
Did she ever find you?

552
00:36:37,955 --> 00:36:39,329
She found me.

553
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:45,872
What happened
to you, Arry?

554
00:36:56,371 --> 00:36:57,371
You got any ale?

555
00:37:01,413 --> 00:37:02,788
( pouring )

556
00:37:12,747 --> 00:37:14,912
- Where you heading?
- King's Landing.

557
00:37:14,913 --> 00:37:17,412
- Why?
- Heard Cersei's queen now.

558
00:37:17,413 --> 00:37:18,996
Heard she blew up
the Great Sept.

559
00:37:18,997 --> 00:37:20,579
That must have been
something to see.

560
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,370
- Boom.
- Mm.

561
00:37:22,371 --> 00:37:24,579
I can't believe
someone would do that.

562
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,121
Cersei would do that.

563
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:31,328
I thought you'd be
heading for Winterfell.

564
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:33,454
Why would I go there?
The Boltons have it.

565
00:37:33,455 --> 00:37:35,913
No, the Boltons
are dead.

566
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:39,287
What?

567
00:37:39,288 --> 00:37:41,454
Jon Snow came down from Castle
Black with a wildling army

568
00:37:41,455 --> 00:37:43,245
and won the Battle
of the Bastards.

569
00:37:43,246 --> 00:37:44,663
He's King
of the North now.

570
00:37:46,371 --> 00:37:47,454
You're lying.

571
00:37:47,455 --> 00:37:49,328
Why would I lie
about that?

572
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:50,788
He's your brother,
right?

573
00:37:57,705 --> 00:38:00,120
- Thanks for the pie.
- ( coins jingling )

574
00:38:00,121 --> 00:38:02,037
Friends don't pay.

575
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:04,328
Can't believe
I thought you were a boy.

576
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:06,246
You're pretty.

577
00:38:07,455 --> 00:38:08,455
Thanks.

578
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:15,872
Take care
of yourself, Hot Pie.

579
00:38:16,997 --> 00:38:18,662
Try not
to get killed.

580
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:20,078
Ah, I won't.

581
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,328
I'm like you, Arry.

582
00:38:21,329 --> 00:38:22,997
( sniffs )
I'm a survivor.

583
00:38:27,246 --> 00:38:29,329
200 miles
to King's Landing.

584
00:38:30,872 --> 00:38:32,997
One bottle of rum.
You think we'll make it?

585
00:38:34,204 --> 00:38:35,455
( grunts )

586
00:39:05,371 --> 00:39:07,078
( knocking on door )

587
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,746
Come in.

588
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:12,204
A raven, my king,
from the Citadel.

589
00:39:22,371 --> 00:39:24,746
Jon: This message was sent
to me by Samwell Tarly.

590
00:39:24,747 --> 00:39:28,078
He was my brother
at the Night's Watch,

591
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,620
a man I trust as much
as anyone in this world.

592
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:35,412
He's discovered proof
that Dragonstone

593
00:39:35,413 --> 00:39:38,245
sits on a mountain
of dragonglass.

594
00:39:38,246 --> 00:39:40,621
( all murmuring )

595
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:46,579
I received this
a few days ago

596
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,204
from Dragonstone.

597
00:39:49,872 --> 00:39:52,203
It was sent to me
by Tyrion Lannister.

598
00:39:52,204 --> 00:39:54,245
( all murmuring )

599
00:39:54,246 --> 00:39:57,579
He is now Hand of the Queen
to Daenerys Targaryen.

600
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:01,620
She intends to take the Iron
Throne from Cersei Lannister.

601
00:40:01,621 --> 00:40:03,537
She has a powerful army
at her back

602
00:40:03,538 --> 00:40:07,412
and, if this message
is to be believed,

603
00:40:07,413 --> 00:40:08,704
three dragons.

604
00:40:08,705 --> 00:40:10,704
( all murmuring )

605
00:40:10,705 --> 00:40:13,454
Jon: Lord Tyrion has
invited me to Dragonstone

606
00:40:13,455 --> 00:40:15,204
to meet with Daenerys.

607
00:40:16,538 --> 00:40:17,954
And I'm going
to accept.

608
00:40:17,955 --> 00:40:19,288
- ( all shouting )
- Man: Accept?!

609
00:40:21,955 --> 00:40:25,746
We need this dragonglass,
my lords!

610
00:40:25,747 --> 00:40:27,704
We know that dragonglass
can destroy

611
00:40:27,705 --> 00:40:29,620
both white walkers
and their army.

612
00:40:29,621 --> 00:40:33,163
We need to mine it
and turn it into weapons.

613
00:40:34,621 --> 00:40:36,537
But more importantly,
we need allies!

614
00:40:36,538 --> 00:40:40,829
The Night King's army
grows larger by the day.

615
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,579
We can't defeat them
on our own.

616
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,412
We don't have
the numbers.

617
00:40:44,413 --> 00:40:48,120
Daenerys has her own army
and she has dragonfire.

618
00:40:48,121 --> 00:40:51,412
I need to try and persuade
her to fight with us.

619
00:40:51,413 --> 00:40:54,537
Ser Davos and I will ride
for White Harbor tomorrow,

620
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:56,954
then sail
for Dragonstone.

621
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,871
Have you forgotten what
happened to our grandfather?

622
00:40:59,872 --> 00:41:02,078
The Mad King invited him
to King's Landing

623
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,370
- and roasted him alive.
- I know that.

624
00:41:04,371 --> 00:41:07,495
She is here to reclaim the Iron
Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.

625
00:41:07,496 --> 00:41:09,495
The North is one
of those seven kingdoms.

626
00:41:09,496 --> 00:41:12,328
This isn't an invitation;
it's a trap.

627
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:15,620
It could be, but I don't
believe Tyrion would do that.

628
00:41:15,621 --> 00:41:17,996
You know him.
He's a good man.

629
00:41:17,997 --> 00:41:21,829
Your Grace, with respect,
I must agree with Lady Sansa.

630
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,912
I remember the Mad King
all too well.

631
00:41:24,913 --> 00:41:27,662
A Targaryen
cannot be trusted.

632
00:41:27,663 --> 00:41:29,871
- Nor can a Lannister.
- All: Yeah!

633
00:41:29,872 --> 00:41:33,328
Aye. We called
your brother king.

634
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:37,245
And then he rode south
and lost his kingdom.

635
00:41:37,246 --> 00:41:41,037
Winter is here,
Your Grace.

636
00:41:41,038 --> 00:41:43,912
We need the King in the
North in the North.

637
00:41:43,913 --> 00:41:47,246
- Men: Aye!
- ( pounding tables )

638
00:41:55,663 --> 00:41:57,997
You all crowned me
your king.

639
00:41:59,872 --> 00:42:02,203
I never wanted it.

640
00:42:02,204 --> 00:42:04,662
I never asked for it.

641
00:42:04,663 --> 00:42:08,954
But I accepted it because
the North is my home.

642
00:42:08,955 --> 00:42:13,245
It's part of me, and I will
never stop fighting for it,

643
00:42:13,246 --> 00:42:14,663
no matter the odds.

644
00:42:17,371 --> 00:42:19,329
But the odds
are against us.

645
00:42:22,496 --> 00:42:25,537
None of you have seen the Army of the Dead.
None of you.

646
00:42:25,538 --> 00:42:29,579
We can never hope
to defeat them alone.

647
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,580
We need allies,
powerful allies.

648
00:42:35,413 --> 00:42:37,413
I know it's a risk.

649
00:42:39,204 --> 00:42:40,620
But I have
to take it.

650
00:42:40,621 --> 00:42:43,370
Then send an emissary.
Don't go yourself.

651
00:42:43,371 --> 00:42:44,912
Daenerys is a queen.

652
00:42:44,913 --> 00:42:47,245
Only a king can
convince her to help us.

653
00:42:47,246 --> 00:42:49,037
It has to be me.

654
00:42:49,038 --> 00:42:50,996
You're abandoning
your people!

655
00:42:50,997 --> 00:42:52,787
You're abandoning
your home.

656
00:42:52,788 --> 00:42:54,704
I'm leaving both
in good hands.

657
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:56,121
- Whose?
- Yours.

658
00:42:58,163 --> 00:42:59,620
You are my sister.

659
00:42:59,621 --> 00:43:01,704
You're the only Stark
in Winterfell.

660
00:43:01,705 --> 00:43:05,621
Until I return,
the North is yours.

661
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,747
Littlefinger:
I delivered his bones myself.

662
00:43:32,288 --> 00:43:33,912
Presented them
to Lady Catelyn

663
00:43:33,913 --> 00:43:36,413
as a gesture of goodwill
from Tyrion Lannister.

664
00:43:37,747 --> 00:43:39,246
Seems like
a lifetime ago.

665
00:43:40,955 --> 00:43:43,580
Do give Lord Tyrion my best
when you see him.

666
00:43:46,997 --> 00:43:48,954
I was sorry
when he died.

667
00:43:48,955 --> 00:43:52,663
Your father and I had our differences,
but he loved Cat very much.

668
00:43:55,329 --> 00:43:56,872
So did I.

669
00:43:59,163 --> 00:44:01,329
She wasn't fond
of you, was she?

670
00:44:03,246 --> 00:44:06,288
Well, it appears she vastly
underestimated you.

671
00:44:08,413 --> 00:44:09,746
Your father
and brothers are gone,

672
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:11,788
yet here you stand,
King in the North.

673
00:44:13,163 --> 00:44:15,496
Last best hope
against the coming storm.

674
00:44:20,621 --> 00:44:22,663
You don't belong
down here.

675
00:44:24,038 --> 00:44:25,455
Forgive me.

676
00:44:27,246 --> 00:44:30,704
We haven't ever
talked... properly.

677
00:44:30,705 --> 00:44:32,204
I wanted
to remedy that.

678
00:44:33,538 --> 00:44:35,371
I have nothing
to say to you.

679
00:44:37,121 --> 00:44:39,454
Not even
"thank you"?

680
00:44:39,455 --> 00:44:43,704
If it weren't for me, you'd have been
slaughtered on that battlefield.

681
00:44:43,705 --> 00:44:47,079
You have many enemies, my king, but I
swear to you, I'm not one of them.

682
00:44:49,663 --> 00:44:51,746
I love Sansa,

683
00:44:51,747 --> 00:44:53,412
as I loved her mother.

684
00:44:53,413 --> 00:44:54,413
( grunts )

685
00:44:57,538 --> 00:44:59,038
( choking )

686
00:45:03,705 --> 00:45:07,246
Touch my sister,
and I'll kill you myself.

687
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,913
( gasps )

688
00:45:19,413 --> 00:45:21,705
( chatter )

689
00:45:22,913 --> 00:45:26,246
( horse neighing )

690
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:34,872
- Man: Ready?
- Man #2: Ready?

691
00:45:38,538 --> 00:45:39,913
Man #2:
Ready!

692
00:45:43,413 --> 00:45:44,538
Come on.

693
00:45:48,038 --> 00:45:50,288
- Man: Yah!
- Man #2: Come on!

694
00:46:11,747 --> 00:46:12,954
( nickering )

695
00:46:12,955 --> 00:46:15,079
( blowing )

696
00:46:21,788 --> 00:46:24,246
( nickering )

697
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,663
( nickering )

698
00:46:44,413 --> 00:46:47,037
( twigs snap )

699
00:46:47,038 --> 00:46:48,997
( rustling )

700
00:46:51,246 --> 00:46:53,496
( footsteps approaching )

701
00:46:57,371 --> 00:46:59,245
( rustling continues )

702
00:46:59,246 --> 00:47:02,329
- ( horse neighing )
- ( wolves snarling )

703
00:47:08,455 --> 00:47:09,997
( horse neighs )

704
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:15,037
( wolves snarling )

705
00:47:15,038 --> 00:47:16,871
( barks )

706
00:47:16,872 --> 00:47:18,246
( bellows )

707
00:47:24,246 --> 00:47:27,246
( snarling )

708
00:47:28,538 --> 00:47:31,079
( snarling )

709
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,203
Nymeria?

710
00:47:41,204 --> 00:47:43,872
( growling )

711
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:58,913
Nymeria,
it's me, Arya.

712
00:48:00,747 --> 00:48:01,913
( grunts )

713
00:48:03,997 --> 00:48:06,246
I'm heading north, girl.

714
00:48:08,747 --> 00:48:11,288
Back to Winterfell.
I'm finally going home.

715
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,079
Come with me.

716
00:48:26,288 --> 00:48:27,705
Come with me.

717
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:57,455
That's not you.

718
00:49:00,621 --> 00:49:04,079
( men shouting )

719
00:49:13,329 --> 00:49:16,287
Nym: You can't have them all.
It's not fair.

720
00:49:16,288 --> 00:49:17,704
Obara:
I'm oldest.

721
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,829
Mama will want Cersei
for herself.

722
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:21,829
She's not my mama.

723
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:23,912
You can have Cersei.

724
00:49:23,913 --> 00:49:26,454
I want the Mountain.

725
00:49:26,455 --> 00:49:28,579
The Mountain
killed Father.

726
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:30,328
He'll crush you
with one hand.

727
00:49:30,329 --> 00:49:33,078
Father got careless.
That's what Mama says.

728
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:35,287
Will you shut up
about Mama?

729
00:49:35,288 --> 00:49:36,871
"Mama, Mama, Mama."

730
00:49:36,872 --> 00:49:40,746
Maybe I'll kill you both
before we take King's Landing.

731
00:49:40,747 --> 00:49:42,288
And then I won't
have to share.

732
00:49:44,788 --> 00:49:45,997
Both:
"Mama!"

733
00:49:48,038 --> 00:49:49,996
How can you drink
this piss?

734
00:49:49,997 --> 00:49:52,120
When we reach
Sunspear,

735
00:49:52,121 --> 00:49:54,662
I'll treat you
to a Dornish red.

736
00:49:54,663 --> 00:49:57,078
The best
in the world.

737
00:49:57,079 --> 00:49:58,495
Have you ever
been to Dorne?

738
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,495
A few times.

739
00:50:00,496 --> 00:50:01,871
Never stayed long.

740
00:50:01,872 --> 00:50:03,413
A boy in every port?

741
00:50:04,538 --> 00:50:05,997
A boy, a girl.

742
00:50:07,538 --> 00:50:08,913
Depends on the port.

743
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:14,747
Could we get
some more?

744
00:50:16,038 --> 00:50:17,912
I thought
it wasn't for you.

745
00:50:17,913 --> 00:50:20,204
I'm developing
a taste for it.

746
00:50:21,747 --> 00:50:23,997
- He's not your servant.
- It's fine.

747
00:50:25,955 --> 00:50:30,704
So, you're going to be
Queen of the Iron Islands.

748
00:50:30,705 --> 00:50:32,537
Once I kill my uncle.

749
00:50:32,538 --> 00:50:34,996
And what will you be,
handsome?

750
00:50:34,997 --> 00:50:36,704
Whatever
my queen commands.

751
00:50:36,705 --> 00:50:40,537
He'll be my advisor,
my protector.

752
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,787
Oh, I see.

753
00:50:42,788 --> 00:50:44,204
Your protector.

754
00:50:45,955 --> 00:50:48,495
So, if someone gets
too close to you...

755
00:50:48,496 --> 00:50:50,287
He might have
to intervene.

756
00:50:50,288 --> 00:50:52,078
To hold
that person back.

757
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,747
Until they've made
their intentions known.

758
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:00,081
Why are you standing
all the way over there, then?

759
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,662
A foreign invasion
is underway.

760
00:51:03,663 --> 00:51:05,413
Leave him be.

761
00:51:08,663 --> 00:51:10,788
Seems like you
don't need a protector.

762
00:51:12,872 --> 00:51:15,121
- ( crashing )
- ( men shouting )

763
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,705
Stay here.

764
00:51:20,705 --> 00:51:23,663
- ( all shouting )
- Man: We're under attack!

765
00:51:45,955 --> 00:51:47,413
Euron.

766
00:51:54,371 --> 00:51:56,288
( men shouting )

767
00:51:59,288 --> 00:52:00,621
( grunts )

768
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:07,162
( yelling )

769
00:52:07,163 --> 00:52:08,163
( screams )

770
00:52:10,329 --> 00:52:12,038
( grunts )

771
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:17,496
( all shouting )

772
00:52:26,538 --> 00:52:29,371
( all grunting )

773
00:52:55,329 --> 00:52:57,663
You mother's below deck.
Keep her safe.

774
00:52:59,163 --> 00:53:02,329
- ( explosions )
- ( footsteps approach )

775
00:53:06,413 --> 00:53:07,413
( exhales )

776
00:53:09,371 --> 00:53:10,371
( grunts )

777
00:53:18,163 --> 00:53:19,287
( grunts )

778
00:53:19,288 --> 00:53:21,538
( men shouting,
screaming )

779
00:53:31,413 --> 00:53:33,621
( screaming )

780
00:53:36,038 --> 00:53:38,079
( all shouting )

781
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:43,079
( grunts )

782
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:51,245
Aah!

783
00:53:51,246 --> 00:53:52,288
( grunts )

784
00:53:56,371 --> 00:53:57,371
( roars )

785
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:06,079
Yah!

786
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,829
( grunting )

787
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:12,830
Aah!

788
00:54:21,455 --> 00:54:23,454
( groans )

789
00:54:23,455 --> 00:54:25,246
( shouting )

790
00:54:27,788 --> 00:54:29,121
( screams )

791
00:54:30,997 --> 00:54:32,121
Yah!

792
00:54:33,788 --> 00:54:34,788
Yah!

793
00:54:41,747 --> 00:54:44,788
- ( choking )
- ( leather creaking )

794
00:54:47,455 --> 00:54:49,620
( grunting )

795
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:50,788
( screams )

796
00:54:53,329 --> 00:54:54,829
Kill us.

797
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:56,288
Get it over with.

798
00:55:10,997 --> 00:55:12,538
