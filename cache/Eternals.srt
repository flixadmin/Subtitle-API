1
00:01:46,877 --> 00:01:48,253
It is time.

2
00:02:24,248 --> 00:02:25,707
It's beautiful, isn't it?

3
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:28,377
I'm Ikaris.

4
00:02:29,378 --> 00:02:30,712
I'm Sersi.

5
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:48,160
Thank you, Ajak.

6
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,016
Shit.

7
00:07:37,561 --> 00:07:40,397
Excuse me. Excuse me.

8
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:00,959
I know I'm late, Charlie.

9
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:08,008
"In this broad Earth of ours,

10
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:11,511
"Amid the measureless grossness
and the slag,

11
00:08:11,678 --> 00:08:14,890
"Enclosed and safe
within its central heart,

12
00:08:15,057 --> 00:08:17,643
"Nestles the seed Perfection."

13
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:21,396
The poet's hope and optimism
in humanity...

14
00:08:21,563 --> 00:08:26,026
echoes our recent universal victory,
the return of half our population...

15
00:08:26,193 --> 00:08:27,577
And, thank God, there she is.

16
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:31,990
Our brilliant museum scientist, Ms. Sersi,
the person who will be...

17
00:08:32,157 --> 00:08:35,701
and was always supposed to be
giving you your presentation today.

18
00:08:35,911 --> 00:08:38,705
Thank you, Mr. Whitman.
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

19
00:08:38,872 --> 00:08:40,456
Today, we'll be learning
about the importance

20
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:43,752
of apex predators in a balanced ecosystem.

21
00:08:45,087 --> 00:08:46,088
Poetry?

22
00:08:46,255 --> 00:08:49,800
I completely ran out of things to say,
and these kids make me nervous.

23
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:52,177
Well, I thought you were
very charming, Professor.

24
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:53,804
See you tonight.

25
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:55,931
Ooh! "See you tonight."

26
00:08:56,682 --> 00:08:58,350
All right, settle down.

27
00:09:00,853 --> 00:09:01,854
So...

28
00:09:02,312 --> 00:09:04,731
who can tell me what an apex predator is?

29
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,900
Animals that hunt their prey for food.

30
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,235
Very good.

31
00:09:08,402 --> 00:09:12,072
Apex predators do hunt their prey for food,
like all predators.

32
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:14,116
But one thing that sets them apart...

33
00:09:14,283 --> 00:09:18,912
is that there are no other animals in
their habitat strong enough to hunt them.

34
00:09:20,163 --> 00:09:21,498
Who can give me an example?

35
00:09:21,665 --> 00:09:22,666
Lions.

36
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,585
- Wolves.
- Correct.

37
00:09:27,212 --> 00:09:28,422
Earthquake.

38
00:09:31,717 --> 00:09:32,843
Get down. Get down!

39
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,846
It's an earthquake, everyone.
Get down! Under the tables!

40
00:09:37,014 --> 00:09:40,017
Let me help you.
Don't worry, it'll pass soon.

41
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:49,985
It's all right. Come here.

42
00:09:51,904 --> 00:09:54,114
You're all right. You're all right.

43
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:38,700
I like this song.

44
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:39,993
Me, too.

45
00:10:41,036 --> 00:10:42,371
Do you wanna dance?

46
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,498
Wait, what the hell?

47
00:10:45,457 --> 00:10:46,667
Your hand!

48
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:51,255
You've had too much to drink.
I gotta go.

49
00:10:56,385 --> 00:11:00,806
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

50
00:11:00,973 --> 00:11:05,978
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Dane ♪</i>

51
00:11:06,144 --> 00:11:10,107
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

52
00:11:10,274 --> 00:11:12,234
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

53
00:11:19,116 --> 00:11:20,659
Is this from the Middle Ages?

54
00:11:20,826 --> 00:11:22,119
It has your family crest.

55
00:11:22,494 --> 00:11:24,746
It must have cost a fortune.

56
00:11:24,913 --> 00:11:26,540
I'm a good eBay bidder.

57
00:11:26,707 --> 00:11:27,708
Thank you.

58
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,668
Happy birthday.

59
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:37,926
So, have you given any more thought
to us moving in together?

60
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:40,262
Yeah, I thought about it.

61
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,432
I can't move in with you.

62
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:45,434
Yeah. Thought you'd say that.

63
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:46,435
I'm sorry.

64
00:11:46,602 --> 00:11:49,104
And I think I know why.

65
00:11:51,064 --> 00:11:52,482
Are you a wizard?

66
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:53,984
What?

67
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,944
Yeah, like Doctor Strange.

68
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:57,112
No. I'm...

69
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,573
I've noticed some unusual things
happen when I'm around you.

70
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,826
Like our water always turns to coffee
whenever the waiter ignores us.

71
00:12:02,993 --> 00:12:03,994
That's your caffeine addiction talking.

72
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:06,413
And Sprite says things...

73
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,083
like you and your ex-boyfriend
broke up a century ago.

74
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:11,710
She said that?

75
00:12:11,877 --> 00:12:13,086
And he can fly.

76
00:12:13,587 --> 00:12:15,172
He's a pilot.

77
00:12:16,048 --> 00:12:18,133
Get a room, you two.

78
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,761
Can we go now?
It's past my bedtime.

79
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,934
Are you really in love?

80
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,352
What if I am?

81
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,687
You better tell him the truth, then.

82
00:12:30,854 --> 00:12:32,481
I'm working on it.

83
00:12:43,992 --> 00:12:45,494
You guys wanna get pizza?

84
00:12:45,661 --> 00:12:46,912
No, thank you!

85
00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:52,251
He won't live forever, you know.
Move in with him.

86
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:54,127
I live with you.

87
00:12:56,421 --> 00:12:57,548
Dane.

88
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:02,135
Shit! Is that a Deviant?

89
00:13:02,302 --> 00:13:03,929
Dane, run!

90
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,567
- Sersi?
- Let's go.

91
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:20,654
- What is that thing?
- A Deviant!

92
00:13:20,821 --> 00:13:21,989
You said you killed them all!

93
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:23,156
You told him that?

94
00:13:23,323 --> 00:13:24,950
- You believed me?
- I do now!

95
00:13:31,665 --> 00:13:33,208
What are you doing?

96
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,418
Keep Dane safe!

97
00:13:34,585 --> 00:13:36,461
Sersi, wait! What?

98
00:13:44,928 --> 00:13:46,054
You're fine, dude.

99
00:13:46,221 --> 00:13:47,347
Sprite!

100
00:13:52,561 --> 00:13:54,479
No. Stairs.

101
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:34,228
Run! Go! Go!

102
00:14:34,394 --> 00:14:35,771
- Go!
- Come on!

103
00:14:43,445 --> 00:14:44,821
It knows where we are!

104
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:46,073
How?

105
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,741
I don't know!

106
00:14:49,201 --> 00:14:50,202
Sprite!

107
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,167
Sprite!

108
00:15:16,353 --> 00:15:17,437
Ikaris!

109
00:15:19,064 --> 00:15:20,524
Evening, ladies.

110
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:23,443
Watch out!

111
00:15:39,668 --> 00:15:40,961
Wizard.

112
00:15:44,756 --> 00:15:45,841
Sorry.

113
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,947
Did it just heal itself?

114
00:16:28,383 --> 00:16:29,593
Ikaris.

115
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:33,263
It's good to see you.

116
00:16:33,722 --> 00:16:35,557
It's good to see you, too, Sprite.

117
00:16:41,772 --> 00:16:43,482
I'm Dane.

118
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:45,067
Hello, Dane.

119
00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:47,778
Well, I guess you must be the pilot.

120
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,502
We're Eternals,
from a planet called Olympia.

121
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:08,089
We came here 7,000 years ago
on the <i>Domo...</i>

122
00:17:08,257 --> 00:17:11,677
our starship,
to protect humans from the Deviants.

123
00:17:12,635 --> 00:17:16,847
We thought we killed them all
five centuries ago, but now they're back.

124
00:17:19,308 --> 00:17:21,395
Look, if you don't want to move in with me,
you could just say.

125
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:23,020
Dane, this is serious.

126
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:26,191
I know. I'm just still getting over
the fact you're not a wizard.

127
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:28,360
I was hoping you could change me
into a giraffe.

128
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:30,028
I always wanted to be a giraffe
when I was a kid.

129
00:17:30,195 --> 00:17:32,489
It's too bad
I can't change sentient beings.

130
00:17:32,656 --> 00:17:33,991
You would have made a very cute giraffe.

131
00:17:39,162 --> 00:17:41,206
Why didn't you guys help fight Thanos?

132
00:17:41,498 --> 00:17:44,585
Or any war? Or all the other
terrible things throughout history?

133
00:17:45,085 --> 00:17:47,337
We were instructed
not to interfere in any human conflicts...

134
00:17:47,504 --> 00:17:48,547
unless Deviants were involved.

135
00:17:48,714 --> 00:17:49,923
Why?

136
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:55,262
If we'd protected humanity from everything
for 7,000 years...

137
00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:59,308
you'd never have had the chance to
develop in the way you were meant to.

138
00:17:59,474 --> 00:18:03,687
But if the Deviants were eradicated
a long time ago...

139
00:18:03,854 --> 00:18:05,189
why are you still here?

140
00:18:05,355 --> 00:18:06,440
We've been waiting...

141
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:08,942
to be told we can go home.

142
00:18:10,777 --> 00:18:11,987
So...

143
00:18:12,821 --> 00:18:14,031
Ikaris.

144
00:18:14,865 --> 00:18:16,783
The boy who flew too close to the sun.

145
00:18:17,284 --> 00:18:19,620
Sprite made that story up
when we lived in Athens.

146
00:18:19,786 --> 00:18:22,080
In the fifth century BC?

147
00:18:22,247 --> 00:18:23,916
How long were you two together?

148
00:18:24,082 --> 00:18:25,584
5,000 years.

149
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,962
I guess you can call that long-term.

150
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,465
What happened?

151
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,550
He left.

152
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:37,304
I always thought he'd come back, but...

153
00:18:37,804 --> 00:18:39,556
he never did.

154
00:18:40,224 --> 00:18:41,516
So, I moved on.

155
00:18:41,975 --> 00:18:43,352
I'm glad you did.

156
00:18:44,394 --> 00:18:45,395
I'm sorry.

157
00:18:46,897 --> 00:18:48,315
I have to go.

158
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:59,993
<i>This morning,
an unprecedented global earthquake...</i>

159
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,745
<i>swept nation-states across the world...</i>

160
00:19:01,912 --> 00:19:03,956
<i>causing damage and panic.</i>

161
00:19:04,122 --> 00:19:06,708
<i>Many have speculated its connection
with the Blip.</i>

162
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:09,127
<i>The UN has called for
an emergency meeting...</i>

163
00:19:09,294 --> 00:19:11,421
That Deviant healed itself.

164
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:14,466
They could never do that before.

165
00:19:16,218 --> 00:19:19,638
And it was coming after us
instead of humans. What's going on?

166
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:22,516
I came to check on you
because of the earthquake.

167
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:24,768
That Deviant is news to me.

168
00:19:27,771 --> 00:19:29,606
Something's happening to Earth.

169
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:32,693
Can't be a coincidence.

170
00:19:34,194 --> 00:19:35,946
We need to find the others.

171
00:19:36,572 --> 00:19:38,532
I haven't seen some of them for centuries.

172
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:40,617
I doubt much has changed.

173
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:53,630
I'm sorry I hurt you, Sersi.

174
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:01,138
But we need to stick together.

175
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:04,600
And once I know you're safe,
I'll leave you alone.

176
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:07,895
Let's go to Ajak first.

177
00:20:08,854 --> 00:20:10,772
She'll know what to do.

178
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,320
You hear that, Sprite?

179
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,989
Family reunion.

180
00:20:19,156 --> 00:20:20,866
It's about time.

181
00:20:32,961 --> 00:20:35,255
Hey, that one was mine!
Never mind.

182
00:22:10,475 --> 00:22:11,602
Ajak.

183
00:22:12,686 --> 00:22:13,770
Arishem.

184
00:22:14,646 --> 00:22:17,816
We continue to keep Babylon safe
from the Deviants.

185
00:22:17,983 --> 00:22:20,485
More people have come to seek refuge.

186
00:22:20,652 --> 00:22:23,405
It is now the largest city on Earth.

187
00:22:23,572 --> 00:22:26,408
The Eternals serving their missions
across the galaxies...

188
00:22:26,575 --> 00:22:28,285
will learn from your success.

189
00:22:28,702 --> 00:22:29,828
Thank you.

190
00:22:32,873 --> 00:22:36,084
I respect your grand design, Arishem.

191
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:40,881
But I have noticed something special
about this planet.

192
00:22:43,008 --> 00:22:46,303
And I fear that maybe this time
the cost may...

193
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,181
Do not become attached to this planet.

194
00:22:49,348 --> 00:22:53,185
You must focus on the true purpose
of your mission.

195
00:22:54,603 --> 00:22:56,104
I understand.

196
00:22:57,356 --> 00:22:59,191
I will not let you down.

197
00:23:23,882 --> 00:23:24,925
Phastos.

198
00:23:25,092 --> 00:23:28,011
Did you go to the party last night
like I told you to?

199
00:23:28,178 --> 00:23:29,179
The party, yeah.

200
00:23:29,346 --> 00:23:30,847
- Yeah, it was...
- He worked all night.

201
00:23:31,265 --> 00:23:32,266
Who was talking to you?

202
00:23:32,432 --> 00:23:34,601
Get a life.
And where is Sersi?

203
00:23:34,768 --> 00:23:35,769
Late as usual.

204
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,939
I'm sorry, but I have something
very exciting to show you, okay?

205
00:23:39,982 --> 00:23:41,817
Wait till you see this.

206
00:23:45,612 --> 00:23:46,613
What is it?

207
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,323
It's an engine.

208
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:51,535
It moves steam from high pressure
to low pressure.

209
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,746
It'll help them till their fields
at an incredibly fast rate.

210
00:23:55,122 --> 00:23:56,290
It's gonna freak them out.

211
00:23:56,707 --> 00:23:59,293
I mean, they only have
had the wheel 1,000 years, so...

212
00:24:00,544 --> 00:24:04,381
You know, we could do that thing, you know,
where you use your mind to control them...

213
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:05,549
and then they could do it quicker.

214
00:24:05,716 --> 00:24:06,967
Ajak, you listening to this?

215
00:24:07,134 --> 00:24:09,970
Phastos, this steam...

216
00:24:10,137 --> 00:24:12,139
- Engine. It's a steam engine.
- It's too soon.

217
00:24:12,723 --> 00:24:13,724
And there she is.

218
00:24:14,141 --> 00:24:15,601
What did I miss?

219
00:24:15,851 --> 00:24:19,813
Nothing. Just the screams
of my deep disappointment.

220
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,899
I am sure you have something simpler.

221
00:24:22,065 --> 00:24:22,900
Simple.

222
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:24,651
Okay, let's see.

223
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:28,947
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you...

224
00:24:30,282 --> 00:24:31,617
the plow.

225
00:24:32,618 --> 00:24:34,578
'Cause that's what it does.

226
00:24:34,745 --> 00:24:36,038
Plows dirt.

227
00:24:36,205 --> 00:24:37,581
I met another group of settlers who are

228
00:24:37,664 --> 00:24:39,458
building their homes
in the northern fields.

229
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,001
They'll need to plant their own crops.

230
00:24:41,543 --> 00:24:43,128
- Thanks, Sersi.
- Listen...

231
00:24:43,712 --> 00:24:47,174
humanity may be coming along
slower than some of us want.

232
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:52,888
But there is no telling what wonders
they will discover as they advance.

233
00:25:23,043 --> 00:25:24,044
I just saw that.

234
00:25:24,211 --> 00:25:26,088
There's so many other chairs, man.

235
00:25:26,255 --> 00:25:27,422
You know, I could use my powers...

236
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:29,174
Come and have a drink with me.

237
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:30,634
No.

238
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:32,553
I can't let you go
and fight Deviants on your own.

239
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:34,888
- We need to guard the city.
- Get out of my way.

240
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:38,517
I didn't come to this planet
to cower behind walls.

241
00:25:39,017 --> 00:25:42,437
We need to trust Arishem's design
for this planet.

242
00:25:44,898 --> 00:25:45,858
Thena.

243
00:25:48,151 --> 00:25:50,696
It's an honor to fight alongside you.

244
00:25:52,322 --> 00:25:53,574
And you.

245
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:00,163
My beautiful Makkari. You're late.

246
00:26:55,093 --> 00:26:59,139
Well, she also says that
stealing is very, very bad.

247
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,356
Deal.

248
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:21,912
I promise I won't let my feelings
for Sersi distract me from my mission.

249
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,249
Humans are far from being able to
protect themselves from the Deviants.

250
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:27,334
We still have much to do.

251
00:27:29,002 --> 00:27:31,004
Your faith in Arishem is strong.

252
00:27:31,588 --> 00:27:33,090
I can feel it.

253
00:27:34,841 --> 00:27:37,302
But you are allowed to
live a life, you know?

254
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:40,347
Go tell Sersi how you feel.

255
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,749
Try.

256
00:28:09,376 --> 00:28:11,378
Sorry. I'm making a mess.

257
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,008
Well, not bad.

258
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:51,293
It matches your eyes.

259
00:28:54,254 --> 00:28:56,173
You're learning their language now?

260
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,467
If I want to spend more time with you...

261
00:28:58,634 --> 00:29:00,594
I need to get to know them.

262
00:29:06,975 --> 00:29:07,976
Wait, what did I say?

263
00:29:08,143 --> 00:29:11,355
You said, "I am very beautiful."

264
00:29:14,525 --> 00:29:15,567
You...

265
00:29:18,362 --> 00:29:21,073
You are very beautiful, Sersi.

266
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:34,545
I'm yours, Sersi...

267
00:29:35,712 --> 00:29:36,713
if you'll have me.

268
00:30:21,675 --> 00:30:23,260
I love you, Ikaris.

269
00:30:26,054 --> 00:30:27,681
I love you, Sersi.

270
00:31:35,123 --> 00:31:36,416
Hello?

271
00:31:40,087 --> 00:31:41,255
Ajak?

272
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:07,656
Ajak!

273
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:35,267
It was a Deviant.

274
00:32:42,691 --> 00:32:45,110
<i>♪ Our love ♪</i>

275
00:32:45,277 --> 00:32:48,614
<i>♪ And our devotion ♪</i>

276
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:54,286
<i>♪ Were as deep as any ocean ♪</i>

277
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:01,293
It was the last time I saw her.

278
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:07,341
Ajak asked me to check on Sersi,
so I went to London.

279
00:33:09,551 --> 00:33:12,971
Turned out, both of us were lonely
and we needed each other.

280
00:33:14,765 --> 00:33:16,808
I guess, in her way...

281
00:33:16,975 --> 00:33:19,978
Ajak never stopped trying to
take care of us.

282
00:33:28,529 --> 00:33:29,905
Bye, Ajak.

283
00:33:34,493 --> 00:33:36,995
It's the first time in 7,000 years
one of us has died.

284
00:33:37,538 --> 00:33:40,082
I think the Deviant
that attacked us in London...

285
00:33:40,249 --> 00:33:42,042
killed Ajak and absorbed her power.

286
00:33:42,209 --> 00:33:43,919
Deviants have never done that in the past.

287
00:33:44,086 --> 00:33:46,129
It healed itself just like Ajak.

288
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:49,216
I swear, I almost heard it speak.

289
00:34:16,243 --> 00:34:17,077
Arishem.

290
00:34:17,244 --> 00:34:18,203
Sersi.

291
00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:19,996
It is almost time.

292
00:34:21,874 --> 00:34:24,083
Sersi! Sersi! Are you okay?

293
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:26,128
What happened, Sersi?

294
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:31,757
The sphere
that Ajak used to talk with Arishem...

295
00:34:31,925 --> 00:34:34,427
it came out of her body
and went inside me.

296
00:34:34,595 --> 00:34:36,304
Did you talk with Arishem?

297
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:38,557
Yes. He said...

298
00:34:39,141 --> 00:34:40,893
it's almost time.

299
00:34:42,144 --> 00:34:43,853
Can you try talking to him again?

300
00:34:44,813 --> 00:34:46,231
I don't know how.

301
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:48,275
But she chose you to replace her.

302
00:34:48,942 --> 00:34:50,194
And she gave you the sphere.

303
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,445
Hold on, Sprite.

304
00:34:53,155 --> 00:34:54,572
Are you sure you talked with Arishem?

305
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,033
What else would it be?

306
00:34:57,284 --> 00:34:58,535
Mahd Wy'ry.

307
00:35:34,821 --> 00:35:36,073
Where are the others?

308
00:35:39,868 --> 00:35:41,495
There were more Deviants than you said.

309
00:35:41,662 --> 00:35:43,330
Well, I'm sure that was
a lot of fun for you.

310
00:35:43,664 --> 00:35:44,873
It was.

311
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:49,127
Once the others kill these
last Deviants...

312
00:35:49,878 --> 00:35:52,130
we will have eliminated them all
from the planet.

313
00:36:10,232 --> 00:36:11,567
Don't.

314
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:15,362
We don't interfere in their wars.

315
00:36:16,488 --> 00:36:18,031
This isn't war.

316
00:36:18,198 --> 00:36:19,992
It's genocide.

317
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:22,411
Their weapons have become too deadly.

318
00:36:23,787 --> 00:36:26,957
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
helping them advance, Phastos.

319
00:36:27,165 --> 00:36:30,711
Technology is a part of
their evolutionary process, Druig.

320
00:36:30,878 --> 00:36:32,421
It's not exactly something that
I can stop.

321
00:36:32,588 --> 00:36:34,590
No, you can't. But I can.

322
00:36:36,675 --> 00:36:38,343
It's too late.

323
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,971
- Thena?
- Everyone is going to die.

324
00:36:42,097 --> 00:36:43,098
Are you okay?

325
00:36:44,516 --> 00:36:45,517
Thena?

326
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,606
- Thena? Thena, no!
- Thena!

327
00:37:19,801 --> 00:37:22,137
Don't listen to your head, Thena.

328
00:37:23,138 --> 00:37:25,098
Listen to my voice.

329
00:37:26,808 --> 00:37:28,477
You are safe.

330
00:37:29,603 --> 00:37:32,189
You are loved.

331
00:37:33,106 --> 00:37:34,900
You're our Thena.

332
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:43,367
Hey, Thena!

333
00:37:43,534 --> 00:37:45,786
Hey! Stop, stop, stop!

334
00:38:04,096 --> 00:38:05,681
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

335
00:38:06,974 --> 00:38:08,100
Sersi.

336
00:38:08,267 --> 00:38:09,268
Thena, please.

337
00:38:09,893 --> 00:38:11,353
Come back to us.

338
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,063
Okay.

339
00:38:29,621 --> 00:38:31,748
I thought Mahd Wy'ry was a myth.

340
00:38:35,168 --> 00:38:36,837
There is no cure...

341
00:38:37,713 --> 00:38:39,172
so no one really talks about it.

342
00:38:44,011 --> 00:38:45,012
What happened?

343
00:38:45,178 --> 00:38:46,263
Thena.

344
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,973
You attacked everyone.

345
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,767
Wounded Sersi, Phastos...

346
00:38:50,934 --> 00:38:52,895
you nearly killed Makkari.

347
00:38:55,355 --> 00:38:57,191
I don't remember.

348
00:38:57,357 --> 00:38:59,443
You have Mahd Wy'ry.

349
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:03,780
Your mind is fracturing
under the weight of your memories.

350
00:39:03,947 --> 00:39:08,202
And all I can do is erase them
so that you can start over.

351
00:39:09,328 --> 00:39:12,581
I will have to inform Arishem
and take you back to the ship...

352
00:39:12,748 --> 00:39:15,584
where we have the technology to help you.

353
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:20,130
What if it happens again?
She could've killed you.

354
00:39:20,297 --> 00:39:21,798
She could have killed all of us.

355
00:39:21,965 --> 00:39:22,966
Please.

356
00:39:24,635 --> 00:39:27,137
Please, I want to remember.

357
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,057
I want to remember my life.

358
00:39:30,682 --> 00:39:32,184
Thena, I love you.

359
00:39:32,351 --> 00:39:33,977
But listen to me.

360
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:37,731
It's not important if you remember or not.

361
00:39:38,273 --> 00:39:40,025
Your spirit will remain.

362
00:39:40,192 --> 00:39:42,986
You will always be Thena deep inside.

363
00:39:43,445 --> 00:39:44,446
Trust me.

364
00:39:44,613 --> 00:39:45,864
Why should she trust you?

365
00:39:47,658 --> 00:39:50,285
You're asking her
to let you erase who she is.

366
00:39:50,452 --> 00:39:52,287
Druig, I know you're upset, but...

367
00:39:52,454 --> 00:39:53,497
Upset?

368
00:39:55,499 --> 00:39:58,710
We've trusted you for 7,000 years,
and look where you've gotten us.

369
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:05,217
I've watched humans destroy each other
when I could stop it all in a heartbeat.

370
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:09,763
Do you know what that does to someone
after centuries?

371
00:40:11,056 --> 00:40:13,141
Could our mission have been a mistake?

372
00:40:13,934 --> 00:40:17,145
Are we really helping these people
build a better world, huh?

373
00:40:26,196 --> 00:40:28,574
We're just like the soldiers down there.

374
00:40:29,408 --> 00:40:31,577
Pawns to their leaders.

375
00:40:32,244 --> 00:40:34,329
Blinded by loyalty.

376
00:40:37,374 --> 00:40:39,084
It ends now.

377
00:40:56,852 --> 00:40:57,853
Let them go.

378
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,354
You're gonna have to make me.

379
00:40:59,521 --> 00:41:00,522
Stop.

380
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,614
If you wanna stop me...

381
00:41:09,907 --> 00:41:11,783
you're gonna have to kill me.

382
00:41:35,515 --> 00:41:37,351
I'll watch over Thena.

383
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,144
Let her keep her memories.

384
00:41:40,395 --> 00:41:42,439
One day, when she attacks you...

385
00:41:43,065 --> 00:41:45,108
you might have to kill her.

386
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,991
We'll take that chance.

387
00:42:02,793 --> 00:42:03,961
You may all go.

388
00:42:06,421 --> 00:42:08,131
The Deviants are gone.

389
00:42:09,007 --> 00:42:11,969
There is no reason
for you to stay with me.

390
00:42:12,135 --> 00:42:13,720
Shouldn't you ask Arishem first?

391
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,722
We're a team, we should stay together.

392
00:42:15,889 --> 00:42:18,809
I didn't ask you for your advice, Ikaris.

393
00:42:18,976 --> 00:42:21,311
Do not forget your place.

394
00:42:24,523 --> 00:42:26,775
This is where we say goodbye.

395
00:42:27,901 --> 00:42:29,486
You are free to go.

396
00:42:30,863 --> 00:42:33,031
I want you to go out there.

397
00:42:33,198 --> 00:42:35,951
And live a life for yourselves.

398
00:42:36,118 --> 00:42:37,870
Not as soldiers.

399
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:41,540
Not with the purpose
you were given.

400
00:42:41,915 --> 00:42:44,710
Find your own purpose.

401
00:42:45,586 --> 00:42:49,756
And one day,
when we see each other again...

402
00:42:52,217 --> 00:42:55,220
I want you to tell me what you found.

403
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,518

I am Karun Patel.

414
00:44:08,085 --> 00:44:09,336
Kingo's valet.

415
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:13,549
It's truly an honor to be in the presence
of the great Eternals.

416
00:44:15,342 --> 00:44:18,804
<i>♪ Like the fire

00:44:31,692 --> 00:44:34,820
Cut! Okay, everyone, that was good.

419
00:44:34,987 --> 00:44:36,738
But we could do 10% better.

420
00:44:36,905 --> 00:44:38,991
That was beautiful. Very, very good.

421
00:44:39,157 --> 00:44:40,158
Really, so good.

422
00:44:41,243 --> 00:44:43,328
My friends from college are here.

423
00:44:44,037 --> 00:44:44,872
Hello, boss!

424
00:44:45,581 --> 00:44:48,166
Perfect timing! Welcome to the set of...

425
00:44:51,295 --> 00:44:52,379
I'm playing you!

426
00:44:52,546 --> 00:44:54,214
- You like the costume?
- We need to talk.

427
00:44:54,381 --> 00:44:55,716
Tell the director
I have some notes for him...

428
00:44:55,883 --> 00:44:57,050
We need to talk to you in private.

429
00:44:57,676 --> 00:45:01,138
Oh, Karun, he's worked with me
for 50 years. I trust him completely.

430
00:45:01,305 --> 00:45:03,724
Actually, when we first met,
he thought I was a vampire...

431
00:45:03,891 --> 00:45:05,183
and he tried to stake me through the heart.

432
00:45:05,726 --> 00:45:07,436
I have apologized so many times.

433
00:45:07,603 --> 00:45:10,189
Not quite enough times.
Very close, though. I'll let you know.

434
00:45:10,355 --> 00:45:13,358
I have to get ready for the next scene.
Come to my tent, we'll talk there.

435
00:45:13,525 --> 00:45:14,693
You guys are gonna love the next scene.

436
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:17,779
I come in on a wire
'cause, you know, I can't fly.

437
00:45:17,946 --> 00:45:19,698
Wait, are we getting back together?

438
00:45:19,865 --> 00:45:20,866
We need to talk.

439
00:45:21,033 --> 00:45:21,992
I've been waiting for the day...

440
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:24,328
the world learns the true identity
of the Shadow Warrior.

441
00:45:24,494 --> 00:45:25,954
Ajak's dead.

442
00:45:31,043 --> 00:45:32,419
She was killed.

443
00:45:33,337 --> 00:45:34,713
It was a Deviant.

444
00:45:39,259 --> 00:45:40,886
The Deviants are back.

445
00:45:41,053 --> 00:45:42,512
We don't know how many there are.

446
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:47,851
You need to come with us.

447
00:46:04,076 --> 00:46:06,203
I can't just go. I mean,
all these people depend on me.

448
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:08,914
We just started shooting this movie.
It's the first of a trilogy.

449
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,542
We just got BTS to do a cameo...

450
00:46:13,126 --> 00:46:14,294
Sir...

451
00:46:14,711 --> 00:46:16,672
- may I say something?
- Please don't say anything.

452
00:46:16,838 --> 00:46:17,881
I think you should go.

453
00:46:18,048 --> 00:46:19,258
I just said don't say anything.

454
00:46:19,424 --> 00:46:23,679
"Life affords no greater duty
than to protect one's family!"

455
00:46:24,555 --> 00:46:26,515
Remember? It's your favorite line...

456
00:46:26,682 --> 00:46:31,186
from <i>The Shadow Warrior 2: Voyage of Time.</i>

457
00:46:31,937 --> 00:46:33,772
Your family needs you.

458
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,869
Seven thousand years.

459
00:46:48,662 --> 00:46:52,374
That's how long the battle between
Eternals and Deviants has raged for.

460
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,002
You think I'm a movie star.

461
00:46:55,168 --> 00:46:58,005
<i>Well, I am. But I am also...</i>

462
00:46:58,922 --> 00:47:00,507
<i>an Eternal.</i>

463
00:47:00,674 --> 00:47:02,175
<i>Kingo, what are you doing?</i>

464
00:47:03,051 --> 00:47:06,305
I think we should be remembered, so...

465
00:47:06,471 --> 00:47:10,517
I am making a documentary about us.

466
00:47:10,684 --> 00:47:13,687
You are about to meet
my fellow Eternal, Sprite.

467
00:47:13,854 --> 00:47:16,064
Sprite, tell them about yourself.

468
00:47:16,231 --> 00:47:17,566
Oh, wait.

469
00:47:21,445 --> 00:47:23,947
<i>Okay, well, we'll circle back to her.</i>

470
00:47:24,615 --> 00:47:26,825
This is Sersi.

471
00:47:27,409 --> 00:47:28,410
Sersi...

472
00:47:28,577 --> 00:47:30,412
tell them about yourself.

473
00:47:32,664 --> 00:47:33,665
<i>We're rolling.</i>

474
00:47:33,832 --> 00:47:34,666
<i>Well...</i>

475
00:47:36,335 --> 00:47:40,923
I can change a rock into water.

476
00:47:41,715 --> 00:47:44,218
I could turn a rock into wood.

477
00:47:44,384 --> 00:47:46,470
Or a rock into metal.

478
00:47:46,637 --> 00:47:48,805
Actually, one time,
I turned a rock into air.

479
00:47:48,972 --> 00:47:49,848
Cut.

480
00:47:50,432 --> 00:47:52,059
You know what?
Why don't you think about it,

481
00:47:52,142 --> 00:47:54,061
and we'll get back to you, okay?

482
00:47:54,228 --> 00:47:55,479
Let's go.

483
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:00,526
Sprite says you're addicted to this thing.

484
00:48:02,653 --> 00:48:03,820
Oh, this?

485
00:48:04,696 --> 00:48:06,198
Look at this.

486
00:48:09,034 --> 00:48:11,161
You know, seeing as we don't age.

487
00:48:11,662 --> 00:48:13,497
I think you look quite good.

488
00:48:15,082 --> 00:48:16,083
Don't you?

489
00:48:20,254 --> 00:48:24,132
Nobody ever wonders how you managed to be
the leading man for over 100 years?

490
00:48:24,299 --> 00:48:25,842
I don't know what you're talking about.

491
00:48:26,009 --> 00:48:28,178
That is my great-great-grandfather...

492
00:48:28,345 --> 00:48:30,681
that is my great-grandfather...

493
00:48:30,847 --> 00:48:31,848
grandfather...

494
00:48:32,015 --> 00:48:34,059
father, and me.

495
00:48:34,226 --> 00:48:37,229
I'm part of the greatest dynasty
in the history of Bollywood.

496
00:48:37,688 --> 00:48:38,689
Pretty impressive, right?

497
00:48:38,856 --> 00:48:40,899
You abandoned me in Macedonia.

498
00:48:42,651 --> 00:48:46,113
Okay, I got sick of
moving every five years.

499
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,241
People freak out
when they notice that you don't...

500
00:48:51,326 --> 00:48:52,327
age.

501
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:55,038
I thought we were friends.

502
00:49:02,045 --> 00:49:03,922
Do you know why I love movies?

503
00:49:04,798 --> 00:49:06,383
Because of you.

504
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:09,344
I missed sitting in the audience,
listening to your stories...

505
00:49:09,511 --> 00:49:10,762
watching your illusions.

506
00:49:15,601 --> 00:49:17,811
We should've all stayed together.

507
00:49:19,813 --> 00:49:21,899
Ajak would still be alive.

508
00:49:23,483 --> 00:49:25,277
She should have never let us go.

509
00:49:36,121 --> 00:49:37,915
This is the Deviant you fought in London?

510
00:49:38,332 --> 00:49:39,750
It's different.

511
00:49:40,542 --> 00:49:42,586
There must be more out there
than we thought.

512
00:49:44,171 --> 00:49:46,173
Is this a Deviant, sir?

513
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,382
Yep.

514
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,010
It's a beautiful creature.

515
00:49:50,177 --> 00:49:53,639
What? This? This?
No. It's hideous.

516
00:49:53,805 --> 00:49:56,433
You've never had one
try to bite your head off. Roll.

517
00:49:58,018 --> 00:50:01,313
You're about to meet two of the greatest
warriors the world has ever known.

518
00:50:01,772 --> 00:50:05,192
<i>Thena, legendary, deadly, fashionable.</i>

519
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,069
And her trusty friend...

520
00:50:07,236 --> 00:50:08,320
Door.

521
00:50:09,029 --> 00:50:10,948
...a mighty powerhouse of strength...

522
00:50:11,114 --> 00:50:14,076
<i>the fearsome Gilgamesh!</i>

523
00:50:16,578 --> 00:50:17,621
Gilgamesh!

524
00:50:20,624 --> 00:50:22,209
<i>What took you so long?</i>

525
00:50:25,337 --> 00:50:27,130
You look younger today, Sprite.

526
00:50:27,297 --> 00:50:28,799
I have the same apron.

527
00:50:29,299 --> 00:50:30,592
Who the hell are you?

528
00:50:31,009 --> 00:50:33,095
I'm Karun. Kingo's valet.

529
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,348
Oh, valet. Like Alfred in <i>Batman.</i>

530
00:50:36,807 --> 00:50:39,184
Gilgamesh. The Deviants are back.

531
00:50:39,351 --> 00:50:41,937
No shit. I could have used some help.

532
00:50:42,104 --> 00:50:44,565
We were attacked by a Deviant
in London, too.

533
00:50:44,731 --> 00:50:46,483
Even Ikaris couldn't kill it.

534
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:48,360
You couldn't?

535
00:50:48,527 --> 00:50:50,529
I was distracted.

536
00:50:50,696 --> 00:50:51,989
Sure, man.

537
00:50:52,906 --> 00:50:55,492
Hey, you guys wanna try my pie?

538
00:50:57,786 --> 00:50:59,371
I'm sorry, Gil.

539
00:51:00,038 --> 00:51:01,415
Ajak's dead.

540
00:51:04,251 --> 00:51:05,544
It's true, buddy.

541
00:51:06,086 --> 00:51:07,421
We lost her.

542
00:51:39,411 --> 00:51:40,579
Sersi.

543
00:51:41,997 --> 00:51:43,874
The attack triggered her.

544
00:51:44,041 --> 00:51:45,959
She's no fun to be around right now.

545
00:51:47,544 --> 00:51:49,046
Hey, Thena.

546
00:51:49,463 --> 00:51:51,340
Look who's here.

547
00:51:52,216 --> 00:51:53,383
Give me your hand.

548
00:51:56,136 --> 00:51:57,179
Thena.

549
00:51:57,596 --> 00:52:00,349
Everyone in Centuri-6 is going to die.

550
00:52:01,058 --> 00:52:02,100
Give me your hand.

551
00:52:02,267 --> 00:52:04,478
It's too late. We can't save them.

552
00:52:04,645 --> 00:52:05,521
Thena.

553
00:52:12,569 --> 00:52:13,820
Thena.

554
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:17,241
We came to Earth together on our ship.

555
00:52:19,535 --> 00:52:21,245
You're an Eternal.

556
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:24,831
The greatest warrior of Olympia.

557
00:52:24,998 --> 00:52:27,084
The legendary protector of Athens.

558
00:52:28,585 --> 00:52:30,504
The goddess of war.

559
00:52:32,506 --> 00:52:34,841
Remember who you are.

560
00:52:42,891 --> 00:52:44,351
Remember.

561
00:53:00,242 --> 00:53:02,202
- Thena.
- Hi.

562
00:53:03,161 --> 00:53:04,162
Hello.

563
00:53:04,538 --> 00:53:06,498
Hey, who's your gardener?

564
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,210
This is just what you guys eat every day?

565
00:53:10,377 --> 00:53:11,962
- Yeah, this is amazing.
- Every day.

566
00:53:12,129 --> 00:53:14,214
- Thank you for this.
- Oh, you're welcome.

567
00:53:14,381 --> 00:53:15,549
Help yourself.

568
00:53:15,716 --> 00:53:18,886
This one is a trio of
wine, beer, and mead.

569
00:53:19,052 --> 00:53:21,513
Made for all the soldiers
in the battle of Troy.

570
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,765
That's so thoughtful.

571
00:53:30,564 --> 00:53:32,149
Should she be drinking?

572
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,820
No, hers is non-alcoholic. For kids.

573
00:53:38,906 --> 00:53:41,074
I gave you the same thing, Sprite.

574
00:53:43,702 --> 00:53:44,703
For kids.

575
00:53:46,955 --> 00:53:48,248
I was just kidding.

576
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:51,793
Yours is a secret brew
Odin taught me as a thank-you...

577
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,088
after we helped defeat Laufey's army
in Tonsberg.

578
00:53:55,255 --> 00:53:56,340
What?

579
00:53:57,674 --> 00:53:58,675
I'm a big baby.

580
00:53:58,842 --> 00:54:00,719
Very mature. Can you stop?

581
00:54:01,595 --> 00:54:02,930
- Stop.
- Speaking of Odin...

582
00:54:03,096 --> 00:54:05,682
Thor used to follow me around
when he was a little kid.

583
00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:08,477
Now he's a famous Avenger
and won't return my calls.

584
00:54:08,644 --> 00:54:10,979
So, now that Captain Rogers
and Iron Man are both gone...

585
00:54:11,146 --> 00:54:13,106
who do you think is gonna
lead the Avengers?

586
00:54:13,774 --> 00:54:15,275
I could lead them.

587
00:54:15,442 --> 00:54:16,652
I figure I'd be good at that.

588
00:54:16,818 --> 00:54:17,653
Yeah, you would.

589
00:54:17,986 --> 00:54:20,030
Ajak didn't even choose you to lead us.

590
00:54:20,781 --> 00:54:22,616
Ouch, Gil. Ouch.

591
00:54:22,783 --> 00:54:23,784
- Harsh.
- I'm gonna let that one slide...

592
00:54:23,951 --> 00:54:26,495
because, you know, you've always been
bitter that I can fly and you can't.

593
00:54:26,662 --> 00:54:27,871
So what, you can fly.

594
00:54:28,038 --> 00:54:29,748
I'm better-looking, everybody knows that.

595
00:54:29,915 --> 00:54:30,916
Where you going?

596
00:54:32,918 --> 00:54:34,586
I'm just gonna get some air.

597
00:54:40,467 --> 00:54:41,843
This is really good, Gil.

598
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:45,222
You know, I could sell this.
Put my face on it, move some units.

599
00:54:45,389 --> 00:54:46,682
I made it from corn.

600
00:54:46,848 --> 00:54:50,686
I chew each kernel myself
and ferment it in my spit.

601
00:55:04,741 --> 00:55:07,578
Is this the Centuri-6
Thena was talking about?

602
00:55:07,911 --> 00:55:09,705
Yeah, it's a planet.

603
00:55:10,622 --> 00:55:14,251
She thinks she used to live there
until it was destroyed.

604
00:55:14,418 --> 00:55:18,088
Always talks about
massive quakes ripping it apart.

605
00:55:18,255 --> 00:55:20,173
Everyone died, including herself.

606
00:55:20,591 --> 00:55:23,260
We had an unprecedented global earthquake
three days ago.

607
00:55:23,927 --> 00:55:25,762
Oh, that's what that was.

608
00:55:25,929 --> 00:55:27,681
I thought I was drunk.

609
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:30,601
Ajak chose me to lead us, but...

610
00:55:31,351 --> 00:55:33,896
I can't even figure out
how to speak to Arishem.

611
00:55:34,062 --> 00:55:35,939
I've tried so many times.

612
00:55:37,149 --> 00:55:39,234
Maybe you're trying too hard.

613
00:55:40,194 --> 00:55:42,779
Sometimes, you just have to listen.

614
00:56:30,244 --> 00:56:31,370
Sersi.

615
00:56:32,246 --> 00:56:33,330
Arishem.

616
00:56:33,914 --> 00:56:35,791
Ajak was killed by a Deviant.

617
00:56:35,958 --> 00:56:38,377
We think it absorbed her power.

618
00:56:38,544 --> 00:56:41,296
And something unusual
is happening to Earth.

619
00:56:41,463 --> 00:56:44,466
It is a side effect of the emergence.

620
00:56:45,884 --> 00:56:47,511
The emergence?

621
00:56:48,262 --> 00:56:52,432
It is time for you to learn
the true purpose of your mission.

622
00:56:52,599 --> 00:56:57,938
You were sent to Earth to
bring forth the Celestial Tiamut.

623
00:56:59,147 --> 00:57:03,819
Every billion years,
new Celestials must be born.

624
00:57:04,403 --> 00:57:08,907
I plant Celestial seeds into host planets
across the universe.

625
00:57:11,034 --> 00:57:14,913
The planet Earth was chosen
to host the Celestial Tiamut.

626
00:57:20,294 --> 00:57:21,920
<i>In order to grow...</i>

627
00:57:22,087 --> 00:57:25,924
<i>Tiamut needs vast amounts of energy
from intelligent life.</i>

628
00:57:26,925 --> 00:57:30,429
<i>The Deviants prevented this
by consuming humans...</i>

629
00:57:30,596 --> 00:57:33,265
<i>until the Eternals eliminated them.</i>

630
00:57:33,891 --> 00:57:39,813
<i>Now, the human population of this planet
has reached the required amount.</i>

631
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:43,025
<i>It is time for the emergence to begin.</i>

632
00:58:03,003 --> 00:58:04,087
But...

633
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,132
everyone on Earth will die.

634
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,887
The end of one life, Sersi...

635
00:58:13,263 --> 00:58:16,058
<i>is the beginning of another.</i>

636
00:58:28,904 --> 00:58:32,783
<i>Our universe
is a constant exchange of energy.</i>

637
00:58:33,784 --> 00:58:37,829
<i>An infinite cycle of creation
and destruction.</i>

638
00:58:38,747 --> 00:58:40,999
<i>Celestials use energy...</i>

639
00:58:41,166 --> 00:58:44,253
<i>gathered from host planets
to create suns...</i>

640
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:48,173
<i>generating gravity, heat, and light...</i>

641
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:50,842
<i>for new galaxies to form.</i>

642
00:58:55,847 --> 00:58:57,474
<i>Without us...</i>

643
00:58:57,641 --> 00:59:00,811
<i>our universe will fall into darkness.</i>

644
00:59:03,564 --> 00:59:05,440
All life will die.

645
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:08,402
Ajak knew the truth?

646
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:13,699
She has helped many Celestials
to emerge over millions of years.

647
00:59:13,866 --> 00:59:15,576
So have you.

648
00:59:17,953 --> 00:59:19,830
Earth was my first mission.

649
00:59:21,707 --> 00:59:25,419
I was home, on Olympia.

650
00:59:26,795 --> 00:59:29,214
There is no Olympia.

651
00:59:47,316 --> 00:59:50,360
This is your true home, Sersi.

652
00:59:51,403 --> 00:59:53,113
The World Forge.

653
00:59:55,949 --> 01:00:00,204
It is here that I built
and programmed the Eternals.

654
01:00:36,198 --> 01:00:38,200
Everything dies except us...

655
01:00:39,493 --> 01:00:41,537
because we were never alive.

656
01:00:45,749 --> 01:00:47,543
Why don't I remember any of this?

657
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:02,599
Because your memories are erased and reset
after each emergence.

658
01:01:03,725 --> 01:01:05,269
They are stored here.

659
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:09,606
Why do you keep them?

660
01:01:10,274 --> 01:01:13,694
I keep them in order
to study the Deviants.

661
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:17,406
I created the Deviants, Sersi...

662
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:20,492
for the same purpose I created you.

663
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:25,414
<i>Every Celestial host planet
has its own predators.</i>

664
01:01:29,126 --> 01:01:32,296
<i>I first sent the Deviants
to exterminate them...</i>

665
01:01:32,462 --> 01:01:35,007
<i>so intelligent life could grow.</i>

666
01:01:40,554 --> 01:01:43,223
<i>But there was a flaw in their design.</i>

667
01:01:44,433 --> 01:01:45,767
<i>They evolved.</i>

668
01:01:45,934 --> 01:01:47,978
<i>Became predators themselves.</i>

669
01:01:49,938 --> 01:01:52,149
And I lost control of them.

670
01:01:54,234 --> 01:01:57,237
I built and programmed you, Eternals...

671
01:01:57,404 --> 01:02:01,241
to be synthetic beings
and incapable of evolution...

672
01:02:01,408 --> 01:02:03,577
to correct my mistake.

673
01:02:05,579 --> 01:02:10,000
Sersi, Ajak has chosen you
to take her place...

674
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:12,419
as the Prime Eternal.

675
01:02:13,003 --> 01:02:14,796
Do not fail me.

676
01:02:33,273 --> 01:02:35,901
So, you're saying
we're basically fancy robots?

677
01:02:36,068 --> 01:02:39,363
And our past memories
are stored somewhere...

678
01:02:40,155 --> 01:02:41,740
in space?

679
01:02:41,907 --> 01:02:44,243
And Arishem made the Deviants.

680
01:02:46,078 --> 01:02:47,829
I'm sorry, Thena.

681
01:02:47,996 --> 01:02:49,414
You tried to warn us.

682
01:02:49,581 --> 01:02:53,585
The last time Arishem reset your memories,
something must have gone wrong.

683
01:02:54,336 --> 01:02:55,379
What do you mean?

684
01:02:55,546 --> 01:02:58,882
Well, that's what Mahd Wy'ry is, isn't it?

685
01:02:59,049 --> 01:03:02,553
All this time, Thena was remembering
all the other planets we were sent to...

686
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:04,805
and everyone dying during the emergence.

687
01:03:05,264 --> 01:03:06,723
I thought we were heroes.

688
01:03:07,391 --> 01:03:08,725
Turns out we're the bad guys.

689
01:03:08,892 --> 01:03:11,186
We're not the bad guys, okay?

690
01:03:11,353 --> 01:03:14,231
We've helped the Celestials
expand life across the universe.

691
01:03:14,398 --> 01:03:17,568
That's not what bad guys do.
That's what good guys do.

692
01:03:17,734 --> 01:03:20,654
Every time innocent lives have
been sacrificed for the greater good...

693
01:03:20,821 --> 01:03:22,865
it turns out to be a mistake.

694
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:25,158
We have to stop the emergence.

695
01:03:25,325 --> 01:03:28,954
Sersi, we have no right
to stop the birth of a Celestial.

696
01:03:29,121 --> 01:03:31,999
There has to be a way Tiamut can emerge
without destroying the Earth.

697
01:03:33,083 --> 01:03:36,295
We just have to delay it
until we figure out how.

698
01:03:37,129 --> 01:03:39,339
Could Druig control its mind?

699
01:03:39,506 --> 01:03:41,758
Maybe put it to sleep?

700
01:03:41,925 --> 01:03:43,051
"Put it to sleep"?

701
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:44,636
Are you serious?

702
01:03:44,803 --> 01:03:47,306
Gilgamesh asked Druig
to put me to sleep once.

703
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,350
So I could take a
vacation to Fiji, you know?

704
01:03:50,517 --> 01:03:53,228
- We're talking about a Celestial, okay?
- We have to try.

705
01:03:53,395 --> 01:03:56,732
Come on, we're not gonna let
everyone on Earth die, right?

706
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:58,233
Right.

707
01:04:00,152 --> 01:04:03,071
I'm human. I'm a little biased.

708
01:04:07,576 --> 01:04:08,952
And do what?

709
01:04:09,578 --> 01:04:11,205
Watch TV?

710
01:04:11,371 --> 01:04:14,875
When I could be
with the Earth's original superheroes...

711
01:04:15,042 --> 01:04:17,461
as they try to save the world?

712
01:04:18,295 --> 01:04:19,504
Fine.

713
01:04:19,671 --> 01:04:22,216
If you want to, stay.

714
01:04:22,382 --> 01:04:24,134
Thank you very much, sir.

715
01:04:25,844 --> 01:04:27,054
Gilgamesh...

716
01:04:27,221 --> 01:04:28,764
could you please
get rid of the saliva beer?

717
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:30,224
I thought you liked it, man.

718
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:32,392
We need to go. Now.

719
01:04:33,227 --> 01:04:34,603
Find the others.

720
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:36,188
Once we're all together...

721
01:04:36,355 --> 01:04:39,066
we'll decide what to do
about the emergence.

722
01:05:13,016 --> 01:05:14,601
It's very nice here, sir.

723
01:05:14,768 --> 01:05:16,061
Don't be fooled.

724
01:05:17,187 --> 01:05:19,273
Ignorance is bliss.

725
01:05:35,247 --> 01:05:36,456
Hello, Sprite.

726
01:05:44,298 --> 01:05:46,174
I missed all of you.

727
01:05:49,136 --> 01:05:53,056
Please, make yourselves at home.

728
01:05:57,895 --> 01:06:00,898
You've given me a lot of bad news
in one go, my lady.

729
01:06:01,648 --> 01:06:02,816
Will you help us?

730
01:06:03,317 --> 01:06:04,318
I am glad that...

731
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:12,576
Hey, what's your service?

732
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:14,536
I'm not getting any bars.

733
01:06:16,246 --> 01:06:19,583
Do you all remember this forest?
Beautiful.

734
01:06:20,751 --> 01:06:22,794
It was the last place
we all lived together.

735
01:06:24,254 --> 01:06:27,216
I've protected these people
for 20 generations now...

736
01:06:27,382 --> 01:06:30,385
from the outside world
and from themselves.

737
01:06:30,552 --> 01:06:32,304
Your kind, my friend,

738
01:06:32,387 --> 01:06:35,265
you will be responsible
for your own extinction one day.

739
01:06:35,807 --> 01:06:37,351
Don't you think?

740
01:06:37,809 --> 01:06:40,979
I think we must learn from our mistakes
and do better, sir.

741
01:06:41,146 --> 01:06:43,023
You must not give up hope.

742
01:06:45,943 --> 01:06:47,361
Oh, no, you didn't.

743
01:06:47,528 --> 01:06:50,030
Okay, new rule,
no more possessing people's valets.

744
01:06:50,197 --> 01:06:51,657
Where is your sense of humor, Kingo?

745
01:06:51,823 --> 01:06:52,824
I'm sorry, sir.

746
01:06:52,991 --> 01:06:55,202
Don't apologize, it's not your fault.

747
01:06:55,953 --> 01:06:58,580
You are not a god.
You know that, right?

748
01:06:58,747 --> 01:07:02,376
How ironic. Kingo, the movie star.

749
01:07:02,543 --> 01:07:04,127
I've directed some things, too.

750
01:07:04,294 --> 01:07:05,671
Oh, yeah? Like what?

751
01:07:06,296 --> 01:07:07,881
Some Internet content.

752
01:07:08,632 --> 01:07:09,633
How many views?

753
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,718
I don't do it for the views.

754
01:07:11,885 --> 01:07:13,679
Let's go. He's wasting our time.

755
01:07:13,845 --> 01:07:16,139
- We need him.
- Ikaris.

756
01:07:17,182 --> 01:07:18,267
I missed you.

757
01:07:19,184 --> 01:07:21,270
Are you gonna charm me or threaten me?

758
01:07:21,436 --> 01:07:23,480
I mean, there's a third option,
if you prefer that.

759
01:07:23,647 --> 01:07:26,525
It must be heartbreaking to find out
that you're not Mother's favorite.

760
01:07:26,692 --> 01:07:28,360
And I'm sure she'd be real proud
of what you've been up to.

761
01:07:28,527 --> 01:07:29,528
Druig, this is serious.

762
01:07:29,695 --> 01:07:31,488
I'll tell you what's serious.

763
01:07:32,406 --> 01:07:33,991
I've just been told I've been sent on

764
01:07:34,074 --> 01:07:36,368
a suicide mission
for the past 7,000 years...

765
01:07:36,535 --> 01:07:39,913
and that my entire existence is a lie.

766
01:07:43,083 --> 01:07:46,420
So, excuse me for not giving a shit
about your plan right now.

767
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,718
Druig sucks.

768
01:07:52,885 --> 01:07:54,511
He does, sir.

769
01:08:14,989 --> 01:08:16,742
I don't like this place.

770
01:08:17,201 --> 01:08:20,412
Druig needs to think,
and Sersi wants us to wait, so...

771
01:08:20,578 --> 01:08:21,788
we wait.

772
01:08:23,665 --> 01:08:27,502
I couldn't recognize myself
in Sprite's illusions.

773
01:08:28,587 --> 01:08:30,797
Those were the good old days.

774
01:08:32,674 --> 01:08:35,219
What if I can't fight anymore?

775
01:08:36,386 --> 01:08:37,930
Of course you can.

776
01:08:38,971 --> 01:08:41,015
What if I hurt you again?

777
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:46,605
Come on. You know who you are.
You're Thena, goddess of war.

778
01:08:51,443 --> 01:08:52,861
Thank you.

779
01:08:54,321 --> 01:08:55,572
For what?

780
01:08:57,448 --> 01:08:59,660
For always taking care of me.

781
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:03,747
I'd do it again.

782
01:09:06,582 --> 01:09:08,544
On any planet.

783
01:09:27,688 --> 01:09:29,147
I like watching him, too.

784
01:09:29,314 --> 01:09:30,482
Jeez.

785
01:09:31,608 --> 01:09:33,234
I don't think it's creepy at all.

786
01:09:35,863 --> 01:09:37,698
Have you read <i>Peter Pan?</i>

787
01:09:37,864 --> 01:09:40,993
Okay, so, to me, Ikaris is Peter...

788
01:09:41,158 --> 01:09:45,497
Sersi is Wendy, you are Tinker Bell,
for obvious reasons...

789
01:09:46,747 --> 01:09:49,126
and the rest of us are the Lost Boys.

790
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:51,086
What's your point?

791
01:09:51,545 --> 01:09:54,089
Tinker Bell's always
been in love with Peter.

792
01:09:57,509 --> 01:10:00,721
And it's hard for her
'cause she can never be with him.

793
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,142
I'm sorry, Sprite.

794
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:08,312
Kingo...

795
01:10:10,898 --> 01:10:13,400
why did Arishem make me this way?

796
01:10:15,485 --> 01:10:16,945
I don't know.

797
01:10:24,536 --> 01:10:25,913
I thought you broke it.

798
01:10:26,079 --> 01:10:27,873
Always bring backups.

799
01:10:33,003 --> 01:10:34,796
You have a very angry family, sir.

800
01:10:35,547 --> 01:10:37,424
Yeah, it's a big issue.

801
01:10:37,591 --> 01:10:40,510
<i>What about King Midas?
Everything he touched turned to gold.</i>

802
01:10:40,677 --> 01:10:41,678
<i>- Was that you?
</i>- Dane.

803
01:10:41,845 --> 01:10:43,764
<i>- Confucius? Aristotle?
</i>- Call your uncle.

804
01:10:43,931 --> 01:10:45,515
<i>What? My uncle? No.</i>

805
01:10:45,682 --> 01:10:47,851
You've always wanted
to make amends with him, right?

806
01:10:48,018 --> 01:10:50,395
Now is the time. Trust me.

807
01:10:50,562 --> 01:10:52,147
<i>Sersi, you're so weird.</i>

808
01:10:52,314 --> 01:10:53,565
Dane? Dane?

809
01:10:55,984 --> 01:10:57,444
You're breaking up.

810
01:10:57,611 --> 01:10:58,654
You're breaking up?

811
01:11:01,365 --> 01:11:02,991
How did he take the news?

812
01:11:03,408 --> 01:11:05,994
Couldn't bring myself to tell him
it was the end of the world.

813
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:08,413
There's nothing he could do.

814
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:09,581
Sersi.

815
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,670
I'm worried about you.

816
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:18,632
If Arishem finds out
you're trying to stop the emergence...

817
01:11:20,592 --> 01:11:23,512
I'm not powerful enough
to protect you from him.

818
01:11:29,059 --> 01:11:30,561
I'm not afraid.

819
01:11:31,812 --> 01:11:34,231
This violent cycle has to end.

820
01:11:38,735 --> 01:11:40,571
Hey, stop worrying about me.

821
01:11:41,655 --> 01:11:42,990
Old habit.

822
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:52,291
Why did you leave?

823
01:11:54,084 --> 01:11:55,210
I told myself...

824
01:11:56,086 --> 01:11:58,088
something must have happened to you.

825
01:11:58,255 --> 01:12:00,257
So, I waited.

826
01:12:00,424 --> 01:12:02,885
Days became years...

827
01:12:03,051 --> 01:12:05,262
and you never came back.

828
01:12:07,139 --> 01:12:08,724
Sersi...

829
01:12:09,474 --> 01:12:11,310
I've missed you.

830
01:12:13,979 --> 01:12:15,981
I didn't want to leave.

831
01:12:19,067 --> 01:12:20,277
There's something I have to tell...

832
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:22,112
Ikaris!

833
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:23,947
Ikaris!

834
01:12:33,123 --> 01:12:34,625
Watch out!

835
01:12:34,791 --> 01:12:36,376
Clear the camp!

836
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:40,756
Get behind me!

837
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:41,924
One of them took Ikaris.

838
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:43,258
It's an ambush!

839
01:12:52,684 --> 01:12:54,228
Very nice, sir!

840
01:12:54,561 --> 01:12:56,104
<i>Are you mental? Hide!</i>

841
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:58,649
We need action sequences.

842
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:00,484
Sir!

843
01:13:01,068 --> 01:13:02,861
Sprite, get Karun out of here.

844
01:13:05,113 --> 01:13:07,991
How many cameras did you bring, young man?

845
01:13:15,832 --> 01:13:17,251
Kingo!

846
01:13:17,417 --> 01:13:18,835
Come on!

847
01:13:25,551 --> 01:13:26,760
This way!

848
01:13:26,927 --> 01:13:28,095
Quickly! Come on!

849
01:13:33,225 --> 01:13:34,977
Get in! Get in!

850
01:14:12,931 --> 01:14:13,765
Ikaris!

851
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:33,160
I've fought that one before.
It's stronger than the others.

852
01:14:36,288 --> 01:14:37,497
No.

853
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:40,876
Terrible timing, Thena.

854
01:14:41,627 --> 01:14:42,711
Thena!

855
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:52,471
Stop, Thena!

856
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:29,049
Let them go.

857
01:15:29,216 --> 01:15:30,759
Now is not the time, Sersi.

858
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:34,096
Please. I know you're better than this.

859
01:15:43,355 --> 01:15:44,481
Druig.

860
01:15:46,191 --> 01:15:48,193
Go! Get to the river!

861
01:16:05,252 --> 01:16:06,670
Gilgamesh.

862
01:16:07,337 --> 01:16:09,047
A little help here?

863
01:16:09,214 --> 01:16:10,340
Stay here.

864
01:16:11,008 --> 01:16:12,009
Say it.

865
01:16:13,427 --> 01:16:14,428
Stay here..

866
01:16:14,595 --> 01:16:16,680
Good. You're okay.

867
01:16:28,567 --> 01:16:29,902
They're headed for the camp.

868
01:16:30,068 --> 01:16:31,778
Go. They need you.

869
01:16:31,945 --> 01:16:33,363
Go, Ikaris.

870
01:16:41,371 --> 01:16:43,498
Sprite, buy me some time!

871
01:16:52,799 --> 01:16:54,593
Can you hurry up?

872
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:57,638
Now!

873
01:17:02,434 --> 01:17:03,477
Dishoom.

874
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:15,030
Karun! Did you get that?

875
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:16,949
I did, sir!

876
01:17:52,025 --> 01:17:53,777
- Kingo!
- Just go.

877
01:17:53,944 --> 01:17:55,404
I'm not leaving you.

878
01:17:55,737 --> 01:17:56,780
Sprite!

879
01:18:31,481 --> 01:18:32,482
Ikaris!

880
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:17,569
Sersi! Are you all right?

881
01:19:28,121 --> 01:19:29,831
How did you do that?

882
01:19:30,666 --> 01:19:32,417
I don't know.

883
01:19:45,556 --> 01:19:47,307
Stop, stop, stop.

884
01:19:49,226 --> 01:19:50,185
Thena.

885
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:35,355
No. Gilgamesh.

886
01:20:35,856 --> 01:20:37,149
Stay back.

887
01:20:45,407 --> 01:20:46,825
Ajak...

888
01:20:48,452 --> 01:20:49,870
Her memories...

889
01:20:51,955 --> 01:20:53,957
I understand now.

890
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:57,377
I can see what she saw.

891
01:20:58,629 --> 01:21:00,672
So many planets.

892
01:21:01,548 --> 01:21:07,054
So much life destroyed
every time a Celestial is born.

893
01:21:07,763 --> 01:21:09,640
Arishem used us...

894
01:21:09,806 --> 01:21:14,269
and left us to die with each emergence.

895
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:16,063
We just wanted to survive.

896
01:21:18,524 --> 01:21:20,651
And then he sent you.

897
01:21:21,944 --> 01:21:26,114
I will kill you all
for what you have done to my kind.

898
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:29,076
You are not saviors, Eternals.

899
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:31,286
You are murderers.

900
01:21:34,957 --> 01:21:35,874
Ikaris!

901
01:21:50,931 --> 01:21:52,307
Thena.

902
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:56,562
Hey.

903
01:21:58,522 --> 01:22:00,065
Remember.

904
01:22:08,365 --> 01:22:09,825
No.

905
01:22:11,702 --> 01:22:12,995
No.

906
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:17,916
I'll remember.

907
01:22:18,083 --> 01:22:19,626
I'll remember.

908
01:22:42,566 --> 01:22:44,735
I'll remember.

909
01:23:27,152 --> 01:23:28,737
When I left...

910
01:23:28,904 --> 01:23:34,076
I thought about taking over the minds
of every human on this planet.

911
01:23:34,952 --> 01:23:38,288
Violence, fear, greed...

912
01:23:38,455 --> 01:23:39,998
all gone.

913
01:23:40,165 --> 01:23:41,333
Why didn't you?

914
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:44,086
Because without their flaws...

915
01:23:44,628 --> 01:23:46,547
they wouldn't be human.

916
01:23:49,550 --> 01:23:52,553
Please, Druig.
You can't stay here anymore.

917
01:23:53,303 --> 01:23:56,765
These Deviants are trying to keep us
from killing their own kind.

918
01:23:56,932 --> 01:23:59,768
They have a conscience now.
That makes them more dangerous.

919
01:23:59,935 --> 01:24:01,854
No, Sersi.

920
01:24:02,938 --> 01:24:05,357
That makes them us.

921
01:24:06,066 --> 01:24:08,026
Eternals and Deviants.

922
01:24:09,236 --> 01:24:10,863
Arishem's children.

923
01:24:12,030 --> 01:24:15,784
But you are asking me to take control
of a mind of a Celestial.

924
01:24:15,951 --> 01:24:19,204
I do not have that kind of power.

925
01:24:19,371 --> 01:24:21,081
We'll need Phastos.

926
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:25,043
Well, good luck.

927
01:24:25,878 --> 01:24:28,797
He gave up on humans a long time ago.

928
01:25:01,455 --> 01:25:02,748
I did this.

929
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:07,002
If my technology
hadn't helped them advance...

930
01:25:12,424 --> 01:25:14,301
Druig was right.

931
01:25:15,177 --> 01:25:17,262
Our mission was a mistake.

932
01:25:17,888 --> 01:25:19,473
These people...

933
01:25:21,266 --> 01:25:22,517
they're not worth saving.

934
01:25:22,684 --> 01:25:24,520
Oh, Phastos.

935
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:26,146
They're not worth saving.

936
01:25:38,325 --> 01:25:40,077
- Thanks.
- Give me a good one.

937
01:25:40,244 --> 01:25:41,620
- All right.
- Over here.

938
01:25:41,787 --> 01:25:42,704
And...

939
01:25:43,372 --> 01:25:44,414
- Oh, that's great, man!
- Yeah!

940
01:25:44,581 --> 01:25:45,707
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

941
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:47,543
- Nice.
- Good one. All right, ready? Throw!

942
01:25:48,835 --> 01:25:49,670
So close.

943
01:25:49,836 --> 01:25:50,921
- Daddy, Daddy, watch this.
- Yeah, okay.

944
01:25:51,088 --> 01:25:53,048
- Watch this.
- Let me see. Let me see it.

945
01:25:54,216 --> 01:25:55,759
Dad. I'm only a starter.

946
01:25:55,926 --> 01:25:56,927
Hi.

947
01:25:57,094 --> 01:25:58,387
Hello. Can we help you?

948
01:25:58,554 --> 01:25:59,471
Throw it again.

949
01:25:59,638 --> 01:26:02,224
Hey, Jack. Ben.

950
01:26:03,433 --> 01:26:06,812
Hey, guys.
These are my friends from college.

951
01:26:09,147 --> 01:26:14,194
This is Sylvia and Isaac.
That's Isaac.

952
01:26:14,653 --> 01:26:16,697
- Isaac.
- Dad, that's Superman.

953
01:26:16,864 --> 01:26:19,283
- Dad, that's Superman!
- Jack... That's really funny, Jack.

954
01:26:19,449 --> 01:26:21,410
- No, no! He is Superman.
- That is definitely not Superman.

955
01:26:21,577 --> 01:26:25,497
I saw him on TV.
He was in London, fighting a monster.

956
01:26:26,123 --> 01:26:29,543
And you were with a cape and you were
shooting laser beams out of your eyes.

957
01:26:30,252 --> 01:26:31,253
I don't wear a cape.

958
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:32,254
Oh, sorry.

959
01:26:32,337 --> 01:26:33,672
Okay, well,
we should just go inside, right?

960
01:26:33,839 --> 01:26:36,341
Can I call you Clark? Is that what you
go by now? Because, you know...

961
01:26:36,508 --> 01:26:38,135
You've called me worse.

962
01:26:38,302 --> 01:26:39,845
You got it, Jack?

963
01:26:40,012 --> 01:26:41,096
Way to go.

964
01:26:41,263 --> 01:26:43,307
- Yes.
- All right. Show me how it's done.

965
01:26:43,682 --> 01:26:46,268
Round and round and round
and round and round.

966
01:26:49,771 --> 01:26:51,481
- Yep, you got it. Keep going.
- Come on.

967
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:03,202
Yeah. Incredibly natural, guys.

968
01:27:05,954 --> 01:27:08,040
So, after all these years...

969
01:27:08,207 --> 01:27:10,292
even you fell for Ajak's lies.

970
01:27:10,459 --> 01:27:11,960
No need to rub it in.

971
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:18,008
It all makes sense why she wouldn't let us
interfere with human conflicts.

972
01:27:18,550 --> 01:27:20,219
Conflicts lead to war...

973
01:27:20,385 --> 01:27:24,973
and war actually leads to advancement
in lifesaving technology and medicine.

974
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:27,142
So our mission was never to...

975
01:27:27,309 --> 01:27:30,062
make a peaceful or harmonious world...

976
01:27:30,229 --> 01:27:33,982
but to increase the population
at all costs.

977
01:27:34,149 --> 01:27:37,194
Just farming humans as food
for the Celestials, right?

978
01:27:37,361 --> 01:27:38,362
That's bleak.

979
01:27:38,529 --> 01:27:40,030
Well, so is telling
your husband and your child...

980
01:27:40,197 --> 01:27:41,782
that they could be dead within a few days.

981
01:27:41,949 --> 01:27:44,034
Thought you'd given up on humans.

982
01:27:44,785 --> 01:27:46,745
I got lucky. Okay?

983
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:51,041
I have a family now.

984
01:27:51,208 --> 01:27:53,544
They've given me faith again.

985
01:27:54,628 --> 01:27:58,715
And I see the good in humanity in them
every single day.

986
01:27:58,882 --> 01:28:00,509
So, look, I cannot help you.

987
01:28:00,676 --> 01:28:01,802
- I am never leaving them.
- Phastos...

988
01:28:01,969 --> 01:28:03,053
I'm sorry, Sersi.

989
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:04,596
It was wrong for me to use my powers...

990
01:28:04,763 --> 01:28:06,682
without thinking about the consequences
in the first place.

991
01:28:06,848 --> 01:28:11,603
So, now, I choose to use my hands
to fix my child's bicycle, okay?

992
01:28:12,145 --> 01:28:13,355
Do you?

993
01:28:14,398 --> 01:28:15,607
I don't use my powers anymore.

994
01:28:15,774 --> 01:28:17,109
You sure?

995
01:28:17,276 --> 01:28:18,110
What are you...

996
01:28:21,697 --> 01:28:25,033
What the hell is wrong with you?
My child is right down the hallway!

997
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,202
That looks like someone's
been using his powers.

998
01:28:27,369 --> 01:28:28,203
Oh, my God.

999
01:28:28,287 --> 01:28:29,580
I bet you've built the perfect safe house.

1000
01:28:29,746 --> 01:28:31,290
What is this even made of? Vibranium?

1001
01:28:31,456 --> 01:28:32,374
Don't!

1002
01:28:36,587 --> 01:28:38,088
Fall collection.

1003
01:28:38,255 --> 01:28:39,506
IKEA.

1004
01:28:39,673 --> 01:28:40,674
Ass.

1005
01:28:40,841 --> 01:28:43,552
How did you even deal with this guy
for over 5,000 years?

1006
01:28:43,719 --> 01:28:46,305
If you stay here, you might as well
invite the Deviants to dinner.

1007
01:28:46,471 --> 01:28:48,015
Never mind waiting
for the end of the world.

1008
01:28:48,181 --> 01:28:49,433
He has a point.

1009
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,603
No, I'm sorry. You can't just show up
in my life and expect me to go with you.

1010
01:28:52,769 --> 01:28:54,771
- I'm not gonna...
- You should go, <i>habibi.</i>

1011
01:28:55,564 --> 01:28:56,857
You want me to go?

1012
01:28:57,024 --> 01:28:59,818
You know what my mom would say to you
right now, right?

1013
01:29:04,198 --> 01:29:05,490
He's a chronic procrastinator.

1014
01:29:05,657 --> 01:29:07,618
I'm not leaving you two. No way.

1015
01:29:07,784 --> 01:29:09,578
I'm not happy about it...

1016
01:29:10,245 --> 01:29:13,498
but if there's a chance for us to watch Jack
grow up to live a life of his own...

1017
01:29:13,665 --> 01:29:15,375
we should take it.

1018
01:29:43,987 --> 01:29:48,992
<i>♪ It ended when you said goodbye ♪</i>

1019

1023
01:30:43,714 --> 01:30:45,549
The <i>Domo.</i>

1024
01:30:46,717 --> 01:30:48,218
Wow.

1025
01:30:58,061 --> 01:31:01,148
<i>A foreboding atmosphere fills the air.</i>

1026
01:31:01,982 --> 01:31:04,860
<i>An eerie stillness chokes our lungs.</i>

1027
01:31:05,027 --> 01:31:07,613
<i>What are you doing? You know you're
creeping us out. You know that, right?</i>

1028
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:10,699
<i>Oh, God! Stay calm, T, please!</i>

1029
01:31:14,494 --> 01:31:16,872
<i>Chips. It's just chips.</i>

1030
01:31:17,289 --> 01:31:21,460
<i>As you can see, being an Eternal does not
preclude you from having human emotions...</i>

1031
01:31:21,627 --> 01:31:23,420
<i>such as cowardice.</i>

1032
01:31:25,923 --> 01:31:27,507
What has she done?

1033
01:31:28,008 --> 01:31:31,345
Is that... a sarcophagus in my lab?

1034
01:31:32,638 --> 01:31:35,891
This is Makkari.
Or should I say Miss Havisham?

1035
01:31:36,058 --> 01:31:37,768
None of us have seen her for centuries.

1036
01:32:01,708 --> 01:32:02,751
Is that the Ebony Blade?

1037
01:32:02,918 --> 01:32:04,169
Excalibur.

1038
01:32:05,712 --> 01:32:07,297
Arthur always did have a crush on you.

1039
01:32:31,113 --> 01:32:32,114
DVD?

1040
01:32:32,489 --> 01:32:34,032
It's all about streaming now.

1041
01:32:34,199 --> 01:32:36,118
You know, what you need is a Kindle.

1042
01:32:36,285 --> 01:32:38,328
Do you know what that is?
It's like a...

1043
01:32:38,954 --> 01:32:41,748
You know, I just realized
that if you don't know what an iPad is...

1044
01:32:41,915 --> 01:32:44,042
there's almost no way to explain it.

1045
01:32:48,255 --> 01:32:52,593
So, how did you end up scoring
this Emerald Tablet...

1046
01:32:52,759 --> 01:32:55,679
my beautiful, beautiful Makkari?

1047
01:33:01,351 --> 01:33:02,895
I'm sorry, what are we watching?
Because this...

1048
01:33:03,061 --> 01:33:05,147
Is this new? Because I hate it.

1049
01:33:05,314 --> 01:33:08,275
Phastos, I need to control
the mind of a Celestial.

1050
01:33:13,197 --> 01:33:14,323
Bracelets?

1051
01:33:14,823 --> 01:33:15,908
You made us bracelets?

1052
01:33:16,074 --> 01:33:17,993
So, here's a little Celestial 101.

1053
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:21,830
Celestials are the most powerful
energy generators in the universe.

1054
01:33:21,997 --> 01:33:25,250
When Arishem made us,
he imbued us with infinite cosmic energy...

1055
01:33:25,459 --> 01:33:28,587
to keep our bodies regenerating.
The bracelets, in theory...

1056
01:33:28,754 --> 01:33:30,714
shut down our regeneration process.

1057
01:33:30,881 --> 01:33:33,967
And once that happens,
our bodies accumulate extra cosmic energy.

1058
01:33:34,301 --> 01:33:35,302
What for?

1059
01:33:35,469 --> 01:33:38,263
Well, if the Deviants
can absorb our energy...

1060
01:33:38,805 --> 01:33:42,100
what if we can absorb
each other's energy as well?

1061
01:33:42,267 --> 01:33:44,770
If I can find a way to connect us all...

1062
01:33:44,937 --> 01:33:46,897
one of us could become
immensely powerful...

1063
01:33:47,064 --> 01:33:49,775
pulling the accumulated energy
from the rest...

1064
01:33:49,942 --> 01:33:51,109
forming...

1065
01:33:54,696 --> 01:33:56,073
a Uni-Mind.

1066
01:33:59,826 --> 01:34:01,787
"Uni" meaning "one,"
"mind" meaning "mind."

1067
01:34:01,954 --> 01:34:02,955
Oh, no, we heard you the first time.

1068
01:34:03,121 --> 01:34:04,414
- Terrible name.
- We'll brainstorm...

1069
01:34:05,082 --> 01:34:06,083
"Brainstorm"!

1070
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:07,751
- That's a way better name!
- No, I invented it...

1071
01:34:07,918 --> 01:34:08,919
so I'm calling it whatever I want.

1072
01:34:14,883 --> 01:34:17,302
We find humans a new home
on another planet.

1073
01:34:17,469 --> 01:34:20,305
Are we building a big ship, too?
Take a pair of each animal?

1074
01:34:20,472 --> 01:34:22,849
Well, you know what's never
saved the planet? Your sarcasm.

1075
01:34:23,016 --> 01:34:24,852
Space colonization could take decades.

1076
01:34:25,018 --> 01:34:26,395
It can happen quickly with our help.

1077
01:34:26,562 --> 01:34:28,981
What if we end up
accidentally killing Tiamut?

1078
01:34:29,147 --> 01:34:31,233
We could be responsible
for billions of lives

1079
01:34:31,316 --> 01:34:32,901
not being created across the universe.

1080
01:34:33,068 --> 01:34:34,403
Boss, am I right?

1081
01:34:36,071 --> 01:34:37,823
Say something, Ikaris.

1082
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:39,658
You don't think we should be doing this.

1083
01:34:46,415 --> 01:34:48,792
Ajak chose Sersi to lead us.

1084
01:34:50,252 --> 01:34:52,129
Sersi should decide.

1085
01:34:54,756 --> 01:34:56,550
Forget who Ajak chose.

1086
01:34:56,717 --> 01:34:59,887
You're the strongest.
You should be making this decision.

1087
01:35:00,971 --> 01:35:03,265
Fine. Just keep lying to yourself.

1088
01:35:03,432 --> 01:35:04,808
Sprite.

1089
01:35:13,942 --> 01:35:15,194
Okay, this is not...

1090
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,653
- Ikaris.
- Don't run after him.

1091
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:18,822
Kingo, I... You guys.

1092
01:35:19,239 --> 01:35:21,700
Hey. Don't sweat it.
Sprite's always cranky.

1093
01:35:21,867 --> 01:35:23,744
I used to hear her complaining
even when she wasn't there.

1094
01:35:23,911 --> 01:35:25,245
I'm okay, Kingo.

1095
01:35:25,412 --> 01:35:27,122
If you think we should do this,
I trust you.

1096
01:35:27,289 --> 01:35:29,958
I will follow you to the end,
like I always have.

1097
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:33,462
What did you say?

1098
01:35:33,712 --> 01:35:36,173
I will follow you to the end,
like I always have.

1099
01:35:37,925 --> 01:35:40,802
I'm not who you think I am.

1100
01:36:19,132 --> 01:36:20,759
How long do we have?

1101
01:36:21,176 --> 01:36:22,761
Seven days.

1102
01:36:23,303 --> 01:36:24,596
Good.

1103
01:36:26,181 --> 01:36:28,183
We completed our mission.

1104
01:36:31,019 --> 01:36:32,563
Where is she?

1105
01:36:32,729 --> 01:36:33,730
London.

1106
01:36:34,565 --> 01:36:36,149
She has a good life there.

1107
01:36:36,316 --> 01:36:38,402
I'm sure she's missed you.

1108
01:36:38,569 --> 01:36:41,864
If I'd gone back to her,
I would only have told her the truth.

1109
01:36:43,699 --> 01:36:45,325
She would've suffered...

1110
01:36:45,492 --> 01:36:47,995
knowing this world she loves
would end one day.

1111
01:36:48,161 --> 01:36:49,329
Ikaris.

1112
01:36:50,372 --> 01:36:52,040
We have to tell them the truth.

1113
01:36:52,207 --> 01:36:53,625
What?

1114
01:36:54,001 --> 01:36:55,544
- Why?
- Because together...

1115
01:36:55,711 --> 01:36:57,796
we might be able to stop the emergence.

1116
01:36:58,547 --> 01:37:00,215
"Stop the emergence"?

1117
01:37:00,382 --> 01:37:01,383
Listen...

1118
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:03,385
- Ajak, I know it's hard at the end...
- Listen to me, Ikaris.

1119
01:37:03,552 --> 01:37:06,597
I have followed Arishem
for millions of years.

1120
01:37:06,763 --> 01:37:09,391
And I have never doubted him.

1121
01:37:09,558 --> 01:37:11,226
- Until now.
- Why now?

1122
01:37:12,186 --> 01:37:13,562
Why now?

1123
01:37:18,442 --> 01:37:23,071
Five years ago, Thanos erased
half of the population of the universe.

1124
01:37:24,531 --> 01:37:26,366
Delayed the emergence.

1125
01:37:28,410 --> 01:37:30,370
But the people of this planet...

1126
01:37:30,537 --> 01:37:33,790
brought everyone back
with the snap of a finger.

1127
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,128
You know, after I let you all go...

1128
01:37:38,295 --> 01:37:41,173
I traveled the world, living among them.

1129
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:44,927
I have seen them fight and lie and kill...

1130
01:37:45,219 --> 01:37:47,554
but I have also seen them...

1131
01:37:47,721 --> 01:37:50,140
laugh and love.

1132
01:37:50,307 --> 01:37:54,311
I've seen them create and dream.

1133
01:37:57,523 --> 01:37:58,899
This planet...

1134
01:37:59,566 --> 01:38:01,151
and these people...

1135
01:38:02,611 --> 01:38:04,279
have changed me.

1136
01:38:05,864 --> 01:38:09,910
The cost of Arishem's design,
it's not worth it.

1137
01:38:10,077 --> 01:38:11,703
Not this time.

1138
01:38:13,539 --> 01:38:15,249
I trust you, Ajak.

1139
01:38:19,503 --> 01:38:21,338
I'll follow you to the end...

1140
01:38:22,673 --> 01:38:24,174
as I always have.

1141
01:38:24,341 --> 01:38:25,717
Thank you.

1142
01:38:27,344 --> 01:38:29,304
We have to bring everyone back together.

1143
01:38:31,932 --> 01:38:34,268
There's something
I have to show you first.

1144
01:38:44,903 --> 01:38:46,572
It's just up ahead.

1145
01:38:54,079 --> 01:38:56,582
They must have been trapped in the ice
for centuries...

1146
01:38:56,748 --> 01:38:59,668
and broke free last week
when the glacier started to melt...

1147
01:38:59,835 --> 01:39:02,546
as the Earth's core heats up
for the emergence.

1148
01:39:03,755 --> 01:39:06,091
They killed an entire company
of oil workers.

1149
01:39:06,884 --> 01:39:08,510
I tracked them here.

1150
01:39:12,014 --> 01:39:14,349
I suspected you might have
changed your mind.

1151
01:39:15,517 --> 01:39:17,561
I can't let you betray Arishem.

1152
01:39:19,271 --> 01:39:21,356
Why don't you just kill me yourself?

1153
01:39:21,523 --> 01:39:24,526
When the others realize
something is happening to the Earth...

1154
01:39:25,194 --> 01:39:26,361
they'll come to you.

1155
01:39:27,070 --> 01:39:29,948
When they find your body,
they'll know the Deviants are back.

1156
01:39:30,365 --> 01:39:33,035
It'll keep them busy until the emergence.

1157
01:39:34,745 --> 01:39:37,080
I've been loyal to you, Ajak.

1158
01:39:37,414 --> 01:39:39,875
Kept your secret for centuries...

1159
01:39:40,209 --> 01:39:42,961
lied to everyone I cared about...

1160
01:39:43,128 --> 01:39:47,758
but never have I doubted my purpose
to serve the Celestials.

1161
01:39:48,467 --> 01:39:50,385
Oh, Ikaris.

1162
01:39:55,265 --> 01:39:58,143
I've led you down the wrong path.

1163
01:39:58,936 --> 01:40:00,354
It's the only path I know.

1164
01:42:54,111 --> 01:42:56,071
Thought I'd find you here.

1165
01:42:56,572 --> 01:42:58,991
I've thought about this place a lot.

1166
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:02,536
Amazing how things change over time.

1167
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:05,247
Maybe we're the ones who've changed.

1168
01:43:08,083 --> 01:43:09,960
I know you don't agree with our plan.

1169
01:43:11,086 --> 01:43:14,089
I've always thought of the Celestials
like the ocean.

1170
01:43:15,924 --> 01:43:19,428
They give life
and they take life away without bias.

1171
01:43:19,845 --> 01:43:22,556
If they were gone,
this universe would eventually end.

1172
01:43:23,056 --> 01:43:25,475
What you're trying to do is free humanity
from the natural order.

1173
01:43:25,642 --> 01:43:29,479
It's not natural to allow all life
on an entire planet to be destroyed.

1174
01:43:30,189 --> 01:43:31,940
Arishem's way is archaic and violent.

1175
01:43:32,107 --> 01:43:34,067
I don't want to fight, Sersi.

1176
01:43:34,860 --> 01:43:35,861
It'll all end soon.

1177
01:43:36,028 --> 01:43:38,864
Except there is no end, is there?

1178
01:43:39,114 --> 01:43:41,617
We'd carry on without our memories...

1179
01:43:41,783 --> 01:43:43,327
or free will...

1180
01:43:43,493 --> 01:43:45,078
for eternity.

1181
01:43:50,792 --> 01:43:52,169
You're afraid.

1182
01:43:52,586 --> 01:43:55,214
I wouldn't mind leaving this world.

1183
01:43:55,923 --> 01:43:57,883
I only wish that when we do...

1184
01:43:59,468 --> 01:44:01,720
I would be able to remember you.

1185
01:44:03,805 --> 01:44:06,266
I'm in love with you, Sersi.

1186
01:44:06,725 --> 01:44:09,645
I'm grateful for the life
I've lived with you.

1187
01:44:15,817 --> 01:44:16,902
Ikaris.

1188
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:43,053
Sersi?

1189
01:44:47,057 --> 01:44:48,517
It's started.

1190
01:44:51,979 --> 01:44:53,647
Oh, no. My God.

1191
01:44:54,231 --> 01:44:55,232
What about the Uni-Mind?

1192
01:44:55,691 --> 01:44:58,443
I haven't figured out a way to connect us,
but I'm close.

1193
01:44:58,610 --> 01:45:00,153
- I'm very, very close.
- How much longer?

1194
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,322
I don't know, Sersi!

1195
01:45:05,534 --> 01:45:06,869
Find the point of emergence.

1196
01:45:30,767 --> 01:45:33,353
You always knew the end was coming.

1197
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:36,148
It must be a relief.

1198
01:45:36,315 --> 01:45:38,317
That Deviant is still tracking us.

1199
01:45:39,026 --> 01:45:41,570
Revenge won't bring peace for you, Thena.

1200
01:45:42,070 --> 01:45:44,281
But killing it might.

1201
01:45:57,377 --> 01:45:58,795
Ikaris?

1202
01:46:00,214 --> 01:46:01,673
What are you doing?

1203
01:46:07,638 --> 01:46:10,265
I wanted you to leave this world in peace.

1204
01:46:11,642 --> 01:46:14,061
Without knowing about the emergence.

1205
01:46:14,436 --> 01:46:16,021
But I failed.

1206
01:46:19,858 --> 01:46:21,568
I wish Ajak hadn't chosen you.

1207
01:46:28,784 --> 01:46:30,118
I'm close to figuring it out.

1208
01:46:34,623 --> 01:46:35,916
Boss, what are you doing?

1209
01:46:36,083 --> 01:46:37,584
I've let this go on long enough.

1210
01:46:37,751 --> 01:46:38,669
Don't hurt him!

1211
01:46:40,796 --> 01:46:42,381
He lied to us.

1212
01:46:43,257 --> 01:46:45,008
He already knew about the emergence.

1213
01:46:45,717 --> 01:46:47,052
No, he didn't.

1214
01:46:47,219 --> 01:46:49,930
Ajak told me everything
when we left Babylon.

1215
01:46:51,306 --> 01:46:52,307
What?

1216
01:46:53,308 --> 01:46:55,686
You were never gonna let us
stop the emergence.

1217
01:46:55,853 --> 01:46:56,854
No.

1218
01:46:58,146 --> 01:47:00,816
I only wanted to protect you
from the Deviants.

1219
01:47:00,983 --> 01:47:04,278
If Ajak wanted you to take her place,
why did she choose me?

1220
01:47:09,408 --> 01:47:10,659
What have you done?

1221
01:47:11,994 --> 01:47:13,620
He killed her.

1222
01:47:16,373 --> 01:47:17,374
I had to.

1223
01:47:18,792 --> 01:47:20,669
She loved you.

1224
01:47:23,463 --> 01:47:25,132
- Did she?
- She loved you.

1225
01:47:27,509 --> 01:47:29,845
Do you think it was easy
to live with the truth?

1226
01:47:30,846 --> 01:47:32,848
To know that one day all this would end?

1227
01:47:34,975 --> 01:47:37,352
To keep on lying to you?

1228
01:47:38,812 --> 01:47:40,898
If we gave humanity the choice...

1229
01:47:41,064 --> 01:47:46,153
how many of them would be willing to die
so that billions more could be born?

1230
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,697
We're not giving them a choice.

1231
01:47:49,489 --> 01:47:52,826
Is this why you're willing to kill?

1232
01:47:53,827 --> 01:47:56,496
You are so pathetic!

1233
01:47:56,914 --> 01:47:59,208
I'm an Eternal, Phastos.

1234
01:47:59,833 --> 01:48:02,878
I exist for Arishem.

1235
01:48:03,045 --> 01:48:04,296
As do you.

1236
01:48:04,796 --> 01:48:05,797
It's who you are.

1237
01:48:05,964 --> 01:48:10,636
I wouldn't change a single thing
about who I am.

1238
01:48:10,802 --> 01:48:12,763
Born or made.

1239
01:48:12,930 --> 01:48:15,182
But I do not exist for Arishem...

1240
01:48:15,349 --> 01:48:17,309
I exist for my family!

1241
01:48:17,476 --> 01:48:19,937
Then you are making
the same mistake Ajak did.

1242
01:48:23,281 --> 01:48:24,491
- No!
- Makkari!

1243
01:48:26,527 --> 01:48:27,986
Get out of here!

1244
01:48:31,031 --> 01:48:32,407
Kingo.

1245
01:48:40,332 --> 01:48:42,918
You do not turn against your family.

1246
01:48:43,835 --> 01:48:46,213
Gilgamesh died because of you.

1247
01:48:48,131 --> 01:48:49,591
You won't succeed against me.

1248
01:48:50,592 --> 01:48:53,178
And I will kill every one of you
if I have to.

1249
01:49:00,936 --> 01:49:02,062
Wait.

1250
01:49:03,021 --> 01:49:04,064
I'm going with you.

1251
01:49:04,231 --> 01:49:05,274
Sprite...

1252
01:49:07,067 --> 01:49:08,110
What is this?

1253
01:49:25,627 --> 01:49:27,462
Because she loves him.

1254
01:49:29,256 --> 01:49:31,717
Oh, you guys didn't pick up on that?

1255
01:49:32,885 --> 01:49:35,053
He really fooled us, didn't he?

1256
01:49:35,929 --> 01:49:37,222
Karun, let's go.

1257
01:49:37,764 --> 01:49:38,974
Wait, where the hell are you going?

1258
01:49:39,141 --> 01:49:41,059
I can't help you guys.

1259
01:49:42,102 --> 01:49:43,729
I still think Ikaris is right.

1260
01:49:43,896 --> 01:49:46,940
So, that's it, huh? Just gonna follow him?

1261
01:49:47,733 --> 01:49:49,735
I love the people of this planet.

1262
01:49:50,194 --> 01:49:52,487
But if you stop this emergence...

1263
01:49:52,654 --> 01:49:55,032
you are preventing
so many other worlds like this one...

1264
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:56,783
from being created.

1265
01:49:57,492 --> 01:49:59,328
I still have faith in Arishem.

1266
01:49:59,786 --> 01:50:02,956
But I refuse to hurt any of you
for my beliefs.

1267
01:50:08,921 --> 01:50:11,506
Even with my help, we're no match.

1268
01:50:12,257 --> 01:50:13,926
It's Ikaris.

1269
01:50:17,304 --> 01:50:18,305
But...

1270
01:50:19,097 --> 01:50:20,974
I hope to see you on the next planet.

1271
01:50:48,627 --> 01:50:49,628
Look...

1272
01:50:50,337 --> 01:50:53,340
if I'm gonna get myself killed
going up against Ikaris...

1273
01:50:54,132 --> 01:50:56,009
we'll need to have a backup plan.

1274
01:50:56,176 --> 01:50:57,886
All of our powers,
even if they're amplified...

1275
01:50:58,053 --> 01:50:59,429
are not enough to kill a Celestial, so...

1276
01:50:59,596 --> 01:51:02,140
Well, Sersi did turn
a Deviant into a tree.

1277
01:51:03,141 --> 01:51:04,268
I'm sorry, what?

1278
01:51:04,935 --> 01:51:06,395
You didn't wanna tell me that?

1279
01:51:08,938 --> 01:51:09,957
I don't know how it happened, okay?

1280
01:51:10,023 --> 01:51:12,442
And I'm pretty sure
I couldn't do it again.

1281
01:51:12,609 --> 01:51:15,153
Well, now is the time to try,
don't you think?

1282
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:17,281
Phastos, that Deviant is dead.

1283
01:51:17,447 --> 01:51:20,659
Our plan is to put Tiamut to sleep,
not to kill it.

1284
01:51:20,826 --> 01:51:22,202
I can't kill a Celestial.

1285
01:51:22,369 --> 01:51:23,996
Sersi. Sersi.

1286
01:51:24,162 --> 01:51:25,539
We can't!

1287
01:51:31,503 --> 01:51:32,629
We can't.

1288
01:51:32,796 --> 01:51:34,339
It's okay, Sersi.

1289
01:51:35,674 --> 01:51:37,050
I got this.

1290
01:51:53,275 --> 01:51:54,902
There's no time for that.

1291
01:51:56,069 --> 01:51:58,780
I didn't see the lies
right in front of me.

1292
01:52:00,073 --> 01:52:02,951
I'm not even sure
why Ajak chose me to lead.

1293
01:52:04,494 --> 01:52:06,038
I asked Gilgamesh once...

1294
01:52:06,538 --> 01:52:08,874
why he chose to protect me.

1295
01:52:09,291 --> 01:52:10,709
He said...

1296
01:52:11,168 --> 01:52:14,504
"When you love something, you protect it.

1297
01:52:15,214 --> 01:52:19,843
"It is the most natural thing
in the world."

1298
01:52:22,512 --> 01:52:27,059
You have loved these people
since the day we arrived.

1299
01:52:28,477 --> 01:52:33,899
So, there is no one better
to lead us now than you.

1300
01:52:36,401 --> 01:52:37,694
Sersi.

1301
01:52:39,947 --> 01:52:41,281
Get up.

1302
01:52:49,206 --> 01:52:51,667
Ajak chose you for a reason.

1303
01:52:56,922 --> 01:52:57,881
Sersi!

1304
01:52:58,340 --> 01:52:59,383
Sersi!

1305
01:52:59,550 --> 01:53:01,134
Sersi. We need you!

1306
01:53:01,301 --> 01:53:02,844
I already gave that speech.

1307
01:53:03,011 --> 01:53:04,054
What?

1308
01:53:04,221 --> 01:53:05,472
You did... What...

1309
01:53:05,639 --> 01:53:08,642
Sersi, the sphere inside of you...

1310
01:53:08,809 --> 01:53:10,352
it creates a connection
between you and Arishem.

1311
01:53:10,519 --> 01:53:13,647
Maybe I can repurpose it...

1312
01:53:13,814 --> 01:53:16,066
and create a connection between...

1313
01:53:16,567 --> 01:53:17,568
well, all of us.

1314
01:53:18,026 --> 01:53:20,320
And that can activate the Uni-Mind.

1315
01:53:20,487 --> 01:53:22,155
- Great.
- Yeah.

1316
01:53:22,865 --> 01:53:24,116
But...

1317
01:53:25,158 --> 01:53:26,994
I have to take it out of you.

1318
01:53:29,913 --> 01:53:31,123
Okay.

1319
01:53:32,624 --> 01:53:33,709
Do it.

1320
01:53:35,335 --> 01:53:36,461
Okay.

1321
01:53:44,469 --> 01:53:46,054
Don't kill her.

1322
01:53:46,221 --> 01:53:47,431
Thena...

1323
01:53:48,682 --> 01:53:49,725
Do it.

1324
01:54:03,405 --> 01:54:04,698
Will it work?

1325
01:54:09,411 --> 01:54:10,829
It has to.

1326
01:55:02,631 --> 01:55:04,424
I'm glad you're here.

1327
01:55:08,637 --> 01:55:10,222
Thank you, Sprite.

1328
01:55:25,070 --> 01:55:26,738
Protect the emergence.

1329
01:55:26,905 --> 01:55:28,657
You're really gonna kill them?

1330
01:55:36,498 --> 01:55:38,041
Where's Druig?

1331
01:55:38,584 --> 01:55:39,793
He's busy.

1332
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:42,045
Thena, play nice.

1333
01:55:45,841 --> 01:55:47,259
You've never had to fight me.

1334
01:55:47,426 --> 01:55:48,552
But I've always wanted to.

1335
01:55:56,977 --> 01:55:59,188
It's time to put a god to sleep.

1336
01:57:06,630 --> 01:57:08,465
I should've done this five centuries ago.

1337
01:57:55,804 --> 01:57:57,306
Druig's gone.

1338
01:57:58,223 --> 01:57:59,600
It's over.

1339
01:59:07,125 --> 01:59:07,960
Phastos.

1340
01:59:12,381 --> 01:59:14,174
I have to try and stop this.

1341
01:59:14,341 --> 01:59:16,093
I need to get closer to Tiamut.

1342
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:18,053
- Keep Ikaris busy.
- We've got you.

1343
01:59:18,220 --> 01:59:19,221
Go.

1344
01:59:28,063 --> 01:59:28,981
Enough.

1345
01:59:59,177 --> 02:00:00,429
Thena, stop!

1346
02:00:32,544 --> 02:00:33,921
Why are you helping Ikaris?

1347
02:00:34,796 --> 02:00:36,173
We can't let it absorb our powers.

1348
02:00:37,507 --> 02:00:38,634
Too late.

1349
02:00:40,302 --> 02:00:42,930
Thena, he's trying to goad you. Don't...

1350
02:00:58,820 --> 02:00:59,821
Makkari!

1351
02:01:08,997 --> 02:01:10,207
Where's Sersi?

1352
02:01:10,582 --> 02:01:12,751
You always did underestimate her.

1353
02:01:14,211 --> 02:01:15,462
Oh, no.

1354
02:01:16,296 --> 02:01:17,923
Not so fast.

1355
02:01:22,386 --> 02:01:23,762
Boss.

1356
02:01:27,933 --> 02:01:30,811
I don't know about you,
but this is really satisfying, right?

1357
02:01:30,978 --> 02:01:33,313
Let me go, Phastos!
I can't let her do this!

1358
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:34,773
I don't think so.

1359
02:01:35,190 --> 02:01:38,652
I've been wanting to clip your wings
for a long time, Ikaris!

1360
02:01:51,957 --> 02:01:52,958
Thena.

1361
02:01:55,669 --> 02:01:58,589
Oh, you've changed.

1362
02:01:59,965 --> 02:02:01,592
You're broken.

1363
02:02:02,426 --> 02:02:03,927
Damaged.

1364
02:02:04,511 --> 02:02:06,346
Useless.

1365
02:02:08,599 --> 02:02:12,436
You can't protect any of them.

1366
02:02:26,366 --> 02:02:27,743
Sersi.

1367
02:02:32,497 --> 02:02:35,417
You're not powerful enough to do this.

1368
02:02:35,584 --> 02:02:37,502
And you won't.

1369
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:39,671
You're not a killer.

1370
02:02:39,838 --> 02:02:41,423
Maybe I've changed.

1371
02:02:41,882 --> 02:02:44,384
And is this really who you are, Sprite?

1372
02:02:44,551 --> 02:02:47,179
Are you really willing
to let everyone on this planet die?

1373
02:02:55,979 --> 02:02:57,773
I'm sorry, Sersi.

1374
02:03:10,244 --> 02:03:12,454
I've always envied you, Sersi.

1375
02:03:14,540 --> 02:03:16,583
'Cause you get to live as one of them.

1376
02:03:17,125 --> 02:03:18,210
And I never could.

1377
02:03:19,461 --> 02:03:21,713
You know why I hated living with humans?

1378
02:03:22,297 --> 02:03:25,092
Because they reminded me of
things I didn't even know I wanted.

1379
02:03:25,592 --> 02:03:28,971
Because of them, now I wanna know
what it feels like to grow up.

1380
02:03:30,097 --> 02:03:31,807
To fall in love.

1381
02:03:32,599 --> 02:03:34,226
To have a family.

1382
02:03:35,519 --> 02:03:39,189
And to know, in the end, I've lived.

1383
02:03:46,321 --> 02:03:47,447
It's all over now.

1384
02:03:48,282 --> 02:03:50,617
We get to start over somewhere new.

1385
02:03:54,538 --> 02:03:56,164
Well, that was very moving.

1386
02:03:56,331 --> 02:03:57,583
Druig.

1387
02:04:03,297 --> 02:04:04,840
I can't do this.

1388
02:04:08,510 --> 02:04:10,387
This is your fight now.

1389
02:04:54,973 --> 02:04:56,183
Thena.

1390
02:04:57,559 --> 02:04:58,810
It's me.

1391
02:04:59,394 --> 02:05:00,562
Gilgamesh.

1392
02:05:01,980 --> 02:05:03,023
Look at me.

1393
02:05:04,066 --> 02:05:05,359
Gilgamesh?

1394
02:05:05,526 --> 02:05:07,069
Stay here.

1395
02:05:09,780 --> 02:05:11,031
Say it.

1396
02:05:11,573 --> 02:05:13,242
Stay here.

1397
02:05:14,117 --> 02:05:15,827
You'll be okay.

1398
02:05:17,871 --> 02:05:19,706
Give me your hand.

1399
02:05:33,011 --> 02:05:34,221
It's a shame.

1400
02:05:36,265 --> 02:05:37,891
You and I...

1401
02:05:38,475 --> 02:05:40,394
we're just tools of a god.

1402
02:05:41,770 --> 02:05:44,982
Built to kill.

1403
02:05:47,818 --> 02:05:49,069
Thena.

1404
02:05:52,531 --> 02:05:53,907
Remember.

1405
02:06:24,396 --> 02:06:25,981
I remember.

1406
02:07:55,279 --> 02:07:56,738
Come on, Sersi.

1407
02:07:57,781 --> 02:07:58,866
Come on.

1408
02:10:08,036 --> 02:10:09,788
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1409
02:12:38,937 --> 02:12:40,480
I'm sorry.

1410
02:12:42,191 --> 02:12:43,650
I know.

1411
02:13:59,226 --> 02:14:00,269
How?

1412
02:14:00,727 --> 02:14:02,104
How did you do it?

1413
02:14:03,230 --> 02:14:06,483
When I touched Tiamut's palm,
I felt energy surging into me.

1414
02:14:06,900 --> 02:14:09,278
Tiamut joined our Uni-Mind.

1415
02:14:09,444 --> 02:14:10,779
I always wondered how we survived...

1416
02:14:10,946 --> 02:14:13,615
the destruction of other planets
that we were on.

1417
02:15:20,224 --> 02:15:21,433
Is he gone?

1418
02:15:31,109 --> 02:15:32,361
Sprite.

1419
02:15:34,863 --> 02:15:37,449
I still have energy from the Uni-Mind.

1420
02:15:38,408 --> 02:15:40,577
I think I can make you human.

1421
02:15:41,954 --> 02:15:44,873
All the things you said you wanted,
you can have them.

1422
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:47,918
But your time will be fleeting
and you'll die one day.

1423
02:15:48,085 --> 02:15:49,127
Are you ready for that?

1424
02:15:51,547 --> 02:15:52,965
I am.

1425
02:16:30,377 --> 02:16:34,089
<i>The sudden appearance of an enormous
stone figure in the Indian Ocean...</i>

1426
02:16:34,172 --> 02:16:36,967
<i>...has left more questions than answers
for authorities.</i>

1427
02:16:37,843 --> 02:16:41,345
<i>U.S. and Australian naval ships
are maintaining defensive positions...</i>

1428
02:16:41,513 --> 02:16:42,513
<i>but at this...</i>

1429
02:16:42,681 --> 02:16:44,558
You guys did that?

1430
02:16:45,350 --> 02:16:47,644
I love you so much.

1431
02:16:54,942 --> 02:16:56,320
Are you okay?

1432
02:16:57,236 --> 02:16:59,239
I get confused sometimes.

1433
02:16:59,406 --> 02:17:01,450
Yeah. Me, too.

1434
02:17:04,036 --> 02:17:06,330
So, Dad said you're the goddess Athena.

1435
02:17:06,495 --> 02:17:08,582
"Thena." Drop the "A."

1436
02:17:11,501 --> 02:17:13,336
What's your superpower?

1437
02:17:17,216 --> 02:17:19,468
Can you just... Look... One second.

1438
02:17:20,218 --> 02:17:21,844
Okay. All right.

1439
02:17:22,387 --> 02:17:24,097
See, that thing is... Okay.

1440
02:17:24,263 --> 02:17:25,766
Almost gave you a shave and a haircut,
didn't she?

1441
02:17:25,933 --> 02:17:27,392
Stand behind me, actually.

1442
02:17:27,558 --> 02:17:29,520
You remember earmuffs?
Remember how we practiced earmuffs?

1443
02:17:29,686 --> 02:17:31,396
Thank you so much.

1444
02:17:33,565 --> 02:17:36,276
You know that your babysitting privileges
are completely revoked, right?

1445
02:17:36,442 --> 02:17:37,486
Like, it's done.

1446
02:17:37,986 --> 02:17:39,862
Thank you. Violence... Hey.

1447
02:17:40,030 --> 02:17:42,866
Violence is never the answer.
Right, T?

1448
02:17:43,032 --> 02:17:45,661
You gotta always use your brain.

1449
02:17:45,826 --> 02:17:47,538
Like you did fighting on the beach?

1450
02:17:47,704 --> 02:17:48,956
Your dad...

1451
02:17:49,121 --> 02:17:51,500
spoke calmly and firmly to the bad guy...

1452
02:17:51,666 --> 02:17:53,168
and he had no choice but to listen to me,
so no violence.

1453
02:17:58,924 --> 02:18:00,800
When that's happening? 
That's happening soon, right?

1454
02:18:00,968 --> 02:18:03,804
Yes, there's Druig.
Don't go anywhere near him.

1455
02:18:04,345 --> 02:18:05,472
Yeah!

1456
02:18:07,891 --> 02:18:09,226
Okay, that's far enough, Jack.

1457
02:18:09,393 --> 02:18:11,727
Wow, Dad, the <i>Domo</i>'s so cool.

1458
02:18:11,895 --> 02:18:13,522
Your dad fixed that with his bare hands.

1459
02:18:13,689 --> 02:18:15,273
Can we go to space, too, one day?

1460
02:18:15,440 --> 02:18:17,942
Let's wait till you get
your learner's permit, okay?

1461
02:18:18,818 --> 02:18:20,236
Hey, Phastos.

1462
02:18:21,071 --> 02:18:22,447
Take care.

1463
02:18:22,823 --> 02:18:24,407
This world is lucky to have you.

1464
02:18:25,242 --> 02:18:26,869
Thank you.

1465
02:18:27,035 --> 02:18:28,704
I know you're not a hugger, so...

1466
02:18:31,874 --> 02:18:32,958
Okay.

1467
02:18:35,919 --> 02:18:40,007
You think when we find
the other Eternals out there...

1468
02:18:40,173 --> 02:18:43,175
that they'll accept the truth
the way we did?

1469
02:19:01,068 --> 02:19:02,779
Told you that thing was addictive.

1470
02:19:03,947 --> 02:19:04,990
Please visit?

1471
02:19:05,616 --> 02:19:06,825
I'll try.

1472
02:19:07,409 --> 02:19:08,744
When I get time off from school.

1473
02:19:08,911 --> 02:19:11,580
Oh, wow. Listen, it's gonna be good for you
to be in a human environment.

1474
02:19:11,746 --> 02:19:13,540
You'll pick up some social skills.

1475
02:19:14,082 --> 02:19:15,459
Oh, you didn't think you needed those?

1476
02:19:16,834 --> 02:19:18,836
That explains so much.

1477
02:19:28,555 --> 02:19:30,098
Gonna miss you.

1478
02:19:30,641 --> 02:19:31,850
Me, too.

1479
02:19:35,521 --> 02:19:36,647
Madam.

1480
02:19:37,105 --> 02:19:38,397
Thanks, Karun.

1481
02:19:38,982 --> 02:19:41,442
Sometimes I wonder
if we did the right thing.

1482
02:19:43,070 --> 02:19:44,154
Killing Tiamut.

1483
02:19:44,321 --> 02:19:46,073
It's too late for that.

1484
02:19:46,240 --> 02:19:48,200
But you followed your heart.

1485
02:19:48,367 --> 02:19:49,826
We all did.

1486
02:19:52,037 --> 02:19:53,038
Even Ikaris.

1487
02:20:00,629 --> 02:20:02,589
Looks like someone's waiting for you.

1488
02:20:03,757 --> 02:20:05,884
He's a lot cuter in person.

1489
02:20:08,303 --> 02:20:11,515
So, after all that,
you still can't change me into a giraffe?

1490
02:20:12,182 --> 02:20:15,853
Well, I could next time
I'm connected to a Celestial...

1491
02:20:16,019 --> 02:20:18,230
during an emergence
whilst performing a Uni-Mind.

1492
02:20:18,397 --> 02:20:21,191
Yeah. That sounds like a "no" to me.

1493
02:20:25,153 --> 02:20:26,572
What'll you do now?

1494
02:20:26,738 --> 02:20:28,031
Not sure.

1495
02:20:28,198 --> 02:20:30,200
This planet's my home, but...

1496
02:20:31,952 --> 02:20:34,663
I can't pretend to be human anymore.

1497
02:20:41,253 --> 02:20:42,838
I love you, Sersi.

1498
02:20:44,381 --> 02:20:45,465
I don't care what you are.

1499
02:20:59,271 --> 02:21:01,899
Remember when we talked about
no more secrets?

1500
02:21:02,065 --> 02:21:05,068
I have no more secrets, I promise.

1501
02:21:05,235 --> 02:21:06,737
Actually...

1502
02:21:06,904 --> 02:21:09,198
I have one I want to tell you.

1503
02:21:10,282 --> 02:21:11,825
What is it?

1504
02:21:13,785 --> 02:21:16,288
It turns out my family history is...

1505
02:21:17,206 --> 02:21:18,790
complicated.

1506
02:21:22,211 --> 02:21:23,587
Sersi?

1507
02:21:24,379 --> 02:21:25,881
Sersi, what's wrong?

1508
02:21:27,341 --> 02:21:28,675
Sersi?

1509
02:21:52,491 --> 02:21:53,867
Sersi?

1510
02:21:54,743 --> 02:21:55,994
Sersi?

1511
02:21:56,870 --> 02:21:59,039
Sersi!

1512
02:22:13,845 --> 02:22:17,224
You have chosen
to sacrifice a Celestial...

1513
02:22:17,599 --> 02:22:20,018
for the people of this planet.

1514
02:22:21,311 --> 02:22:23,105
I will spare them...

1515
02:22:23,272 --> 02:22:27,985
but your memories will show
if they're worthy to live.

1516
02:22:29,486 --> 02:22:33,699
And I will return for judgment.

1517
02:22:49,089 --> 02:22:51,133
You all right, Ted?

1518
02:22:52,843 --> 02:22:54,720
Did you see that?

1519
02:26:04,326 --> 02:26:05,661
Arishem.

1520
02:26:07,913 --> 02:26:09,623
We have to go back.

1521
02:26:22,594 --> 02:26:23,929
What?

1522
02:26:36,817 --> 02:26:37,901
Wow.

1523
02:26:38,777 --> 02:26:41,405
My ears. My eyes are numb.

1524
02:26:41,572 --> 02:26:44,408
No more drunk teleporting for you.

1525
02:26:45,742 --> 02:26:46,910
Hang on, hang on.

1526
02:26:52,791 --> 02:26:54,251
Behold...

1527
02:26:54,918 --> 02:26:57,504
the royal prince of Titan...

1528
02:26:57,671 --> 02:27:00,883
brother of Thanos,
the Knave of Hearts...

1529
02:27:01,049 --> 02:27:02,134
defeater...

1530
02:27:03,468 --> 02:27:05,429
- ...of Black Robert...
- Roger.

1531
02:27:07,347 --> 02:27:09,808
Defeater of Black Roger.

1532
02:27:10,434 --> 02:27:11,727
The great adventurer...

1533
02:27:12,269 --> 02:27:16,190
Starfox of Mystery Planet.

1534
02:27:16,773 --> 02:27:18,984
What a pleasure
to make your acquaintance...

1535
02:27:19,526 --> 02:27:21,403
my fellow Eternals.

1536
02:27:22,446 --> 02:27:24,781
You know, you really don't have to
do the whole thing every time.

1537
02:27:24,948 --> 02:27:26,158
Everything you do is impressive.

1538
02:27:26,325 --> 02:27:27,825
- What am I gonna leave off the list?
- No, I know it's impressive.

1539
02:27:27,906 --> 02:27:28,847
Who are you?

1540
02:27:30,829 --> 02:27:31,955
I'm Eros.

1541
02:27:32,456 --> 02:27:33,498
This is Pip.

1542
02:27:33,916 --> 02:27:37,127
And you are as beautiful
as legends say, Thena.

1543
02:27:37,294 --> 02:27:38,587
What do you want, lads?

1544
02:27:38,754 --> 02:27:40,422
Pip and I are here to help, aren't we?

1545
02:27:45,886 --> 02:27:47,971
Your friends are in big trouble.

1546
02:27:49,640 --> 02:27:51,725
And we know where to find them.

1547
02:34:43,136 --> 02:34:44,596
You can do this.

1548
02:34:45,847 --> 02:34:47,683
You can do this.

1549
02:35:11,957 --> 02:35:13,458
I'm sorry.

1550
02:35:15,669 --> 02:35:17,296
I have to try.

1551
02:35:31,393 --> 02:35:33,979
Sure you're ready
for that, Mr. Whitman?
