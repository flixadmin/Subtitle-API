1
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,824
<i>In the decade of the 1930s</i>
<i>even the great city of Metropolis...</i>

2
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:48,990
<i>... was not spared the ravages</i>
<i>of the world-wide depression.</i>

3
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:51,064
<i>In the times of fear and confusion...</i>

4
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:55,201
<i>... the job of informing the public</i>
<i>was the responsibility...</i>

5
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,704
...of the Daily Planet.

6
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,036
<i>A great metropolitan newspaper...</i>

7
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:04,238
<i>... whose reputation for clarity and truth</i>
<i>had become a symbol of hope...</i>

8
00:01:04,414 --> 00:01:06,348
<i>... for the city of Metropolis.</i>

9
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,011
This is no fantasy.

10
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:47,281
No careless product
of wild imagination.

11
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,958
No, my good friends...

12
00:06:51,961 --> 00:06:53,690
...these indictments...

13
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:57,365
...I've brought you today...

14
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:02,394
...specific charges listed here in
against the individuals...

15
00:07:03,372 --> 00:07:07,274
...their acts of treason.
Their ultimate aim of sedition.

16
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,538
These...

17
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,578
...are matters of undeniable fact.

18
00:07:19,222 --> 00:07:23,022
I ask you now
to pronounce judgment...

19
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:25,854
...on those accused.

20
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:34,830
On this...

21
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:37,602
...this mindless aberration...

22
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:41,903
...whose only means of expression
are wanton violence and destruction.

23
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:46,645
On the woman Ursa...

24
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:50,279
...whose perversions
and unreasoning hatred of all mankind...

25
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,254
...have threatened even the children
of the Planet Krypton.

26
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:04,990
Finally, General Zod.

27
00:08:06,602 --> 00:08:08,467
Once trusted by this Council...

28
00:08:08,804 --> 00:08:12,399
...charged with maintaining the defense
of the Planet Krypton itself.

29
00:08:12,808 --> 00:08:17,006
Chief Architect of this intended revolution
and author of this insidious plot...

30
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,280
...to establish a new order amongst us...

31
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:24,481
...with himself as absolute ruler.

32
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,885
You have heard the evidence.

33
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,826
The decision of the Council
will now be heard.

34
00:08:35,298 --> 00:08:36,925
<i>Guilty!</i>

35
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:39,501
<i>Guilty!</i>

36
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:44,802
The vote must be unanimous, Jor-El.

37
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,137
It has therefore now become
your decision.

38
00:08:48,744 --> 00:08:50,735
You alone will condemn us
if you wish...

39
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,674
...and you alone will be held
responsible by me!

40
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:08,797
You have been known to disagree
with the Council before.

41
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:13,658
Yours could become an important voice
in the new order, second only to my own!

42
00:09:14,937 --> 00:09:17,963
I offer you a chance
for greatness, Jor-El!

43
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:20,334
Take it! Join us!

44
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:24,441
You will bow down before me,
Jor-El.

45
00:09:24,914 --> 00:09:28,042
I swear it!
No matter that it takes an eternity!

46
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:30,985
You will bow down before me!

47
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:33,920
Both you and then one day...

48
00:09:34,023 --> 00:09:35,285
...your heirs!

49
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:09,240
<i>Forgive me, forgive me...</i>

50
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:31,032
An unpleasant duty
has been masterly performed, Jor-El.

51
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:34,203
They have received
the fate they deserved.

52
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:37,278
Isolation in the Phantom Zone...

53
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:39,506
...an eternal living death.

54
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:43,679
A chance for life, nonetheless.

55
00:11:44,754 --> 00:11:45,846
As opposed to us.

56
00:11:47,523 --> 00:11:48,751
It's suicide.

57
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:52,086
No, it's worse, it's genocide.

58
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:54,159
Be warned, Jor-El.

59
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:58,633
The Council has already evaluated
this outlandish theory of yours.

60
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:03,330
My friends, you know me
to be neither rash nor impulsive.

61
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:08,575
I am not given
to wild unsupported statements...

62
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,940
...and I tell you that we must evacuate
this planet immediately.

63
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:17,251
Jor-El, you are one
of Krypton's greatest scientists.

64
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,215
Yes, but so is Vond-Ah.

65
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:26,117
I don't question your data.

66
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:28,252
The facts are undeniable.

67
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:34,566
It's your conclusions
we find unsupportable.

68
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,608
This planet will explode within 30 days.

69
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,942
If not sooner.

70
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,245
I tell you Krypton
is simply shifting its orbit.

71
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,348
...be reasonable.

72
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,446
My friend...

73
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:58,385
...I have never been otherwise.
This madness is yours.

74
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:00,422
This discussion is terminated.

75
00:13:02,164 --> 00:13:04,564
The decision of the Council is final.

76
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:26,311
Any attempt by you to create...

77
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,154
...a climate of fear and panic
among the populace...

78
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:34,023
...must be deemed by us
an act of insurrection.

79
00:13:34,797 --> 00:13:36,788
You would accuse me of insurrection?

80
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,568
Has it now become a crime
to cherish life?

81
00:13:41,937 --> 00:13:44,804
You would be banished
to endless imprisonment...

82
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:46,838
...in the Phantom Zone:

83
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:48,776
The eternal void...

84
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,903
...which you, yourself discovered.

85
00:13:53,716 --> 00:13:57,447
Will you abide by the Council's decision?

86
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:04,515
I will remain silent.

87
00:14:06,128 --> 00:14:07,686
Neither I...

88
00:14:08,497 --> 00:14:11,022
...nor my wife, will leave Krypton.

89
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:08,314
Have you finished?

90
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,892
It's the only answer, Lara.

91
00:15:20,102 --> 00:15:21,831
If he remains here with us...

92
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,330
...he will die as surely as we will.

93
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:26,839
But why Earth, Jor-El?

94
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:29,676
They're primitives,
thousands of years behind us.

95
00:15:30,112 --> 00:15:32,376
He will need that advantage to survive.

96
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,477
Their atmosphere will...

97
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,343
...sustain him.

98
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:49,326
He will defy their gravity.

99
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:51,430
He will look like one of them.

100
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:54,332
He won't be one of them.

101
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:59,902
His dense molecular structure
will make him strong.

102
00:16:01,777 --> 00:16:04,211
He'll be odd. Different.

103
00:16:06,415 --> 00:16:09,475
He'll be fast.
Virtually invulnerable.

104
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:13,782
Isolated. Alone.

105
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:19,424
He will not be alone.

106
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:27,362
He will never be alone.

107
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,113
The energy input to Jor-El's quarters
is now in excess.

108
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:43,510
Our data indicates the loss
is due to a misuse of energy.

109
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,580
Investigate.

110
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,391
And if the investigation proves correct?

111
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:53,686
He knew the penalty he faced.

112
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,264
He even is a member of this Council.

113
00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:01,602
The law will be upheld.

114
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:46,946
You will travel far, my little Kal-El.

115
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:50,975
But we will never leave you.

116
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:54,316
Even in the face of our death...

117
00:17:55,758 --> 00:17:57,589
...the richness of our lives...

118
00:17:59,528 --> 00:18:00,927
...shall be yours.

119
00:18:02,297 --> 00:18:05,664
All that I have, all that I've learned,
everything I feel...

120
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:08,760
...all this and more, I...

121
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,868
...I bequeath you, my son.

122
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,475
You will carry me inside you...

123
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,748
...all the days of your life.

124
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:25,653
You will make my strength your own...

125
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,013
...see my life through your eyes...

126
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:32,090
...as your life will be seen through mine.

127
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,824
The son becomes the father,
and the father...

128
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:40,231
...the son.

129
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:45,403
This is all I...

130
00:18:48,477 --> 00:18:52,174
...all I can send you, Kal-El.

131
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:14,066
<i>... which Einstein called his theory</i>
<i>of relativity.</i>

132
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:16,977
<i>Embedded in the crystals before you...</i>

133
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:20,743
<i>... is the total accumulation of all literature</i>
<i>and scientific fact...</i>

134
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:22,847
<i>... from dozens of other worlds...</i>

135
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,214
<i>... spanning the 28 known galaxies.</i>

136
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:49,943
<i>Early Chinese writings point out</i>
<i>the complex relationship between...</i>

137
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:56,580
<i>By carrying this complex equation</i>
<i>to its ultimate power, my son...</i>

138
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,286
<i>Chief among these powers</i>
<i>will be your sight...</i>

139
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:05,518
<i>... your strength, your hearing...</i>

140
00:24:05,827 --> 00:24:09,058
<i>... your ability to propel yourself</i>
<i>at almost limitless speed.</i>

141
00:24:10,632 --> 00:24:15,069
<i>The early history of our universe was</i>
<i>a bloody mosaic of interplanetary war.</i>

142
00:24:15,737 --> 00:24:18,297
<i>Each of the six galaxies</i>
<i>which you will pass through...</i>

143
00:24:18,673 --> 00:24:21,369
<i>... contain their own individual law</i>
<i>of space and time.</i>

144
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,741
<i>It is forbidden for you to interfere</i>
<i>with human history.</i>

145
00:24:58,146 --> 00:24:59,579
- What!
- What was that?

146
00:25:24,372 --> 00:25:26,897
Now wouldn't that beat all get out.
Well, you...

147
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:37,941
Oh, Pa!

148
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:15,580
All these years, as happy as we've been...

149
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,251
...how I've prayed the good Lord
would see fit to give us a child.

150
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,995
Honey, will you hand me
that rag up there.

151
00:26:24,432 --> 00:26:25,899
You take things easy now.

152
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,595
Remember what Doc Frye said
about that heart of yours.

153
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:37,807
Now the first thing we've got to do
when we get home is find out...

154
00:26:38,613 --> 00:26:40,444
...who that boy's proper family is.

155
00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:44,217
He hasn't got any.
Not around here, anyway.

156
00:26:48,723 --> 00:26:51,089
Are you thinking
what I think you are thinking?

157
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:55,989
We could say he's the child of my cousin
in North Dakota...

158
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:58,265
...and just now orphaned.

159
00:27:00,935 --> 00:27:02,960
Jonathan, he's only a baby.

160
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:06,799
Martha, now you saw
how we found him.

161
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:13,009
Martha Clark Kent,
are you listening to what I'm saying?

162
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:47,405
Come on, gang.

163
00:27:50,885 --> 00:27:52,716
That was a great game.

164
00:27:53,988 --> 00:27:54,955
All right.

165
00:27:57,192 --> 00:27:59,922
Come on, hustle. Let's go.
Stack your helmets neatly.

166
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,655
Remember about those uniforms,
cleaned and washed by tomorrow...

167
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,630
...and looking like a football team.

168
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,199
Clark, let's have those clothes washed
and ready for tomorrow’s game.

169
00:28:09,304 --> 00:28:10,896
Got to beat Mount Vernon High.

170
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,770
Can you give me a lift?

171
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:24,381
Don't bother with these.
I'll take them in with the other equipment.

172
00:28:25,754 --> 00:28:27,915
- Thank you, Clark.
- Sure.

173
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:32,025
Listen, a whole bunch of us are going up
to Mary Ellen's.

174
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,525
Play some records.
Would you like to come?

175
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,601
Sounds like it could be a lot of fun.

176
00:28:41,002 --> 00:28:43,232
Kent can't make it.
Still got a lot of work to do.

177
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:46,734
What are you talking about?
I’ve just finished stacking...

178
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:47,907
All that?

179
00:28:48,943 --> 00:28:50,035
Oh, Brad!

180
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:52,645
Hey, come on, Lana.

181
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:55,881
Let's go.

182
00:28:57,452 --> 00:28:58,851
- He has to clean up.
- 'Bye, Clark.

183
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,111
- 'Bye, Lana.
- Clean this up, Clark.

184
00:29:03,892 --> 00:29:04,950
'Bye, Clark.

185
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,292
'Bye, Clark.

186
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,935
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

187
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,673
Mommy, I saw a boy out there
run as fast as the train!

188
00:30:28,877 --> 00:30:30,242
Faster even!

189
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:34,606
Lois Lane, you have
a writer's gift for invention.

190
00:30:34,716 --> 00:30:36,684
- I'll say that for you.
- But

191
00:30:37,018 --> 00:30:39,145
Lois, please read your book.

192
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,620
No one ever believes me.

193
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:15,586
Hey, look, there's Clark!

194
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:19,560
Clark?

195
00:31:20,662 --> 00:31:22,220
How did you get here so fast?

196
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:24,296
I ran.

197
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,793
Ran, huh?

198
00:31:26,034 --> 00:31:28,969
Told you he was an oddball.
Let's get out of here.

199
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,203
Been showing off a bit, haven't you, Son?

200
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:52,988
I didn't mean to show off, Pa.

201
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:00,427
It’s just that guys like that Brad,
I just want to tear them apart.

202
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:01,524
Yeah, I know.

203
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,003
Yeah, I know I shouldn't.

204
00:32:04,138 --> 00:32:06,902
Yeah, I know you can do
all these amazing things...

205
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:09,771
...and sometimes you think
that you will just go bust...

206
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:11,845
...unless you can tell people about it.

207
00:32:11,946 --> 00:32:13,174
- Yeah.
- That's right.

208
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:16,249
I mean, every time I get the football
I can make a touchdown.

209
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,079
- That's for sure.
- Every time.

210
00:32:18,453 --> 00:32:21,945
Is it showing off when somebody's doing
the things he's capable of doing?

211
00:32:22,156 --> 00:32:24,056
Is a bird showing off when it flies?

212
00:32:24,258 --> 00:32:26,852
No, no. Now, you listen to me.

213
00:32:27,629 --> 00:32:31,395
When you came to us, we thought
people would take you away...

214
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,432
...when they found out
the things that you do.

215
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,499
It worried us a lot.

216
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,901
Then when a man gets older
he thinks very differently.

217
00:32:40,508 --> 00:32:41,941
And things get very clear.

218
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:47,409
And there's one thing I do know, Son,
and that is you are here for a reason.

219
00:32:48,182 --> 00:32:50,810
I don't know whose reason,
or whatever the reason is...

220
00:32:50,918 --> 00:32:52,442
...maybe it's because...

221
00:32:56,624 --> 00:32:57,716
I don't know.

222
00:33:00,094 --> 00:33:03,655
But I do know one thing.
It's not to score touchdowns.

223
00:33:07,201 --> 00:33:08,259
Thanks, Dad.

224
00:33:09,971 --> 00:33:11,632
I'll race you to it. Yeah.

225
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:12,837
You will?

226
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,175
Come on, Papa. Run. Come on. Move.

227
00:33:15,443 --> 00:33:18,139
Go, go. Come on. Hey, Baron.

228
00:33:49,677 --> 00:33:51,110
Jonathan!

229
00:33:57,485 --> 00:33:58,452
Dad.

230
00:34:49,604 --> 00:34:51,572
All those things I can do...

231
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:55,441
...all those powers...

232
00:34:57,879 --> 00:34:59,847
...and I couldn't even save him.

233
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,794
Clark, get up.

234
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,063
Good morning, Smiley.

235
00:38:09,437 --> 00:38:11,496
Clark, breakfast.

236
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,503
Are you going to sleep all day?

237
00:38:19,347 --> 00:38:21,577
Clark, come on. Get up.

238
00:39:22,743 --> 00:39:23,903
I have to leave.

239
00:39:30,351 --> 00:39:32,376
I knew this time would come.

240
00:39:33,654 --> 00:39:36,350
We both knew it
from the day we found you.

241
00:39:48,335 --> 00:39:50,326
I talked to Ben Hubbard yesterday.

242
00:39:52,373 --> 00:39:56,503
He said that he'd be happy
to help out from now on.

243
00:40:05,586 --> 00:40:06,575
Mother!

244
00:40:08,355 --> 00:40:09,413
I know, Son.

245
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:13,026
I know.

246
00:40:17,431 --> 00:40:20,127
Do you know where you're headed?

247
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:25,739
North.

248
00:40:31,712 --> 00:40:32,940
Remember us, Son.

249
00:40:35,382 --> 00:40:36,781
Always remember us.

250
00:46:13,787 --> 00:46:14,879
<i>My son...</i>

251
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,891
<i>... you do not remember me.</i>

252
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,624
<i>I am Jor-El.</i>

253
00:46:28,435 --> 00:46:29,697
<i>I am your father.</i>

254
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:34,833
<i>By now you will have reached</i>
<i>your eighteenth year...</i>

255
00:46:35,609 --> 00:46:37,167
<i>... as it is measured on Earth.</i>

256
00:46:38,445 --> 00:46:39,878
<i>By that reckoning...</i>

257
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:44,040
<i>... I will have been dead</i>
<i>for many thousands of your years.</i>

258
00:46:46,653 --> 00:46:47,847
<i>The knowledge...</i>

259
00:46:49,156 --> 00:46:52,284
<i>... that I have of matters,</i>
<i>physical and historical...</i>

260
00:46:52,826 --> 00:46:55,989
<i>... I have given you fully on your voyage</i>
<i>to your new home.</i>

261
00:46:57,264 --> 00:46:59,391
<i>These are important matters to be sure...</i>

262
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,461
<i>... but still matters of mere fact.</i>

263
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,035
<i>There are questions to be asked...</i>

264
00:47:07,207 --> 00:47:09,767
<i>... and it is time for you to do so.</i>

265
00:47:12,813 --> 00:47:13,973
<i>Here, in this...</i>

266
00:47:15,482 --> 00:47:17,916
<i>... this fortress of solitude...</i>

267
00:47:19,686 --> 00:47:21,916
<i>... we shall try to find</i>
<i>the answers together.</i>

268
00:47:24,057 --> 00:47:25,183
<i>So, my son...</i>

269
00:47:31,698 --> 00:47:32,960
<i>Your name is Kal-El.</i>

270
00:47:34,668 --> 00:47:37,728
<i>You are the only survivor</i>
<i>of the Planet Krypton.</i>

271
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:42,675
<i>Even though you were raised</i>
<i>as a human, you are not one of them.</i>

272
00:47:44,011 --> 00:47:47,708
<i>You have great powers,</i>
<i>only some of which you have...</i>

273
00:47:48,382 --> 00:47:49,747
<i>... as yet discovered.</i>

274
00:47:52,753 --> 00:47:54,311
<i>Come with me now, my son...</i>

275
00:47:54,421 --> 00:47:57,356
<i>... as we break through the bars</i>
<i>of your earthly confinement.</i>

276
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:59,550
<i>Traveling through time and space.</i>

277
00:48:01,194 --> 00:48:04,891
<i>Your powers will far exceed</i>
<i>those of mortal men.</i>

278
00:48:04,998 --> 00:48:07,728
<i>It is forbidden for you to interfere</i>
<i>with human history.</i>

279
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:11,029
<i>Rather let your leadership stir others to.</i>

280
00:48:13,006 --> 00:48:16,908
<i>In the next year,</i>
<i>we shall examine the human heart.</i>

281
00:48:18,011 --> 00:48:20,002
<i>It is more fragile than your own.</i>

282
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:26,252
<i>As we pass through the flaming turmoil</i>
<i>which is the edge of your own galaxy...</i>

283
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,478
<i>... we will enter the realm</i>
<i>of the red Krypton sun...</i>

284
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:31,888
<i>... source of your strength</i>
<i>and nourishment...</i>

285
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:34,491
<i>... and cause of our eventual destruction.</i>

286
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,464
<i>The Planet Krypton, my son...</i>

287
00:48:39,366 --> 00:48:41,527
<i>... your home as it was.</i>

288
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:47,436
<i>This year we shall examine</i>
<i>the various concepts of immortality...</i>

289
00:48:47,941 --> 00:48:49,875
<i>... and their basis in actual fact.</i>

290
00:48:51,078 --> 00:48:55,174
<i>The total accumulation of all knowledge</i>
<i>spanning the 28 known galaxies...</i>

291
00:48:55,716 --> 00:48:58,844
<i>... is embedded in the crystals</i>
<i>which I have sent along with you.</i>

292
00:48:59,286 --> 00:49:00,878
<i>Study them well, my son.</i>

293
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:07,584
<i>By the time you return to the confines</i>
<i>of your galaxy...</i>

294
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:10,256
<i>... twelve of your years will have passed.</i>

295
00:49:10,931 --> 00:49:12,660
<i>For this reason, among others...</i>

296
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:15,768
<i>... I have chosen Earth for you.</i>

297
00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:18,833
<i>It is now time for you to rejoin</i>
<i>your new world...</i>

298
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:22,004
<i>... and to serve its collective humanity.</i>

299
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,477
<i>Live as one of them, Kal-El...</i>

300
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,315
<i>... and discover where your strength</i>
<i>and your power are needed.</i>

301
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:34,446
<i>But always hold in your heart the pride</i>
<i>of your special heritage.</i>

302
00:49:35,856 --> 00:49:38,518
<i>They can be a great people, Kal-El,</i>
<i>they wish to be.</i>

303
00:49:39,626 --> 00:49:41,890
<i>They only lack the light to show the way.</i>

304
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:46,991
<i>For this reason, above all,</i>
<i>their capacity for good...</i>

305
00:49:48,535 --> 00:49:50,002
<i>... I have sent them you...</i>

306
00:49:52,372 --> 00:49:53,430
<i>... my only son.</i>

307
00:50:29,843 --> 00:50:32,403
Okay, this is it, the Daily Planet.

308
00:50:33,013 --> 00:50:36,779
Fresh fruit!
Hey, how about a tomato, lady?

309
00:50:37,417 --> 00:50:39,544
Hey, fresh fruit and vegetables.

310
00:51:12,018 --> 00:51:12,916
Smile.

311
00:51:15,455 --> 00:51:17,184
How many "T's" in "bloodletting"?

312
00:51:24,698 --> 00:51:25,995
What are you writing?

313
00:51:26,133 --> 00:51:28,363
An ode to spring.
How do you spell "massacre"?

314
00:51:29,436 --> 00:51:33,839
M-a-s-s-a-c-r-e.

315
00:51:34,574 --> 00:51:35,541
Thanks.

316
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,310
Golly, how come you get
all the great stories?

317
00:51:38,445 --> 00:51:40,538
A good reporter doesn't get great stories.

318
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,113
A good reporter makes them great.

319
00:51:42,215 --> 00:51:44,274
Chief, here's that story on the murder case.

320
00:51:44,384 --> 00:51:47,683
The way I see it, it's a headline
on the front page with my picture...

321
00:51:47,788 --> 00:51:51,315
There's only one "P" in "rapist."
Lois Lane, say hello to Clark Kent.

322
00:51:51,792 --> 00:51:53,259
Hello, Miss Lane, how are...

323
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:59,824
How are you doing?
Jimmy Olsen, photographer.

324
00:51:59,933 --> 00:52:01,730
Hi. Clark Kent. Nice to meet you.

325
00:52:03,336 --> 00:52:05,896
It's got everything:
Sex, violence, the ethnic angle.

326
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:08,572
So does a lady wrestler
with a foreign accent.

327
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,801
- Kent, can you open this?
- Sure, Mr. White.

328
00:52:10,944 --> 00:52:13,174
This could be the basis
for a series of articles:

329
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,010
"Making Sense of Senseless Killings"
by Lois Lane.

330
00:52:16,349 --> 00:52:18,874
We get psychologists,
sociologists, interviews"..."

331
00:52:18,985 --> 00:52:22,421
Lois, you're pushing a bunch
of rinky-dink tabloid garbage.

332
00:52:22,789 --> 00:52:24,780
The "Daily Planet" has a tradition...

333
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,324
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

334
00:52:26,793 --> 00:52:29,227
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to shake it up like that.

335
00:52:29,863 --> 00:52:31,125
Of course not, Lois.

336
00:52:31,765 --> 00:52:34,859
Why would any one want to make
a total stranger look like a fool?

337
00:52:37,137 --> 00:52:38,161
I'll take that.

338
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,102
Thanks. I'm sorry, Mr. White.

339
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,732
Why do I pay you $40 a week when
I should have you arrested for loitering?

340
00:52:43,877 --> 00:52:45,344
- Go get Mr... a towel.
- Kent.

341
00:52:45,478 --> 00:52:46,911
- Move, kid, move.
- Right, Chief.

342
00:52:47,047 --> 00:52:49,038
- Make mine black, no sugar.
- Right, Chief.

343
00:52:49,182 --> 00:52:50,615
And don't call me sugar.

344
00:52:51,985 --> 00:52:53,680
Right... Sugar.

345
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,548
Chief wants coffee, no sugar.
I'll take tea with lemon.

346
00:52:57,791 --> 00:53:01,090
Lois, why don't you take Kent out
to meet everybody, huh?

347
00:53:01,194 --> 00:53:04,061
Just introduce him around.
He's starting on the paper today.

348
00:53:04,297 --> 00:53:05,855
I'm giving him the City beat.

349
00:53:08,201 --> 00:53:09,634
That's my beat!

350
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:13,665
Lois, Clark Kent may seem like
just a mild-mannered reporter...

351
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,876
...but not only does he know how to treat
his Chief with the proper respect...

352
00:53:18,011 --> 00:53:20,707
...not only does he have a snappy,
punchy prose style...

353
00:53:20,814 --> 00:53:24,773
...but he is, in my 40 years in this business,
the fastest typist I have ever seen.

354
00:53:24,885 --> 00:53:25,852
That's great.

355
00:53:26,653 --> 00:53:28,348
Here, you forgot my article.

356
00:53:32,092 --> 00:53:34,322
Excuse me, Mr. White. I was wondering...

357
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,827
...if you could arrange for half my salary...

358
00:53:37,063 --> 00:53:39,429
...to be sent to this address
on a weekly basis.

359
00:53:41,735 --> 00:53:42,702
Don't tell me!

360
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:45,703
He sends a check every week
to his sweet, gray-haired mother.

361
00:53:45,872 --> 00:53:47,499
Actually, she's silver-haired.

362
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,242
I'll see what I can do.

363
00:53:52,012 --> 00:53:53,775
Thank you very much, Mr. White.

364
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,420
Any more at home like you?

365
00:54:03,256 --> 00:54:04,348
Not really, no.

366
00:54:07,527 --> 00:54:08,789
I didn't think so.

367
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:12,694
Well, get yourself a desk over here.

368
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,467
Over here?

369
00:54:14,567 --> 00:54:17,297
Here, there's some paper
and a file right there.

370
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,334
Sorry.

371
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,085
- Hi, Bill Breesen.
- Hi, Clark Kent.

372
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:40,489
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome aboard.

373
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:44,489
- Here's your towel, Mr. Clark.
- Kent.

374
00:54:44,597 --> 00:54:45,586
- What?
- Kent.

375
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,565
- Clark Kent.
- Jimmy Olsen.

376
00:54:54,908 --> 00:54:57,843
- I met this really great guy, you know.
- Hey, fabulous.

377
00:54:57,944 --> 00:55:01,345
We had this fabulous weekend.
I met him at this dude ranch.

378
00:55:01,448 --> 00:55:03,040
I haven't been since I was seven.

379
00:55:03,149 --> 00:55:05,982
- I got to mail these letters.
- Good luck tonight.

380
00:55:06,086 --> 00:55:07,553
- Hi, Clark.
- Hi, Lois.

381
00:55:07,654 --> 00:55:10,054
How did you like your first day on the job?

382
00:55:10,824 --> 00:55:13,349
The hours were sort of longer
than I expected...

383
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:16,691
...but on the whole, meeting you
and Jimmy Olsen and Mr. White...

384
00:55:16,796 --> 00:55:18,855
Gosh, on a whole, I'd say it's been swell.

385
00:55:18,965 --> 00:55:20,296
- "Swell"?
- Yup.

386
00:55:22,268 --> 00:55:23,394
You know, Clark...

387
00:55:24,804 --> 00:55:27,204
...there are very few people left
in the world...

388
00:55:27,307 --> 00:55:29,332
...who feel comfortable saying that word.

389
00:55:29,476 --> 00:55:30,670
- What word?
- Swell.

390
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:33,278
Really? I always thought
it was kind of natural.

391
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,243
- Sorry.
- Clark.

392
00:55:41,021 --> 00:55:42,545
- Sorry, Lois.
- Hi, Rex.

393
00:55:42,989 --> 00:55:45,822
- Did you see anything good today?
- Not until you came along.

394
00:55:46,126 --> 00:55:47,184
Rex, this is...

395
00:55:47,293 --> 00:55:49,227
- Clark Kent. How do...
- See you around.

396
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,730
Hey, where you going?

397
00:55:54,834 --> 00:55:56,199
Can I help you with your coat?

398
00:55:56,302 --> 00:55:58,065
- Thanks. Can you get that?
- Sure.

399
00:55:58,171 --> 00:55:59,536
Did you like Mr. White?

400
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:01,869
He was a nice guy
and Jimmy was fantastic.

401
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,471
Come here. Come on.

402
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,135
Get in here, hurry up. Come on.

403
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:09,476
- We'd better get out of here.
- We'd better do what he says, Lois.

404
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,250
Come on, get in here, quick.

405
00:56:11,384 --> 00:56:14,251
Don't, don't do anything.
It's all right, I'm coming.

406
00:56:14,387 --> 00:56:15,615
We're coming.

407
00:56:15,822 --> 00:56:16,811
Excuse me.

408
00:56:17,223 --> 00:56:18,212
- Here?
- Yeah, yeah.

409
00:56:18,324 --> 00:56:21,316
Don't point that at me, sir.
You could hurt somebody with that.

410
00:56:22,662 --> 00:56:24,220
Okay, okay. Hold it there.

411
00:56:24,497 --> 00:56:25,464
Just a minute.

412
00:56:25,765 --> 00:56:26,993
Now I realize that...

413
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:30,365
...times are tough for some these days,
but this isn't the answer.

414
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,803
You can't solve society's problems
with a gun.

415
00:56:34,941 --> 00:56:36,465
You know, buddy, you're right.

416
00:56:36,876 --> 00:56:40,403
- I'm going to turn over a new leaf.
- Good for you, sir. That's the spirit.

417
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:42,548
He doesn't really want to hurt anyone.

418
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,576
Right after I rip off this lady's purse.

419
00:56:46,953 --> 00:56:48,614
Now come on, lady, hand it over.

420
00:56:49,089 --> 00:56:50,989
Lois, I think you'd better...

421
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,053
Lois! What are you doing?

422
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:16,880
Are you all right?

423
00:57:17,884 --> 00:57:18,908
What happened?

424
00:57:19,886 --> 00:57:23,049
- Golly, I guess I must have fainted.
- Fainted?

425
00:57:24,224 --> 00:57:25,953
- You fainted!
- I'm sorry.

426
00:57:39,939 --> 00:57:42,407
Really, Lois,
supposing that man had shot you?

427
00:57:42,509 --> 00:57:44,500
Is it worth risking your life over $10...

428
00:57:44,644 --> 00:57:46,976
...two credit cards,
a hairbrush and a lipstick?

429
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:49,610
- How did you know that?
- Know what?

430
00:57:51,417 --> 00:57:53,715
You described the exact contents
of my purse.

431
00:58:08,701 --> 00:58:10,032
- Hey!
- Hi, Otis.

432
00:58:21,447 --> 00:58:23,074
So, what's happening, partner?

433
00:58:23,316 --> 00:58:24,476
Look what we got.

434
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,108
Let's take him.

435
00:58:26,352 --> 00:58:27,785
Wait a minute.

436
00:58:27,887 --> 00:58:30,117
Maybe he'll lead us to the big man himself.

437
00:58:30,523 --> 00:58:31,490
Lex Luthor?

438
00:58:31,891 --> 00:58:33,119
You got it, Aramus.

439
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:36,190
We'll make Captain by midnight.

440
00:58:38,298 --> 00:58:42,029
Hey, what do you read?
XK-101 rocket to be used.

441
00:58:42,969 --> 00:58:44,402
Hey, what do you read?

442
00:58:44,804 --> 00:58:46,499
- Hey, Matt.
- Hi, Otis.

443
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,471
Just getting a "Daily Planet" here.

444
00:58:54,581 --> 00:58:55,980
Okay. All right.

445
00:58:56,549 --> 00:58:58,847
See, I'm paying him,
and I got a pretzel, too.

446
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,010
Thanks, Otis.

447
00:59:00,887 --> 00:59:02,149
How many bags, Shutzy?

448
00:59:08,027 --> 00:59:08,925
Let's go.

449
00:59:14,033 --> 00:59:16,331
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

450
00:59:16,436 --> 00:59:18,199
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

451
00:59:18,338 --> 00:59:21,569
<i>The Metropolis Flyer is now ready</i>
<i>for departure...</i>

452
00:59:22,008 --> 00:59:24,602
...on the upper level. Track 6.

453
00:59:26,546 --> 00:59:29,674
He's going down on a train platform.
I'm going after him.

454
00:59:29,782 --> 00:59:32,376
Okay, I'll call for backup.
Be careful now, will you?

455
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,146
All right, Aramus. All right.

456
00:59:36,289 --> 00:59:38,484
<i>Now boarding on the lower level...</i>

457
00:59:39,058 --> 00:59:43,757
Now 10 minutes, air-conditioned cars,
Mount Vernon, Poughkeepsie...

458
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:45,620
Board now. All aboard.

459
00:59:45,965 --> 00:59:49,457
Metropolis Transportation
to Buffalo, Syracuse...

460
00:59:50,536 --> 00:59:53,061
Smoking cars are forward,
move along now.

461
00:59:53,706 --> 00:59:54,934
Luggage at the top.

462
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:58,443
Smoking cars are forward.
All aboard, boarding.

463
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,738
Aramus, Aramus, make it Track 22.

464
01:00:29,242 --> 01:00:32,473
I've seen him and I'm right on him.
Lower level, Track 22.

465
01:01:09,649 --> 01:01:10,877
So that's it!

466
01:01:27,066 --> 01:01:30,729
It's amazing that brain can generate
enough power to keep those legs moving.

467
01:02:16,382 --> 01:02:18,441
Harry, where are you? Harry?

468
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,440
Sick, you're really sick!

469
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:52,874
I'm sick, Ms. Teschmacher?

470
01:02:53,052 --> 01:02:56,044
Sick when we're days
from executing the crime of the century?

471
01:02:56,656 --> 01:02:58,920
No, no, no. Step away from that, please.

472
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:04,155
How do you choose to congratulate
the greatest criminal mind of our time?

473
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:06,460
Do you tell me that I'm brilliant?

474
01:03:06,566 --> 01:03:09,558
Oh, no, that would be too obvious,
I grant you.

475
01:03:09,836 --> 01:03:10,768
Charismatic?

476
01:03:11,404 --> 01:03:12,666
Fiendishly gifted?

477
01:03:13,906 --> 01:03:15,339
Try twisted!

478
01:03:21,147 --> 01:03:23,172
Get away from that, get away!

479
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:26,784
Tell me, Lex.

480
01:03:26,986 --> 01:03:29,978
Why do so many people have to die
for the crime of the century?

481
01:03:30,089 --> 01:03:31,351
Why? You ask why?

482
01:03:32,024 --> 01:03:34,822
Why does the phone always ring
when you're in the bathtub?

483
01:03:36,329 --> 01:03:39,594
Why is the most brilliantly diabolical leader
of our time...

484
01:03:40,333 --> 01:03:42,597
...surrounding himself
with total nincompoops?

485
01:03:42,702 --> 01:03:43,964
I'm back, Mr. Luthor.

486
01:03:44,704 --> 01:03:46,638
I was just talking about you.

487
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,173
You were followed again.

488
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:55,579
In spite of those cat-like reflexes.

489
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:02,349
Mr. Luthor, I'm sorry.

490
01:04:05,024 --> 01:04:06,924
Is that the newspaper
I asked you to get me?

491
01:04:08,027 --> 01:04:08,925
Yes.

492
01:04:09,896 --> 01:04:11,488
Then why am I not reading it?

493
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:15,366
Because I haven't given it to you yet?

494
01:04:21,707 --> 01:04:22,935
At last it's official.

495
01:04:24,076 --> 01:04:26,169
Thanks to the help of the US Government...

496
01:04:26,312 --> 01:04:30,078
...we are about to be involved in
the greatest real-estate swindle of all time.

497
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:31,711
Lex, what is this...

498
01:04:31,817 --> 01:04:34,911
...obsession with real estate?
All the time, "land, land, land."

499
01:04:35,254 --> 01:04:38,087
When I was 6 years old,
my father said to me...

500
01:04:40,927 --> 01:04:44,522
Before that, he said,
"Son, stocks may rise and fall...

501
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:47,428
"...utilities and transportation systems
may collapse...

502
01:04:47,533 --> 01:04:50,593
"...people are no damn good,
but they'll always need land...

503
01:04:50,703 --> 01:04:53,001
"...they'll pay through the nose to get it."

504
01:04:53,105 --> 01:04:55,300
- "Remember," my father said...
- "Land."

505
01:04:58,678 --> 01:05:01,010
It's a pity that he didn't see...

506
01:05:01,113 --> 01:05:04,014
...from such humble beginnings
how I've created this empire.

507
01:05:04,116 --> 01:05:05,378
An empire. This?

508
01:05:06,686 --> 01:05:11,282
How many girls do you know
have a Park Avenue address like this?

509
01:05:12,024 --> 01:05:15,118
Park Avenue address, 200 feet below?

510
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:18,054
Do you realize
what people are shelling out up there...

511
01:05:18,364 --> 01:05:20,924
...for a few miserable rooms
off a common elevator.

512
01:05:21,534 --> 01:05:23,434
What more could anyone ask?

513
01:05:31,611 --> 01:05:34,546
Get this Loch Ness update
right into composing.

514
01:05:34,981 --> 01:05:38,075
Yeah. No, that's it, Roth.
Put it to bed. Right.

515
01:05:38,918 --> 01:05:41,148
- Why are you standing here for?
- I'm not.

516
01:05:42,088 --> 01:05:43,680
- I wasn't going to say it.
- Go.

517
01:05:48,828 --> 01:05:50,762
The sex maniac profile.

518
01:05:50,997 --> 01:05:54,228
Right. Nine to five it's
a Pulitzer Prize winner. What do you bet?

519
01:05:54,333 --> 01:05:55,925
There's no "Z" in "brassiere."

520
01:05:56,168 --> 01:05:58,432
Nice job on that union scandal, Kent.

521
01:05:58,771 --> 01:06:00,136
Gosh, thanks, Mr. White.

522
01:06:04,977 --> 01:06:06,274
Hi, Clark. Good night.

523
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:09,143
- Here, let me carry that for you.
- Thanks a lot.

524
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:11,316
Lois, have you got a minute?

525
01:06:11,851 --> 01:06:12,943
Excuse me, please.

526
01:06:14,253 --> 01:06:17,586
And these two go to the addresses
on the envelope, okay?

527
01:06:18,424 --> 01:06:20,654
I was wondering
if you'd have dinner with me?

528
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,660
I'm sorry, I'm booked.

529
01:06:23,429 --> 01:06:27,195
Air Force One is landing at the airport.
This kid'll be there to make sure...

530
01:06:27,299 --> 01:06:30,325
...you-know-who answers the questions
he would rather duck.

531
01:06:30,436 --> 01:06:31,767
Don't you ever let up?

532
01:06:32,038 --> 01:06:34,905
What for? I mean I've seen
how the other half lives.

533
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:38,874
My sister, for instance.
Three kids, two cats, and one mortgage.

534
01:06:39,478 --> 01:06:41,275
I would go bananas in a week.

535
01:06:41,447 --> 01:06:44,211
- Can I take you to the airport?
- Not unless you can fly.

536
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,250
"Ladies." I have to change, thank you.
Goodbye.

537
01:06:50,356 --> 01:06:51,516
Maybe we could...

538
01:06:59,198 --> 01:07:02,065
- Would you mail that for me? Thanks.
- Sure.

539
01:07:02,334 --> 01:07:03,301
Good night.

540
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:11,305
Going down, please, going down.

541
01:07:14,747 --> 01:07:15,736
Going down?

542
01:07:15,881 --> 01:07:17,212
Going up. Up, up.

543
01:07:19,151 --> 01:07:20,118
Good night.

544
01:07:32,264 --> 01:07:34,391
Daily Planet, Copter One. This is ground.

545
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,831
<i>Planet One, go ahead.</i>

546
01:07:36,068 --> 01:07:40,402
<i>Miss Lane is here for a ride to the airport</i>
<i>to meet Air Force One. It's a hurry flight.</i>

547
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:44,867
<i>We're on our way over the river.</i>
<i>Have one aboard for transfer. Over.</i>

548
01:07:45,277 --> 01:07:50,044
<i>Roger, Planet One. You're clear to land.</i>
<i>Wind 0-2-0-1-5. Altimeter 2-9-8-9.</i>

549
01:07:50,449 --> 01:07:51,711
<i>Roger, Over and out.</i>

550
01:08:53,012 --> 01:08:54,536
A malfunction, can't get lift off.

551
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,114
<i>- You've hooked a cable.</i>
- What's happening?

552
01:08:58,717 --> 01:08:59,706
<i>Set it down.</i>

553
01:08:59,819 --> 01:09:01,582
My God, we've lost motor control.

554
01:09:01,687 --> 01:09:02,745
I can't hold it.

555
01:09:09,461 --> 01:09:10,519
I can't hold it.

556
01:09:11,997 --> 01:09:12,929
He's lost it.

557
01:09:31,851 --> 01:09:33,443
Help!

558
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:53,366
Step back, folks.

559
01:09:54,139 --> 01:09:56,664
Get back. Move over
to the other side of the street.

560
01:09:59,712 --> 01:10:02,510
Bring the canvas here.
Get it up there.

561
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:04,271
There's helicopter up there.

562
01:10:10,723 --> 01:10:11,747
Help me.

563
01:10:20,566 --> 01:10:22,898
All right, folks. Let's move back.

564
01:10:23,903 --> 01:10:25,495
Let these firemen get in here.

565
01:10:35,447 --> 01:10:36,709
Hold it. Get back.

566
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:42,787
Get off the street, folks.

567
01:10:57,336 --> 01:11:00,601
All right, get along there.
Get away from the side of the building.

568
01:11:03,409 --> 01:11:05,468
Hold these crowds back. Move.

569
01:11:25,464 --> 01:11:26,396
Say, Jim...

570
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,433
That's a bad outfit.

571
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:32,603
Okay, move these people.

572
01:11:42,514 --> 01:11:43,947
Oh, my God! Look up there.

573
01:11:45,985 --> 01:11:47,213
What the hell's that?

574
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:50,878
Easy, miss. I've got you.

575
01:11:51,023 --> 01:11:53,958
You've got me? Who's got you?

576
01:11:55,761 --> 01:11:59,697
I can't believe it, I just cannot
believe it. He got her.

577
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,511
Gentlemen, this man needs help.

578
01:12:48,547 --> 01:12:51,516
I hope this little incident
hasn't put you off flying, miss.

579
01:12:53,318 --> 01:12:56,719
Statistically speaking, of course,
it's still the safest way to travel.

580
01:12:59,825 --> 01:13:00,792
Wait!

581
01:13:05,497 --> 01:13:06,589
Who are you?

582
01:13:07,566 --> 01:13:08,498
A friend.

583
01:13:13,872 --> 01:13:14,839
'Bye.

584
01:14:28,347 --> 01:14:30,144
Something wrong with the elevator?

585
01:14:37,656 --> 01:14:38,554
Going down?

586
01:14:55,707 --> 01:14:57,971
Good evening, Officer Mooney.

587
01:14:58,777 --> 01:15:00,836
They say confession is good for the soul.

588
01:15:02,781 --> 01:15:05,716
I'd listen to this man. Take him away.

589
01:15:51,763 --> 01:15:53,424
Come on, let's get out of here.

590
01:16:04,042 --> 01:16:05,475
Move your ass! Come on!

591
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:07,869
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

592
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:11,411
Drop your weapons. Drop your weapons.

593
01:16:11,683 --> 01:16:14,277
Bullshit! Come on, let's get out of here.

594
01:16:14,519 --> 01:16:16,453
Okay, hold it. Hold it right there.

595
01:16:16,788 --> 01:16:18,050
Okay, freeze, you turkeys.

596
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:20,249
- Don't shoot!
- Keep your cool. You got us.

597
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:46,142
Bad vibrations?

598
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:49,946
Sergeant, you don't believe me.
I swear it, flying.

599
01:16:50,455 --> 01:16:52,946
With a big red cape
and bright red boots as well.

600
01:16:53,458 --> 01:16:57,724
Quick as a wink he was gone. He flew up
in the air again, he did, like a big blue bird.

601
01:16:58,096 --> 01:16:59,961
- A big blue bird?
- You don't believe me!

602
01:17:00,065 --> 01:17:01,430
With bright red boots?

603
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:02,860
Take the night off.

604
01:17:02,968 --> 01:17:05,562
Go back to Murphy's bar
and continue what you started.

605
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:08,772
I'll be off in a few minutes
and I'll meet you there.

606
01:17:19,918 --> 01:17:22,284
The first bottle's on me.
Let me get my hat.

607
01:17:33,465 --> 01:17:35,660
Frisky, will you come down from there.

608
01:17:37,969 --> 01:17:39,402
Hi. I'll get him.

609
01:17:44,509 --> 01:17:46,033
Come on, it's all right.

610
01:17:47,713 --> 01:17:50,546
- Here you go, miss.
- Gee, thanks, mister.

611
01:17:53,185 --> 01:17:55,176
Goodbye, Frisky. So long now.

612
01:18:03,228 --> 01:18:05,822
Mommy, Mommy,
Frisky was stuck in the tree.

613
01:18:06,064 --> 01:18:08,828
Then this man swooped out of the sky
and gave him to me.

614
01:18:09,134 --> 01:18:11,864
Haven't I told you to stop telling lies.

615
01:18:16,975 --> 01:18:20,809
Metropolis Airport, this is Air Force One.
Could we have the latest weather report?

616
01:18:21,079 --> 01:18:24,947
<i>Metropolis currently ceiling 500,</i>
<i>overcast 700 broken...</i>

617
01:18:25,183 --> 01:18:29,279
<i>... visibility one half in showers.</i>
<i>Wind 2-4-0-2-5. Altimeter 9-0-9-8.</i>

618
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:33,655
Doesn't look good. What do you think?

619
01:18:35,394 --> 01:18:38,727
- What the hell was that?
- You've lost power in number one.

620
01:18:38,864 --> 01:18:40,855
Lost power?
We've lost the whole engine.

621
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,459
- Pressure's going.
- Shut down number one.

622
01:18:43,568 --> 01:18:44,626
Bring up two and three.

623
01:18:44,736 --> 01:18:47,000
We haven't got enough pressure
to keep going.

624
01:18:48,607 --> 01:18:51,872
Mayday, mayday. Metropolis tower.
Air Force One.

625
01:18:52,244 --> 01:18:55,179
We have lost port outboard engine
and part of wing.

626
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:58,278
Request emergency landing.
What's the position?

627
01:18:58,450 --> 01:19:00,577
Ten miles southwest of Metropolis Airport.

628
01:19:00,685 --> 01:19:02,209
Notify them the President's on board.

629
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:06,154
Present position 10 miles, that's 10 miles
southwest of Metropolis Airport.

630
01:19:06,258 --> 01:19:09,659
Heading: 3-0-5, height: 6,000 feet.

631
01:19:29,314 --> 01:19:31,714
What the hell happened?
We got our engine back?

632
01:19:32,117 --> 01:19:34,017
What the hell's going on out there?

633
01:19:34,252 --> 01:19:37,346
Fly, don't look, just fly.

634
01:19:37,756 --> 01:19:39,246
We got something.

635
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:43,256
I'm not saying what it is, just trust me.

636
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:57,637
<i>You enjoyed it.</i>

637
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,311
I don't know what to say, Father.

638
01:20:03,648 --> 01:20:05,411
I am afraid just got carried away.

639
01:20:06,551 --> 01:20:09,281
<i>- I anticipated this, my son.</i>
- You couldn't have.

640
01:20:10,522 --> 01:20:12,149
You couldn't have imagined...

641
01:20:13,592 --> 01:20:14,820
<i>How good it felt?</i>

642
01:20:17,662 --> 01:20:19,220
<i>You are revealed to the world.</i>

643
01:20:21,433 --> 01:20:22,365
<i>Very well.</i>

644
01:20:25,403 --> 01:20:27,997
<i>But you still must keep</i>
<i>your secret identity.</i>

645
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:29,672
Why?

646
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:31,602
<i>The reasons are two.</i>

647
01:20:32,611 --> 01:20:35,512
<i>First: You cannot serve humanity</i>
<i>28 hours a day.</i>

648
01:20:37,115 --> 01:20:38,639
24.

649
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:41,450
<i>As it is, it won't happen.</i>

650
01:20:43,388 --> 01:20:45,913
<i>Your help will be called for endlessly.</i>

651
01:20:46,024 --> 01:20:49,391
<i>Even for those tasks that human beings</i>
<i>can solve themselves.</i>

652
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:53,496
<i>They're happy to abuse the resources</i>
<i>of the world.</i>

653
01:20:54,065 --> 01:20:55,089
And secondly?

654
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,167
<i>Secondly:</i>

655
01:20:56,601 --> 01:20:58,193
<i>Your enemies will discover...</i>

656
01:20:59,371 --> 01:21:01,100
<i>... their only way to hurt you...</i>

657
01:21:01,606 --> 01:21:03,540
<i>... by hurting the people you care for.</i>

658
01:21:05,143 --> 01:21:06,167
Thank you, Father.

659
01:21:06,578 --> 01:21:07,510
<i>Lastly:</i>

660
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:12,773
<i>Do not punish yourself</i>
<i>with your feelings of vanity.</i>

661
01:21:13,552 --> 01:21:15,179
<i>Simply learn to control them.</i>

662
01:21:15,687 --> 01:21:18,451
<i>It is an affliction common to all,</i>
<i>even on Krypton.</i>

663
01:21:19,491 --> 01:21:22,790
<i>Our destruction could have been avoided</i>
<i>but for the vanity of some...</i>

664
01:21:22,894 --> 01:21:25,362
<i>... who considered us indestructible.</i>

665
01:21:26,364 --> 01:21:27,831
<i>Were it not for vanity...</i>

666
01:21:29,501 --> 01:21:31,162
<i>... at this very moment...</i>

667
01:21:35,574 --> 01:21:37,735
<i>... I could embrace you in my arms...</i>

668
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,378
<i>... my son.</i>

669
01:22:14,646 --> 01:22:18,082
<i>Reports are coming in</i>
<i>of a miraculous saving of Air Force One...</i>

670
01:22:18,249 --> 01:22:20,649
<i>... from almost certain destruction.</i>

671
01:22:21,119 --> 01:22:25,215
<i>Rescuing Miss Lois Lane, reporter</i>
from the Daily Planet, with one hand...

672
01:22:26,658 --> 01:22:28,683
<i>... and a crashed helicopter with the other.</i>

673
01:22:31,529 --> 01:22:33,087
That'll be the day.

674
01:22:34,799 --> 01:22:36,926
That'll be the day when a guy could fly.

675
01:22:37,802 --> 01:22:40,100
I don't know. You would be surprised.

676
01:22:42,674 --> 01:22:44,266
<i>Some sort of fantastic hoax.</i>

677
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:47,477
<i>Your guess is as good as anybody's.</i>
<i>True or false?</i>

678
01:22:47,579 --> 01:22:49,604
<i>Miracle or fraud? The answer...</i>

679
01:22:49,814 --> 01:22:51,441
- Miss Teschmacher!
- Man or myth?

680
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:53,208
Turn it off.

681
01:23:02,661 --> 01:23:06,427
What's the story on this guy?
Do you think it's the genuine article?

682
01:23:06,598 --> 01:23:08,429
If he is, he's not from this world.

683
01:23:10,502 --> 01:23:14,233
If any human being was gonna perpetrate
such a hoax, it would have been me!

684
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,912
Right away, Mr. Luthor.

685
01:23:32,223 --> 01:23:35,021
It all fits somehow,
this coming here to Metropolis...

686
01:23:36,461 --> 01:23:38,224
...and at this particular time.

687
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,532
There's a kind of cruel justice about it.

688
01:23:44,936 --> 01:23:49,168
To commit the crime of the century, a man
wants to face the challenge of the century.

689
01:23:52,043 --> 01:23:56,537
Listen, maybe this guy that flies
is just sort of passing through.

690
01:23:57,048 --> 01:23:58,106
Passing through?

691
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:00,449
Not on your life, Otis...

692
01:24:00,552 --> 01:24:02,884
...which I would gladly sacrifice
by the way...

693
01:24:03,588 --> 01:24:07,285
...for the opportunity of destroying
everything that he represents.

694
01:24:08,526 --> 01:24:13,293
And, Otis, by the way, next time
put my robe on after I'm out of the pool.

695
01:24:16,935 --> 01:24:18,129
"The Post", "It Flies."

696
01:24:18,636 --> 01:24:20,729
"The News", "Look, Ma, No Wires."

697
01:24:21,005 --> 01:24:23,098
"The Times",
"Blue Bomb Buzzes Metropolis."

698
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:26,740
"The Planet." We're sitting on top
of the story of the century here.

699
01:24:27,512 --> 01:24:29,673
I want the name
of this flying whatchamacallit...

700
01:24:29,781 --> 01:24:31,908
...to go with the "Daily Planet"
like bacon and eggs...

701
01:24:32,016 --> 01:24:35,042
...franks and beans, death and taxes,
politics and corruption.

702
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:36,514
I don't think that he'd...

703
01:24:36,621 --> 01:24:39,181
...lend himself
to any cheap promotion schemes.

704
01:24:39,424 --> 01:24:40,891
Exactly how would you know that?

705
01:24:44,129 --> 01:24:45,721
Just first impression.

706
01:24:45,864 --> 01:24:48,492
Who's talking cheap?
I'll make him a partner if I have to.

707
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:49,862
- Right?
- Right, Chief.

708
01:24:51,936 --> 01:24:53,198
I want the real story.

709
01:24:53,605 --> 01:24:55,573
I want the inside dope on this guy.

710
01:24:56,207 --> 01:24:59,699
Has he got a family? Where does he live?
What does the "S" stand for?

711
01:24:59,844 --> 01:25:04,907
Tonight at 8:00. Your place.
Hopefully - A friend.

712
01:25:08,653 --> 01:25:10,883
Tony, who is he? Mike, what's his name?

713
01:25:11,156 --> 01:25:13,624
What's he got hidden under that cape?
Batteries?

714
01:25:13,725 --> 01:25:15,556
Why did he show up last night?

715
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:17,550
Where does he come from?

716
01:25:17,729 --> 01:25:19,026
Does he have a girlfriend?

717
01:25:21,099 --> 01:25:22,964
What's his favorite ball team, Kent?

718
01:25:23,067 --> 01:25:25,661
Now listen to me, I tell you,
boys and girls...

719
01:25:26,070 --> 01:25:28,095
...whichever one of you gets it out of him...

720
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:31,697
...is going to wind up with the single,
most important interview since...

721
01:25:33,044 --> 01:25:34,409
...God talked to Moses!

722
01:25:38,049 --> 01:25:40,813
What are you standing around about for?
Move!

723
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:42,918
Get on that story.

724
01:26:01,372 --> 01:26:04,739
"8:00," he said. Some friend!

725
01:26:06,477 --> 01:26:09,310
That's the story of my life,
"Cinderella Bites The Dust!"

726
01:26:21,693 --> 01:26:23,183
Good evening, Miss Lane.

727
01:26:28,066 --> 01:26:29,931
Did you have plans this evening?

728
01:26:31,302 --> 01:26:32,530
This old thing? No.

729
01:26:33,404 --> 01:26:34,928
- I could come back later.
- No!

730
01:26:40,011 --> 01:26:41,342
Sure you can move.

731
01:26:42,547 --> 01:26:44,174
Just don't fly away, all right?

732
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:48,218
Sorry to drop in on you like this,
but I've been thinking.

733
01:26:48,553 --> 01:26:52,011
There must be some questions
people'd like to know the answers to.

734
01:26:52,123 --> 01:26:53,090
Yes.

735
01:26:58,897 --> 01:27:00,524
You really shouldn't smoke.

736
01:27:02,433 --> 01:27:04,298
Don't tell me. Lung cancer, right?

737
01:27:07,272 --> 01:27:08,830
Well, not yet, thank goodness.

738
01:27:12,443 --> 01:27:14,035
Would you like a glass of wine?

739
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:16,246
No, thanks. I never drink when I fly.

740
01:27:17,849 --> 01:27:18,838
Nice place.

741
01:27:19,284 --> 01:27:20,478
Thank you.

742
01:27:20,952 --> 01:27:22,112
Thank you.

743
01:27:22,553 --> 01:27:24,748
Shall we get started with the interview?

744
01:27:31,562 --> 01:27:34,258
Let's start with your vital statistics.
Are you married?

745
01:27:36,067 --> 01:27:37,091
No, I'm not.

746
01:27:38,202 --> 01:27:39,726
Do you have a girlfriend?

747
01:27:39,871 --> 01:27:41,133
No, I don't. But...

748
01:27:41,773 --> 01:27:44,037
If I did, you'd be the first
to know about it.

749
01:27:50,581 --> 01:27:52,572
- How old are you?
- Over 21.

750
01:27:53,751 --> 01:27:55,912
I get it. You don't want anyone to know.

751
01:27:56,654 --> 01:27:59,020
And how big are you? How tall are you?

752
01:27:59,357 --> 01:28:00,415
About 6' 4".

753
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:03,752
6' 4". And how much do you weigh?

754
01:28:03,962 --> 01:28:05,623
Around 225.

755
01:28:06,597 --> 01:28:08,428
225?

756
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,167
I assume then that...

757
01:28:18,643 --> 01:28:22,306
...the rest of your bodily functions
are normal?

758
01:28:23,448 --> 01:28:24,506
I beg your pardon?

759
01:28:25,783 --> 01:28:27,580
Well, putting it delicately...

760
01:28:32,156 --> 01:28:33,248
...do you...

761
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:40,959
Yes, I do, when I'm hungry.

762
01:28:41,833 --> 01:28:44,324
You do. Of course, you do.

763
01:28:45,103 --> 01:28:47,503
Well, then is it true...

764
01:28:48,339 --> 01:28:52,298
...that you can see through anything?

765
01:28:52,777 --> 01:28:54,472
Yes, I can, pretty much.

766
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:58,608
And that you're totally impervious to pain?

767
01:28:59,217 --> 01:29:00,206
Well, so far.

768
01:29:02,053 --> 01:29:03,850
What color underwear am I wearing?

769
01:29:08,493 --> 01:29:09,721
Did I embarrass you?

770
01:29:09,961 --> 01:29:11,292
- No.
- I did.

771
01:29:11,729 --> 01:29:14,289
No, it’s just that
this planter must be made of lead.

772
01:29:16,467 --> 01:29:19,994
I sort of have a problem
seeing through lead.

773
01:29:21,139 --> 01:29:22,299
That's interesting.

774
01:29:23,241 --> 01:29:24,435
Problems with lead.

775
01:29:25,943 --> 01:29:28,969
- Do you have a first name?
- Like Ralph, or something?

776
01:29:29,113 --> 01:29:30,512
- No, I mean like...
- Pink.

777
01:29:35,953 --> 01:29:37,944
Sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you.

778
01:29:39,490 --> 01:29:40,855
You didn't embarrass me.

779
01:29:43,127 --> 01:29:45,254
What's your background?
Where are you from?

780
01:29:46,931 --> 01:29:48,956
It's kind of hard to explain, actually.

781
01:29:49,233 --> 01:29:52,361
You see, I'm from...
Well, from pretty far away.

782
01:29:52,870 --> 01:29:56,499
Another galaxy, as a matter of fact.
I come from a planet called Krypton.

783
01:29:57,842 --> 01:29:58,809
Krypton.

784
01:30:00,178 --> 01:30:03,443
Cripton! With a C-r-i...

785
01:30:04,849 --> 01:30:08,114
No, actually it's Krypton,
with a K-R-Y-P-T-O-N.

786
01:30:11,956 --> 01:30:13,184
Do you like pink?

787
01:30:18,563 --> 01:30:20,030
I like pink very much.

788
01:30:27,939 --> 01:30:31,431
I mean, why are you here?
There must be a reason for you to be here.

789
01:30:31,876 --> 01:30:35,277
Yes, I'm here to fight for truth and justice
and the American way.

790
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:39,377
You'll end up fighting every official
in this country.

791
01:30:39,817 --> 01:30:41,250
You don't really mean that.

792
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:43,710
- I don't believe this.
- Lois?

793
01:30:45,022 --> 01:30:46,011
I never lie.

794
01:30:55,032 --> 01:30:57,000
How fast do you fly, by the way?

795
01:30:57,602 --> 01:31:01,060
I don't know. I've never actually bothered
to time myself.

796
01:31:04,575 --> 01:31:05,872
Why don't we find out?

797
01:31:06,644 --> 01:31:08,475
And how do you propose we do that?

798
01:31:09,213 --> 01:31:12,341
- Take a ride with me.
- You mean I could fly?

799
01:31:12,450 --> 01:31:14,645
I'd be handling the flying,
if that's okay.

800
01:31:14,952 --> 01:31:18,080
- This is utterly fantastic.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?

801
01:31:18,523 --> 01:31:20,354
- Are you serious?
- Sure.

802
01:31:21,125 --> 01:31:22,422
Don't you want to go?

803
01:31:24,095 --> 01:31:25,289
You won't need these.

804
01:31:25,396 --> 01:31:28,957
- I need a sweater. It must be kind of...
- No, you'll be warm enough.

805
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:41,436
Clark said that you were just a figment
of somebody's imagination.

806
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:43,704
Like Peter Pan.

807
01:31:44,348 --> 01:31:46,816
Clark, who's that? Your boyfriend?

808
01:31:47,118 --> 01:31:50,519
- Clark? No, he's nothing.
- Peter Pan?

809
01:31:53,024 --> 01:31:56,357
Peter Pan flew with children, Lois.
In a fairy tale.

810
01:35:13,491 --> 01:35:14,890
<i>Can you read my mind?</i>

811
01:35:20,531 --> 01:35:22,692
<i>Do you know what it is that you do to me?</i>

812
01:35:26,137 --> 01:35:27,570
<i>I don't know who you are.</i>

813
01:35:33,577 --> 01:35:35,738
<i>Just a friend from another star.</i>

814
01:35:40,217 --> 01:35:42,378
<i>Here I am, like a kid out of school.</i>

815
01:35:44,388 --> 01:35:45,946
<i>Holding hands with a god.</i>

816
01:35:48,058 --> 01:35:49,025
<i>I'm a fool.</i>

817
01:35:51,162 --> 01:35:52,322
<i>Will you look at me?</i>

818
01:35:55,099 --> 01:35:56,896
<i>Like a little girl shivering.</i>

819
01:35:58,335 --> 01:36:00,200
<i>You can see right through me.</i>

820
01:36:05,576 --> 01:36:06,907
<i>Can you read my mind?</i>

821
01:36:10,948 --> 01:36:13,212
<i>Can you picture the things I'm thinking of?</i>

822
01:36:18,022 --> 01:36:19,785
<i>Wondering why you are...</i>

823
01:36:21,725 --> 01:36:24,285
<i>... all the wonderful things you are.</i>

824
01:36:27,264 --> 01:36:28,424
<i>You can fly.</i>

825
01:36:30,067 --> 01:36:31,557
<i>You belong in the sky.</i>

826
01:36:33,904 --> 01:36:34,836
<i>You and I...</i>

827
01:36:36,874 --> 01:36:38,501
<i>... could belong to each other.</i>

828
01:36:42,079 --> 01:36:43,478
<i>If you need a friend...</i>

829
01:36:47,117 --> 01:36:48,982
<i>... I'm the one to fly to.</i>

830
01:36:53,624 --> 01:36:55,387
<i>If you need to be loved...</i>

831
01:36:57,394 --> 01:36:58,383
<i>... here I am.</i>

832
01:37:00,264 --> 01:37:01,458
<i>Read my mind.</i>

833
01:37:23,821 --> 01:37:25,413
We forgot to time ourselves.

834
01:37:27,958 --> 01:37:29,152
Maybe next time.

835
01:37:43,774 --> 01:37:44,672
Good night.

836
01:37:52,783 --> 01:37:53,875
What a super man!

837
01:38:00,524 --> 01:38:01,752
Superman!

838
01:38:07,231 --> 01:38:08,220
Anybody home?

839
01:38:17,308 --> 01:38:19,071
- Hi. Can I come in?
- Oh, yeah.

840
01:38:21,545 --> 01:38:23,945
For goodness' sake,
didn't you hear me knocking?

841
01:38:24,748 --> 01:38:27,717
We did have a date tonight, remember?

842
01:38:31,522 --> 01:38:32,716
You haven't been?

843
01:38:34,525 --> 01:38:38,484
I should certainly hope not.
Well, let's push off, shall we?

844
01:38:39,396 --> 01:38:41,956
I'd better get a coat. It might be cold out.

845
01:38:42,199 --> 01:38:46,431
I mean, I need a purse,
and I have to fix my hair...

846
01:38:47,404 --> 01:38:48,769
...put some blusher on.

847
01:39:07,458 --> 01:39:10,018
There's something I have to tell you.
I'm really...

848
01:39:13,297 --> 01:39:16,994
I was at first really nervous about tonight.

849
01:39:18,502 --> 01:39:22,404
But then I decided, darn it, I was going
to show you the time of your life.

850
01:39:22,673 --> 01:39:23,697
That's Clark nice.

851
01:39:26,977 --> 01:39:29,605
We could go for a hamburger
or whatever you want to do.

852
01:39:36,754 --> 01:39:37,686
Now then...

853
01:39:39,423 --> 01:39:42,358
...given the exact location
of the galaxy that he mentions...

854
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:46,152
...and the proximity
to our own solar system...

855
01:39:48,966 --> 01:39:51,560
It's amazing. Amazing!

856
01:39:52,736 --> 01:39:53,828
Too good to be true.

857
01:39:53,937 --> 01:39:57,202
It's too good to be true.
6' 4", black hair, blue eyes...

858
01:39:57,341 --> 01:39:59,673
...doesn't drink or smoke
and tells the truth.

859
01:40:00,077 --> 01:40:02,545
Some people can read "War and Peace..."

860
01:40:03,213 --> 01:40:05,306
...and think it was an adventure story.

861
01:40:05,849 --> 01:40:08,340
Others can read the ingredients
on a gum wrapper...

862
01:40:08,686 --> 01:40:10,813
...and unlock the secrets of the universe.

863
01:40:12,556 --> 01:40:16,151
Lex, what has chewing gum got to do
with the secrets of the universe?

864
01:40:19,163 --> 01:40:20,687
Right, Miss Teschmacher.

865
01:40:24,368 --> 01:40:25,835
"N."

866
01:40:26,537 --> 01:40:28,971
"M"? You want "M," Mr. Luthor?
Coming right up.

867
01:40:30,808 --> 01:40:32,332
So there you go, "M."

868
01:40:32,543 --> 01:40:34,511
"M" as in "moron," Otis? No.

869
01:40:34,845 --> 01:40:36,813
It's "N" as in "Neanderthal"...

870
01:40:37,214 --> 01:40:39,910
..."nincompoop," "nitwit,"
and "L" as in "ladder."

871
01:40:40,017 --> 01:40:41,746
Here's a ladder, coming right up.

872
01:40:41,885 --> 01:40:43,819
I didn't see...

873
01:40:44,421 --> 01:40:45,786
I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor.

874
01:40:47,691 --> 01:40:50,922
In the interview he says
that the Planet Krypton...

875
01:40:52,863 --> 01:40:54,694
...exploded in 1948.

876
01:40:55,365 --> 01:40:56,992
That ridiculous little freak...

877
01:40:57,735 --> 01:41:00,169
...took three years in a rocket
to get to earth.

878
01:41:00,938 --> 01:41:02,530
- Ergo...
- Ergo.

879
01:41:02,873 --> 01:41:05,398
Ergo 1948, that's three years on.

880
01:41:06,376 --> 01:41:07,775
He's 6' 4", you know that?

881
01:41:08,011 --> 01:41:12,880
Do you know why the number 200 is
so vitally descriptive to both you and me?

882
01:41:13,417 --> 01:41:14,907
It's your weight and my I.Q.

883
01:41:15,052 --> 01:41:16,383
Think, people, think.

884
01:41:17,821 --> 01:41:20,654
Deductive reasoning.
That's the name of the game.

885
01:41:22,659 --> 01:41:24,559
Fragments from the Planet Krypton...

886
01:41:25,329 --> 01:41:27,388
...exploded and went into outer space.

887
01:41:27,598 --> 01:41:29,361
It is reasonable to assume...

888
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:32,469
...that some of those particles of debris
drifted to Earth.

889
01:41:36,974 --> 01:41:37,872
<i>Jawohl.</i>

890
01:41:52,122 --> 01:41:54,522
A meteorite found in Addis Ababa?

891
01:41:55,759 --> 01:41:58,250
I know I'll get rapped
in the mouth for this, but...

892
01:41:58,362 --> 01:41:59,488
...so what?

893
01:42:00,063 --> 01:42:02,691
So what? You mean to us
they’re just meteorites.

894
01:42:03,667 --> 01:42:04,599
Fair enough.

895
01:42:05,569 --> 01:42:08,060
But the level of specific radioactivity...

896
01:42:08,172 --> 01:42:10,800
...is so high to anyone
from the Planet Krypton...

897
01:42:10,941 --> 01:42:12,374
...this substance is lethal.

898
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:14,977
Wait a minute, Mr. Luthor.

899
01:42:15,412 --> 01:42:17,937
Fire and bullets can't hurt this guy...

900
01:42:18,148 --> 01:42:19,547
...but this stuff here...

901
01:42:19,650 --> 01:42:21,777
...will kill him.

902
01:42:25,322 --> 01:42:27,256
Doesn't it give you a kind of...

903
01:42:27,357 --> 01:42:31,020
...a shudder of electricity through you
to be in the same room with me?

904
01:42:32,496 --> 01:42:35,488
Not like the shudder you'll get
when you lay that rock on him.

905
01:42:35,766 --> 01:42:38,860
He can see you coming for miles
with those super peepers of his.

906
01:42:39,203 --> 01:42:42,536
O Lord, you gave them eyes,
but they cannot see...

907
01:42:43,273 --> 01:42:45,366
...nor can Superman, through lead.

908
01:42:47,311 --> 01:42:49,643
He can't see through lead?

909
01:42:50,247 --> 01:42:52,181
And Kryptonite will destroy him.

910
01:42:55,919 --> 01:42:57,216
Any questions, class?

911
01:42:58,655 --> 01:43:00,885
I wonder what they're wearing
in Addis Ababa?

912
01:43:01,358 --> 01:43:02,791
Looks like a burnoose.

913
01:43:03,193 --> 01:43:04,990
It’s just a wraparound.

914
01:43:05,462 --> 01:43:08,158
Are we going to Addis Ababa, Mr. Luthor?

915
01:43:09,233 --> 01:43:11,258
<i>Mother Bird to Missile Convoy, over.</i>

916
01:43:11,768 --> 01:43:13,998
<i>Missile Convoy to Mother Bird, go ahead.</i>

917
01:43:14,271 --> 01:43:18,139
<i>Everything looks good,</i>
<i>see you at the base. Over and out.</i>

918
01:43:18,675 --> 01:43:21,007
<i>Roger, Mother Bird. Over and out.</i>

919
01:44:04,421 --> 01:44:05,353
Look at this!

920
01:44:06,156 --> 01:44:07,350
Looks pretty bad.

921
01:44:12,195 --> 01:44:13,287
Take her pulse.

922
01:44:23,740 --> 01:44:25,367
Get an ambulance down here.

923
01:44:25,509 --> 01:44:28,171
I don't want to hold this convoy up
more than I have to.

924
01:44:28,912 --> 01:44:31,346
She's having trouble breathing.
What do you think?

925
01:44:31,448 --> 01:44:34,417
I suggest a vigorous chest massage.

926
01:44:34,518 --> 01:44:36,986
If that doesn't work, mouth-to-mouth.

927
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,087
Yes, sir!

928
01:44:39,756 --> 01:44:43,055
I won't have my men do anything
I wouldn't be prepared to do myself.

929
01:44:43,327 --> 01:44:44,385
Get an ambulance.

930
01:44:44,795 --> 01:44:45,819
Gather around.

931
01:44:47,731 --> 01:44:48,755
Turn around!

932
01:45:17,027 --> 01:45:17,925
Hi.

933
01:45:18,695 --> 01:45:19,684
Somebody hurt?

934
01:45:36,079 --> 01:45:38,775
I did it, Mr. Luthor.

935
01:45:39,449 --> 01:45:41,110
Miss Teschmacher, I did it.

936
01:45:41,785 --> 01:45:44,583
- Just like you told me.
- All right, Otis.

937
01:45:44,721 --> 01:45:46,746
It isn't that I don't trust you, but...

938
01:45:48,058 --> 01:45:50,288
I don't trust you, Otis. What did you do?

939
01:45:51,428 --> 01:45:55,057
I set the first directional vector...

940
01:45:55,532 --> 01:45:56,999
...to 38.

941
01:45:57,267 --> 01:46:01,135
The second one to 67.
And the third one to 117.

942
01:46:01,438 --> 01:46:02,837
What about the fourth one?

943
01:46:03,373 --> 01:46:04,533
What fourth one?

944
01:46:04,808 --> 01:46:08,141
Wait a minute. The third one to 117?

945
01:46:08,345 --> 01:46:11,940
- Yes. See, I wrote it down, Mr. Luthor.
- Otis!

946
01:46:13,116 --> 01:46:16,108
The third one was supposed to be 11,
and the fourth one, 7.

947
01:46:18,221 --> 01:46:20,348
Oh, gee, Mr. Luthor.

948
01:46:20,724 --> 01:46:23,352
I guess my arm wasn't long enough, see.

949
01:46:23,493 --> 01:46:25,586
Would you like to see a long arm?

950
01:46:25,962 --> 01:46:29,398
Otis, would you like to see
a very, very, long arm?

951
01:46:29,499 --> 01:46:30,659
No, Mr. Luthor.

952
01:46:45,082 --> 01:46:48,210
- All right. Get it right.
- Yes, Mr. Luthor.

953
01:46:50,887 --> 01:46:53,788
MacDonald, I thought you told me
this road would be blocked off?

954
01:46:53,890 --> 01:46:57,087
- Jablowsky, didn't I tell you...
- I didn't asked him, I asked you.

955
01:46:58,462 --> 01:47:00,157
All right. Follow me, men.

956
01:47:01,898 --> 01:47:05,095
Back that thing off the road.
Back it off the road.

957
01:47:15,078 --> 01:47:17,911
You'll have to circle back.
I don't have time to argue.

958
01:47:18,014 --> 01:47:19,641
It's a heck of a day, isn't it?

959
01:47:27,357 --> 01:47:29,985
- Route 12? That's back there.
- No, sir, it's up there.

960
01:47:33,096 --> 01:47:36,623
- Sergeant, we took the wrong road.
- I'm a Lieutenant. A Naval Officer.

961
01:47:44,241 --> 01:47:47,472
Shut up! Now Route 12 is back that way.

962
01:47:53,717 --> 01:47:55,776
This man is a diabetic, you see.

963
01:48:07,097 --> 01:48:10,760
As you know, the "Daily Planet"
is very interested in that dam...

964
01:48:11,168 --> 01:48:12,897
...but what I don't understand...

965
01:48:13,003 --> 01:48:15,995
...is why you'd sell out to a faceless person
you've never met?

966
01:48:16,139 --> 01:48:17,470
You don't know his name.

967
01:48:21,278 --> 01:48:23,576
At the stupid high price he offered...

968
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:26,080
...for this worthless piece of desert...

969
01:48:26,183 --> 01:48:28,014
...I hope it's Custer!

970
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:32,381
Perfect, just what I need. Thank you.

971
01:48:33,190 --> 01:48:36,421
<i>Reporting live from the launch site,</i>
<i>ground zero.</i>

972
01:48:37,894 --> 01:48:41,022
<i>Today marks a historic occasion since...</i>

973
01:48:41,298 --> 01:48:45,462
<i>... two XK-101 rockets will be</i>
<i>launched simultaneously.</i>

974
01:48:46,469 --> 01:48:49,165
<i>One by the Army, and one by the Navy.</i>

975
01:48:49,306 --> 01:48:51,604
Hi, everybody.
Has anybody seen Lois today?

976
01:48:51,741 --> 01:48:53,902
No, but the Chief wants to see you.

977
01:48:54,044 --> 01:48:55,841
You're blocking the set, Clark.

978
01:48:56,680 --> 01:48:59,274
Sorry, Gil. How's Judy today? Okay?

979
01:49:01,117 --> 01:49:02,379
Excuse me, Mr. White.

980
01:49:02,519 --> 01:49:05,420
You wanted to see me, sir?
Have you seen Lois today?

981
01:49:06,389 --> 01:49:08,687
She's out West,
looking into a land-fraud deal.

982
01:49:09,059 --> 01:49:11,653
I sent young Olsen with her
on his first assignment.

983
01:49:11,761 --> 01:49:15,026
Some unidentified clown
is buying thousands of acres...

984
01:49:15,131 --> 01:49:17,326
...of worthless desert at incredible prices.

985
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:19,161
That doesn't seem to make sense.

986
01:49:19,269 --> 01:49:21,863
The world doesn't make sense.
You ought to know that.

987
01:49:22,439 --> 01:49:24,532
Look at this dispatch from Addis Ababa.

988
01:49:24,975 --> 01:49:28,911
People break into a museum at night,
kill two people, and what do they take?

989
01:49:29,045 --> 01:49:31,673
A worthless piece of meteorite.
How do you figure that?

990
01:49:32,716 --> 01:49:35,378
I've never been able
to understand violence.

991
01:49:36,019 --> 01:49:37,350
I know that about you.

992
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:39,420
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

993
01:49:40,523 --> 01:49:43,287
I've been in this news game
40 years man and boy...

994
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:47,157
...and I got where I am
with guts, compassion...

995
01:49:47,631 --> 01:49:50,623
...elbow grease and something
you're sadly lacking in, son.

996
01:49:52,769 --> 01:49:55,294
Not humility, you've got bags of humility.

997
01:49:55,872 --> 01:49:57,999
Aggression, confidence, that's the ticket.

998
01:49:58,408 --> 01:50:00,467
Take charge.
Let people know who you are.

999
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:10,676
<i>This is Lex Luthor.</i>

1000
01:50:11,288 --> 01:50:14,815
<i>Only one thing alive with less than</i>
<i>four legs can hear this frequency.</i>

1001
01:50:14,924 --> 01:50:15,891
<i>That's you.</i>

1002
01:50:16,326 --> 01:50:20,922
<i>In five minutes, a poisoned gas pellet</i>
<i>containing propane lithium compound...</i>

1003
01:50:21,598 --> 01:50:24,692
<i>... will be released through thousands</i>
<i>of air ducts in this city...</i>

1004
01:50:24,801 --> 01:50:28,202
<i>... effectively annihilating</i>
<i>half the population of Metropolis.</i>

1005
01:50:28,305 --> 01:50:31,399
I was a reporter before most of my friends
were copy boys.

1006
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:34,537
I want you to get Lois
to introduce you to Superman.

1007
01:50:34,811 --> 01:50:37,939
Find out who he is.
Where did he get that blue suit?

1008
01:50:38,181 --> 01:50:40,877
Did he have it made?
Is it silk? Is it plastic?

1009
01:50:41,618 --> 01:50:43,347
<i>I know it all seems a bit much...</i>

1010
01:50:43,453 --> 01:50:45,853
<i>... but how else was I going to meet you,</i>
<i>Superman?</i>

1011
01:50:46,056 --> 01:50:49,219
<i>I knew you'd never accept</i>
<i>an invitation to tea.</i>

1012
01:50:50,627 --> 01:50:54,791
<i>But a disaster, with people in danger,</i>
<i>people who need help...</i>

1013
01:50:56,399 --> 01:51:00,495
<i>I just knew you couldn't resist</i>
<i>that chance to sort of pitch in.</i>

1014
01:51:01,338 --> 01:51:02,635
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

1015
01:51:36,039 --> 01:51:39,167
<i>There's a strong streak of good in you,</i>
<i>Superman.</i>

1016
01:51:40,377 --> 01:51:42,004
<i>But then nobody's perfect.</i>

1017
01:51:45,548 --> 01:51:46,879
<i>Almost nobody.</i>

1018
01:51:56,192 --> 01:51:57,489
- Oh, Superman!
- Gee!

1019
01:51:57,927 --> 01:52:00,828
Stand back, please.
Nothing to get worried about.

1020
01:52:06,703 --> 01:52:08,534
Don't sit there like a numskull, get out!

1021
01:52:22,452 --> 01:52:24,886
Look at that overgrown boy scout,
Miss Teschmacher.

1022
01:52:25,755 --> 01:52:27,120
Tell me what you see?

1023
01:52:28,324 --> 01:52:30,087
Cuteness, dimples.

1024
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:32,052
You like cuteness?

1025
01:52:35,064 --> 01:52:36,361
I'll give you dimples.

1026
01:53:11,167 --> 01:53:13,135
<i>The pressure is still on you.</i>

1027
01:53:13,903 --> 01:53:16,167
<i>You know they say:</i>
<i>If you can't stand the heat...</i>

1028
01:53:16,306 --> 01:53:17,739
...get out of the tunnel.

1029
01:53:41,197 --> 01:53:42,926
It's your last chance, Superman.

1030
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,366
<i>Why don't you do yourself a favor</i>
<i>and freeze.</i>

1031
01:54:48,064 --> 01:54:49,725
I think he's coming, Mr. Luthor.

1032
01:55:00,977 --> 01:55:02,740
He's definitely coming.

1033
01:55:14,390 --> 01:55:15,618
It's open, come in.

1034
01:55:18,328 --> 01:55:21,525
My attorney will be in touch with you
about the damage to the door.

1035
01:55:21,798 --> 01:55:23,459
Otis, take the gentleman's cape.

1036
01:55:29,405 --> 01:55:31,168
I don't think he wants me to.

1037
01:55:31,307 --> 01:55:32,672
Where's the gas pellet?

1038
01:55:36,512 --> 01:55:38,446
It's in the back of my mind, actually.

1039
01:55:39,649 --> 01:55:41,446
It's a little idea I was toying with.

1040
01:55:41,551 --> 01:55:44,145
Is that how a warped brain like yours
gets its kicks?

1041
01:55:44,253 --> 01:55:46,346
By planning the death of innocent people?

1042
01:55:46,589 --> 01:55:49,456
No. By causing the death
of innocent people.

1043
01:55:49,559 --> 01:55:50,526
<i>Fire!</i>

1044
01:55:53,496 --> 01:55:55,896
<i>Navy Bird, we have a good launch.</i>

1045
01:56:07,276 --> 01:56:09,710
As you may or may not know,
I am, as they say...

1046
01:56:10,613 --> 01:56:12,376
...very heavy into real estate.

1047
01:56:13,049 --> 01:56:17,281
To make money, you have to buy
for a little and sell for a lot, right?

1048
01:56:17,687 --> 01:56:18,551
Right.

1049
01:56:20,123 --> 01:56:21,590
So, the problem?

1050
01:56:22,892 --> 01:56:25,986
How to make the land more valuable
between the time you buy it...

1051
01:56:26,095 --> 01:56:27,619
...and the time you sell it?

1052
01:56:28,564 --> 01:56:30,429
Now this is California.

1053
01:56:31,134 --> 01:56:33,364
The richest, most populous state
in the Union.

1054
01:56:33,469 --> 01:56:35,596
I don't need a geography lesson from you.

1055
01:56:36,506 --> 01:56:40,067
Of course, you've been there.
I do forget, you get around, don't you?

1056
01:56:40,910 --> 01:56:41,877
Where was I?

1057
01:56:42,478 --> 01:56:44,139
- California.
- California, right.

1058
01:56:44,247 --> 01:56:46,841
The San Andreas Fault,
maybe you've heard of it?

1059
01:56:46,949 --> 01:56:49,247
Yes. It's the joining together
of two land masses.

1060
01:56:49,352 --> 01:56:53,015
The fault line is shifting, which is why
you get earthquakes in California.

1061
01:56:53,790 --> 01:56:56,122
Wonderful!
Couldn't have said it better myself.

1062
01:56:57,026 --> 01:57:01,224
Everything west of this line is the richest,
most expensive real estate in the world.

1063
01:57:01,397 --> 01:57:03,957
San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco.

1064
01:57:04,067 --> 01:57:05,967
Everything on this side of the line...

1065
01:57:06,102 --> 01:57:09,094
...is just hundreds of miles
of worthless desert land...

1066
01:57:09,238 --> 01:57:11,229
...which just happens to be owned by...

1067
01:57:11,607 --> 01:57:13,666
Lex Luthor Incorporated.

1068
01:57:15,011 --> 01:57:18,378
Now, call me foolish, call me irresponsible.

1069
01:57:19,415 --> 01:57:22,441
It occurs to me that a 500-megaton bomb...

1070
01:57:22,819 --> 01:57:25,253
...planted at just the proper point would...

1071
01:57:25,588 --> 01:57:27,783
Would destroy most of California.

1072
01:57:29,358 --> 01:57:33,021
Millions of people would be killed
and the West Coast as we know it would...

1073
01:57:33,129 --> 01:57:36,394
Fall into the sea. Bye-bye, California.

1074
01:57:37,533 --> 01:57:40,093
Hello, new West Coast. My West Coast.

1075
01:57:42,805 --> 01:57:44,432
Costa Del Lex, Luthorville.

1076
01:57:45,074 --> 01:57:46,541
Marina Del Lex, Otisburg.

1077
01:57:49,612 --> 01:57:50,840
"Otisburg"?

1078
01:57:51,047 --> 01:57:53,345
Miss Teschmacher,
she's got her own place.

1079
01:57:53,449 --> 01:57:54,347
"Otisburg"?

1080
01:57:54,684 --> 01:57:56,117
It's a little bitty place.

1081
01:57:56,319 --> 01:57:57,286
Otisburg?

1082
01:57:58,654 --> 01:58:00,918
I'll just wipe it off, that's all.

1083
01:58:01,090 --> 01:58:02,785
You're a dreamer, Lex Luthor.

1084
01:58:02,892 --> 01:58:05,861
A sick, twisted dreamer.
Your plan couldn't possibly work.

1085
01:58:06,529 --> 01:58:08,554
I'll admit there were a few problems.

1086
01:58:09,065 --> 01:58:11,625
Adjusting the precise trajectory
of the missile.

1087
01:58:12,168 --> 01:58:15,228
Finding the optimum stress point
for the fault line itself...

1088
01:58:16,205 --> 01:58:19,436
...which, by the way, is target zero.
Right...

1089
01:58:46,435 --> 01:58:47,493
That's impossible!

1090
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:52,501
What's happening, Lieutenant?

1091
01:58:52,642 --> 01:58:54,132
Trajectory malfunction, sir.

1092
01:58:58,414 --> 01:58:59,847
<i>All counter control units...</i>

1093
01:58:59,949 --> 01:59:02,008
<i>... remove vacuum pressure to maximum.</i>

1094
01:59:04,453 --> 01:59:05,750
Function negative, sir.

1095
01:59:05,855 --> 01:59:07,186
Can't you knock them down?

1096
01:59:07,290 --> 01:59:11,590
Absolutely impossible, sir. They have
the new P-20 low-level avoidance systems.

1097
01:59:11,694 --> 01:59:13,127
Get me the Pentagon.

1098
01:59:20,503 --> 01:59:23,063
What do you think, super baby?
Interesting?

1099
01:59:23,606 --> 01:59:25,699
Your theory’s quite impressive, Luthor.

1100
01:59:25,842 --> 01:59:28,072
Would you go to the viewing room, please?

1101
01:59:28,945 --> 01:59:31,778
But as for the rest,
it's nothing but a sick fantasy.

1102
01:59:33,182 --> 01:59:34,080
No.

1103
01:59:35,184 --> 01:59:37,482
It's history. It's happening, Superman.

1104
01:59:38,321 --> 01:59:39,913
Miss Teschmacher!

1105
01:59:44,727 --> 01:59:45,955
Yes, Lex?

1106
01:59:46,362 --> 01:59:47,727
Where's the rocket now?

1107
01:59:47,997 --> 01:59:51,626
It's going like a bat over the Grand Canyon,
so is the other one.

1108
01:59:51,767 --> 01:59:52,791
The other one?

1109
01:59:53,135 --> 01:59:54,466
There are two of them?

1110
01:59:57,573 --> 01:59:59,803
Yes, Superman, double jeopardy.

1111
02:00:00,543 --> 02:00:03,444
Even you, with your great speed,
couldn't stop both of them.

1112
02:00:03,713 --> 02:00:06,739
While I, on the other hand,
could stop them with my detonator.

1113
02:00:07,250 --> 02:00:09,013
All right, Luthor, where is it?

1114
02:00:09,752 --> 02:00:11,117
Where's the detonator?

1115
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:26,067
Diseased maniac!

1116
02:00:26,502 --> 02:00:29,471
Do you think you could hide it from me
by encasing it in lead?

1117
02:00:31,741 --> 02:00:34,107
I'll mold this box into your prison bars.

1118
02:00:34,210 --> 02:00:35,302
Don't touch that.

1119
02:00:42,184 --> 02:00:43,208
I told you.

1120
02:00:43,986 --> 02:00:45,214
It's Kryptonite.

1121
02:00:45,454 --> 02:00:47,388
A little souvenir from your hometown.

1122
02:00:47,924 --> 02:00:50,358
I've spared no expense
to make you feel at home.

1123
02:00:57,900 --> 02:00:59,390
You were great in your day.

1124
02:01:00,569 --> 02:01:02,366
But it just stands to reason...

1125
02:01:02,772 --> 02:01:04,933
...when it came time
to cash in your chips...

1126
02:01:05,441 --> 02:01:09,901
...this old diseased maniac
would be your banker.

1127
02:01:14,450 --> 02:01:15,508
Mind over muscle.

1128
02:01:24,126 --> 02:01:28,222
You don't even care
where the other missile's headed, do you?

1129
02:01:28,731 --> 02:01:29,857
Certainly I do.

1130
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:33,231
I know exactly where it's headed.

1131
02:01:33,402 --> 02:01:34,801
Hackensack, New Jersey.

1132
02:01:40,676 --> 02:01:45,045
I have to leave you now. No hard feelings.
We all have our little faults.

1133
02:01:45,848 --> 02:01:47,281
Mine's in California.

1134
02:02:02,198 --> 02:02:05,031
Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack.

1135
02:03:11,700 --> 02:03:13,429
Please, you can't...

1136
02:03:14,070 --> 02:03:15,697
...you can’t just stand there.

1137
02:03:19,275 --> 02:03:23,712
You can’t just stand
and let millions of innocent people die.

1138
02:03:27,349 --> 02:03:29,783
Please. Please, help me to save them.

1139
02:03:32,054 --> 02:03:34,522
Would you promise
to save my mother first?

1140
02:03:35,691 --> 02:03:37,625
But, Lois, and Jimmy...

1141
02:03:37,726 --> 02:03:39,353
But my mother comes first.

1142
02:03:39,462 --> 02:03:42,898
If you promise, I'll believe you
because you always tell the truth.

1143
02:03:45,334 --> 02:03:46,926
I promise, I promise.

1144
02:04:42,391 --> 02:04:43,824
Why did you kiss me first?

1145
02:04:46,829 --> 02:04:49,024
I didn't think you'd let me later.

1146
02:04:50,366 --> 02:04:51,833
Thank you, Miss Teschmacher.

1147
02:04:52,468 --> 02:04:55,494
Why is it I can't get it on
with the good guys?

1148
02:05:01,610 --> 02:05:04,204
Stand aside now.
I wouldn't stay here, either.

1149

<i>Next radar contact after three seconds.</i>

Army Bird still headed east, sir.

<i>Army Bird gaining altitude.</i>

1155
02:06:50,719 --> 02:06:52,186
Miss Teschmacher!

1156
02:06:52,488 --> 02:06:54,251
<i>Radar contact strong.</i>

1157
02:06:55,291 --> 02:06:56,588
Miss Teschmacher!

1158
02:06:56,959 --> 02:06:59,189
<i>Radar report Navy Bird. San Andreas area.</i>

What's going on?

1165
02:09:04,319 --> 02:09:05,513
It's a quake! Look!

1166
02:10:14,389 --> 02:10:16,050
Okay, kids, it's all right now.

1167
02:10:16,892 --> 02:10:18,325
Hey, it's Superman!

1168
02:10:26,935 --> 02:10:28,527
Holy mackerel!

1169
02:10:29,805 --> 02:10:31,238
We're going off the tracks.

1170

<i>All personnel evacuate dam.</i>

1171

Watch that cable!

1172
02:11:30,232 --> 02:11:31,893
Someone try and pull the main.

1173
02:11:32,267 --> 02:11:34,098
It's impossible. It's red hot!

1174
02:11:42,778 --> 02:11:44,075
Is that man all right?

1175
02:11:44,246 --> 02:11:45,178
Yeah.

1176
02:12:09,104 --> 02:12:10,036
Hang on, Jim.

1177
02:12:20,949 --> 02:12:22,075
The dam broke.

1178
02:12:30,192 --> 02:12:31,454
You're safe here, son.

1179
02:12:33,195 --> 02:12:35,789
That's okay. Miss Lane
will be driving by any minute.

1180
02:12:45,173 --> 02:12:46,800
- Come on!
- Make it to the hill.

1181
02:12:54,449 --> 02:12:57,384
<i>There has been major quake damage</i>
<i>to Southern California.</i>

<i>The San Andreas fault has miraculously</i>

<i>Yet Southern California is suffering</i>

Please, come on, turn over.

1186
02:13:40,295 --> 02:13:43,093
Help me. Help me, please.

1187
02:18:55,744 --> 02:18:57,769
<i>It is forbidden for you to interfere...</i>

1188
02:18:58,446 --> 02:19:02,405
<i>There's one thing I do know, Son,</i>
<i>and that is you are here for a reason.</i>

1189
02:19:04,019 --> 02:19:05,077
<i>It is forbidden.</i>

1190
02:19:05,186 --> 02:19:08,485
<i>All those things I can do,</i>
<i>all those powers...</i>

1191
02:19:09,057 --> 02:19:11,048
<i>... but I couldn't even save him.</i>

1192
02:19:15,030 --> 02:19:16,463
<i>It is forbidden.</i>

1193
02:20:44,719 --> 02:20:46,186
Don't bother, it's dead.

1194
02:20:48,456 --> 02:20:49,445
Sure it's dead.

1195
02:20:51,326 --> 02:20:54,762
The problem with men of steel is
they're never around when you want one.

1196
02:20:54,863 --> 02:20:57,559
Do you know what happened
while you were off flying around?

1197
02:20:57,665 --> 02:21:01,431
I was almost in an earthquake.
A gas station blew up beside my car.

1198
02:21:01,536 --> 02:21:05,404
Telephone poles falling all over the road.
I was almost killed.

1199
02:21:05,540 --> 02:21:08,532
To top the whole thing off,
this stupid car runs out of gas.

1200
02:21:08,877 --> 02:21:10,037
I'm sorry about that, Lois.

1201
02:21:10,745 --> 02:21:12,713
But I've been kind of busy for a while.

1202
02:21:15,650 --> 02:21:17,743
I'm sorry, that's all right.

1203
02:21:29,831 --> 02:21:31,128
Thanks a lot, Superman.

1204
02:21:31,499 --> 02:21:33,899
Put me in the middle of nowhere
during an earthquake.

1205
02:21:34,002 --> 02:21:37,665
No food, no water, snakes everywhere.
I had no idea if you were coming back.

1206
02:21:40,375 --> 02:21:43,003
There's something I have to do.
I'll see you later.

1207
02:21:45,880 --> 02:21:47,404
He can't stay still for a second.

1208
02:21:50,518 --> 02:21:54,045
Golly, Miss Lane, it's too bad
Mr. Kent wasn't here to see all this.

1209
02:21:54,155 --> 02:21:56,851
Yeah, poor Clark.
He's never around when...

1210
02:21:58,359 --> 02:22:00,350
Clark... Wait a minute.

1211
02:22:03,131 --> 02:22:05,065
Lois Lane, that is the silliest idea.

1212
02:22:05,567 --> 02:22:09,059
I'll tell you something, Miss Lane.
I think he really cares about you.

1213
02:22:09,404 --> 02:22:11,531
- Clark? Of course, he does.
- No, not Clark.

1214
02:22:15,944 --> 02:22:17,878
Superman cares about everybody, Jimmy.

1215
02:22:19,047 --> 02:22:22,414
<i>But who knows. Someday, if he's lucky...</i>

1216
02:22:35,830 --> 02:22:37,263
You're messing up my suit!

1217
02:22:41,703 --> 02:22:44,069
Otis! Watch the ground, you...

1218
02:22:45,106 --> 02:22:46,505
Good evening, Warden.

1219
02:22:46,608 --> 02:22:49,577
These two men should be safe here
'til they can get a fair trial.

1220
02:22:49,777 --> 02:22:51,005
Who is it, Superman?

1221
02:22:54,983 --> 02:22:57,577
- The greatest criminal mind of our time.
- Of our time.

1222
02:22:57,719 --> 02:22:59,983
- I hereby serve notice...
- He's serving notice to you.

1223
02:23:00,088 --> 02:23:01,646
...that these walls...

1224
02:23:02,023 --> 02:23:03,991
Will you shut up, you fat little fool!

1225
02:23:04,192 --> 02:23:05,386
You, you nitwit!

1226
02:23:05,693 --> 02:23:06,785
Nincompoop!

1227
02:23:07,262 --> 02:23:08,456
This country...

1228
02:23:08,563 --> 02:23:11,123
...is safe again, Superman, thanks to you.

1229
02:23:12,500 --> 02:23:13,797
Don't thank me, Warden.

1230
02:23:14,202 --> 02:23:15,965
We're all part of the same team.

1231
02:23:16,504 --> 02:23:17,471
Good night.
