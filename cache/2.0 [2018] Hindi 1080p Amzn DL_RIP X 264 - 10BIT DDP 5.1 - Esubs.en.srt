1
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,000
Your singing wakes the world.

2
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,080
Your colors adorn the sky.

3
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,720
You are the gift of God.

4
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,480
O', dear birds!

5
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,080
Greetings.

6
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,400
We have come from
Excel Engineering College.

7
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,000
The robotics research students.

8
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,520
We have an appointment
to meet Dr. Vaseegaran.

9
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,560
Please, come in.

10
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,320
Excuse me. You are...

11
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,920
I'm Dr. Vaseegaran's assistant.

12
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,440
Oh. Your name?

13
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,360
Nila.
- Beautiful!

14
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,440
Thanks.

15
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,400
Nila, blue...
- What?

16
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,600
You know, both the sky
and the water are blue.

17
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,200
So?
- Should I fly away or drown?

18
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,200
Can I have your number?

19
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,120
11423879.

20
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,120
Look what he's...

21
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,480
Stop licking your tongue
as if she's a piece of meat.

22
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,760
Hi!

23
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,320
Hello.
- Hello, sir.

24
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,600
Hello, sir.
- Hi, sir.

25
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,440
Please sit down.

26
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,800
Doctor, we are the students
of mechatronics.

27
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,600
Professor Mitra told us that
you've built a new humanoid robot.

28
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,080
Can we have a look at it?

29
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,040
Sure.

30
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,600
This is the robot I've built.

31
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,000
Project Nila.

32
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,480
Nice, Intelligent, Lovely Assistant.

33
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,920
Humanoid X12 2018 Model.

34
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,560
Quantum core millenia.
X12 5D Extreme Processor.

35
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,280
Unlimited cloud memory
at one terahertz speed.

36
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,000
Built-in simulated Amygdala.

37
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,200
This is Nila's MPU.
Memory and Power Unit.

38
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,680
It works just like a human heart.

39
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,960
Synthetic skin.

40
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,240
MPU... MPU...
- Ultra...

41
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,760
Should you fly away or drown?

42
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,160
Whoa!

43
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,400
What about the phone number?
- My IMEI number.

44
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,120
So, is this one also like Chitti?
- No.

45
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,760
It's a domestic purpose robot built
adhering to Asimov's Law.

46
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,720
Being a secretary, a friend,
or a caretaker,

47
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,720
it will serve people
in every way possible.

48
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,600
Does it have feelings, too?
- Of course.

49
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,640
Pre-programmed, customizable,
controlled feelings.

50
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,600
Will Chitti ever return, Doctor?

51
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,520
Every invention of science
was initially considered dangerous.

52
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,360
In the past, people
fiercely opposed it.

53
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,120
But in times of necessity,
they accepted them.

54
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,280
One day, people of this city
will need Chitti. Dot!

55
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,200
Hey, Nikita...
- Go to hell!

56
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,000
Flew away, then drowned!

57
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,120
Nikita, listen to me...

58
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,720
I was flirting with her
out of scientific curiosity.

59
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,200
It was obvious that
she was a robot.

60
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,080
'Shut up, liar!'

61
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,520
My Barbie!
My Snow White Princess!

62
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,800
'Hey, joker! Hang up!'

63
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,880
#GodSwear.

64
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,640
I will gift you an Apple Watch
for your birthday... Hey!

65
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,320
'Unknown calling'

66
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,920
'Unknown calling'

67
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,480
Sushma, Moksha has got
a new collection today.

68
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,800
Be back after lunch. Okay?

69
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,240
My flight has delayed.
Inform the clients.

70
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,400
I'll be there by...

71
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,400
After coming from office,
I sit and talk with my family.

72
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,040
We spend quality time, you know...

73
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,200
Hey, idiot!

74
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,000
Harith, give me the phone.

75
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,000
I have to make an important call.
Give me the phone.

76
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,400
What the... Here you go.

77
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,320
I haven't done anything!

78
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,000
If I can get 20 this month...

79
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,000
Make rice, lentils and potatoes
for dinner...

80
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,480
Grandpa?

81
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,080
Manu, I am telling you,
this is our Principal's conspiracy.

82
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,600
Hello, where are you?

83
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,880
Will you come to the terrace...
Mom!

84
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,280
What's wrong?

85
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,400
The project manager and that
'Papaya' girl has a special deal.

86
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,000
He promoted her and sent her
on-site... Hey, my phone!

87
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,800
He went to call the technician,
still no sign of him coming.

88
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,000
Tomorrow is "Mahavir Jayanti".
All shops will be closed.

89
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,520
Buy all the items by tonight.

90
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,520
It supports 4G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth
and also has dual SIM capacity.

91
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,360
I came to see girls,
but there are only boys here.

92
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,400
Danger, girlfriend calling.

93
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,080
Hi, Sana.

94
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,800
'Wow, sir. You managed
to answer my call today!'

95
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,600
Sorry, Sana.
- 'I called you so many times!'

96
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,000
'Why did you receive this call?
You are quite busy, right?'

97
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,280
'For your sake,
I've come 10,000 kilometers,'

98
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,800
'studying like a lunatic.'

99
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,000
'And under the pretext of a project,
you are flirting with Nila?'

100
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,840
She's just a toy, Sana.
- 'Toy?'

101
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,800
'But she's a doll, too.'
- Come on, honey.

102
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,880
'112 missed calls.'

103
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,760
What if I give 112 kisses
for the 112 missed calls?

104
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,960
'Forget 112,
just give one kiss properly.'

105
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,600
Mmm... Huh?

106
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,240
Flying kiss?

107
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,800
Sir, my phone is missing!
Where to file a complaint?

108
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,800
That is why there is this long queue!
Go and stand behind.

109
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,600
Cell phones flew away?
How is this possible?

110
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,080
Where did they go?
Who is behind this?

111
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,760
Is it a single person
or a whole gang?

112
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,920
I am scared.

113
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,400
This is a sign of
the world's destruction.

114
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,400
The hole in the sky
has turned into a black hole.

115
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,160
All our cell phones
are going up there.

116
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,240
What are you saying? Is there
a drainage system up there?

117
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,120
I work in the share market.
Without the cell phone, I'm gone.

118
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,520
Life seems meaningless
without WhatsApp and selfies.

119
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,080
I took my phone with me
when going to the bathroom.

120
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,680
Now I don't even feel any pressure.

121
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,480
He is in Kuwait now. Our relation
is maintained by the cell phone.

122
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,320
I saved my Mom's number.

123
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,280
Where will I get
her landline number now?

124
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,720
My bank account, ATM pin,
password, all are saved in it.

125
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,760
What should I do?

126
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,440
It has photos and videos of me
with my girlfriend.

127
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,600
What if someone puts them
on the Internet?

128
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,840
Excuse me, is there a separate
section for iPhones?

129
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,480
Yes, there is one beside
the mental hospital.

130
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,400
Go there.

131
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,120
Sir, it's a very special phone.

132
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,240
You want me to take this
as a complaint? Back off!

133
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,880
I tied my cell phone
to my wedding necklace.

134
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,520
That's too gone.
It was of pure gold.

135
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,000
No nagging of wife, no mobile bills
to pay, just relax.

136
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,960
Sir, someone has given a curse.

137
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,040
Let's start worshipping
to bring the phones back.

138
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,440
What nonsense!

139
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,200
The commissioner has called me.

140
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,200
Okay, sir, I'll look into it.
Thank you.

141
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,120
Sir, the Telecom Minister
is on the line.

142
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,400
Sir, even the Chief Minister
lost his phone.

143
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,640
Yes sir, your PA is right
in front of me. I'll see.

144
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,240
Sir, the Minister's phone...

145
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,360
Sir, it had diamonds
on its back.

146
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,280
0.25 caret, sir.
There were 526 stones.

147
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,160
Sir, it costed two crores.

148
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,040
Please, find it at any cost.

149
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,360
Understood.

150
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,160
Sir, he's the BSNL Chief
Technical Officer, Ramsubramaniam.

151
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,840
Please.

152
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,000
Did you find anything
via SIM card tracking?

153
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,640
Sir, not only BSNL,

154
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,560
even other networks are unable
to track their SIM cards.

155
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,840
All the cell phones are switched off.

156
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,120
All cell phones in the city
have gone missing.

157
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,160
How did all of them
get switched off?

158
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,000
How is it even possible?

159
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,600
'Greetings. Breaking News.'

160
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,120
'Cell phones fly and vanish.
People are going crazy.'

161
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,480
'Police department left helpless.'

162
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,800
'Specialists attend a meeting
with the Chief Secretary.'

163
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,280
So Doc, I think you know
the situation.

164
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,000
What is this?
What is this phenomenon?

165
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,840
This is strange.

166
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,280
I have studied all reports
from NASA and Interpol.

167
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,600
Such a thing has never been
recorded anywhere before.

168
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,200
Giving a scientific explanation
to it is impossible right now.

169
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,160
We can see it very clearly.
This is a terrorist attack.

170
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,200
They are planning something big.

171
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,120
This is our defense system, sir.

172
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,040
When something beyond understanding
takes place, we blame terrorists or God.

173
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,640
Could this be an alien invasion?

174
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,120
No, sir. I've read reports from ISRO.

175
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,320
No such alien movements or activities
have been detected in space.

176
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,680
An international company working
in this field may have a hand.

177
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,160
I mean, they want to destroy
our cell phone technology

178
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,680
and replace it with something new.

179
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,120
This is a public display.

180
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,520
As far as I know, there is
no technology in the world

181
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,400
that can make all cell phones
in the city fly away like birds.

182
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,840
Maybe... Someone here
once built a nonsense robot?

183
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:08,000
A crank scientist like him must be
doing this in the name of novelty.

184
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,000
Who is he?

185
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,440
He is the son of Bohra,
the former AIRD director,

186
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,640
Dhinendra Bohra.

187
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,880
Brilliant scientist.

188
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,440
He too is a director of AIRD.

189
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,960
This is a visualization of
the combined data

190
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,760
of INSAT 3D weather satellite
and GSAT-16 communication satellite

191
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,200
from the day the cell phones
disappeared.

192
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,120
These tiny dots are our cell phones.

193
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,280
After coming a particular distance,
they suddenly disappear altogether.

194
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,680
The cell phones did not cross
the troposphere,

195
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,320
which means they are within
10 kilometers from sea level.

196
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,120
They haven't crossed a radius
of 200 kilometers from Chennai.

197
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,440
All the cell phones are
within these boundaries.

198
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,280
We know of only four forces.

199
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,320
Gravity, electromagnetic, strong nuclear
and weak nuclear.

200
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,320
None of these can attract
only cell phones.

201
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,320
I believe, this can be explained
scientifically.

202
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,240
Dot.

203
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,680
All phones broke the glass
and flew away. - Really?

204
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,640
When will the container lorry arrive?

205
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,080
'It has crossed Nagari.'

206
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,240
You scoundrels! You haven't crossed
the Andhra borders yet?

207
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,120
Hello! I've already made an announcement
of sales here.

208
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,400
There isn't a single cell phone
in the city.

209
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,640
The queue to buy cell phones

210
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,280
is as long as that of the devotees
seen in front of Tirupatti temple.

211
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,040
'I know, sir. It will arrive
before 4 AM.'

212
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,400
I was promised a delivery
by this evening.

213
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,080
'Welcome To Tamil Nadu'

214
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,640
Brother, what is this sound
coming from behind?

215
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,280
Nowadays, songs sound like this.

216
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,800
Brother?

217
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,000
Brother, someone is banging the
container with an hammer from inside.

218
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,080
What are you saying?
There are only cell phones inside!

219
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,280
Call me when the container arrives.

220
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,160
Sure, sir.

221
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,760
Will police protection be here
tomorrow?

222
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,720
I have paid the money, sir.

223
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,240
They'll be here tomorrow morning.
- Okay.

224
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,400
But sir, what if the new cell phones
too fly away like this?

225
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,920
Then understand we are in
for a nightmare.

226
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,560
Not only you and me,
all of us.

227
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,160
Hail Lord Hanuman!
Please protect me.

228
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,920
Hey, what is this sound?

229
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,240
'Sir, the container has arrived.'

230
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,000
Who is this speaking?

231
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,480
'This is Mohan, sir. You told me
to call when the container arrives.'

232
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,440
'It has arrived.'

233
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,800
Where is it?
- 'In your house, sir.'

234
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,160
Sir, please give us more details.
- Please, move back and give way.

235
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,880
Hello, sir.
- Commissioner Rajendranath called me.

236
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,800
Please come in.

237
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,640
There are no traces of any human
presence in Jayanth Kumar's murder.

238
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,600
But he's a wholesaler of cell phones.
Maybe that's our clue.

239
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,640
His family is out of town.
He was alone at home.

240
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,960
We didn't find anything
about any domestic help.

241
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,800
There isn't a single fingerprint
or footprint.

242
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
He exploded into pieces.

243
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,320
But no traces of explosives either.

244
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,680
A sale of mobile phones was
to be delivered to his showroom.

245
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,480
The container lorry met
with an accident last night.

246
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,720
All cell phones disappeared
from inside.

247
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,440
We are clueless, sir.

248
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,720
Someone is having problem
with cell phones.

249
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,400
This contains silicon, enamel
and polycarbonate dust

250
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,080
from a lot of cell phones.

251
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,520
They were manufactured by different
brands on different dates.

252
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,520
What if I say Jayanth Kumar
was murdered by cell phones?

253
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,520
Cell phones murdered him?

254
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
What are you saying, sir?

255
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,120
So, what were the cell phones
doing here?

256
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,280
Where they came from
and where they went,

257
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,840
that's what I need to find out.

258
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:39,960
Dot.

259
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,000
'Wow, sir! What a miracle!
You managed to call me today!'

260
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,640
Sana, it's a long story, this is
the only cell phone in the city.

261
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,600
To find out where all the cell phones
are going, I've fixed a tracker in it.

262
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,080
'So I am the lab-rat of your experiment?'

263
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,360
It's not about that.

264
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,800
That day, the phone flew out
of my hand when giving the kiss.

265
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,600
So I thought I'd do it today.

266
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,560
'You remembered it three days later?
Why?'

267
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,360
'What happened to your landline?
Couldn't you use that to call me?'

268
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,080
The landline was busy, Sana.

269
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,960
'Don't lie. Just admit
you forgot my number.'

270
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,400
'Out of sight, out of mind!'

271
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,920
'Nila is everything for you now, right?'

272
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,320
Hey, she's just like a laptop.

273
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,000
"Oh, I'm a laptop!"

274
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,720
'Now she's singing you a song?'

275
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,120
Shut up!
- 'Shut up?'

276
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,720
Now I'm telling you the truth,
and you're telling me to shut up?

277
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,400
Sana, this phone may fly away anytime.

278
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,800
Kai Po Che!

279
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,960
Hey! No more films for you.

280
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,280
Nila, activate EMR.

281
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,320
'Activating EMR'

282
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,320
What are they doing?

283
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,040
Are they trying to locate
a bomb or something?

284
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,200
You search that side.
- Okay, boss.

285
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,000
Thanks, Nila.
- Why thank a laptop?

286
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,200
I was supposed to submit this
by 7 o'clock.

287
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,360
Sir, the Minister is already
discussing this issue.

288
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,560
Sir, Onicell owner Manoj Lulla
has come.

289
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,560
Oh, dear. He will create
a problem.

290
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,800
Greetings, sir. Come.

291
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,800
Is he inside?
- Yes, sir. Come, sir.

292
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,520
2G!

293
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,400
Okay, you find it out. Oh!

294
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,480
Come, sit.

295
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,440
Drop the formality.
What are you doing?

296
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,920
Is there a government or not?

297
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,240
Look, Mr. Lulla.
Just as God is, so are we.

298
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,920
If you believe we exist, we do.
If you don't, we don't.

299
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,360
But you are everywhere
while collecting money.

300
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,440
There isn't a single
cell phone tower of mine.

301
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,680
It has uprooted all of them.
Destroyed the microwave emitters.

302
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,320
This isn't only your problem.

303
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,000
All towers and microwave emitters
in the city have been destroyed.

304
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,240
All the other vendors
are facing this problem.

305
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,920
They too are scratching their heads
like you.

306
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,120
What are you saying?

307
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,760
My loss runs in millions.

308
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,280
If this continues, I'll be soon
begging in the streets.

309
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,760
We will check all your sites first.

310
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,680
That won't be enough.

311
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,120
We've given a lot of money
for you and your party.

312
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,720
If necessary, you'll have
to become a tower.

313
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,720
Don't worry.

314
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,640
Everyone's in the same situation.

315
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,160
Nothing like this happened before.

316
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,080
We don't know how we will
manage all this.

317
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,840
We've asked the Cabinet
for military help.

318
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,120
We will send the army
to protect the towers.

319
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,800
You can't fool me like you fool
the public.

320
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,800
I am giving you one week.

321
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,000
Everything should be fixed by then.

322
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,080
I must restart my business.

323
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,720
Otherwise, the next upload
in WikiLeaks will be yours!

324
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,440
'Fifth force.'

325
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,280
Science is researching
on this fifth force.

326
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,440
We don't know about its properties
and how to measure it.

327
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,920
Maybe this fifth force
is attracting the cell phones.

328
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,200
But with today's technology,
we cannot study it.

329
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,520
And we don't have the power
to control it.

330
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,040
That's why we've asked
for military help.

331
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,840
Sir, it's a huge force.

332
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,480
I've seen it with my own eyes.

333
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,520
If we bring in the military
to deal with this,

334
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,600
there will be an enormous
loss of life.

335
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,920
So what should we do?

336
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,640
To fight against it,
we need a superpower.

337
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,240
With exceptional intelligence
and extraordinary strength.

338
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,160
Who cannot be killed.

339
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,640
One who won't die...

340
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,760
Is there anyone like that?

341
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,200
Chitti. The robot.

342
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,400
We need to get it from
the museum. Dot.

343
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,200
I'm waiting.

344
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,360
No! Impossible!

345
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,600
It's illegal!

346
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,840
That robot has been banned.

347
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,600
It has been dismantled.

348
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,920
Has everyone forgotten
how it went out of control?

349
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,800
Many people lost their lives,
many properties were damaged.

350
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,160
If we bring it back,
it won't die,

351
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,000
but it will finish us all.

352
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,520
We also know for whom
that robot had changed.

353
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,400
That mistake won't be repeated.
It's my responsibility.

354
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,720
Sir, this is all a conspiracy
of Vaseegaran.

355
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,920
He is using this critical situation
for his own advantage.

356
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,320
He wants to market his killer robot
to multinational companies.

357
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,400
Now you decide, are we here
to find a way to save the city,

358
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,760
or for Vaseegaran's advertisement?

359
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,640
Okay, then you give us
a solution.

360
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,640
We will think about it.

361
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,080
Th-That's why we are here.

362
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,120
Sir, we are in grave danger.

363
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,000
This is just the beginning.
We don't know what happens next.

364
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,240
We have no option other than Chitti.

365
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:54,200
Mr. Vaseegaran, we can't act
against the court's order.

366
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,800
The process is very long.

367
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,800
An ordinance must be passed
in the Parliament,

368
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,920
the opposition parties
should cooperate.

369
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,280
Not possible.
- It's possible, sir.

370
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,120
Has any minister seen
this kind of situation?

371
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,760
We will convince the court
why we took this step.

372
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,640
Such a rule exists.

373
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,800
What if the robot kills someone?

374
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:18,400
Who will shoulder the responsibility?
Me? Or the minister?

375
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,800
It won't happen, sir.

376
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,080
Why not?

377
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,360
It is a machine.

378
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,720
Can you guarantee that
it won't lose control?

379
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,760
If it creates a mess,
the blame will be on me.

380
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,320
Let's forget Chitti.

381
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,640
Suggest some other option.

382
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,320
The military is the only way, sir.

383
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,600
That's right.

384
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,400
Release the request and order today.
Do the needful.

385
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,080
Hello.

386
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,920
So, plan collapsed?

387
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,720
Dhina, what is all this?

388
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,080
You know how science works.
What is all this for?

389
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,200
I know.

390
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,880
But I won't spare you.

391
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,600
I won't let you bring that Chitti back.

392
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,440
Why are you so mad at me?

393
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,800
You murdered my father.

394
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,680
Me?

395
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,520
Chitti is your alter-ego.

396
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,960
That is also you.

397
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,800
Murderer!

398
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,240
'Hey, Lulla!'

399
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,360
'This is the minister speaking.
I have erected all your towers.'

400
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,000
'Have you seen on the road?'

401
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,120
'All phones in the city
have started working again.'

402
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,880
'Go, restart your business.'

403
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,360
Where are you speaking from?

404
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,560
'From here.'

405
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,560
Nila, go.

406
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,200
Hack it open, Nila.

407
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,440
Boss, if I hack this,
won't I be breaking the rules?

408
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,960
This is an ethical hacking.
An exception. Now do what I say.

409
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,320
Absolutely, boss.

410
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,760
A lie that benefits someone
is not called a lie.

411
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,160
Hey, where are you learning
all this from?

412
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,120
For me to understand people,

413
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,880
you've embedded virtual emotions
and adaptive programming in me.

414
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,480
Basically, people have interest
in four topics.

415
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,400
TV, cinema, food,
gossip. Easy!

416
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,000
"My eyes met your eyes."

417
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,520
"A new desire blossomed in my heart."

418
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,120
"My eyes met your eyes."

419
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,360
"A new desire blossomed in my heart."

420
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,760
Shut up!

421
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,360
'Leaving from airport.
Battalion 121 proceeding to spot.'

422
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,680
The whole state is right now
under military control.

423
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,960
There's nothing to panic.

424
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,320
Everywhere, technology related
to cell phone network

425
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,400
is being attended to
on a war-front emergency basis.

426
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,360
With military protection in place,
we are taking necessary steps

427
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,840
to restart the sales of cell phones.

428
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,560
Soon, people can start using
cell phones like before.

429
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,800
Balu.
- Yes, sir?

430
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,280
Ask for military protection
for us first.

431
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,600
Sir, there are four police vans
outside.

432
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,640
The sight of the rifles they have
won't scare even street dogs.

433
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,440
We need AK-47.

434
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,520
Manoj Lulla was hale and hearty
until yesterday.

435
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,560
When he got killed last night,
we didn't even find his body.

436
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,000
Who signed the order to restart
cell phone services immediately?

437
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,480
Oh, God, no.

438
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,400
I don't want to be found dead
like a chewed-out mango.

439
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,120
Go and call the military
immediately.

440
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,720
Juice for you, dear.

441
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,320
Are they on position?
- Yes, sir. We've assigned two men.

442
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,120
Enough security at the main gate?
- Yes, sir.

443
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,360
'Attack in Porur,
company on high alert.'

444
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,640
'Attack in Porur,
company on high alert.'

445
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,640
Sir!

446
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,560
Sir!

447
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,160
Sir! Sir!
- What happened now?

448
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,360
The cell phone gang has uprooted
the tower in Porur.

449
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,080
They wiped out
the entire battalion there.

450
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,320
No one knows where
they will go next.

451
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,440
They've reached Porur too?
- Yes.

452
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,160
Tell them to double
our protection.

453
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,920
All companies are on high alert.

454
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,880
Close all gates and doors.

455
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,520
Shut all the windows too.
Don't keep a tiny hole open.

456
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,520
Sir, everything's been closed,
even the computer's Windows too!

457
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,960
They are pelting stones at us!

458
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,200
Sir, it's not a stone,
it's a cell phone!

459
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,160
Your missing cell phone.
Come and see.

460
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,480
All the stones are still intact!

461
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,440
I am a Minister.

462
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,000
Technology is in my hands.

463
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:42,280
That's why they got scared
and returned my phone to me.

464
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,200
Who is this "Unnikrishnan" calling?

465
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,800
It's an unknown number.

466
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,640
Go and tell the military
to shoot this sparrow.

467
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,040
Hey, get out!

468
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,200
'Alpha come in. Alpha.
Jupiter is reaching.'

469
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,800
Sir, this way please.

470
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,080
How is Vairamoorthy?
- Critical, sir.

471
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,400
He is unable to breath.

472
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,200
Something is stuck in his windpipe.
- What?

473
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,080
What is it?
- No idea at all, sir.

474
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,000
His PA is also not
in a state to speak.

475
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,920
Did you scan his body?
- We did it first, sir.

476
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
All reports are clear and normal.

477
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,280
Yet he is unable to breath.

478
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,280
What happened, Doctor?

479
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,480
He's no more.

480
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,480
What?

481
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,360
Phone... Give me a phone!

482
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,280
Sir, the phone flew away
in front of you.

483
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,640
Landline, man!

484
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,000
Hello? - I am the Home Minister
Vijay Kumar speaking.

485
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,600
Activate that robot Chitti
immediately.

486
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,360
Today! Right now!

487
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,200
How can you say that
as if it is very easy?

488
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,160
What will you tell the court, sir?

489
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,840
I can't break the law like this.

490
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,960
I will handle all of that!
First get Chitti ready!

491
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,760
How can it be done so quickly?

492
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,040
You need to pass an ordinance
in the Parliament.

493
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,200
The opposition parties
need to cooperate.

494
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,040
The process is very complicated.

495
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,520
There are 40 MPs in the Parliament.
I'll deal with them.

496
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,240
It's a machine, sir. What if
it breaks something or kills someone?

497
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,760
Who will shoulder the responsibility?
You? Or me?

498
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,720
Hey! It is not the right time
to get back at me.

499
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,160
The phone flew into
our Telecom Minister's mouth.

500
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,240
What if it enters my body
through another orifice?

501
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,120
I will shoulder the responsibility.

502
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,520
Dot!

503
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,840
I came here at 5 o'clock.

504
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,640
At least 30 people were
already here.

505
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,560
I haven't even got the phone yet,
And they're telling me to recharge.

506
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,240
Losing the cell phone felt like
losing so many pages from my life.

507
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,600
Oh! So what if the cell phone
flies away like a bird again?

508
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,760
I am very sharp, bro!

509
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,360
How will it go off?

510
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:27,600
What is this?
A leash for your mobile phone?

511
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,800
Brother, without a cell phone,
I spent the last few days better.

512
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,080
No annoying ringtones...
I could see the world properly.

513
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,880
I could talk to my children.
I could meet my friends.

514
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,120
It felt so good.
- Then why are you here?

515
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,120
What should I do?
Cell phones are like wives.

516
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,200
Trouble if you have them,
trouble if you don't.

517
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,280
Yes!

518
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,280
Chitti, you're back!

519
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,240
I was falling so fast,
I felt like I would die.

520
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,400
Thank you, Chitti.

521
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,280
Holy crow!

522
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,720
Chitti to control.
- 'Control to Chitti.'

523
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,080
Assemble at TTK road junction.

524
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,840
What place is this?

525
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,560
Integral Space Research Centre.

526
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,760
This space research centre
is not currently active.

527
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,560
No research is conducted there.

528
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,720
Two technicians stay there,
just for show.

529
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,800
In 1964, the leader of
the atomic commission, Dr. Homi Bhaba

530
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,320
inaugurated this research center.

531
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,640
Call Dr. Sam.

532
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,640
Hello, Sam here.

533
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,000
Dr. Sam, it's Vasee.

534
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,280
I need an information now.
Urgent.

535
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,000
About the space center
at Sector 2, Phase 14.

536
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,200
Vasee, keep this confidential.

537
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:27,080
Does intelligent life exist
on any other planet besides ours?

538
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,800
To find the answer,
we transmit signals into space

539
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,400
from different points
of the world.

540
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,760
Our signals are sent from there.

541
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,200
What is the frequency mode
of the signal?

542
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:42,160
There is a probability that
an evil force may receive the signal.

543
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,600
So, we are transmitting
positive signals

544
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,200
from our side.

545
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:52,400
We have generated
such a frequency for the signals

546
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,600
that only positive forces
can receive.

547
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,240
Thank you very much, Sam.

548
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:59,120
Chitti, play the visual
in Kirlian mode.

549
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,320
Look at that! The cell phones
are trying to avoid

550
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,360
the positive signals
from the emitters.

551
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,000
Because a negative force
is controlling the phones.

552
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,600
Negative force?
You mean, from another planet?

553
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,960
Freeze it!

554
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,360
No. This negative force
originated on this land.

555
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,920
That's a human face!

556
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,280
I have seen this face somewhere.

557
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:39,240
Nila, give me reports of
all recent abnormal events,

558
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,840
especially deaths,
that took place there. ASAP!

559
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:48,320
Doctor, these look like
the emitters at the space center.

560
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,320
Exactly.
- Why are you making this?

561
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,800
You know very well.
You tell us why.

562
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,920
Maybe the negative force controlling
the cell phones belong to a human,

563
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,880
which does not have a body.

564
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,600
It is made of the aura
that surrounds the body.

565
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:01,880
What is aura?

566
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,560
Every cell of the human body
is made of protons and electrons.

567
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:10,960
The waves they emit, known as
micro photons, make up the aura.

568
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,680
It is attached to the body
like a thin layer.

569
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,680
When alive, the aura of a person
is positively charged.

570
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,920
When a person dies, his aura
becomes negatively charged.

571
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,920
We need to destroy
the negative charge.

572
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,960
One way to do this is to send
more powerful positive charge

573
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,200
toward it and neutralize it.

574
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,680
After death, the aura consists
of micro photon minus.

575
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,120
We will release micro photon plus.

576
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,520
The sum of plus and minus
is zero.

577
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:37,800
Am I right, Doctor?

578
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,360
Exactly, Chitti.

579
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,440
This is a photon synthesizer.
It will generate micro photon plus.

580
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:44,560
See?

581
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:51,400
I've put the positive waves
the space center emitted in it,

582
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,760
which is ten times stronger than
the negative energy of a human body.

583
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,560
We will use this device and completely
neutralize that negative energy.

584
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,600
Wow! Great.
- Boss, I have the details ready.

585
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:06,080
73 people have died in that area
in the last year.

586
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:10,040
17 unnatural deaths, 13 murders
and 4 suicides have been reported.

587
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,400
Does any of these cases have
any connection to cell phones?

588
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,520
One died in an accident while talking
on the phone while driving a lorry.

589
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:22,000
A girl drank poison because
her private photos got leaked.

590
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,320
One hanged himself from a cell tower.

591
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,760
Date?
- April 7th.

592
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,480
The cell phones started disappearing
from the next day.

593
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,840
Oh, my God.
I understand everything now.

594
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,480
Chitti, install this
on the AIRD bus immediately.

595
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,000
We are going there.

596
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,720
Doctor, we got it.
All the phones are here.

597
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,040
'Nila, bring the bus
behind the house.'

598
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,200
Chitti!

599
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,800
Nila, fix the cryostat.
Quick!

600
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,160
My God.

601
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,160
It's Pakshirajan!

602
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:47,800
Nice DP.

603
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:02,160
This war is between
me and mankind.

604
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:06,400
You are not a human being.
So don't interfere.

605
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,080
Run away!

606
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,000
The command "run away"
is not in my programming.

607
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,680
I may not be a human, but I have
been reactivated to save humans.

608
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,720
To eliminate you is
my primary task.

609
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:26,320
Pakshirajan, why are you
so upset on mankind?

610
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,360
Why are you doing all this?

611
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,480
What do you want?

612
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,760
This is the Pied Cuckoo.

613
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,400
Its biological name
is Jacobin Cuckoo.

614
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:57,600
It is said that monsoon comes in
North India after this bird arrives.

615
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,160
If it does not come,

616
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,600
it does not rain that year.

617
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:07,680
Why? It's a mystery,
nobody knows why.

618
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:12,440
In old text books, it is
called the "Varsha Pakshi".

619
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,160
Why don't you research on this?

620
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:16,280
Sure, sir.

621
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:19,520
Wow! Sir, your photograph
is on the cover page.

622
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,640
Yes, it came about a year ago.

623
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,200
Sir, how did you get interested
in birds?

624
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:31,080
To tell the truth,
birds were interested in me.

625
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:34,520
'When I was born,
I couldn't breath.'

626
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,800
'My body turned blue.'

627
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,040
'The doctors had given up.'

628
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,680
We tried our best,
but we couldn't save him.

629
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:44,520
Let's complete the formalities
and prepare the death certificate...

630
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,000
'Maybe it was a coincidence,'

631
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,920
'but everyone said
it was a miracle.'

632
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:43,320
'My grandmother firmly believed
that God Himself had come'

633
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,000
'in the form of a sparrow
to give me life.'

634
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:51,240
'I still remember
when I was a child,'

635
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,920
'a sparrow used to enter
my room through the window'

636
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,640
'and fly around.'

637
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:04,720
"The morning rays come to me
through your eyes."

638
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:10,720
"As the world ends the day,
your chirps put it to rest."

639
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:16,800
"As if an artist is drawing
on the giant canvas of the sky."

640
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:23,320
"Teach me how to fly,
otherwise I have no friends."

641
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,560
"O', tiny little being!"

642
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,920
"May you sing your songs forever."

643
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:34,080
'That's when I decided to dedicate
my life only to birds.'

644
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:07,040
"O', tiny little being!"

645
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:11,880
"May you sing your songs forever."

646
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:19,560
"O', lovely little birdie!"

647
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:24,920
"This is my only prayer to God."

648
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,720
"No limits in the world,
no borders in the world,"

649
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,320
"you make no divisions,
O' innocent little bird!"

650
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:53,400
"Your sky is limitless without
borders and boundaries."

651
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:59,800
"Every leaf of every branch is yours."

652
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:05,680
"You adore the entire world
with your mellifluous voice."

653
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:10,880
"My heart wants to go with you,
O' dear birds!"

654
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:17,440
"My heart wants to fly with you,
O' dear birds!"

655
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:24,160
"Take me on your wings,"

656
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,760
"then let's fly away..."

657
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:31,040
"Let's fly away from this land..."

658
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:37,160
So I studied ornithology and became
a professor of ornithology.

659
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,640
"Pon ulagaleero,"

660
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:45,680
"bhuvanam muzhudhaleero,
nannaya pullinangal."

661
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:49,480
This is an ancient Tamil song.

662
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:54,800
It means,
"O' birds, you are all over this world."

663
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,320
"You have spread your wings
right up to heaven."

664
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:00,040
"Our earth and our skies
abound in these birds."

665
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,720
The total weight of all the birds
in the world

666
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,760
is 100 times the weight of
all the human beings.

667
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:11,600
Birds eat a thousand times more
than humans do.

668
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,800
If they didn't eat insects,

669
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:17,720
there wouldn't be a single leaf
anywhere.

670
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,400
There will be no food for us.

671
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:25,160
Because the number insects is
100 times the number of birds.

672
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,000
If humans must survive,

673
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,600
then it is important
for birds to survive.

674
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,040
Sir, the number of birds that
come to Vedanthangal every year

675
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,000
is decreasing.
What is the reason, sir?

676
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:42,680
When we were children, we would
wake up to the chirping of sparrows.

677
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:46,040
Nowadays, there are no traces
of sparrows in the city.

678
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:55,280
Cell phones were introduced in India
in 1996.

679
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:59,160
Since then, the number of birds
has dwindled.

680
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,440
Especially sparrows.

681
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,800
This is called the Arctic Tern.

682
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:10,280
This small bird weighs only 50 grams.

683
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:14,720
Every year, it flies 12,000 kilometers
and comes to Vedanthangal,

684
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,920
then goes back after a while.

685
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:20,040
It does not have a map
or a radar.

686
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:25,120
Its brain can read the waves in
the sky using cryptochrome formation,

687
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,000
leading it to the right direction.

688
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:31,280
This is the bird's speciality.

689
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:39,000
Now we have filled the skies with
the radiation from cell phone towers.

690
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:43,000
For this, the cryptochrome formation
in the birds' brains

691
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:46,200
is slowly getting destroyed.

692
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,520
They get lost.

693
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:52,480
And they are going extinct.

694
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,000
Because of this radiation,

695
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:01,800
the eggs of birds become flaccid,
weak and soft, lacking a shell.

696
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:05,840
When the bird sits down to warm
the eggs, they break.

697
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:09,400
To tell the truth, even men too
suffer from such problems.

698
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,520
We may be diagnosed with cancer,

699
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:16,560
concentration may be reduced,
abortions may increase.

700
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:21,200
Moreover, there is depression,
schizophrenia, Alzheimer...

701
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,560
Mental diseases like these
are on the rise.

702
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:30,200
All the symptoms
are now clearly visible.

703
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:34,080
Mr. Pakshirajan,
tell us what the solution is.

704
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,400
What do we use cell phones
mostly for?

705
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,880
To chat and gossip.

706
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,840
We can control that.

707
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,400
Why so many cell phones?
Why so many towers?

708
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:44,880
We will reduce them.

709
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,000
There should be a law about
who uses cell phones, for what,

710
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,040
and for how long.

711
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,000
He seems to have lost it.

712
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,960
Instead of today's high frequency
technology,

713
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,440
we will make a different technology.
- Hello?

714
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,760
Until then, 90 percent
of the cell phone towers

715
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,200
in our country will
remain shut down.

716
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,440
Good idea.

717
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:08,600
Sir, please excuse me.
Sir, since morning I haven't...

718
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,320
Save birds, save earth!
- 'Save birds, save earth!'

719
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:20,760
Don't kill, don't kill!
- 'Don't kill birds!'

720
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:24,040
Save birds, save birds!
- 'Save birds, save birds!'

721
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:27,400
Don't kill, don't kill!
- 'Don't kill birds!'

722
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:30,120
'Stop, stop!
- Radiation, pollution!'

723
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,400
'Save birds, save earth!'

724
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:38,400
Don't they have any other work?

725
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:43,360
As soon as the sun rises, they start
holding placards defending animals.

726
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:44,760
Why don't you crack down on them?

727
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,320
I asked them to leave, sir.

728
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,400
But they said they won't leave
without meeting you.

729
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:54,840
Tell me...

730
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,920
What's your problem?

731
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,360
What is the frequency rate
allowed by TRAI?

732
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:05,240
And what is the frequency rate
on your towers?

733
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:08,320
You are endangering the birds
flying in the sky...

734
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,880
Hello, hello, mister, listen.

735
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:13,320
We are strictly following
the regulations of TRAI.

736
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,840
Subscribers often complain,
"No signal in bathroom",

737
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,440
"No Skype in the lift",
"No connectivity in the basement"...

738
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:21,800
Do you know, in the last 3 months
2000 subscribers switched networks.

739
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:24,040
Do you know that?
- Don't lie.

740
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:28,640
To retain your subscribers in this
disgusting competition of yours,

741
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:32,000
you flout the rules.

742
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:35,320
Now you have gone well
above the limit.

743
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:40,920
Due to this radiation, an entire species
of birds is going extinct.

744
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,320
Are you aware of this?

745
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:44,400
You are exaggerating.

746
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,520
There is no scientific proof

747
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,480
that birds die due to
cell phone radiation.

748
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,720
You know that?

749
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,120
Alright.

750
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:57,600
Go and stand for 24 hours
under one of your towers.

751
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:59,200
My point will be proven.

752
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,200
You get out.

753
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,320
You wanted scientific proof,

754
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:04,760
I am willing to give it to you.

755
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:05,920
Get lost.

756
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,520
Write a letter to the media,

757
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:09,520
or protest holding placards
in the scorching sun.

758
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,680
I don't care. Out.

759
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:14,040
But...
- Get out!

760
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,520
Nonsense.

761
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:36,640
Stop!

762
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,280
What are you doing?

763
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:41,160
Stop all of this! There are
houses around here.

764
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,200
Birds too come here.

765
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,280
Stop all of this!

766
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,920
Hey old man! We are not building
an atomic center here.

767
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,720
We are just building
a cell phone tower.

768
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:50,000
Now you will get
better connectivity.

769
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,480
Now move, go away!

770
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:52,400
What happened?

771
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:56,200
Ramaswamy, I have told you many times
how so many birds are dying.

772
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:57,560
You too felt bad about it.

773
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:59,400
But what is this?
- What do I do?

774
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,360
Agriculture is no longer
profitable.

775
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,000
Insects have destroyed my crops.

776
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:05,040
Buying insecticides,
I have become a pauper.

777
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,600
The reason for that too
is the death of birds.

778
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,200
Birds eat insects.

779
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,280
The less birds there are,

780
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,280
the more insects there will be.

781
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:15,400
Maybe you are right.

782
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:17,320
But I don't have the strength
to be a farmer anymore.

783
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:20,040
This is the only way
I can earn using this land.

784
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,320
So should you sell your land
to someone who kills birds?

785
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,480
People here are dying from hunger,
and you are worried about birds?

786
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:31,400
Go, stop pestering me.
- Move it, move!

787
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,400
'Ladies and gentlemen,'

788
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,200
'stop using cell phones!'

789
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:41,120
Each of the cell phones
you are using right now

790
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,720
is encased with the blood
of thousands of birds!

791
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,360
Every cell phone is a bird's coffin!

792
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:48,120
'Save birds...'

793
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,320
Come here.

794
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:54,000
Who is that man,
pestering our customers?

795
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,360
Take him away from here.
- Okay, sir.

796
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,280
Hey...

797
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,440
Stop using cell phones!

798
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,720
Take these...

799
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:10,120
Let me go!

800
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,120
Sir, I've filed many petitions
in all levels.

801
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,560
But no one took any action.

802
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:40,120
Oh! This is why we don't see
sparrows nowadays.

803
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:46,720
When I was a little child,
there were so many sparrows.

804
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,640
I used to play with them.

805
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,520
And when I grew up,

806
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,480
I caught and ate them.

807
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:55,920
So tasty!

808
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:01,400
And the medicine made from them...

809
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,400
Very tasty!

810
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:09,720
Now we don't see much around...

811
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,080
What's this, sir?

812
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:14,600
I'm talking about saving them,
and you're talking about eating them!

813
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:15,960
So should I mourn them?

814
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:18,560
Let's start a welfare center
for birds.

815
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,400
I'll put you in charge of it.

816
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:24,160
First, take action against
all network companies

817
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:27,400
using frequency rate
more than necessary.

818
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,880
Cancel their licenses.

819
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:32,160
Then?

820
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:37,200
Allow only two networks to operate
following regulation rules strictly.

821
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,400
Nonsense!

822
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:41,480
India is a country
of 1.25 billion.

823
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:43,120
We need to reach so many people.

824
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,920
Shouldn't all areas receive
signal properly?

825
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,160
At present, cell phones are
the driving force of life.

826
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:50,520
Without them, the whole world
will come to a standstill.

827
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:53,920
Cell phones save our time.
They increase efficiency.

828
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,200
People will lose jobs.

829
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:58,680
A hungry person cannot
amputate his hand and eat it.

830
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:03,000
This is the kind of progress
we make by killing birds.

831
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:07,480
If even a tiny sparrow
cannot live because of us,

832
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:10,720
what kind of development
and technology is this?

833
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,400
America is many times
bigger than India.

834
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:17,080
There are only four
or five networks.

835
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,320
China is the most populous country
in the world.

836
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:23,680
There are only three networks.
And here?

837
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,240
Ten!

838
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:30,360
By taking bribes, you give them
permission to operate.

839
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,640
Mind your tongue!

840
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,640
You look well-educated
and well-mannered,

841
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,320
so I have kept quiet.

842
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:39,360
And you start blaming me?

843
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:42,560
Then listen, everything is going
according to the framework.

844
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:47,160
We are allowing cell phone service
following the state's rules.

845
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:50,480
Go and file a case in the court
if you want. Get lost!

846
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,840
Sir, don't be angry.
Please listen to me.

847
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:55,000
How much more will you make us listen?
Go, go to the court!

848
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:57,520
Explain whatever you want to
to the judge.

849
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:00,160
The PM tells us to listen
to the public.

850
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:03,400
And we have to deal with morons
like this.

851
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,920
Listen, court officials are coming
to check radiation frequency.

852
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,800
Keep it within the limit.

853
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,960
The test reports clearly shows

854
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:25,800
that all providers have set
their emitters within legal range.

855
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,360
Also, it has not been proven

856
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:33,600
that birds are affected
by cell phone technology.

857
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:37,560
As a result, the court finds
Pakshirajan's PIL to be baseless.

858
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:46,800
Pakshirajan, all your points are valid.

859
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,760
But killing humans is wrong.

860
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,680
When they killed so many sparrows,
was it not wrong?

861
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:58,120
Is a bird's life so valueless
than a human life?

862
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:01,640
Will you punish the innocents
for the mistakes of a few?

863
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,240
Whom are you calling "innocent"?

864
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:07,560
Each and every cell phone user
is a murderer!

865
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,600
I screamed at the top of my voice.

866
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,200
I ran along the streets
and begged.

867
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:15,040
I pleaded to everyone
not to use cell phones.

868
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,680
Did a single person
listen to me?

869
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:22,560
People read about this on newspapers
and watch the news on TV.

870
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,200
And after that...

871
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:30,040
They say, "Even birds die
because of cell phone radiation!"

872
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,000
"Poor birds!"

873
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,040
They express their sorrow
for five minutes,

874
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:39,760
then they share the articles and
video clips on WhatsApp and Facebook.

875
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:42,160
They think they have
fulfilled their responsibility,

876
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:45,800
then again they start
talking on their cell phones.

877
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,400
I won't spare them.

878
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:53,080
I won't spare
a single cell phone user.

879
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,240
Just watch me do such a thing...

880
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,600
from now on cell phones will be
the noose around their necks!

881
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,520
People will run the hell away
as soon as they see them.

882
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:04,400
You just wait and watch.

883
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:06,960
Pakshi, your game is over.

884
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:09,080
The bus is ready.

885
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:18,720
Chitti!

886
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:17,160
Thanks.
- Welcome.

887
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:22,160
Hey! What's this?

888
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:25,200
Why did you fix your MPU
in me?

889
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,120
Oh! My mistake.

890
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:30,200
Now I understand
how my core memory got corrupted,

891
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:32,480
and punch dialogues, "Comedy Nights
with Kapil", "Kum Kum Bhagya"

892
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:35,880
and "Karela Kofta" made their way
into my MPU.

893
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:37,560
Come, lie down.
I'll fix it.

894
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:40,200
No. Let it be for now.

895
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:47,920
Aura.

896
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:51,040
Every human, every animal...

897
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:53,240
Every object, every place
has an aura.

898
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:56,320
It's not something about religion.
It's a matter of science.

899
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:59,920
Auras have been detected
through the use of Kirlian camera.

900
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:03,200
An ordinary person's aura
is three to four feet thick,

901
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:06,280
whereas the aura of a sage
may spread up to 50-60 feet.

902
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:09,640
Russian scientist
Dr. Frank Baranowski has proven this.

903
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:12,680
Pakshirajan's aura is vast.

904
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,200
It is not the aura
of only a single human,

905
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,800
but an enormous one combining
the auras of thousands of dead birds.

906
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:20,840
A giant ball of negative energy
with a mind.

907
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:22,800
A very angry mind.

908
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,240
Maybe this is the fifth force,

909
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:27,760
that had been snatching
only our cell phones.

910
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:29,800
The city would have been destroyed.

911
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:32,240
It is because Chitti returned
that we were saved.

912
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:33,800
Thank you, Chitti.

913
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:37,120
Heartfelt gratitude to all of you
who have supported me so far.

914
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,800
In every textbook,

915
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:44,680
it is said that
to protect us from the evil,

916
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:46,800
God takes avatars
and comes to Earth.

917
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:51,680
Now God Himself has taken
the form of a machine

918
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,800
and come to save us.

919
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:02,000
When a soldier fights
at the border,

920
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,360
doesn't his shadow fight too?

921
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:08,040
When he kills the enemy,
doesn't his shadow do the same?

922
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:12,440
So, do we pay respect to the shadow
instead of the soldier?

923
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,200
He is the real soldier,
I am his shadow.

924
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:18,400
All thanks to the God
who created me.

925
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:40,880
Thank you.

926
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:43,320
There is someone else
who must be acknowledged.

927
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:46,280
Had she not given me
her heart at the right time...

928
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:50,360
I mean, if she hadn't fixed
her MPU in me,

929
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,840
then we might not have been
able to defeat that force.

930
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:54,080
That is...

931
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:56,040
Nila.

932
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:10,960
And at this wonderful moment,
another good news awaits us.

933
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:14,360
This creation of Dr. Vaseegaran,
Chitti,

934
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:17,080
has been approved
by our government.

935
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:21,040
This morning, an order
has been passed

936
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:24,600
to make 500 robots like Chitti
for the Indian army.

937
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,440
Thank you.

938
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:26,280
Hi, scientist.

939
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:42,800
May I come in?

940
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:51,600
O' irresponsible people!

941
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,160
Throw away your cell phones.

942
01:39:55,120 --> 01:39:57,200
Take this as your last warning,

943
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,520
or death is imminent.

944
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:04,800
Dad, I was talking to my boss,
not to some girl.

945
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:06,400
Hey! Didn't you listen?

946
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:13,600
I always wear "Victoria's Secret",
you know, including the latest...

947
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:39,960
Nila, is photon synthesizer set?
- Yes.

948
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:45,280
All clubs are closed
after 12 o'clock.

949
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:46,280
Let's go next week...

950
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:56,560
Doctor, what are you doing?
What is all this for?

951
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:59,040
Come, my beloved toy!

952
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:02,240
Alas! I am not your doctor anymore.

953
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:12,800
'Nila, turn on the neutralizer!'

954
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:31,040
No.

955
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:32,800
Nila, stop it!

956
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:44,249
You can't do anything to me, Chitti!

957
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:47,240
Now I have a body.

958
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:50,400
Dr. Vaseegaran's body.

959
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:52,880
To destroy me,

960
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:56,360
you'll have to destroy
your creator as well!

961
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:01,680
Go on, turn on that toy of yours.

962
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:03,800
Show me your technology.

963
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:06,400
Turn it on.
Turn it on and show me!

964
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:10,680
Chitti, don't think.
Turn it on.

965
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:13,480
Both of us will be destroyed
together.

966
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,560
No, Doctor. I can't do that.

967
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:18,560
Chitti, don't risk all of
humanity for saving me.

968
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:20,800
Destroy me to eliminate him.

969
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:22,160
Kill me!
- Sorry, Doctor.

970
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:24,240
The human emotions of the MPU
won't allow me to do so.

971
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:26,680
Oh, you fool! This is my order!
Kill me!

972
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:29,600
No! Hold fire.

973
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,080
This bullets will only
kill Vaseegaran.

974
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:33,760
Pakshirajan won't be affected.

975
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:36,680
Chitti, what are you doing?
Let them shoot me!

976
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:37,520
No.

977
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:50,480
Chitti! Chi...

978
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:56,080
Nila, turn on the synthesizer.
Come on! Quick!

979
01:42:57,120 --> 01:42:59,160
Nila, no! Don't do that!

980
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:02,440
Shut up! This is my order!
Turn it on!

981
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:24,840
Stop being silly, Chitti.

982
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:33,200
Your call is disconnected!

983
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,120
Chitti...

984
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:07,080
What a pity!

985
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:20,120
Chitti? Chitti!

986
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:23,080
Chitti...

987
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:28,680
Nila, you go and...

988
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:11,560
"I will cause a ruthless destruction!"

989
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:16,360
"Pakshirajan is terribly personified.
He is the new name of fear!"

990
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:18,680
"I have come to destroy you."

991
01:45:18,760 --> 01:45:21,480
"Your spirit screams the hell out
as you see me."

992
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:27,760
"I am omnipresent!
Where will you run from me?"

993
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,080
"Pakshirajan!"

994
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:37,800
"I am omnipresent!
Where will you run from me?"

995
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:40,400
"Pakshirajan!"

996
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:25,840
The joy of coming back to life
after death feels so good.

997
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:31,600
Pakshi!

998
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:35,400
You won't be able to fly anymore.

999
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:42,000
Hey, Nila!

1000
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,000
How was it?

1001
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:47,160
Nila, the Lucky Woman, huh?

1002
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:49,040
Come, come, come, come...

1003
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:53,240
Come on, baby!

1004
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:57,480
Wow.

1005
01:48:57,640 --> 01:49:00,720
The best two of
Vaseegaran's creations...

1006
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:03,520
One is me,
the other is you.

1007
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:05,560
What are you looking at?

1008
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:10,480
Come on! Give a beautiful kiss
to your great king, Nila.

1009
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:17,960
Stop the play, Chitti.

1010
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:19,480
First defeat Pakshi.

1011
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:22,480
He is more powerful than you.

1012
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:25,360
And he is causing more destruction
than you.

1013
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:28,200
He has beaten and broken you
into pieces.

1014
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:31,480
Now he is the world's No. 1...

1015
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:32,800
not you.

1016
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:42,200
Hey! Number 1, number 2 is
all a child's play.

1017
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:44,560
I am the only one.

1018
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:47,040
Super one!

1019
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:49,720
No comparison. Understand?

1020
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:51,720
I understand, Chitti.

1021
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:54,400
Make him understand this.
- Absolutely!

1022
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:58,000
The king of birds!

1023
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:00,040
The battle is on!

1024
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:22,320
Left! Right!

1025
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:23,200
Head!

1026
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:27,400
Activate command mode.

1027
01:50:27,680 --> 01:50:29,000
Command mode activated!

1028
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:41,000
What is this?

1029
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:45,200
It's me.

1030
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:47,280
Mini me!

1031
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:52,840
So cute!

1032
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:15,000
'What a game!
What a game we've had till now!'

1033
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:18,000
'And now it's half time
at the IFL finals.'

1034
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:47,240
Hey, your phone is ringing.

1035
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:03,360
Dear subscribers,

1036
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,520
you are going to be
out of coverage from now.

1037
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:11,800
Because, all of you will die now.

1038
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:14,600
This is not an ordinary death...

1039
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:17,200
Radiation death!

1040
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:21,480
You will die the same way
birds died in flocks.

1041
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:23,200
Did you get it?

1042
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:30,000
I will combine the radiation
from all the cell phones you use

1043
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:33,600
and direct it against you.

1044
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:36,720
Want to see a demo?

1045
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:46,720
Hey you!

1046
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:50,200
Excuse me...

1047
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,960
Can you choose someone else?

1048
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:56,240
I'm... I'm on your side.
- How?

1049
01:52:57,520 --> 01:52:59,760
I was the one who freed you.

1050
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:02,680
Spare me for that at least, please?

1051
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:04,000
So what?

1052
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:07,240
You, too, are a cell phone user.

1053
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:32,800
"Your spirit screams the hell out
as you see me."

1054
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:37,800
"I am omnipresent!
Where will you run from me?"

1055
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:41,720
You all will be burned to ashes
like this.

1056
01:53:54,960 --> 01:54:00,000
'In five seconds, 70,000 people
died in Hiroshima.'

1057
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:02,280
'It was the world record.'

1058
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:04,800
Today, 80,000 people!

1059
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:06,520
A new record!

1060
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:12,000
You are going to be
a part of a historic moment,

1061
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:14,080
dear subscribers!

1062
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:24,040
Dear subscribers,
no need to panic.

1063
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:25,920
You are not the ones to die.

1064
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:34,440
A small bird...

1065
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:41,240
What are you looking at, Pakshi?
I am Chitti, reloaded.

1066
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:43,240
Version 2.0!

1067
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:52,720
Doctor, you?

1068
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:54,560
Did I shoot you?

1069
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:56,120
I tried to kill you?

1070
01:54:56,240 --> 01:54:58,360
Oh, no. I was about to commit
a grave sin!

1071
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:00,360
Doctor, don't do anything to me.

1072
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:02,040
You are my creator.

1073
01:55:02,360 --> 01:55:05,480
Don't rip me apart with your own hands.
Forgive me and let me go.

1074
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:06,720
Please!

1075
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:08,120
Take this.

1076
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:10,800
Vasee!

1077
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:58,640
Come, my selfie lovers!

1078
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:01,160
I will set your screens on fire.

1079
01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:38,600
Zero balance!

1080
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:22,640
Shoo that sparrow!

1081
01:59:56,920 --> 01:59:58,880
Hey, birdman!

1082
02:00:02,120 --> 02:00:03,760
I am Iron Man!

1083
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:06,560
Please, don't kill me.
Let me go!

1084
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:46,400
Pakshi, you better fly away,

1085
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:49,960
or I will pluck every feather
from your body.

1086
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:56,680
Stupid machine! Why are you
fighting for these selfish people?

1087
02:00:56,760 --> 02:01:01,280
Once you've served your purpose,
they'll break you into pieces.

1088
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:06,520
What's happening?

1089
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:27,720
Hey, angry bird!

1090
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:29,800
Did you not recognize me?

1091
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:32,400
I am Chhotu, the microbot.

1092
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:34,920
Version 3.0!

1093
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:39,240
If you disturb my boss,
I shall kill the dove!

1094
02:04:40,720 --> 02:04:43,880
"I am the grandson of Isaac Asimov!"

1095
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:47,080
"I only look small!"

1096
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:57,960
"We will burn this monstrous bird"

1097
02:04:58,040 --> 02:05:00,240
"and celebrate Diwali!"

1098
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:01,480
Hey!

1099
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:04,360
I have heard that
birds have 360-degree vision.

1100
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:06,840
Pakshi, won't you look around?

1101
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:23,760
Microbots!

1102
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:29,800
No!

1103
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:31,160
No, no!

1104
02:05:31,320 --> 02:05:33,200
No! Spare them!

1105
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:43,120
Pakshi, now I know your weakness!

1106
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:51,400
Go!

1107
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:53,280
"Let's drag it away..."

1108
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:04,400
Pakshi, the radiation will
burn the stadium,

1109
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:08,080
but first these doves
will be roasted!

1110
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,480
Microbots, go.

1111
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:55,560
"I have many tricks
up my sleeve..."

1112
02:06:55,640 --> 02:06:58,720
"I may look tiny, but I am
a pocket-sized dynamite..."

1113
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:02,520
"Beware of my cunning! Or you will
end up in the graveyard!"

1114
02:07:10,280 --> 02:07:12,760
A lion can do nothing
to a mosquito.

1115
02:07:13,600 --> 02:07:17,440
But thousands of mosquitoes
can send a lion to his doom.

1116
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:33,760
Good job, 3.0.

1117
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:36,000
Thank you, Commander.

1118
02:07:36,200 --> 02:07:38,360
Microbots positioned?
- All set.

1119
02:07:38,720 --> 02:07:39,680
Pakshi!

1120
02:07:43,800 --> 02:07:45,080
Have a blast!

1121
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:27,440
Hey, hey!

1122
02:08:28,120 --> 02:08:30,120
Do you want all birds to die?

1123
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,240
Hey, beep, follow me!

1124
02:08:34,640 --> 02:08:36,240
Come on, bots.
Vroom!

1125
02:08:52,160 --> 02:08:56,200
"We will burn this monstrous bird"

1126
02:08:56,280 --> 02:08:58,600
"and celebrate Diwali!"

1127
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:01,960
"Hey, foolish bird!"

1128
02:09:02,120 --> 02:09:05,280
"Your place in Hell awaits you!"

1129
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:06,560
"Let's finish this!"

1130
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:11,640
"It is a nightmare
born out of an egg!"

1131
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:13,880
Hey! Who are you?
Who let you in here?

1132
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,080
This is a restricted area.
Get out!

1133
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:26,520
Once again, we are alive
because of you.

1134
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:29,840
You took a big risk
and saved us.

1135
02:10:29,960 --> 02:10:32,200
Technology is there to save us,

1136
02:10:32,600 --> 02:10:35,960
but we are misusing technology.

1137
02:10:36,640 --> 02:10:39,120
The true purpose of technology
is to eliminate diseases,

1138
02:10:39,280 --> 02:10:41,760
eradicate poverty,
promote education.

1139
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:45,640
If we use it selfishly,
we will lose control over it,

1140
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:46,720
and we will be wiped out.

1141
02:10:46,840 --> 02:10:50,440
You think Pakshirajan will return?

1142
02:10:52,200 --> 02:10:53,680
He is no more.

1143
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:55,840
But if we don't correct ourselves,

1144
02:10:56,120 --> 02:10:57,680
then someone else will rise.

1145
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:03,600
Pakshirajan's actions were wrong,
but what he said was true.

1146
02:11:03,960 --> 02:11:07,560
The existence of humans
depends on other animals as well.

1147
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:12,680
We must control radiation,
reduce network companies.

1148
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:17,040
There should be a rule
to ensure that our technology

1149
02:11:17,160 --> 02:11:18,840
doesn't harm other living beings.

1150
02:11:19,400 --> 02:11:21,560
This land is not our property.

1151
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:26,480
Every animal in the world
has equal right to it.

1152
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:27,720
You're right.

1153
02:11:28,200 --> 02:11:29,920
We should save birds.

1154
02:11:30,240 --> 02:11:35,560
At least, we can provide them
with water during summer.

1155
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:38,960
This should be the definition
of humanity.

1156
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:41,600
All this will happen, Vaseegaran.

1157
02:11:42,120 --> 02:11:44,600
This should be brought
to the Parliament's attention.

1158
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:47,360
I'll make sure this happens.

1159
02:11:47,560 --> 02:11:48,960
Thank you, Vaseegaran.

1160
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:56,960
Thanks, Nila.
- Who thanks his own shadow?

1161
02:11:59,560 --> 02:12:00,400
Oh God!

1162
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:03,240
We need to remove the red chip
from Chitti!

1163
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:04,560
Don't worry, boss.

1164
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:08,600
I had activated an auto-eject
program for safety.

1165
02:12:10,600 --> 02:12:11,560
Smart!

1166
02:12:18,520 --> 02:12:19,880
Good to see you alright, Doctor.

1167
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:21,880
Me too, Chitti.

1168
02:12:22,080 --> 02:12:26,200
Doctor, we robots have to report
to the Delhi headquarters.

1169
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:27,640
Can I leave, Doctor?

1170
02:12:28,280 --> 02:12:29,120
Hmm.

1171
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:33,680
Take Nila with you.

1172
02:12:40,120 --> 02:12:42,160
Doctor, I can't leave you
in this condition...

1173
02:12:42,240 --> 02:12:45,120
I'll handle it myself.
- Is this love?

1174
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:47,280
Go!

1175
02:12:52,240 --> 02:12:53,240
Thanks, Doctor.

1176
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:59,280
"O' my love! You are my battery,
the current of my breath."

1177
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:05,640
"O' my battery!
Don't be discharged ever."

1178
02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:29,520
"O' mechanical beauty, listen..."

1179
02:13:29,800 --> 02:13:32,760
"I was awakened by your current."

1180
02:13:33,080 --> 02:13:36,160
"You got transferred into
my heart like data."

1181
02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:39,520
"O' my digital beauty!"

1182
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:42,840
"Let me touch your silicon cheeks..."

1183
02:13:42,920 --> 02:13:45,840
"Your firewall-like hair stops me..."

1184
02:13:46,200 --> 02:13:49,280
"Let's travel around the world
on Wi-Fi..."

1185
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:52,520
"I am a superconductor!"

1186
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:58,240
"O' my love! You are my battery,
the current of my breath."

1187
02:13:59,160 --> 02:14:04,960
"O' my battery!
Don't be discharged ever."

1188
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:11,440
"O' my love! You are my battery,
the current of my breath."

1189
02:14:12,360 --> 02:14:18,080
"O' my battery!
Don't be discharged ever."

1190
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:22,240
"O' mechanical beauty, listen..."

1191
02:14:22,440 --> 02:14:25,560
"I was awakened by your current."

1192
02:14:25,720 --> 02:14:28,760
"You got transferred into
my heart like data..."

1193
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:32,200
"O' my digital beauty!"

1194
02:15:20,680 --> 02:15:23,920
"You are the sensor
that awakens feelings..."

1195
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:27,160
"You are the cable
that passes energy..."

1196
02:15:27,240 --> 02:15:30,360
"You are the disc
and also the drive..."

1197
02:15:30,440 --> 02:15:33,760
"You are the software
that quenches my thirst."

1198
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:36,920
"My CPU beats on your RAM."

1199
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:39,960
"Come, log into me
without password."

1200
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:44,600
"In this electromagnetic
relationship,"

1201
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:48,920
"how did love come in the way?"

1202
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:57,080
"O' Alpha! You are my beginning."

1203
02:15:57,760 --> 02:16:03,880
"O' Mega! You are my end, too."

1204
02:16:04,480 --> 02:16:10,600
"I love you from zero to infinity."

1205
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:16,520
"O' my love! You are my battery,
the current of my breath."

1206
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:23,080
"O' my battery!
Don't be discharged ever."

1207
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:29,680
"O' my love! You are my battery,
the current of my breath."

1208
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:00,160
"O' mechanical beauty, listen..."

1209
02:17:00,440 --> 02:17:03,440
"I was awakened by your current."

1210
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:06,760
"You got transferred into
my heart like data..."

1211
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:10,200
"O' my digital beauty!"

1212
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:13,400
"Let me touch your silicon cheeks..."

1213
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:16,600
"Your firewall-like hair stops me..."

1214
02:17:16,880 --> 02:17:20,000
"Let's travel around the world
on Wi-Fi..."

1215
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:23,200
"I am a superconductor!"

1216
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:28,880
"O' my love! You are my battery,
the current of my breath."

1217
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:35,600
"O' my battery!
Don't be discharged ever."

1218
02:17:36,440 --> 02:17:42,040
"O' my love! You are my battery,
the current of my breath."

1219
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:48,640
"O' my battery!
Don't be discharged ever."

1220
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:23,760
Hello! Sana, darling!

1221
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:26,440
'So many things happened
and no one even called me!"

1222
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:27,800
'I am dying of worry here...'

1223
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,320
Hello, Sana, listen...

1224
02:18:29,400 --> 02:18:32,200
'And where is that Nila of yours?
She is your assistant, right?'

1225
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:34,480
'Couldn't she call at least?'
- Can't this phone fly away now?

1226
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,160
Hey, big guy! Are you stunned?

1227
02:18:57,400 --> 02:19:00,440
A strong blow came slowly!

1228
02:19:00,960 --> 02:19:02,400
Hey! Who are you?

1229
02:19:02,560 --> 02:19:07,000
I am Chhotu, compressed version.
3.0!

1230
02:19:07,160 --> 02:19:09,000
Your grandson!

1231
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:50,840
"We will burn this monstrous bird"

1232
02:19:50,920 --> 02:19:53,240
"and celebrate Diwali!"

1233
02:19:53,400 --> 02:19:56,560
"Hey, foolish bird!"

1234
02:19:56,680 --> 02:19:59,880
"Your place in Hell awaits you!"

1235
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:01,040
"Let's finish this!"

1236
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:06,400
"It is a nightmare
born out of an egg!"

1237
02:20:06,560 --> 02:20:12,840
"We will scramble that egg
and eat it up!"

1238
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:44,320
"I am the painter of the strange
rainbow above your head."

1239
02:20:44,400 --> 02:20:48,000
"I am as powerful as Lord Rama."

1240
02:20:50,960 --> 02:20:53,960
"I am the painter of the strange
rainbow above your head."

1241
02:20:54,080 --> 02:20:57,400
"I am as powerful as Lord Rama."

1242
02:20:57,520 --> 02:21:00,360
"I am a Lilliput who has never
heard the name of any disease."

1243
02:21:00,440 --> 02:21:04,120
"I am a Lilliput
who has an iron fist."
