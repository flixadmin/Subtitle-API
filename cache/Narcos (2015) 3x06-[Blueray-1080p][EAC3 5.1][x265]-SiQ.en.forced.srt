1
00:00:37,543 --> 00:00:41,129
The guy is innocent.
He didn't do any of it.

2
00:00:41,296 --> 00:00:44,299
Easy, honey, easy, okay? Be careful.

3
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:46,635
The glove.

4
00:00:46,802 --> 00:00:49,596
Screw the fucking glove, brother.

5
00:00:49,972 --> 00:00:53,642
-That Fuhrman's a son of a bitch.
-He's an asshole.

6
00:00:53,976 --> 00:00:56,436
-And he's been fucking the sister.
-Which one?

7
00:00:56,603 --> 00:00:59,606
The sister! I don't even know her name.
Geraldo is fucking her, too.

8
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:43,778
Okay, guys, listen up.

9
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:48,033
Understood?

10
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:06,986
<i>Good morning, gentlemen.</i>

11
00:10:07,153 --> 00:10:08,279
Good morning.

12
00:10:08,696 --> 00:10:09,823
As many of you know,

13
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:13,493
since Córdova's resignation,
I am the head of security.

14
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:19,624
It's festival time.
That means the city will be crowded.

15
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:24,295
The festival is not an excuse
to party on the job.

16
00:10:26,923 --> 00:10:29,926
One more thing. David and his team will
now be handling security for his father.

17
00:10:33,388 --> 00:10:35,682
Let's make them feel welcome.

18
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:38,393
And help them any way you can.

19
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:43,690
That's all, boys. Get going!

20
00:10:49,404 --> 00:10:52,824
Look at you. You're sliding
into your new job like a glove.

21
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:54,742
You're a natural.

22
00:10:56,244 --> 00:10:59,247
Look, David, if we're going
to work together, we need to cooperate.

23
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,128
If you have questions or you want to talk
about your father's security...

24
00:11:07,672 --> 00:11:09,257
I'm here.

25
00:11:10,383 --> 00:11:11,384
Thank you.

26
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:13,887
I do have a question, Jorge.

27
00:11:14,596 --> 00:11:16,848
How come none of your men
carry fucking guns?

28
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,395
Because we use our walkies
if we have a problem.

29
00:11:23,104 --> 00:11:26,107
For what? To say goodbye
when you're getting clipped?

30
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:29,736
Do me a favour, Jorge.

31
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:33,865
You do your thing, I'll do mine.
All right?

32
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,711
Boss, you didn't mention the DEA agents
that are in Cali.

33
00:11:46,878 --> 00:11:48,546
That's something David
might be interested in.

34
00:11:49,172 --> 00:11:52,091
Listen, the last thing we need right now
is David and his crew

35
00:11:52,258 --> 00:11:53,885
killing a federal agent, no?

36
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,346
Well, that's true.

37
00:11:57,347 --> 00:12:00,141
For now, we'll monitor the DEA ourselves.

38
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:03,937
Besides... I doubt they have much.

39
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:11,444
I don't want to leave New York, Chepe.

40
00:12:15,073 --> 00:12:17,450
-Why, Chepe?
-My love...

41
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:20,787
I know you don't want to leave New York.
I know.

42
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:24,832
I don't either.

43
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,462
But if they connect this lab to us...

44
00:12:30,505 --> 00:12:33,675
we're going to have every cop in the city
after us.

45
00:12:35,134 --> 00:12:36,302
Hey, look.

46
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,762
Here it comes.

47
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:41,432
{\an8}<i>Spokesmen for the DEA say that
the cocaine tab that exploded in Queens</i>

48
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,601
{\an8}<i>was operated by a Dominican gang.</i>

49
00:12:43,768 --> 00:12:47,605
Exactly! Thank you, lady.
Fucking Dominicans!

50
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:50,984
<i>But Manuel de Dios, editor of</i> La Prensa,
<i>has discovered another side to the story.</i>

51
00:12:52,402 --> 00:12:54,862
<i>This lab,
along with a number of others in the area,</i>

52
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:58,616
<i>was recently seized
by Colombian gangsters,</i>

53
00:12:58,783 --> 00:13:02,287
<i>led by a man going by the name
Victor Crespo.</i>

54
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:03,913
Motherfucker.
<i>-In the next few days,</i>

55
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,957
<i>we will be publishing
an investigative series</i>

56
00:13:06,124 --> 00:13:09,085
{\an8}<i>about this criminal enterprise,
including pictures.</i>

57
00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:11,212
{\an8}<i>This operation is much larger
than it seems.</i>

58
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:13,006
"No speak Spanish" my ass.

59
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,551
So that means we have to leave,
right, Chepe?

60
00:13:16,718 --> 00:13:18,803
No, my love.

61
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,180
This man, he knows who you are, Chepe.

62
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:23,558
Don't worry. We're not going anywhere.

63
00:13:23,725 --> 00:13:24,642
Is that so?

64
00:13:26,436 --> 00:13:28,855
So do me a favour and fix this.

65
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:31,566
Did you hear me?

66
00:13:39,907 --> 00:13:41,075
Motherfucker.

67
00:13:42,744 --> 00:13:44,704
So a new surrender deal.

68
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:46,914
Three years in jail. All of you.

69
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:50,084
Turn in the illicit businesses,
and we can keep all of the legal assets,

70
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:53,171
as in the old plan. It's a good deal.

71
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:54,922
He would've told you himself,

72
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:57,717
but he thought it was best for me
to explain in person.

73
00:13:58,301 --> 00:14:00,511
Besides, I helped negotiate the deal.

74
00:14:00,678 --> 00:14:02,972
I understand.
Thank you for coming, Nicolàs.

75
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,185
Give me an update, Uncle Miguel.

76
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:09,145
An update?

77
00:14:10,104 --> 00:14:13,358
On our efforts to maximize business
before surrender.

78
00:14:15,693 --> 00:14:16,944
So I can inform my father.

79
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:19,322
Tell your dad everything's
still on track here.

80
00:14:19,655 --> 00:14:22,658
Pacho's settled new terms with Amado
Carrillo Fuentes and is coming back soon.

81
00:14:25,203 --> 00:14:27,121
And this accident in New York?

82
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,711
Chepe encountered an obstacle,
but you know Chepe.

83
00:14:33,878 --> 00:14:35,463
I'm not worried.

84
00:14:37,048 --> 00:14:38,383
Are we done?

85
00:14:39,717 --> 00:14:40,718
One last thing.

86
00:14:42,095 --> 00:14:45,098
Our friends in Bogotà
are concerned about their exposure.

87
00:14:46,724 --> 00:14:48,935
Too many people know about the deal.

88
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:51,479
They worry about Mr. Pallomari.

89
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,774
My father would like you to handle it.

90
00:14:56,651 --> 00:14:57,735
"Handle it"?

91
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:00,279
Do you know what you're talking about?

92
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,323
Do you have any idea?

93
00:15:06,994 --> 00:15:09,997
Pallomari's our chief accountant in Cali,
and not easily replaced.

94
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:13,960
He's too valuable to just kill.

95
00:15:14,127 --> 00:15:17,213
Tell your father I'll take care of it.
He doesn't have to worry about Pallomari.

96
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:20,258
Thank you, Uncle Miguel.

97
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:25,513
Take care.

98
00:15:36,732 --> 00:15:39,485
So now the little prince
is giving you orders?

99
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,779
His father's orders.

100
00:15:44,115 --> 00:15:47,618
Have Salcedo put Pallomari
in one of the safe houses.

101
00:15:48,453 --> 00:15:49,787
Keep an eye on him.

102
00:15:53,124 --> 00:15:55,501
You decide if you're coming tonight?

103
00:15:57,295 --> 00:15:59,172
Our Salsa Festival party, Dad.

104
00:16:00,173 --> 00:16:01,340
It's important.

105
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:04,760
You know how I feel about parties.
That's Gilberto's thing, not mine.

106
00:16:06,304 --> 00:16:09,515
Which is exactly why you should go.

107
00:16:11,142 --> 00:16:13,269
Dad, you're the new boss here.

108
00:16:13,895 --> 00:16:15,480
Please, show them.

109
00:16:17,732 --> 00:16:20,735
Or at least have a good time
before we have to roll over and play dead.

110
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:51,641
Cheers, gentlemen!

111
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,731
How would you like to be my date tonight?

112
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:02,693
Where would we go?

113
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,203
<i>Let's go dancing</i>

114
00:17:12,912 --> 00:17:13,913
Do you like dancing?

115
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:18,084
As you discussed with Don Miguel,
he'd like you to keep working from here.

116
00:17:19,877 --> 00:17:21,879
Yes, I know what needs to be done.

117
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:24,090
Come in.

118
00:17:34,725 --> 00:17:37,645
Guillermo, what's this?
You've got to be kidding, right?

119
00:17:37,812 --> 00:17:40,439
-You're playing me for a fool.
-What's this?

120
00:17:41,107 --> 00:17:43,484
This is unacceptable.
I need to speak to Miguel.

121
00:17:43,651 --> 00:17:47,572
Talk to whoever you want. This is
the biggest apartment we have right now.

122
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:50,032
Three bedrooms. Two bathrooms.

123
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:52,868
A/C. Kids seem to like it.

124
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:54,954
-Kids, do you like it?
-Yes!

125
00:17:56,163 --> 00:17:57,915
Really, Patricia.
Are you going to smoke inside?

126
00:17:58,082 --> 00:17:59,959
What's the problem? This is a dump.

127
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:03,838
-The boys are here.
-Oh, now you're concerned about the boys?

128
00:18:04,422 --> 00:18:07,383
Do not leave this apartment,
for your own safety.

129
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,979
Everything you've done for these people,
and this is how they repay you?

130
00:19:16,952 --> 00:19:19,747
I'm telling you, they're done.

131
00:19:19,914 --> 00:19:22,708
Gilberto's looking
for some new way to surrender.

132
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:26,003
And you heard about this thing in New York
with Chepe, right?

133
00:19:26,629 --> 00:19:29,590
And Miguel's in charge of everything here.

134
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:33,636
<i>Better said, the Cali cartel is dead.</i>

135
00:19:34,053 --> 00:19:35,763
And you intend to...?

136
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,933
To do whatever I have to do
for the North Valley cartel.

137
00:19:42,103 --> 00:19:44,021
Which is why I'm talking to you.

138
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,445
It's funny how things change, isn't it?

139
00:19:52,154 --> 00:19:55,408
So, Amado... what do you say?

140
00:19:59,203 --> 00:20:02,998
I say you're no fucking fun,
that's what I say.

141
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,502
But we both see the future the same way.

142
00:20:07,503 --> 00:20:09,505
Look, starting next week...

143
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,093
I'll only be shipping product
for my new North Valley friends. Good?

144
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:19,890
And what about the other thing
we discussed?

145
00:20:29,817 --> 00:20:31,902
Look, I need you to make room here.

146
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:35,906
And I want you to take care of the guests,
get them everything they need.

147
00:20:36,073 --> 00:20:38,325
I also want a bottle
at each of these tables.

148
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,745
But I want the good stuff.
None of that shit you serve here.

149
00:20:40,911 --> 00:20:41,871
Understood?

150
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:45,541
I was told you needed me.

151
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:48,461
I need to talk about something.

152
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,796
Leave your bitch down here.

153
00:20:51,672 --> 00:20:52,590
Come on.

154
00:21:05,895 --> 00:21:08,230
You don't tell anyone about this, okay?

155
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:12,401
I was thinking about what you said...

156
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,196
if I ever need your advice, and...

157
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:17,656
I could use your help.

158
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:19,867
With your father's security.

159
00:21:20,618 --> 00:21:22,077
He's coming to the party tonight.

160
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:23,829
He's coming here?

161
00:21:23,996 --> 00:21:27,917
Unless there's another fucking party
I don't know about? Yeah, here.

162
00:21:31,378 --> 00:21:33,422
What do you want me to tell you, David?

163
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:35,758
Public places are always bad.

164
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,009
I know.

165
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:38,844
Too many people.

166
00:21:41,472 --> 00:21:43,015
When does he plan on arriving?

167
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,975
I was thinking around 11.

168
00:21:46,685 --> 00:21:48,896
Well, what fucking time is best, then?

169
00:21:49,063 --> 00:21:52,107
Well, I think ten is better.

170
00:21:52,817 --> 00:21:56,070
It's less crowded.
Maybe I can take him up to the balcony.

171
00:21:56,237 --> 00:21:57,446
You'll take care of it?

172
00:22:00,616 --> 00:22:02,284
I knew I could count on you.

173
00:22:05,037 --> 00:22:07,331
I just need this night to be perfect.

174
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,458
Everything has to go well.

175
00:22:10,626 --> 00:22:13,879
You can relax. I think we can manage that.

176
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:26,058
Boss, did you tell him
it isn't a good idea?

177
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:27,893
Of course, you think he listened?

178
00:22:28,602 --> 00:22:29,895
He's an imbecile.

179
00:22:32,106 --> 00:22:33,065
Pull over here.

180
00:22:33,941 --> 00:22:37,069
Pinchadito said there's
a bad phone tap or something.

181
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,367
Stay here. I'll be two minutes.

182
00:24:19,421 --> 00:24:20,881
Hey. What's going on?

183
00:24:21,465 --> 00:24:22,466
Nothing, boss.

184
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:24,009
-Is he bothering you?
-No, sir.

185
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:26,512
-I'm just buying fritters for my brother.
-Great, let's go.

186
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:28,138
-You want some?
-Sure.

187
00:28:39,973 --> 00:28:42,893
-Let's see here.
-Zuelma prays every morning.

188
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,478
Very good. And here?

189
00:28:45,187 --> 00:28:47,981
-The worm...
<i>-Gotero...</i>

190
00:28:48,148 --> 00:28:50,025
-Dad!
-Hi, kids!

191
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,196
I need to speak to you.

192
00:28:54,988 --> 00:28:56,865
Okay. Girls...

193
00:28:57,658 --> 00:29:00,452
please, go to your room
and finish your homework.

194
00:29:07,376 --> 00:29:08,543
Something came up.

195
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:13,632
-What is it?
-I know how hard this has been for you.

196
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:17,552
I just want you to know
that I've almost got it figured out.

197
00:29:19,763 --> 00:29:21,890
-All right.
-I'll tell you more tonight,

198
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:25,852
but for now, I want you
to get everything ready to leave.

199
00:29:26,436 --> 00:29:28,188
Where are we going? How...

200
00:29:28,355 --> 00:29:29,356
Do you trust me?

201
00:29:31,566 --> 00:29:32,609
My love...

202
00:29:33,193 --> 00:29:36,154
Paola... do you trust me?

203
00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:38,323
Yes?

204
00:29:42,202 --> 00:29:44,204
Everything will be all right. I promise.

205
00:29:52,129 --> 00:29:53,880
Done. I'm finished.

206
00:29:55,507 --> 00:29:57,592
I love that length on you.

207
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:59,553
Thank you, I like it, too.

208
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,391
And... a little extra for you.

209
00:30:06,518 --> 00:30:08,854
And I have a little extra for you, too.

210
00:30:13,025 --> 00:30:15,110
-I'll see you later.
-See you later.

211
00:30:42,888 --> 00:30:45,307
You were the one who approached my wife?

212
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:48,643
You enjoy it?

213
00:30:50,395 --> 00:30:52,564
Using her to get to me?

214
00:31:12,751 --> 00:31:14,586
You can say whatever you want.

215
00:31:16,129 --> 00:31:18,924
-You can't scare me.
-No...

216
00:31:20,092 --> 00:31:21,927
I can just ruin your life.

217
00:31:23,553 --> 00:31:25,055
You know the brothers.

218
00:31:25,847 --> 00:31:26,765
Pretty well.

219
00:31:27,349 --> 00:31:30,352
What do you think will happen to them
without Gilberto running things?

220
00:31:32,687 --> 00:31:36,233
You're young, Franklin.
You have your whole life ahead of you.

221
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,652
You really want to spend it in a cell?

222
00:31:40,612 --> 00:31:41,822
Talk to me.

223
00:31:42,614 --> 00:31:45,826
I'll get you a deal. You and Christina...

224
00:31:47,077 --> 00:31:48,578
can start over.

225
00:31:50,664 --> 00:31:51,957
Have a new life.

226
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:54,042
In the United States.

227
00:31:57,838 --> 00:32:00,090
I'm not going to say a single word...

228
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:04,052
until I see my wife.

229
00:32:12,477 --> 00:32:14,271
Then you'll have your witness.

230
00:32:26,783 --> 00:32:28,410
Stop. Stop here.

231
00:32:36,668 --> 00:32:37,669
Turn around.

232
00:33:38,522 --> 00:33:39,314
Manny.

233
00:33:39,481 --> 00:33:40,607
Thanks for meeting.

234
00:33:42,442 --> 00:33:45,445
Julia said you might have...
something on Crespo?

235
00:33:55,163 --> 00:33:56,122
Well, yes.

236
00:33:59,042 --> 00:34:00,961
It's something I hope you like.

237
00:34:04,047 --> 00:34:06,007
How can I help you, Mr. Crespo?

238
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,844
Or should I say, Mr. Santacruz?

239
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:12,013
Well...

240
00:34:13,807 --> 00:34:16,142
I was hoping I could help you.

241
00:34:17,102 --> 00:34:18,311
Where are you from?

242
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,400
-Cuba.
-Cuba! Gorgeous.

243
00:34:25,193 --> 00:34:26,861
When you were young,

244
00:34:27,028 --> 00:34:30,031
did you ever think you would come
to this country and do something special?

245
00:34:35,328 --> 00:34:36,413
Well, I did.

246
00:34:37,831 --> 00:34:41,835
I imagined myself coming here
to the United States, to New York...

247
00:34:42,252 --> 00:34:44,212
and building something important.

248
00:34:45,297 --> 00:34:46,923
That was also my dream.

249
00:34:48,341 --> 00:34:50,885
The dream of a young immigrant,
like yourself.

250
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:55,307
And that's why I want to help you,
to make whatever dream you have a reality.

251
00:34:55,473 --> 00:34:56,433
Whatever it is.

252
00:34:57,851 --> 00:34:59,561
Regardless how much it costs.

253
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:01,146
In dollars.

254
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:08,278
You think you and I are the same

255
00:35:08,778 --> 00:35:11,323
because we came to this country
with dreams?

256
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:12,616
Well...

257
00:35:13,366 --> 00:35:16,578
My family fled Cuba
because we believed in freedom.

258
00:35:17,746 --> 00:35:19,873
You came to sell cocaine.

259
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:23,168
Yes, we are both immigrants,

260
00:35:23,335 --> 00:35:26,546
but we have nothing in common,
Mr. Santacruz.

261
00:35:31,343 --> 00:35:32,969
My story is going to print.

262
00:35:39,726 --> 00:35:42,479
Okay. Thank you for hearing my proposal.

263
00:35:45,398 --> 00:35:46,900
Can I ask you a question?

264
00:35:49,027 --> 00:35:52,947
How long will it take
to get to the airport from here?

265
00:35:54,783 --> 00:35:55,867
I have no idea.

266
00:35:57,827 --> 00:35:59,329
An hour or so.

267
00:36:01,581 --> 00:36:04,834
I'll miss a lot about New York.

268
00:36:06,378 --> 00:36:07,796
But not the traffic.

269
00:36:48,461 --> 00:36:50,964
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening. How are you?

270
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,056
Good evening.

271
00:37:00,223 --> 00:37:01,099
Hello. How are you?

272
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:04,310
Good evening. Welcome.

273
00:37:14,571 --> 00:37:16,740
Good to see you, David. What's up?

274
00:37:16,906 --> 00:37:18,199
Looks like the whole family showed up.

275
00:37:19,617 --> 00:37:21,411
Why don't we have a drink upstairs?

276
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,761
You know what?

277
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:40,555
I don't want this many people up here.

278
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:17,300
Good evening! Welcome to the Cali Fair!

279
00:38:21,596 --> 00:38:25,350
Let's give a warm welcome
to a friend of the festival,

280
00:38:25,517 --> 00:38:29,062
and our patron, Mr. Miguel Rodriguez!

281
00:38:33,107 --> 00:38:34,692
Come. Come here.

282
00:38:35,443 --> 00:38:36,277
Come!

283
00:38:36,778 --> 00:38:37,779
Come here!

284
00:38:47,163 --> 00:38:48,373
Say a few words.

285
00:38:59,592 --> 00:39:02,011
Thank you all for coming.

286
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,598
Please, enjoy the party.

287
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:15,376
Your brother's a character.

288
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:19,047
His passion for tequila
exceeds his tolerance.

289
00:40:20,715 --> 00:40:22,926
Well... my shift started already.

290
00:40:23,718 --> 00:40:26,095
Bring me a pack of cigarettes
when you come back.

291
00:40:26,721 --> 00:40:28,097
You're giving me a tip.

292
00:41:22,193 --> 00:41:23,653
We aren't here for you.

293
00:41:25,738 --> 00:41:27,115
Where is Pacho?

294
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:29,993
Pacho!

295
00:41:32,453 --> 00:41:33,997
Pacho!

296
00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:44,757
I need to talk to you.

297
00:41:44,924 --> 00:41:47,969
-Don't interrupt me.
-We have a problem. We have to leave, now.

298
00:41:48,136 --> 00:41:50,096
-Relax. It's a fucking party.
-We need to leave now!

299
00:41:50,263 --> 00:41:52,849
-I said calm down! I'll say when we go.
-What's going on here?

300
00:41:53,016 --> 00:41:55,018
We have to leave, sir. Please.

301
00:42:03,901 --> 00:42:04,861
Get down!

302
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:11,117
Go! Watch out!

303
00:42:11,284 --> 00:42:13,119
Pacho!

304
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,351
Watch out!

305
00:42:38,895 --> 00:42:41,355
Stay there!

306
00:42:43,066 --> 00:42:44,901
-Keep going!
-Careful! Get out of the way!

307
00:42:45,693 --> 00:42:46,819
-Keep going!
-Get out of the way!

308
00:42:47,487 --> 00:42:48,571
Keep moving.

309
00:42:50,823 --> 00:42:51,824
When I run...

310
00:42:56,037 --> 00:42:57,246
Shit!

311
00:43:02,585 --> 00:43:03,544
Give me the gun.

312
00:43:08,925 --> 00:43:09,967
Go ahead.

313
00:43:13,971 --> 00:43:14,847
Are you all right?

314
00:43:16,682 --> 00:43:17,850
Motherfucker!

315
00:43:18,851 --> 00:43:19,769
Alvaro!

316
00:43:34,158 --> 00:43:36,786
Shoot them!

317
00:43:36,953 --> 00:43:37,954
Go!

318
00:43:40,414 --> 00:43:41,541
Over there!

319
00:44:04,605 --> 00:44:06,607
-Careful!
-Head down, sir.

320
00:44:06,774 --> 00:44:08,609
Head down!

321
00:44:08,776 --> 00:44:11,404
-Slow down.
-Move it!

322
00:44:11,821 --> 00:44:12,905
Motherfucker!

323
00:44:13,447 --> 00:44:15,491
-Go!
-Let's go! Move it!

324
00:44:19,287 --> 00:44:20,413
This shit...

325
00:44:27,545 --> 00:44:29,714
Little brother! I need you to shoot.

326
00:44:29,881 --> 00:44:33,009
Your gun. Keep shooting at them!

327
00:44:45,313 --> 00:44:46,147
Head down!

328
00:44:46,314 --> 00:44:47,815
I'll drive, Enrique. I'll drive!

329
00:44:48,608 --> 00:44:49,650
Over here!

330
00:45:00,745 --> 00:45:02,121
Who drove the car?

331
00:45:04,665 --> 00:45:07,043
You got here by car. Who was driving?

332
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:08,794
-Me.
-Give me the keys.

333
00:45:10,421 --> 00:45:11,380
Fuck you.

334
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,781
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

335
00:46:20,992 --> 00:46:22,118
Are we close?

336
00:46:22,285 --> 00:46:24,412
Yes. It's just around the corner.

337
00:46:25,788 --> 00:46:26,789
Thank you.

338
00:46:27,373 --> 00:46:29,292
You saved me. Really.

339
00:46:30,668 --> 00:46:32,586
Just tell your friends about me.

340
00:46:33,296 --> 00:46:34,547
But only the ones with money.

341
00:46:53,566 --> 00:46:55,484
Why isn't this imbecile moving?

342
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:01,407
When is this car gonna move?

343
00:47:08,164 --> 00:47:09,373
-Fuck!
-Oh, my God.

344
00:47:12,293 --> 00:47:13,085
God.

345
00:47:13,252 --> 00:47:16,422
-Oh, my God.
-Go! Fucking drive! Oh, my...

346
00:49:04,488 --> 00:49:06,699
Dad! Are you okay?

347
00:49:06,866 --> 00:49:08,159
-Yes, I'm okay.
-Are you okay?

348
00:49:08,325 --> 00:49:11,287
-Let's go inside.
-It's those North Valley motherfuckers.

349
00:49:11,454 --> 00:49:14,707
-We got one of the shooters.
-They shot Alvaro, too.

350
00:49:14,874 --> 00:49:15,958
Pacho is okay.

351
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:17,418
They're on their way back.

352
00:49:18,836 --> 00:49:19,753
Are you okay?

353
00:49:20,504 --> 00:49:23,466
-Close the damn door.
-What a fucking night.

354
00:49:24,091 --> 00:49:25,968
Dario, please take her upstairs.

355
00:49:26,677 --> 00:49:27,636
I'm coming soon.

356
00:49:35,978 --> 00:49:37,563
What happened there?

357
00:49:38,439 --> 00:49:39,732
It looked like...

358
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:43,611
you knew something was coming.

359
00:49:44,862 --> 00:49:48,032
Jorge! You know what? I know why.

360
00:49:50,784 --> 00:49:53,245
Because you are always working.

361
00:49:53,954 --> 00:49:56,248
You saved my life tonight, Jorge!

362
00:49:57,249 --> 00:50:00,085
-Dad, it wasn't my fault, I...
-One moment.

363
00:50:01,253 --> 00:50:05,257
From now on, I want you back in charge
of my personal security.

364
00:50:05,424 --> 00:50:06,717
Only you, Jorge.

365
00:50:08,427 --> 00:50:09,762
Of course, Don Miguel.

366
00:50:10,221 --> 00:50:13,224
And if you allow me, we don't know
if this will be the only attack or not.

367
00:50:14,808 --> 00:50:17,520
So I need to know where you are
at all times.

368
00:50:18,103 --> 00:50:19,438
Tomorrow is another day.

369
00:50:27,696 --> 00:50:30,491
<i>-Gilberto, it's me.</i>
-Thank God!

370
00:50:30,658 --> 00:50:32,868
-How are you, brother?
<i>-We're okay.</i>

371
00:50:33,035 --> 00:50:35,746
Look, Gilberto,
they tried to kill Pacho, too.

372
00:50:35,913 --> 00:50:38,832
<i>-Pacho! No, it can't be...</i>
-No, he's okay. He survived.

373
00:50:38,999 --> 00:50:41,168
<i>-He's on his way home.</i>
-Thank God.

374
00:50:41,335 --> 00:50:45,089
These North Valley motherfuckers,
I'm going to kill them. Sons of bitches.

375
00:50:45,256 --> 00:50:48,717
Listen to me, Miguel.
Now's not the time for...

376
00:50:49,343 --> 00:50:51,178
Everybody's watching.

377
00:50:51,762 --> 00:50:54,765
<i>-It could ruin everything.</i>
-Look, Gilberto. They tried to kill me.

378
00:50:56,642 --> 00:50:58,310
They tried to kill my son.

379
00:50:58,644 --> 00:51:01,480
They tried to kill Maria.
They tried to kill Pacho.

380
00:51:01,647 --> 00:51:03,649
Yes, I understand, brother, but...

381
00:51:05,276 --> 00:51:08,571
for now, we can't afford to start a war.

382
00:51:08,737 --> 00:51:10,656
Especially being so close
to the surrender.

383
00:51:10,823 --> 00:51:12,908
What fucking surrender, Gilberto?

384
00:51:13,534 --> 00:51:16,078
Before we can surrender,
they'll take everything from us.

385
00:51:16,245 --> 00:51:19,248
-Brother, listen to me.
-Okay, no war. I understand.

386
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:22,668
<i>You'll see.</i>

387
00:51:23,419 --> 00:51:25,296
Everything is going to be okay, brother.

388
00:51:27,172 --> 00:51:28,799
Okay, Gilberto. Bye.

389
00:53:07,898 --> 00:53:11,860
<i>Over 15 people were killed, with dozens
more injured and in critical condition,</i>

390
00:53:12,027 --> 00:53:15,406
<i>in a deadly shootout tonight
at the kick-off party for the Cali Fair.</i>

391
00:53:15,572 --> 00:53:19,243
<i>Police say it's too early to say
what caused the incident,</i>

392
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:21,537
<i>but several people
who were inside the club...</i>

393
00:53:21,704 --> 00:53:24,456
-I was worried.
-I'm okay.

394
00:53:24,623 --> 00:53:26,917
-We're safe.
-What happened?

395
00:53:28,168 --> 00:53:31,046
It was the North Valley. I'm okay.

396
00:53:31,213 --> 00:53:32,673
Where are we going?

397
00:53:33,716 --> 00:53:35,759
Why do we have to leave?

398
00:53:35,926 --> 00:53:37,052
What's going on?

399
00:53:38,095 --> 00:53:39,930
Come with me. Come.

400
00:53:42,683 --> 00:53:44,727
Tell me what's going on right now!

401
00:53:45,686 --> 00:53:47,563
What I'm about to tell you
has to stay here.

402
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,690
You can't tell anyone, understand?

403
00:53:52,025 --> 00:53:53,819
I'm working for the Americans.

404
00:53:56,363 --> 00:53:57,364
It can't be.

405
00:53:59,616 --> 00:54:00,743
It can't be.

406
00:54:00,993 --> 00:54:02,202
I contacted the DEA.

407
00:54:02,661 --> 00:54:04,037
I'm giving them Miguel.

408
00:54:04,538 --> 00:54:07,207
In exchange, they will help us
get out of the country.

409
00:54:08,959 --> 00:54:11,503
It's our only option.
There's no other way.

410
00:54:14,465 --> 00:54:15,632
You're crazy.

411
00:54:17,301 --> 00:54:19,052
They're going to kill all of us.

412
00:54:19,553 --> 00:54:22,473
-You're insane. What were you thinking?!
-Paola...

413
00:54:54,963 --> 00:54:58,801
I want to welcome Pacho, Chepe.

414
00:54:59,051 --> 00:55:02,304
I'm sorry it's under these circumstances.

415
00:55:02,763 --> 00:55:05,140
North Valley attacked us.

416
00:55:05,307 --> 00:55:07,267
Their intentions were clear.

417
00:55:08,685 --> 00:55:12,689
They saw us as vulnerable
without Gilberto.

418
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,442
Weak, with me in charge.

419
00:55:15,943 --> 00:55:18,695
They are trying to destroy us.

420
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:21,949
Take what's ours.

421
00:55:25,744 --> 00:55:26,662
I...

422
00:55:28,372 --> 00:55:31,375
All of us know there's only
one appropriate response to this.

423
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:36,713
One way to react against these people
who want to take everything from us,

424
00:55:38,215 --> 00:55:40,551
what we've worked so hard to build.

425
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:45,514
War.

426
00:55:52,229 --> 00:55:54,022
This is Gilberto's decision?

427
00:55:58,652 --> 00:55:59,653
It's...

428
00:56:00,779 --> 00:56:01,780
mine.
