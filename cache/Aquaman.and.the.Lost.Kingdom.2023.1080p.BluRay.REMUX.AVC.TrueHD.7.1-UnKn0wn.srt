1
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,197
Stay down!

2
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,041
Don't move!

3
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,006
Yeah!

4
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,678
Mayday! Mayday!
This is the Sawyer-Two.

5
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,133
We're under attack by pirates.

6
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,593
Requesting an immediate aid.

7
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,892
<i>They say everybody's good at something.</i>

8
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,103
<i>Me? I talk to fish.</i>

9
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,064
<i>That's how I met my friend, Storm.</i>

10
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,692
<i>He's always there when I need a lift.</i>

11
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,882
<i>Some people think that makes me a joke,
but I don't care.</i>

12
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,586
<i>You know why?
'Cause I'm also good at something else.</i>

13
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,599
<i>And that's breaking heads.</i>

14
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,393
Pow! Papa took on all the pirates.

15
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,023
I was like,
"Well, the pirates think that--"

16
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,821
Hi-ya!

17
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,068
Papa kicked their butts.

18
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,954
<i>Those chumlickers didn't stand a chance.</i>

19
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,103
Ooh!

20
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,284
<i>Papa kicked their asses
and took their names.</i>

21
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,335
Yeah! Come on!

22
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,126
Watch out.

23
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,629
Sorry, Pops. My bad.

24
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,683
<i>Oh, yeah, this is my son, Arthur Jr.</i>

25
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,515
<i>See, four years ago, everything changed.</i>

26
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,349
<i>I met a woman, fell in love,
and the next thing I know,</i>

27
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,380
<i>we're getting married and having a kid.</i>

28
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,733
<i>This little guy's the best thing
that ever happened to me.</i>

29
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,451
<i>But this kid, he doesn't sleep.</i>

30
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,324
Okay--

31
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,918
<i>And he never misses.</i>

32
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:53,541
What the...?

33
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:54,963
<i>And then, I'm up at the crack of dawn</i>

34
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,257
<i>because on top of getting married
and having a kid...</i>

35
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,426
<i>...I finally got a job.</i>

36
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,805
<i>That's right.
I'm the king of freaking Atlantis.</i>

37
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,469
<i>How did I score that, you asked?</i>

38
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:12,895
<i>Well, I stopped my brother, Orm,
from attacking the surface world.</i>

39
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,144
<i>And in doing so,
I claimed the throne from him.</i>

40
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,692
<i>At first I was all like...</i>

41
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,474
Yeah!

42
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,325
The territorial waters are long held...

43
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:26,530
<i>But then, as it turned out, being king
wasn't all it was cracked up to be.</i>

44
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,534
I would kindly remind king nereus...

45
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,287
<i>It's just meetings all day and politics.</i>

46
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,415
<i>I'm so bored, I don't even know
which end of the Brine King</i>

47
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,337
<i>I'm supposed to be looking at
half the time.</i>

48
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,131
Whoo!

49
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,925
Yeah! That was awesome!

50
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,422
<i>And as if that's not bad enough,</i>

51
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,675
<i>turns out there's this whole
Council of Houses thing</i>

52
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,130
<i>that nobody told me about.</i>

53
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,637
<i>Which basically gets to shoot down
everything I want to do.</i>

54
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,473
<i>The only thing
that makes all the hard work</i>

55
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,272
<i>and sleepless nights worthwhile
is hanging with my little man.</i>

56
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,224
Hey! Ha-ha! You missed me!

57
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,068
<i>But of course,
there are fun parts of the job.</i>

58
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,405
Whoa!

59
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,953
<i>I get to keep the sea safe
the best way I know how.</i>

60
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,918
<i>Especially when I get to take down
an illegal cage fight or two.</i>

61
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,420
<i>But for everything I get right,
something else gets screwed up.</i>

62
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,022
Ah, fu--

63
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,967
-Oh, yeah.
-Here you go.

64
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,598
<i>Sláinte.</i>

65
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,389
So...

66
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,276
...he's gonna need a little brother
or sister to play with.

67
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,906
He's got a dog.

68
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,026
Hey, I'm serious.

69
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,447
I saw how lonely it was
for you growing up.

70
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,953
An only child.

71
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,869
I always regretted
I couldn't give you that.

72
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,085
Yeah, well, don't be too hard on yourself.

73
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,425
Turns out I have a brother
and he's a total dickbag.

74
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,843
Come on.

75
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,345
Your relationship with Orm
isn't how it usually is.

76
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:57,146
Sure, siblings bicker and fight,
but at the end of the day, they're family.

77
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,187
You should be able
to count on them for help.

78
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,900
Yeah, well,
I'll still take the dog over him any clay.

79
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,699
Hey, look at that.

80
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,457
Holy crap.

81
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:35,552
Hi, baby boy.
Are you talking to the fishies?

82
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:42,186
Oh, man. Pops, this is blowing my mind.

83
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,319
My whole life I've wanted
to share this gift with someone.

84
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:50,946
Yeah, but you and me, son, we're different.
We're special.

85
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,528
We're connected to the land and the sea.

86
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:58,742
I can't wait to introduce you to all
the majestic creatures on our planet.

87
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,535
And show you how awesome
this world can be.

88
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,708
Yeah, you and me.

89
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:03,180
I cross-referenced the coordinates
from Dr. Shin. Nothing.

90
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,732
Still no sign of Atlantean remnants
under the ice.

91
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,019
Looks like he's led us
on another wild goose chase.

92
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:31,293
Every day I don't fix my power suit
is another day Aquaman gets to live.

93
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,762
Check again.

94
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,971
We're close this time. I can feel it.

95
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:52,108
Expedition log day 463,
Dr. Stephen Shin recording.

96
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,736
My quest for Atlantis
has brought me to the ends of the Earth.

97
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,159
David Kane is losing his patience.

98
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:02,281
If I don't turn up the Atlantean
technology he's looking for soon,

99
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,663
they're probably going to... um...

100
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,456
You know what, let's not even go there.
I'm sure everything will be fine.

101
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,845
Dr. Shin, take a look at this.

102
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,389
Please tell me you found something.

103
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,728
Seismic array is going crazy.

104
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,059
Where's the epicenter?

105
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,395
We're standing on it.

106
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,544
Run!

107
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,557
What just happened?
An earthquake?

108
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,731
No. I think it was a piece
of ice sheet breaking off.

109
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:30,971
Come on. Get up.

110
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,233
-I think I broke my ankle!
-Come on, let's go!

111
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,561
Come on, get up. Go, we gotta go!
We gotta go!

112
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,698
Come on, we gotta move! Come on!

113
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,966
Please, please. No, no!

114
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,593
Help, please! Don't let go!

115
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,250
What the hell happened to you?

116
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,800
There's something back there.

117
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,561
Astounding.

118
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,818
My readings show something's down here.

119
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,818
And it's definitely big enough
to be an Atlantean ship.

120
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,071
If it is, we might be able to scavenge
the tech you need to fix your suit.

121
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,454
How is this place even possible?

122
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:14,496
This was all probably solid ice
until we started heating the planet.

123
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,958
Well, thank God for global warming,
am I right?

124
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,961
Uh, yeah,
that's not exactly a good thing.

125
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,518
The tracks lead down there.

126
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,354
Suit up.

127
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,696
Wait. The tracks lead down there,
which means...

128
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,989
...the monster's down there.

129
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,751
Okay. I guess we're going down there.

130
00:14:23,871 --> 00:14:25,608
I don't believe this.

131
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,069
It's a structure of some kind.

132
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,240
And there's more buried in the ice.

133
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,409
Here I thought we were just going
to find a ship.

134
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,709
-Everyone, fan out and search.
-Yes, sir.

135
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,663
We've stumbled upon
something big here, doc.

136
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,669
This has to be a few thousand years old.

137
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,253
Astounding.

138
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,394
Whoa.

139
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,990
What is this place?

140
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:06,501
At last, you are here.

141
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,496
Free me from my prison

142
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,495
and I will grant you the strength

143
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:46,169
<i>to kill the man who murdered your father.</i>

144
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,037
You can't leave him like this!

145
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,123
You ask the sea for mercy.

146
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:54,553
Get out of here. You need to live
so you can kill that son of a bitch.

147
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,849
<i>You will take from him
what he stole from you.</i>

148
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,971
<i>His home will burn</i>

149
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:09,026
<i>and his kingdom will fall
before my legions.</i>

150
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,738
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

151
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,158
David. No, David.

152
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,782
David! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

153
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,954
David. David, it's okay.

154
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,247
You're all right.

155
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,035
What the hell is that thing?

156
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,848
<i>Just unbelievable footage
coming in from all around the world.</i>

157
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:45,849
<i>Good evening, folks.</i>

158
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,853
<i>In the past five months we've seen
an extraordinary rise</i>

159
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,230
<i>in temperatures
reported around the world.</i>

160
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,484
<i>And that has resulted in some
of the wildest weather we've ever seen.</i>

161
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:59,068
<i>Yes, this is thundersnow in Dallas, Texas.</i>

162
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,904
<i>Visibility is near zero,
and there's more snow expected tonight</i>

163
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,208
<i>than Dallas usually sees
in an entire year.</i>

164
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:09,127
<i>It's only one part
of a worldwide weather phenomenon</i>

165
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,671
<i>unlike anything we've ever seen before.</i>

166
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,507
Arthur.

167
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,266
The Council's called
for an emergency gathering.

168
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,769
There's been another plague outbreak.

169
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,562
<i>...in which scientists
are at a loss to explain.</i>

170
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,518
<i>But the real question is,</i>

171
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:37,572
<i>how long will it continue?
And how much hotter is it going to get?</i>

172
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,076
Where did it hit this time?

173
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,121
The Ninth Tride of Atlantis,

174
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:49,166
and there are now reports of outbreaks
in the Fishermen Kingdom as well.

175
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,961
There haven't been outbreaks like this
in centuries.

176
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,038
Why now?

177
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:57,296
Increased ocean acidity, decreased
oxygen levels, toxic algal blooms.

178
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,218
Take your pick.

179
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:04,015
The surface has been poisoning
our atmosphere for over a century.

180
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,805
You can't expect them to care
about what happens to us

181
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,728
if they don't even know we exist.

182
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,147
If you want to be a part
of the conversation,

183
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,474
we have to take our seat at the table.

184
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,691
It's time for Atlantis to reveal itself
to the surface.

185
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,914
Your majesty is well aware
of the Council's position on this.

186
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,164
Listen, we can talk to their scientists
and combine our technologies

187
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,416
to reverse the damage
that they've already done.

188
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:39,505
And I know this is against our traditions,
but the world is shrinking,

189
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,836
and the old ways aren't gonna
protect us anymore.

190
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,756
Times have changed.

191
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,141
Atlantis wants this.

192
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:50,016
There's a whole generation out there
that don't want to hide anymore.

193
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,349
Have you already forgotten
that this plague

194
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,355
killed your own beloved mentor,

195
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,904
and you want to negotiate with them?

196
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,405
We gave your brother war powers
and made him Ocean Master for a reason.

197
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:09,118
If we ever decide to make ourselves known
to the surface dwellers,

198
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:13,167
it will be to eradicate them,
not to co-exist.

199
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,485
Hey, not bad.

200
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,240
Used to take me twice as long
to get you to go to sleep.

201
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,071
I don't know how you did it, Pops.

202
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,248
Mera and I have
the whole kingdom helping us,

203
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,666
but that little baby boy is still
kicking our asses.

204
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,080
And you...

205
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,374
taking care of me,
raising me on your own...

206
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,804
You're the real superhero.

207
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,976
-To single parents.
-Mm.

208
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:17,436
Well, my job was a little less
stressful than yours.

209
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,143
Yeah, well, I just plain suck at my job.

210
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,488
Vulko told me to bring
the land and the sea together.

211
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:29,073
The problem is half of Atlantis
still wants to destroy the surface.

212
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:31,450
They won't listen.
I can't bring shit together.

213
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,578
Vulko believed in you. Aye.

214
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,954
I know.

215
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,495
I miss him.

216
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:43,666
Hey.

217
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,008
You can't save them all, son.

218
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:52,350
You really want to know how
I raised you here? By myself?

219
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,511
I just keep going.

220
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,599
You celebrate the wins,
you mourn the losses.

221
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,644
And you wake up the next day
and you do it again.

222
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:07,319
Sometimes not giving up
is the most heroic thing you can do.

223
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,760
Humans were not made
to live at these depths.

224
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,550
Yeah, don't worry about that.

225
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,514
You just remember who built this ship.

226
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:17,431
I'm more worried about how long ago
they built it.

227
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,144
We're coming up on it.
Engage stealth mode.

228
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,324
Hey, doc.

229
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,961
You stand ready
with that big gun of yours.

230
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,725
Expedition log, day 613.

231
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:00,303
Kane is off on our most
dangerous mission yet.

232
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,139
<i>A three man octobot infiltration team.</i>

233
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,609
<i>It's incredible that
these ancient machines we found</i>

234
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,108
<i>still function after all these years.</i>

235
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,406
<i>AH I did was retrofit them to our needs.</i>

236
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:16,452
<i>But they require a very specialized fuel
to keep them running.</i>

237
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,745
<i>Kane calls it orichalcum.</i>

238
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,573
<i>I don't know how he knows about this,</i>

239
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:23,285
<i>but it all started the day
he found that trident.</i>

240
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,292
<i>Suddenly, he knows secrets
that he couldn't possibly know,</i>

241
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:29,215
<i>including the only way
to obtain this orichaicum</i>

242
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,293
<i>is to steal it from highly-protected
storage vaults.</i>

243
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:35,130
<i>And we're about the hit
the most dangerous one of them all.</i>

244
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,637
Okay, you have 15 minutes
to get in and out.

245
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,723
<i>No margin for error.</i>

246
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,038
<i>Okay, this should take you through.</i>

247
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,679
<i>We don't want any confrontation.</i>

248
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:01,258
<i>David, we can't fight their entire army.</i>

249
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,278
<i>Stay vigilant.</i>

250
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,407
<i>We have no idea what kind
of security measures they have down there.</i>

251
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,851
<i>Commencing extraction.</i>

252
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,730
<i>Be careful. It's highly volatile.</i>

253
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,910
<i>Loading barge now.</i>

254
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,844
Stingray. Change of plans.

255
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,550
I need an extraction now!

256
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:28,807
All hands to battle stations.

257
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:03,929
Astounding.

258
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,852
<i>Attention, unidentified vessel.</i>

259
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,556
-<i>You are out of the transit zone.</i>
-Doctor.

260
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,890
Power up the sonic battery.

261
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:16,942
<i>Illegal border crossing will be met</i>

262
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,940
-<i>with deadly force.</i>
-Now!

263
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,861
Commencing charge.

264
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,041
<i>Border Control, intruder approaching.</i>

265
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,289
<i>Arm hydro cannon and lock target.</i>

266
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,791
Hydro cannon at front border gate
locking in on target.

267
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,338
Chargers set to maximum power.

268
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:42,918
<i>Intruder in sight.</i>

269
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,299
<i>Take them out!</i>

270
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:52,141
What are you waiting for? Fire!

271
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,218
<i>Sir, Atlantean hostiles are approaching.</i>

272
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,089
<i>Split up. Make your way
to the extraction point.</i>

273
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,469
<i>Roger.</i>

274
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,392
They've raided the storage vault.
We can't let them get away.

275
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:35,271
Don't worry, they won't. I'm on this one.

276
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,662
Hold your fire!
They're cutting through the Night Market.

277
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,660
Watch out for the civilians.

278
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:53,011
<i>Warning. Warning.
Illegal entrance into hypertube.</i>

279
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,718
<i>Exceeding maximum speed of 600 knots.</i>

280
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,553
<i>Reduce speed immediately.</i>

281
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:44,812
Oh, shit.

282
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,001
<i>David, we're here
at the extraction point.</i>

283
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,829
<i>The orichalcum on board and secure.</i>

284
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,209
<i>Come on, let's go!</i>

285
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:07,405
Not yet!

286
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:10,129
I'm gonna kill me a dead mermaid.

287
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:23,560
Get away from my wife!

288
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:26,646
Your wife?

289
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,103
First you steal your brother's throne,

290
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,983
then you steal his woman?

291
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:34,317
Aquaman, shame on you.

292
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,950
Uh, David, we gotta go.

293
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,035
The entire Atlantean army
is headed this way.

294
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,041
If we don't leave now, we're dead.

295
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,546
Twenty degrees port!

296
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,483
Fire the sonic cannon!

297
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,319
Come on, Shin!

298
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:13,458
<i>Lady Karshon has called
an emergency session of the High Council</i>

299
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:17,671
<i>to discuss a motion that would
strip the throne of its executive power.</i>

300
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:21,473
<i>The throne is the heart of Atlantis.</i>

301
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,722
<i>Too often now it stands empty,</i>

302
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:28,351
<i>while our king spends half
his time on land.</i>

303
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:32,522
<i>And now his surface world enemies
have followed him home.</i>

304
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:38,153
<i>This tragedy is merely a taste
of the havoc that will be brought,</i>

305
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:41,907
<i>if Atlantis ever becomes known
to the surface.</i>

306
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:45,490
<i>Because if he cannot protect
his own family,</i>

307
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:48,702
<i>how is he supposed to protect us?</i>

308
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:59,173
He's different now.
He's stronger than before.

309
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,426
And he can fight me
without the power suit.

310
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,598
And where the hell did he get
all the new toys from?

311
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:07,428
The technology seems ancient,
but we've never seen anything like it.

312
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:11,607
That weapon he used
fires some kind of ultrasonic energy

313
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,229
that disrupts the nervous system.

314
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,776
Do we know what was stolen?

315
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:18,982
He escaped with a large stockpile
of orichalcum.

316
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,568
Am I supposed to know what that is?

317
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,825
Orichalcum is a power source
that was used in ancient times.

318
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,498
It emits tremendous amounts
of greenhouse gases

319
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,326
that are highly destructive to our planet.

320
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,208
In fact, we almost destroyed
the oceans ourselves

321
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,039
before we realized what we were doing.

322
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:39,547
It can't be disposed of safely,
so the remaining stockpile

323
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:43,222
has been buried in 12 storage vaults
deep underground.

324
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,049
Well, we should warn the other places
that are storing the stuff.

325
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,805
He's already been there.
It's all gone.

326
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:51,639
We think he's been launching secret raids
for at least five months.

327
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,223
This is just the time he got caught.

328
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:56,902
Well, this spike in global temperatures
that's causing disasters on the surface

329
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:01,152
and making the sea dwellers sick
happened five months ago.

330
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,944
He's using the stolen orichalcum
to heat the planet.

331
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,747
Why would he do that?

332
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,574
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

333
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,126
If he is using the orichalcum
to heat the planet,

334
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,294
we don't have much time.

335
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,418
He is pushing this past the tipping point.

336
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:21,002
He must be stopped
or a global climate meltdown is imminent.

337
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,884
We need to find him, but he has
completely vanished off the radar.

338
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,635
I think I know someone
who might be able to help us.

339
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,055
But you're not gonna like it.

340
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:31,804
Your brother?

341
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,765
Believe me, he's the last person
I wanna go begging for help,

342
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,691
but he's dealt with Manta in the past,

343
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:39,019
and he's the only one who might know
how to find him in time.

344
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:42,197
The Fishermen will never allow you
to speak to Orm.

345
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,232
He killed their king.

346
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,403
I wasn't exactly gonna ask for permission.

347
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:51,866
Arthur, Atlantis cannot extract Orm
from an allied nation.

348
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,167
It would be an act of war.

349
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,208
Atlantis isn't gonna do it.

350
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,044
I'm gonna break him out myself.

351
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:04,011
Arthur, Karshon is looking for a reason
to seize war powers.

352
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,714
You will be nothing more
than a figurehead if she does that.

353
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,516
My place is out there where I belong,
where I'm actually good at what I do.

354
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,809
I'm tired of nothing ever getting done.

355
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,062
I've got to do this.

356
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,146
If anyone finds out,
if you're caught...

357
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,399
...it will tear the kingdoms apart.

358
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:25,949
Then help me not get caught.

359
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:33,578
<i>Xebelian intelligence has recently
learned that your brother is being held</i>

360
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,786
<i>on the surface in a secret
one-of-a-kind underground facility.</i>

361
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,090
<i>They're assuming no sea dweller
would ever dare cross the desert.</i>

362
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,258
And here's a special outfit for you.

363
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,674
What is that? A boy's extra medium?

364
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,051
It's supposed to be tight.

365
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,929
The chromatophores change color
and camouflage you for up to a minute,

366
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:53,511
<i>making you undetectable to most sensors.</i>

367
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,804
<i>They'll never see you coming.</i>

368
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,440
What are we doing for comms?

369
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,188
Open comms are too risky.

370
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,738
I'll be sending a cephalopod with you
to act as a messenger.

371
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,737
That's an octopus.

372
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:11,153
Tactical Operations and Pursuit Operative.

373
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,079
Topo, for short.

374
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:17,251
Genetically engineered intelligence
for infiltration and espionage.

375
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,629
He also plays a variety
of musical instruments.

376
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,712
Just try and lay low
when we get in there, okay?

377
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,548
You might be invisible,
but your hectocotylus

378
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,224
is starting to smell like
warm chum butter.

379
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,599
Aw, Topo, you dumb squid!

380
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,145
God, come on!

381
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,440
Is ink piss?

382
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:44,646
<i>The prison is guarded
by fearsome Deserter remnants.</i>

383
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:48,528
<i>Death-worshipping ascetics who survived
when the Sahara went dry</i>

384
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:51,326
<i>by turning to blood for sustenance.</i>

385
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,494
<i>If they catch you, they'll bleed you dry.</i>

386
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,494
<i>When you find Orm, he'll be weak.</i>

387
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,250
<i>They're limiting his water supply...</i>

388
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:02,420
<i>...just enough to keep him alive.</i>

389
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,674
And if you do see Orm,
you tell him that I love him.

390
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,308
You tell him
that I think of him every day.

391
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:15,767
I will.

392
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,640
Look, I know he's family,

393
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,188
but you can't forget
who you're dealing with here.

394
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:21,936
Once you've broken Orm out,

395
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,516
you're not gonna be able
to turn your back on him.

396
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,528
<i>You need him,
but you can never trust him.</i>

397
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,217
Whoo... You look rough.

398
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:33,136
What the hell are you doing here?

399
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,172
I'm here to break you out.

400
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,473
Have you lost your mind?

401
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,892
You're the one who put me here.

402
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,561
Eh, why you bringing up old shit?

403
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:43,130
Come on, we'll talk about it later.

404
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,353
You cannot break me out.

405
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,980
There's a treaty
with the Fishermen Kingdom.

406
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:50,403
Look, I gotta stop David Kane
from destroying the world.

407
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,073
And you're the only one that can help me.
So you do the math.

408
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:55,821
Oh, shit.

409
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,820
Come on, Cast Away.
Grab Wilson, let's roll.

410
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,732
Come on. Let's go.

411
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,046
This changes nothing.

412
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,678
Wouldn't have it any other way,
little brother.

413
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,143
Do not call me brother.

414
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:24,684
<i>¿Hermanito?</i>

415
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:26,230
Come on.

416
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:33,231
Come on, Topo, you stupid squid!

417
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,485
Wake up and open the door.

418
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:37,367
Topo?

419
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,491
The cephalopod?

420
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,447
Trust me, it wasn't my idea.

421
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:45,325
Topo!

422
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,759
All right, come on.

423
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:06,956
Wait.

424
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,777
Did you... bring water?

425
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:13,820
Yeah.

426
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,738
Uh, no, sorry.

427
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,407
I drank it all on the way here.

428
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,618
-What?
-Bro, it's hot up there.

429
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,263
Whoa! Easy.

430
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:45,895
Whoa!

431
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,523
-You know how to ride one of these?
-Are you kidding?

432
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,070
I don't even know what the hell it is.

433
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,272
-Hyaah!
-What?

434
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,083
Yeah!

435
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:15,423
Yeah!

436
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:18,794
Whoa.

437
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,733
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no!

438
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,318
All right, the water's right there.

439
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:18,941
Let's go, skinny jeans.

440
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,098
Yeah. All right.

441
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,184
Good job, little brother. High-five.

442
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,807
No.

443
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,888
All right. Good job.

444
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:29,943
You know, I got a bunch of king shit to do
back in Atlantis so we should go.

445
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,866
Ahh! Come on, Topo!

446
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:58,225
This is worse
than I could have possibly imagined.

447
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:01,854
The safety and security
of Atlantis is a sacred trust.

448
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,561
No king has allowed
the great city wall to be breached

449
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,362
in a hundred generations.

450
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,899
A hundred generations? Really?

451
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:10,199
How many years is that?

452
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:12,823
I'm bad with geology.
What is that, like, a million years?

453
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,281
Oh? You're calling me one in a million?

454
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,662
How can you make jokes
at a time like this?

455
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,457
It's undignified for a king to jest.

456
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,788
Oh, excuse me, Your Highness,
if I use comedy

457
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:26,295
to mask my feelings and deal with stress.

458
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:29,753
Otherwise, I'd end up looking like you.
A very tight butthole.

459
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:31,963
Super tight.

460
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:36,760
You know, if the pressures
of leadership are too stressful,

461
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:41,481
perhaps you should leave and let someone
who knows what they're doing be king.

462
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:44,434
You know what?

463
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,441
I cannot wait to throw your ass
back in prison when this is all over.

464
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,857
You won't have to.
Once I stop David Kane,

465
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,316
I'll surrender myself to the Fishermen.

466
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,527
That is my honor to Atlantis.

467
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:57,159
You're so dramatic.

468
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,490
Whatever.
Just help me find this asshole.

469
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,997
Well, my contact
will at least know where to look.

470
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:06,084
What happened to him?

471
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:11,632
David Kane that I knew was ruthless,
but he wasn't insane.

472
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:15,340
<i>This guy just put a gun to the world's
head and pulled the trigger.</i>

473
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,391
<i>Without even making any demands.</i>

474
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:22,782
Congratulations, Dr. Shin.

475
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:25,289
That cannon of yours worked
exactly how you said it would.

476
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,835
Well, you found it.
All I did was figure out how it worked.

477
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,343
I didn't think we'd ever actually
have to use it on anyone.

478
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,800
Yeah, well, what can I say?

479
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,223
Things don't always go as planned.

480
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,926
But that's what I'm afraid of.

481
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:47,103
David, this stuff could reshape
the entire planet.

482
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,811
Hey, doc.

483
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:59,828
We are this close to unlocking
the greatest power in human history.

484
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:04,286
Are you really telling me
you want to walk away now?

485
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,205
If I said yes, would you let me?

486
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:13,591
Sure.

487
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:18,429
You want to see how long you last
in that jungle?

488
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,094
Be my guest.

489
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:36,022
Yeah, I'll stick around.

490
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,067
Yeah.

491
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,759
<i>Welcome to the last frontier.</i>

492
00:50:57,638 --> 00:51:01,723
<i>They scavenged ships from around the world
to build this place.</i>

493
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,050
<i>The Sunken Citadel.</i>

494
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:08,058
<i>It is the one place in the world
where the scum of the land and sea mingle.</i>

495
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:11,603
<i>It is where people come to disappear.</i>

496
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:12,650
<i>Wow.</i>

497
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,645
It's an impressive shithole.

498
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,947
How have I never
heard of this place before?

499
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:22,698
It is not meant to be common knowledge.
It's a pirate haven.

500
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:24,699
Pirates?

501
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:28,032
Listen, I don't know
if you know this about me,

502
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,334
but I'm not too popular with pirates.

503
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,386
Oh, I'm well aware.

504
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:50,897
Relax.
It was the only way to get us both in.

505
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,943
You could've at least given me a heads up.

506
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,191
Would you have gone along with it?

507
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,447
-Hell, no.
-Then put a hook in it.

508
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,890
There. That's Kingfish.

509
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,066
He is the one who put me in contact
with David Kane.

510
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,862
He brokers deals with pirates,
mercenaries, slavers, you name it.

511
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:40,733
Cool.

512
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:42,732
I'm gonna go pick a fight.

513
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,363
Just let me handle this.

514
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:47,161
He's our best shot at finding Manta,

515
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,534
and he's not going to tell us anything
if you go in there

516
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,332
flexing your muscles at him.

517
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:56,371
You're so lucky we didn't
grow up together, little brother.

518
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,916
Do not call me "brother."

519
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:01,883
Well...

520
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:06,221
This is a bit of a surprise, isn't it?

521
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:09,634
I didn't realize
you'd been released from prison.

522
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,561
It is a recent development.

523
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,683
Outlaws, aren't we all?

524
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,565
We need to find David Kane.

525
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:22,856
Bad news, I'm afraid.

526
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:26,488
David Kane is no longer on the market.

527
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:29,036
Not for sale at any price.

528
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:34,121
He's solely running
as an independent operator.

529
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:36,206
Where is he holed up now?

530
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:42,170
In exchange, I offer a favor...

531
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:46,800
...from the King of Atlantis.

532
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,807
You seriously expect me
to play footsie with someone

533
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,726
with that kind of blood on their hands?

534
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:55,225
I don't have hands!

535
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,726
Or feet!

536
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:02,778
Um...

537
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:06,529
Listen, if the information
checks out good,

538
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:11,203
I promise you that I won't immediately
come back here and tear this place apart.

539
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:15,116
That's too bad.

540
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:22,086
Traditionally, the kings of Atlantis have
turned a blind eye to the Sunken Citadel.

541
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:26,882
Now, we have to blind it for you.

542
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:37,184
Fine. Flex your muscles.

543
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,155
Smash his stupid head in!

544
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:53,620
Boom!

545
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:10,463
Gotcha, fatback!

546
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,935
Okay! Okay!
We can work this out. We can.

547
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,137
Talk.

548
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:21,190
I don't know where he is,
but there have been rumors.

549
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:25,395
A dormant volcano in the South Pacific,
called "Devil's Deep."

550
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,354
Talk faster.

551
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:28,939
It's been barren for years.

552
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,150
But travelers say
there's a jungle there now.

553
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:33,907
Navigation gets scrambled
as soon as you start to get close.

554
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,910
And if you get too close,
you don't come back!

555
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,958
If I was a betting man,
and believe me, I am,

556
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:42,207
I'd say that's where Kane is hiding out.

557
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:47,416
We got all we needed. Let's go!

558
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:02,811
♪ <i>Rise up, come
Rise up through the fire</i> ♪

559
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,902
<i>Soon you'll be more powerful than he is.</i>

560
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:16,450
But you're not ready yet,
and you involved him far too soon.

561
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,248
I sense them closing in on us.

562
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:20,665
Do I seem concerned?

563
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,743
Hmm?

564
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:25,250
If anything, it's even easier now.

565
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:28,090
We couldn't have planned it
any better than--

566
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:35,673
Oh. Oh.

567
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,416
Hey.

568
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:41,304
Uh, I-I just wanted to tell you
that the orichalcum furnace

569
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,230
is now running at peak output.

570
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:36,901
I win.

571
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:44,704
Topo, go back to Atlantis
and give them our coordinates.

572
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,380
You know what'd be amazing right now?

573
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,381
Reinforcements?

574
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:58,339
Great, big, greasy cheeseburger
and a pint of Guinness.

575
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,177
You gotta admit,
the food is so much better up here.

576
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,635
I find that hard to believe.

577
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,095
Hold up.

578
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,181
Are you telling me you never went topside
to have a cheeseburger?

579
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:09,767
-What?
-Or a slice of 'za? Pepperoni?

580
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:14,610
Or a thick, juicy, medium raw steak
with fries and a shake, and you dip it--

581
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:18,944
Even the words that surface dwellers
give their food sound disgusting.

582
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:23,573
You've let your prejudices
stop you from enjoying half the world.

583
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,376
You should think about that.
It's your loss, dude.

584
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:37,424
Aw, yeah!

585
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,845
Bet you never had one of these.

586
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:41,557
-What is it?
-It's a cockroach.

587
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:43,513
You eat it?

588
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,435
Oh, yeah. Shrimp of the land.

589
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,237
-Mm. Mm.
-Eh?

590
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:04,947
That's good. Here, drink this.

591
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,373
Okay, you first.

592
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:45,237
Are you seeing this?

593
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:49,416
That's not normal?

594
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:56,503
Definitely not normal. Ugh.

595
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:00,294
Let's get out of here.

596
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:02,755
You see how dangerous
the orichalcum can be?

597
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:06,058
I bet it mutated the flora and fauna
in a short amount of time,

598
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:08,511
turning them mons... trous.

599
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,515
Whoa.

600
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,067
Oh, shi--

601
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,418
Run!

602
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:37,001
Come on.

603
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:40,671
Faster!

604
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,767
What the hell are you doing?

605
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:50,844
I don't know. I'm not used to running.

606
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:51,974
Just do what I do.

607
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,772
Use your arms, use your legs.
Lift them up.

608
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,432
Like this?

609
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:58,860
-Holy shit.
-Yeah!

610
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:00,278
-Wait up.
-Yeah!

611
01:01:26,866 --> 01:01:28,428
Whoa!

612
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:34,438
We have to jump.
We'll survive the fall.

613
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,140
Are you crazy? It's gonna hurt.

614
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:38,896
So, what do you wanna do?
Stay here and fight the hopping demons?

615
01:01:40,146 --> 01:01:42,108
What is that? What does that say?

616
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,689
The writing is ancient Atlantean.

617
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,775
"A true king builds bridges."

618
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:52,490
What are you doing?

619
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,504
Got any more krill-brained ideas?

620
01:02:27,818 --> 01:02:30,106
See? A true king builds bridges.

621
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,198
That's a metaphor!

622
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:37,083
Hey! I forgot to tell you.

623
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,501
Mom says she loves you.

624
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,579
She thinks about you all the time.

625
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:42,665
Why the hell are you
telling me this now?

626
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,342
I don't know. I'm just tired of waiting
for the right moment.

627
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:53,217
Come on.

628
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:23,839
Looks like my metaphor
just saved your ass.

629
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:36,764
Uh, David? I just ran more tests,
and this data is really disturbing.

630
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:39,847
We have to stop
burning the orichal... cum.

631
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,225
David?

632
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,111
Oh.

633
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:57,596
Okay, doc, you want to know
my plan so bad.

634
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,017
Here it is.

635
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:04,686
I'm gonna kill Aquaman
and destroy everything he holds dear.

636
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:11,155
I'm gonna murder his family
and burn his kingdom to ash.

637
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:15,947
I will avenge my father.

638
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:19,909
Even if I have to make a deal
with the devil to do it.

639
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,659
David, you can't trust the trident.

640
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:34,553
I never draw this blade
unless it's gonna taste blood.

641
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:39,599
Pray I never show it to you again.

642
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,201
We must be getting close
to the radiation source.

643
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,958
We should wait for Atlantis
to receive your message.

644
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:10,755
We can conduct reconnaissance
in the meantime.

645
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:13,755
Yeah. Look, Loki,
I'm not asking for your advice on this.

646
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:15,677
You've already lived up
to your end of the deal.

647
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:18,095
So you can go on back
to Azkaban for all I care.

648
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:19,639
So, what's your plan?

649
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:20,966
I don't have one, yet.

650
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:24,052
But he came after my wife, which means
I'm gonna pull his tongue out of his butt.

651
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:27,268
Arthur, you are the king.
You cannot let this get personal.

652
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,933
This coming from the guy
who turned the entire nation of Atlantis

653
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:31,610
into his own private ego trip?

654
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:32,731
My ego?

655
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:35,985
You're the one who swam to the front gate
and challenged my claim for the throne.

656
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:38,282
Only because you're trying
to destroy the surface world.

657
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,656
If you weren't such an asshole,
you'd still be king.

658
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:42,324
Unbelievable.

659
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:43,739
Wait, wait! Wait!

660
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,325
You took my throne
and you don't even want it?

661
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:49,036
Are you kidding me? I hate this job.

662
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,997
Only reason I'm doing it is to keep
Atlantis from destroying the surface.

663
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:53,707
And I might even be screwing that up.

664
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,007
You really had no ambition for it?

665
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:56,175
Absolutely not.

666
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:58,837
From the day
my father found out you existed,

667
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,593
he prepared me for the moment
that you would come

668
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:01,844
and challenge me for the throne.

669
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:03,471
Wow, that's really sad.

670
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:04,972
Especially when you think how easily
I kicked your ass

671
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:06,804
with basically no prep time whatsoever.

672
01:07:08,032 --> 01:07:09,143
Roasted.

673
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,308
That is not how it happened.

674
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:12,938
-That's exactly how it happened.
-Mera saved you.

675
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,394
No, she didn't. I kicked your ass.

676
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:17,026
Nope. She made
the little water tornado, I fell in it.

677
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:18,481
Okay, shut up.
I think we're here.

678
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,784
Sleep, <i>aloha</i>.

679
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,164
Come on, let's do this.

680
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:32,747
Once this is over with,
we should go get some burgers and beers.

681
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,831
-Don't push it.
-Tacos and tequila.

682
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:36,712
I don't even know those words.

683
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:49,267
-Huh?
-Shh!

684
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:04,698
Hey!

685
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:40,105
Whoa, brother.

686
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,375
It's an orichalcum furnace.

687
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:55,161
All that stolen orichalcum.

688
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:56,917
They're just burning it up.

689
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:58,919
He's heating the atmosphere on purpose.

690
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:01,009
This is catastrophic.

691
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:03,427
This whole place must
be heat-shielded to protect it

692
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:05,300
from the surface's thermal satellites.

693
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,348
Question is, how do we stop 'em?

694
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:10,518
To take out this reactor,
we would have to crater the entire island.

695
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:12,596
Get away from there! Now!

696
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:18,773
This blaster may be ancient,
but it was built for killing Atlanteans.

697
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:27,240
Okay, I am so sorry. I did not mean that.

698
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,822
I just didn't want you to break me in half
before I could surrender.

699
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:32,707
Please take me with you.

700
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:36,336
Knock him out
and then help me hide these bodies.

701
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:38,329
No, no. Wait, please.

702
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:40,669
I didn't want any of this.

703
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,878
All I wanted was to see Atlantis
with my own eyes.

704
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,087
I thought I could share its wonders
with the world.

705
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:49,550
I'm a scientist
and I just wanted to be taken seriously.

706
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:53,311
David Kane said he could help me,
but now he won't let me leave.

707
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:56,516
You expect us to believe
you have nothing to do with this?

708
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:58,683
I know.

709
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,777
I've done things I'm not proud of.

710
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:03,105
But he would've killed me if I hadn't.

711
01:10:05,108 --> 01:10:06,115
Knock him out.

712
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:08,572
No.

713
01:10:08,663 --> 01:10:10,404
-Then I'll knock him out.
-No!

714
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:12,785
-What?
-No.

715
01:10:14,434 --> 01:10:15,792
Fine!

716
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:18,002
You can come with us.

717
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:19,875
Oh... thank you.

718
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:22,879
But you better start talking.
Or I'm gonna give you one <i>sassa!</i>

719
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:24,255
Okay, okay.

720
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:27,963
It's the black trident.
It's a direct link to some ancient evil.

721
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:30,139
It gives Kane great powers and in return--

722
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:49,488
I hate when that happens.

723
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:03,790
Stop them!

724
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:06,860
Whoaa!

725
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:10,588
Ow!

726
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:19,718
No, no, no, no, no!
Not the orichalcum!

727
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:20,973
You wanna blow us up?

728
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,670
-This stuff blows up?
-Yes!

729
01:13:22,757 --> 01:13:23,715
My bad!

730
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:29,231
Then stop using it!

731
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:31,480
Just shut up and let me save your ass.

732
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:33,189
Again.

733
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,904
He's going to fight us
without the power suit?

734
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:00,577
I told you he's stronger now.

735
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:03,906
He's still just a surface dweller.

736
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:13,691
Bro!

737
01:15:18,973 --> 01:15:23,012
I never expected to see you two
fighting side by side.

738
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:25,389
We're making a special exception
just for you.

739
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:33,272
No one hits my brother but me.

740
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:37,777
I was gonna kill you last,
but thanks for dropping by.

741
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:39,483
You're making this easy.

742
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:53,875
Yeah!

743
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:55,332
Come at me.

744
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:56,666
The killer of kings.

745
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,861
Take that island down!

746
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:23,385
Fire at will!

747
01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:36,975
We've got to get out of here.

748
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:48,904
<i>Malfunction. Malfunction.</i>

749
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:50,329
<i>Warning. Warning.</i>

750
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,936
Shin, let's go!

751
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:24,564
What are you waiting for?

752
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:26,524
Fire the goddamn cannon!

753
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:31,839
I'm sorry to drag you all into this.

754
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:34,426
But the Fishermen can't think
that Atlantis was involved.

755
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,763
Atlantis does not command
the armies of Xebel. I do.

756
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:41,269
And the Brine Kingdom
has not forgotten its debt to you.

757
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,942
You may count on us always.

758
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:45,102
Something happened to me.

759
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:48,022
When I touched that black trident.

760
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:50,157
Why is he even here?

761
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:52,530
He should be on his way back to prison.

762
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,237
We should hear what he has to say.

763
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:56,117
I made that mistake once.

764
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:58,290
That's why I know he can't be trusted.

765
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:01,085
And he cut off my claw.

766
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:04,331
This thing took a whole year to grow back.

767
01:20:04,425 --> 01:20:06,792
Look, he wants to stop Manta
same as we do.

768
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:08,626
And just for the record,

769
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,837
the only reason we made it this far
is because of him.

770
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:14,511
I saw the Lost Kingdom.

771
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:21,022
Mom, I don't know enough about this.

772
01:20:21,108 --> 01:20:22,598
Is that even possible?

773
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:26,060
All anyone knows for sure
is there once was a seventh kingdom

774
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:29,147
and then one day, just before the fall,

775
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:31,733
every record of it was stricken
from the chronicles.

776
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:34,952
How do you know what you saw
was the Lost Kingdom?

777
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:37,952
No one even knows
what it was called anymore.

778
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:39,578
It's called Necrus.

779
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:42,209
And I didn't just see it.

780
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:44,582
I knew it.

781
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:49,500
It's almost like I was... remembering it.

782
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:54,381
Flashes of someone else's memories.

783
01:20:55,267 --> 01:21:00,012
During King Atlan's time, there were
seven united kingdoms of Atlantis.

784
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:05,308
And the Black City
was a curse upon them all.

785
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:13,991
<i>By exploiting orichalcum,</i>

786
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:17,241
<i>Necrus rapidly became a superpower
unlike any other.</i>

787
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:19,163
But it came at a terrible price.

788
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:21,574
<i>Poisoning the land, the sea.</i>

789
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:25,332
<i>Even the mind of the tyrant
who ruled Necrus.</i>

790
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:31,126
Atlan's own brother, Kordax.

791
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:33,006
<i>Atlan pleaded with him</i>

792
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:35,013
<i>to stop using it before the world</i>

793
01:21:35,107 --> 01:21:37,014
<i>was irrevocably damaged.</i>

794
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:39,593
<i>However, Kordax resented Atlan,</i>

795
01:21:39,686 --> 01:21:42,599
<i>thinking his own brother
was trying to steal his power.</i>

796
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:47,225
<i>So he resorted to dark magic
and crafted an instrument of evil.</i>

797
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:49,439
<i>That black trident.</i>

798
01:21:58,705 --> 01:22:02,414
<i>He transformed his people
and himself into monsters...</i>

799
01:22:06,505 --> 01:22:07,916
...to fight Atlantis.

800
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:10,293
So the two brothers went to war.

801
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:24,516
<i>But Atlan defeated Kordax
and imprisoned him and all of Necrus</i>

802
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:27,473
<i>with a spell cast with his own blood...</i>

803
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:34,317
<i>...to ensure that Kordax's dark power
would never be found.</i>

804
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:38,696
<i>And that is why Necrus
is stricken from the chronicles.</i>

805
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:53,291
This evil was supposed to remain frozen
for eternity.

806
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,670
But David Kane has found it.

807
01:22:58,849 --> 01:23:00,931
<i>And it's slowly possessing him.</i>

808
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:05,644
But even with the ice cap melting,
Kordax still can't be freed.

809
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:08,348
Atlan used blood magic
to seal Kordax in his prison.

810
01:23:08,442 --> 01:23:10,308
Only Atlan himself could release him.

811
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:14,817
Manta doesn't need Atlan himself.
Manta needs Atlan's blood.

812
01:23:15,449 --> 01:23:17,281
Blood magic isn't really magic, it's DNA.

813
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:22,203
The key to Kordax's prison
is the royal bloodline itself.

814
01:23:22,789 --> 01:23:26,157
That means he needs blood
from either you, me or Arthur.

815
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:29,748
We're the end of the bloodline.

816
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:35,212
No, we're not.

817
01:23:36,637 --> 01:23:39,095
<i>Wildfires would have made headlines
across the world.</i>

818
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:41,388
<i>But now, they're almost
a weekly occurrence.</i>

819
01:23:41,475 --> 01:23:44,684
<i>We're witnessing unprecedented
weather events across the globe,</i>

820
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:48,183
<i>and meteorologists are at a loss
to explain this rapid change in climate.</i>

821
01:23:48,273 --> 01:23:50,014
<i>From sweltering heatwaves and droughts,</i>

822
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:53,521
<i>which are shattering temperature records,
to torrential rains and floodings.</i>

823
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:55,273
-What is going on?
-<i>Hurricanes have been bearing down</i>

824
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:58,356
<i>on the East Coast, leaving
one million homes without power--</i>

825
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:03,031
Make that a million and one.

826
01:24:03,622 --> 01:24:05,659
I gotta get the flashlight, bubba.

827
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:26,718
I'm gonna leave you alive,
so he can watch you die.

828
01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:36,644
Dad!

829
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:38,354
-Tom!
-Dad!

830
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,655
Tom!

831
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:43,404
No! Dad!

832
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:44,656
Where's Junior?

833
01:24:48,173 --> 01:24:49,080
No!

834
01:24:49,835 --> 01:24:50,870
I'm sorry, son.

835
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:52,618
Where's Junior?

836
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:56,213
Manta... took Junior.

837
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:58,757
-No!
-No!

838
01:24:59,678 --> 01:25:01,214
No!

839
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:59,067
The medics have stabilized his condition.

840
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:00,736
He will be okay.

841
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:02,278
We just picked up a signal.

842
01:26:02,366 --> 01:26:06,826
It's faint, but it's broadcasting
on an old Atlantean sonar frequency.

843
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:08,653
Headed to Antarctica.

844
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:12,498
-Bring our little one back.
-I will.

845
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:16,327
I've dreamed of this.

846
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:18,958
The two of you standing together
as brothers.

847
01:26:22,886 --> 01:26:24,968
Promise me you will protect each other.

848
01:26:28,308 --> 01:26:30,140
Promise me, Orm.

849
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:45,689
Go.

850
01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:14,135
Great waves, Nereus.

851
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:18,063
Your warship is powerful,
but it's slower than a sea cow.

852
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:23,479
I say we ditch all this dead weight
and travel light. Hmm?

853
01:27:23,572 --> 01:27:25,984
And what are you gonna do
when he turns on that sonic cannon?

854
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:30,568
Our only chance is to hit him with total
overwhelming force from every direction.

855
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:33,654
-Not with Junior in the crossfire.
-What choice do we have?

856
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:35,743
We have no defense against that cannon.

857
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:37,199
Well, wait a minute.

858
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:41,083
So this cannon sends out soundwaves that
messes with our nervous system, right?

859
01:27:41,173 --> 01:27:44,040
That's right. Ultrasonic echoes.

860
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:45,670
Well, what if we disrupt those echoes

861
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:47,547
with another soundwave
on the same frequency,

862
01:27:47,637 --> 01:27:49,719
but just much, much louder?

863
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:51,763
You wanna disrupt their disruption?

864
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:53,845
Well, that's gonna be the easy part.

865
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:56,969
Take your weapons.

866
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,181
And ready your steeds.

867
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:10,320
Hmm.

868
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:22,453
Really doesn't like you, does he?

869
01:28:53,954 --> 01:28:55,820
Made a lot of progress, doc.

870
01:28:55,914 --> 01:28:58,121
They destroyed the furnace
before we could finish the job,

871
01:28:58,208 --> 01:28:59,994
but we were damn close.

872
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:02,622
One well-placed missile
should do the trick.

873
01:29:05,382 --> 01:29:07,043
My God, what did we do?

874
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:10,418
Nothing the world wasn't already doing.

875
01:29:10,512 --> 01:29:13,174
All we did was fast forward things
a few years.

876
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:16,724
The ice hasn't fully melted yet,
but our scanning reveals a weak spot.

877
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:18,600
Here.

878
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:21,224
This will lead you straight to Kordax.

879
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:24,724
Power up the sonic cannon.

880
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:27,726
Bag the child and suit up.

881
01:29:54,848 --> 01:29:55,810
Yah!

882
01:29:57,851 --> 01:29:59,933
<i>Captain, we have
multiple incoming hostiles.</i>

883
01:30:01,813 --> 01:30:03,019
You're too late.

884
01:30:12,866 --> 01:30:13,822
No.

885
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:40,974
Commence charge.

886
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:34,228
You've gotta be kidding me.

887
01:32:11,276 --> 01:32:13,017
Astounding.

888
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:57,937
This place is immense.
It could be anywhere.

889
01:32:58,031 --> 01:33:00,398
The throne of Necrus is
in the heart of the city.

890
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:03,029
-I sense something in the water.
-Everyone light it up.

891
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:12,793
Didn't you say that Kordax turned
his people into an army of monsters?

892
01:33:12,879 --> 01:33:14,620
Yes. I did.

893
01:33:14,714 --> 01:33:16,204
Keep your eyes open.

894
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:19,549
Well, that'll be easy. Mine don't close.

895
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:22,302
Everyone stand ready.
Somethings coming.

896
01:33:27,185 --> 01:33:28,767
Fire at will!

897
01:33:44,244 --> 01:33:45,700
We need to find a way out of here.

898
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:47,535
I think this goes
all the way through.

899
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:50,034
My men and I can deal with these worms.

900
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:52,912
Go now and save the prince.

901
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:55,035
Thank you, Your Highness.

902
01:33:57,423 --> 01:33:59,505
Come on, you spineless worms!

903
01:34:00,135 --> 01:34:01,421
Bring it on!

904
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:11,452
Help me!

905
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:16,388
Give me the child.

906
01:37:09,949 --> 01:37:14,034
You picked the wrong day
to grow a spine, doc.

907
01:37:17,749 --> 01:37:19,205
Get behind the portcullis!

908
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:22,200
We need to close the gate!

909
01:38:00,166 --> 01:38:02,624
Get away from my son!

910
01:38:03,336 --> 01:38:06,670
Your blood will do just fine.

911
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:10,874
You want blood? Come get it!

912
01:38:25,191 --> 01:38:26,681
Aquaman!

913
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:01,967
Oh!

914
01:39:15,032 --> 01:39:18,775
You wear my brother's armor,
and wield his trident,

915
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:21,703
but you're only half the man he was.

916
01:39:22,881 --> 01:39:24,493
How pathetic.

917
01:39:39,056 --> 01:39:40,137
Mera!

918
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:56,737
Go!

919
01:40:11,255 --> 01:40:12,336
Mera...

920
01:40:14,342 --> 01:40:15,332
Run!

921
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:21,550
Free me from my prison,

922
01:40:21,641 --> 01:40:26,886
and all my power will be yours
to wield as you desire.

923
01:41:02,974 --> 01:41:07,468
<i>Kill him, and you will be
Ocean Master again!</i>

924
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:17,857
Well, now this is certainly
an improvement.

925
01:41:18,364 --> 01:41:20,651
Powerful, Atlantean body.

926
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:24,234
And this one hates you more
than the other one did.

927
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:26,820
It's not true. Come on, little brother.
I know you're in there.

928
01:41:26,914 --> 01:41:29,406
Don't you see? You can't win.

929
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:32,784
Either you kill your brother or you die.

930
01:41:48,019 --> 01:41:52,684
By Atlan's blood, this magic is broken.

931
01:42:05,995 --> 01:42:09,204
My eternal night is ending.

932
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:19,168
I'm done fighting your puppets, Kordax.

933
01:42:20,384 --> 01:42:22,250
I'm coming for you.

934
01:42:25,431 --> 01:42:26,512
-Give it to me!
-No!

935
01:42:26,599 --> 01:42:29,182
-I can end this.
-Don't let him take it!

936
01:42:29,268 --> 01:42:31,509
Hasn't he taken enough already?

937
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:34,433
Yield the throne.

938
01:42:34,523 --> 01:42:37,982
It's time for me to reclaim my destiny.

939
01:42:38,069 --> 01:42:40,902
It would be foolish
to think he could ever change.

940
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:42,478
I knew you would do this.

941
01:42:42,907 --> 01:42:44,693
You are the one true king.

942
01:42:44,784 --> 01:42:48,197
Atlantis deserves its one true king.

943
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:54,495
I am the one true king!

944
01:43:02,009 --> 01:43:05,297
You know, there was a time when I wanted
to meet you more than anything.

945
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:09,764
Let you know that you weren't alone,
that we were in it together.

946
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:11,966
Promise me you'll protect each other.

947
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:20,858
Come on, little brother,
let's end this bastard.

948
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:23,732
I meant what I said when I first met you.

949
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:26,314
No matter what, you are not alone.

950
01:43:26,992 --> 01:43:28,278
We're in this together.

951
01:43:31,872 --> 01:43:33,203
You are my brother.

952
01:43:38,796 --> 01:43:39,706
Orm.

953
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,290
Let go.

954
01:43:58,607 --> 01:44:00,518
Orm, let it go.

955
01:44:19,545 --> 01:44:22,287
I live again!

956
01:44:22,923 --> 01:44:28,509
I have waited countless centuries
in the dark for this moment.

957
01:44:34,727 --> 01:44:35,933
Shit.

958
01:44:43,611 --> 01:44:44,851
Arthur!

959
01:46:11,282 --> 01:46:12,693
Never.

960
01:46:20,875 --> 01:46:23,583
Arthur, we've gotta go.
The magic is broken.

961
01:46:24,503 --> 01:46:25,419
Oh!

962
01:46:38,767 --> 01:46:39,882
Let's get outta here!

963
01:46:52,323 --> 01:46:53,484
Hurry!

964
01:46:59,079 --> 01:46:59,989
That's right!

965
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:01,616
Come on, baby! Yeah!

966
01:47:17,598 --> 01:47:18,429
Yeah!

967
01:47:38,994 --> 01:47:39,984
My love.

968
01:47:42,714 --> 01:47:44,076
Hi, baby boy.

969
01:47:53,717 --> 01:47:54,582
Shin.

970
01:47:55,552 --> 01:47:56,542
Thank you.

971
01:48:03,102 --> 01:48:04,592
Astounding.

972
01:48:09,942 --> 01:48:12,650
All here looking intact.
That's good. That's good.

973
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:14,151
Well, I'm not.

974
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:16,275
My claw got cut off.

975
01:48:16,365 --> 01:48:17,651
Again!

976
01:48:18,659 --> 01:48:20,491
You're one tough crustacean,
Your Highness.

977
01:48:21,954 --> 01:48:24,321
As far as I'm concerned,
your debt is paid.

978
01:48:25,749 --> 01:48:27,581
Not everybody's gonna see it
that way though.

979
01:48:32,464 --> 01:48:34,922
It's too bad you went
and had yourself killed back there.

980
01:48:36,969 --> 01:48:37,959
Yes.

981
01:48:38,053 --> 01:48:39,839
All this ice.

982
01:48:40,889 --> 01:48:43,005
It'd be impossible to find the body.

983
01:48:44,768 --> 01:48:46,054
Just lay low for a while.

984
01:48:46,478 --> 01:48:47,968
But don't go too far.

985
01:48:48,397 --> 01:48:50,388
I may need to call you up for some advice.

986
01:48:50,482 --> 01:48:53,349
You know, with the whole
running the kingdom thing.

987
01:48:59,408 --> 01:49:00,523
Thank you...

988
01:49:02,369 --> 01:49:03,951
...brother.

989
01:49:19,094 --> 01:49:21,176
You're not as bad at this as you think.

990
01:49:23,015 --> 01:49:25,757
The people of Atlantis
are lucky to have you.

991
01:49:27,061 --> 01:49:28,847
You were everything I was not.

992
01:49:28,937 --> 01:49:31,929
You do the right thing when doing
the wrong thing is much easier.

993
01:49:33,317 --> 01:49:37,857
And you're willing to ask for help,
even from your worst enemy.

994
01:49:39,698 --> 01:49:42,565
I know it may not feel like you know
what you're doing sometimes, but...

995
01:49:42,659 --> 01:49:44,445
...keep trusting your instincts.

996
01:49:45,204 --> 01:49:48,663
If you lead, Atlantis will follow.

997
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:54,794
After all, a true king
builds bridges, right?

998
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:58,047
I thought that was just a metaphor.

999
01:50:00,427 --> 01:50:05,263
Well, your metaphor
might have just saved the world's ass.

1000
01:50:29,289 --> 01:50:30,745
<i>We've got breaking news.</i>

1001
01:50:30,833 --> 01:50:32,073
<i>We are witnessing history.</i>

1002
01:50:32,167 --> 01:50:34,534
<i>A moment the ramifications
of which simply...</i>

1003
01:50:34,628 --> 01:50:35,538
<i>...cannot be overstated.</i>

1004
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:39,671
<i>A first contact...</i>

1005
01:50:39,758 --> 01:50:41,248
<i>...with the undersea nation of Atlantis.</i>

1006
01:50:41,343 --> 01:50:45,507
<i>An entire civilization hidden for
thousands of years about to be revealed.</i>

1007
01:50:51,979 --> 01:50:54,721
<i>I think it's safe to say
the world will never be the same.</i>

1008
01:50:54,815 --> 01:50:57,102
<i>The King of Atlantis
has reached out to the United Nations</i>

1009
01:50:57,192 --> 01:50:59,183
<i>and will be officially seeking membership.</i>

1010
01:50:59,278 --> 01:51:00,860
<i>And is expected
to propose a joint effort</i>

1011
01:51:00,946 --> 01:51:02,402
<i>to reverse the climate issues.</i>

1012
01:51:02,489 --> 01:51:03,900
<i>We are told that this was the result</i>

1013
01:51:03,991 --> 01:51:06,733
<i>of weeks of secret negotiations
with the United Nations.</i>

1014
01:51:06,827 --> 01:51:08,659
<i>We now go live to Ellis Island,</i>

1015
01:51:08,745 --> 01:51:10,611
<i>where the first official ambassador
from Atlantis</i>

1016
01:51:10,706 --> 01:51:12,868
<i>is about to address the United Nations.</i>

1017
01:51:21,842 --> 01:51:24,755
I come here today
as a representative of two worlds.

1018
01:51:25,387 --> 01:51:27,754
The land and the sea.

1019
01:51:31,393 --> 01:51:35,682
<i>And I stand here as proof
that change is coming to both.</i>

1020
01:51:36,148 --> 01:51:40,267
<i>And I'm calling for global unity
for a global crisis.</i>

1021
01:51:41,528 --> 01:51:45,487
<i>To finally bring harmony between us
and the natural balance of our world.</i>

1022
01:51:46,658 --> 01:51:50,902
<i>Atlantis stands ready to help
contribute its science and technology.</i>

1023
01:51:50,996 --> 01:51:54,409
<i>And with your knowledge of the air,
and our knowledge of the seas,</i>

1024
01:51:55,083 --> 01:51:57,040
<i>together we can write
the next chapter in our story,</i>

1025
01:51:57,794 --> 01:51:59,205
<i>rather than its ending.</i>

1026
01:52:00,214 --> 01:52:03,252
<i>Sometimes it's gonna seem like
our differences are too extreme,</i>

1027
01:52:03,759 --> 01:52:05,921
<i>but all we have to do
is look beneath the surface,</i>

1028
01:52:07,262 --> 01:52:11,381
<i>to see that we're ail here on this planet
with the same goals and aspirations.</i>

1029
01:52:11,475 --> 01:52:12,556
-<i>Even when our customs</i>
-Here you go.

1030
01:52:12,643 --> 01:52:15,556
-<i>Might seem strange and unfamiliar.</i>
-Beer and a cheeseburger.

1031
01:52:15,646 --> 01:52:17,637
Extra greasy like you asked for.

1032
01:52:19,483 --> 01:52:21,895
<i>And by overcoming our prejudices,</i>

1033
01:52:21,985 --> 01:52:24,477
<i>we'll become stronger
and learn more about ourselves.</i>

1034
01:52:25,614 --> 01:52:28,982
<i>We can seize this moment
to create a better more hopeful future,</i>

1035
01:52:29,368 --> 01:52:32,451
<i>for our children, and our families.</i>

1036
01:52:34,289 --> 01:52:35,950
<i>My name is Arthur Curry.</i>

1037
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:39,743
<i>I'm the rightful sovereign
of the undersea nation of Atlantis.</i>

1038
01:52:39,836 --> 01:52:41,793
<i>I'm a father, a brother,</i>

1039
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:44,463
a warrior and a friend.

1040
01:52:45,634 --> 01:52:47,625
I'm the King of Atlantis.

1041
01:52:49,096 --> 01:52:50,632
I am Aquaman.
