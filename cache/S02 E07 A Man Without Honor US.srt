1
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,381
A cripple!

2
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,425
You let a cripple escape?

3
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:19,222
The boy can't walk.
But somehow he slipped past you?

4
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,683
The giant must have took him.

5
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,687
The giant?

6
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,022
Hodor?

7
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,276
Oh, well that's all right then.

8
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,070
You let a halfwit escape with a cripple.

9
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,157
-And Rickon, too, the little one?
-Gone.

10
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,742
Along with the wiIdling woman.

11
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,453
The one you were fucking.

12
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,433
Right.

13
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,185
Get the horses. And the hounds.

14
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,608
Come on, find the scent.

15
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:16,905
Come on, where they going?

16
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:28,917
Halt.

17
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,006
Enjoying your first hunt?

18
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,301
So far hunting seems quite similar
to riding, my lord.

19
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,721
-With hunting, there's blood at the end.
-They're little boys.

20
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,766
I was a little boy when I was torn away
from my home and brought here.

21
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,102
But I kept my word. I never ran away.

22
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,606
If I find them soon enough,
I won't hurt them.

23
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,693
Well, I'll hurt them.
But I won't kill them.

24
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,614
Those boys are of far more value
to you alive than dead.

25
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,199
They have no value to me missing.

26
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,910
Robb will have sent a force
to retake Winterfell by now.

27
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,579
Robb's in the Riverlands.
My sister's in Deepwood Motte.

28
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,915
She'll get here long before they do.

29
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:14,212
And Ned Stark always said, 500 men
could hold Winterfell against 10,000.

30
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,341
The hounds have the scent.

31
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,262
Come, Maester. Don't look so grim.

32
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,263
It's all just a game.

33
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,283
-We should have took more food.
-We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.

34
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,451
Those people all love you.

35
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,036
They would have given you
whatever you needed.

36
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,788
And if Theon found out, he'd hang them.

37
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,208
-The boy can't survive on walnuts.
-I'm fine.

38
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:57,505
We've been walking since before sunrise.
Even Hodor will tire.

39
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,840
Hodor.

40
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,967
-Even you, sweet giant.
-Hodor.

41
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,471
-Oh, yeah. I got it, I got it.
-Oh, yeah!

42
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,390
Wait. I know that farm.

43
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,600
I sent those two Winterfell orphans there.

44
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,521
Jack and Billy. They'll give us some food.

45
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,482
We can't risk it. If Theon tracks us here,

46
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,317
he'll torture them until he finds out
where we are.

47
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,945
Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.

48
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,114
You've never seen me climb a tree,
little man.

49
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,199
He'll be after us with hounds.

50
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,245
We got a good start on them,
but we can't outrun hounds forever.

51
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,981
Did you pull a knife in me in the night?

52
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,202
What's the matter?

53
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,497
Can't be the first time you pressed
your bone against a woman's ass?

54
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,334
Let's move.

55
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,842
Well, it is the first time.

56
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,887
How old are you, boy?

57
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,431
I'm a man of the Night's Watch.

58
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,561
You're a boy who's never been with a girl.

59
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,693
Don't your stones start to hurt
if your bone gets--

60
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,196
Don't call them that.

61
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,198
What, stones?

62
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,869
-Or bone?
-Neither.

63
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,539
Both.

64
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,626
Move.

65
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,802
But I heard they get all swollen
and bruised if you don't use them.

66
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,596
'Course maybe
that's just what the lads say

67
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,265
when they want me feeling sorry for them.

68
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,101
As if I'd feel sorry for them.

69
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,187
There are no girl crows?

70
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,358
There are no women
of the Night's Watch, no.

71
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,653
-So the lads just do it with each other?
-No.

72
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,531
-Never?
-Never.

73
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,616
We swore an oath.

74
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,452
You have sheep at the Wall?

75
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,501
With your hands, then?
No wonder you're all so miserable.

76
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,589
-Would you please shut up?
-"Would you please shut up?"

77
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,217
You think you're better than me, crow?

78
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,470
-I'm a free woman--
-You're a free woman?

79
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,723
Well, I might be your prisoner
but I'm a free woman.

80
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,683
If you're my prisoner
you're not a free woman.

81
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,101
That's what prisoner means.

82
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,936
And you think you're free?

83
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,440
You swore some stupid oath

84
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,776
-and now you can never touch a girl?
-It was my choice to say the words.

85
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,446
-So you don't like girls.
-Of course, I like girls.

86
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,073
-But you chose never to touch them.
-That's the price you pay

87
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,742
if you want to be a man
of the Night's Watch.

88
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,119
So instead of getting naked with a girl,

89
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,705
-you'd prefer to invade our lands and--
-Invade your lands?

90
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,416
Wildlings raid our lands all the time.

91
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:23,252
Some of them tried
to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!

92
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,923
They're not your lands.
We've been here the whole time.

93
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,509
You lot came along and just put up
a big wall and said it was yours!

94
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,887
My father was Ned Stark.

95
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:37,934
I have the blood of the First Men.
My ancestors lived here, same as yours.

96
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,605
So why are you fighting us?

97
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,798
Now would you tell me what happened?

98
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,144
Wolfsbane.

99
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,022
A rare substance.

100
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:28,192
This is no common assassin.

101
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,736
We hanged 20 men last night.

102
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,989
I don't care if you hanged a 100.

103
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,909
A man tried to kill me.
I want his name and I want his head.

104
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,997
We think it was an infiltrator
from the Brotherhood without Banners.

105
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,125
Pretentious name for a band of outlaws.

106
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:49,005
We can't allow rebels behind our line
to harass us with impunity.

107
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,507
We look like fools
and they look like heroes.

108
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,177
That's how kings fall.
I want them dead, every one.

109
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:59,181
Killing them isn't the problem.
It's finding them.

110
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,558
Have you gone soft, Clegane?

111
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,686
I always thought you had a talent
for violence.

112
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,938
Burn the villages. Burn the farms.

113
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,483
Let them know what it means
to choose the wrong side.

114
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,197
Is that mutton?

115
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,326
-Yes, my lord.
-I don't like mutton.

116
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,705
-I'll bring something else.
-Leave it.

117
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,375
You hungry?

118
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,544
-No.
-Of course, you are.

119
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:30,629
Eat.

120
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,924
I'll eat in the kitchen, later.

121
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,428
It's bad manners to refuse a lord's offer.

122
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,472
Sit.

123
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,516
Eat.

124
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,355
You're small for your age.

125
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,442
I suppose you've been underfed
your whole life.

126
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,403
I eat a lot. I just don't grow.

127
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,535
This will be my last war.

128
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,747
Win or lose.

129
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:07,792
Have you ever lost before?

130
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,712
Do you think I'd be in my position
if I'd lost a war?

131
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,888
But this is the one
I'll be remembered for.

132
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,934
The War of Five Kings, they're calling it.

133
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,522
My legacy will be determined
in the coming months.

134
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,401
Do you know what legacy means?

135
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:40,366
It's what you pass down to your children,
and your children's children.

136
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,745
It's what remains of you
when you are gone.

137
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,794
Harren the Black thought this castle
would be his legacy.

138
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,423
Greatest fortress ever built.

139
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,634
The tallest towers, the strongest walls.

140
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,304
The Great Hall had 35 Hearths.

141
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,349
Thirty-five, can you imagine?

142
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:07,935
Look at it now.

143
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,813
A blasted ruin.

144
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:13,899
Do you know what happened?

145
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:15,734
Dragons?

146
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,864
Yes, dragons happened.

147
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:27,538
Harrenhal was built to withstand
an attack from the land.

148
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,335
A million men could have marched
on these walls,

149
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,421
and a million men
would have been repelled.

150
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,966
But an attack from the air?
With dragonfire?

151
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,513
Harren and all his sons roasted alive
within these walls.

152
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,100
Aegon Targaryen changed the rules.

153
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,313
That's why every child alive
still knows his name,

154
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,398
three hundred years after his death.

155
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,609
Aegon and his sisters.

156
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,739
It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon.

157
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,993
-It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.
-Correct.

158
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,996
A student of history, are you?

159
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:13,292
Rhaenys rode Meraxes.
Visenya rode Vhagar.

160
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:20,299
-I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.
-Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior.

161
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,137
She had a Valyrian steel sword
she called Dark Sister.

162
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,433
She's a heroine of yours, I take it?

163
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,688
Aren't most girls more interested
in the pretty maidens from the songs?

164
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:38,025
-Jonquil, with flowers in her hair?
-Most girls are idiots.

165
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,530
You remind me of my daughter.

166
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,825
Where did you learn all this stuff
about Visenya

167
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,036
and her Valyrian steel sword?

168
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,081
From my father.

169
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,752
He was a well-read stone mason.

170
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,382
Can't say I've ever met
a literate stone mason.

171
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,261
Have you met many stone masons,
my lord?

172
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,850
Careful now, girl.
I enjoy you, but be careful.

173
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,103
Take that back to the kitchen.

174
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,689
Eat what you want.

175
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,151
And girl!

176
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:24,738
"M'lord."

177
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,704
Low-born girls say "m'lord."
Not "my lord."

178
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:35,541
If you're going to pose as a commoner,
you should do it properly.

179
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,338
My mother served Lady Dustin
for many years, my lord.

180
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,551
She taught me how to speak proper.
Properly.

181
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,763
You're too smart for your own good.

182
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,683
-Has anyone told you that?
-Yes.

183
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,019
Go on.

184
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,449
I beg pardon, ser.

185
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:14,288
I should have come to you after,
to thank you for saving me.

186
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,124
-You were so brave.
-Brave?

187
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,794
A dog doesn't need courage
to chase off rats.

188
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:26,592
-Does it give you joy to scare people?
-No, it gives me joy to kill people.

189
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,594
Spare me.

190
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,930
You can't tell me Lord Eddard Stark
of Winterfell never killed a man.

191
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:36,894
-It was his duty. He never liked it.
-Is that what he told you?

192
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,812
He lied.

193
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,732
Killing is the sweetest thing there is.

194
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,486
Why are you always so hateful?

195
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,614
You'll be glad of the hateful things
I do someday, when you're queen,

196
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,242
and I'm all that stands
between you and your beloved king.

197
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:05,589
I've demanded a meeting of The Thirteen.
One of them did this or knows who did.

198
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,257
You are one of The Thirteen.

199
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,176
If I wanted your dragons,
I would have taken them.

200
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:10,761
They mean nothing to me on their own.

201
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,513
Nothing?

202
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,140
They're more valuable than anything
in the world.

203
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,102
Shall we look inside my vault,
and see what selling your dragons

204
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,728
would buy me I cannot buy already?

205
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,939
We will get them back.

206
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,485
There is no "we."
So why would you help me get them back?

207
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,988
I took you under my protection,
in front of the rulers of my city.

208
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,866
A man is what others say he is
and no more.

209
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:37,913
If they say, that Xaro Xhoan Daxos
is a liar, my word is worth nothing.

210
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,458
I cannot let this thing happen to you
under my roof.

211
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,377
But it did happen under your roof.

212
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,547
Khaleesi, many times in my life

213
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,590
-I have been--
-I don't care where you've been.

214
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,117
You think we're savages
because we don't live in stone castles.

215
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,704
We can't make steel
as good as yours, it's true.

216
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,956
But… we're free.

217
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,669
Someone tried to tell us
we couldn't lie down as man and woman,

218
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,588
we'd shove a spear up his ass.

219
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,675
We don't go serving some shit king
who's only king 'cause his father was.

220
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,218
No.

221
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,680
No, you serve Mance Rayder.
The King-Beyond-the-Wall.

222
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,766
We chose Mance Rayder to lead us.

223
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:43,604
He was a crow, same as you.
But he wanted to be free.

224
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,232
You know, you could be free, too.

225
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,862
You don't need to live your whole life
taking commands from old men.

226
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,782
Wake up when you want to wake up.

227
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,368
I could show you the streams to fish,
the woods to hunt.

228
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,914
Build yourself a cabin
and find a woman to lie with in the night.

229
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,667
You're a pretty lad.

230
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:09,296
Girls would claw each other's eyes out
to get naked with you.

231
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,509
Walk.

232
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,681
-I could teach you how to do it.
-I know how to do it.

233
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,813
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

234
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,593
And what did she say?

235
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:01,139
-She admired your spirit, Your Grace.
-And what then?

236
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,476
She...

237
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,397
If every man were held accountable
for the actions

238
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,442
of every distant relative, Ser Alton,
we'd all hang.

239
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,948
She tore the paper in half, Your Grace.

240
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,994
You've acted with honor.
I thank you for it.

241
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,372
Lord Karstark,
see that Ser Alton's pen is clean

242
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:30,210
-and give him a hot supper.
-Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace.

243
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,212
The prisoners from the Yellow Fork.

244
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,298
Too many prisoners.

245
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,845
-Is there room for Ser Alton?
-Does he need to lie down?

246
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,683
Have the men build him a new pen.

247
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,352
Put him in with the Kingslayer for now.

248
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,646
Have your boy watch over them.

249
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,189
Torrhen!

250
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,567
That will be all.

251
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,702
Your Grace. A minute of your time?

252
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:22,304
-I've been treating your wounded men.
-And my enemies,

253
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,182
as some of my bannermen
are fond of mentioning.

254
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,602
-They are not my enemies.
-That's what I tell my bannermen.

255
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,521
I've already run through the supplies
I brought with me.

256
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:36,276
Some are easily replaced,
egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses.

257
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,487
But some are not.

258
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,114
I need silk for stitching.

259
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,118
I need fennel root for those with fever.

260
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,537
Willow bark.
Mostly I need milk of the poppy.

261
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,791
You saw what it was like
to amputate a foot without any.

262
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,962
I assume there will be more loss of limb
before this war is over.

263
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:58,548
-If you need help finding these--
-I know where to find them.

264
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,135
I'm sorry. I shouldn't interrupt you.

265
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,639
Continue, my lady.

266
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,145
You are riding to the Crag
to negotiate a surrender?

267
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,232
-Yes.
-The Crag will have a maester.

268
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,735
-And he will have what I need.
-I expect he will.

269
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,614
-If I could write up a list.
-Come with me to the Crag.

270
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,370
-I don't think that will be--
-Let the maester show you his stores.

271
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,164
I want the wounded men to be treated well.

272
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,459
All the wounded men.

273
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:46,430
-Children, come inside, quickly!
-Hurry up!

274
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,642
We can't find anything, ser!

275
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,603
-They've lost the scent.
-Try again.

276
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,314
We've circled the farmhouse twice.
There's no sign of them.

277
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,568
We could start the search fresh
in the morning, my lord.

278
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,905
I'm looking at spending the rest
of my life being treated like a fool

279
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,741
and a eunuch by my own people.

280
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:09,286
Ask yourself, is there anything
I wouldn't do to stop that from happening?

281
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:13,582
The hounds will find the scent again,
I'll beat them until they do.

282
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,918
I'll whip every man here
until I have both those boys in hand.

283
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,005
And once I've got them,
the pampered little shits--

284
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,552
-It's better to be cruel than weak.
-Prince Theon!

285
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,805
-Where are they?
-Who, M'lord?

286
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:32,434
-The Stark boys. Where are they?
-I don't know. I've seen no one.

287
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,520
Think harder.

288
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,316
I swear, M'lord, I don't know…

289
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,152
My lord. Over here.

290
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,657
I think I've found what we're looking for.

291
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,628
Send the old man home.

292
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,720
Go back to Winterfell. Take him back.

293
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,308
Theon, don't do this.

294
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:33,912
You came back.

295
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:37,499
As soon as I heard.
Do you know anything?

296
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,127
Irri is dead.

297
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:41,586
I know.

298
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,631
-She was a good…
-She's dead.

299
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,969
She died alone. She died for me.
And I couldn't protect her.

300
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,055
Doreah?

301
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,141
We can't find her.

302
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,018
She must be dead, too.

303
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:02,149
I led my people out of the Red Waste
and into the slaughterhouse.

304
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,109
I should have been here.

305
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,862
You went to find me a ship.

306
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,031
My place is by your side.

307
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,075
I shouldn't have left you alone
with these people.

308
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,787
-These people?
-They are not to be trusted.

309
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,998
And who is to be trusted?

310
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,460
Who are my people? The Targaryens?

311
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,005
I only knew one, my brother,

312
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,299
and he would have let
a thousand men rape me

313
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,842
if it had got him the crown.

314
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,343
The Dothraki?

315
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,431
Most of them turned on me the day
that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.

316
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,308
Your people are in Westeros.

317
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,144
The people in Westeros
don't know I'm alive.

318
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,271
-They will soon enough.
-And then what?

319
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,648
They'll pray for my return?

320
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,901
They'll wave dragon banners
and shout my name?

321
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,570
That's what my brother believed.
And he was a fool.

322
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:53,450
You are not your brother.
Trust me, Khaleesi.

323
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,202
There it is.

324
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,412
Trust me.

325
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,582
And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah?

326
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Only you?

327
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,215
I don't need trust any longer.

328
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,343
I don't want it,
and I don't have room for it.

329
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,555
-You're too young to be so--
-And you are too familiar.

330
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,646
Forgive me, Khaleesi.

331
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:28,902
No one can survive in this world
without help. No one.

332
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,905
Let me help you. Please.

333
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,199
Tell me how.

334
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,036
Find my dragons.

335
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,380
How long till we get back to your crows?

336
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,716
We're close.

337
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,928
A day? A half-day?

338
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,184
You don't know, do you?

339
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,980
-Do you even know where they are?
-We're close.

340
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,359
What do you think they'll say
when they hear about you and me?

341
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,403
Nothing happened between you and me.

342
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:16,992
"I swear it, Old Master King Crow sir,
we were only close together for warmth.

343
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:21,913
"Then I felt it,
right up against me backside like a club,

344
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,040
I can show you the bruise on me tailbone.

345
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:28,044
"And before I knew what was where, his--

346
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,880
"Well, it was all out in the open,
all angry-as-you-like,

347
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:34,259
and I didn't want to want it but, oh,
I did!

348
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:39,264
"And he spread me legs, and ruined!
"The shame of it!

349
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:43,935
"Now I can never marry a perfumed lord!
"What will me poor savage father say?"

350
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,854
Turn back around.

351
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,732
"And I thought we were done, but he said,
'Turn back around.'"

352
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,360
I'll tell you what, Jon Snow,

353
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,363
since it's going to be your word
against mine,

354
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,074
and since you can't talk about it
without blushing…

355
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,369
we may as well just--

356
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,539
What, right here in the muck?

357
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,833
I'll keep you warm enough.

358
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:10,795
Are you that afraid of it?

359
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,549
-That's enough.
-It's nice…

360
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:16,593
and wet…

361
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,429
-and warm.
-Enough.

362
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,974
It don't have teeth.

363
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,317
All right.

364
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:34,819
All right.

365
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,114
Gods, you're dull.

366
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,486
Should've took me
while you had the chance.

367
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,646
No! Oh, no.

368
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,373
It's all right. Give me that.

369
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:14,169
If the queen sees
I can have Joffrey's children now...

370
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,296
Help me flip it over.

371
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,690
-Where are you going?
-To tell Her Grace.

372
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:41,237
You'll say nothing to anyone.
Do you understand?

373
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,928
Your mother might have prepared you.

374
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,347
You've flowered, my dear. No more.

375
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,226
My mother told me, but I thought
it would be different.

376
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,477
In what way?

377
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,605
I thought it would be less…

378
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:17,815
less messy.

379
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,985
Wait until you birth a child.

380
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,533
You're a woman, now.
Do you have any idea what that means?

381
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,536
I'm fit to bear children for the king.

382
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,705
A prospect that once delighted you,

383
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,416
bringing little princes and princesses
into the world.

384
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,628
The greatest honor, for a queen.

385
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,051
Joffrey's always been difficult.

386
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,762
Even his birth,

387
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:50,056
I labored a day and a half
to bring him into this world.

388
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,600
You cannot imagine the pain.

389
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,811
I screamed so loudly,

390
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,688
I was sure Robert would hear me
in the Kingswood.

391
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,023
His Grace was not with you?

392
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,483
Robert was hunting.

393
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:02,860
That was his custom.

394
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,699
Whenever my time was near,

395
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:11,202
my royal husband would flee to the trees

396
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:15,081
with his huntsmen and his hounds.

397
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:20,295
And when he returned he would present me
with some pelts or a stag's head,

398
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:22,589
and I would present him with a baby.

399
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,551
Not that I wanted him there, mind you.

400
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:31,514
I had Grand Maester Pycelle,
an army of midwives, and I had my brother.

401
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,018
When they told Jaime he was not allowed
in the birthing room,

402
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:40,315
he smiled and asked which one of them
proposed to keep him out.

403
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,446
Joffrey will show you no such devotion.

404
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,908
You may never love the king…

405
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,161
but you will love his children.

406
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,039
I love His Grace with all my heart.

407
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,626
That's so very touching to hear.

408
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:08,217
Permit me to share some womanly wisdom
with you on this very special day.

409
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:12,055
The more people you love,
the weaker you are.

410
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,392
You'll do things for them
that you know you shouldn't do…

411
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:20,813
you'll act the fool to make them happy,
to keep them safe.

412
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,987
Love no one but your children.
On that front, a mother has no choice.

413
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,534
But shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?

414
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,039
You can try…

415
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,084
little dove.

416
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,435
Who did you say
your mother was again?

417
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,606
-Cinda Lannister.
-Is she the fat one?

418
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,859
Well, perhaps she's gotten
a little larger than--

419
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:10,071
No, no, there's only one fat Lannister.

420
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,365
If she was your mother, you'd know it.

421
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,578
I squired for you once, you know.

422
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,373
When?

423
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,292
The tournament,
the day of Willem Frey's wedding.

424
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,922
-I went to Willem Frey's wedding?
-You did.

425
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,218
Your squire had gotten so drunk
the night before that he--

426
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:35,471
He threw up on his horse
on the way to the tourney grounds.

427
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,514
What was his name?

428
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,307
Bryan.

429
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,435
Poor lad.

430
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,396
That was my brother's doing,
I seem to recall.

431
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,775
I remember you.

432
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:51,112
You'd never squired for anyone before.

433
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:54,907
That's right. I ran up and volunteered.
You know, "Let me, my lord, let me!"

434
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,369
My father was furious…

435
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:03,458
afraid I'd embarrass our family
in front of The Family.

436
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,627
You didn't, though.

437
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,880
You really remember?

438
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,425
You knew when you were needed
and when to go away.

439
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,426
It's a rare talent.

440
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,638
Most of my squires, they mean well,

441
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,850
but young men with big jobs,
they tend to overdo them.

442
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,227
Well, when I think back to that day--

443
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,030
You were saying.

444
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:35,865
I--

445
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,077
Never mind. It's embarrassing.

446
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:44,332
More embarrassing than being chained
to a post and covered in your own shit?

447
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:50,296
I remember everything about that day.
Your helmet, your horse,

448
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,049
the rake lines in the dirt along the list.

449
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,009
Where the sun was in the sky

450
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,886
when you knocked Balon Swann
from his horse…

451
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,640
and the dent in your shield
when you handed it back to me…

452
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,644
I'll remember it all until I die.

453
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,898
It was the best day of my life.

454
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,569
And I remember being on the field…

455
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,822
after it was over.

456
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,908
All the competitors were done,
I was the last one out there…

457
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:22,912
but I couldn't leave.

458
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,708
I couldn't bring myself to go sit
with my family, at a table so far

459
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,127
on the edge of the feast
you could barely even see the bride.

460
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,589
And I couldn't bear to tell them
what it had been like squiring for you…

461
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,634
when I knew that they could never have
the faintest idea

462
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:37,718
what I was talking about.

463
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,431
-I understand completely.
-How could you?

464
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:48,563
Sorry, I didn't mean to doubt you,
it's just I--

465
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,856
I was 16, once.

466
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,193
I also had to replace
someone's squire on short notice.

467
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:58,239
-Which knight was it?
-Barristan Selmy.

468
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,452
The fight against the Kingswood outlaws.
Before your time.

469
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:06,581
What was he like?

470
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,002
He was…

471
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,005
a painter.

472
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,509
A painter who only used red.

473
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:26,934
I couldn't imagine being able to fight
like that, not back then.

474
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:32,190
And to help him do it,
to be a part of something that perfect--

475
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,903
I don't need to explain how that felt.
Not to you.

476
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,572
It's hard to put into words.

477
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:44,493
It's like stepping into a dream
you've been dreaming

478
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:48,289
for as long as you can remember,
and finding out the dream

479
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,041
is more real than your life.

480
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,463
Leaving that battlefield was…

481
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,716
like being dragged off to prison.

482
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,510
-Did you squire for him again?
-No.

483
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,764
I didn't have your gift.

484
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,643
He couldn't take a step
without stepping on me.

485
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,520
I was awful, a complete liability.

486
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:19,737
Until… one of the outlaws
decided to take on a 16-year-old squire.

487
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,536
It's a good thing I am who I am.

488
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,332
I'd have been useless at anything else.

489
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:40,716
I'm not well suited for imprisonment.
Shocking, I know.

490
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:42,635
Some men are.

491
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,553
Ned Stark…

492
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:49,058
I imagine he made an excellent prisoner
right up until the end.

493
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,102
Not me, though.

494
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,856
My life has left me uniquely unfit
for constraint.

495
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:02,488
-Then have you thought about--
-Of course. Every day.

496
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,198
And?

497
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:09,954
Good prisoners breed good jailers,
apparently.

498
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,081
The Starks are very careful.

499
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,210
There is a way, I think.

500
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,339
It wasn't possible until now.

501
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,508
What is it?

502
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,891
-It's actually quite simple.
-Well, let me help you.

503
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,687
-You'll only have to do one thing.
-Tell me.

504
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,567
You'll have to die.

505
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:34,914
Jorah the Andal.

506
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,293
This man must sail past Old Valyria.

507
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:43,506
All who travel too close to the Doom
must have protection.

508
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:47,843
-I didn't come here for lessons.
-No. You came for the dragons.

509
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,470
You have them?

510
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,473
Where are they?

511
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,558
Draw your sword.

512
00:39:56,393 --> 00:39:58,437
See what your steel is worth.

513
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,776
You want to please the Mother of Dragons.

514
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:11,951
You love her.

515
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,498
Where are the dragons?

516
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,669
Will you betray her again,
Jorah the Andal?

517
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,759
Will you betray her again?

518
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:32,847
Never.

519
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:43,440
The thief you seek… is with her now.

520
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,992
I did not leave the comfort of my home
to come to yours and be called a thief.

521
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:56,287
-No one is calling you a thief.
-Who is she to accuse us?

522
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,915
Please. They're my children.
I'm begging you.

523
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,878
Begging us? It wasn't very long ago
you were threatening us.

524
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,338
Without me, the dragons will die.

525
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,548
It will be for the best.

526
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:12,887
Your dragons will bring the world nothing
but death and misery, my dear.

527
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:16,056
If I knew where they were,
I would not tell you.

528
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,641
You are cruel, my friend.

529
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,436
The Mother of Dragons is in the right.

530
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:23,564
She must be reunited with her babies.

531
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,985
-I will help you, Khaleesi.
-How?

532
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,155
I will take you
to the House of the Undying.

533
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,032
Where I have put them.

534
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,243
You have my dragons?

535
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,495
When I learned you were coming
to our city,

536
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,707
I made an arrangement
with the King of Qarth.

537
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,044
He procured them for me.

538
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:48,672
-There is no King of Qarth.
-There is now.

539
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,132
That was the other half
of the arrangement.

540
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,263
You would keep your gates
and your minds closed

541
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,432
to everything outside your walls.

542
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:03,479
But Qarth cannot remain the greatest city
that ever was if it refuses to change.

543
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,856
I will open Qarth to the world,

544
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,859
as I have forced it to open itself to me.

545
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,613
Your ambition is an inspiration.

546
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,492
But like all upstarts, you overreach.

547
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,411
Three dragons the size of cats,

548
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:23,499
and an alliance with a charlatan
do not make you a king.

549
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,668
An upstart and a charlatan?

550
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,462
Empires have been built by less.

551
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,633
Those on the margins often come
to control the center.

552
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,887
And those in the center make room
for them, willingly or otherwise.

553
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,311
The Mother of Dragons will be
with her babies.

554
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:50,067
She will give them her love
and they will thrive by her side.

555
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:54,738
Forever.

556
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,011
A mother should be with her children.

557
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,975
Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn?

558
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,395
Your dragons wait for you
in the House of the Undying.

559
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:28,397
Come see them.

560
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,908
-Lady Stark!
-No farther.

561
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,036
Keep your hands off me, woman.

562
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:45,372
Don't enter without an invitation, man.

563
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:50,210
-Forgive me. Lady Stark.
-What is it?

564
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,795
They caught the Kingslayer.

565
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,593
-Kingslayer!
-Kingslayer!

566
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,094
Hang the fucking Kingslayer!

567
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,137
-Hang him!
-Hang him!

568
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,726
You'll die today.

569
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,103
Justice for the Karstark!

570
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,925
Step back! I want his head!

571
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:44,098
Any man who steps between a father
and his vengeance asks for death!

572
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,224
Lord Karstark!

573
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,644
This man is our prisoner.

574
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,773
-This monster killed my son.
-And crippled mine.

575
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:57,277
He will answer for his crimes,
I promise you. But not here.

576
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,613
I will have his head.
And if you try and stop me--

577
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:03,784
You will strike me down?
Have you forgotten me, ser?

578
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:07,079
I am the widow
of your liege lord Eddard Stark.

579
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:09,790
-I am the mother of your king.
-And where is our king now?

580
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:10,958
You know very well.

581
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,085
He has gone to the Crag
to accept the surrender.

582
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:16,463
Aye, gone to the Crag,
but not to negotiate.

583
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:19,633
-He brought that foreign bitch with him.
-How dare you?

584
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:21,802
Threatening my lady is an act of treason!

585
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,972
Treason? How can it be treason
to kill Lannisters?

586
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:28,684
I understand your grief, my lord.
Better than most, I understand it.

587
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:34,148
But in the name of my son,
the King in the North, stand down.

588
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,862
When your son returns,
I will demand this murderer's head.

589
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,322
Wise men do not make demands of kings.

590
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:47,077
Fathers who loved their sons do.
I will have his head.

591
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,624
Thank you for fighting on my behalf,
Lady Stark.

592
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:56,920
-I would have come to your defense, but--
-Take him to the stockade.

593
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,715
Bind him with every chain you can find.

594
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,759
You've become a real she wolf
in your later years.

595
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:05,053
-There's not much fish left in you.
-And gag him!

596
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,478
Since when do you light your own candles?

597
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:16,607
Since I decided I can't stand
to look at any of my handmaidens

598
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,150
for another instant.

599
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:23,363
How many times can you read
one raven scroll?

600
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:28,035
Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been
spotted sailing north, past Tarth.

601
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,871
-Two hundred ships.
-More than we have.

602
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,582
Yes. That's more than we have.

603
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,586
He'll be at our gates within five days.
Four, if he has the wind.

604
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,713
We have strong, high walls.

605
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,258
We'll rain fire down on them from above.

606
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,971
Rain fire on them from above?
You're quoting father, aren't you?

607
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:51,350
Why not? He has a good mind for strategy,
doesn't he?

608
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:55,896
I'd call it tactics, not strategy,
but yes, he does have a good mind for it.

609
00:46:56,605 --> 00:47:00,150
The best mind, some would say.
Sadly, he's not here.

610
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,153
It's just you, me and Joffrey,

611
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:07,574
the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

612
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:13,539
-I'm sure you'll make a point, eventually.
-He needs to start acting like a king.

613
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:16,792
This war you started is coming
to our doorstep.

614
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:20,045
And if the entire city
wants Joffrey dead--

615
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,130
I'm not the one giving the boy whores
to abuse.

616
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:24,633
I thought the girls might help him.

617
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,260
-Did you?
-I was wrong.

618
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:31,014
If we can't control him--

619
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,517
Do you think I haven't tried?

620
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,855
He doesn't listen to me.

621
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:46,029
It's hard to put a leash on a dog
once you've put a crown on its head.

622
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,910
I always hoped he would be like Jaime.

623
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:55,831
He looks like him…

624
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:01,169
in a certain light.

625
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,175
The boy's more Robert than Jaime.

626
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,304
Robert was a drunken fool,
but he didn't enjoy cruelty.

627
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:14,850
Sometimes I wonder--

628
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,144
What?

629
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:19,938
If this is the price.

630
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,150
For what we've done.

631
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:25,444
For our sins.

632
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,487
Sins?

633
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,074
-The Targaryens--
-Wed brother and sister

634
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,576
for hundreds of years, I know.

635
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,122
That's what Jaime and I
would say to each other,

636
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:38,248
in our moments of doubt.

637
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:42,419
That's what I told Ned Stark
when he was stupid enough to confront me.

638
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,007
Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they?

639
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,051
What's the saying?

640
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:52,471
"Every time a Targaryen is born,
the Gods flip a coin."

641
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,390
You've beaten the odds.

642
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:59,978
Tommen and Myrcella are good,
decent children. Both of them.

643
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:31,802
-Then why wait?
-We swore to the King!

644
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:34,262
-There's lots of kings!
-That's treason!

645
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,889
So's saving Lannisters!

646
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:38,225
-Yeah, back off, you!
-No, I won't!

647
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,351
Don't you say a word…

648
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,311
Your son returns at dawn, my lady?

649
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:45,023
-So they say.
-Kingslayer won't last the night.

650
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,860
The more they drink,
the angrier they'll get.

651
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:55,158
And when the Karstarks draw their swords,
who wants to die defending a Lannister?

652
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:57,786
Come.

653
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,752
He'll not be making it through the night.

654
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:17,472
-I need to be alone with him.
-My lady, our orders--

655
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:21,810
Your orders, which I just gave you,
are to leave me alone with him.

656
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:29,526
Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark?

657
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:33,155
I believe it's my last night
in this world.

658
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:37,951
-Is that a woman?
-Do you hear them out there?

659
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:40,829
They want your head.

660
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,417
Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.

661
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:50,088
-You strangled his son with your chains.
-Oh, oh.

662
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,507
Was he the one on guard duty?

663
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:58,472
He was in my way.
Any knight would have done the same.

664
00:50:58,555 --> 00:50:59,765
You are no knight.

665
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:03,310
You've forsaken every vow you ever took.

666
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,519
So many vows.

667
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,855
They make you swear and swear.

668
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:11,234
Defend the king. Obey the king.
Obey your father.

669
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,737
Protect the innocent. Defend the weak.

670
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,365
Well, what if your father
despises the king?

671
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:23,413
What if the king massacres the innocent?
It's too much.

672
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:27,709
No matter what you do,
you're forsaking one vow or another.

673
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,670
Where did you find this beast?

674
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,925
She is a truer knight
than you'll ever be…

675
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,512
-Kingslayer.
-Kingslayer.

676
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,848
What a king he was!

677
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:45,977
Here's to Aerys Targaryen,
the second of his name,

678
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,897
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
Protector of the Realm!

679
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:52,234
And to the sword I shoved in his back.

680
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,321
You are a man without honor.

681
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:03,453
Do you know… I've never been
with any woman but Cersei?

682
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:05,997
So in my own way…

683
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,750
I've had more honor than…

684
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,962
poor old dead Ned.

685
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,383
What was the name
of that bastard he fathered?

686
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,093
-Brienne.
-No, that wasn't it.

687
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:23,139
Snow. A bastard from the North.

688
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:29,312
Now when, when good old Ned came home
with some whore's baby,

689
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,065
did you pretend to love it?

690
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:34,776
No,

691
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,153
you're not very good at pretending.

692
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,114
You're an honest woman.

693
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,701
You hated that boy, didn't you?

694
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:45,078
How could you not hate him?

695
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:52,210
The walking, talking reminder
that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark

696
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:53,962
fucked another woman.

697
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:58,383
Your sword.

698
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,932
I told you what would happen.

699
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:08,643
All of you.

700
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:14,107
I told you what would happen
if you served me loyally.

701
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,360
And what would happen if you did not.

702
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,989
What are you doing? What have you done?

703
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:24,326
...still question whether
your new lord means what he says.

704
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,539
Here is the answer to your question.

705
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:42,385
No!
