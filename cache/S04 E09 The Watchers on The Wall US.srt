1
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:26,813
What was she like?

2
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,359
She...

3
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:35,822
she had red hair.

4
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:39,659
Oh?

5
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,579
-How big were her feet?
-What do you want me to say?

6
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,832
I want you to tell me
what it was like to have someone.

7
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,752
To be with someone. To love
someone and have them love you back.

8
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:57,135
We're all gonna die
a lot sooner than I'd planned.

9
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,471
You're the closest
I'll ever get to knowing.

10
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,686
-So, you and Gilly never...
-No.

11
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,771
She just had a baby.

12
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,526
And she never offered.

13
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,528
But if she had...

14
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,406
you would have?

15
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,159
You'd have broken your vows?

16
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,457
The interesting thing is...

17
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:32,629
our vows never specifically
forbid intimate relations with women.

18
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,505
What?

19
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,842
"I shall take no wife," yes,
that's in there. There's no denying that.

20
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,386
"I shall father no children."
It's very specific.

21
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,765
But what our vows
have to say about other...

22
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,267
activities is open to interpretation.

23
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,648
I don't think Ser Alliser
cares much for interpretation.

24
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,447
Anyway, there's nothing for him
to interpret.

25
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,115
We didn't.

26
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,245
So, what's it like?

27
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,291
It's...

28
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:12,961
there's this person...

29
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,004
this whole other person.

30
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,008
And you're wrapped up in them
and they're wrapped up in you and...

31
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:20,969
You...

32
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:22,929
for a little...

33
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,598
for a little while,
you're more than just you.

34
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,893
You're... I don't know.
I'm not a bleeding poet.

35
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:29,894
No, you're really not.

36
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,355
What did I get for it?

37
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,941
An arrow six inches from my heart.

38
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,529
There'll be arrows
for all of us soon, I imagine.

39
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:40,989
There will.

40
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,409
They've already done the worst thing
to me they could ever do.

41
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,122
Go get some sleep, Sam.

42
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,332
I'll take this watch.

43
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,377
Did I ever tell you about her?

44
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,796
My Sheila?

45
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,798
Yes.

46
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,051
That was a night to remember.

47
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,471
Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink.

48
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:51,726
Her fangs were sharp,
but she knew how to use them.

49
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,563
And she was nice and soft down below.

50
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,483
No, she was no ordinary beast.

51
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,153
-Many is the man who--
-I know you never fucked a bear.

52
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,614
You know you never fucked a bear.

53
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,326
Right now, I don't wanna think
about the bear you never fucked.

54
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,370
Right now, all I want to think

55
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,457
about is each one of these arrows finding
its way into a crow's heart.

56
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,461
-We could be waiting here a while.
-Good.

57
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,422
The longer we wait,
the more arrows I'll have.

58
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,470
Where they came up here

59
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,557
to our land and put up a big wall
and said it was theirs.

60
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,559
Then they started hunting us down.

61
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,271
This time,

62
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,232
we're the ones doing the hunting.

63
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,069
You've got a lot to say about killing...

64
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,738
Even more words than arrows.

65
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,368
Back in those villages, I killed
just as many of them as you did.

66
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,621
-More, I reckon.
-Yes,

67
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,791
but none of those were your crow lover.

68
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,669
-I probably killed him already.
-So you've said.

69
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,295
And if not,

70
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,133
the only thing left of him
is gonna be his fun bits

71
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,093
-hanging around my neck.
-And more words.

72
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,971
Know what I think you do
when you see him?

73
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,267
Serve him up
a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.

74
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,148
What, you been thinking
about that ginger minge?

75
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,818
Wondering what it tastes like?

76
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,989
Maybe I have.

77
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,659
Jon Snow is mine.

78
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,163
Anyone else tries to kill him,

79
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,290
I'll have an arrow for them.

80
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,589
And not one of your bald friends
is fast enough to stop me.

81
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:10,865
And what is it that couldn't wait
until morning, Tarly?

82
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:11,949
Maester Aemon.

83
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,328
-How did you know--
-That it was you?

84
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:19,665
Who else but Samwell Tarly
would be wasting candles

85
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,293
to read in the middle of the night?

86
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,674
-Let me help you.
-No need.

87
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,386
I know my way around this library

88
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,889
better than any other place
in Castle Black.

89
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,143
Thousands of books
and no eyes to read them.

90
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:45,358
Old age is a wonderful source of ironies
if nothing else.

91
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:48,069
But you didn't answer my question.

92
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,112
What are you reading?

93
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:55,243
-Maester Faull.
-The wildlings.

94
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,497
I can assure you
that the closest Maester Faull

95
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,667
ever got to a wildling
was this very library.

96
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,127
But what he says about what they do,

97
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,255
it's all true.

98
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,675
It's exactly what the survivors
of their raids report.

99
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:15,221
Yes, imagine the stories wildlings
tell about us.

100
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,684
Love is the death of duty.

101
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,813
I told that to your friend Jon Snow once.

102
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,398
He didn't listen,

103
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,692
and neither did you.

104
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,988
Which is why you've abandoned
your watch atop the Wall

105
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:36,158
to come here
and read about the terrible things

106
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,787
that may have happened
to the girl you love.

107
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,249
I don't... love her.

108
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,667
-Yes, you do.
-No.

109
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,669
Yes, you do.

110
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,673
Heard it in your voice
when you first brought her to me.

111
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,800
I remember how it sounds.

112
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,345
-I was in love once.
-You were?

113
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:03,561
You can imagine all manner of horrors
befalling that poor girl and her child.

114
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:08,274
Is it so difficult to imagine
that an old person was once,

115
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,111
-more or less, like you?
-I'm sorry, Maester.

116
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,031
I didn't mean it like that.

117
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,326
Do you know who I was
before I came here?

118
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,788
What I could have been
if I'd only said the word?

119
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,708
Of course, you do.

120
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,087
I met many girls
when I was Aemon Targaryen.

121
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,674
A future king always does.

122
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:40,431
Some of them were quite forward
in their attempts to win my affections.

123
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,517
One of them succeeded.

124
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,520
I was very young.

125
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,315
Who was she?

126
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,778
I could tell you everything about her.

127
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,073
Who she was, how we met,

128
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,658
the color of her eyes,

129
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,078
and the shape of her nose.

130
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,915
I can see her...

131
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,418
right in front of me.

132
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,255
She's more real than you are.

133
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:22,014
We could spend all night
trading tales of lost loves.

134
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,518
Nothing makes the past
a sweeter place to visit

135
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,312
than the prospect of imminent death.

136
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,815
Go to bed, Tarly.

137
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,657
I'm sorry, I can't open
the gate for anybody. Orders.

138
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,909
You don't understand.
They killed everyone.

139
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,869
Everyone but me and my baby.

140
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,330
They're out there.
I saw them on my way here.

141
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,666
They may have seen me.
They may have followed me. Please.

142
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:49,917
I'm sorry, I can't.

143
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,919
If they find us out here,
you don't know what they'll do.

144
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,379
Pyp! Open the gate.

145
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,257
-I can't.
-Sam, is that you?

146
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,258
Yes.

147
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,302
Thorne gave me strict orders
to not open the gate.

148
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,596
Oh, Pyp, open the fucking gate!

149
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,893
-I never heard you curse before.
-Yes, well, best get used to it.

150
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,276
Are you all right?

151
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,698
Are you all right? Yeah.

152
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,368
Of course, you are, my brave little fella.

153
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,163
-It was horrible.
-I'm so, so sorry.

154
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,666
-I didn't know until I got back.
-Don't let them send me away, Sam.

155
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,585
-Never.
-I know there's no women allowed.

156
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,629
Anyone who tries to throw you out
will be having words with me.

157
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,799
From now on, wherever you go...

158
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,260
I go, too.

159
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,813
Get ready!

160
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,649
-Man the gate!
-Ready yourselves!

161
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,487
-Make haste! Prepare!
-Up on the Wall!

162
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,822
Quickly! Up! Up!

163
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,492
How many? How many are there?

164
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,621
Beyond the trees!

165
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,293
It's time.

166
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,593
-Light them up!
-Light them all!

167
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:14,937
Move!

168
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,235
Pick up the pace! Come on, come on.

169
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,786
Here we go, boys, there's one.

170
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,956
Let's go. There's two.

171
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,294
Let's get the next load.

172
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:44,508
That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser.

173
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,928
A hundred-thousand you say?

174
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,222
Yes, Ser.

175
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,183
You can say it if you like.

176
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,021
We should have sealed the tunnel
while we had the chance,

177
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,231
like you suggested.

178
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,485
It was a difficult decision
either way, Ser.

179
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,116
Do you know
what leadership means, Lord Snow?

180
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,995
It means that the person
in charge gets second-guessed

181
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,997
by every clever little twat with a mouth.

182
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,916
But if he starts
second-guessing himself,

183
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,209
that's the end,

184
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,213
for him, for the clever little twats,

185
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,049
for everyone.

186
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,968
This is not the end. Not for us.

187
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,220
Not if you lot do your duty

188
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,389
for however long it takes
to beat them back.

189
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,019
And then you get to go on hating me

190
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:41,148
and I get to go on wishing your wildling
whore had finished the job.

191
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:06,298
You'll be safe down here.

192
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,467
I'll check on you as soon as I can.

193
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,220
You're leaving me again?

194
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:14,223
I'm not leaving you.

195
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,476
You're going up there and we're staying
down here. That's leaving.

196
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,561
You said from now on we'd stay together.

197
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:23,774
-I didn't mean in the same room.
-What are you going to do out there?

198
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,067
-Help my brothers.
-How?

199
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,946
You're going to fight
the free folk when they come?

200
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,949
They'll kill you. In Mole's Town,
they killed everyone.

201
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:35,494
I can't just hide here with you
while they're fighting out there.

202
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:39,415
Why not? You won't matter up there.
You will down here.

203
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,961
I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly.

204
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:47,881
I made a promise to defend the Wall
and I have to keep it

205
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,551
because that's what men do.

206
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,482
Promise me you won't die.

207
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,655
I promise you I won't die.

208
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,276
There's a lot more wildlings on the other
side of the Wall than this side.

209
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,612
We've got loads of weapons and things.

210
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:56,074
-It's the perfect place for us to be.
-I've never thrown a spear before.

211
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,203
I've never held a sword
with a proper edge.

212
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,039
This is no place for me to be.

213
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,711
-You're not afraid?
-Of course, I'm afraid.

214
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,380
There's a band of wildlings
coming to kill us.

215
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,132
If you're afraid of a band of wildlings,

216
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,343
how in seven hells
did you manage to kill a White Walker?

217
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,227
I didn't know I was going to kill it.

218
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:26,230
But I had to do something.
I didn't have any choice.

219
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,273
It was going to kill Gilly
and take the baby.

220
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:34,571
If someone had asked me my name
right then, I wouldn't have known.

221
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,910
I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore.

222
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:45,124
I wasn't a steward in the Night's Watch
or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that.

223
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,168
I was nothing at all.

224
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,256
And when you're nothing at all...

225
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,259
there's no more reason to be afraid.

226
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,762
But you're afraid now?

227
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,223
Yes, well...

228
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,227
I'm not nothing anymore.

229
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,498
Most of their men are up top.

230
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,668
Didn't count more than 20 down here.
Leftovers.

231
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,962
They got a big fat one and a little
bony one manning the front.

232
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,298
-How high are the walls?
-Well, we'll be up and over

233
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,591
before they know what's happened.

234
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,012
Let's kill some crows!

235
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,515
Come on!

236
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,076
Come on, brothers!

237
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,905
Archers nock. Everyone else hold.

238
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,741
Grenn, no!

239
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,831
I said nock and hold, you cunts!

240
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,084
-Does nock mean draw?
-No, Ser!

241
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,462
-Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?
-No, Ser!

242
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,590
-You all plan to die here tonight?
-No, Ser!

243
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,093
That's very good to hear. Draw!

244
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,224
No, down below!

245
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,069
Draw! Light them up.

246
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:20,338
-Come on, get up!
-They're attacking the southern gate!

247
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,132
-Now?
-Now.

248
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,765
I'm going down there.
Brother Slynt, you have the Wall.

249
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,766
What?

250
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,270
What are you fucking waiting for? Loose!

251
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,732
You heard the man. Loose!

252
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,896
You, over there.

253
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:23,735
-Did you get one?
-No.

254
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,615
Shit Pyp! Shit.

255
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,825
-Sam.
-Yeah?

256
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,201
I think we're gonna die.

257
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,537
If you keep missing, we will.

258
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,507
Come on! Come on!

259
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,763
Brothers!

260
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:56,017
A hundred generations
have defended this castle.

261
00:23:56,726 --> 00:24:00,147
She's never fallen before.
She will not fall tonight.

262
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,858
Those are Thenns at our walls.

263
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,944
They eat the flesh of the men they kill.

264
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,156
Do you want to fill
the belly of a Thenn tonight?

265
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,950
-No!
-Tonight we fight.

266
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:16,413
And when the sun rises, I promise you,
Castle Black will stand!

267
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,833
The Night's Watch will stand.

268
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:26,089
With me now! Now with me!

269
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,940
No discipline. No training.

270
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,692
Gang of thieves, that's all this is.

271
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,403
I commanded the City Watch
of King's Landing.

272
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,322
Those men obeyed orders.

273
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,574
We can't just let them attack the gate!

274
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,953
The bars of those gates
are four inches of cold-rolled steel.

275
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,538
Those are giants
riding mammoths down there!

276
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,958
Do you think your cold-rolled steel
is gonna stop them?

277
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,084
No such thing as giants.

278
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,461
A story for the children.

279
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:49,965
Brother Slynt.

280
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,009
We just got word that Ser Alliser
needs you below.

281
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,348
You're the most experienced man
he's got, Ser, and he needs you.

282
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:00,684
Needed below?

283
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,852
Yes. Yes.

284
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:16,199
Archers, nock your arrows!

285
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,826
Nock arrows!

286
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,120
Draw!

287
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,623
Loose!

288
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,181
They won't summit before dawn.

289
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,393
-How do you know that?
-Because I've made that climb.

290
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,645
I think they're in a bigger hurry
than you were.

291
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,902
Hold the bridge! Hold, wait for it!

292
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:55,739
Come on with the rocks!

293
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,371
Nock!

294
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,458
Draw!

295
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,546
Loose!

296
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,275
Down!

297
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,478
No! No!

298
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,083
To the gate. Come on, let's move.

299
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:34,754
It's gonna open.

300
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,863
I got one right through the heart.
He's dead.

301
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,407
-Oh, is it over?
-No.

302
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:45,700
Well, then...

303
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,753
You're all right. You're all right.

304
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:01,341
-I'll get help.
-No!

305
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:07,305
Maester Aemon is coming.
He's gonna make it all right.

306
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,486
-Now.
-Now!

307
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,372
The outer gate won't hold.

308
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,959
-Take five men, hold the inner gate.
-Aye.

309
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:04,922
Hold the gate.

310
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,258
If they make it through...

311
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,471
They won't.

312
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,559
Come on, Hill. And you, Cooper.

313
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,561
You three, on me.

314
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:21,522
Come on, you lazy bastards.

315
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,236
Oil.

316
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,573
Oil on the ramp!

317
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,793
Protect the gate!

318
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,328
Get him inside.

319
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:24,836
Hold the fucking gate! Hold it!

320
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,606
-We need more men down here.
-We have to hold the gate.

321
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:30,193
-But we need men here.
-Tell Jon. He's in command.

322
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,652
Let's go.

323
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,414
Get me to the top! You hear me?

324
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,421
Your name's Olly, right?

325
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,925
Listen to me, Olly. Get me to the top.

326
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,928
And when we give the signal,
bring us back down.

327
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,555
You hear me?

328
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,854
Find a weapon, Olly. Fight them.

329
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,014
Clear the way! Let's go!

330
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,308
-Out of the way!
-Get out of here!

331
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,243
Cut the rope!

332
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,544
Wait! No!

333
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,311
We need more archers.

334
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,771
-Come on.
-Quickly.

335
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,109
What are you doing up here?

336
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,403
The wildlings are over the walls.

337
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,866
Ser Alliser's fallen.
The castle won't stand much longer.

338
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:44,994
Edd...

339
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:46,829
you have the Wall.

340
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,709
If they try the mammoths again,
drop fire on them.

341
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,462
If the climbers get too high,
drop the scythe on them.

342
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,345
-Come on, let's go.
-Come, brothers. Now fight with me!

343
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,307
Might as well enjoy our last night,
right, boys?

344
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,226
Light the fuckers up!

345
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,063
Nock! Draw!

346
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,857
Loose!

347
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,744
-How are we gonna stop that?
-Shot 20 arrows in him already.

348
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:29,246
-You heard Jon. We hold the gate.
-Jon Snow's not Lord Commander.

349
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,498
We hold the gate!

350
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:42,551
Mother, save me. Father, save me.

351
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,346
The Gods aren't down here.
It's the six of us. You hear me?

352
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,188
-No, please.
-Night gathers and now my watch begins.

353
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:56,023
It shall not end until my death.

354
00:37:56,774 --> 00:38:00,361
I shall take no wife,
hold no lands, father no children.

355
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,322
-I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.
-And win no glory.

356
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,658
I shall live and die by my post.

357
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,535
I am the sword in the darkness.

358
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,370
I am the watcher on the walls.

359
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,415
I am the shield
that guards the realms of men.

360
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:16,168
I pledge my life and honor
to the Night's Watch

361
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,255
for this night and all the nights to come!

362
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:28,556
-I don't want you out there.
-You can't protect me forever.

363
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,725
There won't be anywhere
to hide if the castle falls.

364
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,397
I need him more than I need you.

365
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,555
We need you, boy.

366
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:15,908
-Jon Snow.
-Hush. Don't talk.

367
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,039
Do you remember the cave?

368
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,755
We should have stayed in the cave.

369
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,386
We'll go back there.

370
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:45,271
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

371
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,808
Drop the scythe, boys!

372
00:43:45,622 --> 00:43:47,541
-Hoist her up.
-Hoist her up!

373
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,841
They've had enough for one night.

374
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,930
Don't cheer too loud.

375
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,268
They still outnumber us 1,000 to one.

376
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,195
Tormund,

377
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,113
it's over.

378
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:20,824
Let it end.

379
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,077
This is how a man ends.

380
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,628
Put him in chains.

381
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:34,922
We'll question him later.

382
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:39,676
I should have thrown you

383
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,971
from the top of the Wall, boy!

384
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,140
Aye...

385
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:47,559
You should have.

386
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,361
Whoa, it's me. It's me.

387
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:02,991
I promised you, didn't I?

388
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:19,591
We held them off.

389
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:21,677
For one night.

390
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,554
This is a great victory.

391
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,056
A great victory?

392
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:31,687
Mance was testing our defenses.
He almost made it through.

393
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,731
And he has more giants.
He has more mammoths.

394
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,192
He has 1,000 times as many men.

395
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,906
They'll hit us again tonight.

396
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,910
Maybe we can hold them off for a day
or two, but we'll never beat them.

397
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,874
-Where are we going?
-Going to find Mance.

398
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:56,336
To fi... you can't do that.
No one gave you any orders.

399
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,506
Who's left to give orders?

400
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:03,469
The wildling army's
only an army because of Mance.

401
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:08,348
He united 100 warring tribes.
Without Mance, they lose their leader.

402
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:11,185
They lose their purpose.
They go back to fighting each other.

403
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,603
Scatter back to their homes.

404
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,480
Without Mance?

405
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,858
-You're going to kill him?
-I'm gonna try.

406
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,860
They'll never let you
within 100 yards of him.

407
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,237
And even if they did,
even if you managed to kill him--

408
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,656
They'll kill me? If I don't go,
they'll kill me anyway.

409
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,451
-They'll kill the rest of us, too.
-They won't just kill you.

410
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:31,622
They'll boil you. They'll flay you.
They'll make it last days.

411
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,084
You're right...

412
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,212
It's a bad plan.

413
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,049
What's your plan?

414
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,261
They held the gate.

415
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,231
Get some brothers down here to help you.

416
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,485
We need to burn the bodies.

417
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:06,717
Raise the outer gate.

418
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:09,970
Then lower it again as soon as I'm out.

419
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,568
-What are you doing?
-I promised Mormont

420
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:25,694
I'd never lose it again.

421
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:31,867
In case I don't come back.

422
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:41,960
Jon.

423
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:48,759
Come back.
