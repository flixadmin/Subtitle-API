1
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:08,507
Announcer: Ladies and
gentlemen, please welcome

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,909
the dark hand!

3
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,711
(Hard rock playing)

4
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:31,864
Hello, Cleveland!

5
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:46,211
Get down! Get funky!

6
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,119
It's the seventies!

7
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,426
(Helicopter approaching)

8
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,000
(Feedback echoes)

9
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:10,536
We're not even
doing anything
wrong.

10
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:12,237
You were off-key.

11
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,273
Chan!

12
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:15,607
(Gasping)

13
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:21,113
I gotta get away
from chan.

14
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:23,382
I <i> will</i> get away
from chan.

15
00:01:23,384 --> 00:01:26,151
No more dark hand
means no more chan.

16
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:28,620
I'll start my own
crime syndicate.

17
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:32,925
Look out world!
Finn's goin' solo!

18
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,726
(Crickets chirping)

19
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,166
Uh, first thing
in the morning.

20
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:40,025
Is this late huang dynasty
or early ming?

21
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,694
Um...
It is from China.

22
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,530
(Sighs)

23
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:47,065
Ow!
- You are
a terrible salesman!

24
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,201
You must know
the merchandise!

25
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:50,269
Uncle's right,
tohru.

26
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:51,570
For example...

27
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:54,673
This lovely lamp
is from the
junk dynasty.

28
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,275
You are not helping, Jade.

29
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:58,076
Uncle: You need
sales training!

30
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,545
Jackie will assist.

31
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:00,679
I will?

32
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,648
And Jade will
mind the store.

33
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,815
Cool!

34
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,051
Do I get paid?

35
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,453
Sell something,
and we will talk.

36
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,359
Let the sell-a-thon
begin!

37
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,594
Welcome to uncle's rare--

38
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,429
take it! It's yours.

39
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,498
Oh, no, you don't!

40
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,134
I'm not taking
this thing.

41
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:24,169
Unless you
buy something.

42
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:25,938
Whew.

43
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,774
Uh, how much?

44
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,076
500 bucks?

45
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,711
Deal.

46
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,184
Whoo hoo! Yeah!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

47
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,053
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!

48
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,921
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!

49
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,693
What's <i> he</i>
so happy about?

50
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:50,696
Uh, note
the hand-painted
details

51
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:53,765
and, um, ahem,
duck shape.

52
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,235
How nice.
I will take 2.

53
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,003
Ai-yah!

54
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:00,539
Tohru, you must
mention its age,

55
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,175
and, Jackie,
I did not believe
your performance

56
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:04,376
for a second.

57
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:05,811
Jade: Oh, uncle!

58
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,813
Somebody made a sale.

59
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:09,381
Ohh!
- Jade!

60
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:10,649
(Sighs)

61
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:13,218
But wait!
I also made
an acquisition.

62
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,120
(Gasps)

63
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,090
Uncle: Ai-yah!

64
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,258
(Echoing)
Ai-yah!

65
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,525
Ai-yah!

66
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,098
Infamous emerald
of killarney.

67
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,900
Feared throughout
the world.

68
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:30,335
Uh, feared?

69
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,971
That stone carries
an Irish curse,

70
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:36,775
bringing endless
bad luck to whomever
possesses it.

71
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,777
Ohh, Jade,
you are cursed!

72
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,682
Really?
I don't feel cur--
(Gasps)

73
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,419
I'm cursed!

74
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:50,255
One accident
does not make
a curse, Jade.

75
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:52,724
Uncle
is just being
superstitious--

76
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,095
aah!

77
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,870
I'm not saying
I believe
in this curse,

78
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:06,938
but perhaps
you should
give me that.

79
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,473
Just in case.

80
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:10,842
Did you see--

81
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,678
(cell phone rings)

82
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,279
Hello?

83
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,748
I'm bankrupt?! How
is that possible?

84
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,849
(Gasps)

85
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,584
(Softly)
The curse.

86
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,893
Ohh!

87
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,296
(Sighs)
Next.

88
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:32,531
Grrrr!

89
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,034
Oh! Ha ha ha.

90
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,202
Next.

91
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,251
(Sighs)

92
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,087
How can I launch
my solo career

93
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:56,621
without decent henchmen?

94
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,790
Chow: You're still
lookin' for muscle?

95
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,792
'Cause we're
lookin' for work.

96
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:03,362
After you quit,
we told valmont

97
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:06,231
he'd better give us raises,
or we'd quit, too!

98
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,100
And now you guys
want to work for me?

99
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:10,602
That is so c--
I mean, that's cool.

100
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,505
So, what's the job,
Finn?

101
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:15,207
Uh, call me boss.

102
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,580
There's a certain
priceless gem I've
been tracking...

103
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,081
And I've just
met somebody

104
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,217
who knows
where to find it.

105
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,785
(Muffled)
Help!

106
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,758
Is this
really necessary?

107
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,559
You possess
the emerald now,

108
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,862
so you possess
the curse!

109
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:39,431
We must make certain
nothing bad happens to you.

110
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:42,367
Uncle, this <i> is</i>
something bad.

111
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:45,237
You cannot
pass your troubles
to someone else, Jackie.

112
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:48,907
You must Bear the curse
alone until I am able
to break it!

113
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,208
I understand, uncle.

114
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,810
But...

115
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:53,044
(Grunts)

116
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,780
I...Maxed out
my library card.

117
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:57,949
Everything
they got on
Irish legends.

118
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:00,118
<i>Antique selling</i>
<i>for dummies?</i>

119
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,121
Ah, that one is mine.

120
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:06,958
Where's Jackie?

121
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,460
Ha-chaa!

122
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,195
The curse
is transferred

123
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:12,697
when the emerald
changes hands.

124
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:15,934
Only if the exchange
is made willingly.

125
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,336
I had to agree
to take it.

126
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:21,206
That's why
- Mr. jitters was so eager
to make a deal.

127
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,474
One more thing.

128
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:24,843
The curse
may only be broken

129
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:27,245
by returning
the emerald
to Ireland

130
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:30,248
to the tomb
from which it
was stolen.

131
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,350
(Knocking on
cupboard door)

132
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:34,453
Jackie:
Can I come out now?

133
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:38,990
Jade:
I got you into this.

134
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,926
At least let me
help get you out.

135
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,894
Besides, you can't
go to Ireland by yourself.

136
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,229
You're cursed.

137
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,565
I can handle
- a little bad luck, Jade.

138
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:49,367
Uncle: Not without
uncle's lucky charms.

139
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:53,371
Garlic.
Good for digestion
and for luck.

140
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:55,407
One more thing--

141
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,842
rabbit's feet.

142
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:59,744
They work better
when they are still
on the rabbit.

143
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:02,814
And keep these with you
at all times, or else.

144
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,718
Or else what?

145
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,820
The rabbit
will get hungry!

146
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,331
Ahh. So far, so good.

147
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,534
Taxi!

148
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:24,035
Oh! Hey!

149
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,071
Uh, stop! Wait!

150
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:27,506
Here, bunny, bunny.

151
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:28,807
Aah! Oh!

152
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,709
Hey, look out!

153
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,110
Watch it, fella!
Sorry!

154
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,245
Unh.

155
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,381
Aah!

156
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,821
Aah!

157
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:43,955
Unh.

158
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,994
Oh, if I don't
break this curse,

159
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:50,562
it may break--

160
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:00,605
uh...

161
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,376
The airport, please.

162
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,682
Th-that's where
I unloaded the emerald.

163
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:13,018
Chan?!
He has
the stone?

164
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,086
Of all the rotten luck!

165
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,488
Maybe we should
track down

166
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,156
a different emerald.

167
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,858
Yo, I'm the boss,

168
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,160
and I say we're
gettin' <i> this</i> emerald.

169
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,395
Hey, maybe chan
was too much

170
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,462
for the dark hand,

171
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,765
but we are
the Finn experience.

172
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,802
Look, trust me,
you don't want
that thing.

173
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,437
There's an Irish
curse on it.

174
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:33,505
There is?

175
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:35,340
Yeah, what,
the curse of killarney?

176
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,242
Hey, I'm Irish,
and every Irish dude

177
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,945
knows that curse
is a bunch of blarney.

178
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,252
Let's nail him!

179
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,521
Hey, who's
the boss here?

180
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,122
Let's nail him!

181
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,364
Man: Look out!

182
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:08,640
No bad luck.
No bad luck.

183
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:09,708
No bad luck.
No bad luck.

184
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,009
No--unh.

185
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,713
Could you please
raise your--

186
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:15,814
no.

187
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,354
Ahh.

188
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,723
Ireland. I made it
in one piece.

189
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,758
Huh?

190
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,027
Jade?

191
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,729
Uncle may
go for garlic
and rabbits,

192
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:31,796
but we both know

193
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,732
I'm your <i> real</i>
good luck charm.

194
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:36,501
Jade, you are going back
right now--ow!

195
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:37,902
Top o' the
morning to ya.

196
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,971
You're going back--ow!

197
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,406
You're--ow!

198
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,608
Why does everyone
keep doing that?

199
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,443
'Cause this is Ireland.

200
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,846
Jade: You're not
wearing green...

201
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,750
And it's kind of
St. Patrick's day.

202
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,488
Jackie: Ow!

203
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,656
I should have--ow--

204
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,357
known the airline
would--ow--

205
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,192
lose my luggage--ow!

206
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,462
Come on, let's
get you some green.

207
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,431
(Cell phone rings)

208
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:07,599
Hello?

209
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:08,700
Uncle: Jackie,

210
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:10,835
I have been doing
more research.

211
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:11,970
Tohru is performing

212
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:14,105
an Irish good luck
spell for you.

213
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,173
Is it working?

214
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,708
I don't--ow--
think so.

215
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,010
You call that
an Irish jig, tohru?

216
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,980
That spell says you
must riverdance.

217
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:24,649
One more thing--
to avoid bad luck,

218
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,918
always wear a belt.

219
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,654
Uncle: Beware of men
named Seamus,

220
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,823
and never
- stand with your back

221
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,725
to an open door.

222
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:36,061
Are you making these up?

223
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:39,030
Do you want uncle's
help or not?!

224
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,732
(Gasps)
Open door.

225
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,568
(Gasps)
The dark hand?!

226
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,270
Not anymore.

227
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:49,107
We are Finn and
the revolution.

228
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,643
I thought we were
the Finn experience.

229
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,778
Ah, I'm still
playing around
with names.

230
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,447
Now give me
the stone.

231
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:56,815
The emerald?

232
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,349
Believe me,
you do not want it.

233
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:59,417
It's--

234
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,853
cursed?
Nice try, chan.

235
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,588
Now, hand it over.

236
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,124
Ok, Jackie,

237
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:07,926
this should--
uh-oh.

238
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,596
Jade, stay here.

239
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,036
(Grunts)

240
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,507
Uncle was right
about the belt.

241
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:25,810
I need those!

242
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,612
Then give me
the emerald.

243
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:28,680
You'll just sell it

244
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:30,682
and pass the curse
to someone else.

245
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:31,783
There is no curse.

246
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:32,917
Aah!

247
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,265
Hello.

248
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,803
Oops.

249
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,538
Finn: There he is!

250
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:14,359
(Jeering and laughing)

251
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:16,394
Why, lookee there,
Seamus.

252
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:17,796
Seamus?

253
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:20,031
Why, that fella's
not wearin' any pants,
Seamus.

254
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,432
Aye, Seamus,

255
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,868
and he's not wearin'
any green, neither.

256
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:34,179
No one escapes
from Finn, wind, and fire.

257
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:39,751
Unh.

258
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,090
Eww.

259
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,392
Lose something?

260
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:48,660
2 somethings.

261
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:49,994
Finn took the emerald.

262
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,497
Good! Now the curse
is <i> his</i> problem.

263
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,865
(Cell phone rings)

264
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:55,133
Hello?

265
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,568
Uncle:
- One more thing--

266
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,770
watch out
for pickpockets.

267
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:00,438
The curse
is transferred

268
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,007
when the emerald
is exchanged
willingly,

269
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,109
but if the gem
is stolen...

270
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:06,845
Stolen?

271
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,047
The curse will
stay with you!

272
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,748
Forever!

273
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,483
Lucky me.

274
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:13,885
(Rumbling)

275
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:17,388
(Sighs)

276
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,395
Jackie:
Ow.

277
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,398
Ow.

278
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,034
Ow.

279
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:31,703
Ow.

280
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,471
Ow.

281
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,807
Jackie, please
put this on.

282
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:37,475
What's the point?

283
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:40,044
It will just
burst into flames or...

284
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,815
See?

285
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,049
The curse.

286
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,619
Uncle said I'm
stuck with it forever.

287
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:49,120
But uncle
also said the curse

288
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,855
could be broken,
right?

289
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:52,090
All we have to do

290
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,758
is get that emerald
back to its tomb.

291
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,927
But how are we
supposed to find it?

292
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:58,263
The Finn, uh, guys,

293
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:01,266
could be
anywhere by now.

294
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,301
(Irish accent) Just leave
that wee problem to me,

295
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:04,836
why don't ya?

296
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,074
(Cheering)

297
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,846
(All gasp)

298
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,981
Alrighty, now.

299
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,850
Who stole me emerald?

300
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,719
(Gasps) Get out
of the garden.

301
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:22,854
A leprechaun!

302
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:25,523
That's right, lads.
I'm a leprechaun,

303
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,025
and if'n you can't
say where to find

304
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,793
the emerald of killarney,

305
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,596
I'll put the hex
on every last one of ya!

306
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,800
I heard about
some fellas

307
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,402
trying to sell
a Jewel

308
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,470
out at
the potato factory.

309
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:45,143
Then I'll spare ya
of me wrath this time.

310
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,178
Hang on, now.

311
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,479
He's a leprechaun.

312
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:49,614
If we catch him,

313
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,183
he's got to give us
his pot of gold.

314
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,020
Wait! I'm not
a leprechaun, ok?

315
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,255
I got this costume
at a--

316
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:59,924
is this some kind
of leprechaun trick?

317
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:02,493
Any luck?

318
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:03,628
Both kinds!

319
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,729
Man: The leprechaun!

320
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:05,830
Get him!

321
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:06,898
Hurry! This way!

322
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,866
Ya can't outrun Seamus!

323
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,808
(Rip)

324
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,176
What was that?

325
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,510
My pants.

326
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,717
Ok, what's the plan?
Sneak attack or--

327
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,986
the plan is for you
to wait here.

328
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,153
But the curse!

329
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,522
I will be fine, Jade.
I promise.

330
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,425
Heh heh.

331
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:37,528
It's a potato factory.
How dangerous could it be?

332
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,166
(Gulps)

333
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,070
Jackie needs help.

334
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,205
The leprechaun!

335
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,439
Get him!

336
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,108
(Gasps)

337
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,944
Curse?
Nah, there's no curse.

338
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:56,280
In fact, my luck
has never been better.

339
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:59,617
So, 3 million? Deal.

340
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:02,020
Ha ha! We never made
this kind of coin

341
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,488
workin'
for the dark hand!

342
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,090
The rolling
Finns rock!

343
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:11,662
Ha ha! My solo debut
just went triple-platinum!

344
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:13,398
No bad luck.
No bad luck.
No bad luck.

345
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,100
No bad luck.
No bad luck.
No bad luck.

346
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:17,201
All: Chan?!

347
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,770
Well, get him!

348
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,248
I love this machine!

349
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,017
It's kickin' chan's butt
for us!

350
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,619
Man: Gotcha!
Second man: You're mine!

351
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,220
Come here, you!

352
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,959
Think, Jade!

353
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:44,228
You can't escape,
leprechaun.

354
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,197
Alrighty,
you caught me.

355
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,968
Now, follow me,
and I'll lead you
to me pot o' gold.

356
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,382
Face it, chan.
You're no match
for Finn halen!

357
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,518
Now gimme
the emerald.

358
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,421
Willingly.

359
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:15,126
So, how does it feel
to be a loser, chan?

360
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,629
Actually,
I feel lucky.

361
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,276
Ohh! No! No!
Hey! Oof!

362
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,662
Both: Whoa!

363
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,265
Whoa!

364
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,771
This thing <i> is</i> cursed!

365
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:01,839
Jackie: I know...

366
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,441
And I will take
the curse back

367
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:05,510
if you will
just leave me alone.

368
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:06,978
(Door opens)

369
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:09,647
Those men have it!

370
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,617
It's all yours, dude.

371
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:16,554
Man: Grrr. Alrighty,
hand it over.

372
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:19,190
I just did. He has it.

373
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:21,759
Not the emerald,
you pig-ignorant gum.

374
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,695
Every irishmen knows
that rock carries
a curse!

375
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:28,232
But the leprechaun
told us you lot
stole her pot o' gold!

376
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,170
Aah!

377
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,272
Hey, boss!

378
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:35,673
We quit!

379
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,742
You guys can't quit now!

380
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,777
I just settled
on a name!

381
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,453
Both: Whew.

382
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,890
Jade: Nothing's
gone wrong since
we left the tomb.

383
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,792
Looks like
you're officially
uncursed!

384
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:58,729
Yes, I think my luck
is finally changing.

385
00:19:58,731 --> 00:19:59,897
Jackie, look out!

386
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,499
Aah! Ohh!

387
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:02,633
Aah!

388
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,503
Aah!

389
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:06,604
Whoa.

390
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,773
Black cat,
broken mirror,

391
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:10,608
and walking
under a ladder?

392
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,276
That's like...

393
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:14,145
80 years
bad luck.

394
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:16,547
But those are
just superstitions.

395
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:18,916
Right?

396
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,419
Old man:
Hey, fella...

397
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:24,488
You're standin'
right where
the trash bin goes.

398
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,632
Hey, Jackie.

399
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:35,866
Yes?

400
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,568
What's the hardest thing
you've ever had to do?

401
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,836
Typing.

402
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,304
Communication
with e-mail.

403
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:41,439
Internet.

404
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,374
Anybody write to me--
even Chinese,

405
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:44,942
I don't know
how to type back.

406
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,043
What can I do?

407
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,378
Some other things,
easy.

408
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,614
Stunt, rolling,
action, I can do it.

409
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:51,482
I just don't know
how to type.
