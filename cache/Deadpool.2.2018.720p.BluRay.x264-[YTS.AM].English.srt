1
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:17,242
Fuck Wolverine.

2
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:19,984
First, he rides my coattails
with the R rating.

3
00:02:20,028 --> 00:02:24,423
Then the hairy motherfucker
ups the ante by dying.

4
00:02:24,467 --> 00:02:26,643
What a dick.

5
00:02:26,686 --> 00:02:28,907
Well, guess what, Wolvie?

6
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:31,779
I'm dying in this one, too.

7
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,915
To understand
why I took a cat-nap

8
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,048
on 1,200 gallons
of high-test fuel...

9
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:40,440
I need to take you back

10
00:02:40,484 --> 00:02:42,921
to the dewy slopes
of six weeks ago.

11
00:02:42,965 --> 00:02:44,314
I'd gone international,

12
00:02:44,357 --> 00:02:46,272
taking out mass murderers,
gangsters,

13
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:48,013
unspeakable monsters.

14
00:02:48,057 --> 00:02:51,016
People nobody would touch.
Except me.

15
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,018
I'm gonna touch them all over.

16
00:02:56,674 --> 00:02:58,589
Hey, it's Gail calling.

17
00:02:58,632 --> 00:02:59,764
Love the shiny suit.

18
00:02:59,807 --> 00:03:01,548
Really brings out

19
00:03:01,592 --> 00:03:03,672
the sex trafficker
in your eyes.

20
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:08,816
I don't
speak Cantonese, Mister...

21
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,993
Well, I'm not even gonna
attempt that.

22
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:13,517
But I did take 8th grade Spanish, so...

23
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:18,696
Which literally
translates to...

24
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:21,786
I don't bargain,
pumpkin fucker.

25
00:03:31,536 --> 00:03:34,278
Oh. Oh, this isn't Gilbert's.

26
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:35,583
I am so sorry.

27
00:03:35,627 --> 00:03:37,307
I thought this was
an anal-bleaching party.

28
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:01,696
Don't worry.
You're not going to die.

29
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,829
Although these will kill you.

30
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:05,091
Hit it, Dolly.

31
00:04:25,372 --> 00:04:26,766
I'm merely
a vessel for the Lord.

32
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:40,606
Taking the hands out
of the guns of the criminals!

33
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:50,659
Whoo! Do not go in there!

34
00:04:57,362 --> 00:04:59,451
Let's see
Captain America do that.

35
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,939
Too exotic?

36
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,070
Oh, God! Oh, God,
time out! Time out!

37
00:06:35,113 --> 00:06:38,639
Cut. I've got bad guy blood,
right in my open eye.

38
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:40,684
Oh, that's so gross.

39
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:43,992
Fuck.

40
00:06:44,035 --> 00:06:45,926
Looks like you left
a little landing strip there.

41
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,995
I like it.

42
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,741
Oh, man!

43
00:06:58,093 --> 00:07:00,051
My world tour
brought me home

44
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,532
to this guy,
Sergei Valishnikov.

45
00:07:02,576 --> 00:07:04,099
But we'll get to him
in a moment.

46
00:07:04,142 --> 00:07:05,579
'Cause I know
what you're thinking.

47
00:07:05,622 --> 00:07:08,364
"I'm so glad
I left the kiddos at home."

48
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:10,105
But that's where
you'd be wrong.

49
00:07:10,148 --> 00:07:12,890
That babysitter of yours
is high as fuck right now...

50
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:17,243
and, believe it or not,
Deadpool 2 is a family film.

51
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:19,070
True story.

52
00:07:19,114 --> 00:07:22,291
And every good family film
starts with a vicious murder.

53
00:07:22,335 --> 00:07:25,426
Bambi, The Lion King, Saw 7.

54
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:28,777
Holy shit pickles!
That guy's on fire.

55
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,736
That's not CGI, folks.
He's actually on fire.

56
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,174
Yeah. You know I get paid
to take out bad guys, right?

57
00:07:35,218 --> 00:07:36,437
But this guy?

58
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,439
He was
one of the worst of 'em.

59
00:07:41,137 --> 00:07:42,660
Hurry up and open
this fucking door,

60
00:07:42,704 --> 00:07:43,984
and let's kill
this motherfucker!

61
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,975
Ugh. So gross.

62
00:07:53,018 --> 00:07:55,847
A panic room? Really?

63
00:07:55,891 --> 00:07:58,110
Can you come out?

64
00:07:58,154 --> 00:08:01,244
I really have to go.
It's my anniversary.

65
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:08,575
Over and over,
I hear people say,

66
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:10,166
"I just don't have
enough confidence."

67
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:12,299
Listen, confidence is not
something you have.

68
00:08:12,342 --> 00:08:13,778
It's something you create.

69
00:08:13,822 --> 00:08:15,737
And you can create it
at any moment in time.

70
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,478
A sense of confidence
is nothing

71
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:19,262
but a sense of power
within yourself...

72
00:08:19,306 --> 00:08:20,848
a sense of certainty that
you can pull something off.

73
00:08:20,872 --> 00:08:22,962
Start the fucking car!

74
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:24,137
Dopinder!

75
00:08:24,181 --> 00:08:25,704
Start the fucking car!

76
00:08:30,405 --> 00:08:32,885
Shoot that motherfucker!
Shoot him!

77
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,452
Whoo! Oh, I shit my pants.

78
00:08:34,496 --> 00:08:36,889
Actually, that may
have been me.

79
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,195
Oh, mission accomplished?

80
00:08:38,238 --> 00:08:40,371
Oh, in a George W.
sort of way.

81
00:08:40,415 --> 00:08:42,112
Fucker can't stay
in a panic room forever.

82
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,611
Oh, you're living
the dreams, DP.

83
00:08:43,635 --> 00:08:45,811
It has been
quite the run, Dopinder,

84
00:08:45,855 --> 00:08:47,160
and who'da thought?

85
00:08:47,204 --> 00:08:49,641
Now I'm talked about
in the same sentence as Jesus.

86
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:51,556
Passion of the Christ, then me.

87
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,862
At least domestically.

88
00:08:52,905 --> 00:08:54,124
We beat them overseas,

89
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,169
where there's no such thing
as religion.

90
00:08:56,213 --> 00:08:58,389
I do want to live
the dreams, Pool Boy.

91
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:00,826
Taxiing is not as sexy
as it looks.

92
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,654
I want to fill my... Pockets?

93
00:09:02,698 --> 00:09:05,918
What's your poison?
A little, uh, cokey cokey?

94
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,311
Can't maintain an erection

95
00:09:07,355 --> 00:09:08,897
without buying shoes online?

96
00:09:08,921 --> 00:09:10,880
I've never experienced
that last one.

97
00:09:10,923 --> 00:09:12,316
Talk to me, Goose.

98
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,058
I was going to say "soul".
I want to fill my soul.

99
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:18,191
I want to belong to something,
like you, Pool, sir.

100
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:20,193
Dopinder... Hmm?

101
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:22,066
You never cease
to surprise me.

102
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:26,200
You know, the depth of
your heart is extraordinary.

103
00:09:26,244 --> 00:09:27,898
We all need
a sense of belonging.

104
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:29,726
We all need
a genuine sense of home.

105
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:30,901
A place in this world.

106
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:32,304
I want to become
a contract killer.

107
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:34,165
I'm sorry. What did you say?

108
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,167
Remember when
I kidnapped Bandhu

109
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,536
and threatened him
with great violence?

110
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,170
You kind of killed him.

111
00:09:39,213 --> 00:09:40,800
And then remember the movie
Interview with the Vampire?

112
00:09:40,824 --> 00:09:41,999
Don't want to.

113
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:43,130
When Tom Cruise fed

114
00:09:43,174 --> 00:09:45,002
10-year-old
Kirsten Dunst blood

115
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:46,264
for the first time...

116
00:09:46,307 --> 00:09:48,701
and she looked up
at his smooth,

117
00:09:48,745 --> 00:09:50,964
handsome face and said...

118
00:09:51,748 --> 00:09:53,532
"I want some more."

119
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:57,231
Oh, Pool, picture me,
a 10-year-old Kirsten Dunst.

120
00:09:58,276 --> 00:10:00,974
I'll never not picture that.

121
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,802
But I can't wait
to never speak of this,

122
00:10:02,846 --> 00:10:04,891
as soon as possible.

123
00:10:04,935 --> 00:10:07,416
We're here.

124
00:10:14,205 --> 00:10:16,207
Dopinder, it's me again.

125
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,948
Look, a saner man
might discourage you

126
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:19,863
from joining
the deadly merc business...

127
00:10:19,906 --> 00:10:21,387
what, with your concave chest

128
00:10:21,431 --> 00:10:23,084
and your
paper towel tube arms.

129
00:10:23,128 --> 00:10:24,825
But you're an eagle...

130
00:10:24,869 --> 00:10:26,871
and goddamn it,
an eagle's gotta soar.

131
00:10:26,914 --> 00:10:28,307
You gotta grab those dreams,

132
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,961
grab those dreams
by the dick tip...

133
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,528
and make it rain!

134
00:10:31,571 --> 00:10:33,486
I don't know what that means.

135
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,488
Me neither.

136
00:10:36,097 --> 00:10:37,577
I'm gonna see you...

137
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:40,232
at the office.

138
00:10:40,798 --> 00:10:41,929
In the sky.

139
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:43,104
You're my Tom Cruise!

140
00:10:43,148 --> 00:10:44,758
And you're my Kristen Dunst!

141
00:10:44,802 --> 00:10:46,281
Kristen? Kirsten?

142
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,940
Sorry I'm late.

143
00:10:52,984 --> 00:10:54,551
There was a bunch of

144
00:10:54,594 --> 00:10:56,683
handicapable children
stuck in a tree...

145
00:10:56,727 --> 00:10:58,250
and I had to, uh... Uh-uh.

146
00:10:58,293 --> 00:11:01,035
You're right.
I was fighting a caped badass.

147
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,429
But then we discovered
his mom is named Martha, too.

148
00:11:03,473 --> 00:11:05,779
No.You got me.

149
00:11:05,823 --> 00:11:07,607
I was rounding up
all the gluten in the world

150
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:08,869
and launching it into space...

151
00:11:08,913 --> 00:11:11,045
where it can't not
hurt us ever again.

152
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:12,264
Try again.

153
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,396
Diarrhea?

154
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,200
We can't be sure
until I get this suit off...

155
00:11:17,138 --> 00:11:19,097
but, uh,
all signs point to yes.

156
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,014
Traffic?

157
00:11:22,623 --> 00:11:23,668
Hmm?

158
00:11:24,886 --> 00:11:26,540
Kiss me
like you miss me, Red.

159
00:11:26,584 --> 00:11:27,584
Well, come here.

160
00:11:39,292 --> 00:11:41,729
I'm gonna shower
and get out of this suit.

161
00:11:41,773 --> 00:11:42,948
Don't you want
your surprise?

162
00:11:42,991 --> 00:11:44,819
Do I look like
a patient burn victim?

163
00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:46,865
I got one for you, too.

164
00:11:47,996 --> 00:11:49,520
Happy anniversary, baby.

165
00:11:49,563 --> 00:11:51,130
Open, open, open.

166
00:11:53,132 --> 00:11:54,873
Skee-Ball token.

167
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,309
Our first date.

168
00:11:56,352 --> 00:11:57,919
Yup.

169
00:11:57,963 --> 00:12:00,618
That's genuine,
high-grade lead.

170
00:12:03,534 --> 00:12:05,840
I'll keep it forever.

171
00:12:05,884 --> 00:12:07,320
Thank you, baby.

172
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,628
Open yours. All right, all right.

173
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:12,847
Oh...

174
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,131
That's just the most
beautiful thing that I've...

175
00:12:16,155 --> 00:12:17,548
I don't know
what this is.

176
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:19,420
My IUD.

177
00:12:19,463 --> 00:12:20,639
A bomb?

178
00:12:20,682 --> 00:12:23,772
No, dick for brains.
My birth control device.

179
00:12:23,816 --> 00:12:24,904
What, you mean that your...

180
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:26,688
Baby factory's open
for business.

181
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:28,037
Oh, my God!

182
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,345
Oh, my God! I want a boy!

183
00:12:31,388 --> 00:12:34,478
Or a little girl!
Definitely one or the other!

184
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:37,307
Oh! And I want our kid
to have only one name.

185
00:12:37,873 --> 00:12:41,137
Like Cher or Todd.

186
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:42,965
You gotta pump a baby
in me first, cowboy.

187
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:44,358
Yes, I do.

188
00:12:44,401 --> 00:12:45,901
Let's watch some porn
and show that bed who's boss.

189
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:46,926
Let's do that.

190
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:50,277
♪ Papa... ♪

191
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,496
♪ Can you hear me? ♪

192
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:56,588
♪ Papa, can you see me? ♪

193
00:12:56,631 --> 00:12:58,851
Does this song
sound familiar to you?

194
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:03,333
May.

195
00:13:03,377 --> 00:13:07,076
Connor, if it's a boy.
May, if it's a girl.

196
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:12,168
So weird.

197
00:13:12,212 --> 00:13:14,606
Family was always
an F-word to me.

198
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:20,482
My pile of shit father
took off and bailed.

199
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:22,745
I mean, it's not like I have
a lot of strong role models

200
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:24,529
to draw off of for Todd.

201
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:28,316
Hey. Look at me.

202
00:13:29,491 --> 00:13:31,624
You are not your father.

203
00:13:33,364 --> 00:13:34,801
Besides...

204
00:13:34,844 --> 00:13:39,588
I will never, ever
let our child be named Todd.

205
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:41,634
But here's the thing,

206
00:13:41,677 --> 00:13:43,505
isn't that how
it always works?

207
00:13:43,548 --> 00:13:45,072
Like in Star Wars,

208
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,814
men are destined
to become their father...

209
00:13:47,857 --> 00:13:50,947
and then have consensual sex
with their sister?

210
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:54,298
I think you missed
big, big chunks of that movie.

211
00:13:54,342 --> 00:13:56,605
No, I'm pretty sure
Luke nailed her.

212
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:58,694
Baby, that's Empire.

213
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:01,349
The point is, kids...

214
00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:05,483
they give us a chance
to be better than we are.

215
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,965
Better than we used to be.

216
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:11,533
You're a lot smarter
than I look.

217
00:14:12,577 --> 00:14:14,231
I'm gonna go make dessert.

218
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:18,715
You get the strap-on.
Let's make a super baby.

219
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:22,153
Pretty sure it doesn't work
that way, but we can try.

220
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:25,722
What about Krystal?
But with a "K"?

221
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:27,724
It's too stripper-y.

222
00:14:27,768 --> 00:14:29,291
Kevin with a "K"!

223
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:31,423
No, too stripper-y, too.

224
00:14:31,989 --> 00:14:33,904
Uh, Earl!

225
00:14:33,948 --> 00:14:36,298
He's gonna go straight to jail

226
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:38,561
if we name him Earl.

227
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:40,476
What about Bruce?

228
00:14:41,477 --> 00:14:42,913
No.

229
00:14:42,957 --> 00:14:44,001
Get down.

230
00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:45,437
What?

231
00:15:14,336 --> 00:15:16,426
Baby? Baby?

232
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,387
I'm okay.

233
00:15:21,431 --> 00:15:24,086
Thank God I didn't have to use
the cream cheese spreader.

234
00:15:58,685 --> 00:15:59,948
Please.

235
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,868
Please. Please.

236
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,088
Baby, I'm so sorry.

237
00:16:10,132 --> 00:16:13,918
No!

238
00:19:18,454 --> 00:19:21,153
♪ Papa, can you hear me? ♪

239
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,894
Is it just me, or does

240
00:19:23,938 --> 00:19:25,524
Do You Want to Build
a Snowman? from Frozen...

241
00:19:25,548 --> 00:19:26,854
sound suspiciously like

242
00:19:26,897 --> 00:19:28,856
Papa, Can You Hear Me?
from Yentl?

243
00:19:30,205 --> 00:19:32,338
♪ Papa, can you hear me? ♪

244
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,733
And nobody
fucking realizes it.

245
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:38,344
Wade, you gotta go home.

246
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:41,129
You've been sitting here
for three days, okay?

247
00:19:41,173 --> 00:19:44,872
You smell like sauerkraut
left in the warm rain.

248
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:47,222
Like wet garbage
in hot urine.

249
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:49,442
You smell like
a dog ate kitty litter...

250
00:19:49,485 --> 00:19:51,531
and then farted his way
out of the living room.

251
00:19:51,574 --> 00:19:53,402
I mean, like Rush Limbaugh's

252
00:19:53,446 --> 00:19:55,274
couch cushions
after Shark Week.

253
00:19:55,317 --> 00:19:57,058
I love Frozen.

254
00:19:57,102 --> 00:20:00,670
I loved her. I loved her
like an ocean loves water.

255
00:20:00,714 --> 00:20:02,237
An ocean is water.

256
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:07,025
More importantly, I liked her.
I really liked her, you know?

257
00:20:07,068 --> 00:20:08,200
George Michael was right.

258
00:20:08,243 --> 00:20:10,071
I'm never gonna
dance again. Fuck!

259
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,682
He's dead, too.

260
00:20:12,857 --> 00:20:14,207
At least we still have Bowie.

261
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,991
Oh, Mr. Pool.
David Bowie is...

262
00:20:16,035 --> 00:20:17,297
Uh, uh, uh...

263
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,515
still with us.

264
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,431
We do.
We'll always have Bowie.

265
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,085
I'm sorry.

266
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:24,565
Shot after shot,

267
00:20:24,608 --> 00:20:26,456
it's not gonna change the fact
that I think you're...

268
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,110
Are you pissing?
Are you urinating right now?

269
00:20:28,134 --> 00:20:31,050
You're making the face that
you make when you urinate.

270
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:32,660
Is he pissing? I'm on it!

271
00:20:32,703 --> 00:20:34,183
There you go, Dopinder.

272
00:20:34,227 --> 00:20:36,272
If you want to be
a contract killer...

273
00:20:36,316 --> 00:20:38,883
you gotta handle a mop
before you handle a gun.

274
00:20:38,927 --> 00:20:39,991
Although I don't
quite understand

275
00:20:40,015 --> 00:20:41,582
how they are at all similar.

276
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,734
'Cause I could shove either
one up your ass and kill you.

277
00:20:43,758 --> 00:20:44,889
Now, leave me.

278
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:45,934
I get it.

279
00:20:46,456 --> 00:20:48,067
Go home, Wade.

280
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,460
I don't have a home,
Weas, you know. I got a...

281
00:20:51,896 --> 00:20:53,289
Okay, I'm fine.

282
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,464
I'm fine.

283
00:20:54,508 --> 00:20:56,336
You know what "fine"
stands for, Wade?

284
00:20:56,379 --> 00:21:00,122
Fucked up, insecure,
needy, and emotional.

285
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,384
According to the...

286
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:04,170
Kubler-Ross.Yeah.

287
00:21:04,213 --> 00:21:06,085
According to
the Kubler-Ross model...

288
00:21:06,128 --> 00:21:08,913
denial is just one of
the five stages of grief.

289
00:21:08,957 --> 00:21:11,308
Jesus Christ, Buck!

290
00:21:11,352 --> 00:21:13,267
No more speaking lines
for you.

291
00:21:21,927 --> 00:21:24,278
Hey, bud. Bud.

292
00:21:24,321 --> 00:21:26,410
- Huh?
- Got a match?

293
00:21:26,454 --> 00:21:27,977
Match?

294
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,500
Yes, I have one right here.

295
00:21:29,544 --> 00:21:30,912
Don't make a move.
This is a stick-up.

296
00:21:30,936 --> 00:21:32,677
- What?
- You heard me.

297
00:21:32,721 --> 00:21:34,766
Mister, Mister,
put down that gun.

298
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,421
Shut up. Now, come on.
Your money or your life?

299
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:49,346
Look, bud. I said,
"Your money or your life."

300
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,695
"I'm thinking it over!"

301
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:52,132
Motherfuck!

302
00:21:52,175 --> 00:21:53,220
Fuck!

303
00:21:56,223 --> 00:21:57,702
The hell you doin' here?

304
00:21:57,746 --> 00:21:59,835
Don't you know how to knock?

305
00:21:59,878 --> 00:22:01,793
I thought you saw me...

306
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:03,360
with your ears.

307
00:22:03,404 --> 00:22:04,468
You're lucky I didn't
shoot you in the...

308
00:22:04,492 --> 00:22:05,536
The wall?

309
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,974
The refrigerator?
I'm in so much pain.

310
00:22:11,761 --> 00:22:13,371
I heard the news,
sweetie.

311
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,504
I'm very sorry. I am.

312
00:22:15,547 --> 00:22:17,462
What am I gonna do, Al?

313
00:22:17,506 --> 00:22:19,203
Probably something terrible.

314
00:22:20,378 --> 00:22:21,771
Knowing you.

315
00:22:21,814 --> 00:22:23,338
It was my fault.

316
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:27,255
I fucking did this.

317
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:29,170
And all I wanna do
is grab her and see her

318
00:22:29,213 --> 00:22:31,172
and tell her that I'm sorry,
and I can't.

319
00:22:33,174 --> 00:22:34,827
She's gone.

320
00:22:34,871 --> 00:22:38,657
Sweetheart,
can you speak up?

321
00:22:38,701 --> 00:22:39,963
It's a little hard
to hear you

322
00:22:40,006 --> 00:22:41,704
with that pity dick
in your mouth.

323
00:22:41,747 --> 00:22:44,794
Now, look, sugar.
You need to just keep living.

324
00:22:44,837 --> 00:22:46,143
Thank you...

325
00:22:46,187 --> 00:22:49,190
Matthew McConaughey,
your words are a treasure.

326
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:51,279
Listen to the pain.

327
00:22:51,322 --> 00:22:54,107
It's both history teacher
and fortune teller.

328
00:22:54,151 --> 00:22:57,763
Pain teaches us
who we are, Wade.

329
00:22:57,807 --> 00:23:01,680
Sometimes, it's so bad,
we feel like we're dying.

330
00:23:01,724 --> 00:23:04,422
But we can't really live till
we've died a little, can we?

331
00:23:06,946 --> 00:23:08,165
Wade?

332
00:23:10,603 --> 00:23:12,779
Wade? I'm right here, Althea.

333
00:23:12,823 --> 00:23:15,434
And that is
the most beautiful thing

334
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:16,696
I've ever heard.

335
00:23:17,436 --> 00:23:19,003
And you're absolutely right.

336
00:23:22,876 --> 00:23:25,227
I'm about to do
something terrible.

337
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:32,538
Precious, aren't they?

338
00:23:33,365 --> 00:23:34,801
Whoa!

339
00:23:34,845 --> 00:23:36,281
Are you a superhero?

340
00:23:36,325 --> 00:23:38,022
Fucking A, sweetie.

341
00:23:38,065 --> 00:23:39,632
What's your name?

342
00:23:39,676 --> 00:23:41,460
Captain Delicious Pants.

343
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,680
Who's Captain Delicious Pants?

344
00:24:09,054 --> 00:24:11,056
I can't believe
he's still alive.

345
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:13,580
I can't believe you left
the house in that shirt.

346
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,018
There's gotta be
some way to die.

347
00:24:17,062 --> 00:24:19,107
I just need to die harder.

348
00:24:19,151 --> 00:24:20,370
Trademark Fox.

349
00:24:20,413 --> 00:24:21,414
Y'all caught up now?

350
00:24:34,688 --> 00:24:36,342
Open for business.

351
00:24:40,215 --> 00:24:42,348
Your crazy
matches my crazy.

352
00:24:42,392 --> 00:24:44,544
I will never, ever
let our child be named Todd.

353
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:45,830
Skee-Ball token.

354
00:24:45,873 --> 00:24:47,153
You're a lot smarter
than I look.

355
00:24:53,054 --> 00:24:54,336
About why
we're so good together.

356
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,555
I love you,
Wade Wilson.

357
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,583
Ness?

358
00:25:01,062 --> 00:25:02,194
Ness?

359
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:04,588
Ness.

360
00:25:04,631 --> 00:25:07,331
Ness, there's something here.
I can't get to you.

361
00:25:09,028 --> 00:25:11,552
Your heart's not
in the right place.

362
00:25:11,596 --> 00:25:14,250
Wait, hold on. What?

363
00:25:14,294 --> 00:25:16,383
Your heart's not
in the right place.

364
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:17,819
Wait. What do you mean

365
00:25:17,863 --> 00:25:19,823
my heart's not in the right
place? What does it...

366
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:41,582
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss, Wade.

367
00:25:42,061 --> 00:25:43,192
You're broken.

368
00:25:43,236 --> 00:25:46,195
Oh, God.
I know that voice.

369
00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:08,697
Well, Russell.

370
00:26:08,741 --> 00:26:11,396
I hear you're handy
at picking locks.

371
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:15,008
There will be no need
for that here.

372
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:18,359
There's no locks on our doors,
no bars on our windows.

373
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,754
I know what you're thinking.

374
00:26:21,797 --> 00:26:24,452
Why don't the kids just run?

375
00:26:24,496 --> 00:26:27,455
Who would choose to stay
in such a place?

376
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:29,979
You stay because...

377
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:34,767
deep down inside, you know
you're unfit to leave.

378
00:26:38,553 --> 00:26:40,163
Don't worry.

379
00:26:41,338 --> 00:26:42,992
We can fix that.

380
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:51,566
Blessed are the wicked
who are healed by my hand.

381
00:27:13,546 --> 00:27:15,243
"Heart's in the right place."

382
00:27:15,286 --> 00:27:16,742
"Heart's in the right..."
What does that mean?

383
00:27:16,766 --> 00:27:18,681
Take your mask off, Wade.

384
00:27:18,725 --> 00:27:20,422
I wish you'd said "pants".

385
00:27:20,466 --> 00:27:21,684
Let's play a game.

386
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:24,252
It's called
"Adrien Brody or Adam Brody?".

387
00:27:24,295 --> 00:27:26,646
Now, close your eyes
and open your mouth.

388
00:27:26,689 --> 00:27:28,517
You don't need
to be funny here.

389
00:27:29,126 --> 00:27:30,388
We must talk.

390
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,913
You need fresh start.

391
00:27:32,956 --> 00:27:34,523
Such a glare.

392
00:27:34,567 --> 00:27:36,830
It's like I'm on stage
at the Gaiety.

393
00:27:36,873 --> 00:27:39,485
With training,
you can be X-Man.

394
00:27:39,528 --> 00:27:41,617
You're wasting your time,
Shiny Jesus.

395
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:42,966
I'm not X-Man material.

396
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,577
Understatement of the year.

397
00:27:45,055 --> 00:27:46,056
Wade, Yukio.

398
00:27:46,535 --> 00:27:48,450
Yukio, Wade.

399
00:27:48,494 --> 00:27:50,583
What in the fuck knuckles
is this?

400
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:53,281
She's my girlfriend,
you intolerant shit.

401
00:27:53,324 --> 00:27:55,152
Whoa! Pump the hate brakes,
Fox & Friends.

402
00:27:55,196 --> 00:27:57,067
I'm just surprised
anyone would date you.

403
00:27:57,111 --> 00:27:59,722
Especially Pinkie Pie
from My Little Pony.

404
00:27:59,766 --> 00:28:01,594
I like this guy.

405
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:03,727
Give him a chance.

406
00:28:03,771 --> 00:28:04,878
It's great seeing you
like this.

407
00:28:04,902 --> 00:28:07,078
Yeah.

408
00:28:07,557 --> 00:28:08,863
Bye, Wade!

409
00:28:08,906 --> 00:28:11,387
Now, some ground rules
while under our roof.

410
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,216
"Rule number one.
No killing...

411
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:17,698
"anyone ever,
no matter how bad.

412
00:28:17,741 --> 00:28:20,396
"Rule two. Label everything
in refrigerator."

413
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:21,440
Wade?

414
00:28:22,311 --> 00:28:23,573
Wade?

415
00:28:23,617 --> 00:28:25,444
Don't try to chase me. Wade!

416
00:28:25,488 --> 00:28:27,577
I'm not ready
to be touched again.

417
00:28:27,621 --> 00:28:29,840
All these old guys
on the wall.

418
00:28:29,884 --> 00:28:31,973
Who lives here,
Calista Flockhart?

419
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,195
Those were already damaged
after they fell there!

420
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:39,110
What am I supposed
to do around here, anyway?

421
00:28:39,154 --> 00:28:41,417
Sit in a share circle,
talk about my feelings?

422
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,333
And how would I
do that exactly?

423
00:28:44,376 --> 00:28:46,814
'Cause where the fuck
is everyone?

424
00:28:46,857 --> 00:28:48,076
It's always just you

425
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,444
and Negasonic Teenage
Longest Name Ever...

426
00:28:49,468 --> 00:28:50,687
Enough!

427
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:52,559
I said no touching!

428
00:28:54,343 --> 00:28:57,607
What the fuck?

429
00:28:57,651 --> 00:28:59,827
You'd think the studio
would throw us a bone.

430
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,699
One that doesn't end up
in my mouth.

431
00:29:02,744 --> 00:29:03,938
The first movie
made more money

432
00:29:03,962 --> 00:29:06,312
than the guy
who invented pants.

433
00:29:06,356 --> 00:29:08,532
They can't just dust off
one of the famous X-Men?

434
00:29:08,576 --> 00:29:10,665
How 'bout that putz
with the giant pigeon wings?

435
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,014
What do those do anyway, huh?

436
00:29:12,057 --> 00:29:13,537
Carry him
three feet off the ground

437
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:15,626
to snatch up
the nearest muffin crumb?

438
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,846
No, no, no!

439
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:20,631
I am not X-Man material
at all.

440
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:23,329
First off...

441
00:29:23,373 --> 00:29:25,418
I'm not even a virgin.
Second and more...

442
00:29:27,638 --> 00:29:28,683
I should have left you

443
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,467
in the self-pitying mess
I found you in.

444
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,601
But this is what friends do.
They show up!

445
00:29:33,644 --> 00:29:35,646
Not when convenient or easy.

446
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,998
When hard,
and you always make it hard.

447
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:42,522
You are unwell.

448
00:29:42,566 --> 00:29:44,655
I'm sticking my neck out
bringing you here.

449
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,614
Wait.
One of the assholes

450
00:29:46,657 --> 00:29:48,137
who killed Vanessa got away.

451
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,881
Oh, Jesus Christ!

452
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,815
I thought you were gonna
kiss me for a second there.

453
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:56,774
Please know I wouldn't be
able to stop you if you did.

454
00:29:56,798 --> 00:29:58,843
Wade, whoever they are...

455
00:29:58,887 --> 00:30:01,237
we track them down
and bring them to justice.

456
00:30:01,804 --> 00:30:03,240
It was me.

457
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:08,724
I'm the asshole who got away.

458
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:11,901
I killed every last one
of them, except me.

459
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:13,642
Couldn't kill me.

460
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:18,777
We were gonna start a family.

461
00:30:20,605 --> 00:30:22,563
We were, uh...

462
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:25,523
We were gonna be a family.

463
00:30:26,306 --> 00:30:27,438
Wade...

464
00:30:27,481 --> 00:30:30,267
Vanessa is gone.
She's not coming back.

465
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:34,184
This may not be
family you want...

466
00:30:34,227 --> 00:30:36,665
but it's family you need.

467
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:37,970
You have a good heart.

468
00:30:38,014 --> 00:30:39,580
It belongs here
where it can grow.

469
00:30:41,365 --> 00:30:42,366
What did you say?

470
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:45,717
About my heart?

471
00:30:51,157 --> 00:30:53,159
I think
I'm in the right place.

472
00:32:00,968 --> 00:32:03,797
I'mma tell you
what the big lie is.

473
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:05,451
Toilet paper.

474
00:32:05,494 --> 00:32:06,887
What's so bad
about toilet paper?

475
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:08,149
Gets the job done.

476
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:11,065
Does it really
get the job done?

477
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:13,328
All right. Say you wake up
tomorrow morning...

478
00:32:13,372 --> 00:32:18,072
and, hypothetically, find some
fresh shit on your face.

479
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:19,833
Your cheek, maybe
a little bit in the beard.

480
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:21,573
What the hell?
I'm about to be fucking sick!

481
00:32:21,597 --> 00:32:22,685
What do you do?

482
00:32:22,729 --> 00:32:24,035
Do you go to a bathroom

483
00:32:24,078 --> 00:32:25,776
and tear off
a piece of dry tissue...

484
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,690
and rub it around
on your beard a little bit

485
00:32:27,734 --> 00:32:29,301
and then go on,
get on with your day?

486
00:32:29,344 --> 00:32:30,955
Go to church,
maybe dinner and a movie,

487
00:32:30,998 --> 00:32:32,130
like nothing happened?

488
00:32:32,173 --> 00:32:33,566
Where is this
coming from, man?

489
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:34,828
But something did happen.

490
00:32:34,872 --> 00:32:36,351
Your face smells like shit.
Right?

491
00:32:36,395 --> 00:32:37,962
So what you would do,

492
00:32:38,005 --> 00:32:40,268
is you would get some soap,
you'd get some hot water...

493
00:32:40,312 --> 00:32:42,662
and you would scrub
the fucking shit

494
00:32:42,705 --> 00:32:44,707
out of your beard
for 10 straight minutes.

495
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:46,448
You could not
scrub it enough.

496
00:32:46,492 --> 00:32:48,146
Are you trying
to make me feel disgusting?

497
00:32:48,189 --> 00:32:49,408
I'm starting to feel...

498
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:52,150
Toilet paper is
a pretty fine appetizer.

499
00:32:52,193 --> 00:32:54,500
But, then...

500
00:32:54,543 --> 00:32:56,850
Huggies Natural Care
wet wipes.

501
00:32:56,894 --> 00:32:58,286
That's your main course.

502
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:02,248
They're soft, they're moist.
They're for babies.

503
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:05,077
Finally, one more pass
with toilet paper,

504
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,035
maybe clear out
that excess moisture.

505
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:08,732
Maybe treat yourself
to a blow and go,

506
00:33:08,776 --> 00:33:10,082
if you can get you
a hair dryer.

507
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:12,475
Just about 30 seconds
would do you good.

508
00:33:16,175 --> 00:33:17,176
The fuck?

509
00:33:18,438 --> 00:33:19,482
Year.

510
00:33:20,483 --> 00:33:21,484
What?

511
00:33:22,703 --> 00:33:24,357
What year is it?

512
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,838
What kind of dumbass question
is that to ask?

513
00:33:57,607 --> 00:34:00,394
We have 8 weeks of
boot camp ahead of us, men.

514
00:34:00,437 --> 00:34:01,786
That'll get us
toned and prepared

515
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,397
for all manner of combat.

516
00:34:05,486 --> 00:34:09,707
Not working out at all.

517
00:34:09,751 --> 00:34:11,405
Masking tape.

518
00:34:11,448 --> 00:34:13,798
It is no friend
to chilled aluminum.

519
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,889
Velcro.
Color-coded, efficient,

520
00:34:16,932 --> 00:34:17,977
environmentally friendly.

521
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,327
Who is he talking to?

522
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,044
And why is he dressed like
a registered sex offender?

523
00:34:22,068 --> 00:34:24,070
Can we focus
for a moment, ladies?

524
00:34:24,113 --> 00:34:26,420
Please, we need to talk about
next month's meal plan.

525
00:34:26,463 --> 00:34:28,248
Obviously,
everyone hated the ceviche.

526
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:29,640
I read the suggestion box.

527
00:34:29,684 --> 00:34:31,294
I'm gonna stop you
right there.

528
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:33,340
I see through this weak act.

529
00:34:33,383 --> 00:34:37,735
You may have fooled Colossus
with this nice guy shit...

530
00:34:37,779 --> 00:34:38,954
but not me.

531
00:34:38,998 --> 00:34:40,086
Don't be mean.

532
00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:41,478
Back off, NTW.

533
00:34:41,522 --> 00:34:43,741
No, no, no. Let her go.

534
00:34:43,785 --> 00:34:44,960
Let her go, it's okay.

535
00:34:45,004 --> 00:34:46,570
She has a right
to be skeptical.

536
00:34:46,614 --> 00:34:49,225
Look at me.
I'm an easy target.

537
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,793
You know, historically,

538
00:34:51,836 --> 00:34:53,751
mischief has been
my mistress...

539
00:34:53,795 --> 00:34:56,450
so I understand, you know.
But I like to think...

540
00:34:58,061 --> 00:35:01,369
that you guys have
really rubbed off on me.

541
00:35:01,412 --> 00:35:03,492
I like to think that I've
rubbed off around you, too.

542
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,418
A lot.

543
00:35:07,462 --> 00:35:10,117
And for the first time
in a long while...

544
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,335
I like me.

545
00:35:13,555 --> 00:35:16,079
I accept your apology. I never apologized.

546
00:35:16,123 --> 00:35:17,689
I was talking to your heart.

547
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:20,127
See? You're not
lost cause you thought.

548
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:23,391
I'm proud. You're everything
I knew you can be.

549
00:35:23,434 --> 00:35:25,436
Thank you, Colossus.

550
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,090
Just trying to be
the world's best X-Man.

551
00:35:27,134 --> 00:35:28,570
Sorry, X-Person.

552
00:35:30,137 --> 00:35:32,835
Hmm. Something wrong
with the soap.

553
00:35:32,878 --> 00:35:34,489
It's fine.

554
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,752
I just filled it. Give it
a few more pumps there.

555
00:35:37,971 --> 00:35:40,451
Now, if you'll excuse me...

556
00:35:40,495 --> 00:35:42,279
it's dust bunny season...

557
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:43,324
and I'm hunting wabbits.

558
00:35:44,064 --> 00:35:45,152
Bye, Wade!

559
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,895
Fuck.
Fuck you.

560
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,128
No one is born perfect.

561
00:36:04,172 --> 00:36:06,174
But you can be.

562
00:36:06,217 --> 00:36:08,567
I know you're doing
what comes naturally.

563
00:36:12,876 --> 00:36:14,704
You can't help yourself.

564
00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:20,666
But you can.

565
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,800
It takes work, discipline...

566
00:36:23,843 --> 00:36:25,062
and treatment.

567
00:36:25,106 --> 00:36:26,803
Your abilities...

568
00:36:28,761 --> 00:36:31,547
I know how seductive they are.

569
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,724
How powerful
they make you feel.

570
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:37,292
But you must learn
never to use them...

571
00:36:37,335 --> 00:36:39,946
so they will never use you.

572
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,780
Please don't cry.

573
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:50,218
I'm going to help.

574
00:36:50,261 --> 00:36:53,438
I'm gonna make you feel
what you should feel.

575
00:36:53,482 --> 00:36:56,007
How you need to feel...

576
00:36:56,051 --> 00:36:59,402
every time you're tempted
to act upon your urges.

577
00:36:59,445 --> 00:37:03,362
Suck my mutant dick,
you four-eyed fuck.

578
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:18,986
Wade.

579
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,554
Wade!

580
00:37:21,598 --> 00:37:23,687
Come in!
Hey, I was just doing

581
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,645
a little bit
of light reading here...

582
00:37:25,689 --> 00:37:27,125
We have mission.

583
00:37:27,169 --> 00:37:28,692
Well, you guys be
safe out there.

584
00:37:28,735 --> 00:37:29,997
I'll be praying for you.

585
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:32,435
No, I want you to join.

586
00:37:33,653 --> 00:37:34,828
I'm sorry, what?

587
00:37:34,872 --> 00:37:36,482
You heard me.

588
00:37:36,526 --> 00:37:38,919
Trust me,
that's a terrible idea.

589
00:37:38,963 --> 00:37:40,051
I'm really not ready.

590
00:37:40,095 --> 00:37:41,792
You are ready. I'm not.

591
00:37:41,835 --> 00:37:43,707
Be at the X-Jet in five.

592
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,925
I can do thirty.

593
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:46,927
Now. I can do now.

594
00:37:46,971 --> 00:37:48,190
Final offer.

595
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:50,801
Irene Merryweather, WHIT News.

596
00:37:50,844 --> 00:37:52,846
Live here
at a breaking news situation

597
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:55,546
at the Essex House
for Mutant Rehabilitation.

598
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:57,548
A mutant boy
is appearing to have

599
00:37:57,591 --> 00:37:59,071
some sort of an incident...

600
00:37:59,115 --> 00:38:00,614
- with police here behind me.
- Get away from me!

601
00:38:00,638 --> 00:38:03,075
There are two police vehicles
that are overturned.

602
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,574
There are open fires. Fuck off! Stay back!

603
00:38:04,598 --> 00:38:05,662
A scene of
absolute chaos here.

604
00:38:05,686 --> 00:38:06,818
Calm down.

605
00:38:06,861 --> 00:38:09,473
I'll burn you!
You stay back!

606
00:38:10,213 --> 00:38:11,997
Get away from me!

607
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,521
You wanna fucking die?

608
00:38:29,536 --> 00:38:32,757
And it appears as if the X-Men
are arriving...

609
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,324
Scatter!

610
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:36,369
...with what appears
to be a trainee.

611
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:39,416
Everyone, calm down!
The pros are here. I...

612
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:40,634
We're the X-Men!

613
00:38:40,678 --> 00:38:43,202
A dated metaphor for racism
in the '60s.

614
00:38:43,246 --> 00:38:45,770
So, respect.

615
00:38:45,813 --> 00:38:47,075
At ease, Officer.

616
00:38:48,642 --> 00:38:50,166
What are you doing?

617
00:38:50,644 --> 00:38:51,950
My job!

618
00:38:51,993 --> 00:38:53,393
You're the one who said
I was ready,

619
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,954
and I frankly disagreed
with you.

620
00:38:54,997 --> 00:38:57,391
But here we are, trying to
overcome our differences.

621
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,872
Like Beyonce says, "Please...

622
00:39:00,699 --> 00:39:02,091
"Please, stop cheating on me."

623
00:39:02,135 --> 00:39:03,223
Hey!

624
00:39:03,267 --> 00:39:04,659
This is the fifth incident.

625
00:39:04,703 --> 00:39:06,922
This kid needs to be
in the Ice Box, not here.

626
00:39:06,966 --> 00:39:08,620
Russell belongs in our care.

627
00:39:08,663 --> 00:39:10,448
Not in prison.
I assure you...

628
00:39:10,491 --> 00:39:11,642
we have everything
under control.

629
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:12,774
Stay back!
I'll burn you!

630
00:39:12,798 --> 00:39:14,016
Not getting a real

631
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,149
"under control"
vibe here, Marty.

632
00:39:16,193 --> 00:39:18,238
It is Glen, isn't it? Daniel.

633
00:39:18,282 --> 00:39:19,500
I'll ask the questions,
Miguel.

634
00:39:19,544 --> 00:39:20,893
Let me talk to the kid.

635
00:39:20,936 --> 00:39:25,767
You stay here with your weird,
secret sex lips.

636
00:39:27,508 --> 00:39:28,553
You wanna die?

637
00:39:28,596 --> 00:39:29,791
This kid's adorable.

638
00:39:29,815 --> 00:39:30,835
I don't know why I packed
the hollow points.

639
00:39:30,859 --> 00:39:32,034
I'll burn your balls off!

640
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:35,429
First day.
I'm so nervous!

641
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,039
Did you just say
"hollow points"?

642
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,432
Yeah, probably should've

643
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:40,521
brought a Super Soaker.

644
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,088
Hi, there!

645
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,874
Stay back
or Justin Bieber dies!

646
00:39:45,918 --> 00:39:49,400
Justin Bieber.
He called you Justin Bieber.

647
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:52,466
Hold on! Wait, wait, wait!

648
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,624
Okay, let's not do
whatever that is.

649
00:39:55,668 --> 00:39:57,191
Okay? Let's just talk!

650
00:39:57,235 --> 00:39:58,845
It's Russell, right?

651
00:39:58,888 --> 00:40:01,151
Firefist.Firefist.

652
00:40:01,195 --> 00:40:03,415
Ooh, that's a great name.
Where does it burn?

653
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:05,258
Just the fist, or all the way
up to the elbow?

654
00:40:09,943 --> 00:40:12,598
Definitely all
the way up to the elbow.

655
00:40:12,641 --> 00:40:15,470
Come quietly,
or there will be trouble.

656
00:40:15,514 --> 00:40:18,299
You stole that from Robocop!
That's from Robocop!

657
00:40:18,343 --> 00:40:19,996
Just stand down!

658
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,129
You're embarrassing me.
Look, Fire...

659
00:40:23,478 --> 00:40:26,002
Oh, my God! I can't say it!
I'm so sorry!

660
00:40:30,529 --> 00:40:34,533
Oh, shit!
That fucking does it!

661
00:40:34,576 --> 00:40:35,969
Put your hands
behind your knees

662
00:40:36,012 --> 00:40:37,492
and get down
on your head! Now!

663
00:40:37,536 --> 00:40:39,799
Wade! What was first rule?

664
00:40:39,842 --> 00:40:41,801
Label everything
in the refrigerator!

665
00:40:41,844 --> 00:40:44,456
Do not escalate!
Rules are meant to be broken!

666
00:40:44,499 --> 00:40:45,935
That's the exact opposite

667
00:40:45,979 --> 00:40:47,328
of what they're meant for!

668
00:40:48,373 --> 00:40:50,331
Fuck! Fine!

669
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:51,986
I'll start from the beginning.

670
00:40:52,029 --> 00:40:54,380
My name is Deadpool,
and I'm an X-Man.

671
00:40:54,423 --> 00:40:56,382
Trainee! Shut it!

672
00:40:57,339 --> 00:40:59,602
Look, I get it.

673
00:41:00,777 --> 00:41:02,388
All right, you're scared.

674
00:41:02,953 --> 00:41:04,041
Alone.

675
00:41:04,085 --> 00:41:05,173
You got no family.

676
00:41:05,216 --> 00:41:06,281
I didn't have
a family, either.

677
00:41:06,305 --> 00:41:08,045
You live in this dump.
Guess what?

678
00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:09,786
I used to live in a shithole
just like it.

679
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,049
But you know something?

680
00:41:12,093 --> 00:41:13,834
A wise woman
once said to me...

681
00:41:13,877 --> 00:41:15,357
"Speak up."

682
00:41:15,401 --> 00:41:18,229
"I can't hear you with that
pity dick in your mouth."

683
00:41:18,273 --> 00:41:19,883
Too much? I went too far.

684
00:41:27,848 --> 00:41:29,371
That was effervescent.

685
00:41:29,415 --> 00:41:31,678
Stay in school, kid.

686
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:33,549
Or don't. I didn't.

687
00:41:33,593 --> 00:41:35,203
And I'm an X-Man.

688
00:41:35,246 --> 00:41:36,378
Trainee.

689
00:41:36,422 --> 00:41:37,771
Fuck it!

690
00:41:37,814 --> 00:41:39,555
Superhero landing coming up!

691
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,821
Ah, fuck, fuck, fuck!

692
00:41:44,865 --> 00:41:46,954
That is so not practical.

693
00:42:07,454 --> 00:42:09,586
I could get used
to this X-Man shit.

694
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,781
Trainee!

695
00:42:10,805 --> 00:42:12,023
Trainee!

696
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:13,851
Get a power restraint
on him. Now!

697
00:42:13,895 --> 00:42:17,115
Calm down, squirt.
It's over. We got ya.

698
00:42:18,987 --> 00:42:20,510
What's that do?

699
00:42:20,554 --> 00:42:22,077
Power-dampening collar.

700
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,426
Shuts down
all mutant abilities.

701
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:26,298
You can't get it off.
Unless you've got a grenade.

702
00:42:26,342 --> 00:42:29,345
Huh. Could've used
one of those in the first act.

703
00:42:29,389 --> 00:42:30,607
Thank you!

704
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:34,698
That was absolutely thrilling.

705
00:42:34,742 --> 00:42:36,961
True heroism in action.

706
00:42:37,005 --> 00:42:38,659
We are in your debt.

707
00:42:39,486 --> 00:42:41,139
We can take it from here.

708
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,403
Take me
to the Ice Box, please!

709
00:42:43,446 --> 00:42:44,621
Anywhere's better than here.

710
00:42:44,665 --> 00:42:45,927
Believe me, son,

711
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:47,711
you do not wanna go
to the Ice Box.

712
00:42:47,755 --> 00:42:50,367
That place makes Hitler's anus
look like Waikiki.

713
00:42:50,411 --> 00:42:52,282
Let's get you inside,
young man.

714
00:42:52,325 --> 00:42:54,327
No, wait, wait. Wait.

715
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:55,851
You guys stay there.

716
00:43:05,948 --> 00:43:07,558
Those guys hurt you?

717
00:43:08,994 --> 00:43:10,039
Who?

718
00:43:12,084 --> 00:43:14,783
Baldilocks? Jared Kushner?

719
00:43:16,262 --> 00:43:17,742
Both of 'em?

720
00:43:21,485 --> 00:43:23,182
Oh, fuck it.

721
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:24,793
Four or five moments!

722
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:25,881
I'm sorry?

723
00:43:25,924 --> 00:43:29,101
Four or five moments!

724
00:43:30,363 --> 00:43:33,105
That's all it takes
to be a hero.

725
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,457
People think
you wake up a hero...

726
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,633
brush your teeth a hero...

727
00:43:38,676 --> 00:43:41,592
ejaculate into
a soap dispenser a hero.

728
00:43:43,028 --> 00:43:46,728
But, no, being a hero
takes only a few moments!

729
00:43:48,077 --> 00:43:49,732
A few moments...

730
00:43:49,775 --> 00:43:52,474
doing the ugly stuff
no one else will do.

731
00:43:55,955 --> 00:43:57,087
No!

732
00:43:59,742 --> 00:44:01,023
Stand down!
Hold your fire!

733
00:44:01,047 --> 00:44:03,397
Wade, what did you do? Colossus, no!

734
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:06,705
You were right, Wade.
You are not X-Men material.

735
00:44:06,749 --> 00:44:09,055
No shit, Shiny Gandhi!

736
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:10,579
What was your first clue?

737
00:44:10,622 --> 00:44:13,756
The hollow point
through that fuckhead's face?

738
00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:15,105
That kid was abused!

739
00:44:15,148 --> 00:44:17,194
- You can always tell!
- We have rules!

740
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:19,979
You are not judge,
jury or executioner!

741
00:44:20,023 --> 00:44:22,982
Fuck your rules!
I fight for what's right!

742
00:44:23,026 --> 00:44:24,854
And sometimes
you gotta fight dirty!

743
00:44:24,897 --> 00:44:27,944
You let me down
for the last time, Wade.

744
00:44:31,077 --> 00:44:33,384
Okay,
get these guys in the pod.

745
00:44:33,427 --> 00:44:35,604
Take them to the Ice Box.

746
00:44:56,234 --> 00:44:57,235
Hey, baby!

747
00:44:58,323 --> 00:45:00,586
I wonder what gang
I'll be in.

748
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,109
Yeah!

749
00:45:02,153 --> 00:45:04,416
- Is there, like, a Sorting Hat?
- Hi.

750
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:07,680
I've always seen myself as

751
00:45:07,724 --> 00:45:09,116
more of
an East Coast Hufflepuff.

752
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,599
I've made a critical error
on my Airbnb reservation.

753
00:45:13,643 --> 00:45:17,516
This is not what the website
looked like at all.

754
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:20,824
I love the decor though.

755
00:45:20,867 --> 00:45:22,826
I had no idea
hopeless was a color.

756
00:45:22,869 --> 00:45:24,131
Hard left, douchebag.

757
00:45:28,658 --> 00:45:29,876
Please, after you.

758
00:45:32,009 --> 00:45:34,707
Another disgusting minority
off the streets.

759
00:45:34,751 --> 00:45:35,882
We'll sleep well tonight.

760
00:45:35,926 --> 00:45:36,970
Let's get a bagel.

761
00:45:40,234 --> 00:45:43,063
Nighty-night,
you annoying prick!

762
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:20,730
You're a long way
from your superpowers.

763
00:46:20,754 --> 00:46:23,191
Yeah. Just a touch of cancer.

764
00:46:23,235 --> 00:46:25,716
Not to worry,
we're old friends.

765
00:46:25,759 --> 00:46:26,978
Fuck!

766
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:29,197
I wanted to be a superhero.

767
00:46:29,241 --> 00:46:31,199
Always wanted
a real super suit.

768
00:46:31,243 --> 00:46:32,810
What happened?

769
00:46:32,853 --> 00:46:34,973
When was the last time you saw
a plus-sized superhero?

770
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:37,118
Never.

771
00:46:37,162 --> 00:46:38,946
The industry discriminates.

772
00:46:40,034 --> 00:46:42,123
Fuck superheroes.

773
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:44,430
The thing that
pisses me off the most...

774
00:46:44,473 --> 00:46:46,302
I never stood up
for myself in there.

775
00:46:47,913 --> 00:46:50,829
My whole life.

776
00:46:50,872 --> 00:46:54,354
I've been waiting for someone
to come and save me.

777
00:46:56,748 --> 00:46:59,707
Nobody's gonna sacrifice
anything for me.

778
00:47:03,842 --> 00:47:06,105
I gotta start taking care
of myself.

779
00:47:07,454 --> 00:47:10,196
I have a mission now.

780
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:12,894
The first thing I wanna do
when I get out of here...

781
00:47:12,938 --> 00:47:15,288
burn the headmaster alive...

782
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:19,031
and then take a selfie
with his smoldering corpse.

783
00:47:19,074 --> 00:47:21,511
Aw. That's, like,
my favorite part of the Bible.

784
00:47:23,252 --> 00:47:25,733
I don't have
a sock puppet on me...

785
00:47:25,777 --> 00:47:27,822
but what did he do to you?

786
00:47:27,866 --> 00:47:29,476
Did he taste the rainbow?

787
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:31,565
I'd whisper it,
but Skittles would sue us.

788
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,742
Fucker hates mutants.

789
00:47:34,786 --> 00:47:36,744
He tried to beat
the genes out of us.

790
00:47:36,788 --> 00:47:39,312
Nothing worse than
a "pray the gay away" type guy.

791
00:47:40,095 --> 00:47:41,488
Sick piece of shit.

792
00:47:42,881 --> 00:47:46,581
Tomorrow, we'll find
the biggest guy in here...

793
00:47:47,538 --> 00:47:49,236
and we'll make him our bitch!

794
00:47:53,153 --> 00:47:54,502
What was that?

795
00:47:54,545 --> 00:47:57,113
That is the biggest guy
in here.

796
00:47:57,157 --> 00:47:59,246
Fun fact about the Ice Box...

797
00:47:59,289 --> 00:48:01,117
though no one's ever seen it,

798
00:48:01,161 --> 00:48:03,380
they keep a monster
in the basement.

799
00:48:03,424 --> 00:48:05,165
Right next to a huge,

800
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:06,732
steaming bowl
of foreshadowing.

801
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,385
Look.

802
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,649
I can't protect you.

803
00:48:11,693 --> 00:48:12,825
With this collar on,

804
00:48:12,868 --> 00:48:16,002
my superpower
is just unbridled cancer.

805
00:48:16,045 --> 00:48:19,527
Give me a bow and arrow,
I'm basically Hawkeye.

806
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:21,659
Now, if you'll excuse me...

807
00:48:21,703 --> 00:48:24,880
I've got tumors to grow.
Vanessa awaits.

808
00:48:24,924 --> 00:48:27,404
I'll start by making us
a shank.

809
00:48:27,448 --> 00:48:29,363
Good listening. I stole that guard's pen...

810
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,365
and stashed it
in the old prison wallet,

811
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,801
if you know what I'm saying.

812
00:48:32,845 --> 00:48:35,325
I really hope I don't know
what you're saying.

813
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,765
I know it's in there,
I just need to get it out.

814
00:48:39,808 --> 00:48:41,897
Oh, Jesus Christ.

815
00:48:41,941 --> 00:48:44,596
I can hear you
rummaging around in there.

816
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,034
Do they make Purell
for your ears?

817
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,920
And to update you

818
00:48:52,953 --> 00:48:54,345
on the story reported earlier,

819
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:56,086
after a lengthy standoff

820
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:58,741
outside the Essex House
for Mutant Rehabilitation...

821
00:48:58,785 --> 00:49:00,090
two mutants were arrested

822
00:49:00,134 --> 00:49:01,875
and transported
to the Ice Box...

823
00:49:01,918 --> 00:49:03,398
Entering repair mode.

824
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,336
...several
police cars were destroyed

825
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,188
and the X-Men were called in
to restore order.

826
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,429
Cells seven and nine

827
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:37,867
now off-limits
for medical personnel.

828
00:49:37,911 --> 00:49:39,390
Cells seven and nine

829
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:42,176
now off-limits
for medical personnel.

830
00:49:43,918 --> 00:49:45,310
Psst!

831
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:49,967
Don't do that.

832
00:49:50,011 --> 00:49:52,883
What? Why are you
winking at me?

833
00:49:56,495 --> 00:49:57,888
I got your back.

834
00:49:57,932 --> 00:49:59,150
Oh, my God.

835
00:49:59,194 --> 00:50:00,717
You're sick,
I gotta protect you.

836
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,675
Just leave me alone, kid.

837
00:50:03,807 --> 00:50:04,852
Oh, great.

838
00:50:06,723 --> 00:50:09,247
Well, hello there, new fish.

839
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:12,337
It's nice to see some
fresh faces around here.

840
00:50:12,381 --> 00:50:14,644
I've done some
light catalog work...

841
00:50:14,687 --> 00:50:17,168
but, really, modeling is just
a stepping stone to acting.

842
00:50:17,212 --> 00:50:19,997
I was talking to him.Oh.

843
00:50:20,041 --> 00:50:23,435
Have we met?
I can't place your mustache.

844
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:26,134
Black Tom Cassidy. White Wade Wilson.

845
00:50:26,177 --> 00:50:29,615
What's your superpower?
Cultural appropriation?

846
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:32,227
You're supposed to be
the toughest cunt in here.

847
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:34,838
You don't look
like much to me.

848
00:50:34,882 --> 00:50:37,319
First rule of the yard,
fuckface...

849
00:50:37,362 --> 00:50:39,408
find the biggest guy
and make him your...

850
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:45,458
Second biggest guy.

851
00:50:45,502 --> 00:50:47,939
The last thing I need
is more hepatitis.

852
00:50:47,983 --> 00:50:51,551
Oh, it's slippery, too.
This table needs a wipe down!

853
00:50:51,595 --> 00:50:53,423
Can we get a wipe down
on the table?

854
00:50:54,728 --> 00:50:56,948
Kid, I think you picked
the wrong side.

855
00:50:56,992 --> 00:50:59,342
No, I didn't!
He's my friend!

856
00:50:59,385 --> 00:51:01,648
Zip it. We're not friends.

857
00:51:03,346 --> 00:51:04,626
You're about to get
dick-slapped.

858
00:51:17,012 --> 00:51:18,752
I had so much fun!
You were like...

859
00:51:18,796 --> 00:51:20,885
And I was like,
"Take a seat, shit dick."

860
00:51:20,929 --> 00:51:22,669
Just let me die in peace.

861
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:24,845
We make a great team!

862
00:51:24,889 --> 00:51:27,457
Oh, God! We're not a team.

863
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:31,852
Why'd you say that back there?
We're friends, partners.

864
00:51:31,896 --> 00:51:34,290
We're not partners
or friends.

865
00:51:35,726 --> 00:51:37,815
This doesn't end with us
riding into the sunset.

866
00:51:37,858 --> 00:51:40,035
It ends with me
dying of cancer...

867
00:51:40,078 --> 00:51:43,953
and you winning the Ice Box
award for softest mouth.

868
00:51:45,389 --> 00:51:46,999
There's only one person
in this world

869
00:51:47,043 --> 00:51:48,827
that I care about,
and she's gone.

870
00:51:50,611 --> 00:51:53,788
You wanna survive?

871
00:51:53,832 --> 00:51:57,140
Stop trying to shank
the biggest guys in here...

872
00:51:57,183 --> 00:51:59,055
and make friends with them.

873
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,971
Make friends with someone.

874
00:52:03,189 --> 00:52:04,799
Anyone but me.

875
00:52:05,975 --> 00:52:08,281
Maybe even Black Tim.

876
00:52:09,195 --> 00:52:10,805
Black Evan, I don't know.

877
00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:13,330
All I remember is
he was African-American.

878
00:52:58,811 --> 00:53:00,900
System malfunctioning.

879
00:53:00,943 --> 00:53:04,295
Cells 7, 12, 14, 27.

880
00:53:04,338 --> 00:53:06,601
Back in your cells, you filthy
mutants! Get in there!

881
00:53:06,645 --> 00:53:09,952
Cells 1, 3, 7, 8.

882
00:53:11,128 --> 00:53:12,568
Searching.

883
00:53:14,087 --> 00:53:16,437
Cell 04 located.

884
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:19,962
Door won't open!

885
00:53:20,006 --> 00:53:21,616
On your fucking knees!

886
00:53:58,567 --> 00:54:00,265
That was our cell.

887
00:54:02,397 --> 00:54:04,704
What did I do to piss off
a grumpy old fucker

888
00:54:04,747 --> 00:54:05,922
with a Winter Soldier arm?

889
00:54:15,193 --> 00:54:17,108
Get away from me, kid!

890
00:54:24,724 --> 00:54:25,942
Listen to me! Go!

891
00:54:31,426 --> 00:54:32,732
Hello, Russell.

892
00:56:16,316 --> 00:56:17,317
Who are you?

893
00:56:18,231 --> 00:56:19,449
I'm Batman.

894
00:56:30,895 --> 00:56:31,940
Ooh!

895
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:39,557
Oh. That's got some zip.

896
00:56:48,087 --> 00:56:50,873
Don't feel bad.
Even I can't kill me.

897
00:56:51,569 --> 00:56:53,136
Talk!

898
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:54,964
What kind of
spineless shit stick

899
00:56:55,007 --> 00:56:56,357
tries to kill
a 14-year-old boy?

900
00:56:57,662 --> 00:56:59,185
You might wanna start talking!

901
00:56:59,229 --> 00:57:01,469
'Cause I got a long history of
firing at times like this!

902
00:57:02,841 --> 00:57:04,843
The name's Cable.

903
00:57:04,887 --> 00:57:07,542
I'm from the future.
Just walk away.

904
00:57:08,238 --> 00:57:09,544
Oh!

905
00:57:09,587 --> 00:57:11,546
So, you're from the future.

906
00:57:11,589 --> 00:57:13,548
I have
three questions then.

907
00:57:13,591 --> 00:57:17,203
One, is dubstep still a thing?

908
00:57:17,247 --> 00:57:19,728
Two, do people still homebrew?

909
00:57:19,771 --> 00:57:22,339
And three,
does Dopinder ever find love?

910
00:58:06,515 --> 00:58:08,299
Dubstep's for pussies.

911
00:58:08,343 --> 00:58:09,648
You're so dark!

912
00:58:09,692 --> 00:58:11,781
Are you sure you're not
from the DC universe?

913
00:58:12,521 --> 00:58:14,087
I love dubstep!

914
00:58:40,376 --> 00:58:41,812
Is that a fanny pack?

915
00:58:41,855 --> 00:58:44,423
I used to have one of those
in 1990-never.

916
00:58:45,424 --> 00:58:47,513
Something to remember you by.

917
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:51,343
Give me that back!
That goes with me everywhere.

918
00:58:51,387 --> 00:58:53,737
Like the memory
of your fucking fanny pack!

919
00:59:03,486 --> 00:59:05,575
Why are you protecting
the kid?

920
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,187
I don't give a fuck
about him...

921
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:11,624
and his Are You My Mother?
complex!

922
00:59:13,974 --> 00:59:15,236
What's this one do?

923
00:59:29,425 --> 00:59:31,035
In every film,
there's a moment

924
00:59:31,078 --> 00:59:33,472
when the hero
hits rock bottom.

925
00:59:33,516 --> 00:59:35,475
InCool Runnings,
it was when John Candy's

926
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:37,477
prized bobsled broke.

927
00:59:37,521 --> 00:59:40,262
InHuman Centipede,
it was when those people...

928
00:59:40,306 --> 00:59:41,873
signed on to be in that movie.

929
00:59:41,916 --> 00:59:44,049
But in this film, well...

930
00:59:44,092 --> 00:59:45,311
you're looking at it.

931
00:59:45,354 --> 00:59:47,095
On your fucking knees, mutant.

932
00:59:50,011 --> 00:59:51,012
Rock...

933
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,540
meet bottom.

934
01:00:07,246 --> 01:00:08,397
I love you, Wade Wilson.

935
01:00:08,421 --> 01:00:09,596
Ness?

936
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:12,120
Hey, Ness!

937
01:00:12,991 --> 01:00:14,819
Ness, can you let me in?

938
01:00:14,862 --> 01:00:16,951
Please! Please.

939
01:00:19,127 --> 01:00:20,259
Jesus.

940
01:00:23,175 --> 01:00:24,935
You're not giving me
a lot of direction here.

941
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,787
I'm at the end of my rope.

942
01:00:29,268 --> 01:00:31,618
Then I joined the X-Men.

943
01:00:31,662 --> 01:00:33,491
I went to prison. I, uh...

944
01:00:37,582 --> 01:00:39,105
Is it the kid?

945
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:44,066
Kids give us a chance to be
better than we used to be.

946
01:00:45,503 --> 01:00:46,504
The kid!

947
01:01:00,126 --> 01:01:01,736
That's exactly what she meant.

948
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:03,192
Your heart needs to be
in the right place.

949
01:01:03,216 --> 01:01:05,087
I'm not gonna
abandon this kid.

950
01:01:05,131 --> 01:01:07,742
He's never had anyone, ever.

951
01:01:07,786 --> 01:01:09,135
I need to be selfless.

952
01:01:09,178 --> 01:01:11,137
Yeah, but what does
that mean?

953
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:14,444
It means
I'm gonna save Russell.

954
01:01:14,488 --> 01:01:16,011
Maybe I couldn't
save Vanessa...

955
01:01:16,055 --> 01:01:19,058
but maybe I can save a robust
teenager from New Zealand.

956
01:01:19,101 --> 01:01:21,166
Yeah, but what I mean is,
like, the world "selfless."

957
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:22,714
I literally don't know
what that means.

958
01:01:22,757 --> 01:01:23,932
Jesus Christ.

959
01:01:23,976 --> 01:01:26,718
Okay, look.
According to my guy, okay...

960
01:01:26,761 --> 01:01:28,589
those muties
are being transferred

961
01:01:28,633 --> 01:01:30,460
to a supermax, 80 miles away.

962
01:01:30,504 --> 01:01:32,333
Great, I'll pick 'em off
along the way.

963
01:01:32,376 --> 01:01:34,553
Hold your testicles there,
buddy, okay?

964
01:01:34,596 --> 01:01:36,598
We're talking about
an armored convoy...

965
01:01:36,642 --> 01:01:39,253
and a vicious super soldier
from the future...

966
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:41,647
that is looking to turn your
skull into a fuckable ashtray.

967
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:43,170
You know what we need to do?

968
01:01:43,213 --> 01:01:45,085
We need to build
a fucking team.

969
01:01:45,128 --> 01:01:47,217
We need 'em tough,
morally flexible...

970
01:01:47,261 --> 01:01:48,654
and young enough
so they can carry

971
01:01:48,697 --> 01:01:49,892
this franchise 10 to 12 years.

972
01:01:49,916 --> 01:01:51,787
A team of
highly-skilled motherfuckers.

973
01:01:51,831 --> 01:01:54,877
I'm talking about some
Ocean's 14shit. Rogue Two.

974
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:57,358
John Wick 3,but with
the original director.

975
01:01:57,401 --> 01:01:59,316
My body is an
instrument of death.

976
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,709
Not now, Dopinder.

977
01:02:00,753 --> 01:02:02,232
I could be of great use.

978
01:02:02,276 --> 01:02:03,843
What's your superpower?

979
01:02:05,671 --> 01:02:07,324
Courage. That's adorable.

980
01:02:07,368 --> 01:02:09,041
Do you have the courage
to check and see...

981
01:02:09,065 --> 01:02:11,459
if there are enough sanitary
napkins in the dispenser?

982
01:02:11,502 --> 01:02:12,547
Yes, sir.

983
01:02:12,591 --> 01:02:13,853
I'm sorry
you had to see that,

984
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:16,246
although I'm glad
you heard it.

985
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:18,205
All right, I'll put out
a call for resumes.

986
01:02:18,248 --> 01:02:20,511
But we're not paying
medical or dental.

987
01:02:20,555 --> 01:02:22,601
It's time to get back
on LinkedIn.

988
01:02:59,464 --> 01:03:01,118
Attention, all inmates!

989
01:03:01,162 --> 01:03:03,599
Transport to Cross Force
Maximum Security

990
01:03:03,643 --> 01:03:05,122
Mutant Containment Facility...

991
01:03:05,166 --> 01:03:07,124
will begin at 0800 hours.

992
01:03:07,168 --> 01:03:09,170
Inspection of your cells
and out processing

993
01:03:09,213 --> 01:03:11,259
will begin at 0600.

994
01:03:19,571 --> 01:03:20,660
Oi.

995
01:03:20,703 --> 01:03:22,052
What the fuck
do you want?

996
01:03:22,096 --> 01:03:23,924
That's my fucking pudding.

997
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:25,969
Fuck your pudding! You like pudding?

998
01:03:46,991 --> 01:03:47,992
Hello?

999
01:03:50,299 --> 01:03:52,649
I know you're in there.

1000
01:04:08,317 --> 01:04:10,623
Must be hard
being the biggest guy in here.

1001
01:04:11,886 --> 01:04:14,192
Lonely at the top, eh?

1002
01:04:14,236 --> 01:04:16,194
They're moving us tomorrow.

1003
01:04:18,675 --> 01:04:20,459
Maybe I can get you
out of here.

1004
01:04:21,678 --> 01:04:24,812
And we can make
the whole world our bitch.

1005
01:04:26,683 --> 01:04:28,424
We need a secret code.

1006
01:04:31,645 --> 01:04:34,083
No,
that's stupid, Russell. Idiot.

1007
01:04:41,351 --> 01:04:42,874
We're a team.

1008
01:04:42,918 --> 01:04:44,876
We're like thugs,
we're like gangsters.

1009
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,575
I'm like Tupac,
and you're like Ice Cube.

1010
01:04:48,619 --> 01:04:49,727
Supposedly,
she can rap, too.

1011
01:04:49,751 --> 01:04:50,839
Yeah.

1012
01:04:50,882 --> 01:04:51,927
I like that.

1013
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:53,624
Terrific,
these are all terrific.

1014
01:04:53,667 --> 01:04:55,408
Meet Bedlam.

1015
01:04:55,452 --> 01:04:57,715
Cool name! Superpowers?

1016
01:04:57,759 --> 01:04:59,282
I can distort
electrical fields.

1017
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,720
Including the one
inside your brain...

1018
01:05:02,764 --> 01:05:05,462
causing anxiety, confusion...

1019
01:05:05,505 --> 01:05:07,507
pain.

1020
01:05:07,551 --> 01:05:09,640
So, basically,
you're Dave Matthews.

1021
01:05:09,683 --> 01:05:10,815
We can use him.

1022
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:14,253
I'm Zeitgeist.

1023
01:05:14,297 --> 01:05:15,602
Cool. I like it.

1024
01:05:15,646 --> 01:05:16,908
So you have the power

1025
01:05:16,952 --> 01:05:19,302
to put your finger
on the pulse of society?

1026
01:05:20,346 --> 01:05:21,521
No.

1027
01:05:21,565 --> 01:05:23,132
No, I spit acidic vomit.

1028
01:05:23,175 --> 01:05:24,307
Oh.Do you want me

1029
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:25,743
to demonstrate? DEADPOOL: No!

1030
01:05:25,787 --> 01:05:27,266
We'll take
your word for it.

1031
01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:29,463
Thank you. Yeah. Listen,
we've all eaten at Arby's, okay?

1032
01:05:29,487 --> 01:05:32,098
And this is the Vanisher.

1033
01:05:35,449 --> 01:05:36,450
But...

1034
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:39,105
Vanisher!

1035
01:05:41,629 --> 01:05:43,283
Nice! Right?

1036
01:05:44,589 --> 01:05:45,720
He's not here, is he?

1037
01:05:45,764 --> 01:05:47,287
He may be running late.

1038
01:05:48,898 --> 01:05:51,726
My name's Rusty,
but I go by Shatterstar.

1039
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:52,989
That's good, yeah.

1040
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:55,165
"Rusty" is terrible.Toughie.

1041
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:58,037
So, uh, where are you from?
The planet Mojo World.

1042
01:05:58,081 --> 01:06:00,126
So you're an alien, I guess. Bad name.

1043
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:01,867
How does that, uh, help us?

1044
01:06:01,911 --> 01:06:04,827
I'm basically better
than you at everything.

1045
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:06,587
Just once, I'm gonna find
a planet of people

1046
01:06:06,611 --> 01:06:08,178
that are worse than me
at everything.

1047
01:06:08,221 --> 01:06:10,441
A whole bunch
of functional idiots.

1048
01:06:10,484 --> 01:06:12,419
I'm gonna go there, and I'm
gonna be their Superman.

1049
01:06:12,443 --> 01:06:13,574
Isn't that Canada?

1050
01:06:13,618 --> 01:06:16,012
You shut your
goddamn trash mouth!

1051
01:06:17,187 --> 01:06:18,710
Meet... Domino.

1052
01:06:18,753 --> 01:06:20,799
What's your shtick? I'm lucky.

1053
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:22,235
That's not a superpower.

1054
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:23,410
Yeah, it is. No, it isn't.

1055
01:06:23,454 --> 01:06:24,716
Yes, it is. No, it isn't.

1056
01:06:24,759 --> 01:06:25,804
Yeah, it is. No, it isn't.

1057
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:26,892
Yes, it is. No, it isn't.

1058
01:06:26,936 --> 01:06:27,957
Yeah, it is. Really isn't.

1059
01:06:27,981 --> 01:06:29,200
No, it isn't.Yes, it is.

1060
01:06:29,243 --> 01:06:30,418
Told you.

1061
01:06:30,462 --> 01:06:31,811
Get out of my head!

1062
01:06:31,855 --> 01:06:33,465
I'm not in your head.

1063
01:06:33,508 --> 01:06:34,858
I'm in an
11-year-old's bedroom.

1064
01:06:34,901 --> 01:06:36,033
Well, if you're so lucky,

1065
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:37,686
then what are you
doing here with us?

1066
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:38,862
I don't know yet.

1067
01:06:38,905 --> 01:06:40,428
What's that supposed to mean?

1068
01:06:40,472 --> 01:06:41,753
There's a reason why I'm here,
and I'll know when I know.

1069
01:06:41,777 --> 01:06:43,581
Everything usually
just kind of works out for me.

1070
01:06:43,605 --> 01:06:45,433
Like 2008 Ryan Reynolds.

1071
01:06:46,739 --> 01:06:47,871
I don't know who that is.

1072
01:06:47,914 --> 01:06:49,394
You're hired.

1073
01:06:49,437 --> 01:06:50,482
Lucky me.

1074
01:06:50,525 --> 01:06:51,744
I like her!

1075
01:06:52,876 --> 01:06:54,181
And last, but not least...

1076
01:06:54,225 --> 01:06:55,356
Peter.

1077
01:06:56,749 --> 01:06:59,273
Am I getting
catfished here or...?

1078
01:06:59,317 --> 01:07:01,232
Any powers you wanna
tell us about?

1079
01:07:01,275 --> 01:07:02,886
No.

1080
01:07:02,929 --> 01:07:04,626
I don't have one.

1081
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:05,976
Um, I just saw the ad.

1082
01:07:06,019 --> 01:07:07,803
No superpowers at all?

1083
01:07:07,847 --> 01:07:10,937
Uh, I have both
Type 1 and 2 Diabetes.

1084
01:07:11,459 --> 01:07:12,808
Ow! Oh!

1085
01:07:12,852 --> 01:07:13,984
That's all the diabetes.

1086
01:07:14,027 --> 01:07:15,333
Right?
Yeah, you got 'em all.

1087
01:07:15,376 --> 01:07:17,291
If you find a Type 3,
let us know.

1088
01:07:17,813 --> 01:07:18,858
Yeah.

1089
01:07:18,902 --> 01:07:19,990
You're in.

1090
01:07:20,033 --> 01:07:21,556
Yeah. Fuck!

1091
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:25,343
It's fulfilling work.

1092
01:07:30,436 --> 01:07:31,741
Let's go!

1093
01:07:45,364 --> 01:07:47,975
This is Convoy 17
departing the Ice Box.

1094
01:07:48,019 --> 01:07:49,368
We are en route.

1095
01:07:56,984 --> 01:07:59,334
Peacetime makes people soft.

1096
01:08:00,945 --> 01:08:02,729
I was born into war.

1097
01:08:04,252 --> 01:08:05,427
Bred into it.

1098
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:08,343
Okay.

1099
01:08:08,387 --> 01:08:10,737
What's the most pain
you've ever felt?

1100
01:08:12,695 --> 01:08:13,958
These restraints are pretty...

1101
01:08:14,001 --> 01:08:15,872
People think
they understand pain.

1102
01:08:15,916 --> 01:08:17,352
They have no concept of it

1103
01:08:17,396 --> 01:08:19,354
beyond their own
worst experience.

1104
01:08:20,965 --> 01:08:24,142
5 years old. That's what?

1105
01:08:24,185 --> 01:08:25,753
A bee sting.

1106
01:08:25,796 --> 01:08:26,928
Oh, yeah.

1107
01:08:26,972 --> 01:08:29,496
20 years old, shrapnel.

1108
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:32,238
40 years old, disease.

1109
01:08:32,281 --> 01:08:36,851
Maybe the kind that leaves you
more machine than man.

1110
01:08:36,894 --> 01:08:38,294
Yeah, getting old's
not for sissies.

1111
01:08:38,331 --> 01:08:39,985
That's what my
Grandma Ginny used to...

1112
01:08:40,028 --> 01:08:41,203
I've got a list.

1113
01:08:41,987 --> 01:08:43,945
We're gonna work down it.

1114
01:08:44,641 --> 01:08:45,642
Together.

1115
01:08:46,817 --> 01:08:49,864
Number one,
I'm gonna bend something.

1116
01:08:49,907 --> 01:08:52,214
Something that was not
meant to bend.

1117
01:08:52,258 --> 01:08:53,409
I'm gonna
stop you right there

1118
01:08:53,433 --> 01:08:54,758
because I'm not gonna
make it to two.

1119
01:08:54,782 --> 01:08:56,088
I won't even
make it to one.

1120
01:08:56,131 --> 01:08:57,872
I don't do well with pain,
you know.

1121
01:08:57,915 --> 01:09:00,266
If I stub my toe,
I'm done for the day.

1122
01:09:00,309 --> 01:09:02,703
I cried when they
canceled Felicity.

1123
01:09:02,746 --> 01:09:04,594
When I get really scared,
I get nervous erections.

1124
01:09:04,618 --> 01:09:06,011
I have one right now.

1125
01:09:06,054 --> 01:09:07,621
Don't look.
It'll only make it worse.

1126
01:09:07,664 --> 01:09:08,796
I don't want you
to hurt me,

1127
01:09:08,839 --> 01:09:11,016
and I'll tell you
anything you wanna know.

1128
01:09:12,017 --> 01:09:14,149
Except for where they are.

1129
01:09:14,193 --> 01:09:15,474
Russell's in a convoy
heading southbound

1130
01:09:15,498 --> 01:09:16,891
on Gerry Duggan Parkway.

1131
01:09:16,934 --> 01:09:18,260
The monster's with them.
I wouldn't fuck with him.

1132
01:09:18,284 --> 01:09:19,763
You all know the plan.

1133
01:09:19,807 --> 01:09:21,548
Intercept the convoy,

1134
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:23,593
grab the boy.
But not inappropriately!

1135
01:09:23,637 --> 01:09:24,987
You know what,

1136
01:09:25,031 --> 01:09:26,554
I wouldn't fuck with
Deadpool either.

1137
01:09:26,597 --> 01:09:28,730
Because he's built a team.
He's unstoppable.

1138
01:09:28,773 --> 01:09:31,472
He has an ass pen.
He'll stab you with it.

1139
01:09:31,515 --> 01:09:34,127
Watch out for this guy, Cable!

1140
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:37,434
He's very short, 5'11".
Not like in the comics.

1141
01:09:37,478 --> 01:09:40,568
And if we succeed,
we all go home early.

1142
01:09:40,611 --> 01:09:42,691
So if you go after
them, Cable, I warn you...

1143
01:09:43,484 --> 01:09:45,181
there's a wind advisory
in effect.

1144
01:09:56,323 --> 01:09:57,963
A little turbulent up here.

1145
01:10:05,332 --> 01:10:07,116
I don't know much
about this Cable fella...

1146
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,552
but I guarantee
he hasn't killed

1147
01:10:08,596 --> 01:10:10,337
as many people
as melanoma has.

1148
01:10:11,729 --> 01:10:13,122
We're getting close!

1149
01:10:13,166 --> 01:10:14,863
As a former X-Man...

1150
01:10:14,906 --> 01:10:16,821
Trainee. Thank you, Bedlam.

1151
01:10:16,865 --> 01:10:19,215
I was always appalled
by the blatant sexism

1152
01:10:19,259 --> 01:10:20,869
in the group's name.

1153
01:10:20,912 --> 01:10:22,958
X-Men! Men!

1154
01:10:23,001 --> 01:10:26,005
The point is, our group
will be forward thinking.

1155
01:10:26,049 --> 01:10:27,355
Gender neutral.

1156
01:10:27,398 --> 01:10:29,705
From now on,
we'll be known as...

1157
01:10:31,968 --> 01:10:33,317
X-Force.

1158
01:10:33,361 --> 01:10:35,145
Isn't that
a little derivative?

1159
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:37,582
I don't recall asking
your opinion, Peter!

1160
01:10:38,844 --> 01:10:40,281
That wasn't me.

1161
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:49,681
Hang the laundry out
at 1,300 feet...

1162
01:10:49,725 --> 01:10:51,553
intercept the convoy,
and grab the boy.

1163
01:10:51,596 --> 01:10:52,704
Let's bring on
the carnage, baby!

1164
01:10:52,728 --> 01:10:54,599
Get me on the ground,
watch me go!

1165
01:10:54,643 --> 01:10:55,774
Yeah!

1166
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:57,515
I can't wait to kill!

1167
01:10:57,559 --> 01:11:00,301
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1168
01:11:00,344 --> 01:11:03,042
I just wanna say
how proud I am of this team.

1169
01:11:03,086 --> 01:11:05,958
You know,
you guys look amazing!

1170
01:11:06,002 --> 01:11:08,874
Vanisher, I have no doubt
you look amazing too.

1171
01:11:08,918 --> 01:11:10,049
This is the family

1172
01:11:10,093 --> 01:11:11,773
that I've always dreamed
of having and I...

1173
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:13,618
Ah, shit.

1174
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:16,926
I just get a little choked up
sometimes.

1175
01:11:16,969 --> 01:11:18,797
I hate to interrupt,
but is anybody nervous

1176
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:20,190
about the high winds?

1177
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:21,583
Gary. My name's Peter.

1178
01:11:21,626 --> 01:11:23,542
I realize that you're
new to this, but relax.

1179
01:11:23,586 --> 01:11:25,240
You've been chosen
by a higher power.

1180
01:11:25,283 --> 01:11:27,590
Did he just call himself God?
I think he did.

1181
01:11:27,633 --> 01:11:29,200
I'd like to go home. And I'd like...

1182
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:31,768
the McRib to be available
year round,

1183
01:11:31,811 --> 01:11:33,639
but sometimes dreams
don't come true.

1184
01:11:33,683 --> 01:11:35,859
I spent 10 years
in Special Forces.

1185
01:11:35,902 --> 01:11:37,053
You think we didn't
jump out of the plane

1186
01:11:37,077 --> 01:11:39,036
because of a light breeze?

1187
01:11:39,079 --> 01:11:41,343
You're in this shit now,
Mustache!

1188
01:11:41,386 --> 01:11:43,364
I'm only yelling
to impress the other guys.

1189
01:11:43,388 --> 01:11:45,695
I'd never let anything
happen to you, Sugarbear.

1190
01:11:45,738 --> 01:11:47,958
Leonard, hit it!

1191
01:11:56,662 --> 01:11:58,708
Go! Go! Go!

1192
01:12:34,397 --> 01:12:35,833
Let's get some!

1193
01:12:35,876 --> 01:12:37,051
Whoo!

1194
01:12:37,095 --> 01:12:38,270
Oh, yeah!

1195
01:12:38,314 --> 01:12:41,142
Convoy, 12 o'clock!
On my command!

1196
01:12:42,187 --> 01:12:43,667
Deploy! Oh, hey now!

1197
01:12:43,710 --> 01:12:44,972
Whoa!

1198
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:52,153
Little off course here.

1199
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:57,158
Holy mommy fucking shit!

1200
01:12:57,898 --> 01:12:59,335
Ah, there they are.

1201
01:12:59,378 --> 01:13:02,990
Look at these gorgeous
sons of bitches.

1202
01:13:03,034 --> 01:13:04,949
Oh, yeah!
That's right, Bedlam!

1203
01:13:10,041 --> 01:13:14,306
No! Tripping
motherfucking billies!

1204
01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:17,440
Shatterstar.
Okay, you got this.

1205
01:13:18,223 --> 01:13:19,268
Left!

1206
01:13:19,311 --> 01:13:20,660
Left!

1207
01:13:20,704 --> 01:13:22,968
You'd have to be insane
to take off in this.

1208
01:13:23,011 --> 01:13:25,231
No, stage left, you idiot!

1209
01:13:29,148 --> 01:13:30,671
Well, I guess
we found something

1210
01:13:30,715 --> 01:13:31,803
you're not better at.

1211
01:13:34,022 --> 01:13:35,328
Vanisher.

1212
01:13:35,372 --> 01:13:37,156
Maybe the wind can't blow
what it can't see.

1213
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:41,726
Oh! Really?

1214
01:13:41,769 --> 01:13:44,119
All right,
we could do this with four.

1215
01:13:44,163 --> 01:13:47,166
Sugarbear.
You got this, buddy!

1216
01:13:47,209 --> 01:13:49,299
That's the stuff!
That's the X-Force spirit!

1217
01:13:50,517 --> 01:13:52,606
Never underestimate
a man with a mustache!

1218
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:54,216
Just ask anyone in Brooklyn.

1219
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:55,435
We did it!

1220
01:13:55,479 --> 01:13:57,045
You're a goddamn
superhero, you!

1221
01:13:57,089 --> 01:13:58,177
X-Force!

1222
01:13:58,786 --> 01:13:59,874
X-Force.

1223
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:06,141
Oh!

1224
01:14:09,841 --> 01:14:10,885
Peter.

1225
01:14:10,929 --> 01:14:12,234
I got you, buddy!

1226
01:14:12,278 --> 01:14:13,473
You're gonna be fine!
This is not good, man!

1227
01:14:13,497 --> 01:14:15,803
You got this, big guy!
Here we go, Peter!

1228
01:14:15,847 --> 01:14:17,327
Look at me.
We're X-Force, right?

1229
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,459
Yeah, we're X-Force. We're X-Force.

1230
01:14:23,508 --> 01:14:25,553
Oh, my God!
What the fuck?

1231
01:14:25,597 --> 01:14:27,599
Fucking acidic vomit!

1232
01:14:29,165 --> 01:14:31,951
Oh, God! I'm gonna throw up
in my mask.

1233
01:14:35,041 --> 01:14:37,435
Okay,
I'm over the convoy.

1234
01:14:37,478 --> 01:14:39,915
Where did the rest
of the team land?

1235
01:14:39,959 --> 01:14:41,613
Good news and bad news.

1236
01:14:41,656 --> 01:14:44,790
Bad news is
the whole team is dead.

1237
01:14:44,833 --> 01:14:46,139
The good news is,

1238
01:14:46,182 --> 01:14:48,010
I don't think anyone's
gonna miss Shatterstar.

1239
01:14:48,054 --> 01:14:51,405
He was a bit of a prick.
Oh, but Paul!

1240
01:14:51,449 --> 01:14:52,450
Peter!

1241
01:14:52,493 --> 01:14:53,973
Peter, I'm gonna
miss him most.

1242
01:14:54,016 --> 01:14:55,148
But there is
a slight chance

1243
01:14:55,191 --> 01:14:56,541
Vanisher could make it.

1244
01:14:56,584 --> 01:14:59,195
Nope, no chance. He's dead.

1245
01:14:59,239 --> 01:15:00,414
The whole team?

1246
01:15:00,458 --> 01:15:02,329
Only the main ones.
We're still good.

1247
01:15:02,373 --> 01:15:03,635
Fuck, you are dumb.

1248
01:15:03,678 --> 01:15:05,332
Whoever planned this stunt's

1249
01:15:05,376 --> 01:15:07,552
been smoking
a lot jazz cabbage.

1250
01:15:07,595 --> 01:15:08,727
I'll tell you that much.

1251
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:10,424
That's pretty obvious!

1252
01:15:10,468 --> 01:15:12,208
Looking good, Vanisher.

1253
01:15:22,045 --> 01:15:23,917
They're headed
into the tunnel.

1254
01:15:24,918 --> 01:15:26,398
I'm that kid's only hope,

1255
01:15:26,441 --> 01:15:28,312
so sit tight
and wait for my word.

1256
01:15:29,052 --> 01:15:30,358
Whatever.

1257
01:15:30,402 --> 01:15:31,925
We're gonna lose 'em.
I'm dropping in.

1258
01:15:31,968 --> 01:15:34,362
Uh, that's
a negative, sole survivor.

1259
01:15:34,406 --> 01:15:36,930
Luck is not a superpower!
We are so fucked!

1260
01:15:36,973 --> 01:15:40,063
No, we most certainly
are not fucked.

1261
01:15:43,153 --> 01:15:45,808
Seriously,
I don't get it!

1262
01:15:45,852 --> 01:15:48,332
What, you shoot luck lasers
out of your eyes?

1263
01:15:50,509 --> 01:15:52,336
It's just
it's hard to picture.

1264
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:54,469
And certainly
not very cinematic.

1265
01:15:57,167 --> 01:15:58,778
I mean, luck?

1266
01:15:58,821 --> 01:16:01,389
What coked out,
glass pipe-sucking

1267
01:16:01,433 --> 01:16:02,782
freakshow comic book artist...

1268
01:16:02,825 --> 01:16:04,479
came up
with that little chestnut?

1269
01:16:04,523 --> 01:16:06,786
Probably a guy
who can't draw feet!

1270
01:16:17,884 --> 01:16:21,192
Once again, it all falls
on my shoulders.

1271
01:16:21,236 --> 01:16:22,474
It's why I'm cursed to be
a solo act.

1272
01:16:22,498 --> 01:16:23,519
Wander the Earth... I'm in.

1273
01:16:23,543 --> 01:16:25,066
I'm sorry, what did you say?

1274
01:16:25,109 --> 01:16:26,241
I'm in.

1275
01:16:26,284 --> 01:16:28,156
How in the fuck
are you in already?

1276
01:16:28,591 --> 01:16:30,419
Oh, shit.

1277
01:16:30,463 --> 01:16:31,681
It's Cable. 12 o'clock.

1278
01:16:31,725 --> 01:16:32,856
Okay.

1279
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:35,337
New plan. Use all of your
imaginary powers

1280
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:38,122
to stop Cable
from killing that kid.

1281
01:16:38,166 --> 01:16:39,776
I'm coming up on your six.

1282
01:16:48,045 --> 01:16:50,091
That gun is amazing!

1283
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:01,276
Hey!
Asshole!

1284
01:17:01,319 --> 01:17:02,930
Where is he?
I can't see him.

1285
01:17:02,973 --> 01:17:04,714
He's on top of you.

1286
01:17:04,758 --> 01:17:06,629
He's tearing you open!

1287
01:17:06,673 --> 01:17:08,588
He's going in
through the back!

1288
01:17:08,631 --> 01:17:09,763
Oh, God, he's inside!

1289
01:17:09,806 --> 01:17:11,112
You hear yourself, right?

1290
01:17:11,155 --> 01:17:12,611
Accidental double entendres!

1291
01:17:12,635 --> 01:17:15,159
Russell! Russell Collins!

1292
01:17:15,203 --> 01:17:17,118
Hands off that kid,
John Connor!

1293
01:17:22,124 --> 01:17:23,125
No, no, no!

1294
01:17:27,477 --> 01:17:28,565
Shit!

1295
01:17:50,544 --> 01:17:52,458
Two can play that game!

1296
01:17:54,591 --> 01:17:56,419
Got it! No, I don't.

1297
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:58,464
Showtime, mama!

1298
01:17:58,508 --> 01:18:00,118
Lady Luck, take the wheel.

1299
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:39,744
I'd ask who you are, but
you'll be dead in a second.

1300
01:18:39,768 --> 01:18:41,857
I'm Domino, and doubtful.

1301
01:18:58,438 --> 01:18:59,439
Hang in there, Doms!

1302
01:19:00,745 --> 01:19:02,442
Oh, this is really hard.

1303
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:16,117
And give me back
my Skee-Ball token.

1304
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:21,158
You're doing great.X-Force.

1305
01:19:23,116 --> 01:19:25,162
I guess dubstep never dies.

1306
01:19:29,427 --> 01:19:30,471
Whoo!

1307
01:19:37,478 --> 01:19:40,133
You killed Black Tom,
you racist son of a bitch!

1308
01:19:42,919 --> 01:19:44,050
That's unfortunate.

1309
01:19:47,184 --> 01:19:48,576
We got no brakes!

1310
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:49,839
Figure it out!

1311
01:19:54,234 --> 01:19:55,758
There's nothing I can't kill.

1312
01:19:58,586 --> 01:20:01,111
Well, as Scoutmaster Kevin
used to say...

1313
01:20:01,154 --> 01:20:03,504
"There's a first time
for everything, son."

1314
01:20:05,202 --> 01:20:06,769
Give me your best shot,
One-Eyed Willy.

1315
01:20:21,654 --> 01:20:23,569
Those bullets were, like,
super fast.

1316
01:20:24,135 --> 01:20:25,136
Here we go.

1317
01:20:26,224 --> 01:20:28,487
Domino, mind slowing us down?

1318
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:30,663
Here goes nothing.

1319
01:21:01,825 --> 01:21:03,565
Knock, knock.

1320
01:21:10,094 --> 01:21:11,138
That's my boy.

1321
01:21:17,537 --> 01:21:18,756
Holy...

1322
01:21:28,983 --> 01:21:30,637
I'll be first to admit...

1323
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:33,031
this did not go
according to plan.

1324
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:35,947
I'll also be the first
to admit that

1325
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:37,862
that plan was
written in crayon.

1326
01:21:37,905 --> 01:21:41,169
Looks like Russell found
a new friend. Jelly.

1327
01:21:41,213 --> 01:21:42,823
Turns out Domino's
a bit of a badass,

1328
01:21:42,867 --> 01:21:45,783
and maybe,
possibly mildly lucky.

1329
01:21:45,826 --> 01:21:49,090
But Cable? Ugh.
That guy's in a mood.

1330
01:21:49,134 --> 01:21:50,352
A mood that is

1331
01:21:50,396 --> 01:21:52,180
about to get
significantly worse.

1332
01:22:15,944 --> 01:22:18,381
Something is so terribly,
terribly wrong.

1333
01:22:21,341 --> 01:22:22,821
Oh.

1334
01:22:24,605 --> 01:22:26,259
Oh, God, that hurt.

1335
01:22:26,302 --> 01:22:27,913
Suck it, Mel Gibson.

1336
01:22:31,481 --> 01:22:32,569
Russell.

1337
01:22:35,268 --> 01:22:36,356
Russell!

1338
01:22:36,965 --> 01:22:39,054
Russ, where are ya?

1339
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:44,886
Russell. Russell, you're okay!

1340
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:48,368
Oh, thank God.
Oh, my God!

1341
01:22:48,411 --> 01:22:49,760
Juggernaut!

1342
01:22:50,936 --> 01:22:52,981
I thought that was you!

1343
01:22:53,025 --> 01:22:55,854
I should've worn
my white pants.

1344
01:22:55,897 --> 01:22:59,727
You probably get this a lot,
but I am a huge fan.

1345
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:03,078
Uncanny X-Men183. Thor411.

1346
01:23:03,122 --> 01:23:04,471
X-Men Unlimited12.

1347
01:23:04,514 --> 01:23:06,647
You know, it has always been
a dream of mine...

1348
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:08,475
to see my face
reflected in your helmet...

1349
01:23:08,518 --> 01:23:10,738
as you charge at me
with murderous intent.

1350
01:23:10,781 --> 01:23:12,567
I don't mean right now.

1351
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:14,525
I'm gonna rip you
in half now.

1352
01:23:14,569 --> 01:23:16,919
That is such
a Juggernaut thing to say.

1353
01:23:20,967 --> 01:23:25,014
Oh, my God!
I can't feel my legs.

1354
01:23:25,058 --> 01:23:26,146
I can't feel...

1355
01:23:27,103 --> 01:23:28,626
Oh, no, they're right here.

1356
01:23:29,453 --> 01:23:31,238
Got 'em.
God, Russell.

1357
01:23:31,281 --> 01:23:33,631
I have a mission.

1358
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:35,242
To get my revenge.

1359
01:23:35,285 --> 01:23:37,592
I'm going to burn
that headmaster alive.

1360
01:23:37,635 --> 01:23:39,855
You're not the revenge type.

1361
01:23:39,899 --> 01:23:41,422
Take it from a friend.

1362
01:23:41,465 --> 01:23:45,295
Friend? You were sick,
and I protected you.

1363
01:23:45,339 --> 01:23:47,515
You said it yourself.

1364
01:23:47,558 --> 01:23:50,257
"I'm not your friend.
Find someone stronger."

1365
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:51,736
So I did.

1366
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:55,436
Russell, I couldn't
protect you back then.

1367
01:23:55,479 --> 01:23:59,483
But I can now. What do you
want me to say, huh?

1368
01:23:59,527 --> 01:24:01,398
"I care about you"?
'Cause goddamn it,

1369
01:24:01,442 --> 01:24:03,879
I care about you, Russell.

1370
01:24:03,923 --> 01:24:06,012
What's Juggernaut got
that I don't have?

1371
01:24:06,055 --> 01:24:09,754
Don't you say legs!
I know you're gonna say legs!

1372
01:24:09,798 --> 01:24:12,584
Legs! Still hurts to hear out loud!

1373
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:17,720
What is that?
That's not a real rope!

1374
01:24:17,763 --> 01:24:20,070
You get back here, young man!

1375
01:24:21,028 --> 01:24:22,507
Doms!

1376
01:24:22,551 --> 01:24:24,770
Doms, get me
out of here, please.

1377
01:24:24,814 --> 01:24:27,208
Use my arms
as backpack straps.

1378
01:24:29,950 --> 01:24:31,038
I think we may have found

1379
01:24:31,081 --> 01:24:33,257
your cosmic reason
for being here.

1380
01:24:33,301 --> 01:24:35,085
I'm pretty sure
this isn't it.

1381
01:24:35,129 --> 01:24:36,391
X-Force.

1382
01:24:49,926 --> 01:24:51,754
No child is hopeless.

1383
01:24:51,797 --> 01:24:55,279
Don't give up on the boy.
How could he just walk away?

1384
01:24:55,323 --> 01:24:58,021
It was the coldness
in his eyes.

1385
01:24:58,065 --> 01:24:59,631
You should've heard it.

1386
01:25:01,546 --> 01:25:03,853
I guess family
really is an F-word.

1387
01:25:04,767 --> 01:25:06,987
Rub my legs, Mama.

1388
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:08,423
Why would I
rub your legs?

1389
01:25:08,466 --> 01:25:11,383
Please, they hurt.
I have growing pains.

1390
01:25:14,517 --> 01:25:16,171
What in the...

1391
01:25:16,214 --> 01:25:18,956
Why is your hand
so tiny again?

1392
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,827
That's not my hand.

1393
01:25:20,871 --> 01:25:23,221
Oh! Mary,
mother of Joseph!

1394
01:25:23,265 --> 01:25:25,180
That was nice for me.

1395
01:25:25,223 --> 01:25:28,052
Wade! I heard what happened
with the convoy and...

1396
01:25:32,491 --> 01:25:34,798
Why wouldn't you
cover that up?

1397
01:25:34,841 --> 01:25:37,061
A warrior has nothing
to be ashamed of.

1398
01:25:37,105 --> 01:25:39,063
Yeah, but you do.
Look at you.

1399
01:25:39,107 --> 01:25:41,109
You're just
straight shirt-cocking it,

1400
01:25:41,152 --> 01:25:42,632
toddler-style.

1401
01:25:42,675 --> 01:25:44,634
Oh, yeah.
Full Winnie the Pooh.

1402
01:25:44,677 --> 01:25:46,679
The hell's happening?
Describe it.

1403
01:25:46,723 --> 01:25:48,005
I wouldn't ask him to do that,
if I were you.

1404
01:25:48,029 --> 01:25:49,639
It's like, um... Here we go.

1405
01:25:49,682 --> 01:25:50,964
It's like he was
giving birth anally,

1406
01:25:50,988 --> 01:25:52,511
but they quit halfway through.

1407
01:25:52,555 --> 01:25:53,706
They got the legs out,
and they said,

1408
01:25:53,730 --> 01:25:55,079
"You know what, I'm done."

1409
01:25:55,123 --> 01:25:56,385
Happy?

1410
01:25:56,428 --> 01:25:57,536
It's like he's a Muppet
from the waist down.

1411
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:58,735
But this time, you can see

1412
01:25:58,778 --> 01:26:00,215
the Muppet's dick.

1413
01:26:00,258 --> 01:26:01,781
Grover's got a cock
the size of a twig.

1414
01:26:01,825 --> 01:26:03,020
Mr. Weasel, I can
no longer be double-parked.

1415
01:26:03,044 --> 01:26:04,644
I've had three tickets
already.

1416
01:26:06,134 --> 01:26:08,919
No, no, no, DP,
not again!

1417
01:26:08,962 --> 01:26:11,575
This has happened before?

1418
01:26:11,618 --> 01:26:13,118
Jesus! Either vomit or don't.

1419
01:26:13,142 --> 01:26:14,447
The indecision is killing me.

1420
01:26:14,491 --> 01:26:16,362
Why couldn't God
take my hearing?

1421
01:26:17,972 --> 01:26:20,149
Oh. Wow!

1422
01:26:20,192 --> 01:26:21,889
Cool your pits.
They're growing back.

1423
01:26:21,933 --> 01:26:23,891
I'm talking about your face.

1424
01:26:23,935 --> 01:26:25,850
I've never seen you
without your mask before.

1425
01:26:25,893 --> 01:26:28,113
Jesus Christ! Looks like an avocado.

1426
01:26:28,157 --> 01:26:30,072
Your legs, though,
they're cute.

1427
01:26:30,115 --> 01:26:31,899
You wanna borrow
a pair of pants?

1428
01:26:33,466 --> 01:26:35,077
I'm glad everybody dropped by.

1429
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,818
You must be wondering
why I didn't call you here.

1430
01:26:37,862 --> 01:26:39,472
I'll tell you why I'm here.

1431
01:26:39,516 --> 01:26:41,866
"The Time Traveler's Wife's"
husband...

1432
01:26:41,909 --> 01:26:43,148
beat me within
an inch of my life.

1433
01:26:43,172 --> 01:26:44,521
He was torturing me!

1434
01:26:44,564 --> 01:26:47,437
But all I told him was
everything he wanted to know.

1435
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:50,135
So, I'm here
to help us gear up.

1436
01:26:50,179 --> 01:26:51,330
So we can go after him
without me.

1437
01:26:51,354 --> 01:26:52,746
No!

1438
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:54,139
I'm doing this alone.

1439
01:26:54,183 --> 01:26:55,314
The Juggernaut

1440
01:26:55,358 --> 01:26:56,794
will kill you all. Fair enough.

1441
01:26:56,837 --> 01:26:58,728
I just need a couple of
hours to get some legs

1442
01:26:58,752 --> 01:26:59,884
under me. What will you do?

1443
01:26:59,927 --> 01:27:01,253
I don't care
what the kid did to me.

1444
01:27:01,277 --> 01:27:02,626
I ain't letting Cable
get to him,

1445
01:27:02,669 --> 01:27:04,038
even if I have to
teabag him to death.

1446
01:27:04,062 --> 01:27:06,108
It's really just a sip of tea
at this point.

1447
01:27:06,151 --> 01:27:07,935
Zip it, black Black Widow!
I'm flowing.

1448
01:27:07,979 --> 01:27:09,044
The first order
of business is

1449
01:27:09,068 --> 01:27:10,461
to get me in front of Cable...

1450
01:27:10,504 --> 01:27:11,916
so I can pull all the fucking
blood out of his body...

1451
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:14,291
and fashion his bones
into holiday jewelry.

1452
01:27:14,334 --> 01:27:16,162
Then,
I'm gonna take his skin...

1453
01:27:16,206 --> 01:27:19,252
and stretch it out
over a homemade mating drum.

1454
01:27:20,862 --> 01:27:22,462
He's standing right
behind you, isn't he?

1455
01:27:31,134 --> 01:27:33,136
What in the ass?

1456
01:27:33,179 --> 01:27:36,487
Is this apartment listed
on Tinder? Grindr?

1457
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:39,577
You picked the wrong shithole
to fuck, future boy.

1458
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:42,145
Ugh. Is that really necessary?

1459
01:27:44,408 --> 01:27:47,193
No. It's his
"Basic Instinct."

1460
01:27:47,237 --> 01:27:48,977
What can we help you with?

1461
01:27:49,021 --> 01:27:50,675
I'm here to proposition you.

1462
01:27:52,198 --> 01:27:53,286
Oh, boy!

1463
01:27:53,330 --> 01:27:54,394
He's really teeing it up,
isn't he?

1464
01:27:54,418 --> 01:27:56,550
Who gets to make
the first joke?

1465
01:27:56,594 --> 01:27:57,962
I think we should all do it
at the same time.

1466
01:27:57,986 --> 01:27:59,031
Good call.

1467
01:27:59,074 --> 01:28:00,641
For $45, you get sucky-suck.

1468
01:28:00,685 --> 01:28:01,923
I only do over
the pants, mouth stuff.

1469
01:28:01,947 --> 01:28:03,078
Fuck!

1470
01:28:03,122 --> 01:28:04,230
The Proposition
has a wonderful

1471
01:28:04,254 --> 01:28:05,559
Guy Pearce performance.

1472
01:28:05,603 --> 01:28:07,364
Wait, wait, wait!
I wanna do mine over.

1473
01:28:07,388 --> 01:28:09,999
Give us the line again. I need your help!

1474
01:28:10,043 --> 01:28:12,350
Trust me, I'm even less happy
about this than you are...

1475
01:28:12,393 --> 01:28:15,527
but you unleashed
the Juggernaut, you dumb cunt!

1476
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:17,964
I can't bring him down alone.

1477
01:28:18,007 --> 01:28:19,531
So here we are.

1478
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,664
We're no longer
accepting applications

1479
01:28:22,708 --> 01:28:24,144
for X-Force, unfortunately.

1480
01:28:24,188 --> 01:28:25,624
Even if we were...

1481
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:27,341
there's a wind advisory
in effect until at least...

1482
01:28:27,365 --> 01:28:28,627
We don't have a lot of time.

1483
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:30,411
Your friend's about
to make his first kill.

1484
01:28:30,455 --> 01:28:31,978
No offense,
but if you know so much...

1485
01:28:32,021 --> 01:28:34,894
why not travel back to when
he was a baby, kill him then?

1486
01:28:34,937 --> 01:28:36,001
Or better yet, head back
a little further,

1487
01:28:36,025 --> 01:28:37,113
kill baby Hitler.

1488
01:28:37,157 --> 01:28:39,115
I use a device
to slide through time.

1489
01:28:39,159 --> 01:28:41,814
The longer I travel,
the harder it is to control.

1490
01:28:41,857 --> 01:28:44,469
I got two charges:
one to get me here,

1491
01:28:44,512 --> 01:28:45,687
one to get me home.

1492
01:28:45,731 --> 01:28:46,906
Well.

1493
01:28:46,949 --> 01:28:48,864
That's just lazy writing.

1494
01:28:48,908 --> 01:28:50,190
Your boy's
gonna kill the headmaster

1495
01:28:50,214 --> 01:28:51,780
of the orphanage tonight.

1496
01:28:51,824 --> 01:28:53,956
After that,
he gets a real taste for it.

1497
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,742
Like 10-year-old
Kirsten Dunst, motherfucker!

1498
01:28:56,785 --> 01:28:58,787
So he keeps killing...

1499
01:28:58,831 --> 01:29:00,311
and killing, and killing,

1500
01:29:00,354 --> 01:29:01,877
and killing.

1501
01:29:01,921 --> 01:29:05,141
Until one day, he kills
the wrong fucking people.

1502
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:09,103
My people.

1503
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:14,282
Relax.

1504
01:29:14,326 --> 01:29:16,719
I'm retrieving something
from my utility bag.

1505
01:29:16,763 --> 01:29:19,331
It's a goddamn fanny pack...

1506
01:29:19,374 --> 01:29:21,985
and you know it,
you sick son of a bitch!

1507
01:29:22,029 --> 01:29:23,683
The difference
is night and day.

1508
01:29:25,511 --> 01:29:27,774
You remind me of my wife.

1509
01:29:27,817 --> 01:29:29,297
I'm sorry.

1510
01:29:29,341 --> 01:29:30,448
I said, "You remind me
of my wife."

1511
01:29:30,472 --> 01:29:31,832
No, I'm sorry
that you said that...

1512
01:29:31,865 --> 01:29:34,650
while making heavy eye contact
and applying lip balm.

1513
01:29:34,694 --> 01:29:35,869
She always struggled.

1514
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,437
But she was funny...

1515
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:41,831
and filtered her pain
through the prism of humor.

1516
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:44,094
Something I could
never master.

1517
01:29:45,008 --> 01:29:47,228
It was my fault she died.

1518
01:29:48,838 --> 01:29:52,494
It was my job
to stop people like him.

1519
01:29:52,538 --> 01:29:54,496
I came close a few times.

1520
01:29:58,718 --> 01:30:00,372
He wasn't too happy
about that.

1521
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:03,288
He was trying to hurt me...

1522
01:30:03,331 --> 01:30:05,290
and he knew exactly
how to do it.

1523
01:30:09,338 --> 01:30:11,035
Blessed are the wicked

1524
01:30:11,079 --> 01:30:12,646
who are healed by my hand.

1525
01:30:15,779 --> 01:30:18,129
He came into my home...

1526
01:30:18,173 --> 01:30:21,045
and took the only thing
that made it a home.

1527
01:30:25,267 --> 01:30:26,616
Sound familiar?

1528
01:30:27,661 --> 01:30:29,315
I'm sorry.Uh-huh.

1529
01:30:29,358 --> 01:30:31,012
No, I'm really sorry.

1530
01:30:33,231 --> 01:30:35,364
But that isn't Russell.

1531
01:30:35,408 --> 01:30:37,342
It doesn't have to be him.
If you knew what I knew...

1532
01:30:37,366 --> 01:30:39,368
Yeah, he's got anger issues...

1533
01:30:39,412 --> 01:30:40,978
maybe a small
learning disability...

1534
01:30:41,022 --> 01:30:42,415
splash of diabetes...

1535
01:30:42,458 --> 01:30:43,807
but nothing
that can't be fixed.

1536
01:30:43,851 --> 01:30:45,505
If you could go back...

1537
01:30:45,548 --> 01:30:48,246
and stop the people that took
your girl, would you?

1538
01:30:48,508 --> 01:30:49,770
No.

1539
01:30:49,813 --> 01:30:51,554
I'd buy them all
a bouquet of hand jobs.

1540
01:30:51,598 --> 01:30:53,339
Of course I fucking would!

1541
01:30:54,122 --> 01:30:55,253
But I wouldn't kill a kid.

1542
01:30:55,297 --> 01:30:57,343
I'm not asking you
to kill a kid!

1543
01:30:57,386 --> 01:30:58,953
I'll kill the kid.

1544
01:30:58,996 --> 01:31:02,478
I'm asking you to save
hundreds of other kids.

1545
01:31:02,522 --> 01:31:04,873
Russell's gonna burn down
that orphanage.

1546
01:31:04,916 --> 01:31:06,962
And I can imagine
your dead girlfriend...

1547
01:31:07,005 --> 01:31:09,268
would want you to do
the right thing, wouldn't she?

1548
01:31:10,269 --> 01:31:13,447
So, what's it gonna be,
handsome?

1549
01:31:13,490 --> 01:31:15,231
Give me a chance to save him.

1550
01:31:15,274 --> 01:31:16,711
What? You said...

1551
01:31:16,754 --> 01:31:18,428
once he kills someone,
he gets a taste for it.

1552
01:31:18,452 --> 01:31:20,802
If we can get to him
before that happens...

1553
01:31:20,845 --> 01:31:22,499
promise you'll give me
a chance

1554
01:31:22,543 --> 01:31:24,414
to put him
on a different path.

1555
01:31:24,458 --> 01:31:25,633
Define "chance."

1556
01:31:25,676 --> 01:31:26,914
I don't know.
How long does it take

1557
01:31:26,938 --> 01:31:28,307
to save someone's soul?
That's not...

1558
01:31:28,331 --> 01:31:29,593
I'll give you 30 seconds.

1559
01:31:29,637 --> 01:31:31,682
What? No! Best I can do.

1560
01:31:31,726 --> 01:31:33,031
Take it or leave it.

1561
01:31:43,477 --> 01:31:44,956
He's doing it!

1562
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,610
Look at the little fella.
He's doing it.

1563
01:31:46,654 --> 01:31:48,612
There he goes.

1564
01:31:48,656 --> 01:31:50,135
Jesus Christ!

1565
01:31:50,179 --> 01:31:51,659
Just shirt-cocking it.

1566
01:31:51,702 --> 01:31:53,617
Ugh.

1567
01:31:53,661 --> 01:31:55,021
There you go, little fella.

1568
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:57,447
Go on, you're doing it!

1569
01:31:57,491 --> 01:32:00,363
My beautiful, hairless,
Twizzler-legged baby boy.

1570
01:32:02,539 --> 01:32:03,672
Christ!

1571
01:32:03,715 --> 01:32:05,413
That's disturbing.

1572
01:32:05,456 --> 01:32:06,849
30 seconds.

1573
01:32:12,245 --> 01:32:13,725
Deal.Deal.

1574
01:32:20,166 --> 01:32:23,256
Man, that sucks they didn't
have anything in your size.

1575
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:25,302
I really wanted to match,
you know?

1576
01:32:25,345 --> 01:32:27,391
Being a menacing team.

1577
01:32:27,435 --> 01:32:28,610
Oh, man, it sucks.

1578
01:32:28,653 --> 01:32:30,525
That was some
cold-ass shit, kid.

1579
01:32:31,917 --> 01:32:34,485
And that is just
the first five steps

1580
01:32:34,529 --> 01:32:36,226
to a prostate-assisted orgasm.

1581
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:38,576
Where the hell
are we going?

1582
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:39,969
You said it yourself.

1583
01:32:40,012 --> 01:32:42,928
Nothing can stop the
Juggernaut. We need backup.

1584
01:32:42,972 --> 01:32:45,931
I will bathe in the blood
of your enemies.

1585
01:32:50,066 --> 01:32:51,676
Can you turn off the music?

1586
01:32:52,677 --> 01:32:54,810
You'll do no such thing.

1587
01:32:54,853 --> 01:32:56,725
Why don't you just say it
in an Indian accent?

1588
01:32:56,768 --> 01:32:58,509
I'm sorry? Apology accepted.

1589
01:32:58,553 --> 01:33:00,642
This is a side of you
I do not like.

1590
01:33:00,685 --> 01:33:02,034
Let me guess,

1591
01:33:02,078 --> 01:33:03,578
some of your best friends
in the future are Indian.

1592
01:33:03,602 --> 01:33:04,864
What the hell are you...?

1593
01:33:04,908 --> 01:33:06,779
Once again, intolerance rears
its ugly head.

1594
01:33:06,823 --> 01:33:08,128
I am so sorry.
It gets better.

1595
01:33:08,172 --> 01:33:09,739
I'm not a fucking racist,
moron!

1596
01:33:09,782 --> 01:33:11,828
That's precisely
what a racist would say.

1597
01:33:11,871 --> 01:33:13,525
I'm with the old white guy
on this one.

1598
01:33:13,569 --> 01:33:14,831
And that's a twist.

1599
01:33:14,874 --> 01:33:16,397
When this is over...

1600
01:33:16,441 --> 01:33:18,332
I'm going to fuck you to death
with your own broken feet.

1601
01:33:18,356 --> 01:33:20,532
And a sexual predator, too.
That's rich.

1602
01:33:20,576 --> 01:33:21,968
I should have
finished college.

1603
01:33:22,012 --> 01:33:23,163
So what exactly do you

1604
01:33:23,187 --> 01:33:24,251
do in the future, anyway, huh?

1605
01:33:24,275 --> 01:33:25,537
Some kind of soldier?

1606
01:33:25,581 --> 01:33:27,408
Yeah, something like that.

1607
01:33:27,452 --> 01:33:29,628
I was a soldier.
Special Forces.

1608
01:33:29,672 --> 01:33:32,370
I bet 50 years from now,
we're bestest buddies.

1609
01:33:32,413 --> 01:33:34,415
50 years from now,
you're very dead.

1610
01:33:34,459 --> 01:33:36,853
Your entire generation fucked
this planet into a coma.

1611
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:38,507
Boom!

1612
01:33:38,550 --> 01:33:39,812
Spoiler alert.

1613
01:33:41,031 --> 01:33:42,380
Planets.

1614
01:33:42,423 --> 01:33:43,990
Next time, Uber.

1615
01:33:44,034 --> 01:33:45,339
Here's a spoiler alert.

1616
01:33:46,515 --> 01:33:48,473
You're not a fucking hero.

1617
01:33:48,517 --> 01:33:52,564
You're just an annoying clown
dressed up as a sex toy.

1618
01:33:52,608 --> 01:33:53,802
Well, I got news for you.

1619
01:33:53,826 --> 01:33:55,175
My heart
is in the right place.

1620
01:33:55,219 --> 01:33:56,742
Russell's not
gonna kill anyone.

1621
01:33:56,786 --> 01:33:58,764
Because of me, he's gonna know
what real love looks like.

1622
01:33:58,788 --> 01:33:59,876
We're all going to die.

1623
01:33:59,919 --> 01:34:01,181
Because of you,
I'll always know

1624
01:34:01,225 --> 01:34:03,184
what a grown man
with baby balls looks like.

1625
01:34:03,228 --> 01:34:05,622
I'm a grower, not a shower.

1626
01:34:05,665 --> 01:34:06,840
God, I wish this were a bus

1627
01:34:06,884 --> 01:34:08,078
where I could pull
the string and get out.

1628
01:34:08,102 --> 01:34:09,756
It's a good thing
Cable's not driving,

1629
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:11,018
or you'd be in the back.

1630
01:34:11,062 --> 01:34:13,412
- I am in the back.
- Right here!

1631
01:34:31,561 --> 01:34:33,606
I made mistakes!

1632
01:34:33,650 --> 01:34:35,347
I wanna take them back!

1633
01:34:35,390 --> 01:34:38,350
You trusted me.
I took that trust...

1634
01:34:38,393 --> 01:34:39,830
and turned it
into a glory hole

1635
01:34:39,873 --> 01:34:41,440
in an airport bathroom.

1636
01:34:41,483 --> 01:34:44,748
The one in Minneapolis.
You know the one.

1637
01:34:44,791 --> 01:34:47,402
But even you know I'm not
a complete piece of shit.

1638
01:34:47,446 --> 01:34:48,969
I was once an X-Man.

1639
01:34:49,013 --> 01:34:50,057
Trainee!

1640
01:34:54,714 --> 01:34:57,282
You're still using
my Velcro labels. Aw.

1641
01:34:57,325 --> 01:34:58,936
They do stick better
than tape.

1642
01:34:58,979 --> 01:35:00,024
Hi, Wade!

1643
01:35:00,067 --> 01:35:01,504
Please don't.

1644
01:35:01,548 --> 01:35:03,942
Say whatever it is you're here
to say. Make it quick.

1645
01:35:03,985 --> 01:35:05,247
Right. Quick.

1646
01:35:05,291 --> 01:35:07,008
It's the kid.
Just like you, I let him down.

1647
01:35:07,032 --> 01:35:08,468
And just like me,

1648
01:35:08,511 --> 01:35:09,663
he's never had anyone
sacrifice anything for him...

1649
01:35:09,687 --> 01:35:10,707
because the whole world
wrote him off

1650
01:35:10,731 --> 01:35:12,167
as a piece of shit
a long time ago.

1651
01:35:12,211 --> 01:35:13,908
Look, he's teamed up
with the Juggernaut!

1652
01:35:13,952 --> 01:35:15,475
The Juggernaut!

1653
01:35:15,518 --> 01:35:17,279
Who's, like, my favorite
Marvel character ever...

1654
01:35:17,303 --> 01:35:19,522
And hi, Yukio! That was really
nice of you to say hi...

1655
01:35:19,566 --> 01:35:20,915
so I'm saying hi back.

1656
01:35:20,959 --> 01:35:22,351
You guys make
a super cute couple.

1657
01:35:22,395 --> 01:35:24,092
Yeah. Where was I?

1658
01:35:24,136 --> 01:35:26,007
Oh, yeah. You should never
meet your heroes...

1659
01:35:26,051 --> 01:35:27,748
because, honestly,
he's a bit of a dick!

1660
01:35:27,792 --> 01:35:29,632
And like a lot of dicks,
he's hard as a rock...

1661
01:35:29,663 --> 01:35:31,056
and causes nothing
but problems!

1662
01:35:31,099 --> 01:35:33,972
Look, you can stop the
Juggernaut. I know you can.

1663
01:35:34,015 --> 01:35:37,236
Do you know what would happen
to me if I helped you?

1664
01:35:37,279 --> 01:35:39,368
I would be disgraced.

1665
01:35:39,412 --> 01:35:41,457
You are a criminal,
a fugitive.

1666
01:35:41,501 --> 01:35:43,024
But worst of all...

1667
01:35:43,068 --> 01:35:44,809
you broke my heart, Wade.

1668
01:35:46,506 --> 01:35:47,725
Then you know what?

1669
01:35:47,768 --> 01:35:49,368
Your heart's in
the wrong place, big guy.

1670
01:35:50,423 --> 01:35:53,121
Doing the right thing
is sometimes messy...

1671
01:35:53,165 --> 01:35:56,559
and fucked up, and not
particularly convenient!

1672
01:35:56,603 --> 01:35:59,693
So stay here
in Chateau de Virgin...

1673
01:35:59,737 --> 01:36:01,870
while we go get our fuck on!

1674
01:36:05,047 --> 01:36:06,440
You're doing great.

1675
01:36:12,098 --> 01:36:13,641
So you wear
that helmet because

1676
01:36:13,665 --> 01:36:15,405
your brother
tries to read your mind?

1677
01:36:15,449 --> 01:36:18,713
Yeah, but he's in
a wheelchair, so even-steven.

1678
01:36:18,757 --> 01:36:21,237
Someone's coming.
It's Russell, sir.

1679
01:36:21,281 --> 01:36:23,239
And he's not alone.

1680
01:36:23,283 --> 01:36:24,937
Secure the children.

1681
01:36:27,374 --> 01:36:30,116
They will not replace us.

1682
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:32,945
What do you say
we go fuck some shit up?

1683
01:36:32,988 --> 01:36:36,818
"Let's fuck some shit up"
is my legal middle name.

1684
01:36:40,169 --> 01:36:42,781
Watch my back.
I've got the old man.

1685
01:36:42,824 --> 01:36:44,391
Amen, brother.

1686
01:36:50,919 --> 01:36:52,573
Time to make the chimichangas.

1687
01:36:52,616 --> 01:36:54,793
30 seconds.

1688
01:36:54,836 --> 01:36:57,360
I finally know why I'm here.

1689
01:36:57,404 --> 01:36:59,363
I was raised in this place.

1690
01:36:59,407 --> 01:37:01,670
Well, not raised.
I was tortured.

1691
01:37:01,714 --> 01:37:04,586
Wow! It's your cosmic reason
for being here.

1692
01:37:04,629 --> 01:37:05,935
Shall we? This is gonna be fun.

1693
01:37:05,979 --> 01:37:07,067
Yeah!

1694
01:37:07,110 --> 01:37:08,503
Hey! Been meaning
to ask you...

1695
01:37:08,546 --> 01:37:11,811
what's with the dirty,
disgusting hobo bear?

1696
01:37:11,854 --> 01:37:15,031
It's not dirt. It's the blood
of my dead daughter.

1697
01:37:15,075 --> 01:37:17,773
Are You Bear, God?
It's Me, Margaret.

1698
01:37:17,817 --> 01:37:19,253
Give me some.

1699
01:37:19,296 --> 01:37:20,863
They say
laughter heals anything...

1700
01:37:20,907 --> 01:37:22,038
except, of course, that.

1701
01:37:22,082 --> 01:37:23,300
We should just cue the music.

1702
01:37:48,456 --> 01:37:51,154
Welcome home, Russell.
We missed you.

1703
01:37:52,373 --> 01:37:53,417
Russell!

1704
01:37:53,461 --> 01:37:56,856
You don't need to do this!
Let's talk!

1705
01:37:56,899 --> 01:37:58,420
Why are you dressed
like the Unabomber?

1706
01:38:02,558 --> 01:38:03,820
That's why!

1707
01:38:03,864 --> 01:38:05,189
Told you this little fucker's
too far gone.

1708
01:38:05,213 --> 01:38:06,930
Zip it, Thanos!
We have a deal and you fuck...

1709
01:38:06,954 --> 01:38:09,434
Hey!

1710
01:38:09,478 --> 01:38:12,611
I'm gonna shove that
cab driver right up your ass.

1711
01:38:13,743 --> 01:38:15,919
My body and my hands
are so soft.

1712
01:38:15,963 --> 01:38:17,201
You should probably
head back to the car.

1713
01:38:17,225 --> 01:38:18,922
I think I'll head
back to the car.

1714
01:38:20,097 --> 01:38:22,796
It works best
when you pull the trigger.

1715
01:38:25,711 --> 01:38:26,974
That gun is amazing!

1716
01:38:28,323 --> 01:38:29,541
Say it!

1717
01:38:31,717 --> 01:38:34,764
You are an abomination!

1718
01:38:42,032 --> 01:38:45,340
Now, I'm gonna shove
the red guy up the old guy.

1719
01:38:45,383 --> 01:38:47,821
I believe him!
Every man for themselves!

1720
01:38:52,173 --> 01:38:53,261
Gotcha!

1721
01:38:54,044 --> 01:38:55,219
Beat it, midget!

1722
01:38:58,223 --> 01:39:01,313
Hey, big guy,
the sun's getting real low!

1723
01:39:01,357 --> 01:39:02,445
Oh, shit fuck!

1724
01:39:16,328 --> 01:39:17,895
Come here, beautiful.

1725
01:39:25,685 --> 01:39:26,817
Whoo!

1726
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,088
Say it!

1727
01:41:00,565 --> 01:41:01,696
You came for me.

1728
01:41:01,740 --> 01:41:03,176
I'm not giving up on you,

1729
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:05,352
and you are not
giving up on that boy.

1730
01:41:05,396 --> 01:41:07,441
Who says that rules
aren't meant to be broken?

1731
01:41:07,485 --> 01:41:09,878
It's time to fight dirty.

1732
01:41:09,922 --> 01:41:11,271
Time to sweep the leg, Johnny.

1733
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:14,100
Hey! Pick on someone
your own size!

1734
01:41:14,144 --> 01:41:16,233
That's such
a you thing to say!

1735
01:41:16,276 --> 01:41:18,235
Go get him, tiger!

1736
01:41:18,278 --> 01:41:20,150
Big CGI fight coming up!

1737
01:41:43,216 --> 01:41:44,609
He's doing great.

1738
01:41:44,652 --> 01:41:45,871
Say it!

1739
01:41:50,049 --> 01:41:51,442
- Russell.
- Bingo!

1740
01:41:56,839 --> 01:41:58,841
You see that bus?

1741
01:41:58,885 --> 01:42:00,085
I'm gonna
shove it up your ass.

1742
01:42:03,455 --> 01:42:05,413
That's right!
I'm fighting dirty!

1743
01:42:06,327 --> 01:42:07,372
Oh, great!

1744
01:42:07,415 --> 01:42:08,827
There they are!
Those freaks!

1745
01:42:08,851 --> 01:42:10,960
A bunch of armed
pedophiles in nursing shoes.

1746
01:42:10,984 --> 01:42:13,117
Can I have
one of those guns?

1747
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:14,988
No.That's fine.

1748
01:42:15,032 --> 01:42:16,990
Get off this property,
mutant scum!

1749
01:42:17,034 --> 01:42:18,194
I'm just gonna
use this brick.

1750
01:42:18,774 --> 01:42:19,862
Maximum effort.

1751
01:42:25,912 --> 01:42:27,653
Who says you
can't go home again?

1752
01:42:36,749 --> 01:42:38,142
Oh!

1753
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:45,801
Yeah!

1754
01:42:48,021 --> 01:42:49,675
Say it.

1755
01:42:49,718 --> 01:42:52,765
Say what you said
every time you tortured me!

1756
01:42:53,287 --> 01:42:54,637
Say it!

1757
01:42:54,681 --> 01:42:57,379
Blessed are the wicked
who are healed by my hand!

1758
01:42:58,598 --> 01:43:00,730
Blessed are the wicked...

1759
01:43:00,774 --> 01:43:01,992
who are healed...

1760
01:43:02,471 --> 01:43:03,994
by my hand.

1761
01:43:22,056 --> 01:43:23,753
You commie motherfucker!

1762
01:43:50,824 --> 01:43:53,349
Oh, my God.
Did you feel that, too?

1763
01:43:53,393 --> 01:43:55,612
Only best buddies
execute pedophiles together.

1764
01:43:58,485 --> 01:44:00,835
You got 30 seconds,
you jabbering butt plug!

1765
01:44:00,878 --> 01:44:02,097
Now we're getting it.

1766
01:44:06,797 --> 01:44:09,060
I need a bus
to get you all out of here.

1767
01:44:14,327 --> 01:44:15,371
Orphans.

1768
01:44:16,546 --> 01:44:17,765
Oh, geez.

1769
01:44:19,201 --> 01:44:21,899
It's time to burn
for what you've done!

1770
01:44:21,943 --> 01:44:24,424
A child should not be burdened
with such power!

1771
01:44:33,259 --> 01:44:34,303
Russell! Wait!

1772
01:44:40,309 --> 01:44:41,615
Oh!

1773
01:44:48,839 --> 01:44:50,972
Wait! He hasn't killed
anyone yet!

1774
01:44:51,015 --> 01:44:53,038
What more do you need to see?
Don't you fucking dare!

1775
01:44:53,062 --> 01:44:54,237
He's just a kid!

1776
01:44:54,281 --> 01:44:56,196
Tick, tock. Meter's running!

1777
01:45:08,904 --> 01:45:11,950
I'm gonna melt you down
and make a cock ring.

1778
01:45:32,319 --> 01:45:34,973
I told you! Leave me alone! Come on!

1779
01:45:35,496 --> 01:45:36,627
Listen to me!

1780
01:45:59,869 --> 01:46:01,523
That's how we do it

1781
01:46:01,566 --> 01:46:03,046
in Mother Russia.

1782
01:46:05,266 --> 01:46:07,790
They say millennials are
the hardest to reach.

1783
01:46:09,182 --> 01:46:12,403
Oh, no.
You're doing amazing.

1784
01:46:13,709 --> 01:46:16,581
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta!

1785
01:46:16,625 --> 01:46:18,453
Go home, Wade!

1786
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:20,324
You're ruining everything!

1787
01:46:25,677 --> 01:46:27,026
I'm getting good at this shit.

1788
01:46:27,070 --> 01:46:28,376
Go, go, go!

1789
01:46:31,596 --> 01:46:33,555
He dies tonight, Wade.

1790
01:46:33,598 --> 01:46:36,079
You can't stop me!

1791
01:46:36,122 --> 01:46:37,994
He even runs
like a fucking pervert.

1792
01:46:38,037 --> 01:46:40,779
Like an online predator
who lost his laptop.

1793
01:46:42,215 --> 01:46:43,695
There's one bullet left
in that gun.

1794
01:46:43,739 --> 01:46:45,741
Wait, wait, wait!
Please, just give me a second!

1795
01:46:45,784 --> 01:46:47,264
I got this.

1796
01:46:47,308 --> 01:46:49,527
Russell! Stay back! Go home, Wade!

1797
01:46:49,571 --> 01:46:52,270
Let's talk. It doesn't
have to go this way!

1798
01:46:52,314 --> 01:46:53,967
That piece of shit...

1799
01:46:54,011 --> 01:46:55,752
he deserves to die
for what he did to you.

1800
01:46:55,795 --> 01:46:59,190
He hurt you badly.
Makes you wanna hurt others.

1801
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:01,845
But if you kill him, he wins.

1802
01:47:01,888 --> 01:47:05,762
You become everything
he says you are, but worse.

1803
01:47:05,805 --> 01:47:07,807
You're just a kid.

1804
01:47:07,851 --> 01:47:09,592
You don't wanna hurt anyone.

1805
01:47:09,635 --> 01:47:10,897
How do you know what I want?

1806
01:47:10,941 --> 01:47:12,551
Because I've been inside you.

1807
01:47:13,247 --> 01:47:15,119
That came out wrong.

1808
01:47:15,162 --> 01:47:16,860
I've been inside your shoes.

1809
01:47:16,903 --> 01:47:18,775
Which is also off-putting.

1810
01:47:18,818 --> 01:47:20,298
It's not a great analogy.

1811
01:47:20,342 --> 01:47:22,169
The point is...

1812
01:47:22,213 --> 01:47:23,910
there are people...

1813
01:47:23,954 --> 01:47:27,000
There are people
in this fucking world...

1814
01:47:27,044 --> 01:47:29,742
besides him,
who will treat you right.

1815
01:47:29,786 --> 01:47:32,397
It isn't too late.
Don't do it.

1816
01:47:37,968 --> 01:47:40,362
I never should've left
you there.

1817
01:47:42,102 --> 01:47:43,974
I never should've left you
in that prison.

1818
01:47:51,069 --> 01:47:52,375
I can't trust you.

1819
01:47:54,072 --> 01:47:56,422
I can't trust anybody!

1820
01:48:05,649 --> 01:48:06,911
Wonderful kid.

1821
01:48:06,954 --> 01:48:08,739
You can't stop me, Wade!

1822
01:48:10,958 --> 01:48:13,221
I got one more idea.

1823
01:48:13,265 --> 01:48:16,181
It's just a really bad one,
even for me.

1824
01:48:16,224 --> 01:48:17,487
Wade, what are you doing?

1825
01:48:17,530 --> 01:48:19,837
All right. This is for
all the marbles, kid!

1826
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:21,969
You're gonna kill
someone today...

1827
01:48:22,013 --> 01:48:23,449
Blessed are the wicked...

1828
01:48:23,493 --> 01:48:25,408
...then it's gotta be me.

1829
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:28,411
...who are healed by my hand!

1830
01:48:31,501 --> 01:48:33,938
Fuck this!

1831
01:49:34,652 --> 01:49:37,611
Tell me they got that
in slow motion.

1832
01:49:42,616 --> 01:49:44,139
Oh, that's not good.

1833
01:49:45,706 --> 01:49:47,143
No, sir.

1834
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:57,676
You sacrificed yourself
for me.

1835
01:49:58,111 --> 01:49:59,286
Yeah.

1836
01:49:59,329 --> 01:50:01,549
And it was the best thing
I ever did.

1837
01:50:03,508 --> 01:50:05,597
I told you
I care about you.

1838
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:07,424
You're a good kid, Russell.

1839
01:50:09,122 --> 01:50:10,210
Hey.

1840
01:50:11,516 --> 01:50:12,734
The bear.

1841
01:50:12,778 --> 01:50:14,170
It worked.

1842
01:50:21,134 --> 01:50:22,744
Because of you.

1843
01:50:22,788 --> 01:50:25,094
No, Wade, because of you.

1844
01:50:25,965 --> 01:50:28,054
Stop, stop, stop!

1845
01:50:28,097 --> 01:50:29,272
Stop!

1846
01:50:30,447 --> 01:50:33,407
Just let it happen, okay?

1847
01:50:33,450 --> 01:50:37,150
I guess my heart was finally
in the right place.

1848
01:50:37,193 --> 01:50:39,587
That riddle
is so fucked up.

1849
01:50:44,418 --> 01:50:46,813
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1850
01:50:46,856 --> 01:50:48,205
Don't be. Don't be.

1851
01:50:48,249 --> 01:50:50,468
I've been trying to make
this happen for a while.

1852
01:50:50,512 --> 01:50:52,166
Please, just don't leave me.

1853
01:50:52,209 --> 01:50:53,820
I don't wanna die
without an audience.

1854
01:50:53,863 --> 01:50:55,517
We are not going anywhere.

1855
01:50:55,561 --> 01:50:57,650
Oh, God, I hope
the Academy is watching.

1856
01:50:57,693 --> 01:50:58,825
Just rest, okay?

1857
01:51:00,653 --> 01:51:01,741
Papa.

1858
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:05,919
♪ Papa, can you hear me? ♪

1859
01:51:08,182 --> 01:51:14,188
♪ Papa, can you find me
in the night? ♪

1860
01:51:35,470 --> 01:51:37,211
Before I go...

1861
01:51:37,254 --> 01:51:38,952
Sorry, I got a bit more in me.

1862
01:51:39,561 --> 01:51:40,910
Domino.

1863
01:51:40,954 --> 01:51:45,394
I want you to have
my Adventure Timewatch.

1864
01:51:47,918 --> 01:51:50,791
Turns out
that I'm the lucky one.

1865
01:51:51,574 --> 01:51:52,662
Thank you.

1866
01:51:54,011 --> 01:51:57,275
Hey, Sabrina,
the Teenage Witch.

1867
01:51:57,319 --> 01:51:59,626
I liked you better
with your hair short.

1868
01:51:59,669 --> 01:52:00,801
Think everyone did.

1869
01:52:01,628 --> 01:52:04,369
Hi, Yukio. Hi, Wade!

1870
01:52:06,371 --> 01:52:07,459
And you...

1871
01:52:07,982 --> 01:52:09,984
Chrome Bone.

1872
01:52:10,027 --> 01:52:12,943
I haven't always been
the best friend to you.

1873
01:52:12,987 --> 01:52:15,293
But you've always been
that to me.

1874
01:52:15,337 --> 01:52:16,686
So thank you.

1875
01:52:18,862 --> 01:52:20,472
Say "fuck" for me.

1876
01:52:21,299 --> 01:52:22,605
Just once. Come on,

1877
01:52:22,649 --> 01:52:24,259
we'll do it together.
It's no big deal.

1878
01:52:24,302 --> 01:52:27,349
Here we go. One, two, three.
F... F... F...

1879
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:28,567
Fuck.

1880
01:52:28,611 --> 01:52:31,875
Wow! Enjoy hell, swamp mouth.

1881
01:52:33,224 --> 01:52:36,314
And you, Cable.

1882
01:52:36,358 --> 01:52:40,841
You get back to your family.
You tell 'em Wade says hi.

1883
01:52:40,884 --> 01:52:44,541
And promise me.
Promise me one thing.

1884
01:52:44,584 --> 01:52:45,977
That you'll start
judging people...

1885
01:52:46,021 --> 01:52:47,413
not by the color
of their skin,

1886
01:52:47,457 --> 01:52:49,328
but by the content
of their character.

1887
01:52:50,068 --> 01:52:51,679
- Jesus.
- R-Dog?

1888
01:52:52,854 --> 01:52:55,334
There you are. Hey!

1889
01:52:55,378 --> 01:52:57,597
You're a superhero now, bubba.

1890
01:52:57,641 --> 01:53:00,644
That's why it's high time
that you had a super suit.

1891
01:53:00,688 --> 01:53:02,080
This one is yours.

1892
01:53:02,124 --> 01:53:03,865
You might wanna
get it steam cleaned.

1893
01:53:03,908 --> 01:53:05,344
Especially around the pants.

1894
01:53:05,388 --> 01:53:07,085
And let it out
a little in the waist.

1895
01:53:08,043 --> 01:53:09,044
But, hey.

1896
01:53:10,088 --> 01:53:11,437
Look.

1897
01:53:11,481 --> 01:53:14,092
Family is not an F-word.

1898
01:53:14,832 --> 01:53:16,181
All right?

1899
01:53:16,225 --> 01:53:18,662
There's one out there
for you.

1900
01:53:18,706 --> 01:53:20,403
Just keep looking, okay?

1901
01:53:23,885 --> 01:53:26,670
Guys, for a second there...

1902
01:53:27,497 --> 01:53:29,629
we made a pretty good team.

1903
01:53:44,689 --> 01:53:46,691
Oh, it's so hard to go.

1904
01:53:48,258 --> 01:53:50,564
I just love being around
you guys so much.

1905
01:53:51,652 --> 01:53:52,871
So, so much.

1906
01:53:53,611 --> 01:53:54,960
Mmm.

1907
01:53:55,004 --> 01:53:57,833
No, I can feel it now.
Here it comes, yeah.

1908
01:53:57,876 --> 01:54:01,706
I feel the soul
exiting the husk.

1909
01:54:01,750 --> 01:54:02,751
Yeah.

1910
01:54:04,622 --> 01:54:07,103
Can you see it?

1911
01:54:07,146 --> 01:54:09,322
Do you see
that beautiful bright light?

1912
01:54:10,802 --> 01:54:11,934
There it is.

1913
01:54:18,201 --> 01:54:19,463
Oh, that's the sun.

1914
01:54:19,506 --> 01:54:21,378
Don't stare
directly into that.

1915
01:54:21,421 --> 01:54:22,858
I just have a few final words.

1916
01:54:25,077 --> 01:54:26,470
Woodpecker.

1917
01:54:27,253 --> 01:54:28,602
Gingivitis.

1918
01:54:30,648 --> 01:54:31,997
Codswallop.

1919
01:54:36,349 --> 01:54:38,308
Do You Want to
Build a Snowman?

1920
01:55:53,298 --> 01:55:54,516
Sorry I'm late.

1921
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:56,257
There was a bunch

1922
01:55:56,301 --> 01:55:57,669
of handicapable children
who were stuck in a tree.

1923
01:55:57,693 --> 01:55:59,913
No.No.

1924
01:55:59,957 --> 01:56:03,047
But I did have to help a kid.Yeah.

1925
01:56:03,090 --> 01:56:05,005
He's got a terrible name. It's just awful.

1926
01:56:05,049 --> 01:56:06,050
Ugh. I tried to tell him.

1927
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:09,836
Is this heaven?

1928
01:56:10,706 --> 01:56:11,882
It is now.

1929
01:56:15,363 --> 01:56:17,235
I am so sorry.

1930
01:56:18,062 --> 01:56:19,411
It's okay.

1931
01:56:39,257 --> 01:56:41,129
I missed you so much.

1932
01:56:46,743 --> 01:56:48,397
What is it? What's wrong?

1933
01:56:50,312 --> 01:56:52,401
It's not time.

1934
01:56:52,445 --> 01:56:54,447
What do you mean
it's not time?

1935
01:56:54,490 --> 01:56:56,101
I'm here, I made it.

1936
01:56:56,144 --> 01:56:57,885
You can't stay. No, no, no.

1937
01:56:57,929 --> 01:57:00,583
I'm staying. I'm not going
anywhere without you.

1938
01:57:00,627 --> 01:57:02,063
It's okay.

1939
01:57:02,107 --> 01:57:04,936
There's a time for us.
It's just not now.

1940
01:57:05,980 --> 01:57:08,417
They need you. Who?

1941
01:57:10,463 --> 01:57:11,768
Your F-word.

1942
01:57:13,031 --> 01:57:14,032
Why?

1943
01:57:14,075 --> 01:57:15,076
You'll find out.

1944
01:57:16,338 --> 01:57:17,905
It's all right. I'll be here.

1945
01:57:19,254 --> 01:57:22,040
It's pretty fucking
awesome over here.

1946
01:57:22,083 --> 01:57:23,998
I can have anything I want.

1947
01:57:24,042 --> 01:57:26,174
Can every day be
International Women's Day?

1948
01:57:26,218 --> 01:57:27,784
It is heaven.

1949
01:57:27,828 --> 01:57:29,047
I love you.

1950
01:57:31,571 --> 01:57:34,313
I know. I love you, too.

1951
01:57:34,922 --> 01:57:36,315
Now, go.

1952
01:57:37,185 --> 01:57:39,187
Go on. Go, get out of here.

1953
01:57:40,233 --> 01:57:41,234
Go.

1954
01:57:44,063 --> 01:57:45,063
Hey!

1955
01:57:48,067 --> 01:57:50,199
Kiss me
like you miss me, Red.

1956
01:57:50,852 --> 01:57:51,984
Well, come here.

1957
01:58:11,307 --> 01:58:13,048
Don't fuck Elvis.

1958
01:58:13,092 --> 01:58:14,832
Ooh, too late. I'm sorry?

1959
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:25,582
Time to make the chimichangas.

1960
01:58:25,626 --> 01:58:26,757
30 seconds.

1961
01:58:26,801 --> 01:58:28,063
Hey. Been meaning
to ask you...

1962
01:58:28,107 --> 01:58:30,587
what's with the creepy,
dirty hobo bear?

1963
01:58:30,631 --> 01:58:32,807
It's my daughter's teddy bear.

1964
01:58:32,850 --> 01:58:34,374
Her name's Hope.

1965
01:58:34,417 --> 01:58:35,549
Well...

1966
01:58:36,376 --> 01:58:38,291
What are you doing?

1967
01:58:38,334 --> 01:58:39,989
Somebody swiped right.

1968
01:58:52,741 --> 01:58:55,526
Tell me they got that
in slow motion.

1969
01:58:58,442 --> 01:59:00,227
You sacrificed
yourself for me.

1970
01:59:00,270 --> 01:59:01,793
It would seem I...

1971
01:59:03,969 --> 01:59:05,232
Huh?

1972
01:59:06,363 --> 01:59:08,713
Genuine, high-grade lead.

1973
01:59:10,628 --> 01:59:13,675
You time-sliding
son of a bitch!

1974
01:59:13,718 --> 01:59:15,285
You did this for me?

1975
01:59:17,157 --> 01:59:20,247
Wait. You can't go back.

1976
01:59:20,290 --> 01:59:21,596
You used
the last of your fuel.

1977
01:59:21,639 --> 01:59:23,380
What about your girl,
your wife?

1978
01:59:23,424 --> 01:59:26,688
Now, my family's safe.
And I didn't do it for you.

1979
01:59:28,168 --> 01:59:30,605
No, I'm gonna stick around
for a while...

1980
01:59:30,648 --> 01:59:31,910
and make sure the world

1981
01:59:31,954 --> 01:59:33,651
doesn't shit itself
into oblivion.

1982
01:59:34,348 --> 01:59:37,220
No. You did it for me.

1983
01:59:38,004 --> 01:59:39,441
No, I didn't.

1984
01:59:39,484 --> 01:59:40,920
You did. I really didn't.

1985
01:59:40,964 --> 01:59:42,804
Pretty sure you did.
No, I'm positive I didn't.

1986
01:59:42,835 --> 01:59:44,620
Fine. All right,
let's flip a coin. Okay?

1987
01:59:44,663 --> 01:59:47,405
Heads, you did it for me.
Tails, you did it for me.

1988
01:59:47,449 --> 01:59:50,234
I'm not even gonna look,
because you did it for me.

1989
01:59:50,278 --> 01:59:51,409
Say it again.

1990
01:59:51,453 --> 01:59:53,063
- He did it for me.
- Jesus.

1991
01:59:53,107 --> 01:59:54,910
We must get the collar off.
Forget it. It's no use.

1992
01:59:54,934 --> 01:59:56,849
These collars
don't just come off.

1993
01:59:56,893 --> 01:59:58,373
Wade.

1994
01:59:58,416 --> 02:00:00,331
I have an idea.

1995
02:00:00,375 --> 02:00:02,507
No, no, no!
Let's not do that. Please!

1996
02:00:02,551 --> 02:00:04,988
I'd rather die of cancer.
Let's just...

1997
02:00:05,031 --> 02:00:08,165
Oh, God! They do say the pen
is grosser than the sword.

1998
02:00:08,209 --> 02:00:10,515
We need the code.

1999
02:00:10,559 --> 02:00:12,474
Try, uh, seven?

2000
02:00:12,517 --> 02:00:14,128
Settle down,
Captain Lucky.

2001
02:00:14,171 --> 02:00:15,607
It's not gonna be one number.

2002
02:00:15,651 --> 02:00:16,811
Oh, God, that's lazy writing.

2003
02:00:17,740 --> 02:00:19,089
I still got it.

2004
02:00:22,136 --> 02:00:24,094
Put that back
in your prison wallet.

2005
02:00:25,791 --> 02:00:27,706
I don't know how to thank you.

2006
02:00:27,750 --> 02:00:29,665
But I do know how to hug you.

2007
02:00:29,708 --> 02:00:31,014
- No.
- Yes.

2008
02:00:31,057 --> 02:00:32,537
Here we go. Bring it in.

2009
02:00:32,581 --> 02:00:33,669
Come on.

2010
02:00:33,712 --> 02:00:35,149
Pelvis to pelvis.

2011
02:00:35,192 --> 02:00:36,541
Let's go tip to tip.

2012
02:00:36,585 --> 02:00:39,154
There we go.
The kids call this docking.

2013
02:00:40,851 --> 02:00:42,418
Is there a knife in my dick?

2014
02:00:42,461 --> 02:00:44,265
There's a knife in your dick.
I'm just gonna back up now.

2015
02:00:44,289 --> 02:00:46,204
Yeah, yeah. No need to go full Yentl.

2016
02:00:46,248 --> 02:00:49,033
Gonna pretend
like that never happened.

2017
02:00:49,076 --> 02:00:50,991
Let's go home, Russell.

2018
02:00:54,647 --> 02:00:56,432
All you dirty mutants

2019
02:00:56,475 --> 02:00:59,043
are gonna rot in hell
with the boy!

2020
02:00:59,086 --> 02:01:02,177
Your souls
are beyond redemption!

2021
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:03,482
Let's see your soul, perv!

2022
02:01:03,526 --> 02:01:06,355
No, no! No! No more!
We're better than that!

2023
02:01:06,398 --> 02:01:07,704
We're better than him!

2024
02:01:07,747 --> 02:01:10,359
No more senseless violence!
No more bloodshed!

2025
02:01:10,402 --> 02:01:12,012
We'll let karma
take care of him.

2026
02:01:12,056 --> 02:01:15,059
The day of reckoning is here!

2027
02:01:24,373 --> 02:01:26,462
I'm gonna miss him.
He seemed great.

2028
02:01:26,505 --> 02:01:27,724
Whoo!

2029
02:01:27,767 --> 02:01:29,378
Courage, motherfuckers!

2030
02:01:29,421 --> 02:01:30,901
And karma, motherfucker.

2031
02:01:30,944 --> 02:01:32,357
I could hear you
coming the last 30 seconds.

2032
02:01:32,381 --> 02:01:34,383
I could barely keep
a straight face.

2033
02:01:34,426 --> 02:01:36,342
I want some more.

2034
02:01:36,386 --> 02:01:38,126
I bet you do, Brown Panther.

2035
02:01:38,170 --> 02:01:41,695
We should leave
before Fuckernaut wakes up.

2036
02:01:41,739 --> 02:01:44,002
Good call.
You guys coming with us?

2037
02:01:44,045 --> 02:01:46,004
No, we'll get the kids
back to the mansion.

2038
02:01:46,047 --> 02:01:47,571
Besides, we're X-Men.

2039
02:01:47,614 --> 02:01:50,269
No, you're X-People.

2040
02:01:50,313 --> 02:01:51,662
You're exhausting.

2041
02:01:51,705 --> 02:01:53,490
I see what you did there.
Puns.

2042
02:01:53,533 --> 02:01:54,969
Our door's always open.

2043
02:01:55,013 --> 02:01:56,797
That's kind, but
I'm not ready to date again.

2044
02:01:56,841 --> 02:01:57,842
Let alone two women.

2045
02:01:58,973 --> 02:02:00,671
God, you're a douche.

2046
02:02:00,714 --> 02:02:02,847
Bye, Wade! Bye, Yukio!

2047
02:02:05,545 --> 02:02:06,851
What do you get

2048
02:02:06,894 --> 02:02:07,808
when you take
eight feet of chrome...

2049
02:02:07,852 --> 02:02:09,027
one pinch of courage...

2050
02:02:09,070 --> 02:02:10,289
a cup of good luck...

2051
02:02:10,333 --> 02:02:11,899
a dab of racism...

2052
02:02:11,943 --> 02:02:13,466
a splash of diabetes...

2053
02:02:13,510 --> 02:02:15,903
and a wheelbarrow
full of stage four cancer?

2054
02:02:15,947 --> 02:02:18,645
Answer: a family.

2055
02:02:18,689 --> 02:02:21,822
See? I didn't lie
what kind of film this was.

2056
02:02:21,866 --> 02:02:23,409
If there's anything
you take away today...

2057
02:02:23,433 --> 02:02:26,392
other than the need to Google,
"What the fuck is dubstep?"...

2058
02:02:26,436 --> 02:02:29,265
it's that we all need
to belong to someone.

2059
02:04:26,340 --> 02:04:28,081
How something
so small generates

2060
02:04:28,124 --> 02:04:29,691
enough energy
to reverse time is...

2061
02:04:29,735 --> 02:04:32,128
Oh, just fix it, Eleven,

2062
02:04:32,172 --> 02:04:34,436
or I'll take it
to the Genius Bar.

2063
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:35,718
Cable's gonna kill you
when he finds out.

2064
02:04:35,742 --> 02:04:36,786
Never heard of him.

2065
02:04:36,830 --> 02:04:38,309
Why do you think
I'm helping him?

2066
02:04:39,572 --> 02:04:41,835
The Lord works
in mysterious ways,

2067
02:04:41,878 --> 02:04:44,141
don't I? A good day.

2068
02:04:44,881 --> 02:04:45,882
Bye, Wade!

2069
02:04:46,405 --> 02:04:47,406
Bye, Yukio!

2070
02:04:48,711 --> 02:04:51,235
That was probably a bad idea.

2071
02:04:51,279 --> 02:04:52,280
What have we done?

2072
02:05:10,820 --> 02:05:12,866
I hope we sharpened
the cream cheese spreader.

2073
02:05:23,006 --> 02:05:24,443
I'll be right back!

2074
02:05:26,445 --> 02:05:28,969
We're definitely naming
our kid Cher!

2075
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:30,361
Whoo!

2076
02:05:32,190 --> 02:05:33,496
Peter!

2077
02:05:33,540 --> 02:05:35,106
Whoo! X-Force!

2078
02:05:35,150 --> 02:05:38,196
Walk away! Just walk away!

2079
02:05:38,240 --> 02:05:40,242
But we're X-Force! Nope! We're not.

2080
02:05:40,285 --> 02:05:41,635
X-Force is just
a marketing tool

2081
02:05:41,678 --> 02:05:42,984
designed by Fox executives...

2082
02:05:43,027 --> 02:05:44,725
to keep Josh Brolin employed.

2083
02:05:44,768 --> 02:05:46,291
It doesn't exist.

2084
02:05:46,335 --> 02:05:49,643
All right, well,
this has been pretty scary!

2085
02:05:49,686 --> 02:05:51,383
And I need to feed my cat!

2086
02:05:51,427 --> 02:05:53,908
Go home, Sugarbear. Go home.

2087
02:05:53,951 --> 02:05:57,215
Okay. Will you give
Domino my email?

2088
02:06:06,398 --> 02:06:08,270
Wade, is that you?

2089
02:06:10,533 --> 02:06:11,882
I guess Stryker finally

2090
02:06:11,926 --> 02:06:13,318
figured out
how to shut you up.

2091
02:06:19,890 --> 02:06:23,285
Hey! It's me!
Don't scratch!

2092
02:06:23,328 --> 02:06:25,374
Just cleaning up
the timelines!

2093
02:06:25,417 --> 02:06:29,247
Look, eventually you're
going to hang up the claws...

2094
02:06:29,291 --> 02:06:31,512
and it's gonna make
a lot of people very sad.

2095
02:06:31,903 --> 02:06:33,296
Huh?

2096
02:06:33,339 --> 02:06:34,665
But one day, your old pal
Wade's gonna ask you...

2097
02:06:34,689 --> 02:06:36,647
to get back
in the saddle again.

2098
02:06:37,561 --> 02:06:40,085
And when he does,
say yes.

2099
02:06:41,347 --> 02:06:43,306
Oh, right.

2100
02:06:44,220 --> 02:06:45,526
Love you!

2101
02:06:47,876 --> 02:06:49,530
Goddamn, that's beautiful.

2102
02:06:56,885 --> 02:06:58,713
You're welcome, Canada.

2103
02:07:11,247 --> 02:07:12,422
Boy howdy.

2104
02:07:14,293 --> 02:07:17,209
Hi. This is a toughie.

2105
02:07:17,253 --> 02:07:18,689
Yeesh.

2106
02:07:18,733 --> 02:07:22,127
Oh, yes. You're already
practicing your salute, huh?

2107
02:07:22,171 --> 02:07:25,000
Yes, you are. Well, we'll
take care of that, won't we?

2108
02:07:25,043 --> 02:07:27,829
Jesus Christ! This is
so much harder than I thought.

2109
02:07:28,656 --> 02:07:30,310
Oh, I'm going to hell.

2110
02:07:30,354 --> 02:07:32,051
That makes two of us.

2111
02:07:32,095 --> 02:07:33,705
You can do this.

2112
02:07:33,749 --> 02:07:36,403
This is crazy. This is crazy.
This is crazy. This is crazy.

2113
02:07:36,447 --> 02:07:37,579
All right.

2114
02:07:44,934 --> 02:07:47,327
Maximum effort.

2115
02:13:25,019 --> 02:13:27,325
That's okay.
Let me see here.

2116
02:13:27,369 --> 02:13:28,892
Oh, God.

2117
02:13:28,936 --> 02:13:30,894
That's why you're
such a little bastard.

2118
02:13:30,938 --> 02:13:33,288
No one's ever changed you.

2119
02:13:33,331 --> 02:13:36,073
Yeah, you got a big, old
stinky in there, don't you?

2120
02:13:36,117 --> 02:13:38,946
God, it smells like
Hitler's anus...

2121
02:13:38,989 --> 02:13:41,557
which would makes sense,
wouldn't it? Yeah.

2122
02:13:41,600 --> 02:13:42,775
I think we both know

2123
02:13:42,819 --> 02:13:44,231
I don't have
what it takes to do this...

2124
02:13:44,255 --> 02:13:46,431
so I'm just gonna change
your diaper real quick...

2125
02:13:46,475 --> 02:13:48,409
and then I'm gonna come back
with my friend, Cable.

2126
02:13:48,433 --> 02:13:49,826
He loves killing kids.
