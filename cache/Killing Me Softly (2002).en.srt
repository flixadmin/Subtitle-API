1
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,298
You know what happens
at that height?

2
00:01:41,672 --> 00:01:44,875
The brain dies
from lack of oxygen...

3
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,604
cell by cell.

4
00:01:47,778 --> 00:01:49,678
It just shuts down...

5
00:01:49,713 --> 00:01:51,271
and the body goes with it.

6
00:01:53,217 --> 00:01:55,947
I can't stop thinking about
what it must have been like.

7
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:39,796
Why don't you start
at the beginning?

8
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:41,787
It's always the easiest.

9
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:46,461
OK, I'll start
at the beginning.

10
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:17,600
I grew up on the plains
in Indiana.

11
00:03:17,635 --> 00:03:20,229
I was a flatlander,
through and through.

12
00:03:21,306 --> 00:03:22,305
To be honest...

13
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,454
I really didn't have
much to leave behind.

14
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:28,569
Virtually no family
and very few friends.

15
00:03:29,847 --> 00:03:32,549
Anyway, it was January.

16
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:36,286
I'd already been in London
a year and a half.

17
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:39,691
For the first six months,
I'd been incredibly lonely.

18
00:03:39,726 --> 00:03:41,181
Then I met Jake.

19
00:03:45,163 --> 00:03:46,729
What I loved the most...

20
00:03:46,764 --> 00:03:49,665
was how comfortable
we were with each other.

21
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:52,502
I felt safe.

22
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,583
OK, let's go.

23
00:04:11,923 --> 00:04:14,058
I design CD-roms
and websites...

24
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:15,427
for corporate clients.

25
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:16,726
That must pay well.

26
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:19,097
It sounds fancier
than it is.

27
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:20,797
Jake was an engineer.

28
00:04:20,832 --> 00:04:24,335
Tunnels and bridges,
that sort of thing.

29
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,702
He kept his tube tickets...

30
00:04:25,737 --> 00:04:28,006
in a wallet he got
when he was twelve.

31
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:31,175
Same wallet,
same inside pocket.

32
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,837
Alice? Alice?

33
00:04:36,948 --> 00:04:39,075
See you later.

34
00:05:51,022 --> 00:05:52,106
Hey, Alice.

35
00:05:52,141 --> 00:05:53,191
You going in?

36
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:54,180
Yeah.

37
00:06:18,816 --> 00:06:20,249
I'll see you in a minute.

38
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:59,558
Reconfigure the training
program manual...

39
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:02,024
to make it look like
a game on the website.

40
00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:04,456
We tried that with
the appliance kings.

41
00:07:06,632 --> 00:07:09,699
Yes, but this isn't
about washing machines.

42
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:12,767
Now we're training
a worldwide sales force.

43
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:19,511
You're the new media pioneers.

44
00:07:19,546 --> 00:07:21,111
Think of something.

45
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:23,808
Alice, you still have
the old template, don't you?

46
00:07:24,817 --> 00:07:26,785
Are you with us, Alice?

47
00:07:42,234 --> 00:07:43,569
I'm going out
to get my hair trimmed.

48
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:44,763
I'll be back after lunch.

49
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:09,220
Oh, shoot!

50
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:31,850
And you got in?

51
00:08:31,885 --> 00:08:33,717
Yeah...

52
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:35,550
I got in.

53
00:09:22,668 --> 00:09:24,570
What's your name?

54
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,832
Alice.

55
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,971
Alice.

56
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:41,104
Don't turn away.

57
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,149
Come here tomorrow.

58
00:12:02,161 --> 00:12:03,526
I have to work.

59
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:10,967
Then come back tonight.

60
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:13,302
I can't.

61
00:12:18,544 --> 00:12:21,477
Whenever you want, Alice.

62
00:12:21,512 --> 00:12:24,411
You decide, and I'll be here.

63
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,098
I couldn't believe
what had happened that day.

64
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,395
I knew it shouldn't
happen again.

65
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:48,132
I wanted everything
back the way it was.

66
00:12:58,352 --> 00:13:00,411
What do you want me to do?

67
00:13:02,723 --> 00:13:04,554
Nothing, just keep doing
what you're doing.

68
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:57,744
That was when
I found out his name...

69
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,978
Adam Tallis...

70
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:01,844
and that he climbed mountains.

71
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:12,359
He caused quite a stir
here yesterday.

72
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,795
He saved
six people up there...

73
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,195
with no oxygen.

74
00:15:10,751 --> 00:15:12,119
You stop me
whenever you want.

75
00:15:12,154 --> 00:15:13,814
Please don't stop.

76
00:15:24,197 --> 00:15:25,789
I bought your book today.

77
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:29,349
It isn't my book.

78
00:15:29,384 --> 00:15:31,365
I'm just in it.

79
00:15:32,706 --> 00:15:34,799
It looks good.

80
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:40,510
People died, Alice.

81
00:15:51,058 --> 00:15:52,582
Something went very wrong.

82
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:05,832
There was a woman
named Francoise Collette.

83
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:12,978
I lost the whole group.

84
00:16:16,985 --> 00:16:19,854
I still don't understand
what happened.

85
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:21,622
There was no room for error.

86
00:16:21,657 --> 00:16:23,355
Everything had been checked.

87
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:30,062
I was in love with her.

88
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,530
Do you know what it's like
over 20,000 feet?

89
00:16:45,947 --> 00:16:47,107
It's like this.

90
00:16:48,116 --> 00:16:51,210
Without air,
the brain cells die.

91
00:16:53,354 --> 00:16:55,322
It shuts down.

92
00:16:57,992 --> 00:17:00,460
And then the rest
of the body follows.

93
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,620
It's been two years...

94
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,470
and it doesn't go away.

95
00:17:22,717 --> 00:17:24,207
I live with someone.

96
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:29,986
But you're here.

97
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,191
I have to go.

98
00:17:42,003 --> 00:17:43,436
Don't put them on.

99
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,922
Hi. Where are you?

100
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,165
I'm running some errands.

101
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,835
Do you think you could
pick up my watch...

102
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:14,801
on the way home?

103
00:18:14,836 --> 00:18:15,837
I'm running behind schedule.

104
00:18:15,872 --> 00:18:16,838
I'm never going to make it.

105
00:18:16,873 --> 00:18:17,827
Of course I can.

106
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,642
I missed you today, Alice.

107
00:18:21,677 --> 00:18:23,194
Miss you.

108
00:18:23,229 --> 00:18:24,499
I love you.

109
00:18:24,534 --> 00:18:25,770
Love you.

110
00:18:43,764 --> 00:18:45,925
Knock it! Not nice.

111
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:49,563
And give it!

112
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,597
Go in!

113
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:13,022
A card? Ref,
that's a bit harsh.

114
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,597
Yeah. Sorry. I'm just...

115
00:19:20,632 --> 00:19:22,896
There's nobody there!

116
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:25,372
I have to leave you.

117
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:27,340
You what?

118
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:29,207
I can't go on like this.
I'm sorry.

119
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:31,906
I have to leave.

120
00:19:36,151 --> 00:19:37,846
You have to leave me?

121
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,163
We're together.

122
00:19:55,671 --> 00:19:57,536
We're perfect together.

123
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:02,303
I want to marry you.

124
00:20:06,815 --> 00:20:08,043
I met somebody.

125
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:20,993
Who did you meet?

126
00:20:21,028 --> 00:20:22,859
You don't know him.

127
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:25,732
I'm sorry.

128
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,935
When did you meet him?

129
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,238
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

130
00:20:29,273 --> 00:20:31,057
It's not the point...

131
00:20:31,092 --> 00:20:32,806
It's very much the point!

132
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:35,944
We go to the market
together every Sunday!

133
00:20:35,979 --> 00:20:39,047
I buy your fucking
tube tickets for you!

134
00:20:39,082 --> 00:20:40,480
Jesus!

135
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,585
Where you going?

136
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,552
You were looking for Adam.

137
00:21:18,587 --> 00:21:21,189
He's not here
at the moment...

138
00:21:21,224 --> 00:21:23,791
but it's cold out there.
Come in.

139
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:27,295
Please, come in.

140
00:21:34,903 --> 00:21:37,133
I've been climbing in Chile.

141
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,023
Adam always takes
his pictures down...

142
00:21:42,058 --> 00:21:45,207
or makes sure his back
is turned to them.

143
00:21:47,115 --> 00:21:49,106
Oh, please, sit down.

144
00:21:51,253 --> 00:21:54,538
For me, pictures
tell me who I am...

145
00:21:54,573 --> 00:21:57,824
but for Adam,
they steal his soul.

146
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:02,697
Want some?

147
00:22:02,732 --> 00:22:03,997
No, thank you.

148
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
No, it's quite good.

149
00:22:06,935 --> 00:22:08,970
I'm his sister.

150
00:22:09,005 --> 00:22:11,106
You're his sister?

151
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:13,173
Yep. I'm Deborah.

152
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:16,777
We climb together a lot.

153
00:22:16,812 --> 00:22:18,747
He was having some work
done on his place...

154
00:22:18,782 --> 00:22:21,614
so he stayed here
while I was gone.

155
00:22:23,118 --> 00:22:24,084
This...

156
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:27,282
is Mr. Know-it-all.

157
00:22:31,093 --> 00:22:32,754
It's his name.

158
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:39,551
This is Francoise, right?

159
00:22:39,586 --> 00:22:41,501
That's the real reason...

160
00:22:41,537 --> 00:22:44,040
my brother takes
the pictures down...

161
00:22:44,075 --> 00:22:45,302
because it's...

162
00:22:46,442 --> 00:22:48,307
too hard for him to see her.

163
00:22:49,345 --> 00:22:53,213
My brother's a brave guy,
but sometimes...

164
00:22:55,218 --> 00:22:57,118
he's afraid of remembering.

165
00:23:01,557 --> 00:23:03,624
What he forgets...

166
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:06,195
is that he's not
the only one responsible.

167
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,026
I was up there, too.

168
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,759
She was
my best friend, Alice.

169
00:23:21,778 --> 00:23:25,441
Yes, I know your name.

170
00:23:28,184 --> 00:23:30,550
You're very beautiful.

171
00:23:32,588 --> 00:23:35,182
I can see why he'd
fall so hard for you.

172
00:23:42,865 --> 00:23:44,765
The thing about my brother...

173
00:23:45,868 --> 00:23:48,503
is you're either
with him or you're not.

174
00:23:48,538 --> 00:23:52,642
And once you've made
the jump and you're with him...

175
00:23:52,677 --> 00:23:53,908
that's it...

176
00:23:53,943 --> 00:23:55,433
there's no discussion.

177
00:24:02,051 --> 00:24:03,319
Can I have his address?

178
00:24:03,354 --> 00:24:06,345
Yes, of course.

179
00:24:14,597 --> 00:24:16,258
Thank you.

180
00:25:28,404 --> 00:25:30,235
I left him.

181
00:25:33,976 --> 00:25:35,273
You're hurting me.

182
00:26:28,765 --> 00:26:29,823
Morning.

183
00:26:31,969 --> 00:26:34,199
Alice, this is Joanna.
Joanna, Alice.

184
00:26:38,842 --> 00:26:41,044
Joanna Noble
from "The Guardian."

185
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,077
I'm interviewing Adam

186
00:26:42,112 --> 00:26:43,880
about his Himalayan
clean-up project.

187
00:26:43,915 --> 00:26:46,075
Nice to meet you.

188
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:49,408
Where can I find a shirt?

189
00:27:28,158 --> 00:27:29,124
Your phone?

190
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:30,285
Would you get that for me?

191
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:39,897
No one there.

192
00:27:42,706 --> 00:27:44,172
In some respects,
it's just become...

193
00:27:44,207 --> 00:27:47,074
a playground for
the rich and inexperienced.

194
00:27:50,814 --> 00:27:51,803
Thank you.

195
00:27:55,185 --> 00:27:56,351
I have to go to work.

196
00:27:56,386 --> 00:27:58,221
Will you think
about me today?

197
00:27:58,256 --> 00:28:00,057
Yes.
What are you doing today?

198
00:28:00,092 --> 00:28:01,046
Thinking about you.

199
00:28:03,226 --> 00:28:04,795
Do you want to learn
how to climb?

200
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,428
Sure.

201
00:28:06,463 --> 00:28:08,124
Come and see me after work.

202
00:28:58,615 --> 00:28:59,848
That's good.

203
00:28:59,883 --> 00:29:01,874
He's not as strong
as he was last week.

204
00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:13,160
It's lovely to see you.

205
00:29:16,968 --> 00:29:18,469
I see you've got a harness.

206
00:29:18,504 --> 00:29:19,936
Do you want to put it on?

207
00:29:19,971 --> 00:29:22,905
Just put your feet
in there...

208
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,931
and pull it up
like a pair of trousers.

209
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,542
That's great.

210
00:29:35,486 --> 00:29:38,489
That's right, double-back in.

211
00:29:38,524 --> 00:29:39,574
There we go.

212
00:29:39,609 --> 00:29:40,611
It suits you.

213
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:41,614
Thank you.

214
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,102
It's OK. I'm helping her.

215
00:29:51,137 --> 00:29:52,354
How are you?

216
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:54,114
OK, fine.

217
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:55,805
I'm sorry.

218
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,966
Let me check your harness.

219
00:30:01,913 --> 00:30:03,244
Seems to be good.

220
00:30:06,918 --> 00:30:09,153
She's my sister,
but she drives me mad.

221
00:30:09,188 --> 00:30:10,381
I swear it's chemical.

222
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:12,855
You ready?

223
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:14,358
I don't know. Maybe.

224
00:30:14,393 --> 00:30:15,552
Come on.

225
00:30:19,197 --> 00:30:22,331
Well, finally, Alice.

226
00:30:22,366 --> 00:30:25,336
The flatlander captured
the mountain boy.

227
00:30:25,371 --> 00:30:28,606
Alice, meet Klaus.
Klaus, Alice.

228
00:30:28,641 --> 00:30:29,937
I liked your book.

229
00:30:31,776 --> 00:30:33,403
Well, thank you.

230
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,213
Well, nice to meet you.

231
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:44,053
This looks hard.

232
00:30:44,088 --> 00:30:45,487
It's all in the mind.

233
00:31:05,176 --> 00:31:07,178
I mean, my taste in clothes
has completely changed.

234
00:31:07,213 --> 00:31:08,344
Really?

235
00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:11,542
I bought this practically
transparent pink T-shirt.

236
00:31:12,717 --> 00:31:15,152
And I won't even tell you
about the lingerie.

237
00:31:15,187 --> 00:31:17,772
No. Probably best not
to mention the lingerie.

238
00:31:17,807 --> 00:31:20,358
I'm still in the big
white cotton panties.

239
00:31:20,393 --> 00:31:21,848
I'm sorry.
I'm a little manic.

240
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,088
Have you seen Jake?

241
00:31:28,532 --> 00:31:29,532
Of course I have.

242
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:31,398
He's been my friend
for 15 years.

243
00:31:32,937 --> 00:31:33,903
How is he?

244
00:31:33,938 --> 00:31:34,904
What can I say?

245
00:31:34,939 --> 00:31:36,119
He's smoking like a fiend...

246
00:31:36,154 --> 00:31:37,299
and he's completely fucked up.

247
00:31:38,576 --> 00:31:40,407
It's not like there's
no reason, is there?

248
00:31:43,147 --> 00:31:44,512
Sorry.

249
00:31:49,287 --> 00:31:52,654
I think that you're
destroying both of your lives.

250
00:31:54,058 --> 00:31:55,491
I'm sorry.

251
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,899
You had somebody
who loved you.

252
00:32:01,934 --> 00:32:04,333
You loved each other...

253
00:32:04,368 --> 00:32:07,303
and you let him go
for good sex.

254
00:32:07,338 --> 00:32:09,907
Love isn't just
a good fuck, you know?

255
00:32:09,942 --> 00:32:11,142
This is more.

256
00:32:11,177 --> 00:32:12,308
More what?

257
00:32:12,343 --> 00:32:13,309
More everything.

258
00:32:13,344 --> 00:32:15,613
When I'm with him,
everything is more.

259
00:32:15,648 --> 00:32:16,579
Oh, God, Alice.

260
00:32:16,614 --> 00:32:17,815
You could write
greetings cards.

261
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:19,248
You really bloody could.

262
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:25,979
Sorry.

263
00:32:29,695 --> 00:32:30,855
Right.

264
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:35,399
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

265
00:32:35,434 --> 00:32:37,703
I could do with some retail
therapy myself, I think.

266
00:32:37,738 --> 00:32:39,038
I can't,
but come with me.

267
00:32:39,073 --> 00:32:40,339
I'm gonna
see Adam at 3:00.

268
00:32:40,374 --> 00:32:41,328
You can meet him.

269
00:32:47,012 --> 00:32:49,447
And there's this
really amazing store...

270
00:32:49,482 --> 00:32:51,882
and I haven't bought it
yet, but I will...

271
00:33:03,061 --> 00:33:04,619
It's OK. She's fine.

272
00:33:37,863 --> 00:33:38,852
Call the police.

273
00:33:41,366 --> 00:33:43,527
Adam! Stop!

274
00:33:57,049 --> 00:33:58,383
When I saw him...

275
00:33:58,418 --> 00:34:00,650
oh, Jesus.

276
00:34:00,685 --> 00:34:02,387
That'll never happen again.

277
00:34:02,422 --> 00:34:03,479
I won't let it.

278
00:34:06,892 --> 00:34:08,260
Are you OK?

279
00:34:08,295 --> 00:34:09,526
Yeah.

280
00:34:09,561 --> 00:34:11,196
I'll always be here, Alice.

281
00:34:11,231 --> 00:34:12,662
Yeah.

282
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:13,898
I'll protect you.

283
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:15,100
Say you believe me.

284
00:34:15,135 --> 00:34:16,260
I believe you.

285
00:34:23,075 --> 00:34:24,133
Marry me.

286
00:34:30,215 --> 00:34:32,184
The sooner the better.

287
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,351
Tomorrow.

288
00:34:34,386 --> 00:34:36,254
The day after,
as soon as possible.

289
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:38,347
- Marry me!
- Yes!

290
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,837
Sir, can we ask you
some questions, please?

291
00:35:20,198 --> 00:35:21,865
"Use your head, Alice.

292
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,027
"What do you really know
about him?"

293
00:35:31,143 --> 00:35:32,324
Hey, you ready?

294
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:33,505
Look at this.

295
00:35:36,781 --> 00:35:38,449
Someone's trying to scare you.

296
00:35:38,484 --> 00:35:40,118
There's been
a call this morning.

297
00:35:40,154 --> 00:35:41,217
There was someone there...

298
00:35:41,252 --> 00:35:42,280
but they didn't say anything.

299
00:35:43,956 --> 00:35:44,989
Makes me sick.

300
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:48,294
If anything else
happens like this again...

301
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:50,888
make sure you tell me, OK?

302
00:35:51,898 --> 00:35:54,128
You'll be fine.

303
00:36:24,363 --> 00:36:25,663
Do you, Alice...

304
00:36:25,698 --> 00:36:27,566
promise to love
and cherish Adam...

305
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:29,435
for as long
as you both shall live?

306
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,135
I do.

307
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,974
And do you, Adam, promise
to love and cherish Alice...

308
00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:37,310
for as long
as you both shall live?

309
00:36:37,345 --> 00:36:38,743
I do.

310
00:36:38,778 --> 00:36:40,980
May the Lord
bless this union...

311
00:36:41,015 --> 00:36:43,642
and secure it from all harm.

312
00:37:06,205 --> 00:37:08,507
How do you know the priest?

313
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:10,860
This is my family church.

314
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,144
You have a family church?

315
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:14,981
Wow, I have a mother
who doesn't talk to me...

316
00:37:15,016 --> 00:37:16,312
and a dad I've never met.

317
00:37:17,483 --> 00:37:18,649
It doesn't matter.

318
00:37:18,684 --> 00:37:21,448
My life began
when we first saw each other.

319
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,626
Come on.
I need you to see something.

320
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,615
What?

321
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,461
No, no, no,
wait, wait, wait.

322
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:47,233
Now, I want you
to see this...

323
00:37:47,268 --> 00:37:48,971
through my eyes
when I was six.

324
00:37:50,016 --> 00:37:51,881
Look. Like this.

325
00:37:59,025 --> 00:38:01,926
You know the story that
we're broken into two pieces?

326
00:38:03,796 --> 00:38:05,229
And we spend our lives

327
00:38:05,264 --> 00:38:07,061
searching for
our other half.

328
00:38:10,636 --> 00:38:11,967
You're it.

329
00:38:20,179 --> 00:38:21,703
OK, here we are.

330
00:38:23,482 --> 00:38:24,847
We're getting dressed here?

331
00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:29,084
Yep. Here.

332
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:52,241
No! No, no, no, no.
Don't do that.

333
00:38:52,276 --> 00:38:54,374
I need to remember you
like this.

334
00:39:09,563 --> 00:39:12,065
Come on. I don't want you
to freeze to death.

335
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,794
Come on.

336
00:39:47,267 --> 00:39:48,500
This is the only
way station...

337
00:39:48,535 --> 00:39:49,733
for hikers
in the whole area.

338
00:39:51,271 --> 00:39:53,796
The church has kept supplies
up here for years.

339
00:40:02,215 --> 00:40:05,152
You went hiking
on your wedding day?

340
00:40:05,187 --> 00:40:07,143
That's his idea of romance.

341
00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:14,995
I thought a honeymoon
was lying in bed...

342
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,094
with room service.

343
00:40:16,129 --> 00:40:19,366
Oh, I'll give you
a honeymoon you won't forget.

344
00:40:19,401 --> 00:40:21,333
I promise.

345
00:40:21,368 --> 00:40:22,357
No, no, sit down.

346
00:40:24,938 --> 00:40:28,101
Choose your rhythm and then
commit to following it.

347
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:30,642
Count if you have to.

348
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:39,415
I'm gonna make you strong!

349
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,611
I wanted him to be
proud of me...

350
00:40:50,646 --> 00:40:53,094
so I followed the trail
for hours.

351
00:41:44,284 --> 00:41:45,512
You made it.

352
00:41:56,196 --> 00:41:57,162
What's that?

353
00:41:57,197 --> 00:41:58,363
It's an anchor...

354
00:41:58,398 --> 00:42:00,525
to catch a falling body.

355
00:42:03,737 --> 00:42:04,726
Catch.

356
00:42:08,141 --> 00:42:10,977
Do you trust me?

357
00:42:11,013 --> 00:42:12,002
Yes.

358
00:42:20,655 --> 00:42:22,054
Don't move.

359
00:42:57,024 --> 00:42:59,625
I gave up all control.

360
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,330
I let him decide
when I could breathe...

361
00:43:02,365 --> 00:43:05,132
and when I couldn't.

362
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:07,032
I loved it.

363
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,879
God, I love you!

364
00:44:14,335 --> 00:44:16,035
We returned to London...

365
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,061
and Joanna Noble's
article came out.

366
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,373
I was happier
than I'd ever been.

367
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:25,668
Excuse me.

368
00:44:27,515 --> 00:44:28,777
- There you go.
- Thanks.

369
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:16,890
Hello, Jake?

370
00:45:17,898 --> 00:45:21,168
No, it's Sylvie speaking.
Hello, Alice.

371
00:45:21,203 --> 00:45:22,401
Sylvie?

372
00:45:22,436 --> 00:45:23,402
I must have dialed wrong.

373
00:45:23,438 --> 00:45:24,439
I thought I was
calling Jake.

374
00:45:24,474 --> 00:45:25,706
Oh, no, no, that's fine.

375
00:45:25,741 --> 00:45:28,577
I just happened to be
over, actually.

376
00:45:28,612 --> 00:45:31,378
Jake's going to be
back soon, I think.

377
00:45:31,413 --> 00:45:34,349
Look, Alice, this is
gonna sound a bit weird...

378
00:45:34,384 --> 00:45:36,017
but I was definitely
going to tell you...

379
00:45:36,052 --> 00:45:39,354
but Jake and I
have actually been...

380
00:45:39,389 --> 00:45:40,889
seeing each other.

381
00:45:40,924 --> 00:45:42,220
You and Jake?

382
00:45:43,725 --> 00:45:46,592
Well, it...
just sort of happened.

383
00:45:49,097 --> 00:45:50,086
Did you move in?

384
00:45:52,067 --> 00:45:55,537
Yeah. Yeah, I did,
uh, sort of.

385
00:45:55,572 --> 00:45:57,437
Oh, Lord.

386
00:45:58,507 --> 00:46:00,458
How cliché is this?

387
00:46:00,493 --> 00:46:02,375
Old friend moves in...

388
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:04,010
to console jilted boyfriend...

389
00:46:04,045 --> 00:46:06,343
and then these two find
themselves together.

390
00:46:08,917 --> 00:46:10,886
You gonna be OK with this?

391
00:46:10,921 --> 00:46:12,820
Yeah, I'm OK.

392
00:46:15,123 --> 00:46:16,454
We're gonna be late!
Hurry up!

393
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:20,560
Yeah, I gotta go.

394
00:46:20,595 --> 00:46:21,823
We'll talk
about it later, OK?

395
00:46:42,684 --> 00:46:43,673
Here we go.

396
00:46:50,325 --> 00:46:52,384
How you doing?!

397
00:46:53,762 --> 00:46:55,286
Hey, Alice, Alice,
I'm sorry.

398
00:47:07,442 --> 00:47:08,805
Sorry.

399
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,169
Excuse me.

400
00:47:15,483 --> 00:47:18,008
How you doing?
It's really nice to see you.

401
00:48:12,674 --> 00:48:14,665
It's Alice Tallis.

402
00:48:16,645 --> 00:48:18,579
My rhyming sister-in-law.

403
00:48:20,448 --> 00:48:21,982
Are you OK?

404
00:48:22,017 --> 00:48:23,852
I have a headache and was
looking for some aspirin.

405
00:48:23,887 --> 00:48:25,410
Oh, no, give me your hand.

406
00:48:33,461 --> 00:48:34,790
Can you feel that?

407
00:48:34,825 --> 00:48:36,119
Yeah, it really hurts.

408
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,389
Close your eyes.

409
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:41,694
Breathe.

410
00:48:43,005 --> 00:48:44,165
Slowly.

411
00:48:57,987 --> 00:48:59,284
That's good.

412
00:49:01,457 --> 00:49:04,160
It's the meridian
that controls the kidney

413
00:49:04,195 --> 00:49:06,628
or the brain
or the left big toe.

414
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:09,461
I forget which.

415
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:14,661
But... it's whatever
works, right?

416
00:49:16,305 --> 00:49:17,872
Thank you.

417
00:49:17,907 --> 00:49:20,034
Close your eyes.

418
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:29,151
OK, you can open them.

419
00:49:29,186 --> 00:49:31,381
Oh, my God.

420
00:49:32,655 --> 00:49:34,924
I want to drink to that
beautiful lady in blue.

421
00:49:34,959 --> 00:49:35,982
Where is she?

422
00:49:42,832 --> 00:49:45,392
I don't think she's ever
climbed past the third floor...

423
00:49:47,003 --> 00:49:48,994
but she has conquered
our Adam.

424
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:53,509
But what she doesn't know
is that to get Adam...

425
00:49:53,544 --> 00:49:55,378
she also gets us.

426
00:49:55,413 --> 00:49:57,278
Hear, hear!

427
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:10,192
Most of the people
using the program are women...

428
00:50:10,227 --> 00:50:11,460
and we try
to sell them a game...

429
00:50:11,495 --> 00:50:13,462
but women don't like games.

430
00:50:13,497 --> 00:50:14,564
Women like stories.

431
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:15,596
Men like games.

432
00:50:15,631 --> 00:50:17,366
Men like to slay the dragon...

433
00:50:17,401 --> 00:50:18,534
and get the princess...

434
00:50:18,569 --> 00:50:19,633
but women like to know...

435
00:50:19,668 --> 00:50:21,103
how did the dragon
and the princess...

436
00:50:21,138 --> 00:50:22,900
all get there
in the first place.

437
00:50:24,707 --> 00:50:26,174
A game is
the wrong approach.

438
00:50:32,415 --> 00:50:33,507
Sorry.

439
00:50:36,485 --> 00:50:37,853
Excuse me.

440
00:50:37,888 --> 00:50:39,186
Alice Tallis.

441
00:50:39,221 --> 00:50:40,455
This is Joanna Noble.

442
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:41,991
Do you remember me?

443
00:50:42,026 --> 00:50:43,457
Yes, I remember you.

444
00:50:43,492 --> 00:50:46,712
I got a weird note
about the article.

445
00:50:46,747 --> 00:50:49,897
I'm not gonna do
anything with it.

446
00:50:49,932 --> 00:50:52,268
I mean, I'm certainly not
going to follow it up.

447
00:50:52,303 --> 00:50:54,254
It's probably
stupid of me...

448
00:50:54,289 --> 00:50:56,205
but I somehow felt obliged...

449
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,570
to tell you about it.

450
00:50:59,041 --> 00:51:01,360
Shall I send it to you?

451
00:51:01,395 --> 00:51:03,679
Yeah, you can send it.

452
00:51:03,714 --> 00:51:05,813
Is it private?

453
00:51:05,848 --> 00:51:08,184
I don't want this sitting
in a public "in" basket.

454
00:51:08,219 --> 00:51:10,286
I understand.
You can fax it.

455
00:51:10,321 --> 00:51:11,538
OK, I'll do that.

456
00:51:11,573 --> 00:51:12,720
You have the number?

457
00:51:12,755 --> 00:51:13,756
Yeah, I got it
from your secretary.

458
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,256
OK, thanks for calling.

459
00:51:15,291 --> 00:51:16,722
Sorry.
I had to take that.

460
00:51:18,928 --> 00:51:20,494
No problem.

461
00:51:20,529 --> 00:51:22,347
Gave me a chance to think.

462
00:51:22,382 --> 00:51:24,131
We shouldn't be playing games.

463
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:26,828
It's obvious
women don't like games.

464
00:51:30,706 --> 00:51:33,107
I think this project
needs a new face.

465
00:51:33,142 --> 00:51:36,078
"Dear Joanna Noble,
what you wrote made me sick.

466
00:51:36,113 --> 00:51:38,731
"Your big hero Adam Tallis
raped me.

467
00:51:38,766 --> 00:51:41,349
"Why don't you try
reporting the truth?"

468
00:51:44,186 --> 00:51:46,313
It's out of paper.

469
00:51:49,892 --> 00:51:52,561
I've decided
that from now on...

470
00:51:52,597 --> 00:51:54,882
this is Alice's project.

471
00:51:54,917 --> 00:51:57,167
You're the new point man...

472
00:51:57,202 --> 00:51:59,069
I mean, point girl...

473
00:51:59,104 --> 00:52:00,115
woman.

474
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,126
Excellent.

475
00:52:07,777 --> 00:52:09,179
Congratulations, Alice.

476
00:52:09,214 --> 00:52:10,407
Thank you.

477
00:52:14,751 --> 00:52:16,386
Open or closed?

478
00:52:16,421 --> 00:52:17,876
Closed.

479
00:52:28,899 --> 00:52:30,161
Fuck!

480
00:52:38,742 --> 00:52:40,609
Alice Tallis' office.

481
00:52:40,644 --> 00:52:42,913
Hello, Claudia,
it's Adam.

482
00:52:42,948 --> 00:52:44,279
Oh, hi, Adam.

483
00:52:44,314 --> 00:52:45,313
Hi. Is Alice there?

484
00:52:45,348 --> 00:52:47,150
No, she's just left,
actually.

485
00:52:47,185 --> 00:52:48,316
Left? Where'd she go?

486
00:52:48,351 --> 00:52:50,478
I think she went
to the doctor's.

487
00:53:01,765 --> 00:53:05,368
So, you thought this woman
was sending the notes?

488
00:53:05,403 --> 00:53:06,392
Yes.

489
00:53:25,922 --> 00:53:27,088
Yeah?

490
00:53:27,123 --> 00:53:30,026
Hello, I'm Joanna Noble
from "The Guardian."

491
00:53:30,061 --> 00:53:31,194
I called you before.

492
00:53:31,229 --> 00:53:32,327
Yeah.

493
00:53:32,362 --> 00:53:34,227
- Are you Michelle Stowe?
- Yeah, I am. Come in.

494
00:53:35,932 --> 00:53:37,763
It was at a birthday party.

495
00:53:40,003 --> 00:53:42,317
I asked him to dance...

496
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:44,632
and then, I don't know...

497
00:53:46,443 --> 00:53:48,502
we start kissin'.

498
00:53:49,512 --> 00:53:52,037
I mean, I was shit-faced.

499
00:53:53,783 --> 00:53:55,808
I came and put my hand
in his shirt...

500
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,720
then we went outside.

501
00:54:04,928 --> 00:54:07,453
Guess at the end, I was just
straightening up a bit...

502
00:54:08,798 --> 00:54:10,356
'cause I remember wondering...

503
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:14,935
what the hell I was doing.

504
00:54:25,949 --> 00:54:28,213
Then he pulled me
into the bushes...

505
00:54:29,319 --> 00:54:30,616
undid my dress.

506
00:54:32,722 --> 00:54:34,019
It was a zip...

507
00:54:35,158 --> 00:54:36,147
in the back.

508
00:54:42,899 --> 00:54:44,696
I was so young.

509
00:54:52,108 --> 00:54:53,871
I started to cry.

510
00:54:55,345 --> 00:54:57,370
He put his hand
over my mouth and kept going.

511
00:55:01,084 --> 00:55:02,284
He's strong.

512
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,310
There was nothing
I could do.

513
00:55:06,757 --> 00:55:08,019
I tried to fight him.

514
00:55:14,065 --> 00:55:16,067
When he was done,
he shook me...

515
00:55:16,102 --> 00:55:17,796
and said something like...

516
00:55:18,903 --> 00:55:21,233
"It's only sex.

517
00:55:21,268 --> 00:55:23,563
"Just sex."

518
00:55:24,809 --> 00:55:25,875
Then he got up...

519
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:29,073
and left the party
with his sister.

520
00:55:38,255 --> 00:55:42,624
So, you want to write
an article about this, then?

521
00:55:43,761 --> 00:55:46,430
I mean, he's not royal
or anything...

522
00:55:46,465 --> 00:55:48,022
but it's close enough.

523
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,598
We can make some money
out of this, Joanna.

524
00:55:58,709 --> 00:56:00,042
It doesn't work that way.

525
00:56:00,077 --> 00:56:02,146
Yeah, it does.
Everybody's always blabbin'...

526
00:56:02,181 --> 00:56:03,781
about who's stickin' it
into who.

527
00:56:03,816 --> 00:56:05,476
They make plenty.

528
00:56:06,784 --> 00:56:08,351
You have no proof.

529
00:56:08,386 --> 00:56:11,719
This is a question of
"he said, she said."

530
00:56:13,691 --> 00:56:16,193
Jesus, Alice, I can't
believe you did this.

531
00:56:16,228 --> 00:56:18,662
What if she calls
my editor?

532
00:56:18,697 --> 00:56:19,729
I could be fired.

533
00:56:19,764 --> 00:56:21,499
Do you think
that nosy wives...

534
00:56:21,534 --> 00:56:23,118
have immunity
from normal behavior?

535
00:56:23,153 --> 00:56:24,702
I knew the minute
that I called...

536
00:56:24,737 --> 00:56:25,803
that it was a mistake.

537
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:27,269
Sorry, Alice.

538
00:56:27,304 --> 00:56:29,271
It's OK. I just...

539
00:56:29,306 --> 00:56:30,791
I thought you should know
what I did.

540
00:56:30,826 --> 00:56:32,276
It was really
just innocent curiosity.

541
00:56:32,311 --> 00:56:34,210
It's never innocent.

542
00:56:34,245 --> 00:56:37,847
Curiosity gets people killed.

543
00:56:37,882 --> 00:56:39,483
What would you do
if it was your husband?

544
00:56:39,518 --> 00:56:41,517
I don't have one.

545
00:56:41,552 --> 00:56:43,085
You not only have one...

546
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,451
but one who's wild
about you.

547
00:56:47,691 --> 00:56:49,818
You're right.
I have to trust him.

548
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,089
People have stories.

549
00:57:19,124 --> 00:57:21,424
You and I, everyone.

550
00:57:21,459 --> 00:57:24,328
But I couldn't tell you
one complete story...

551
00:57:24,363 --> 00:57:26,095
about my husband.

552
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:28,466
Practically everything
I knew about him...

553
00:57:28,501 --> 00:57:31,567
came from a book
or a newspaper...

554
00:57:31,602 --> 00:57:35,306
or shreds of information
dropped by other people.

555
00:57:35,341 --> 00:57:37,641
I couldn't help myself.

556
00:57:37,676 --> 00:57:39,941
I needed to know more.

557
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,935
"Adele Blanchard."

558
00:58:17,014 --> 00:58:18,180
"It's crazy...

559
00:58:18,215 --> 00:58:20,581
"but I want to show
the world my bruises."

560
00:58:22,687 --> 00:58:25,088
"What we're doing
is dangerous...

561
00:58:25,123 --> 00:58:27,751
"but I still can't help
wanting more."

562
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:38,370
"The only way to end this
is to be brutal.

563
00:58:38,405 --> 00:58:41,638
"We have to stop
what we're doing.

564
00:58:41,673 --> 00:58:45,108
"I've decided to go back
to my husband.

565
00:58:45,143 --> 00:58:48,914
"I'm not strong enough to live
on the edge with you anymore.

566
00:58:48,949 --> 00:58:51,216
"I know you won't fall,
but I will.

567
00:58:51,251 --> 00:58:53,383
"I'm sure of it.

568
00:58:53,418 --> 00:58:55,719
"This tears me apart...

569
00:58:55,754 --> 00:58:58,523
"But I have to go back
to Michael.

570
00:58:58,558 --> 00:59:00,154
"I love you.

571
00:59:00,189 --> 00:59:01,751
"Adele."

572
01:00:08,059 --> 01:00:09,822
I've been thinking about you.

573
01:00:16,801 --> 01:00:18,359
Me, too.

574
01:00:38,923 --> 01:00:41,893
I called the office yesterday
looking for you.

575
01:00:41,928 --> 01:00:43,393
Oh, yeah?

576
01:00:43,428 --> 01:00:45,061
Claudia said
you weren't feeling well.

577
01:00:45,096 --> 01:00:46,694
She thought you might be
at the doctor's.

578
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,200
I, um...

579
01:00:50,235 --> 01:00:52,018
I had an appointment,
but, um...

580
01:00:52,053 --> 01:00:53,802
I never got out
of my meeting.

581
01:01:08,086 --> 01:01:10,053
Where was the meeting?

582
01:01:10,088 --> 01:01:12,181
At the, um, client's hotel.

583
01:01:19,597 --> 01:01:20,763
Which hotel?

584
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:21,929
The Hilton.

585
01:01:27,272 --> 01:01:28,534
I'm sorry for being nosy.

586
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:33,269
I just like to picture
what you do during the day.

587
01:01:59,972 --> 01:02:01,997
Where'd you get this?

588
01:02:03,242 --> 01:02:04,573
Deborah gave it to me.

589
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:12,640
She has good taste.

590
01:02:22,695 --> 01:02:24,261
I got a call about, um...

591
01:02:24,296 --> 01:02:26,526
a weird call
about the article.

592
01:02:27,767 --> 01:02:30,636
There was this woman
named Michelle Stowe.

593
01:02:30,671 --> 01:02:32,194
She sent a fax.

594
01:02:35,174 --> 01:02:36,336
Didn't happen, Alice.

595
01:02:36,371 --> 01:02:37,499
I never raped her.

596
01:02:38,711 --> 01:02:40,645
I shouldn't have...

597
01:02:42,248 --> 01:02:45,029
I've known her
since we were kids.

598
01:02:45,064 --> 01:02:47,811
I think she saw me
as a way out.

599
01:02:49,321 --> 01:02:51,752
If you met her,
you'd understand.

600
01:02:51,787 --> 01:02:54,184
I'm not surprised
she contacted you.

601
01:02:57,930 --> 01:02:59,921
I'm just sorry
you had to hear all that.

602
01:03:11,677 --> 01:03:12,643
Good morning.

603
01:03:12,678 --> 01:03:14,128
Hi there.
Are you ready?

604
01:03:14,163 --> 01:03:15,579
I'll just get my jacket.

605
01:03:21,787 --> 01:03:23,387
I'm sorry to barge in
like that...

606
01:03:23,422 --> 01:03:25,224
but your husband refuses
to understand the fact...

607
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:27,024
that sponsors need talk shows...

608
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:30,187
and he would only show up
if I drove.

609
01:03:35,768 --> 01:03:36,734
Why didn't you tell me...

610
01:03:36,769 --> 01:03:38,501
you were gonna be
on a talk show?

611
01:03:38,536 --> 01:03:40,234
It's just
a stupid jazz show.

612
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:45,748
Directory inquiries.

613
01:05:45,783 --> 01:05:47,459
Yes. Adele Blanchard.

614
01:05:47,494 --> 01:05:49,135
Which city, please?

615
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:50,168
It's London.

616
01:05:50,203 --> 01:05:51,938
Do you have a listing
for Adele Blanchard...

617
01:05:51,973 --> 01:05:53,506
on Marchmont Road?

618
01:05:53,541 --> 01:05:54,495
One moment.

619
01:06:07,454 --> 01:06:09,889
This train is about to depart.

620
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:11,720
Please mind the doors.

621
01:06:39,219 --> 01:06:41,016
I'm looking
for Adele Blanchard.

622
01:06:42,422 --> 01:06:43,822
I'm her mother.

623
01:06:43,857 --> 01:06:45,222
Is she home?

624
01:06:48,528 --> 01:06:50,463
You must be one
of her American friends.

625
01:06:50,498 --> 01:06:52,954
We tried to contact everyone.

626
01:06:57,704 --> 01:06:59,831
She's been missing
for eight months.

627
01:07:01,341 --> 01:07:02,741
Missing?

628
01:07:02,776 --> 01:07:04,266
What did you say
your name was?

629
01:07:06,546 --> 01:07:08,046
Joanna.

630
01:07:08,081 --> 01:07:10,300
She never tried
to contact her husband?

631
01:07:10,335 --> 01:07:12,519
Not even a letter
to an old boyfriend...

632
01:07:12,554 --> 01:07:13,885
or something?

633
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,739
Eight months
and not a word.

634
01:07:16,774 --> 01:07:19,524
And this is from a daughter...

635
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:22,722
who manages to e-mail
her mother from Nepal.

636
01:07:28,802 --> 01:07:32,806
Joanna, promise me you'll never
think the worst about Adele.

637
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:35,306
It helps a little...

638
01:07:35,341 --> 01:07:37,673
if one tries to be positive.

639
01:07:46,519 --> 01:07:50,356
She was so happy that day.

640
01:07:50,391 --> 01:07:52,256
No jitters, nothing.

641
01:07:56,229 --> 01:07:57,560
Do you know him?

642
01:07:59,399 --> 01:08:01,132
Adam Tallis.

643
01:08:01,167 --> 01:08:04,471
She climbed all over
the world with him.

644
01:08:04,507 --> 01:08:06,641
My son-in-law Michael...

645
01:08:06,676 --> 01:08:08,775
is a trader in Milan.

646
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:12,780
At first, he never
stood in her way...

647
01:08:12,815 --> 01:08:14,008
when it came to climbing.

648
01:08:15,516 --> 01:08:18,652
Then after two years,
he got fed up.

649
01:08:18,687 --> 01:08:21,789
It was either climbing
or the marriage.

650
01:08:21,824 --> 01:08:23,416
She chose the marriage.

651
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:28,920
The day before she was
supposed to go back to Milan...

652
01:08:31,031 --> 01:08:32,598
she went out...

653
01:08:32,633 --> 01:08:34,692
and never came back.

654
01:08:37,204 --> 01:08:40,306
I found that
in her bags.

655
01:08:40,341 --> 01:08:43,208
It's probably the last
picture taken of her.

656
01:08:46,213 --> 01:08:50,985
Today I've had two signs
that Adele is close by.

657
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:53,044
You arrived,
and Adam called.

658
01:09:00,661 --> 01:09:03,464
He wanted to know
if there was anything new...

659
01:09:03,499 --> 01:09:05,125
in the investigation.

660
01:09:07,468 --> 01:09:08,701
Would you like
to stay for dinner?

661
01:09:08,736 --> 01:09:10,938
No, thank you.
I just... I have to get home.

662
01:09:10,973 --> 01:09:12,530
It's really late.

663
01:09:14,909 --> 01:09:16,075
I'm disappointed.

664
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:18,977
He should be here around 5:00.

665
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:24,308
You and Adam
would love each other.

666
01:09:26,587 --> 01:09:28,319
Sit, sit.

667
01:09:28,354 --> 01:09:30,051
I'll get it.

668
01:09:41,835 --> 01:09:43,787
Is it all right if
I set it up for next week?

669
01:09:43,822 --> 01:09:45,739
I haven't managed
to get to the bank yet.

670
01:09:45,774 --> 01:09:48,142
Yes, of course.

671
01:09:48,177 --> 01:09:50,476
Mrs. Blanchard.

672
01:09:50,511 --> 01:09:52,546
I'm sorry, I just...
I have to get back.

673
01:09:52,581 --> 01:09:53,879
I don't want
to be late.

674
01:09:53,914 --> 01:09:55,082
I was hoping
you would stay a little.

675
01:09:55,117 --> 01:09:56,606
I'm sorry.

676
01:10:14,702 --> 01:10:17,137
This train is about to depart.

677
01:10:17,172 --> 01:10:19,128
Please mind the doors.

678
01:13:49,384 --> 01:13:51,084
What are you doing?!

679
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:53,451
What am I doing?
I'm making you mine.

680
01:14:01,396 --> 01:14:04,132
Sometimes I feel
like I don't know you.

681
01:14:04,167 --> 01:14:05,724
Oh, you know me.

682
01:14:07,936 --> 01:14:09,995
You know everything
you need to know.

683
01:14:12,774 --> 01:14:13,763
Look at me.

684
01:14:17,278 --> 01:14:19,109
Open your eyes.

685
01:14:20,582 --> 01:14:22,115
Please.

686
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:24,618
Open your eyes!

687
01:14:37,066 --> 01:14:38,727
You've been with another man.

688
01:14:41,504 --> 01:14:43,304
No.

689
01:14:43,339 --> 01:14:45,555
What are you doing, then?

690
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:47,772
What's going on in there?

691
01:14:49,478 --> 01:14:51,847
Why do you keep sneaking around?

692
01:14:51,882 --> 01:14:53,814
Is the suspicion exciting?

693
01:14:53,849 --> 01:14:55,749
Do you need it go get off?
What is it?

694
01:14:58,087 --> 01:14:59,748
I found Adele's letters.

695
01:15:03,292 --> 01:15:05,294
You...

696
01:15:05,329 --> 01:15:07,108
found...

697
01:15:07,143 --> 01:15:08,888
her letters?

698
01:15:11,367 --> 01:15:13,130
Is that how
you tell the story?

699
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:15,669
What, they were just...

700
01:15:15,704 --> 01:15:17,317
sitting with my keys
on the table...

701
01:15:17,352 --> 01:15:18,931
and you just happened
to notice them?

702
01:15:34,189 --> 01:15:36,091
Look what I just
happened to find!

703
01:15:36,126 --> 01:15:38,692
These and these!

704
01:15:38,727 --> 01:15:40,095
And I found these!
Here, read them!

705
01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:42,461
I have nothing to hide, Alice!

706
01:16:01,884 --> 01:16:04,546
Did you sneak around
behind my back because you...

707
01:16:06,422 --> 01:16:08,390
need it to get
rougher and rougher?

708
01:16:08,425 --> 01:16:10,221
I mean, is that it?

709
01:16:11,293 --> 01:16:13,441
I'm trying
to understand you, Alice.

710
01:16:13,476 --> 01:16:15,590
If you do this,
will I punish you?

711
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:18,996
Is that what your goal...

712
01:16:29,278 --> 01:16:31,426
Please untie me.

713
01:16:31,461 --> 01:16:33,574
If you trusted me...

714
01:16:35,384 --> 01:16:37,818
you wouldn't be
in this position, Alice.

715
01:16:42,825 --> 01:16:44,625
I just...

716
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:46,729
I wanted to know more...

717
01:16:46,764 --> 01:16:48,395
about you.

718
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:50,798
And I wanted
to know your past...

719
01:16:50,833 --> 01:16:53,167
and I wanted to know
your stories.

720
01:16:54,737 --> 01:16:57,139
I just thought
if I knew more...

721
01:16:57,174 --> 01:16:59,937
that I could love you more.

722
01:17:03,345 --> 01:17:06,281
I know the only thing
that matters is us together.

723
01:17:06,316 --> 01:17:07,815
I know that.

724
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:10,119
Because when
you're not around...

725
01:17:10,154 --> 01:17:12,186
I get lost.

726
01:17:12,221 --> 01:17:15,213
It drives me crazy
to think about losing you.

727
01:17:22,698 --> 01:17:24,461
I'm yours, Alice.

728
01:17:27,302 --> 01:17:29,099
What more do you need to know?

729
01:17:38,147 --> 01:17:41,639
I could break your neck,
I love you so much.

730
01:17:46,889 --> 01:17:49,091
Do you want to stay here?

731
01:17:49,127 --> 01:17:50,354
I mean...

732
01:17:52,495 --> 01:17:54,190
do you like this?

733
01:17:57,434 --> 01:18:00,198
Adam, I have to pee.

734
01:18:46,916 --> 01:18:48,110
My God.

735
01:18:56,793 --> 01:18:59,387
Alice, please,
don't do this! Alice!

736
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:04,689
Please!

737
01:19:05,835 --> 01:19:08,167
Where are you going?!

738
01:19:09,706 --> 01:19:11,206
Alice, please!

739
01:19:11,241 --> 01:19:13,266
What are you doing?!

740
01:20:40,897 --> 01:20:43,695
And that's when
I came to you.

741
01:21:01,618 --> 01:21:03,418
I want to be clear
with you.

742
01:21:03,454 --> 01:21:05,756
In my experience,
charges of domestic violence...

743
01:21:05,791 --> 01:21:07,256
are usually too little
too late.

744
01:21:07,291 --> 01:21:09,759
I want you to reopen
the Adele Blanchard case.

745
01:21:11,962 --> 01:21:13,981
It's not easy
to reopen a case like this.

746
01:21:14,016 --> 01:21:16,000
Britain is swimming
in missing persons.

747
01:21:16,035 --> 01:21:17,099
He killed her.

748
01:21:17,134 --> 01:21:19,101
Mrs. Tallis, any case...

749
01:21:19,136 --> 01:21:23,107
missing person or murder,
needs evidence.

750
01:21:23,142 --> 01:21:24,775
I have to ask you
what you have.

751
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:27,141
Adele's letters?

752
01:21:28,279 --> 01:21:29,245
No.

753
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,915
Warning notes?

754
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:33,315
No.

755
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:34,984
You have...

756
01:21:35,019 --> 01:21:36,618
two photos.

757
01:21:37,721 --> 01:21:40,324
Proof of nothing.

758
01:21:40,359 --> 01:21:42,439
He raped Michelle.

759
01:21:42,474 --> 01:21:44,519
She never reported it.

760
01:21:57,675 --> 01:21:59,666
Start without me.
I'll be there in a bit.

761
01:22:05,282 --> 01:22:07,546
I'd like to help you,
Mrs. Tallis.

762
01:22:09,019 --> 01:22:11,852
What everyone else
does to be like him.

763
01:22:13,257 --> 01:22:14,823
He can't see you.

764
01:22:14,858 --> 01:22:17,226
She's pretty shaken up.

765
01:22:17,261 --> 01:22:19,395
Is she? I mean,
is she hurt?

766
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:21,398
She... Jesus, she was
running into traffic.

767
01:22:21,433 --> 01:22:23,349
Let's get a doctor.

768
01:22:23,384 --> 01:22:25,266
She'll be fine.

769
01:22:28,372 --> 01:22:30,636
I would never hurt her.

770
01:22:32,910 --> 01:22:34,476
I love her.

771
01:22:34,511 --> 01:22:36,278
You brought him in?

772
01:22:36,313 --> 01:22:38,715
He walked in,
looking for you.

773
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:40,929
He brought in
a pair of shoes.

774
01:22:40,964 --> 01:22:43,109
He was worried
about your feet.

775
01:22:48,859 --> 01:22:50,392
I believe your husband...

776
01:22:50,427 --> 01:22:53,296
has the potential
for violence.

777
01:22:53,331 --> 01:22:56,166
I believe he's unpredictable.

778
01:22:56,201 --> 01:22:58,464
But is he a murderer?

779
01:22:59,737 --> 01:23:01,068
I don't know.

780
01:23:02,806 --> 01:23:04,908
The truth is, what you two
have been doing together...

781
01:23:04,943 --> 01:23:06,500
was consensual.

782
01:23:07,511 --> 01:23:09,138
You said it yourself.

783
01:23:10,848 --> 01:23:11,872
You liked it.

784
01:23:32,102 --> 01:23:34,297
Can you close the blinds?

785
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:50,917
I won't be able to keep him
for much more than a few hours.

786
01:23:53,290 --> 01:23:55,225
That's as much of a window
as I can give you.

787
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:57,958
You're accusing a hero,
Mrs. Tallis...

788
01:23:57,993 --> 01:24:00,656
and you have
absolutely no evidence.

789
01:24:14,945 --> 01:24:16,480
Alice, what's happened to you?

790
01:24:16,515 --> 01:24:18,547
Oh, Deborah, I'm sorry.

791
01:24:18,583 --> 01:24:20,051
I'm not crazy,
I just... I just...

792
01:24:20,086 --> 01:24:21,484
I went to
the police station...

793
01:24:21,519 --> 01:24:23,888
but no one believed me,
and I just... I just...

794
01:24:23,923 --> 01:24:25,156
He came in and he
brought my shoes...

795
01:24:25,191 --> 01:24:26,423
and they thought
I was nuts...

796
01:24:26,458 --> 01:24:27,859
but, I mean, I know
he's your brother...

797
01:24:27,894 --> 01:24:29,260
but, I mean,
you were her friend, too.

798
01:24:29,295 --> 01:24:31,094
Maybe you could, um...

799
01:24:31,129 --> 01:24:32,397
Look, you remember when
you said that you were...

800
01:24:32,432 --> 01:24:34,831
either with him or not,
no discussion?

801
01:24:34,866 --> 01:24:38,049
Well, I'm... I'm not...
I'm trying to understand.

802
01:24:38,084 --> 01:24:41,233
I... I just, I want to ask,
I mean, um... uh...

803
01:24:43,341 --> 01:24:45,571
Was Francoise
with someone else?

804
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:53,739
Yes.

805
01:24:57,555 --> 01:24:59,357
It wasn't an accident.

806
01:24:59,392 --> 01:25:00,585
She left him...

807
01:25:01,593 --> 01:25:03,493
so he killed her.

808
01:25:12,170 --> 01:25:13,159
Maybe.

809
01:25:22,947 --> 01:25:25,849
This is the anchor
that we used.

810
01:25:25,884 --> 01:25:28,820
It's made of titanium,
but the important thing is...

811
01:25:28,855 --> 01:25:31,006
it can hold
2,000 falling pounds.

812
01:25:31,041 --> 01:25:33,123
I've got a friend
in Kathmandu...

813
01:25:33,158 --> 01:25:35,960
who sent me an anchor
that they're making locally...

814
01:25:35,995 --> 01:25:37,594
with the wrong material.

815
01:25:37,629 --> 01:25:41,499
This is what happened
with just seventy-five pounds.

816
01:25:41,534 --> 01:25:43,733
Maybe you're right.

817
01:25:43,768 --> 01:25:45,770
Adam could have
switched the anchors...

818
01:25:45,805 --> 01:25:46,998
for Francoise's group.

819
01:25:52,043 --> 01:25:53,237
He killed them.

820
01:26:31,916 --> 01:26:33,952
Leave him, Alice.

821
01:26:33,987 --> 01:26:35,385
I know him.

822
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:37,115
You have to leave him,
for your own good.

823
01:26:39,724 --> 01:26:43,228
Deborah... Deborah,
it's not the only time.

824
01:26:43,263 --> 01:26:44,327
What?

825
01:26:44,362 --> 01:26:45,964
I think that, um,
he was with a woman...

826
01:26:45,999 --> 01:26:47,230
Adele Blanchard,
and I think...

827
01:26:47,265 --> 01:26:49,334
that she was gonna leave him
to go back to her husband...

828
01:26:49,369 --> 01:26:52,167
and... and I think that...
that he killed her.

829
01:26:53,338 --> 01:26:55,722
Adele was never gonna
go back to Michael.

830
01:26:55,757 --> 01:26:58,107
Everyone knew
their marriage was over.

831
01:26:59,844 --> 01:27:01,175
I read her letters.

832
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:05,115
She ended it with Adam.

833
01:27:06,618 --> 01:27:09,052
And, uh, I just, um...

834
01:27:09,087 --> 01:27:12,023
I think that, uh,
that she's there.

835
01:27:12,058 --> 01:27:13,012
What?

836
01:27:15,994 --> 01:27:17,126
I went to the police.

837
01:27:17,161 --> 01:27:18,162
The police,
they won't do anything.

838
01:27:18,197 --> 01:27:19,151
They need evidence.

839
01:27:21,165 --> 01:27:23,268
I think he buried her here...

840
01:27:23,303 --> 01:27:24,326
at Saint Edmund's.

841
01:27:25,336 --> 01:27:27,395
I need you
to help me find her.

842
01:27:28,973 --> 01:27:30,440
Do you want to go with me?

843
01:27:43,989 --> 01:27:46,480
I have a confession to make.

844
01:27:48,794 --> 01:27:49,852
I sent you those notes.

845
01:27:51,196 --> 01:27:54,566
I know about
my brother's violence.

846
01:27:54,601 --> 01:27:56,090
I've seen it.

847
01:27:59,038 --> 01:28:01,040
I should have done more, but...

848
01:28:01,075 --> 01:28:02,632
it's no excuse...

849
01:28:04,576 --> 01:28:06,339
but he scares me.

850
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:13,311
I'm glad you got away
from him, Alice.

851
01:28:15,387 --> 01:28:17,685
You'll be OK now.

852
01:29:55,687 --> 01:29:56,889
Can I take that?

853
01:29:56,924 --> 01:29:58,186
Yeah, sure.

854
01:30:00,859 --> 01:30:02,258
I think it's here.

855
01:30:03,762 --> 01:30:06,925
He took the pictures
just by the angel.

856
01:30:49,342 --> 01:30:50,775
Oh, my God.

857
01:31:32,919 --> 01:31:34,750
She didn't have to die.

858
01:31:38,625 --> 01:31:39,657
If only she'd told me...

859
01:31:39,692 --> 01:31:41,557
she was going back
to Michael.

860
01:31:44,731 --> 01:31:45,789
Yeah.

861
01:31:48,167 --> 01:31:50,101
I gave her one, too.

862
01:31:52,005 --> 01:31:54,073
She thought it was beautiful,
just like you did.

863
01:31:54,108 --> 01:31:56,098
Why did you do this?!

864
01:32:02,115 --> 01:32:04,417
Who do you think gave him
his first piece of silk?

865
01:32:04,452 --> 01:32:06,017
He was just 15!

866
01:32:06,052 --> 01:32:08,680
I'm talking
about fucking, Alice!

867
01:32:10,189 --> 01:32:12,987
That's right!
We fucked right here!

868
01:32:19,732 --> 01:32:21,499
Adam is mine!

869
01:32:21,534 --> 01:32:23,266
He's mine!

870
01:32:39,852 --> 01:32:41,753
Why?!

871
01:32:41,788 --> 01:32:44,470
I was never yours!

872
01:32:44,505 --> 01:32:47,152
We were kids. Kids!

873
01:32:49,162 --> 01:32:50,610
It's over.

874
01:32:50,645 --> 01:32:52,059
It's all over.

875
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:01,773
Oh, God.

876
01:34:05,372 --> 01:34:06,771
She and I...

877
01:34:11,779 --> 01:34:13,974
We used to come
here together.

878
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:22,916
I just thought
you had to trust me.

879
01:35:10,404 --> 01:35:11,871
And that's how it ended.

880
01:35:13,006 --> 01:35:15,207
Yet not a day goes by...

881
01:35:15,242 --> 01:35:18,612
without at least one thought
about the passion.

882
01:35:18,647 --> 01:35:20,979
Maybe I was so blinded by it...

883
01:35:21,014 --> 01:35:25,144
that I missed all the clues
to his past.

884
01:35:34,962 --> 01:35:37,162
I often wonder...

885
01:35:37,197 --> 01:35:38,497
what would have happened...

886
01:35:38,532 --> 01:35:41,262
if I hadn't looked up
that morning.

887
01:35:50,444 --> 01:35:54,210
Two years later,
I saw him once more.

888
01:36:32,286 --> 01:36:33,548
I don't know.

889
01:36:34,755 --> 01:36:37,022
Maybe a flatlander like me...

890
01:36:37,057 --> 01:36:39,290
can't live at that altitude.

891
01:36:40,594 --> 01:36:42,262
Maybe it never would
have been possible...

892
01:36:42,297 --> 01:36:44,594
to sustain what we had.

893
01:36:46,066 --> 01:36:47,055
Maybe.

894
01:36:49,236 --> 01:36:51,898
Well, that's what
I tell myself.
