1
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:34,282
Excuse me. Sorry. I'm sorry.

2
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,075
Excuse me. Coming through.

3
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,862
<i>Tonight, so-called
magician Lionel Shrike</i>

4
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,449
<i>is making another sad
attempt for attention</i>

5
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,877
<i>by performing what he calls
an impossible feat.</i>

6
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:49,331
<i>The safe is made of
the strongest iron.</i>

7
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,542
<i>It can't be sawed through or pried.</i>

8
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:56,925
<i>Yet, Lionel Shrike thinks
he's able to escape.</i>

9
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,847
Dad! Dad!

10
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:03,686
Hey, buddy.
You made it, huh?

11
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:07,140
Now, see that seat there?

12
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,724
It's the best seat in the house.

13
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,029
Is Lionel Shrike the kind
of magician who can pull this off?

14
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,982
<i>Or is he actually
in over his head?</i>

15
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,658
We'll see about that.

16
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,076
- What's the matter?
- I don't want you to go.

17
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,325
Dylan, come on.
We talked about this.

18
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,703
Remember?
This is what I do.

19
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,285
I got to prove all
those naysayers wrong.

20
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:30,167
Okay? Besides...

21
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,295
I always keep
something up my sleeve.

22
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,467
Now, got your watch
like your dad's?

23
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,009
- Okay. How many seconds?
- Three hundred.

24
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,761
Three hundred. Maybe a few less.

25
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:46,975
Mmm.
I love you so much.

26
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,684
Okay. See you later, big man.

27
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:56,397
Ladies and gentlemen,
Lionel Shrike!

28
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,950
Will he be able
to hold his breath?

29
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:03,701
Will he be able to
somehow escape the safe?

30
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,494
Three, two, one...

31
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,337
Two, three,

32
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:21,013
four, five, six, seven, eight...

33
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:28,889
296... 297, 298, 299, 300.

34
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:35,103
303, 304...

35
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,855
<i>It's five minutes now,</i>

36
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:43,327
<i>and we have not seen or heard
anything from Lionel Shrike yet.</i>

37
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,528
Move!

38
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:46,997
Dad!

39
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,751
Dad! Dad!

40
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,079
Let go of me!

41
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,086
Dad!

42
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,218
No! Dad!

43
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,384
Dad! Let go!

44
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,764
Find him!

45
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,161
The Eye.

46
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,868
It may not lie...

47
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,452
<i>But don't think for a moment
that it can't be lied to.</i>

48
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:37,089
<i>Seeing is believing.</i>

49
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,086
<i>But is it truth?</i>

50
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:43,637
<i>People see the Horsemen
as noble Robin Hoods. Are they?</i>

51
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,887
<i>Or are they common thieves?</i>

52
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,809
<i>Depends on your point of view.</i>

53
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,011
<i>Here's what you know.</i>

54
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:54,690
<i>They robbed a bank in Paris
from a stage in Las Vegas.</i>

55
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,392
<i>They fleeced
an insurance magnate</i>

56
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,022
<i>of hundreds of
millions of dollars</i>

57
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,730
<i>and disappeared from
a roof in New York.</i>

58
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:05,068
<i>Always showering their
devoted fans with money.</i>

59
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,028
<i>Here's what you don't know.</i>

60
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,238
<i>They left one man behind.</i>

61
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,745
<i>Framed. Holding the bag. Me.</i>

62
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,711
<i>Are you listening, Horsemen?</i>

63
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,961
<i>When you emerge, and you will,</i>

64
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:24,090
<i>I will be there waiting.</i>

65
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:29,392
<i>Because mark my words,
you will get what's coming to you.</i>

66
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,845
<i>In ways you can't expect.</i>

67
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,851
<i>But very much deserve.</i>

68
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:41,734
<i>Because one thing I believe in
is an eye for an eye.</i>

69
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,024
<i>Welcome, Daniel Atlas.</i>

70
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,439
Who am I speaking to?

71
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,902
I asked to see the face
behind all of this.

72
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:12,283
<i>You've asked many questions.
And registered many complaints.</i>

73
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,283
<i>You can rest assured
that we've heard you.</i>

74
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,864
Have you? Because I don't...

75
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,290
<i>- Trust?
- No.</i>

76
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,085
<i>Your leader?
Your fellow Horsemen?</i>

77
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,627
<i>Perhaps even us?</i>

78
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:25,674
I don't like that we've been
living in hiding for a year.

79
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,967
I don't like that every message
I get from Dylan is,

80
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,671
"Wait. Be patient.
The Eye has a plan."

81
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,132
Wait. <i>Be</i> patient.

82
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,432
<i>The Eye has a plan.</i>

83
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,477
This is games
and it's not working for me.

84
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,483
<i>You feel it is you who should be
leading the Horsemen, not Dylan.</i>

85
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:48,030
<i>If that is what you desire,
stay the course.</i>

86
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,107
<i>Trust that your unique talents</i>

87
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,990
<i>and remarkable mind
will not go unrecognized.</i>

88
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,663
<i>We have a new mission
for the Horsemen.</i>

89
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,833
<i>Dylan has a plan
and will gather you together soon.</i>

90
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,703
<i>Now leave!</i>

91
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,516
North Carolina,
Florida, Maryland, Maine.

92
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,472
We're talking the entire
eastern seaboard.

93
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,477
I need to see some results.

94
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,354
Oh, hey. Oh, sorry.

95
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,548
Just real quick. Can I have you
for a couple of minutes?

96
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,258
I'm right in the middle
of something, Dylan.

97
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,677
No, I know. It's okay. Hey. Hey,
everybody. Sorry. Sorry about that.

98
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,284
Call the mayor.

99
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,738
Thanks a lot.
Twins, huh? Good.

100
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,993
Is he coming?

101
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,166
Look, I wouldn't have
brought you out of that meeting

102
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,708
unless it was something important.

103
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,163
It's about the Horsemen.

104
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,374
Somethings happening here
and it's happening now.

105
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,176
Message boards.
Elite magic society.

106
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,674
There is chatter going on
about the Horsemen

107
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:57,008
and something happening with Octa,
the giant software company.

108
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,102
I know what Octa is.

109
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,847
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but two months ago

110
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,895
we sent men to Philadelphia
because he knew...

111
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,269
- And I said that I was wrong.
- He knew that the Horsemen

112
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,003
were going to hit
the Euro-Atlantic Banking Summit.

113
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,088
- I have proof.
- Let him talk.

114
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,319
Thank you.
Communications.

115
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:13,400
Contact between who I think
might be Daniel Atlas

116
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,155
and who may be Merritt McKinney.

117
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,580
And what do you have?
Emails? Cell phones? Any transcripts?

118
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,828
- Pigeons.
- What?

119
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,205
I'm sorry,
you mean stool pigeons?

120
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,912
No, I mean actual pigeon pigeons.
Like carrier pigeons.

121
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,965
- Okay? Magicians work with pigeons.
- Doves.

122
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,463
Stay with me.

123
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,758
This pigeon, right here...

124
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,432
There's Daniel Atlas.
Same pigeon.

125
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,599
East Village.

126
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,268
Same pigeon, West Village.

127
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,096
42nd Street, pigeon. 65th Street.

128
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,057
All the way up to the
George Washington Bridge

129
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:51,737
on a sail boat with a guy that looks
just like Merritt McKinney.

130
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,234
And what does this all mean?

131
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,736
I know what it means.
It means nothing. It's bullshit.

132
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,534
- Could you sing a new song?
- No.

133
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,611
How is it that two years ago
you were so close...

134
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,323
You think I went out of my way
to screw up my own investigation?

135
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,644
You think I'm
that big of an idiot?

136
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,229
You know what I think now?
I think you're smart,

137
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,480
but you want everybody else
to think that you're an idiot.

138
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,461
Okay, stop.

139
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,586
Cowan, I know I'm new here,
but as far as I can tell,

140
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,917
people who don't even know you,
think you're an asshole.

141
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,294
- And you?
- Ma'am.

142
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,303
You don't know me, but my first year
in the Academy, you gave a talk.

143
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,808
The "long game" you called it.
You talked about a moral compass.

144
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,060
About how you believed
in yours immutably.

145
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:34,238
And I thought to myself, "That guy.
One day, I want to be that guy."

146
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,404
And now... A pigeon?

147
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,723
Technically, it was a few pigeons,
but I hear what you're saying.

148
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,283
Okay. So here's what
I'm going to do.

149
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,365
You want to take a vacation day?
Go on your own? Fine.

150
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,748
But I'm not going to devote resources
to another snipe hunt.

151
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,956
I came to clean this mess up,
not add to it. I'm sorry.

152
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,509
Boss, thank you. I promise you,
it won't be a snipe hunt.

153
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,632
We're gonna get those Horsemen.

154
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,137
She's great.

155
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,387
The problem is when you're
two people at the same time,

156
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,996
one of them is bound
to trip the other.

157
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,229
And when that happens,
I will be there.

158
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,063
Duly noted.

159
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,087
- Oh. Hi!
- Who are you?

160
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,901
- What are you doing in my...
- It's actually a funny story.

161
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,507
How did you get into my apartment?
Whoa!

162
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,880
I think it's funny.
It's not like funny "ha ha."

163
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,087
Or you might not think
that it's funny "ha ha."

164
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,422
I think it's funny.
I guess it's all kind of relative.

165
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,428
I was actually...
No, that's not...

166
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,057
I made myself in the neighborhood
and now I'm here, and maybe...

167
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,065
Okay.

168
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,420
Seriously, how did you get in here?

169
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,811
Are you some kind of
crazed fan or something?

170
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,816
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, I recognize you.

171
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,070
You did that B-grade "geek magic" thing,
didn't you? You pulled a...

172
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,401
Pulled a hat out of the rabbit.

173
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,722
A hat out of the rabbit, that's right.

174
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,827
I know that it didn't work.

175
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,058
No, it was actually
kind of disgusting.

176
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,493
It was way worse for the rabbit.

177
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,997
Well, your drop was obvious
and your body shell is flimsy.

178
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,421
So if you wouldn't mind crawling out
from under my couch and...

179
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,715
Ta-da! Now I'm sitting
over here. Crazy!

180
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,469
By the way, that rabbit thing?
That was eight years ago, okay?

181
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,220
I've gotten so much
better since then.

182
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,642
- Have you?
- Yeah.

183
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,290
Okay, come here.
What is it that you want?

184
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,930
I wanted to meet you.
Everybody, really.

185
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,640
I want to be a part
of the Eye, okay?

186
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,396
I said it. I do.
And I want to use my magic for good,

187
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:39,150
like you and Merritt
and Jack especially.

188
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,231
Oh, that's right.
I know that Jack is alive.

189
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,636
I know that he
faked his own death.

190
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,527
I am a huge fan of faking deaths.
That was crazy!

191
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,158
What is this?
A trucker's hitch?

192
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,989
- Yeah.
- It's terrible.

193
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,165
- Embarrassing.
- Okay.

194
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,210
By the way, I am so sorry
that Henley left you.

195
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,083
- Ow! God!
- " Sorry.

196
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,757
That's actually a little better.
You know what I heard?

197
00:11:58,843 --> 00:11:59,958
- What?
- About Henley?

198
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,545
I heard that she got tired
of waiting around.

199
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,131
She lost faith
and so she asked for an out,

200
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,091
and the Eye gave it to her.

201
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,425
But who knows, right?

202
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,476
In matters of the heart,
so difficult to tell.

203
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,021
I mean, maybe she got sick of you.
You ever think about that?

204
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,438
Control issues?

205
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,337
Maybe you just didn't
tie her up tight enough. Ow!

206
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,726
Mmm.
Here's what's going to happen.

207
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,107
You're going to stay
here and stop talking,

208
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,654
and I'm going to
make a phone call,

209
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,073
and in about five minutes,
some people are going...

210
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,741
- It's all in the wrist.
- Uh-huh.

211
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,873
Let the momentum
of the card do the work for you.

212
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,079
Mmm-hmm.

213
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,959
This last one I call the Stall.

214
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,335
Not bad.

215
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,011
Now you want to see
a thing of beauty?

216
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,805
- I do indeed.
- Here you go.

217
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,098
And bingo bango bongo.

218
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,804
That's good. No, no, no,
it's good to be positive

219
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,418
despite making zero
progress in a year.

220
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,518
Yeah.

221
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,520
Whereas when it
comes to hypnotism,

222
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,023
the student has almost
become the master.

223
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,775
I like your confidence, but you might
say that you have the better teacher.

224
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:02,862
I like your confidence, but you might
say that you have the better teacher.

225
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,761
I like your confidence, but you might
say that you have the better teacher.

226
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,866
- Ooh!
- Yeah.

227
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,159
You're right.
You're right.

228
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,487
Your teacher definitely doesn't
know what he's doing.

229
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,492
By the way, was this
your card yesterday?

230
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,950
- In fact it was.
- I thought so.

231
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,580
That's not bad.

232
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,085
If I can hypnotize Danny
before you hit him with a card,

233
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,464
I get top bunk for a week.

234
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,466
Okay, that's a deal.

235
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,968
- Danny, what's up, man?
- Hey.

236
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,078
Stare at the palm of your hand
and as your eyes change focus,

237
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,433
you will begin to notice...

238
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,580
Everything, because
I'm not hypnotized.

239
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,642
It's not working.
Please don't become him.

240
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,394
I didn't know you guys did party tricks

241
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,212
when there weren't floozies around
to impress.

242
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,477
Uh, I think we stopped
trying to impress floozies

243
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,688
in, like, 1937.

244
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,819
Okay, somebody broke into my apartment,
all right?

245
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,650
Some amateur who knew
everything about me,

246
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,282
everything about Henley leaving,
and everything about us.

247
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,034
- That's her.
- Hey!

248
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,366
- Hi.
- You met Lula.

249
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,953
I've met her.
What is she doing here?

250
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:04,133
I'm the new Horseman!
I'm the girl Horseman.

251
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,708
Whoo!

252
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,884
Yeah!

253
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,506
Nobody. No excitement.
Jack? Anything?

254
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,557
Dylan, tell me
what's going on here.

255
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:17,228
Well, Lula's been on the underground
scene for the last decade,

256
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:18,931
and I think she
has some real talent,

257
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,016
and I'd like to try her on stage

258
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,226
- to balance out the duo.
- What?

259
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,652
No, are you serious, man?

260
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,759
After Henley left, you said I could
get back on stage again.

261
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,194
Not someone who just showed up.

262
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,116
I told you I'd think about it,
and I have,

263
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,473
and I really need you behind the scenes
with me for a little while longer.

264
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,725
Dylan, come on. I've been
behind the scenes my whole life.

265
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:38,492
Which is a crime, might I add.
Have you seen that man's face?

266
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:42,375
Much as I appreciate the addition
of some femininity to the group,

267
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,706
over and above what Atlas provides,

268
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,133
I think the real issue
is we've been in this...

269
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,552
Yeah, the issue is that
we have been rehearsing for months

270
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,301
for something...
We don't even know what it is.

271
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,827
And you're going to
keep working until...

272
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,871
Until we work as a single organism.
I know, I've heard you say that.

273
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,122
The thing is, when you say that,

274
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,638
I think what you're
referring to is us, not you.

275
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,099
Listen, I'm getting my orders
directly from the Eye.

276
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,649
Okay? And then I give them to you.

277
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,297
Now, if you don't like that,
you're welcome to go.

278
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,082
No, I'm not going anywhere. But I'm...
Mmm. I'm taking care of myself.

279
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,510
Guys, can I just
weigh in here really quickly?

280
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,053
Because I think I see
what's going on here.

281
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,910
You guys are this amazing,
tight-knit family unit.

282
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,328
- I'm a new person...
- We are anything but a family.

283
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:20,410
Okay, well, my mother literally
knifed my father in the neck one time.

284
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,523
So you are actually
a little bit like my family unit.

285
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,787
- Literally?
- But, yeah.

286
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,792
It was an accident, I think.

287
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,921
Okay. So, does this mean
we're actually going to do something?

288
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,093
Yes.

289
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,595
You've all heard of Octa
and their playboy CEO, Owen Case.

290
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,222
His partner, Walter Mabry,
died about a year ago.

291
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,082
You wanna know what all this
has been leading to?

292
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,141
Yeah.

293
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,599
Octa's hosting the launch
of the next-gen cell phone.

294
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,149
Once these phones
hit the streets,

295
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:48,069
they'll siphon their users'
information to the black market.

296
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:51,820
Meaning Octa's selling privacy
to up their profit.

297
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,822
So, the Eye has decided
to expose them for it.

298
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,994
Our mission
is to hijack the show.

299
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,743
Rehearsal's over, guys.

300
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,495
This is what we've
been waiting for.

301
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,042
Now it's time to get to work.

302
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,426
<i>Welcome, Octa insiders,</i>

303
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,129

00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,101
Thank you, sir.

309
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:32,656
Can't have you texting,
tweeting, recording, or eating.

310
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,404
Sorry, we will take very good
care of it for you.

311
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,157
Oh, by the way.

312
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,908
Security memo from Case himself.

313
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,458
Couple of surprise guests.
Just follow his lead, yeah?

314
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,455
We're all good.
I'm heading to the control room.

315
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,036
All right. Thanks, Jack.

316
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:51,500
- Atlas, go.
- No, Dylan, I can't...

317
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,954
- <i>What? What's the problem?</i>
<i>- No, there's too</i> many <i>people...</i>

318
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,300
Atlas, I got Owen landing now.

319
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,801
Okay, I'm going now.

320
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,508
- Stop.
- Oh.

321
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,385
- Okay.
- Thanks.

322
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,767
Pascal, we need you in the kitchen.

323
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,707
Look, the speech is about freedom, okay?

324
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,480
That's what we're trying
to sell here, is freedom.

325
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:27,940
Which part of that
do you not understand?

326
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,441
- I know, I'm sorry.
- For goodness sake!

327
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,082
Mr. Case, John from legal.
Just need your signature for release.

328
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,792
Thank you so much.

329
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,968
Just get it done
and get it back to me.

330
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,561
Hey there, buddy! Smile!

331
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,479
- Who are you? What the hell?
- Who am I?

332
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,898
It is picture day.
Did Julie not tell you it's picture day?

333
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,796
- Picture day? What are you...
- Company-wide policy.

334
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,631
- Look, I got a job to do.
- I have a job to do, too.

335
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:53,855
Hold on a second.
What is that?

336
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,008
I'm going to need some backup here.

337
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,218
Who are you calling?
Hey! That's my ID.

338
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,323
Security, my name is...

339
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,929
- Bo Walsh, thank you.
- Hey, I'm Bo Walsh!

340
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,318
Not this guy.
He's not Bo Walsh.

341
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,413
Calm down, please.

342
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,033
Hey! Hey, what's going on?

343
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,685
This guy just came and
put a flashlight in my eyes.

344
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,916
I'm trying to do my job.
This guy, check his badge.

345
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,683
- Who is this guy?
- I'm Bo Walsh, not him.

346
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,704
It says here,
"Evans Mental Facility.

347
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,276
- Mark D. Stooge."
- Hold on a second.

348
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,360
I've never seen
this before in my life.

349
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,590
I'm sorry, Mr. Walsh.

350
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:15,988
- Come on, Mr. Stooge.
- Hold on. He's not Mr. Walsh!

351
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,798
- Come on. Let's go.
- What's going on here?

352
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,629
I'm Bo Walsh, not him!

353
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:23,968
God, you cannot trust anybody
in this city anymore, can you?

354
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,861
Get off me!
Look, I want to make a phone call.

355
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,833
- I want to call my boss!
- Hey, hey! What's going on'?

356
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,814
I want to call my boss,
and this jackass...

357
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,837
Hey! Make your phone call.
That's your right, sir.

358
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,068
That's my right.

359
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,987
- What the hell?
- You're crazy. Let's go.

360
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,689
This isn't my...
Where's my phone?

361
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,490
Where's my phone?

362
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,318
Atlas, Stooge has left
the building.

363
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,652
Okay.

364
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,409
The circuit board is ours.
I am leaving backstage.

365
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,126
<i>Ladies</i> and <i>gentlemen,</i> Owen <i>Case.</i>

366
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,795
All right. Lula, show these guys
what you're made of.

367
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,555
I can take over from here.
Clark says you're on break.

368
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,928
What break? Who's Clark?

369
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,634
"Who's Clark?" That's funny.

370
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,060
Imagine if I told Roger that,
he'd freak out.

371
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,058
- Don't do that!
- What?

372
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,480
Who the hell is Roger?

373
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,557
Does Lisa know that
you don't know Roger?

374
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:12,648
Does Lisa know that
you don't know Roger?

375
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,062
Does Lisa know that
you don't know Roger?

376
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,504
- I don't know who Lisa is.
- Are you kidding again?

377
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,548
- You don't know who Lisa is now?
- No, I don't. Just get away.

378
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,734
- That is a dangerous...
- You're ruining the meat.

379
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,360
Don't make me have to go to Brian!

380
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,012
- I don't know who Brian is!
- Why are you acting like this?

381
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,556
- I'll go straight to him.
- Give me...

382
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,454
Oh, my God!

383
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,826
<i>What are you doing to me?</i>

384
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,294
- Help me!
- ' Help her. Go!

385
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,173
Have some water.

386
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,967
I feel from your face
you're freaked by the flow of blood,

387
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,670
which is fully fixable in a snap

388
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:45,257
by focusing and following
the flow of my words

389
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,638
as you're flowing and floating,

390
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,641
which is why you're focusing
on my commands.

391
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,096
You got this far in life

392
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,808
by listening to one voice,
the voice in your head.

393
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,768
This is that voice.

394
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,654
Look at the light.

395
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,574
Listen to your own voice.

396
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,415
Oh, my God.

397
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,128
Wow. What is that?
Is that a miracle towel?

398
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,876
Thank you so much.
Do you know what?

399
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:21,380
You have taught me that I'm not
cut out for this kind of work.

400
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,086
I quit!

401
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,887
Get another towel.

402
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,306
Thank you, and goodbye.

403
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,350
Oh, God.

404
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,729
Welcome everybody!

405
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,729
And now, the moment
that you've all been waiting for...

406
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,902
- Nice work, lady.
- Thanks.

407
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:43,027
Revolutionized music with Octa 2.

408
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,694
I'm actually nervous,
and I'm not even going onstage.

409
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,995
You know, I've heard
that if you're nervous,

410
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,074
it can be really helpful
to picture each other naked.

411
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,910
It's actually picture
the audience naked.

412
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,665
No, this is new.
This is a new science.

413
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,087
So, I don't know.

414
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:01,337
- Do you want... We should try it.
- Not the right mood.

415
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,043
Guess that leaves
you and me, old buddy.

416
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,925
What? Picture each other...
No. No, thank you.

417
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,966
I mean, I admit,
from the neck up there are issues.

418
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,142
But from the neck down, the David.

419
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,685
Owen Case.

420
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,064
Good morning, Octa-lites.

421
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,142
Good morning, Octa-lites.

422
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,686
Now, I've made the claim...

423
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,523
<i>Now, I've made the claim
that Octa 8 is pure magic.</i>

424
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,609
But the truth is, that's just
one of those things I say...

425
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:31,116
<i>You know, the truth is,
that's just one of those things I say...</i>

426
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,448
when in fact
I mean something else.

427
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:37,706
<i>When in fact
I mean something else.</i>

428
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,083
What else do I mean?

429
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:45,419
<i>Well, here to fill you in on some of my
fabulous lies and hypocrisy,</i>

430
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:49,472
<i>and to perform some of the most dazzling
feats of magic you have ever seen...</i>

431
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,141
<i>- They are the world's...
- greatest magicians.</i>

432
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,970
<i>Here to expose me
for the fraud I truly am.</i>

433
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:59,399
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
here are the Horsemen.</i>

434
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,990
Hello, New York!

435
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,991
Thank you so much.

436
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,827
Hey, it's great to be back.

437
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:22,209
And have you met
our newest Horseman, Lula?

438
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:29,261
- Feels good, right?
- Pretty good. Pretty good.

439
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,466
Thank you, thank you. Um, okay.

440
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,302
We want to talk to you
about your privacy.

441
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:37,387
What does your privacy mean to you?

442
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,223
Because apparently to Owen Case,
it means absolutely nothing.

443
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,775
No, actually it means less
than absolutely nothing.

444
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,900
You see, he's mocked your privacy.
He's scorned it.

445
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,030
Right, and we're not just talking about
the things that you already agreed to

446
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,283
when you signed,
probably without reading

447
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,533
the terms and conditions
of Octas 1 through 7.

448
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,127
Dylan, the FBI is here.

449
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,500
All right. Don't worry about it.

450
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,582
All right, go to plan C-4.

451
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,718
Lock the doors.

452
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,386
Hey, boss, I'm glad you're here.

453
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,883
Don't.

454
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,050
Guys, look. We got to move
around, get in through the back.

455
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,430
These Horsemen are tricky, okay?

456
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,603
They got backup plans
on top of backup plans.

457
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,727
Hey, sorry, don't mean to gloat,
but I told you so.

458
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,978
Cut the bullshit, Rhodes.

459
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,230
We got an anonymous
phone call an hour ago.

460
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,982
Confirms everything
I've been telling her.

461
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,133
What are you talking about?

462
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,551
You sent agents
to Detroit and Philadelphia.

463
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,816
You've been crying wolf
so we wouldn't send them here.

464
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,528
- Boss, please.
- Keep working on the doors.

465
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:38,536
Please tell me that you haven't bought
into Cowan's crazy, paranoid fantasia.

466
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,208
Before we start the show...

467
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:44,003
We had Owen agree to a few terms
and conditions of our own.

468
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,081
So, everything that he had
once considered private...

469
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,712
That he thinks is really private...

470
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:55,764
Yeah, everything that he once
considered private is now...

471
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,182
Oh, my.

472
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,980
<i>As the Horsemen like to say,
magic is about controlling perception.</i>

473
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:10,109
<i>You see them as champions of the truth,
but are they?</i>

474
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:13,112
<i>Or is that just another
one of their illusions?</i>

475
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,739
- What's going on, Rhodes?
- This is crazy.

476
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,349
We got to get everyone
to the other exits.

477
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,956
- Let's go, to the back.
- No. You stay here.

478
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,249
<i>So, since they clearly
love secrets...</i>

479
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,828
<i>Let's reveal some of theirs.</i>

480
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,629
Danny, everyone, get off the stage.

481
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,752
Abort.

482
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,504
Jack, go with them.
I'll see you at the meet-up point.

483
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,595
Let's go.

484
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,796
<i>Do you recall the death of Jack Wilder?</i>

485
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:40,306
<i>What if I told you he's not just alive,
but he's actually right here.</i>

486
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,148
<i>And do you know who else is here?
The FBI.</i>

487
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,446
<i>Let's let them in, shall we?</i>

488
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,650
<i>And now, for the big reveal.</i>

489
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,406
Go! Go! To the stage.

490
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,534
<i>There's a fifth Horseman,</i>

491
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,412
<i>and he's the biggest
criminal of them all.</i>

492
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,119
<i>FBI agent, Dylan Rhodes.</i>

493
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:09,376
- I knew it.
- What?

494
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,564
This is so much deeper
than you know, boss.

495
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,823
You think you're looking at one thing,
but you have no idea.

496
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,259
- Who are you?
- The same man I've always been.

497
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,090
Boys, I'm sorry.

498
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,483
You gotta be kidding me.

499
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,610
We've gotta get to the chute. Go!

500
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,439
- Who are those guys?
- Who cares? Come on!

501
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,694
' Hurry. hurry!
- Keep going!

502
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,845
How the hell could this happen?

503
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,596
I thought Dylan
had everything under control.

504
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,406
Yeah. Apparently he didn't.

505
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,535
Maybe you're the leak, Dan.
Where you been sneaking off to?

506
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,186
Don't you dare for a second
insinuate that I had...

507
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,578
- I'm not insinuating. That's your...
- Let's get to the truck, come on!

508
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,834
- Stay together!
- Move! Move!

509
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:51,959
Lula, come on!

510
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,962
Coming! Whoa!

511
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,011
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

512
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:06,267
<i>Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep.</i>

513
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,240
What the hell is going on?

514
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,807
- Wasn't there supposed to be a truck?
- Where the hell are we?

515
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,113
Come on!

516
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,074
Hey, hey!
Wait, did you mis-run the tube?

517
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,784
No, I put it in the truck.
I know I did!

518
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:29,481
Because we're really
not in the truck right now.

519
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:30,836
Somebody must
have moved the tube.

520
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,442
Were we above a Chinese restaurant?
Give me that!

521
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,506
- I'm moving! Relax!
- There's something very wrong.

522
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,594
Okay. Why are we here?

523
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,638
Why am I frickin' starving?

524
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,841
Yeah, I'm weirdly starving, too.

525
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,177
This makes no sense.

526
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,501
Okay, sorry.

527
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,165
At least, and I know this
isn't much consolation,

528
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,967
but apparently
we're now surrounded by Chinese food.

529
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,294
<i>'</i> Right?
<i>'</i> Guys...

530
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:23,973
I think where we are right now, they
don't refer to it as "Chinese food."

531
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,767
It's just called "food."

532
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,732
Wait, what are you saying?
How is this possible?

533
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:41,574
I believe in your particular parlance,
the word is "magic."

534
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,152
That guy looks exactly like you.

535
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:47,284
He looks exactly like you.
Are you seeing this right now?

536
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,489
Chase.

537
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:52,543
Must confess, it's like what I heard
about meeting the Rolling Stones.

538
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,540
They're a lot shorter in person.

539
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,464
Remember I told you about the guy
who screwed me out of everything?

540
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:00,839
This is my twin brother, Chase.

541
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,720
Wait, did you do this?

542
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:08,847
As you can see,
my boss don't mess around.

543
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,599
I do not understand what is
going on right now. At all.

544
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,772
Okay, let me break it
down for you.

545
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:17,853
You jumped off a rooftop in New York
and you landed in Macau.

546
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,484
AKA the Vegas of China.

547
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,862
And presto-changeo.

548
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,113
Don't you just love it?

549
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,286
The "greatest magicians in the world"

550
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,830
are the object
of someone else's magic trick?

551
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,079
Isn't that poetic?

552
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:37,747
No? You know what,
I'm not gonna let you guys yuck my yum.

553
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,252
Shoo-shoo. Or mu-shu. Whatever.

554
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:39,339
Shoo-shoo. Or mu-shu. Whatever.

555
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,583
Shoo-shoo. Or mu-shu. Whatever.

556
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:46,347
Oh, and you know what they say,
"What happens in Macau..."

557
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,676
Uh, well, I don't know the rest of it,
'cause it's in Chinese, uh...

558
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,477

<i>The trick was on them, however,</i>

562

Hey, seriously, where are you guys?

568
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,337
I'm at the meetup.
I've been leaving you messages.

569
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,693
I haven't heard from anyone.
Please, call me!

Hey, tell me you're safe.
Where are you?

00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:53,164
Right where you left me,
18 months ago, Agent Rhodes.

574
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,411
Thaddeus?

575

<i>How does it feel
to lose everything?</i>

576
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:00,375
Your job. Your identity.
Your reason for living.

577
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,583
How does it feel to be out of control,
perhaps for the first time?

578
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,177
What do you want?

579
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:10,256
You're a fool, Agent Rhodes.
You always have been.

580
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,350
- Where are they?
- I'm not telling you on the phone!

581
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:14,437
Where are they?

582
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:18,515
And if you're wondering if I was behind
the Horsemen's recent debacle,

583
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,349
I'll let you work
that out for yourself.

584
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:23,436
Hey, I burned you once, I'll burn
you again. I'm not playing, Thaddeus.

585
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,192
It's not my game,
Agent Rhodes. It's yours.

586
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,741
You started it when
you locked me in a cell.

587
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,534
<i>This is simply my move.</i>

588

00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,248
No!

590
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,622

591
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:43,923

00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,023
It's all about blind spots.

594
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:10,950
When you're staring straight
at something, and not see it. Why?

595
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,410
Blind spots.

596
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,704
We learned that together,
didn't we, bro?

597
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:18,624
Did he tell you that
we were partners once?

598
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,873
No? I didn't think so.

Cool.

603
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:38,561
And then, one day, we were 12
and Virginia von Welsheim

604
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,514
had a very nice party
down the street.

605
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,895
I had a little tum-tum, couldn't go.

606
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:49,526
Mer-Bear did it on his own, and got
a taste of the solo thing, and uh...

607
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,193
- and kicked me to the curb.
- Oh, God.

608
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:58,747
Chase, you win! I concede.
Just tell me how you did it.

609
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:05,001
Delivery guy came to your door
about a month ago, little za.

610
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,173
Za?

611
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:09,171
Pizza, huh?

612
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:13,596
- Is this apartment d3375?
- Not even close.

613
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,180
Sleep!

614
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:22,851
Relaxing, floating,
drifting, dreaming...

615
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,932
Falling.

616
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,609
So, what he did,
my little womb-mate,

617
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:31,610
is he downloaded all
your private information,

618
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,863
and my employer
had all he needed.

619
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,318
Thanks.

620
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:39,201
How did you know how to find him?

621
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:42,454
- That's a very good question, Atlas.
- Okay.

622
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:03,512
Just follow the guards.
They'll take you to my boss.

623
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:10,686
Been fun playing this cat-and-mouse
with you, broski.

624
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,612
Meow.

625
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,742
Have fun at the Sands.

626
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:23,370
- I am so, so, so sorry.
- Yeah, you should be.

627
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,623
Don't ever accuse me
of betraying us again, okay?

628
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,767
Do you guys ever think that
the Eye is watching this?

629
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,311
You know, that maybe this
is even what they want?

630
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,023
And at the exact right moment,

631
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,350
they're gonna swoop in,
and we'll be like,

632
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,277
"Yes! Thank God you're here!

633
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,822
Thank God!
Just in the nick of time, Eye!"

634
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:58,902
And then we'll just celebrate,
and it was all worth it in the end?

635
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,161
I don't even really
think that, either, so...

636
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:07,163
It's cool.

637
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:22,599
Ah.

638
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:24,562
Ta-da!

639
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,271
So happy to be working with you.

640
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:29,974
Please, come in. Come in.

641
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:30,648
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

642
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:30,732
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

643
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,191
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

644
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,673
Wait, sorry, how are you
working with us?

645
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:36,610
Oh, well, as much as a magician
who pulls a rabbit from a hat

646
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,533
is working with that rabbit.

647
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:43,157
We'll be working together. Yes.
Allow me to introduce myself.

648
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,740
Yeah, you're Walter Mabry.
You died a year ago.

649
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,700
Yes. An idea I got
from you, Mr. Wilder.

650
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,705
Fake your death,
the world puts its guard down.

651
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,787
I'm able to control
quite a few companies,

652
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,371
including my old partner, Owen's,

653
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,584
as a consortium of so-called
anonymous shareholders.

654
00:34:56,678 --> 00:35:00,387
- And that violates how many SEC laws?
- I believe it breaks all of them.

655
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,838
All of them.

656
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,800
You see, you all want an audience.

657
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:08,307
Need one, desperately.
It's quite sad, really.

658
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:10,480
Hence, my ability to nab you.

659
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:13,355
I, on the other hand,
want the opposite of that.

660
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:17,814
I just want to be, and I am
100 percent off the grid.

661
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,193
You know why?

662
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,776
Yeah, because the grid
is for actual human beings.

663
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,202
No, because in a world
of total surveillance,

664
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,407
the only true freedom
lies in not being seen.

665
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,741
You can't control the grid
from within the grid.

666
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,702
- Follow me.
- Yeah.

667
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,582
- Follow me.
- Okay. All right.

668
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,960
You pulled a hat out of a rabbit.
That was very colorful.

669
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:39,544
Almost eight and a half years ago.
So, no need to bring that up.

670
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:42,255
We can't all be held accountable
for our adolescent personas.

671
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,465
Can we, Magicolio?

672
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,891
Magicolio, that was 15 years ago.

673
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,844
Don't get me wrong, I love magic.

674
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,138
Like you, and many others who,

675
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,228
I suppose, were not getting any sex
in high school, I dabbled with it.

676
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:58,688
But, uh, unlike you, I was able to
transition upward towards actual magic.

677
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,898
Science, you may
have heard it called.

678
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:07,788
So, would you like to know,
my friends, just how I got you here?

679
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,205
We know how you did it.

680
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,292
No, you don't.

681
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:13,097
Yeah, you stole our files for the show,
then obviously hypnotized us.

682
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,582
Stop. No. Seriously, stop.

683
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,005
The strobe was a combo
of binaural beats, as well as...

684
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,424
I said stop!

685
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:22,003
You might not be having fun,
but I am.

686
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:25,218
You have an unusual way of showing it.

687
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:26,892
So...

688
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,518
How did I do it?

689
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:34,144
Easy. You see, magicians like to control
other people's perceptions.

690
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,586
In your heightened state of agitation,

691
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,942
<i>you saw the simplest cues.
Black tube, roof.</i>

692
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,441
<i>And your minds filled in the rest.</i>

693
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,365
<i>But the tube you meant to go down
was 20 feet to your right.</i>

694
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,513
Go on, sit down. There's no one
standing in your way.

695
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,993
Don't mind if I do.

696
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,035
Anyway, once in the tube,
yes, you're right...

697
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:54,915
<i>Blah, blah, blah, the strobe contained
UV letters pulsing the word "sleep."</i>

698
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:00,795
<i>And that, combined with the sound,
put you into an instant alpha pattern.</i>

699
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,673
<i>Sleep, sleep, sleep.</i>

700
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,424
And from then on,
it really was just fun.

701
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:08,883
And I can assure you,
you don't know what happened.

702
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:16,598
That's really creepy.
Really, really creepy.

703
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,690
That's not cool.

704
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,896
Yep, easy stuff, magic,

705
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,023
if you put your mind to it.

706
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,118
All right, that's enough.
So why are we here, then?

707
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,870
Besides you getting to show off
how adorably clever you are.

708
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,744
Well, to start with,
the man you stole from last year,

709
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,634
turns out I had invested quite a lot
of money in some of his companies,

710
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,879
so a lot of what you
stole was, in fact, mine.

711
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,707
Good news is, it's very easy for you
to pay me back.

712
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,509
I just need your skills.

713
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,463
Owen and I were like the Beatles,
if the Beatles had been...

714
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:48,592
Elfin?

715
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,014
Geniuses.

716
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,717
Pretty sure the Beatles were geniuses.

717
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,098
And like them, we had a dream.

718
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,690
Could we create actual, genuine magic?

719
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:02,145
And I'm guessing one of you achieved
that dream, and it wasn't you?

720
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:05,356
That is what he
would like you to think.

721
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:10,536
My vision was a perfect blend
of elegance and technology.

722
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,954
But Owen wanted it for himself
so he humiliated me

723
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:16,204
by exposing my private files
to the board of directors

724
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,772
and convinced them
that I am unstable.

725
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,958
Did you take a picture of him
while he was sleeping?

726
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,442
He had me kicked out of
my own company,

727
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,833
and now he goes around
taking credit for a chip

728
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,668
that's not just the key to one computer,

729
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:28,754
but every computer
system on the planet.

730
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,931
It can un-encrypt anything,
crack the defense firewall,

731
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,760
manipulate markets,
and spy on anyone.

732
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,654
And now it's being sold
to the highest bidder.

733
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,375
If you're so rich,
why don't you just buy it'?

734
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,810
So he gets the money?

735
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,063
And the pleasure? No.

736
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,396
No, no, no. Besides, why would I buy it
when I could have you steal it for me?

737
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,651
Oh!

738
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,719
It's being previewed tomorrow
to the various suitors,

739
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:52,407
which will include your targets,
a crew lead by a South African gangster.

740
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,953
South African gangster.

741
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,810
Yes. How your team
gets past security, that's up to you.

742
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:59,077
But once you do, you just need
to inspect it and steal it.

743
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,170
That's it?

744
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,041
Come on, this is
perfect for you, isn't it?

745
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,275
You're magicians and thieves.

746
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,882
What makes you think we would even
consider doing this?

747
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:09,303
Um, Oh, wait, I had a reason.
What was it? Oh, yes.

748
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,033
You see, back home,
you're wanted criminals.

749
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,300
But here, I control the police,
the casinos, the media.

750
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:17,603
I can give you a new life,
out of hiding.

751
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:21,064
And if you don't,
I'll have you killed.

752
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,728
You know what?
I'm not stealing a thing for you.

753
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:29,907
- Not unless Dylan tells me it's okay.
- Really? Dylan is where, exactly?

754
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,860
It doesn't matter. Yeah, I'm with him.
So you can go ahead and kill us

755
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,994
because I'm not gonna
steal anything for you either.

756
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,623
Strikes <i>me</i> that a consensus
<i>seems</i> to <i>be</i> forming, Walter,

757
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,246
and we're calling your bluff.

758
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,000
- Actually, we'll do it.
- What?

759
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,832
We're in Macau. The oldest
magic store in the world is here.

760
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:50,260
We'll get the supplies
we need, and we'll do it.

761
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,796
Thank you.

762
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,347
It should be fun.

763
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:57,426
Chase will take you
to the magic shop in the morning.

764
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:03,567
Badge.

765
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,441
Really?

766
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:11,940
Thanks.

767
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:16,495
Agent Cowan. Your ID.

768
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:17,992
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

769
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,544
It appears Mr. Bradley's
still at dinner.

770
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:27,339
Yeah? Tell him recess is over.

771
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,266
What?

772
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,783
All right, so I made my move.

773
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,032
Where are they?
I don't have time for bullshit.

774
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,614
Oh, I have all the time
in the world, thanks to you.

775
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:04,121
And I didn't get to finish my lobster,
which makes me very grumpy.

776
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,954
Okay, let's cut the crap.
What do you want?

777
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:10,211
You can dispense with
the tough guy act to begin with.

778
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,838
You're too desperate
for it to be believable.

779
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,556
I said, what do you want?

780
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:21,226
You used a form 219 warrant
to search my room.

781
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,974
You found a connection
between me and the Four Horsemen.

782
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:29,185
Which means you can take me
out of here on a 24-hour leave.

783
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:33,488
- You want me to break you out?
- I want you to take me out.

784
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,111
All you need is an extradition order,

785
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,910
which you'll find in
that tray by my printer.

786
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:45,159
Dylan, I had nothing to do
with the Horsemen's disappearance.

787
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,711
You were lured into a trap.

788
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,835
And like Dorothy did
when she landed in Oz,

789
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:57,137
you're beginning to realize
that the only way out is through.

790
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:00,215
And I'm the only one
who can get you there.

791
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:02,509
You got this place wired.

792
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:06,722
You don't need me to get out of here.
This is all about payback.

793
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:10,605
- I believe in an eye for an eye.
- So you're out to destroy me'?

794
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:11,856
Oh, absolutely.

795
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,257
You think I'm still gonna
play your little game?

796
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:14,942
I know you will.

797
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:19,027
Because no matter how hard you try
to find a culprit behind all this,

798
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,487
you're going to blame only yourself.

799
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:26,041
When your little vendetta ended with you
putting me in jail 18 months ago,

800
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:29,995
you got tired, you got sloppy.
You stopped paying attention.

801
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,126
And that's where you lost.

802
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:38,796
So, you can save yourself,

803
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:45,018
or you can make a deal with me,
and save the Four Horsemen,

804
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,392
and stop wasting both of our time.

805
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:55,984
Steal something for this narcissistic
little man boy? I don't like it.

806
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,190
But what I like <i>less</i>
is you deciding for us.

807
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,888
Yeah? Do you like that we're the
laughing stocks of the magic world,

808
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,744
and the fugitives
of the actual world?

809
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,537
Walter is right.
We have nowhere to go.

810
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:05,864
But we can fix that.

811
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,164
- We can fix it?
- Yeah.

812
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,812
So you're officially
part of the team now?

813
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,622
- Excuse me?
- I'm sure this is what Dylan

814
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,858
meant when he said we should
all work as a single organism.

815
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:16,125
Yeah, that is a fairytale
that Dylan tells himself, and tells us.

816
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:18,836
Look, even if we get this stick,
he'll never let us go.

817
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:23,015
We can't trust Walter, okay?
The Eye has a history in Macau.

818
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,495
They're the only ones we can trust.

819
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:25,579
Now, if we can get it to them,

820
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,890
they can clear our names
and get us the hell out of here.

821
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,470
It's a bad plan, man.

822
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,067
Hey.

823
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,444
Hi, how are you?

824
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,492
Um, we need some
things custom-made.

825
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,223
Actually, by tomorrow.
We're kind of in a rush.

826
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:45,908
And...

827
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:48,205
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

828
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:57,416
Welcome to long's.
My name's Li. Not Bruce Lee.

829
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,750
- What?
- Got you.

830
00:43:58,845 --> 00:43:59,880
- Okay.
- Look.

831
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:02,931
Where'd it go?

832
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,346
Oh! And now it's by my head. How fun.

833
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,972
- $20.
- $20?

834
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,929
No, thank you.
We're kind of in a rush.

835
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,264
- $10.
- Uh, no.

836
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,645
- Two for one.
- No.

837
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,338
Okay, all right.
Just give us the thumbs. Yeah?

838
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,603
Okay. Thanks a lot, Jack.
Please take these.

839
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:21,315
So, we need a Keplinger holdout,

840
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:25,403
and we also need roughing fluid,
a Sanada gimmick, sleeves, tracks.

841
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,407
This is all in plastic,
though, if you can.

842
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,003
What?

843
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:36,746
Is there a problem?

844
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:40,004
My grandmother wants to know
why plastic? Plastic is cheap.

845
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,335
Sorry. Yeah, we need plastic
because we're...

846
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:46,014
We're going through a very sensitive
metal detector, okay?

847
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,808
So plastic, nothing. Metal...

848
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,929
It detects.

849
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,521
What did she say?

850
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:01,947
She said just because you're
talking slowly and moving your hands

851
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,024
doesn't mean she can suddenly
understand English.

852
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,860
Oh, yeah. So sorry. He's racist.

853
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:11,164
Hey, bro. Listen, I know
that the only thing that we agree on

854
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,833
is that our mom and dad
had one too many children.

855
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,209
So why don't we just let
the kids play with their toys

856
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:19,755
and go get a little drinkey-poo?

857
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:25,178
- If it's free, it's me.
- Great. Guys, we'll be right back.

858
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,882
Okay, kiddies,
the chaperones are watching you.

859
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,217
Don't do anything I wouldn't enjoy.

860
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:34,350
Okay. Have fun, you two.

861
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:40,147
Hey. Can I use your phone?
It's kind of important.

862
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:41,603
Sure.

863
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,064
- On the house.
- Thanks.

864
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:46,824
Who are you calling?

865
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,367
I'm arranging
to hand over the stick.

866
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,195
So that's how we've been
contacting the Eye?

867
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,569
You've been doing it
on your own?

868
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:52,739
Maybe.

869
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:55,245
Oh, God.
Dylan's not gonna like this.

870
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,416
I'm not really concerned
with what Dylan likes. Okay?

871
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,703
I'm doing this for us.

872
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:04,626
- What is wrong with this thing?
- Hey, relax, it's just a kid's toy.

873
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,051
Yeah, that's what I thought.

874
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,469
- Okay. Let me just...
- Ow!

875
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,923
Sorry, sorry. Jesus.

876
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:14,390
Hey, can you get this?

877
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:20,942
It's like birth, you know.

878
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:24,487
One person enters the hospital,
two people come out.

879
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,984
Walk and talk.

880
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:28,407
I'll tell you on the plane.

881
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,576
What plane?

882
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:33,621
My sources tell me
your Horsemen are in Macau.

883
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,658
- What's the look?
- It's none of your business.

884
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:37,958
Who are your sources?

885
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,713
Just some old friends.

886
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:52,549
When we have the card, where do I go?

887
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,010
And 0 for 52.

888
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:58,142
Well, it's perfect.
It's a perfect score.

889
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,066
Then what about girls?

890
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:03,985
Like, relationships?

891
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,186
What?

892
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:12,614
Look, it's not
something I'm proud of,

893
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:18,747
but every girl I get close to,
I end up taking their trust.

894
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,328
And then their wallet.

895
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,037
So...

896
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,046
- You take their wallets?
- Yeah.

897
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,380
You ever take their belts?

898
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:38,266
Or how about some peanuts
from the hotel bar?

899
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:41,314
Not sure why you took those.

900
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,483
I'm sorry, did you think
that I was like those other girls?

901
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,816
Oh, Jack.

902
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,741
Okay. So there's a marketplace
down the street.

903
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,947
And I'm meeting
a man with a blue hat.

904
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,750
He'll get the stick to the right people
and get us home.

905
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,873
You go grab Merritt, okay?
We got a lot to do.

906
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,670
And, hey, put your belt on.

907
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:07,419
Oh, no, it's not...
She took it off me and...

908
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:11,510
You know, the most
heartbreaking moment of my life

909
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:16,307
was when I discovered that you had
stolen all my money and split.

910
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,476
I didn't realize until now

911
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,020
how much of that money
you put into your face.

912
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:25,692
Seriously, is it weird to have more hair
in your nose than on your head?

913
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:28,315
Speaking of, next time
you get a hair transplant,

914
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:34,027
you might wanna consider requesting
something other than old man pubes.

915
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:38,159
You know what?
You are such a buffoon, Mer-Bear.

916
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,160
And this little ploy you have

917
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:44,336
of stalling me while your friends
screw over my employer?

918
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:46,038
Not gonna work.

919
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:52,636
Chase! As you stare into my eyes,
you will find that you wanna sleep.

920
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,338
When you wake, you will beg
for Merritt's forgiveness

921
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:58,596
and realize that you will never be
half the man that he is.

922
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:07,313
Merritt, I am so,
so very, very sorry

923
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:10,111
about how pathetic your pupil is.

924
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:13,360
Hey, a little hint
on your technique of surprise.

925
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:17,740
It lacks that all-essential
little element of surprise.

926
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:22,624
Hey, this has been fun, Mer-Bear.
Let's do it again sometime.

927
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:31,003
Well, I've had ample time
to do some research, and you know,

928
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,128
I was wrong.

929
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:35,803
I think the Eye
might actually be real.

930
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,346
Thought you didn't
buy into all that.

931
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:39,424
I'd be lying if I
said I didn't think

932
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:42,852
that this road would lead to
the great wizard behind the curtain

933
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,475
and, in the end,
I might get to see his face.

934
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:46,772
That ain't gonna happen.

935
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:48,462
Even if the fate of
the Horsemen depends on it'?

936
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:51,214
Listen to me. I broke you out of there.
We're not changing the terms now.

937
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,946
- You put me there!
- Yeah, because you deserve to be there.

938
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:57,571
- Listen, I did not kill your father.
- What?

939
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,574
All right, all right,
let's just cut the bullshit.

940
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,248
I know who you are, Shrike.

941
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,577
I know you blame me
for your father's death.

942
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:11,630
I know you think I goaded him into
performing a trick he couldn't pull off.

943
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:16,553
I know the time in jail was a result
of a 30-year revenge plot against me.

944
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:18,846
Supposing that's all true,
you think I'd tell you now?

945
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,094
Man...

946
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,468
Thirty years.

947
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:29,148
Thirty years, and the greatest long game
magic trick ever created.

948
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:33,024
Just to put me behind bars. Okay.

949
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:36,481
So how did it feel, seeing me there?

950
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,276
Was it all you hoped?

951
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,847
I don't know what you're talking about.

952
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:44,956
You're lying.
It was an empty experience.

953
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,079
And you wanna know how I know?

954
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,878
I know because you know.

955
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:56,801
There's always, always more
than what's on the surface.

956
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,324
So what, the past didn't happen,
and you're not who I think you are?

957
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:00,534
Now, don't tell me in 30 years

958
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,391
that's the first time you've
asked yourself that question.

959
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,395
I am not my father.
You're not getting in my head, okay?

960
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,973
You think you're luring me into a trap?
You're not.

961
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,684
Now, I am desperate,
which means I'm dangerous.

962
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:16,237
My only concern is the health
and well-being of the Horsemen.

963
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,782
And you're gonna lead me to them.
And if you don't, I promise you,

964
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:23,736
you're gonna end up far worse
than in some cushy jail cell somewhere.

965
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:40,761
What if the Horsemen
don't actually need you to save them?

966
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:48,099
All right. So the lab
is made up of two distinct layers,

967
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:51,226
the security perimeter
and the clean room.

968
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:53,317
The stick we're looking for
should be in this core.

969
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:55,439
So we're gonna have to
get underneath, extract it,

970
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,236
and replace it with a decoy.

971
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:58,717
Now, we're about to get to the chip.

972
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:00,385
This is the thing
about the chip, it's very thin.

973
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:03,276
Luckily, it's similar
in weight and size to a playing card,

974
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,330
so we're gonna have to
brush up on our card-istry.

975
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:08,368
Whoa, whoa!

976
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:13,957
That's no good.

977
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,681
So how do we get in?
Hannes Pike.

978
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:27,554
He's the son of
a South African gangster.

979
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:29,306
<i>He's RSVP'd with what looks like</i>

980
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,353
<i>a couple of members
of his security detail.</i>

981
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,432
<i>A doctor, to vet it, I guess,
and somebody named Buffy.</i>

982
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:38,190
<i>Yeah, apparently, he travels
with a different bimbo every week. Hmm.</i>

983
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,897
I wonder which one of us
gets to play the bimbo.

984
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,366
Hey, can I get in?

985
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,623
At the soothing sound of the slots

986
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:58,081
you slip into a serene state
of slumber and sleep.

987
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,129
<i>Jack, for</i> a <i>moment,</i>

988
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,427
<i>they will think you're Hannes,
so lead them out and keep them busy.</i>

989
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:03,919
<i>They will think you're Hannes,
so lead them out and keep them busy.</i>

990
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,176
You trust your people implicitly.

991
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,303
You will have them
take care of everything,

992
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:09,805
and you will wait in the car.

993
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:13,433
And eyes open, wide awake. Go.

994
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,310
Excuse me.
These people are following me.

995
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:16,801
You might wanna
check their pockets.

996
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,026
<i>Then our time is
ticking to infiltrate the lab</i>

997
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:25,261
<i>and get the card to the market,
where I'll hand it off to the Eye,</i>

998
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,775
<i>so we can all get the hell home.</i>

999
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:49,091
Hannes, my old friend.
So glad you could make it.

1000
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:52,267
I knew you had a soft spot
for an old-school bidding war.

1001
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,435
How have you been?

1002
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:57,140
I trust my people implicitly.
What they say goes.

1003
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,317
Certainly. But I'm sure
you'd like to see it for yourself.

1004
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:03,192
Hold it in your hands,
check the build quality.

1005
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:08,200
Or not. Also fine.

1006
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:10,278
Well, if you'd like to follow me.

1007
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:18,207
You'll have to remove all your metal.
Watches, rings, etc.

1008
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:20,629
- Yeah, of course.
- Excuse me for asking...

1009
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:22,548
Where might I have seen you before?

1010
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:26,298
I don't know, probably
one of my many symposiums.

1011
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,469
The book jacket!

1012
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:30,389
I have to say, Dr. Michaelakis,
I'm a huge fan.

1013
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:32,308
Oh, thank you so much.

1014
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,886
Uh, which book?
There have been so many...

1015
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,765
Does Hannes' chippy
always talk for you, Doctor?

1016
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:41,611
Doctor?

1017
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:48,073
Sorry, when you say "chippy,"
you are referring to Buffy here, yeah?

1018
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,321
Of course.

1019
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:55,620
Hannes prefers the term "floozy"
for all his boy toys.

1020
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:58,747
- Yeah. He does. That's good.
- Noted.

1021
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,874
By the way,
I got your email, Dr. Michaelakis.

1022
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,454
You had a query about our ability

1023
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,631
to maintain quantum coherence
at room temperature

1024
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:09,258
without the use of dilution,
refrigerators, or error correction.

1025
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:10,964
Do you care to elucidate?

1026
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,389
- Right.
- Yeah.

1027
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:14,433
Yes, I did send that email.

1028
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,478
- The other day, I saw you.
- I did, I sent it. So what gives?

1029
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:18,975
I'm sorry, what gives...

1030
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:20,602
I think what she's trying to say...

1031
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,712
Actually, the grown-ups
are having a meeting, Buffy.

1032
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:23,976
Okay.

1033
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:25,311
If you'll hold on to that.

1034
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,112
- Yeah, sure, Doctor.
- Thank you.

1035
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:29,657
Now, every seventh grader,
even the dumb ones,

1036
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,780
know the second law
of thermodynamics.

1037
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:35,579
"All ordered systems
tend toward disorder." Disorder!

1038
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:40,285
So I'm going to ask you one
more time, sir, what gives?

1039
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:49,131
Well, it's actually
topological quantum order.

1040
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:52,259
The emergence of quantum effects
on a macroscopic level.

1041
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:55,216
So that is, in fact, what gives.

1042
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:01,355
Thank you.

1043
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:11,945
You know,
Buffy is not a bad name for you.

1044
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:15,619
You know, buff, firm, taut.

1045
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,559
That's good.
Did you just find a thesaurus somewhere?

1046
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:18,869
Nubile.

1047
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:22,077
- That's good. Thank you. Okay.
- There we go.

1048
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:34,092
Sorry, sorry.

1049
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:43,389
The stick's metal.
How are we going to get it out?

1050
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:44,689
Yeah. I don't know.

1051
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,689
This is the housing.

1052
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:52,319
820 million qubit miles
of digi-synaptic resonance.

1053
00:56:57,706 --> 00:57:00,184
But of course, what sets us apart
from anything else on the planet

1054
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:04,918
is the processor, which we playfully
refer to as the Magic Broomstick.

1055
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:06,005
The Broomstick?

1056
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,798
Has the power to clear the contents
of any computing system on the planet

1057
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:12,502
and then magically
sweep them into your bin.

1058
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:15,213
Oh! Broomstick. That's funny.

1059
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:18,049
Take a look, vet it however you'd like,

1060
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,475
and tell Hannes we'll be
taking bids on Monday.

1061
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:21,768
Thank you.

1062
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,519
Oh, my God.
I must be allergic to something in here.

1063
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,521
What could you possibly be
allergic to in here?

1064
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,775
- This room is hermetically sealed.
- That's it.

1065
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,697
I'm allergic to hermetic seals.

1066
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,553
If we could get him away
from the computer, please.

1067
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:38,239
- That's the one thing.
- Just until he's recovered.

1068
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:39,866
We're gonna need some anti-baa...

1069
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:42,782
Do we have alcohol wipes?

1070
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:45,271
Your hands need to be sterile
if you intend to get any closer.

1071
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,457
Do I make myself clear?

1072
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,962
- Sorry. We couldn't...
- No, I'm fine.

1073
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,321
Take his medicine into the country.

1074
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:54,506
Yeah...

1075
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:00,345
Can't risk any contamination.

1076
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:03,177
You're gonna have to stay away
from the inner workings.

1077
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,636
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1078
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,376
- All right. If you're done...
- Oh. Here you go.

1079
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,107
Sorry about this.
Okay. I'm okay.

1080
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,309
This happens to him sometimes.
It'll pass.

1081
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,270
Allergies. Nothing you can do.

1082
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:14,355
Well, something you could do, Doctor.

1083
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:35,428
Okay?

1084
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:43,477
Search him, please.

1085
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:44,973
Didn't we just do that?

1086
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,394
Are you serious?

1087
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,438
Okay. I wanna run
full diagnostics on the system.

1088
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,226
This is completely unnecessary.

1089
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,014
Up, up,

1090
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,216
Okay.

1091
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:44,320
Ah!

1092
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,781
Hey! I can walk on my own.

1093
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:55,964
Whoa!

1094
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:58,636
Sorry.

1095
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:17,485
Hey!

1096
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,438
I can do that myself.

1097
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:21,774
We just met, man.

1098
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,233
Handsy, handsy, handsy.

1099
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,465
Hey!

1100
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,126
My eyes are up here, man.

1101
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,631
How do you like it?

1102
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:05,283
Hey, I'm good.

1103
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:07,997
Turn around.

1104
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:27,381
Do you have anything?

1105
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,136
I don't know.
Can't trust anybody.

1106
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:32,886
- I'm good.
- They're clean.

1107
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,268
Do your final checks
and get them out of here.

1108
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,691
Oh, we're walking
this way again. Yay.

1109
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:47,785
I don't speak the language.

1110
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:55,576
See?

1111
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,630
What did I tell you, man?
We didn't have anything.

1112
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,085
Thanks, pal. Appreciate that.

1113
01:02:17,025 --> 01:02:20,768
Something about a big white dance floor,
makes me wanna boogie.

1114
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:23,103
Hey, thanks for having us.

1115
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,609
That's great stuff.

1116
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:32,946
Okay.

1117
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:35,499
You guys are pretty serious
about your security, huh?

1118
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:40,546
Okay.

1119
01:02:40,632 --> 01:02:44,091
Do I have all my things?
I feel like I came in with more stuff.

1120
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,794
Did I come in with more stuff?

1121
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,050
You don't think so?

1122
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:53,763
Uh, sir, I think you
still have my wallet.

1123
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:56,470
Remember, I, uh, gave it
to you when I came in?

1124
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,726
It would be nice to leave with it.

1125
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:04,571
Wallet coming through.

1126
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,037
Sorry, my belt.

1127
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,290
- Uh...

1128
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:23,338
I guess that's everything, right?

1129
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:24,506
Thank you.

1130
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:27,129
- That is not a toy, Buffy.
- Sorry.

1131
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,932
Go, go, go!

1132
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,315
All right.
Drop me off at the market

1133
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:44,143
so I can get this to the Eye.

1134
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,506
You asked me to call you
when they started

1135
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:46,315
running around like headless chickens.

1136
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:46,403
Running around like headless chickens.

1137
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:47,926
Running around like headless chickens.

1138
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,023
Well, that's what's happening.

1139
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,458
This is where your sources
told you they'd be?

1140
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:11,341
No, this is where my sources said
we might find an answer.

1141
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,266
She must be familiar with your work.

1142
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:25,772
Excuse me.

1143
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:29,025
Miss, have you seen these people?

1144
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:42,118
She says her grandson
spoke to their leader.

1145
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:43,373
He's in the back.

1146
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:45,253
What?

1147
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,206
No "Wow, you speak Mandarin"?

1148
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:21,035
Ah! The Coffin to the Beyond.

1149
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:27,042
It was always a flap,
or a trap or mirrors.

1150
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:31,667
The audience thought
he'd just disappeared.

1151
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,633
But he was always
hidden somewhere inside.

1152
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:52,028
I believe that's the prototype
for the one your father had made.

1153
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:55,449
He, like many others over the years,
ordered his supplies from here.

1154
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:59,362
Ah!
Of course.

1155
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:03,165
That's why you gave me the look
when I said they were in Macau.

1156
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:05,413
Your father used to come here
when you were young.

1157
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,244
Can I please get some space here?

1158
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:16,508
If you think you're the only one who'd
wondered for 30 years what happened...

1159
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,589
you're not.

1160
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:21,015
Lionel was a master magician.

1161
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:22,592
Either he gamed the hinges,

1162
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:26,180
so he could kick the door
and they would pop out,

1163
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:30,108
or he had access to the lock
from the inside so he could pick it.

1164
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:34,860
Word is the safe was made
from cheap metal, and it bowed.

1165
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:40,570
Still, he always had
something up his sleeve.

1166
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:47,285
Unless he'd reached the limit of
his capabilities and his clock ran out.

1167
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:56,585
Excuse me. My grandmother
has something you might want.

1168
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:02,591
This was your father's.

1169
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,892
He had several of these made.

1170
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,906
And the Horsemen?

1171
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:28,950
I overheard them talking.

1172
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:33,505
One of them, Atlas, he's meeting
someone at the market nearby.

1173
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,357
As for former Agent Rhodes,

1174
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:55,026
his location is now
your number one priority.

1175
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,275
We're putting out an international APB.

1176
01:07:57,365 --> 01:08:00,107
We have Interpol, including cooperation
from local authorities.

1177
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:01,441
Agent Cowan.

1178
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:05,120
I'm assuming it was actually not you
who walked into Newburgh Federal Prison,

1179
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:08,119
then walked out 30 minutes later
with Thaddeus Bradley?

1180
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:10,120
- What?
- He used your ID.

1181
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,172
What are you doing, Rhodes?

1182
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,657
- Atlas, hey.
- Dylan.

1183
01:08:45,747 --> 01:08:47,349
- I blew it, I'm sorry.
- What are you doing here?

1184
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:48,579
I'm here to help now.

1185
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,019
Okay, we definitely
don't need your help.

1186
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:51,329
I know I messed up, all right?

1187
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:52,980
Yeah, you put everybody's
lives in danger.

1188
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:55,336
- Where is everybody?
- Where is everybody?

1189
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,151
I can't be seen with you,
actually, right now.

1190
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:59,132
I got it now, okay?
I appreciate you taking

1191
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:00,821
the time to take control
for a little while.

1192
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,573
- Hey, I'm actually... Yeah?
- Yeah, but I got it now, all right?

1193
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:03,632
- You do?
- Yeah.

1194
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,117
You look like you can
get some rest, buddy.

1195
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,633
- Who you meeting here?
- I'm not meeting anybody.

1196
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:09,246
They told me at long's
you were meeting somebody.

1197
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,181
At long's?

1198
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:14,060
Okay, yeah, no, I am, um...

1199
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,562
I'm meeting somebody from the Eye.

1200
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:17,921
Yeah, no, they agreed to meet me

1201
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:20,937
to exchange this computer chip
for our lives back.

1202
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:22,312
So that's what it's come to now.

1203
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,219
I hope you're happy
with the situation you've put us in.

1204
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:25,733
You're talking to the Eye?

1205
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:26,909
Yeah.

1206
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,828
Why are you talking to the Eye?

1207
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,790
Atlas.
Atlas, give me the stick.

1208
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:35,164
Dylan, you're not our
leader anymore, okay'?

1209
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:37,871
You're not our hero.
You're not FBI.

1210
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:40,923
You're not a magician.
You're not really anything.

1211
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,843
And we trusted you for a year.

1212
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:44,010
So if you really wanna help us...
If you really...

1213
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:44,093
So if you really wanna help us...
If you really...

1214
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:46,304
So if you really wanna help us...
If you really...

1215
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:49,008
If you really wanna help us,
you would leave.

1216
01:09:57,443 --> 01:10:00,731
I get it. Cool. Bye.

1217
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:19,587
Hello, hello!

1218
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:22,462
Yeah, that was me you called
at the magic shop.

1219
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:25,927
So much fun though, knowing you'd be
scurrying away from me at the lab

1220
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:27,424
just to bring it to me here.

1221
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:29,131
Did you actually think I'd let you go?

1222
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:31,933
- How did you do that?
- Everyone has their button.

1223
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:35,978
You push it and they go blind.
And yours, obviously, is ego.

1224
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,555
"Stay the course.

1225
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,392
<i>Great changes are in store.</i>

1226
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:42,978
<i>Trust that your unique talents</i>

1227
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,654
will not go unrecognized."

1228
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,364
- That was you.
- Yeah.

1229
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:48,942
Merritt downloaded all the files,

1230
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:51,744
but how do you think
we were able to find him?

1231
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:52,912
Your phone.

1232
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:56,791
I asked to see the face
behind all of this.

1233
01:10:56,878 --> 01:11:00,041
What you actually put your phone on
was a bi-wave siphon pad.

1234
01:11:01,549 --> 01:11:05,759
Once again, science beats magic.

1235
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,507
- So, the stick?
- No.

1236
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:12,642
I got it!

1237
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:14,138
I got it. I got it.

1238
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:18,055
- Fuck, Dylan!
- Wait, leave them!

1239
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:19,668
You really think
I'm gonna walk away from you?

1240
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,774
Give me the stick!

1241
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:22,942
Give me it!

1242
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:25,987
All right.
Don't ever question me again. Beat it!

1243
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:39,326
- So, the stick.
- Go to hell.

1244
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:41,171
Boys.

1245
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:55,554
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1246
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,280
There's like 10 of you.

1247
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:15,157
Come on, he's just doing tricks.

1248
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:17,114
He's there! Go!

1249
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:06,879
Oh...

1250
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:45,456
Dylan, watch the pretty birdies fly.
And sleep.

1251
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:49,126
- Doesn't work on me.
- Not even as a distraction?

1252
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:54,427
- Good job.
- Nice to be involved.

1253
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:04,767
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!

1254
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:07,544
- I just saw Dylan, something happened.
- What do you mean you just saw Dylan?

1255
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,605
Dylan's here?
What happened?

1256
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:12,153
- Atlas.
- I don't know.

1257
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:18,155
What are they doing?

1258
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:20,657
Those are Walter's men.

1259
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:23,786
This is what they want.

1260
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:26,083
What the hell?
How do you still have that?

1261
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,836
Whoa. That's Lionel Shrike's safe.

1262
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:35,419
What the hell
do they want with that?

1263
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:37,254
Okay, we gotta
follow that truck.

1264
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:40,682
They must have Dylan.
We don't have much time.

1265
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:46,304
What do you want?

1266
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:51,018
You to understand something
very important.

1267
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:54,355
We are mirror images.

1268
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:55,734
You see, because like you,

1269
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:58,066
I share a very deep connection
with my father.

1270
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:04,414
And like you, I'll stop at nothing
to avenge any wrongs done to him.

1271
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:12,626
You know the only difference
between your father and mine?

1272
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:14,583
Mine's still alive.

1273
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:16,508
Get him up.

1274
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:34,361
So, this is the man

1275
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:37,530
who spent a lifetime
plotting against me.

1276
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,822
I wouldn't have known your face

1277
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:45,405
if it had been on a billboard
outside my bedroom window.

1278
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:49,163
But you have spent, what,
30 years thinking about mine?

1279
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:50,493
When my father died,

1280
01:15:50,588 --> 01:15:52,704
your insurance company
denied my mother her claims.

1281
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:54,192
- I wouldn't even have known...
- She died a pauper!

1282
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:56,048
Who your mother was.

1283
01:15:56,135 --> 01:16:00,720
She was a digit, a nanobyte
in a stream of data.

1284
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,763
Because nothing is personal to you

1285
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:05,162
and everyone and everything
is just a number, isn't that so?

1286
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:07,018
That is where you are wrong,
Mr. Rhodes.

1287
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:07,101
That is where you are wrong,
Mr. Rhodes.

1288
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:07,809
That is where you are wrong,
Mr. Rhodes.

1289
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:12,812
Once you made yourself known
it became very personal.

1290
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:15,902
- My son...
- Yeah, the sociopath.

1291
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:20,573
Funny thing is, I have seven
so-called legitimate children.

1292
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:23,651
Sniveling, snobbish, stupid runts.

1293
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:27,705
I have one illegitimate child
who is a lot like me.

1294
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:30,159
The point is,
he wants something,

1295
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:35,372
and like any good parent, I will
stop at nothing to get it for him.

1296
01:16:35,466 --> 01:16:37,207
Your Horsemen have it.

1297
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:41,590
You will turn it and them
over to us, now.

1298
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,761
No.

1299
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:49,261
Dylan, I would like you
to really take this moment in

1300
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:52,768
because this is the consequence
of your personal vendetta come to life

1301
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:54,599
and staring you in the face.

1302
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:56,434
I want you to know
that when you're gone,

1303
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:57,564
we're not going to stop.

1304
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:59,737
We're gonna destroy
everything you believe in,

1305
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:02,031
starting with the Horsemen,
and ending with the Eye.

1306
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:03,984
Now then, cast your mind back

1307
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:07,196
to standing by the banks of the river
watching your father descend,

1308
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:09,280
disgraced and discredited.

1309
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:12,117
The horrid psychic pain
as you have relived for years.

1310
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:16,166
I felt that same thing two years ago

1311
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:19,340
as you drained not just my father's
fortune, but his dignity!

1312
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:21,918
And yet you took pleasure from it.

1313
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:27,348
This should bring back
some childhood memories.

1314
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:56,585
- Would you like some tea?
- Oh. Thank you.

1315
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:14,600
- You ready?
- Over to you.

1316
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:22,649
Splash!

1317
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:27,567
Job done!

1318
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:46,587
Hell is going to
seem like a day at the spa

1319
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,138
by the time we're through
with these Horsemen.

1320
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,887
- Wouldn't you say?
- You had me at "hell."

1321
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:11,153
<i>I love you so much.</i>

1322
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:16,161
Always keep something up my sleeve.

1323
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:37,993
I wish I could dredge
from the muck of my soul

1324
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:42,168
one speck of remorse,
but I can't.

1325
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:48,671
So I'll stick to the business at hand
and try not to smile too broadly.

1326
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:54,097
And, uh, thank you for delivering
Mr. Dylan Rhodes.

1327
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:56,599
I take it it's done.

1328
01:20:57,936 --> 01:20:59,893
Literally hit the bottom.

1329
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:06,227
- Now, where are the Horsemen?
- They're performers.

1330
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:11,861
Their pride, their ego, their need
to be adored are all too powerful

1331
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:13,816
to keep them out of
the limelight for long.

1332
01:21:13,911 --> 01:21:19,406
If they don't make themselves known,
you will find yourself

1333
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:23,459
in a very similar position
to Mr. Rhodes.

1334
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:27,379
- Are we clear about that?
- As clear as the water he's under.

1335
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:38,428
You'll have the rest
when I have the Horsemen.

1336
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:11,752
Dylan!

1337
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,552
Dylan, come on, buddy, breathe!

1338
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:16,845
- Dylan.
- Dylan?

1339
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:19,014
Dylan, come on!

1340
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,980
You're okay.

1341
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:28,774
Jesus! You scared
the hell out of us, man.

1342
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:32,479
- Are you all right, bro?
- Okay!

1343
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:34,530
- Thank you!
- This is the least I could do.

1344
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:36,594
No. There's a hell of a lot
less you could've done.

1345
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:37,904
That was not an option.

1346
01:22:37,995 --> 01:22:39,861
You took a bullet for us, it was huge.

1347
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:41,787
You really did, man.

1348
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:46,292
Thanks for pulling me out.
Seriously.

1349
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:48,585
Yeah.

1350
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:50,788
You got yourself out.
We did the easy part.

1351
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:53,124
Literally, in my case,
I was just standing on the shore

1352
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:54,571
while Atlas jumped down and got you.

1353
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:56,131
I'm serious.

1354
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:58,588
Hey, you guys.
Something's not right.

1355
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:00,389
- What's wrong?
- What?

1356
01:23:02,019 --> 01:23:04,306
- It's fake.
- What?

1357
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:07,600
No, I had the stick.

1358
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:10,308
The actual stick.
I swear, it was in my hand,

1359
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:12,894
in the lab, and then I put it in
the little case thing.

1360
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:15,175
- And I gave it to Atlas.
- Right, which I then gave to Dylan.

1361
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,691
Is there any chance you've possibly
misplaced it at any point?

1362
01:23:17,784 --> 01:23:21,152
No, I took it from you
and then slipped it back in your coat

1363
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:22,987
when I pushed you out.

1364
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:26,290
Either way, we're left holding
a whole sack full of nada.

1365
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:28,959
Yeah, but they're gonna come after us
as if we do have something.

1366
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:32,380
No. Okay. I agree that somebody
got the better of us. Okay? Somehow.

1367
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:34,878
But I don't agree
that we have a sack full of nada.

1368
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:38,131
Because we're all here.
That's a sack full of something.

1369
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:45,806
Listen, we all know that Walter is not
going to stop until he gets that chip.

1370
01:23:45,896 --> 01:23:49,434
And we're the only ones
that even know that he's alive.

1371
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:54,110
We can't just walk away.
That's not what the Horsemen do.

1372
01:23:56,907 --> 01:23:58,693
There's a quote. Um...

1373
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:00,195
It's actually by the magician

1374
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:02,085
that made me wanna do this
in the first place.

1375
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,031
It's, uh...

1376
01:24:04,122 --> 01:24:10,789
"A magician's greatest power lies
forever shrouded in his empty fist."

1377
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:13,211
"And the very idea
that he can convince the world

1378
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:16,416
that he is, in fact,
carrying with him a secret."

1379
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:19,343
- That's Lionel Shrike.
- Right.

1380
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:21,678
So what are you saying?

1381
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:24,974
That we should pretend like
we have something we don't?

1382
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:31,434
- What is Walter's greatest fear?
- Being seen.

1383
01:24:31,525 --> 01:24:35,519
- And what does the stick do?
- The stick can unencode anything.

1384
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:40,527
It can open up a back door
into any computer on the planet.

1385
01:24:40,617 --> 01:24:42,608
- Including his.
- Yeah.

1386
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:46,658
Right, we not only make him
think that we have it,

1387
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:50,833
but that we're going to use it
to expose and destroy him.

1388
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:54,287
We need a plan.
But we don't have time.

1389
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:57,840
We have each other
and there are five of us.

1390
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:00,839
But we also need supplies, right?
And resources.

1391
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:04,172
And probably more than five people.

1392
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:08,134
Do you really think
you don't have help?

1393
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:10,970
Oh, she speaks English.
Of course. Yeah.

1394
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:16,480
Do you know why the Fool is
the most powerful card in the tarot?

1395
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:20,188
Not because the person
who draws him is a fool.

1396
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:24,697
He's a fool because he's a clean slate,

1397
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:28,700
and, therefore, can become anything.

1398
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:30,076
You were chosen.

1399
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:32,662
All of you.

1400
01:25:32,753 --> 01:25:37,964
Not because of who you are,
but because of who you might become.

1401
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:43,427
When you say "chosen"...
Are you part of the Eye?

1402
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:47,552
Yes. We are part of the Eye.

1403
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:50,852
You've each doubted our existence.

1404
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:55,977
Wondering if we,
indeed, were watching.

1405
01:25:59,613 --> 01:26:03,231
We are.
We always have been.

1406
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:05,817
This is the best
magic shop in the world.

1407
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:08,118
- You know what she's saying, right?
- Yes.

1408
01:26:08,205 --> 01:26:10,572
That now we have
resources and help.

1409
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:13,748
Thank you.

1410
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:17,915
So, who's in?

1411
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:24,301
- I'm in.
- Yeah, I'm in.

1412
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:28,140
Let's do this.

1413
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:47,574
No, no, no.

1414
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:52,321
<i>Not long ago, we were tricked.</i>

1415
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:55,329
<i>I was exposed
and brought back from the dead.</i>

1416
01:26:55,419 --> 01:26:58,252
<i>So we thought it was only fitting
that we do the same thing</i>

1417
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:02,673
<i>- to the person who did it to us.
- Midnight, New Year's Eve. London.</i>

1418
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:06,002
<i>We will be performing a series of shows
that all connect to our big finale,</i>

1419
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:08,212
<i>so pay close attention to each trick.</i>

1420
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:09,387
Get my father.

1421
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:12,641
Run!

1422
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:15,891
I want Interpol, Scotland Yard,
whoever we have in London.

1423
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:17,221
What do we know about Rhodes?

1424
01:27:17,315 --> 01:27:19,147
Wherever the Horsemen are,
that's where he is.

1425
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:20,349
Let's get to the airport.

1426
01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:22,844
<i>So leave your kiddies
at home and get ready for</i> a <i>wild night,</i>

1427
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:25,987
<i>because we, too, will bring
someone back from the dead.</i>

1428
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:27,860
Let's move, everyone!

1429
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:29,817
<i>In front of
the largest stage in the world...</i>

1430
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:31,822
<i>The actual world.</i>

1431
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:35,656
You know they're playing you, right?
Leading you into a trap?

1432
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:37,412
Yeah, but the threat is real.

1433
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:40,164
This card can hack into any system
on the planet, including ours.

1434
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:42,462
They have it, why wouldn't
they use it to expose us?

1435
01:27:42,549 --> 01:27:44,039
Me. Everything we've done.

1436
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:46,171
Is it real, Mr. McKinney?

1437
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:54,800
The threat is real.

1438
01:27:54,895 --> 01:27:57,136
So, how do we stay
ahead of them?

1439
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:59,597
We need to get
to London by midnight.

1440
01:28:08,325 --> 01:28:09,815
We are here in London

1441
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:12,402
<i>on this New Year's Eve,
and the crowds are out in force.</i>

1442
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:13,952
Locals and tourists alike

1443
01:28:14,039 --> 01:28:16,155
<i>getting ready for
the party of the year.</i>

1444
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:18,160
<i>A video gone viral from the infamous</i>

1445
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:20,083
<i>Horsemen magicians has surfaced.</i>

1446
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:21,831
They promise
<i>to</i> make a grand reappearance.

1447
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:25,005
But will it end in
their arrest <i>on national television?</i>

1448
01:28:25,091 --> 01:28:26,752
<i>Or some sort of vindication?</i>

1449
01:28:26,843 --> 01:28:28,925
<i>Who knows where they'll show up...</i>

1450
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:30,377
But we do <i>know,</i> wherever,

1451
01:28:30,472 --> 01:28:33,590
<i>whenever that is,
people will be watching.</i>

1452
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:37,221
Yeah, texts, tweets, lnstagrams.

1453
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:40,270
Anything that says "Horsemen,"
brags about seeing the Horsemen,

1454
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:42,018
tag them and bundle them.

1455
01:28:42,108 --> 01:28:44,475
Dad, who do we have security-wise
on this? Your guys?

1456
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:45,730
Whoever you want.

1457
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:47,701
Well, we want all of them
and all their friends.

1458
01:28:47,781 --> 01:28:49,884
Anyone who wants to work
stationed throughout the city,

1459
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:51,694
so they can be anywhere in 60 seconds.

1460
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:08,248
Hello! Hey!

1461
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:12,006
My name's Jack Wilder.

1462
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:14,805
Goddamn, it feels good to be back.

1463
01:29:14,891 --> 01:29:18,475
All right, gather around. Indulge me.

1464
01:29:18,562 --> 01:29:20,769
I wanna talk to you about
something real quick.

1465
01:29:20,856 --> 01:29:24,724
You all know Three Card Monte,
also known as "Find the Lady"?

1466
01:29:24,818 --> 01:29:29,107
Trick performed by street hustlers all
over the world. And why street hustlers?

1467
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:32,064
Because <i>as</i> soon as you walk up
to the table, you lose.

1468
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:34,115
Every time.
Let me demonstrate.

1469
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:40,699
While we're at it,
let's find ourselves a life-sized Queen.

1470
01:29:40,792 --> 01:29:42,703
Ma'am, would you
mind being my Queen?

1471
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:48,379
Don't worry. I promise you
there's a 50 percent chance

1472
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:49,819
you'll get her back after the show.

1473
01:29:49,843 --> 01:29:51,629
Head over there.
Thank you very much.

1474
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:55,213
All right. Let's find ourselves
some Jacks to serve our Queen!

1475
01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:56,593
<i>Trust me, gentlemen.</i>

1476
01:29:56,683 --> 01:30:00,426
I know how these guys work now.
They're gonna start with a tease.

1477
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,477
A few little pop-ups.

1478
01:30:02,564 --> 01:30:05,431
<i>Something to lure you in. Like...</i>

1479
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:09,644
Well, you know, like Three Card Monte,
where the guy goes,

1480
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:12,275
"Looky here, but no, no, looky here!"

1481
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:16,279
<i>Except when all these
little tricks are done,</i>

1482
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:18,451
<i>the only thing
you're gonna be looking at</i>

1483
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:22,497
is the inside of your own colon,
with the words

1484
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:25,497
<i>"Horsemen" written all over it.</i>

1485
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:27,790
In blood.

1486
01:30:27,881 --> 01:30:31,340
We get the picture, Mr. McKinney.

1487
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:33,463
And get out of my chair.

1488
01:30:33,553 --> 01:30:34,634
Hello, everybody!

1489
01:30:34,638 --> 01:30:34,718
Hello, everybody!

1490
01:30:34,721 --> 01:30:35,756
Hello, everybody!

1491
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:37,804
Come close, come on!

1492
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:39,802
All right, all right, so listen.

1493
01:30:39,893 --> 01:30:45,354
Tonight, I am going to make
something fly using actual magic.

1494
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,181
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!

1495
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:50,313
I'm going to take
a very large vessel,

1496
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:54,738
I'm gonna make it fly over there
and land on the Thames.

1497
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:56,656
Can you handle that?

1498
01:30:56,743 --> 01:30:58,279
Same rules apply as before.

1499
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:00,452
All you need to do is
keep your eye on the Queen.

1500
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:01,869
It's as simple as that.

1501
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:03,664
- Are you guys ready?
- Yeah!

1502
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:05,206
Dad, look at this.

1503
01:31:06,544 --> 01:31:07,939
Tag this one.
Where does it come from?

1504
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:10,079
Near the river.
Looks like the shows are starting.

1505
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:11,734
But we're not the only ones
who found them.

1506
01:31:11,758 --> 01:31:13,398
- What do you mean?
- It's on Channel One.

1507
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:22,849
- Let's go to 2.
- Here we go.

1508
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:25,519
Got him. We have a location.

1509
01:31:25,605 --> 01:31:27,562
It's Jack Wilder.
Here come the Horsemen.

1510
01:31:27,649 --> 01:31:29,606
Okay, we're moving.
Let's go, let's go.

1511
01:31:29,693 --> 01:31:31,400
Typing in grid coordinates now.

1512
01:31:33,196 --> 01:31:35,813
Turn around.
Hide yourselves with the cards.

1513
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:39,654
And here we go. Switch!

1514
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:43,349
You guys still have your eye on her?
You want me to go back and do it?

1515
01:31:43,373 --> 01:31:46,456
Okay, all right. I'm moving on.
And switch.

1516
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:49,455
Where is she?

1517
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:52,876
Down at the end?
You sure?

1518
01:31:52,966 --> 01:31:55,754
All right, can I get a drumroll
from my man in the back?

1519
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:57,755
Thank you very much.

1520
01:31:59,014 --> 01:32:00,504
Uh-oh.

1521
01:32:01,266 --> 01:32:02,381
Uh-oh.

1522
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:06,143
There's my girl.

1523
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:08,846
Not my girl, 100 percent your girl.

1524
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:10,271
But just in this situation.

1525
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:12,975
Okay, but I gotta warm up
a little bit first. Okay?

1526
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:16,937
So, uh, let me just
make something small fly, like...

1527
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:19,148
Fly, fly, fly!

1528
01:32:19,242 --> 01:32:22,610
Wow, right? Look at that!
Aw. Come on, people.

1529
01:32:22,746 --> 01:32:25,613
Tough crowd. You, fly!

1530
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:26,822
- Me?
- Check your fly.

1531
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:31,952
You like that?

1532
01:32:32,047 --> 01:32:33,913
You support that relationship?

1533
01:32:34,007 --> 01:32:36,874
That guy had a bird in his pants.
That's disgusting.

1534
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:42,592
<i>Copy that.
We've got two sightings reported.</i>

1535
01:32:42,682 --> 01:32:45,595
<i>- Heading to Greenwich Market.
- Get me Thaddeus.</i>

1536
01:32:45,685 --> 01:32:47,972
<i>Thaddeus, the FBI are here.
They're moving.</i>

1537
01:32:48,063 --> 01:32:51,146
Let 'em move.
That's what the Horsemen want.

1538
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:52,960
Well, what if they get there first?
That can't happen.

1539
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:55,100
<i>I guarantee you, they won't.</i>

1540
01:32:55,195 --> 01:32:56,401
Find the pattern.

1541
01:32:57,363 --> 01:33:00,321
You do that, and you'll be able
to cut them off

1542
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,775
<i>before they get to their final trick.</i>

1543
01:33:02,869 --> 01:33:06,578
If it makes you feel better,
I'll take care of the FBI.

1544
01:33:19,886 --> 01:33:22,298
OK, well, I guess you found me!

1545
01:33:22,388 --> 01:33:23,970
We've got a third spot.

1546
01:33:24,057 --> 01:33:26,549
Okay, everybody,
we're getting a pattern.

1547
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:33,977
Um... Give me two, 13 and 21.

1548
01:33:35,068 --> 01:33:37,935
What the hell is that?
Freeze that and zoom in.

1549
01:33:40,073 --> 01:33:42,815
How the hell did this happen?

1550
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:46,069
He's dead. We watched him drown.
How the hell did this happen?

1551
01:33:46,162 --> 01:33:48,654
Given that it did happen,
the pertinent question is,

1552
01:33:48,748 --> 01:33:49,809
what are we gonna do about it?

1553
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:51,574
We're gonna stop him, Dad.
We'll stop him.

1554
01:33:51,668 --> 01:33:52,749
Where's my coat?

1555
01:33:52,836 --> 01:33:55,544
Walter, for the record,
I never loved the safe idea.

1556
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:57,166
Oh, I know where they're going.

1557
01:33:57,257 --> 01:33:59,840
The next show is Merritt's
and it's by the river.

1558
01:33:59,926 --> 01:34:01,291
Chase, you need to get to him

1559
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:03,626
so we can find the Horsemen's
entry point for the finale.

1560
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:12,891
I have a confession to make. I've been
told I have some control issues.

1561
01:34:12,981 --> 01:34:16,315
I've learned that it's really,
really hard to control people,

1562
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:20,315
so I'm gonna try to control something
that's a lot easier than people.

1563
01:34:20,405 --> 01:34:21,841
I'm gonna try to
control the weather.

1564
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:24,653
Yeah, rain, um...

1565
01:34:26,161 --> 01:34:27,847
It'd be a little difficult
to make it rain, right?

1566
01:34:27,871 --> 01:34:30,613
That would be something
that only God can do, right'?

1567
01:34:30,707 --> 01:34:32,994
I'm gonna do something
that God can't do.

1568
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:35,951
I'm not just gonna make it clear up.
No, no, no.

1569
01:34:36,045 --> 01:34:38,127
I'm gonna make it actually stop.

1570
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:54,645
And can God do that?
Mmm. No, I don't think so.

1571
01:34:54,731 --> 01:34:57,063
Or what about make it go up?

1572
01:35:04,741 --> 01:35:06,732
Are you still with me?

1573
01:35:06,826 --> 01:35:09,864
Watch the Queen on the left.
Let's do it. Turn around.

1574
01:35:13,249 --> 01:35:14,364
Switch!

1575
01:35:18,087 --> 01:35:19,248
Show me the lady.

1576
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:22,127
Show me the lady!

1577
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:23,378
The end? End?

1578
01:35:25,887 --> 01:35:28,047
You know what?
I'm actually starting to feel kinda bad.

1579
01:35:29,015 --> 01:35:32,098
It's just because I can actually feel
that you guys are paying attention.

1580
01:35:32,185 --> 01:35:33,801
It's just that...

1581
01:35:33,895 --> 01:35:37,308
You know, it's unfortunate
that it's the wrong kind of attention.

1582
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:41,024
Yeah, we need a fresher bird.

1583
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:45,320
He's so cute. He's so cute!

1584
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:48,148
Let's kill him, right?

1585
01:35:48,243 --> 01:35:52,202
- Merritt, move into position.
- Got it, Dylan.

1586
01:35:52,288 --> 01:35:53,949
Uh, I'm on my way.
I'll see you there.

1587
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:56,407
Lula, stand by, all right?

1588
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:58,833
Or, what about just go,
I don't know, just go insane?

1589
01:36:08,388 --> 01:36:10,846
Reports are
<i>coming in</i> from all over London

1590
01:36:10,932 --> 01:36:14,516
<i>as the Horsemen appear to have taken
over the whole city for their show.</i>

1591
01:36:17,563 --> 01:36:21,227
Hey, broski-whaddya-knowski?
Where you headed?

1592
01:36:21,317 --> 01:36:22,670
- Please, bro, don't do this.
- Where are you headed?

1593
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:24,480
North, south, east?

1594
01:36:25,363 --> 01:36:26,853
East. Tower of London?

1595
01:36:26,948 --> 01:36:29,690
Tower Bridge?
Near Tower Bridge? The Thames!

1596
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:34,324
You're going to
the Thamesy-Whemsy! You're so easy!

1597
01:36:34,414 --> 01:36:37,031
Bro, if there's any chance of us
ever having a relationship...

1598
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:39,492
There's not.
Where's your entry?

1599
01:36:39,585 --> 01:36:43,374
South Bank? Greenwich? Greenwich.

1600
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:47,082
I know where you're going.
I know where...

1601
01:36:48,428 --> 01:36:49,793
Watch it, hobo.

1602
01:36:52,724 --> 01:36:55,216
Hey, Merritt. Oh, come on.
Tell me you're kidding. How?

1603
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:58,385
When?

1604
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:01,096
Shit. All right. All right, I got it.

1605
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:03,227
Don't worry about it.
I'll warn the others.

1606
01:37:06,195 --> 01:37:07,856
Sorry. Just...

1607
01:37:10,533 --> 01:37:11,614
What? I just told you...

1608
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:12,701
Phone call.

1609
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:15,201
- Hello?
<i>- Lula.</i>

1610
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:18,622
Dylan. Ah, yeah, kind of in the middle
of something right now.

1611
01:37:18,708 --> 01:37:21,291
<i>Wrap it up.
Meet me at the rendezvous point now.</i>

1612
01:37:21,377 --> 01:37:22,617
- What?
- Now!

1613
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:25,295
Was that an act of God?

1614
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:28,464
No. No, no, no,
that was an act of me

1615
01:37:28,551 --> 01:37:31,714
and the strobe lights
and rain machines.

1616
01:37:31,804 --> 01:37:33,715
And I hope you guys
were paying attention.

1617
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:36,166
Because you're gonna need to know
all of that for the final.

1618
01:37:39,562 --> 01:37:42,645
So how did I do it?
Did I use a Barry Trap?

1619
01:37:42,732 --> 01:37:45,019
Maybe some switches
or a few duplicates?

1620
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:46,144
<i>Jack, go now!</i>

1621
01:37:46,235 --> 01:37:47,338
You know what?
I hate to say it.

1622
01:37:47,362 --> 01:37:49,162
You're gonna have to wait to find out.
I know.

1623
01:37:49,197 --> 01:37:51,609
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I love you all.

1624
01:37:55,036 --> 01:37:56,117
<i>Lula,</i> go!

1625
01:37:56,204 --> 01:37:58,286
I have to go.

1626
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:21,351
Out of the way, FBI!
Move, move, move! Go!

1627
01:38:21,437 --> 01:38:23,144
Get some men in that park!

1628
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:24,346
Men in the park, now!

1629
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,556
You gonna fill up on appetizers?

1630
01:38:26,651 --> 01:38:29,268
Or save room for
the main course?

1631
01:38:29,362 --> 01:38:31,148
Where the hell are the Horsemen?

1632
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:32,519
You can chase them all you want,

1633
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:35,031
you're just gonna wind up
holding your own tails.

1634
01:38:36,035 --> 01:38:38,823
Or, you can let them
come to you.

1635
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:40,495
So, what's it gonna be?

1636
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:41,696
Chase them?

1637
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:44,073
Or make a deal with me?

1638
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:52,336
Again? How did we
get found out again?

1639
01:38:52,427 --> 01:38:54,238
It's fine, it's fine.
We'll just cut to the finale.

1640
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:55,822
- Where's Merritt?
- Fine. I don't know.

1641
01:38:55,847 --> 01:38:56,847
I'm here.

1642
01:38:56,931 --> 01:38:58,717
- Where's Lula?
- I'm right here!

1643
01:38:58,808 --> 01:39:00,674
What the hell happened?

1644
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:02,704
- My goddamn brother happened.
- Don't worry about it.

1645
01:39:02,728 --> 01:39:04,208
We just gotta get to the destination.

1646
01:39:04,272 --> 01:39:06,250
- Lula, can you handle that thing?
- I can ride it.

1647
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:08,265
Have you asked the guys
that question, or just me?

1648
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:09,599
- Yeah, good point.
- Let's go!

1649
01:39:09,694 --> 01:39:10,775
No, Jack.

1650
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:16,450
Shit!

1651
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:20,823
Jack's down. We gotta get him.

1652
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:25,243
Come on, move!

1653
01:39:30,715 --> 01:39:32,956
- Jack! Go, go!
- That's the brake.

1654
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:34,632
That's the gas.
You'll figure it out.

1655
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:36,380
Come on, follow me!

1656
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:38,680
That's it?

1657
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:56,905
- Hey, ready?
- Yeah!

1658
01:40:03,748 --> 01:40:05,079
Get on.

1659
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:11,036
- Yeah!
- Okay, guys, I'm coming!

1660
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:13,417
Whoa! Jesus!

1661
01:40:14,884 --> 01:40:16,625
I'm coming!

1662
01:40:24,769 --> 01:40:26,601
' Get up! Come on!
- Okay.

1663
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:29,186
You got me.

1664
01:40:29,273 --> 01:40:31,435
Those things are really dangerous!

1665
01:40:33,194 --> 01:40:35,401
<i>'</i> Come on!
- Go!

1666
01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:39,360
Get him in! Move it!

1667
01:40:43,788 --> 01:40:45,449
What is happening?

1668
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,781
Where are they?

1669
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:49,866
They should be
arriving any second.

1670
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:53,582
That is, if they're gonna
get here by midnight.

1671
01:41:02,807 --> 01:41:04,673
Ah!

1672
01:41:05,893 --> 01:41:08,260
Okay, feeling fear.

1673
01:41:08,646 --> 01:41:11,308
Fear. Anger, anger.

1674
01:41:12,024 --> 01:41:15,016
- Oh, full house!
- That's enough.

1675
01:41:16,654 --> 01:41:18,019
I was done.

1676
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:23,075
So nice to see you all again.

1677
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:28,655
But since we're such old friends,
let's skip the formalities.

1678
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:34,412
One of you
has something we require.

1679
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:37,706
So give it over.

1680
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:48,174
Nothing at all?

1681
01:41:49,437 --> 01:41:51,895
Really?

1682
01:41:53,691 --> 01:41:55,056
Sit down!

1683
01:42:02,283 --> 01:42:03,694
Let's go, let's go!

1684
01:42:04,952 --> 01:42:06,283
Let's go, let's go!

1685
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:08,953
Hurry up and move them quickly
before they can do anything.

1686
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,201
Get those lights off me!

1687
01:42:16,005 --> 01:42:17,541
Get on the plane!

1688
01:42:19,592 --> 01:42:21,754
Ow! Hey!

1689
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:25,388
Get on the plane!

1690
01:42:35,024 --> 01:42:36,264
- Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, hey!

1691
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:38,225
Yeah, uh, take off immediately.

1692
01:42:41,656 --> 01:42:44,273
You know, you make it almost too easy?

1693
01:42:44,367 --> 01:42:48,031
I mean, even your hilarious attempts
to make yourselves unpredictable,

1694
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:49,952
just follow the same pattern each time.

1695
01:42:50,039 --> 01:42:52,030
Set up, set up, set up.

1696
01:42:52,124 --> 01:42:53,364
Big reveal.

1697
01:42:53,459 --> 01:42:55,826
Which tonight was going
to be stroke of midnight,

1698
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:58,628
middle of the Thames?
Tell me if I'm warm.

1699
01:43:03,552 --> 01:43:07,341
Well, there will be a big reveal,
and it will come now.

1700
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:12,183
The stick, dear boy.

1701
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:14,010
- No.
- Fine.

1702
01:43:14,605 --> 01:43:16,812
Start with her.

1703
01:43:16,899 --> 01:43:19,186
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey!

1704
01:43:21,404 --> 01:43:24,772
- Give it to him.
- Danny, give him the card.

1705
01:43:24,865 --> 01:43:26,697
- Just give it to him.
- Danny, come on.

1706
01:43:36,752 --> 01:43:37,867
We'll have a closer look.

1707
01:43:46,345 --> 01:43:48,302
Okay, I owe you an apology.

1708
01:43:48,389 --> 01:43:50,676
Leader, you should have
planned an escape, okay?

1709
01:43:50,766 --> 01:43:52,411
- This is the both of us.
- Okay, it's the both of us.

1710
01:43:52,435 --> 01:43:53,925
- Guys, come on!
- Come on, stop!

1711
01:43:54,019 --> 01:43:56,807
- You, to save your little girlfriend!
- To save my...

1712
01:43:56,897 --> 01:43:59,138
- He had a knife to her head!
- I'm a Horseman, you dick!

1713
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:00,752
All right, you know what?
This is not the time!

1714
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:02,187
And you, what's your deal, man?

1715
01:44:02,278 --> 01:44:04,394
Look, they're not gonna get blood
all over the seats.

1716
01:44:04,488 --> 01:44:06,174
They're probably gonna
throw us out of the plane.

1717
01:44:06,198 --> 01:44:07,551
- Really?
- I'm sorry to interrupt,

1718
01:44:07,575 --> 01:44:09,657
but I just have to
say congratulations.

1719
01:44:09,744 --> 01:44:10,950
And thank you!

1720
01:44:12,538 --> 01:44:13,744
It's real.

1721
01:44:13,831 --> 01:44:15,242
What?

1722
01:44:15,332 --> 01:44:16,822
It's real?

1723
01:44:18,544 --> 01:44:19,579
Bring them through.

1724
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:20,751
Did you say it's real?

1725
01:44:20,838 --> 01:44:21,838
What is he talking about?

1726
01:44:21,922 --> 01:44:23,128
Move!

1727
01:44:23,215 --> 01:44:24,705
Well done, my boy.

1728
01:44:28,596 --> 01:44:31,008
Cote Du Marisule champagne.

1729
01:44:31,098 --> 01:44:35,183
It's the most expensive bottle on Earth.

1730
01:44:36,103 --> 01:44:38,219
$1.2 million.

1731
01:44:38,314 --> 01:44:42,308
And I saved it just for this occasion.

1732
01:44:42,401 --> 01:44:46,645
Honestly, same bottle,
Liquor Shack, 700K.

1733
01:44:46,739 --> 01:44:49,822
Hey. You got what you wanted.

1734
01:44:49,909 --> 01:44:52,446
So, does this mean
you're letting us go?

1735
01:44:52,536 --> 01:44:55,449
Knowing what you
know about us? No.

1736
01:44:55,539 --> 01:44:59,203
- You sure?
- Chase, what shall we do?

1737
01:45:01,003 --> 01:45:03,165
Toss them out.

1738
01:45:03,255 --> 01:45:05,792
Get your last words
in quickly, everybody!

1739
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:11,173
- No! Come on! No!
- Farewell.

1740
01:45:11,555 --> 01:45:13,762
Oh, God! No!

1741
01:45:15,059 --> 01:45:17,426
Wait! I just wanna say...

1742
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,761
I came into the world
with the wrong family,

1743
01:45:19,855 --> 01:45:21,812
but I'm leaving with the right one.

1744
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:23,435
I love you guys!

1745
01:45:23,526 --> 01:45:24,561
- No!
- No, no, no!

1746
01:45:26,403 --> 01:45:28,815
This is how I kicked
you out of the womb.

1747
01:45:28,906 --> 01:45:29,987
No!

1748
01:45:31,534 --> 01:45:32,865
Who's next?

1749
01:45:39,041 --> 01:45:40,873
No, wait! Let me go!

1750
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:43,292
Let go of me!

1751
01:45:43,379 --> 01:45:45,666
No, no, no!

1752
01:45:45,756 --> 01:45:47,417
- Let me go!
- Toss her!

1753
01:45:49,844 --> 01:45:52,757
Oh, God!

1754
01:45:52,847 --> 01:45:55,839
Hurry up and shut that door!
It's getting cold in here.

1755
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:57,844
Okay, hit the road, Jack!

1756
01:46:03,482 --> 01:46:04,597
No, no, no!

1757
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:08,267
A lot of brain,
but not enough brawn.

1758
01:46:12,074 --> 01:46:13,074
Oh, that was fun!

1759
01:46:15,953 --> 01:46:18,945
Cheers! Well done, my boy.

1760
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:24,791
Urn...

1761
01:46:24,879 --> 01:46:27,041
No, is it supposed to taste like that?

1762
01:46:27,172 --> 01:46:28,628
No, it is not.

1763
01:46:48,485 --> 01:46:50,021
What the hell is going on?

1764
01:47:00,039 --> 01:47:02,280
Okay, come pick them up!

1765
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,707
- Come on.
- Come on out.

1766
01:47:18,015 --> 01:47:21,849
<i>[announced
Ladies and gentlemen... The Horsemen!</i>

1767
01:47:42,206 --> 01:47:44,447
<i>No, you should feel pretty
good about yourself, man.</i>

1768
01:47:44,541 --> 01:47:48,079
<i>You predicted it correctly.
The Thames, stroke of midnight.</i>

1769
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:49,956
<i>New Year's Eve. Happy New Year!</i>

1770
01:47:57,012 --> 01:47:58,252
Unbelievable!

1771
01:47:58,347 --> 01:47:59,741
- We are moving now.
- The whole thing just changed.

1772
01:47:59,765 --> 01:48:02,507
- All backup into position stat!
- We're on the move.

1773
01:48:04,019 --> 01:48:06,226
- You're staying here!
- Of course.

1774
01:48:13,612 --> 01:48:15,444
Move! Move! Out of the way!

1775
01:48:15,531 --> 01:48:17,738
Wow! Thank you very much, London!

1776
01:48:17,825 --> 01:48:22,114
We would like to acknowledge not just
our old friend, Arthur Tressler.

1777
01:48:22,204 --> 01:48:24,741
But his young and very
brilliant son, Walter Mabry.

1778
01:48:24,832 --> 01:48:27,244
Who has performed one of the
greatest feats of illusion

1779
01:48:27,334 --> 01:48:28,950
even we have ever seen.

1780
01:48:29,044 --> 01:48:33,254
He has, amazingly, brought
himself back from the dead!

1781
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:35,957
But before he did that,

1782
01:48:36,051 --> 01:48:37,382
he revealed someone.

1783
01:48:37,469 --> 01:48:42,589
And we think it only right
to give him a proper introduction.

1784
01:48:42,683 --> 01:48:46,677
He is our friend and he is our leader.
Dylan Shrike!

1785
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:48,761
- Get over here!
- Yeah!

1786
01:48:54,653 --> 01:48:56,690
So, normally

1787
01:48:56,780 --> 01:49:01,490
only the magician, his assistant,
and a few trusted stage hands

1788
01:49:01,577 --> 01:49:03,784
know the secret of a trick.

1789
01:49:03,871 --> 01:49:06,863
But tonight, however, in this effect,

1790
01:49:06,957 --> 01:49:10,040
all of you people
around the Thames here.

1791
01:49:10,127 --> 01:49:14,746
And since we're streaming live,
everyone around the world

1792
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:17,332
already knows everything.

1793
01:49:17,426 --> 01:49:21,511
And only these fellows
here are the ones left in the dark.

1794
01:49:21,597 --> 01:49:24,510
So let's see how closely
you were watching our shows.

1795
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:28,309
Remember when we were playing
"Find the Lady," and I said

1796
01:49:28,395 --> 01:49:30,306
<i>that we used a Barry Trap.</i>

1797
01:49:31,106 --> 01:49:34,690
<i>Some classic switches
and a few duplicates?</i>

1798
01:49:34,777 --> 01:49:38,270
<i>Well, that's how we switched
the driver of the truck.</i>

1799
01:49:41,366 --> 01:49:43,607
<i>Which took us to a duplicate hangar</i>

1800
01:49:43,702 --> 01:49:46,239
<i>where we used your need to rush,</i>

1801
01:49:46,330 --> 01:49:49,322
<i>and your fear of being seen
let you do the work for us.</i>

1802
01:49:49,416 --> 01:49:51,202
Get those lights off me!

1803
01:49:52,503 --> 01:49:56,747
So, the airplane.
How did we get it to fly?

1804
01:49:57,841 --> 01:50:02,631
<i>Well, we used fans,
and lights and rain machines.</i>

1805
01:50:07,893 --> 01:50:12,512
Obviously, all of this was
reliant on us getting caught.

1806
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:13,892
But we needed to make sure

1807
01:50:13,982 --> 01:50:16,064
that you would do exactly
what we needed you to do

1808
01:50:16,151 --> 01:50:17,641
once you did catch us.

1809
01:50:17,736 --> 01:50:23,778
My brother Chase, who was
technical adviser to the losing team.

1810
01:50:23,867 --> 01:50:26,529
He taught us that it's
all about blind spots.

1811
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:28,156
I know where you're going!

1812
01:50:28,247 --> 01:50:31,831
And, uh, surprises.

1813
01:50:33,669 --> 01:50:35,205
Watch it, hobo.

1814
01:50:35,295 --> 01:50:36,956
Why don't you watch
the watch I'm wearing,

1815
01:50:37,047 --> 01:50:39,664
the where of where
you're watching, and sleep!

1816
01:50:39,758 --> 01:50:43,092
It's going to be your idea to throw
the Horsemen out of the plane.

1817
01:50:43,178 --> 01:50:45,636
If all of this is
kind of confusing to you,

1818
01:50:45,722 --> 01:50:47,679
I can maybe catch you up on it later.

1819
01:50:47,766 --> 01:50:50,178
Probably see you what, three to five?

1820
01:50:51,353 --> 01:50:55,722
Come on, put it there.
Hey! Tit for tat, bro!

1821
01:50:56,275 --> 01:50:59,233
Basically, we showed them everything.

1822
01:50:59,319 --> 01:51:04,610
How you kidnapped us to steal the very
thing that is in your pocket right now.

1823
01:51:06,827 --> 01:51:08,192
Whoops!

1824
01:51:11,832 --> 01:51:14,290
You know, this thing here,

1825
01:51:14,376 --> 01:51:17,835
which you said you could
use to adjust markets,

1826
01:51:17,921 --> 01:51:21,585
manipulate governments,
and spy on whomever you choose.

1827
01:51:21,675 --> 01:51:23,507
Also, you could, as you said,

1828
01:51:23,594 --> 01:51:26,757
control the public
from outside the grid.

1829
01:51:27,681 --> 01:51:32,972
These men destroy people's lives.

1830
01:51:33,061 --> 01:51:37,100
Spying on the world, robbing you
of your right to privacy.

1831
01:51:37,191 --> 01:51:40,434
And they do that
by hiding in the dark.

1832
01:51:40,527 --> 01:51:45,067
So, in the Horsemen tradition,
we're here to expose them.

1833
01:51:45,157 --> 01:51:50,197
Tonight, they, like all of us,

1834
01:51:50,287 --> 01:51:53,450
are finally stepping into the light.

1835
01:51:57,419 --> 01:51:58,580
Thank you, everybody!

1836
01:51:58,670 --> 01:52:01,287
We are the Horsemen
and we will be back very soon!

1837
01:52:03,592 --> 01:52:07,586
Five, four, three, two, one!

1838
01:52:24,446 --> 01:52:27,029
- Hey, we're on the clock.
- Get a move on.

1839
01:52:30,118 --> 01:52:31,233
There they are!

1840
01:52:31,328 --> 01:52:33,365
- There's more inside.
- Don't you bloody touch me!

1841
01:52:33,455 --> 01:52:35,116
The Horsemen are over on the...

1842
01:52:37,918 --> 01:52:39,374
Oh, shit!

1843
01:52:40,045 --> 01:52:41,831
Stay with them!

1844
01:52:41,922 --> 01:52:43,913
Everybody spread out!

1845
01:52:44,007 --> 01:52:45,839
Nobody leaves this barge!

1846
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:50,844
Rhodes, hold it right there!
Do not move!

1847
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,181
This contains everything.

1848
01:52:58,272 --> 01:53:01,355
Not just Walter and Tressler,
but all their dealings.

1849
01:53:01,441 --> 01:53:04,433
All their contacts,
the entire network.

1850
01:53:04,528 --> 01:53:06,735
And why on Earth
would I believe you?

1851
01:53:06,822 --> 01:53:10,486
I told you.
I'm the same man I've always been.

1852
01:53:10,575 --> 01:53:13,033
Move it! Come on!
Let's go, go, go!

1853
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:15,908
I'm not part of this
organization! I'm Merritt.

1854
01:53:15,998 --> 01:53:19,207
Rm a patsy!
Rm a patsy!

1855
01:53:20,127 --> 01:53:21,993
Ten minutes.

1856
01:53:23,797 --> 01:53:25,834
Now you're playing
the long game.

1857
01:53:39,730 --> 01:53:41,937
Dad, I promise you I will fix this.

1858
01:53:42,024 --> 01:53:44,391
You can't. Stop calling me dad.

1859
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:48,398
There were so many women,
I have no idea whose bastard you are.

1860
01:53:48,488 --> 01:53:49,603
What?

1861
01:53:49,698 --> 01:53:52,030
- What happened?
- Thin air, gone. Come with me.

1862
01:53:52,117 --> 01:53:55,735
What're you talking about, gone?
People don't just disappear.

1863
01:53:55,829 --> 01:53:58,537
You realize that he doesn't actually
have magical powers!

1864
01:54:38,246 --> 01:54:39,657
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

1865
01:54:39,748 --> 01:54:42,160
- Good to see you all.
- Good to see you, Li.

1866
01:54:43,293 --> 01:54:44,408
Come on in.

1867
01:54:47,672 --> 01:54:50,505
Good morning. Welcome.

1868
01:54:52,969 --> 01:54:56,507
I'm proud of you.
All of you.

1869
01:54:56,598 --> 01:55:00,091
I have a lot to show you. Come.

1870
01:55:01,353 --> 01:55:02,593
Come.

1871
01:55:13,949 --> 01:55:15,155
Dad.

1872
01:55:32,592 --> 01:55:34,208
Yes.

1873
01:55:34,302 --> 01:55:37,044
Your father and I were partners.

1874
01:55:37,139 --> 01:55:40,257
Our act was that of rivals.

1875
01:55:41,476 --> 01:55:47,097
I was the hard-eyed realist.
He was the dreamy-eyed idealist.

1876
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:49,898
We thought it was the perfect misdirect.

1877
01:55:50,986 --> 01:55:54,650
Yes, in public, I did goad him.

1878
01:55:54,739 --> 01:55:59,575
The only thing we didn't count on
was it going so wrong.

1879
01:56:03,582 --> 01:56:05,414
Why?

1880
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:07,241
Why didn't you ever say anything to me?

1881
01:56:07,335 --> 01:56:08,825
I don't know.

1882
01:56:10,005 --> 01:56:11,291
Give it a name.

1883
01:56:11,381 --> 01:56:14,794
Shame, guilt. Regret.

1884
01:56:18,555 --> 01:56:21,513
Hey, guys, uh, you might
wanna come take a look at this.

1885
01:56:23,185 --> 01:56:24,220
Hmm.

1886
01:56:25,729 --> 01:56:26,935
Look.

1887
01:56:27,022 --> 01:56:28,808
<i>I put you in jail, man.</i>

1888
01:56:28,899 --> 01:56:31,231
Why didn't you
say something then?

1889
01:56:31,318 --> 01:56:34,310
Well, you know, I was going to.

1890
01:56:34,404 --> 01:56:39,023
But then, you were so quick to show
your personal motivations that...

1891
01:56:40,327 --> 01:56:43,695
Well, quite frankly
it spoiled the trick for me.

1892
01:56:43,788 --> 01:56:45,074
I showed my weakness.

1893
01:56:45,165 --> 01:56:47,953
Well, it showed you weren't ready.

1894
01:56:48,043 --> 01:56:50,660
But when you came back to my cell,

1895
01:56:50,754 --> 01:56:55,169
you had let go of your
30-year vendetta against me...

1896
01:56:56,176 --> 01:56:57,632
for your Horsemen.

1897
01:56:59,221 --> 01:57:03,931
<i>And I said to myself,
"That's Lionel's boy."</i>

1898
01:57:04,809 --> 01:57:08,177
<i>And I knew it was my job to see to it</i>

1899
01:57:08,271 --> 01:57:11,980
<i>that he became the magician
he was born to be.</i>

1900
01:57:12,067 --> 01:57:14,399
All that was left then was...

1901
01:57:16,154 --> 01:57:17,485
For me to hit bottom.

1902
01:57:18,281 --> 01:57:23,117
So the safe, my father's wristwatch,
that was all you?

1903
01:57:25,914 --> 01:57:29,248
<i>Walter and Tressler,
were they in on it too?</i>

1904
01:57:29,334 --> 01:57:32,167
<i>Oh, we knew
Walter was in hiding.</i>

1905
01:57:32,254 --> 01:57:35,963
<i>The Octa show was a setup
to expose him to the public.</i>

1906
01:57:37,676 --> 01:57:41,135
<i>And you were right
about the Horsemen.</i>

1907
01:57:41,221 --> 01:57:46,261
<i>They needed to learn to work together
like a single organism.</i>

1908
01:57:53,942 --> 01:57:56,559
Now I know why
you look so familiar.

1909
01:57:56,653 --> 01:57:58,235
You're the Horsemen, aren't you?

1910
01:58:05,954 --> 01:58:07,365
Okay.

1911
01:58:07,455 --> 01:58:09,492
<i>But that can't be
what all this is about.</i>

1912
01:58:09,583 --> 01:58:14,077
You know, the best tricks
work on many levels.

1913
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:18,129
And the deepest one,
for me, at least,

1914
01:58:18,216 --> 01:58:21,004
is this moment right here.

1915
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:26,129
I'm sorry, Dylan.

1916
01:58:26,808 --> 01:58:29,300
I miss your father.

1917
01:58:29,394 --> 01:58:32,887
Thirty years is a long time to drag
something around, isn't it?

1918
01:58:32,981 --> 01:58:34,642
Yes, it is.

1919
01:58:44,618 --> 01:58:45,858
So, now what?

1920
01:58:48,330 --> 01:58:51,197
- Now I'm about out of moves.
- Oh...

1921
01:58:51,291 --> 01:58:52,622
And I'm tired.

1922
01:58:52,709 --> 01:58:55,104
Come on, you're the one who said
that you believe that this road

1923
01:58:55,128 --> 01:58:57,085
led to the great wizard
behind the curtain.

1924
01:58:57,172 --> 01:58:58,207
I did.

1925
01:58:58,298 --> 01:59:00,414
And that you'd finally
get to look him in the eyes.

1926
01:59:01,843 --> 01:59:03,504
Lam.

1927
01:59:09,309 --> 01:59:11,767
It's your game now.

1928
01:59:11,853 --> 01:59:14,436
You play it however you see fit.

1929
01:59:15,690 --> 01:59:21,527
My suggestion, however, is that
you find yourself a successor.

1930
01:59:21,613 --> 01:59:23,479
Hi. Okay, so, um...

1931
01:59:23,573 --> 01:59:26,861
Well, obviously,
we have a few questions. Right?

1932
01:59:26,951 --> 01:59:29,443
Uh... By "a few,"
I think he means, like, five million.

1933
01:59:29,537 --> 01:59:31,073
- Yeah.
- Well.

1934
01:59:31,164 --> 01:59:32,996
Good luck to you all.

1935
01:59:33,083 --> 01:59:34,699
- Okay. See, that's not fair.
- What!

1936
01:59:34,793 --> 01:59:35,936
- Come on.
- That's not right.

1937
01:59:35,960 --> 01:59:37,313
That's gonna make me really angry!

1938
01:59:37,337 --> 01:59:38,498
Not right now.

1939
01:59:38,588 --> 01:59:40,204
Oh, um, by the way...

1940
01:59:42,425 --> 01:59:44,917
Pay no attention to the curtain.

1941
01:59:47,847 --> 01:59:49,178
There is a curtain.

1942
01:59:49,265 --> 01:59:50,596
Go, go, go'

1943
01:59:59,984 --> 02:00:04,444
<i>Seeing is believing.
But is it truth?</i>

1944
02:00:04,531 --> 02:00:07,148
<i>Depends on your point of view.</i>

1945
02:00:07,242 --> 02:00:09,734
<i>Are you listening, Horsemen?</i>

1946
02:00:09,828 --> 02:00:14,163
<i>When you emerge, and you will,</i>

1947
02:00:14,249 --> 02:00:17,367
<i>I will be there waiting.</i>

1948
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:23,046
<i>Because mark my words,
you will get what's coming to you</i>

1949
02:00:23,133 --> 02:00:25,750
<i>in ways you can't expect.</i>

1950
02:00:26,636 --> 02:00:29,298
<i>But very much deserve.</i>

1951
02:00:29,389 --> 02:00:32,507
<i>Because one thing I believe in</i>

1952
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:36,468
<i>is an eye for an eye.</i>
