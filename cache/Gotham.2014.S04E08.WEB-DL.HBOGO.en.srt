1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,320
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,400
You can trust me.

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,600
We don't work for you,
and we don't work with you.

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,800
Your captain says otherwise.

5
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,640
So, Penguin's guys are gonna
beat and torture

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,720
their way through the city?

7
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,800
Get off of him.

8
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,760
You better pray I can clean up
your mess on this one, Harvey.

9
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,240
- It has to be a trap.
- Hey!

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,920
Oh, no, Patel.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,080
The Demonz.
They have a chop shop across town.

12
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,200
Let's hit it.

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,760
We've got a business to run.

14
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,720
I came here with Grundy.

15
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,440
Make some money
to get me smart again.

16
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,000
Hey, I'm looking for the person
in charge here.

17
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,760
You're looking at her. Hey.

18
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,880
Go get the doc.

19
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,960
Fight!

20
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,160
- Grundy fight now?
- Yes!

21
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes! Grundy Ed's best friend.

22
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,240
And now,

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,120
the most hated man in Gotham,

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,360
the Penguin!

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,160
I'm so happy to be here.

26
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,760
You love me. I knew you loved me.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,560
- You don't love me?
- Get out of here.

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,680
You don't love me?

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,600
You've asked for it.

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,120
I'm going to sic my lackeys onto you.

31
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,240
My hoods and the GCPD.!

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,600
Get 'em, boys.

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,520
Get 'em!

34
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,880
You awful Penguin. You awful Penguin.

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,680
You've got to do what I want

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,120
or they're gonna enter your homes
and terrorize your families.

37
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,480
Get 'em! Get 'em!

38
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,080
You do what I say.

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,080
Grundy. Grundy.

40
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,080
Grundy. Grundy.

41
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,360
- Let's see some blood!
- Yeah!

42
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,880
No! You leave me alone, you monster.

43
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,480
- Yeah!
- Tear him apart!

44
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,640
Stupid, lame...

45
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,520
Bird brain!

46
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,720
He'll never learn.

47
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,360
You can't mess with the Narrows!

48
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,640
It is time,

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,960
for the main event!

50
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,600
- Get him, Grundy!
- Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

51
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,080
A title defense.

52
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,880
No refs.

53
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,000
- No rules.
- No rules!

54
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,680
Our challenger,

55
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,480
Mr. Murder Face.

56
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,560
Yeah!

57
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,680
And our cham-peen.

58
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Straight from the Slaughter Swamp,
it's Solomon Grundy.

59
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,680
They really ate it up tonight.

60
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,120
I think they hate Penguin
almost as much as I do.

61
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,080
You know what,
I may or may not find a cure for you.

62
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,000
At the rate you're going,
may not have a chance.

63
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,960
What does that mean?

64
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,320
You don't just have these
people laughing.

65
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,000
You have them ready for a fight.

66
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,360
- So?
- So?

67
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,760
So, what happens
when Penguin hears about all this?

68
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,960
Well, let that bird waddle in here.

69
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,880
I have Grundy. I'm gonna be fine.

70
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,360
- And what about them? Your fans?
- Not my problem.

71
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,200
Ed, you've put yourself
on the front line of something.

72
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,680
You can't just bail
when fighting starts.

73
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,800
Okay, Doctor.

74
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,800
If you would like to stop
hiding from your past

75
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,400
and do some leading,
you go right ahead.

76
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,560
- That's not what I'm here for.
- Well, then, case closed.

77
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,000
Neither of us are willing
to put our necks out.

78
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Hey, Butch.

79
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,680
Yeah!

80
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
Yeah!

81
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
Hey, Butch.

82
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,080
Stop hitting yourself!

83
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,440
Stop hitting yourself!

84
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,720
Stop hitting yourself!

85
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,960
Stop hitting yourself!

86
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,640
Stop hitting yourself. I love this.

87
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,760
I love it!

88
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,880
Congratulations, Captain Gordon.

89
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,280
{\an5}A promotion.

90
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,960
{\an5}Harvey Bullock
is the captain of Gotham Central.

91
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,320
{\an5}Bullock's lost the rank and file,
Jim.

92
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,520
{\an5}The debacle in the Narrows.

93
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,320
{\an5}Teaming up with Penguin's goons.

94
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,880
{\an5}Sending cops into the Pyg's trap.

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,960
You know, he's, he's a disgrace.

96
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040
What does that make you?

97
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,160
{\an5}- Excuse me?
- Last time I checked,

98
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,200
{\an5}you signed over
the entire GCPD to Penguin.

99
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
Wholesale.

100
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,320
{\an5}- What does he think of this?
- Well, perhaps I've earned

101
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,440
{\an5}that kind of cynicism, Jim,

102
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,200
{\an5}but I want to assure you,
with hand on heart,

103
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,800
{\an5}that this has nothing to do
with Mr. Cobblepot.

104
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,160
{\an5}- I won't take Harvey's job.
- Someone is going to.

105
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,920
{\an5}And, trust me,
none of our other candidates

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,800
{\an5}share your misgivings about Penguin.

107
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,120
{\an5}And its... just take it with you.

108
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,160
{\an5}When you decide, all you have to do
is sign on the dotted line,

109
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,280
{\an5}and you'll be the new captain
of Gotham Central.

110
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,880
Nobody steals from the Demonz,
Mr. Penguin.

111
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,480
Why do I pony up for a license

112
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,240
{\an5}if some crook can just swoop in
and rip off our swag?

113
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,320
{\an5}Your swag might as well have been
a lollipop in a baby's hand.

114
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,600
{\an5}You admit it.
She admits it, Mr. Penguin.

115
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,600
{\an5}Oswald, what do you say we resolve
this like professionals?

116
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,560
{\an5}The ladies and I will take out
the rest of these so-called Demonz,

117
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,480
{\an5}and split their goods with you
fifty-fifty.

118
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,640
{\an5}Uncivilized, is what these girls are.

119
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,280
Outside the bounds
of a proper criminal society.

120
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,360
What?

121
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,200
Repeat that for my guests.

122
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,920
{\an5}Ed Nygma, who owes his life
to Mr. Cobblepot's mercy,

123
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,440
{\an5}is repaying that generosity

124
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,960
by aping his benefactor
in a crude <i>commedia dell'arte.</i>

125
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
What?

126
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,040
He is making fun of me
in a clown show in the Narrows!

127
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,160
Pretty funny.

128
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,520
The Riddler's doing a Penguin act.

129
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,680
That is not his name.

130
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,800
His name is Ed.

131
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,160
Plain, dumb Ed.

132
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,800
And you don't know him,
so you don't get to laugh.

133
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,600
Well, thank you, Oswald, for
clearing our account.

134
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,440
Not cleared, Babs.

135
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,400
The debt you owe him,
you now owe me.

136
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,680
Of course. What will it be?

137
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,720
Seeing as you love a good laugh,

138
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,760
I would like you to go to the Narrows
and see Ed's act for yourself.

139
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,040
Then I would like
you to bundle him up

140
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,000
and bring him back to me
by nightfall.

141
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,240
We're not your toadies.

142
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,280
Dear child, what was that you said?

143
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,080
What do we get if we bring you Nygma?

144
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,320
Very well.

145
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,640
In exchange, I will

146
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,520
not set every criminal
in the city after you.

147
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,680
I will not let them cut out your eyes
and feed 'em to you,

148
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,560
along with your ears, and then
your noses, and then your tongues.

149
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,840
That is what you get!

150
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,360
- Acceptable?
- Yes, Oswald.

151
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,160
That is acceptable.

152
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
Ladies.

153
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,440
Mr. Penn will put you in contact
with my Narrows informant.

154
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,360
If those three do not have Ed
in hand promptly,

155
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,600
you will go down there
and burn them all to cinders.

156
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,160
What about feeding them their eyes
and all that?

157
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,360
Trust me, it's a great idea...

158
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,040
but far too messy to be practical.

159
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,680
So, give me the scoop
on this Cherry's joint.

160
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,640
It's mainly crazy prize fights.
Chain saw matches and stuff.

161
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,880
But back in the day
we'd settle our beefs in the ring.

162
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,960
Winner takes all.

163
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,680
The code of the Narrows.

164
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,200
Right. Well, I want to get in,
grab Ed, deliver him to his doom,

165
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,080
and then go find a martini. Okay?

166
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,800
Hello? Earth to Tabby.

167
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,280
Sorry. Thinking about
getting my hands on him.

168
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,120
Yeah. As much as I hate
doing Penguin's dirty work,

169
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,480
this job is like
a little dream come true.

170
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,040
Gonna be Ed's nightmare.

171
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,240
Aren't we worried about him
setting a trap, though?

172
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
He's a genius.

173
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,600
Well, word is, Ed lost a step
when Penguin put him on ice.

174
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,440
But we should be ready for anything.

175
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,760
You insist on persisting
in this misbehavior,

176
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,520
you leave me no choice

177
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,680
but to scold you.

178
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,560
You've asked for it!

179
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,200
I'm going to sic my lackeys upon you.

180
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,920
Get 'em, boys. Get 'em.

181
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,280
- Grundy! Grundy!
- No! No, no, no, no!

182
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,640
Butch?

183
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
Butch.

184
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,440
It's Butch.
Do you know what this means?

185
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,120
Yeah. It means you owe me
an apology for electrocuting me.

186
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,960
I got to find a way
to go talk to him.

187
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,800
Have fun.

188
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,040
Tell him it was nothing personal
when I shot him in the head.

189
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,200
Wow. I have got to know
what is up with this outfit.

190
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,480
Grundy!

191
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,240
- Grundy! Grundy! Grundy!
- Come on.

192
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
Could've sworn we had a job
to do here.

193
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,760
Yeah, Grundy!

194
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Morning, Harv.

195
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,480
- Where have you been?
- Oh, sorry. Got stuck in traffic.

196
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
What you got there?

197
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,880
It's the Bullethole Club today.

198
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,800
These are the slugs they pulled
from the wounded cops

199
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,880
in the Narrows raid.

200
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,800
It was the Pyg that set the trap.

201
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,800
But I was the one
who sent those cops in.

202
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,240
Yeah. You did.

203
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,400
But now we got to move on.

204
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,440
And we got to catch the Pyg
before he can hurt somebody else.

205
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,520
Yeah.

206
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,600
Right.

207
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,960
Captain Bullock. Detective.

208
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,440
What's the word, Lucius?

209
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,480
The word is "absence," as in
all of Professor Pyg's crime scenes

210
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,960
demonstrate a marked absence
of useful physical evidence.

211
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,760
- How is that possible?
- He's a loony.

212
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
But a crafty one.

213
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,160
We have to dig deeper, try and
get ahead of whatever he's planning.

214
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,840
I'm at your disposal.

215
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,560
Hey, Jim.

216
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,000
About the Bullethole Club today.

217
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,080
I'd really appreciate it

218
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,400
if you could be there, too.

219
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,040
- It'd just help me a lot...
- Of course.

220
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,400
I know you have my back, partner.

221
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,280
Of course, Harv. I got your back.

222
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,560
- The Bullethole Club?
- Cops shot in the line of duty.

223
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,160
New members joining today.

224
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,040
- How's that work?
- It's unofficial.

225
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,840
Little ceremony at a bar.

226
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,880
Commanding officer hands them
the bullet they were shot with.

227
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,360
This batch,
cops wounded in Pyg's trap.

228
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,000
And Harvey has to give 'em
their bullets?

229
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,440
Yeah. Including the officer he shot.

230
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,800
No wonder he wants a friend there.

231
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,480
Yeah. No wonder.

232
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,400
Leave it to Ed Nygma
to find a way to turn his idiocy

233
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,680
into a tool for revenge.

234
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,040
And everything was running
so tidily.

235
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,360
Now, I have nothing but headaches.

236
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,760
No one appreciates
how hard it is to be a crime lord.

237
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,920
I did actually spend my childhood
being raised by one.

238
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,000
My very point.

239
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,360
In fact,

240
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,520
I thought we would have
lunch together

241
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,040
and talk over the vagaries
of this capricious calling.

242
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,960
I'd love to help,
but I have to see the caterer

243
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,280
for the orphanage fund-raiser.

244
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
Of course.

245
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,720
I can't expect you to be
at my beck and call.

246
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
You need a different source
of relaxation, Oswald.

247
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,360
You need chickens.

248
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,760
I'm sorry?

249
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,680
Do you remember my father's chickens?

250
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,320
I seem to recall the don's
predilection for poultry.

251
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,920
He understood that life
couldn't just be about business.

252
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,680
When his troubles were greatest,
he spent time with his birds.

253
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,520
You think I need chickens?

254
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,760
An interest outside the business.
Give it some thought.

255
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,840
We'll talk about it when I get back.

256
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
Chickens.

257
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,360
Chick, chick, chickens.

258
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
Loser!

259
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
Wedgie!

260
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
That must've hurt!

261
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,840
Grab him! Martin!
Squeeze his arm harder!

262
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,160
Boy!

263
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,080
Come here this instant.

264
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What do you think you're doing?

265
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,960
You cannot do things like that.

266
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,360
Your enemies will know it was you.

267
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,560
Grundy! Grundy!

268
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,920
Grundy! Grundy!

269
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Butch.

270
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,040
- You're alive.
- Huh?

271
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Oh, Butch.

272
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
What happened to you?

273
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
Guess who.

274
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,520
Psycho-killer stalker?

275
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,360
Got it in one.

276
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,280
Please. If you were gonna pop,
you'd have done it already.

277
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,800
Whew, that felt good.

278
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,040
Been waiting a long time to do that.

279
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,960
- Other cheek?
- I'm good, thanks.

280
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,480
So, what are you doing down here,
Barbara?

281
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,440
This is a low-rent neighborhood
for you.

282
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,800
Yeah. If it wasn't for Penguin,
you wouldn't catch me dead

283
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,120
in a place like this.

284
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,480
You're working as Penguin's flunky.

285
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
That suits you.

286
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,520
Yes, and you seem to be thriving
with your current life choices.

287
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,760
We don't all make decisions
based on what it can get us.

288
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,600
There are other people in the world.

289
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,200
Wow. Sexy and self-righteous.

290
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,960
What does Jim think of this new you?

291
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
Jim who?

292
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,720
Well, I have to go see a man
about a kidnapping.

293
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,440
But this has been interesting.

294
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
Toodles, poodle.

295
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,880
Kidnapping. Oh, crap.

296
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,120
- You play a great Penguin, mister.
- Yeah. Sure, sure. Thanks, kid.

297
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,240
Oh, crud.

298
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,400
I thought you were supposed
to be smart.

299
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,760
Relax, Jim, no one followed me.

300
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840
I have Oswald wrapped around
my finger.

301
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,960
If you have such a good grip on him,
explain that.

302
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,440
Why would he want me promoted?
What's his plan?

303
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,200
Oswald has nothing to do with this.

304
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,680
The commissioner and the mayor
can feel the winds changing,

305
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,960
and they want to be out
ahead of it before it blows.

306
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,280
It was you.

307
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,520
You put them up to this.

308
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,040
You must have made
a hell of a contribution

309
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,600
to get the mayor to defy Penguin.

310
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,600
No contribution necessary, Jim.

311
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,960
Just the Falcone name and
everything that it implies.

312
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,200
Well, I won't do it.

313
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,720
Not like this.

314
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,440
And not at Harvey's expense.

315
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,520
Harvey is weak.

316
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,360
How much longer do you plan on
propping him up?

317
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,560
And how many more cops need to die
because of his incompetence?

318
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,240
I need to go.

319
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,560
And you need to stop pretending
like you're not taking that job.

320
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,320
I'm not pretending.

321
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,760
So, you say, Jim, but I don't see

322
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,920
you rushing to throw that
piece of paper in the trash.

323
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,960
Come see me tonight.
After you take command.

324
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,040
We will celebrate.

325
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,000
Revenge is never as simple
as a mere tit for a tat.

326
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,560
Revenge must be specific in nature.
Now,

327
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,480
when you imagine revenge against
your two juvenile tormentors,

328
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
what do you see?

329
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,880
That might be a little overly
ambitious.

330
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,040
We must be crafty.

331
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,920
For instance, friendship can be
an especially deadly tactic.

332
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,600
How do you think
you might use friendship

333
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,280
to drive a wedge
between your two antagonists?

334
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,840
"They're both flunking math."

335
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,840
And you, I imagine,
are very good at math?

336
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,480
Excellent.

337
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,840
Tell me more.

338
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
Hey, Martin!

339
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,680
Thank you.

340
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,160
What's wrong, Martin?
Who did that to you?

341
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
Hey.

342
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
Why you picking on Martin?

343
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,240
You like that dummy so much,
go play with him.

344
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,240
- He's not a dummy!
- Yes, he is.

345
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,120
Well done.

346
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,640
Feels good, does it not?

347
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,080
Minions are so much better
than friends.

348
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,840
<i>"But I'm your..."</i>

349
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,680
The greatest friend I ever had
turned into my worst enemy.

350
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,880
Shun friendship.

351
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,920
You and I,

352
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,720
we're more than friends.

353
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,840
We're conspirators.

354
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,240
Are you not gonna fight back?

355
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Peekaboo.

356
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,040
Well, look at the little go-getter.

357
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,840
Yeah. Well, you and Tabby
decided to freak out,

358
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,280
so someone had to be
the professional.

359
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,600
Teenagers, Ed. Don't you love 'em?

360
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,280
Do you remember anything, Butch?

361
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,320
Do you remember anything about us?

362
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,760
Doesn't this mean anything to you?

363
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
Ed!

364
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,120
- Butch!
- Tell zombie Butch to back off.

365
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,360
- Grundy kill everyone!
- Butch!

366
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,960
- Ed is not your friend.
- Rip 'em to pieces!

367
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,840
- Butch!
- All right.

368
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,600
Everybody just take it easy.

369
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,400
Selina, what are you
doing with these two?

370
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,480
Looking for trouble.

371
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,400
Well, you found plenty of it,
trying to take Ed.

372
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,960
- Let him go.
- You're such a bleeding heart, Lee.

373
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,400
I thought you'd change,
but turns out,

374
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,280
just got a new hairdo.

375
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,160
Code of the Narrows.

376
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,240
Code of the Narrows.

377
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Let's settle it in the ring.

378
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,120
Champion against champion.
The winner would take Ed.

379
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
So, your best fighter against
my fighter?

380
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,320
Yeah, let's do that.

381
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,360
Honk-honk.

382
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,320
Honk-honk.

383
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,440
You, Narrows trash,
have been very, very naughty.

384
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,440
You've been hiding someone from me.

385
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,800
Don't listen to him.

386
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,880
He's not my friend.

387
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,360
No, Ed. No one's gonna save you.

388
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,280
Ed. Grundy.

389
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,120
- No one can save you.
- Save me!

390
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,120
Oh, no. Help.

391
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,440
Help. Help. Save me.

392
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,360
Ladies and Grundy fans.

393
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,720
Tonight is a special edition
of fight night.

394
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,120
A good old Narrows grudge match.

395
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,840
Winner takes...

396
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,840
me.

397
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,920
And featuring your cham-peen

398
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,880
Solomon Grundy...

399
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
...versus...

400
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,480
...Tabby, the Tigress.

401
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,560
Tabs, I know this was my idea, but...

402
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,640
No, it's okay.

403
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,560
Butch is still in there.
I know he is.

404
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,320
He loves me too much to hurt me.

405
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,480
Grundy kill!

406
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,120
Babe, I love your faith,

407
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,760
but I really think
you should take this.

408
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,640
No. He won't hurt me.

409
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I'll just choke him out, no problem.

410
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,160
Tabitha and Grundy were lovers
before he got this way.

411
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,520
What if he goes easy on her?

412
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Grundy will win.

413
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,480
Not that it makes a difference,
anyway.

414
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,200
What does that mean?

415
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,240
The Penguin wants Ed.

416
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
He's gonna get him.

417
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
Come on, Butch.

418
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,360
I know you could never forget me.

419
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,960
You're still in there, I know it.

420
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,560
Grundy!

421
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,120
Tabby, come on, Tabs.
Come on, get up.

422
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,600
Get up. Tabby, get up.

423
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,280
No. No, Butch.

424
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,200
- No, Butch!
- Tabs!

425
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Hey, Butch.

426
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,720
Tabby?

427
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,680
Butch?

428
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,480
No! No!

429
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,600
- I'll get you one more.
- Yeah.

430
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,800
I don't know what to tell you.

431
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,560
Come on, buddy.

432
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,200
Are you Detective Gordon?

433
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,360
Yeah.

434
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,120
Harvey said as how
I should give this to you.

435
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,080
Said you'd know what to do with it.

436
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,400
- When was he here?
- A couple hours ago.

437
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,560
Before you all started
coming in here.

438
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,880
Thanks.

439
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,280
Get up! Come on!

440
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,520
Grundy, get up.

441
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,240
Come on, Butch.
Come on, baby. Wake up.

442
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,720
- Come on, Butch. Come on, baby.
- Tabitha, we've got to go, now.

443
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,240
Ladies, let's amscray.

444
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,800
- Come on.
- I'll come back for you, Butch.

445
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,880
Come on.

446
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,920
What happened
to the code of the Narrows?

447
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,280
Give me up, Bra-Bra.

448
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,720
You're getting out of here
empty-handed.

449
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,120
In the name of Penguin,
everybody back the hell off.

450
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,520
Well, look at that, cavalry.

451
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,840
Not so fast.
Boss gave you a deadline.

452
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,680
- You missed it.
- So what?

453
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,360
We got Ed.
We are literally champions here.

454
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,640
What you are
is four courses of barbecue.

455
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,560
Crispy skin.

456
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,880
Grundy, wake up.

457
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
Grundy!

458
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Get up, big guy, come on.

459
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,000
Grundy Kill!

460
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,640
What's the matter, gruesome?

461
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,360
Afraid of fire?

462
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,400
Come on, Bridgit. Don't do this.
You're from the Narrows.

463
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,760
Yeah. And I couldn't be happier
to be out.

464
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,640
Penguin's right about this place.

465
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
It's a sewer.

466
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,520
Only way to kill the stink
is to burn it.

467
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
Hey, Firefly.

468
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,080
You're the only thing
that stinks around here.

469
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,480
You know what you've done?
Firefly's Penguin's enforcer.

470
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,680
And who's the one who got Firefly
down here, Cherry?

471
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,560
She informed on Ed to Penguin.

472
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,320
What?

473
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,720
- You're a snitch, Cherry.
- Shut up.

474
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,840
- You're over. It's done.
- Shut up.

475
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,640
This is my club. It's my turf.

476
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,040
You guys just do as you're told
like the scum you are.

477
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,440
They're the ones that are the
problem.

478
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,240
They work for the Penguin.

479
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,600
I would like to announce that
we just quit working for Penguin.

480
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,520
Yeah! Do it!

481
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,160
God, they sure love their
cold-blooded murder down here, huh?

482
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,480
Yeah, well, we better split
before they decide they want more.

483
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,560
Hey. It's okay, big guy.

484
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,520
Fire lady, she can't hurt you.

485
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,960
Grundy safe.

486
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Where were you, Harvey?

487
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,760
Hey, Jim.

488
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,200
I was just having a...

489
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,240
...little drinky-poo.

490
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,080
Why don't you join me?

491
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,760
- Not right now.
- Come on, Jim.

492
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,560
Don't be like that.
Come on, sit down,

493
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,880
and have a drink with me.

494
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,160
Those cops were waiting for you.

495
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,280
Yeah, to spit in my face.

496
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,640
If that's what they wanted to do,

497
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,560
you owed it to them to be there,

498
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,680
to stand in front of 'em,

499
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,800
look each one in the eye.

500
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
If you'd have done that...

501
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,800
...maybe you could have gotten
their respect.

502
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,320
I don't deserve their respect.

503
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,680
Jim, I shot Officer Patel.
What the hell was I supposed to do?

504
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,640
Stand in front of her
and hand her the bullet

505
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,640
that I shot her with,
that came from my gun?

506
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,720
That's the job.

507
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,760
Take responsibility for what happens
to your cops, that's the job.

508
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,200
So now,

509
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,480
you're telling me what the job is?

510
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,680
Yeah.

511
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,920
Well, today, Jim...

512
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,400
I just couldn't do the job.

513
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,440
So, I sent you,

514
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,240
because I knew you could.

515
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,240
It's not good enough.

516
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,800
Not today.

517
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,720
They needed you there.

518
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,720
Well,

519
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,560
ain't nothing I can do about it now.

520
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
You got a pen?

521
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,240
For what?

522
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,760
Harvey Bullock,
you are relieved of duty.

523
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,840
As of this moment, I'm assuming
the captaincy of Gotham Central.

524
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
Well, well.

525
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,720
Look who finally got
what he always wanted.

526
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,400
But what I'm wondering is,

527
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,640
what did you have to do to get it?

528
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,160
- All I did was my job, same as you.
- Nothing in Gotham is free...

529
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Captain Gordon.

530
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,840
You just better hope
you can pay up when your bill's due.

531
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,840
And it'll come due.

532
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,280
Huh? Now you try.

533
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,560
You've met Martin, I see.

534
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,080
He's practicing.

535
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,160
No. It's up.

536
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,600
Upward, Martin,
so that way you drive the blade

537
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,080
under the ribs and into the heart.

538
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,160
Oswald?

539
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,640
Entirely theoretically speaking,
of course.

540
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,400
Mr. Penn?

541
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,080
Urgent matters, Mr. Cobblepot.

542
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,120
It seems that Ms. Kean
and her associates have failed

543
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,560
to retrieve Mr. Nygma.

544
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,520
- Did you dispatch Firefly?
- I did.

545
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,120
And Ms. Firefly was herself,
in turn, disabled.

546
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,200
What?

547
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,160
There's more.

548
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,320
Yes?

549
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,440
The mayor, at his own discretion,
has seen fit

550
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,640
to promote Detective Gordon
to the rank of captain.

551
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,840
That is...

552
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,000
That is, quite a lot
to go awry in one day.

553
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,840
Very good, Mr. Cobblepot.

554
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,400
You see, Oswald?

555
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,280
Business is not the end-all of life.

556
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,320
There are other rewards to be had.

557
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,280
Companionship, peace of mind.

558
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
Friendship.

559
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,640
Oh, I have to get back to the estate.

560
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,200
I still have so much
to do for the fund-raiser.

561
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,800
Will you be joining me
later for dinner?

562
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,160
I think not.

563
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,280
- Martin needs some more practice.
- Okay.

564
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,960
Martin,

565
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,240
remind me.

566
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,880
What did we learn today?

567
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,400
What did we learn about friendship?

568
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,640
Exactly.

569
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,280
Sometimes,
if you're not very careful,

570
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,240
friendship can blind you to what
is staring you right in the face.

571
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,840
"Hey, Firefly.

572
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,320
You're the only thing
that stinks around here."

573
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,480
I get melodramatic under pressure.

574
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,880
How you feeling, big fella?

575
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,880
- Grundy confused.
- Yeah. Tell me about it.

576
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,440
What's with them?

577
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,560
They're, uh...

578
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,840
They're acknowledging
their new leader.

579
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,920
Well, like I said, they love you.

580
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,040
Lee, I'm supposed to be
the stupid one.

581
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,200
You heal their children.

582
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,040
You stitch up their warriors.

583
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,920
You've slain
a fire-breathing monster,

584
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
and you helped topple the queen.

585
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,240
This is your turf now.

586
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,160
No, no, no, no, no,
I am not a leader.

587
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,160
Okay, well, if you don't do it,
somebody else will,

588
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,240
probably worse than Cherry.

589
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,080
Where do I start?

590
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,640
I don't know. Just, make 'em happy,
give 'em something to cheer for.

591
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,280
Drinks on the house.

592
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,400
Good move.

593
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,280
Why, Captain Gordon,

594
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,040
you came to celebrate after all.

595
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,800
I'm not here to celebrate.

596
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,320
What's wrong?
I made you captain, didn't I?

597
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,320
You made me?

598
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,960
Is that what you think?

599
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Jim.

600
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,280
You can toy with Penguin all you
want, but I am not your puppet.

601
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,720
No, you're not. You're my partner.

602
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,760
Your partner?

603
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,280
I just stuck a knife
in my partner's back.

604
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,960
A mercy killing if you ask me.

605
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,120
Grow up.

606
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,160
You wanted a gangster
to help you get rid of Penguin.

607
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,000
This is what that help looks like.

608
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,160
Harvey had to go.

609
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,160
I don't need your help anymore.

610
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,760
I think it's time you left Gotham.

611
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,600
I'm not going anywhere, Jim.

612
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,280
I came to restore the Falcone name,

613
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,680
and that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

614
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,880
So, do you want to come in
and celebrate, Captain?

615
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,920
Think I'll stay out here
where I can breathe.
