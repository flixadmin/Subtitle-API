Stairs...

3
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:13,361
I don't think I can...

4
00:00:14,167 --> 00:00:17,740
Hey, guys,
just start without me.

5
00:00:18,532 --> 00:00:20,056
I'll catch up.

6
00:00:28,943 --> 00:00:30,624
Sweet.

7
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:54,416
Inner peace.
Inner peace.

8
00:00:55,683 --> 00:00:57,919
Itchy nose.

9
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:02,068
Ah-choo!

10
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:07,377
Finally, inner peace.

11
00:01:07,647 --> 00:01:09,132
Now, what?

12
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:23,070
Kai, old friend.

13
00:01:24,175 --> 00:01:26,227
Master Oogway.

14
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:29,584
Our battle ended 500 years ago.

15
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:32,080
Well, now I'm ready for a rematch.

16
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:34,899
Took you long enough.
Ha ha ha ha...

17
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:45,031
Yaaa!

18
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:51,399
You've grown stronger.

19
00:01:52,957 --> 00:01:54,953
(Chi)

20
00:01:56,266 --> 00:02:01,062
500 years in the Spirit Realm,
you pick up a thing or two.

21
00:02:01,086 --> 00:02:05,456
I have taken the Chi
of every Master here.

22
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,334
- No!
- Yes.

23
00:02:07,358 --> 00:02:09,958
And soon I will have your power too.

24
00:02:09,982 --> 00:02:15,348
When will you realize,
the more you take, the less you have.

25
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:39,329
With your Chi, I will finally
be able to return to the mortal world,

26
00:02:39,354 --> 00:02:43,112
And this time,
you won't be there to stop me.

27
00:02:43,136 --> 00:02:46,983
Ah, it was never
my destiny to stop you.

28
00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:50,691
I have set another on that path.

29
00:02:54,956 --> 00:03:00,110
Then I will find him,
and take his Chi too.

30
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:20,408
Justice, is about to be served.

We'll have two justice platters , please

34
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:16,302
- umm...three
- Three.
- And a few tofu buns.

35
00:04:16,303 --> 00:04:18,886
Oh , the spicy noodle soup for Tigress.
Did you want extra sauce with that?

36
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:19,979
She wants it on the side

37
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,865
- On the side
-On the side

38
00:04:23,026 --> 00:04:24,416
Dragon, you can do it.

39
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:27,620
- Go, Dragon Warrior.
- Defend the valley.

40
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,476
Go Dragon Warrior
- Yeah, defend the valley

41
00:04:35,624 --> 00:04:38,453
Yee-ha!

42
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,547
You guys aren't doing
the dramatic pose , are you?

43
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:43,080
Do we have to strike a pose
every time we land?

44
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:46,206
You guys, never underestimate
the power of a dramatic entrance.

45
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,512
I've heard about some Masters who could win
a fight just by throwing open a door

46
00:04:49,536 --> 00:04:51,840
Shuh-sha!

47
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:53,560
Dramatic entrance?

48
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,502
Master Shifu

49
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,525
The Dragon Warrior is correct.

50
00:04:56,526 --> 00:05:00,055
Really? I was just making....
yeah, I mean, yeah, I am.

51
00:05:00,056 --> 00:05:03,172
Before the battle of the fist
comes the battle of the mind.

52
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:06,494
Hence... the dramatic entrance.

53
00:05:16,264 --> 00:05:19,409
Whoa ,nice dramatic entrance.

54
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,978
-What's the occasion?
-Today will be my final class.

55
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:26,429
Your final...? Wait.
I didn't even know you were sick

56
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,339
Although you have been looking a little....
-I'm not sick.

57
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,109
healthy. A little healthy.
A lot actually

58
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:34,007
My final class because from now on...

59
00:05:34,008 --> 00:05:38,860
your training will be in the
hands of the Dragon Warrior.

60
00:05:40,352 --> 00:05:42,138
What?

61
00:05:43,445 --> 00:05:46,778
Me? teach?I mean why not Tigress?
She's always telling everyone what to do.

62
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:48,836
- Be quiet Po.
-See what I mean?

63
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:51,895
Tigress is not the Dragon Warrior.
You are.

64
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,150
Come on they're theFfive.
What can I teach them?

65
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,211
There is always something more to learn.
Even for a Master.

66
00:05:59,212 --> 00:06:02,669
For instance ,
let me show you another move.

67
00:06:02,693 --> 00:06:05,186
The dramatic exit.

68
00:06:05,187 --> 00:06:06,938
What's that?

69
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:09,478
Whoa!

70
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:12,159
Are you kidding me?
That....what?

71
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,391
- Where'd he go?
- Master.

72
00:06:16,015 --> 00:06:20,206
He's gone guys. It's cool.
- We await your instruction, Master.

73
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:23,932
All you have to lose is our respect.

74
00:06:26,315 --> 00:06:28,972
Seriously, how bad could it be?

75
00:06:28,996 --> 00:06:30,966
Very bad!
Very, very bad!

76
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,615
Okay. Okay, let's switch it up.
Monkey, Immovable Mountain Stance.

77
00:06:34,638 --> 00:06:36,250
Yes, Master.

78
00:06:36,424 --> 00:06:40,960
I mean.... Tigress, Tornado back flip
- Yes, Master

79
00:06:42,092 --> 00:06:44,381
- Oh no, fire.
- Fire

80
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:48,307
Sorry, my fault
Crane go high, I mean low

81
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,663
Oh, my claw thingy

82
00:06:50,688 --> 00:06:54,094
Uh, Viper and tigress , to...
like a totem pole

83
00:06:54,118 --> 00:06:56,037
Poison , Technique.

84
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,668
You two, to...
Sworming insect bite with yellow tail , Yellow jacket...

85
00:07:00,692 --> 00:07:03,110
Spicy....tuna

86
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:10,996
Good job, Po.

87
00:07:11,988 --> 00:07:13,161
Ah.

88
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:15,535
Did you at least learn
a little something?

89
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:18,334
Yes , that you can't teach.

90
00:07:18,335 --> 00:07:21,443
And tigress is flammable, turns out.

91
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:29,978
That was a complete disaster.

92
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:33,066
I'm glad we're not Po right now.
-What a loser

93
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:36,647
- What was Shifu thinking?
- What was Oogway thinking?

94
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:43,159
- I think he heard us.
- I didn't hear anything.

95
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,760
He said you're a loser

96
00:07:56,862 --> 00:07:58,869
Sorry, Oogway.

97
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:04,034
- Would you stop doing that?
- How was your fisrt day teaching?

98
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:06,221
- Humiliating.
- I heard.

99
00:08:06,222 --> 00:08:07,888
Who told you?
Did Tigress tell you?

100
00:08:07,912 --> 00:08:12,759
I heard from Monkey and Crane and Mantis and
your dad and Mrs. Chau from the gift shop

101
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:16,273
And those ducks who just passed
and Tigress told me.

102
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:19,299
Yeah, well did she also tell you that it'll never
happen again cause I'm done?

103
00:08:19,322 --> 00:08:21,460
Teaching , or being humiliated?

104
00:08:21,484 --> 00:08:24,396
Both. I don't know why you ever thought
I could teach that class?

105
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,961
Oh, I knew you couldn't.

106
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:28,980
What? You set me up to fail?
Why?

107
00:08:28,981 --> 00:08:33,840
If you only do what you can do
you'll never be more than you are now.

108
00:08:33,864 --> 00:08:36,547
I don't wanna be more
I like who I am.

109
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:39,271
You don't even know who you are.

110
00:08:39,272 --> 00:08:42,475
What do you....? Of course I do
I'm the Dragon Warrior.

111
00:08:42,476 --> 00:08:46,350
And what exactly does
that mean Dragon Warrior?

112
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:53,024
It means...you know... just going around
and punching and kicking

113
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:55,643
Defending the valley and stuff.

114
00:08:55,644 --> 00:08:57,329
Punching and kicking?

115
00:08:57,352 --> 00:09:01,359
You think that is what the
great Master Oogway saw for you?

116
00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:05,622
A five hundred year prophecy full-filled so
you can spend your days...

117
00:09:05,647 --> 00:09:09,791
Kicking butt?
And running through town high-fiving bunnies?

118
00:09:09,814 --> 00:09:11,577
- Yes.
- No!

119
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,968
Oogway saw greatness in you, Po,
against my better judgement.

120
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:20,010
More than you can see in yourself.

121
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:23,418
Incredible power awaits you

122
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,224
Power beyond anything you can imagine.

123
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:43,573
Whoa!

124
00:09:43,602 --> 00:09:46,300
What was that?
-That was chi.

125
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:48,775
Whoa!
What's chi?

126
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:53,599
The energy that flows
through all living things.

127
00:09:53,623 --> 00:09:56,952
So you're saying if I, so you're saying if I teach,
I'll be able to do cool stuff like that?

128
00:09:56,976 --> 00:10:01,426
No I'm saying if you teach,
I'll be able to do cool stuff like that.

129
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,492
- Oh.
- Mastery of chi requires Mastery of self

130
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:11,150
Oogway sat alone in a cave
for thirty years asking one question....

131
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:12,972
Who am I?

132
00:10:12,973 --> 00:10:14,594
Who am I?

133
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:18,056
I'm lucky if I get 5 minutes
before you interrupt .

134
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,261
So now I have to sit alone
in a cave for thirty years?

135
00:10:20,262 --> 00:10:23,129
Eventually.
After you Master teaching

136
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,228
Teaching? There's no way
I'm ever gonna be like you.

137
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,456
I'm not trying to turn you into me.

138
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,241
I'm trying to turn you into you.

139
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,408
Turn me into me?
Wait a second. That makes no....(sense)

140
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:43,021
Almost there Shifu , just a little more confusing
and you'll be the next Oogway.

141
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:44,800
Oh.
Ah.

142
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:48,205
Sorry, no offense Master Oogway
I just....

143
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,086
I'll let you get back
to your eternal peace.

144
00:11:29,802 --> 00:11:33,980
- What is this place?
-Aaah...my brother's farm?

145
00:11:34,003 --> 00:11:38,891
Ah.
If I stepped on you, would you die?

146
00:11:39,418 --> 00:11:41,432
Yes.

147
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:44,345
The mortal realm.

148
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:48,123
You hear that Oogway?
I'm back.

149
00:11:48,146 --> 00:11:51,934
Kai has returned.

150
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,763
- Who?
- Kai. General Kai.

151
00:11:55,786 --> 00:11:59,020
Supreme warlord of all China

152
00:11:59,172 --> 00:12:00,374
I don't know.

153
00:12:00,398 --> 00:12:04,121
The jade slayer,
Master of pain

154
00:12:04,145 --> 00:12:07,053
You may know me
as the beast of vengeance

155
00:12:07,077 --> 00:12:09,056
Maker of widows?

156
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,680
Ok, I used to work with Oogway.

157
00:12:12,705 --> 00:12:15,621
Oh, Master Oogway, he
was a great warrior.

158
00:12:15,644 --> 00:12:18,242
- We've heard of Master Oogway. Wise and...
- Ok, ok, enough.

159
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:19,993
Silence!

160
00:12:26,374 --> 00:12:30,255
Find Oogway's students
and bring them to me.

161
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,932
By the time I am done
with them, Oogway...

162
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:43,557
There will be no one left to
who will even remember your name.

163
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:47,674
Ha ha ha!
Kai is coming!

164
00:12:49,753 --> 00:12:51,847
I am ready...

165
00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:54,319
- to teach you a lesson.
-Teach me?

166
00:12:54,344 --> 00:12:57,552
- Oh no, ite's the Dragon teacher
- Yeah he's so handsome.

167
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,553
Thank you for the compliment.

168
00:13:01,207 --> 00:13:04,569
No, please don't teach me to death

169
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:05,974
Po?

170
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:08,148
Oh, hey dad
What's up?

171
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:12,743
I like just ....
stopping by for a little soak.

172
00:13:15,865 --> 00:13:18,175
- Okay , What's wrong?
- Nothing

173
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:21,837
Nothing? I come home to find you taking a
bath with your dolls...

174
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:24,515
- Action figures.
-And instead of adding bath-salt to the water.

175
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:28,206
- You just added szechuan peppercorns.
- Szechuan, what?

176
00:13:28,455 --> 00:13:31,054
Oh, oh, oh... my tenders.

177
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,526
Okay, yes, something's wrong

178
00:13:34,551 --> 00:13:37,549
There, there, son , you tell
your daddy all about it

179
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:39,001
Lift your arm

180
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:41,947
Shifu says I don't know what
it means to be the Dragon Warrior.

181
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:44,138
And now I have to be a teacher?

182
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:45,798
I thought I finally knew who I was.

183
00:13:45,822 --> 00:13:47,872
If I'm not the dragon Warrior,
then who am I?

184
00:13:47,873 --> 00:13:50,420
A teacher?
Teaching kung fu?

185
00:13:50,444 --> 00:13:53,675
Po, that's a promotion.
Take the job, son

186
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:59,780
And someday, when you're in charge of the whole
Jade palace, I can sell noodles in the lobby. Yoohoo.

187
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:03,801
Why are you still here taking a bath like a baby?
Get out. Get up. Go, go, go.

188
00:14:03,824 --> 00:14:08,057
- Franchise expansion awaits us!
- What about the Dragon Warrior look alike contest?

189
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:11,524
- Mrs. Chau always wins that.
- Skadoosh

190
00:14:11,548 --> 00:14:13,824
And the Dragon Warrior dumpling eating contest?

191
00:14:13,848 --> 00:14:15,187
I have to defend my title

192
00:14:15,211 --> 00:14:17,530
No one's gonna beat your
dumpling eating record.

193
00:14:17,554 --> 00:14:20,494
Someone's about to beat your
dumpling eating record.

194
00:14:20,604 --> 00:14:22,641
Go. Go. Go.

195
00:14:22,664 --> 00:14:25,881
- Who's eating my dumplings?
- And who's paying for them?

196
00:14:25,882 --> 00:14:29,728
101, 102

197
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:39,901
Li : 103.

198
00:14:43,411 --> 00:14:44,663
Yeah!

199
00:14:44,687 --> 00:14:46,602
Is that a new record?

200
00:14:46,626 --> 00:14:48,327
Who are you?

201
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:51,480
- I'm Li Shan
- What?

202
00:14:53,619 --> 00:14:55,901
I'm Li shan.

203
00:14:55,925 --> 00:14:58,496
I'm looking for my son.

204
00:15:01,538 --> 00:15:06,743
- You lost your son?
- Yes, many years ago.

205
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:10,590
- I lost my father
- Very sorry

206
00:15:10,614 --> 00:15:12,475
Thank you.

207
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:17,576
Well , good luck to you.

208
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,066
You too.
I hope you find your son.

209
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:24,625
And I hope you find your father

210
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,888
- Son?
- Huh?

211
00:15:34,912 --> 00:15:38,047
Oh my gosh, it is you.

212
00:15:38,072 --> 00:15:41,409
Well, don't just stand there!
Give your old man a hug!

213
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,629
I can't believe you're alive.

214
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:47,543
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

215
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,636
I thought I'd lost you forever,
Little Lotus.

216
00:15:53,637 --> 00:15:56,226
Oh, Okay.
This is very embarrassing,

217
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,774
but I think you've got me confused with
a panda named Lotus. My name is Po.

218
00:15:59,774 --> 00:16:02,815
Oh right, you wouldn't... Okay

219
00:16:02,816 --> 00:16:06,018
See, Little Lotus was the name
you were given at birth.

220
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:07,332
- Really?
-Really.

221
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,248
I can't believe it. After all these
years and you're really here?

222
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:11,907
This is amazing.

223
00:16:11,908 --> 00:16:14,427
Oh, Dad.
Come say hi to...

224
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,562
Um. I don't know- I don't know
what I'm supposed to call you.

225
00:16:17,586 --> 00:16:19,723
I'm pretty sure he
said his name is Li.

226
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:23,559
You...come here

227
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:27,884
Thank you, thank you for taking
such good care of my son.

228
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:31,072
Your son?
Now hold on just a minute.

229
00:16:31,097 --> 00:16:34,771
How do we know this stranger
is even related to you?

230
00:16:34,772 --> 00:16:38,674
Look at that.
Our bellies could be brothers.

231
00:16:38,675 --> 00:16:41,702
Hey son, let me teach you how to Belly Gong.
All right, belly gong

232
00:16:41,726 --> 00:16:43,600
That's so cool.
They jiggle the same.

233
00:16:43,624 --> 00:16:46,330
It's like looking in a fat mirror.

234
00:16:48,265 --> 00:16:50,845
I can't believe we're taking
a picture together.

235
00:16:54,311 --> 00:16:58,734
But I still don't understand.
I thought Po was the only panda left.

236
00:16:58,758 --> 00:17:02,180
- No, there's a whole bunch of us.
- Where?

237
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:06,380
- Here, a secret panda village in the mountains
- A secret panda....

238
00:17:06,404 --> 00:17:07,606
Whoa.

239
00:17:07,972 --> 00:17:09,817
But how did you
know where I was?

240
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,611
I received a message
that led me here.

241
00:17:12,636 --> 00:17:16,692
How could you receive a message
if no one could find you?

242
00:17:16,693 --> 00:17:18,917
Sounds suspicious to me.

243
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:21,742
No, wait, wait.
It was a message from the universe

244
00:17:21,765 --> 00:17:22,509
- Ooooooh!
- Whoa!

245
00:17:22,534 --> 00:17:23,780
- Whoa.
- Rats.

246
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:27,108
Now, what's all this about
a Dragon Warrior?

247
00:17:27,132 --> 00:17:31,177
How'd you know I was the Dragon Warrior?
Did the universe tell you that, too?

248
00:17:31,904 --> 00:17:36,085
No, the poster did, and the gift shop.
I bought a tiny cup.

249
00:17:36,086 --> 00:17:38,540
Oh right, of course...

250
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,328
You gotta... you have no idea
there's so much to show you.

251
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,028
You're gonna be so
awesomely proud!

252
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:44,897
Come on!
Come on!

253
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:49,195
I'm already awesomely proud.

254
00:17:50,877 --> 00:17:54,000
- Oh. Couple more steps.
- Oh

255
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:55,876
Feeling the burn.

256
00:17:56,052 --> 00:17:59,819
Do you have panda asthma, too?
Does that run in the family?

257
00:17:59,843 --> 00:18:02,573
Dad, you're gonna love this

258
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:04,898
It's like the coolest thing ever.

259
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,778
This is the hall of heroes

260
00:18:07,802 --> 00:18:10,666
Home of the most priceless kung fu artifacts
in all of China.

261
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,661
Whoa.
This place is ....

262
00:18:13,685 --> 00:18:15,742
Awesome? You were going-you were going
to say awesome, right?

263
00:18:15,765 --> 00:18:17,459
- Because it totally is!
- Totally!

264
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,659
But be super careful, everything
is very fragile here.

265
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,512
Like the Urn of Whispering warriors.

266
00:18:21,536 --> 00:18:23,273
Someone broke that once.

267
00:18:23,298 --> 00:18:25,092
- Who?
- Some idiot.

268
00:18:25,117 --> 00:18:26,307
Wow!

269
00:18:26,331 --> 00:18:30,806
- This is Master flying Rhino's battle armor.
- I wonder if I could fit in that

270
00:18:30,831 --> 00:18:33,494
Get out of my head, dad.
I've wondered the same thing.

271
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:35,692
If I could fit in it?
-If you could? No, if I could fit in it.

272
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:38,002
- Oh.
- Dad, check it out.

273
00:18:38,003 --> 00:18:40,304
Master Ram's crossbow
The infinite gates smasher.

274
00:18:40,305 --> 00:18:41,422
Dad, look at this.

275
00:18:41,446 --> 00:18:44,711
The battle helmets of Master Rat's army.
They're so tiny.

276
00:18:44,734 --> 00:18:47,746
Master Dolphin's water proof armor.
This is my favorite.

277
00:18:47,748 --> 00:18:51,833
Check it out. It's the legendary
battle rickshaw of emperor Hawk

278
00:18:52,284 --> 00:18:54,367
Sweet ride.

279
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:57,248
Dad, what are you doing?
We're not supposed to touch anything.

280
00:18:57,272 --> 00:18:59,841
Oh. Sorry, sorry.
Should I put it back?

281
00:18:59,842 --> 00:19:04,224
Yeah, you probably should.
You look so cool, though.

282
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,609
How does it feel? Do the hinges hinge?
Does it smell like rhino?

283
00:19:07,632 --> 00:19:09,250
Does it feel like
you're impenetrable?

284
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:11,667
Does it feel like you can
take on a thousand warriors

285
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:14,925
and emerge unscathed?

286
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:17,795
Yes, it's pretty cool.

287
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,956
Wonder what this does?
I should pull it.

288
00:19:30,423 --> 00:19:32,821
I think I just peed a little.

289
00:19:33,677 --> 00:19:39,211
Anything else we should try in here, son?
Hmm?

290
00:19:42,926 --> 00:19:44,899
Charge!

291
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,574
Faster, faster, faster!

292
00:19:47,575 --> 00:19:51,393
- Thumb war!
- Reinforcements!

293
00:19:53,802 --> 00:19:55,088
Yeah!

294
00:19:55,113 --> 00:19:57,702
This is so much fun...

295
00:19:59,853 --> 00:20:02,519
- Here we go.
- Awesome!

296
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,761
- There, there
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

297
00:20:06,097 --> 00:20:07,404
There you go.

298
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:09,436
Dolphin style attack!
Tweee.

299
00:20:09,461 --> 00:20:12,267
- You got me.
- Dolphin style retreat!

300
00:20:12,885 --> 00:20:15,052
Go long son.

301
00:20:15,645 --> 00:20:18,371
Whoa!
I wasn't ready.

302
00:20:18,735 --> 00:20:20,220
- Coming back at you.
- I got it.

303
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:23,127
- Throw it high!
- Here you go. Yeah, C'mon.

304
00:20:23,828 --> 00:20:27,462
- I'm coming for you.
- Bring it on Master Rhino.

305
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:28,978
Here I come!

306
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,104
Oh.

307
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,007
I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna get you.

308
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:43,937
I'm gonna get you.

309
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:45,167
Shh, stop.

310
00:20:45,192 --> 00:20:49,435
Who's gonna get you?
Who's gonna get you?

311
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:55,036
- Master Rhino.
- Why, what's wrong?

312
00:21:00,316 --> 00:21:01,817
Hello.

313
00:21:02,355 --> 00:21:05,337
Guys guys, you're never gonna
guess who just showed up.

314
00:21:05,338 --> 00:21:08,542
Not in a million years. You can't....
you just try.

315
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:09,537
- Your father!
- Your father!

316
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,297
Wow, how did you
just guess that?

317
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:13,737
Oh, wait a second. Yeah of course.
We look exactly the same.

318
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:18,612
Dad. Say hi to my friends, Mantis
Tigress, Monkey, Crane, and Viper.

319
00:21:18,636 --> 00:21:20,582
- Oh, Viper, was it?
- Monkey, sir.

320
00:21:20,606 --> 00:21:22,110
They're kind of my best friends.

321
00:21:22,111 --> 00:21:25,886
And this... this is Master Shifu.
Legend.

322
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:28,708
It is an honor to meet you, Master Panda.

323
00:21:28,732 --> 00:21:31,622
Perhaps your father would care
to join us in the training hall?

324
00:21:31,645 --> 00:21:34,201
Your son will be teaching the class.

325
00:21:34,225 --> 00:21:35,272
Ho-ho.

326
00:21:35,296 --> 00:21:37,384
I'm sure he's tired.
I'm sure you're tired.

327
00:21:37,385 --> 00:21:39,611
He's tired. I'm gonna show him
the chrysanthemums suite.

328
00:21:39,635 --> 00:21:43,046
What?Tired? No, I'm fine.
I would love to watch you teach.

329
00:21:43,047 --> 00:21:45,176
Trust me.
It would be more fun to watch me...

330
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,071
- Fight!
- What is that?

331
00:21:47,095 --> 00:21:49,059
The valley is under attack.

332
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:52,359
- Son? Under attack?
-This is perfect!

333
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,380
Now you can see what being the dragon
warrior is all about.

334
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:57,030
Follow me!

335
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,390
Enemies of justice.
Prepare for.... whoa

336
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,767
Are you kidding me?
Whoa!

337
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,806
Ow!

338
00:22:16,715 --> 00:22:19,014
What's the deal with the green guys?

339
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,365
- Some kind of jade zombies.
- Jade zombies?

340
00:22:22,389 --> 00:22:24,197
- Jombies, Jinx.
- Jombies, Jinx.

341
00:22:24,223 --> 00:22:25,265
Oh!

342
00:22:25,362 --> 00:22:29,493
- Lotus, be careful!
- It's Okay, Dad. I do this everyday....!

343
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:34,194
Whoa. I recognize this guys.
The Master Badger twins.

344
00:22:34,195 --> 00:22:36,998
With their crushing double gong technique.
Ow!

345
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:40,612
Yeah, that's the one.
That guys is.... no

346
00:22:40,636 --> 00:22:42,765
Master Porcupine.

347
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,304
I thought he died hundred years ago?

348
00:22:47,328 --> 00:22:49,304
These guys are legends.

349
00:22:49,329 --> 00:22:51,283
Get a quick sketch of us.

350
00:22:57,951 --> 00:22:59,637
Did you get it?
Did you get it?

351
00:22:59,661 --> 00:23:02,873
Aw, I blinked.
Can we get another one?

352
00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:09,210
I'm being choked by Master Porcupine.
This is so cool.

353
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:12,969
- Look. It's you.
- Po, focus!

354
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:17,178
Message from the universe.
I'll give you one message from the universe...

355
00:23:17,203 --> 00:23:19,322
Stay away from my son.

356
00:23:19,703 --> 00:23:21,040
Sorry dad. I'll
clean it up later.

357
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:24,041
Whoa, whoa, not my good pan.
Take this one.

358
00:23:25,995 --> 00:23:28,068
Lotus, watch out!

359
00:23:32,366 --> 00:23:34,639
Dad, check out my dumplings of doom.

360
00:23:45,015 --> 00:23:46,543
Gotcha!

361
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:49,676
Ahahahaha...

362
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:52,632
I see you.

363
00:23:52,656 --> 00:23:55,288
Your chi will soon be mine.

364
00:23:55,313 --> 00:23:57,583
- Is he talking to me?
- Which one? They're all talking.

365
00:23:57,606 --> 00:23:59,648
Whoa, you're right.
That's so scary.

366
00:23:59,649 --> 00:24:01,940
We should try that, too.
Maybe it'd be scary back at them.

367
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,450
Okay, but we gotta plan
what we're gonna say first,

368
00:24:03,474 --> 00:24:05,191
otherwise it won't be scary,
it'll be just stupid.

369
00:24:05,216 --> 00:24:07,618
It's not them talking, you idiots!

370
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:09,938
It's me talking through them, Kai!

371
00:24:09,961 --> 00:24:12,896
- Who?
- Okay, okay, enough.

372
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,222
- Did you see that? Did you see?
- Whoa, what just happened?

373
00:24:20,246 --> 00:24:22,616
The green smoke just poof....
and then poof.

374
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,986
Shifu, what wast that?

375
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:27,117
Kai? Kai?
Kai?

376
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,168
Nope. Never heard of him.

377
00:24:29,192 --> 00:24:31,878
Kai... Kai...
Where is it?

378
00:24:31,902 --> 00:24:34,620
There's so much wisdom in here,
I can't find anything.

379
00:24:34,644 --> 00:24:36,006
Yes!

380
00:24:36,624 --> 00:24:38,301
Behold.

381
00:24:39,268 --> 00:24:42,127
All the answers will be found within.

382
00:24:43,737 --> 00:24:46,566
What?
It's blank?

383
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:49,749
Are you kidding me?
Not again.

384
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,270
Wait, wait. Hold on. Sorry
Oh, okay, here we go.

385
00:24:55,677 --> 00:24:58,330
It is written in Oogway's hand.

386
00:24:58,355 --> 00:25:02,166
- Long ago, I had a brother.
- Oogway had a brother?

387
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,145
In arms.
In arms, sorry.

388
00:25:04,146 --> 00:25:07,759
He says brother in arms.
- Can't you just unroll it all at once?

389
00:25:08,701 --> 00:25:13,296
I was an ambitious young warrior
leading a great army.

390
00:25:14,936 --> 00:25:17,954
And fighting by my side was Kai.

391
00:25:18,321 --> 00:25:20,777
My closest friend.

392
00:25:23,097 --> 00:25:27,748
One day we were ambushed.
I was badly wounded.

393
00:25:27,749 --> 00:25:32,659
My friend carried me for days
looking for help.

394
00:25:32,637 --> 00:25:37,223
Until we came to a secret village,
high in the mountains.

395
00:25:37,247 --> 00:25:40,206
An ancient place of healing.

396
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:43,631
A village of pandas.

397
00:25:43,632 --> 00:25:46,884
- Pandas?
- Yes, pandas.

398
00:25:46,907 --> 00:25:51,684
Pandas who used the
power of chi to heal me.

399
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:57,705
They taught me how to give chi.

400
00:26:00,508 --> 00:26:06,497
But Kai, wanted the power all to himself.

401
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:11,524
He saw that what could be given
could also be taken.

402
00:26:14,476 --> 00:26:17,523
I had to stop him.

403
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:24,007
Our battle shook the Earth.

404
00:26:24,008 --> 00:26:29,062
Until, finally, I banished Kai to
the Spirit Realm.

405
00:26:29,063 --> 00:26:31,757
Should he ever return
to the mortal realm,

406
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:35,901
he can only be stopped
by a true Master of chi.

407
00:26:35,924 --> 00:26:38,707
True Master of chi?
Like you.

408
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:40,753
Me?
I can barely make a flower bloom!

409
00:26:40,754 --> 00:26:43,103
I'd need at least thirty more years, and a cave.

410
00:26:43,104 --> 00:26:44,586
Viper: We need a chi Master.

411
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:48,533
Shifu: He will continue stealing the chi
of Masters until he has consumed it all.

412
00:26:48,556 --> 00:26:49,539
Viper: We have to make a way to stop him.

413
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:52,234
Crane: He gets more more powerful
with every Master he defeats.

414
00:26:52,258 --> 00:26:53,826
Tigress: There is no choice.
We fight.

415
00:26:53,851 --> 00:26:56,078
I can teach you, son.

416
00:26:56,732 --> 00:27:02,217
- You can do this?
- Of course, I'm a panda.

417
00:27:02,241 --> 00:27:05,190
That must be why the universe
sent you here.

418
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:07,410
Okay, so what do I have to do?

419
00:27:07,434 --> 00:27:10,212
- You have to come home with me.
- What?

420
00:27:10,237 --> 00:27:12,789
- To the secret village?
- Yes, son.

421
00:27:12,813 --> 00:27:16,563
You must rediscover
what it is to be a panda.

422
00:27:16,588 --> 00:27:20,104
You have to learn how to live like a panda.
Sleep like a panda.

423
00:27:20,128 --> 00:27:22,578
Eat like a panda.

424
00:27:22,602 --> 00:27:27,130
Those 103 dumplings?
Hmm... I was just warming up.

425
00:27:27,153 --> 00:27:30,625
I've always felt like
I wasn't eating up to my full potential.

426
00:27:30,626 --> 00:27:34,883
You can't take Po away from me. No, no
I want a second opinion.

427
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:37,578
Shifu, open another scroll or something.

428
00:27:37,579 --> 00:27:40,591
- I think he should go.
- Fine. A third opinion.

429
00:27:40,616 --> 00:27:42,952
Monkey? Viper?
Tigress?

430
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,697
Dad, you heard what
Shifu said, Oogway said.

431
00:27:45,722 --> 00:27:48,263
This guy can only be stopped
by a Master of chi.

432
00:27:48,264 --> 00:27:51,830
And I can only Master chi by knowing
who I really am.

433
00:27:51,831 --> 00:27:54,600
Well, I'm a panda.

434
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,942
I'll pack your lunch for the road.

435
00:28:06,025 --> 00:28:09,004
Do you really think Po
can Master chi in time?

436
00:28:09,028 --> 00:28:10,647
Doesn't matter what I think.

437
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:14,723
- It only matters what the universe thinks.
- So, that's a "No"?

438
00:28:14,724 --> 00:28:18,320
- Master, what are we going to do?
- You are going to find out where Kai is.

439
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:21,600
Follow the trail of those jade creatures
but do not engage.

440
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:25,119
For with every foe he faces
Kai becomes stronger.

441
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,244
- Why me? Is it because I asked.
- No, it is because you can fly.

442
00:28:29,245 --> 00:28:32,705
- Go!
- Should have kept your beak shut.

443
00:28:32,707 --> 00:28:35,233
- And take Mantis.
- What? Oh man, is it because I ...?

444
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:36,427
Yes.

445
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Hmun dang zawng aia tlawma
Air Tickets la duh tan

446
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:55,001
D&L TRAVELS #9612136045 ah
biak mai tur a ni e.

447
00:29:01,815 --> 00:29:04,165
- Oh, lunch break?
- Ha.

448
00:29:04,189 --> 00:29:06,503
- You don't need to ask me twice.
- Ow.

449
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:08,412
- Dad?
- Yes?

450
00:29:08,437 --> 00:29:10,302
- Dad?
- Yes?

451
00:29:10,303 --> 00:29:14,119
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing? Getting a backache.

452
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,008
Did you have to step on every rock?

453
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:19,393
- No, I mean why are you here?
- What was I supposed to do, huh?

454
00:29:19,394 --> 00:29:21,513
What if the pandas
don't have food you like?

455
00:29:21,514 --> 00:29:25,394
You're never gonna be able to save the world
on an empty stomach.

456
00:29:25,418 --> 00:29:27,718
I consider my presence mission critical.

457
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:32,035
Oh yes about that. We can't share
the location of the village with others.

458
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:36,133
- So...
- Well, you think I can't keep a secret, huh?

459
00:29:36,157 --> 00:29:40,388
I raised Po for 20 years before
I finally told him he was adopted.

460
00:29:40,413 --> 00:29:42,200
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

461
00:29:42,201 --> 00:29:45,894
Okay, I guess it would be cruel
to make you fly back.

462
00:29:47,007 --> 00:29:50,507
- You can fly?
- I'm a bird, Po.

463
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:08,051
We're here.

464
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,383
Sure looks like a long ways up there.

465
00:30:14,407 --> 00:30:17,994
And my son hates stairs.
So, let's go home.

466
00:30:17,995 --> 00:30:20,419
We're pandas.
We don't do stairs.

467
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,288
I've waited my whole life
to hear those words.

468
00:30:26,453 --> 00:30:27,964
Rats.

469
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:38,485
Whoa... huh?

470
00:30:49,486 --> 00:30:53,926
This is the secret panda village?
No wonder you keep it a secret.

471
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:57,661
If I lived here,
I wouldn't tell anyone either.

472
00:31:01,134 --> 00:31:05,799
- Now you can whoa.
- Whoa...!

473
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,713
Oh.

474
00:31:31,444 --> 00:31:32,782
Oh.

475
00:31:38,668 --> 00:31:41,289
Li?
Everyone, Li is back.

476
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,347
- They're both back.
- He found his son.

477
00:31:43,371 --> 00:31:44,492
- He made it.
- They're back.

478
00:31:44,493 --> 00:31:46,122
- Li?
- He found his son.

479
00:31:46,123 --> 00:31:47,868
Everyone, Li is back.

480
00:31:47,869 --> 00:31:50,256
Hang on, we're coming.

481
00:31:50,257 --> 00:31:51,648
- He made it.
- Yoo-hoo!

482
00:31:51,672 --> 00:31:54,468
- He made it!
- Why are we running?

483
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:59,338
- He made it.
- Li shan is back.

484
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:13,152
Everyone, everyone gather around.
This is my son.

485
00:32:13,176 --> 00:32:15,065
- Hello. Hi.
- Cute.

486
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,426
- Triplets!
- Hi, I'm Ku Ku.

487
00:32:17,428 --> 00:32:20,397
- I'm Meng Meng.
- I'm Shuai Shuai, he smells like cookies.

488
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:25,183
- He's so handsome. Just like his father.
- Thank you.

489
00:32:25,207 --> 00:32:28,551
Son, these are your cousins.
Dim and Sum.

490
00:32:28,552 --> 00:32:30,617
- I have cousins.
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

491
00:32:30,642 --> 00:32:33,922
- Whoa, buns on a string.
- We call it a snacklace.

492
00:32:33,923 --> 00:32:35,684
That's right.
Yum yum yum yum yum.

493
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:37,366
We'll make you another one.

494
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:39,332
Ooooh.
It's you.

495
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:43,658
- So, that's nice to see you. Hi.
- I don't know who you are.

496
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:47,062
Oh, stripey baby
So beautiful.

497
00:32:47,063 --> 00:32:49,386
Oh, Okay, careful with that.
That's my action figure.

498
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,379
Can I keep her?

499
00:32:50,403 --> 00:32:52,123
- Noooo...
- Can I?

500
00:32:52,575 --> 00:32:55,567
No....problem. Of course, yeah
that's why I brought her.

501
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:58,881
- Take good care of her.
- Yes, stripey baby

502
00:32:59,953 --> 00:33:03,550
You look just like me
but a baby.

503
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:12,138
You're like me but old.
You're like me but fatter.

504
00:33:12,163 --> 00:33:14,023
- You're like me but.....
- Ha ha.

505
00:33:14,047 --> 00:33:17,122
Wooooo... with a hat.

506
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:19,025
He does wear a hat.

507
00:33:19,048 --> 00:33:21,495
You all look like me.

508
00:33:21,992 --> 00:33:24,620
Let's feast in my son's honor.

509
00:33:24,644 --> 00:33:26,776
- Yeh.
- Yeah.

510
00:33:27,067 --> 00:33:31,454
- What the.....?
- Pandas don't walk! We roll!

511
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:38,318
How you ever seen anyone
look so ridiculous?

512
00:33:39,296 --> 00:33:41,679
Po, what are you doing?
Po?

513
00:33:48,137 --> 00:33:49,358
Ow.

514
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:51,893
Oh.

515
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:55,270
Ow.

516
00:33:55,295 --> 00:33:58,259
You're right.
That is better than walking.

517
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,157
- Yeah.
- That's nice stuff.

518
00:34:02,181 --> 00:34:03,276
Yeah, have some dumplings.

519
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,374
What kind of panda doesn't know
how to roll?

520
00:34:05,397 --> 00:34:07,581
Well, I'm kinda new at this whole
being a panda thing.

521
00:34:07,604 --> 00:34:10,915
Hey, what kind of panda are you?
You have a funny neck.

522
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,031
I'm not a panda at all.

523
00:34:12,055 --> 00:34:16,172
- What's that? What's that? What's that?
-My hat , My beak , My wing , My dumplings.

524
00:34:16,195 --> 00:34:18,605
No more questions.
Go away, kid.

525
00:34:18,607 --> 00:34:21,388
Here, son, I packed your chopsticks.
- Thanks, dad.

526
00:34:22,587 --> 00:34:24,858
- What?
- What are those for?

527
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:27,084
These? These are chopsticks
They're for picking up dumplings.

528
00:34:27,085 --> 00:34:30,311
You mean you only eat
one at a time?

529
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:33,652
Yum yum yum.

530
00:34:36,127 --> 00:34:39,159
I knew I wasn't eating
up to my potential.

531
00:34:46,582 --> 00:34:47,861
Huh?

532
00:34:52,403 --> 00:34:54,754
I am Mei Mei.

533
00:34:54,755 --> 00:34:58,178
Wow, she's amazing.
She's so beautiful.

534
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,839
That's sweet, Po,
but please try to save all

535
00:35:00,862 --> 00:35:04,528
other compliments until
after the performance.

536
00:35:05,046 --> 00:35:07,864
- Me? No, I didn't say....
- Shhh. Shhh. Shh...

537
00:35:07,865 --> 00:35:11,326
Shut it.
After the performance.

538
00:35:11,327 --> 00:35:13,541
Ha.
Has it started yet?

539
00:35:15,884 --> 00:35:19,565
- Whoa.
- Best ribbon dancer in the world.

540
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:22,432
- At least that's what she says.
- Look away, look away.

541
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:24,860
No, you can't.
Can you?

542
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:28,196
Dad, why does she keep
staring at me like that?

543
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,075
Try to keep up.

544
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:34,701
- I don't really know how to dance.
- Of course you do.

545
00:35:34,725 --> 00:35:37,154
All pandas dance.

546
00:35:37,155 --> 00:35:38,930
- I know what you're thinking.
- You do?

547
00:35:38,955 --> 00:35:42,170
How can one panda be so beautiful?

548
00:35:43,714 --> 00:35:47,482
- Whoa!
- For me? Fine.

549
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:49,820
Ooo.
Oh.

550
00:35:49,844 --> 00:35:51,476
- Help me, dads.
-Yeah, no. You're on your own.

551
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,442
You're doing great, son.

552
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,723
Your turn.

553
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,927
Bring it home!

554
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:14,472
Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.

555
00:36:15,492 --> 00:36:17,767
I have so much to learn.

556
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:27,803
Wings of surveillance.

557
00:36:27,804 --> 00:36:29,191
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?

558
00:36:29,214 --> 00:36:32,732
Just because you say "Wings of......" before something
it doesn't mean that you're doing a special move.

559
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:35,408
It's like me saying,
"Antenna of power" or....

560
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:38,008
" Thorax of making sandwiches"

561
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:41,285
- Wings of disagreement.
- Whoa, there.

562
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:45,872
Master Bear, Master Chicken, Master Croc,
what are you doing out here?

563
00:36:45,873 --> 00:36:48,768
Jade creatures attacked our villages.
We've tracked them here.

564
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:50,260
Stop.

565
00:36:52,683 --> 00:36:55,108
They must be in there.

566
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:57,900
Master Shifu strongly advised us.....

567
00:37:00,682 --> 00:37:02,904
- ...not to engage.
- We got to get in there.

568
00:37:02,905 --> 00:37:04,919
- But Master Shifu said...
- You're seriously afraid?

569
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,502
Even Master Chicken's going in there
and he's a chicken.

570
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,161
- That's it, I'm going in.
- Mantis, we have orders not to....

571
00:37:19,162 --> 00:37:21,866
They need our help. Come on.
I'll go high, you go low.

572
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:23,373
No, wait.

573
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,969
Fear the bug.

574
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:27,932
Alright, you little...!
Oh oh.

575
00:37:27,957 --> 00:37:30,509
- Hold on, buddy. I'm coming.
- "Antenna of power"

576
00:37:30,533 --> 00:37:33,022
- Ah, it didn't work!
- Mantis!

577
00:37:37,203 --> 00:37:38,841
Mantis?

578
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:41,174
Mantis?

579
00:37:53,018 --> 00:37:59,217
Your chi is strong,
just like your friend, the bug.

580
00:37:59,242 --> 00:38:01,055
Huh?
Mantis.

581
00:38:02,327 --> 00:38:06,976
Whoooooa.

582
00:38:08,669 --> 00:38:13,638
Don't worry, little birdie.
I'll put your chi to good use.

583
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:18,538
Destroying the Jade palace
and everyone in it.

584
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:19,903
No.

585
00:38:25,943 --> 00:38:28,597
Wings of...regret.

586
00:38:35,294 --> 00:38:38,053
Oh yeah, first day
of panda training.

587
00:38:38,076 --> 00:38:42,126
Alright flower,
I'm gonna make you bloom.

588
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,768
Hoo-hoo!

589
00:38:44,174 --> 00:38:45,162
Dad, dad .

590
00:38:45,163 --> 00:38:47,860
- What? What? What is it?
-I'm ready for my first day of panda training.

591
00:38:47,884 --> 00:38:48,490
What?

592
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:51,353
You know, learn to be a panda,
Master chi, save the world.

593
00:38:51,376 --> 00:38:53,456
Pandas sleep till past noon.

594
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,021
So lesson number one is
go back to bed.

595
00:38:57,046 --> 00:38:58,483
Of course.

596
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,509
Nobody said this was gonna be easy.

597
00:39:08,531 --> 00:39:11,238
- Did I oversleep?
- Ha, ha! You sure did.

598
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:12,328
Yes!

599
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:13,576
Yeah, show him kids.

600
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,209
Can you do this?
Can you do that?

601
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:16,515
- How about this? How about that?
- Hey?

602
00:39:16,516 --> 00:39:18,110
- Am I doing it? Is this good?
- Whoa.

603
00:39:18,134 --> 00:39:19,879
Here we go.
I got it!

604
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,928
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

605
00:39:21,953 --> 00:39:23,777
- Grandma panda, heads up.
- Ow.

606
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:26,087
- Oh.
- We better roll.

607
00:39:26,435 --> 00:39:29,167
Po, lunchtime.

608
00:39:34,773 --> 00:39:38,818
Po. You gotta let the hill
tell you where to roll.

609
00:39:38,842 --> 00:39:44,082
- Rookie mistake.
- Dim, Sum, let's show him how we go uphill.

610
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:48,282
- It's beautiful.
- Snack time. Oh.

611
00:39:48,308 --> 00:39:52,155
- Po, you can fly?
- I'm coming in hot!

612
00:39:53,228 --> 00:39:55,586
Get them while they're cold.

613
00:39:57,363 --> 00:40:00,007
What are you doing there?
That food is for Po.

614
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:01,388
Throw it in.

615
00:40:03,691 --> 00:40:06,764
There, there, that's it.

616
00:40:06,788 --> 00:40:08,660
- Feeling relaxed?
- Yeah, really.

617
00:40:08,684 --> 00:40:11,992
- Just let yourself fall into it.
- Got it.

618
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,526
I'm fine.
I just.....

619
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:20,590
There we go.
Just let it all out.

620
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:22,163
That's my boy.

621
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:25,025
Get out of there!

622
00:40:27,476 --> 00:40:30,188
My noodles.
Leave my noodles alone.

623
00:40:33,692 --> 00:40:37,473
- Subtle, Po. Very subtle.
- Let me get some of that.

624
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:40,771
And leave my hat alone.

625
00:40:43,992 --> 00:40:48,857
- We love noodles!
- Oh, just like my Po.

626
00:40:53,131 --> 00:40:55,097
What are you guys looking at?

627
00:41:00,807 --> 00:41:04,290
That's how we roll.
Cannonball.

628
00:41:05,402 --> 00:41:07,515
Hoo-hoo.
Yeah!

629
00:41:18,202 --> 00:41:20,349
- Mom, look it.
- Whoa.

630
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,709
How was that?

631
00:41:30,085 --> 00:41:31,595
Whoa

632
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:36,290
- Now you try again but don't try so hard.
- Okay, Okay.

633
00:41:41,364 --> 00:41:44,625
Much better.

634
00:41:50,571 --> 00:41:53,226
Thanks, dad.
- For what?

635
00:41:53,227 --> 00:41:57,438
You know, just for you know,
showing me what it feels like...

636
00:41:57,789 --> 00:41:59,665
to be a panda.

637
00:42:00,296 --> 00:42:03,356
- So when do you think I'll be ready?
- Ready?

638
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,426
You know, to learn how to master chi.

639
00:42:05,427 --> 00:42:07,929
Soon, real soon.

640
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:10,829
Come on.
I wanna show you something else. C'mon

641
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:17,781
Sorry about the mess,
I don't usually get visitors.

642
00:42:27,342 --> 00:42:30,563
Is this my mom?

643
00:42:35,513 --> 00:42:39,101
I had this done on your
one hundredth day.

644
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:43,731
Your mama couldn't hold you still.

645
00:42:43,732 --> 00:42:46,199
You nearly eat the paper.

646
00:42:46,725 --> 00:42:49,765
- It's true.
- What was she like?

647
00:42:51,271 --> 00:42:54,714
She was the total package.

648
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:58,665
Smart, beautiful.

649
00:42:58,666 --> 00:43:01,035
Tremendous appetite.

650
00:43:01,724 --> 00:43:04,227
She was the love of my life.

651
00:43:04,228 --> 00:43:08,524
And then, just when I thought
I couldn't get any luckier.

652
00:43:08,525 --> 00:43:12,073
Along you came, my Little Lotus.

653
00:43:14,288 --> 00:43:16,735
I really had it all.

654
00:43:17,607 --> 00:43:21,663
Until that one moment...

655
00:43:24,772 --> 00:43:26,708
When I ...

656
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:29,164
lost everything.

657
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Hmun dang zawng aia tlawma
Air Tickets la duh tan

658

660
00:44:04,554 --> 00:44:11,788
Dad, you don't have to worry about
losing me ever again, Okay?

661
00:44:19,831 --> 00:44:22,518
Let me get some of that.

662
00:44:30,545 --> 00:44:33,110
It's from the eastern province.

663
00:44:33,835 --> 00:44:39,479
Master Lizard, Master Ox,
Master Eagle, all of them.

664
00:44:39,502 --> 00:44:44,057
In every village from the sea to here.
Every Master in china...

665
00:44:44,058 --> 00:44:46,790
- ... has vanished.
- Maybe they are all at a party?

666
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:49,169
- Monkey.
- I didn't get invited either.

667
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:51,301
Kai has taken their chi.

668
00:44:51,325 --> 00:44:55,638
We are all that stand between him
and the knowledge Oogway left

669
00:44:55,663 --> 00:44:57,706
in our care.

670
00:44:57,792 --> 00:45:00,832
- The villagers, evacuated?
- Done, Master.

671
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:02,971
- Crane? Mantis?
- Still nothing.

672
00:45:02,972 --> 00:45:05,182
Huh!
Wait, it's them!

673
00:45:08,805 --> 00:45:09,999
No!

674
00:45:23,323 --> 00:45:24,901
Kai

675
00:45:29,058 --> 00:45:32,806
Nice, very tacky.

676
00:45:32,961 --> 00:45:35,595
How dare you set foot
on these grounds!

677
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:38,083
Look at your pathetic fools.

678
00:45:38,106 --> 00:45:41,995
Groveling at the feet of
Oogway the magnificent.

679
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:44,287
You are not fit to speak his name.

680
00:45:44,288 --> 00:45:47,496
I am not fit, little kitten?

681
00:45:48,729 --> 00:45:53,542
I fought by his side.
I loved him like a brother.

682
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:57,630
And he betrayed me.

683
00:45:58,348 --> 00:46:05,297
Well, now I will destroy
everything he has created.

684
00:46:05,322 --> 00:46:06,634
Go!

685
00:46:26,928 --> 00:46:29,428
How's that for a little kitten?

686
00:46:39,907 --> 00:46:41,016
Huh!

687
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,144
Ya!

688
00:46:44,077 --> 00:46:47,154
I will not let you destroy
Oogway's memory.

689
00:46:47,155 --> 00:46:49,830
Why not?
He destroyed mine.

690
00:46:49,854 --> 00:46:53,835
Mantis, it is me, your bestie.

691
00:46:54,304 --> 00:46:56,250
Whoooaaa!

692
00:46:57,888 --> 00:47:01,593
Sorry Tigress.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

693
00:47:02,078 --> 00:47:03,291
Sorry.

694
00:47:16,081 --> 00:47:19,653
- Shifu.
- Bring them to me.

695
00:47:26,983 --> 00:47:29,049
Heh ha ha ha...

696
00:47:29,073 --> 00:47:32,404
- No! You must warn Po.
- Master please.

697
00:47:39,626 --> 00:47:44,412
I will show you
the true power of chi, brother.

698
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:47,041
No.

699
00:48:21,163 --> 00:48:24,395
Oogway, forgive me.

700
00:48:24,847 --> 00:48:29,585
Hmm, what do you say Oogway?
Do you forgive him?

701
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:32,611
You may have destroyed
the Jade palace.

702
00:48:32,635 --> 00:48:35,396
but you will never succeed.

703
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:39,267
There will always be someone to stop you.

704
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:43,788
Who? The panda?
His chi is strong but

705
00:48:43,788 --> 00:48:45,908
it won't be enough.

706
00:48:45,908 --> 00:48:50,556
- He will meet the same fate as you.
- No.

707
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:55,037
And so will every panda in that village.

708
00:48:59,834 --> 00:49:02,180
Yes!

709
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:08,126
Po, I hope you're ready.

710
00:49:11,764 --> 00:49:13,977
Dance Lotus, dance.

711
00:49:15,256 --> 00:49:18,177
He's so handsome.

712
00:49:18,459 --> 00:49:21,614
- Hi
-That's a panda hug.

713
00:49:21,615 --> 00:49:23,438
Hey

714
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,974
Oh! Ooo.
Eh, ha ha.

715
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:29,336
Po.

716
00:50:03,416 --> 00:50:05,421
Huh!
Tigress?

717
00:50:08,225 --> 00:50:09,600
Who's she?

718
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:11,186
Who is that?

719
00:50:12,462 --> 00:50:16,509
- Baby stripey baby
- What are you doing here?

720
00:50:16,532 --> 00:50:19,739
Kai attacked the valley.
He's taken every Master in china

721
00:50:19,762 --> 00:50:22,668
including Shifu and the others.
It's....it's all gone, Po.

722
00:50:22,693 --> 00:50:24,951
- Everything, everyone.
- Everyone?

723
00:50:24,952 --> 00:50:28,693
- Everyone.
- How's my restaurant?

724
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:32,632
- We'll talk later.
- And now he's on his way here.

725
00:50:32,656 --> 00:50:36,763
He's after you, Po.
He's after all pandas.

726
00:50:36,787 --> 00:50:38,992
- How long do we have?
- Not long.

727
00:50:39,016 --> 00:50:41,054
Please tell me you've mastered chi.

728
00:50:41,077 --> 00:50:42,669
- Here, take the baby.
- Dad, dad.

729
00:50:42,693 --> 00:50:43,806
Okay, who belongs to this one?

730
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:45,769
You need to teach me the
secret chi technique now.

731
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:47,947
No, no.
I'm afraid you need more time.

732
00:50:47,948 --> 00:50:49,781
Everyone, go get your things.

733
00:50:49,805 --> 00:50:51,891
- Let me hand you that.
- I don't have more time. I need to learn it now.

734
00:50:51,892 --> 00:50:54,279
Sorry, you're not ready.

735
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,198
- Okay, pack everything.
- I am ready!

736
00:50:56,199 --> 00:50:56,973
Not quite.

737
00:50:56,997 --> 00:50:58,979
What are you talking about?
I've done everything you've asked.

738
00:50:59,003 --> 00:51:02,332
I Mastered napping, sleeping in hammocks,
the hot tubs.

739
00:51:02,356 --> 00:51:04,273
I am totally in one
with my panda parts

740
00:51:04,274 --> 00:51:07,617
- Now, why won't you show me?
- Because I don't know it!

741
00:51:10,575 --> 00:51:11,600
You what?

742
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,307
I don't know it, Okay?

743
00:51:13,308 --> 00:51:15,801
No one does.
Maybe we used to but...

744
00:51:15,802 --> 00:51:18,698
- But not anymore.
- You lied?

745
00:51:18,699 --> 00:51:20,452
No, I ...

746
00:51:21,653 --> 00:51:23,490
Yes.

747
00:51:23,849 --> 00:51:25,172
Why?

748
00:51:25,173 --> 00:51:26,941
To save your life.

749
00:51:26,964 --> 00:51:30,360
I find out some blade-swinging
maniac is coming for you.

750
00:51:30,361 --> 00:51:31,961
What am I supposed to do?

751
00:51:31,962 --> 00:51:35,644
- Just let that happen?
- Yes, I'm the Dragon Warrior!

752
00:51:35,645 --> 00:51:38,167
Facing maniacs, that's my job.

753
00:51:38,168 --> 00:51:40,919
But because of you,
I left the valley unprotected.

754
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,933
I left my friends unprotected.

755
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:45,907
And now they're all...
they're all...

756
00:51:45,908 --> 00:51:48,107
And you would have been, too.

757
00:51:49,274 --> 00:51:53,725
I lost you once.
I am not going to lose you again.

758
00:51:54,357 --> 00:51:56,168
I can't.

759
00:52:01,713 --> 00:52:03,663
You just did.

760
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,259
Mom, pick me.

761
00:52:22,447 --> 00:52:24,401
Po, I'm so worried for you that

762
00:52:24,425 --> 00:52:26,797
I can't even enjoy being right
about everything.

763
00:52:26,821 --> 00:52:29,726
Now run, run, run, as fast as
those chubby legs can go.

764
00:52:29,749 --> 00:52:32,901
- Run? There's nowhere to run.
- What are you going to do?

765
00:52:32,902 --> 00:52:35,614
I'm gonna stay and
fight that monster.

766
00:52:35,637 --> 00:52:39,021
Po, he may be a monster but
he's still your father.

767
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:42,821
- Not him, Kai.
- Huh! No.

768
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:28,836
- Hungry?
- No, I..... not really.

769
00:53:28,861 --> 00:53:31,364
Well, maybe just one.

770
00:53:31,617 --> 00:53:36,149
You know, you weren't the only one
who was lying.

771
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:40,831
I didn't really come along because I was worried
Po would go hungry.

772
00:53:40,855 --> 00:53:44,352
- I was worried about you.
- Worried that I'd go hungry?

773
00:53:44,353 --> 00:53:49,224
- No, I was worried you'd steal Po from me.
- I'd what?

774
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:51,844
I know.
That was crazy.

775
00:53:52,324 --> 00:53:57,933
But I realized having you in Po's life
doesn't mean less for me.

776
00:53:57,934 --> 00:54:00,543
It means more for Po.

777
00:54:00,566 --> 00:54:01,688
Oh.

778
00:54:01,712 --> 00:54:05,443
Well.
I'm not in his life.

779
00:54:05,444 --> 00:54:09,317
- Not any more.
- Your son got mad at you.

780
00:54:09,318 --> 00:54:12,429
- Welcome to parenthood.
- You don't understand.

781
00:54:12,453 --> 00:54:15,672
I lied to him.
He'll never forgive me.

782
00:54:15,696 --> 00:54:20,663
I lied to him for 20 years.
He still thinks he came from an egg.

783
00:54:20,664 --> 00:54:25,836
Sometimes we do the wrong things
for the right reasons.

784
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:35,950
Look, he's hurt.

785
00:54:35,951 --> 00:54:40,852
He's confused
and he still has to save the world.

786
00:54:41,187 --> 00:54:44,439
He needs the both his dads.

787
00:55:01,447 --> 00:55:04,071
- This isn't going to work.
- It has to.

788
00:55:04,072 --> 00:55:05,919
- You 're not thinking straight.
- I am.

789
00:55:05,942 --> 00:55:07,106
- You're not.
- I am.

790
00:55:07,129 --> 00:55:08,933
- No.
- Yes, I am.

791
00:55:09,596 --> 00:55:12,357
I've seen Kai.
I've seen what he can do.

792
00:55:12,358 --> 00:55:15,121
But he hasn't seen what
I can do.

793
00:55:18,266 --> 00:55:20,325
The Wuxi finger hold?

794
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:21,430
That's my best move.

795
00:55:21,431 --> 00:55:23,322
I just have to get to
Kai, grab his finger,

796
00:55:23,346 --> 00:55:25,756
and then, Skadoosh.
Back to the Spirit Realm.

797
00:55:25,757 --> 00:55:27,711
He has an army of jade warriors.

798
00:55:27,712 --> 00:55:31,126
Everything they see he sees
so there's no sneaking up on him.

799
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:34,096
You will never get close enough.
- It's gonna work.

800
00:55:35,884 --> 00:55:38,358
He can only be stopped
by a Master of chi.

801
00:55:38,359 --> 00:55:42,473
Oh, you sound just like Shifu with the chi chi chi.
Chi this. Chi that. Chi chi chi chi.

802
00:55:42,474 --> 00:55:46,079
I'm not a Master of chi. Okay?
I don't know if I'm the Dragon Warrior.

803
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,781
I don't even know if I'm a panda.
I don't know who I am.

804
00:55:51,737 --> 00:55:52,897
You're right.

805
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,700
There's no way I can
stop him and his army.

806
00:55:59,065 --> 00:56:02,221
Unless you had an army of your own.

807
00:56:04,733 --> 00:56:07,887
- You?
- Not just me.

808
00:56:07,888 --> 00:56:11,075
- Us.
- All of us.

809
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:23,751
I finally found my son
after all these years.

810
00:56:24,046 --> 00:56:27,709
It's gonna take a lot more than
the end of the world to keep us apart.

811
00:56:27,732 --> 00:56:31,654
- But you don't even know kung fu.
- Then you will teach us.

812
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:36,231
What? I can't teach you kung fu.
I couldn't even teach Tigress.

813
00:56:36,256 --> 00:56:39,699
And she already knows kung fu!

814
00:56:40,047 --> 00:56:45,518
Po, I know I'm the last guy
you wanna trust right now.

815
00:56:45,541 --> 00:56:48,725
But you gotta believe me.
We can do this.

816
00:56:48,726 --> 00:56:54,172
We can learn kung fu.
We can be just like you.

817
00:56:54,279 --> 00:56:55,726
What did you just say?

818
00:56:55,751 --> 00:56:58,183
- Uh... We can do this?
- No.

819
00:56:58,184 --> 00:57:00,009
- We can learn kung fu?
- After that.

820
00:57:00,033 --> 00:57:01,735
Uh... I...
We can be just like you?

821
00:57:01,759 --> 00:57:03,008
- Yes!
- We can?

822
00:57:03,032 --> 00:57:05,333
No, you can't!

823
00:57:06,086 --> 00:57:08,396
But you don't have to be.

824
00:57:08,397 --> 00:57:11,513
That's what Shifu meant.
I don't have to turn you into me.

825
00:57:11,537 --> 00:57:14,059
I have to turn you into you!

826
00:57:14,083 --> 00:57:15,642
That doesn't make any sense.

827
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:17,920
I know!

828
00:57:17,921 --> 00:57:20,624
- Thanks, dads.
- You're welcome?

829
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:23,387
I'm gonna do something I never thought
I'd be able to do.

830
00:57:23,387 --> 00:57:26,177
I'm gonna teach kung fu.

831
00:57:27,175 --> 00:57:31,241
You guys, your real strength comes
from being the best you you can be.

832
00:57:31,242 --> 00:57:33,906
So, who are you?
What are you good at?

833
00:57:33,907 --> 00:57:37,642
What do you love?
What makes you you?

834
00:57:38,808 --> 00:57:42,405
Yes, good.
Good, again.

835
00:57:44,784 --> 00:57:46,730
Good, again.

836
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:48,629
Good, good, good, again.

837
00:57:48,653 --> 00:57:52,979
- Huh?
- Stripey baby, stripey baby

838
00:57:53,004 --> 00:57:55,851
Faster, faster.
Roll those ribbons!

839
00:57:55,852 --> 00:57:57,857
Hug that log, you.
Hug that log

840
00:57:57,881 --> 00:58:00,790
like it's the last time you're ever
gonna hug it. Goodbye forever.

841
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:04,263
Higher, and a little more to the
left this time. You can do it.

842
00:58:06,555 --> 00:58:09,161
I don't wanna see any of these
hit the ground.

843
00:58:19,815 --> 00:58:22,149
Wait, wait, save Stripy Baby some.

844
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:24,845
Good, try it with this.

845
00:58:25,899 --> 00:58:28,077
Now try it with these.

846
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,956
Good, now try it with these.

847
00:58:37,298 --> 00:58:38,296
Oh.

848
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,672
- Ow.

00:59:09,217 --> 00:59:11,228
Baby, he he he.

854
00:59:11,252 --> 00:59:12,769
What?

855
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:16,500
Okay pay attention cause I might gonna
go over this ten more times.

856
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,251
The only entrance to the village is here.

857
00:59:19,252 --> 00:59:23,807
The dumpling squadron will take position here
while the cookie squadron will take position here.

858
00:59:23,808 --> 00:59:27,241
Now, on my signal,
the two squadrons will...

859
00:59:28,739 --> 00:59:32,648
Alright, Okay.
The noodle squadron will...

860
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:38,898
Alright. Okay, anyway,the
important thing to

861
00:59:38,922 --> 00:59:41,861
remember is that this
is the spot where...

862
00:59:43,787 --> 00:59:46,893
Okay, I saw that coming.
If you only remember one thing,

863
00:59:46,893 --> 00:59:49,606
it's just distract the jombies until
I get close enough to put a

864
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:52,036
Wuxi finger hold on Kai.
You got it?

865
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:53,833
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

866
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:56,798
Pandas on three. One, two, three
panda, you guys...

867
00:59:56,821 --> 00:59:59,490
Never mind.
I'll teach you that later.

868
01:00:32,207 --> 01:00:36,179
I... I wish I could have taught
you this, son.

869
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:38,855
It's okay, dad.
I'm....

870
01:00:44,619 --> 01:00:46,307
He's here.

871
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:11,495
Whhhhooooaaa!

872
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:14,425
That's what I call a dramatic entrance.

873
01:01:17,438 --> 01:01:20,604
Haha, you must be the Dragon Warrior.

874
01:01:20,605 --> 01:01:23,318
And you must be Kai.

875
01:01:23,319 --> 01:01:26,635
Beast of vengeance, maker of widows.

876
01:01:26,659 --> 01:01:28,949
Yes, finally.

877
01:01:28,973 --> 01:01:32,292
Thank you, almost makes
me wanna spare your life.

878
01:01:32,317 --> 01:01:33,456
Oh, you wanna spare me?

879
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:37,646
How about you spare me the chitchat, alright?
Let's do this.

880
01:01:37,647 --> 01:01:42,240
I'm going to take your chi then the chi
of every panda in the...

881
01:01:42,241 --> 01:01:44,405

Oh, you pudgy little...

01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,360
Round them all up.

886
01:02:10,362 --> 01:02:14,358
Oh no, it's true.
You guys have all been turned green.

887
01:02:14,382 --> 01:02:17,827
Except for you, Mantis,
you were already green.

888
01:02:19,046 --> 01:02:21,265
- Now?
- Wait for the signal.

889
01:02:21,288 --> 01:02:22,708
HAA!

890
01:02:22,733 --> 01:02:24,716
Here we go!

891
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:32,465
Ooo.

895
01:02:42,614 --> 01:02:43,582
Seriously?

896
01:02:43,606 --> 01:02:44,573
- Yeah!
- We did it!

897
01:02:44,597 --> 01:02:45,770
- Woo hoo hoo.
- Yeah!

898
01:02:45,794 --> 01:02:47,344
Sorry, Crane.

899
01:02:54,587 --> 01:02:58,006
Spring roll squad.
Time for some takeout.

900
01:03:04,662 --> 01:03:07,415
Yoo hoo.
Over here, Mr. jombie.

901
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,782
I don't know who you are either.

902
01:03:14,783 --> 01:03:16,507
Noodle squad.

903
01:03:19,117 --> 01:03:22,636
Get ready to dance with danger.

904
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:24,230
Waaaaa!

905
01:03:26,042 --> 01:03:27,998
Oooh.
Sweet.

906
01:03:38,846 --> 01:03:40,993
- Stripey baby
- Huh!

907
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:42,360
Weee!

908
01:03:45,194 --> 01:03:47,237
- Do it.
- You're mean.

909
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:54,294
Fire.

910
01:03:59,005 --> 01:04:00,566
Fire in the hole.

911
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:01,535
Aww!

912
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:02,582
Yes

913
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:06,361
All right, kids!
You got it, guys.

914
01:04:09,282 --> 01:04:11,558
Oh no, Master Shifu.

915
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:14,317
I can't hit Shifu.

916
01:04:15,425 --> 01:04:18,974
- I can.
- And, so can I.

917
01:04:20,013 --> 01:04:21,801
- Double dad defense.
- Double dad defense.

918
01:04:21,825 --> 01:04:22,952
- Left, dad.
- Right, dad.

919
01:04:22,953 --> 01:04:23,940
Thanks dad.

920
01:04:23,963 --> 01:04:25,597
Back at you, dad.

921
01:04:25,621 --> 01:04:27,183
We've got this, son.

922
01:04:27,207 --> 01:04:28,742
Ho ho.
Go, dads!

923
01:04:28,765 --> 01:04:29,926
Yeah.

924
01:04:33,324 --> 01:04:34,735
Yeah!
Ha ha!

925
01:04:34,759 --> 01:04:39,247
- We got 'em now.
- Stop, stop, enough.

926
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:42,271
Stop.

927
01:04:43,555 --> 01:04:45,683
- Ha ha ha ha ha.
- Eee!

928
01:04:45,707 --> 01:04:47,989
Let's finish this.

929
01:04:48,829 --> 01:04:50,805
- That's our boy!
- That's our boy!

930
01:05:05,121 --> 01:05:08,167
Sorry, buddy. Gotta send
you back to the Spirit Realm.

931
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:09,961
Skadoosh!

932
01:05:11,411 --> 01:05:12,967
Okay, that didn't work.

933
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:15,408
Let me try one more time.
Skadoosh.

934
01:05:15,433 --> 01:05:17,559
Skadoosh, skadoosh, skadoosh.
What the?

935
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:19,586
Hold on, wait.
It's working.

936
01:05:19,587 --> 01:05:21,733
No.
Nooo!

937
01:05:26,071 --> 01:05:28,114
No, it's not.

938
01:05:28,137 --> 01:05:30,516
Did Oogway teach you
that little trick?

939
01:05:30,539 --> 01:05:33,867
Too bad.
It only works on mortals.

940
01:05:33,868 --> 01:05:37,790
And I am a spirit warrior.

941
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:39,210
Come!

942
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:55,141
Ooof.

943
01:06:02,456 --> 01:06:04,428
Oh.
Aw!

944
01:06:06,525 --> 01:06:07,846
Whoa!

945
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,773
Son!

946
01:06:23,844 --> 01:06:25,097
Po!

947
01:06:27,131 --> 01:06:31,677
I was wrong. I'm sorry.
Run. Run!

948
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:48,406
So, Oogway, this was the one
destined to stop me?

949
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:53,690
I will have his chi
and then all of theirs.

950
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:09,955
And you...
Hehahahaha.

951
01:07:10,859 --> 01:07:15,961
You really thought you can
send me back to the Spirit Realm?

952
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:23,600
You are just a stupid mortal.

953
01:07:24,296 --> 01:07:26,945
It only works on mortals.

954
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:31,469
You're right.
I can't send you there.

955
01:07:31,998 --> 01:07:35,321
But I can take you there.
What's that?

956
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:37,550
Oh.
What?

957
01:07:37,569 --> 01:07:39,459
- Po.
- Son!

958
01:07:39,582 --> 01:07:41,299
Skadoosh.

959
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,787
- Son!
- Son!

960
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:44,934
No!

961
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:47,214
- Aw!
- Aw!

962
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:08,063
What... What happened?
Where is Po?

963
01:08:08,087 --> 01:08:11,222
He took Kai away.
He saved us.

964
01:08:11,223 --> 01:08:12,855
No.

965
01:08:14,062 --> 01:08:17,456
He saved us
but who's saving him?

966
01:08:21,477 --> 01:08:25,493
Whoa, the Spirit Realm!
It worked!

967
01:08:25,494 --> 01:08:27,772
Get off me, you...

968
01:08:27,796 --> 01:08:30,482
You brought me back?

969
01:08:30,578 --> 01:08:33,127
Don't blame me. I tried to finish this
in the regular realm.

970
01:08:33,128 --> 01:08:35,726
And we'll finish it here.

971

Fight.

975
01:09:17,322 --> 01:09:19,411
We have to help him.

976
01:09:19,527 --> 01:09:20,617
We have to help him.

977
01:09:20,642 --> 01:09:23,527
Okay, everyone gather around.
That's it. Come in close.

978
01:09:23,528 --> 01:09:26,408
Come on.
We can do this.

979
01:09:33,266 --> 01:09:38,323
Po, you taught us
who we were meant to be.

980
01:09:41,184 --> 01:09:43,314
A father.

981
01:09:46,856 --> 01:09:50,135
- A friend.
- A dumpling kicker.

982
01:09:50,167 --> 01:09:53,345
- A lethal fighting machine.
- A hugger.

983
01:09:54,669 --> 01:09:56,893
A nunchuck chick.

984
01:09:56,894 --> 01:09:59,315
Stripey baby.

985
01:09:59,915 --> 01:10:02,025
A family

986
01:10:29,954 --> 01:10:31,611
Sweet.

987
01:10:31,636 --> 01:10:32,779
Ah!

988
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:47,605
Who are you?

989
01:10:47,628 --> 01:10:50,077
I've been asking
the same question.

990
01:10:53,997 --> 01:10:56,116
Am I the son of a panda?

991
01:10:56,117 --> 01:10:59,463
The son of a goose?
A student?

992
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:01,286
A teacher?

993
01:11:02,044 --> 01:11:05,874
Turns out,
I'm all of them.

994
01:11:13,687 --> 01:11:17,810
I am the Dragon Warrior.

995
01:11:17,835 --> 01:11:20,409
Get it?
See the giant dragon?

996
01:11:20,433 --> 01:11:21,614
Ha ha ha!

997
01:11:21,638 --> 01:11:24,150
Get ready to feel the thunder.

998
01:11:24,151 --> 01:11:26,217
This is awesome!

999
01:11:26,241 --> 01:11:29,124
Ho ho ho ho.
Ha ha!

1000
01:11:31,813 --> 01:11:34,444
Waa hoo!

1001
01:11:43,445 --> 01:11:44,718
Oh oh.

1002
01:11:50,707 --> 01:11:52,460
Belly gong.

1003
01:11:53,029 --> 01:11:54,645
Butt slap.

1004
01:11:57,133 --> 01:12:00,287
Perhaps a bit of lunch
cause I'm starving.

1005
01:12:03,607 --> 01:12:04,930
Mmm.

1006
01:12:18,863 --> 01:12:20,606
Let's do this!

1007
01:12:24,453 --> 01:12:25,860
Heads up.

1008
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,597
It took me 500 years
to take Oogway's chi.

1009
01:12:43,621 --> 01:12:47,070
I will have yours if it
takes me 500 more.

1010
01:12:47,094 --> 01:12:50,434
Chtity chitty chat chat, chitchat.

1011
01:13:00,052 --> 01:13:04,121
You want my chi so bad?
Then take it.

1012
01:13:10,243 --> 01:13:14,911
Yes, the power is mine.

1013
01:13:16,439 --> 01:13:19,176
Wait, no.
It's too much.

1014
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:21,872
That's too much.
No.

1015
01:13:25,147 --> 01:13:27,345
Noooo!

1016
01:13:38,673 --> 01:13:40,389
Where'd he go?

1017
01:13:47,447 --> 01:13:49,284
- We're back.
- Bestie.

1018
01:13:49,307 --> 01:13:51,253
I'm still green.
It didn't work!

1019
01:13:51,254 --> 01:13:53,669
Oh wait, that's my normal green.

1020
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:56,981
- Stripey baby
- Not a baby, not a baby!

1021
01:13:57,005 --> 01:13:58,567
Antenna of Fear.

1022
01:13:58,591 --> 01:13:59,749
What about Po?

1023
01:13:59,774 --> 01:14:02,832
- Have you seen Po?
- No, he's not here?

1024
01:14:03,098 --> 01:14:05,534
Po?
Po?

1025
01:14:05,639 --> 01:14:07,773
Why isn't he back?

1026
01:14:17,427 --> 01:14:21,833
- Dragon warrior.
- Oogway? Whoaaa.

1027
01:14:24,716 --> 01:14:26,412
I can't believe it.

1028
01:14:26,413 --> 01:14:29,710
- Whoa, you're extra shiny.
- As are you.

1029
01:14:29,733 --> 01:14:31,716
I know, right? It's like
the best cape ever.

1030
01:14:31,741 --> 01:14:33,995
When I run with it,
then it looks really cool.

1031
01:14:34,019 --> 01:14:36,252
It suits you.
You've grown.

1032
01:14:36,253 --> 01:14:40,072
- Yeah, I gotta lay off the panda buffet.
- Grown up.

1033
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:44,774
As I hoped you would
when I sent the message to your father.

1034
01:14:44,798 --> 01:14:45,602
Huh.

1035
01:14:45,626 --> 01:14:48,506
You sent the universe mail?
Whoa!

1036
01:14:48,530 --> 01:14:52,500
Yes, because the universe needed you.

1037
01:14:52,524 --> 01:14:53,879
Me?

1038
01:14:54,696 --> 01:14:59,020
You finally became the panda
you were always meant to be.

1039
01:14:59,021 --> 01:15:01,196
But how'd you know I could?

1040
01:15:01,219 --> 01:15:03,432
On the first day we met...

1041
01:15:03,433 --> 01:15:07,711
I saw the future of kung fu.

1042
01:15:09,303 --> 01:15:11,725
And the past.

1043
01:15:13,533 --> 01:15:17,653
I saw the panda
who could unite them both.

1044
01:15:17,677 --> 01:15:20,684
That is why I chose you, Po.

1045
01:15:20,708 --> 01:15:24,449
Both sides of the Yin and Yang.

1046
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:28,303
And my true successor.

1047
01:15:30,412 --> 01:15:32,942
Me?
I can't-I can't take that.

1048
01:15:32,965 --> 01:15:34,661
Just take it.

1049
01:15:34,661 --> 01:15:36,755
I have a bigger one.

1050
01:15:37,731 --> 01:15:41,072
I mean, you're enlightening
and everything. I'm just....

1051
01:15:41,095 --> 01:15:43,160
Huh.
Ooooh.

1052
01:15:43,185 --> 01:15:45,609
- Really?
- Yes.

1053
01:15:55,571 --> 01:15:56,859
Now, what do we do?

1054
01:15:56,882 --> 01:15:59,838
Hmm, you tell me.

1055
01:15:59,862 --> 01:16:02,106
No, Oogway, don't go!

1056
01:16:02,129 --> 01:16:05,622
I'm not going anywhere.
I live here.

1057
01:16:05,645 --> 01:16:07,693
Oh right.

1058
01:16:07,717 --> 01:16:11,706
It's you who must decide
whether to stay or go.

1059
01:16:11,729 --> 01:16:15,199
- Wait, I can go back?
- Who knows?

1060
01:16:15,223 --> 01:16:17,199
I've never tried.

1061
01:16:30,593 --> 01:16:32,020
Wow!

1062
01:16:42,324 --> 01:16:43,511
Po.

1063
01:16:43,535 --> 01:16:46,764
Ohhh.
You can fly.

1064
01:16:51,655 --> 01:16:54,253
Dad, Dad, Dads!

1065
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:56,552
- Son.
- Son.

1066
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:01,350
Don't you go disappearing
in petals ever again.

1067
01:17:01,374 --> 01:17:02,944
We thought we lost you.

1068
01:17:02,945 --> 01:17:07,730
No, you saved me.
You all did.

1069
01:17:08,632 --> 01:17:11,259
Now come on over here.

1070
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:13,167
Hugs

1071
01:17:15,595 --> 01:17:17,446
Master Shifu!

1072
01:17:17,469 --> 01:17:20,285
The student has truly
become the tea...

1073
01:17:20,309 --> 01:17:21,872
Wait, where did you get that?

1074
01:17:21,895 --> 01:17:25,083
Oh this. Oogway gave it
to me in the Spirit Realm.

1075
01:17:25,107 --> 01:17:29,529
- Oh. Of course he did.
- I think I mastered chi.

1076
01:17:29,827 --> 01:17:33,031
Oh.
Of course you did.

1077
01:17:33,788 --> 01:17:36,250
Can you teach me?

1078
01:17:38,864 --> 01:17:40,527
Ready!

1079
01:18:07,088 --> 01:18:08,721
Monkey, help me.

1080
01:18:08,745 --> 01:18:09,983
Greeny baby.

1081
01:18:09,983 --> 01:18:11,922
Get her off me!

1082
01:18:17,714 --> 01:18:20,155
Mmm.
Hello.

1083
01:18:29,615 --> 01:18:31,159
Skadoosh.

1084
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,899
Panda asthma.
