1
00:00:42,714 --> 00:00:44,341
The Lord of the Skies!

2
00:00:44,508 --> 00:00:47,678
How fucking elegant, motherfucker.

3
00:00:47,844 --> 00:00:50,847
-Don't tease.
-God damn, fucker.

4
00:00:53,392 --> 00:00:55,894
-Your little brother?
-Yes. Alvaro.

5
00:00:56,061 --> 00:00:57,396
Come here, son.

6
00:00:57,563 --> 00:01:00,732
-You also get a hug.
-Sir.

7
00:01:03,485 --> 00:01:05,112
How are you doing?

8
00:01:06,196 --> 00:01:09,700
320 million kinds of okay.

9
00:01:10,492 --> 00:01:13,620
Doesn't it smell like
the fucking US. Treasury in here?

10
00:01:14,454 --> 00:01:16,748
-This half is yours.
-Yes?

11
00:01:16,915 --> 00:01:20,419
-Don't forget it.
-All right. We came at a good time, then.

12
00:01:20,586 --> 00:01:23,547
A Tuesday like any other, Pacho.
You know how it is.

13
00:01:24,673 --> 00:01:25,924
Motherfucker.

14
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:27,342
-Let's go to the house.
-Let's go.

15
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,513
-All right. Son, do you like margaritas?
-Of course I do.

16
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,141
Great, because I have a Margarita for you.

17
00:01:34,474 --> 00:01:36,351
She'll suck you dry.

18
00:01:42,482 --> 00:01:43,483
Let's go.

19
00:01:48,363 --> 00:01:50,657
Take the money and destroy the plane.

20
00:07:09,184 --> 00:07:10,810
<i>-Gracias.</i>
-Captain Calderón.

21
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:12,395
We're happy to be here.

22
00:07:13,313 --> 00:07:15,065
And what brings you to Cali?

23
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:18,526
We've got some addresses
we want to investigate.

24
00:07:19,527 --> 00:07:21,196
Cartel-related?

25
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:24,366
Not necessarily.

26
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:27,577
What a surprise.
DEA agents that don't trust us.

27
00:07:27,744 --> 00:07:30,246
How did that work out
for the last two guys?

28
00:07:30,413 --> 00:07:33,416
Friend, in Cali, there are more
corrupt cops than there are churches.

29
00:07:35,752 --> 00:07:37,045
You don't trust me? I understand.

30
00:07:37,212 --> 00:07:40,215
But if you want to get anything done
in Cali, you need the police's help.

31
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:44,970
If not me, someone else.

32
00:07:45,136 --> 00:07:47,013
Not my rule.

33
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,765
-I understand.
-Good.

34
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:53,770
The addresses are linked
to cartel financial operations.

35
00:07:54,354 --> 00:07:57,357
We want to put eyes on them.
See if any of the dots start connecting...

36
00:07:59,985 --> 00:08:02,070
You've come a long way to connect dots.

37
00:08:02,988 --> 00:08:04,906
We work with what we've got.

38
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,369
Unless you can tell me where I can find
Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez.

39
00:08:11,454 --> 00:08:15,291
If they didn't own half of the city,
I couldn't even be sure they exist.

40
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:19,337
The Rodriguez brothers are ghosts.

41
00:10:31,886 --> 00:10:34,222
He served as director at Interamericas.

42
00:10:34,597 --> 00:10:36,391
The Rodriguez brothers' bank.

43
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:40,186
They later gave him a more important job.

44
00:10:40,645 --> 00:10:44,440
-Do you have an address for Jurado?
-I can get it for you.

45
00:10:47,443 --> 00:10:49,737
So what happened
since the last time I saw you?

46
00:10:50,238 --> 00:10:52,490
Are you going to take these men on,
or what?

47
00:10:54,242 --> 00:10:57,162
-I'm going to do my job.
-And your bosses?

48
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:00,665
Do they know what you're doing?

49
00:12:33,091 --> 00:12:34,842
The dining room is over here.

50
00:12:36,302 --> 00:12:37,887
You have a room over here.

51
00:12:38,513 --> 00:12:40,139
You have another one over here.

52
00:12:40,974 --> 00:12:43,226
And here, you have the living room.

53
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:52,068
The dimmer is over here.

54
00:12:54,195 --> 00:12:56,447
And you can adjust the light.

55
00:12:58,032 --> 00:13:00,493
Well... you get the idea.

56
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,663
-No. I don't understand.
-What don't you understand?

57
00:13:05,373 --> 00:13:07,125
Does this seem normal to you?

58
00:13:07,292 --> 00:13:08,710
You indicated to Mr. Rodriguez

59
00:13:08,876 --> 00:13:11,671
you were uncertain about returning
to the North Valley.

60
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:15,383
And that's why he bought me a palace.
With dimmers.

61
00:13:16,801 --> 00:13:18,803
Please tell Don Miguel thank you,

62
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,931
but I need to think about
his generous offer.

63
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:25,601
We have that dinner tonight.

64
00:13:26,978 --> 00:13:28,271
With your friends?

65
00:13:29,689 --> 00:13:30,982
With the investors.

66
00:13:31,983 --> 00:13:35,069
They're not going to like
the six month delay.

67
00:13:35,236 --> 00:13:38,239
And I think it's best if we don't mention
the Rodriguez brothers by name.

68
00:13:43,536 --> 00:13:45,538
I know you're embarrassed by what I do.

69
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:55,048
I know you did it for your family.

70
00:13:55,214 --> 00:13:58,009
But if these people like everything
they hear tonight,

71
00:13:58,176 --> 00:14:01,012
you'll have your own security firm
the second these six months are up.

72
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:04,891
-Ready!
-Good!

73
00:14:05,058 --> 00:14:06,017
A choir!

74
00:14:08,436 --> 00:14:10,021
All right, say goodbye to Dad.
We're leaving.

75
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:11,856
-Bye.
-Bye.

76
00:14:12,023 --> 00:14:14,567
All right. Let's go, or we'll be late.

77
00:14:15,443 --> 00:14:16,944
Will you make it on time?

78
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:19,530
If you're wearing the dress
with the flowers, yes.

79
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:25,536
Let's go, girls.

80
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:29,415
Today is a busy day for us, boys.

81
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,336
Bosses have meetings all day
at the National Hotel.

82
00:14:34,253 --> 00:14:38,132
I need you to pre-sweep
each and every location on this schedule.

83
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:42,303
And I don't want a bunch of cars parked
like bullshit, blocking escape routes.

84
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,473
-He's looking at you, Montez.
-Of course I'm talking to you, you idiot.

85
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:51,020
Don Miguel's team on channel six.
Don Gilberto's, channel eight.

86
00:14:51,187 --> 00:14:53,648
Jorge says that the DEA is visiting Cali.

87
00:14:54,273 --> 00:14:57,276
Two agents from Bogotà. They're new.
They're working with the National Police.

88
00:14:59,404 --> 00:15:02,448
But they don't have warrants.
They're tourists.

89
00:15:02,615 --> 00:15:04,909
They need permission
to wipe their own asses.

90
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:09,622
Regardless, while they're in Cali,
we'll be watching them.

91
00:15:11,582 --> 00:15:14,710
-That's your job, Enrique, my brother.
-Yes, sir.

92
00:15:14,877 --> 00:15:16,379
That's all, gentlemen.

93
00:15:16,754 --> 00:15:19,340
Communicate. Stay safe. Get to work.

94
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:25,304
I have to duck out early.
It's a work thing for Paola.

95
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:27,598
Of course.

96
00:15:28,266 --> 00:15:30,101
Do you want to practice your English?

97
00:15:30,601 --> 00:15:32,687
Starkman, the American lawyer,
arrives today.

98
00:15:32,854 --> 00:15:34,981
Can you pick him up from the airport?

99
00:15:36,691 --> 00:15:38,734
Aren't you worried about the tourists?

100
00:15:39,777 --> 00:15:42,447
The second team's
never as good as the first.

101
00:15:57,962 --> 00:16:00,715
If they were ever there at all.

102
00:16:43,883 --> 00:16:45,510
Where are we headed next?

103
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:49,222
INTERNATIONAL ARRIVALS

104
00:18:09,176 --> 00:18:12,555
I assume you would prefer U.S. currency?

105
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:13,973
Of course.

106
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,143
Currency aside, we aren't in the habit
of paying for things in advance.

107
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:21,480
What guarantee do we have
that you will provide what you promise?

108
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:23,065
Forgive my brother.

109
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:26,569
We are grateful for the support
you and your people have offered.

110
00:18:27,153 --> 00:18:29,655
This afternoon, our associate,
Mr. Pallomari,

111
00:18:29,822 --> 00:18:33,284
will prepare the contribution
and arrange delivery.

112
00:18:34,285 --> 00:18:35,453
Very well.

113
00:18:36,621 --> 00:18:39,874
The contribution should be divided
among seven men.

114
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,250
Their names are on the list.

115
00:18:46,172 --> 00:18:47,923
All right, very well. Going forward,

116
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,886
I think it's best if Mr. Pallomari deals
with my colleague, Mr. Giraldo.

117
00:18:52,887 --> 00:18:54,013
As you wish.

118
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:57,433
Have a great day, gentlemen.

119
00:19:04,774 --> 00:19:07,777
Well, our surrender has been bought.
Now it must be paid for.

120
00:19:11,197 --> 00:19:13,824
And they say we're the criminals.

121
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:16,577
Sons of bitches.

122
00:19:16,744 --> 00:19:19,747
Small price to pay, brother,
for the rest of your life.

123
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:23,292
Gentlemen, I will prepare
these payments myself,

124
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:25,419
as soon as I'm back in the office.

125
00:19:25,795 --> 00:19:28,714
And I'll make sure
that all of this is in order.

126
00:19:29,465 --> 00:19:32,259
Mr. Starkman is next, the lawyer.

127
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:15,738
The Arellano Felix brothers
are still wasting time with heroin.

128
00:21:16,572 --> 00:21:19,366
Hey! What? You're not going to say hello?

129
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,203
-Hello.
-Are you in a bad mood or what?

130
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:39,053
Amado... this is the life.

131
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,596
You guys helped me.

132
00:21:40,763 --> 00:21:43,682
I moved the last 100 tons
in less than 50 days.

133
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:46,310
You tell me if we're a great team or not.

134
00:21:46,685 --> 00:21:48,354
That's why we're here.

135
00:21:48,938 --> 00:21:50,898
Can you handle a bigger package?

136
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:55,569
I'm the Lord of the Skies, brother.
What do you think?

137
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,197
I can move however much you give me.

138
00:22:40,948 --> 00:22:43,701
I just have two questions: How much?

139
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,496
And for how much longer, Pacho?

140
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:50,124
Because I know about your deal.

141
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,501
I know you want to turn yourselves in.

142
00:22:54,295 --> 00:22:56,422
There is a deal on the table, Amado.

143
00:22:56,922 --> 00:22:59,925
But we have six months
to turn ourselves in. That's the truth.

144
00:23:01,468 --> 00:23:04,263
Until then,
we will honour our commitment to you.

145
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,806
Right, and after?

146
00:23:07,182 --> 00:23:08,475
What happens after that?

147
00:23:11,395 --> 00:23:12,980
The business will adjust.

148
00:23:13,147 --> 00:23:16,150
This I know. It will always adjust.
This will never end.

149
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:21,780
There will be other partners
and more drugs. But what about you?

150
00:23:22,907 --> 00:23:24,325
What will happen to you?

151
00:23:25,492 --> 00:23:28,495
You can't tell me you're going to retire,
as if this was any normal business.

152
00:23:31,123 --> 00:23:32,958
You know this is a way of life.

153
00:23:33,751 --> 00:23:36,211
It retires you when it's done with you.

154
00:23:37,504 --> 00:23:41,467
Or are you going to start playing golf
like an old man?

155
00:23:52,102 --> 00:23:55,105
We need to count on you maintaining
the same terms on this last shipment.

156
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:02,613
Done.

157
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:06,825
It'll be my gift to the Gentlemen of Cali.

158
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:10,162
All right? But...
you have to come with me to Juérez.

159
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:16,293
-I want to show you something.
-What is it?

160
00:24:19,046 --> 00:24:20,714
The future, Pacho.

161
00:24:21,924 --> 00:24:23,759
The fucking future, that's all.

162
00:24:29,807 --> 00:24:31,809
-Here's your passport.
-Thank you.

163
00:24:34,812 --> 00:24:36,730
All right, and you board through Gate 15.

164
00:24:41,151 --> 00:24:43,028
-Have a great trip.
-Thank you.

165
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:45,406
Have a great day.

166
00:24:46,198 --> 00:24:47,199
Next.

167
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:45,150
{\an8}SEARCH WARRANT

168
00:26:49,822 --> 00:26:52,825
This is the kind of bullshit I don't like.
Are you playing me or what?

169
00:27:30,863 --> 00:27:33,866
I need a tactical team sent to 15th Street
and 4th Avenue, copy?

170
00:27:35,617 --> 00:27:38,620
<i>Copy that. Requesting a tactical team
at 15th Street and 4th Avenue.</i>

171
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,540
You do realize, don't you,

172
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:45,085
after we surrender,
all of this shit will end.

173
00:27:46,461 --> 00:27:49,840
No more sitting by the pool,
smoking your cigar,

174
00:27:50,007 --> 00:27:52,718
telling everyone what to do.

175
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:55,971
Look, Miguel,
I'm tired of telling people what to do.

176
00:27:57,431 --> 00:27:59,558
And no one has ever listened to you.

177
00:28:01,018 --> 00:28:02,436
What's the difference?

178
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:11,904
But you know what?

179
00:28:12,905 --> 00:28:15,908
Never, in human history, have two brothers
accomplished what we have.

180
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:24,499
We aren't the first people in history
to build an empire, Gilberto.

181
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:28,295
But we're the first to retire
leaving the empire intact.

182
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:33,759
If Mom were alive, she'd be proud.

183
00:28:34,468 --> 00:28:37,804
Brothers are well, nephews are well,
sons are well.

184
00:28:41,141 --> 00:28:44,978
<i>Boss, we just heard a call
that a tactical team left Jamundi station</i>

185
00:28:45,145 --> 00:28:47,022
<i>heading to 4th Avenue.</i>

186
00:28:49,316 --> 00:28:50,734
Enrique, where are you?

187
00:28:51,026 --> 00:28:53,111
Watching our visitors from the DEA.

188
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:55,405
They've been checking addresses
all over town.

189
00:28:55,572 --> 00:28:57,658
But right now, they're stopped,
just doing nothing.

190
00:28:57,824 --> 00:28:59,034
Yes, but where are you?

191
00:28:59,201 --> 00:29:02,287
At 15th Street and... 4th. On 4th Avenue.

192
00:29:02,454 --> 00:29:05,874
Enrique, fuck!
There's a police convoy coming at you!

193
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:07,501
<i>Get Pallomari out of there now!</i>

194
00:29:31,692 --> 00:29:33,735
Answer, you bastard, answer.

195
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:39,283
-Hello? What's up?
<i>-Listen, it's Salcedo.</i>

196
00:29:39,449 --> 00:29:42,035
You're going to have unwelcome guests.
Leave now.

197
00:29:42,703 --> 00:29:46,081
I don't have time for this.
I'm supervising an important project.

198
00:29:46,248 --> 00:29:48,792
<i>That's exactly why I need you to get out.</i>

199
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:50,043
Just because you say so?

200
00:29:50,877 --> 00:29:53,588
I know you're arranging an important
transaction for the bosses this afternoon.

201
00:29:53,755 --> 00:29:55,841
Listen, this is none of your business.

202
00:29:56,008 --> 00:29:58,343
<i>I'll bet your desk is covered
with American dollars.</i>

203
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,220
<i>Look, Guillermo, please.</i>

204
00:30:00,387 --> 00:30:03,932
You've got papers. You've got names.
You've got things that shouldn't be seen.

205
00:30:04,099 --> 00:30:05,225
-Jorge...
<i>-Get out of there!</i>

206
00:30:05,392 --> 00:30:07,311
You do your job and I'll do mine.

207
00:30:08,061 --> 00:30:11,440
This is my job! I'm telling you...
Son of a bitch!

208
00:30:38,175 --> 00:30:39,343
Fuck your mother.

209
00:30:40,302 --> 00:30:42,596
I need you to check the paper shredders

210
00:30:42,763 --> 00:30:44,639
and the floppy disks
still in the computers.

211
00:30:44,806 --> 00:30:47,809
Invoices. Bills of lading.
Anything on the computers.

212
00:30:52,064 --> 00:30:52,939
Let's go.

213
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:22,302
Fucking shit!

214
00:31:39,152 --> 00:31:42,531
-Gentlemen, how may I help you?
-Seventh floor. Mr. Pallomari's office.

215
00:31:42,697 --> 00:31:44,866
All right. I'll let them know you're here
so you can head up.

216
00:31:46,326 --> 00:31:48,954
People love surprises.

217
00:31:49,121 --> 00:31:51,790
Gentlemen, you can't...

218
00:32:26,575 --> 00:32:28,785
You. What the fuck
are you still doing here?

219
00:32:28,952 --> 00:32:31,705
What the fuck am I doing? My job.
We told your associate the same thing.

220
00:32:31,872 --> 00:32:33,373
Sorry, boss, I tried, but he won't listen.

221
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,375
-You go get the car.
-Please get out.

222
00:32:35,542 --> 00:32:37,627
-I have to finish this. Fuck your mother.
-Take the back stairs.

223
00:32:37,794 --> 00:32:39,588
-Yes, sir.
-Finish what?

224
00:32:39,754 --> 00:32:41,381
My job, Jorge.

225
00:32:43,633 --> 00:32:46,136
No. Please, we have to get rid
of all of that now.

226
00:32:46,303 --> 00:32:48,346
We aren't arguing.
You aren't touching anything.

227
00:32:48,513 --> 00:32:50,307
I've got a method and a system.

228
00:32:50,474 --> 00:32:51,475
-A method and a system?
-Yes, sir.

229
00:32:51,641 --> 00:32:55,270
Yes? What you've got is ten years of jail
time sitting on your desk, you idiot.

230
00:32:55,437 --> 00:32:56,730
-Get out.

231
00:32:56,897 --> 00:32:59,441
Attention! Colombian National Police!

232
00:33:00,775 --> 00:33:02,194
Where are the files?

233
00:33:03,236 --> 00:33:04,362
Get to work. Let's go!

234
00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:07,157
This is an office.

235
00:33:08,658 --> 00:33:11,244
We're working. How can I help you?

236
00:33:11,411 --> 00:33:14,664
We need access to your files, invoices,
and all of your correspondence.

237
00:33:18,251 --> 00:33:21,129
If that's the case,
I need to see a warrant.

238
00:33:21,296 --> 00:33:23,632
Are you supposed to be in charge?

239
00:33:26,343 --> 00:33:28,386
Well, yes, I'm in charge.

240
00:33:53,537 --> 00:33:56,915
Good morning.
I have to see every invoice you have.

241
00:34:02,629 --> 00:34:04,422
Hey!

242
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:07,759
This says documents only.
Fuck your mother.

243
00:34:12,305 --> 00:34:13,848
You didn't get that?

244
00:34:14,015 --> 00:34:16,142
Only papers. Documents only.

245
00:34:18,562 --> 00:34:20,897
Keep an eye on the things
they're taking. Now!

246
00:34:21,064 --> 00:34:21,982
Yes, sir.

247
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,201
Leave it. Let it be.

248
00:34:33,368 --> 00:34:35,453
Chivo, check everything
and make an inventory, all right?

249
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,633
That's private.

250
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,885
Ignacio, please show the gentleman
last year's documents.

251
00:34:51,052 --> 00:34:52,053
This way, please.

252
00:35:40,477 --> 00:35:41,561
I must insist.

253
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,212
Do you have a bill of lading'?
Yes? Let me see.

254
00:36:07,379 --> 00:36:09,839
More? Everything.

255
00:36:10,006 --> 00:36:11,257
-Just these?
-And the copies below.

256
00:36:11,424 --> 00:36:12,717
-These as well, no?
-Yes, sir.

257
00:36:12,884 --> 00:36:14,678
-All right. '93. Yeah?
-Those are the most recent.

258
00:36:19,432 --> 00:36:21,643
EVIDENCE

259
00:36:24,771 --> 00:36:25,772
Grab that.

260
00:38:41,658 --> 00:38:44,619
This 24-hour party thing...

261
00:38:46,162 --> 00:38:48,373
is tiring after a couple of days.

262
00:38:52,836 --> 00:38:55,004
Can you imagine if it was your life?

263
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:01,052
What's on your mind?

264
00:39:02,512 --> 00:39:06,516
Dad, and the last thing he said to me.

265
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,685
What? "Get the fuck out"?

266
00:39:09,435 --> 00:39:10,436
No.

267
00:39:11,688 --> 00:39:15,525
He said... that in this world...

268
00:39:16,776 --> 00:39:20,697
there was no place for a man like me.

269
00:39:25,243 --> 00:39:26,995
I made a place for myself.

270
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,915
I proved him wrong.

271
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,129
And now, I have to give it all up.

272
00:39:41,301 --> 00:39:43,803
What kind of man would I be
if I gave it all up?

273
00:39:44,345 --> 00:39:45,638
I don't know, brother.

274
00:39:47,557 --> 00:39:51,352
But what I do know is that you have
a couple billion dollars...

275
00:39:52,395 --> 00:39:55,273
and the rest of your life
to figure it out.

276
00:40:03,197 --> 00:40:04,240
<i>What are they giving me?</i>

277
00:40:04,824 --> 00:40:06,534
What do you mean,
"What are they giving you?"

278
00:40:06,701 --> 00:40:08,620
They took my son, didn't they?

279
00:40:09,704 --> 00:40:11,539
They have to give us something.

280
00:40:14,459 --> 00:40:16,085
Have they offered you something?

281
00:40:17,086 --> 00:40:18,463
An apartment.

282
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,589
<i>Accept it.</i>

283
00:40:19,756 --> 00:40:21,633
<i>Afterwards, I'll sell it for cash.</i>

284
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:25,595
<i>We'll take their money now.
Later, we'll take vengeance.</i>

285
00:40:25,762 --> 00:40:28,514
<i>-Do it, then get back up here.</i>
—Can you wake Pedro up?

286
00:40:28,681 --> 00:40:32,560
-I want to speak with him.
<i>-Don't worry about Pedro. He's sleeping.</i>

287
00:40:40,443 --> 00:40:42,362
I heard we cut it close today.

288
00:40:42,779 --> 00:40:44,989
I thought they didn't have a warrant.

289
00:40:45,406 --> 00:40:47,450
That's what I was told
by our friend on the force.

290
00:40:47,617 --> 00:40:50,662
A few more seconds
and we'd have had real trouble.

291
00:40:51,287 --> 00:40:54,791
Those new DEA guys
are sharper than they look.

292
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:57,710
Well, luckily, we have you.

293
00:40:59,796 --> 00:41:01,130
Did they get anything?

294
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:02,548
Some files.

295
00:41:02,715 --> 00:41:04,384
So nothing. Good.

296
00:41:04,717 --> 00:41:06,302
I'll take care of the rest today.

297
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:09,472
That thing you've got tonight with Paola,
enjoy yourself. Go on.

298
00:42:00,064 --> 00:42:03,234
But anything we find
we'll be sure to share with you.

299
00:42:03,401 --> 00:42:06,237
I was instructed
you should be back in Bogotà tonight.

300
00:42:06,821 --> 00:42:08,406
You're going out on the last flight.

301
00:48:09,308 --> 00:48:12,770
-And where are they now?
<i>-I just put them on a plane to Bogota'.</i>

302
00:48:12,937 --> 00:48:14,688
-And the files?
<i>-We've got them.</i>

303
00:48:14,855 --> 00:48:15,689
Are you sure?

304
00:48:15,856 --> 00:48:19,235
Look, they tricked me
with that fucking warrant, all right?

305
00:48:20,236 --> 00:48:23,239
<i>And I couldn't warn you because we were
all together like a fucking family.</i>

306
00:48:25,616 --> 00:48:28,160
These Americans know what they're doing.

307
00:48:28,327 --> 00:48:30,704
<i>They aren't fucking idiots.</i>

308
00:49:55,873 --> 00:49:58,876
Well, the truth is, we're very interested
in your proposal, Jorge.

309
00:50:00,127 --> 00:50:02,129
And in your potential for growth.

310
00:50:02,296 --> 00:50:06,258
You've exceeded Paola's description,
which wasn't easy.

311
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,514
Of course, we were inconvenienced
by the six-month delay, which...

312
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,516
took us by surprise.

313
00:50:16,101 --> 00:50:18,521
I take my commitments very seriously,
gentlemen.

314
00:50:18,687 --> 00:50:22,024
And I couldn't leave without ensuring
my replacement met the standard

315
00:50:22,191 --> 00:50:23,943
they've come to expect.

316
00:50:24,568 --> 00:50:25,402
Go wait for him over there.

317
00:50:25,569 --> 00:50:28,197
-Good evening. How are you?
-Good, thank you.

318
00:50:32,743 --> 00:50:35,287
Well, I think that merits
another bottle of wine, no?

319
00:50:35,454 --> 00:50:36,413
Yes.

320
00:50:38,582 --> 00:50:40,167
Look at that son of a bitch.

321
00:50:41,877 --> 00:50:44,213
Thinks his shit doesn't stink, or what?

322
00:50:52,221 --> 00:50:53,430
Thank you.

323
00:50:53,639 --> 00:50:56,642
So, a security expert married to a rising
star in one of Cali's top law firms.

324
00:51:00,145 --> 00:51:01,730
Have you worked together before?

325
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:05,484
My compliments.

326
00:51:09,321 --> 00:51:10,281
David Rodriguez.

327
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:13,909
How are you?

328
00:51:19,456 --> 00:51:22,167
Don't let the elegant suit fool you.

329
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:26,797
This guy's a real son of a bitch.

330
00:51:27,381 --> 00:51:28,257
Seriously.

331
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,385
In fact, he's one of our best men.

332
00:51:32,636 --> 00:51:33,470
You see?

333
00:51:36,098 --> 00:51:37,308
Enjoy it.

334
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,394
Ma'am.

335
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:56,660
You... Where do you know him from?
Is he a friend of yours?

336
00:51:57,036 --> 00:51:59,371
You know Cali is a very small city.

337
00:52:00,247 --> 00:52:03,876
Even more so
when one is in the security business.

338
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,920
One must deal with all sorts of people.

339
00:52:13,052 --> 00:52:15,262
Is that the paperwork
I'm supposed to deliver?

340
00:52:16,305 --> 00:52:18,432
These documents are very sensitive.

341
00:52:19,475 --> 00:52:22,519
And I don't feel comfortable
transferring possession to anyone else.

342
00:52:23,771 --> 00:52:25,773
All right. Let's go, then.

343
00:52:33,072 --> 00:52:34,490
Open the door, Cordova.

344
00:52:35,115 --> 00:52:36,825
Go fuck yourself, Pallomari.

345
00:52:38,202 --> 00:52:39,286
In the front seat.

346
00:52:39,453 --> 00:52:42,039
What the fuck's wrong with you?
Open the door. Fuck your mother.

347
00:52:42,206 --> 00:52:44,333
In the front.
I'm not your fucking employee.

348
00:53:43,142 --> 00:53:46,270
Look, I haven't been able to reach
an agreement yet. He's very stubborn.

349
00:53:46,437 --> 00:53:49,106
<i>Listen to me, Pacho.
We have to seal the deal.</i>

350
00:53:49,273 --> 00:53:51,066
<i>It's very important.</i>

351
00:53:51,483 --> 00:53:54,486
Amado has to go to Juérez tomorrow.
I'll go with him and close the deal.

352
00:53:55,988 --> 00:53:58,073
<i>All right. Keep me informed.</i>

353
00:53:58,949 --> 00:53:59,825
<i>Good night.</i>

354
00:53:59,992 --> 00:54:01,410
Good night, Gilberto.

355
00:54:16,425 --> 00:54:18,177
Compliments of Mr. Carrillo.

356
00:54:54,963 --> 00:54:57,591
It's been a long time
since anyone asked me on a date.

357
00:54:58,717 --> 00:55:00,135
Come in, please.

358
00:55:05,432 --> 00:55:06,517
Take a seat.

359
00:55:07,059 --> 00:55:10,062
Sir... your offer of this apartment
is very generous.

360
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:14,691
But?

361
00:55:15,317 --> 00:55:19,279
But... I would like to know the terms.

362
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,367
The terms?

363
00:55:23,534 --> 00:55:25,994
How often will you come here to visit me?

364
00:55:27,454 --> 00:55:30,541
As often as you like.

365
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:32,584
Or never.

366
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:34,962
This is your home.

367
00:55:35,629 --> 00:55:37,214
Is there a monthly stipend?

368
00:55:38,882 --> 00:55:39,883
A stipend?

369
00:55:40,509 --> 00:55:43,512
Mr. Rodriguez, I married Claudio Salazar
when I was 18 years old.

370
00:55:45,222 --> 00:55:47,057
I knew nothing.

371
00:55:47,224 --> 00:55:50,227
Now I need to get away from his family,
and I need my son back.

372
00:55:52,729 --> 00:55:54,815
If you could help me with that...

373
00:55:57,317 --> 00:55:58,318
I can.

374
00:56:01,029 --> 00:56:02,531
Then I accept.

375
00:56:07,995 --> 00:56:09,621
It's great to hear that.

376
00:56:22,467 --> 00:56:24,595
Why don't you get some rest?

377
00:56:25,929 --> 00:56:27,097
Eat something.

378
00:56:27,723 --> 00:56:30,142
Tomorrow morning, I'll send for your son.

379
00:56:32,185 --> 00:56:33,478
How does that sound?

380
00:56:35,022 --> 00:56:36,273
Good.

381
00:56:37,649 --> 00:56:38,567
Take a seat.

382
00:57:47,052 --> 00:57:48,679
Sorry to interrupt.
