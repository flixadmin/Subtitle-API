1
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:15,719
Welcome, Lord Stark.

2
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,931
Grand Maester Pycelle has called
a meeting of the Small Council.

3
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,016
The honour of your presence is requested.

4
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:25,687
Get the girls settled in.
l'll be back in time for supper.

5
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,398
- And, Jory, you go with them.
- Yes, my lord.

6
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:32,027
lf you'd like to change into something
more appropriate...

7
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,581
[Doors creaking]

8
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,566
Thank the gods you're here, Stark.

9
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,778
About time we had
some stern northern leadership.

10
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:17,698
Glad to see you're protecting the throne.

11
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,783
Sturdy old thing.

12
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,244
How many kings' arses
have polished it, l wonder?

13
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,121
Um, what's the line?

14
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,499
The king shits and the Hand wipes.

15
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,835
Very handsome armour.

16
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,338
- Not a scratch on it.
- l know.

17
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:37,009
People have been swinging at me for years,
but they always seem to miss.

18
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,803
You've chosen your opponents wisely then.

19
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,056
l have a knack for it.

20
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:49,313
lt must be strange for you,
coming into this room.

21
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,568
l was standing right here
when it happened.

22
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,654
He was very brave, your brother.

23
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,573
Your father, too.

24
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,700
They didn't deserve to die like that.

25
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,620
Nobody deserves to die like that.

26
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,580
But you just stood there and watched.

27
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,625
500 men just stood there and watched.

28
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,377
All the great knights
of the Seven Kingdoms.

29
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,838
You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger?

30
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,466
No, Lord Stark.

31
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,678
500 men and this room
was silent as a crypt.

32
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,934
Except for the screams, of course,

33
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,019
and the Mad King laughing.

34
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,729
And later...

35
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,399
when l watched the Mad King die,

36
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:37,819
l remembered him laughing
as your father burned...

37
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,822
lt felt like justice.

38
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,453
ls that what you tell yourself at night?

39
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,374
You're a servant ofjustice?

40
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:54,962
That you were avenging my father when you
shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?

41
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:59,842
Tell me, if l'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly
instead of the back,

42
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,718
would you admire me more?

43
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,890
You served him well...
when serving was safe.

44
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,072
Lord Stark.

45
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:25,993
Lord Varys.

46
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,830
l was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles
on the Kingsroad.

47
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:33,584
We are all praying
for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.

48
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,920
A shame you didn't say a prayer
for the butcher's son.

49
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,341
Renly! You're looking well.

50
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,135
And you look tired from the road.

51
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,470
l told them this meeting could wait
another day, but...

52
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,265
[Man] But we have a kingdom
to look after.

53
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,476
l've hoped to meet you
for some time, Lord Stark.

54
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,063
- No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
- She has, Lord Baelish.

55
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:58,192
l understand you knew
my brother Brandon as well.

56
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:01,486
All too well.
l still carry a token of his esteem...

57
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,488
from navel to collarbone.

58
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,657
Perhaps you chose
the wrong man to duel with.

59
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,576
lt wasn't the man that l chose, my lord.

60
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,995
lt was Catelyn Tully.

61
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,332
A woman worth fighting for,
l'm sure you'll agree.

62
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,043
l humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.

63
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,670
Grand Maester.

64
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:21,048
How many years has it been?

65
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,635
- You were a young man.
- And you served another king.

66
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:29,181
Oh, how forgetful of me.

67
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,018
This belongs to you now.

68
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,481
Should we begin?

69
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,526
- Without the king?
- Winter may be coming,

70
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,904
but l'm afraid the same cannot
be said for my brother.

71
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,073
[Varys] His Grace has many cares.

72
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:50,827
He entrusts some small matters to us
that we might lighten the load.

73
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,747
We are the lords of small matters here.

74
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,713
My brother instructs us
to stage a tournament

75
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,216
in honour of Lord Stark's appointment
as Hand of the King.

76
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,886
- Mm, how much?
- 40,OOO gold dragons to the champion,

77
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,555
20,OOO to the runner-up,

78
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,724
20,OOO to the winning archer.

79
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,143
Can the treasury bear such expense?

80
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:18,105
l'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters
will accommodate, l expect.

81
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,400
We already owe Lord Tywin three million gold.
What's another 80,OOO?

82
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,277
Are you telling me the Crown
is three million in debt?

83
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:27,239
- l'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
- How could you let this happen?

84
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:31,493
The master of coin finds the money.
The king and the Hand spend it.

85
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:35,122
l will not believe Jon Arryn
allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.

86
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:38,041
Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice,

87
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,879
but l fear His Grace doesn't always listen.

88
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,464
''Counting coppers,'' he calls it.

89
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,384
l'll speak to him tomorrow.

90
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,720
This tournament is an extravagance
we cannot amord.

91
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,264
As you will.
But still, we'd best make our plans.

92
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,267
There will be no plans...
until l speak to Robert.

93
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,316
Forgive me, my lords. l'm...

94
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:06,820
- l had a long ride.
- You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

95
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,406
We serve at your pleasure.

96
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,498
- Ow!
- Please, it's nearly healed.

97
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,463
- It's ugly.
- A king should have scars.

98
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:28,300
You fought off a direwolf.
You're a warrior like your father.

99
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:32,095
l'm not like him. l didn't fight off anything.
It bit me and all l did was scream.

100
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,848
And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.

101
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:37,976
That's not true. You killed the beast.

102
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,271
You only spared the girl because of the love
your father bears her father.

103
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,731
l didn't, l...

104
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:47,528
When Aerys Targaryen sat on the iron throne,
your father was a rebel and a traitor.

105
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:51,198
Someday you'll sit on the throne
and the truth will be what you make it.

106
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,745
Do l have to marry her?

107
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,706
Yes.

108
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,959
She's very beautiful and young.

109
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:05,337
lf you don't like her, you only need
to see her on formal occasions

110
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:09,800
and when the time comes,
to make little princes and princesses.

111
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:14,847
And if you'd rather fuck painted whores,
you'll fuck painted whores.

112
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,474
And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins,
so be it.

113
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:21,770
You are my darling boy and the world
will be exactly as you want it to be.

114
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,693
Do something nice for the Stark girl.

115
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,611
- l don't want to.
- No, but you will.

116
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:34,575
The occasional kindness will spare you
all sorts of trouble down the road.

117
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,160
We allow the northerners too much power.

118
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:39,705
They consider themselves our equals.

119
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,331
How would you handle them?

120
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:47,129
l'd double their taxes and command them
to supply 10,OOO men to the royal army.

121
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,463
A royal army?

122
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,382
Why should every lord
command his own men?

123
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,676
lt's primitive, no better than the hill tribes.

124
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,846
We should have a standing army
of men loyal to the Crown,

125
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,639
trained by experienced soldiers,

126
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:01,351
instead of a mob of peasants
who've never held pikes in their lives.

127
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,812
And if the northerners rebel?

128
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,522
l'd crush them.

129
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:09,735
Seize Winterfell and install someone
Ioyal to the realm as warden of the North.

130
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,236
Uncle Kevan, maybe.

131
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:15,032
And these 10,OOO northern troops,
would they fight for you or their lord?

132
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:17,326
- For me. l'm their king.
- Mm-hm.

133
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,411
But you've just invaded their homeland,

134
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:22,247
- asked them to kill their brothers.
- l'm not asking.

135
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:25,250
The North cannot be held,
not by an outsider.

136
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,419
lt's too big and too wild.

137
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,087
And when the winter comes,
the seven gods together

138
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,340
couldn't save you and your royal army.

139
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:34,301
A good king knows
when to save his strength...

140
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,305
and when to destroy his enemies.

141
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,016
So you agree...

142
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,393
the Starks are enemies?

143
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:49,233
Everyone who isn't us...
is an enemy.

144
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,988
Enough of that, young lady.
Eat your food.

145
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,074
- l'm practicing.
- Practicing for what?

146
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,117
- The prince.
- Arya, stop!

147
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:02,371
He's a liar and a coward
and he killed my friend.

148
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,789
The Hound killed your friend.

149
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:06,333
The Hound does whatever
the prince tells him to do.

150
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,794
- You're an idiot.
- You're a liar, and if you told the truth,

151
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,087
Mycah would be alive.

152
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,588
Enough!

153
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,884
What's happening here?

154
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,220
Arya would rather act
like a beast than a lady.

155
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,266
Go to your room. We'll speak later.

156
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,817
That's for you, love.

157
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:44,997
The same dollmaker
makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys.

158
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,458
Don't you like it?

159
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:52,129
l haven't played with dolls since l was eight.

160
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:56,675
- May l be excused?
- You've barely eaten a thing.

161
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,928
lt's all right. Go on.

162
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:11,231
War was easier than daughters.

163
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,363
- [Knock on door]
- Go away!

164
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,949
[Ned] Arya, open the door.

165
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,170
May l come in?

166
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:42,387
- Whose sword is that?
- Mine.

167
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:44,181
Give it to me.

168
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:53,732
l know this maker's mark.
This is Mikken's work.

169
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,694
Where did you get this?

170
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,867
This is no toy.

171
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:08,705
- Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
- l wasn't playing.

172
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,749
And l don't want to be a lady.

173
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,085
Come here.

174
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,634
Now what do you want with this?

175
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,095
lt's called Needle.

176
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,264
Oh, a blade with a name.

177
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,934
And who were you hoping
to skewer with Needle?

178
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:31,019
Your sister?

179
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:33,397
Do you know the first thing
about sword fighting?

180
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,274
Stick 'em with the pointy end.

181
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,193
[Laughs] That's the essence of it.

182
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,198

183
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,703
l asked Mycah to practice with me.

184
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,292
l asked him. It was my fault.

185
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:58,589
No, sweet girl.
No, no, you didn't kill the butcher's boy.

186
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:03,135
l hate them. l hate all of them.

187
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,512
The Hound, the queen and the king

188
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:07,181
and Joffrey and Sansa.

189
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:09,933
Sansa was dragged
before the king and queen...

190
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:13,562
and asked to call the prince a liar.

191
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:16,190
So was l! He is a liar.

192
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:18,317
Shh, darling, listen to me.

193
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,446
Sansa will be married
to Joffrey someday.

194
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:25,199
She cannot betray him.

195
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:27,951
She must take his side
even when he's wrong.

196
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:31,914
But how you can let her
marry someone like that?

197
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,709
Well...

198
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,838
Look at me.

199
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:43,091
You're a Stark of Winterfell.
You know our words.

200
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:46,720
Winter is coming.

201
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,892
You were born in the long summer.
You've never known anything else.

202
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,353
But now winter is truly coming.

203
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:58,440
And in the winter
we must protect ourselves,

204
00:14:58,524 --> 00:14:59,900

205
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:02,319
Sansa is your sister.

206
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:05,781
l don't hate her.

207
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,824
Not really.

208
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:12,996
l don't want to frighten you,
but l won't lie to you either.

209
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,541
We've come to a dangerous place.

210
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,002
We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves.

211
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,005
All right?

212
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,342
Go on. It's yours.

213
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,514
l can keep it?

214
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:33,559
Try not to stab your sister with it.

215
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:35,269
[Chuckles]

216
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:46,446
lf you're going to own a sword,
you'd better know how to use it.

217
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,991
[Door opens, closes]

218
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,660
[Cawing]

219
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:57,958
Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars.

220
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:04,089
- l know a story about a crow.
- l hate your stories.

221
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:07,301
l know a story about a boy who hated stories.

222
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:11,013
l could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall.

223
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,015
Those were always your favourites.

224
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,392
Those weren't my favourites.

225
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:18,020
My favourites were the scary ones.

226
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:23,609
Oh, my sweet summer child.
What do you know about fear?

227
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,945
I
Fear is for the winter

228
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:30,282
when the snows fall a hundred feet deep.

229
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:34,828
Fear is for the long night,
when the sun hides for years

230
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:39,917
and children are born and live and die,
all in darkness.

231
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,670
That is the time for fear, my little lord,

232
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:46,965
when the white walkers
move through the woods.

233
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:53,680
Thousands of years ago there came a night
that lasted a generation.

234
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:56,642
Kings froze to death in their castles,

235
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,894
same as the shepherds in their huts.

236
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:03,732
And women smothered their babies
rather than see them starve,

237
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:08,153
and wept and felt the tears
freeze on their cheeks.

238
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,782
So is this the sort of story that you like?

239
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:19,540
ln that darkness, the white walkers
came for the first time.

240
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,668
They swept through cities and kingdoms,

241
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,878
riding their dead horses,

242
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:28,799
hunting with their packs of pale spiders
big as hounds...

243
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:31,093
[Door rattles]

What are you telling him now?

245
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,599
Only what the little lord wants to hear.

246
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:40,310
Get your supper. l want some time with him.

247
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,240
- [Door closes]
- One time she told me

248
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:55,534
the sky is blue
because we live inside the eye

249
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:58,412
of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber.

250
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,581
Maybe we do.

00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,127
How do you feel?

252
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,841
You still don't remember anything?

a thousand times.

A thousand times.

- You never fall.
- l did though.

257
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,692
lt's true, isn't it,

258
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:32,070
what Maester Luwin says about my legs?

259
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,496
l'd rather be dead.

260
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:46,043
- Don't ever say that.
- l'd rather be dead.

261
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:00,265
Fewer eyes back here, my lady.

262
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:02,476
But still too many.

263
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:05,145
lt's nine years since l've set foot
in the capital.

264
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:08,482
And no one knew who l was
the last time l came, either.

265
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,571
My lady.

266
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:17,824
Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark.
Would you mind following us?

267
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,743
l would. We've done nothing wrong.

268
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,037
We've been instructed
to escort you into the city.

l don't know who's providing
your instructions, but...

271
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,377
Follow me, Lady Stark.

to you of all people.

How dare you bring me here?
Have you lost your mind?

279
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,793
No one will come looking for you here.
Isn't that what you wanted?

280
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:13,422
l'm truly sorry...about the locale.

How did you know l was
coming to King's Landing?

282
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,844
A dear friend told me.

- Lady Stark.
- Lord Varys.

284
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:27,519
To see you again after so many years
is a blessing.

Your poor hands.

How did you know l was coming?

287

Knowledge is my trade, my lady.

288
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,865
Did you bring the dagger with you,
by any chance?

289

Something you don't know that l do.

There's only one dagger like this
in all of the Seven Kingdoms.

- It's mine.
- Yours?

on Prince Joffrey's last nameday.

Well, Lord Snow, it appears
you're the least useless person here.

319
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:47,367
Go clean yourselves up!

320
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:50,245
There's only so much
l can stomach in a day.

321

of thieves and runaways

into men of the Night's Watch.

325
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:03,509
And how's that going,
Commander Mormont?

326
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:05,135
Slowly.

327
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:10,682
A raven came...for Ned Stark's son.

328
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,064
Good news or bad?

So forgetful these days.

333
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:35,207
A raven from Winterfell this morning.

334
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:48,136
Good news?

335
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:54,101
Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife.

336
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,231
- My wife is in Winterfell.
- Is she?

One of several such

You're a funny man.

Ah, the Starks...

Quick tempers, slow minds.

You broke my nose, bastard!

347

lt's an improvement.

348

lf we threw you over the Wall,
l wonder how long it would take you to hit.

349
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:04,671

Yes. You've got an interesting face.

Hmm, very distinctive faces.

All of you.

And what do you care about our faces?

lt's just...

l think they would look marvellous
decorating spikes in King's Landing.

359
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:36,537
Perhaps l'll write to my sister,
the queen, about it.

360
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:41,124
We'll talk later, Lord Snow.

361
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:51,385
Everybody knew what this place was
and no one told me.

No one but you.

363
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,516
My father knew and he left me to rot
at the Wall all the same.

364
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,726
Grenn's father left him too...

365

outside a farmhouse, when he was three.

366
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:07,067
Pyp was caught stealing
a wheel of cheese.

367
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:10,445
His little sister hadn't eaten in three days.

368

He was given a choice -
his right hand or the Wall.

about them. Fascinating stories.

They hate me because
l'm better than they are.

371

lt's a lucky thing none of them were trained
by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik.

The mere suggestion that the queen's brother
tried to kill your boy

378
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:45,772
would be considered treason.

00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:27,674
So come on.

477
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:29,760
We're telling war stories.

478
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:34,640
Who was your first kill,
not counting old men?

479
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:38,519
One of the outlaws
in the brotherhood.

480
00:33:38,644 --> 00:33:41,146
l was there that day.

481
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:44,358
You were only a squire, 16 years old.

482
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:47,319
You killed Simon Toyne
with a counter riposte.

483
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:49,530
Best move l ever saw.

484
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:53,909
A good fighter, Toyne,
but he lacked stamina.

485
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:56,161
Your outlaw...

486
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:58,705
any last words?

487
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:01,542
- l cut his head off, so no.
- Hmm.

488
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:04,545
What about Aerys Targaryen?

489
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:08,465
What did the Mad King say
when you stabbed him in the back?

490
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:10,676
l never asked.

491
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:13,637
Did he call you a traitor?

492
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:16,765
Did he plead for a reprieve?

493
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,311
He said the same thing
he'd been saying for hours...

494
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,148
''Burn them all.''

495
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:31,864
lf that's all, Your Grace...

496
00:35:04,229 --> 00:35:06,648
Do the Dothraki buy their slaves?

497
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:08,775
The Dothraki don't believe in money.

498
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:11,111
Most of their slaves were
given to them as gifts.

499
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:12,654
From whom?

500
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:16,325
lf you rule a city and you see the horde
approaching, you have two choices -

501
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,243
pay tribute or fight.

502
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:20,078
An easy choice for most.

503
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,582
Of course, sometimes it's not enough.

504
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:27,085
Sometimes a khal feels insulted
by the number of slaves he's given.

505
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:29,630
He might think the men too weak
or the women too ugly.

506
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:33,509
Sometimes a khal decides
his riders haven't had a good fight in months

507
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:36,595
- and need the practice.

between us and the wildlings
