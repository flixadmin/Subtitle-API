1
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:07,674
Uh...

2
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,014
Uh, you need some
help with that, Mick?

3
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:15,350
Maybe you should just,
you know, take it easy.

4
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,268
I'm pregnant, not paralyzed.

5
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:20,397
Yeah. Okay. Well, do your thing.

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,149
Are you sure
this is the right spot?

7
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:28,655
- I'm just following the beeps.
- Then why are we going in circles?

8
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:30,657
Maybe the tracker's busted.

9
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:35,161
Moment of truth.

10
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:40,542
And that is not right.

11
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:45,171
Oh, what's up, squire? What's wrong?
Why you crying?

12
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:48,174
- They're soggy in the middle.
- Maybe I can help.

13
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:52,720
Fiery flames. Burning blazes.
Infernal conflagrations.

14
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:56,014
Dude.

15
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:59,143
Sorry about that, Behrad. Guess I just
don't know my own strength lately.

16
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:00,436
Let me make it up to you.

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,899
Cannabis edible, euphoria incredible,
brain matter bendable!

18
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:07,402
No. Please don't fire a spell
at my brain.

19
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:09,111
Poof!

20
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:12,824
Yeah, good point.

21
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:18,413
You're feeling mighty magical
this morning. Almost overcharged.

22
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:21,165
I feel astounding.

23
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:24,168
Where's Zari?
I want to share this with her.

24
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:25,336
Sorry, my friend.

25
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,674
My sis swapped places with Flannel Zari
who's currently on a date with Nate.

26
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,926
And you just missed the pod squad too.

27
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,013
So, Nate is with the Zari
that lives in a Totem.

28
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:38,099
That seems very problematic.
Where's he taking her?

29
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:39,851
Watch the Beatles perform live?

30
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:43,146
Maybe the fabled pleasure domes
of Kublai Khan.

31
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:48,318
Great outdoors.
Nothing beats Mother Nature.

32
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:50,695
Yeah, I feel like we've seen
all the nature.

33
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:51,779
Yeah.

34
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:55,116
In all seriousness,
I am very glad to be here with you.

35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,743
We're almost there.

36
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:58,703
Look, I know you only have 24 hours

37
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,663
before you have to go back
into the Totem.

38
00:02:00,747 --> 00:02:02,790
Right. 24 hours.

39
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:04,917
So I just want to spend
some time together,

40
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:07,003
you know, with no distractions.

41
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:10,173
- Yes, I would like that too.
- Hello, neighbors.

42
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:16,596
Looks like campsite's double-booked.
That's okay. We love company.

43
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:20,058
- I'm Jeff. This is Jamie.
- Rock 'n' roll.

44
00:02:24,437 --> 00:02:25,437
Yeah.

45
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:30,568
Yeah. We kinda got it all,
as you can see.

46
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:32,862
Who wants dogs?

47
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:33,946
Oh, uh...

48
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,328
You know what, Jeff?
We're gonna go off on our own. Thanks.

49
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:46,709
A-ha!

50
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:50,463
Oh!

51
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:58,596
Last pod in the timeline
and it's a total dud.

52
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,557
Wait. There's something inside.

53
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:09,524
- Nothing's happening.
- Here. Could be dangerous.

54
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:14,487
Ah, it's one of those,
uh, puzzle things.

55
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,280
You gotta solve it to open it.

56
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:18,116
- Hey, I'm not done yet.
- Give me that.

57
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,867
No, I can do it.

58
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:23,204
Hey, babe, I think, uh, we're,
gonna be a while.

59
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:26,124
Take all the time, babe.
There's seriously no rush.

60
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,219
- Oh! No.
- What?

61
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:41,013
It's bad luck to see you in
your wedding dress before the big day.

62
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:43,015
It's not bad luck.
I'm not marrying you, Gary.

63
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,767
And besides, this isn't the one.

64
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:46,491
It makes me feel,
I don't know, not right.

65
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:50,565
Stop whatever you are doing.
No, no, no. Okay?

66
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,068
- I have a job for you. Yeah?
- Anything.

67
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,406
You're gonna help me
find the perfect wedding dress.

68
00:03:58,489 --> 00:03:59,489
Oh!

69
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:01,951
- Give it to me.
- Give this...

70
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,244
- Let go.
- I got it.

71
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:04,888
Guys, can we please just
get it together?

72
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,372
Give me the damn...

73
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:18,050
Where the hell are we?

74
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,557
One minute we're in a gross junkyard,

75
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,267
the next we're in a gross bowling alley.

76
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,730
- Spooner, are you getting something?
- This place... Major alien vibes.

77
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:34,859
- I don't see any aliens.
- I got a bad feeling about this.

78
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:38,529
The sooner we get out of here,
the better.

79
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:54,295
Whoa. Where is everything?

80
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,846
I have a feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore.

81
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:30,331
- So we've been abducted by aliens.
- Again.

82
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,252
Ava? B? Can you guys hear us?

83
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,547
Courier isn't working either.
Wherever we are, we're stuck.

84
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,925
Okay, well, if these guys are aliens,
maybe we can bum a ride home.

85
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:43,594
Yeah, sure. Go for it.

86
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,849
I'm gonna see if this guy
knows anything.

87
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:49,474
Thanks for catching me.

88
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:52,937
But I think I'd rather you let me die
than spend another minute here.

89
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:55,398
I'm taking a leak.

90
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,530
Hi, um, sir...

91
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:05,366
The name's Buddy. What's your shoe size?

92
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,076
I'm not here to bowl, but I was hoping

93
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,799
you could tell me
how the hell I got here.

94
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,914
I would wager you opened an invitation.

95
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:16,669
- No, I didn't get an invitation.
- Shiny. Irresistible.

96
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,589
Drags your ass
across the universe instantly.

97
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:24,427
Okay, yeah, maybe I did.
Damn it. The Puzzle Box.

98
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:26,929
How do we get back to Earth?

99
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:33,561
Earth? But you just got here.

100
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:38,149
And I'm so happy you did.
Because I bet you're incredible bowlers.

101
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:40,191
Why's that?

102
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,321
Bowling was invented
by Earthlings after all.

103
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:46,741
Everyone else here just looks human.

104
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:51,329
- Why don't I show you around? Come on.
- Okay.

105
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:55,541
Coming down to the wire, folks.

106
00:06:57,335 --> 00:06:58,878
Sorry to bother you,

107
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:03,799
but my friends and I are stranded and
we're looking for a ride back to Earth.

108
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:08,095
Earth, huh?
Yeah, sure, we'll give you a ride.

109
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:10,640
But you and your friends
have got to beat us in a game first.

110
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:14,685
- We're kind of on a tight schedule.
- Oh, come on. What's one game?

111
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,646
Unless, of course,
you're afraid of losing.

112
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,608
I can roll with anyone.

113
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,319
Then how about
we spice things up a little

114
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:25,488
and play a game of Cosmic Bowling?

115
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:28,449
Is that with the neon balls
and the black lights?

116
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:29,909
Yeah, that ain't really my thing.

117
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:32,745
All I'm saying is if you want
to get a ride out of here,

118
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,664
you got to roll against us.

119
00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:36,707
All right then. Game on.

120
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,251
I was hoping you'd say that.

121
00:07:42,755 --> 00:07:46,384
Cute trick. But it's what you do
on the lanes that counts.

122
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:50,179
Once we're through putting
these red shirts out of their misery,

123
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,389
you're next.

124
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,857
The guidebook said we should be able
to see the Northern Lights,

125
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:04,694
but... I can't see a single star.

126
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,613
Huh! Maybe it's too cloudy.

127
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,993
Listen, I know this is super on brand,
but I'm feeling kind of hungry.

128
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:14,245
Hungry, you say? Hmm.

129
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:19,041
Well, I happen to have
made your favorite

130
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,210
Persian delicacy, abgoosht.

131
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,587
- What?
- Yep.

132
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:27,800
And for dessert, the very exotic donuts.

133
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,135
It's very sweet.

134
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:32,888
No.

135
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:37,351
- This must be Spooner's bag.
- Oh, that makes sense.

136
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:43,733
- The only food in here are MRE rations.
- Maybe they're super delicious.

137
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:47,945
Want to try it?

138
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,322
Rock and roll!

139
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:55,244
- Is that what I think it is?
- Yep.

140
00:08:57,455 --> 00:08:58,748
Rock and roll!

141
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:03,294
What's the point of unplugging
if all your camping gear has a cord?

142
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,005
Meanwhile, we're out here
trying to squeeze in one date

143
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:07,757
before I turn into a Totem pumpkin,

144
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,801
and they're over there
with all the carefree time in the world.

145
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:14,555
- I'm jealous of those two idiots.
- Me too. It's insane.

146
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,141
That's it. That's it.
We're getting another campsite.

147
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,269
- Yeah, that's good.
- Gideon? Gideon.

148
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,732
Oh.

149
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:28,360
- My Time Courier's going nuts.
- Yeah.

150
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:30,446
Something's wrong. Something's wrong.

151
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:35,034
It's funny.
It even smells like a bowling alley.

152
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:38,537
Yep. I included everything you'd find
in a bowling center on Earth.

153
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:42,041
That's how much I love bowling,
the greatest sport in the universe.

154
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,959
I'm sorry. You created this place?

155
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,129
Does that mean you were the one
who sent out the invitations?

156
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:50,508
I had nothing to do
with those cursed invitations.

157
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:54,845
That's the work of the Pin Killers.
The guys in the purple shirts.

158
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:58,891
They came here and ruined
my little bowling paradise.

159
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:01,894
I need you to beat them.

160
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:03,687
They're the top dogs now,

161
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:06,649
and you only get one game
to try to knock them off.

162
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,527
So don't challenge them
until your team is ready.

163
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,488
Guess what. I found us a ride home.

164
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:15,699
All we got to do is just beat those
aliens in those ugly purple shirts.

165
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:17,575
We got next.

166
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:24,834
Hey, will you hand me that?

167
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:28,254
Mmm. Just need to adjust the frequency.

168
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:31,215
<i>The sun is missing.
It's night everywhere on Earth.</i>

169
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:35,052
<i>Massive unexplained chasms appeared
in Mexico, Canada and Alaska.</i>

170
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:37,805
- We're in Alaska.
<i>- Who did this? Aliens? Demons?</i>

171
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:41,142
<i>Did God give up on us?
Either way, it's the end of the world.</i>

172
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:43,185
<i>We're all gonna die.
We're all gonna die.</i>

173
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:45,187
<i>We're all gonna die.</i>

174
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:46,605
<i>Alaska, Canada.</i>

175
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:48,440
<i>- They're gone. They're just gone.</i>
- Nate...

176
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:50,526
I think the world is ending.

177
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,236
We need to get out of here.

178
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,989
This is one of the top five worst dates
I've ever been on.

179
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:58,117
<i>We're all gonna die. We're gonna die.
We're all gonna die.</i>

180
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:05,374
Jamie and I can go anywhere in the world

181
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:09,670
and I can still blaze us
a Neapolitan pizza at 800 degrees.

182
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:13,174
- Supes quick. Ha-ha!
- That's so fantastic, Jeff.

183
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:16,594
Yeah, the char on this
is something else.

184
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:19,138
- Hmm... Hmm.
- Hmm?

185
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,892
Say, Jeff... Sorry. Bro.

186
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:25,144
Can I borrow your truck supes quick

187
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,104
so we can go into town
and pick up some stuff?

188
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:28,480
Uh...

189
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,277
- Sure. What are neighbors for?
- There's a bro.

190
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,989
Hey, why don't we all go?

191
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,574
- No.
- Rock and roll.

192
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,534
- No, no, no.
- Yeah.

193
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:42,870
Nate, you're riding shotgun.
Boys in the front.

194
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,330
Oh, my God.

195
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,387
Battery's dead.

196
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:03,515
I don't know, Jeff.
Maybe all your devices drained it.

197
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,184
Well, good luck, guys.

198
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:10,814
Where are you going?

199
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:13,901
- We're heading into town.
- Great. We'll come with.

200
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,821
Maybe we can find some folks
to jump the truck battery.

201
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:19,782
Rock and roll.

202
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,577
Looks like we're hiking.

203
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:30,251
All right. Enough of this
ding dong dallying waiting around.

204
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:33,587
I say we get out there
and we find Sara and her gang.

205
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:36,257
I'm sure they could use
a magical assist.

206
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,926
Come to think of it,
we haven't heard from them in a while.

207
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:44,473
Gideon, let's go visit Sara.
Kansas City, 2021.

208
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,309
Calculating, calculating.

209
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,812
That is impossible at this time.

210
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:52,189
Come on. You're Gideon.
Everything's possible.

211
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:54,650
I'm sorry.
I'm having trouble locking onto Earth.

212
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,360
Never seen that before.

213
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:59,113
I came looking
for my summer wedding inspo binder,

214
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:01,699
but did Gideon just say
we can't get back to Earth?

215
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,617
- Yeah.
- This is bad.

216
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:06,996
Ava cannot be marooned
in the Temporal Zone away from Sara.

217
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,790
- This could be triggering.
- Calm down. Just breathe.

218
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,751
Keep Ava occupied.
We'll figure something out. Right, John?

219
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,421
Oh! Most assuredly.

220
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,927
All right, team. We are stranded
on the edge of the universe

221
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:24,513
and the only way out is
to beat the Pin Killers.

222
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,223
- Question.
- Yes.

223
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:31,312
- I don't bowl.
- I don't either, but how hard can it be?

224
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:36,150
Pretty sure you just pick it on up
and then we just roll it on down.

225
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:39,820
Nice, Sara.

226
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:41,738
Well...

227
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,992
What can I say? Guess I'm a natural.
Mick, let's see what you got.

228
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:48,120
All right.

229
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:51,332
Right. It's gonna be good.
It's gonna be great.

230
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:56,337
Go. Just... Right on.
Whatever feels natural.

231
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:59,798
Nice and smooth. Okay.

232
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,640
Wrong lane, but, hey,
you got some pins, right?

233
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:10,851
If you lose the gloves,
you'll drop more pins.

234
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:16,398
- Watch and learn.
- Here you go. Oh. Okay.

235
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,651
Ah, we got a standard house oil pattern.

236
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:22,112
A bit chilly,
so the lanes will be slick.

237
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:25,366
We got a dip in the 16th board.

238
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:44,635
- Yeah.
- What the hell was that?

239
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:48,389
I learned the art of bowling when
I was 13. Kept me out of trouble.

240
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,266
The footwork concentrates my mojo.

241
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,353
You keep that mojo concentrated.
Nice moves.

242
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,730
All right, Astra. Lace them up.
Let's go.

243
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:59,400
I am not putting my feet
in those fungus-filled shoes

244
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:02,027
or my fingers
in those fungus-filled holes.

245
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:06,115
All right. Then you can cheer us on
from that fungus-filled chair.

246
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:08,951
- You're just gonna let her skip?
- Whatever she wants.

247
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,500
I'm getting a good feeling
about this one.

248
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,293
It is amazing.

249
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,089
This is the one. I'm sure of it.

250
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,591
Okay. Well,
I can't show Sara, obviously,

251
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:26,343
but I can tell her that it's done.
Gideon.

252
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:27,428
Actually...

253
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:31,765
Uh... You're fine with the shoulders?

254
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:35,144
Um... The shoulders?
Yeah. What's wrong with them?

255
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:38,355
Nothing at all. It's your wedding.
As long as you're fine with it.

256
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:39,898
Gary, spit it out.

257
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:46,363
They're a little plain.
They lack pizzazz.

258
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:47,990
- Pizzazz?
- Mmm-hmm.

259
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:51,618
Oh, yeah. Now that I look at them,
they do seem really boring.

260
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:53,829
Well, I mean, they're not that bad.

261
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:58,250
Gary, what am I gonna do?
I can't get married in plain shoulders.

262
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,543
Gideon?

263
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,630
We're gonna need some alterations.

264
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,843
So you're saying we're stuck?

265
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:10,762
Every time I plot
an exit vector, it fails to reach Earth.

266
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:15,476
My safety protocols do not allow us
to attempt a doomed jump. So, yes.

267
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,484
Right. Like John Henry, I will prevail
where the machine could not.

268
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:27,362
- How?
- I will compel the ship to Earth.

269
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:30,282
Whoa! Sounds big, even for you.

270
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:34,119
Well, I am feeling invigorated, squire.

271
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:37,164
I need you to bring me
the four elemental aspects of our world.

272
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,833
Earth, Fire, Air and Water. All right?

273
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,627
Got it. Hey.

274
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,504
Maybe your powers are growing stronger

275
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,756
since you drank
from the Fountain of Imperium.

276
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:51,845
Oh, yeah, the Fountain.
That's right. Good.

277
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:54,389
Well, uh, hop to it, Skippy.

278
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,362
Final frame.

279
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,127
Red Shirts, game over.

280
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:27,798
- Oh! Another one bites the dust.
- Pin Killers can't be stopped.

281
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,302
And now you're mine.

282
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:38,267
- You don't have to do this, Mike.
- You won. Isn't that enough?

283
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,978
Well, here's the thing.
I do it for the trophies.

284
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,605
- You're a bastard, Mike.
- Yeah, well...

285
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:11,174
They have a lot of balls.

286
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,802
That whole team
just vaporized into thin air.

287
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:18,181
Yeah. And I'm guessing that's what's
gonna happen to us if we lose too.

288
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:19,850
I hope you're warmed up.

289
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,686
Because Mike the Strike
says it's game time.

290
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,947
I can't tell you how many trucks
I've had to abandon,

291
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:36,325
and in some of the most scenic places
on Earth.

292
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:39,995
- So you and Jeff are big campers, huh?
- Rock and roll.

293
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,164
Right. Of course. Rock and roll.

294
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:44,887
I get the vibe that you and Nate
are doing the long-distance thing.

295
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:51,673
Uh, I didn't know we gave off that vibe,
but, yeah, we are.

296
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:56,553
- And you two can handle the distance?
- Yeah, Jamie, we can handle distance.

297
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:58,930
Well, if you can stand to be apart,

298
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:01,767
doesn't that just kind of prove
you don't need to be together?

299
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:06,647
- What? No.
- I'm sorry if I touched a nerve.

300
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,815
It's just that's
what all the magazines say.

301
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:12,486
You didn't touch a nerve.
It's fine. I'm fine.

302
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,780
Nate and I are fine.
Our relationship is fine.

303
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:18,325
Our vibe is very fine.
Everything is fine. Yeah.

304
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,786
- Everything all right back there?
- Fine.

305
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:22,954
Rock and roll.

306
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:31,129
All right, everyone. We've got
ourselves a game of Cosmic Bowling.

307
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:34,132
The Pin Killers versus the Legends.

308
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:39,137
Ten frames. Ten pins.
And 60 feet of wood.

309
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:40,847
May your rolls be true.

310
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:47,396
- All right, Buddy.
- You've got this, Murph.

311
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:00,200
- That's my Murph. Murph the Curve.
- All right, baby.

312
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,331
Yeah.

313
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:17,217
Clare the Spare
always picks up the spare. Always.

314
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,011
Lose the gloves, Mick.
Have respect for the game.

315
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,095
Quiet.

316
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:29,730
Yes, yes.

317
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:33,942
That's it, that's it. Just keep doing
your thing. You're doing your thing.

318
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:42,492
- What did I tell you, Mick?
- Shut up.

319
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:48,248
If we don't get those two to play nice,
we may never get out of here.

320
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:55,756
I think you've almost nailed it.
I'm thinking lace.

321
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,473
- Perfect.
- Yeah?

322
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:09,352
Yes, the lace. It brings out
your skin tone. Bigger with the veil.

323
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:13,314
Um...

324
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,232
Aw!

325
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:16,443
- Okay, so we're good.
- Nope.

326
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:19,529
- What?
- You need something floral.

327
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:31,833
- We're done.
- I love it. What about a bustle?

328
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,807
All right. I got them all.

329
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,352
Oh, excellent.
We make a good team, Smokey.

330
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:54,397
John, when you started dating my sister,
I was worried you'd be a bad influence.

331
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:58,151
I mean, most people you date
end up dead or worse.

332
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:01,446
But I can see how much
you've changed, for the better.

333
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,366
You're a good man, John Constantine.

334
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:10,121
Well, I am glad to hear it, mate.
Now, shall we begin?

335
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:19,673
Earth.

336
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:25,678
Water.

337
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,644
Fire.

338
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,149
Air.

339
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,121
You okay?

340
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,638
It's gorgeous. Very on-trend.

341
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:13,602
What the hell was that?

342
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,689
- Gary?
- It's nothing to worry about.

343
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:21,318
- I'm sure you'll see Sara again.
- What? What happened to her?

344
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:24,154
It's more what happened to us.

345
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:28,909
What the hell is going on?

346
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:32,913
Well, we were stuck in the Temporal Zone
because Gideon couldn't find Earth.

347
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:37,876
And now, well, we're not in the Temporal
Zone at least. Trippy dress, Ava.

348
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,353
That's not what I was going for, Behrad.

349
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:41,755
Why did no one tell me
we were stuck? Gary?

350
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:45,175
I was trying to distract you
so you wouldn't be upset.

351
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:46,444
Okay, so where the hell are we?

352
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:50,263
I cast a spell to bring us to Earth.
It's here somewhere.

353
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:54,017
Wait, wait, wait.
There is something out there.

354
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:03,944
We're at a floating
bowling alley in space.

355
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:08,990
Thank you, everyone here, for making
my day about a floating bowling alley.

356
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:11,493
You dumdums stay here.

357
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,293
Hi. Hello? Hi.

358
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:24,881
- Ava?
- Sara, you're here.

359
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:26,424
What's with the bowling shirt?

360
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:29,195
I'll tell you about the bowling shirt
if you tell me about this wedding dress.

361
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:31,346
Wedding...

362
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:33,556
Oh, my God.
I forgot that I was wearing it.

363
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,725
I was so mad at Gary
because he didn't tell me...

364
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:38,311
- Babe, you look gorgeous.
- Really?

365
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:41,690
- Yes.
- Why won't these fricking doors open?

366
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:44,943
Could we get a little help here, please?

367
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:47,404
League champs took control
of those doors.

368
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:49,823
No one enters without an invitation.

369
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:52,867
What is that sweet man talking about?

370
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:55,203
Uh, when we tracked down that last pod,

371
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:57,747
we found this device
and it zapped us here.

372
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:59,892
And now the only way for us
to leave is for us to beat

373
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:03,712
this team of alien bowlers
who are surprisingly good.

374
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:04,879
How did you find us?

375
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:06,172
Gideon couldn't find Earth,

376
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:08,800
so Constantine cast a spell
to bring the <i>Waverider</i> to Earth

377
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,301
and it brought us here.

378
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,972
What? So you're saying that Earth
is in this bowling alley?

379
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:16,057
I guess.
Who would be a cruel enough jerk

380
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:18,143
to hide the Earth in this bowling alley?

381
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:22,772
Oh! You've got to be kidding me.

382
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:39,831
Hey, look at that.

383
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:46,087
Light. See that, Zari? Daylight.
Maybe everything will be fine.

384
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:52,093
Yeah. Maybe everything will be fine.
Or maybe we're doomed.

385
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:53,886
Wait. What?

386
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:07,400
What the hell is that?

387
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:19,537
Earthquake.

388
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:36,096
- Everyone okay?
- What the hell is going on?

389
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:38,973
What was that thing?

390
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:41,434
What?

391
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,400
Whoa!

392
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,530
Whoa!

393
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:59,244
Where is everything?

394
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:30,567
- Hey?
- It's the end of the world.

395
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:35,780
Jamie, I can't die without
you knowing the truth.

396
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,785
I got a secret vasectomy,
and that's why you never get pregnant.

397
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,454
No!

398
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:46,666
- Are you frigging kidding me?
- Baby.

399
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:50,920
Not rock and roll, Jeff.
Not rock and roll at all.

400
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:54,632
If we have kids, we won't be
able to afford our stuff, right?

401
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,009
Wait. Wait. Where are you going?

402
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:59,971
Into town.
To find someone whose truck works.

403
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:04,224
Wait.

404
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:08,104
That's rough.

405
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:13,818
Hey, am I a bad person
if I found that very enjoyable?

406
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:16,446
- No, no, no. They're terrible people.
- Okay, good.

407
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:23,036
Totally off topic, but does that cloud
look like Mick to you?

408
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:30,376
You know, from here, you can tell
how fragile and beautiful it really is.

409
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,628
Coming through.

410
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:37,300
Hey, take it easy!

411
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:42,263
So you're literally bowling
with planet Earth?

412
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:43,932
That's why it's called Cosmic Bowling.

413
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:47,393
You go <i>mano-a-mano</i>
for the survival of your species

414
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:51,231
and if you lose, you and your
entire home planet get banished

415
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:53,608
to our trophy shelf for eternity.

416
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:56,903
Wow! That's godlike power.

417
00:28:58,571 --> 00:28:59,948
I'm not a god.

418
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:03,826
I'm just an average Joe who loves
to bowl, and destroy countless worlds.

419
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:05,703
Yes, Mike.

420
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:09,749
Buddy, if this is your place, why don't
you just kick them out of here?

421
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:13,419
Can't. Rules say they can stay
as long as they're champs.

422
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:15,713
Now they've taken root and taken over.

423
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:18,174
It's your fault we're playing
this dumb game.

424
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:20,301
Place is full of bad energy now.

425
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:22,929
At least I was being proactive
and trying to get us out of here.

426
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,138
Be less proactive.

427
00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:27,433
They made the game so
competitive, no one wants to play here.

428
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:32,188
- This team is falling apart.
- Hey, yo. Come on, Legends.

429
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:35,775
What are you waiting for? You got
a game to lose. Let's get going.

430
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:39,487
They turned my bowling alley
into a bullying alley.

431
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:42,407
Game on.

432
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:49,455
Damn it.

433
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:53,960
- You're not listening to anything I say.
- I am listening.

434
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:56,296
I'm just choosing to ignore you.

435
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:59,841
Bowling's stupid.

436
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:02,593
Bowling is not stupid, you ignorant lug.

437
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:06,014
You can't control the ball
if your fingers aren't in the hole. See?

438
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:12,478
You son of a...
Oh, my God. I think I jammed it.

439
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:14,063
- Son of a...
- That's gotta hurt.

440
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:15,565
Time-out. We're at time-out.

441
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:17,358
- Let's take a walk. Come on.
- Pathetic.

442
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:19,610
I'll get you some ice
and we'll do something.

443
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:22,655
Okay, let's get ice.
We'll get some ice. All right.

444
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:28,661
- Why did we come back here?
- We need a plan.

445
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:30,913
Okay. Plan. I'll Steel up.

446
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:32,999
You use your wind power.
Shoot me like a bullet...

447
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:36,377
- No. We need a plan for us.
- Us, us?

448
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:38,463
Yeah. You know, I was thinking about it

449
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:41,299
and I just want to give us a chance
to end things amicably.

450
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:47,805
What? The world is ending and you
want to have a relationship talk now?

451
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:51,351
Just trying to be mature and...
And... And pragmatic.

452
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:54,562
Look, Zari, I know we're gonna have
to spend time apart,

453
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:56,856
like, a lot, so the timeline
doesn't collapse,

454
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:59,233
but the time
we do spend together will be worth it.

455
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:01,027
I don't know. Will it?

456
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,362
Get your strike.

457
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:06,199
See, I feel like
we're on this doomed path

458
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:08,743
and just blindly
walking towards a cliff.

459
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:15,249
All right, look. Obviously, I can see
dating a woman from another timeline

460
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:18,044
that's stuck in another dimension
might end bad.

461
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:20,713
Does that mean we shouldn't do it?

462
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:27,678
No. Because the alternative
is way worse.

463
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:36,145
Zari, I cannot stand being away
from you. It actually hurts my heart.

464
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:44,278
That is... what I needed to hear.

465
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:48,616
Mm. Mm-mm...

466
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:51,411
But, um, listen. If we're gonna
save this relationship,

467
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:54,956
we need to go save the world first.

468
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,958
Yeah, okay.

469
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:04,297
Rock and roll.

470
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:09,137
I just...
I need to clear my head.

471
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:17,437
Why the long face?

472
00:32:18,396 --> 00:32:22,108
Well, Buddy, team's falling apart

473
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:25,778
and every human being alive
is about to be annihilated.

474
00:32:25,862 --> 00:32:27,029
Shame.

475
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:29,615
The way I see it,

476
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:35,621
bowling is all about bending your elbows
with friends and wetting your beaks.

477
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:38,124
Best bowling happens
when you're not thinking at all.

478
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,086
Can't beat bad energy with bad energy.

479
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:49,844
You're right.
I've been going about this all wrong.

480
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:53,598
Buddy, can you do me a favor?

481
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:06,110
Nachos and fries.
Breakfast of champions.

482
00:33:06,194 --> 00:33:08,571
And a Cherry Coke for the lady.

483
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,114
Thank you, Buddy.

484
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:12,742
Whoa! The game isn't done yet.

485
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:15,203
The scoreboard looming over our head
is stressing us out.

486
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:19,332
Besides, it doesn't matter if we
win or lose if we're not a team first.

487
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:22,960
You do realize that the Earth gets
destroyed if we lose, right?

488
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:26,380
Well, okay, yes,
the outcome does matter,

489
00:33:26,464 --> 00:33:31,052
but we're not gonna win
by tearing each other apart.

490
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:34,096
I mean, guys, we're not even losing
to the Pin Killers right now.

491
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,182
We're losing to ourselves.

492
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:39,894
And what we do from this moment on
decides the fate of our planet.

493
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:42,188
So I'm asking you,

494
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:47,735
are we losers or are we Legends?

495
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,988
Huh? Do I have a Legend?
Do I have a Legend?

496
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:54,492
There we go. That's that team spirit.

497
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:55,575
Cheers.

498
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:00,956
Here.

499
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,710
- There.
- Thanks.

500
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:07,713
I suppose that's one good reason
to keep your gloves on.

501
00:34:09,382 --> 00:34:15,388
There's others.
My past is not for everyone to see.

502
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,853
So, Astra, we're gonna need you to roll.

503
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:26,440
I've never bowled before. Not even once.

504
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:32,238
Come on. Don't you want to de-ball
that <i>Jersey Shore</i> wannabe?

505
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,364
Hmm?

506
00:34:37,368 --> 00:34:38,661
Welcome to the team.

507
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:46,168
Hey, I might know how you can bowl
and not have to take your gloves off.

508
00:34:48,546 --> 00:34:50,798
Rory. Rory. Rory.

509
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:54,802
Ah, here he goes.

510
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,605
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Come on, Astra.

511
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:07,523
- Come on, Astra.
- Come on.

512
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:10,067
Slide that in.

513
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:14,113
That's all right. That's okay.

514
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:15,531
Told you this was a bad idea.

515
00:35:15,615 --> 00:35:17,700
That's a great warmup. This is the one.

516
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:19,160
Breathe. Breathe.

517
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:28,461
- We'll take it. Whoo!
- Let's take it. Yes, Astra.

518
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:38,179
No spare there, Clare.

519
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:40,181
<i>Ah, our bowling party...</i>

520
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:42,600
<i>...is definitely putting a cramp
in their style.</i>

521
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:45,770
- Gary, what are their chances?
- At this point?

522
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:47,313
We're gonna need a miracle.

523
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:51,317
We still don't really know
what's coming from the sky.

524
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:55,154
- A middle finger.
- What?

525
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:58,240
There's a dial here set to three,
but it goes all the way up to...

526
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:00,534
Well, Spooner just drew
a middle finger.

527
00:36:00,618 --> 00:36:04,413
- Right. Okay, let's go for that.
- Middle finger it is.

528
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:06,414
You got this.

529
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:08,043
- Come on, Mike. Yeah.
- Come on, Mike.

530
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:11,712
Let's give it the middle finger.

531
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:26,852
What the hell was that?

532
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:30,481
- Poor Mikey. Mike, aw.
- You missed it.

533
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:34,402
Wow! That is a lot of backdraft.

534
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:38,489
Wouldn't it have been dumb
if broke up for nothing?

535
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:43,160
My Time Courier's working.

536
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:45,453
Go!

537
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,759
Oh! Looks like you guys
had a fun day. Rad.

538
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:03,097
Oh, there's a whole bowling thing
going on. Sort of high stakes.

539
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:05,349
Okay.

540
00:37:11,772 --> 00:37:16,360
- How we doing?
- It's the last shot and Astra's up.

541
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,824
- Sara, are you there?
<i>- Yeah, I'm here.</i>

542
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,159
Uh...

543
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:26,287
If Gary's calculations are correct,
you guys can actually win this thing.

544
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:31,375
But Astra needs to roll a strike.

545
00:37:41,552 --> 00:37:45,055
Of course the stakes couldn't be
any higher my first time bowling.

546
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:50,227
Look, it's gonna be all right.
We need to change tactics.

547
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,730
It's a very classic style.

548
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:55,024
All you got to do
is get right in the middle.

549
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:59,487
Nice deep bend, and roll it on through.

550
00:38:00,196 --> 00:38:04,909
I left Hell to bowl granny-style?
What's become of my life?

551
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:08,871
Hey, you got this, all right?
You have the whole team behind you.

552
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:21,050
Here goes nothing.

553
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:57,418
Go!

554
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,675
Go, go, go.

555
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,641
Astra!

556
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:29,743
Let's get out of here. Come on.

557
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:32,496
Hmm. You forgetting something?

558
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,207
How about a rematch?

559
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:36,876
Not a chance.

560
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:45,968
Let's put you back where you belong.

561
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:06,697
How about that?

562
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,241
I control the alley once again
thanks to you,

563
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:11,785
and I say it's open for everyone.

564
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:14,079
- Yeah!
- Babe, you did it.

565
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:16,332
- Hey.
- Hi.

566
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:20,169
- We're out of here.
- Rude.

567
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:23,631
Buddy, one last favor. Another round
of nachos for my friends?

568
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:25,758
- You bet.
- You're the best.

569
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:34,975
Aren't you curious?

570
00:40:35,643 --> 00:40:38,228
I sense in you powers
both mighty and abundant.

571
00:40:40,356 --> 00:40:41,440
Do you now?

572
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:45,694
Well, you have a keen eye,
bowling alley denizen. A keen eye.

573
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:52,326
Powers that will be the death of you.

574
00:40:56,163 --> 00:41:01,001
- I'm sorry I called bowling stupid.
- Bowling means a lot to me.

575
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:04,171
The old man who fostered me brought
me to league night every week.

576
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:06,090
Helped me feel like
I belonged to something.

577
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:07,925
Well, you belong with us now.

578
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:11,053
I know it's bad luck for you to see me
in a wedding dress.

579
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:13,097
Babe, you looked amazing.

580
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,015
You look amazing in whatever you wear,

581
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:18,394
but I love you too much
to let you get married in that thing.

582
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:25,067
It's great seeing folks have a good time
in the bowling alley again.

583
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:27,194
How about a team photo?

584
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:28,696
Oh! Come on, come on, come on.

585
00:41:28,779 --> 00:41:31,699
Okay. All right. Come on.

586
00:41:31,782 --> 00:41:33,659
Say cheese.
