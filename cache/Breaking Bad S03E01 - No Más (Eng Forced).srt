1
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:47,147
That's it!

2
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,191
Did you feel it?

3
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,860
Texas!

4
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:54,279
I've made this trip three times...

5
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:57,407
...and every time
there's three big bumps...

6
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,201
...and that's how you know!

7
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:01,787
We are officialIy in Texas!

8
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:11,129
This time I got a job waiting for me.

9
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:15,425
I got a cousin who's got a body shop.

10
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:17,052
Yo, that's for me, Homes!

11
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:22,182
They call me "Olive Oil" 
because I paint them sIick.

12
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:28,063
I do pearlescent, 
color-shift, you name it.

13
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,817
I painted cars for some of...

14
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:34,319
...the biggest gangsters in Michoacán.

15
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:38,699
Wow, those are beautiful boots!

16
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:43,120
Not much good for working, but....

17
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:46,748
Hey, what's on the toes there?
Little silver....
