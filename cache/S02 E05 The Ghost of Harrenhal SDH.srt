1
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,090
- You swear it?
- Catelyn: By the mother.

2
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,553
My son has no interest in the iron throne.

3
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,228
Then I see no reason
for hostility between us.

4
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,732
Your son can go on
calling himself king in the north.

5
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,235
The starks will have dominion
over all lands north of moat cailin,

6
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,196
provided he swears me an oath of fealty.

7
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,423
And the wording of this oath?

8
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:38,075
The same ned stark swore
to Robert 18 years ago.

9
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,872
Cat, their friendship held
the kingdoms together.

10
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,254
And in return for my son's loyalty?

11
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,758
In the morning, I'll
destroy my brother's army.

12
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,093
When that's done,

13
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,555
Baratheon and stark will fight
their common enemy together,

14
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,307
as they have done many times before.

15
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,650
Our two houses have always been close,

16
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:16,029
which is why I am begging you
to reconsider this battle.

17
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,553
Negotiate a peace with your brother.

18
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,783
Negotiate with Stannis? (Chuckles)

19
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,077
You heard him out there.

20
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,038
I'd have better luck debating the wind.

21
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,959
Please bring my terms to your son.

22
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,920
I believe we are natural allies.

23
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,338
I hope he feels the same.

24
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,383
Together we could end
this war in a fortnight.

25
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,676
(Wind howling)

26
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,095
(Hissing)

27
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,306
(Gasps)

28
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,935
- (Groans)
- (Hisses)

29
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,864
Man: Follow me!

30
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:05,245
- You'll die for this.
- No, wait, it wasn't her!

31
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,154
(Sobbing)

32
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,207
We've got to leave.

33
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,669
They'll hang you for this.

34
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,464
Now.

35
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,675
I won't leave him.

36
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,930
You can't avenge him if you're dead.

37
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,350
Man: Over there, go!

38
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,143
Not that way.

39
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,075
(Men shouting)

40
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,763
We need to go home.

41
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,850
- Loras.
- Littlefinger: My lord, my lady.

42
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,434
Get out.

43
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,603
Stannis will be here in an hour.

44
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,106
When he arrives,
renly's bannermen will flock to him.

45
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,751
Your former companions
will fight for the privilege

46
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,194
of selling you to their new king.

47
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,946
And you want that privilege for yourself.

48
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,657
You will note that I am standing here
talking to you,

49
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,534
not Stannis.

50
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,869
There's no time for this.

51
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,537
Ride back to highgarden, sister.

52
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,247
I'm not running from Stannis.

53
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,790
Brienne of tarth murdered renly.

54
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:14,916
I don't believe that.

55
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,627
You don't believe that.

56
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,298
Who gained the most from our king's death?

57
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,049
Stannis.

58
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,051
I will put a sword
through his righteous face.

59
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,887
You can't stay here.

60
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,973
He would have been a true king,

61
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,726
a good king.

62
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,171
Littlefinger: Tell me, ser loras,

63
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,771
what do you desire most in this world?

64
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:38,940
Revenge.

65
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,556
I have always found that
to be the purest of motivations,

66
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,905
but you won't have a chance
to put your sword through Stannis,

67
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,740
not today.

68
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,885
You'll be cut to pieces
before he sets foot on solid ground.

69
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,537
If it is justice that you
want, be smart about it.

70
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,165
You can't avenge him from the grave.

71
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,919
Bring the horses.

72
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,881
Please.

73
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,037
He was very handsome.

74
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,747
He was, your grace.

75
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,916
"Your grace."

76
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,170
Calling yourself king doesn't make you one.

77
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,298
And if renly wasn't a
king, I wasn't a queen.

78
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,635
Do you want to be a queen?

79
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,557
I want to be the queen.

80
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,652
(Laughing)

81
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,655
Killed? By whom?

82
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,156
Tyrion: Accounts differ.

83
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,993
Most seem to implicate catelyn stark
in some way.

84
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,744
Really? Who'd have thought?

85
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,163
Some say it was one of his own kingsguard,

86
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,833
while still others say
it was Stannis himself who did it

87
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,085
after negotiations went sour.

88
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,004
Whomever did it, I say well done.

89
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,422
It's not what varys says.

90
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,133
He says renly's army
is flocking to support Stannis,

91
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,845
which would give Stannis superiority
over us on both land and sea.

92
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,264
Littlefinger says we can
outspend him three to one.

93
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,392
And I say father raised you
to have too much respect for money.

94
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,146
Stannis Baratheon is coming for us,
sooner rather than later.

95
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,498
Aren't there other things
you should be doing,

96
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,941
like sealing my daughter in a crate
so you can ship her away?

97
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,109
She'll be safer in dorne.

98
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,254
Yes, I know how concerned you are
for her safety.

99
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,071
It so happens that I am.

100
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,450
Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl
and I don't blame her at all for you.

101
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,119
So clever.

102
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:01,082
Aren't you always so clever
with your schemes and your plots?

103
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,960
Schemes and plots are the same thing.

104
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,212
They are going to attack us.

105
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,756
We need to be ready.

106
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,091
No need to concern yourself over it.

107
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,887
The king is taking personal charge
of siege preparations.

108
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,182
May I ask specifically
what the king has in mind?

109
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,684
You may, specifically,
or you may ask vaguely.

110
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,811
The answer will be the same.

111
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,819
It's important that we talk about this.

112
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,617
It's the king's royal prerogative

113
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,245
to withhold sensitive information
from his councilors.

114
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,543
(Door closes)

115
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,006
Lancel: It's wildfire.

116
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,591
Wildfire?

117
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,678
You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?

118
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,598
- No.
- That's a lie right there.

119
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,809
It is not a lie. Why would I lie?

120
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,603
Tell me,

121
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:07,357
if the vile allegations
against my brother and sister are true,

122
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,111
do you think it will make Jaime
more likely to kill you or less likely?

123
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,073
When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean.

124
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,783
I'm telling you the truth.

125
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,385
The smart money would be on more likely.

126
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,619
She's making wildfire.

127
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,556
But then perhaps his own unnatural urges
will give him sympathy for yours.

128
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,225
The alchemists' guild
is being commissioned.

129
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,768
I suppose there's only one way to find out.

130
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,503
They have thousands of pots
already stored in their vaults.

131
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,523
They are planning to launch it
from the city walls

132
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,340
into Stannis' ships and armies.

133
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,175
Please.

134
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,720
When did she tell you this?

135
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,432
I heard her talking with the pyromancer.

136
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,938
And the other night, after I left her,
she went to meet him.

137
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,023
I swear to you.

138
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,525
Swear to me on what?

139
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,776
On my life.

140
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,388
But I don't care about your life.

141
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,323
In the light of the seven,
by all that is holy and right,

142
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,868
I, lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow...

143
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:03,621
All right, all right. Enough.
Even torturing you is boring.

144
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,456
Just get out.

145
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,085
(Grunts)

146
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,004
Oh, lancel, tell my friend bronn

147
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,882
to please kill you
if anything should happen to me.

148
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,926
Please kill me if anything
should happen to lord Tyrion.

149
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,139
It will be my pleasure.

150
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,187
Your grace.

151
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,938
What is it?

152
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,232
I'm sorry about your brother, your grace.

153
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,860
I wanted to let you know
that people grieve for him.

154
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,029
Fools love a fool.

155
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:40,074
I grieve for him as well, for the boy
he was, not the man he grew to be.

156
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,451
I need to speak to you

157
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,596
- about what I saw in that cave.
- I thought I made it clear to you

158
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,014
there'd be no need to speak to me
on this matter.

159
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,039
Your grace, I...

160
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,458
I've never known you to need
to hear a thing twice.

161
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,128
And I've never known you
to hide from the truth.

162
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,653
You've come to lecture me on truth?

163
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,107
I've come to tell you that what I saw...

164
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,300
All my brother's bannermen
have come to my side.

165
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,472
Except the tyrells, who fled like cowards.

166
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,515
They won't be able to resist us now.

167
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,285
Soon I shall be sitting on the iron throne.

168
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,749
Nothing is worth what this will cost you,
not even the iron...

169
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,438
I'll hear no more about it.

170
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,865
Man: Take a company of men,
secure the perimeter.

171
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,910
When do we sail for king's landing?

172
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,246
As soon as I've consolidated my troops.

173
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,417
We'll make short work
of the lannisters' fleet.

174
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,500
Once Blackwater bay is cleared,

175
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,753
we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep
and take the city.

176
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,881
And will you bring lady
melisandre with you?

177
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,176
That's not your concern.

178
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,805
If you take king's landing with her
by your side, the victory will be hers.

179
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,528
I never thought I'd have reason
to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?

180
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,851
Loyal service means telling hard truths.

181
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,187
Oh, truth again.

182
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,690
All right, what's the truth?

183
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,567
The hard truth?

184
00:12:56,651 --> 00:13:00,446
She's a foreigner
preaching her foreign religion.

185
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,575
Some believe she whispers
orders in your ear and you obey.

186
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,372
What do you believe?

187
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,920
You won those bannermen from renly.

188
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,548
Don't lose them to her.

189
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,306
We set out for king's landing
without lady melisandre.

190
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,154
And you lead the fleet into Blackwater bay.

191
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,814
Your grace, I'm honored,
but my time on the sea

192
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,483
was spent evading
ships, not attacking them.

193
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,152
The other lords won't be happy.

194
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,238
Most of those lords
should consider themselves lucky

195
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,574
I don't hang them for treason.

196
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,746
Hard truths out both ways, ser davos.

197
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,724
Girl: I've got it! I've got it!

198
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,060
Man: So it's that one there at the top,
on the right.

199
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,564
Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit.

200
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:20,151
Stannis has more infantry,
more ships, more horses.

201
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,736
What do we have?

202
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,447
There's that mind of yours
you keep going on about.

203
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,992
Well, I've never actually been able
to kill people with it.

204
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,453
Good thing. I'd be out of a job.

205
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,622
What about your father?

206
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,249
He hasn't sent a raven in weeks.

207
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,919
He's very busy.

208
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,923
Being repeatedly humiliated by robb stark
is time-consuming.

209
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,276
We won't be able to
hold the city against Stannis,

210
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,861
not the way Joffrey's
planning on holding it.

211
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,096
Man: Corruption. Crowd: Yes!

212
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:52,642
We are swollen, bloated, foul.

213
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,020
Brother fornicates with sister
in the bed of kings

214
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,440
and we're surprised
when the fruit of their incest is rotten?

215
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:00,608
(Cheering)

216
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,486
Yes, a rotten king.

217
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,447
It's hard to argue with his assessment.

218
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,741
Not after what he did
to your birthday present.

219
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,661
The king is a lost cause.

220
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,080
It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.

221
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,834
A dancing king,
prancing down his bloodstained halls

222
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,504
to the tune of a twisted demon monkey.

223
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:22,797
(Laughing)

224
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,675
You have to admire his imagination.

225
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,677
He's talking about you.

226
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,930
What? Demon monkey?

227
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,349
People think you're
pulling the king's strings.

228
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,560
They blame you for the city's ills.

229
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,937
Blame me? I'm trying to save them.

230
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,273
You don't need to convince me.

231
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,526
Demon monkey.

232
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,177
(Men laughing)

233
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,765
Yeah, come on.

234
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,449
Theon: You're the crew of the sea bitch?

235
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,770
I'm your commander. Welcome.

236
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,608
Stop.

237
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,902
Stop!

238
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,155
Your captain commands you to stop!

239
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,283
Where are we headed, captain?

240
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,330
The stony shore, to raid their villages.

241
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,875
There'll be spoils in it for you,
and women, if you do yourjobs well.

242
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,086
And who decides if
we've done our jobs well?

243
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,256
I do.

244
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,425
Your captain.

245
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,511
(All laughing)

246
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:57,600
I have been reaving and raping since
before you left balon's balls, captain.

247
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:02,605
Don't reckon I've got much use
for your ideas on how to do it.

248
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,900
Don't reckon I've got much use
for a captain at all.

249
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,987
I'm thinking I can do the job of captain
real well myself.

250
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,240
All I need is a ship.

251
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:17,119
You wouldn't know where I could
find myself a ship now, would you?

252
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:24,919
You could do that,
take the ship, head out on your own.

253
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,839
And I will hunt you down, drag you back
here in chains and hang you for a traitor.

254
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,467
Stop. We yield.

255
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,974
Congratulations on your first command.

256
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,685
Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.

257
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,978
Oh, I'm not here for you.

258
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,398
I was just on my way to red harbor.

259
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,110
I've got 30 ships.
There's nowhere to put them here.

260
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,736
Too narrow.

261
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,115
You'd better get out there.
Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.

262
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,409
That would never happen.

263
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,954
My crew would wait on deck
for a year if I asked them to.

264
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,373
This lot, though...

265
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,210
Enjoy the stony shore.

266
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,676
Come on, I'll take you out.

267
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,761
Who are you?

268
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,847
Dagmer, your first mate.

269
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,267
Why aren't you with the rest of them?

270
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,104
Or did they send you to row me out
and dump me halfway in the sea?

271
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,480
That would be good for a laugh.

272
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,609
They're not gonna respect you
until you prove yourself.

273
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,862
And how am I supposed to prove myself
by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?

274
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,363
You're not.

275
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:40,202
And yet that's the task my father has given
me to prove that I'm a true iron islander.

276
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,997
They're all iron islanders.

277
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,626
Do they do as they're told
or do they do as they like?

278
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,844
Theon: The stony shore's not far
from torrhen's square.

279
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,263
The seat of the house of tallhart,

280
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,891
a more impressive prize
than a few fishermen's daughters.

281
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,771
- What, you don't think we could take it?
- No, we could.

282
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,939
We could never hold it
for more than a few days.

283
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,376
As soon as winterfell got word
that we'd taken torrhen's square,

284
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,445
the starks would send their men
to take it back.

285
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,280
And then...

286
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,331
Take me to my ship.

287
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,005
The starks have overextended their lines.

288
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,983
Now that summer's over,
they'll have a hard time

289
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,842
keeping their men and horses fed.

290
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,046
The starks understand winter
better than we ever will.

291
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,930
The cold won't beat them.

292
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:45,726
Our spies report growing discontent
among the northern lords.

293
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:50,272
They want to return home and
gather the harvest before the crops turn.

294
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,109
And I'm sure if those same spies
snuck into our own encampments,

295
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,153
they would report growing discontent
amongst the southern lords.

296
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,781
This is war, no one's content.

297
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,328
We've underestimated
the stark boy for too long.

298
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,957
He has a good mind for warfare,
his men worship him.

299
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,628
And as long as he keeps winning battles,
they'll keep believing he is king in the north.

300
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,214
You've been waiting for him to fail.

301
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:19,260
He is not going to fail,
not without our help.

302
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,849
So how do we stop him?

303
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,892
Reginald: We've worked
through the night, my lord.

304
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,645
Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep.

305
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,689
Yes, I think you would, Reginald.

306
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:35,484
And because you're my cousin,
I might even let you wake from that sleep.

307
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,113
Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you.

308
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,031
My wife's in lannisport.

309
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,159
Well, then you'd better start riding.

310
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,997
Go, before I change my mind
and send her your head.

311
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,124
If your name wasn't Lannister,

312
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,836
you'd be scrubbing out pots
in the cook's tent. Go!

313
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,841
Not wine, water.

314
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:00,843
We'll be here for some time.

315
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,141
Girl.

316
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,644
Where are you from?

317
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,521
Maidenpool, my lord.

318
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:17,067
And who are the lords of maidenpool?
Remind me.

319
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,945
House mooton, my lord.

320
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,739
And what is their sigil?

321
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,120
A red salmon.

322
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,873
I think a maidenpool girl
would remember that.

323
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,043
You're a northerner, aren't you?

324
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,380
Good. One more time, where are you from?

325
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,633
Barrowton, my lord.

326
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,593
House Dustin.

327
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,346
Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.

328
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,935
And what do they say
of robb stark in the north?

329
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,440
They call him the young wolf.

330
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:57,817
And?

331
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,381
They say he rides into battle
on the back of a giant dire wolf.

332
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,535
They say he can turn into
a wolf himself when he wants.

333
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,578
They say he can't be killed.

334
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,540
And do you believe them?

335
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,584
No, my lord.

336
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,712
Anyone can be killed.

337
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,930
Fetch that water.

338
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,681
A girl says nothing.

339
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,061
A girl keeps her mouth closed.

340
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:22,151
No one hears,
and friends may talk in secret, yes?

341
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,449
A boy becomes a girl.

342
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,992
I was always a girl.

343
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,161
And I was always aware.

344
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,955
But the girl keeps secrets.

345
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,292
It is not for a man to spoil them.

346
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,587
You're one of them now.

347
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,467
I should have let you burn.

348
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,555
And you fetch water for one of them now.

349
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:55,351
Why is this right for you and wrong for me?

350
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,771
- I didn't have a choice.
- You did.

351
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:00,814
I did.

352
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,400
And here we are.

353
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,155
A man pays his debts.

354
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,366
A man owes three.

355
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,825
Three what?

356
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:16,205
The red god takes what is his, lovely girl.

357
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,416
And only death may pay for life.

358
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,087
You saved me and the two I was with.

359
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,215
You stole three deaths from the red god.

360
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,553
We have to give them back.

361
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,934
Speak three names

362
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,937
and the man will do the rest.

363
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,482
Three lives I will give you,

364
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,275
no more, no less,

365
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,652
and we're done.

366
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,821
I can name anyone

367
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,532
and you'll kill him?

368
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,410
A man has said.

369
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:58,914
The one who tortures everyone.

370
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,749
A man needs a name.

371
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,751
I don't know his name.

372
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,670
They call him the tickler.

373
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,422
That is enough.

374
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,634
Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty.

375
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,062
Mormont: He's not here yet.

376
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:28,736
He'd have seen us, blown the horn.

377
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,320
Jon: When will he come?

378
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:33,073
The halfhand does things in his own time.

379
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,534
My uncle told me stories about him.

380
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,036
Most of them are true.

381
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,414
I heard the halfhand
spent half of last winter beyond the wall.

382
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,707
The whole winter.

383
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,251
He was north of the skirling pass
when the snows came.

384
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,211
Had to wait for the thaw.

385
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,965
So it is possible for someone
to survive out here on their own.

386
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,260
Well, possible for the halfhand.

387
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,137
Beautiful, isn't it?

388
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,723
Gilly would love it here.

389
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,560
There's nothing more sickening
than a man in love.

390
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:12,196
(Man chattering)

391
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:31,173
Man: About time you did something.

392
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,675
At least you'll keep warm.

393
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,013
The fist of the first men.

394
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,350
Think of how old this place is.

395
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,561
Before the targaryens defeated the andals,

396
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:47,106
before the andals took Westeros
from the first men.

397
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,900
Before I die, please, stop talking.

398
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:55,781
Thousands and thousands of years ago, the
first men stood here where we're standing

399
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,991
all through the long night.

400
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,830
What do you think they were like,
the first men?

401
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:04,248
Stupid.

402
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,417
Smart people don't find themselves
in places like this.

403
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,628
I think they were afraid.

404
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:14,049
I think they came here
to get away from something.

405
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,553
And I don't think it worked.

406
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:18,637
(Horn sounding)

407
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:22,808
Wildlings?

408
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,813
Jon: One blast is for rangers returning.

409
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,523
Wildlings is two blasts.

410
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,985
So you got to stand there waiting,

411
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,112
wondering.

412
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,697
One blast for friends,

413
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,658
two for foes.

414
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,537
And three for white walkers.

415
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,710
It's been a thousand years,

416
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,504
but that's the only time
they blow the horn three times.

417
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,798
But if it's been a thousand years,
how do you know?

418
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,468
- Well...
- Both: I read it in a book.

419
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,554
Look.

420
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,266
It's qhorin halfhand.

421
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,144
Aye, we'll live another day.

422
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,605
Hurrah.

423
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,783
Take care, my lord.

424
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,995
I remember reading an old sailors' proverb,

425
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,998
"piss on wildfire and your cock burns off."

426
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:31,627
Oh, I have not conducted this experiment.

427
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,171
It could well be true.

428
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:39,301
The substance burns so hot,
it melts wood, stone, even steel,

429
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,803
and, of course, flesh.

430
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:47,142
The substance burns so hot,
it melts flesh like tallow.

431
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:55,859
After the dragons died, wildfire
was the key to the Targaryen power.

432
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:57,236
(Bronn scoffs)

433
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,029
My companion takes issue.

434
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:03,617
If I could tell you how many crazy old men
I've seen pushing carts around army camps

435
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,286
making grand claims
aboutjars full of pig shit.

436
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:10,666
- No offense meant.
- Our order does not deal in pig shit.

437
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,085
The substance is fire given form.

438
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,505
And we have been perfecting it
since the days of maegor.

439
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,631
To do what?

440
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:21,385
The jars are put in catapults
and flung at the enemy.

441
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,012
How much do you have?

442
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:31,103
If you could get real soldiers
to man the catapults,

443
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,690
then maybe you'd hit
your target one time in ten,

444
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,859
but all the real soldiers
are in the riverlands with your father.

445
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,945
My lord, this man is insulting.

446
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,155
I don't know if you've ever seen a battle,
old man,

447
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,782
but things can get a bit messy.

448
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:47,369
'Cause when we're flinging things at
Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us.

449
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,414
Men die, men shit themselves, men run,

450
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,165
which means pots falling,

451
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,001
which means fire inside the walls,

452
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:58,839
which means the poor cunts trying to defend
the city end up burning it down.

453
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,924
My friend remains unconvinced.

454
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:05,095
He would not dare insult my order
whilst aerys Targaryen lived.

455
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,597
Well, he's not living anymore.

456
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,726
And all his pots of wildfire
didn't help him, did they?

457
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:14,396
Men win wars, not magic tricks.

458
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:34,499
We have been working tirelessly,
day and night,

459
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:39,004
ever since your royal sister
commanded us to do so.

460
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:44,384
Our present count stands at 7,811.

461
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:50,182
Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet
and armies both.

462
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,225
This is a shit idea.

463
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,521
I'm afraid I have to concur
with my advisor, wisdom hallyne.

464
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:01,193
The contents of this room
could lay king's landing low.

465
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:06,114
You won't be making wildfire
for my sister any longer.

466
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,744
You'll be making it for me.

467
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,595
- (Dragon chitters)
- (Speaking high valyrian)

468
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:27,803
(Squeaks)

469
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,890
(Speaking high valyrian)

470
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,518
(Hisses)

471
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,852
(Screeches)

472
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,312
(Chuckles)

473
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:44,319
He'll be able to feed himself from now on.

474
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,158
Let him sleep, doreah.

475
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,077
Yes, khaleesi.

476
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,665
He loves you.

477
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:03,672
I rewove this part of the top.

478
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,759
And I fixed the heel on this one.

479
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,678
Thank you, my friend.

480
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,850
Did you see the dress
xaro had made for you?

481
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,311
They say he's the wealthiest man in qarth.

482
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,563
It is known.

483
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,775
And if qarth is the
wealthiest city in essos...

484
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:27,863
The last time a rich man gave me a dress,
he was selling me to khal drogo.

485
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:31,533
May he ride forever
through the night lands.

486
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,372
Xaro is our host,
but we know nothing about him.

487
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:42,252
Men like to talk about other men
when they're happy.

488
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,262
You would look like a real Princess
in xaro's...

489
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:55,056
She's not a Princess. She's a khaleesi.

490
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,732
You should wear it, khaleesi.

491
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,902
You are their guest.
It would be rude not to.

492
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,909
(Door opens)

493
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,995
(Door closes)

494
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,414
- (People chatting)
- (Birds squawking)

495
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,250
(Music playing)

496
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,964
(Woman laughing)

497
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,926
And you must visit the night market.

498
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:34,804
The qartheen night market
is like no night market you've ever seen.

499
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,681
It sounds wonderful.

500
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,059
The meereenis think
they have a night market.

501
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,353
I will take you there myself.

502
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,605
Please excuse me for a moment.

503
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,149
(Men speaking Dothraki)

504
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,194
What are they doing?

505
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,613
Malakko says the statue
is too heavy to carry.

506
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,407
Kovarro says that malakko is an idiot.

507
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,202
They can pry out the gems,
the rest is pure gold.

508
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,288
Very soft.
He can chop off as much as we can carry.

509
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,707
Or melt it. Very simple.

510
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,209
We are his guests!

511
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,128
You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.

512
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:08,797
Of course not, khaleesi!

513
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,091
We will wait until we leave.

514
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,759
Not even when we leave.

515
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,678
Why not?

516
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,556
Our host saved us from the
red waste and you want to steal from him?

517
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,308
I will hear no more.

518
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,319
My brother used to say
the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do

519
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,572
was steal things better men have built.

520
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,073
It's not the only thing.

521
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,956
They're quite good at
killing the better men.

522
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,452
That's not the kind of
queen I'm going to be.

523
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,413
Pyat pree: Mother of dragons.

524
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:46,418
On behalf of the warlocks of qarth,
I welcome you.

525
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,297
A demonstration?

526
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:53,592
Take this gem.

527
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:55,468
Look at it.

528
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,513
Into its depths.

529
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,683
So many facets.

530
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:06,354
Look closely enough
and you can see yourself in them.

531
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,150
Often more than once.

532
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:17,407
Should you grow tired
of xaro's baubles and trinkets,

533
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,619
it would be an honor
to host you at the house of the undying.

534
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:24,706
You are always welcome, mother of dragons.

535
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:31,755
(Guests applauding)

536
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,841
My apologies.

537
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,926
Pyat pree is one of the thirteen.

538
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,138
It was customary for me
to extend him an invitation.

539
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:43,183
Customs die slow deaths in qarth.

540
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,727
What is the house of the undying?

541
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:49,689
It is where the warlocks go
to squint at dusty books

542
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,149
and drink shade of the evening.

543
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:55,195
It turns their lips blue
and their minds soft.

544
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:59,866
So soft, they actually believe
their parlor tricks are magic.

545
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,914
Woman: You watch over her.

546
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:09,918
Do I know you?

547
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,711
I know you.

548
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,589
Jorah mormont of bear island.

549
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,092
Who are you?

550
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,302
I'm no one.

551
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,513
But she is the mother of dragons.

552
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:25,183
She needs true protectors,
now more than ever.

553
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:30,021
They shall come day and night to see
the wonder born into the world again.

554
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:33,108
And when they see, they shall lust,

555
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:36,945
for dragons are fire made flesh.

556
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,447
And fire is power.

557
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,293
It looked like Stannis.

558
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,005
To me it just looked like...

559
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,636
A shadow in the shape of a man.

560
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,763
In the shape of Stannis.

561
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,396
We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.

562
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,398
Will you stay there long, my lady?

563
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,818
Only long enough
to tell robb what I have seen.

564
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:20,321
After that, I will leave for winterfell.

565
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,117
My two youngest need me.

566
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,619
I've been away from them for far too long.

567
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,330
I never knew my mother.

568
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,125
I'm sorry.

569
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,962
My own mother died on the birthing bed

570
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,465
when I was very young.

571
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,345
It's a bloody business.

572
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:48,349
What comes after is even harder.

573
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:52,937
Once you're safely back
amongst your own people,

574
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,982
will you give me leave to go, my lady?

575
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,151
You mean to kill Stannis.

576
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,069
I swore a vow.

577
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:03,448
But Stannis has a great army around him.

578
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,159
His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.

579
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,535
I'm as good as any of them.

580
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,663
I should never have fled.

581
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,209
Renly's death was no fault of yours.

582
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,252
You served him bravely.

583
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,547
I only held him that once

584
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,675
as he was dying.

585
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,138
He's gone, brienne.

586
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:31,559
You serve nothing and no one
by following him into the earth.

587
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,814
Renly's enemies are robb's enemies as well.

588
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,612
I do not know your son, my lady.

589
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,660
But I could serve you,
if you would have me.

590
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:50,912
You have courage.

591
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,834
Not battle courage, perhaps,
but, I don't know,

592
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,420
a woman's kind of courage.

593
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:03,007
And I think that when the time comes,
you will not hold me back.

594
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:06,594
Promise me that you will not hold me back
from Stannis.

595
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:15,770
When the time comes,
I will not hold you back.

596
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,737
Then I am yours, my lady.

597
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:30,618
I will shield your back and give
my life for yours, if it comes to that.

598
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:33,913
I swear it by the old gods and the new.

599
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:45,133
I vow that you shall always
have a place in my home

600
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,634
and at my table

601
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:51,472
and that I shall ask no service of you
that might bring you dishonor.

602
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,310
I swear it by the old gods and the new.

603
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,396
(Thuds)

604
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,149
Man: And it's not just thieves, my lord.

605
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,776
There's wolves in them hills now,

606
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,029
more than I ever seen.

607
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:08,990
They come down in the night
and they kill my sheep.

608
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,911
My three sons is away
fighting for your brother, my lord.

609
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:16,456
They'll fight, keep fighting
till they're told to go home.

610
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,792
I have no one to man my flock now. Only me.

611
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,421
I can't keep watch all day and all night.

612
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,468
We can send two orphan boys
from winterstown home with you

613
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,345
to help watch over your flock

614
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,013
if you can give them room and board.

615
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,141
My wife always prayed for more children.

616
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,602
We'll look after them. Thank you, my lord.

617
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,229
And may the gods bless you and yours.

618
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,359
Stop it.

619
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,988
If that's everyone,
I'm going to go for a ride before dark.

620
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,366
- Good.
- Hodor.

621
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,160
- Hodor.
- Ah! Lord stark.

622
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:56,704
Torrhen's square is under siege.

623
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,374
Torrhen's square
is barely 40 leagues from here.

624
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,543
How can the lannisters strike so far north?

625
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,463
Might be a raiding party
led by the mountain.

626
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,548
Might be sellswords
paid by tywin Lannister.

627
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,800
We have to help them.

628
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:12,303
Most of the fighting men are away with
robb, but I can gather 200 decent men.

629
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:13,638
Do you need so many?

630
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,516
If we can't protect our own bannermen,
why should they protect us?

631
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,561
Go, ser rodrik. Take the men you need.

632
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,773
Won't take long, my lord.
Southerners don't do well up here.

633
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,744
- (Bird squawks)
- Bran: So, what does it mean?

634
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:40,331
Ask your maester luwin.
He's the one studying books all the time.

635
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:43,751
I did ask him.
He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.

636
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,170
Must not mean anything, then.

637
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,296
You're lying.

638
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,258
You might be a little lord,
but don't you call me a liar.

639
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,261
- You know what it means.
- I never said I didn't.

640
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,263
You didn't give me an honest answer.

641
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,016
That's not the same as being a liar.

642
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,726
Well, it's not far off.

643
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:03,271
So, you've been dreaming
of a three-eyed raven again?

644
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:08,985
In the godswood,
you told me you didn't dream.

645
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:10,695
Now who's a liar?

646
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,492
What did you see in your dream?

647
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,913
Something bad?

648
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,624
Tell me, boy.

649
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,630
I dreamt that the sea came to winterfell.

650
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,801
I saw waves crashing against the gates

651
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,638
and the water came
flowing over the walls...

652
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:42,268
It flooded the castle.

653
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,023
Drowned men were floating here,

654
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,108
in the yard.

655
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,946
Ser rodrik was one of them.

656
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,368
The sea is hundreds of miles away.

657
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,661
I know.

658
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,433
- It's just a stupid dream.
- I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen.

659
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,250
Othennise they'll put me in chains again.

660
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,919
Osha.

661
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,504
The three-eyed raven,

662
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:14,175
what do they say about
it north of the wall?

663
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:19,680
They say all sorts of crazy things
north of the wall.

664
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,314
- (Wind howling)
- (Horses neighing)

665
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:33,111
Qhorin: There. Mormont: Where?

666
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,862
On that mountain.

667
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,448
Samwell: I don't see very well.

668
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:38,574
Jon: A fire.

669
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,371
There's a fire.

670
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:47,083
The people sitting around it
have better eyes than yours or mine.

671
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,711
When they see us coming,
that fire becomes a signal.

672
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:54,382
Gives mance rayder plenty of time
to throw a party in our honor.

673
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,467
How many wildlings have joined him?

674
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:59,554
From what we can tell, all of them.

675
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,478
Mance has gathered them all
like deer against the wolves.

676
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,230
They're almost ready to make their move.

677
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:13,067
- Where?
- Somewhere safe.

678
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,861
Somewhere south.

679
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,572
Can'tjust march into their midst.

680
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,492
And we can't wait for them here with
nothing but a pile of stones to protect us.

681
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,579
You saying we should fall back to the wall?

682
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,832
Mance was one of us once.

683
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,585
Now he's one of them.

684
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,588
He's going to teach them
our way of doing things.

685
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:37,508
They'll hit us in force
and they won't run away when we hit back.

686
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:41,846
They're gonna be more organized
than before, more disciplined,

687
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:43,973
more like us.

688
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:48,269
So we need to be more like them,
do things their way.

689
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,689
Sneak in, kill mance,

690
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:55,568
and scatter them to the winds
before they can march on the wall.

691
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:58,779
- And to do that...
- We need to get rid of those lookouts.

692
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:01,199
It's not a job for 400 men.

693
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:03,951
I need to move fast and silent.

694
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:08,164
Harker, stonesnake, borba.

695
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,375
Lord commander, I'd
like to join lord qhorin.

696
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,339
I've been called lots of things,
but that might be my first lord qhorin.

697
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:17,506
(Laughing)

698
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,884
You're a steward, snow, not a ranger.

699
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,677
I've fought and killed a wight.

700
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,679
How many rangers can say that?

701
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:25,097
He's the one?

702
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,185
Aye. You killed a wight.

703
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:33,773
You also let an old man beat you bloody
and take your sword.

704
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:35,358
(All laughing)

705
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,692
Qhorin: Craster?

706
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:39,153
In the boy's defense,
that's a tough old goat.

707
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,159
I could take up Jon's duties
while he's gone, my lord.

708
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,454
It would be no trouble.

709
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:01,467
Well, I hope you make a better ranger
than you do a steward.

710
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,887
Go on.

711
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,313
Xaro: So, tell me,

712
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:17,942
how long has your manservant
been in love with you?

713
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:21,612
He's not my manservant
and he's not in love with me.

714
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,364
He's my advisor,

715
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,157
my friend.

716
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:26,742
Unlikely.

717
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:29,745
I can almost always tell what a man wants.

718
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:32,039
And what about what a woman wants?

719
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,000
Much more complicated.

720
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:37,878
You, for example, what do you want?

721
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:41,716
To cross the narrow sea
and take back the iron throne.

722
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,177
Because I promised my khalasar
I'd protect them

723
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:47,305
- and find them a safe home.
- (Chuckles)

724
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:50,599
You want to conquer
the seven kingdoms for the Dothraki?

725
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:52,810
I want them because they're mine by right.

726
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:56,147
The iron throne is mine and I will take it.

727
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:57,732
Ah, a conqueror.

728
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:01,068
And how did you get all of this?
Did someone give it to you?

729
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:05,906
No. I come from nothing.
I hit the docks like a piece of cargo,

730
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,159
except someone normally cares
what happens to cargo.

731
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,911
So you wanted more than you had
and you took it.

732
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,999
You're a conqueror, too.
You're just less ambitious.

733
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,334
(Chuckles)

734
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:22,340
What do you want, xaro xhoan daxos?

735
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,092
At the gates of the city, you bled for me.

736
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,431
I will show you why.

737
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,271
The door and the vault
is made ofvalyrian stone.

738
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:41,192
The hardest steel does not make a Mark.

739
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:46,614
I offered the greatest locksmiths in qarth their
weight in gold if they could break into it.

740
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:49,533
I made the same offer
to the greatest thieves.

741
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,036
They all went home empty-handed.

742
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,289
The only thing that can open this door

743
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,583
is this key.

744
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,043
And behind the door?

745
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,588
(Xaro chuckles)

746
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,548
And it can all be mine?

747
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:07,468
All? Let us say half.

748
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:14,100
More than enough
to buy horses, ships, armies...

749
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,018
Enough to go home.

750
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:18,896
All I have to do?

751
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:20,606
Is marry me.

752
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:24,068
That was a romantic proposal.

753
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:28,030
I've already married once for love,
but the gods stole her from me.

754
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,285
I come from nothing.

755
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:36,205
My mother and father
never owned a pair of shoes.

756
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,625
But marry me,
and I will give you the seven kingdoms

757
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:43,087
and our children
will be princes and princesses.

758
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,133
See?

759
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:49,927
I have more ambition than you thought.

760
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,099
The time is right,
Daenerys Targaryen, first of your name.

761
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:58,060
Robert Baratheon is dead.

762
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:07,396
Jorah: If you cross the sea
with an army you bought...

763
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:09,780
The seven kingdoms
are at war with one another.

764
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,366
Four false kings destroying the country.

765
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:15,119
To win Westeros,
you need support from Westeros.

766
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,496
The usurper is dead.

767
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:21,000
The starks fight the lannisters,
and baratheons fight each other.

768
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:24,378
According to your new friend
who earned your trust by cutting his hand?

769
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:27,506
The time to strike is now.
We need to find ships and an army

770
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:30,277
or we'll spend the rest of our lives
rotting away at the edge of the world.

771
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:32,803
Rich men do not become rich
by giving more than they get.

772
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,931
They'll give you ships and soldiers
and they'll own you forever.

773
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:39,185
Moving carefully is the hard way,
but it's the right way.

774
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,580
And if I'd listened to that advice
outside the gates of qarth,

775
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:43,230
we'd all be dead by now.

776
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:46,484
I know the opportunity before you
seems like the last you'll ever have,

777
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:50,070
- but you must...
- Do not speak to me like I'm a child.

778
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:54,408
- I only want...
- What do you want?

779
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,535
Tell me.

780
00:49:57,244 --> 00:50:00,247
- To see you on the iron throne.
- Why?

781
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,624
You have a good claim.

782
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,918
A title. A birthright.

783
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,671
But you have something more than that.

784
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:12,218
You may cover it up and deny it,
but you have a gentle heart.

785
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:15,471
You would not only be respected and feared,
you would be loved.

786
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,433
Someone who can rule and should rule.

787
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,520
Centuries come and go without
a person like that coming into the world.

788
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:28,609
There are times when I look at you
and I still can't believe you're real.

789
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,916
So what would you have me do,
as my advisor?

790
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,382
Make your own way.

791
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,593
Find your own ship. You only need one.

792
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:57,471
The allies we need are
in Westeros, not qarth.

793
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,475
And how do I get the ship?

794
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,561
I'll find it for you.

795
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,313
A sound ship with a good captain.

796
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,280
I look foward to meeting him.

797
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,660
Khaleesi.

798
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,422
(Dragons chirping)

799
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,388
(Water sizzling)

800
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:51,483
You should stand sideface.

801
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:52,568
Sideface?

802
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,071
Sideways.

803
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,366
Smaller target.

804
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,412
Am I fighting someone?

805
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:04,862
You're practicing for a fight.

806
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,375
You should practice right.

807
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:12,004
- (Loud thud)
- (Woman screaming)

808
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,255
Man: Guards!

809
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,468
Did you see anything?

810
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,389
Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.

811
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:28,729
Go up the battlement.

812
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,697
Move away.

813
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,910
Stand back. He's dead.
