[Barry] <i>Think about Witness Protection.</i>

00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,596
[Iris West]
<i>Dad, we should do this way more often.</i>

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,349
[Barry] <i>Wherever I go,
part of me is with you.</i>

4
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:16,059
[Cecile] <i>I don't think I can do this.</i>

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,438
[Joe] <i>I have to go. It's the only
way to keep our family safe.</i>

00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:23,483
[whooshing]

7
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:29,114
Hands up. Don't move.

8
00:00:30,907 --> 00:00:34,327
Oh. You scared the bejesus outta me.

9
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:37,038
Oh, my God, what happened?

10
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:39,541
Oh!

11
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,252
[Barry] It's Iris.

12
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:07,944
Wally warned me
that something was off with Iris.

13
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:09,904
And then... Sunshine attacked Frost.

14
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:13,908
I noticed that she was
being weird with you.

15
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:14,993
Cold, even.

16
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:18,121
[sighs] I just didn't say anything.

17
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:21,082
- It's not your fault.
- Well, it feels like it.

18
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:26,171
- Where are the other duplicates now?
- Iris' copy is gone.

19
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:30,216
She... It...

20
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,511
shattered into a million pieces
right in front of me.

21
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:35,972
I know it wasn't her.

22
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:39,225
But right before it happened,
she seemed so...

23
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,145
alive.

24
00:01:43,897 --> 00:01:45,565
Almost like she was really back.

25
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:48,419
I'm trying to have hope
that it's all gonna work out,

26
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:51,696
but I can't help feeling...

27
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:56,201
Joe, what if I can't save her this time?

28
00:01:56,284 --> 00:01:57,619
I believe that you can.

29
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,038
But, do you?

30
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:09,839
They're just gone?

31
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:13,009
What does that even mean, "Mirrorverse"?
Can we even get them back?

32
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:15,845
Oh, my God,
we have to warn David's husband.

33
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:17,889
I've been living with
some copy of Kamilla...

34
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,683
while the real one's trapped somewhere?

35
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:22,685
Eva said they're safe for now.

36
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:24,479
And you're taking her word for it?

37
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:28,650
- For all we know, they're dead already...
- They're not.

38
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,294
So just...
You don't even think about that.

39
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:32,403
We have to think about that.

40
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:37,367
What if creating Kamilla's duplicate
actually killed the real Kamilla?

41
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,869
Same thing with Singh,
same thing with Iris.

42
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:43,206
- Hello?
- What do you want me to say?

43
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:45,542
Anything! That we have a plan,
that we'll get them back.

44
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,086
I don't have a plan, Cisco!

45
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,688
Eva can move anywhere, through any
mirror in the universe

46
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,005
in the blink of an eye.

47
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:54,342
She's faster than I am,
and somehow I'm supposed to stop her?

48
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:57,679
And still hope to God that Iris and
everybody else is still alive in a world

49
00:02:57,762 --> 00:02:59,073
that we don't even understand!
[banging table]

50
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:00,765
[Cecile] Hey! Hey.

51
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:03,393
You're both right, okay?
You're both right.

52
00:03:03,977 --> 00:03:05,937
But we cannot fall apart.

53
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,523
We need to work the problem,
not tear each other down.

54
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:11,025
So here's what I'm gonna do.
I am gonna call David's husband,

55
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:13,361
and I'm gonna see
if he has seen Singh's duplicate.

56
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:15,405
I'll check the Bentley Building.

57
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:17,866
Mirror-Iris and Kamilla
were alone there a lot.

58
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:19,260
Maybe they left something behind.

59
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:20,451
You want company?

60
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:22,215
Maybe you should find
something else to do.

61
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,181
[Dibny] Look, you can come with me.

62
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:27,125
I'm gonna see if I can dig up any
details on this Eva McCulloch.

63
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:35,049
If the Mirrorverse
is just another dimension,

64
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:37,218
there might be a way
to enter vibrationally.

65
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:40,430
Caitlin's still on the mend,
so I can't ask her for help.

66
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:44,392
I guess that means
I'm doing this one on my own.

67
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:50,273
Barry, look,
I understand how you're feeling.

68
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:52,567
Cecile, I know you're trying to help me.

69
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:55,445
I appreciate it, but...

70
00:03:56,112 --> 00:03:58,823
right now, I'm gonna work
on the Artificial Speed Force, I just...

71
00:03:58,907 --> 00:04:01,284
There's no point in finding Eva
if I'm useless against her.

72
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,958
[Iris West] I read Eva's secret files,

73
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:13,046
and now I know that
there's a mirror version of Kamilla,

74
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:16,341
which means that the real Kamilla
must be in here somewhere.

75
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:19,510
[sighs] I have to find her.

76
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:23,681
I can't think straight.

77
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:27,310
Eva calls it "neural dissonance,"

78
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:31,814
the way that your mind changes here.

79
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:35,360
I'm leaving this here
for you in case you find it.

80
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:37,028
But don't find me.

81
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:41,491
Barry... [sobs]

82
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,788
no matter what worlds
try to keep us apart...

83
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:50,375
I will always be with you.

84
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:56,005
[taps keyboard]

85
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,299
[electronic chirp]

86
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:07,934
[Allegra] How dumb am I, huh?

87
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:11,479
Yeah, that feeling's going around.

88
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:15,274
I've been working side-by-side
with duplicates this whole time.

89
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:17,318
Some budding reporter I am.

90
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:20,697
Wait, does that mean
I'm in charge of <i>The Citizen?</i>

91
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,198
How the hell am I supposed to...

92
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:23,281
[whooshing]

93
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:32,542
[grunting]

94
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:37,046
[Barry groans]

95
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:38,840
Godspeed.

96
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:40,883
[Godspeed] You're the one
who stopped the others.

97
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:42,427
I'm not impressed.

98
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:45,430
What do you want?

99
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:52,477
[Nash] Thank you.

100
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,648
I was looking for a reason
to test out this Pulse Cannon.

101
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:57,437
[Godspeed] This isn't over.

102
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:18,755
Didn't you say all four Godspeeds
were locked up at Iron Heights?

103
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:21,299
Those are just cybernetic drones
with modem-speak.

104
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:23,176
This one was talking. And, by the way,

105
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:25,928
do you not happen to have
protective protocols for this place?

106
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:27,180
Do not put this on me.

107
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:30,641
I'm trying to figure out a way into the
Mirrorverse. What were you doing?

108
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:32,268
I was saving our speedster.

109
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:33,662
Oh, good for you. You did something.

110
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:34,913
Thank you. Could I have a parade?

111
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,415
You don't seem to be doing
anything else.

112
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,959
- What? What?
- Stop. Just give it a...

113
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:39,816
[Dibny sighs]

114
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,569
What are you thinking?

115
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:43,196
Uh...

116
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:49,243
Cisco, you're the schmiencey guy.

117
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:51,037
Must have some kind of a plan, right?

118
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:55,625
Cisco, you still...
You still with us, bud?

119
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,294
Ralph, please, I'm trying to
get our friends back right now.

120
00:07:02,048 --> 00:07:03,883
[sighs] Okay. Okay.

121
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:06,385
Allegra, you said...

122
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:10,098
Godspeed's lightning
caused some sort of blast.

123
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:13,684
Yeah, he was like a friggin'
lightning storm in the room.

124
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:15,978
But it was his thunder
that did the damage.

125
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:17,939
Not thunder.

126
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:19,524
Vibrations.

127
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,442
Makes sense.

128
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:23,736
You go fast enough,
you create a sonic boom,

129
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:27,698
velocity transmutes
into vibrations in the air.

130
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:30,576
Only this Godspeed figured out a way...

131
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:34,580
to reverse those vibrations,

132
00:07:34,664 --> 00:07:37,708
and use them to
extract speed from a speedster.

133
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:41,003
Okay, so he's power hungry.
How do we stop him?

134
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:45,299
Well, we'd need a really, really deep
understanding of vibrational sonics.

135
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:46,759
Great. Do we have that?

136
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:48,344
Not really. No.

137
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:49,887
I know who could help us.

138
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:52,849
Hartley.

139
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:54,392
Hartley Rathaway.

140
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:57,145
Who's Hartley Rathaway?

141
00:07:57,228 --> 00:08:00,857
He is an expert in psychoacoustics
and sonic vibrations.

142
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,735
He used to work for S.T.A.R. Labs.
Also, a jerk who hates us so much

143
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:07,155
he tried to julienne your insides.

144
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:09,740
It turns out that he hates the Flash
even more post-Crisis,

145
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:11,742
only we don't really know why.

146
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:13,494
Correction. I know why.

147
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:15,830
My Crisis research
dug up the answer to that.

148
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:22,795
[woman screaming]

149
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:29,177
Henchmen?
No, it was only me and Hartley.

150
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,803
Not in this timeline.

151
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,641
<i>The Pied Piper's Band of Merry Men</i>

distracted playing Musical Cars.</i>

153
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:42,940
<i>Yeah, you clocked them, but when
one of them tried to shoot at you,</i>

154
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,483
<i>you countered with a lightning bolt.</i>

155
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:48,738
<i>That lightning collided
with the weapon's blast, and...</i>

156
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,118
Turns out, that was
Hartley's right-hand man,

157
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:56,204
Roderick Smith.

00:08:58,456 --> 00:09:01,125
It's Frost. Sorry, guys, I gotta...

160
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:02,460
I gotta check on this.

161
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,045
Roderick Smith is being held

162
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:06,214
in an energy-containment unit
in Mercury Labs.

163
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:07,673
Apparently, it's the only thing

164
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:10,218
that's keeping him
from completely disintegrating.

165
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:12,386
I guess that's a no
to Pied Piper's help.

166
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,971
Well, he did almost kill us, so...

167
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:17,350
Let's not bicker over who killed who.
We can fix this.

168
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:20,186
Just make his right-hand man
right again,

169
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:21,538
this Roderick fellow, and then maybe

170
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,282
Hartley will agree
to a little quid pro quo.

171
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,317
I have a theory.

172
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:34,116
I got your text. Are you okay?
Is the wound getting worse?

173
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,910
Ralph, I'm fine.

174
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:38,913
As fine as anyone with
a chronic light bullet avulsion

175
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,414
can be in their chest.

176
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,293
This patch is keeping me stable for now.

177
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:45,711
Then, what's the emergency?

178
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:46,795
Payback.

179
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:50,258
I just wanted to say thank you...

180
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:53,177
for everything you've done
for me this year. For...

181
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:56,264
taking me to an art show, and...

182
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:59,433
teaching me to how to get in touch
with emotions I didn't even know I had.

183
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:01,686
Hey. That's what life coaches are for.

184
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,896
Well, I know
I've still got a long way to go,

185
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,817
but I'm leaving soon,
so we might not be able to finish this.

186
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,528
You getting better
is our number-one priority.

187
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:13,322
And your mom is
the expert on all things ice,

188
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:15,449
so she'll patch up that wound
of yours, and then...

189
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,034
we can pick up where we left off.

190
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:20,121
- I could be gone for a long time.
- Okay.

191
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:24,959
But you are coming back, right?

192
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,044
Look, Ralph, forget it. I just...

193
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,463
I wanted to say goodbye
to an old friend.

194
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:33,551
Look...

195
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:36,137
friends say, "So long," or,

196
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,265
"Until we meet again." They...
They don't really say goodbye.

197
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:43,436
So, why don't you just tell me
what's really bothering you?

198
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,605
I'm fine. Just stop trying to
smell a mystery or whatever.

199
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:49,358
Too late. The Tannhauser tech...

200
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,945
it's the only stuff
that can fix you, but...

201
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,257
you don't really wanna go, do you?

202
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:56,824
Just drop it.

203
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,744
It's not the tech, is it?

204
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:01,662
It's the person behind it.

205
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,750
Frost, why don't you wanna see Carla?

206
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:09,337
Because she's not my mom, okay?
She's Caity's.

207
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,963
- You don't really mean that.
- Yeah.

208
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:12,047
I do.

209
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:14,258
Carla doesn't know me.

210
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:17,261
After all these years,
it's just been her and Caity.

211
00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:19,013
Hey...

212
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,264
you're her daughter, too.

213
00:11:20,348 --> 00:11:23,809
I'm the cold, dark part of
her daughter that she tolerates.

214
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:25,227
If that were even true...

215
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,190
why would I be sitting here,
worried about you?

216
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,691
'Cause you're a good guy, Ralph.

217
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:33,956
And you're an equal member
of Team Flash...

218
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,364
just like Caitlin.

219
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:39,575
And you are just as important.

220
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:44,163
And if you can't see that
for yourself...

221
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:50,044
then maybe you're right.

222
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:53,589
Maybe you do have a long way to go.

223
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:12,108
[Hartley] Hello, Flash.

224
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:16,612
[grunting]

225
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,490
I heard you coming from a mile away.

226
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,075
Hartley...

227
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,202
I know what happened now,

228
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:24,495
and I'm sorry.

229
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:26,580
[The Flash panting]

230
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:28,249
Something wrong with your speed?

231
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:29,332
Look...

232
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:32,086
I'm trying to make things
right with you.

233
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,169
Now you're sorry?

234
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:35,381
I think I can help Roderick.

235
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,600
What do you know about Roderick?

236
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:48,352
I know his condition's my fault.

237
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:51,480
But I think I can fix it,
if you'll give me the chance.

238
00:12:51,564 --> 00:12:52,606
And?

239
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,109
And, if you're willing,
I could use your help.

240
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:57,528
- There's a new speedster...
- Hmm. Here we go.

241
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,405
He's a threat
to the whole city, Hartley.

242
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:00,948
He's using sound waves.

243
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,868
You're the only person
we know that can stop him.

244
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,119
- Lives...
- I don't care.

245
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:06,996
I swear,

246
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:09,206
- I wanna help Roderick.
- Well, you can't.

247
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,418
- Let me try.
- I said you can't help him.

248
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:13,627
Don't you get it?

249
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
No one can.

250
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,131
[groaning]

251
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,551
[Hartley] <i>I thought I could stabilize
his molecules with my sonics, but...</i>

252
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:23,554
[screaming]

253
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,056
[yelling]

254
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:31,770
I wasn't strong enough.

255
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,230
So you sent him to Mercury Labs.

256
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:36,066
We think we can help him.

257
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:38,569
Let us show you.

258
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,863
Who is this "we," and "us"?

259
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,243
Harrison Wells?

260
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,955
Nash Wells, actually.

261
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,457
Harrison Wells was my doppelganger.

262
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,792
Your doppelganger?

263
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,127
[Nash] How to explain... Okay,

264
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:57,838
so there was this big event.
We called it Crisis...

265
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:59,882
- He's his twin.
- He's my twin.

266
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:02,426
Huh. Twice blessed.

267
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,931
We think that there may actually
be a way to help Roderick.

268
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,308
I've seen this kind of
molecular disembodiment before.

269
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,391
All right, bear with me.

270
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:13,479
I think if we combine
concentrated light energy

271
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:16,857
with an inert gas
with a high thermal conductivity,

272
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:19,151
it may actually slow down...

273
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,404
Roderick's molecules,
and give him his body back.

274
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:24,740
So basically combine light with helium.

275
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:28,244
I'm the smartest guy
in the room, I get it.

276
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,829
[sighs] Fine.

277
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:32,706
You fix Roderick...

278
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,376
then maybe I'll help you.

279
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,975
Kamilla?

280
00:14:52,977 --> 00:14:53,977
Wait, what are you doing?

281
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,520
- It's me, Iris.
- You're the one who sent me here.

282
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:58,857
No! Whoever she was,
that was not me, I swear.

283
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,647
Then tell me something
only the real Iris would know.

284
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:06,198
Cisco is the love of your life.

285
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:07,616
Uh...

286
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:10,744
And you knew it
from the moment you met him,

287
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,832
when you were bartending
at the Liquid Kitty.

288
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,461
He is the most brilliant man
that you know,

289
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:22,756
and he always makes you laugh.

290
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:30,889
You are the only person allowed to wear
his Chewbacca t-shirt.

291
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,726
The one that his parents gave him
when he was 14 years old.

292
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:35,018
[sighs]

293
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:36,437
It's you.

294
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:41,191
Thank God. After you or...

295
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:43,253
whoever looked like you
shot me with that Mirror Gun,

296
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:44,903
I just woke up here totally alone.

297
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:46,614
You never saw Eva?

298
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:49,617
Eva McCulloch, Carver's wife.

299
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,993
She's alive?

300
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:52,828
She's here?

301
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:54,413
She's the meta behind all of this,

302
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,624
and now she's escaped into our world.

303
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,626
Then we have to get back.

304
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,296
I gathered all the items
that the Mirror Gun sent here.

305
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:03,732
I've been analyzing them for clues,

306
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:06,967
but the data keeps getting all wonky
when I try to see the screen.

307
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,889
- [breathing heavily]
- Hey, you okay?

308
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,933
No. No, I'm not.

309
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:18,687
But you are.

310
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:22,816
The neural dissonance
hasn't affected you yet.

311
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,111
It's this condition that affects
our minds in this Mirrorverse.

312
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:28,113
That explains the screens.

313
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:30,008
When I look at them too long,
I get a headache.

314
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,492
Yeah, that's how it started for me.

315
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:35,412
With Eva's computers,
everything was broken and fractured,

316
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:37,623
but now I can read them.

317
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:39,666
[Kamilla echoing] You can help us
get out of here.

318
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,919
Uh, you know, I can't.

319
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:45,214
Shh. It hurts. The truth hurts.

320
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:47,883
We shouldn't be here.
We should not be here.

321
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,426
I should not be here.

322
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,101
Not much has changed.

323
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,229
Ugh. S.T.A.R. Labs,

324
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:03,315
still keeping mediocre engineers
around, I see.

325
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,751
Do we have to work with this douchebag?

326
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:08,112
Look, I've heard that you two
hate each other, but let's just focus.

327
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:14,576
A few months ago, I theorized
there might be a mechanical way

328
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,704
to open a breach
to an alternate dimension.

329
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:19,915
Looks like an engine for
focusing subatomic vibrations,

330
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,583
or, as you would say, "vibes."

331
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,837
Oh, please, I figured that out ages ago.

332
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,631
The hair? Dead giveaway, Ramon.

333
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:29,883
You too, Flash.

334
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,636
It was only three facilities
in the state

335
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,013
that could build a suit
with that much bleeding-edge tech.

336
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:38,517
But only one of them had
someone brilliant enough to build it.

337
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,269
- Thanks.
- Harrison Wells.

338
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:42,032
- There it is.
- [Hartley] What I don't get

339
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:44,982
is why you need a machine,
when you could just use your damn vibes.

340
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,402
Unless... you can't vibe anymore.

341
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,113
Ooh, ouch.

342
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,031
You lost your meta mojo.

343
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:56,410
Well, you could try
being a barista, maybe.

344
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:58,370
I gave up my powers by choice.

345
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:03,417
You know, I'm making this so that
I can save the person I love the most.

346
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:07,588
But I wouldn't expect you
to understand that, Hartley.

347
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,216
The person you love the most
is yourself.

348
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:15,702
- Come find me when you're ready to work.
- [phone vibrating]

349
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,767
Cecile just got Roderick back
from Mercury Labs. He's here.

350
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:29,961
[Nash] Here's what I need from you.

351
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:33,447
I need you to direct a concentrated
UV blast into the reception conduit.

352
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,824
Now, this containment unit,
I am going to release

353
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:38,243
helium into it,
and when those two things collide,

354
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:41,830
pop, it should lock Roderick's molecules
back into human form.

355
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:44,333
You ready? We'll go on three.

356
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,629
One, two...

357
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:51,298
- three.
- [gas hisses]

358
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,517
It's working.

359
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,691
[groans]

360
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,902
No, no, wait. Stop.

361
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:14,363
Wells, enough.

362
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:15,989
[screaming]

363
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:18,242
- Stop! You're hurting him!
- Nash.

364
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,535
[gas hisses]

365
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:31,129
Hartley, I'm sorry. But we can try...

366
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:32,965
I was stupid for trusting you.

367
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:35,926
Don't ask me for anything, ever.

368
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:40,180
My world is over. I hope yours burns.

369
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:49,648
[Godspeed] Give me your velocity,
or your city pays.

370
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:50,816
You have one hour.

371
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,736
You're not fast enough to stop me.
None of you are.

372
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,741
Death will rain down on your city,
Flash, unless you give me what I want.

373
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,827
Choose wisely.

374
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,290
[panting]

375
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:23,432
I don't think these equations
are gonna help fix Roderick that much,

376
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:25,976
plus, we simply need
a better bonding agent.

377
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:29,479
You do that. I'm working
on the artificial Speed Force right now.

378
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,358
[sighs]

379
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,986
Nash! Hey, Nash, what the hell?

380
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,905
I've been working on these all day.

381
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,823
You're wasting time, why?

382
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,120
You don't have to tell me,
we don't know each other.

383
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:50,792
You'd talk to Joe and Iris...
but they're not here.

384
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,669
Whose fault is that?

385
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:55,172
- Whose fault is that?
- Mine! All right?

386
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:57,841
Is that what you want me to say?

387
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:05,307
I'm supposed to lead this team.

388
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:09,269
Now, I don't even know
what to tell them.

389
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:11,563
When I lost Maya...

390
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,709
Every day since then, I wanted to say,

391
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,485
"Hey, listen, I'm sorry.
It was my fault."

392
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:18,694
But she's gone.

393
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:23,784
When I was Pariah, and I watched
my mistake burn down the multi-verse,

394
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:27,329
I wanted to tell those people I'm sorry,
but they were gone, and it was over.

395
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:33,043
And this is not over for you!
You can find your way out of this.

396
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:38,090
All you have to do is trust yourself.

397
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:41,343
How am I supposed to do that? I just
lived with an impostor for five weeks.

398
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,638
Forgive yourself.

399
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:47,431
You showed me that.

400
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:51,186
Now it's time for you to do it for you.

401
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:57,359
And you know what, if you can't,
do it for Iris.

402
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:00,195
I just miss her so much.

403
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:03,115
Without her here, it feels like...

404
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,210
I know why Hartley's world is over.

405
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,632
Thank you, Nash.

406
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:34,730
[sighs]

407
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:36,273
Whoa. Whoa, hey.

408
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:41,153
Look, I know you're hurting. I do.

409
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:46,491
But... I was with Kamilla
when Bloodwork's monsters attacked.

410
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:50,454
And you gotta trust me
that no matter where she is,

411
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:52,581
your girl knows
how to take care of herself.

412
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,667
Yeah. Yeah, I know, I know.

413
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:57,835
It's just...

414
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:00,588
[sighs]

415
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:04,176
When Kamilla's around,
I want to show her I'm strong.

416
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:08,180
I want to believe
I'm making the right decisions.

417
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:11,308
She gives me the confidence I need,
but she's...

418
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:14,186
[sighs]

419
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,606
She's not here.

420
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:22,903
And all I can think about
is the hero I used to be.

421
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:30,869
He was just full of life, and he wasn't
afraid to do the impossible. He was...

422
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:37,751
He was Vibe, you know?

423
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:40,003
He had all the answers.

424
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:42,464
Sometimes, he was the answer.

425
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:48,970
If Kamilla is not here,
and Vibe is gone...

426
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:52,641
What if...

427
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,768
What if you don't have all the answers,

428
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:58,313
and you're making the wrong decisions?

429
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,191
Cisco,

430
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,944
Kamilla did not fall in love
with your powers.

431
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:07,572
She fell in love with you.

432
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:13,453
You and that big,
beautiful brain of yours.

433
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:16,790
Boo-hoo, Cisco Ramon isn't Vibe anymore.

434
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:18,917
You know what he is?

435
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:22,003
He is a damn brilliant engineer

436
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:25,340
who has never backed down
from doing the impossible before.

437
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:32,264
You gonna start now?

438
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,143
No, ma'am.

439
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:51,867
You okay?

440
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:00,500
[Iris West] I let Eva
manipulate me all this time...

441
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,961
and now the neural dissonance
is getting worse.

442
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,214
How did I let that happen?

443
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:09,885
My skill as a reporter is
being able to see the truth,

444
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:13,680
but Eva proved to me
that I can't trust my instincts...

445
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:16,141
or myself.

446
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,977
You weren't the only one she tricked.

447
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,439
Your duplicate tricked me,
everyone, even Barry.

448
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:25,358
Don't beat yourself up
for not being perfect.

449
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:29,237
Of course, Eva would want you
to see your strength as a weakness.

450
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:31,323
That's how she's kept you trapped.

451
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:35,702
But if you want to escape,
you have to trust yourself again.

452
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,080
I do.

453
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:45,337
So, where do we start?

454
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:50,133
There is one other duplicate
that Eva created, Chief Singh.

455
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:52,468
We should find him.

456
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:56,723
If we're gonna go home,
we're all going home, together.

457
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:03,188
[sniffling]

458
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:05,398
[Hartley] Get out!

459
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:08,735
- I know why you're so upset.
- You don't know anything about me.

460
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:15,158
I know what it's like to be responsible
for losing the person I love.

461
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:21,289
Roderick, he's not just another
hired gun, is he?

462
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:24,459
He's my boyfriend.

463
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:27,879
[sniffles] The love of my life.

464
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,592
I put him in the line of fire
when I fought you,

465
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,303
meaning that what happened to him
is my fault.

466
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:36,832
You're not the only one to blame.

467
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:38,741
I threw the lightning, remember?

468
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,976
I gave him the weapon
that made you defend yourself.

469
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:43,228
[sighs]

470
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:45,063
And then, when I couldn't help him...

471
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,732
You got him the help he needed.

472
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:50,735
He was better off at Mercury Labs
than with me.

473
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:54,614
I was useless.

474
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:56,323
[sighs]

475
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:02,122
Someone just reminded me that...

476
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:06,459
we're no good
to the people that we love if...

477
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:09,045
we can't find the strength
to move forward,

478
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:10,797
and forgive ourselves.

479
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:15,010
Thanks, Oprah.

480
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,710
[Cisco on PA] <i>Hey, we got
a big problem at Iron Heights.</i>

481
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:21,891
You can stay here,

482
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,550
or you can be the person
that Roderick fell in love with.

483
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:29,316
It's your call.

484
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:37,407
[sighs]

485
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:40,659
- Hey.
- [rapid beeping]

486
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,330
Satellites just picked up
a massive energy surge in the Meta-Wing.

487
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:47,125
- [alarm blaring]
- [electricity crackling]

488
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,337
[Barry] It's gone.

489
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:52,297
Get a video feed.
What happened in there?

490
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:53,715
I'm trying.

491
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,843
[Barry] Oh, crap.

492
00:27:56,926 --> 00:28:00,472
Every Godspeed we caught till now,
he took all their speed.

493
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:16,196
Record this. You have one minute, Flash.

494
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:20,617
<i>After that, someone dies every 60
seconds until you surrender what's mine.</i>

495
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:23,787
I have to stop him.

496
00:28:23,788 --> 00:28:25,164
- Wait, wait. Barry.
- What?

497
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:29,501
Look, I know you want to do this,
but you don't have a lot of speed, okay?

498
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:32,337
We need to call C.C.P.D.
or A.R.G.U.S., anyone who...

499
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,256
Godspeed is my responsibility.
I have to face him.

500
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,759
- Barry...
- I have enough speed left to do this.

501
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:39,344
Even if I don't, I have to try.

502
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:43,306
[Barry] <i>I have to try.</i>

503
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,101
[Godspeed]
<i>Someone dies every 60 seconds</i>

504
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:48,728
<i>- until you surrender what's mine.</i>
- [Cisco]...<i>a lot of speed.</i>

505
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:51,052
[Barry]...<i>speed is my responsibility.
I have to face him.</i>

506
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:54,025
<i>I have to try.
I have enough speed left to do this.</i>

507
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:55,294
- [Godspeed] <i>Someone dies...</i>
- [Barry] <i>I have to try.</i>

508
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:58,321
- [Godspeed] <i>Someone dies...</i>
- [Barry] <i>Even if I don't, I have to try.</i>

509
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:01,157
<i>I have to try. I have to try.</i>

510
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:04,786
[Godspeed]
Time's up, Flash.

511
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:10,083
Have you come to give me what's mine?

512
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,246
You have to catch me first.

513
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:20,718
He's running at Mach Five.
He's moving faster than you.

514
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:22,387
But I know this city better than him.

515
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:51,498
Barry!

516
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,125
[grunting]

517
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:57,129
[Godspeed] You're pathetic.

518
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,966
You don't deserve the speed
you were given. We do.

519
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,186
I didn't think you were coming.

520
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,836
I didn't save you so we could chat.

521
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:39,547
[Godspeed] That's your backup?
It won't help.

522
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:41,966
Hartley, I can't stop Godspeed,
he's too powerful.

523
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,093
God, how thick are you?

524
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:46,030
Roderick got hurt
when the lightning you threw collided

525
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:48,014
with the vibrational force
of his weapon.

526
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:50,016
The result was a thermogenic blast

527
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:52,519
capable of rendering him unstable
at a molecular level.

528
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:55,939
- Just duplicate that force...
- And Godspeed's toast.

529
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:56,940
Bingo-bango.

530
00:30:56,942 --> 00:30:57,942
[Godspeed] Flash!

531
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:02,612
Now you'll feel
the real power of speed.

532
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:04,364
[thunder rumbling]

533
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:10,661
You ready?

534
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,121
Let's do it.

535
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:13,622
[gauntlet clicking, beeping]

536
00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:14,623
[computer beeping]

537
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:16,834
Where is he going?
Barry, you're going the wrong way.

538
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:18,044
Wait for it.

539
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:29,304
Now, Flash!

540
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:43,528
- They crossed streams!
- They crossed streams!

541
00:31:56,791 --> 00:32:00,211
- Hartley, thanks for coming after me.
- Yeah, don't mention it.

542
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:02,255
You won another battle
against some speed-freak,

543
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:03,840
and I lost everything.

544
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:06,259
I promise we'll figure something out.

545
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:11,389
[Hartley] Okay,
haven't seen that one before.

546
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:14,017
[The Flash] Is that Godspeed's blood?

547
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:19,897
[Cisco] Satellite readings
indicate it could be

548
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:23,484
some kind of biogenic
electrolyte secretion.

549
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:27,071
- It's charged sound.
- It's charged sound.

550
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:30,074
[Nash] <i>Oh, boys...</i>

551
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:32,910
I do believe
we found the solution we're looking for.

552
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:46,757
[Barry] How does it work?

553
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:51,137
Normal sound waves need to have
a transmission medium to move through,

554
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,847
but charged sound builds its own.

555
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:56,392
[Nash] Normal sound can temporarily
reattach molecular bonds.

556
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:58,269
A charged sound can
permanently attach them.

557
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:01,648
It's like a permanent bonding agent.

558
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,486
Hartley, this will stabilize Roderick.

559
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:10,031
If you hurt him, I'll hurt you.

560
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:14,160
- Ready?
- Ready.

561
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:26,339
[exhales]

562
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:29,592
- Hartley. Hartley.
- I'm here.

563
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:31,968
[chuckles]

564
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,888
I thought I'd lost you.

565
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:36,950
Come on. You know I'm a little harder
to get rid of than that.

566
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:37,974
[chuckling]

567
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:42,897
So... what happened?

568
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:48,569
Last thing I remember,
we were at the dam, and the Flash, he...

569
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:51,239
He helped bring you back.

570
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:55,201
We'll give you guys some space.

571
00:34:03,543 --> 00:34:07,797
I'm glad we reunited the happy couple,
but I have to say, I am super relieved

572
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,632
to finally get rid of Godspeed.

573
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:11,342
And this one talks, so now we know

574
00:34:11,426 --> 00:34:13,026
we got the real
August Heart behind bars.

575
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:15,054
That's not the real Godspeed.

576
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:18,474
Once he was placed
in a meta-dampening cell,

577
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:20,685
I questioned him as the Flash, and...

578
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:23,146
all he could say was,

579
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:26,023
"The one who sent me
wants infinite velocity."

580
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:31,487
When you were fighting Godspeed,
he said, "We deserve your speed."

581
00:34:31,571 --> 00:34:35,199
- Who's "we"?
- Does "we" include the one who sent him?

582
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:37,785
- He couldn't tell me.
- Because he stopped talking.

583
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:41,330
And started chirping
like a broken modem...

584
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:44,876
just like the rest of them.

585
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:49,756
[squelching]

586
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,760
So, I came to apologize.

587
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:58,139
So you broke in?
My front door is locked.

588
00:34:58,222 --> 00:35:00,933
I may have slipped under the doorframe.

589
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:05,646
Literally. So I guess I actually have
two things to apologize for.

590
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:07,272
Um...

591
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:10,359
Listen, I shouldn't have been so harsh.

592
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:14,155
It's okay. You were right.
I have a long way to go.

593
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:15,740
No, you don't.

594
00:35:18,576 --> 00:35:20,119
A "dib-ploma"?

595
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:22,413
Congratulations on graduating
Life Coach school.

596
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:24,778
- Ralph, this is ridiculous.
- You know what's ridiculous?

597
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:27,335
You thinking that
you're not as important as Caitlin.

598
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:31,798
And being intimidated by a parent?
That's normal.

599
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:41,474
Frost, I was ten when my dad walked out
on Mom and me.

600
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:44,852
You don't think a day goes by
where I'm not...

601
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:48,689
absolutely terrified that he's going to
show up at my front door?

602
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:51,984
- He walked out on you guys. He's a jerk.
- Yeah...

603
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:55,571
and a part of me still wants to see him.

604
00:35:57,573 --> 00:36:01,744
I guess I'm afraid Carla might actually
want to get to know me, and then...

605
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:06,874
- she'll see me for who I really am.
- And that is the ironic part to me.

606
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:11,379
'Cause, Frosty,
you are one awesome human being.

607
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:16,092
You were just afraid that Carla
was gonna reject you,

608
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:18,052
so you rejected her first.

609
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:23,182
Not anymore.

610
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:29,146
And that is why
you're ready to graduate.

611
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:33,484
Damn, I really am
one hell of a life coach.

612
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,611
Yeah, you are.

613
00:36:43,703 --> 00:36:46,080
I don't know how to thank you. I...

614
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,459
We lost everything
when we lost each other.

615
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:55,965
Even hope. Thank you for not giving up.

616
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:58,509
You gave us back us.

617
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:03,556
I owe you. We both do.

618
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:09,979
Good luck. Just, maybe stay out of
diamond stores for a while?

619
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,647
No promises.

620
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:15,109
- Will you give us a sec?
- Yeah.

621
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:21,824
Okay, look, you know I'm not exactly
the "let's hug it out" type,

622
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:23,910
so I'll just say this.

623
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:28,789
You gave me my world back.
You'll get your world back, too.

624
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:31,792
But you have to do more than
just forgive yourself.

625
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:33,716
You have to believe
that your world can change.

626
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,367
That's the part I had forgotten.

627
00:37:38,132 --> 00:37:40,301
Thanks for reminding me.

628
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:07,870
[sighs]

629
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:11,415
We've all lost so much this year.

630
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:13,209
Our power.

631
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:15,544
Our love.

632
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:18,422
Our family.

633
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,759
At times, it's even felt
like there's nothing left to lose.

634
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:26,514
Like everything that matters
has already been taken...

635
00:38:26,597 --> 00:38:31,644
and our lives are empty, hollow inside.

636
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:37,733
Some things can't be taken.

637
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:40,569
Look around this room.

638
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:45,449
We still have our faith in each other,

639
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:48,744
and our will to fight for those we love.

640
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,163
This is what we'll never lose.

641
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:58,254
Eva McCulloch has never faced us
head-on.

642
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,008
That's about to change.

643
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:07,596
We're gonna find her. Beat her...

644
00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:11,684
and get back everyone.

645
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:13,185
Amen to that.

646
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:15,146
You just tell me where to stretch.

647
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:16,313
And blast.

648
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:18,357
Sounds violent. I'm in.

649
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,120
I have an idea.

650
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:34,623
A way to get our people
out of the Mirrorverse.

651
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:39,712
We need a lossless, self-sustaining
source of perpetual energy.

652
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:43,966
Sounds like you're talking
about the holy grail of science.

653
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,053
- A perpetual motion machine.
- [Cisco] That's right.

654
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:48,554
Hartley had some ideas.

655
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:52,183
I actually think we can build one.

656
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:53,768
We're just missing one component,

657
00:39:53,851 --> 00:39:56,812
and thanks to my travels,
I know exactly where to find it.

658
00:39:58,147 --> 00:40:00,107
Atlantis.

659
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:02,777
Finally, Crisis pays off
in a good way for once.

660
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:07,531
I know time is crucial, but don't worry.
I'll hurry back.

661
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:08,741
Can I come?

662
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:11,264
[Barry] Actually, if you don't mind,
I'd like for you to stay.

663
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:13,704
Team Flash needs as many hands on deck
as possible.

664
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,378
Now let's get to work.

665
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:49,447
[inhales]

666
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:54,495
[exhales]

667
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:57,665
I'm coming for you, Joseph.
