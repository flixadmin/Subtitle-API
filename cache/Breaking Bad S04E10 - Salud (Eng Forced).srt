1
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,093
And when does Don Eladio arrive?

2
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,304
Let's see how the cook goes first.

3
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,473
Who's the chemist?

4
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,478
ls this a joke?

5
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,694
Okay, we've all met.

6
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,155
Let's get to work.

7
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,145
Please show him the phenylacetic acid.

8
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,522
We synthesize it ourselves.

9
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,816
All the ingredients are here.

10
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,370
What's the problem?

11
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,384
Mr. Pinkman was under the 
impression that the phenylacetic acid...

12
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,096
...would already be synthesized upon his arrival.

13
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,516
Any sophomore chemistry student can make it.

14
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,853
What kind of amateur have you brought us?

15
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,482
This is ridiculous.

16
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,442
l'm not letting some infant...

17
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,487
...who can't even synthesize phenylacetic acid...

18
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,239
...teach me my business.

19
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,878
Clean up!

20
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,772
l'm so happy...

21
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,234
...you finally came to your senses.

22
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,077
May l present the cook.

23
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,007
Hello, young man.

24
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:23,806
He doesn't speak a word of Spanish, does he?

25
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:25,850
And he's no chemist...

26
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,518
...l'll tell you that.

27
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:32,982
l don't care if he's a pig farmer.

28
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,986
He cooks better meth than you do...

29
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:41,198
...with all your fancy college degrees.

30
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:45,911
And this one will have
plenty of time to learn Spanish.

31
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:55,254
What's in there?

32
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:57,172
A gift?

33
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:07,558
Gustavo, you're so generous.

34
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,894
lt's a token of respect.

35
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,479
ln honor of our renewed friendship.

36
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,075
Let's see what's in here.

37
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:32,917
No, impossible!

38
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:39,214
Zafiro Añejo!

39
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,091
Look at this.

40
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,803
Even the bottle is a work of art.

41
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,805
lt's perfection!

42
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:49,058
Perhaps...

43
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,336
...it's too good to share.

44
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:53,621
What do you think, Gustavo?

45
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,909
lt's yours to do with as you choose.

46
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,906
l choose...

47
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,908
...to drink it!

48
00:38:08,749 --> 00:38:09,749
Good!

49
00:38:11,574 --> 00:38:13,274
Hurry up, boys.

50
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,008
Careful.

51
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,260
That's beautiful stuff.

52
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,096
lf you spill a drop...

53
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,473
...l'll cut off your hand.

54
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,726
Come on, hurry up.

55
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,999
This one's an addict.

56
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,584
To work, he must be sober.

57
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:01,171
None for you!

58
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,247
Enough business!

59
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,666
Bring the girls!

60
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:36,391
Cheer up, man.

61
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,270
...l'm not angry.

62
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,357
l had to spank you.

63
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:46,527
But what choice did l have?

64
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:50,739
Look, once every 20 years...

65
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,242
...you forget your place.

66
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:03,085
There's no place for emotion in this.

67
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:07,214
You of all people should understand.

68
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:11,135
Business is business.

69
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,805
lf you'll excuse me.

70
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,181
Where are you going?

71
00:41:16,206 --> 00:41:17,456
To use your bathroom.

72
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,601
lf l may.

73
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:28,360
Show Gustavo the pisser.

74
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,446
And make sure he doesn't get lost.

75
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,873
Hurry up.

76
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:41,053
Don Eladio is dead!

77
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:44,014
His capos are dead!

78
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:49,227
You have no one left to fight for!

79
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:52,105
Fill your pockets...

80
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:54,107
...and leave in peace!

81
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:57,861
Or fight me...

82
00:44:58,071 --> 00:44:59,613
...and die!
