1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,680
Only a weapon from hell
can eliminate a hell-spawned Encore.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,760
We could use those.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,200
Yeah, let's just get them
and get out of here.

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,200
<i>The Loom of Fate
is one of the most powerful tools</i>

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,280
<i>in existence.</i>

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,160
<i>It gave my sisters and me control
over everyone's lives.</i>

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,360
None of this is how it should be.

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,840
Screw the Fates,
stop being so obedient.

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,400
They're free.

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,200
Then I can't help them anymore.

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,680
- Stop it.
- We will rule.

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,560
But even I like the Blue Mush.

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,600
Bollocks.

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,560
<i>The Fates are always watching.</i>

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,080
<i>The world is perfect.</i>

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,280
What kept you, sister?

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,720
Oh, you know,
running a TV empire is not as easy

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,360
as snipping threads, sister.

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,040
I was skeptical when you pitched
the idea of the Legends on TV, but,

21
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,440
they've helped pacify the masses.

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,200
Well, should we get started then?

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,080
We don't want to
keep our worshippers waiting.

24
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,000
Any luck finding the Loom?

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,080
Yeah, I think we found it, all right.

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,360
Yeah, well,
our ride is still very much MIA.

27
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,360
<i>So don't destroy the Loom
until we find the ship.</i>

28
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,160
She has a weird voice, right?

29
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,080
You okay?

30
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,520
Acid reflux.

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,000
Too much Green Mush.

32
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,160
Ava better find that ship
because if we succeed,

33
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,480
then we're gonna have
three very angry Fates on our hands.

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,800
- Hey.
- God.

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,720
- You're all from the TV, right?
- Yes.

36
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,840
Can we get your autographs?

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,520
That depends.

38
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,640
How attached are you to your clothes?

39
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,200
Oh, my Fates.

40
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,400
It's the Legends.

41
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,280
Gary, Mona, you're okay.

42
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,760
It worked. You're out of the TV.

43
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,160
Okay, I've been dying to ask,
was I a Legend?

44
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,400
Or a lovable rogue,
or a Manic Pixie Dream Boy?

45
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,480
Time Dweeb.

46
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,320
Where is the Waverider<i>?</i>

47
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,640
Is that like the U.S.S. Faterider
on Star Trip?

48
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,960
Yeah, sure. Have you seen it?

49
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,400
No, but I bet
it's in the Forbidden Dump.

50
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,760
Well, that sounds ominous.

51
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,520
It's where we send
all the contraband items.

52
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,280
I know, because I work for the
Historical Sanitation Department.

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,360
Okay, great.

54
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,000
So, how would we infiltrate
this Forbidden Dump?

55
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,720
The Waverider better be here.

56
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,040
If we stay, we'll raise suspicion.

57
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,680
Good luck, teammates.

58
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,880
I don't get it, fuzzy dice,
waffle maker, massage chairs.

59
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,080
This is all like the good stuff.

60
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,960
Yeah, if you make life bleak enough,
people become so focused on survival

61
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,400
they forget they can revolt.

62
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,760
Start clicking, Mickey.

63
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,080
You're not allowed back here.

64
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,120
Yeah, for good reason. Now.

65
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,440
Oh, nice one, love.

66
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,960
Hope they have benefits.

67
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,680
Here.

68
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,680
{\an5}- What do you need me in there for?
- You'll see.

69
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,720
All right, keep your eyes out
for any more guards

70
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,920
and let's get rid of these two.

71
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,200
Okay, okay take that one,
I'll take this one.

72
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,200
I hope I have benefits.

73
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,800
What is your request?

74
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,480
More Blue Mush, please.

75
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,240
{\an5}We shall weave it
into the fabric of time

76
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,320
this afternoon.

77
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Thank you.

78
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
Thank you.

79
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,280
Speak, child.

80
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,680
Can you put my shows back on TV?

81
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,400
Well, they'll be back in a tick.

82
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,200
{\an5}The actors just need a bit of rest,
that's all.

83
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,280
Why?

84
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,840
Are they tired from the crossover?

85
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,400
What is a crossover?

86
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,880
The Legends are here.

87
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,840
{\an5}Clotho, I have let you play
your childish game long enough.

88
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,320
{\an5}It is time to grow up
and face the music.

89
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,880
The Legends are my friends.

90
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,400
Are they?

91
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,200
Time and again,
they have sown chaos into this world.

92
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,320
{\an5}Well, sometimes they screw things up
for the better.

93
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,880
{\an5}I mean, think about it, Encores,
that wasn't their fault.

94
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,440
And they've been mopping
that up all year.

95
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,760
That's true.

96
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,440
The Encores
are not the Legends' fault.

97
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,000
They're yours.

98
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,600
{\an5}Ambitious villains are the product
of the chaos you birthed.

99
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,760
Look at these people now.

100
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,320
{\an5}Do you see a future Joseph Stalin
amongst these lambs?

101
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Of the three of us,

102
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,160
{\an5}you always loved
these mortal creatures best.

103
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,720
What do you think they would want?

104
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,040
More choices...

105
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,640
or a lifetime of peace?

106
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,160
Peace.

107
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,960
Wise choice, sister.

108
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,320
I really wish
you could see this, love.

109
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,160
Well, I can feel it.

110
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,360
Well, it's beautiful.

111
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,520
Now, destroy it, once and for all.

112
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,240
All right. We found the Loom.

113
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,920
John's working on it as we speak.

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,040
<i>I'm standing guard,
any luck finding the ship?</i>

115
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,320
Yeah, we still haven't found it.

116
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,920
Mick, how do you know the batteries
in that thing even work?

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,080
For all we know, the Waverider,
could be anywhere in this mess.

118
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,040
Shut the front door.

119
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,240
- No.
- Do you hear that?

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,520
I helped you find the ship.

121
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,080
Now, I'm gonna find my kid.

122
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,400
Okay, Mick will be fine on his own.

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,600
A spell to destroy something
as powerful as this,

124
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,560
it requires
a considerable well of magic.

125
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,840
I played hooky at Hogwarts.

126
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,600
I learned magic the hard way, John,
in hell.

127
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,200
It's dangerous.

128
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,360
You're Natalie Logue's daughter,
aren't you?

129
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,160
Your mother,
she was a natural conduit for magic.

130
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,600
Her blood flows through your veins,
meaning that you're conduit as well.

131
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,600
Close your eyes and go with me,
all right?

132
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,680
Gideon, bring all systems online.

133
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
G, you there?

134
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,200
Guys, we have a problem.

135
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,320
There is no Gideon.

136
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,880
- Which means no flying.
- Damn it, Fates. Well played.

137
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,800
What would it take to get the ship
off the ground manually?

138
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,720
I mean, we need a superconductor
to transfer a huge surge of energy

139
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
to the time core.

140
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,880
We could look in the junkyard.

141
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,840
Or...

142
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,480
I have an idea.

143
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,320
You sure this is gonna work?

144
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,320
Honestly, I'm 60-40.

145
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,680
But I believe in you.

146
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,840
Sixty-forty?

147
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,240
And we haven't really caught up.

148
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,320
I don't know what you've been up to.

149
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,520
You spent a year in a Totem.

150
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,400
- I mean.
- Guys, can we just focus?

151
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,560
- I don't wanna do this.
- I know.

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,160
Steel up, now.

153
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,360
<i>All's quiet on our end.</i>

154
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,520
<i>What do you guys see?</i>

155
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,040
Sara, I've got eyes on Charlie Fate
and Hippie Mom Fate.

156
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,640
<i>No sign of Psycho Fate.</i>

157
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,200
Found her.

158
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,520
You bear the scars
from our last encounter.

159
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,640
My scars only make me stronger.

160
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,960
I need you to connect to your mother.

161
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,360
Think back
to the last time you saw her.

162
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,760
Feel your mother's power.

163
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,560
Let it flow through you.

164
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,960
(Foreign language)

165
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,880
(Foreign language)

166
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,480
<i>Oh, that's good.</i>

167
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,320
Now, harness your connection.

168
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,760
<i>Are you going to Scarborough Fair</i>

169
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,240
<i>Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme</i>

170
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,000
<i>Remember me</i>

171
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,360
<i>To one who lives there</i>

172
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Mom.

173
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,160
It's working.

174
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,240
Natalie's helping us drain
its energy.

175
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:04,400
<i>For once she was a true love of mine</i>

176
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,920
I love you, Mommy.

177
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,400
My sweet girl, your mother is gone.

178
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,040
- No, no.
- No, no, no.

179
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,760
Forget her or you will never be
the powerful woman I know you can be.

180
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
No, no.

181
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,080
Your power comes from me.

182
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,280
I alone am its master.

183
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,600
My power comes from my team.

184
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,640
John, open the door.

185
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,520
Behrad, now.

186
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,840
If my power comes from you,
then maybe I can do this.

187
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,600
Ava, where you at?

188
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,040
<i>Pulling up now.</i>

189
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,400
Clotho, what have you done?

190
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,000
Go, go. Let's move.

191
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,400
I don't think
we can hold this altitude.

192
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,520
Jump the ship.

193
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,000
Do it.

194
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,280
Wait, when are we?

195
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
I don't know.

196
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,480
It's hard to see
through all this trash.

197
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,560
It's not trash.

198
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,680
They're some of history's
most iconic mementos.

199
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,960
I don't care what it is.

200
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,320
All I care
is that I can see this face.

201
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,440
Oh, I think my powers are gone.

202
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,080
Yeah, well,
your powers were bestowed by a God.

203
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,840
Once that God kicked the bucket,
then bye-bye powers.

204
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,000
Everything's back to normal?

205
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,520
There's only one way to find out.

206
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,560
Gideon is down,
gotta do it the old fashioned way.

207
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,760
- All right.
- Sounds good.

208
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,520
- All right, let's go check it out.
- All right.

209
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,920
Okay, this feels like an improvement.

210
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,080
All right, this says we jumped
a few months, okay.

211
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,480
Well, gives the world some time
to get back on track.

212
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,040
Hey, Fate,
what's the best way to work today?

213
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
<i>The subway.</i>

214
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,520
Hey, Fate,
what should I have for lunch today?

215
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,520
<i>Two soups and a smoothie.</i>

216
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,400
Hey, Fate,
should I ask Renee to marry me?

217
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,520
Hey, Fate, what do I buy my brother
for his birthday?

218
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,360
What are the chances
that everyone's watches

219
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,320
got a weird update
over the last four months?

220
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,440
I'd say one in a monkey's ass, love.

221
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,400
<i>- Absolutely.</i>
- Great.

222
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,320
So, not only do Charlie
and her sister

223
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,680
have the Loom back, but,

224
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,240
now it's wearable.

225
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,400
Don't let choices
get in the way of your destiny.

226
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,560
Trust in Fate.

227
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,520
With Fatewatch,
your link to the Loom.

228
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,960
Always connected.

229
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,080
I get the Fates rebuilt the Loom.

230
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,720
But how'd they put it in a watch?

231
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,000
Well, that's why we're breaking
into the bloody temple.

232
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,200
Get some answers.

233
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,720
- What the hell? It's a...
- History museum.

234
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,040
Can't be all that bad.

235
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,520
Well, certainly an improvement
on the Loom Temple.

236
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,920
"Welcome to The History Museum.

237
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,240
Here you will learn the truth
about free will

238
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,200
and the atrocities
it has brought upon humankind."

239
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,560
Atrocities?

240
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,960
"Join us as we examine
the tragedies of choice

241
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,640
and the horrors of our past,
that we shall,

242
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,320
with benevolence and Fate,
never suffer again."

243
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,000
So they went from trashing history
to weaponizing it.

244
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,520
But why?

245
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,080
Well, if we want to know
what happened in the past,

246
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,880
we certainly came to the right place.

247
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,480
All right, first up,
the Hall of Bad Ideas.

248
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,920
Ray has that suit.

249
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,480
What the hell is a shake weight?

250
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,800
You don't want to know, babe.

251
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,200
Cigarettes? Oh, come on.

252
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,840
Bloody cheek of them.

253
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,480
John, you died of lung cancer.

254
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,400
- Come on, you know they're right.
- Yeah.

255
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
- Nice.
- Okay.

256
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,400
What's "The Thong Song"?

257
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,400
- Seriously?
- "She had dumps like a truck,

258
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,480
truck, truck.

259
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,440
Baby, move your butt, butt, butt."

260
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,080
I think I'll sing it again.

261
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,720
Man, screw the Fates.

262
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,560
That is a spring break classic.

263
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,800
As a matter of fact,
I'll play it for you.

264
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,880
I don't give a damn.

265
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,840
- I just...
- No, you won't, come on,

266
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,360
we have to go
to the Hall of Villains.

267
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,640
Later, Sisqó.

268
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,080
Okay, other Z.

269
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,840
I just rerouted the nav system.

270
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,320
Anything popping up yet?

271
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,320
No, nothing yet.

272
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,040
Hey, try patching
into the secondary hard drive.

273
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,400
Maybe we can pull something up
from the backup.

274
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,760
Backup, backup.

275
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,960
Zari, come on, run.

276
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
Behrad.

277
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,760
Hey, you okay?

278
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,600
I don't know it's...

279
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,440
There were these guys,
A.R.G.U.S. agents.

280
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,760
They had guns.

281
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,040
Huge guns.

282
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,880
I thought they were gonna shoot you.

283
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,760
I must have smoked something way off.

284
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,520
I thought you were Zari.

285
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,840
I, I am.

286
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,840
No, I mean, totally, I know.

287
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
It's just...

288
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,880
- It's weird.
- Yeah, I, I know.

289
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
Tell me about it.

290
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,640
I'm hanging out with myself.

291
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,360
A myself that has hots
for John Constantine.

292
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,800
- You caught that, too?
- Yeah.

293
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,800
It wasn't something you smoked.

294
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,920
It happened, you told me to run,
and I did.

295
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
You didn't.

296
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,680
And then I died.

297
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,760
Every day since then,

298
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,680
everything I've done
has been to save you.

299
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,840
Whoa, this is like, really uncanny.

300
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,840
Wait a second, are,
are these villains ranked?

301
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,520
I don't know,
who do you have over there?

302
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,360
I got Vlad the Impaler,
but he's number 14.

303
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,600
Hey, if he's number 14,
who's number one?

304
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,920
Hey, Mick. You're okay.

305
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What did you expect?

306
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,440
- You left me, us behind.
- Okay, calm down, please.

307
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,520
We were waiting for four months,
what took you so long?

308
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,240
Yeah, that's a question
for the other Zari.

309
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,800
Oh, book club lady.

310
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,880
What are you guys doing here?

311
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,000
Well, when you guys broke the Loom,
people panicked.

312
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,440
Suddenly, all these memories
came flooding back.

313
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,640
No one knew what was real.

314
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,120
Or what to do.

315
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,000
They were so used
to the Fates telling them.

316
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,840
So, Gary and Mona found me and Dad,
and we went into hiding.

317
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,120
- Hiding? Why?
- Because we're Legends.

318
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,880
- Yeah.
- And if you were listening

319
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,240
to what the Fates had to say,
we were...

320
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,480
"God Killers"?

321
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,960
I've been called worse.

322
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,880
Is it weird that I'm offended
that we're only number two?

323
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,600
Well, then who's number one?

324
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
Charlie.

325
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,760
No.

326
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
No, how, how did you...

327
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,880
You can't be here,
you have to leave right now.

328
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,360
What are you talking about, Charlie?

329
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,880
It's over. You have to come with us.

330
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,040
No, Fate says to stay.

331
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,840
Fate, Fate says...

332
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,200
She's gonna kill you
if she finds you.

333
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,600
You have to get out while you can.

334
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,920
Charlie, I'm sorry,
but you'll thank us later. John?

335
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,880
- (Foreign language)
- No.

336
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Charlie.

337
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,000
Hey, it's okay.

338
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,800
You're home, Charlie.

339
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
No.

340
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,320
No, no, no, I have to go back.

341
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,520
She's gonna know.

342
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,360
Where's my watch? I need it.

343
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,560
That's how the Loom
tells me what to do.

344
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,600
Why the hell do you listen
to that thing, Charlie?

345
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,280
Because I never should have destroyed
the Loom to begin with.

346
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,280
I mean, greed and war.

347
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,560
Human suffering?

348
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,520
All those Encores we were up against,
that's all on me.

349
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,520
I'm the Loom breaker.

350
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,240
- I'm the creator of chaos.
- Charlie.

351
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,800
That used to be
a badge of honor for you.

352
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,640
What happened?

353
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,760
We left. That's what happened.

354
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,760
You know, Charlie,
you were left all alone.

355
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,480
It's no wonder
Lachesis got into your head.

356
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,320
Lachesis, she's my family.

357
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,280
And family sticks together.

358
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,720
Hey, we are your family,
and we're here now, all right?

359
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,440
Charlie, what happened?

360
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,560
Lachesis rebuilt the Loom.

361
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,520
She saved everyone.

362
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,840
She restored the peace.

363
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,040
I replaced my own mother, John.

364
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,120
Well, summoning a ghost
can be difficult,

365
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,240
even under the best of circumstances.

366
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,560
No, I mean in hell.

367
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,040
I was terrified, helpless.

368
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,320
Lachesis found me, she took me in.

369
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,240
But the price for her protection
was my humanity.

370
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,760
She trained me to let go of anything
that made me feel.

371
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,600
And so I had to forget the person
I had loved the most.

372
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,040
You were just a kid.

373
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,320
Trying to survive is all.

374
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,960
But I wanted to forget.

375
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,920
I saw what happened
to good people down there,

376
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,240
and I swore that would never be me.

377
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,840
Listen to me, all right?

378
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,920
You are still her daughter.

379
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,400
Whose?

380
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,480
Natalie?

381
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,120
Or Lachesis?

382
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,360
Okay, I know you think free will
is a bad, scary thing.

383
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,440
So, we did a little dumpster diving
to give you some counterpoints.

384
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,880
Two words. The Beatles.

385
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,640
All right,
they taught an entire generation

386
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,440
that even during war and tragedy,
we can still make beauty.

387
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,280
Whilst also inspiring
Charles Manson to commit

388
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,440
some of the most brutal murders
in history.

389
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,240
Also, they let Ringo sing a song
about an octopus.

390
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,960
- Damn it, okay.
- Okay.

391
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,280
Just get out of the way.

392
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,960
<i>Mamma Mia 2,</i>
a celebration of free love,

393
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,040
reckless abandon
and following your bliss.

394
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,880
Even if that bliss means creating
a two-hour ABBA-palooza

395
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,880
where Cher plays Meryl Streep's mom.

396
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,680
Weren't the Legends almost murdered
by Napoleon because of ABBA?

397
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,080
Two words.

398
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,280
"Octopus's Garden."

399
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,280
Gary, no.

400
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,920
Would this have happened in a world
without free will?

401
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,800
I mean, seriously, Charlie, look,
I'm a clone,

402
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
- for God's sake.
- She's a clone.

403
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,360
You don't think it, anyway,

404
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,320
think about all the people
on this ship.

405
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,960
Think about how they came
to be together.

406
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,320
Yeah, Nate's crazy conspiracy theory.

407
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,280
Mick's turn
as a futuristic bounty hunter.

408
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,920
Zari and B's dystopian future.

409
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,240
You in that disco outfit.

410
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,680
Hey, come on, Charlie.

411
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,160
We were all in our own worlds,

412
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,000
but a twist in our stories
brought us together

413
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,240
and made us a family.

414
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,520
But humanity,
they've made so many mistakes.

415
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,960
Sometimes a mistake
is really just destiny.

416
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,920
What, you learn that being a Paragon?

417
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,160
No, I learned that being a person.

418
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,680
So, what do you think?

419
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,200
Can we track the Loom signal
with that thing?

420
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,480
Yeah, I just need
an external computer,

421
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,200
something with GPS and Wi-Fi.

422
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,760
Well, that's perfect.

423
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360
Hey.

424
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,040
We all make sacrifices
for the greater good.

425
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,240
Oh, really? How much THC is running
through your system right now?

426
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,720
I'm self-medicating
for my Loom anxiety.

427
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,480
You know,
the brain processes phone screens

428
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,600
and drugs the same way.

429
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,880
That's why they're both so addicting.

430
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,520
All right, the Loom's signal's coming
from somewhere inside the building.

431
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,840
Okay, okay.

432
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,760
Okay.

433
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,520
John, other me.

434
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,040
<i>We're gonna have to go
floor by floor.</i>

435
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,440
Well, it's a dodgy spot
for the Loom of Fate.

436
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,680
You know, I've hosted many
an exclusive party

437
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,800
in a place like this.

438
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,080
The antithetical
keeps the riffraff out.

439
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,080
Hiding in plain sight.
Bloody brilliant.

440
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:20,240
Also, you can do whatever you want
and no one needs to know.

441
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,160
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

442
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,320
Oh, God, this is weird.

443
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,520
All right, no windows, thick walls...

444
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,240
That's where I'd stash my artisanal,

445
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,240
- world altering apparatus.
- All right.

446
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,240
<i>Guys, I think we found it.</i>

447
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,880
I'm the worst.

448
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,800
Timing is impeccable.

449
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,680
Sara, we got to the Loom,
but there is no Loom.

450
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,760
Blimey.

451
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,360
Gideon.

452
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Gidget.

453
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,400
<i>Currently running Fate protocol.</i>

454
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,120
<i>I cannot be interrupted.</i>

455
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,000
She's controlling everyone
with Gideon.

456
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,720
The watches,
they're just running a program

457
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,920
telling everyone what to do.

458
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,840
Wait. So there, there is no Loom?

459
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,360
We actually destroyed it.

460
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,080
Yeah, all we have to do
is shut down the network.

461
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
What, and inspire panic

462
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,040
when Fate abandons everyone
all at once?

463
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,080
You know,
my sister was right about you lot.

464
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,120
You shoot first
and play doctor later.

465
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,600
It won't matter anyway.

466
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,640
Lachesis will find another way
to keep her hooks in

467
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,080
- because that is what she does best.
- Okay, fine.

468
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,880
So we just expose her
for what she really is.

469
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,000
She's a fraud,
we take her down a notch,

470
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,920
show everybody
that she can't control them anymore.

471
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yeah.

472
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,280
Charlie, she's your sister.

473
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,760
You're the only person
that can stand up to her.

474
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,440
I'm sorry.

475
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,840
I can't help you.

476
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,200
<i>The museum is now open.</i>

477
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,920
For centuries after my sister broke
the Loom of Fate,

478
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,840
the world was filled with pain.

479
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,600
Boo.

480
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Horror.

481
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,280
Boo.

482
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,120
Outrageous hubris and brutality.

483
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,040
Chaos.

484
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,280
But I could not let people suffer
any longer.

485
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,480
Alone, I rebuilt the Loom
and imprisoned my sister,

486
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,960
so that now and forever,
you may live in peace.

487
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,640
Here she is.

488
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,360
Loom breaker.

489
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,720
Creator of calamity.

490
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,200
Do you accept your fate?

491
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
No.

492
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,000
What did you say?

493
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,600
I said no.

494
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,160
Your story is a load of crap.

495
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Astra.

496
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,760
Where is Clotho?

497
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,120
That was always the question,
wasn't it?

498
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,520
Did you ever love me,

499
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,560
or were you just looking
to replace your sister?

500
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,040
You wanted a mother.

501
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,480
I had a mother.

502
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,880
A woman who understood
that to love someone

503
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,320
you have to set them free.

504
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,080
Shut your mouth, dear,
before you say something you regret.

505
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,160
Make me.

506
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,280
Come on, all powerful Fate, smite me.

507
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,880
Strike me down.

508
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,040
Yeah.

509
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,000
That's what I thought.

510
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,920
Why should these good people
listen to you?

511
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,880
Because she's telling the truth.

512
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,520
Take forever.

513
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,480
<i>How's it looking, Zaris?</i>

514
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
I need to get into her mainframe
to shut her down.

515
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,600
This might take a minute.

516
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,160
You tricked everyone
into giving up their freedom

517
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,320
by making them afraid of the past.

518
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,680
That's rich.

519
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,520
Coming from some of history's
most notorious criminals and killers.

520
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,800
Shame, shame, shame.

521
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,880
- Shame.
- All right.

522
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,640
Yes, you're right.

523
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,120
We've made mistakes,

524
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,720
but sometimes things get messed up
for the better.

525
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,560
Take Marie Antoinette, for instance.

526
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,440
Her indifference
caused a revolution in France.

527
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,760
It gave them democracy.

528
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,720
Look, if you listen to her,
your stories are over.

529
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,400
They're right, don't listen to me.

530
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,400
Listen to the Loom.

531
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,320
Come on, Zari.

532
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,800
Okay, I made it past
the first firewall.

533
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,440
Wait, is that...

534
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,120
Very well.

535
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,320
If it's chaos that you want,
chaos you shall have.

536
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,640
That's more like it.

537
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,840
(Foreign language)

538
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,600
That's our move.

539
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,760
They stole our move.

540
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,320
Enjoy your free will, Legends.

541
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,200
Stalin? Caligula?

542
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,800
If they get out,
they'll destroy the city.

543
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,720
Okay, you got any ideas, Cap?

544
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,880
Just a lot of bad ones.

545
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,440
Let's go save the world.

546
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,400
<i>This thing right here</i>

547
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,120
<i>Is letting all the ladies know</i>

548
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,400
<i>What guys talk about</i>

549
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,680
<i>You know</i>

550
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,760
<i>The finer things in life</i>

551
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,640
<i>Check it out</i>

552
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,720
<i>Ooh, dat dress so scandalous</i>

553
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,560
<i>And ya know another
Couldn't handle it</i>

554
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,680
<i>See ya shaking that thang</i>

555
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,760
<i>Like who's da ish</i>

556
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,880
<i>With a look in ya eye so devilish</i>

557
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,600
<i>Ya like to dance
At all the hip-hop spots</i>

558
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,560
<i>And ya cruise to the crews
Like connect da dots</i>

559
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,480
<i>Not just urban, she likes the pop</i>

560
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,360
<i>Because she was living la vida loca</i>

561
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,520
<i>She had dumps like a truck
Truck, truck</i>

562
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,560
<i>Thighs like what, what, what</i>

563
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,520
<i>Baby, move your butt, butt, butt</i>

564
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,040
<i>I think I'll sing it again</i>

565
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,440
<i>She had dumps like a truck
Truck, truck</i>

566
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,440
<i>Thighs like what, what, what</i>

567
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,360
<i>All night long</i>

568
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,160
<i>Let me see that thong</i>

569
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,240
<i>Baby</i>

570
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,160
<i>That thong th-thong thong thong</i>

571
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,200
- You again?
- I see your manners

572
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,880
have not improved,
you smelly peasant.

573
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,760
Thief.

574
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,120
<i>Listen, that girl so scandalous</i>

575
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,080
<i>And I know another couldn't handle it</i>

576
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,120
<i>And she shakin' that thang
Like who's da ish</i>

577
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,280
I liked you better
when you were a coin.

578
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,080
<i>Ya like to dance
At all the hip hop spots</i>

579
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,960
<i>And she cruise to the crews
Like connect da dots</i>

580
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,800
<i>Not just urban, she like the pop</i>

581
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,680
- Not again.
<i>- Because she was living la vida loca</i>

582
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,000
<i>She had dumps like a truck
Truck, truck</i>

583
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,920
<i>Thighs like what, what, what</i>

584
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
<i>Baby, move your butt, butt, butt</i>

585
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,840
<i>- I think I'll sing it again</i>
- (Foreign language)

586
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,680
<i>Thighs like what, what, what</i>

587
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,720
<i>- All night long</i>
- These brats just won't stay dead.

588
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,280
<i>Let me see that thong</i>

589
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,600
- Because they're not hell weapons.
<i>- Baby</i>

590
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,680
<i>Show it to us</i>

591
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,280
<i>That thong th-thong thong thong</i>

592
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,600
- Oh, thank God.
- Come on.

593
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,800
You gotta get over yourself.

594
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,440
So, 49 percent of life is crappy.

595
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,720
Fine, 51 percent isn't.

596
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,880
And that's the two percent
that's worth fighting for.

597
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,040
And how can you be so sure?

598
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,720
Because I am that two percent.

599
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm the product of complete
and utter chaos.

600
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,080
My dad time-traveled
to his high school reunion,

601
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,160
and then slept with his ex
in a broom closet.

602
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,120
I don't think it gets
much more chaotic than that.

603
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,600
And then, he tried to erase you
from existence.

604
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,280
But out of all of that insanity,
I got a dad,

605
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,560
and I love him.

606
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,760
And life is messy,
but that's what makes it beautiful.

607
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,480
You want to go make a real mess?

608
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,040
- We can't let them out.
- Can't keep them in.

609
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,720
Then why not destroy them?

610
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
Now, grab a hell weapon,

611
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,840
and let's drop the curtain
on these bloody Encores.

612
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,320
Hey, need a hand?

613
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,240
Should have been here with you.

614
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,280
You're wild and unpredictable,
just how we like you.

615
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,840
Guess it's time for me to stand up
to my sister once and for all.

616
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,640
Well, then you're gonna need this.

617
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,560
Good luck, Captain.

618
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,000
Gideon, reboot Fate protocol.

619
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Gideon?

620
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,520
Gideon?

621
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,360
It's over, Lachesis.

622
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,600
Our whole lives, you humiliated me.

623
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,080
You made me feel so small.

624
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,600
I tried to run away
and you hunted me down.

625
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,800
What do you want?

626
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,160
And all that time...

627
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,320
I thought that I needed
your forgiveness.

628
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,600
But it turns out,
it's you who needs forgiveness.

629
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,520
I forgive you.

630
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,200
You who have left me with nothing.

631
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,280
I gave you back your power.

632
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,440
I gave you back your immortality.

633
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,360
When you destroyed our Loom,
we all lost that gift.

634
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,960
I was a God.

635
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,960
Now, I'm...

636
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,640
I'm nothing.

637
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,080
You're not nothing.

638
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,360
You're a human.

639
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,920
And that means
that you only have one life to live.

640
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,600
Now, don't go wasting that

641
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,840
trying to keep everything
under your control.

642
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,080
All right, that should do 'er.

643
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:10,000
(Foreign language)

644
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,440
- What's she doing?
- <i>English detected. Hello.</i>

645
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,760
<i>What is your name, Captain?</i>

646
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,480
Captain? I like that.

647
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,040
Working on Gidi without me?

648
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,280
We tried comming you this morning,
but you didn't answer.

649
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,120
Broken eye contact, flushed cheeks.

650
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,400
I mean, that's not fair.

651
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,480
I can't keep a secret from myself.

652
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,960
What are we keeping a secret?

653
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,880
Well, bro, when a man and a woman
love each other very much...

654
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,160
Are you talking about sex with Nate?

655
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,680
That's not a secret.

656
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,360
Now, you and John, that's a secret.

657
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,240
- Behrad?
- Behrad, nice.

658
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,160
Hey, what's...

659
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,360
- What's happening?
- It's fine, I'm...

660
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,040
You're not fine, you're bleeding.

661
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,960
It's me.

662
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,040
By being here,
I'm causing a temporal disturbance,

663
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,240
and it's killing you.

664
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,480
What does that mean?

665
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,400
It means
there's two timelines fighting

666
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,360
for control of Behrad's life,
and in mine, you're dead.

667
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,440
I have to go back in the Totem.

668
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,000
- No way.
- Behrad-jan...

669
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,840
It's my turn to save you.

670
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,920
Can I text you in a Totem?

671
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,520
Oh, no,
there's no technology allowed.

672
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,680
Not even like a pager.

673
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,600
I'm gonna miss you,

674
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,680
so much.

675
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,440
Me too.

676
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,840
You know I have to do this, right?

677
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,280
Yeah.

678
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,920
I just wish...

679
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,360
I wish I was leaving you with some...

680
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,120
something.

681
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,720
You, you are, and you have, I mean...

682
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,200
I lost everything at Heyworld.

683
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,360
All of our memories.

684
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,320
But you brought those back to me.

685
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,320
And now I get to remember
the woman I love forever.

686
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,040
No regrets.

687
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,560
No regrets.

688
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,520
Hey.

689
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,360
It's not fair.

690
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,000
- I will just call you back.
- Yeah.

691
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,080
There has to be something
that we can do.

692
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,040
You already did.

693
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,880
You found me and brought me home.

694
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,400
- Wait, there are two of them?
- Mick.

695
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,120
So, how are you gonna get back?

696
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,800
Totem Master, remember?

697
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,040
Bye, guys.

698
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,640
I need so many drinks.

699
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
Yeah.

700
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,720
I know the perfect place.

701
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,640
We're The Smell.

702
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,000
Now, welcome to the best show
of your lives,

703
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,320
you wankers.

704
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,760
<i>Welcome to my cul-de-sac, friends</i>

705
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,400
<i>That's a street that ends in a circle</i>

706
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,760
<i>The thing about circles</i>

707
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,200
<i>Is they never end</i>

708
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,240
<i>So our friendship will be universal</i>

709
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,080
<i>It's Mr. Parker's cul-de-sac</i>

710
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,640
<i>- Mr. Parker's cul-de-sac</i>
- Weren't they dead?

711
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,800
<i>- Mr. Parker's cul-de-sac</i>
- I mean, who hasn't died?

712
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,360
Hey, finally some time travel.

713
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,240
I can't believe Charlie
is the lead singer of The Smell,

714
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,920
that's insane, they're my favorite.

715
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,480
Them and The Runaways.

716
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,600
We can go see them next.

717
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,000
It's a school night,
how about the weekend?

718
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,560
<i>- Mr. Parker's cul-de-sac</i>
- Yeah.

719
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,760
<i>Mr. Parker's cul-de-sac</i>

720
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,440
- Excuse me, boss.
<i>- Mr. Parker's cul-de-sac</i>

721
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,920
So, what's next for you, love?

722
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,880
I guess I'll give life above ground
a fair shot.

723
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,440
New York? Paris? Tokyo?

724
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,280
I was thinking about
this haunted house out in the sticks.

725
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,680
- Were you, now?
<i>- So let's run this thing together</i>

726
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,920
I got my rent covered.

727
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,640
<i>I'm Mr. Parker's cul-de-sac</i>

728
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,200
- Finally.
<i>- Mr. Parker's cul-de-sac</i>

729
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,720
- All right, then. Cheers.
<i>- Mr. Parker's cul-de-sac</i>

730
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,040
<i>So, what, you're looking for</i>

731
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,440
<i>A friend that's new?</i>

732
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,160
<i>I've always wanted a friend like you</i>

733
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,920
<i>Welcome to my cul-de-sac, friends</i>

734
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,560
<i>It's a street that goes on forever</i>

735
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,240
<i>A friendship is family without end</i>

736
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,160
<i>So let's run this thing together</i>

737
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,160
<i>I'm Mr. Parker's cul-de-sac</i>

738
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,600
<i>Mr. Parker's cul-de-sac</i>

739
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,960
<i>Mr. Parker's cul-de-sac</i>

740
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,440
That's my girl.

741
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,040
Guys, guys, guys,
I could taste the moon.

742
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,360
And that's enough for the evening.

743
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,080
All right, all right.

744
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,360
We came, we partied, we conquered.

745
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,240
And now, it's time to go,
it's time to go home.

746
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,560
Home.

747
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,000
Actually, guys...

748
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,480
I think this is the end of the line
for me.

749
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,160
- Well.
- Wait, what?

750
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,480
For reals?

751
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,880
Yeah, it's time for me
to just stay put for once.

752
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,240
And set down some roots.

753
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,640
All right. Well...

754
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,520
if you ever need anything,
and I mean anything,

755
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,040
you know where to find us.

756
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,840
Thanks, Captain.

757
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,480
Once a Legend...

758
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,040
Always a Legend.

759
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,120
Thank you.

760
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,720
Well, come on, all of you.

761
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,360
Get in here.

762
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,040
I love you.

763
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,800
I'm really gonna miss you guys.

764
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,880
Miss you.

765
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,000
All right, go on. Get out there.

766
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,760
Go and enjoy your vacations.

767
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,840
You've earned it.

768
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,520
Vacation.

769
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,320
- Vacation.
- Vacation.

770
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,240
It's vacation.

771
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,920
- I'm gonna go to a spa.
- I like...

772
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,480
I think I'm gonna text Dion,

773
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,080
- or is that too desperado.
- This is why I don't have a phone.
