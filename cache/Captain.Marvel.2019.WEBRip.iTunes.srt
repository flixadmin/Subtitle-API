absolutely right, young lady.

'Cause if there were,

822

we would want to keep that
to ourselves.

a lot more than make tea

(SIGHS) Maybe later.

831
00:58:22,252 --> 00:58:23,504
I kept all your stuff.

832
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:24,838
I'll go get it.

833
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:27,424
You want to give her
a hand with that?

834
00:58:27,716 --> 00:58:28,800
Hmm?

835
00:58:43,815 --> 00:58:45,734
You don't remember anything?

Little moments.

But I can't tell what's real.

839
00:58:57,829 --> 00:59:01,124
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning...

840
00:59:01,667 --> 00:59:03,961
maybe it'll all make sense.

(CLICKS TONGUE)

842

Your usual move.

844

Back then,
we had to get up so early.

845
00:59:15,681 --> 00:59:18,183
The Air Force still wasn't
letting women fly combat...

846
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:20,894
so testing Lawson's planes
was our only shot

847
00:59:20,978 --> 00:59:22,187
at doing something
that mattered.

848
00:59:22,354 --> 00:59:25,107
You wanted to race to base
in your old Mustang...

849
00:59:25,232 --> 00:59:26,233
and I wasn't about to argue,

850
00:59:26,316 --> 00:59:28,110
'cause I knew
my Camaro would dominate.

851

But you cheated,
took a shortcut.

852
00:59:30,571 --> 00:59:32,114
Since when is
a shortcut cheating?

853
00:59:32,281 --> 00:59:33,323
Since it violates
the predetermined

854

I definitely
don't remember those.

00:59:35,868 --> 00:59:37,536
Hmm. Of course you don't.

857
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:38,912
(BOTH LAUGH)

858
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:47,713
When I got to the hangar,
Lawson was agitated.

859
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,924
She said
she had lives to save.

860
00:59:51,884 --> 00:59:53,302
She was trying
to take the Asis up herself,

861
00:59:53,385 --> 00:59:54,428
but you said that...

862
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:58,140
If there were lives at stake,
I would fly the plane.

863
00:59:58,307 --> 01:00:02,561
Yeah. Yep. Big hero moment.

864
01:00:03,145 --> 01:00:06,148
The kind of moment
we'd both been waiting for.

865
01:00:07,065 --> 01:00:10,652
The doc was always unique.
That's why we liked her.

866
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:15,490
But now you're saying
she's from another planet.

867

I know
this must be hard for you.

No. No. Mmm-mmm.

01:00:26,752 --> 01:00:30,797
Oh, what's hard
is losing my best friend...

871
01:00:31,298 --> 01:00:32,633
in a mission so secret

they act
like it never even happened.

873
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:40,390
Hard is knowing
you were out there somewhere

874
01:00:40,474 --> 01:00:42,351
too damn stubborn to die.

875
01:00:43,685 --> 01:00:46,438
And now you come up in here
after six years...

with your supercharged
fire hands...

and you expect me
to call you...

I don't even know what. Vers?

with your parents...

so Mom said
we became your real family.

you graduated.

I noticed that peculiar bird
you got parked by the road...

if you mind
if I bring the boys over

but I'm sure
that you understand

I had to take
some precautions.

where that is?

979
01:05:01,902 --> 01:05:02,945
(PURRING)

980
01:05:03,028 --> 01:05:04,905
Oh, my God!
Get that thing away.

981
01:05:05,072 --> 01:05:06,406
How'd that get in here?

982
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:07,616
Hmm?

983
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:09,993
-The cat?
-(WHIMPERS)

984
01:05:10,118 --> 01:05:11,245
This isn't what
you're afraid of, is it?

985
01:05:11,745 --> 01:05:12,871
That's not a cat.

986
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:16,041
-That's a Flerken.
-FURY: A Flerken?

987
01:05:16,124 --> 01:05:17,751
-(LAUGHS)
-MONICA: Mom?

988
01:05:25,259 --> 01:05:26,260
MARIA: Monica.

989
01:05:26,426 --> 01:05:27,970
-Why can't I listen, too?
-Shh!

990
01:05:55,789 --> 01:05:57,207
What's happening?

991
01:05:57,374 --> 01:05:58,959
It's loading.

992
01:06:02,796 --> 01:06:04,089
LAWSON: (OVER SPEAKERS)
Punch in the coordinates

993
01:06:04,173 --> 01:06:08,552
5-2-2-9,
negative 4-7, 8.7-6-8, 0.2.

994
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:10,679
VERS: Copy that.
Where are we going, Doc?

995
01:06:10,846 --> 01:06:12,222
LAWSON: My laboratory.

996
01:06:12,389 --> 01:06:14,600
VERS: Your laboratory?
What do you mean?

997
01:06:14,766 --> 01:06:15,893
LAWSON: Oh, no.

998
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:18,061
VERS: Is that...
Wait, what is that?

999
01:06:18,145 --> 01:06:19,563
It's not showing up
on my radar.

1000
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:21,273
LAWSON: Go, Carol. Fly!

1001
01:06:21,607 --> 01:06:23,859
That's no MiG, Lawson.
Who the hell are they?

1002
01:06:24,026 --> 01:06:26,028
Those are the bad guys.
Fly faster now!

1003
01:06:26,111 --> 01:06:27,112
Yes, ma'am.

1004
01:06:33,243 --> 01:06:35,329
-What do they want?
-Me. My work.

1005
01:06:35,537 --> 01:06:37,039
I never should have
brought you along.

1006
01:06:42,252 --> 01:06:43,253
Here come some G's.

1007
01:07:00,854 --> 01:07:01,939
(BEEPING)

1008
01:07:02,814 --> 01:07:04,525
They're firing backwards.
Hold on!

1009
01:07:15,953 --> 01:07:17,204
Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

1010
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:19,957
(ALARM BLARING)

1011
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:22,251
Stay with me, Lawson!

1012
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:41,854
MARIA: (ON RADIO)
Carol, come in. Do you copy?

1013
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:44,439
VERS: Yeah, I copy.
We hit ground.

1014
01:07:44,606 --> 01:07:46,149
MARIA: Carol, are you okay?
Do you copy?

1015
01:07:46,316 --> 01:07:48,485
Yeah! I copy.

1016
01:07:51,238 --> 01:07:52,239
Doc?

1017
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,700
Your blood.

1018
01:07:55,492 --> 01:07:57,160
-(GROANS)
-It's blue.

1019
01:07:57,369 --> 01:08:00,539
Yeah, but, uh, how's my hair?

1020
01:08:01,999 --> 01:08:04,376
Help me out, will ya?

1021
01:08:07,421 --> 01:08:10,465
I gotta destroy it
before they get here.

1022
01:08:10,632 --> 01:08:11,717
VERS: Lawson?

1023
01:08:12,134 --> 01:08:15,888
You remember what I said about
our work here? What it's for?

1024
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:18,140
To end wars?

1025
01:08:18,307 --> 01:08:21,935
Yeah. But the wars are bigger
than you know.

1026
01:08:23,145 --> 01:08:24,604
Damn it!

1027
01:08:25,229 --> 01:08:27,191
My name is not Lawson.

1028
01:08:27,649 --> 01:08:30,694
My real name is Mar-Vell,

1029
01:08:30,777 --> 01:08:33,572
and I come
from a planet called Hala.

1030
01:08:33,697 --> 01:08:34,823
(EXHALES)

1031
01:08:34,907 --> 01:08:36,950
I would say
that you're delusional...

1032
01:08:37,158 --> 01:08:38,743
but we just got shot down
by a spaceship

1033
01:08:38,827 --> 01:08:40,328
and your blood is blue.

1034
01:08:41,205 --> 01:08:45,042
Listen, I spent half my life
fighting a shameful war.

1035
01:08:45,209 --> 01:08:47,044
Now, skedaddle
before you give me

1036
01:08:47,127 --> 01:08:48,337
any more regrets.

1037
01:08:48,504 --> 01:08:50,589
Just remember
the coordinates, okay?

1038
01:08:51,173 --> 01:08:52,758
You gotta save 'em without me.

1039
01:08:52,925 --> 01:08:53,966
Save who? How?

1040
01:08:54,134 --> 01:08:57,011
Now I gotta blow this engine
before they find it.

1041
01:08:57,179 --> 01:08:58,471
What are you doing?

1042
01:08:59,389 --> 01:09:00,640
-(GUNSHOT)
-(GASPS)

1043
01:09:04,269 --> 01:09:05,938
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1044
01:09:18,408 --> 01:09:20,493
We have no interest
in hurting you.

1045
01:09:20,868 --> 01:09:22,203
No?

1046
01:09:22,371 --> 01:09:25,040
'Cause all the shooting kinda
gave me the wrong impression!

1047
01:09:26,582 --> 01:09:28,042
The energy core.

1048
01:09:28,877 --> 01:09:30,127
Where is it?

1049
01:09:30,295 --> 01:09:32,005
Pararescue's on the way.

1050
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,716
You have two minutes
until you're surrounded.

1051
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:37,678
Then I see no reason
to prolong this conversation.

1052
01:09:37,845 --> 01:09:38,886
VERS: No, wait!

1053
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:46,687
You mean that energy core?

1054
01:09:51,233 --> 01:09:52,359
(SHOUTS) No!

1055
01:10:35,986 --> 01:10:39,364
Commander? She's still moving.
Permission to fire.

1056
01:10:39,531 --> 01:10:40,532
Hold your fire.

1057
01:10:50,542 --> 01:10:52,419
MINN-ERVA:
There's nothing left.

1058
01:10:52,586 --> 01:10:54,254
The core has been destroyed.

1059
01:11:03,847 --> 01:11:05,849
YON-ROGG:
She absorbed its power.

1060
01:11:08,101 --> 01:11:09,895
She's coming with us.

1061
01:11:23,617 --> 01:11:26,286
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1062
01:11:30,749 --> 01:11:32,125
He lied to me.

1063
01:11:34,753 --> 01:11:36,713
Everything that I knew
was a lie.

1064
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,383
Now, you understand.

1065
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:42,052
What?
What do I understand now?

1066
01:11:42,219 --> 01:11:44,096
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

1067
01:11:44,263 --> 01:11:45,389
He killed her...

1068
01:11:46,265 --> 01:11:48,058
'cause she found out
that she was

1069
01:11:48,141 --> 01:11:51,353
on the wrong side
of an unjust war.

1070
01:11:51,436 --> 01:11:52,479
VERS: No.

1071
01:11:53,063 --> 01:11:55,190
Your people are terrorists.

1072
01:11:55,357 --> 01:11:56,859
They kill innocents.

1073
01:11:57,025 --> 01:11:58,777
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

1074
01:11:58,944 --> 01:12:02,197
Ruins that the Accusers
are responsible for.

1075
01:12:02,573 --> 01:12:05,868
My people lived as refugees
on Torfa.

1076
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:09,621
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...

1077
01:12:09,788 --> 01:12:11,790
and they destroyed our planet.

1078
01:12:11,957 --> 01:12:15,544
And the handful of us
that are left

1079
01:12:15,627 --> 01:12:17,671
will be slaughtered next...

1080
01:12:17,838 --> 01:12:21,842
unless you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.

1081
01:12:23,135 --> 01:12:24,553
The core that she found

1082
01:12:24,636 --> 01:12:26,180
would have powered
a light-speed ship...

1083
01:12:26,346 --> 01:12:28,140
capable of carrying us
to safety.

1084
01:12:28,307 --> 01:12:32,269
A new home where
the Kree can't reach us.

1085
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:36,106
Lawson always told us
that our work at Pegasus

1086
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:37,441
wasn't to fight wars...

1087
01:12:37,608 --> 01:12:38,609
but to end them.

1088
01:12:39,234 --> 01:12:44,781
She wanted you to help us
find the core.

1089
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:46,825
Well, I already destroyed it.

1090
01:12:46,992 --> 01:12:48,535
No, you destroyed the engine.

1091
01:12:48,702 --> 01:12:51,705
The core that powered it
is in a remote location.

1092
01:12:51,872 --> 01:12:56,168
If you help us
decode those coordinates...

1093
01:12:56,335 --> 01:12:57,878
we can find it.

1094
01:12:59,671 --> 01:13:01,298
You'll use it to destroy us.

1095
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:06,553
(SIGHS)
We just want a home.

1096
01:13:10,807 --> 01:13:16,021
You and I lost everything
at the hands of the Kree.

1097
01:13:16,188 --> 01:13:18,023
Can't you see it now?

1098
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:19,566
You're not one of them.

1099
01:13:22,611 --> 01:13:24,112
You don't know me.

1100
01:13:25,489 --> 01:13:27,950
You have no idea who I am.

1101
01:13:30,077 --> 01:13:32,329
I don't even know who I am!

1102
01:13:33,622 --> 01:13:35,916
You are Carol Danvers.

1103
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:39,294
You are the woman
on that black box

1104
01:13:39,378 --> 01:13:41,922
risking her life
to do the right thing.

1105
01:13:43,715 --> 01:13:45,467
My best friend...

1106
01:13:45,634 --> 01:13:48,554
who supported me
as a mother and a pilot

1107
01:13:48,637 --> 01:13:50,097
when no one else did.

1108
01:13:50,722 --> 01:13:55,811
You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass...

1109
01:13:55,978 --> 01:13:59,231
and you were the most
powerful person I knew...

1110
01:13:59,398 --> 01:14:02,484
way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.

1111
01:14:03,235 --> 01:14:04,653
You hear me?

1112
01:14:06,071 --> 01:14:07,865
Do you hear me?

1113
01:14:15,122 --> 01:14:17,124
Come here. Come here, girl.

1114
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:19,209
I got you.

1115
01:14:23,463 --> 01:14:26,466
TALOS: I know
I don't deserve your trust...

1116
01:14:26,717 --> 01:14:28,844
but you were our only lead.

1117
01:14:29,011 --> 01:14:31,263
We discovered
that your energy signature

1118
01:14:31,346 --> 01:14:34,099
matched Mar-Vell's core.

1119
01:14:34,933 --> 01:14:36,768
Now we know why.

1120
01:14:38,604 --> 01:14:42,566
If only you knew
the importance of it to me.

1121
01:14:43,692 --> 01:14:45,402
I just need your help

1122
01:14:45,485 --> 01:14:49,031
decoding the coordinates
to Mar-Vell's lab.

1123
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:52,784
Those weren't coordinates.
They're state vectors.

1124
01:14:52,951 --> 01:14:54,870
For orbital position
and velocity.

1125
01:14:55,037 --> 01:14:56,747
You didn't find her lab
on Earth,

1126
01:14:56,830 --> 01:14:58,081
'cause it's not on Earth.

1127
01:14:58,248 --> 01:14:59,333
VERS: That was the location

1128
01:14:59,416 --> 01:15:00,501
on the date
of the crash six years ago.

1129
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:02,044
If we track its course,

1130
01:15:02,127 --> 01:15:04,421
we'll find it in orbit
right now.

1131
01:15:04,588 --> 01:15:06,298
It's just basic physics.

1132
01:15:08,759 --> 01:15:09,760
In orbit?

1133
01:15:11,678 --> 01:15:13,263
Was that so difficult
to figure out?

1134
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:15,641
I mean,
you're my science guy, right?

1135
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:18,852
Yon-Rogg will catch up
to me soon.

1136
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:21,605
We've got to get to the core

deny the facts of that story.

1624
01:51:33,986 --> 01:51:34,987
that we still haven't
found the Tesseract.

Sir?

what other intergalactic

01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:06,894
You think you can find
others like her?

1641
01:52:06,977 --> 01:52:09,980
Hmm, we found her,
and we weren't even looking.

1642
01:52:11,064 --> 01:52:12,357
Get some rest, sir.

You got
a big decision to make.
