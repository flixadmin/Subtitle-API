2
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,219
Okay. That's okay.

3
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,819
Get that.

4
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,358
Hey.

5
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,521
- Oh, God. Please.
- Oh, jeez.

6
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,145
Please.

7
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,641
Please.

8
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,829
It's a bold plan, Mr. White.

9
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,830
You sure this is the way to go?

10
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,287
Yeah.

11
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:07,830
Yeah.

12
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:31,915
You see that?

13
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,078
- What does he remember?
- Not a whole lot.

14
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,114
He came in dehydrated
and disoriented...

15
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:10,035
...but once we gave him fluids
he stabilized pretty quickly.

16
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,365
But I mean...

17
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,954
- He knows where he is?
- Oh, yes, yes. Absolutely.

18
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:18,505
It's only the last day or so
that seem to be missing.

19
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,290
Go on in. He's probably awake.

20
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,970
My God.

21
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,227
Walter.

22
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:35,065
I'm so sorry.

23
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:43,981
Come here.

24
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,490
You know who I am, right?

25
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,829
Yes, son. I know who you are.

26
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,874
Come here. Give your old man a hug.

27
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,994
It's so good to see you.

28
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,084
How do you feel?

29
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:07,802
Better.

30
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,843
Yeah. I...

31
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,302
I feel like myself.

32
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,513
Really, I mean, in...

33
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,815
The past couple days are missing,
but other than that...

34
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,060
...I feel fine.

35
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,272
My God, Walt.

36
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:27,859
What a day this has been.

37
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:31,198
So, Uncle Hank,
he was in a shootout?

38
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,536
A shootout?

39
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,704
He killed some guy.
Some big drug dealer.

40
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,916
Uncle Hank wasted him.

41
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,799
- Oh, my God. Is he all right?
- Absolutely fine.

42
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:44,792
- Where did this happen? How could...?
- Walt, everything's okay.

43
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,427
We're all okay.

44
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:50,303
We'll be all right.

45
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,139
And no idea what caused it?

46
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,551
No.

47
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,725
But they're gonna run
a whole series of tests, so...

48
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:01,891
But what could it be? I mean, did they
give you a worst-case scenario?

49
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,237
I really...

50
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,986
You know, there's no point
in getting ahead of ourselves, so...

51
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,697
Well, which supermarket?

52
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,949
Is it, like, a big one? Like, a chain?

53
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,871
- Marie.
- I... Don't get me wrong.

54
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:22,080
I think it's just great that, you know,
he's back and he's feeling better.

55
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,090
I just, I mean...

56
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,919
He... Naked?

57
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,925
He was naked.

58
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,885
Naked.

59
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,679
In a supermarket.

60
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,270
It wasn't Whole Foods, was it?

61
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,805
In any case, I'm gonna get over there
as soon as I can.

62
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:43,061
No, no. Don't worry about it
right now, Marie.

63
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,689
How's Hank?

64
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,443
You know, I ran over here
and I got to see him all of...

65
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:50,943
...30 seconds
before they yanked him away.

66
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,996
You know, you'd think today
of all days...

67
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:57,326
...they'd let him go home on time.

68
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,745
But how is he? Really?

69
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,454
Hank?

70
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,840
He's indestructible, you know that.

71
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:15,426
I identified myself and told the suspect
to show his hands, turn and face me.

72
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,313
At this point, I identified
the suspect as Mr. Salamanca...

73
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:21,807
...and observed what appeared to be
a gunshot wound in his midsection.

74
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,608
- He was shot previous to your arrival?
- Yes, sir.

75
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:29,439
Again I instructed him
to show his hands.

76
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,816
Mr. Salamanca lunged
toward the vehicle...

77
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:35,570
...and fired on me with what I
ascertained to be an M16 assault rifle.

78
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,829
I returned fire and sought cover...

79
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,078
...as Mr. Salamanca proceeded
to engage me.

80
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,959
When he paused to reload...

81
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,541
...I was able to take
an effective shot.

82
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,132
Agent Schrader...

83
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,762
...what were you doing in a shooting
fight on your own, with no backup?

84
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,680
Mr. Salamanca's presence
was not something I'd anticipated.

85
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:00,468
- I was tending to another matter.
- What other matter?

86
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,610
An unrelated family matter.

87
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,858
Searching for your brother-in-law,
as I understand.

88
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,575
- Your brother-in-law?
- Yes, sir. He's since been found.

89
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,537
He's fine. The whole thing
was a misunderstanding.

90
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,656
At the time, he'd been missing
for hours...

91
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:22,373
...and since he's in poor health,
the whole family was concerned.

92
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,495
I was talking to his acquaintances...

93
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,955
...trying to get a fix
on his whereabouts.

94
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,757
The Monte Carlo at the scene
belonged to a former student of his...

95
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,089
...a Jesse Pinkman.

96
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:38,885
I was tracking down Mr. Pinkman's car
when I came across Mr. Salamanca.

97
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:42,353
And what about this Pinkman? What
was his car doing at the crime scene?

98
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:46,265
- Have you run him down yet?
- Not yet, but we're working on it.

99
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,570
Man, they're like
Jehovah's Witnesses.

100
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,202
They don't give up.

101
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,665
I don't get it. Why don't they
kick your door down?

102
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,165
- They need probable cause.
- Probable cause?

103
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,174
Yo, what did you do? Rob a bank?

104
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:14,754
I told you, this is serious shit.

105
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,012
I'm like an outlaw.

106
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,387
Okay.

107
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,359
Let's do this.

108
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,784
Holy Christ!

109
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,455
You're Willy Wonka.

110
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:48,421
You are Willy Wonka,
and I got the golden ticket.

111
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,709
Put me on your magical boat, man.

112
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:55,045
Sail me down
your chocolaty river of meth.

113
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,590
So where you keep the pseudo?

114
00:09:56,805 --> 00:10:00,554
It's a P2P cook. That barrel?
Aqueous methylamine.

115
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,433
With that, you don't need pseudo.
Come on, help me out, man.

116
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,390
No pseudo?

117
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:10,807
Come to me, beautiful baby.
I'm gonna be so good to you.

118
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,733
Oh, my God. Just take this, here.

119
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:18,649
But I can't just let you
break this down.

120
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:21,490
- That'd be sacrilege.
- I told you, that's why we're here.

121
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,330
- You saw the cops. Right?
- Sure.

122
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,865
But couldn't we just
cook one quick batch?

123
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,836
- You know, for the road?
- No, forget it, all right?

124
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:32,878
- This stuff has to go, like, now.
- Dude, you owe me.

125
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:37,760
I mean, we're cool, but I ain't
forgetting you just left me stranded.

126
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,549
God, Badger!

127
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,390
Don't mess with me.

128
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,018
Got it?

129
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,652
Yeah, I got it.

130
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,955
Oh, my God.

131
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,546
Okay, that's all of it.

132
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,429
This was a bad choice.

133
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,602
You sure about this guy?

134
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:29,971
He's totally, totally cool.

135
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,934
He's my cousin.

136
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:39,569
- Yo, what'd we say, 500?
- We didn't say, and it's 1000.

137
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,158
Thousand bucks?

138
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,037
Come on, where you towing it,
man, Seattle?

139
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,037
It ain't the miles, it's the cargo.

140
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,917
Look, I mean, all I got on me is...

141
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:56,996
...560.

142
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,295
- You know what?
- Hey... No...

143
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,382
Clovis, he'll pay you the rest later.

144
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:06,097
He's totally good for it.
Jesse's a stand-up dude.

145
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,473
- That right? You a stand-up dude?
- Yeah, I am.

146
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,895
I will get you the other 500.

147
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,271
Five hundred more.

148
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,728
Your word's your bond, right?

149
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,780
Right.

150
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:30,033
I saved your skinny ass, yo.
I totally vouched for you.

151
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,289
What are you doing now, exactly?

152
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,378
I'm giving you, like, two hours...

153
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,040
...and then I'm calling on a pay phone,
not a cell phone.

154
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,801
You're not using your own name.

155
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:45,803
I mean, obviously. Look, dude, I'll do,
like, what you said, but why?

156
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,056
Why do you gotta go and do this?

157
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,927
They need probable cause.

158
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,475
I'm giving it to them.

159
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,741
What's the last thing
you remember?

160
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:12,490
Well, I was driving home.

161
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,323
I think.

162
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:16,958
And...

163
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,423
Do you remember coming home?

164
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,756
You came in, and I asked
why you were out of breath?

165
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:29,506
You don't remember talking to me
when I was in the bathtub?

166
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,137
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

167
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:37,693
- Nothing else? No fleeting images?
- Well, no. I...

168
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,225
I was...

169
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:47,029
I was walking down some road
or highway...

170
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:50,409
...with a lot of headlights...

171
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:54,750
...and I remember feeling fear.

172
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,998
- That's it.
- All right. Thank you.

173
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:02,215
Well, there's definitely
some good news here.

174
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:04,917
The MRI shows no metastases.

175
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:08,007
Meaning the cancer
hasn't spread to the brain?

176
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,050
Yeah, we're looking really good.

177
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,010
Oh, thank God.

178
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:15,935
So, what was it, then?

179
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:19,517
- There's no sign of stroke or seizure.
- And considering your condition...

180
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:21,395
...the blood panel looks good.

181
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,732
Then what are we talking about?
What happened?

182
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:28,199
As of right now, we really...

183
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,785
...can't say.

184
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:33,409
Forgive me.
Granted, this is not my field...

185
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:36,245
...but isn't it possible
that this had something to do...

186
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,583
...with all the prescriptions
I've been taking?

187
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,338
There's the antiemetic...

188
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,374
...the antitussive...

189
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:46,090
...the this, the that.
Not to mention the chemo itself.

190
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:52,641
And being off all of them
for the past few days, I have to say...

191
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,725
...I'm feeling much better.

192
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:57,510
Yeah, and, you know, when we pick up
these medications...

193
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,222
...the information sheets
are as long as your arm.

194
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:04,440
I mean, it's page after page
of side effects and warnings.

195
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:07,858
Right, exactly.
Could it be that simple?

196
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:11,775
Well, we'll take
another look at that, sure.

197
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,866
Walt, I understand that you've been
kind of stressed out lately.

198
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,076
Stressed out? I...

199
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,285
- No, I don't think I'm...
- Walt, please.

200
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,792
Stressed out is putting it...

201
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,250
...mildly.

202
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:31,054
Well, I guess I've had a lot
on my mind lately, but as I've said...

203
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:32,925
...I'm feeling much better.

204
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,811
Shouldn't we be talking
about when I can get out of here?

205
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,937
Well, that may still be
a ways down the road.

206
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,691
A ways down the road?

207
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,064
Actually, I think our next move
is to schedule a psychiatric evaluation.

208
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:51,490
Now, is that absolutely necessary?

209
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:54,027
Nobody likes being in the hospital.
I get that.

210
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,494
But until we know
what caused this incident...

211
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:59,079
...we can't be certain it won't recur.

212
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:46,039
- That your last hit?
- Yeah.

213
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,545
Finish it quick.

214
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,367
Show your hands.
Get on your stomach now.

215
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:27,583
Get on your stomach now!
Get over. Roll! Do it now!

216
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,636
I'm going, I'm going.

217
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,635
What's going on?

218
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,842
What did I do?

219
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,771
Jesse Pinkman, I presume.

220
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,130
- What, man?
- Tell me again.

221
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,419
Again?

222
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:13,467
What's there to tell, okay?
Her and I were partying, that's it.

223
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:16,631
Since Saturday night?
Partying for three days straight.

224
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:20,180
Just bumping uglies and smoking that
crystal you got from your pal, Tuco?

225
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,767
Taco? I don't know any Taco...

226
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:24,550
...and I damn sure didn't say
anything about no crystal.

227
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,396
Three days,
you must have got hungry.

228
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:27,852
Yeah, I guess.

229
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,355
- You order take-out?
- Yeah.

230
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:32,562
Yeah, where from?

231
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,402
You get yourself a little
of that moo goo gai pan...

232
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:37,739
...from that chink place
around the corner?

233
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,652
No, no, we didn't. We got stuff
from the vending machine.

234
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:43,496
You know, Funyuns.

235
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:45,166
I had a Hot Pocket.

236
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,866
Funyuns and Hot Pockets?

237
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,711
You didn't notice your car
was gone?

238
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:52,460
No, not until you guys went
and busted down the door.

239
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,750
Now, who's gonna pay for that, huh?

240
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,008
Management's gonna
be on my ass for sure.

241
00:18:57,221 --> 00:19:00,175
- You weren't answering your phone.
- It was in my car.

242
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:03,177
- That right?
- Yeah.

243
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:07,225
We found your car...

244
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,562
...but your phone wasn't in it.

245
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,269
You found my car?

246
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,521
You found my car?

247
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:17,071
Awesome. DEA all the way. Yes.

248
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,859
Since we're talking
about missing property, did you...?

249
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,701
Did you leave anything else
in the car?

250
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,031
Like what?

251
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:30,669
Like what? Like...

252
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:33,204
I don't know. Like this?

253
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:46,554
Sixty-seven thousand, nine hundred
and 20 dollars.

254
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,395
That's not mine.

255
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,397
That's not yours?

256
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:53,397
He says it's not his, Gomie.

257
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,936
Gee, I really thought
this might be yours.

258
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:59,737
- I wish.
- Unclaimed drug money, huh? Nice.

259
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,026
You know what we got here,
Gomie, don't you?

260
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:05,114
That's a new interdiction van
right there, yeah.

261
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:07,821
Definitely new softball jerseys,
because we need them.

262
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,701
Good thing Tuco's already dead.

263
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:12,326
I lost this kind of money,
I'd wanna kill myself.

264
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:15,878
So who's your chief, little Injun?

265
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:17,585
What?

266
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:20,802
- What does that even mean?
- I think your story's bullshit.

267
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:23,468
I think you know
who Tuco Salamanca was.

268
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,591
Your car was there
because you were there.

269
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:30,093
Tuco had a bullet in him when I
got there and you know about that too.

270
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:33,187
So, what are you saying?

271
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,309
I shot someone?

272
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:38,979
- With, like, a gun?
- You?

273
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,067
No.

274
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:44,367
Only shooting you do
is into a Kleenex.

275
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,702
But I think you know
the badass who did.

276
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:53,370
Look, I was partying with Wendy,
okay?

277
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:56,834
Funyuns and boom-boom.

278
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:59,085
No.

279
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:01,128
I don't think so.

280
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:04,463
Tell you what. We're gonna...

281
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:08,679
...go talk to that skinny yeast factory
of a girlfriend you got.

282
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:10,554
And you know what?

283
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:16,598
I got a feeling she's gonna, you know,
roll on you.

284
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:22,112
Don't go nowhere.

285
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:39,919
Where's my root beer? Come on.
I gotta pee, and I got low blood sugar.

286
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:43,170
- I got medical issues.
- Medical issues?

287
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:45,344
Like, what kind of medical issues?

288
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:47,216
You got penis withdrawal?

289
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,758
You got schlongus interruptus?

290
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,016
Wendy, listen. Talk to me...

291
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,057
...and you get a root beer
and a tinkle.

292
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:57,231
- Tell me the last three days.
- I told you...

293
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:59,980
...we were shacked up
since Saturday.

294
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:03,398
Neither of you left the room?
Not even for a little, little minute?

295
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:07,117
Not even for a second?

296
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:11,450
For a second? I don't know, maybe.

297
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:13,408
Maybe?

298
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,369
Did Jesse leave the room?

299
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:18,288
He did, didn't he?

300
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:21,876
Wendy, you can do it.
You can do it, Wendy.

301
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:25,345
Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.

302
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:29,179
You know you wanna go back
to giving windys, Wendy.

303
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:33,348
It's you. I know you.

304
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:36,895
You're the one in the black truck.
You wanted me to do that kid.

305
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:38,851
- What?
- The kid with the crutches.

306
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,356
- The football player.
- How about we stay on topic?

307
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,650
Look, Jesse came over to the palace
at 11:00 Saturday night.

308
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:48,653
We were together the whole time,
and he never left the room.

309
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:50,577
And that's all I'm saying about that.

310
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:52,361
Now, come on.

311
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:54,739
Where's my root beer?

312
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:00,370
You wanted her to bang
a football player, pervert?

313
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:02,083
It's a long story, Gomie.

314
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:05,798
I'm sure it is, and I wanna hear it,
but first we gotta kick Pinkman loose.

315
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:09,178
Not yet. I got one more shot
at that little skid mark.

316
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:18,471
And how are you sleeping?

317
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:24,357
Fine. Most nights.

318
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:25,859
Good.

319
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:28,445
Have you noticed
any recurring thoughts or images...

320
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:30,782
...things you can't
get out of your head?

321
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,449
How about feelings of guilt
or persecution?

322
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:42,453
No. Look, doctor,
I don't mean to be rude...

323
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,627
...but where is this going, exactly?

324
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:49,212
We're starting a process, Walt.
An ongoing process.

325
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:53,130
- Do you prefer Walt or Walter?
- Ongoing for how long?

326
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,630
I just met you. Hard to say.

327
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:57,852
We could be talking about days,
weeks, months.

328
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:03,141
Look, doctor, I feel fine, really.

329
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,640
Now...

330
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:10,152
...if this is truly necessary,
can't I continue as an outpatient?

331
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:12,990
Walt...

332
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:16,738
...a fugue state
is a very serious event.

333
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:19,080
What if you were to disassociate
while driving?

334
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:20,372
Get into a situation...

335
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:22,495
...where you could be shot
by the police?

336
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:24,373
We can't allow you to leave...

337
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,674
...until we're certain what happened
was a non-recurring event.

338
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:30,636
Saying you feel fine
doesn't solve this.

339
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:39,472
Would you tell me
about patient confidentiality?

340
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:40,851
It's very straightforward.

341
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:44,433
Without your permission,
I can't disclose anything to anyone.

342
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:45,932
What about my family?

343
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:49,486
Not your family, not to the police.
Not to anyone.

344
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:52,319
The exception would be
if you threatened to kill someone.

345
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:56,199
Then I'd be able to tell that person,
but only that person.

346
00:24:57,956 --> 00:25:00,032
And you, as a medical practitioner...

347
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,409
...you abide
by these strictures absolutely.

348
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:03,956
Yes.

349
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,423
All right.

350
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:16,173
There was no fugue state.

351
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:20,094
I remember everything.

352
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:26,773
The truth is...

353
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:30,604
...I couldn't stand to spend
another second in that house.

354
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:34,238
I just had to get out...

355
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:36,114
...and so I left.

356
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:38,486
I didn't think about it.
I just did it.

357
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:45,075
I walked for a long time, and when I
couldn't walk anymore, I hitchhiked.

358
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:48,750
I got as far as Gallup...

359
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:55,303
...and then it was just time
to come home.

360
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:57,091
So...

361
00:25:57,307 --> 00:26:00,142
...being found naked
in a supermarket...

362
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:03,887
...that was your way
of giving credibility to a lie?

363
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:07,309
Of avoiding questions
about your disappearance?

364
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:16,700
Why run away?

365
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,947
What did you feel
you had to run from?

366
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:28,079
Doctor, my wife
is seven months pregnant...

367
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:30,289
...with a baby we didn't intend.

368
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:34,960
My 15-year-old son
has cerebral palsy.

369
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:39,508
I am an extremely overqualified
high school chemistry teacher.

370
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:44,517
When I can work,
I make $43,700 per year.

371
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,769
I have watched
all of my colleagues...

372
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:49,354
...and friends surpass me
in every way imaginable...

373
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:53,435
...and within 18 months,
I will be dead.

374
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:58,065
And you ask why I ran?

375
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:33,730
Gomie, you wanna do the honors?

376
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:44,996
- What's that mean?
- That means yes.

377
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:49,205
- Yes is a bell, no is no bell.
- Come on, this is bullshit.

378
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:53,038
I mean, look at this dude. He doesn't
even know what planet he's living on.

379
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:54,715
Señor...

380
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:57,050
...are we on the planet Mars?

381
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:02,716
Are we on the planet Saturn?

382
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:06,768
Are we on the planet Earth?

383
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:12,559
Señor, is today Friday?

384
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:14,402
Is today Monday?

385
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:17,148
Is today Tuesday?

386
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:20,480
Okay, seems like he's all there.
Let's go for it.

387
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:23,824
Señor...

388
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:28,249
...was this man
at your house yesterday?

389
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:40,336
Señor, was this man
at your house yesterday?

390
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:51,104
This guy right here,
he was at your house, right?

391
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:53,556
Was he doing business
with your nephew Tuco?

392
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:59,442
Señor, are you scared of this man?

393
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:03,447
No, he's not scared.

394
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:09,406
Come on, Granddad.

395
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,866
Don't you wanna help us out?

396
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:31,309
Oh, man.

397
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:40,321
I guess that's a no.

398
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:45,321
- I told you, numbnuts. This guy's OG.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

399
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:47,658
Kept his mouth shut for 17 years
in San Quentin.

400
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:50,908
Stroke or no stroke, old-school
gangbang Mexicans don't help feds.

401
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:55,169
- All right. It was worth a try at least.
- We gotta kick Pinkman loose.

402
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:57,288
It's all right. He's nobody anyway.

403
00:29:57,506 --> 00:29:59,582
You telling me you buy
that lame-ass story?

404
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,085
I buy that lame-ass story more than
I buy he had anything to do...

405
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:05,379
...with shooting Tuco, man.

406
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:09,845
Dad? Hey, Dad.

407
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,851
Hey, can you hear me?

408
00:30:12,855 --> 00:30:15,725
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm fine. Hey, I'm...

409
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:18,230
What's...?

410
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:21,397
She did?
No, I didn't get any messages.

411
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,357
You know, I actually...

412
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:26,325
...lost my phone, and I've been
too busy to get a new one.

413
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:27,733
I've been busy as...

414
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:29,827
As totally productive.

415
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:33,324
Hey, you know what?
I'm actually zeroing in on a job.

416
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:36,827
Yeah, yeah, data entry,
like we talked about.

417
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:39,501
Yeah, I'm totally amped.

418
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:42,040
Hey, could you give me a ride?

419
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:46,672
I'm actually...
I'm downtown and my car's in the...

420
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:51,467
Oh, no.
Yeah, hey, that's cool. I will...

421
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:55,386
I'll call you later
when you have some...

422
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:58,140
Okay. Yeah. No. I...

423
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:00,980
I get it. I get it.

424
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:03,567
Okay, bye.

425
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,867
Thanks.

426
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,835
So, what are you doing now?

427
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:20,002
Waffle House?

428
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:23,413
Waffle House is good.

429
00:31:58,126 --> 00:31:59,122
Pay phone?

430
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:02,005
Pay phone, in the middle of nowhere,
nobody followed.

431
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:03,210
So how did it go?

432
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:06,634
Okay. You?

433
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:11,137
They sweated me plenty,
but they finally cut me loose.

434
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:13,680
- So you getting out of there?
- Tomorrow.

435
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:15,885
So who came for you?

436
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:17,846
The DEA? What did they ask you?

437
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:21,514
Yeah, that's the thing, you know.
Your scumbag brother-in-law...

438
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:23,276
...took my rainy-day fund.

439
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:25,277
Your what? What is that?

440
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:28,737
My rainy-day fund.
Sixty-eight thousand, okay?

441
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:30,858
Cue-ball son of a bitch
laughed in my face.

442
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:32,985
Now I got like 80 bucks
to my name.

443
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:34,579
Wait, wait. What does he know?

444
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:36,366
Does he know it's your money?

445
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:39,073
No, man.
He doesn't know shit, okay?

446
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:40,835
The plan worked.

447
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:42,242
They bought it.

448
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:44,918
I got bills due, man. I'm screwed.

449
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:49,260
- Did he mention my name?
- No. Thanks for caring.

450
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:54,343
- What about the basement?
- It's clean.

451
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:56,515
And the RV?

452
00:32:56,727 --> 00:33:00,559
Badger's cousin took it to his garage.
It's safe.

453
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:03,098
Can he get it running again?

454
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,933
- Why?
- So we can cook.

455
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:09,898
So you still wanna cook?

456
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:11,574
Seriously?

457
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:15,527
What's changed, Jesse?

458
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:27,543
Seven-hundred
thirty-seven thousand.

459
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:29,715
Twenty-one pounds...

460
00:33:29,927 --> 00:33:32,252
...minus cash on hand...

461
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:34,211
Cash on hand.

462
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,381
- Sorry, honey. Did I wake you?
- No, I was awake.

463
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:19,713
- Want some cornflakes?
- Yeah, sure.

464
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:28,141
- You okay?
- Yeah.

465
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:31,719
Southwest Aniline again?

466
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:34,184
What's this?

467
00:38:34,398 --> 00:38:36,723
It's the blue meth we found
up by your late homey.

468
00:38:36,942 --> 00:38:40,393
Tuco wasn't my homey, any more
than Charlie Manson was yours.

469
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:42,938
Lab says it got cooked, P2P-style.

470
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:45,483
P2P, huh?

471
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:47,243
So, what are you thinking?

472
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:49,326
The two stooges over here
cooked it?

473
00:38:50,163 --> 00:38:53,497
Lab said that blue meth's
the purest they've seen.

474
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:55,203
At least since this.

475
00:38:55,711 --> 00:38:58,036
- Krazy-8.
- Yeah.

476
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:02,257
Krazy-8, Tuco...

477
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:06,176
Somehow, some way,
it's all connected.

478
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:09,214
A simple explanation...

479
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:11,971
...only I'm not seeing it,
and it's making my head hurt.

480
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:14,723
That's because you're working
that ugly melon too hard.

481
00:39:14,938 --> 00:39:17,227
It's dead around here.
Let's get a couple of beers.

482
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:19,352
It's 11 in the morning.

483
00:39:19,568 --> 00:39:20,564
I'm buying.

484
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:22,022
You're buying? Holy crap.

485
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:25,072
- What, is it Cinco de Mayo already?
- Oh, yeah.

486
00:39:28,452 --> 00:39:30,907
Surprise.

487
00:39:31,622 --> 00:39:34,825
You little sneaky bastard, you.

488
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:36,662
Very nice work.

489
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:38,914
Thank you, sir.

490
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:43,497
- What's this?
- Look what we got you.

491
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:46,840
- Look at that, I love it.
- They got the gut right.

492
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:49,093
- Hey.
- There you go.

493
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:50,931
- Hey, thanks, man.
- Thank you.

494
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:56,927
We all got you a little something,
and this is from all of us.

495
00:39:57,147 --> 00:39:59,104
You shouldn't have.

496
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:03,441
Oh, you sick, sick puppies.

497
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:05,362
I love it.

498
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:12,445
You going to finish
your apple juice?

499
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,455
No, thanks, buddy. You take it.

500
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:19,036
You're supposed to drink it.

501
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:22,669
The nurse said
you have to stay hydrated.

502
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:24,923
But I'm not thirsty.

503
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:28,384
Dad. Drink it.

504
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:41,314
Hey.

505
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:43,268
Better late than never, huh?

506
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:45,394
- Hey.
- Hey.

507
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,238
How you doing, buddy?
You all right?

508
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:50,488
I see
the mark of the beast there, huh?

509
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:52,859
Oh, yeah.
Marie stopped by this morning.

510
00:40:53,078 --> 00:40:55,949
They really cheer the place up.

511
00:40:57,541 --> 00:41:00,162
Hey, I ran into Sky downstairs.

512
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:03,828
They're rounding up a wheelchair
for you, you freeloading bastard.

513
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:07,127
So tell us about the shootout.

514
00:41:07,342 --> 00:41:10,676
I was, you know, just doing my job.

515
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:13,343
Whole thing was over
in about five seconds.

516
00:41:13,557 --> 00:41:15,466
Say, Walt, you know...

517
00:41:15,684 --> 00:41:18,389
...how are you?

518
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,349
I'm okay.

519
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:23,137
Really, I'm feeling fine.

520
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:25,642
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

521
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:28,696
The doctor is calling it a...

522
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:32,950
An isolated episode of
transient global amnesia.

523
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,702
Damn.

524
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:36,536
Which means non-recurring.

525
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:38,905
Non-recurring.
That sounds good, yeah.

526
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:40,535
Sounds real good.

527
00:41:40,751 --> 00:41:44,369
I'll tell you what, I'm glad you're back.
You really gave us a scare.

528
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:47,423
Listen, Hank.

529
00:41:48,383 --> 00:41:49,961
I don't know what to say. I mean...

530
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:56,096
...you going out there looking for me
put you in danger, and I'm so...

531
00:41:56,308 --> 00:41:59,973
Sorry, sorry doesn't
even cut it. Not nearly.

532
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:02,760
No, no, no. Is that what you're
worried about? Forget it.

533
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:06,397
Look, the office, they're treating me
like I'm Eliot Ness, okay?

534
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:09,896
They threw me a party, the gals
baked me a chocolate-chip cake...

535
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:12,106
...like you wouldn't believe, okay?

536
00:42:12,324 --> 00:42:15,491
You ought to disappear more often.

537
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:18,075
Just kidding. Don't do that.

538
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,953
Hey, look.
Look what they gave me.

539
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:22,744
Look what they gave me.

540
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,205
What is it?

541
00:42:24,419 --> 00:42:28,880
That, gentlemen,
is the grill of the guy I shot.

542
00:42:29,925 --> 00:42:31,300
- His grill?
- Yeah.

543
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:34,083
It kind of goes over the front teeth
like that, you know?

544
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:36,593
Sort of a fashion statement, I guess.

545
00:42:36,807 --> 00:42:39,428
You know, certain folks
are attracted to shiny things.

546
00:42:39,643 --> 00:42:41,434
Wow, cool.

547
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:42,641
Yeah.

548
00:43:08,672 --> 00:43:11,424
I can't tell you how good it feels
to be home.

549
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:20,556
I'll get these in the wash.

550
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:22,096
Okay.

551
00:43:58,722 --> 00:44:00,880
Say, honey, I...

552
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:06,058
I was just thinking about going out
to 7-Eleven. Do you need anything?

553
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:15,769
Big Gulp? Slim Jim?

554
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:29,951
Skyler, listen to me.

555
00:44:32,589 --> 00:44:35,543
This will not happen again, okay?

556
00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:36,874
I won't let it.

557
00:44:38,095 --> 00:44:40,586
I'm still here. I'm me...

558
00:44:41,723 --> 00:44:44,179
...and we're gonna be okay.

559
00:44:50,107 --> 00:44:51,767
Walt...

560
00:44:54,736 --> 00:44:56,610
...do you have a second cell phone?

561
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,444
A second cell phone?

562
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:05,871
The night you disappeared, you came
in when I was taking a bath...

563
00:45:06,081 --> 00:45:08,157
...and you were very upset.

564
00:45:09,001 --> 00:45:11,918
It was like something
terrible had happened.

565
00:45:12,129 --> 00:45:14,964
And then your cell phone rang.

566
00:45:15,174 --> 00:45:18,424
I saw you check the number,
and then you got up...

567
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:21,091
...and just disappeared.

568
00:45:22,848 --> 00:45:24,307
Yeah.

569
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:26,805
And when Hank
checked your phone records...

570
00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:30,020
...there was no call.

571
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,932
No call on the phone I know about.

572
00:45:38,822 --> 00:45:40,447
That is...

573
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:42,365
...odd.

574
00:45:43,118 --> 00:45:45,526
I mean, I don't remember
any of that...

575
00:45:45,746 --> 00:45:50,704
...but one thing I am sure of is that
I don't have a second cell phone.

576
00:45:53,462 --> 00:45:55,004
Okay.

577
