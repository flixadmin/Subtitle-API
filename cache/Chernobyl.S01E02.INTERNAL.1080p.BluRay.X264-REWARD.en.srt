1
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,022
You work too hard.

2
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:47,150
Where is everyone?

3
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:48,693
They refused to come in.

4
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:51,237
Why?

5
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:53,323
It's Saturday.

6
00:01:55,742 --> 00:01:56,910
Why did you come in?

7
00:01:56,993 --> 00:01:58,077
I work too hard.

8
00:01:58,495 --> 00:01:59,788
It's boiling in here.

9
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:17,138
Eight milliroentgen. A leak?

10
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:18,223
No.

11
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:22,018
It would've gone off before.
It's coming from outside.

12
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:23,853
The Americans?

13
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:05,895
Iodine-131.

14
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:10,316
It's not military.
It's uranium decay, U-235.

15
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:12,068
Reactor fuel?

16
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,949
Ignalina. Maybe, uh,
240 kilometers away.

17
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:30,753
Yes, this is Ulana Khomyuk
with the Institute of Nuclear...

18
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,172
Looking for...

19
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:40,763
- All right, stay calm.
<i>- Don't tell me to stay calm.</i>

20
00:03:44,601 --> 00:03:47,103
They're at four. It's not them.

21
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,771
Who's the next closest?

22
00:03:49,314 --> 00:03:52,034
It's Chernobyl, but that's not
possible. They're 400 kilometers away.

23
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,319
That's too far
for eight milliroentgen.

24
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:55,612
They'd have to be split open.

25
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:57,655
Maybe they know something.

26
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:07,957
- Iodine.
- Could it be a waste dump?

27
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:09,709
No.

28
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:11,586
We'd be seeing other isotopes.

29
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:13,963
Nuclear test? Uh...

30
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:15,882
New kind of bomb?

31
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:18,246
We'd have heard. That's what
half our people work on here.

32
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:24,641
Something with the space program
like a satellite or...

33
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:28,353
No one's answering the phone.

34
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,084
Get everyone started on an IV.

35
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,168
We don't have enough.

36
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,146
- All the children, then.
- But we don't have enough!

37
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,213
As many as you can!

38
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:58,341
- Where's the old man?
- He's set up a burn ward in 16.

39
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:14,634
What are you doing? What is that?

40
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:17,026
Milk. It's milk.
Much better than water.

41
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,486
No, no, no. Stop. Stop!

42
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:19,570
What are you doing?

43
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:20,905
These are radiation burns!

44
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:22,615
Their clothes are contaminated!

45
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,659
Help me!

46
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,120
Get it all off.

47
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:30,498
We're taking it down to the basement.

48
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:35,128
He was a firefighter from Chernobyl.

49
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:36,629
Can you stop pushing, please?

50
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,010
We have our orders!

51
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,470
- Disperse!
- Hey, there! Get him!

52
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:48,641
Why are you keeping us out here?

53
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:46,532
Professor Legasov?

54
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:48,534
Oh, no, not yet.

55
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:51,513
They're finishing up some other
business. It'll be a few more minutes.

56
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:52,580
Can I get you some tea?

57
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,040
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

58
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:56,018
Would you care to read
Deputy Chairman Shcherbina's report

59
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:57,043
while you're waiting?

60
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:58,294
Certainly. Thank you.

61
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,022
All right, Professor.
They're ready.

62
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:03,442
Professor Legasov?

63
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:30,094
You have my support.

64
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:39,312
Thank you all
for your duty to this commission.

65
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:42,398
We will begin with
Deputy Chairman Shcherbina's briefing,

66
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:45,943
and then, we will discuss
next steps if necessary.

67
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,112
Thank you,
comrade General Secretary.

68
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:52,533
I'm pleased to report that
the situation in Chernobyl is stable.

69
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:55,411
Military and civilian patrols
have secured the region,

70
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,371
and Colonel General Pikalov,

71
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,791
who commands troops specializing
in chemical hazards,

72
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,710
has been dispatched to the plant.

73
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:04,378
In terms of radiation,

74
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:08,674
plant director Bryukhanov
reports no more than 3.6 roentgen.

75
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,636
I'm told it's the equivalent
of a chest X-ray.

76
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:14,263
So if you're overdue for a check-up...

77
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,724
- And foreign press?
- Totally unaware.

78
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:19,810
KGB First Deputy Chairman
Charkov assures me

79
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:22,563
that we have successfully
protected our security interests.

80
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:25,233
Good. Very good.

81
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,985
Well, it seems like
it's well in hand, so...

82
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:31,906
If there's nothing else,
meeting adjourned.

83
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:34,200
No!

84
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:38,162
Pardon me?

85
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:40,873
Uh, we can't adjourn.

86
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:43,834
This is Professor Legasov
of the Kurchatov Institute.

87
00:09:44,252 --> 00:09:45,836
Professor, if you have any concerns,

88
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,713
feel free to address them
with me later.

89
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:50,716
I can't. I am sorry. I'm so sorry.

90
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:55,304
Page three, the section on casualties.
Uh...

91
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:59,183
"A fireman was severely
burned on his hand"

92
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:01,602
"by a chunk of smooth, black mineral"

93
00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:04,188
"on the ground,
outside the reactor building."

94
00:10:04,272 --> 00:10:06,107
Smooth, black mineral, graphite.

95
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,025
There's graphite on the ground.

96
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:13,990
Well, there was a tank explosion.
There's debris.

97
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:15,592
Of what importance that could be...

98
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:19,203
There's only one place in the entire
facility where you will find graphite.

99
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:20,371
Inside the core.

100
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,123
If there's graphite
on the ground outside,

101
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:24,375
it means it wasn't
a control system tank that exploded.

102
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,752
It was the reactor core. It's open!

103
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:31,048
Um...

104
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:32,842
Comrade Shcherbina?

105
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:34,885
Comrade General Secretary,
I can assure you

106
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:36,470
that Professor Legasov is mistaken.

107
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,390
Bryukhanov reports that
the reactor core is intact.

108
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:41,976
- And as for the radiation...
- Yes, 3.6 roentgen,

109
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,520
which, by the way, is not
the equivalent of one chest X-ray,

110
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,897
but rather 400 chest X-rays.

111
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:49,461
That number's been bothering me
for a different reason, though.

112
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:53,154
It's also the maximum reading
on low-limit dosimeters.

113
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,323
They gave us the number they had.

114
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:58,951
I think the true number
is much, much higher.

115
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:01,620
If I'm right, this fireman
was holding the equivalent

116
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:04,165
of four million chest X-rays
in his hand.

117
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:06,601
Professor Legasov, there's no place
for alarmist hysteria...

118
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,085
It's not alarmist if it's a fact!

119
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:10,546
Well, I don't hear any facts at all.

120
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:14,383
All I hear is a man I don't know

121
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:17,553
engaging in conjecture
in direct contradiction

122
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,638
to what has been reported
by party officials.

123
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:22,099
I'm, uh... I apologize.

124
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:25,144
I didn't mean, uh...

125
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:29,398
Please, may I express my concern

126
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:32,902
as calmly and as respectfully as I...

127
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:35,696
- Professor Legasov...
- Boris.

128
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:37,698
I will allow it.

129
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,751
Um...

130
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,630
An RBMK reactor

131
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:57,259
uses uranium-235 as fuel.

132
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:02,390
Every atom of U-235 is like a bullet

133
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:05,184
traveling at nearly
the speed of light,

134
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,603
penetrating everything in its path,

135
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,772
woods, metal, concrete, flesh.

136
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,151
Every gram of U-235 holds

137
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:17,196
over a billion trillion
of these bullets.

138
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,823
That's in one gram.

139
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:21,909
Now, Chernobyl holds
over three million grams,

140
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,452
and right now, it is on fire.

141
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:29,041
Winds will carry radioactive particles
across the entire continent,

142
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,085
rain will bring them down on us.

143
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:34,296
That's three million
billion trillion bullets

144
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,842
in the... In the air we breathe,

145
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:40,761
the water we drink, the food we eat.

146
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:46,725
Most of these bullets
will not stop firing for 100 years.

147
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,813
Some of them, not for 50,000 years.

148
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:53,816
Yes, and this concern

149
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:58,446
stems entirely from
the description of a rock?

150
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,160
Yes.

151
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:07,830
Hmm.

152
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,376
Comrade Shcherbina.

153
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:15,754
I want you to go to Chernobyl.

154
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,591
You take a look at the reactor,
you personally,

155
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,718
and you report directly back to me.

156
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:23,179
A wise decision,
comrade General Secretary...

157
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,889
And take Professor Legasov with you.

158
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:27,892
Uh...

159
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:31,145
Forgive me, comrade
General Secretary, but I...

160
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,189
Do you know how
a nuclear reactor works?

161
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:36,984
- No.
- No.

162
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,107
Well, then how will you know
what you're looking at?

163
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:41,572
Meeting adjourned.

164
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:42,967
How does a nuclear reactor work?

165
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,302
- What?
- It's a simple question.

166
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,181
It's hardly a simple answer.

167
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:52,518
Of course, you presume
I'm too stupid to understand.

168
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:56,647
So I'll restate.
Tell me how a nuclear reactor works,

169
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,370
or I'll have one of these soldiers
throw you out of the helicopter.

170
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:13,122
A nuclear reactor makes
electricity with steam.

171
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:16,584
The steam turns a turbine
which generates electricity.

172
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:18,544
Where a typical power plant

173
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,879
makes steam by burning coal,

174
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:22,923
a nuclear plant...

175
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,516
In a nuclear plant,
we use something called fission.

176
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:38,814
We take an unstable element
like uranium-235,

177
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:41,567
which has too many neutrons.

178
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,569
- A neutron is, uh...
- The bullet.

179
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,615
Yes, the bullet.

180
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:51,577
So, bullets are flying off
of uranium.

181
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,661
Now,

182
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:57,374
if we put enough uranium atoms
close together,

183
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,670
the bullets from one atom
will eventually strike another atom.

184
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:05,591
The force of this impact
splits that atom apart,

185
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:08,761
releasing a tremendous
amount of energy, fission.

186
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,764
- And the graphite?
- Ah... Yes.

187
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:15,934
The neutrons are actually traveling
so fast, we call this "flux."

188
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,812
It's relatively unlikely
that the uranium atoms

189
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,189
will ever hit one another.

190
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:25,694
In RBMK reactors, we surround
the fuel rods with graphite

191
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:29,948
to moderate, slow down,
the neutron flux.

192
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,037
Good.

193
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,290
I know how a nuclear reactor works.

194
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:41,919
Now I don't need you.

195
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:03,607
Can you help me?
I need to find my husband.

196
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:04,733
No. Not now.

197
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,406
- Mikhail!
- Lyudmilla.

198
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:12,116
Take her.

199
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,201
Take her away from here, please.

200
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,954
Get away from them!
You want to get sick? Go!

201
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:18,441
Please take her, please take her.

202
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:19,832
Please take her, please.

203
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:22,042
Please! Please!

204
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:23,961
Please take her!

205
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,174
Um...

206
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:32,261
Excuse me,
I am Vasily Ignatenko's wife.

207
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,847
He's a fireman. Ignatenko.

208
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:39,268
Ignatenko, Sixth Paramilitary
Fire and Rescue Unit.

209
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,645
I need to find him. Please.

210
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,025
Ignatenko...

211
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,319
He's being transported
by helicopter to Moscow.

212
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,946
Hospital number six.

213
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:53,574
Why, is he all right? Can I see him?

214
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:55,033
You want to see him? Go to Moscow.

215
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,161
But they're not letting us leave here.

216
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:01,623
Tell them Major Burov allows it.

217
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:05,377
When are they taking him?

218
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:07,254
Now.

219
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,578
We're approaching the power plant.

220
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,169
What have they done?

221
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,130
Can you see inside?

222
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:51,757
I don't have to.

223
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:55,761
Look. That's graphite on the roof.

224
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,013
The whole building's been blown open.

225
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,473
The core's exposed!

226
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,433
I can't see how you can
tell that from here.

227
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:03,894
For God's sakes. Look at that glow!

228
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,064
That's radiation ionizing the air!

229
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:08,982
Well, if we can't see, we don't know.

230
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,543
Get us directly over the building!

231
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,985
- Boris...
- Don't use my name!

232
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:14,672
If we fly directly over an open
reactor, we'll be dead within a week!

233
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:15,739
Dead!

234
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:18,325
Sir?

235
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:21,245
Get us over that building,
or I'll have you shot!

236
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,709
If you fly directly over that core,
I promise you,

237
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:29,911
by tomorrow morning,
you'll be begging for that bullet.

238
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:19,845
Perhaps if you came back another day.

239
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:26,643
Just wonderful.

240
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,313
Deputy Secretary Garanin.

241
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:34,234
Ulana Khomyuk of the Byelorussian
Institute for Nuclear Energy.

242
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,402
What a pleasure.

243
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,946
- Let me introduce...
- I'm here about Chernobyl.

244
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:41,909
Such a lovely time.

245
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:44,828
- Visit again, soon.
- I will. Thank you.

246
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:00,510
I must tell you,
this is why no one likes scientists.

247
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,388
When we have a disease to cure,
where are they?

248
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:07,100
In a lab, noses in their books,
and so Grandma dies.

249
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:10,288
But when there isn't a problem,
they're everywhere, spreading fear.

250
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:11,730
I know about Chernobyl.

251
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:12,981
Oh?

252
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:15,901
I know that the core is either
partially or completely exposed.

253
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,320
- Whatever that means.
- And that if you don't immediately

254
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:21,114
issue iodine tablets
and then evacuate this city,

255
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:23,450
hundreds of thousands of people
are going to get cancer,

256
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:25,619
and God knows how many more will die.

257
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:27,204
Yes, very good.

258
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:30,123
There has been
an accident at Chernobyl,

259
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:32,000
but I've been assured
there is no problem.

260
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:33,835
I'm telling you that there is.

261
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:36,004
I prefer my opinion to yours.

262
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:38,590
I'm a nuclear physicist.

263
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:42,844
Before you were Deputy Secretary,
you worked in a shoe factory.

264
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:46,974
Yes, I worked in a shoe factory.

265
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,060
And now, I'm in charge.

266
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:54,690
"To the workers of the world."

267
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:22,426
Stable iodine will keep your thyroid
from absorbing radioactive iodine.

268
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:26,013
Take one a day
for as long as they last.

269
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:27,931
And go east.

270
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,517
Get as far from Minsk as you can.

271
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:05,802
It's overkill.

272
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:08,472
Pikalov's showing off
to make us look bad.

273
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,599
It doesn't matter how it looks.

274
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,185
Shcherbina is a pure bureaucrat,

275
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:15,771
as stupid as he is pigheaded.

276
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:18,332
We'll tell him the truth
in the simplest terms possible.

277
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:19,566
We'll be fine.

278
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,112
Pikalov!

279
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:53,183
Comrade Shcherbina,
Chief Engineer Fomin,

280
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:56,478
Colonel General Pikalov and I
are honored at your arrival.

281
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:57,896
Deeply, deeply honored.

282
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:01,149
Naturally, we regret
the circumstances of your visit,

283
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:03,313
but, as you can see,
we are making excellent progress

284
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,945
in containing the damage.

285
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:10,033
We have begun our own inquiry
into the cause of the accident,

286
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:13,161
and I have a list of individuals

287
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:15,497
who we believe are accountable.

288
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:39,813
Professor Legasov, I understand

289
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:42,190
you've been saying dangerous things.

290
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:43,650
Very dangerous things.

291
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,944
Apparently, our reactor core exploded.

292
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:50,907
Please, tell me how
an RBMK reactor core explodes.

293
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:55,328
I'm not prepared to explain it
at this time.

294
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,456
As I presumed, he has no answer.

295
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,834
It's disgraceful, really.

296
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,296
To spread disinformation
at a time like this.

297
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:13,138
Why did I see graphite on the roof?

298
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,724
Graphite is only found in the core,

299
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:18,727
where it's used as
a neutron flux moderator.

300
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:20,270
Correct?

301
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:25,150
Fomin, why did the Deputy Chairman
see graphite on the roof?

302
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:27,611
Well, that can't be.

303
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:31,656
Comrade Shcherbina,
my apologies, but graphite...

304
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:32,908
That's not possible.

305
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:35,160
Perhaps you saw burnt concrete.

306
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:36,578
Now there you made a mistake,

307
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:39,623
because I may not know much
about nuclear reactors,

308
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,374
but I know a lot about concrete.

309
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:44,711
- Comrade, I assure you...
- I understand.

310
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:47,255
You think Legasov is wrong?

311
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:49,716
How shall we prove it?

312
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:53,887
Our high-range dosimeter just arrived.

313
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:57,224
We could cover one of our trucks
with lead shielding,

314
00:25:58,058 --> 00:25:59,684
mount the dosimeter on the front.

315
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:08,902
Have one of your men
get as close to the fire as he can.

316
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,238
Give him every bit
of protection you have.

317
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:14,824
But understand that even with
lead shielding, it may not be enough.

318
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:18,495
Then I'll do it myself.

319
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:24,960
Good.

320
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:24,746
He's back.

321
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:55,652
It's not three roentgen.

322
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:57,487
It's 15,000.

323
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:00,156
Comrade Shcherbina...

324
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:02,826
What does that number mean?

325
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,828
It means the core is open.

326
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:07,664
It means the fire
we're watching with our own eyes

327
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:09,307
is giving off nearly
twice the radiation

328
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:11,126
released by the bomb in Hiroshima.

329
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:13,044
And that's every single hour.

330
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:16,089
Hour after hour,
20 hours since the explosion,

331
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:17,799
so 40 bombs' worth by now.

332
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:19,217
Forty-eight more tomorrow.

333
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:22,053
And it will not stop.
Not in a week, not in a month.

334
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:23,680
It will burn and spread its poison

335
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:25,849
until the entire continent is dead.

336
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:31,896
Please escort Comrades
Bryukhanov and Fomin

337
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,523
to the local party headquarters.

338
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:35,876
- Thank you for your service.
- Comrade...

339
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,068
You're excused.

340
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:39,571
Dyatlov was in charge.

341
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:42,490
It was Dyatlov!

342
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:45,535
- Tell me how to put it out.
- We'll use helicopters.

343
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:47,425
We'll drop water on it
like a forest fire.

344
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:50,165
No, no, no. You don't understand.
This isn't a fire.

345
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:55,003
This is a fissioning reactor core
burning at over 2,000 degrees.

346
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:56,846
The heat will instantly
vaporize the water...

347
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,089
How do we put it out?

348
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:03,344
You are dealing with something

349
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:07,348
that has never occurred
on this planet before.

350
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:10,852
Boron.

351
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:13,855
Boron and sand.

352
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:17,317
Well, that'll create problems
of its own,

353
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,110
but I don't see any other way.

354
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:21,714
Of course, it's going to take
thousands of drops,

355
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:24,324
because you can't fly the helicopters
directly over the core,

356
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:25,992
so most of it is going to miss.

357
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:28,244
- How much sand and boron?
- Well, I can't be...

358
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:31,664
- For God's sake, roughly!
- Five thousand tons.

359
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:35,210
And obviously, we're going to need
to evacuate an enormous area...

360
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:36,920
Never mind that. Focus on the fire.

361
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:39,047
I am focusing on the fire.

362
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:43,051
The wind,
it's carrying all that smoke.

363
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:45,637
All that radiation.

364
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:48,890
At least evacuate Pripyat.
It's three kilometers away.

365
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:51,017
- That's my decision to make.
- Then make it.

366
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,811
- I've been told not to.
- Is it or is not your decision?

367
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:55,063
I'm in charge here!

368
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,328
This will go much easier
if you talk to me

369
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:58,751
about the things you do understand

370
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:00,860
and not about the things
you do not understand.

371
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:06,658
Where are you going?

372
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:09,953
I'm going to get you
5,000 tons of sand and boron.

373
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:19,671
There's a hotel.

374
00:32:16,394 --> 00:32:17,645
I'd prefer one of those.

375
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:28,031
Superstitious?

376
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:38,833
Moscow?

377
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:44,213
Are you here because of the fire?

378
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:51,512
Anything we should be worried about?

379
00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:57,810
No.

380
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:05,920
<i>We're in position.
Approaching drop.</i>

381
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:08,589
<i>Clear to proceed.</i>

382
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:13,761
<i>Copy.
We'll go one by one in rotation.</i>

383
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:20,727
Remind them about the perimeter.

384
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,607
They cannot fly
directly over the fire.

385
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:29,110
A minimum of a ten-meter perimeter.

386
00:34:29,193 --> 00:34:30,403
<i>Ten-meter perimeter. Copy.</i>

387
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:34,282
<i>Lead One, per pre-flight,
maintain minimum ten-meter perimeter.</i>

388
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:35,867
<i>Copy that.</i>

389
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:39,454
<i>Forty meters, 35, 30...</i>

390
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:44,459
No, no, no.

391
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:46,294
They're too close.

392
00:34:46,377 --> 00:34:48,188
If they can't get over the fire,
how are they supposed...

393
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:49,756
The wind will have to carry it.

394
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,467
Tell them,
they cannot go over the core.

395
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:56,304
Lead One is too close.

396
00:34:56,387 --> 00:34:58,806
I repeat, they are too close.

397
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,141
<i>Copy.</i>

398
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:03,102
<i>Lead One,
you are inside the perimeter.</i>

399
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:07,190
<i>Did not copy.
Signal's breaking up.</i>

400
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:10,026
<i>Lead One?</i>

401
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:12,487
<i>Do you copy?</i>

402
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:14,822
<i>Lead One, do you copy?</i>

403
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:17,700
<i>Lead One, come in.</i>

404
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:19,535
<i>Do you copy, Lead One?</i>

405
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:20,787
<i>Lead One!</i>

406
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:41,474
Sir? What do I tell the others?

407
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:46,103
Is there any other way, Legasov?

408
00:35:54,695 --> 00:35:55,863
Send the next one in.

409
00:35:58,074 --> 00:35:59,659
Tell them to approach from the west.

410
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:03,913
Lead Two,
approach from the west.

411
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:27,186
Kurchatov Institute Laboratory Four.

412
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:31,649
<i>Marina Gruzinskaya,
it's Ulana Khomyuk from Minsk.</i>

413
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:35,194
Oh, yes.

414
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:37,822
How nice of you to phone.
It's been too long.

415
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:39,031
<i>It has.</i>

416
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:41,742
I was actually calling
about our friend.

417
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:44,078
- You know, the one in the country.
<i>- Oh, yes, of course.</i>

418
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:47,707
<i>I wanted to see how he's doing.
It's so hot there right now.</i>

419
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,251
Yes, it's extremely hot,

420
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:51,836
but his nephews are flying down,

421
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:53,838
<i>and they always bring cool weather.</i>

422
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:55,339
Oh, which nephews?

423
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:59,760
Simka, who's 14,
and little Boris, who's five.

424
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:01,679
<i>Well, that's wonderful.</i>

425
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:03,639
Though children can
make you even hotter

426
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:05,308
when they're crawling all over you.

427
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:06,642
<i>Maybe I should visit them.</i>

428
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:08,853
No, they don't want visitors.

429
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:11,022
<i>I'm sorry, um,
I have to get back to work.</i>

430
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:13,024
<i>It's very busy right now. Goodbye.</i>

431
00:37:16,402 --> 00:37:18,738
They're dropping sand
and boron on the fire.

432
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:21,032
It's what I would do.

433
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,994
Yes, I'm sure it is.

434
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,559
Where are you going?

435
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:50,645
Chernobyl.

436
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:01,822
It's been smooth. Twenty drops.

437
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:09,080
What?

438
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:15,336
There are 50,000 people
in this city.

439
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:19,924
Professor Ilyin,
who's also on the commission,

440
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:22,843
says the radiation isn't
high enough to evacuate.

441
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:25,096
Ilyin isn't a physicist.

442
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:27,682
Well, he's a medical doctor.
If he says it's safe, it's safe.

443
00:38:27,765 --> 00:38:30,267
- Not if they stay here.
- We're staying here.

444
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:33,688
Yes, we are, and we'll be dead
in five years.

445
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,907
I'm sorry, I

446
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:46,575
I'm sorry.

447
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:27,116
Shcherbina.

448
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:38,794
Thank you.

449
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:49,263
A nuclear plant in Sweden
has detected radiation

450
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:52,391
and identified it
as a by-product of our fuel.

451
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:55,895
The Americans took satellite photos.

452
00:39:57,271 --> 00:40:00,441
The reactor building,
the smoke, the fire.

453
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:04,695
The whole world knows.

454
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:13,788
The wind has been blowing
toward Germany.

455
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:18,084
They're not letting
children play outside

456
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:21,587
in Frankfurt.

457
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:34,391
Want a smoke?

458
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:53,327
<i>There has been a nuclear
accident in the Soviet Union</i>

459
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,250
<i>and the Soviets
have admitted that it happened.</i>

460
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:56,664
<i>The Soviet version is this,</i>

461
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:58,290
<i>One of the atomic reactors</i>

462
00:40:58,374 --> 00:41:01,627
<i>at the</i> Chernobyl Atomic Power Plant
near the city of Kiev <i>was damaged,</i>

463
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,546
<i>and there is speculation in Moscow</i>

464
00:41:03,629 --> 00:41:06,048
<i>that people were injured
and may have died.</i>

465
00:41:06,132 --> 00:41:09,051
<i>The Soviets may have been fairly quick
to acknowledge the accident</i>

466
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:12,471
<i>because evidence in the form
of mild nuclear radiation</i>

467
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:16,016
<i>had already reached beyond
the Soviet borders to Scandinavia.</i>

468
00:45:31,188 --> 00:45:34,108
I said turn around.
This is a restricted zone.

469
00:45:34,191 --> 00:45:36,485
I'm from the Byelorussian
Institute for Nuclear Energy.

470
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:38,112
Do you have permission?

471
00:45:38,195 --> 00:45:40,697
Listen to me, I need to speak
to someone urgently.

472
00:45:40,781 --> 00:45:41,990
Turn around right now,

473
00:45:42,074 --> 00:45:43,117
or I'll arrest you.

474
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,037
If you arrest me, you should take me
to the highest possible authority.

475
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:54,169
We have to start
a radiological survey.

476
00:45:54,253 --> 00:45:57,923
Sector by sector, on foot,
dosimeters in hand.

477
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:01,260
Are you all right?

478
00:46:04,054 --> 00:46:05,389
Of course.

479
00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:11,019
Comrades... The guards arrested
this woman at the south checkpoint.

480
00:46:11,103 --> 00:46:12,688
I'd have put her in a cell...

481
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:15,107
But he thought you should
know that I know.

482
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:17,151
I know that
your reactor core is exposed.

483
00:46:17,234 --> 00:46:19,987
I know the graphite's on fire,
the fuel is melting,

484
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:22,197
and you're dropping
sand and boron on it,

485
00:46:22,281 --> 00:46:25,200
which you probably thought was
smart, but you've made a mistake.

486
00:46:25,284 --> 00:46:28,620
Ulana Yuriyvna Khomyuk,
Chief Physicist,

487
00:46:28,704 --> 00:46:30,914
Byelorussian Institute
for Nuclear Energy.

488
00:46:30,998 --> 00:46:34,418
And you are
Valery Alexeyevich Legasov?

489
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:36,837
Smothering the core
will put the fire out,

490
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,798
but the temperature will
eventually increase...

491
00:46:39,882 --> 00:46:41,425
Believe me, I'm perfectly aware.

492
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:43,552
But I estimate at least a month

493
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:45,475
before it melts through
the lower concrete pad,

494
00:46:45,554 --> 00:46:46,714
- which gives us time...
- No.

495
00:46:46,763 --> 00:46:49,141
You don't have a month.
You have approximately two days.

496
00:46:50,267 --> 00:46:51,435
Yes,

497
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:53,520
the fuel would take a month

498
00:46:53,604 --> 00:46:55,606
to reach the concrete pad here.

499
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:57,065
But first

500
00:46:58,484 --> 00:47:01,695
it's going to burn through
the biological shield here by Tuesday.

501
00:47:01,778 --> 00:47:03,238
And when it does,

502
00:47:03,322 --> 00:47:06,241
it's going to hit these tanks,
bubbler pools, reservoirs...

503
00:47:06,325 --> 00:47:09,203
Reservoirs for the ECS.
I understand your concern,

504
00:47:09,286 --> 00:47:11,413
but I confirmed it
with plant personnel.

505
00:47:11,497 --> 00:47:13,817
- The tanks are nearly empty.
- No, they were nearly empty.

506
00:47:15,042 --> 00:47:17,878
Each of these points here, here,

507
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:20,589
and here all drain
to the bubbler pools.

508
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:23,342
I'm guessing that every pipe
in the building ruptured.

509
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:26,470
And then there are those fire engines
that I saw on the way in.

510
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:28,639
The fire hoses are still connected.

511
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:32,100
They've been gushing water
into the structure this whole time.

512
00:47:32,184 --> 00:47:33,477
The tanks are full.

513
00:47:34,978 --> 00:47:37,314
The tanks are full.

514
00:47:40,776 --> 00:47:43,487
From the Council of
Ministers of the USSR.

515
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:48,283
An accident has occurred
at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station.

516
00:47:48,367 --> 00:47:51,578
One of the nuclear reactors
has been damaged.

517
00:47:51,662 --> 00:47:55,332
Measures are being taken to address
the consequences of the accident.

518
00:47:55,415 --> 00:47:58,043
Victims are receiving assistance.

519
00:47:58,126 --> 00:48:00,796
A government commission
has been formed.

520
00:48:17,187 --> 00:48:21,400
I have 10 minutes,
then I'm back on the phone

521
00:48:21,483 --> 00:48:24,403
apologizing to our friends,

522
00:48:24,486 --> 00:48:26,863
apologizing to our enemies.

523
00:48:27,948 --> 00:48:31,201
Our power comes
from the perception of our power.

524
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:34,913
Do you understand
the damage this has done?

525
00:48:34,997 --> 00:48:37,040
Do you understand what's at stake?

526
00:48:39,376 --> 00:48:40,627
Boris.

527
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:47,092
Professor Legasov
will deliver our briefing.

528
00:48:49,303 --> 00:48:50,846
There is some good news.

529
00:48:50,929 --> 00:48:53,640
The air drops are working
to douse the fire.

530
00:48:53,724 --> 00:48:57,519
There's been a reduction
in radionuclide emissions,

531
00:48:57,603 --> 00:49:01,690
but the fire will not be extinguished
for at least another two weeks.

532
00:49:04,234 --> 00:49:07,571
There is also an additional problem.

533
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:10,490
Nuclear fuel doesn't turn cold

534
00:49:10,574 --> 00:49:13,285
simply because it is not on fire.

535
00:49:13,368 --> 00:49:14,721
In fact, the temperature
will likely rise

536
00:49:14,745 --> 00:49:17,664
as a result of the blanket of sand
we've dropped.

537
00:49:17,748 --> 00:49:20,584
The uranium will melt the sand,

538
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:22,544
creating a kind of lava

539
00:49:22,628 --> 00:49:25,756
which will begin to melt down
through the shield below.

540
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,507
You have made lava?

541
00:49:29,718 --> 00:49:31,678
I anticipated this.

542
00:49:33,722 --> 00:49:38,143
I believed there was time to reinforce
this lower concrete pad

543
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:41,355
before the lava reached the Earth
and contaminated the groundwater.

544
00:49:41,438 --> 00:49:44,566
But as it turned out, I was
worried about the wrong thing.

545
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,360
Uh...

546
00:49:46,443 --> 00:49:49,988
It was my understanding
that these large water tanks

547
00:49:50,072 --> 00:49:52,783
under the reactor
were essentially empty.

548
00:49:52,866 --> 00:49:55,952
This is Ulana Khomyuk
of the Byelorussian Institute.

549
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:58,205
Thanks to her insight,
we are now aware

550
00:49:58,288 --> 00:50:01,750
that the tanks are, in fact, full.

551
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:05,379
Of water.
Why is that a problem, Professor?

552
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:11,510
When the lava enters these tanks,

553
00:50:11,593 --> 00:50:14,012
it will instantly
superheat and vaporize

554
00:50:14,096 --> 00:50:17,766
approximately 7,000
cubic meters of water,

555
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:21,228
causing a significant
thermal explosion.

556
00:50:21,937 --> 00:50:23,563
How significant?

557
00:50:23,647 --> 00:50:27,401
We estimate
between two and four megatons.

558
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:30,445
Everything within
a 30-kilometer radius

559
00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:32,447
will be completely destroyed,

560
00:50:32,531 --> 00:50:35,909
including the three remaining
reactors at Chernobyl.

561
00:50:35,992 --> 00:50:39,371
The entirety of the radioactive
material in all of the cores

562
00:50:39,454 --> 00:50:42,666
will be ejected at force

563
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:44,793
and dispersed by a massive shock wave,

564
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:48,130
which will extend

565
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:51,049
approximately 200 kilometers

566
00:50:51,133 --> 00:50:54,177
and likely be fatal
to the entire population of Kiev

567
00:50:54,261 --> 00:50:56,054
as well as a portion of Minsk.

568
00:50:56,638 --> 00:50:59,474
The release of radiation
will be severe

569
00:50:59,558 --> 00:51:01,101
and will impact

570
00:51:01,184 --> 00:51:05,439
all of Soviet Ukraine,
Latvia, Lithuania,

571
00:51:05,522 --> 00:51:09,943
Byelorussia, as well as Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary,

572
00:51:10,026 --> 00:51:12,320
Romania, and most of East Germany.

573
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:18,994
What do you mean "impact?"

574
00:51:19,995 --> 00:51:22,581
For much of the area,
a nearly permanent disruption

575
00:51:22,664 --> 00:51:24,374
of the food and water supply,

576
00:51:25,459 --> 00:51:28,295
a steep increase in the rates
of cancer and birth defects.

577
00:51:28,378 --> 00:51:30,881
I don't know how many deaths
there will be, but many.

578
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:33,633
For Byelorussia and the Ukraine,

579
00:51:33,717 --> 00:51:36,386
"impact" means
completely uninhabitable

580
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:38,972
for a minimum of 100 years.

581
00:51:43,477 --> 00:51:46,813
There are more than 50 million people

582
00:51:46,897 --> 00:51:49,608
living in Byelorussia and Ukraine.

583
00:51:49,691 --> 00:51:51,651
Sixty, yes.

584
00:51:55,989 --> 00:51:57,741
And how long before this happens?

585
00:51:58,241 --> 00:52:00,619
Approximately 48 to 72 hours.

586
00:52:05,373 --> 00:52:07,626
But we may have a solution.

587
00:52:07,709 --> 00:52:09,669
We can pump the water from the tanks.

588
00:52:09,753 --> 00:52:12,923
Unfortunately, the tanks are
sealed shut by a sluice gate,

589
00:52:13,006 --> 00:52:14,633
and the gate can only be opened

590
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:16,676
manually from within
the duct system itself.

591
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,055
So, we need to find
three plant workers

592
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:22,557
who know the facility well enough
to enter the basement,

593
00:52:22,641 --> 00:52:27,479
here, find their way through
all these duct ways,

594
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:29,940
get to the sluice gate valve here,

595
00:52:30,023 --> 00:52:34,277
and give us the access we need
to pump out the tanks.

596
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:37,239
Of course, we will need
your permission.

597
00:52:37,531 --> 00:52:39,366
My permission for what?

598
00:52:39,449 --> 00:52:42,035
Uh, the water in these ducts,

599
00:52:42,118 --> 00:52:44,913
the level of
radioactive contamination...

600
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:46,790
They'll likely be dead in a week.

601
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:52,671
We're asking for your permission
to kill three men.

602
00:53:00,804 --> 00:53:02,472
Well...

603
00:53:02,556 --> 00:53:05,725
Comrade Legasov,

604
00:53:05,809 --> 00:53:08,478
all victories inevitably
come at a cost.

605
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:37,150
And open the sluice gate valve, here.

606
00:54:37,943 --> 00:54:41,947
The valve will be difficult
to operate, so we'll need three men

607
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:45,617
who will need to know
the basement layout.

608
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:49,496
And, of course, any volunteers
will be rewarded.

609
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:53,333
A yearly stipend of 400 rubles.

610
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:05,053
And, uh, for those of you working
in reactors one and two, promotions.

611
00:55:05,136 --> 00:55:08,932
Why are reactors one and
two still operating at all?

612
00:55:09,474 --> 00:55:12,769
My friend was a security guard
that night, and, uh, she's now dying.

613
00:55:13,353 --> 00:55:15,605
And we've all heard about the firemen.

614
00:55:15,689 --> 00:55:19,651
And now you want us to swim
underneath a burning reactor?

615
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:22,362
Do you even know
how contaminated it is?

616
00:55:24,698 --> 00:55:26,533
I don't have an exact number.

617
00:55:26,616 --> 00:55:29,828
You don't need an exact number
to know if it will kill us.

618
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:31,191
But you can't even tell us that.

619
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:35,625
Why should we do this?
For what, 400 rubles?

620
00:55:39,254 --> 00:55:41,381
You'll do it because it must be done.

621
00:55:46,553 --> 00:55:49,097
You'll do it because nobody else can.

622
00:55:52,225 --> 00:55:55,812
And if you don't, millions will die.

623
00:55:57,063 --> 00:55:59,399
If you tell me that's not enough,
I won't believe you.

624
00:56:01,234 --> 00:56:05,363
This is what has always
set our people apart.

625
00:56:05,447 --> 00:56:08,366
A thousand years of sacrifice
in our veins.

626
00:56:09,409 --> 00:56:11,870
And every generation
must know its own suffering.

627
00:56:12,912 --> 00:56:15,999
I spit on the people who did this,

628
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:18,001
and I curse the price I have to pay.

629
00:56:21,129 --> 00:56:25,091
But I'm making my peace with it,
now you make yours.

630
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:27,302
And go into that water.

631
00:56:29,846 --> 00:56:31,681
Because it must be done.

632
00:56:48,823 --> 00:56:50,283
Ananenko.

633
00:56:54,621 --> 00:56:56,081
Bezpalov.

634
00:57:01,044 --> 00:57:02,712
Baranov.
