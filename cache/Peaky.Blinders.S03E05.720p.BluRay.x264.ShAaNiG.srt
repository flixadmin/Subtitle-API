ARTHUR: Are you sure the kid is yours?

162
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,890
MICHAEL: (SIGHS)
I wish I hadn't told you.

163
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,209
Then think of marriage
as a beautiful road...

164
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,402
Flowers all the way down it.

165
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,926
- Is he joking?
- It's hard to tell these days.

166
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,845
Do you, er...

167
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,091
Do you love the woman?

168
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,566
Fucking what?

169
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,330
Well, then go and marry her
like the rest of us.

170
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,841
She doesn't want her family to know.

171
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,485
And she doesn't want to have the baby.

172
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,561
We know a woman.

173
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,251
- Shut up, John.
- Same woman who helped you out, twice.

174
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,885
- They weren't my women.
- Mmm-hmm.

175
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,964
That's why you had them fixed, Arthur.

176
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,686
Charlotte will want the best...

177
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,405
- JOHN: She is the best.
- "The best."

178
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,086
JOHN: Used to be a nurse.
Twenty minutes. Done.

179
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,731
And you don't have to go to in
or wait outside.

180
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,326
You go to the Garrison.

181

182
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,166
Remember, John?

183
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,846
And then this kid walks in, no shoes on,
says, "it's done".

184
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,885
Second time we was in there.

185
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,961
Same kid, this time he is wearing
shiny new shoes.

186
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,889
- And he shouts, "It's done, Arthur."
- And what?

187
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,970
She bought new shoes

188
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,611
with the money I gave her.

189
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,971
It was for a good cause.

190
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,561
Arthur?

191
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,968
If you are going to get on
like this with the Apaches,

192
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,405
they'd fucking scalp you, boy.

00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,042
I owe you a little something, don't I?

203
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,724
I do. Come on.

204

I want you to know, right,

211
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,083
that whatever happened
between us, yeah? Back then...

212

- That was business.

And I also want you to know

215
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,282
that I have made my apologies

216
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,687
via my own God
for abusing a very holy day

217
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,208
to get you clinked up and battered,
which I did.

218
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,689
And, now, I would also like to extend
my personal apologies unto you.

219
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,201
All right?

220
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,282
I hear that you have allowed Jesus
to come into your life.

221
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,481
Eh...

222
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,411
Oh, you heard then.

223
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,369
Yeah. That is beautiful.
That is wonderful.

224
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,771
That is lovely, isn't it?

225
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,126
That is lovely.

226
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,885
But I was wondering,
how does that work for you

227
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,566
on a day-to-day considering
your line of work, mate?

228
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,085
Your apology's accepted.

He craves the certainty, even if
that certainty of yours, right...

Well, I mean...

Fucking hell. Look at that. Now, that...

240
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,608
That scares me more...

241
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,361
Yeah.

Congratulations, Tommy.

You now have the finished article
right here, don't you?

244

See, that man, right? He will murder
and maim for you with God on his side.

00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,325
Yeah.

You don't want to let him go.

ARTHUR: If we're gonna do business
with this fucker,

248
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,609
I demand to know why.

249
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,450
TOMMY: Right...

250
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,729
While I was in the hospital,

251
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,329
I formulated a plan.

252
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,130
And this is how it is going to work.

253
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,486
So the Russians cannot be trusted
to pay us.

254
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,087
We are going to take what is ours.

255
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,129
We need to see
what's in their treasury.

256
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,571
And that is why we need Mr Solomons.

257
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,242
(SIGHING) Right, boys, just remember
they are fucking insane...

259
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,642
And drunk on stuff we've never heard of.

260
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,125
And they're worse than us
for spirits and ghosts.

261
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,284
And, today, they're going to test us.

262
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,246

So we should keep what we love, yes?

- JOHN: Nice.
- Right...

276
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,923
Now, some of these tattoos
are proof of allegiance

277
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,289
to underground organisations,

278
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,525
which are the sworn enemies
of the royal household.

279
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,846
So it is customary
in Russian royal households

280
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,289
to check for such tattoos
before engaging a man in business.

not assassins or infiltrators, so...

Yeah.

I wasn't sure that was the reason.

Mr Romanov, let me remind you

497
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,645
we were told to come here
and choose what we like

498
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,685
and now we have chosen.

499

I will give you four.

I tell you what.

I tell you what, I swear at one point...

654
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,968
At one point, I looked down
at the top of her head

655
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,611
and I thought she was going to
pull me cock off in her hand

656
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,523
and fucking throw it out of the window.

They used to run on it
like cars on petrol.

Give them the black country stuff.

It's in the barrel with the tack.

681

they'll put back.

Sent to Flanders from the
Bloemfontein diamond mines.

693
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,131
And the best tunneller I ever met.

694
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,407
So, there's three cellars
underneath the house.

Wine, kitchen and septic.

696
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,523
There's a tunnel here that runs

697
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,082
from the house underneath the river
to an underground strong room.

698
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,731
Now, this used to be
the palace treasury.

699
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,802
The tunnel runs directly west

700
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,770
and it's separated from
the house by three iron doors

701
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,683
with locks we can't open.

702
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,801
We need our tunnel to run from here
and hit the strong room, direct.

Right, would you tell him
that I have taken the car?

709
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,883
He can take the train.

710

he's been so bloody sour lately.

It's not about rules, Pol.

It's about he asked me.

722
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,690
It's about he told me

why he wanted to do it.
