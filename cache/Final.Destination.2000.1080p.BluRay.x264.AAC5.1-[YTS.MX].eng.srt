1
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,042
Alex.

2
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,537
Tod and George's dad just called.

3
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,455
He's picking you up at 3:30 tomorrow.

4
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,584
And the bus leaves the high school
for the airport around 5:00

5
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,889
How's my suitcase working out for you?

6
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,499
Whoa-whoa, momma-momma! 
You gotta leave that on.

7
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,173
Yeah, it's like... you know.

8
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:21,093
The tag made the last flight
without the plane crashing or anything.

9
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:25,490
So I figure it's gotta be on the bag,
or at least, with the bag.

10
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,600
For luck.

11
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,436
Where would you get
a nutball idea like that?

12
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,980
I'm still here.

13
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,007
So 17, on the loose.

14
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,239
Senior trip with your friends in Paris.

15
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,352
Ten days in the springtime.

16
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,870
Live it up, Alex.

17
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,890
You got your whole life ahead of you.

18
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,543
Alex.

19
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,421
Alex.

20
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,107
<i>The white zone...</i>

21
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,235
<i>is for immediate loading and
unloading of passengers only.</i>

22
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,987
<i>No parking.</i>

23
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,782
Yeah, I've been sitting here
for over an hour.

24
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,701
Where are you?

25
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,960
- Hey, Hitchcock.
- What?

26
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,705
Let me give you a hand with this, man.
There you go.

27
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,206
Carter, you dick.

28
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,892
- Schmuck.
- Good one.

29
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,546
- You left this on the bus.
- Oh, thanks.

30
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,256
Come on, let's get your stuff together.

31
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,217
Hey, Christa. Hi, Blake.

32
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:28,095
- What are you doing?
- He's the man. The man.

33
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,888
All right, you guys got everything?

34
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,289
Yeah, yeah. Dad, we're all set.

35
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,872
Does that mean go?

36
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,482
Don't know.

37
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:44,236
Look, this is for both of you, all right?
Have a great time.

38
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,400
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.

39
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,758
- Both of us.
- Let's go.

40
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,092
- Alex.
- Yes?

41
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,092
- You take care of them.
- I will.

42
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,588
You know, I didn't think anything
could look worse than my yearbook photo.

43
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,796
How do you think I feel
having to look at you all the time?

44
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,357
- What the fuck does he want?
- Shh.

45
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,857
"The airport does not
endorse solicitors."

46
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:34,956
Death is not the end.

47
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,487
It will be for you
if you harass my students.

48
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,245
- Hare Rama.
- Fuck off.

49
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:52,054
I have to ask you a few questions
this evening.

50
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,680
Did you pack your bags yourself?

51
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:58,267
-Have your belongings remained
in your possession the entire time?

52
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,655
Mr. Browning?

53
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,828
Oh, yeah.

54
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,429
Have you received any packages
from persons unknown to you?

55
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,067
- Same as your birthday.
- What?

56
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:27,236
September 25, 9:25.

57
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,935
Your birthday's the same
as your departure time.

58
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,434
- Because I looked at him.
- Are you sure?

59
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,643
Lisa, wait up.

60
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,313
No, it's okay.

61
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,731
Fuck, that was good.

62
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,191
Dick.

63
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,360
- Hey.
- Hey, George, Dad said both.

64
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,863
Both of us, all right, man?
Just give me some cash.

65
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,323
Hey, hey, knock it off.

66
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,617
- Excuse me.
- Catch.

67
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,780
You asshole.

68
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,756
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

69
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,060
Alex, let's go take a shit.

70
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,792
- Why don't you go by yourself?
- No, dude. Listen, okay?

71
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,252
Listen, take some knowledge.

72
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,338
We're about to board
a seven-hour flight.

73
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,799
The toilets in coach are barely
ventilated closets, all right, if that.

74
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:56,512
Now, let's say halfway through the flight,
your body wants that food out.

75
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,305
You gotta go torque a wicked cable.

76
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:03,416
And then right after you, like, directly
after you walks in Christa or Blake.

77
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,940
You want them to associate you
with that watery sting in their eye?

78
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,815
That reflexive gag
at the back of their throat?

79
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,581
John Denver.

80
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,298
Died in a plane crash.

81
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:36,301
Ladies and
gentlemen, thank you for your patience.

82
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,470
At this time,
we would like to begin preboarding...

83
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:43,675
of Volée Air Flight 180 to Paris
through Gate 46.

84
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,862
Anyone seen Billy Hitchcock?

85
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,503
How did we lose him?

86
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,861
Go. Go.

87
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,735
Go. Ow.

88
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,944
Ow. That hurt.

89
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,801
Oh, my little baby.

90
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,506
That's a good sign.
The younger, the better.

91
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,049
It'd be a fucked-up God
to take down this plane.

92
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,526
Hi.

93
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,194
A really fucked-up God.

94
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,209
Yeah.

95
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,237
- Hi.
- Hey, Tod.

96
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,580
Hello. How you doing?
I'm gonna sit here.

97
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,459
- Can you switch seats with Christa?
- Oh, God.

98
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,253
You know, I would,
but I got a bladder thing.

99
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:39,132
It's a urinary tract infection.

100
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,771
Let's go ask Alex.

101
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:52,354
Alex, could you trade seats with Blake
so she and I could sit together?

102
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,276
She asked Tod, but he said
he had some sort of medical thing.

103
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,749
Please?

104
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,572
Yeah.

105
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,659
You're so sweet.

106
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:09,121
- Thanks, Alex.
- Thank you, Alex.

107
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,790
You're welcome, you're welcome,
you're welcome.

108
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,286
Fag.

109
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:20,006
Did you really think we're gonna
titty fuck them over Greenland?

110
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:26,054
You know, because of you, I gotta sit here
and watch fucking Stuart Little.

111
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,681
Thank you.

112
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,034
Thanks, man. That's great.

113
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:35,690
Sorry I'm late.
That's my seat right there.

114
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,734
- Hello?
- I'm going that way.

115
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,902
May I have your attention?

116
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:45,252
To properly fasten your seat belts,
slide the flat portion into the buckle.

117
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:51,079
- Equipped with six emergency exits: Two in
front, two over the wing, two in the rear.

118
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,581
All exits are clearly marked.

119
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,876
Follow the red exit signs
and public lighting in the aisle way.

120
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,989
Flight
attendants, prepare for departure.

121
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:46,011
- All right.
- All right, all right.

122
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,717
Yeah.

123
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,644
Whatever.

124
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,230
Huh?

125
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,532
It's okay.

126
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,126
- I wanna go.
- It's fine.

127
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,178
It's okay, honey, I...

128
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,468
What the...?

129
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,668
Oh, my God!

130
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,469
Everybody...

131
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,854
No! No!

132
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,669
Christa! No!

133
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:48,298
Alex, could you trade seats with Blake
so she and I could sit together?

134
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,079
She asked Tod, but he said
he had some medical thing.

135
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,317
Please?

136
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,200
What's up, dude?

137
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,359
- Is there a problem, sir?
- What's your problem?

138
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,818
Alex, qu'est-ce que c'est?

139
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:12,113
- The fucking plane's gonna explode.
- Shut up, Browning.

140
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,532
- You're so not funny.
- If this is your joke...

141
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,326
It's not a joke. It's not a joke.

142
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,954
- Alex, take it easy.
- That's it, sit down, Browning.

143
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,539
- It's going down.
- We will remove you.

144
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,708
- I'll remove him.
- I'll remove myself.

145
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,253
- Excuse me.
- Get off him.

146
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,047
- That's my seat right there.
- This plane is going down.

147
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,466
Everybody in the aisle, off the plane.

148
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,468
- Get off the plane.
- Stay where you are.

149
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,249
- Just sit tight.
- The fucking plane is going down.

150
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,224
Go check him out. See how he's doing.

151
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,531
Okay.

152
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,284
- I got my ticket here.
- Get off me.

153
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,758
Jerk.

154
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,378
- Hey.
- You got this?

155
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,076
No one gets back onboard.

156
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,829
- That's my call.
- Wait, please.

157
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,415
I've got 40 students going to Paris.
Please, please?

158
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,293
- Look, you must understand my position.
- I understand, and I apologize for Alex.

159
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,337
But one of us needs to be on that plane.

160
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,756
I cannot let students
go to Paris for ten days...

161
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,717
Carter, no.

162
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,593
- Sit the fuck down, Carter.
- Sit down.

163
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,757
Sit.

164
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,305
One of you can go on
the flight. That's it.

165
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,278
Larry.

166
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,937
Airline's not taking this well.
They'll let one of us back on.

167
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,732
The rest can take an 11:10 flight.
It gets in three...

168
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,483
I'll stay.

169
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:34,279
No, no, you know the whole French thing.
Get on the plane, it's fine.

170
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,032
Hi, Mr. Murnau.
See, I was in the bathroom.

171
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,117
And the lock, it was stuck, and...

172
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,232
Oh, wait, I didn't fight with anyone.

173
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,355
Damn.

174
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,357
Thanks.

175
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:54,170
I just... I called your parents.
They're on their way.

176
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,400
We should be going.

177
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,935
Alex, talk to me. Tell me what happened.

178
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,288
I saw it.

179
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,441
Like, I don't know. I saw it.
I saw it on the runway.

180
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,984
I saw it take off.

181
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,402
I saw out my window.

182
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,905
- I saw the ground, and...
- Carter.

183
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,492
The cabin, it starts to shake, right?
And the left side blows up.

184
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,607
And then the whole plane just explodes.

185
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:26,164
And it was so real. Just like
how everything happens, you know?

186
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,791
You been on planes that blew up?

187
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,477
You must have fallen asleep.

188
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,504
Whoa, we get thrown off the plane.

189
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,506
We blow, what, a half a day in Paris...

190
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,092
all because Browning
has a bad fucking dream?

191
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,261
But wait, "The plane, it's gonna
blow up, it's gonna blow up."

192
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,305
- Hey, hey, fuck you, Horton.
- Tod.

193
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,016
The only trip you're taking
is to the fucking hospital.

194
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,601
- Get off him.
- Hey, hey.

195
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,954
- Alex, stop it.
- Come on, now.

196
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,001
There they go, here we stay.

197
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,448
- You're paying for my trip.
- I wish you were on that plane.

198
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,229
- You fucking prick.
- Oh, shit!

199
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,442
- Call it in.
- Security...

200
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,664
You're looking at me
as if I caused this.

201
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,104
I didn't cause this.

202
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,187
Are there any survivors?

203
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,201
How should I know?

204
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,085
- What, you think I'm some sort of...?
- He's not a witch.

205
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,883
Hello, I'm Howard Seigel,
National Transportation Safety Board.

206
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,803
We've contacted all your families.
They are on the way.

207
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:50,308
Is there anyone here who feels they
might need a little medical attention...

208
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,685
or spiritual counseling at this time?

209
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,145
What's going on?

210
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,260
Are there any survivors?

211
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,985
Well, the cause for the explosion
is still undetermined.

212
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,446
The Nassau County authorities
are on the scene.

213
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,514
Naval Search and Rescue en route. We...

214
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,992
Excuse me.

215
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,250
I'm Agent Weine. This is Agent Schreck.

216
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,955
We're with the FBI.

217
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,499
I understand how you all
must be feeling right now.

218
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,167
I know it's gonna be difficult.

219
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,962
We're gonna ask you questions
regarding today's events...

220
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,130
while they're still
fresh in your mind.

221
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:26,098
This will prove invaluable to our rescue
attempts and any criminal investigation.

222
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:34,018
You said, "Listen to me.
This plane will explode on takeoff."

223
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,419
How did you know that?

224
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,832
I got this feeling.

225
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,540
This weird feeling.

226
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,570
Did you take any sedatives
before boarding the plane?

227
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,615
Did you take any sleeping pills,
any narcotics, hallucinogens?

228
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,301
- Alex, do you take any drugs?
- No.

229
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,645
I saw it.

230
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,429
I saw it happen.

231
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,377
I saw the plane explode.

232
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,088
Did the feelings
have anything to do with your saying...

233
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:06,818
that you wished that Carter Horton
was on the plane just before it exploded?

234
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,570
- No.
- Then why'd you say it?

235
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,766
Because I really didn't think
it was gonna happen.

236
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:19,067
If that's the case, Alex, then why
did you really get off the plane?

237
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:28,197
My brother, George, he told me
to go and keep an eye on Alex.

238
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:33,165
And so he stayed, and...

239
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:41,261
He told me to get off the plane.

240
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:48,360
Larry Murnau said I should get back on,
but I told him that he should go.

241
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,904
I sent him back on the plane.

242
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,779
All right.

243
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,853
Nobody forced you off the plane.

244
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,106
You said you weren't friends
with those that were.

245
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,697
So, Clear,
why did you get off the plane?

246
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,938
Because I saw and I heard Alex.

247
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,227
And I believed him.

248
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,762
Honey.

249
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,705
Oh, God.

250
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,560
There he is.

251
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,390
Over here.

252
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,475
Thank you for the ride.

253
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,904
<i>You're looking
at the first piece of debris...</i>

254
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,573
<i>to wash ashore
from Volée Air Flight 180...</i>

255
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,743
<i>which erupted shortly
after a 9:25 p.m. Takeoff...</i>

256
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,370
<i>from John F. Kennedy Airport
in New York.</i>

257
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,456
<i>There are no known survivors.</i>

258
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,334
<i>However, Coast Guard
and Naval Search and Rescue efforts...</i>

259
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:31,380
<i>are continuing at this moment even
as jet fuel burns on the ocean's surface.</i>

260
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:34,133
<i>Authorities are pessimistic
about the possibility...</i>

261
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:37,386
<i>of finding anyone alive
from the ill-fated flight.</i>

262
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:41,432
<i>All 287 passengers are feared dead.</i>

263
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:45,561
<i>Amongst the travelers, a class of
40 students and four teachers...</i>

264
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,439
<i>from Mount Abraham High School
in southeast New York...</i>

265
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,935
<i>en route to Paris on a field trip.</i>

266
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,654
<i>There are reports that several students
were removed from the aircraft...</i>

267
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,280
<i>moments before departure.</i>

268
00:25:56,304 --> 00:26:00,785
<i>However, investigators remain guarded
about the specifics of this incident.</i>

269
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,871
<i>Authorities from the National
Transportation and Safety Board...</i>

270
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:07,083
<i>and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation have arrived at JFK...</i>

271
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,627
<i>to begin the initial investigation.</i>

272
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,630
<i>Eyewitnesses at the airport,
as well as on Long Island...</i>

273
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,341
<i>report seeing the plane explode.</i>

274
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,177
<i>No other aircraft
were visibly near Flight 180.</i>

275
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:21,138
<i>At JFK, air traffic controllers
are corroborating...</i>

276
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,974
<i>these eyewitness accounts.</i>

277
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,435
<i>After the explosion...</i>

278
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:28,938
<i>debris apparently rained into the
Atlantic Ocean for several miles.</i>

279
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:32,692
<i>However, investigators are cautious
about verifying these accounts...</i>

280
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:38,753
<i>believing they'll learn more from the
found debris when daylight arrives.</i>

281
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,842
-Thirty-nine days have passed...

282
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:03,347
-since we lost our 39 loved ones,
friends and teachers.

283
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:08,019
-As each day passes without
a determining cause for the accident...

284
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,465
-we ask ourselves, "Why?"

285
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,317
-Ecclesiastes tells us:

286
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:20,531
-"Man no more knows his own time
than fish taken in the fatal net...

287
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:23,200
-or birds trapped in the snare.

288
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:30,207
-Like these, the children of men caught
when the time falls suddenly upon them."

289
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,752
-And so, before we can heal...

290
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:37,381
-before we can escape the presence
of death and time...

291
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:43,252
-we must mourn and celebrate theirs
with this memorial.

292
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,934
I hope you don't think
because my name ain't up on this wall...

293
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,858
that I owe you anything.

294
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,648
I don't.

295
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,523
Because all I owe are these people.

296
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,353
To live my life to the fullest.

297
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,569
Why don't you stay off
the J.D., then, huh, Carter?

298
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:43,656
Listen. Don't you ever fucking tell me
what to do, all right?

299
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,116
I control my life, not you.

300
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,850
Carter.

301
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,287
I'm never gonna die.

302
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,006
Hey, Alex.

303
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,264
- Hey.
- Hey.

304
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:06,262
I took my driver's test last week
at the DMV.

305
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,566
Got a 70. It's the lowest score
you can get, but I passed.

306
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,475
When I was done with the test...

307
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,602
You know the guy that drives with you?

308
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,062
- Right.
- Yeah, well, anyways.

309
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:19,734
He goes, "Young man, you're gonna die
at a very young age."

310
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,039
Yeah. Yeah.

311
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,269
Is that true?

312
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,597
Not now, not here, not ever, Billy.

313
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,539
If I ask out Cynthia Paster,
will she say no?

314
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,291
Fuck.

315
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,502
- Okay.
- Yeah.

316
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,187
Yeah.

317
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,303
- Miss Lewton...
- Don't talk to me.

318
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,560
You scare the hell out of me.

319
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,624
I'm gonna go up.

320
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,986
Hey.

321
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,261
Hey.

322
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,531
I don't want you
to take this the wrong way.

323
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,743
But I miss you, you know?

324
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,240
Yeah.

325
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,674
Yeah, I miss you too.

326
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,458
But my father, you know,
he doesn't understand.

327
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,050
Yeah.

328
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,963
Hey, look, when he gets
over this thing...

329
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:26,217
you and me,
little road trip to the city, you know?

330
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,052
Catch the Yanks.

331
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,472
Yeah. Yeah, all right, we'll do that.

332
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,921
Cool.

333
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,144
- Look, I'd better go.
- Yeah.

334
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:41,304
This thing Miss Lewton showed me in
class, they're gonna let me read it.

335
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:44,370
It says what I'm feeling.

336
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,660
Take care, man.

337
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,980
Because of you, I'm still alive.

338
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,262
Thank you.

339
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:14,706
"We say that the hour of death
cannot be forecast."

340
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:21,230
But when we say this,
we imagine that the hour is placed...

341
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,942
in an obscure and distant future.

342
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:28,445
It never occurs to us
that it has any connection...

343
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:31,115
with the day already begun.

344
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:35,369
Or that death could arrive
this same afternoon.

345
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:39,748
This afternoon, which is so certain...

346
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:45,144
"and which has every hour
filled in advance."

347
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,016
What happened?

348
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,321
Where's Tod?

349
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,385
Alex.

350
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,175
Get out of here.

351
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,492
- Didn't you see it?
- What happened?

352
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:04,174
You caused Tod so much guilt over George
staying on the plane, he took his own life.

353
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,194
- No.
- Time to go.

354
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:11,098
Look, he wouldn't do that.

355
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,449
Okay? He said to me we'd be friends
again after you got better.

356
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:18,272
Why would he make plans with me if he
was thinking about killing himself?

357
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,816
Mr. Waggner.

358
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,527
- Mr. Waggner.
- Here we go.

359
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,451
Easy.

360
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,823
All right.

361
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,343
Here we go.

362
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,914
Let's go.

363
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,941
Almost autumn.

364
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,865
It's only the end of June.

365
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:26,340
Yeah, but everything's
always in transition.

366
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,258
If you focus, one week into summer...

367
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,927
you can feel almost feel
autumn coming.

368
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,613
Kind of like being able
to see the future.

369
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:37,040
Why were you at Tod's house last night?

370
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,274
I've seen enough TV to know that the
FBI doesn't investigate teen suicides.

371
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,943
They were there last night.
They don't have a clue...

372
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,487
what caused the crash.

373
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,113
They haven't ruled out anything.

374
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:53,575
The fact that seven people got off
the plane is probably weird enough.

375
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,329
Not to mention that one of those people
had a vision, or whatever...

376
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:01,625
of the plane exploding minutes before
it did explode, is highly suspicious.

377
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:05,641
And it doesn't help that the visionary's
friend just committed suicide.

378
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,841
Why were you there last night?

379
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,276
Do you know what this is?

380
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,970
This is a...

381
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,618
Who's the spring-head guy?

382
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,985
It's you.

383
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,613
Not a likeness.

384
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:36,284
It's how you make me feel, Alex.

385
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,256
I'm sorry.

386
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:43,375
You know, like you, the sculpture
doesn't even know what, or why, it is.

387
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,710
It's reluctant to take form.

388
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:52,104
And yet, creating an absolute
but incomprehensible attraction.

389
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,930
In four years of high school,
we haven't said one word to each other.

390
00:40:56,954 --> 00:41:00,559
At that moment on the plane,
I felt what you felt.

391
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,853
I didn't know
where those emotions were from...

392
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,443
until you started freaking out.

393
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:10,621
I didn't see what you saw,
but I felt it.

394
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,172
You can still feel it, can't you?

395
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:17,327
Something from that day
is still with you.

396
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:22,006
I know because I can still feel you.

397
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,773
That's why I was there last night.

398
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,771
You know,
I've never dealt with death before.

399
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:35,292
This could all be in our head.

400
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,261
It just feels like it's all around us.

401
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,456
It?

402
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,773
What if Tod was just the first?

403
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,578
Of us?

404
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,013
Is that something that you're feeling?

405
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,779
I don't know, you know.
I just wish I could see him again.

406
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,490
One last time.

407
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,271
So maybe I would know.

408
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,079
Then let's go see him.

409
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,699
Easy.

410
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,369
Gives me a rush.

411
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,790
This place?

412
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:45,089
Doing something I'm not supposed to.

413
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,317
Come on.

414
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,525
Hurry up.

415
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:12,607
- Is that him?
- I think.

416
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,341
Why did they make him up
like Michael Jackson?

417
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,982
Yeah, that's him.

418
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:22,309
But whatever it was that made him Tod
is definitely gone.

419
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,123
Christ.

420
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,957
Shh.

421
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,977
Please.

422
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,830
You'll wake the dead.

423
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,618
Why did his hand do that?

424
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:51,605
Chemicals in the vascular flush
create cadaveric spasms.

425
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,898
Look, um...

426
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:57,013
- I'm his friend and...
- I know who you are.

427
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,333
What are all those tiny marks?

428
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:04,034
Cuticle lacerations
from pulling at the wire.

429
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,161
Pulling at the wire?

430
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:09,247
If he was pulling at the wire,
he wasn't trying to kill himself.

431
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:13,418
- It was an accident.
- In death, there are no accidents.

432
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:16,546
No coincidences. No mishaps.

433
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,232
And no escapes.

434
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:26,514
What you have to realize is that we're all
just a mouse that a cat has by the tail.

435
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:31,061
Every single move we make,
from the mundane to the monumental...

436
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:34,147
the red light that
we stop at or run...

437
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,900
the people we have sex with,
or won't with us...

438
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,679
the airplanes that we ride,
or walk out of...

439
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:45,889
it's all part of death's sadistic
design leading to the grave.

440
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,745
Design?

441
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:54,376
Does that mean if you figure out
the design, you could cheat death?

442
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,670
Alex.

443
00:44:56,694 --> 00:45:00,048
You've already done that
by walking off the plane.

444
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,425
Your friend's departure shows...

445
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:07,013
that death has a new design
for all of you.

446
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:13,883
Now, you have to figure out how
and when it's coming back at you.

447
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,957
Play your hunch, Alex.

448
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:19,275
If you think you can get away with it.

449
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:24,447
But remember the risk
of cheating the plan...

450
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:28,910
of disrespecting the design
could incite a fury...

451
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:32,214
that could terrorize
even the Grim Reaper.

452
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:37,932
And you don't even wanna fuck
with that Mack Daddy.

453
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,926
Okay, then, well...

454
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:47,262
Yeah, I'm sorry we broke in and...

455
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:50,328
No harm. No foul.

456
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,723
I'll see you soon.

457
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,988
The mortician said
that death has a design.

458
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,865
Okay.

459
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,606
I'm talking about omens.

460
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:13,830
How do we know that just by sitting
here, by sipping this coffee...

461
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,583
or breathing the air
or crossing the intersection...

462
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:21,379
that we haven't started in motion
the events that will lead to our death...

463
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:24,017
40 years from now,
10 years from now, tomorrow?

464
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,595
We don't unless we open ourselves up...

465
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,611
to the signs it's willing to show us.

466
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,659
I don't understand.

467
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:39,606
Did you see Tod die?

468
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,609
Did it happen again, like on the plane?

469
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:46,531
No, no, it didn't, but I mean,
it might as well have.

470
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:49,741
This is a message of something, Clear.

471
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:53,161
Or someone, hinting at a design.

472
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:57,665
Total bullshit. I mean, you can find
death omens anywhere you want to.

473
00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:00,168
Coffee.
Starts with a C and ends with an E.

474
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,505
So does the word choke.
So, what, we're gonna choke to death?

475
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,954
I wanna hear you.

476
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,693
We'll go nuts if you
start with this shit.

477
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:12,847
The mortician said
that death has a design, right?

478
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:18,561
Now, what if you, me, Tod, Carter,
Terry, Billy, Miss Lewton...

479
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,772
messed up that design
for whatever reason?

480
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:25,151
I saw death's plan, then we cheated it.

481
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,611
But what if it was our time?

482
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,197
What if we were not meant
to get off that plane?

483
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:32,700
What if it still is our time?

484
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:36,329
If it is, then it's not finished.

485
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:40,708
And we will die now, not later.

486
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,585
Unless...

487
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:46,412
Unless we find the patterns
and cheat it again.

488
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:58,355
After hearing you, I do believe...

489
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,634
that Tod killed himself.

490
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,052
Yeah, I'm fine. Whatever.

491
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:36,806
- You all right, man?
- Hey, baby, come on, not now.

492
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,142
- Carter.
- Oh.

493
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,394
It looks like
we have a bit of a reunion here.

494
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,646
- Let it go.
- When are you moving?

495
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:44,953
A couple weeks.

496
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,399
- That's too bad.
- You dick.

497
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,818
- We're losing our favorite teacher.
- Baby, come on.

498
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,487
Look, guys. There's something
I need to tell you, okay?

499
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:52,013
Alex.

500
00:48:52,037 --> 00:48:54,157
And you lived here
your whole life? Yeah.

501
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,826
And now she's gotta move
all because of Browning.

502
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,996
Enough, both of you.

503
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,253
They died and we lived.

504
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:04,667
Get over it.

505
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:08,969
I will not let this plane crash
be the most important thing in my life.

506
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,823
I'm moving on, Carter.

507
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,011
And if you wanna waste your life...

508
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:18,514
beating the shit out of Alex
every time you see him...

509
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:21,914
then you can just drop fucking dead.

510
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,363
- Okay.
- You look like a smart shopper.

511
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,716
Well, thank you.

512
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,742
Let's just say you were to see
this knife set in a department store.

513
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,408
What do you think you'd have to pay?

514
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,571
Wow, that's a huge knife set,
but how many...?

515
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:51,089
- Hello?
- Is Alex there?

516
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:53,441
Oh, hi, Clear. Yeah, just a minute.

517
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,053
It's Clear again. You wanna talk to her?

518
00:49:57,077 --> 00:50:01,224
The economy kept trading
volume below average today, and stocks...

519
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,977
Clear, he's in the shower.

520
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:08,517
- Can I get him to call you back?
- Sure, bye.

521
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,900
She's concerned about you.

522
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,819
I'm concerned about you.

523
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,696
Why won't you talk to her?

524
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,823
Or me?

525
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,867
- Which could put a cloud
over both stocks and bonds.

526
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,578
Dad, you and Mom
have both been a big help.

527
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:27,500
But there's something I need to understand
before I can talk to anyone.

528
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,003
- The Dow down 75.

529
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:33,297
The National Transportation Safety Board
has a new theory tonight...

530
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:36,968
on the possible cause of the
explosion of Volée Air Flight 180.

531
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:40,096
Officials believe
deterioration of silicon insulation...

532
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,765
on an electrical connector
to the scavenger pump...

533
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,684
may have leaked combustible fluids.

534
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,270
- A spark in the fuel switch...
- That's Tod's seat.

535
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:51,357
in the fuselage may have ignited the
fuel line and proceeded to the fuel pump...

536
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:55,184
which would have set off
the catastrophic explosion.

537
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,423
The path of the explosion.

538
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:32,106
Okay, the first was Tod.
Then it was Terry.

539
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,776
They're dying in the order
they would have died.

540
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,224
That's death's design.

541
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,297
Miss Lewton's next.

542
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,118
And whenever I can
fall asleep, I just...

543
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,615
I see Terry Chaney.

544
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,372
And in the day, out of nowhere...

545
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:51,000
I hear the sound of my own voice
in my head...

546
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,354
saying to Larry Murnau:

547
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:56,130
"No, you know the whole French thing.
Get on the plane."

548
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:59,149
Everything reminds me of that day.

549
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:03,054
Right, yeah.

550
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,639
I'm hoping a change will help.

551
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:10,520
It's just that I've lived here
my whole life, you know?

552
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:13,481
And everywhere I looked
were great memories.

553
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:16,192
And now all I see is Larry...

554
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:20,571
and those kids, you know?

555
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:25,445
Just looking out my own front yard
makes me feel nothing but fear.

556
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:34,210
Laura, I'm gonna have to call you back.

557
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,944
Right.

558
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:47,578
Hi, this is Valerie Lewton.
I need Agent Schreck.

559
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,877
What are you doing here?

560
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,254
I was just...

561
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,716
I was checking the air in the tire
to make sure it's safe.

562
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,308
Get in the car.

563
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,105
Put on your seat belt.

564
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:05,981
I believe that Miss Lewton is next.

565
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,430
- Next?
- Yes.

566
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:14,477
Yeah, next, because there's this pattern
that's occurring.

567
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:18,256
Oh, right, a pattern, yeah.
You noticed that too, huh?

568
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,659
Mom's favorite.

569
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,690
So, what about this pattern, Alex?

570
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,984
Did you see it
in another one of your visions?

571
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:05,526
Did you catch it in some TV static?

572
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:11,548
You know, I never asked
for what happened on the plane.

573
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:15,997
You guys are gonna sit on your little chairs
and make fun of me. Whatever, it's fine.

574
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,916
But I saved six lives on that plane.

575
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:23,171
Six lives, and everybody in my
entire school thinks I'm a freak.

576
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,882
And I'm not... I'm not suffering
from Post-Traumatic Stress.

577
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:30,344
I don't have a narcissistic
deity complex.

578
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:33,597
I'm not going Dahmer on you guys.

579
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:34,951
This just is.

580
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,394
There is a pattern for us all.

581
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:41,272
There's a pattern for you,
there is a pattern for you.

582
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,858
There's a design for everyone.
I don't know how yet.

583
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:46,258
But I'm gonna break this one.

584
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,275
Alex, you came to our
attention at first...

585
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:11,487
because you were under suspicion
in this plane explosion.

586
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:16,033
Now, I know
you didn't blow up the plane.

587
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:21,205
And we were ready to move on, but then
the other survivors started to die.

588
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:23,124
First, your friend Tod.

589
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,709
Then Terry Chaney,
while you were there at the scene.

590
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:28,587
And now tonight we pick you
up at Val Lewton's house.

591
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,965
Alex, nobody has control
over life and death.

592
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:34,510
Unless they are taking lives
and causing death.

593
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:37,718
Now, can you promise me
that no one else is going to die?

594
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,030
No, I can't.

595
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:43,415
As long as I'm in here,
it's out of my control, I'm sorry.

596
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:53,719
Okay, go ahead. Get out of here.

597
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,216
Thank you.

598
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,292
That kid gives me the creeps.

599
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,711
What are we gonna do?
We got nothing to hold him.

600
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,504
That's not what I'm talking about.

601
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:13,665
There were a couple of moments there...

602
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,522
where I almost believed him.

603
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:20,473
Can I tell you something?
Don't take this the wrong way.

604
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,015
But sometimes, you give me the creeps.

605
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,927
You've gotta stop this.
Stop this, it's a stupid mug.

606
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:46,081
You're out of here.
Pretty soon, you'll be gone.

607
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:48,053
You'll be gone.

608
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:01,496
Miss Lewton.

609
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:11,728
Miss Lewton.

610
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:15,564
Okay, all right, okay.

611
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:17,869
Just stay still, okay?

612
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,738
Oh, God. Oh, God. Miss Lewton.

613
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,992
Hey, Alex.

614
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:07,217
Dude.

615
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:11,370
I don't know where he is.

616
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:14,456
- He's not talking to me.
- Why?

617
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,583
Because I didn't believe him.

618
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:17,960
If he does contact you...

619
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:21,630
I think it would be in the best
interest of your safety if you called us.

620
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:24,550
Now, here's my card.

621
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,284
Toll-free number.

622
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,969
Interesting work.

623
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:44,572
Carter, you dick.

624
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:03,523
What are you doing?

625
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:08,052
Terry's name should be on this wall.

626
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,961
Shit.

627
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:16,018
Why'd you want us
to meet you here anyway, huh?

628
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:19,688
Because they're watching me,
see if I go to Alex.

629
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:21,774
That's why you're taking me.

630
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,270
Why would I wanna see him?

631
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:27,336
Because he knows
which one of us is next.

632
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:43,879
So drive the speed limit, okay?

633
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:47,132
Oh, and don't pass on the right.

634
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:49,722
Billy, wait a minute here.
I'm getting a vision.

635
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,002
You're the next one, man.

636
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:54,848
Hey, man, why'd you say that?

637
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:58,818
Because if you say another word,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

638
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,583
He could be anywhere from here
to a mile down.

639
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:24,461
So you guys drive down there,
we'll meet around the middle.

640
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:26,718
It'll take half the time.

641
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:59,019
Do you think they're still up there?

642
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:04,459
Somehow, Flight 180,
are they still in flight?

643
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:08,001
Somewhere, are they safe?

644
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:14,845
When I was a kid, like 6 or 7...

645
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:17,863
I used to worry so much
about my parents dying.

646
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:20,601
Lying awake at night just worrying.

647
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:23,239
Yeah, well, most kids do, I guess.

648
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:26,116
Most kids never have it happen.

649
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:34,656
When I was 10, my dad went into
a 7-Eleven for cigarettes.

650
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,326
I guess that he heard someone say,
"Don't turn around."

651
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:41,152
So on reflex, or thinking
it was a friend joking, he did.

652
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,875
And the guy blew his head off.

653
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,449
Life became shit after that.

654
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:51,307
My mom just couldn't deal anymore.

655
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:53,425
She married this asshole...

656
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:58,013
who my mom with my real dad would
have crossed the street to avoid this guy.

657
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:02,410
He really didn't want a kid.
So my mom didn't either anymore.

658
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:08,106
If that was the design
for my father and my family...

659
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,602
then fuck death.

660
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:15,781
God, I have thought a lot
about that somewhere, Alex.

661
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:19,618
It exists, that place.
Where my dad is still safe.

662
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:24,289
Where he had a full pack of cigarettes
that night and just kept driving.

663
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,875
Where me and my mom
and my dad are still together...

664
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:30,321
and have no idea
about this life here.

665
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:35,018
Where our friends are still in the sky.

666
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:39,253
Where everyone gets a second chance.

667
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:43,281
Alex, we can't give up.

668
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:48,689
Look, I can't go home.

669
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:51,900
All right? After Miss Lewton,
they're gonna be looking for me.

670
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:53,902
No, we're taking you to my dad's cabin.

671
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:55,737
It's only a couple miles from my house.

672
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:58,907
All right, Browning,
you fucking warlock.

673
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:03,286
- Did you know about Miss Lewton, or what?
- Why do you think I was hiding?

674
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:06,456
Billy told the FBI
he saw you running from her house.

675
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,333
I was running because they blame me.

676
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:11,628
They blame me for Tod, they blame
me for her, for the plane crash.

677
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:16,133
The fire, like, caramelized her
blood, Alex. Your shoe prints were in it.

678
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:19,386
- Your fingerprints were on the knives.
- I told you they were not...

679
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:24,141
I'm not talking about whether or not you
did it. Or even if you knew she was dead.

680
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:27,634
Did you know she was gonna be next
before she was?

681
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:35,462
Yeah, I did.

682
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:40,040
- I knew.
- All right.

683
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:43,702
Out of us, who's next to see it?

684
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:48,194
Please, tell me I'm gonna get to see
the Jets win a Super Bowl.

685
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:51,492
It's me, right?
That's why you're not saying.

686
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:56,673
I knew I should have felt up Tammy
in the pool that time.

687
01:07:56,697 --> 01:08:02,164
- What are you whining about? I'm next.
- He didn't say anything. Just drive.

688
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,598
You have a responsibility to tell me.

689
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:07,521
Do you think it's gonna make it
easier to know, Carter?

690
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,912
Huh? It's not,
it's gonna make it fucking harder.

691
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,816
You know, you get off
having control over me.

692
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:19,279
- You let me decide how to deal with it.
- It doesn't matter who's next.

693
01:08:19,303 --> 01:08:22,202
Because we're all
on the same list. All of us.

694
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:27,497
Oh, fuck. Really?

695
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:37,005
All right, then why bother?
What's the fucking point, right?

696
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:41,212
Me and Terry, we'll be back together
on the other side, so why wait any longer?

697
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:43,972
Carter, what are you doing?

698
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:47,891
Carter, slow down.

699
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:50,339
- Slow down, Carter!
- Fuck you.

700
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:55,690
- Knock it off.
- May as well go out on my own free will.

701
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:57,425
Not with us in the fucking car.

702
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,100
- Jesus, Carter, no.
- Stop it.

703
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,509
Carter, stop the car.

704
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,705
Hey, what's the worry
if it ain't your time?

705
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:13,542
I could get nailed
and you all wouldn't give a shit, right?

706
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:16,940
- It's only me.
- It doesn't work that way, Carter.

707
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:27,578
And I fucking hated French class.

708
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,725
- Control yourself.
- That's what I'm doing.

709
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:33,562
I know what you're doing.
And it's all right to be scared.

710
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:36,314
I'm not afraid, all right?
I decide when it's time.

711
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:39,234
I control my life, I control my death.

712
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:42,205
You don't have to prove to us
how big your balls are. Not now.

713
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:49,020
- Carter, stop driving like such an asshole.
- What are you doing?

714
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:54,499
Fuck it, Carter, Jesus Christ.
Carter, put your hands back on the wheel.

715
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,900
- Carter, stop.
- Hands on the wheel, Carter.

716
01:09:58,527 --> 01:09:59,952
Oh, shit.

717
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:03,719
Okay, Carter, easy.

718
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:06,925
I am so close to puking
right now, you don't even wanna know.

719
01:10:09,413 --> 01:10:12,058
We're afraid too, Carter,
but we're not going to quit.

720
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:15,478
Stop what you're doing
and stop this fucking car.

721
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:19,828
Damn it, Carter.
I want you to stop this car right now.

722
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:38,960
- Billy.
- Move it.

723
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:41,922
- Hey, open the door, Billy.
- Move the fucking car!

724
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:44,966
- Hey, open the fucking door.
- Move the car.

725
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:46,178
Open it.

726
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,303
- Open the door.
- Easy, easy, open the door.

727
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:50,805
- Open the door.
- Billy, open the fucking door!

728
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:52,807
- Billy, open it!
- Open the door!

729
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:54,067
Open the door!

730
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:01,081
Carter, listen to me. Don't do this.

731
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:08,865
Goddamn it! Get out of the fucking car.

732
01:11:08,889 --> 01:11:11,618
Carter, listen to me. Hey, listen to me.

733
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:12,830
This isn't the way.

734
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:14,788
It's not the way. Get out of the car.

735
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:16,855
- Come on!
- It's coming, it's coming!

736
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:23,566
- Carter.
- It ain't my time.

737
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:35,684
Oh, shit.

738
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:39,145
Carter, listen to me. This isn't the way.
Get out of the car, Carter.

739
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:41,856
Carter, get out of the car.

740
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,827
Come on, get out!

741
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:53,393
I can't get out!

742
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:59,173
Alex! No!

743
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:06,709
Man, he really is next.

744
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,343
- Get out!
- Get out!

745
01:12:10,367 --> 01:12:12,125
- Come on!
- Fuck!

746
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,867
Oh, God.

747
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:37,495
I saw it. I saw the belt.

748
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:39,914
- Scared now?
- It broke.

749
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:42,876
Bullshit. He saved your life again.

750
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,277
That's right.

751
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:48,423
You're next, Carter.
I'm staying the fuck away from you.

752
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:50,925
- Shut up.
- We don't need this shit right now.

753
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:54,429
I don't need it ever. What are you doing?
Get away from him, he's next.

754
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:56,264
Hey, fuck you, Billy. I'm not dead.

755
01:12:56,288 --> 01:13:00,894
Oh, you will be.
You're dead, you're dead.

756
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:03,627
And you ain't taking me with you!

757
01:13:06,298 --> 01:13:09,435
Oh, shit!

758
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,888
Jesus fucking Christ!

759
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:25,085
You should've been next.
You should've been next after Lewton.

760
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:27,045
That's the plan. That's the design.

761
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:29,422
- You should be dead.
- You're the fucking devil.

762
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:31,348
I saw the seat belt.
I knew it would rip.

763
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,344
That's how I saved him.
Just like the plane.

764
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:35,887
Just like the explosion, I saw it.

765
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:38,056
- The police are coming.
- Fuck, I saved him.

766
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,268
Because I saved him...

767
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:42,977
it skipped Carter, went to the next
in the path of the explosion, Billy.

768
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:44,646
I have to see it.

769
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:48,817
And if I see it, then I intervene.
And if I intervene, I cheat the design.

770
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:51,444
What, intervene?
What are you, God now?

771
01:13:51,468 --> 01:13:53,613
Gods aren't afraid to die.

772
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:56,116
Gods don't die. We do.

773
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,159
- You know?
- Baby, you're losing it, okay?

774
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:00,870
The police will be here.
We have to get you to my cabin.

775
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:02,997
You can hide,
and get your head together.

776
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:07,442
Okay, after Billy, I'm next. I'm next.

777
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:10,839
- And then me.
- Hey, hey, hey, listen.

778
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:12,632
I'm not gonna let it happen, okay?

779
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:15,093
- Listen to me, all right?
- Hey, hey, hey.

780
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:18,254
Why don't you two
just get the fuck out of here?

781
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:13,635
Rusted.

782
01:17:14,212 --> 01:17:16,114
Tetanus.

783
01:17:17,257 --> 01:17:19,063
Nice one.

784
01:17:20,218 --> 01:17:22,405
I overlooked it.

785
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:29,582
You tried to capitalize.
But I caught you, you fuck.

786
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:31,807
I can beat you.

787
01:17:32,105 --> 01:17:38,571
Yeah, I mean, not forever, but I got
this cabin rigged to beat you now!

788
01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:33,685
- She was there a minute ago.
- What are you talking about?

789
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:36,085
I'm not turning him in.

790
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:39,158
It's too dangerous for him
out there alone.

791
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:44,888
- I go with you.
- You can't.

792
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:49,492
Clear, you just tell us where he is.

793
01:18:49,516 --> 01:18:51,285
Wait at home, I give you my word...

794
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:54,922
that we will bring him in safely
in protective custody.

795
01:19:24,384 --> 01:19:26,713
I never moved.

796
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:30,324
Christa asked me to change seats
but I never moved.

797
01:19:30,348 --> 01:19:33,533
I would've been up next to Tod.

798
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:36,038
Fuck, why didn't I remember that?

799
01:19:36,062 --> 01:19:38,676
I never moved.
Clear's seat was in front of mine.

800
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:56,733
She's next.

801
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:36,831
Alex!

802
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,235
Alex!

803
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:43,523
Come on, get in the car.
We're going around. Get in the car.

804
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:44,734
Come on!

805
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:47,037
- Go!
- Move!

806
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:17,121
Oh, shit.

807
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:54,104
- There!
- Come on, let's go, over here.

808
01:21:58,788 --> 01:22:00,391
Alex!

809
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:02,363
Alex, we're trying to help you.

810
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,248
Fritz, get away from it.

811
01:22:19,684 --> 01:22:20,920
Come on.

812
01:22:24,689 --> 01:22:25,829
Alex!

813
01:22:51,675 --> 01:22:53,052
Run!

814
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:40,618
We lost him.

815
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,411
From the direction,
there's only one place he's heading.

816
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:44,955
No shit.

817
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:14,699
Clear!

818
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:29,131
No.

819
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:35,548
Oh, my God.

820
01:25:41,344 --> 01:25:43,768
Don't move. Stay there.

821
01:25:45,056 --> 01:25:47,701
Don't move, don't move.
Don't touch anything.

822
01:25:47,725 --> 01:25:49,959
You're grounded by the tires, okay?

823
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:22,097
The car's gonna explode.

824
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:28,576
I can only hold on for so long,
you know what to do.

825
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,244
Don't!

826
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:32,705
When I do this, it'll skip you,
and it'll be over.

827
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:36,542
- It's the only way we can cheat death again.
- No, don't!

828
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:40,606
Clear, I am not gonna let it beat us both.
You know what to do.

829
01:26:42,906 --> 01:26:45,376
I'll always be with you.

830
01:26:48,494 --> 01:26:49,682
No!

831
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:57,047
Alex! Alex, get away from there.

832
01:26:57,712 --> 01:26:59,470
No!

833
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:20,108
Alex. Alex.

834
01:27:22,695 --> 01:27:25,758
Damn it, you can't do this to me.

835
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:28,302
Come on, baby. Come on.

836
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:29,845
Alex, Alex?

837
01:27:29,869 --> 01:27:34,183
Alex, Alex?
Oh, shit, he's not breathing.

838
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:37,201
Hold on, Alex. Come on, stay with me.

839
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:16,809
- Well, we made it.
- Paris, I can't believe it.

840
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:19,019
I just can't believe
we got on a plane again.

841
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:21,324
You know what I'm saying?

842
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:49,475
Wow.

843
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:51,385
It's weird being here, huh?

844
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:54,071
We finally completed a puzzle.

845
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:59,607
It's just there's something missing,
you know?

846
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:03,314
- To Terry.
- Yeah.

847
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:06,483
- To Tod.
- To all of our friends that can't be here.

848
01:29:06,507 --> 01:29:09,169
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

849
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:12,909
What?

850
01:29:13,806 --> 01:29:15,909
If you would have told me
six months ago...

851
01:29:15,933 --> 01:29:19,204
that the three of us
would be sitting here having a drink...

852
01:29:19,228 --> 01:29:20,512
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

853
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:23,167
I mean, sometimes it just feels
like the two of you...

854
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:26,138
are the only ones
who can really understand.

855
01:29:29,155 --> 01:29:34,094
You were right, Browning.
It did skip us. There was a design.

856
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:36,685
We beat it. You know, we won.

857
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:41,210
I think the only thing we won, Carter,
is a chance at a full life.

858
01:29:41,959 --> 01:29:45,048
A chance that I won't ever waste.

859
01:29:45,088 --> 01:29:48,275
Yeah, there's just something...

860
01:29:48,299 --> 01:29:50,527
You know, something I can't figure out.

861
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:53,030
- What?
- About the design.

862
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:55,991
Alex, just let it go. All right?

863
01:29:56,015 --> 01:29:58,581
I swear... Just hear me out, all right?

864
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:02,164
- Oh, my God.
- It's just... Listen.

865
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:06,752
Now, the path of the explosion determined
the order of our deaths, right?

866
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:08,921
When I intervened and saved Carter...

867
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:12,591
it skipped him and went to the
next person in the path. It went to Billy.

868
01:30:12,615 --> 01:30:14,469
All right, and then it was Clear.

869
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:18,555
But I intervened and saved her,
so it went to me, but in my case...

870
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:21,225
no one intervened, right?

871
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:24,353
I was thrown from that power line
by the explosion.

872
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:27,272
- So...
- So why did it skip you, right?

873
01:30:27,296 --> 01:30:30,734
How do we know that this isn't exactly
what was meant to happen?

874
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:35,131
That out of everyone on Flight 180,
you, me and Carter were meant to live.

875
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:38,461
Maybe that was the design all along.

876
01:30:39,183 --> 01:30:42,035
- Or you could still be next.
- Shut up, Carter.

877
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,373
What? I didn't make up the rules.

878
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:47,042
Somebody's gotta intervene
before death can skip them.

879
01:30:47,066 --> 01:30:50,462
Alex proved that three times.
In the plane, with me, you.

880
01:30:50,486 --> 01:30:53,799
For all I know, it could circle back
and get us all again.

881
01:30:53,823 --> 01:31:00,145
But I am the safest fucker in the world
because you're still next.

882
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:06,270
Can we just stop talking about this?

883
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:08,860
Let's figure out
what we're gonna do tomorrow.

884
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:26,540
I'm gonna meet you back at the hotel.

885
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:29,710
- Just wait, I'll go with you.
- No, just stay here.

886
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:31,503
Okay, Clear? Just stay here.

887
01:31:31,527 --> 01:31:32,763
All right?

888
01:31:32,778 --> 01:31:35,716
See, it's true.
I told you you were next, man.

889
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:36,927
Stop it, Carter.

890
01:31:36,949 --> 01:31:39,553
- Alex, wait.
- No, Clear, stay there.

891
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:42,809
Okay? Stay away.

892
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:50,608
Alex!

893
01:32:09,732 --> 01:32:10,920
Alex!

894
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:16,240
I told you, you were next.

895
01:32:16,822 --> 01:32:19,817
- Then it just skipped me.
- So who's next?
