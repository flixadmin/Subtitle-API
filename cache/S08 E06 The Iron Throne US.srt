1
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,572
I'll find you later.

2
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:03,743
It's not safe.

3
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,623
Let me send some men with you.

4
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:13,962
I'm going alone.

5
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,386
In the name of the one true queen,
Daenerys Targaryen,

6
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,139
I sentence you to die.

7
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,391
Grey Worm!

8
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,691
It's over.

9
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,027
These men are prisoners.

10
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,654
It is not over until the queen's enemies
are defeated.

11
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,074
How much more defeated
do you want them to be?

12
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,992
-They're on their knees.
-They are breathing.

13
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,287
Look around you, friend. We won.

14
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,166
-I obey my queen's commands, not yours.
-And what are the queen's commands?

15
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,837
"Kill all who follow Cersei Lannister."

16
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,340
These are free men.

17
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:42,842
They chose to fight for her.

18
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,890
Easy, men. Easy! Easy.

19
00:05:58,858 --> 00:05:59,818
Jon.

20
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,822
We should speak with the queen.

21
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,363
Jon!

22
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,043
Torgo Nudho.

23
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,664
You freed your brother.

24
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,667
You committed treason.

25
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,171
I freed my brother.

26
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,676
And you slaughtered a city.

27
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,208
What are you doing here?

28
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,214
Hey, what happened?

29
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,175
I came to kill Cersei.

30
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,261
Your queen got there first.

31
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,726
She's everyone's queen now.

32
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,770
Try telling Sansa.

33
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,988
Wait for me outside the city gates.
I'll come find you.

34
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,031
Jon.

35
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,493
She knows who you are.

36
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,120
Who you really are.

37
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,581
You'll always be a threat to her.

38
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,919
And I know a killer when I see one.

39
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,537
Did you bring any wine?

40
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,248
No.

41
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,419
Well…

42
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,589
thank you for coming to see me.

43
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,719
Our queen doesn't keep prisoners
for long.

44
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,432
I suppose there's a crude kind of justice.

45
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,395
I betrayed my closest friend
and watched him burn.

46
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,940
Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes,

47
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,651
"See, I told you."

48
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,074
It just occurred to me.

49
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,619
I'm talking to the only man alive
who knows where I'm going.

50
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,915
So, is there life after death?

51
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,628
Not that I've seen.

52
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,506
I should be thankful.

53
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,801
Oblivion is the best I could hope for.

54
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,221
I strangled my lover.

55
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,476
I shot my own father with a crossbow.
I betrayed my queen.

56
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,977
-You didn't.
-I did.

57
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,690
And I'd do it again,
now that I've seen what I've seen.

58
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,860
I chose my fate.

59
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,696
The people of King's Landing did not.

60
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,659
I can't justify what happened.

61
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:10,746
I won't try.

62
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,627
-But the war is over now.
-Is it?

63
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,381
When you heard her talking
to her soldiers,

64
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:25,010
did she sound like someone
who's done fighting?

65
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,063
She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay.

66
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,857
She liberated the people
of King's Landing.

67
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:43,779
And she'll go on liberating
until the people of the world are free,

68
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,365
and she rules them all.

69
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,659
And you've been by her side,
counseling her.

70
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,577
Until today.

71
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,539
Until today.

72
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,379
Varys was right. I was wrong.

73
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,632
It was vanity to think I could guide her.

74
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,635
Our queen's nature is fire and blood.

75
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,138
You think our house words
are stamped on our bodies

76
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,889
when we're born and that's who we are?

77
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,475
Then I'd be fire and blood, too.

78
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,397
She's not her father,
no more than you're Tywin Lannister.

79
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,985
My father was an evil man.
My sister was an evil woman.

80
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,613
Pile up all the bodies
of all the people they ever killed,

81
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,242
there still won't be half as many
as our beautiful queen slaughtered

82
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,744
-in a single day.
-Cersei left her no choice.

83
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,289
The moment the gates fell,
the battle was over.

84
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,874
She saw her friend beheaded.

85
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:41,336
-She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.
-And she burned down a city for it.

86
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,090
It's easy to judge when you're standing
far from the battlefield.

87
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,175
Would you have done it?

88
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,344
What?

89
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,807
You've been up there, on a dragon's back.

90
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:57,436
You've had that power.
Would you have burned the city down?

91
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,065
I don't know.

92
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,568
Yes, you do.

93
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,573
You won't say
because you don't want to betray her…

94
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,618
but you know.

95
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:22,794
What's it matter what I'd do?

96
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,256
It matters more than anything.

97
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,597
When she murdered
the slavers of Astapor,

98
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,351
I'm sure no one
but the slavers complained.

99
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,186
After all, they were evil men.

100
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:45,859
When she crucified hundreds
of Meereenese nobles, who could argue?

101
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,236
They were evil men.

102
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:51,531
The Dothraki khals she burned alive?

103
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,368
They would have done worse to her.

104
00:24:56,536 --> 00:25:02,626
Everywhere she goes, evil men die
and we cheer her for it.

105
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:08,882
And she grows more powerful
and more sure that she is good and right.

106
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:18,558
She believes her destiny
is to build a better world for everyone.

107
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,394
If you believed that…

108
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,647
if you truly believed it,

109
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,067
wouldn't you kill whoever stood
between you and paradise?

110
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,392
I know you love her.

111
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,774
I love her too.

112
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,532
Not as successfully as you…

113
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:22,956
but I believed in her with all my heart.

114
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,884
Love is more powerful than reason.

115
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:37,846
We all know that.

116
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,015
Look at my brother.

117
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,272
"Love is the death of duty."

118
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,197
You just came up with that?

119
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:03,872
Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.

120
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:14,091
Sometimes duty is the death of love.

121
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:23,141
You are the shield
that guards the realms of men.

122
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,186
You've always tried to do the right thing.

123
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,854
No matter the cost,

124
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,774
you've tried to protect people.

125
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,321
Who is the greatest threat
to the people now?

126
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,581
It's a terrible thing I'm asking.

127
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,043
It's also the right thing.

128
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,715
Do you think I'm the last man
she'll execute?

129
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,264
Who is more dangerous
than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?

130
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:18,238
That's her decision. She is the queen.

131
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,957
I'm sorry it came to this.

132
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,387
And your sisters?

133
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,058
Do you see them bending the knee?

134
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,607
My sisters will be loyal to the throne.

135
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,276
Why do you think Sansa told me
the truth about you?

136
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,279
Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.

137
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,323
-She doesn't get to choose.
-No.

138
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,450
But you do.

139
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,995
And you have to choose now.

140
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,113
When I was a girl,
my brother told me it was made

141
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,991
with a thousand swords
from Aegon's fallen enemies.

142
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,329
What do a thousand swords look like

143
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,665
in the mind of a little girl
who can't count to 20?

144
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,795
I imagined a mountain of swords
too high to climb.

145
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,006
So many fallen enemies,

146
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,175
you could only see
the soles of Aegon's feet.

147
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,844
I saw them executing Lannister prisoners
in the street.

148
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,347
They said they were acting
on your orders.

149
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,642
-It was necessary.
-Necessary?

150
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,979
Have you been down there? Have you seen?

151
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,566
Children, little children, burned!

152
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,446
I tried to make peace with Cersei.

153
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:56,242
She used their innocence
as a weapon against me.

154
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,370
-She thought it would cripple me.
-And Tyrion?

155
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,044
He conspired behind my back
with my enemies.

156
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,881
How have you treated people
who've done the same to you,

157
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,966
even when it broke your heart?

158
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,262
Forgive him.

159
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,683
-I can't.
-You can.

160
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,730
You can forgive all of them,
make them see they made a mistake.

161
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:27,857
Make them understand.

162
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,364
Please, Dany.

163
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,453
We can't hide behind small mercies.

164
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,832
The world we need

165
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,335
won't be built by men
loyal to the world we have.

166
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:51,005
The world we need
is a world of mercy. It has to be.

167
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,590
And it will be.

168
00:34:55,927 --> 00:35:00,515
It's not easy to see something
that's never been before.

169
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,727
A good world.

170
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,063
How do you know?

171
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,067
How do you know it'll be good?

172
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,444
Because I know what is good.

173
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,197
And so do you.

174
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,074
-I don't.
-You do.

175
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,535
You do. You've always known.

176
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,331
What about everyone else?

177
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,211
All the other people
who think they know what's good.

178
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,799
They don't get to choose.

179
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,432
Be with me.

180
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:47,812
Build the new world with me.
This is our reason.

181
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,398
It has been from the beginning,

182
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,026
since you were a little boy
with a bastard's name,

183
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:56,404
and I was a little girl
who couldn't count to 20.

184
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,407
We do it together.

185
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,495
We break the wheel together.

186
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,208
You are my queen.

187
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,463
Now, and always.

188
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,281
Where's Jon?

189
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,826
-He is our prisoner.
-So is Lord Tyrion.

190
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,870
They were both to be brought
to this gathering.

191
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,081
We will decide what we do
with our prisoners.

192
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:47,041
This is our city now.

193
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,877
If you look outside the walls
of your city,

194
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,421
you'll find thousands of Northmen
who will explain to you

195
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:56,300
why harming Jon Snow
is not in your interest.

196
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:59,095
And you will find thousands
of Unsullied who believe that it is.

197
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:01,180
Some of you may be quick to forgive.

198
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,432
The Ironborn are not.

199
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,770
-I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.
-You swore to follow a tyrant.

200
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,397
She freed us from a tyrant.

201
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:13,526
Cersei is gone because of her,
and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart.

202
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,278
Let the Unsullied give him
what he deserves.

203
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,615
Say another word about killing
my brother and I'll cut your throat.

204
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:20,950
Friends, please.

205
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,329
We've been cutting
each other's throats long enough.

206
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:29,041
Torgo Nudho.
Am I saying that properly?

207
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,422
If it weren't for you and your men,

208
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,424
we would've lost the war
with the dead.

209
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:41,345
This country owes you a debt
it can never repay but let us try.

210
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,306
There is land in the Reach. Good land.

211
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:46,475
The people that used to live there
are gone.

212
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:48,477
Make it your own.

213
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:51,147
Start your own house
with the Unsullied as your bannermen.

214
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:55,985
We've had enough war.
Thousands of you, thousands of them.

215
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,486
You know how it ends.

216
00:44:58,279 --> 00:44:59,822
We need to find a better way.

217
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,532
We do not need payment.

218
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,617
We need justice.

219
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,829
Jon Snow cannot go free.

220
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:13,461
-It's not for you to decide.
-You are not here to speak!

221
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,755
Everyone has heard enough words from you.

222
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,426
You're right.

223
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,554
And no one's any better for it.

224
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:27,183
But it's not for you to decide.

225
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:30,644
Jon committed his crime here.

226
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:34,023
His fate is for our king to decide.

227
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:38,360
-Or our queen.
-We don't have a king or queen.

228
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,114
You're the most powerful people
in Westeros.

229
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,160
Choose one.

230
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,630
Make your choice, then.

231
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,112
My lords and ladies…

232
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:29,453
I suppose this is the most important
moment of our lives.

233
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:34,083
What we decide today will reverberate
through the annals of history.

234
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:38,879
I stand before you as one
of the senior lords in the country.

235
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:41,841
A veteran of two wars.

236
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:48,264
And I like to think my experience
has led to some small skill in statecraft

237
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,015
-and underst--
-Uncle?

238
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,186
Please sit.

239
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,137
Well, we have to choose someone.

240
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,098
Why just us?

241
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:42,610
We represent all the great houses,
but whoever we choose,

242
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,903
they won't just rule over
lords and ladies.

243
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:49,325
Maybe the decision
about what's best for everyone

244
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,534
should be left to…

245
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:53,621
well, everyone.

246
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,596
Maybe we should give the dogs
a vote as well.

247
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,431
I'll ask my horse.

248
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:23,275
I suppose you want the crown.

249
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,194
Me?

250
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,321
The Imp?

251
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,950
Half the people hate me
for serving Daenerys,

252
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,911
the other half hate me for betraying her.

253
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:38,999
-Can't think of a worse choice.
-Who, then?

254
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:50,052
I've had nothing to do but think
these past few weeks.

255
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,389
About our bloody history.

256
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,559
About the mistakes we've made.

257
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,447
What unites people?

258
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,451
Armies?

259
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:17,454
Gold?

260
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:21,375
Flags?

261
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,758
Stories.

262
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,472
There's nothing in the world
more powerful than a good story.

263
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,309
Nothing can stop it.

264
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,688
No enemy can defeat it.

265
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,233
And who has a better story…

266
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:49,069
than Bran the Broken?

267
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,243
The boy who fell from a high tower
and lived.

268
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:01,915
He knew he'd never walk again,
so he learned to fly.

269
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,795
He crossed beyond the Wall,
a crippled boy,

270
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,339
and became the Three-Eyed Raven.

271
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:16,388
He is our memory,
the keeper of all our stories.

272
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:21,310
The wars, weddings, births,
massacres, famines.

273
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,103
Our triumphs,

274
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,230
our defeats,

275
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,232
our past.

276
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,779
Who better to lead us into the future?

277
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:38,577
Bran has no interest in ruling
and he can't father children.

278
00:50:38,911 --> 00:50:39,870
Good.

279
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:44,041
Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid,
as you well know.

280
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,877
His will never torment us.

281
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:54,134
That is the wheel
our queen wanted to break.

282
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,311
From now on, rulers will not be born.

283
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:10,359
They will be chosen on this spot
by the lords and ladies of Westeros

284
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,277
to serve the realm.

285
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,955
I know you don't want it.

286
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:27,709
I know you don't care about power.

287
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:33,674
But I ask you now,
if we choose you…

288
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:36,844
will you wear the crown?

289
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,890
Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms
to the best of your abilities

290
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:44,268
from this day until your last day?

291
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,401
Why do you think I came all this way?

292
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:01,618
To Brandon of House Stark…

293
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:04,538
I say aye.

294
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:17,301
Aye.

295
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:24,933
Aye.

296
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,227
Aye.

297
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:31,398
Aye.

298
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:35,277
Aye.

299
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,033
Aye.

300
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,701
Aye.

301
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,411
Aye.

302
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:46,705
-Aye.
-Aye.

303
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:47,748
Aye.

304
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,919
I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye.

305
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,380
Aye.

306
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:10,228
I love you, little brother. I always will.
You'll be a good king.

307
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:15,275
But tens of thousands of Northmen fell
in the Great War

308
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,818
defending all of Westeros.

309
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:21,740
And those who survived have seen too much
and fought too hard ever to kneel again.

310
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:27,496
The North will remain
an independent kingdom,

311
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,374
as it was for thousands of years.

312
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,609
All hail Bran the Broken,

313
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:02,114
First of His Name, King of the Andals
and the First Men,

314
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:07,786
Lord of the Six Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

315
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,625
-All hail Bran the Broken!
-All hail Bran the Broken!

316
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:26,680
Lord Tyrion…

317
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,100
you will be my Hand.

318
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:35,397
No, Your Grace, I don't want it.

319
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:37,441
And I don't want to be king.

320
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,153
I don't deserve it.

321
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:45,282
I thought I was wise, but I wasn't.

322
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:49,077
I thought I knew what was right,
but I didn't.

323
00:54:51,747 --> 00:54:54,624
Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else--

324
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,501
-I choose you.
-You cannot.

325
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,003
Yes, I can.

326
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,839
-I'm king.
-This man is a criminal.

327
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,759
-He deserves justice.
-He just got it.

328
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:06,720
He's made many terrible mistakes.

329
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:10,015
He's going to spend
the rest of his life fixing them.

330
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:16,480
It is not enough.

331
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:27,699
Giving you to the Unsullied
would start a war.

332
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:31,411
Letting you walk free would start a war.

333
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,665
So our new king has chosen
to send you to the Night's Watch.

334
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,419
There's still a Night's Watch?

335
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:45,092
The world will always need a home
for bastards and broken men.

336
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:53,100
You shall take no wife, hold no lands,

337
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:55,727
father no children.

338
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:01,149
The Unsullied wanted your head, of course,

339
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:05,237
but Grey Worm has accepted
the justice of a life sentence.

340
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,032
Sansa and Arya wanted you freed,

341
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:13,578
but they understand our new king
needs to make peace.

342
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,872
No one is very happy.

343
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,501
Which means it's a good compromise,
I suppose.

344
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:22,963
Was it right?

345
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:27,509
What I did?

346
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:31,888
What we did.

347
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,686
It doesn't feel right.

348
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,611
Ask me again in ten years.

349
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,554
I don't expect
we'll ever see each other again.

350
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:18,685
I wouldn't be so sure.

351
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,396
A few years as Hand of the King

352
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,982
would make anyone want to piss off
the edge of the world.

353
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,332
I wish there'd been another way.

354
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:48,793
Can you forgive me?

355
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,558
The North is free, thanks to you.

356
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,187
But they lost their king.

357
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:11,566
Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them.

358
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:15,862
She's the best they could ask for.

359
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:39,552
You can come see me, you know,
at Castle Black.

360
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:41,763
I can't.

361
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:45,642
You think anyone will dare tell you
women aren't allowed?

362
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:53,191
I'm not going back north.

363
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,361
Where are you going?

364
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,407
What's west of Westeros?

365
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:04,452
I don't know.

366
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:06,204
No one knows.

367
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,082
It's where all the maps stop.

368
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,044
That's where I'm going.

369
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:23,596
You have your Needle?

370
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:25,974
Right here.

371
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,330
Your Grace.

372
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:00,967
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you needed me.

373
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,930
You were exactly
where you were supposed to be.

374
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:21,144
That's not…

375
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:30,027
-What's this?
-A Song of Ice and Fire.

376
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:34,824
Archmaester Ebrose's history of the wars
following the death of King Robert.

377
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,243
I helped him with the title.

378
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:43,040
I suppose I come in
for some heavy criticism.

379
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:44,959
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

380
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:48,045
Oh, he's kind to me.
Never would've guessed.

381
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:53,426
He's not kind?

382
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,304
-He--
-He what?

383
01:06:57,597 --> 01:06:58,973
What does he say about me?

384
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,774
I don't believe you're mentioned.

385
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:31,464
-Your Grace.
-Your Grace.

386
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:32,673
-Your Grace.
-Your Grace.

387
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:53,903
We appear to be missing
a Master of Whisperers.

388
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:55,822
And a Master of Laws.

389
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,116
-And a Master of War.
-Yes, Your Grace.

390
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,036
Suitable prospects will be brought to you
for an audience in the coming weeks.

391
01:08:03,996 --> 01:08:06,123
And Drogon? Any word?

392
01:08:06,707 --> 01:08:08,584
He was last spotted flying east,
toward--

393
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:10,002
The farther away, the better.

394
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,297
Perhaps I can find him.

395
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:15,758
Do carry on with the rest.

396
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:18,636
As you wish, Your Grace.

397
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:22,431
Ser Podrick.

398
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:33,776
We serve at your pleasure,
King Bran the Broken,

399
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,696
ruler of the Six Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

400
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:39,907
-Long may he reign.
-Long may he reign.

401
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:41,784
-Long may he reign.
-Long may he reign.

402
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:42,910
Long may he reign.

403
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:46,038
That will improve.

404
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:48,165
I'm sure it will.

405
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:59,552
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,
Lord of Highgarden,

406
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:02,471
Lord Paramount of the Reach
and Master of Coin,

407
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:06,517
would you say the crown's debt to you
has been paid?

408
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:08,978
-In full, my lord Hand.
-Good.

409
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:13,232
Time to start incurring a new one.
We have hungry people to feed.

410
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:15,026
Can we expect some assistance
in this regard?

411
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:16,110
Indeed, we can.

412
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:20,364
Lord Davos, we have an armada
to rebuild and ports to repair.

413
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:22,617
We have. These projects will begin as soon

414
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:26,537
as the Master of Coin
and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.

415
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:29,290
The Master of Coin looks forward
to helping the Master of Ships,

416
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:32,043
but first he has to ensure
we're not wasting coin,

417
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:34,879
-or soon there won't be no more coin.
-"Any more."

418
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:37,256
-You Master of Grammar now too?
-Grandmaester,

419
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:42,428
it is my theory, based on my years
of work on the Casterly Rock sewers,

420
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,513
that clean water leads
to a healthier population.

421
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:47,141
The Archmaester has done some research
on this subject,

422
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:49,560
-and it turns out--
-The strong live and the weak don't.

423
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:52,772
Find the best builders
and set them to the task.

424
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:55,733
Oh, speaking of builders,
all the best brothels burned down.

425
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:59,487
The Master of Coin
is willing to fund reconstruction.

426
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:04,283
The Archmaester is less than enthusiastic
about the salutary effects of brothels.

427
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:06,410
Well, I imagine
he isn't using them properly.

428
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:10,665
I think we can all agree that ships
take precedence over brothels.

429
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,084
I think
that's a very presumptuous statement.

430
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:18,297
I once brought a jackass
and a honeycomb into a brothel.

431
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:42,269
-The Queen in the North!
-The Queen in the North!

432
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:45,481
The Queen in the North!
The Queen in the North!

433
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:48,817
The Queen in the North!
The Queen in the North!
