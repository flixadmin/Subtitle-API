1
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Tell me!

2
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Why are you standing in my way, Julius?

3
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
'Cause the calamity you’re attempting
to bring about is unjust, Conrad.

4
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Can’t you see that?

5
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You need to give up. You don’t have
enough magic left in you to resist us.

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You’re the one who’s wrong.

7
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I still have plenty of power!

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Pow!

9
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It can’t be!

10
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The Sword, Elsdocia!

11
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
<i>He chose</i>
<i>to throw his life away for this?</i>

12
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
My duty is to herald a new world.

13
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
A society where people respect each other.

14
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Where they can laugh together as equals.

15
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Why would you oppose this?

16
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
How can you justify
getting in the way of my noble dream

17
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
for our world?

18
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Really?

19
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Mmm.

20
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm afraid the future's something
you won't see!

21
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You're a fool, Julius.

22
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You know this nation must change.

23
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Besides, if you seal me away,

24
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
you won't have access
to the Imperial Sword anymore!

25
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You’re right.
It pains me to lose such a treasure.

26
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Truth is,

27
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
we no longer possess enough power
to wrest it away from your hand.

28
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I take full responsibility for this

29
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
as the next Wizard King!

30
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This isn’t over!

31
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I <i>will </i>bring about a new world!

32
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
My magic is 'never giving up'!

33
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
BLACK CLOVER: SWORD OF THE WIZARD KING

34
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
CLOVER KINGDOM

35
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
<i>It's my pleasure</i>
<i>to welcome you to The Triumph.</i>

36
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
<i>A grand festival of magic battles</i>
<i>that takes place every ten years.</i>

37
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
<i>I hope you’re prepared for a show</i>
<i>because this tournament</i>

38
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
<i>will decide the strongest Magic Knight</i>
<i>out of the many competitors here today.</i>

39
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
<i>It's long been said that the mage</i>
<i>who claims victory here today,</i>

40
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
<i>will eventually be chosen</i>
<i>as the next Wizard King!</i>

41
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
<i>For those of you who may be unaware,</i>

42
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
<i>the Magic Knights comprise</i>
<i>nine elite squads of mages</i>

43
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
<i>who specialize in battle.</i>

44
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
<i>The Wizard King</i>
<i>sits at the top of the ranks,</i>

45
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
<i>overseeing their duties.</i>

46
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
<i>Together they protect</i>
<i>the peace and happiness</i>

47
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
<i>we're lucky enough to enjoy</i>
<i>in the Clover Kingdom every day!</i>

48
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
<i>Soon we’ll determine who the strongest</i>
<i>member of the Magic Knights is.</i>

49
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
<i>Whatever happens, we're certain to be in</i>
<i>for a memorable time!</i>

50
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
<i>Thank you for waiting so patiently.</i>

51
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
<i>Here we go!</i>

52
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
<i>The Triumph starts now! Hurray!</i>

53
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
-<i>Hmm. By the way, Klaus…</i>
-<i>Mm-hmm?</i>

54
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
<i>I was wondering if you knew why</i>
we <i>were chosen as masters of ceremony?</i>

55
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
<i>Uh! 'Cause we're members</i>
<i>of the strongest Magic Knights Squad,</i>

56
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
<i>the Golden Dawn, naturally!</i>

57
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
<i>And turn off</i>
<i>your Amplification Magic before sidebar--</i>

58
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
<i>It totally slipped my mind!</i>

59
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
<i>Oh well!</i>

60
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
<i>Pardon the belated introductions!</i>
<i>I’m Mimosa Vermillion,</i>

61
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
<i>and I’ll be commentating alongside Klaus.</i>

62
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
<i>Introductions now?!</i>
<i>We should have done that at the beginning!</i>

63
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Who in their right mind
would choose Mimosa for this job?

64
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Man, look at all these people!

65
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The stands are packed!

66
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Mmm… Yes, of course, they're full.
<i>He's </i>first.

67
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
We love Yuno!

68
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
<i>The-- The first mage in the arena</i>
<i>is the vice captain of the Golden Dawn.</i>

69
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
<i>Please welcome Yuno!</i>

70
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Woo-hoo! Hooray!
Go, go, Yuno! Steal the show…

71
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The first round
features everyone's favorite Pretty Boy.

72
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
People came from all over
to watch him fight. See?

73
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
My only interest is in seeing
my dearest little sister, Marie.

74
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Exactly what I’d expect from you, Gauche.

75
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Ah, jeez,
I can’t wait to get in there and brawl.

76
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I just wish Asta was here to join us.

77
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah, too bad. He’s still in exile,
thanks to the judgment at the devil trial.

78
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Man, what a bummer! Let's hope
the rest of the roster's interesting.

79
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Look, someone’s coming!

80
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Where?

81
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
-Wait a second.
-Who the hell is that?

82
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
-Is that…?
-Hmm?

83
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
<i>Yuno’s initial opponent is, uh…</i>

84
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
-Hmm.
-<i>“The Masked One”?</i>

85
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
<i>Surely nobody entered the tournament</i>
<i>with such a ridiculous name?</i>

86
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
-Oh, they did!
-Take off the mask!

87
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Are you kidding me
with this getup?

88
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You dressed like this
to make fun of Yuno, didn’t you?!

89
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Hmm.

90
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
<i>The Triumph</i>
<i>will now officially commence.</i>

91
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
<i>Our first round</i>
<i>is Yuno versus The Masked One.</i>

92
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
<i>You may begin!</i>

93
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Wow!

94
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Hey, Asta. Nice counter.

95
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
<i>The first move</i>
<i>in the tournament came from Yuno!</i>

96
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
<i>He used strong Wind Magic.</i>

97
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
<i>But The Masked One</i>
<i>countered with a big sword,</i>

98
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
<i>which completely neutralized the attack!</i>

99
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It appears they started without us.

100
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The time has come, Julius.

101
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Shall we join them?

102
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Oh yeah!

103
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Barrier Magic: Voodoo Shangri-la!

104
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I’m sensing enormous magical power.

105
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You’ve no idea
how long I’ve waited for this day to come.

106
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Change is finally at hand.

107
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I will fix this country!

108
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I’m surprised to find you
looking so feeble in your old age, Julius.

109
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I only absorbed
the tiniest amount of magic,

110
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
yet it’s taken this great a toll on you?

111
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I thought I wouldn’t see you again.
What a shame.

112
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
<i>Must have been then.</i>

113
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
<i>Yes! I hope you don’t mind</i>
<i>that I broke your seal.</i>

114
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You were distracted for just a moment.
But that moment was all I needed.

115
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You're going to try again.

116
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
My ambitions have not changed
in the slightest

117
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
since we last faced each other here.

118
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Today I will create the ideal world.

119
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Where citizens have respect
for one another.

120
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
A nation built on joy and laughter.

121
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And I brought help.

122
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Come forth, my soldiers.
Time for domination.

123
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Tomorrow this corrupt country
will be no more!

124
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
<i>Legion Magic: Gehenna Game.</i>

125
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Conrad, stop this! Just--

126
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You gonna be good, old man?

127
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Oh, thanks! I-- I’ll be fine.

128
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Hmm.

129
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Quickly! Exit this way!

130
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Steel Magic: Fierce Spiral Lance!

131
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Klaus! Leave this to me.

132
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What the heck?
Why is everyone targeting me?

133
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yuno!

134
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Ugh, these guys are the worst!
They ruined my awesome disguise!

135
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And here I thought you were a lost child
who wandered onto the field.

136
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What did you call me?!

137
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
<i>Water Creation Magic:</i>
<i>Sea Dragon's Roar!</i>

138
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You dummy. You could've told me
you were going to be participating.

139
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Noelle!

140
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You probably can’t feel it,

141
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
but I think something is absorbing
magical power from everyone here.

142
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Those with not much to begin with,
can’t even move now!

143
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Wait, really? That’s bad. Are you okay?

144
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Of course. I’m a royal. I'm fine.

145
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I have more than enough to spare, moron.

146
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Right. Got it.

147
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Guess I’ll have to work harder
to make up for everybody else.

148
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Make sure you don’t get too carried away.
And don’t worry, I’ve got your back.

149
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Just keep focusing
on what’s in front of you.

150
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Great. Then let’s do this!

151
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Is this some kind of a trick?

152
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Those three?
How could they possibly be here?

153
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Given your title, you must recognize them.

154
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Three Wizard Kings
stripped of their titles.

155
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Maligned because of their cruelty
and severe natures.

156
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Hey, you floating guys! Did you do this?

157
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Such an insolent boy. How is he moving?

158
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Good question.

159
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
From what I can tell, he didn't have
any magical power to begin with.

160
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Fighting without any juice?
Buzz off.

161
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
There’s no way
that my soldiers were defeated

162
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
by a peon
with no magical power to speak of.

163
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Something strange is going on.

164
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It was a fairly simple task
to revive them,

165
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
given my magic combined
with the power of the Imperial Sword.

166
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You doubted me,

167
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
but these three are loyal supporters
of my cause.

168
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And together we will forge a new reality.

169
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You heard the man.
Now let’s get you out of the way!

170
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Oh, shut up!
I don’t know what you’re up to,

171
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
but it’s pretty obvious
that you’re the bad guys!

172
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I’m gonna take you down!

173
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
My, aren’t you a lively one?

174
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
<i>Barrier Magic: Voodoo Regalia!</i>

175
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
<i>He destroyed my magic?</i>

176
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Hey, Conrad!

177
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I found a fun new toy
you might find amusing.

178
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Why don’t you take a turn with him, hmm?

179
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Hmm.

180
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Hmm?

181
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Wizard King! Have you been hurt?

182
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
No, Marx, stay back! Get out of here!

183
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Well, well.
That’s interesting magic.

184
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
How rude! No acknowledgement?

185
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I suppose that means
I get to take my time.

186
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Stop playing around with your prey.

187
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Have the decency
to finish him off quickly.

188
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Hey! My toy!

189
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
-Asta!
-Yeah!

190
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Ah yeah! Thanks, guys!

191
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Wow! That’s some beautiful magic
you’re working with.

192
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It’s hopeless.
They can’t defeat Wizard Kings.

193
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
No matter how many stand against us.

194
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Besides, <i>these </i>are your Magic Knights?

195
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
A peasant child with no magic?

196
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
How far this country has fallen
under your watch.

197
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You underestimate them.

198
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Come again?

199
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You may think we’re trash,
but none of us is weak.

200
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Not me or my Magic Knights.

201
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked
Lightless Blade Storm!

202
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
-Hmm!
-Yeah!

203
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Huh!

204
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Sorry we’re late!

205
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But now some mighty mages
have arrived to save the day!

206
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Wait, wait!
What is this sinister magical power?!

207
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
This may turn
into my best masterpiece yet!

208
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I’ll take you on and turn you to ash
with the flames of justice!

209
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
No, that silhouette. It can’t be.

210
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Hello, Kaiser.

211
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It’s been a long time.

212
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
-Captain Yami!
-My bad.

213
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I’m late 'cause I was takin’ a dump.
Couldn't get off the pot sooner.

214
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So, who are these guys?

215
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Not totally sure.
But I do know they’re super bad.

216
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And strong.
Things aren’t looking good for us!

217
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
"Super bad"?
That’s how you describe a threat?

218
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
In this case, he isn't wrong.

219
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I don’t see a way
to defeat them with our current forces.

220
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
<i>There is one option though.</i>

221
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Please.

222
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Head to Magic Tool Research Lab,
Branch Zero right away, Yami.

223
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I need you to bring back the special tool
we’ve been co-developing with Nero.

224
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
-Uh, pass.
-"Pass"?

225
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I go and you’re screwed.

226
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You need me.
Someone’s gotta watch your back.

227
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And I've got zero interest
in reliving my past failures.

228
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Uh-- Yami…

229
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Look, if you need an errand boy,
just send this dope.

230
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
-Kid? You're on.
-Me?

231
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Finral, you heard your king.

232
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Join him. Go to Branch Zero.

233
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Sir! Right away.

234
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Hey, wait! I should be helping out here!

235
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Uh!

236
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So this is where you were hiding?

237
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'd suggest you stay put.

238
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Otherwise, I can't guarantee
a swift death.

239
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Well.

240
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Stop your stalling,
and get the hell outta here!

241
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You better make it snappy, all right, kid?

242
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
-Or I'll kill them without you!
-Sir!

243
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Captain Yami!

244
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Asta, quick. Go through!

245
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I can’t maintain Spatial Magic for long
because of that barrier!

246
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You’re a member
of the Black Bulls, aren’t you?

247
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Then follow your captain’s orders!

248
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Thanks, Noelle.

249
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Whaddaya know?

250
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I didn't expect
to see fancy magic like this today.

251
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Well, I’ll have to analyze it later.

252
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Oh my!

253
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Vouivre's Roar!

254
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Okay, not too shabby.
You've got my attention.

255
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Dark Magic:
Dark Cloaked Black Blade!

256
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

257
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Their defenses
keep getting tougher and tougher.

258
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
The kids have greatly improved though.

259
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Maybe. They've still got plenty to learn.

260
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It’ll be awhile before they can
hold their own without holding me back.

261
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
My apologies
for not being able to contain them.

262
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Please. You’re doing the best you can.

263
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Thanks to you, I had time
to send my guys out on an errand.

264
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You’re wasting energy
trying to oppose me.

265
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
When the Imperial Sword’s magic
is activated,

266
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
the Clover Kingdom will be gone.

267
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Haven’t you had
any better ideas in the last ten years?

268
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So the Imperial Sword? That's the one
that can absorb magic power.

269
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Stores it 'til the wielder’s
ready to release it, right?

270
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Is it really possible
to destroy a country with it?

271
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Certainly. If he unleashes
all the stored-up magic at once.

272
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
He’s already collected power
from every person who was at this stadium.

273
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The blade must be humming with it.

274
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And with his magic,

275
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
he can misuse the sword's ability
to no end, bringing ruin to our kingdom.

276
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
"Misuse"?

277
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm using the sword
to save this broken world.

278
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'd say it's the perfect use, myself.

279
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm here now, Wizard King.

280
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
We successfully evacuated
everyone in the audience.

281
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Now we can safely defeat <i>them</i>.

282
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Fuegoleon and Nozel.
I do hope you’ve gotten stronger.

283
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I never expected
I’d be in a situation

284
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
where I’d have to fight
this monster again.

285
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Ah, I almost forgot
how Nozel got so spooked the last time

286
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
that he cried and crapped his pants.

287
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Another word
and I’ll drown you in mercury.

288
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So who're the friends
he brought along this time? They’re new.

289
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The woman is capable
of producing magic soldiers.

290
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
My grandfather’s journal
spoke of this power.

291
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I remember it well because my sister
found it captivating.

292
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
-Not good.
-They’re figures from the past.

293
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Leaders who died long ago.

294
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Wait. You're tellin' me some actual
Wizard Kings have come back to life?!

295
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
In that case, I bet I could make a killing
selling their autographs.

296
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Former Wizard Kings
have been revived?!

297
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I’m awake for a change,
but this feels like a dream.

298
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It’s way too crazy!

299
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
This is filling
my brush with inspiration.

300
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Then again, maybe now’s not the time
to be painting.

301
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You’ve managed to gather
a formidable force, but this ends here.

302
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
There are countless points
across the land where veins of mana

303
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
intersect and interact with each other.

304
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
This location happens to be one of them.

305
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Ten years ago, I altered the arena

306
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
and turned it into a weapon
of my own design.

307
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
But you people interrupted me
before I could activate it.

308
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Festival Stadium.

309
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Also known as Triumph, my flying fortress.

310
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
There’s no way for you to escape now.

311
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Julius, it’s time I make up for the years
you stole when you sealed me away.

312
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
We made it.
Welcome to Branch Zero.

313
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Hey!

314
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
What's up?
This is Asta from the Black Bulls!

315
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
The Wizard King sent me!

316
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
-Let's get these doors open!
-It’s not gonna work.

317
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
This lab is a well-kept secret.

318
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Only a handful of nobles
even know it exists.

319
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
To enter, you have to spell out
a secret password with your magical power.

320
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And you are?

321
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Ah, you must be the Black Bulls.

322
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm branch coordinator Millie Maxwell.
It’s a pleasure to meet you.

323
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Come. This way.

324
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
-Right!
-We've been briefed.

325
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It's quite the situation.

326
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm going to let
someone else take it from here.

327
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
She’ll be happy
to show you around.

328
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Nero!

329
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
The magic tool Julius needs
is down below.

330
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Stored in the depths
of this facility for safe keeping.

331
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Sally is making some adjustments to it.

332
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
This could be my greatest experiment!

333
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So Sally's here too.

334
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Nero, you’ve been observing
the Clover Kingdom for centuries, right?

335
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
At least 500 years if I'm not mistaken.

336
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So does that mean you recognize
the people who attacked the stadium?

337
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I don’t know the details,
but I can confirm a few things for you.

338
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
-The mastermind is Conrad Leto.
-Huh?

339
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I assume
you’ve at least heard his name before.

340
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Conrad was the--

341
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
-Wait, you don’t mean…
-Uh-huh.

342
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Yes.

343
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
He was once a Magic Knight
of the Clover Kingdom.

344
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And Julius Novachrono’s predecessor.

345
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
The previous Wizard King.

346
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Hold on.

347
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Didn't that guy get sick?
He's been dead for almost ten years.

348
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I’ll explain what I can. Get on.

349
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Conrad Leto was the 27th Wizard King.

350
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Even before he was chosen for this role,

351
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
he was known as one of
the most powerful men in the kingdom.

352
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
<i>He quickly became</i>
<i>a captain in the Magic Knights.</i>

353
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
<i>And, as you might expect,</i>
<i>his squad was praised for their successes.</i>

354
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
<i>The citizens of the land trusted him.</i>

355
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
<i>And given his abilities</i>
<i>and the respect he garnered,</i>

356
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
<i>it was no surprise</i>
<i>he was named the Wizard King.</i>

357
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
<i>However, something changed inside him.</i>

358
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
<i>He rebelled against the kingdom and,</i>
<i>as a result, was stripped of his title.</i>

359
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
<i>What do you mean, "he rebelled"?</i>

360
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
<i>He tried to destroy the nation.</i>

361
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
No way! The Wizard King’s job
is to protect peace!

362
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Why would he try
to do something so terrible?

363
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I have no idea.

364
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
What we do know is this.

365
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
<i>His plan relied</i>
<i>on the Imperial Sword, Elsdocia.</i>

366
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
<i>A magic item that belonged</i>
<i>to Lord Lumiere, the first Wizard King.</i>

367
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
<i>When Julius and the others</i>
<i>learned of this plot,</i>

368
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
<i>they stopped Conrad by sealing him.</i>

369
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Intense.

370
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
They then announced
that he died of an illness,

371
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
so the kingdom wouldn't panic.

372
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Keep in mind
that Julius couldn't defeat him,

373
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
even with the help
of the most elite Magic Knights.

374
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
As such, he had no choice
but to use his Time Magic on Conrad

375
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
to keep him locked away and out of sight
so he couldn’t harm anybody.

376
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I get it, he's incredibly strong.
What magic does he use?

377
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Key Magic.

378
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It grants him the ability to create keys

379
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
that can open or close rifts
out of thin air.

380
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
The magic space behind these doors
is able to absorb whatever Conrad wishes.

381
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Tools, grimoires…

382
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Magic itself.

383
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Seriously?

384
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Wait, wait. You mean…

385
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Correct.

386
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
He has the ability
to steal a person’s magic.

387
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And after, he can use it
however he pleases.

388
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Sealing Magic: Release!

389
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So how far down are we going?

390
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Their security is extreme.

391
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yes. Patience. We're almost there.

392
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
This is the innermost part
of Branch Zero.

393
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Here we store and research

394
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
the most important
magic tools in our catalog.

395
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I get the feeling we were asked
to bring back something pretty rare, huh?

396
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Indeed. It's something
Prince Lumiere was developing

397
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
to control the power
of the Imperial Sword.

398
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You could think of it
as a sheath for Elsdocia.

399
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It’s still a prototype, but with any luck,
we can use it to seal Conrad again.

400
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
He's here?

401
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
When I heard you were
after something Lumiere worked on,

402
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
my interest was piqued.

403
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
But this is a useless trinket.

404
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
-No, don't!
-Sally!

405
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Demon Slayer!

406
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
-No!
-Oh?

407
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Finral?!

408
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I know you.

409
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
How did you find us?

410
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Secré Swallowtail.

411
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Yet another Mage
from the Black Bulls Squad.

412
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Your fellow members are Asta,
Noelle Silva, and Finral Roulacase.

413
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Memory Exchange Magic makes it easy
to see what other people have experienced.

414
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Invading a person's privacy
is a bit distasteful,

415
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
but it allowed me to locate this place.

416
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
<i>Marx’s magic!</i>

417
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Shall I show you
what's happening?

418
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Citizens of the Clover Kingdom,

419
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
surrender immediately,

420
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and offer your magical power as a tribute.
Resistance is futile.

421
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
My Legion Magic soldiers

422
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
will keep on fighting
until their last bit of energy is spent!

423
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
<i>One of the former</i>
<i>Wizard Kings, Princia.</i>

424
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
<i>The Imperial Sword is supplying her</i>
<i>with the magical power it has stored</i>

425
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
<i>meaning she essentially has no limits.</i>

426
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
<i>The Magic Knights</i>
<i>have been completely wiped out.</i>

427
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
<i>And we’ve taken control of every citizen</i>
<i>and strategic facility in the kingdom.</i>

428
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It can't be.

429
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Impressive, no?

430
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So many. So fast.

431
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Don't imagine that you're being invaded
by a paltry swarm of magic soldiers.

432
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Princia can summon armies comparable
to those of even the strongest nations.

433
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
As for those powerful mages
who helped you escape…

434
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Captain Yami!

435
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
They're resting now, fast asleep.
They’ll resist no more.

436
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
All those people at the stadium.

437
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Nozel. Brother?

438
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
That's right.
You're the youngest Silva daughter.

439
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Progeny of Acier Silva,

440
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
the renowned Steel War Princess.

441
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
What a pathetic turn of events
for your brother to fall

442
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
before his little sister.

443
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
To think that such a coward

444
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
was allowed to be a captain
of the Magic Knights!

445
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Sea Dragon’s Roar!

446
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Noelle! Dammit, I'm coming!

447
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
You’ve much yet to learn,

448
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
but the purity
of your magic is impressive.

449
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I believe I’ll take it.

450
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Hmm. The profound difference
in our abilities

451
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
makes this such an easy task.

452
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I can feel my magic flowing out.

453
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Bastard. What did you do to her?

454
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Perhaps it's better to show you.

455
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
<i>Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!</i>

456
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It's true, he stole Noelle's magic.

457
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Give it back!

458
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
You're gonna wish you'd stayed sealed!

459
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Fascinating. So this is Anti-Magic
in action, is it?

460
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Hmm.

461
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Uh!

462
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Demon Destroyer!

463
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
What a wonderful power you possess!

464
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
It can nullify not only magic

465
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
but also any phenomena
that is derived from magic.

466
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I’d like to take this ability as well,

467
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
but perhaps I’ll refrain
for the time being.

468
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I wouldn’t want it
to affect anything I have stored.

469
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Let’s have a little chat.

470
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
After all, you and I
are walking a similar path.

471
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
You really are nuts.
I am nothing like you!

472
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
The Imperial Sword, Elsdocia
is a magic tool

473
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
that was developed
by Lumiere a long time ago.

474
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It happens to be perfectly compatible
with my Key Magic.

475
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
<i>The sword was created</i>
<i>to preserve exceptional magic</i>

476
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
<i>of great mages and heroes</i>
<i>as a legacy for future generations.</i>

477
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
<i>You see, it has not only</i>
<i>the power and wisdom</i>

478
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
<i>of every Wizard King stored inside it</i>
<i>but a piece of their souls as well.</i>

479
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
<i>Are you starting to understand?</i>

480
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
<i>This weapon can absorb,</i>
<i>stockpile, and unleash</i>

481
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
<i>an absurd amount</i>
<i>of magical power all at once.</i>

482
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
<i>With it, I will combine</i>
<i>the generations of Wizard Kings' magic</i>

483
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
<i>with the various types of magic I stole</i>
<i>and create a Gargantuan Compound Magic!</i>

484
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
<i>Once that power is in my hands,</i>

485
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
<i>I'll drive it into one of the mana veins</i>
<i>pulsing throughout this land.</i>

486
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
<i>Disaster will be magnificent!</i>

487
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
<i>The foundation of the continent</i>
<i>will be destroyed</i>,

488
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
<i>and every single citizen will perish.</i>

489
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
But don't you worry yourself,

490
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
the Imperial Sword
can also store the souls of the departed.

491
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I will select the worthy

492
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
and bring back only those who deserve
to inherit the world that I have created!

493
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I know people loathed me
because of my magic,

494
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I’ve seen it in their memories.

495
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Trust me when I say
I know what you must feel.

496
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Those with magical power
own everything in this society,

497
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
and those without it die in the squalor.

498
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Isn’t this world unbearable, Asta?

499
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Shouldn’t we destroy it and start anew?

500
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Join me, and we’ll shape
a new reality together.

501
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
One where people have esteem
for their fellow man.

502
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Where they can't help but smile.

503
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Everyone should respect each other
and get along great and laugh together.

504
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
One day, when I become the Wizard King,
I’ll create that world.

505
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Shut up!

506
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
That's bullshit!

507
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
The Wizard King
is supposed to protect his people!

508
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
To make sure
everyone in the nation is safe and happy.

509
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I will not let you destroy this world!

510
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
It’s not something
a real king would ever do!

511
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
You cannot stop me.

512
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
The dregs of this society
are forced to lead lives devoid of worth.

513
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You’ve seen it.

514
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
But I can give meaning to their existence.

515
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Why can't you see that?

516
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Every single thing you've said is crazy.

517
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I don't understand any of it at all!

518
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
You don't realize
how broken this civilization is.

519
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
What a pity.

520
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I said, "Shut up!"
How can anyone be so selfish?

521
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Why can’t you understand?!

522
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I know the things you’ve experienced.

523
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
The inequality. The betrayal.
The country is against you.

524
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You must choose, Asta.

525
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You can walk this path with me…

526
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
…or disappear forever.

527
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Give up this fight already.

528
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
We <i>are </i>alike.
Accept that, and stand at my side.

529
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
The fusion of magic
will be completed by dawn tomorrow.

530
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
That’s your deadline. Your last chance.

531
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You have to give Noelle

532
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
her magic back

533
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
That’s your concern?

534
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Know that
I will truly regret your death.

535
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I'll fight.

536
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I will not back down.

537
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
That's because my magic is

538
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
'never giving up.'

539
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
That’s the last of my power.

540
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Uh… Hm. What now?

541
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
We’re not done. We'll try whatever we can.

542
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Yuno? When'd you get here?

543
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And Millie too?

544
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
He made it very clear that
he wouldn’t leave until he’d helped you.

545
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
-Drink up, Sally.
-Okay!

546
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
There's no plan.
We’ll just have to play this one by ear.

547
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
That sounds like a fun time!
Like we’re experimenting.

548
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
No. Not fun.

549
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I truly loathe improvisation.

550
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Yu… no.

551
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Never thought I’d be using this
in such a way, but here we are.

552
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Come on, quickly! Let’s try to activate it
with the magic we have!

553
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
This will not work.

554
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Maybe not,

555
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
but thanks to their help,
we have a chance!

556
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Sealing Magic: Eternal Prison!

557
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
He's too strong!

558
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
We will retreat for now!

559
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Jester, what’s the status
of the magic fusion?

560
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Hey you. We’re at about 20% complete.

561
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Generally speaking, we're golden.

562
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
<i>It should be finished by dawn,</i>
<i>right on schedule.</i>

563
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
That’s good to hear.

564
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And I want to thank you

565
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
for fighting the good fight with me.

566
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
It’s finally happening!
A brand-new nation!

567
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
No one will ever cry
or have joy taken from them again.

568
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
We’ll triumph.

569
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
These poor lost souls
will be saved and born again.

570
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
What I seek
is a society free from oppression,

571
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
where no one
seeks to lord over another individual.

572
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
<i>I trust that you can achieve that</i>
<i>as part of your plan, Conrad?</i>

573
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Yes.

574
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
How about the mana veins?

575
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
<i>Don’t worry,</i>
<i>I managed to find the perfect one.</i>

576
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
<i>It's at a village called Hage</i>
<i>in the Forsaken Realm</i>,

577
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
<i>where a demon skeleton rests.</i>

578
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
On its own,
my Key Magic is practically useless.

579
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I have to borrow power from other mages.

580
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Kinda goes hand in hand with the future
I'm fighting for, like it's my destiny.

581
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
One day soon,
I’m going to change this whole country.

582
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I like to think that my real magic

583
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
is 'never giving up.'

584
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I told you that we were alike.

585
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Where am I?

586
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Noelle!

587
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I’m so happy you're awake!

588
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I’m sorry. I healed you as best I could.

589
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Mimosa…

590
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I’m glad you made it out.

591
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
We should be safe here.
This is a Golden Dawn emergency shelter.

592
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
It's still under construction,
so only a few members know about it.

593
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
They tried to capture everyone
at the arena to steal our magic,

594
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
<i>but the captains stopped them.</i>

595
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
<i>They bought us time to escape.</i>

596
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Take care of the kid, you hear me?

597
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I don’t know
what happened to them afterwards,

598
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
but they’re not here yet, so, you know…

599
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Hey, are you okay?

600
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Asta’s up? Excuse me!

601
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Asta, please! You need to rest
until your body's fully healed!

602
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Conrad… must be stopped.

603
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
He’s gonna destroy the kingdom
and everybody in it.

604
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
If we don’t do something,
the world ends tomorrow at dawn!

605
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Dawn?!

606
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
How are we supposed to fight such enemies?

607
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Is it really
a former Wizard King?

608
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
There's no way
we can do anything ourselves.

609
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
-We’re not strong enough--
-Come on!

610
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
We could just hide--

611
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
-We can't hide forever.
-Hey! Listen!

612
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
There’s nothing we can do
with these numbers.

613
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
It probably won’t be long
before they find us here,

614
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
so we should pack and run while we can.
We’ll move out and settle somewhere else.

615
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Maybe the Heart Kingdom will take us in.
We’ll be safe there.

616
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
This isn’t a fight
we’re going to be able to win!

617
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Not a bad idea
to ask other nations for help.

618
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
We’re talking about
a massive undertaking.

619
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
It’d be difficult
to move the injured safely.

620
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
If this Conrad’s
really a former Wizard King,

621
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
do we have any choice <i>but </i>to flee?

622
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And Lord Julius gone…

623
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Why get hurt fighting
when we know we’ll fail?

624
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
What the crap
are you talkin' about?!

625
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Running away? No!

626
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
We have to do something.

627
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
We have to at least try!

628
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
We’re the Magic Knights
of the Clover Kingdom, aren’t we?

629
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Not cowards!

630
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
We've been able
to live happily and peacefully

631
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
thanks to the Wizard King
and the past mages

632
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
who looked out for us our entire lives.

633
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
They protected us
before we joined our squads,

634
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
when we were kids,
heck, before we were even born!

635
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
They fought for us no matter the odds
and never backed down!

636
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And the Wizard King led the way!

637
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Making sure that the country was safe!
That we could live our lives!

638
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
It's thanks to the sacrifices they made
that the Clover Kingdom exists now!

639
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Without them and their passion,
we wouldn’t be who we are today!

640
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Asta…

641
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I won't turn my back
on this country.

642
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
It's my turn to look after

643
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
everything the Wizard King
and the captains have protected.

644
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
To take a stand!

645
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
But it’s not just me. It’s your turn too!
This is our chance to make a difference!

646
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I'll heal up using my fighting spirit!

647
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And I’ll face Conrad again
and kick his butt for real this time!

648
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
We can stop him if we work together.

649
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
We may not be strong enough
to win against him by ourselves,

650
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
but if we join forces,
we'll turn into something unstoppable.

651
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Isn’t that the point
of being Magic Knights?

652
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Why we’re here in the first place?

653
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
If all of us join together
and pool our power,

654
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
there's no enemy anywhere
who could stop us!

655
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I’m not forcing anyone to come with me.

656
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Sekke made a good point.
You can still escape.

657
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Hide out in the Heart Kingdom
or somewhere.

658
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
But please, stay!

659
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Some of you have to be willing
to lend me your strength in this fight!

660
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Sounds good. But it's not much of a plan.

661
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Well, I suppose that’s to be expected
from a reckless fool.

662
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
So I’ll lend a hand.

663
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I’m not gonna let you do this alone.

664
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Not a chance.

665
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
King Julius isn’t here to lead the way.

666
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
And we can’t rely on our captains either.

667
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
But that shouldn't make a difference
to any of you.

668
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
We’ll battle on their behalf.

669
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Now’s our chance
to prove that we have what it takes

670
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
with everything on the line!

671
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I’ll say it again.

672
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Look around. You’re the Magic Knights
of the Clover Kingdom.

673
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
We’ll fight as one.
Save the whole country.

674
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
And surpass all our limits!

675
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Yeah!

676
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
So! What are we gonna do first?

677
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I’m gonna figure that out,
right now!

678
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
You’re what?!

679
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
<i>I can’t take this anymore.</i>

680
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
<i>They’re gonna get themselves killed.</i>
<i>But not me. I’m escaping.</i>

681
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Wha-ha?

682
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Ha-ha!

683
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
What’s all this shouting?

684
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Now’s not the time for empty words,
you hot-headed imbecile!

685
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Lady Big-sis-leon! And more captains!

686
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I didn't know you were alive--
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

687
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Who are you calling,
"Big sis," huh? And don't assume I'm dead.

688
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
<i>I’ve been on my own</i>
<i>doing some intense training.</i>

689
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Ah. Guests.

690
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I hope you’re here to tell me
we're gonna have some fun.

691
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I also have been away.

692
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
<i>On a mission with Jack.</i>

693
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
<i>Fortunately, that means</i>
<i>I wasn’t caught up in the initial attack.</i>

694
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
The same goes for me. Now that we’re here,
we must rescue the others.

695
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
We brought some other people
back from our mission.

696
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
They should come in handy.

697
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
<i>They're already out there,</i>
<i>pulling their weight,</i>

698
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
<i>surveilling the giant flying arena.</i>

699
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
<i>According to them, it looks like Yami</i>
<i>and the other captains are still with us.</i>

700
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
<i>However, they’re currently trapped</i>
<i>inside the barrier.</i>

701
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Captain Yami.

702
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Nozel is alive.

703
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Thank goodness, Yami,
I couldn’t handle your dying!

704
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
There’s something I don’t get.

705
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
They're captured.

706
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Why hold such powerful
Magic Knights captive?

707
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
-Wouldn't killing them be easier?
-Because Conrad needs them alive.

708
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
He's wielding the Imperial Sword.

709
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
With it, he can absorb their power,

710
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
giving him and his friends
unlimited strength.

711
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Que, que!
So they’re his livestock!

712
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Oh! Earlier he said something
about needing a ton of power.

713
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
His plan depends on
sucking it out of them!

714
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
So that’s what we’re dealing with.

715
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
But if he siphons off
<i>their </i>magical powers, then…

716
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
We don’t have much time.

717
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Asta, knights, gather all your courage.

718
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
We're taking back the kingdom!

719
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Right!

720
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Before you run into battle,
I wanna get those tummies full.

721
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Open wide!

722
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Whoa! Charmy, you’re okay!

723
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
-I was worried.
-That’s right.

724
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Rouge and Captain Yami
gave us the opportunity to escape.

725
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
-You're safe!
-Hmm.

726
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Noelle, it’s good to see you.

727
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Unfortunately, our base was trapped
inside one of their barriers.

728
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Henry and Gordon are there now.
I'm sure they're holding up.

729
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Good.

730
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Then our first objective
is to break them out, right?

731
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
The Black Bulls' base.

732
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
The Imperial Sword
has absorbed tremendous amounts of power.

733
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
They'll drive it into a vein of mana
called a singular point.

734
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Que! Well, that will spell
the end of this kingdom. Toodle-oo!

735
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Given all that we know
it’s safe to assume the Wizard Kings

736
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
were revived with Conrad’s magic
and the sword.

737
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
So what if we break the sword?

738
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Would that take their power away?
Make 'em dead again?

739
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Given the precautions they’re taking,
I’d say that’s highly likely.

740
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Right. Our goal's to destroy
the Imperial Sword.

741
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Cut off their power source.

742
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Do whatever you need
to prepare for the battle ahead of us.

743
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Dawn is fast approaching,

744
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
and that's our deadline!

745
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
<i>I still can't use</i>
<i>the powerful spells in my grimoire,</i>

746
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
<i>but thanks to Charmy,</i>
<i>my magic has returned.</i>

747
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
<i>For now, I’ll focus on what I </i>can <i>do!</i>

748
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Hmm?

749
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Wait up!

750
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Hmm. I take it you're healed. You ready?

751
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Oh yeah!

752
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
THE BASE OF THE BLACK BULLS SQUAD

753
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
This is strange.

754
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
When I got back from training,
Henry was the only one here.

755
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
It appears the former Wizard Kings

756
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
were somehow revived
and have taken over the capital.

757
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
No barrier's gonna stop me!

758
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
First, we go and rescue those
at the base of the Black Bulls.

759
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Wha-- I’m glad,
but are you sure?

760
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
This'll be difficult.

761
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Our success hinges on us
preserving our fighting power.

762
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Plus, we're in need of transport.

763
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Something that will allow us
to move everyone safely.

764
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I understand.

765
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Don’t you get it, kid? We'll tick off
some important boxes if we have your base.

766
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
-Oh.
-That's true.

767
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
But don't forget that Conrad has stolen
many types of magic he can use against us.

768
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
It’s safe to assume he’ll easily
be able to counter normal attacks.

769
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
That’s where you come in, Asta.

770
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Anti-Magic neutralizes every type
of magic power.

771
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And since that’s what you wield,

772
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
you will be
our only hope of defeating Conrad.

773
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
We’ll work to give you that opportunity.

774
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
So what do you say? Are you in?

775
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Yes, sir!

776
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
All right!

777
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Welcome back, everyone.
Oh, wow, we have so many guests!

778
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
What’s the story, Henry?
Can you get us off the ground?

779
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Let's get goin'!

780
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I've got you covered!

781
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Quickly! Replenish your energy
by stuffing those faces!

782
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I've never felt
so much magic power before!

783
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
So cool!

784
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
The Black Bulls
are really flying in style now!

785
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Hold on.
This thing is gonna fly?

786
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
If there's enough power,
I think it will!

787
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
You should hold on.

788
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
More resistance than expected. Damn.

789
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
<i>Que, que! Severing Magic…</i>

790
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
…<i>Death Scythe: Lunatic Slash!</i>

791
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Briar Magic…

792
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Crimson Vine Spear!

793
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
-Barely a dent in them.
-Que, que! How annoying!

794
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Huh? Argh!

795
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Argh! Argh!

796
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Que, que!

797
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Perfect opportunity to slice and dice!

798
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
We’ll stop them
from interfering with our mission.

799
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
The rest of you go on ahead!

800
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
-Captain Jack! Captain Charlotte!
-Hold on!

801
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
-If you go, we can’t defeat Conrad.
-Uh--

802
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Yeah, but-- There's only two of 'em.

803
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Two don't stand a chance.

804
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Three…

805
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
is a better number.

806
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
World Tree Magic:
Great Mistilteinn Tree!

807
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Go. While you have an opening.

808
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Captain Vangeance!

809
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Are you ready?

810
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Hey.

811
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
<i>Yuno</i>.

812
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
<i>I leave the Wizard King to you.</i>

813
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Well, I’d say it’s as good a time as any
to ask our barbarous guests to leave.

814
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Listen closely.

815
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
We may be out three captains now,
but we’re still goin' in!

816
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
-Hey, Asta.
-Hmm?

817
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
-Handle the pep talk.
-Huh?

818
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Right! We got this, you guys!
We'll give 'em everything we've got

819
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
and take the Clover Kingdom back
from these losers!

820
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
<i>Yeah!</i>

821
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I've received an update from my soldiers.

822
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
The rebels have begun countermeasures.

823
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
How shall we proceed?

824
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
They decided to resist.

825
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
As I know <i>you </i>would
if you were in their shoes.

826
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
The grand finale is upon us.

827
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I’ve saved you
the best seat for the climax.

828
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Is that why you kept me alive until now,

829
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
even after you took
almost all of my power?

830
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Those you love,
those you want to protect,

831
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I want their agonizing final breaths
to haunt your remaining hours.

832
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
They will die
in front of their powerless false king.

833
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Only then will the new era
of the Clover Kingdom begin.

834
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I hope you’re ready
for a stunning show.

835
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Huh? What is that?!

836
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Is that an enormous barrier?!

837
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
It's far more powerful
than the one at our base.

838
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
This will be tough to break through.

839
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Oh, hey! Look!

840
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Well, well, one last desperate attempt
to stop us.

841
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I'm gonna be totally honest with you.

842
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
This is hopeless!

843
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
You see, a Wizard King
never leaves his blind spot open!

844
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
What’ll you do now?

845
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Our enemy's working with <i>this </i>much power?!

846
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
He’s in a totally different league!
What should we do?

847
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Stay back!

848
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Huh?

849
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
It’s not your time to shine yet.

850
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
We’ll handle this guy. No sweat.

851
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
We just gotta surpass our limits
like we always do. Right?

852

Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
We're going to run right into the barrier!

<i>Asta, I know you can do this.</i>

872
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Face us, so we can get this over with.

873
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
That was easy.

874
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Thanks for walking into our trap,
ya walking corpses.

875
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000

Also, don't forget I am your superior!

879

Whoa! Thanks for the assist!

883

You do realize
that this barrier has been fortified

Even if you did break through,
it would quickly regenerate. No problem.

any flies in our ointment!

Now! Fire at will!

Too bad.

You better take that maniac down!

It’s him!

908
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Why’s he out here?

909
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
That's the vein. Right there!

It’s in the skeleton of that demon!

911

Oh no!

912
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
This is as far as you go!
I’ll handle you!

913
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Asta! Leave him to me,
and take care of Conrad!

914
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Give 'im everything you’ve got.

915
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Yeah!

916
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Ugh.

917
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
It's time. Bell?

918
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Thought you’d never ask!

919
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Let’s go all out!

<i>Our plan worked,</i>

<i>Fail and you will answer to me!</i>

You aren’t pulling out
any special tricks

935
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
to use in your fight against me?

936
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
How unfortunate that I find myself saddled
with such a boring opponent.

937
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
You expected tricks?

938
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
I'm not some weakling
who can’t win an honest fight.

939
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Princia Funnybunny.

940
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
A feared warrior with a combat strength
of a thousand soldiers.

941
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Mighty even among Wizard Kings.

942
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
According to the history books,

943
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
no matter how bad a fight might've looked,
you always came out on top!

944
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:16,000
No tricks here. Just me.
A fair fight to see how we compare.

945
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Very well, then. I take back my comments.

946
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
<i>Legion Magic: Endless Domination!</i>

947
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
If you want the honor of playing with me,
you need to prove you’re worthy first.

948
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Challenge happily accepted!

949
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
But…

950
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
you better not hold anything back,
you hear me?!

951
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Where is he?

952
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Were you even trying to aim?

953
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Load out!

954
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
You’re a fool if you think
you managed to lure me into a snare.

955
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
It's quite the opposite, you silly boy.

956
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I’m the one who lured you
into what will soon be your tomb!

957
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,000
All that absorbed magical energy
isn’t just powering this flying fortress,

958
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
we’re able to tap into
as much of it as we want as well.

959
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Which means as long as I’m here,
the well of my power

960
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
doesn’t have any risk of running dry!

961
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Ha. You’re dense enough to believe
that means you’ve won?

962
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Against us?

963
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Wait. "Us"?

964
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Not too shabby, Pretty Boy.

965
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
But points docked for being so rough.

966
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
You’re supposed to be gentle
with a damsel in distress.

967
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I am a Virgo, after all. Poor form!

968
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
<i>You mean, those earlier attacks…</i>

969
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
<i>He wasn’t aiming for me.</i>

970
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I’ll do better next time.

971
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Are you good?

972
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Of course, it’s my duty as a captain.

973
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Can’t have you kids risking your lives
without surpassing <i>my </i>limits.

974
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Agreed, fellas?

975
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Undoubtedly.

976
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
We will show you our power!
What makes us Magic Knights!

977
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Yuno! We’ve got your back covered.

978
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
You stay focused on attacking.

979
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Oh yeah?

980
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Well, at least you'll talk less
when I've killed you.

981
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
This so-called backup of yours?

982
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
They’ve been chained up all day
while we siphoned off their magical power

983
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
to fuel our magnificent fortress.

984
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
These guys are beat. I’m surprised
they can even stand at this point!

985
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
What good are these empty vessels
gonna do you?Oh, don’t tell me!

986
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
You think you can stand against me
'cause you've got nerve?

987
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Fine! Go ahead and try it!

988
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
But nobody can bounce back
from being drained <i>that </i>quickly!

989
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
You call yourself a Wizard King,
but you know so little.

990
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Not a chance!

991
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000

Yes, if Asta's successful,
the Wizard Kings will be felled.

1001
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
If he touches <i>their </i>sword
with his Demon-Slayer Sword,

1002
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
this will all be over.

1003
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
All we have to do
is keep him occupied here

1004

1005
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000

Wow. Nice of you to warn us, grandpa.

1010
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Gotta say I’m confused.

I thought your whole goal
was to kill us off.

1012

01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
You honestly thought
you could beat me

1027
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
when you attack with such
insignificant levels of magical power?

1028
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,000
My Mana Zone lowers the temperature
of this environment far below freezing!

1029
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Amateurs like you won’t be able to breathe
on the battlefield I have created.

1030
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Move, dang it!

1031
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I don’t understand,

1032
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
were you not all so oppressed
by this society?

1033
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Why do you reject our goal
of a fairer world?

1034
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
-Yeah, you <i>don’t </i>get it.
-Hmm?

1035
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Magic Knights
will give their all to survive.

1036
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Even if it’s hard,
there’s no way we’re giving up.

1037
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
You have no right
to take a person's life away from them.

1038
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Who do you think you are?!

1039
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Hmm.

1040
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Indeed.

1041
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
No man has that right.

1042
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
That’s exactly why things must change.

1043
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I’ll do what I must to create a society

1044
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
where outsiders and the powerless
can lead happy lives.

1045
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Empty words.

1046
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
You can’t justify it--

1047
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Weakness is also pitiable.

1048
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Legion Magic: Blink Castling.

1049
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
You’re wearing yourself out.

1050
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
And without ever coming close
to striking me.

1051
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Sleep now.

1052
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I refuse.

1053
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Not 'til I've incinerated
everything in sight!

1054
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
<i>Mana Zone: Full Release!</i>

1055
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
<i>Flame Magic…</i>

1056
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
<i>Calidos Brachium</i>…

1057
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
<i>Purgatory!</i>

1058
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Oh yes!

1059
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Now the fun really begins!

1060
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
"Mereoleona."
Is that what you said your name was?

1061
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
You made me raise my fist against you.

1062
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Interesting.

1063
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I like it!

1064
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
It's not often
that I get to use this on someone!

1065
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
You make for a suitable dance partner.

1066
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I'm pleasantly surprised.

1067
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
You’re a strong one.

1068
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
But you still don't compare to me.

1069
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Round two!

1070
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
<i>What are we gonna do, Yuno?</i>

1071
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
<i>At this rate,</i>
<i>Yami and the others won't last long!</i>

1072
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
I know that.

1073
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Captain Nozel!

1074
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Yuno, don't attempt something
beyond your power.

1075
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Know your strengths.

1076
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Focus on what
you're capable of achieving right now.

1077
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
And don’t bother worrying
about the rest of us.

1078
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
If possible, can you buy me
a little more time?

1079
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
I’ll finish him with my next blow!

1080
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
What’s the matter, Captain Macho Scruff?

1081
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Don’t tell me
you’ve run out of fight already?

1082
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
You have terrible taste
in nicknames.

1083
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Look closer, and you'll find that
underneath this scruff,

1084
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
I'm a blushing maiden. You see?

1085
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Don’t you know any other moves?

1086
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
<i>This kid…</i>

1087
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
<i>he’s pouring every bit</i>
<i>of his magical power into a single strike!</i>

1088
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
You pushed your way through
with sheer power after all.

1089
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Pretty unrefined for someone like you.

1090
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Fine.Now you’ve got
my full attention!

1091
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
For hundreds of years…

1092
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
you’ve continued to protect this land.

1093
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Watch, Lumiere.

1094
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
The world you envisioned
will come to pass.

1095
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I will bring your dream into existence.

1096
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Conrad!

1097
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
There you are.

1098
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Asta!

1099
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
I'm afraid you’re a little late
to stop me.

1100
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
For this world…

1101
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
No, don’t!

1102
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
…is finished.

1103
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
And in its place,
a new reality will thrive!

1104
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Stand down, Asta.

1105
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
I’ve driven the Imperial Sword’s magic
into the singular point.

1106
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
No one can stop
the fall of the Clover Kingdom.

1107
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
The fate of this land is sealed!

1108
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
No, it’s not!

1109
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I’m gonna pull that sword out
and make you eat your words!

1110
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Because I don't even know how to quit!

1111
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
I’ll follow through even if it kills me!

1112
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Hear me? You're the one
who should back off!

1113
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Poor child. You should take
what I’m about to say to heart, Asta.

1114
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
-My magic is 'never giving up'!
-My magic is 'never giving up'!

1115
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
If I’d had someone like you
around in my day,

1116
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,000
perhaps my loneliness
wouldn’t have been so all-consuming.

1117
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Goodbye, Mereoleona.

1118
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Round three.

1119
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Huh.

1120
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
This battle…

1121
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
…isn’t over yet!

1122
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
<i>Wait. Her power increased?!</i>

1123
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Explain!

1124
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
How can you still move?

1125
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Uh. Hey there.

1126
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Sup, Lady Mereoleona?

1127
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Good morning, big sis!

1128
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Good morning, Lady Mereoleona!

1129
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Big sister.

1130
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
'Cause I've got grit!

1131
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Also…

1132
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
if I kick the bucket in a place like this…

1133
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
…those idiots
will think they can laugh at me!

1134
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
And there’s another thing.

1135
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
If I’m not the strongest,

1136
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,000
then I can't call a certain someone…

1137
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
…my rival anymore!

1138
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,000
You draw strength
from your comrades, aye?

1139
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Not bad.

1140
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
But I must admit it’s not <i>my </i>style.
Still…

1141
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
You’ve done well, Mereoleona!

1142
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Honestly,
I think you could beat me in a fistfight.

1143
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
So let’s see!

1144
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Are you powerful enough
to best me when I go all-out?!

1145
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Oh jeez.

1146
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
You’re really feisty for a baby knight.

1147
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
You even made me use my trump card.

1148
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
If I had met you
when I was still the Wizard King,

1149
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
I might have made you one of my advisers.

1150
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Maybe!

1151
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
What you’re doing is not right!

1152
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Don’t gimme that.

1153
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:55,000
No one actually knows
what’s right and what’s wrong,

1154
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
so <i>you </i>don't get to make that judgment!

1155
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
We’re basically the same!

1156
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Conrad and I have big dreams,

1157
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,000
and there's nothing we won't do
to bring those dreams to life!

1158
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I get you. In a battle like this, the idea
of right and wrong kinda falls apart.

1159
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
So we’ll have to protect
what matters to us!

1160
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Until we have nothing left to give!

1161
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
<i>-Combo Spell…</i>
<i>-Combo Spell…</i>

1162
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
<i>Dimension Slash…</i>

1163
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
<i>-Scorching Light!</i>
<i>-Scorching Light!</i>

1164
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
You haven't won.

1165
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
A little scratch
isn’t enough to take <i>me </i>out.

1166
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
That’s a shame.

1167
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
<i>Asta, I’m borrowing your move.</i>

1168
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Here’s where we <i>are </i>alike.
I hate losing more than anything too!

1169
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Whatever.

1170
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,000
I don’t care about saving power
for the fortress anymore.

1171
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
I’ll pour everything we’ve got…

1172
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
…into crushing you fools!

1173
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Why can’t you accept
that I’m right?

1174
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,000
There's not a single part
of this unjust world

1175
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
worth protecting, boy!

1176
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Join me!
Let us build a new reality together!

1177
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,000
I don’t care about you
or your insane ideas.

1178
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
My dream is to become the Wizard King!

1179
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
What nonsense.

1180
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Becoming a Wizard King changes nothing
in this kingdom, believe me.

1181
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
No.

1182
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Nothing.

1183
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
I have you completely surrounded.

1184
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
That sword of yours will never touch me!

1185
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,000
No matter how much fire is in your heart,
this is beyond you!

1186
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I’ll make you an offer one last time.

1187
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Stand beside us, Asta.

1188
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
I'll even name you as my successor.

1189
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
The new world will need a new king.

1190
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
You’re crazy! Hell, no!

1191
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
You don’t ask someone
to make you the Wizard King!

1192
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,000
You earn the title
through your own merits!

1193
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,000
And you’re wrong. I <i>can </i>stop you.

1194
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
If there isn’t a way…

1195
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
…I’ll make one!

1196
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Y’know what this world taught me?

1197
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
To go harder and surpass my limits!

1198
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Good.
That was an impressive attack.

1199
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,000
And out of respect, I didn’t parry it.

1200
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,000
But I tire of hearing your naïve notions.

1201
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
And I'm done
playing pointless games.

1202
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
If we cannot walk this path together,

1203
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
there’s no point in holding back anymore.

1204
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Asta, I didn’t ask you
to join our cause because of your power.

1205
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,000
That would be welcome
but wholly unnecessary.

1206
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Nor was it because you know
this nation’s inequalities.

1207
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
I simply wanted someone
with the same determination as me

1208
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
to be rewarded in life.

1209
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Unfortunately, you chose
to keep your eyes clenched firmly shut!

1210
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
What a shame.

1211
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
<i>I'm neutralizing him</i>
<i>with my Anti-Magic,</i>

1212
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
<i>but I can't keep up!</i>

1213
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
That's it!

1214
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Finally, let's go.

1215
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
I’ve been waiting
for him to think he could go easy on us.

1216
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Exploding Fireball!

1217
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:41,000
From there, Flame Bondage Formation!

1218
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
<i>Full Reflection!</i>

1219
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,000
<i>Ice Wedge Magic: World End Martyr!</i>

1220
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:08,000
To be clear, this <i>is </i>me going easy on you.

1221
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Consider that to be a lesson,
young soldier.

1222
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,000
You think way too highly of yourself,
you old fart.

1223
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
<i>Come on, Asta. Hurry it up!</i>

1224
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
<i>Our magic isn’t going to hold out</i>
<i>much longer!</i>

1225
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Black Hurricane!

1226
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,000
It's admirable that you still manage
to keep your spirits high.

1227
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
but your movements are slowing down!

1228
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:41,000
One Horn Bull Thrust!

1229
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
No matter
how much you struggle against me,

1230
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
you’ll never bridge the gap between us!

1231
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Behold!
The power of the Wizard King!

1232
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
You can tell yourself that.

1233
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
But…

1234
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,000
I’ll never call
someone like you the Wizard King.

1235
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,000
<i>Crap. If I let my guard down,</i>
<i>my black form is done for.</i>

1236
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
<i>I need to land a solid hit</i>
<i>with everything I’ve got left.</i>

1237
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,000
You have a skewed idea
of what a king is capable of.

1238
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
You think the Wizard King's all powerful.

1239
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,000
But none were able to bring revolution
to this nation, including the first!

1240
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:33,000
In fact, Julius did quite the opposite
when he was beaten by the elves.

1241
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Or have you forgotten?!

1242
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Because of him,
the Clover Kingdom almost met its doom!

1243
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Changing nothing! Protecting nothing!

1244
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Every Wizard King
has been effectively useless.

1245
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
-It's not like that.
-Hmm?

1246
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
<i>You're forgetting</i>
<i>that the current Wizard King</i>

1247
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
<i>gave his own life to protect his citizens.</i>

1248
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Exactly like the first one did.

1249
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,000
And even after he’d given everything
to keep the kingdom safe,

1250
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
he kept on sleeping,

1251
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
<i>waiting for hundreds of years.</i>

1252
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
<i>And do you know why?</i>

1253
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
All so when we needed him again,
he’d be there!

1254
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,000
<i>The leaves of a clover</i>
<i>are said to each contain one thing.</i>

1255
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:23,000
<i>In the first three</i>
<i>dwells integrity, hope, and love.</i>

1256
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
<i>The fourth leaf</i>
<i>is given over to good luck.</i>

1257
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,000
<i>And in the fifth, there lives the devil.</i>

1258
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Is he seriously about to die again?

1259
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
This kid's such a piece of work.

1260
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:43,000
I suppose I’ll help, and then later,
I'll collect my payment in full.

1261
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Enough talk.

1262
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
You were able to become the Wizard King

1263
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
because a bunch of people
recognized your virtues!

1264
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,000
And betraying those people
makes you unfit to carry the title!

1265
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
You’re just a fake!

1266
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:05,000
'Cause a real Wizard King
inspires the people he protects!

1267
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
<i>He gives them a dream to chase after.</i>

1268
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
He's the opposite of useless!

1269
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:17,000
You still don’t understand
the true nature of the place you live.

1270
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Discrimination and prejudice run rampant.
You know that!

1271
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Haven’t you seen people’s hopes and dreams
crushed over and over again in this land?

1272
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Without my help,
this country will never change!

1273
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Our future
is not for you to decide!

1274
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Right now, no matter how rich
or royal someone is,

1275
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,000
everybody works together
to make sure we all live a better life!

1276
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
So stay out of our way!

1277
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Such insignificant improvements
will never break the cycle.

1278
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,000
You’re the one
in the way of progress!

1279
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
There you are.
Took long enough, but I feel like

1280
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:01,000
I'm finally getting a taste
of what the real you is all about!

1281
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Shut up!

1282
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I will no longer suffer
the fantasies of a child

1283
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,000
who knows nothing
of the real world!

1284
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
<i>Not good.</i>

1285
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
<i>My black form is coming undone!</i>

1286
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,000
I admit, there was a time
I trusted this country and its citizens.

1287
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,000
When I was the Wizard King, I championed
the incremental changes you speak of.

1288
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,000
But people are always bound to betray you.

1289
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
I’m sure you know something about that.

1290
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,000
So a small portion of your community
has changed for the better,

1291
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
do you honestly think
the rest of the country

1292
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
will alter their behavior as well?

1293
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
It’s not about change.

1294
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:46,000
It’s about coming together!
You wanna world in your own image!

1295
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:50,000
A place where <i>you’re </i>actually the only one
with the freedom to be happy.

1296
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Well, I wanna laugh with everyone!

1297
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,000
I want my friends to smile, always.

1298
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,000
That’s why we're gonna bring change
to this country together!

1299
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
You’ll all form a nation
full of citizens who respect each other.

1300
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
One where laughter is everywhere!

1301
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
That’s the kind of world
I’m gonna make a reality!

1302
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
My magic! It’s back!

1303
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:32,000

1305
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Yeah!

1306
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,000
You struggle in vain.

1307
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,000
This defiance only keeps you
from living in an ideal world.

1308
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Why fight against me?

1309
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,000
A truly ideal world,

1310
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,000
isn’t something
you have to force on other people!

1311
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
It’s something
we have to earn ourselves!

1312
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Noelle! Here! Look at me!

1313
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:02,000
<i>Mirror Magic: Mirror Brigade!</i>

1314
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:09,000
<i>The truth is</i>
<i>I used to resent this life as well.</i>

1315
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
<i>I was abandoned by my family</i>

1316
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
<i>because I couldn't learn</i>
<i>to control my magic powers.</i>

1317
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
<i>For a while,</i>
<i>I thought I was alone in this world.</i>

1318
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:21,000
<i>But now, I have amazing friends!</i>

1319
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
<i>Ones who make sure I know that I belong.</i>

1320
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,000
<i>They accepted me and my shortcomings.</i>

1321
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
<i>And they support me!</i>

1322
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
<i>They stand beside me</i>

01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000

…our limits!

01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Jeez. Just go already!

1334
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Leave it to me!

1335
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:21,000
This kingdom <i>can </i>get better.
We’re not fated to stay as we are now.

1336
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,000
We will not let you
take that chance away from us!

1337
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Hear me?!

1338
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
It’s our world.

1339
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:33,000
And we’ll change it……not you!

1340
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Do <i>you </i>give up?

1341
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Because I’m not finished yet.

1342
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
I can do this all day if you like.

1343
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
-However…
-Hmm?

1344
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,000
A better choice would be to work together.

1345
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
I don’t mean to brag.

1346
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
I can’t do anything
without the help of my friends.

1347
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,000
I nearly died a bunch of times,
but with them at my side,

1348
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I’ve been able to come
further than I thought possible!

1349
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Stop talking!

1350
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:25,000
I wanna world
of acceptance and happiness,

1351
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,000
where people are glad
to wake up and start a new day!

1352
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
You don't make something like that
by killing a bunch of people!

1353
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,000
No one will accept your world
if that's the price!

1354
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Tell me. What’s your name?

1355
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,000
It’s Noelle. Noelle Silva.

1356
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
A noble? Yes, of course.

1357
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I see now.

1358
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
You're a good girl, Noelle.

1359
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:23,000
You're a royal,
and yet you can empathize with the weak.

1360
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:28,000
If a person like you exists in this era,
there is still hope.

1361
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
C'mon, now of all times?

1362
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
You gotta be kidding me. What a joke.

1363
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Well, I, for one,
can still keep fighting.

1364
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
For many more rounds, I bet.

1365
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
But unfortunately, it’s my turn to sleep.

1366
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,000
I had an excellent time though.

1367
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
I did it.

1368
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I took him out, everyone!

1369
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
I am <i>not </i>finished!

1370
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
No. Not yet.

1371
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,000
This is a forbidden spell.

1372
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,000
One activated in exchange for my life!

1373
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Doom’s Gate!

1374
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Argh!

1375
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
One more chance.

1376
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:34,000
I will not give up
on achieving my goal, Asta!

1377
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:52,000
That’s fine.
'Cause I’m not done yet either.

1378
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
I’m gonna be

1379
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,000
the Wizard King.

1380
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
So I’ll keep standing.

1381
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
No matter what.

1382
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Just watch me!

1383
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Come on!

1384
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Let’s finish this!

1385
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Asta!

1386
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
I've got something for you.

1387
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
What do you mean?

1388
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
You won't need an explanation.

1389
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
That sword will lead the way.

1390
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,000
-The future of this nation…
-This magic…

1391
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
…lies with you.

1392
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
<i>I feel it.</i>

1393
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
<i>This power is coming from everyone!</i>

1394
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
<i>It's their hopes and dreams.</i>

1395
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:53,000
<i>I feel your spirits flowing through me!</i>

1396
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Stop, Master Nacht! What are you doing?

1397
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
You've gotta slow down.

1398
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:03,000
You’ve worked yourself ragged
since you got back to the Clover Kingdom.

1399
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:07,000
If you give up any more magical power,
you're gonna pass out for sure!

1400
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
A nice long nap
doesn’t sound like the worst idea.

1401
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Especially if it means someone who’s doing
a good thing gets rewarded.

1402
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
<i>Right here.</i>

1403
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
<i>Right now.</i>

1404
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
<i>Everyone.</i>

1405
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,000
We'll all surpass our limits.

1406
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
The Imperial Sword?

1407
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,000
What good do you think that will do you?

1408
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Asta. Do it.

1409
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,000
I <i>will </i>stop you!

1410
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Come on!

1411
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Why are you so hell-bent on destruction?

1412
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
I see things as they are.

1413
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
This country must burn!

1414
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
The nation is rotten to the core!

1415
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Its very foundation
must be razed and rebuilt anew!

1416
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Stand aside! I have to save everyone!

1417
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
I'm back

1418
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Who exactly do you mean by "everyone"?
Those you deem worthy?

1419
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
No! Those who are oppressed
and without hope in their lives.

1420
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
For their sake, I will create--

1421
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I…

1422
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
I… will…

1423
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Even if you’re a peasant
and don’t have magical power,

1424
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,000
you can still be
the strongest person in the world.

1425
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
You can be everyone’s hope.

1426
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,000
You’ll see. I’ll prove it to you, Conrad!

1427
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,000
One day…

1428
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,000
…I’ll be the Wizard King!

1429
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
<i>Did that boy</i>

1430
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
<i>just defeat me?</i>

1431
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
<i>How strange.</i>

1432
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
<i>If that’s the case,</i>

1433
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,000
<i>why do I feel so at ease?</i>

1434
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
<i>Ah.</i>

1435
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
<i>Now it’s making sense.</i>

1436
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,000
<i>Asta. Become the Wizard King.</i>

1437
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:19,000
<i>And then share the warm world</i>
<i>you hold in your heart</i>

1438
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
<i>with every citizen in this nation.</i>

1439
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
<i>Your magic is 'never giving up.'</i>

1440
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,000
<i>So I know you can do it.</i>

1441
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,000
<i>You are here too?</i>

1442
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
<i>I see.</i>

1443
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Conrad used to be
cheerful and honest.

1444
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
When he saw people struggling,
he empathized with them.

1445
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Everyone loved him.

1446
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,000
He was strong and kind.

1447
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,000
A man not unlike Asta.

1448
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
But he was framed by the royalists.

1449
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,000
His wife and his comrades
were slaughtered as a result, and after…

1450
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,000
he was never the same again.

1451
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Asta, thank you for stopping him.

1452
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,000
I’m confused.

1453
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Why was I able to tap into
the Imperial Sword there at the end?

1454
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
What do you mean?

1455
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
When we were fighting,
I hit him with my Demon-Slayer Sword.

1456
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,000
<i>Its magic must have been neutralized.</i>

1457
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
<i>So what happened?</i>

1458
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Ah, that’s simple.

1459
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
<i>Generations of Wizard Kings.</i>

1460
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
They watch these events unfold,

1461
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
and they lent
their miraculous power to you.

1462
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Whoa! That’s, like,
the coolest thing I’ve ever heard!

1463
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Oh, calm down.
He’s just teasing you, dummy.

1464
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
No, it’s true. I swear!

1465
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,000
<i>Rest assured, predecessors,</i>

1466
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:19,000
<i>the clovers who will carry this kingdom</i>
<i>into the future, are growing up nicely</i>.

1467
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Are you mocking Prince Lumiere?

1468
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:25,000
What do you think, Asta?
Aren’t Wizard Kings incredible?

1469
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Yes, sir!

1470
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,000
And one day,
I’ll be an incredible person too.

1471
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,000
When <i>I’m </i>the Wizard King!

1472
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,000
What a surprise, I caught you slacking.

1473
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Do you have any idea how hard I fought?!

1474
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Mmm?

1475
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
The place was in shambles,

1476
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,000
but it looks like it’ll get rebuilt
faster than I expected.

1477
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Yeah.

1478
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Conrad.

1479
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,000
He was a Wizard King.

1480
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,000
-Ouch!
-Mm-hmm.

1481
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Forget about him.

1482
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Good call.

1483
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,000
I'll be a proper Wizard King,
so it's fine.

1484
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Not so fast! We both know
I'll be the one calling the shots--

1485
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
-Can't hear you.
-Don't ignore me!

1486
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,000
You wanna go? Let's do it!
The Triumph may have been canceled,

1487
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:16,000
but I can still beat you in a one-on-one
match to prove I'm strongest.

1488
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Not a chance.

1489
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:30,000
I'm going to be the Wizard King!
