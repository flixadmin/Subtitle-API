1
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,480
Slut, ass, dick, pussy, boobs, fuck me.

2
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,480
When you hear such words...

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,640
just ignore them.

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,080
Don't think too much,
there's nothing to worry.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,200
Without your consent,
no one can even touch you.

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040
Got it?

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,400
When will the target
get interested in you?

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,120
When you behave different
from other girls.

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,360
That is when he'll notice you.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,400
I won't go with him.

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,840
And then whatever he says,
just say the opposite.

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,160
You have to challenge him.
The target will not expect this.

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,120
And will take more interest.

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,640
I get paid to have sex...

15
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,880
but you have to pay for it.

16
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,640
Don't try to be good.
You have to be the bad girl.

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,920
Don't talk to him with respect.

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,880
Instead, taunt him.

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,720
Come on.

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,040
All this will be new to him,
because he is well established.

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,240
Then he will take more interest in you.

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,240
We will have ten minutes to respond.
David, I am going to call you.

23
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,480
Okay? Be ready,
your phone should be around you.

24
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Excellent.

25
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,560
I like it.

26
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,800
Let's go.

27
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,240
Come on.

28
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520
Hold on.

29
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,680
You please wait here. I'll get the car.

30
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,760
What's wrong with you, brother Mhatre?

31
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,160
I have lost it. Come on.

32
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,760
Sit.

33
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,360
Just can't recognize you.

34
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,680
Check one, two, three.

35
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,360
Okay. All set?

36
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,920
-Take her.
-Yes, sir.

37
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,720
Sit there and wait.

38
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,440
Let's go. Come on.

39
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,440
Sir...

40
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,360
Where is Rupa?

41
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,040
I have no clue
about where she goes or with whom.

42
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,240
<i>People say
that she is meeting the wrong people.</i>

43
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,040
<i>Now they say it to our faces.</i>

44
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,400
<i>What is the use of you being in police, if
you can't save your sister from this mess?</i>

45
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,320
It's left open, look there.

46
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,240
Secret means...

47
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,120
Mhatre, answer your phone.

48
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,640
Secret means secret.

49
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,560
Sir, Mhatre here.

50
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,920
Yes, sir.

51
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,760
Okay, sir.

52
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,040
Bhumi...

53
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
They've called you to the headquarters.

54
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,520
Why?

55
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,320
Maybe they're happy with us,
so want to meet. Why the questions?

56
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,040
You go. I'll stay here.

57
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,280
You were also part of the operation,
not just us...

58
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,600
I mean...
You are the lead actress of the film.

59
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,640
I don't want to go there
and recall all that happened.

60
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,440
-You go ahead.
-Moron.

61
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,560
What you did was your duty.

62
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,560
This isn't my duty.

63
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,000
I did not join the police force
to do all this.

64
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,360
Some things are personal for me
and not for duty.

65
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,280
I will never go there again.

66
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,720
Bhumi...

67
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,160
Our operation is complete.

68
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,320
Now, it's time for promotion.

69
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,560
Don't lose this opportunity.

70
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,320
Brother Mhatre, please try to understand.

71
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,520
Will you be okay if an unknown man
touches you here and there?

72
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,720
Not a man, but if a woman...
touches me, I won't mind.

73
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,680
I'll do it as duty.

74
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,000
I will allow an unknown woman...
to touch me anywhere...

75
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,960
I got it.

76
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,520
Two charge sheets are ready, one is left.

77
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,160
-Okay, finish it, Vasudev. Good job.
-Okay.

78
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,360
Thanks, sir. Thank...

79
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,520
Come. Well done, Bhumi.

80
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,880
Come in. Come.

81
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,840
Well, there's new found interest
and respect in the officers for Bhumi.

82
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,720
This was your first operation...

83
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,400
and very successful.

84
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,880
Congratulations.

85
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,320
Thank you, sir.

86
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,920
Well done, Fernandez.

87
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,200
You chose her.

88
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,360
I don't know what you saw in her,
but she really worked.

89
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,640
I think we got lucky, sir.

90
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,240
Come on, Fernandez.

91
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,440
Learn to take compliments.

92
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,440
All this was your idea.

93
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,600
All of us were against it.

94
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,280
Actually, I was truly impressed
with the way she spoke to the target.

95
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,880
-I mean... the way you spoke to him...
-I understand English... sir.

96
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,320
You are very smart, Bhumi.

97
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,800
-Much more than what I had expected.
-You are right, sir.

98
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,360
When the target changed his location,
the entire team freaked out.

99
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,480
We thought... the operation was over.

100
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,320
But the way Bhumi handled the situation...

101
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,120
-Mhatre...
-Yes, sir?

102
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,320
Speak only when you are asked to.

103
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,360
-Till then, please stay quiet. Just relax.
-Okay, sir.

104
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,880
Most important thing is,

105
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,560
we've found that our target
is a part of some big plan.

106
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,280
And we're still wondering
how to proceed further.

107
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,440
So, whatever has happened
in this operation,

108
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,840
needs to be kept confidential.

109
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,720
Even from your co-officers
or cops at your police station.

110
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,320
Bhumi...

111
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,800
Do you want to say something?

112
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,200
No, sir.

113
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,080
Doctor has told me to do some exercises
twice or thrice a day.

114
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,280
-Is it?
-So I will feel energetic.

115
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,280
Don't overdo it, Mother.

116
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,600
You will feel giddy and faint.

117
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,480
I haven't even started as yet.
How is that overdoing?

118
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,320
I wonder what they're up to.

119
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,560
Hello, sir.

120
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,320
How are you doing?

121
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,040
Bhumi, come here. Sit.

122
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,280
The weather is so bad these days.

123
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,640
Just breathing can make you ill.

124
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,800
Pass the salt.

125
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,920
Rascal wants to eat fritters.

126
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,120
Onion and potato, both.

127
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,480
Serve him sauce as well.

128
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,840
Scoundrel won't like it without sauce.

129
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,320
Our mom is too lenient.

130
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,200
She should have directly asked him,
when is he vacating your house

131
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,080
and when is he giving you a divorce.

132
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,120
Instead, she is inviting him in
and offering him fritters.

133
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,440
Bhumi, come and sit.

134
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,920
Lokhande is doing well
in his business, he says.

135
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,360
He purchased
the next door shop as well. Right?

136
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,960
Why are you telling all this to her?

137
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,640
She is an officer.

138
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,040
Her skin has become
as hard as her uniform. Crisp.

139
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,680
She doesn't care for anything.

140
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,480
The tea has turned cold,
I'll get it heated up.

141
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,240
It's too hot, mother.

142
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,600
Court issued a date for next hearing.

143
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,600
Tuesday at 3:00 p.m.

144
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,520
If you don't show
up again, the case will be dismissed.

145
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,680
So, let it.

146
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,320
The advocate doesn't come
from Town to Bandra often.

147
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,840
The case will be dismissed.

148
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,360
When is the date?

149
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,480
Tuesday, 3:00 p.m.

150
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,160
No, I need to get the electricity
wire fixed that day.

151
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,360
It's giving me electric shocks these days.

152
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,000
Listen, Lokhande...

153
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,400
The case has been going on
since two years.

154
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,160
Why don't you go
and finish it off this time?

155
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,520
-I'm leaving, mother.
-Have lunch before you go.

156
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,360
Mother, I don't feel like going.

157
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,080
But I have work.

158
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,960
I'll come once I get free.

159
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,600
Everything is allowed here, isn't it?

160
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,960
He was openly flirting with me.

161
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,160
-Speak softly.
-What? Why should I?

162
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,640
Your husband was ogling at me.

163
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,320
What nonsense. It's not like that.

164
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,360
Is it? Do you think I am blind?

165
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,960
-He is gone. So just be quiet.
-No.

166
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,160
Everyone asks me to be quiet
as if I am at fault.

167
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,320
Because of her
we have to put up with that bastard.

168
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,920
If you wanted to leave him, why did you
have to leave your house?

169
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,280
It was your house,
you took the loan and you left.

170
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,960
What's the point in discussing now?

171
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,760
What's the point in not discussing?

172
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,520
Every time, he makes a different excuse.

173
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,280
He has usurped that house.

174
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,520
He knows that once he divorces you,
he will have to vacate it.

175
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,560
No matter what happens,
we have to bring him to the court.

176
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,120
How is this miracle going to happen?

177
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,040
I thought that now that I'm caught,
there will be some excitement.

178
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,440
But this is boring as hell.

179
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,760
<i>All I have to do is sit alone
and stare at the walls. That's it.</i>

180
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,760
Then someone walks in,

181
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,080
looks at me in style and walks away.
Then silence.

182
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,680
Then another one comes and it goes on.
Nothing else is happening here.

183
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Now that you are here...
tell me what should I do.

184
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,280
I'll do and leave immediately.

185
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,600
Hey, so soon?

186
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,800
Sir... please don't do this.

187
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,720
Have some mercy on me.

188
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,040
No, Sasya.

189
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,000
A lot is going to happen to you now.

190
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,800
Sir, I'm already screwed.

191
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,520
I've seen in movies what you cops
do with criminals.

192
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,640
I cannot bear your torture.
Let me be very clear to you.

193
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,200
I'm just a cowardly goon, sir.

194
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,960
If you call me a criminal,

195
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,800
then it's an insult
to other criminals in the world.

196
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,480
I won't be able to bear
your beatings. You really...

197
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,320
I'd rather tell you everything, sir.

198
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,160
Okay.

199
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,040
Start talking.

200
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,960
Ask what you want. I'll tell you.

201
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,040
I know that you are not alone.

202
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,840
There is an entire gang.
You are only a part of it.

203
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,600
And you all are up to something big.

204
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,560
Yes, you know half the story.

205
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,560
Tell me the rest.

206
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,840
Who's involved in this?

207
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,080
What is the entire plan?
Suppliers, feeders, tell me everything.

208
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,400
You may not know what to ask me,

209
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,080
but I very well know
what all I should tell you.

210
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,600
I have those answers
to which you don't even have questions.

211
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,680
I have so much to tell you, sir.

212
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,720
There should be someone to hear me out.

213
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,680
I have a small condition.

214
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,800
You please don't mind,
I am an ordinary man, so is my condition.

215
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,360
I will tell everything.

216
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,960
But I will only tell that girl.

217
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,600
Which girl?

218
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,760
The one you sent as a slut
that night to nab me.

219
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,080
As a slut?

220
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,640
I don't know any other word for it.
I am sorry.

221
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,200
But you know who I am talking about.

222
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,640
Have you lost it?

223
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,960
Sir, it might sound strange to you.

224
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,200
But think about it.

225
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,240
You have nothing to lose.

226
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,240
You may stay here and other cops
can also sit here and listen to it.

227
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,840
I will answer only those questions
that she will ask me.

228
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,920
This is my small condition.

229
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,560
Sasya, do you think

230
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,280
that you are in a position
to make such demands?

231
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,200
No, sir. I am well aware of my position.

232
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,960
I am on this side of the table
while you are on the other.

233
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,280
<i>You are a super cop
and I'm an evil rogue. Agreed.</i>

234
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,320
<i>But look at it
from a different perspective.</i>

235
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,920
<i>We are just two people
having a conversation.</i>

236
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,520
<i>You and I want the same things in life.</i>

237
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,560
<i>It's just that our styles of working
are a little different.</i>

238
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,400
I chased a dream of mine, for five years.

239
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,320
Everything was going smoothly.

240
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,480
And then that girl walked in...

241
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,960
My dream got shattered.

242
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,960
But there's no point in crying.

243
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
It won't help.

244
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,360
That is why, I am thinking
about your benefit.

245
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,000
You also think about mine.

246
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,920
You better become a preacher.

247
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,120
You have a bright future there.

248
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,440
-You are so good at giving lectures.
-Sir, you are...

249
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,320
How can I boast of myself?

250
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,400
I told you, I just need someone
who'll hear me out.

251
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,640
-What's that girl got to do with this?
-Sir, I landed here because of her.

252
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,720
She made me bite the dust.

253
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,400
Else, Sasya can't be nabbed so easily.

254
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,520
Not by a woman, for sure.

255
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,520
That's why, I respect her.

256
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,080
I'll salute her and reveal everything.

257
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,200
<i>No...</i>

258
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,080
The whole thing is very silly, Fernandez.

259
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,320
If we agree to this,
he'll come up with something else.

260
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,400
No, sir.

261
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,840
This is his only demand.

262
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,280
We can get the information
from him in our way.

263
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
Yes, we can.

264
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,120
He will tell us everything
without her help.

265
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,640
But what will we ask him, sir?

266
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,760
Meaning?

267
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,000
This is a very big operation.

268
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,680
It's a very complex game plan.

269
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,280
It's not like, I'll ask him the name
of a person and he'll tell us.

270
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,000
Sir, he is ready to be our informer.

271
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,960
He will tell us everything,
including what we don't ask him.

272
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,640
Taking him under confidence,
is a very good option right now.

273
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,840
But what is it about that girl,
I mean, the constable?

274
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,800
She is not a beauty queen as such.

275
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,320
Sir, this man is eccentric.

276
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,240
Just like other clever criminals
become eventually.

277
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,920
But she is just a constable.

278
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,400
She has no experience of interrogation.

279
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,800
Will she be able to face him?

280
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,520
Sir, in Sasya's words,
she is the girl who caught him.

281
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,280
She only has to sit in front and talk.

282
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,960
We'll steer everything else.

283
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,360
I think this is the best option
we have right now.

284
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,440
Hello, how are you?

285
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,280
Listen, the groom works as a driver.

286
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,520
His boss lives close by.

287
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,640
He drives a big car.

288
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,840
The wealthy man has four to five drivers,
but he is the head driver.

289
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,760
-They make a good pair as well.
-Quite a party.

290
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,880
-Who is getting married?
-I have no clue.

291
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,000
You want a gift?

292
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,360
Gift?

293
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,280
Is this for me?

294
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,280
-Here you go.
-Give it here.

295
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,600
-Give me. Pass me the phone.
-No...

296
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,880
Give me the phone. Hey...

297
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,920
Go.

298
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,080
I'm not feeling well.

299
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,360
Bhumi...

300
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,240
New phone?

301
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,720
Hemant gave it to me.

302
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,960
What is it, Mom?

303
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm feeling giddy.
I think my BP has dropped.

304
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,200
-Should I get you something to eat?
-No, take me home.

305
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,600
-Oh, dear.
-Wait a minute.

306
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,880
Rupa, let's go. Mom wants to go home.

307
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,480
You want me to come home at 4:00 o'clock?

308
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,840
Mom wants to go.

309
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,280
So, you go with her.

310
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,680
I've just come here. I'll come home later.

311
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,880
-What are you doing? It's not good.
-To whom?

312
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,920
What will I do with this girl?

313
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,640
She was clinging to him,
in front of everyone...

314
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,040
How will I face everyone?

315
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,960
Where did she learn this?

316
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,560
These are the qualities of her dad.

317
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,560
She has inherited from him.

318
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,960
What were you doing there?

319
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,440
Don't you have any shame?
What will I tell everyone?

320
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,480
Tell them,
your daughter is not in control.

321
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,720
Shut up. You were dancing so shamelessly.

322
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,160
Mom, stop lecturing me. Okay?

323
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,080
Her husband enters our house, ogles at me.

324
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,680
He talks nonsense.

325
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,440
If that is okay with you,
why pretend outside?

326
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,400
Don't change the topic.

327
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,520
You took a phone
from that boy and hugged him.

328
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,640
Tomorrow, you'll have to pay.

329
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,720
This free phone will cost you a bomb.

330
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,640
Mom, you have nothing to pledge
for my sake, do you?

331
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,840
So I'm helping myself.

332
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,760
Everything in this tenement is cheap.

333
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,840
I don't have anything so precious
to lock away in a safe.

334
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,680
So why not take it?

335
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,280
Rupa, don't talk like this to Mom.

336
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,760
How else should I talk?

337
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,160
Why are you opening your mouth now?

338
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,640
You were silent
when you should have spoken.

339
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,000
None of you supported me.
Now, you're here to lecture.

340
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,600
I cannot take this anymore.

341
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,120
The way she is going,

342
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,480
she will definitely get into some trouble.

343
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,280
You are in the police department.
Do something.

344
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,960
What is the use of you being in police?

345
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,560
Come on, Parab.

346
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,840
-See you again.
-Bye.

347
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,680
Parab, check there.

348
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,160
Randive, check upstairs.
Check every corner. Don't miss any.

349
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,680
What is it, sir?

350
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,880
We are doing our duty,
you do yours. Get aside.

351
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,640
-Where are you barging in?
-Should I take your appointment to go in?

352
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,560
What's going on?

353
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,520
What is the problem?

354
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,920
Smarty pant, don't act smart here.

355
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,600
Stay quiet till we finish our raid.

356
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,840
And don't interfere in police work.

357
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,960
Do you have a warrant?

358
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,320
Warrant? I don't need to get
a warrant for a fucker like you.

359
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,640
I got a tip about your hotel
which is enough.

360
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,480
What tip did you get? Who told you?

361
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,600
Are you the commissioner
that I should give a report to?

362
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,480
I'll slap you so hard that...

363
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,520
Okay, now I got the reason
behind this raid.

364
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,040
You got it, right? So, act sensibly.

365
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,440
And think twice before you
do anything wrong.

366
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,440
Wrong? You raided my place for your
personal grudges. Isn't that wrong?

367
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,080
If you utter a word more,
you'll be put behind the bars.

368
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,560
I'll be behind the bars?

369
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,200
You spoke another word.

370
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,880
Parab, take him in!

371
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,240
If we put him through a tire, he'll learn!

372
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,320
Well done.

373
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,120
Sit calmly and think.

374
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,200
Let us check the place.

375
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,440
-All is clear.
-Did you check the license? Check them.

376
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,400
Everything is okay.

377
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,640
-Check the CCTV footage.
-That's clear too.

378
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,480
Hey...

379
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,800
you say it's clear before hearing?

380
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,600
I heard you, I checked all
the footage. All clear.

381
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,000
And now your actions
are recorded in the CCTV.

382
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,120
You raided them without a warrant.

383
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,440
Only for personal grudges.
Your threat is recorded too.

384
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,720
-Hey...
-Hey, you!

385
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,000
I am not the commissioner,
but my friend's uncle is.

386
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,920
D.Y. Dikshit, eastern zone.

387
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,120
I didn't tell you earlier
because you would have stopped there.

388
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,400
I would not have got this proof.

389
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,840
What is this? Shut this.

390
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,240
It's our duty.

391
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,000
I will tell uncle Dikshit
that you performed your duty well.

392
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,920
Rupa's sister and what's your name?
Yes, Mhatre.

393
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,240
Listen, this is not fair.
Try to understand.

394
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,880
I will send this footage to the press.

395
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,000
You know how they long for such news.

396
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,480
They will also pay me well.

397
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,200
There was some confusion actually...

398
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,720
Yes, it was a confusion.
Let's take a selfie.

399
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,000
Put your phone down. Please.

400
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,000
-How will exaggerating the matter help?
-I have nothing to lose also.

401
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,880
Let us put an end to this. Okay?

402
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,640
I didn't start this.

403
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,840
Let's forget about it.
It's done and dusted.

404
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,520
It's a shut case. Okay?

405
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,760
Bhumi...

406
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,400
Don't ever do such things
in future. Got it?

407
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,240
Don't drag your personal problems to work.

408
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,760
That boy is a scoundrel, brother Mhatre.

409
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,520
Rupa is in danger.

410
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,400
How do I explain to you?

411
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,400
Will you tell the commissioner
that Rupa's in danger?

412
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,120
If Rupa is in danger, tell her!

413
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,080
She doesn't pay heed to my words.

414
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,520
Does that mean, you'll keep
raiding different places?

415
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,200
I thought he'll stay away
from her after this.

416
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,800
Now you stay away from him.

417
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,840
It's like we have given him an atom bomb.

418
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,400
He can explode it any time he wants.

419
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,720
He got convinced now.

420
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,760
But the suspense is not over yet.

421
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,400
Anything can happen. Stay alert.

422
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,720
Come.

423
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,720
Come on, Bhumi.

424
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,200
I've spoken to the senior officer
in your police station.

425
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,280
Till the interrogation is going on,
you will report at the crime branch.

426
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,480
And during the interrogation,
whatever Sasya reveals,

427
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,120
whatever we'll record,
everything will be highly confidential.

428
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,520
You cannot discuss it with anyone.

429
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,480
Not even with Mhatre.

430
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,480
-Okay, sir.
-You want to say something?

431
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,520
I won't do this... sir.

432
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,600
Why?

433
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,360
I don't want to meet that man again.

434
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,920
But why?

435
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,480
He doesn't have an answer
to why he wants to testify to me.

436
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,440
Then, I also have no answer.

437
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,840
I am sorry. I don't think I made
myself clear to you.

438
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,560
We aren't requesting you, Bhumi.

439
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,000
It's an order.

440
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,960
And it is already sanctioned.

441
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,720
Okay?

442
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,960
Sir, I've read this.
What should I do next?

443
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,120
Come, Bhumi.

444
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,000
Looking a little different...

445
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,040
But you're the same.

446
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,360
Shall we start?

447
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,760
Listen...

448
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,600
-Keep your personal comments to yourself.
-Sure, sir.

449
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,760
-So, tell me...
-I was 15 years old...

450
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,400
when my dad caught me one day.

451
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,680
I was having sex with a girl.

452
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,640
I used to call her my girlfriend
back then.

453
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,040
How is that connected to the case?

454
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,920
Sir, I am the connection.
I'll explain everything.

455
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,320
Hear me out, please.

456
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,040
My dad was a renowned goon
in the area at that time.

457
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,800
If I even heard his name,
I used to shit bricks.

458
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,800
He was so scary.

459
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,560
When he caught me, I thought
he'd break my bones today for sure.

460
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,960
But he had a different plan.

461
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,240
He said: "Why did you stop?
Finish it off."

462
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,160
He sat there to watch.

463
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,320
Not just that, he even
called a few of his friends.

464
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,080
All of them sat together
to watch the scene.

465
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,040
I performed as best as I could.

466
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,480
From every side, I banged.

467
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,880
I had to.

468
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,040
Poor girl.

469
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,080
She committed suicide
next day due to embarrassment.

470
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,040
Since then, I've had this fear.

471
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,360
To never leave any job undone.

472
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,960
Be it any work or business,
I finish what I start.

473
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,280
You understand, don't you?

474
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,320
Whatever we started that day...

475
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,480
we have to finish.
