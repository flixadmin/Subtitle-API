1
00:00:01,924 --> 00:00:04,125
- Previously on Gotham...
- On the count of three,

2
00:00:04,168 --> 00:00:06,030
instead of telling me who you love,

3
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:07,935
- tell me who to kill.
- Kill Lee.

4
00:00:07,978 --> 00:00:11,313
You chose Lee because you love Vale.

5
00:00:11,381 --> 00:00:13,315
If a person comes into
contact with my blood,

6
00:00:13,383 --> 00:00:14,483
it changes them.

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,922
Listen to me! I would never
do anything to hurt you.

8
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,023
Kristen.

9
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:22,224
No!

10
00:00:22,292 --> 00:00:23,559
You wanted to save Lee.

11
00:00:23,627 --> 00:00:25,294
You knew he would do the opposite.

12
00:00:25,362 --> 00:00:27,429
You love Lee, which means we're done.

13
00:00:27,497 --> 00:00:29,498
I have found someone. I have no choice

14
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:31,667
- but to confess my feelings to Ed.
- Da.

15
00:00:31,735 --> 00:00:33,769
Is this about the test they're
running on Alice Tetch's blood?

16
00:00:33,837 --> 00:00:36,205
Yes. The rats were exhibiting
manic tendencies...

17
00:00:36,273 --> 00:00:38,407
- Violent rage.
- I assume they're, uh,

18
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:39,475
working on a cure.

19
00:00:39,542 --> 00:00:41,043
Yes, but it could take years.

20
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:41,977
Nobody move!

21
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:43,712
What is going on?

22
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,447
I'm afraid your evening
has been hijacked.

23
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:48,617
Glasses down!

24
00:00:48,685 --> 00:00:51,053
Is that my dear sister I see?

25
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:52,521
She's in you, isn't she?

26
00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:54,390
- Miss Kringle?
- No, my name's Isabella.

27
00:00:54,457 --> 00:00:55,958
You remind me of someone
that I used to know.

28
00:00:56,026 --> 00:00:56,926
I met someone.

29
00:00:56,993 --> 00:00:58,594
I think I'm in love.

30
00:00:58,662 --> 00:01:00,729
I want to rejoin the GCPD.

31
00:01:00,797 --> 00:01:01,931
Welcome back, Detective.

32
00:02:16,206 --> 00:02:18,307
GCPD! Hands in the air!

33
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:20,843
Back away, slowly.

34
00:02:22,812 --> 00:02:24,580
This ain't what it looks like.

35
00:02:24,647 --> 00:02:26,782
Explain it to me down at the precinct.

36
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,585
For now, you'd be wise
to keep your mouth shu...

37
00:02:36,393 --> 00:02:38,660
Listen, uh, can we talk about this?

38
00:02:39,896 --> 00:02:41,964
Be reasonable, man.

39
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:44,867
Look, I didn't kill anybody, okay?

40
00:02:44,934 --> 00:02:47,703
I'm the cleaner, that's it.

41
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:49,738
You're just the cleaner.

42
00:02:49,806 --> 00:02:52,074
Yeah.

43
00:02:52,142 --> 00:02:54,209
You're just the guy
who chops up the bodies

44
00:02:54,277 --> 00:02:56,178
and dumps them in a vat of acid.

45
00:02:56,246 --> 00:02:57,479
That's it.

46
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:03,652
What are you doing, man?

47
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,955
Just... take me in, okay?

48
00:03:07,023 --> 00:03:08,490
Oh, I'll bet that's what you want.

49
00:03:08,558 --> 00:03:10,659
For me to read you your rights,

50
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:11,994
make sure you get a lawyer.

51
00:03:12,062 --> 00:03:14,463
Two, three years from now,
I see you on some corner,

52
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:15,998
free as a bird.

53
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:18,534
Any other night, yeah.

54
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:22,838
It would eat at me,
but, yeah, I'd do it.

55
00:03:22,906 --> 00:03:24,840
Not tonight.

56
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,320
The Toad.

57
00:03:27,365 --> 00:03:28,811
He-he's the one you
want. He gave me the job.

58
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:31,487
See, something's gotten into me.

59
00:03:32,415 --> 00:03:33,715
When I see a scumbag like you,

60
00:03:33,783 --> 00:03:35,918
my blood starts boiling in my veins.

61
00:03:35,985 --> 00:03:38,987
I just want to punish
you, make you suffer.

62
00:03:39,055 --> 00:03:42,258
Up until now, I've been
able to control it.

63
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:46,662
But it's getting stronger inside of me.

64
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:48,153
Please.

65
00:03:48,198 --> 00:03:50,366
The Toad, I told you.

66
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:52,001
He's the one.

67
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:53,502
Just arrest me.

68
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,737
Arrest me!

69
00:03:54,805 --> 00:03:55,971
We're past that.

70
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,406
Please!

71
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,419
Morning.

72
00:04:05,486 --> 00:04:06,954
We knew what we were
getting into, right?

73
00:04:07,021 --> 00:04:09,556
When we agreed to let my dad
throw us an engagement party?

74
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,126
Oh, we knew.

75
00:04:13,194 --> 00:04:15,429
I mean, who are these people?

76
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:16,597
He's very proud of you.

77
00:04:16,664 --> 00:04:18,799
And he wants all of Gotham to know that.

78
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:21,401
Well, he succeeded, 'cause
he invited most of the city.

79
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,071
How are you so okay with this?

80
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,006
Because I agree with him.

81
00:04:26,074 --> 00:04:28,408
He should be proud. As am I.

82
00:04:30,378 --> 00:04:32,079
How did I get so lucky?

83
00:04:38,753 --> 00:04:40,454
What is it?

84
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,059
James Gordon is returning to the GCPD.

85
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:49,914
- When?
- He starts today.

86
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,102
Um... how long have you known this?

87
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,103
A few days.

88
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,628
I'm sorry, I should
have told you sooner.

89
00:05:00,441 --> 00:05:02,643
It's fine.

90
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,711
Is it?

91
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:06,880
I don't know, Lee.

92
00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:08,815
We agreed he wouldn't
be part of our lives.

93
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:10,717
A-And now you're gonna
be working with him?

94
00:05:10,785 --> 00:05:12,219
That's a part of our lives.

95
00:05:12,286 --> 00:05:13,620
Do you trust me?

96
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,988
Because if you do,

97
00:05:15,056 --> 00:05:16,990
then nothing else matters.

98
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,060
Of course I trust you.

99
00:05:20,128 --> 00:05:21,862
And you're right, you're right,

100
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:23,831
it's all gonna be okay. It's just...

101
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,366
when I think about what
happened with Tetch,

102
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:28,769
a-and the things that Gordon said, I...

103
00:05:28,836 --> 00:05:30,338
So, don't think about it.

104
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:33,306
I'll try.

105
00:05:34,512 --> 00:05:36,777
But if you accidentally shot him...

106
00:05:36,844 --> 00:05:38,278
I'd be okay with that, too.

107
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:39,946
No promises.

108
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:43,013
See you tonight.

109
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,654
Yeah.

110
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,862
Lock this bum up.

111
00:06:03,337 --> 00:06:04,337
Hey, hey, hey!

112
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,772
There you are.

113
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,375
We got a call. Warehouse
district. You coming?

114
00:06:08,443 --> 00:06:10,110
That's it? No "welcome back"?

115
00:06:10,178 --> 00:06:12,446
Please. If we had a big to-do
every time you came back

116
00:06:12,513 --> 00:06:14,681
to the GCPD, we'd never
catch any bad guys.

117
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:15,582
Ándale, partner.

118
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,851
Oh, and, uh,

119
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,753
I believe this...

120
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:21,188
belongs to you.

121
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,991
You coming or what?

122
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,127
Yeah, I'm coming.

123
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,233
What must be broken
before it can be used?

124
00:06:33,301 --> 00:06:34,468
Eggs.

125
00:06:34,535 --> 00:06:36,403
Correct! As always.

126
00:06:38,906 --> 00:06:42,576
Oh, Edward, you spoil me.

127
00:06:42,643 --> 00:06:44,177
You make it easy.

128
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,048
I'm gonna miss you.

129
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,484
I'm only gone two days.

130
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:52,352
Well, actually, your conference

131
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,122
ends at 1:45 on Monday.

132
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:58,492
With traffic, that puts
you in at 5:30 into Gotham.

133
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,893
If you leave on time today,

134
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,395
which I'm sure that you will... Mm-hmm.

135
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,197
You'll be gone for 44
and one half hours.

136
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:06,800
Less than two days.

137
00:07:08,035 --> 00:07:10,065
I will hold on to that thought.

138
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,706
Cream! I forgot your cream.

139
00:07:12,774 --> 00:07:14,040
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

140
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:18,073
So what does one do at a
librarian's conference?

141
00:07:18,913 --> 00:07:21,047
It would bore you.

142
00:07:21,115 --> 00:07:25,331
Nothing that you would say,
do or think could bore me.

143
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,456
In that case, let me
read you my schedule.

144
00:07:29,524 --> 00:07:30,957
Ooh!

145
00:07:37,231 --> 00:07:39,417
Where did those glasses come from?

146
00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:40,693
These?

147
00:07:40,738 --> 00:07:43,470
These are my backup pair.
I normally wear contacts.

148
00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:45,272
I thought you knew that.

149
00:07:46,707 --> 00:07:48,208
Something wrong?

150
00:07:51,612 --> 00:07:53,814
Edward, what is it?

151
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:56,449
You look like you've seen a ghost.

152
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,485
Excuse me.

153
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:13,366
It's just a pair of glasses.

154
00:08:15,403 --> 00:08:18,672
I remember you loved that style on me.

155
00:08:23,444 --> 00:08:25,178
Oh, dear.

156
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,615
I haven't upset you, have I, Ed?

157
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:31,518
I would've thought you
would've been used to

158
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:33,920
seeing people in mirrors.

159
00:08:33,988 --> 00:08:35,555
You're just in my head.

160
00:08:35,623 --> 00:08:37,490
Like that makes a difference.

161
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:41,228
But honestly, besides the fact
that she looks just like me,

162
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:44,898
you went from someone who files
papers in a police station

163
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:47,901
to someone who files books in a library.

164
00:08:47,969 --> 00:08:49,436
Not super original.

165
00:08:49,503 --> 00:08:51,338
You and Isabella are...

166
00:08:53,307 --> 00:08:54,975
you're somewhat different.

167
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:57,777
Well, I'm dead.

168
00:08:57,845 --> 00:08:59,112
And she's alive.

169
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:01,882
But how long will that last?

170
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,918
Until you...

171
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:06,519
I...

172
00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:10,523
I would never hurt Isabella.

173
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:14,235
Bet you would've said
the same thing about me.

174
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,264
Face it, Ed.

175
00:09:17,331 --> 00:09:18,965
You're a killer.

176
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:22,202
It's only a matter of time before...

177
00:09:31,358 --> 00:09:34,727
Okay, so, a uni I.D.'d the vic.

178
00:09:34,794 --> 00:09:37,897
One Paulie Penopolus,
aka Paulie Pennies.

179
00:09:37,964 --> 00:09:39,698
Cleanup guy for the Gotham underworld.

180
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:42,067
Bingo. I'm thinking it was
some kind of business deal.

181
00:09:42,135 --> 00:09:43,502
Maybe an unhappy customer.

182
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,204
Perhaps a competitor.

183
00:09:45,272 --> 00:09:46,405
Good place to start.

184
00:09:46,473 --> 00:09:48,001
Hey, listen, seriously, Jim...

185
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:50,976
I'm glad you're back.

186
00:09:51,044 --> 00:09:52,411
Me too, Harv.

187
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:53,779
Feels good.

188
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:13,117
This wasn't just business.

189
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:16,569
We should call Barnes.

190
00:10:28,103 --> 00:10:30,783
You know why I'm here.

191
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,186
Oh, yes.

192
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:36,393
Yes, indeed.

193
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:38,526
She's in there, isn't she?

194
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:41,208
Inside of you.

195
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:48,000
Hello, sister dear.

196
00:10:54,457 --> 00:10:55,690
Just tell me.

197
00:10:57,132 --> 00:10:58,399
You grew up with your sister.

198
00:10:58,467 --> 00:11:01,068
You've seen this virus firsthand.

199
00:11:01,136 --> 00:11:03,204
How do I beat it?

200
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:04,171
Hmm.

201
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:06,307
I believe

202
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,743
the way this works is...

203
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,040
you give me something,
I give you something.

204
00:11:12,063 --> 00:11:13,587
Ticktock.

205
00:11:13,643 --> 00:11:15,650
How's about I let you keep your teeth?!

206
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:16,384
Or...

207
00:11:16,451 --> 00:11:18,085
my sister's virus

208
00:11:18,153 --> 00:11:19,520
is a beautiful thing.

209
00:11:19,588 --> 00:11:22,390
It makes the darkest
parts of a person sing.

210
00:11:23,425 --> 00:11:26,594
What darkness in you...

211
00:11:26,662 --> 00:11:30,297
has Alice brought to life?

212
00:11:30,365 --> 00:11:31,966
Tell me that,

213
00:11:32,034 --> 00:11:34,135
and I'll tell you everything I know.

214
00:11:41,943 --> 00:11:43,511
Criminals.

215
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,881
The guilty.

216
00:11:46,948 --> 00:11:49,350
My anger at them.

217
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:52,787
Oh, but it's not anger I see.

218
00:11:54,356 --> 00:11:57,058
Rage.

219
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,126
Violent, bloody

220
00:11:59,194 --> 00:12:01,362
rage.

221
00:12:03,532 --> 00:12:05,466
All right, Tetch, my turn.

222
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:08,302
Is there a cure?

223
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:14,408
Yes.

224
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:16,744
There is a cure.

225
00:12:16,812 --> 00:12:18,512
What is it?

226
00:12:20,148 --> 00:12:21,382
You give in,

227
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,118
and let my dear sister win!

228
00:12:24,186 --> 00:12:26,020
You think I'm playing?!

229
00:12:26,088 --> 00:12:27,321
Have you heard the voices?

230
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:29,290
What voices?

231
00:12:29,357 --> 00:12:32,326
The virus, even as it grows
stronger, waxes and wanes.

232
00:12:32,394 --> 00:12:34,495
You may have the illusion

233
00:12:34,563 --> 00:12:36,564
you're winning.

234
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,566
Then you hear the voices.

235
00:12:39,898 --> 00:12:43,738
Those dark voices from deep within you,

236
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:47,208
whispering... whispering...

237
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,010
and finally,

238
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:53,414
you'll see the world as it really is.

239
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:57,284
Then there will be no
more Captain Barnes,

240
00:12:57,352 --> 00:12:59,386
only Alice.

241
00:13:01,056 --> 00:13:03,057
My dear Alice.

242
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,525
You don't know me!

243
00:13:04,593 --> 00:13:06,994
You've dirtied your hands, haven't you?

244
00:13:07,062 --> 00:13:10,865
And now you're desperately
trying to make it right.

245
00:13:13,235 --> 00:13:15,402
I can make it right.

246
00:13:29,618 --> 00:13:30,951
You're back.

247
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,355
I'm back.

248
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:36,690
I suppose it was only a matter of time.

249
00:13:37,474 --> 00:13:39,827
Once a cop, always a cop.

250
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:52,239
For better or worse,
this is where I belong.

251
00:13:52,307 --> 00:13:55,298
- How's Vale?
- Good. I think.

252
00:13:55,354 --> 00:13:57,111
She's out of the hospital, anyway.

253
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:59,680
- You two are not...?
- No.

254
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,438
I'm not trying to make this awkward.

255
00:14:04,506 --> 00:14:07,474
Why would it be? We're both adults.

256
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,143
There's no reason we
can't work together.

257
00:14:09,211 --> 00:14:10,744
I'm glad you feel that way.

258
00:14:10,812 --> 00:14:11,979
Mario agrees?

259
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:14,884
He will. Eventually.

260
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:16,450
Right.

261
00:14:16,518 --> 00:14:18,519
Our engagement party is tonight.

262
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:21,597
I only bring it up because
a few people here are going.

263
00:14:22,157 --> 00:14:24,225
Now it's awkward, isn't it?

264
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:25,593
A little.

265
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,328
You want to know about the two bodies

266
00:14:27,395 --> 00:14:29,063
that, uh, were found this morning.

267
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,331
Yes.

268
00:14:30,398 --> 00:14:31,732
I've only done the
preliminary examination,

269
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,236
but the John Doe in the acid,
his face had been removed.

270
00:14:35,303 --> 00:14:37,438
Removed? How?

271
00:14:37,505 --> 00:14:38,739
Scalpel? Razor blade?

272
00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:40,708
Whoever did it knew exactly
what they were doing.

273
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:43,043
I'll have more for you soon.

274
00:14:43,111 --> 00:14:44,111
Jim.

275
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,716
I think you made the right
decision coming back.

276
00:15:02,097 --> 00:15:03,297
I know this doesn't exactly look like

277
00:15:03,365 --> 00:15:05,466
"just business," but
right now we're thinking

278
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:07,334
whoever paid Paulie Pennies
to dispose of the body

279
00:15:07,402 --> 00:15:09,436
in the bathtub, also
might have killed him

280
00:15:09,504 --> 00:15:11,138
to tie up some loose ends.

281
00:15:11,206 --> 00:15:12,840
Uh-huh.

282
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:17,645
Jim. Good to see you
with a shield again.

283
00:15:17,712 --> 00:15:18,712
And a tie.

284
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,047
Captain, good to be back.

285
00:15:20,115 --> 00:15:21,649
Bullock was just filling me in.

286
00:15:21,716 --> 00:15:23,577
Hell of one to catch on your first day.

287
00:15:23,611 --> 00:15:24,639
Yeah.

288
00:15:24,661 --> 00:15:27,187
That's the preliminary report from Lee.

289
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:30,024
John Doe had his face removed.

290
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,494
- Trying to cover up his identity?
- Yeah, maybe.

291
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:35,195
But the acid would
have done that anyway.

292
00:15:36,264 --> 00:15:37,798
I'm running point on this one.

293
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:40,167
- That's cool.
- Honestly, Cap...

294
00:15:41,202 --> 00:15:43,304
Look, I know I've been away...

295
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:44,471
Maybe that's why

296
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:46,907
you've forgotten how
things go around here.

297
00:15:46,975 --> 00:15:49,043
I give you an order and you follow it.

298
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,445
Which, for the record,
Captain, I totally support.

299
00:15:51,513 --> 00:15:54,415
I'm taking point on this,
not giving you the day off.

300
00:15:54,482 --> 00:15:56,717
Follow the physical evidence, Bullock.

301
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:58,419
Report back to me.

302
00:15:58,486 --> 00:16:00,454
Aye, aye.

303
00:16:00,522 --> 00:16:02,356
Jim.

304
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,228
I didn't mean to bite your head off.

305
00:16:08,296 --> 00:16:11,598
It's just, sometimes the
ugliness here gets to me.

306
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:12,666
No need to explain.

307
00:16:12,734 --> 00:16:14,234
Let me know if you need anything.

308
00:16:14,302 --> 00:16:16,670
And, uh...

309
00:16:16,738 --> 00:16:20,407
don't let the bastards
haze you too hard, rookie.

310
00:16:20,475 --> 00:16:22,409
Yes, sir.

311
00:16:23,478 --> 00:16:25,779
Gordon.

312
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:27,414
Here's the one you wanted, Captain.

313
00:16:27,482 --> 00:16:29,783
Uh, mid-level felon, goes by "The Toad."

314
00:16:29,851 --> 00:16:32,986
Yeah, that's him. Thank you.

315
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,304
Maybe she's right.

316
00:16:50,372 --> 00:16:52,573
What if there's something
about Miss Kringle's...

317
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,409
Kristen's... Isabella's face?

318
00:16:55,477 --> 00:16:57,478
What if there's something
about her face that

319
00:16:57,545 --> 00:16:59,313
unlocks this side of me?

320
00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:01,415
What if I do hurt her?

321
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:04,385
Oswald.

322
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:07,287
- Yes?
- You're smiling.

323
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:10,257
- I was?
- Yes.

324
00:17:10,325 --> 00:17:11,558
Oh.

325
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:14,748
Well, I was just thinking...

326
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,932
how darned lucky Isabella is.

327
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,336
You love her, yet to protect her,

328
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:25,205
you are willing to break up with her.

329
00:17:25,273 --> 00:17:26,807
Beautiful.

330
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,243
Sad, but beautiful.

331
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,958
So you think I should break up with her?

332
00:17:30,992 --> 00:17:33,947
I'm sorry, I thought that's
what we were talking about.

333
00:17:34,015 --> 00:17:35,482
Certainly, I would never pressure...

334
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,451
No, you're right.

335
00:17:41,222 --> 00:17:43,657
If I did hurt her, I would
never forgive myself.

336
00:17:45,927 --> 00:17:47,928
That life would put
her in your path again,

337
00:17:47,996 --> 00:17:50,764
only to snatch her from you. Why?

338
00:17:50,832 --> 00:17:52,232
I can't do it.

339
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,131
- What?
- I can't break up with her.

340
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,837
But you said yourself...

341
00:17:56,905 --> 00:17:58,672
I need you to do it for me.

342
00:18:00,008 --> 00:18:01,442
Would you do that?

343
00:18:01,509 --> 00:18:04,378
I would be forever in your debt.

344
00:18:05,547 --> 00:18:07,347
Just be gentle.

345
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:12,352
Of course.

346
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:27,601
I'm looking for a punk who supposedly

347
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:29,269
frequents this rat hole.

348
00:18:29,337 --> 00:18:32,406
Goes by "The Toad."

349
00:18:32,474 --> 00:18:34,408
Who's askin'?

350
00:18:38,947 --> 00:18:43,350
Captain Nathaniel Barnes of the GCPD.

351
00:18:43,418 --> 00:18:45,319
How about you and I go
down to the precinct,

352
00:18:45,386 --> 00:18:48,222
and you can answer some questions?

353
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:49,423
Blow, pig.

354
00:19:05,773 --> 00:19:07,841
I want to know about Paulie Pennies!

355
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:09,943
The body he was getting
rid of last night...

356
00:19:10,011 --> 00:19:12,279
Where did it come from?!

357
00:19:12,347 --> 00:19:15,082
Maybe you want me to
open that mouth for you.

358
00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:16,850
Okay, stop.

359
00:19:16,918 --> 00:19:18,018
I-I hired Paulie.

360
00:19:18,086 --> 00:19:19,520
But I'm just a go-between.

361
00:19:19,587 --> 00:19:22,155
I'm so sick of hearing that.

362
00:19:22,223 --> 00:19:24,491
No one's responsible for anything.

363
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,692
Everyone's a middleman.

364
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,561
I want a name!

365
00:19:27,629 --> 00:19:30,230
Symon, okay? Dr. Symon.

366
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:32,766
He's a big-time plastic surgeon.

367
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:36,403
So what, he likes cutting
people's faces off for kicks?

368
00:19:36,471 --> 00:19:37,638
- Try again!
- No.

369
00:19:37,705 --> 00:19:39,473
He's got a side business.

370
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,942
You get in trouble, you need a new face,

371
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,778
he gives you one.

372
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:45,979
A new face?

373
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,447
- Whose?
- I don't know.

374
00:19:47,515 --> 00:19:49,416
I just get rid of the
bodies, that's all.

375
00:19:55,156 --> 00:19:56,356
You think

376
00:19:56,424 --> 00:19:58,292
you're not guilty,

377
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,459
but you are.

378
00:19:59,527 --> 00:20:00,727
Stop, okay, stop!

379
00:20:00,795 --> 00:20:02,696
It's Symon!

380
00:20:02,764 --> 00:20:05,399
He's the one you want.

381
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:07,334
You're a cop.

382
00:20:12,574 --> 00:20:13,840
Symon, huh?

383
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:16,442
Take me to him.

384
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,220
Mayor Cobblepot?

385
00:20:28,288 --> 00:20:31,938
Hello, Isabella. May I?

386
00:20:32,008 --> 00:20:34,159
Um, of course.

387
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:44,685
Going somewhere?

388
00:20:44,804 --> 00:20:46,920
Just for a couple nights.

389
00:20:46,943 --> 00:20:49,654
But I was hoping to talk
to Ed before I left.

390
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,627
Um, tried calling him. Is he okay?

391
00:20:52,943 --> 00:20:56,034
Hmm. Yes.

392
00:20:56,102 --> 00:20:57,636
How shall I put this?

393
00:21:00,006 --> 00:21:01,539
It's over.

394
00:21:02,254 --> 00:21:03,742
Excuse me?

395
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:05,477
He is not going to see you anymore.

396
00:21:05,544 --> 00:21:07,779
Do not try to contact him.

397
00:21:07,847 --> 00:21:09,481
That door is closed.

398
00:21:10,568 --> 00:21:12,150
Have a nice life.

399
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,691
Oh, my.

400
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:21,693
It is a shock.

401
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:23,295
But besides your...

402
00:21:23,362 --> 00:21:26,402
odd resemblance to his ex...

403
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,601
a certain facility with riddles...

404
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,738
compulsion for order...

405
00:21:33,806 --> 00:21:36,374
what is it that you two
really have in common?

406
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:39,577
Edward is a person of
exceptional intelligence

407
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:41,046
and imagination.

408
00:21:41,113 --> 00:21:44,516
He deserves to be appreciated
by someone on his own level.

409
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,184
And you,

410
00:21:46,252 --> 00:21:49,354
my dear, are simply not.

411
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:52,157
Best to end things now.

412
00:21:52,224 --> 00:21:54,726
You're right.

413
00:21:56,195 --> 00:21:57,896
I don't deserve him.

414
00:21:57,963 --> 00:22:00,332
Glad we agree.

415
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:01,900
Bye.

416
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:03,458
But I'm not gonna let him go.

417
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:08,823
He loves me. And I love him.

418
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:13,912
Do you know how rare that is, Mr. Mayor?

419
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:20,054
Of course you do.

420
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:23,290
Because you love him, too.

421
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,027
I can see it.

422
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:29,730
I'm not even jealous.

423
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:32,199
I-I don't think that you understand...

424
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,101
It was my glasses this morning.

425
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:35,803
They reminded him of Miss Kringle.

426
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:39,440
He's afraid he's going to
hurt me like he hurt her.

427
00:22:42,811 --> 00:22:45,479
Listen to me, you little idiot,

428
00:22:45,547 --> 00:22:48,015
I am telling you one last time,

429
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:52,152
- let... Ed... go.
- No.

430
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,353
I will write to him.

431
00:22:53,421 --> 00:22:56,290
I will make him understand
he has nothing to fear.

432
00:22:56,357 --> 00:22:58,726
I'm not gonna let him go.

433
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,297
Very well.

434
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:06,600
Don't say I didn't warn you.

435
00:23:22,383 --> 00:23:24,418
You better not have been lying to me.

436
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,520
I'm not. This is his place.

437
00:23:26,588 --> 00:23:28,922
You're not gonna kill me, are you?

438
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:32,726
I'm trying.

439
00:23:37,313 --> 00:23:39,080
I'm about to take the face.

440
00:23:39,148 --> 00:23:41,549
Be here in an hour, and
we can do the transplant.

441
00:23:42,651 --> 00:23:45,353
You haven't eaten today, have you?

442
00:23:45,421 --> 00:23:47,922
Very good.

443
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,924
I have to thank you, my dear,

444
00:23:49,992 --> 00:23:52,293
for taking such care of your skin.

445
00:23:52,361 --> 00:23:55,263
Excellent elasticity.

446
00:23:55,331 --> 00:23:58,766
Now hold still.

447
00:24:05,207 --> 00:24:06,774
Who's there?!

448
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:11,245
Quiet. Or we'll forgo any anesthesia.

449
00:24:12,147 --> 00:24:13,147
I said, who's there?

450
00:24:13,215 --> 00:24:15,149
GCPD.

451
00:24:15,217 --> 00:24:16,517
You're under arrest.

452
00:24:16,585 --> 00:24:17,685
Go for it.

453
00:24:19,288 --> 00:24:20,288
Please.

454
00:24:23,517 --> 00:24:24,984
I surrender.

455
00:24:25,052 --> 00:24:27,699
Ma'am, you all right?

456
00:24:41,035 --> 00:24:42,836
How many?

457
00:24:42,903 --> 00:24:43,837
Excuse me?

458
00:24:43,904 --> 00:24:45,138
How many have you killed?!

459
00:24:45,206 --> 00:24:46,472
How many faces have you taken?

460
00:24:48,342 --> 00:24:50,777
I have the right to an attorney.

461
00:24:50,845 --> 00:24:52,545
I wish to invoke

462
00:24:52,613 --> 00:24:54,247
that right... now.

463
00:24:54,315 --> 00:24:57,684
Guilty.Guilty.

464
00:24:57,751 --> 00:24:59,786
Who's there?! Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

465
00:24:59,854 --> 00:25:02,222
No one. It's only me.

466
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:04,624
Guilty. He's guilty! Guilty.

467
00:25:04,692 --> 00:25:07,360
- Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
- What is wrong with you?

468
00:25:07,428 --> 00:25:09,295
He's guilty. Guilty.

469
00:25:13,601 --> 00:25:14,734
What are you doing?

470
00:25:14,802 --> 00:25:16,269
Arrest me.

471
00:25:16,337 --> 00:25:19,339
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

472
00:25:19,406 --> 00:25:21,608
- I'm not resisting!
- Guilty!

473
00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:24,010
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

474
00:25:24,078 --> 00:25:25,812
Guilty. He's guilty.

475
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,314
Guilty.

476
00:25:30,584 --> 00:25:32,552
The point Dr. Thompkins hopes you pay

477
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,388
particular attention to is
the level of strength required

478
00:25:35,456 --> 00:25:39,879
to sever Paulie Pennie"
head from his torso.

479
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,895
And what level would that be, Lucius?

480
00:25:41,962 --> 00:25:43,149
Extreme.

481
00:25:43,205 --> 00:25:45,045
Extreme strength. Got it.

482
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,800
As for the other victim in the
bathtub, we haven't gotten any hits

483
00:25:47,868 --> 00:25:50,403
on his prints, but a puncture
mark in his arm suggests

484
00:25:50,471 --> 00:25:53,373
he was drugged prior to
having his face removed.

485
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,708
I'll run toxicology, I'll let
you know what I come up with.

486
00:25:55,776 --> 00:25:56,843
Thanks, Lucius.

487
00:25:56,911 --> 00:25:58,111
Yep.

488
00:25:58,178 --> 00:26:00,469
It's good to have you back, Gordon.

489
00:26:01,181 --> 00:26:03,383
Lucius, you're in
forensics, not the M.E.

490
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:06,447
Is there a reason Lee
didn't bring this herself?

491
00:26:07,221 --> 00:26:09,822
Dr. Thompkins has
already gone for the day.

492
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,424
Her engagement party.

493
00:26:12,386 --> 00:26:14,090
Right.

494
00:26:14,135 --> 00:26:16,496
I hear it's gonna be quite the affair.

495
00:26:16,563 --> 00:26:17,697
Beautiful women,

496
00:26:17,765 --> 00:26:19,933
free booze, canapés.

497
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,897
- Harvey, you can go if you want.
- Oh, no.

498
00:26:21,954 --> 00:26:24,170
I'd much rather spend time
here with my old partner.

499
00:26:24,238 --> 00:26:25,805
Much more fun.

500
00:26:25,873 --> 00:26:27,707
Besides,

501
00:26:27,775 --> 00:26:28,841
I wasn't invited.

502
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,580
Captain!

503
00:26:33,648 --> 00:26:35,449
Bullock, book this
piece of human garbage

504
00:26:35,516 --> 00:26:37,451
for the murder of John Doe.

505
00:26:37,518 --> 00:26:39,419
You got it, Captain. Come on.

506
00:26:41,222 --> 00:26:42,389
Plastic surgeon.

507
00:26:42,457 --> 00:26:44,124
Face man for the underworld.

508
00:26:45,193 --> 00:26:46,993
He had a girl on the table.

509
00:26:47,061 --> 00:26:49,029
If I had been there
five minutes later...

510
00:26:49,097 --> 00:26:50,130
But you weren't.

511
00:26:50,198 --> 00:26:52,032
You did it, Captain.

512
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,734
Yeah.

513
00:26:53,801 --> 00:26:55,035
Today.

514
00:26:58,239 --> 00:27:00,741
You know that feeling, Jim,
when you've won the battle

515
00:27:00,808 --> 00:27:02,776
but you know you're gonna lose the war?

516
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,813
Wars are fought one
battle at a time, sir.

517
00:27:10,141 --> 00:27:12,152
You said he killed the John Doe?

518
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,788
- Not Paulie Pennies?
- No.

519
00:27:14,856 --> 00:27:16,590
His killer's still out there.

520
00:27:17,517 --> 00:27:19,292
I'll get him tomorrow.

521
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,534
Promise.

522
00:28:07,614 --> 00:28:11,517
My father and I haven't
always seen eye to eye.

523
00:28:13,687 --> 00:28:16,953
But I think, Dad, you'll agree that...

524
00:28:17,845 --> 00:28:20,735
marrying Lee is the best
decision I've ever made.

525
00:28:20,836 --> 00:28:23,138
Without a doubt.

526
00:28:23,205 --> 00:28:25,106
And Lee.

527
00:28:25,174 --> 00:28:27,776
You're a doctor, a member of our city's

528
00:28:27,843 --> 00:28:30,078
police department.

529
00:28:30,146 --> 00:28:33,715
You're funny, compassionate
and brilliant.

530
00:28:33,783 --> 00:28:37,118
Despite insisting all dogs are boys

531
00:28:37,186 --> 00:28:40,221
and all cats are girls...

532
00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:42,905
it's hopeless, I've
tried to correct her...

533
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,061
I've loved you since
the moment I saw you.

534
00:28:56,272 --> 00:28:58,440
So wonderful.

535
00:28:58,507 --> 00:29:00,375
Lee.

536
00:29:00,443 --> 00:29:02,590
Congrats.

537
00:29:03,078 --> 00:29:05,079
You look gorgeous. No surprise.

538
00:29:05,147 --> 00:29:06,681
- Barbara. How did you...
- Get in?

539
00:29:06,749 --> 00:29:09,184
As a plus one. With that guy there.

540
00:29:09,251 --> 00:29:10,485
Hey.

541
00:29:10,553 --> 00:29:11,653
Or it might have been him.

542
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,688
You need to leave, right now.

543
00:29:13,756 --> 00:29:15,223
Can't we bury the hatchet?

544
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:18,593
So I came at you with a knife,
kidnapped you, whatever.

545
00:29:18,661 --> 00:29:20,495
I've forgiven you for
beating me unconscious.

546
00:29:20,563 --> 00:29:21,796
Water under the bridge.

547
00:29:21,864 --> 00:29:23,331
You just stay right here,
I'm gonna get someone.

548
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:25,090
I'm leaving.

549
00:29:25,968 --> 00:29:27,936
Just wanted to ask.

550
00:29:28,003 --> 00:29:30,772
As someone else who was
once with Jim Gordon,

551
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,340
don't you miss it?

552
00:29:32,408 --> 00:29:33,641
Miss what?

553
00:29:33,709 --> 00:29:35,910
The heat.

554
00:29:35,978 --> 00:29:40,648
Being so close to so
much darkness and light,

555
00:29:40,716 --> 00:29:42,984
to someone always at war with himself.

556
00:29:43,052 --> 00:29:45,286
Let me think... Tormented Jim Gordon,

557
00:29:45,354 --> 00:29:49,257
or Mario, who I know is a good man,

558
00:29:49,325 --> 00:29:51,392
who'll be a wonderful
father to my children,

559
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,760
and whom I love.

560
00:29:52,828 --> 00:29:56,097
No. I don't miss it.

561
00:29:56,165 --> 00:29:57,298
Wow.

562
00:29:57,366 --> 00:29:59,534
I think you actually believe that.

563
00:29:59,602 --> 00:30:01,669
It's kind of sad.

564
00:30:01,737 --> 00:30:04,973
Tell my dates I've left, would you?

565
00:30:07,276 --> 00:30:08,343
Uh-uh.

566
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,545
Don't let her ruin your night.

567
00:30:10,613 --> 00:30:12,480
Captain. I'm so glad you came.

568
00:30:12,548 --> 00:30:14,716
I-I can't stay.

569
00:30:14,783 --> 00:30:16,691
I came to congratulate you.

570
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:18,620
You deserve to be happy.

571
00:30:18,687 --> 00:30:20,121
Thank you.

572
00:30:20,189 --> 00:30:22,257
But you have to stay
for at least one drink.

573
00:30:22,324 --> 00:30:23,224
If nothing else,

574
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:25,827
to save me from these people.

575
00:30:25,895 --> 00:30:27,495
One drink.

576
00:30:27,563 --> 00:30:29,697
- But no work talk.
- Deal.

577
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,068
So, among the materials
confiscated in Symon's lab,

578
00:30:34,136 --> 00:30:37,238
I came across a unique
anesthetic cocktail.

579
00:30:37,306 --> 00:30:38,606
Let me guess.

580
00:30:38,674 --> 00:30:41,109
The same cocktail toxicology
found in the John Doe.

581
00:30:41,176 --> 00:30:42,644
Exactly.

582
00:30:42,711 --> 00:30:45,962
Hey. I got some bad news.

583
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:48,152
- Symon walked.
- What?

584
00:30:48,186 --> 00:30:50,618
The girl he had tied up
refused to press charges.

585
00:30:50,686 --> 00:30:51,886
They probably paid her off.

586
00:30:51,954 --> 00:30:54,556
And we just got an
order from Judge Bam-Bam

587
00:30:54,623 --> 00:30:57,064
demanding his immediate release.

588
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,977
The Botox son of a
bitch is uber-connected.

589
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:03,386
The toxicology definitely ties
Symon to the John Doe murder.

590
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:06,401
We got to get him back here.

591
00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:12,006
Captain Barnes?

592
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:15,443
Carmine Falcone.

593
00:31:15,511 --> 00:31:17,245
I don't believe we've met.

594
00:31:17,313 --> 00:31:18,713
No.

595
00:31:18,781 --> 00:31:21,316
But I was just leaving.

596
00:31:21,383 --> 00:31:22,684
I see.

597
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:24,852
Is my company so odious?

598
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,454
You belong behind bars.

599
00:31:26,522 --> 00:31:28,489
I'm retired.

600
00:31:28,557 --> 00:31:32,293
After running Gotham's
underworld for 30 years.

601
00:31:34,163 --> 00:31:36,798
This city was built
because of men like me.

602
00:31:36,865 --> 00:31:39,033
People have jobs because of men like me.

603
00:31:39,101 --> 00:31:41,436
That whiskey you're drinking?

604
00:31:41,503 --> 00:31:42,937
Paid for through my work.

605
00:31:43,005 --> 00:31:45,907
So you did some good. So what?

606
00:31:45,975 --> 00:31:47,976
Doesn't mean you're above the law.

607
00:31:48,043 --> 00:31:49,377
Nobody is.

608
00:31:49,445 --> 00:31:51,713
You know, whenever I hear a man

609
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,548
possessed of such certainty,

610
00:31:53,616 --> 00:31:57,218
I always think he's trying
mostly to convince himself.

611
00:31:59,154 --> 00:32:01,990
I wish you a pleasant evening, Captain.

612
00:32:20,976 --> 00:32:22,243
Hey, Captain.

613
00:32:22,311 --> 00:32:23,645
Alvarez.

614
00:32:23,712 --> 00:32:26,047
Tell Gordon I'm bringing
him the man responsible

615
00:32:26,115 --> 00:32:28,516
for Paulie Pennies' murder.

616
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,113
No backup.

617
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:32,082
He's coming in of his own accord.

618
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,550
Sure thing, Captain.

619
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,820
But you should know, the
judge released Dr. Symon.

620
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:37,954
Captain?

621
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,425
Guilty.

622
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:43,860
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

623
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:45,595
Guilty. Guilty.

624
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:46,396
Guilty!

625
00:32:46,456 --> 00:32:48,924
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

626
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,034
Guilty! Guilty.

627
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:52,769
Guilty.

628
00:33:02,164 --> 00:33:04,365
Isabella.

629
00:33:08,504 --> 00:33:10,638
Isabella, I got your note.

630
00:33:12,808 --> 00:33:15,977
I thought you needed to
leave for your conference.

631
00:33:16,045 --> 00:33:18,109
I can be late, Edward.

632
00:33:23,485 --> 00:33:25,607
This is more important.

633
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,625
Oswa...

634
00:33:32,394 --> 00:33:34,462
Oswald...

635
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:37,131
the mayor, he informed me
of your position, um...

636
00:33:37,199 --> 00:33:41,369
but believe me, I-I think...
our breaking up is for the best.

637
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:44,672
No, Edward, it's not.

638
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:49,171
I understand your fear. It
comes from a place of love.

639
00:33:49,378 --> 00:33:52,046
I know you won't hurt me.

640
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:56,217
You never could.

641
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:58,186
I don't think that you...

642
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:02,857
Oh, my...

643
00:34:02,925 --> 00:34:04,626
Kristen.

644
00:34:04,693 --> 00:34:07,695
I found old photos in newspapers.

645
00:34:07,763 --> 00:34:10,064
You have to... I need to leave now.

646
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,399
No, no, no, no, no.

647
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,201
No, no, no, no. Look at me.

648
00:34:13,269 --> 00:34:14,435
Look at me!

649
00:34:14,503 --> 00:34:15,837
You don't know what you're doing.

650
00:34:15,904 --> 00:34:18,539
I am forcing you to face your fear.

651
00:34:18,607 --> 00:34:20,708
You won't hurt me, even
when I look like this.

652
00:34:20,776 --> 00:34:22,610
Edward.

653
00:34:22,678 --> 00:34:24,746
Edward.

654
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:37,492
No, no, no, no.

655
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:39,994
No, no, no, no, no.

656
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:50,042
Edward.

657
00:34:58,113 --> 00:35:00,315
Should I take the glasses off?

658
00:35:00,382 --> 00:35:02,050
Keep them on.

659
00:35:10,923 --> 00:35:13,792
Seal off the exits, but do it quietly.

660
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:15,060
Last thing anyone wants

661
00:35:15,127 --> 00:35:16,828
- is a scene.
- Yes, sir.

662
00:35:16,896 --> 00:35:17,962
Little late for that.

663
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,098
What are you doing here?

664
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:22,133
I'm sorry, but we have to make an arrest

665
00:35:22,201 --> 00:35:24,202
in the Paulie Pennies
case. We tried to get

666
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,770
the guy at home, but his housekeeper

667
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:27,138
said he was here. Just makes you realize

668
00:35:27,206 --> 00:35:28,840
what a small town Gotham is, doesn't it?

669
00:35:28,908 --> 00:35:30,275
Couldn't you wait?

670
00:35:30,342 --> 00:35:31,843
If he's here, he's not exactly running.

671
00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:33,445
She makes a good point, Jim.

672
00:35:33,512 --> 00:35:34,813
You want to take that one?

673
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,147
Good evening, everyone.

674
00:35:36,853 --> 00:35:39,317
Jim. What's going on?

675
00:35:39,385 --> 00:35:42,053
Apparently, there's a murder
suspect among our guests.

676
00:35:42,121 --> 00:35:43,221
Can I ask who?

677
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:44,956
Dr. Maxwell Symon.

678
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,858
- He's a...
- Plastic surgeon.

679
00:35:46,926 --> 00:35:48,526
You arrest him, you're
gonna have to fight off

680
00:35:48,594 --> 00:35:49,694
every woman here.

681
00:35:49,762 --> 00:35:50,895
He's a favorite.

682
00:35:50,963 --> 00:35:53,198
He's also a murderer.

683
00:35:53,265 --> 00:35:55,834
I'd be curious to know
how your father knows him.

684
00:35:55,901 --> 00:35:57,268
I'm sure that their relationship

685
00:35:57,336 --> 00:35:59,270
is completely above board.

686
00:35:59,338 --> 00:36:01,973
While you two hash this out,
I'm gonna go grab Symon.

687
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:04,375
- Harvey.
- What? I can handle

688
00:36:04,443 --> 00:36:05,376
a plastic surgeon on my own.

689
00:36:05,444 --> 00:36:06,644
And don't worry,

690
00:36:06,712 --> 00:36:08,747
discretion is my middle name.

691
00:36:11,217 --> 00:36:13,818
Lee, I'd like a word with Jim.

692
00:36:13,886 --> 00:36:15,820
- Mario...
- It'll be fine.

693
00:36:15,888 --> 00:36:17,989
Okay.

694
00:36:31,237 --> 00:36:33,972
Look, Mario, I have a job to do,

695
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:35,740
so whatever this is...

696
00:36:35,808 --> 00:36:37,675
When you told Tetch to kill Lee,

697
00:36:37,743 --> 00:36:39,277
you knew he would do the opposite.

698
00:36:39,345 --> 00:36:42,881
You sacrificed your
girlfriend for my fiancée.

699
00:36:42,948 --> 00:36:43,782
That's insane.

700
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:45,950
Can we just admit you still love her?

701
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,620
- I don't have time for this.
- Hey.

702
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:52,357
You once told me that
if I ever hurt Lee,

703
00:36:52,424 --> 00:36:53,324
you'd kill me.

704
00:36:53,392 --> 00:36:54,726
Well, now it's my turn.

705
00:36:55,371 --> 00:36:57,362
I love Lee and I'll do

706
00:36:57,429 --> 00:36:59,531
whatever I have to to keep her.

707
00:36:59,598 --> 00:37:00,965
Then word of advice...

708
00:37:01,834 --> 00:37:04,369
lose the jealousy.

709
00:37:04,436 --> 00:37:05,770
It's weak.

710
00:37:07,406 --> 00:37:09,086
Gordon.

711
00:37:18,184 --> 00:37:20,919
For Lee, I'll give you that one.

712
00:37:38,103 --> 00:37:41,239
Oh, Captain... if you
keep frowning like that,

713
00:37:41,307 --> 00:37:43,741
you'll never get those
wrinkles out around your mouth.

714
00:37:44,944 --> 00:37:47,145
Come down to my office tomorrow.

715
00:37:48,459 --> 00:37:50,281
I'll give you a free evaluation.

716
00:37:57,656 --> 00:37:58,957
I'm surprised you can feel that

717
00:37:59,024 --> 00:38:00,658
through that thing you call a face.

718
00:38:00,726 --> 00:38:02,126
What are you doing?!

719
00:38:02,194 --> 00:38:04,629
What I should have done all along.

720
00:38:09,368 --> 00:38:11,202
You're insane.

721
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:12,871
Oh, no, Doc.

722
00:38:12,938 --> 00:38:15,373
I'm saner than I've ever been.

723
00:38:15,441 --> 00:38:18,476
I'm seeing things clearly...

724
00:38:18,544 --> 00:38:21,379
for the very first time.

725
00:38:21,447 --> 00:38:23,848
All these years, I've put
my trust in the system,

726
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:26,951
my trust in the law, held myself back

727
00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:29,667
from doing what I really wanted to do.

728
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,691
And then I saw the truth.

729
00:38:33,759 --> 00:38:36,094
It's not just you that's guilty.

730
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,331
This whole city is guilty.

731
00:38:40,399 --> 00:38:41,332
Stop.

732
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:46,125
You're a police officer, for God's sake!

733
00:38:46,498 --> 00:38:48,339
You have to follow the law.

734
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:50,308
I don't have to do anything.

735
00:38:50,376 --> 00:38:51,643
I am the law.

736
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:54,245
I am judge...

737
00:38:55,281 --> 00:38:56,381
jury...

738
00:38:57,416 --> 00:39:00,118
and executioner!

739
00:39:27,269 --> 00:39:29,166
Ed.

740
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:32,439
- How'd she take it?
- What?

741
00:39:32,507 --> 00:39:34,775
Oh. Uh, um... everything is...

742
00:39:36,011 --> 00:39:37,177
wonderful.

743
00:39:37,245 --> 00:39:39,646
Isabella showed me that, uh...

744
00:39:40,233 --> 00:39:42,082
I was worried over nothing.

745
00:39:49,242 --> 00:39:51,492
I'm so happy for you.

746
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:53,685
But... why are you back?

747
00:39:53,753 --> 00:39:55,362
Well, she had to go to her conference.

748
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,697
I insisted.

749
00:39:56,765 --> 00:39:58,632
You're a good man.

750
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,367
But you look done in.

751
00:40:00,435 --> 00:40:02,503
I will hear all about it tomorrow.

752
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,505
Get some sleep.

753
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:19,553
Got to give her credit.

754
00:40:19,621 --> 00:40:21,922
She fought for him.

755
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,391
Too bad she underestimated her opponent.

756
00:40:25,794 --> 00:40:27,695
I'm assuming it's done.

757
00:40:27,762 --> 00:40:29,196
Yup.

758
00:40:29,264 --> 00:40:30,998
Feel kind of bad, though, boss.

759
00:40:31,066 --> 00:40:33,701
I always liked librarians.

760
00:40:33,768 --> 00:40:35,502
You?

761
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,148
What about poor Ed?

762
00:40:38,807 --> 00:40:40,941
He will be heartbroken.

763
00:40:43,278 --> 00:40:46,246
Luckily, he has a shoulder to cry on.

764
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:03,097
Uh-oh. Come on. No, no.

765
00:41:05,834 --> 00:41:07,668
Oh, come on. Uh-oh.

766
00:41:09,104 --> 00:41:11,472
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

767
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:12,873
Help me, help me! Somebody, help!

768
00:41:12,941 --> 00:41:15,109
Oh, dear.

769
00:41:21,549 --> 00:41:24,284
Jim, you and Mario
have a heart-to-heart?

770
00:41:24,352 --> 00:41:26,653
- Yeah. Where's Symon?
- No luck.

771
00:41:26,721 --> 00:41:28,263
He must have skedaddled.

772
00:41:29,524 --> 00:41:31,058
I thought he might be at the bar.

773
00:41:31,126 --> 00:41:32,159
Uh-huh. Okay.

774
00:41:32,227 --> 00:41:34,061
Keep a perimeter in
case he shows back up.

775
00:41:34,129 --> 00:41:35,863
I'm gonna head to his house.

776
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,910
And, Harvey, uh... take it easy, huh?

777
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:41,034
It's good to have you back again, Jim.

778
00:41:41,102 --> 00:41:42,707
- Uh-huh.
- I'm real glad.

779
00:41:45,173 --> 00:41:46,173
Captain.

780
00:41:46,241 --> 00:41:48,317
- Did you hear?
- Everything.

781
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:50,043
I saw Symon here earlier.

782
00:41:50,111 --> 00:41:51,345
You manage to pick him up?

783
00:41:51,413 --> 00:41:53,879
Not yet. He must've skipped
out when we showed up.

784
00:41:53,936 --> 00:41:54,985
We'll get him.

785
00:41:54,997 --> 00:41:58,008
Alvarez said you were bringing in
the guy who did Paulie Pennies.

786
00:41:58,426 --> 00:42:00,220
Turned out to be a dead end.

787
00:42:01,293 --> 00:42:03,190
I'll let you know when I find Symon.

788
00:42:03,258 --> 00:42:04,825
Jim.

789
00:42:04,893 --> 00:42:07,880
Things are gonna change around here.

790
00:42:08,185 --> 00:42:10,719
You and I are gonna make
a difference in this city.

791
00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:13,600
We're gonna clean it up.

792
00:42:14,934 --> 00:42:16,187
Yes, sir.

793
00:42:29,818 --> 00:42:33,954
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

794
00:42:34,022 --> 00:42:35,522
Guilty. Guilty.

795
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,658
Guilty!

796
00:42:37,725 --> 00:42:40,227
Guilty! Guilty!

797
00:42:40,295 --> 00:42:41,929
Guilty.

798
00:42:41,996 --> 00:42:43,096
Guilty.

799
00:42:43,164 --> 00:42:45,866
Guilty.Guilty.

800
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,799
GCPD. Sir?

801
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:03,157
Dr. Symon.

802
00:43:05,663 --> 00:43:06,882
Who did this?

803
00:43:11,764 --> 00:43:13,287
Barnes.
