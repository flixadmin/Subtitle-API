1
00:00:20,676 --> 00:00:24,513
Pablo Escobar said, "Sometimes I'm God.

2
00:00:25,139 --> 00:00:28,309
If I say a man dies,
he dies the same day."

3
00:00:31,603 --> 00:00:35,273
In his career, this asshole
killed thousands of police officers

4
00:00:35,357 --> 00:00:38,068
at a rate of over 400 a year.

5
00:00:38,986 --> 00:00:42,823
With numbers like that staring you
in the face, you have to ask...

6
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:45,826
what possesses a man to put on a uniform

7
00:00:45,909 --> 00:00:49,621
that all but
guarantees his days are numbered?

8
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:55,294
Most of them were just kids,

9
00:00:55,377 --> 00:00:58,881
raised to reach a fork in the
road and choose the right path.

10
00:01:00,507 --> 00:01:02,384
Fight for the good guys.

11
00:01:04,178 --> 00:01:06,722
They were young,
they were full of hope...

12
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:09,725
and they thought they were invincible.

13
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:15,939
And those that were left behind
would feel their loss the most.

14
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,859
Everybody's got a breaking point,

15
00:01:18,942 --> 00:01:22,112
when shit sickens them so much
that they just have to act.

16
00:01:24,448 --> 00:01:28,619
For Pinzón, that
breaking point meant resignation.

17
00:01:31,747 --> 00:01:33,894
But there were those
who couldn't resign,

18
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,983
who couldn't just walk away.

19
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:39,546
Presidents have breaking points, too.

20
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:44,176
And Gaviria had finally found his.

21
00:08:36,546 --> 00:08:38,924
- We're safe!
- Pass me the ball.

22
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:40,926
- Here you go.
- Here it is.

23
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:20,150
This is Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela.

24
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:21,776
And if you've never heard of him,

25
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,154
it's because that's exactly
the way he wants it.

26
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:27,699
Ask him what he does for a living
and he'll tell you that he's a banker,

27
00:10:27,782 --> 00:10:29,325
and that would be true.

28
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:32,537
In fact, he and his brother Miguel
controlled their own bank.

29
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,540
Or he might tell you that he
and his brother owned and operated

30
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:38,334
one of Colombia's
largest chains of drug stores.

31
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:39,987
The brothers could also tell you they

32
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,988
ran their own soccer
team. Which they did.

33
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:46,634
América de Cali, one of
the best teams on the continent

34
00:10:46,718 --> 00:10:49,929
and a fierce rival of Pablo's
Atlético Nacional.

35
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:55,018
But what they'd never tell you is
that these businesses were a front

36
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:56,978
and that the Rodríguez brothers

37
00:10:57,062 --> 00:10:59,856
were the second biggest
cocaine traffickers in the world:

38
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:03,109
The leaders of the Cali cartel.

39
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:06,279
Like Pablo and the Medellín cartel,

40
00:11:06,362 --> 00:11:09,949
they started out as run-of-the-mill
criminals, bank robbers.

41
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:12,577
And with all that money
they scored from their heists,

42
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,205
they quickly
graduated to smuggling weed.

43
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:18,082
And when they realized
that ten pounds of blow

44
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,210
was worth as much as a ton of marijuana,

45
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:23,213
they jumped headfirst
into the cocaine business.

46
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:26,174
These guys were no
piece of shit street dealers.

47
00:11:26,257 --> 00:11:30,553
They planned meticulously,
maximizing profit, minimizing risk.

48
00:11:30,637 --> 00:11:34,015
As the business grew, a young
ambitious Colombian kid,

49
00:11:34,098 --> 00:11:38,520
a guy you might know named
Pacho Herrera, was such a good earner

50
00:11:38,603 --> 00:11:41,397
that the brothers eventually
promoted him to partner.

51
00:11:42,106 --> 00:11:46,069
But they had a competitor,
and not just any competitor.

52
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:47,610
One that wasn't interested in

53
00:11:47,635 --> 00:11:49,847
abdicating the
throne as the king of coke.

54
00:11:49,906 --> 00:11:52,867
- Don Pablo.
- But Gilberto was smart.

55
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:54,953
He didn't care that Escobar
wore the crown.

56
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,666
So they went to him with a proposal, Miami,
the cocaine capital of the world,

57
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:03,837
would remain Pablo's territory,
and in return, the Rodríguez brothers

58
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,423
would make do with a little territory
in the northeast called New York City.

59
00:12:07,507 --> 00:12:10,677
The extra 1,089 miles may have made it

60
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,389
a little harder to get to, but it
turns out the folks in New York

61
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:18,476
were just as head over heels
for cocaine as the folks down south.

62
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,479
And while there were
1.8 million people in Miami,

63
00:12:21,563 --> 00:12:23,815
there were seven million
in New York City.

64
00:12:24,732 --> 00:12:28,444
As much as the Cali guys loved money
and the finer things in life,

65
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:30,613
they hated the wrong kind of attention.

66
00:12:30,697 --> 00:12:32,699
For the "Gentlemen of Cali," it was

67
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:35,225
about appearing like legitimate
businessmen.

68
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:39,581
And business was good. But that didn't
mean that it couldn't get better.

69
00:14:51,296 --> 00:14:55,300
This was one thing that the Cali
guys and the DEA could agree on.

70
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:58,636
As controversial as
Colonel Carrillo's methods were,

71
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,681
he was the only guy
that Escobar was afraid of.

72
00:15:01,764 --> 00:15:03,808
And returning command
of Search Bloc to him

73
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:06,102
was exactly what we needed.

74
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:10,189
The president has offered us every
available resource to defeat Escobar.

75
00:15:10,273 --> 00:15:12,275
All we have to do now
is manage it properly.

76
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:14,777
So I'm still gonna rely
on intelligence from you.

77
00:15:14,861 --> 00:15:18,448
But we're gonna do things
a little bit differently.

78
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:20,056
No more large-scale operations.

79
00:15:20,081 --> 00:15:22,392
Search Bloc goes back
to small-scale tactics.

80
00:15:22,452 --> 00:15:24,662
- Amen.
- Stealth operations, surprise raids,

81
00:15:24,746 --> 00:15:26,873
that sort of thing. We change the game.

82
00:15:27,707 --> 00:15:30,960
But there's one thing that we
need to do first. Trujillo.

83
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:44,932
A hundred men? That's not exactly
small-scale tactics.

84
00:15:45,808 --> 00:15:48,728
First thing is, we let Pablo
know that we're back.

85
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:57,570
Now you can bet that
the second a convoy of a hundred men

86
00:15:57,653 --> 00:16:00,073
and six marked police
trucks leave that base,

87
00:16:00,156 --> 00:16:03,284
that Escobar's army of spotters
would be burning up the phone lines

88
00:16:03,368 --> 00:16:05,953
just to tell Escobar all about it.

89
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:17,298
And you'd be right.
But that was the point.

90
00:16:18,091 --> 00:16:21,010
You see, these spotters made it
impossible for us to operate

91
00:16:21,094 --> 00:16:23,221
in the secrecy we required.

92
00:16:23,304 --> 00:16:25,306
So we needed to blind them.

93
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:29,811
And the first step to blinding
someone is getting them to open their eyes.

94
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,526
Probably this rooftop here.

95
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:39,570
Once those signals went
up, we could pick them up,

96
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:42,031
get a fix and get a
location of each one.

97
00:17:06,347 --> 00:17:09,642
And I guess you could say that the
second part of Carrillo's plan

98
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:12,728
was to show Pablo that
the sheriff was back in town.

99
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:15,773
And he did that the best way he could.

100
00:18:07,992 --> 00:18:09,285
Hmm.

101
00:18:30,264 --> 00:18:31,641
Hmm.

102
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:00,795
- We got 'em.
- Keeps going like that

103
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:04,507
until you reached Barrio Pablo Escobar.
We captured six radio transmissions.

104
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,385
But we haven't pinpointed
the exact location.

105
00:19:07,468 --> 00:19:09,595
- No, sir.
- So our best bet

106
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,224
is to corner each of these buildings.
This time, we hit the ground.

107
00:19:24,735 --> 00:19:26,487
Peña, you're with me.

108
00:19:26,571 --> 00:19:29,657
Murphy, Jacoby, you stay
here to guide us.

109
00:19:31,492 --> 00:19:33,286
Careful out there.

110
00:19:59,562 --> 00:20:01,856
Oh, we got one. Spotter One is down.

111
00:21:34,782 --> 00:21:38,327
Shut up, kid.

112
00:24:40,843 --> 00:24:44,013
Tata.

113
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,294
Javi, where are the fucking spotters?

114
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:42,214
Carrillo went a different way.
He, uh... he cut them loose.

115
00:26:42,297 --> 00:26:44,091
Oh, we're letting people go now?

116
00:26:44,925 --> 00:26:46,969
Yeah, Murphy, we're letting people go.

117
00:26:48,011 --> 00:26:49,638
And what does that mean?

118
00:26:49,722 --> 00:26:52,891
- Don't worry about it, man.
- Hey, fucking talk to me.

119
00:26:52,975 --> 00:26:55,728
- Let go of my fucking arm.
- What the fuck happened?

120
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:01,900
Carrillo put a gun to the
kid's head and he pulled the trigger.

121
00:27:03,694 --> 00:27:05,487
To make a fucking point.

122
00:27:08,782 --> 00:27:10,033
We good now?

123
00:27:14,663 --> 00:27:16,206
Yeah, we're good.

124
00:28:22,689 --> 00:28:25,776
I'd like to talk to you
about what happened tonight.

125
00:28:27,194 --> 00:28:30,239
- What do you think happened?
- I know I got left behind on purpose.

126
00:28:30,322 --> 00:28:31,740
For your own best interest.

127
00:28:31,824 --> 00:28:34,701
You don't know a goddamn thing
about my best interest.

128
00:28:34,785 --> 00:28:38,122
You know, Murphy, what happens
out there isn't really for everyone.

129
00:28:38,205 --> 00:28:39,998
- But it is for Peña?
- You're not Peña.

130
00:28:40,082 --> 00:28:42,167
- 'Cause I'm a damn gringo.
- Because I trust him.

131
00:28:42,251 --> 00:28:43,877
Why don't you try me?

132
00:28:44,962 --> 00:28:47,506
This fight against Escobar,
you want to win it.

133
00:28:47,589 --> 00:28:50,968
These guys aren't fighting by the
same rules, so why should we?

134
00:28:52,845 --> 00:28:55,681
- You know what that means?
- Oh, I do.

135
00:28:56,682 --> 00:29:01,562
So whether this is about protecting me
or protecting you, stop icing me out.

136
00:32:15,047 --> 00:32:15,964
Peña.

137
00:33:33,834 --> 00:33:36,086
This is Moncada's biggest lab.

138
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:39,089
It'll have to be inventoried
before it's dismantled and moved.

139
00:33:39,172 --> 00:33:40,715
How you know that?

140
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,719
- One of my CI's.
- Hell of a tip.

141
00:33:44,803 --> 00:33:46,054
It's a hell of a CI.

142
00:33:46,138 --> 00:33:48,432
Look, you want
Escobar's men, there they are.

143
00:33:48,515 --> 00:33:50,725
- Let's do it.
- All right.

144
00:35:18,688 --> 00:35:20,506
Get up! Move! Move!

145
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,860
Get up!

146
00:35:41,336 --> 00:35:43,672
Your CI hooked us a pretty big fish.

147
00:35:43,755 --> 00:35:45,048
Yeah, he's a winner.

148
00:35:47,926 --> 00:35:50,595
Wonder if he'll give us Escobar.

149
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:54,391
- Don't know, we'll see what Carrillo gets.
- Yeah. We'll see.

150
00:35:57,936 --> 00:36:02,315
Carrillo told me that he talked to
you. He thinks he can trust you.

151
00:36:02,983 --> 00:36:04,067
Yeah, he can.

152
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,989
- That's not what I mean.
- Ahh.

153
00:36:10,407 --> 00:36:11,491
Let's go.

154
00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:14,327
I'm a big boy. I can handle it.

155
00:36:19,124 --> 00:36:20,542
Yeah.

156
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,166
- You get anything out of him?
- Something.

157
00:37:01,249 --> 00:37:03,960
Not everything. Are you coming?

158
00:37:07,297 --> 00:37:09,090
I'm in, yeah. Let's go.

159
00:37:46,961 --> 00:37:50,048
Pablo.

160
00:43:05,822 --> 00:43:06,864
Hello?

161
00:43:07,865 --> 00:43:08,783
Hello?

162
00:43:10,702 --> 00:43:13,705
- Steve?
- Hey, baby.

163
00:43:13,788 --> 00:43:15,456
What time is it?

164
00:43:16,207 --> 00:43:17,458
Uh...

165
00:43:19,252 --> 00:43:20,712
It's late.

166
00:43:21,587 --> 00:43:23,047
Are you okay?

167
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:29,721
Yeah, I'm... good. I
just need to hear your voice.

168
00:43:33,266 --> 00:43:35,309
I wanted to call, Steve. I...

169
00:43:36,978 --> 00:43:39,856
It's okay. You don't have to explain.

170
00:43:41,649 --> 00:43:42,650
What's happened?

171
00:43:44,193 --> 00:43:45,611
Tell me.

172
00:43:47,447 --> 00:43:51,743
I'm good, baby. I'm... Don't worry.

173
00:44:00,209 --> 00:44:01,294
You have to go.

174
00:44:04,505 --> 00:44:06,674
Let's talk tomorrow. Okay?

175
00:44:07,467 --> 00:44:08,718
Yeah.

176
00:44:10,053 --> 00:44:11,471
Yeah, I'd like that.

177
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:17,143
Good night.
