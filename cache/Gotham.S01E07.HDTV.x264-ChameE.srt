1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,280
There is a war coming.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,720
A-a terrible war.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,180
There-there will be chaos.

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,490
Rivers of blood in the streets.

5
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,460
I know it!

6
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,290
I-I can see it coming.

7
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,070
It's time.

8
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,670
Somebody has to take over; it might as well be me.

9
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,390
My name's James Gordon, a detective.

10
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,720
My name is Bruce Wayne.

11
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,820
I promise, I will find the man who did this.

12
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,180
Stop or I'll shoot!

13
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,230
Mario Pepper was framed by Fish Mooney and the cops.

14
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,710
Why snitch on your own boss?

15
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,370
You want to push Fish out, huh?

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,270
I told you this is important.

17
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,720
I ain't looking for no girl.

18
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,220
I'm looking for a weapon.

19
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,730
The old man has to go.

20
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,860
He figures we're working together,

21
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,070
we'd be cooked.

22
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:41,650
You're under arrest

23
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,260
for the murder of Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot.

24
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,430
Holy crap.

25
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,980
I am Oswald Cobblepot.

26
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,860
You son of a bitch.

27
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,570
He's alive?!

28
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,180
Alive?!

29
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,320
No!

30
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,210
Boss, what's wrong?

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,770
Gordon didn't kill Penguin like he was told.

32
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:18,530
What?

33
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,670
Penguin is still alive and working for Maroni?

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,590
No.

35
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,600
You go find Gordon, and you bring him to me.

36
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,570
Still breathing.

37
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,290
I want to talk to that son of a bitch.

38
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,480
Hey, guys. Leave a message.

39
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,150
Barbara, if you're at home, listen to me.

40
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,960
I need you to get out right now.

41
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,910
- I thought we were friends. - Harvey!

42
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,040
Shut up! Game's over.

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,360
Now I got to kill you and take your body back to Falcone,

44
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,850
and beg, beg him for mercy!

45
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,690
Listen to me. I screwed up.

46
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,600
But I have a plan to make things right.

47
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,170
Don't kill me. Help me.

48
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,640
You think I'm an idiot?

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,050
Walk away!

50
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,750
Walk away.

51
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,730
Help me.

52
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,440
We don't have to go out like this.

53
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,010
You better hope you never see me again.

54
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,900
What a place, huh?

55
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,220
A beautiful home for a beautiful lady.

56
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,520
Please tell me what you want.

57
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,540
I guess there's no harm in the truth.

58
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,080
See, your boyfriend was supposed to kill a certain person for somebody.

59
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,370
Only, he didn't.

60
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,220
And now that somebody is real mad.

61
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,460
Cobblepot.

62
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,450
What?

63
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,650
He didn't kill Cobblepot.

64
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,160
There you go!

65
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,200
You're hip.

66
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,370
You are hip.

67
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,870
That Jim Gordon is one lucky son of a gun.

68
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,400
What are you, like, a hundred pounds?

69
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,870
110?

70
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,860
I bet that's your real hair color, too.

71
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,120
What are you gonna... do to Jim?

72
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,910
You ever been with a criminal?

73
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,670
Some ladies find it a turn-on.

74
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,290
Jim.

75
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,480
Speak of the devil.

76
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,560
I was just getting to know your lovely lady.

77
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,210
You're trespassing. Get out.

78
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,930
Slow down, Hoss.

79
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,160
You're misreading the situation. I'm the shot caller here.

80
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,200
The situation is you've been told to bring me in alive,

81
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,600
or I'd be dead already.

82
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,540
But I'm happy to kill you right here and now.

83
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,880
Don't be such a hard-ass.

84
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,700
Come on, you know the rules.

85
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,860
You play nice, you take your lumps...

86
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,640
nobody else gets hurt.

87
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,020
Tell your friend to drop his gun or I'll blow his brains out.

88
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,320
- Oh, my God, Jim. - It's okay. It's under control.

89
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,940
Drop your gun.

90
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:05,990
Okay.

91
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,250
Have it your way.

92
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,520
But now, after we kill you, we're gonna kill blondie, too.

93
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,960
Nice and slow.

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,900
We've got to go.

95
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,090
Right now.

96
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,630
Barbara.

97
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,990
The Westbound Interstate Express departs in five minutes, Bay 12.

98
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,900
Barbara.

99
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,820
- What? - Listen.

100
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,650
No, no. No.

101
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,870
- Just a couple of days and I'll join you. - No.

102
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,770
There are things I need to do.

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,920
Fine. Then if you stay, I stay.

104
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,450
Okay? Because I love you, Jim.

105
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,840
I cannot leave you.

106
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,390
I love you, too.

107
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,080
That's why you need to leave.

108
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,590
If I know you're safe, there's nothing they can do to me.

109
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,110
I'll make things right, and then I'll come join you.

110
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,120
And what if you don't?

111
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,130
Don't come back.

112
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,680
Don't come back to Gotham.

113
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,050
No, Jim.

114
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:00,760
Gordon's here.

115
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,750
Is he nuts?

116
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,430
What's he doing here?

117
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,480
You believe this guy?

118
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,460
Hey, Alvarez.

119
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,580
You got any of those blank warrants that Judge Bam Bam signed?

120
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,960
Uh... yeah.

121
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,000
This cannot stand.

122
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,140
Gordon must die, Bullock must die,

123
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,930
Penguin must die today!

124
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,890
And Maroni, too, I suppose?

125
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,440
If need be.

126
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,480
You're overreacting, my dear.

127
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,000
This Penguin's a nobody.

128
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,550
You want to start a war over the guy that carried your umbrella?

129
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,050
He was on my hip everywhere with me.

130
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,710
He knows things.

131
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,760
Like what?

132
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,340
Too much.

133
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,510
He knows too much!

134
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,140
Go to Maroni

135
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,070
and ask him politely to hand over your little man.

136
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,260
Politely.

137
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,080
If he refuses, we can talk about stronger measures.

138
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,050
Boss, this is weak response.

139
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,920
I hate to agree with Fish, but we need to show strength now.

140
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,880
We need to hit back hard. No talk.

141
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,300
Penguin dead, Gordon dead, done.

142
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,170
Relax, Niko. I know what I'm doing.

143
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,500
Where is Gordon?

144
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,800
I thought you were bringing him with you.

145
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,050
No. He wouldn't come without a struggle.

146
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,460
Now, I don't know if he's playing tough or crazy,

147
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,240
but he's at work like nothing's wrong.

148
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,220
I'll send Victor to fetch him.

149
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,830
No need. My guys can handle him.

150
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,940
I'll send Victor.

151
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,680
That's a nice handsome bird, huh?

152
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,250
I don't know chickens.

153
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,420
Fall back.

154
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,050
The old man is right there.

155
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,610
Screw him. He's done.

156
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,130
Now's the time to strike.

157
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,040
- Not yet. - Not yet, not yet.

158
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,810
If not now, when? Look at him.

159
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,660
Maroni clan are laughing at us,

160
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,890
and he plays with chickens.

161
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,940
That's what has me worried.

162
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,350
The chickens. He's happy, relaxed,

163
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,150
as if he doesn't have a care in the world.

164
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,600
- That girl of yours is doing her job then. - No.

165
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,750
She says he hasn't even touched her.

166
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,780
She cooks and she cleans for him.

167
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,660
He likes to watch her do chores.

168
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,680
Weird.

169
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,390
- But if that's his thing... - No.

170
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,620
He's acting as if he knows something important

171
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,440
that no one else knows.

172
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,570
What the hell are you doing here?

173
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,410
I work here. It's my shift.

174
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,190
Where else should I be?

175
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,620
How about Alaska?

176
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,460
Arrest warrants?

177
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,300
For who?

178
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,720
Mayor Aubrey James, Carmine Falcone

179
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,190
and their close associates.

180
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,530
On charges of conspiracy and perversion of justice

181
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,690
in the Wayne murder case.

182
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,410
Are you insane?

183
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,250
No.

184
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,590
Maybe a little.

185
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:09,940
Feels good.

186
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,320
They're gonna try and kill me anyway.

187
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,760
Might as well make them pay a price for it.

188
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,120
You're gonna arrest the mayor and Don Falcone. How?

189
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,700
My testimony is attached to the warrants.

190
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,010
That alone is enough to indict them on a dozen counts.

191
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,510
Sure, if you could execute the warrants, which you can't.

192
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,000
If the D.A. Would prosecute, which he won't.

193
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,060
There's not a single cop or lawyer in the city who will help you.

194
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,050
I think there are plenty of people willing to help me

195
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,680
once they see it's possible to fight back.

196
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,050
You're dreaming.

197
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,950
Nobody will help you.

198
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,480
I won't help you.

199
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,990
You don't think I want change just like you do?

200
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,540
I have a family.

201
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,990
I understand.

202
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,730
Gordon...

203
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,800
get out of town.

204
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,570
This is my home.

205
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,910
It was my father's home.

206
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,040
I'm not leaving.

207
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,040
Hello, everyone.

208
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,440
My name is Victor Zsasz.

209
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,310
I'm sent here personally by Don Carmine Falcone himself

210
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:45,360
on a matter of deep concern to him, so please be respectful.

211
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,770
I'm here

212
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,510
for Jim Gordon.

213
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,010
Only him.

214
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,660
Everybody else, mind your business and we're cool.

215
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,430
So where's Jim at?

216
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,630
Thank you.

217
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,980
Hey, Jim!

218
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,110
Jim.

219
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,810
Hi, Jim.

220
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,860
Relax.

221
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm supposed to take you in alive.

222
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,120
Don Falcone wants to talk.

223
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,480
Tell Falcone we'll talk.

224
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,260
But not today.

225
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,440
Don't be that way.

226
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,920
"Alive" is a very broad category.

227
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,610
A man with no hands can still be alive.

228
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,130
There are 50 cops in here.

229
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,470
Try something.

230
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,950
Everybody out.

231
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,710
Please?!

232
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:11,940
Go, boss.

233
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,870
Get out of here.

234
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,510
- Jim... - Go.

235
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:16,820
I can handle this.

236
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,360
Well, how now, Jim?

237
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,350
Jim?

238
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,120
Jim?

239
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,260
Why are you hiding from me, Jim?

240
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,310
What the...?

241
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:48,840
There!

242
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,410
You need a ride?

243
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,930
Go, go, go, go, go!

244
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,840
No.

245
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,230
No, please.

246
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,050
Twenty-eight.

247
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,500
You're back.

248
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,650
How do you feel?

249
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,910
Terrible.

250
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,760
Where am I? Who are you?

251
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,540
I'm a friend of Montoya and Allen.

252
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,810
I just took two bullets out of you and sewed you up.

253
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,470
Now I'm checking to see how you're doing.

254
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,490
So...

255
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,120
who are you, what city are we in,

256
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,710
and what day of the week is it?

257
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,440
I'm James Gordon.

258
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,540
We're in Gotham.

259
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,630
It's Friday. Why are there rats?

260
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,790
It's the dissection lab at the university.

261
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,660
I gather you're a fugitive from the mob.

262
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,030
Can't go to the hospital, said Crispus.

263
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,810
Very exciting, I must say.

264
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,120
How long have I been out?

265
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,460
Just a couple of hours or so. You're very lucky.

266
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,390
No vital organs were... Whoa, whoa, lie back down.

267
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,180
Okay? You are hurt.

268
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,330
Just a week or so in bed...

269
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,190
No, I have to go.

270
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,800
James, you have lost a lot of blood.

271
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,960
You have to do as I say and lie back down.

272
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,220
If you don't, you could die.

273
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,050
I have to stand. Can you help me?

274
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,220
Okay, okay.

275
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,440
Crispus?

276
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,220
He said he's leaving already.

277
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,130
- I have to go. Now. - Sure.

278
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,100
Some clothes would be good though.

279
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,390
This is about tradition, values.

280
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,460
Snitches get stitches-- that's how it's always been.

281
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,450
You need to hand him over, Sal.

282
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,210
I know.

283
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,190
I should.

284
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,160
But what can I say?

285
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,410
The little guy amuses me.

286
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,440
Don Falcone is going to be very unhappy.

287
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,910
You want to start a war over this punk?

288
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:34,770
War?

289
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,940
He's that important to you, is he?

290
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,580
No. He means nothing to us.

291
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,160
Respect is what matters here.

292
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,680
Respect I understand.

293
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,320
Penguin!

294
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,410
Come on out here.

295
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,340
Don't be scared. She won't bite.

296
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,700
You won't bite him, will you?

297
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,090
Hello, Penguin.

298
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,540
Hello, Ms. Mooney.

299
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,380
Penguin, Ms. Mooney and her boss,

300
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,760
Mr. Falcone, feel disrespected by you.

301
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,210
Oh, dear.

302
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,350
Well, that certainly has never been my intention.

303
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,700
Well, respect is very important to them.

304
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,040
Now, I want a sincere apology from you

305
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,910
for making them feel that way.

306
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,790
Oh, gosh, of course.

307
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,350
If I've in any way

308
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,960
caused anyone to feel a lack of respect,

309
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,790
I apologize.

310
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,830
Sincerely.

311
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,180
There you go.

312
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,270
Can't say fairer than that.

313
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,720
Bloodshed, then.

314
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,550
I'm glad.

315
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,340
Jolly fat men are so tiresome.

316
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,190
And you...

317
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,630
you little

318
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,700
scaly-faced bitch.

319
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,370
What I'm gonna do to you.

320
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:13,870
"Torture" is far too nice of a word.

321
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,540
I'm sorry you feel that way, Fish...

322
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:29,180
Only my friends... call me Fish.

323
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,320
Hey, sisters!

324
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:02,740
How's it hanging?

326
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,950
Holy...!

327
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,360
Tell your boss Falcone won't let

328
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,530
any of Maroni's trucks over the bridge.

329
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,190
Not till he gives up Penguin.

330
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,250
So, listen, you got to get hurt a little.

331
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,070
You want a beating or a bullet?

332
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,140
Why we got to get hurt?

333
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,740
Because we're sending a message this is a serious issue.

334
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,860
We'll tell him it's serious. No problem.

335
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,100
Ah, you know what?

336
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,190
How did they find out about the gun truck, huh?!

337
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,200
That's $3 mil per week right there!

338
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,450
Son of a bitch!

339
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,540
$4.5 mil per, gross. Cash.

340
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,470
Very aggressive move, isn't it?

341
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,270
An overreaction.

342
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,390
They want to scare you.

343
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,360
Oh, is that right?

344
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,670
You think that they think that Don Maroni can be scared?

345
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,530
Of course, you're right. No.

346
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,720
But why, then, would they react so ferociously?

347
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,110
Why do they want me back so badly?

348
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,340
I know why.

349
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,670
Because they know I got a stone moneymaker here.

350
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,370
A golden goose.

351
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,560
They know it, and they don't want us to have him.

352
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,490
Right, Penguin?

353
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,390
Honk, honk.

354
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,200
What?

355
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,360
Honk, honk.

356
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,130
It's what geese say.

357
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,130
Oh, right, right.

358
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,100
Honk, honk.

359
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,770
So, fine, he's a goose.

360
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,630
Maybe we can negotiate a price,

361
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,230
- pay them off. - Yeah.

362
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,250
Yes.

363
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,940
Caution is wise.

364
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,320
The Falcone clan still is number one, after all.

365
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,440
Paying them off is the safe thing to do.

366
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,850
Screw safe.

367
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,120
They want to push me? They think I'm gonna fold?

368
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,050
I'll push right back, harder.

369
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,390
Hit them where it hurts. Today.

370
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,080
You know best.

371
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,390
If that's how you want to play it,

372
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,530
I think I know just the spot to hit them.

373
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,920
I owe you an apology.

374
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,130
You were telling the truth, and I wouldn't believe you.

375
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,880
Maybe my personal feelings towards Barbara

376
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,460
got tangled up in there.

377
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,400
And that was wrong.

378
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:26,930
Forget it.

379
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,190
Anyhow, I-I'm sorry for misjudging you,

380
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,190
and I'm very glad that we're on the same side now.

381
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,260
Yeah, me, too.

382
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,740
So Barbara's safe though?

383
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,810
You're sure she's safe?

384
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,130
I'm sure.

385
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,540
Gordon, is that you?!

386
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,280
It's all right, Alfred.

387
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,710
It's all right. He's a friend.

388
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,880
We couldn't risk a direct approach;

389
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,250
there's people looking for me.

390
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,490
Ah, right.

391
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,770
Sorry about that, mate.

392
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,970
Can't be too careful.

393
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,720
In a spot of bother, are we, sir?

394
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,080
Renee Montoya and Crispus Allen.

395
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,570
Pleased to meet you.

396
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:19,820
Bruce, I promised I would find your parents' killer.

397
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,580
I'm not sure I'm going to be able to keep that promise.

398
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:26,490
It's a long story, but I'm kind of in a tight spot.

399
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,530
I've upset some powerful people.

400
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,580
Stop treating me like a child.

401
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,300
Explain.

402
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,560
Bruce, you are a child.

403
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,360
You don't need to know...

404
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,980
You expect to die!

405
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,650
I'd like to know why.

406
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,230
Is it connected to my parents' murder?

407
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,320
Yes, it's all connected.

408
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,670
Somehow.

409
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,730
Bruce...

410
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,220
I will do my best to work this thing out.

411
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,360
But if I don't,

412
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,280
Montoya and Allen here will take over your parents' case.

413
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,770
I've told them everything I know.

414
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,730
You can trust them, one hundred percent.

415
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:05,950
One hundred percent.

416
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,670
Bruce, these are good detectives.

417
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,430
If anyone can find the truth, it's them.

418
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,380
Thank you.

419
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,340
Sir, what can we do to help you now?

420
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,270
Nothing.

421
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:33,030
From here on in, I have to go it alone.

422
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,820
I don't want anyone else caught up in this.

423
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,650
I have to go.

424
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,090
You can hardly walk.

425
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,610
I'll be fine.

426
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:01,790
Yeah.

427
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,280
All yours.

428
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,230
You are good.

430
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,980
This way.

431
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:16,970
Not much further.

432
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,430
It's there.

433
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,350
Told you.

434
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,010
Easy as pie.

435
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,390
There must be a million dollars' worth here.

436
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,340
Yeah, you told us, all right.

437
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,070
You're clever.

438
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,260
You're very clever.

439
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,490
I sense a sarcastic and hostile edge to your tone.

440
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,530
Hostile?

441
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,820
You got that right.

442
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,010
You ain't no golden goose, you're a yellow rat snitch,

443
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,950
and you got Maroni all twisted.

444
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:30,520
I'm so glad we're finally clearing the air at last.

445
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,520
That's it.

446
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,680
Act smart, okay?

447
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,640
'Cause all I got to do right now

448
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,530
is put a bullet in your brain right here.

449
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,630
Bang.

450
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,290
See, then I go back and I tell the boss

451
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,920
that one of Niko's men shot you.

452
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,440
Gee, that's too bad.

453
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,390
End of story.

454
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,340
Yes, that's clever enough.

455
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,950
I never doubted your intelligence.

456
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,360
That's not your problem.

457
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,030
Oh, I got a problem, huh? I got a problem.

458
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,540
No, you got a problem.

459
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,910
What's my problem, schmo?

460
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,420
What drives you?

461
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,430
What's your passion?

462
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,690
When you know what a man loves,

463
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,590
you know what can kill him.

464
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,780
Do you believe this guy?

465
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,740
For you, it's money.

466
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,280
You love money.

467
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,100
More than power and respect.

468
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:25,250
You're a skinflint, Mr. Carbone.

469
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,640
A cheapskate.

470
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,190
What are you guys playing at? Let me go!

471
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,880
Sorry, Frankie.

472
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,840
- As I say, a cheapskate. - Hey, come on!

473
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,610
Consequently,

474
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,840
you don't pay your people enough.

475
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,790
No, you know me. You don't want to do this.

476
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:46,580
- It is a sad fact... - You don't want to do this.

477
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:51,280
- No. No. No. No! - That there is no loyalty among thieves.

478
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,210
The simple offer of a substantial pay raise

479
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,430
is all it took to sway these fine men.

480
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,830
So, you see, that's your problem!

481
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:12,410
Your greatest passion becomes your greatest weakness!

482
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:25,630
Love, Mr. Carbone.

483
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,550
Love conquers all.

484
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,950
My friend.

485
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,220
My good friend, today is a sad day.

486
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,300
Nikolai was like a son to me,

487
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,660
just as Frankie was a son to you.

488
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,670
We've both lost precious family members.

489
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:11,990
My condolences to you.

490
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,070
And mine to you.

491
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,380
I want this violence to stop.

492
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,090
Business is good.

493
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,410
The Arkham Project is a gold mine.

494
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,570
Wayne Enterprises is back in play.

495
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,030
Life is good for all of us.

496
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:27,710
Why risk all of that and go to war over trifles?

497
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:31,910
Your little man there is obviously very valuable to you.

498
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,740
We'll let you have him.

499
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,110
Unharmed.

500
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,180
Our gift to you.

501
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,430
And as a show of mutual respect, you give us something in return.

502
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,760
Like such as what?

503
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:47,850
How about real estate?

504
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,630
One of your warehouses on the river maybe.

505
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,350
That's not gonna work.

506
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,880
I mean, I like this fella,

507
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,410
but we're talking about a warehouse on the river.

508
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:03,910
Yeah.

509
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,990
Indian Hill.

510
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,160
I'll give you Indian Hill.

511
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,140
I'm not familiar with the name.

512
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,710
It's in Arkham.

513
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:16,700
It's a toxic waste dump on top of an Indian burial ground.

514
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,240
It's worthless.

515
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,990
No.

516
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,620
Nothing is worthless.

517
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,560
Even nothing is worth something.

518
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,620
We'll take it.

519
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,620
As a token of our mutual respect, yes?

520
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,010
You got it, my friend.

521
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,920
It's all love.

522
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,420
It's a pleasure seeing you all.

523
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,350
Um, I heard Vic Zsasz tore up the GCPD,

524
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,920
tracking down Gordon.

525
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,360
Did you catch him yet?

526
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,810
We're working on it.

527
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,250
Well, good luck with that.

528
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,070
There's nothing more dangerous than an honest man, huh?

529
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,490
Jimbo, it's me. Open up.

530
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,900
Don't worry, I'm not gonna kill you.

531
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,670
I should, but I ain't.

532
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,870
Glad to hear it.

533
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:30,450
Obviously, you figured you'd go to the last place they'd look,

534
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:33,430
because it'd be the first place they'd reject as being too obvious.

535
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,670
I-I'm sorry, I'm being rude.

536
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,470
This is the Duchess of Devonshire.

537
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:40,210
Duchess, Jim Gordon, putz.

538
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,620
Marsha. Hi.

539
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,260
Right.

540
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,380
Baby, why don't you explore a little bit.

541
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,280
Find the bedroom, put on your birthday suit.

542
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,160
And I'll find you in a jiffy, okay?

543
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,440
So I've been thinking.

544
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,690
You're still a douche bag.

545
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,650
But you have the moral high ground.

546
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,960
So I'm gonna back your play, whatever it is.

547
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,190
I figure I'm doomed anyhow.

548
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,870
I might as well join the good guys.

549
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:03,770
Thank you.

550
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,260
So what is your play?

551
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,350
I mean, you got one, right? You said you did.

552
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,220
Tomorrow morning, I'm arresting Falcone and the mayor

553
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,850
for the framing of Mario Pepper.

554
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,130
Conspiracy, POJ, Rico, the works.

555
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,410
Well, that's a... that's a hell of a plan.

556
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,250
You sit down with a panel of chimpanzees

557
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,290
and a bucket of crack and come up with that one?

558
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,800
I figure whatever else happens, we'll stir things up.

559
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,050
We might even make the papers.

560
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,670
Oh, yeah, we're gonna make the papers, all right.

561
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,250
We're gonna be dead in the streets

562
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,900
in time for the evening edition.

563
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,140
Well, at least the people will know the truth.

564
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,780
And we'll go out doing our jobs, enforcing the law.

565
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
That's the best inspirational speech you got?

566
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,040
Doing our jobs?

567
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,710
You don't have to join me.

568
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,860
No, I'm game.

569
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,810
Like I said, I'm doomed anyhow.

570
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,660
Now, if you'll excuse me for one minute,

571
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,410
just gonna take care of some business.

572
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,610
Duchess!

573
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,250
Marco!

574
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,290
Polo!

575
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,720
Jumping catfish.

576
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,590
Good morning, Mayor James.

577
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,070
Gordon, you scared...

578
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,690
scared the bejeebers out of me.

579
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,060
Almost spilled my coffee.

580
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:19,920
Sorry.

581
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,690
Sir, you're under arrest.

582
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:22,770
That's not funny.

583
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,260
Depends where you're sitting.

584
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,520
Might want to take a look at this.

585
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,090
How you doing, guys?

586
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,390
I'm here to have a chat with Mr. Falcone.

587
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,150
Sure thing, Mr. Mayor.

588
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,390
Carmine Falcone, you're under arrest.

589
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:13,810
Move.

590
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,110
Lie down right over there. Stay quiet.

591
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,370
What on earth are you thinking?

592
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,030
We're thinking we'll take you both to jail

593
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,130
and charge you with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

594
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,170
Try and take me in, you won't make it to the end of the street.

595
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,320
That's exactly what I said.

596
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,010
This is a lawful arrest. If you resist, you will be shot.

597
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:33,960
I see.

598
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:37,440
We all die together in a blaze of glory.

599
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,250
If that's how it works out, that's fine with me.

600
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,290
How about you, Harvey?

601
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,410
Fine by me.

602
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:43,720
- Oh, God. - I envy you boys.

603
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,470
Having nothing to lose must be liberating.

604
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,970
Must feel pretty good.

605
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:49,020
Yes, it does.

606
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,520
Suppose you did have something to lose.

607
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,560
What would you do then?

608
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,270
Suppose, for instance,

609
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:56,690
I had a knife to Barbara Kean's throat right now.

610
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:58,550
Would you still be so brave?

611
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,560
You don't.

612
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,120
I'm telling you I do.

613
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,260
You're a liar.

614
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:05,100
I have many faults, but I'm not a liar.

615
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,430
Victor Zsasz has Barbara.

616
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,810
You know Victor.

617
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,590
You're lying. She's far away.

618
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,720
She came back.

619
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,700
Came right to me to plead for your life.

620
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,510
You have a good woman there.

621
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,430
She loves you very much.

622
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,760
Too much.

623
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,460
Prove it.

624
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,120
Prove you have her.

625
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,940
I could.

626
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,730
But I won't.

627
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,430
I want you to believe me.

628
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,850
It's obvious, Jim. He's lying.

629
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:39,160
Am I?

630
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,370
If you think so,

631
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,460
go ahead and try to bring me in.

632
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:45,800
You'll be dead,

633
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,990
so you won't know what happens to Barbara.

634
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,230
But it won't be pretty.

635
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,440
Lying.

636
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,920
On my mother's grave.

637
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,280
Drop your gun,

638
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,620
and Barbara won't be harmed in any way.

639
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,310
Those muffins smell good.

640
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,910
None for you, creep.

641
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,390
She can have one if she wants.

642
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,080
No, thank you.

643
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,170
Got it.

644
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,670
What a shame.

645
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:44,550
Oh, this is embarrassing; he straight-up bluffed you into folding.

646
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:47,060
We could've gone out like heroes; now we're fish food.

647
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,370
Okay, so it wasn't a bluff.

648
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,900
I'm sorry if she was mistreated a little.

649
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:58,710
We needed to be sure she had nothing useful to tell us.

650
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,390
Untie her, Victor.

651
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,550
I'm sorry.

652
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,620
It's okay. It's okay.

653
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,690
What am I gonna do with you?

654
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,170
By rights, you have to die.

655
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,310
Whoa, hello. Uh, I'm late for work.

656
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,570
Quite an adventure. I'll be on my way.

657
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,410
Such a waste though.

658
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,910
Gotham needs men like you, both of you.

659
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,060
Strong men with principles.

660
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,590
I wish I could make you see I'm not the enemy.

661
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,710
The system is not the enemy.

662
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,660
The enemy is anarchy.

663
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:34,060
But I told you that before, didn't I, Jim?

664
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,200
Yes, you did.

665
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,150
You didn't listen though.

666
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,350
Do we get a last meal or a smoke or anything, 

667
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,700
or just talk?

668
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,040
But today, you believed me.

669
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,880
You trusted my word.

670
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,450
That's a good first step.

671
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,820
Perhaps there's still hope for you.

672
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,580
Yes.

673
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,020
Go. Get out of here before I change my mind.

674
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,740
- Wait a minute. - Quiet.

675
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,520
It's been a pleasure, Barbara.

676
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,260
I do admire a brave woman.

677
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,980
What's the catch?

678
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,280
Jim, he said we could go. Let's not haggle here.

679
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,200
What's the catch, Mr. Falcone?

680
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,740
I want you to think about what I said.

681
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,740
I want you to understand the truth.

682
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,800
That's all I ask.

683
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,300
The catch is...

684
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,690
someday soon, you'll see I'm right.

685
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,500
Barbara...

686
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,590
I'm sorry.

687
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:57,120
I was just trying to help, and...

688
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,380
I don't know what...

689
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,500
I love you so much.

690
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:26,940
Excellent.

691
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,180
Delicious!

692
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,140
Yes.

693
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,590
I followed the recipe.

694
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,650
You're right, Mr. F., cooking is easy.

695
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,640
I'm sorry you had to see all that earlier.

696
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,840
Not pleasant.

697
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,620
I understand.

698
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,660
Business is business.

699
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,180
Yes, it is.

700
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,870
I'll go see to the chickens.

701
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,820
Any eggs, my dears?

702
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,390
Don Falcone.

703
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,190
My friend.

704
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,350
Good to see you.

705
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,080
I was just thinking about the night we met.

706
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,640
Cut them down.

707
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,580
Where's the snitch?

708
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,060
I want to speak to him.

709
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,320
Cobblepot, is it?

710
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,460
Condemned men are honest men, I find.

711
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,820
What can you tell me before you go?

712
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,470
Don Falcone.

713
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,690
It is a great honor, sir.

714
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,530
Indeed, I can tell a secret of great value to you...

715
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:07,060
if you grant me one last request.

716
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,110
Which is what?

717
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,240
Give the job of killing me to James Gordon.

718
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,740
Why him?

719
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:19,250
He's the only man under your sway who has a conscience.

720
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:22,430
The only one who might be persuaded to spare my life.

721
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,660
Why would I agree to that?

722
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,790
I want you dead. You're a snitch.

723
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,250
If you agree and Gordon spares me,

724
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,950
then I will become your snitch.

725
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,610
For life.

726
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,130
I will come back to Gotham under a different name,

727
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,280
and I will work my way into the Maroni family,

728
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,920
and I will snitch for you.

729
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,610
I am excellent at this sort of work.

730
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,970
I have a gift for it. I really do, sir.

731
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,170
Deal.

732
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,940
Gordon will get the job of killing you.

733
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,840
Thank you, sir.

734
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,150
What is the valuable secret?

735
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,670
Oh, yes.

736
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,930
Fish Mooney and Nikolai the Russian only pretend to hate each other.

737
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,330
They're lovers.

738
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,240
And Fish is pushing Nikolai to take your place.

739
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,220
Is that so?

740
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,190
Yes, sir.

741
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,300
But only so Fish can take over from him.

742
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,140
That is a good secret.

743
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,940
It's almost uncanny.

744
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,680
Everything played out exactly as you said it would.

745
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,080
We got rid of Nikolai painlessly,

746
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,180
and Maroni thinks you're a wizard.

747
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,300
You really do have a gift.

748
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:01,170
But I think we're making a mistake letting Gordon live.

749
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,080
He's trouble.

750
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,810
Thank you so much for sparing him.

751
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,320
I appreciate the favor.

752
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,990
Don't worry.

753
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,000
He'll see the light.

754
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,280
One way or another. I guarantee it.
