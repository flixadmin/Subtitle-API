WOW. AS SOON AS WALKER
GETS HIS HANDS ON JOHN,

165
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,817

GENERAL WALKER
UNDER INVESTIGATION

169
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,075

QUITE THE CASE...

WITH THE NUCLEAR TRIGGER.

172
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,498

TO EXONERATE JOHN.

IN HIGH PLACES.

176
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,339
MANAGED TO GET
THE INVESTIGATION
SLOW-ROLLED.

BUT THE FILE
STILL EXISTS.

HEARD OF BEFORE
CALLED "SLY-DEE"?

468
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,837
IT'S PRONOUNCED "SLIDE,"
LIKE IN PLAYGROUND

469
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,588
BECAUSE IT HOOKS KIDS YOUNG
AND MAKES THEM MOVE

470
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,965

I'M ABOUT TO
SAY THIS,

AGREE WITH RENE.

476

THE AFTER-ACTION
REPORT ON HER
PARTNER'S DEATH.

478
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,022
SONUS' MEN CAPTURED
HER AND TORTURED HER
FOR TWO WEEKS,

479
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,898
SO EVEN IF SHE
DIDN'T DROP OUT

PARANOID MUCH?

619
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,046
YOU DON'T KNOW
THE DARK WEB LIKE I DO, OK?

620
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:14,133
THESE GUYS AREN'T EXACTLY
KNOWN TO BE FRIENDLY.

621
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,135
-OMG!
-O...MG!

622
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,971
THE GHOST FOX GODDESS
HERE IN MEATSPACE,

623
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,348
THE REAL
GHOST FOX GODDESS.

624
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,477
YOU'RE
KOJO SLEDGEHAMMER.

625
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:27,229
YEAH. I KNOW.
IT'S NOT NEARLY AS COOL
AS GHOST FOX GODDESS,

626
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:29,856
BUT THEN I CAN ONLY ASPIRE
TO YOUR LEVEL OF COOL,

627
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,941
WHICH I DO.

628
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,692
UH, ASPIRE TO, I MEAN.

629
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,945
TAKE HER DOWN HARD
YOU SAID, RIGHT?

630
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,448
[BEEP]

631
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,782
HEY.

632
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,118
IT IS SO GREAT
TO MEET YOU.

633
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,370
WHEN I SAW YOUR TRAFFIC
ON THE DARK NETS,

634
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,038
I WASN'T EVEN SURE
IT WAS YOU.

635
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,708
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN
A BLANK FOR, WELL, YEARS.

636
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,876
I'VE BEEN BUSY.

637
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,211
-I KNOW. PALMER TECH.
-MM-HMM.

638
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:54,131
I JUST FIGURED
ONCE YOU GOT FIRED YOU'D...

639
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,799
FIGURED I'D WHAT?

640
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,302
IT'S NONE
OF MY BUSINESS.

641
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:01,472
OK. WELL, UM...HEH.

642
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:04,933
I BECAME A HACKER,
A HACKTIVIST,

643
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:09,271
BECAUSE OF YOU,
THE GFG.

644
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:10,981
I READ ABOUT YOUR HACK
OF THE DEPARTMENT
OF EDUCATION,

645
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:14,318
AND I WAS LIKE,
"I KNOW WHAT
I WANT TO BE,"

646
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,029
BUT THEN YOU JUST
TOTALLY STOPPED

647
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:21,867
AND BECAME THIS, LIKE,
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
SUPPORT PLAYER, AND...

648
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:25,245
SORRY. NEVER MEET
YOUR HEROES, YOU KNOW?

649
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,830
NO. I HAVEN'T JUST BEEN
CORPORATE, YOU KNOW?

650
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:31,001
I'VE BEEN DOING WORK
THAT IS...IMPORTANT.

651
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:34,171
OOH. IF IT WAS,
I WOULD HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT.

652
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:37,341
OOH. SORRY.
THERE I GO AGAIN. HEH.

653
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:41,261
I GUESS I WAS JUST
EXCITED WHEN I SAW YOU
ON THE DARK NETS.

654
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:45,182
IT WAS LIKE...LIKE YOU
WERE RETURNING, YOU KNOW?

655
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:48,352
THE OG GFG WAS BACK.

656
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,020
WELL, I WAS LOOKING
FOR AN NSA FILE

657
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,397
TO EXONERATE
AN INNOCENT MAN.

658
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,315
-JOHN DIGGLE.
-YES.

659
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:55,275
MY ORGANIZATION DOES
ITS HOMEWORK.

660
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:56,694
ORGANIZATION?

661
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,154
A HACKTIVIST GROUP.
WE CALL OURSELVES HELIX.

662
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:01,114
A MONTH AGO,
WE HACKED ECHELON.

663
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,200
THE NSA'S INFORMATION
GATHERING PROGRAM?

664
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,869
MM-HMM. WE HOOVERED UP
8 PETABYTES OF DATA

665
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:10,165
INCLUDING EVERYTHING
YOU NEED TO HELP
YOUR FRIEND.

666
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:12,125
WE'RE CALLING
THE DATA CACHE PANDORA.

667
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,628
WITH IT, YOU CAN
TAKE DOWN POLITICIANS,

668
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,424
BANKRUPT COMPANIES,
SPARK REVOLUTIONS.

669
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,301
SO YOU'RE NOT JUST
GIVING ME THE FILE
FOR JOHN.

670
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:25,972
YOU INSPIRED ME TO MAKE
THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE,

671
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,851
AND NOW I INTEND
TO INSPIRE YOU

672
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:33,522
TO BE THE HACKTIVIST
YOU USED TO BE,

673
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,982
THE GREAT
GHOST FOX GODDESS.

674
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,337
LET ME GUESS.

675
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,964
YOU'RE TRUSTING ME
WITH YOUR MASK OFF,

676
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,799
SO NOW I'M SUPPOSED
TO TRUST YOU.

677
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,926
NO. I JUST THOUGHT
THAT IF YOU WEREN'T
GONNA LISTEN

678
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:06,430
TO THE GREEN ARROW
THAT YOU MIGHT LISTEN
TO OLIVER QUEEN.

679
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:09,099
NICE TO MEET YOU.

680
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,727
I SPENT 5 YEARS IN HELL,

681
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,437
NOT UNLIKE WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU WHEN YOU WERE
UNDERCOVER

682
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:16,440
IN SONUS' ORGANIZATION

683
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:17,941
OR WHAT HE PUT YOU
THROUGH WHEN HE
DISCOVERED

684
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,110
YOU WERE A COP.

685
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:23,238
AND WHAT? YOU THINK
YOU SEE A LITTLE BIT
OF YOURSELF IN ME?

686
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,741
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

687
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:28,327
THERE IS A MAN
IN STAR CITY

688
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,078
WHO'S TRYING TO
CONVINCE ME

689
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,038
THAT I DESTROY THE LIVES
OF EVERYONE THAT I TOUCH

690
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,166
BECAUSE I AM
BEYOND REDEMPTION.

691
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,793
YEAH, YEAH. YOU THINK
IF YOU CAN SAVE ME
YOU'LL PROVE HIM WRONG.

692
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,795
DON'T PUT YOUR ISSUES
ON ME.

693
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,046
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT,

694
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,633
BUT IF YOU THINK THAT
YOU CAN TAKE ON SONUS
AND HIS MEN,

695
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:43,842
THEN YOU ARE WRONG.

696
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:47,721
LET US HELP.

697
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:50,849
LET US HELP,
AND THEN...

698
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,351
WE'RE GONE.

699
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,325
CURTIS: ALL RIGHT! I'M READING
15 SHOOTERS ON THE ROOF

700
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,369
AND A HELICOPTER INBOUND.

701
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,374
COPY.
WE'RE IN POSITION.

702
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,752
SHIPMENT'S LATE.

703
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,546
SOME SCREW-UP
IN BLUDHAVEN.

704
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,922
TAKE 100 GRAND OFF.

705
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,049
WE NEED TO MOVE.

706
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,551
BE PATIENT.

707
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,761
YOU STILL HAVE
CURTIS' INSURANCE
POLICY WITH YOU?

708
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:31,807
YEAH. I'M STILL GONNA GET
TO USE MY GUNS, RIGHT?

709
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:33,141
[SIGHS]

710
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,101
CURTIS: CHOPPER'S ABOUT
TO LAND, GUYS.

711
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,186
MOVE.

712
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:45,278
SONUS: KILL THEM ALL!

713
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,881
NOT SO FAST, DIRT BAG.

714
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,298
YES!

715
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,759
[QUIET] YES.

716
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,182
-THEY GOT AIR SUPPORT.
-ALL RIGHT.

717
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:15,893
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT,
BUT, WILD DOG...

718
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,185
I GOT HER SIX.

719
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:08,069
GUESS I SHOULD BE
FLATTERED.

720
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:11,573
TO THINK YOU'VE HELD
OUT A CANDLE FOR ME
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

721
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,869
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

722
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:18,622
OLIVER: TINA!

723
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,791
DON'T DO IT.

724
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:23,042
YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS.

725
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,211
YOU KNOW I'M NOT.

726
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,088
IF WE'RE AS ALIKE
AS YOU SAID,

727
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,590
WE BOTH KNOW
YOU'D KILL HIM.

728
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:31,384
YOU'RE RIGHT.

729
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,303
MAYBE IT'S TOO LATE
FOR ME...

730
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,015
AND MAYBE I DON'T GET
A SECOND CHANCE...

731
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:42,020
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
GO DOWN THAT ROAD.

732
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:47,609
TINA, WHAT WOULD VINCE
WANT YOU TO DO?

733
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,746
HE'D WANT ME
TO DO THAT.

734
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,379
HEY!

735
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,009
LET HER GO.

736
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,228
HEY!

737
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,271
OH, MAN.

738
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,148
I WAS GONNA
ASK HOW IT WENT
WITH THE NEW CANARY,

739
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,903
BUT I CAN TELL
BY THAT...LOOK
ON YOUR FACE.

740
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:32,111
HMM.

741
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,989
WELL, I HAVE SOME
GOOD NEWS, THOUGH.

742
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,240
I AM IN THE MARKET.

743
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,703
I'VE GOT ALL WE NEED
TO EXONERATE JOHN.

744
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:42,205
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

745
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,167
LONG STORY.

746
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,337
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME?

747
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:52,465
I KNOW THAT WE ARE
NOT USED TO GETTING
GOOD NEWS,

748
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:56,261
BUT THIS IS WHAT
IT LOOKS LIKE.

749
00:34:56,302 --> 00:35:00,432
I AM GONNA GO LEAK
THE FILE ON WALKER.

750
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,934
WHY DON'T YOU GO TELL
JOHN THE GOOD NEWS?

751
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,217
WHAT'S GOING ON?

752
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,511
YOU TELL HIM.

753
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,721
TELL ME WHAT?

754
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,514
EARLIER THIS EVENING,
I RECEIVED

755
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,016
THE NSA'S CASE
AGAINST WALKER

756
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,267
FROM AN ANONYMOUS SOURCE.

757
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,019
-ANONYMOUS?
-ON THE STRENGTH OF IT,

758
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,813
I WENT THE JUDGE ADVOCATE
EX PARTE

759
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,857
AND GOT YOU RELEASED
ON BAIL.

760
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,776
-WAIT. WHAT?
-I FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS,

761
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,277
WHICH IS AS CLOSE
TO A SLAM DUNK

762
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,279
AS THESE THINGS GET GIVEN
THE CARDS WE'RE HOLDING.

763
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,948
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

764
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,241
IT MEANS THAT YOU
CAN GO HOME

765
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,785
AND HUG YOUR WIFE
AND SON.

766
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:15,423
YOU WANTED THIS,

767
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:18,217
BAITED ME
WITH YURIEVICH.

768
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,427
YES.

769
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:23,306
TO SEE FOR YOURSELF
WHAT I'VE BECOME?

770
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,266
TO REMIND YOU.

771
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,394
WHY GO TO ALL
THE TROUBLE, HUH?

772
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,897
WHAT DO YOU CARE?
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.

773
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,607
I THOUGHT I'D
PROVEN OTHERWISE.

774
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:37,320
GENERAL SHREVE,
BARON REITER,

775
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,405
KONSTANTIN KOVAR.

776
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,199
YOU KEEP LOOKING
FOR NEW FIGHTS

777
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,577
WHEN THE REAL FIGHT
HAS BEEN IN FRONT
OF YOU ALL ALONG.

778
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,955
YOUR FATHER LITERALLY
WROTE IT FOR YOU,

779
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:49,791
A LIST OF ALL
THE YURIEVICHES

780
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,001
AND KOVARS
IN STARLING CITY.

781
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:53,252
HE TOLD ME
HE LEFT ME A MESSAGE.

782
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,838
AND YET YOU STILL DON'T
RETURN HOME.

783
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,215
WHY DO YOU DENY
YOUR FATHER'S WISH
FOR YOU?

784
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,967
YOU SAW
THE REASON TONIGHT.

785
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:01,553
I AM NOT THE MAN
THAT MY FATHER RAISED!

786
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,806
NOT ANYMORE.

787
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,684
YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT'S
HAPPENED TO YOU,

788
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:08,935
OF WHAT YOU'VE BECOME,

789
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,063
AND YOU'RE RUNNING
FROM IT.

790
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:17,861
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ALL THIS?

791
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:21,364
BECAUSE I'VE
BEEN THERE...

792
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:25,077
AND I CAN HELP YOU
FIND YOUR WAY BACK.

793
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,370
YOU THINK YOURSELF
A MONSTER.

794
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,165
NO.

795
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,169
I AM A MONSTER.

796
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,678
THERE IS A MONSTER
INSIDE YOU, YES,

797
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,556
BUT IT IS NOT YOU.

798
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:47,849
I DON'T SEE
THE DIFFERENCE.

799
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:50,810
NO. YOU NEED TO
CREATE ONE.

800
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:58,110
YOU NEED TO GIVE
THE MONSTER AN IDENTITY.

801
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:01,571
IT'S ONLY WHEN
THE MONSTER BECOMES
SOMEONE ELSE,

802
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:06,785
SOME...THING...ELSE
THAT YOU'RE FREE TO BE
OLIVER QUEEN.

803
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,094
I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M READY.

804
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:26,387
I WILL HELP YOU
BECOME READY.

805
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,235
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

806
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:41,611
MAN: MR. MAYOR.
EXCUSE ME,

807
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,404
BUT THERE'S SOMEONE
HERE TO SEE YOU.

808
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,157
HER NAME IS TINA BOLAND.

809
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:47,492
OH. YEAH.
SEND HER IN, PLEASE.

810
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:58,795
MAYOR QUEEN.
IT'S IMPRESSIVE.

811
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:01,547
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
HAVE LED WITH THAT.

812
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,134
I GOT TO ADMIT...

813
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:06,928
I DIDN'T THINK I'D
SEE YOU AGAIN.

814
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,221
YEAH. NEITHER DID I.

815
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:16,938
I GUESS I THOUGHT
I WOULD FEEL DIFFERENT

816
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,274
WITH SONUS GONE.

817
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:23,278
I THOUGHT I WOULD FEEL
LIBERATED.

818
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,572
I WISH IT WORKED
THAT WAY.

819
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:27,699
HEH.

820
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,665
HOW DO YOU DO IT?

821
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,500
HOW DO YOU KEEP
LIVING

822
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,835
WITH SO MUCH PAIN?

823
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:42,672
I'M STILL WORKING
ON THAT MYSELF,

824
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:47,219
BUT I CAN TELL YOU IT
HELPS TO NOT BE ALONE.

825
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,054
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
HERE, RIGHT?

826
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,142
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

827
00:39:57,145 --> 00:40:00,481
BACK ON THE ROOF,
YOU ASKED WHAT VINCE
WOULD HAVE WANTED.

828
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:04,610
WE WERE MORE
THAN JUST PARTNERS.

829
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,824
WE WERE LOVERS.

830
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:12,493
I HATED SONUS
FOR KILLING VINCE...

831
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:19,667
BUT I HATED MYSELF MORE
FOR NOT BEING ABLE
TO STOP HIM.

832
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:23,796
RENE, THE...THE GUY
IN THE HOCKEY MASK,

833
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,674
TOLD THE OTHER GUY
THAT WAS WITH US...CURTIS...

834
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:32,889
THAT THIS TEAM IS
ALL ABOUT FINDING
SECOND CHANCES.

835
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,183
YOU SAID MAYBE WE DON'T
GET SECOND CHANCES.

836
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:36,517
WELL, MAYBE
I WAS WRONG.

837
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,064
MAYBE YOU'RE
MY SECOND CHANCE.

838
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,651
THAT'S A LOT
TO PUT ON MY SHOULDERS.

839
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,821
WELL, TINA, THERE'S
SOMETHING THAT TELLS ME
YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

840
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,911
SO ABOUT THAT NAME.

841
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:58,998
TINA BOLAND WAS
MY OFFICIAL COVER
FOR UNDERCOVER WORK.

842
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,918
IT WAS TO PROTECT
MY FAMILY.

843
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,214
MY REAL NAME IS
DINAH, DINAH DRAKE.

844
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:12,011
DINAH?

845
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:13,846
DOES THAT NAME MEAN
SOMETHING TO YOU?

846
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,642
I HAD A FRIEND
NAMED DINAH.

847
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,560
SHE'S THE REASON
I SOUGHT YOU OUT.

848
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,065
WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE'D
THINK ABOUT ALL THIS?

849
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,653
I THINK SHE'D BE PROUD
OF BOTH OF US.

850
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:02,812
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
