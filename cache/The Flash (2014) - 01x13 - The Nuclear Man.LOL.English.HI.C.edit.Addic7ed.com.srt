of the so-called "Burning Man"

170
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:40,667
in the area following the attacks.

171
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:42,336
Burning man?

172
00:06:42,338 --> 00:06:46,769
Caitlin, weren't you asking
about him a few weeks ago?

173
00:06:51,175 --> 00:06:53,806
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

174
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:54,807
Thanks for meeting me.

175
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:55,875
Sure.

176
00:06:55,877 --> 00:06:57,645
What exactly are we doing here?

177
00:06:57,647 --> 00:06:59,647
That's Barry's old house.

178
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,247
Where his mother was murdered?

179
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:03,047
I have a theory about
who might have been involved

180
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:04,648
in Barry's mother's death.

181
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,718
I thought you and I could
reexamine the crime scene,

182
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,421
you could apply your technical expertise

183
00:07:08,423 --> 00:07:09,854
and help me prove who really did it.

184
00:07:09,856 --> 00:07:11,421
For sure, we should get Dr. Wells

185
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:12,654
and Caitlin in on this.

186
00:07:12,656 --> 00:07:14,021
No, we should keep this between us

187
00:07:14,023 --> 00:07:15,390
for the time being.

188
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:16,626
If too many people know,
Barry will find out,

189
00:07:16,628 --> 00:07:17,928
and I don't want to involve him

190
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,795
until we know something definitive.

191
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:28,067
Hello, ma'am.

192
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:30,403
I'm Detective West.

193
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:32,240
This is Cisco Ramon.

194
00:07:32,242 --> 00:07:34,611
Oh, please, it's Sherry, like the drink.

195
00:07:34,613 --> 00:07:37,046
[chuckles]

196
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:38,715
What can I do for you, Detective?

197
00:07:38,717 --> 00:07:40,085
I don't know if you were aware,

198
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:42,086
but there was a homicide in this residence

199
00:07:42,088 --> 00:07:43,521
approximately 15 years ago.

200
00:07:43,523 --> 00:07:44,825
Oh, I know.

201
00:07:44,827 --> 00:07:46,995
We've reopened the investigation.

202
00:07:46,997 --> 00:07:48,062
Do you mind if we come in

203
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:49,596
and take another look around?

204
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,931
Oh, not at all.

205
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:54,965
Thank you.

206
00:07:58,636 --> 00:07:59,703
Do you live alone?

207
00:07:59,705 --> 00:08:03,073
Yes, I'm divorced.

208
00:08:07,211 --> 00:08:10,178
Well, it appears letting Ronnie roam free

209
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,646
is no longer an option.

210
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:13,583
He's not even Ronnie anymore.

211
00:08:13,585 --> 00:08:17,087
He's Martin Stein walking
around in Ronnie's body,

212
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:18,489
like a vampire.

213
00:08:18,491 --> 00:08:20,292
Is there a reason that Stein's brain

214
00:08:20,294 --> 00:08:22,095
is in control of Ronnie's body,

215
00:08:22,097 --> 00:08:23,163
not the other way around?

216
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:24,664
Simple Darwinism, I suspect.

217
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,665
A brand-new organism will select

218
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:29,136
the strongest parts of itself
in order to survive.

219
00:08:29,138 --> 00:08:30,771
Survival of the fittest.

220
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:33,174
In this case, Ronnie's body, Stein's mind.

221
00:08:33,176 --> 00:08:35,678
In any event,
he badly hurt an innocent man,

222
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,615
and we have hunted meta-humans for less.

223
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:41,117
Caitlin, we need to know
that you're on board

224
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:45,657
with what needs to be done here.

225
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:48,158
How do we find him?

226
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,428
Quentin Quale, the scientist
that Ronnie attacked,

227
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,863
is a former colleague of Martin Stein.

228
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:56,999
If Martin is indeed in control
of Ronnie's body,

229
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:59,870
he may be trying to figure out
exactly what's happening to him.

230
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,371
What do we know about him?

231
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:04,239
I don't even know what Stein looks like.

232
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:06,640
Martin Stein.

233
00:09:06,642 --> 00:09:07,673
That's Stein?

234
00:09:07,675 --> 00:09:08,940
It is.

235
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:10,375
I've seen him before.

236
00:09:10,377 --> 00:09:12,711
When?

237
00:09:12,713 --> 00:09:16,048
On the train, the day
the accelerator exploded.

238
00:09:25,025 --> 00:09:26,791
Super cool, isn't it?

239
00:09:26,793 --> 00:09:30,361
Uh, S.T.A.R. Labs, I mean.

240
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:33,965
Yes, it's... Super cool.

241
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:35,499
[sighs] Trust Harrison Wells

242
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:38,998
to build a particle accelerator
with a bit of style.

243
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,304
Most scientists don't have an appreciation

244
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:44,172
for the value of aesthetics.

245
00:09:44,174 --> 00:09:46,274
Albert Einstein said, "Once you can accept

246
00:09:46,276 --> 00:09:48,412
"the universe as being something expanding

247
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:50,949
into an infinite nothing
which is actually somethingâ...

248
00:09:50,951 --> 00:09:55,386
"Wearing stripes with plaid becomes easy."

249
00:09:55,388 --> 00:09:57,222
I thought people your age

250
00:09:57,224 --> 00:09:59,023
didn't read actual books anymore.

251
00:09:59,025 --> 00:10:00,058
Oh, I'm the only one.

252
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,858
Oh. Mm.

253
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,997
Physics. Hobby or endeavor?

254
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:07,231
Both, actually.

255
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:08,699
I'm a CSI.

256
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:10,534
I work for the Central City
Police Department.

257
00:10:10,536 --> 00:10:14,172
Really? You look too young for that.

258
00:10:14,174 --> 00:10:16,974
That is what they tell me.

259
00:10:16,976 --> 00:10:20,812
Are you gonna watch
the accelerator turn on tonight?

260
00:10:20,814 --> 00:10:22,580
I wouldn't miss it.

261
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:25,448
They say it's going to change the world.

262
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,916
I hope so.

263
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,918
(train conductor)
Carson Station. Carson Station.

264
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,055
Oh, this is my stop.

265
00:10:31,057 --> 00:10:32,723
- It was nice talking to you.
- You too.

266
00:10:32,725 --> 00:10:35,558
Maybe I will see you there tonight.

267
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,661
Excuse me.

268
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:38,331
I'm taking a girlfriend.

269
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,633
Not my girlfriend, she's just, uh...

270
00:10:40,635 --> 00:10:42,869
Sorry... She's just a female friend

271
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:44,105
who I'm not dating yet.

272
00:10:44,107 --> 00:10:45,373
The doors are about to close.

273
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,309
(Barry) Yeah.

274
00:10:53,815 --> 00:10:56,482
(protestors) Don't turn it on!

275
00:10:56,484 --> 00:11:00,254
Don't turn it on! Don't turn it on!

276
00:11:00,256 --> 00:11:02,792
Don't turn it on! Don't turn it on!

277
00:11:02,794 --> 00:11:04,662
[explosion]

278
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,171
Caitlin, whatever happens...

279
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,020
(Clarissa) Of course I've
heard of S.T.A.R. Labs.

280
00:11:27,022 --> 00:11:30,122
Martin was always vocal
about the competition.

281
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:33,620
S.T.A.R. Labs is actually helping the CCPD

282
00:11:33,622 --> 00:11:36,859
looking into your husband's
disappearance, Mrs. Stein.

283
00:11:36,861 --> 00:11:38,995
Oh, please. Call me Clarissa.

284
00:11:38,997 --> 00:11:42,600
The Conway Prize
for Scientific Advancement.

285
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:45,334
(Clarissa) Martin was
very proud of that one.

286
00:11:45,336 --> 00:11:47,571
I'd always hoped to win
one of these myself.

287
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:51,043
Oh, and look at that.
He won it three times.

288
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:52,710
Takes a special kind of person

289
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,744
to make Dr. Wells jealous.

290
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:58,682
Well, Martin had a talent
for making people jealous.

291
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,415
Even me.

292
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:04,150
I sometimes think Martin loved
his theorems and experiments

293
00:12:04,152 --> 00:12:06,020
more than he did me.

294
00:12:06,022 --> 00:12:09,691
I'm sure that's not true.

295
00:12:09,693 --> 00:12:12,024
And you haven't heard from your husband

296
00:12:12,026 --> 00:12:14,024
since he disappeared.

297
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:16,027
No.

298
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:19,834
Mrs. Stein, could I show you a photograph?

299
00:12:19,836 --> 00:12:22,971
Have you seen this person before?

300
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:26,274
Yes, I have.

301
00:12:26,276 --> 00:12:29,476
- Who is he?
- Um...

302
00:12:29,478 --> 00:12:31,077
He's just a person of interest

303
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:33,645
in your husband's case.

304
00:12:33,647 --> 00:12:36,117
When did you see him?

305
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:39,757
I started getting the feeling
that someone was watching me,

306
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,925
and sometimes I still do.

307
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,865
And about a month after Martin disappeared,

308
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:50,038
that young man showed up here.

309
00:13:01,757 --> 00:13:04,090
What happened to me?

310
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:07,161
A month...

311
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:08,662
A month.

312
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:15,302
Clarissa.

313
00:13:17,905 --> 00:13:20,740
Clarissa.

314
00:13:20,742 --> 00:13:23,141
Who are you?

315
00:13:23,143 --> 00:13:25,540
How did you get in here?

316
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:29,812
Under the loose stone.
You leave a key for me there.

317
00:13:29,814 --> 00:13:31,648
I'm always losing mine.

318
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,149
Losing my keys. Losing my mind.

319
00:13:35,151 --> 00:13:36,250
I'm going call the police.

320
00:13:36,252 --> 00:13:39,154
Losing my mind.

321
00:13:39,156 --> 00:13:41,791
Where is my body?

322
00:13:41,793 --> 00:13:44,327
I see my life, but I can't reach it.

323
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:45,563
Please send someone.

324
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:48,503
There's an intruder in my house!

325
00:13:48,505 --> 00:13:49,870
[grunts]

326
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:53,810
(Wells) So it appears Martin
Stein and Ronnie Raymond

327
00:13:53,812 --> 00:13:56,582
have something in common
besides sharing a body.

328
00:13:56,584 --> 00:13:59,620
They both feel the need
to protect the women they love.

329
00:13:59,622 --> 00:14:03,222
Clarissa said she feels
like she's being watched.

330
00:14:03,224 --> 00:14:04,856
Well, then,

331
00:14:04,858 --> 00:14:07,324
this has all the makings of a stakeout.

332
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:08,828
But Barry's got a date tonight.

333
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,163

we can get you back in a hurry.

337

Not even with The Super Light.

338
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:24,316
Super Light?

339
00:14:24,318 --> 00:14:25,884
Well, technically it's a multi-spectrum,

340
00:14:25,886 --> 00:14:27,653
violet laser-enhanced scanner that detects

341
00:14:27,655 --> 00:14:29,825
molecular schisms
in the 600 mega-volt range,

342
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,794
but I figured "Super Light"
was easier to say.

343
00:14:31,796 --> 00:14:33,627
Right, but what does it tell you?

344

already know about that night.

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,534
Okay, keep looking.

346
00:14:37,536 --> 00:14:38,971

347
00:14:38,973 --> 00:14:41,905
Uh, can I get you boys something to drink?

348
00:14:41,907 --> 00:14:43,372

Uh, we're fine. Thank you.

351
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,948
Well, if you change your mind,
I've been told

352
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,020
my strawberry daiquiris are sinful.

353
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,858
I will not judge you.

354
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,198

356

357

361

It was often used to back vintage mirrors.

366
00:15:37,497 --> 00:15:40,298
If there were two speedsters
there that night,

367
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,234
the sparks from their movement
would have generated

368
00:15:42,236 --> 00:15:45,236
enough flashes to actually expose images

369
00:15:45,238 --> 00:15:46,570
onto the silver nitrate.

00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:02,631
and I kind of wanted to impress the guy.

376
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:04,565
I think I can speak for that guy

377
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:08,938
and say that he is super impressed.

378
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,675
So is this your place? It's awesome.

379
00:16:11,677 --> 00:16:14,748
Yeah. Well, not entirely. I grew up here.

380
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,348
Is it really lame that I live at home?

381
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,949
Not at all. I still live with my parents.

382
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:21,018
Really?

383
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,389
No. That would be so lame.

385
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:26,225
All right, so here's the plan.

386
00:16:26,227 --> 00:16:28,761
First, a dinner reservation at Paper Clip.

387
00:16:28,763 --> 00:16:31,498
Then a round of mini-golf,
followed by Mal Duncan,

388
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,265
who is playing at an underground jazz club.

389
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:34,864
But my foster dad has a connection there,

390
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:36,132
so he hooked us up.

391
00:16:36,134 --> 00:16:37,166
And if you're not sick of me by then,

392
00:16:37,168 --> 00:16:39,002
we can get froyo.

393
00:16:39,004 --> 00:16:41,371
Or...

394
00:16:45,142 --> 00:16:47,643

Why would he come back here?

397
00:16:52,785 --> 00:16:56,186
Because this is his home.

I don't mean the actual house.

399
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:01,657
I mean Clarissa. She's his home.

400
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:04,659
We all want to go home again.

and did this to Martin Stein.

410

501
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:55,082
Wait, we're not talking
about hockey anymore, are we?

502
00:22:55,084 --> 00:22:56,720
No. We're not.

503
00:22:56,722 --> 00:22:59,957
Look, I am so, so sorry
that I left you like that.

504
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:02,925
I'm... I'm not that kind of guy.

505
00:23:02,927 --> 00:23:06,631
Well, let me tell you
what kind of girl I am.

506
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:08,864
I work in a hard business,
and I work hard in it.

507
00:23:08,866 --> 00:23:11,067
And so I'm very picky about who I choose

508
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:13,103
to spend my free time with.

509
00:23:13,105 --> 00:23:15,504
I chose to spend some of it with you, so...

510
00:23:15,506 --> 00:23:19,142
tell me, Barry Allen,
did I make the right choice?

511
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:20,376
Yeah, you did.

512
00:23:20,378 --> 00:23:23,043
It just that something important came up.

513
00:23:23,045 --> 00:23:24,811
And not more important than you,

514
00:23:24,813 --> 00:23:27,484
it's just sort of, like,
an equal level of importance

515
00:23:27,486 --> 00:23:29,285
- type situation...
- [phone vibrating]

516
00:23:29,287 --> 00:23:33,655
And... And usually I can do both,

517
00:23:33,657 --> 00:23:36,828
um, but it's just that I have to, um...

518
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,463
[phone vibrates]

519
00:23:38,465 --> 00:23:42,035
I have to go to work. I'm so sorry.

520
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:43,771
It's a police emergency.

521
00:23:43,773 --> 00:23:45,907
Can we talk later tonight?

522
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:48,443
I'm not going anywhere...Yet.

523
00:23:48,445 --> 00:23:50,511
Okay, thanks.

524
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:51,644
- Hey!
- Hey!

525
00:23:51,646 --> 00:23:53,079
Sorry, gotta go. Uh...

526
00:23:53,081 --> 00:23:54,914
Hey! What's up?

527
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:56,882
Bye. [laughs]

528
00:23:56,884 --> 00:23:58,651
Hey, can I ask you a question?

529
00:23:58,653 --> 00:24:00,053
Yeah, sure.

530
00:24:00,055 --> 00:24:03,193
So, um, you and Barry are like BFFs, right?

531
00:24:03,195 --> 00:24:05,294
The best of BFFs.

532
00:24:05,296 --> 00:24:07,731
Has he ever actually dated anyone before?

533
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:10,734
Because he's simultaneously
surprisingly good at it

534
00:24:10,736 --> 00:24:12,401
and really, really bad at it.

535
00:24:12,403 --> 00:24:13,369
I don't know.

536
00:24:13,371 --> 00:24:15,973
He's... Barry.

537
00:24:15,975 --> 00:24:18,343
What was his last girlfriend like?

538
00:24:18,345 --> 00:24:21,779
You know, he hasn't really
had a girlfriend in a while.

539
00:24:21,781 --> 00:24:24,414
I don't know,
maybe he's just not ready yet.

540
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:25,916
What do you mean?

541
00:24:25,918 --> 00:24:28,788
You know, I mean, he was into someone,

542
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,829
an unrequited love thing.

543
00:24:31,831 --> 00:24:33,331
You know, he had feelings for someone,

544
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:37,470
and they weren't really reciprocated, so...

545
00:24:37,472 --> 00:24:40,805
Yeah, maybe just give him time.

546
00:24:40,807 --> 00:24:42,507
Sure.

547
00:24:45,413 --> 00:24:47,015
(Caitlin) There he is.

548
00:24:47,017 --> 00:24:52,252
Looks like the tracker
Barry placed on him worked.

549
00:24:52,254 --> 00:24:53,488
Professor Stein?

550
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,589
Ugh, I told you to stay away from me.

551
00:24:55,591 --> 00:24:58,460
And I will, but there's someone else

552
00:24:58,462 --> 00:25:00,995
who wants to talk to you.

553
00:25:00,997 --> 00:25:02,530
(Clarissa) Martin?

554
00:25:06,868 --> 00:25:10,270
Do you know who I am?

555
00:25:10,272 --> 00:25:12,207
Clarissa.

556
00:25:12,209 --> 00:25:13,676
Is it really you?

557
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,242
I don't know.

558
00:25:15,244 --> 00:25:17,812
I hear the other inside of me.

559
00:25:17,814 --> 00:25:21,550
He wants to go home to her.

560
00:25:21,552 --> 00:25:25,387
But we can't. I want to be me again.

561
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:29,958
Martin... what's my favorite color?

562
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:36,931
You could... you could never decide,

563
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:38,266
so you chose stripes.

564
00:25:38,268 --> 00:25:39,837
[gasps]

565
00:25:41,441 --> 00:25:47,346
You shouldn't see me like this.

566
00:25:47,348 --> 00:25:49,818
I see you.

567
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,219
I see you, Martin.

568
00:25:53,221 --> 00:25:55,554
These people can help you.

569
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:59,158
They say they can. Please let them.

570
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:05,761
Please... Help us.

571
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,774
Well, we got him. Them.

572
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:18,808
Now what?

573
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,410
Well, Stein clearly thinks

574
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,343
he can separate himself from Ronnie's body

575
00:26:22,345 --> 00:26:23,712
using nuclear fission.

576
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:25,014
What do you think?

577
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:27,115
What do I think?

578
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:30,588
Is it possible? Theoretically.

579
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,923
But splitting an atom and splitting a man

580
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:34,158
are two very different things.

581
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,895
I don't suppose it's necessary
to point out you're all staring?

582
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:45,837
Our apologies.

583
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,339
It is remarkable.

584
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:50,538
I feel clearer than I have
since the accident.

585
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,872
What did you give me?

586
00:26:51,874 --> 00:26:54,543
A cocktail of anti-psychotics, depressants,

587
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:56,312
and mood stabilizers.

588
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:59,814
The same formula used to treat
dissociative identity disorders.

589
00:26:59,816 --> 00:27:03,184
I assume this was your idea?

590
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:05,354
Very clever, Cait.

591
00:27:05,356 --> 00:27:06,923
Don't call me that.

592
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,224
Please.

593
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,361
I apologize.

594
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:12,799
We'd like to run some tests on you,

595
00:27:12,801 --> 00:27:14,202
if you don't mind.

596
00:27:14,204 --> 00:27:19,138
Of course, Dr. Snow. [phone vibrates]

597
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,340
Hey, I'm so sorry I had
to run out like that again.

598
00:27:21,342 --> 00:27:24,341
Uh, police business.

599
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:26,310
That's funny, because
I just called the station,

600
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,882
and they said that you had
taken some personal time.

601
00:27:28,884 --> 00:27:31,984
I'm not mad, Barry, I swear.

602
00:27:31,986 --> 00:27:33,919
But I do think that we should call it.

603
00:27:33,921 --> 00:27:35,421
W... Wait, can we talk about this?

604
00:27:35,423 --> 00:27:36,555
What do you mean?

605
00:27:36,557 --> 00:27:37,723
Look, I know how hard and weird it is

606
00:27:37,725 --> 00:27:39,157
trying to date someone new

607
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:41,293
when you're still not over someone.

608
00:27:41,295 --> 00:27:42,896
What are you talking about?

609
00:27:42,898 --> 00:27:44,632
You and Iris.

610
00:27:44,634 --> 00:27:47,534
Me and Iris, we're not...

611
00:27:47,536 --> 00:27:49,902
Who told you that I was hung up on Iris?

612
00:27:52,709 --> 00:27:54,811
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

613
00:27:54,813 --> 00:28:00,319
Uh, why would you tell Linda
that I had feelings for you?

614
00:28:00,321 --> 00:28:01,988
I did not say that.

615
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,256
Wait, did I?

616
00:28:03,258 --> 00:28:04,390
Okay, Iris, this isn't funny.

617
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:06,295
I mean, I like this girl.

618
00:28:06,297 --> 00:28:08,531
I know, and I am happy for you.

619
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:10,966
Really? Because I don't... I mean, right now

620
00:28:10,968 --> 00:28:13,539
it sort of feels like
you don't want to be with me

621
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:15,776
and you don't want anyone else
to be with me either.

622
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:18,112
I have wanted nothing more
than for you to meet someone

623
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:19,080
who is amazing.

624
00:28:19,082 --> 00:28:20,115
And I did!

625
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:21,517
And you went out of your way

626
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:24,451
to convince her that I was unavailable.

627
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,551
Look, I'm really sorry.

628
00:28:26,553 --> 00:28:28,787
[sighs] Great.

629
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:29,922
Wait, do you want me to talk to her?

630
00:28:29,924 --> 00:28:32,291
No, no, no. Absolutely not.

631
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,658
Don't talk to her.
I'll figure this out on my own.

632
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:38,063
I just need you to know that

633
00:28:38,065 --> 00:28:41,033
I don't have those feelings
for you anymore.

634
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:46,040
Yeah, I know.

635
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:49,011
Okay.

636
00:28:49,013 --> 00:28:51,848
I'll see you later.

637
00:28:58,757 --> 00:29:01,057
Yes, yes, yes!

638
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:03,864
See? We got two different blood samples.

639
00:29:03,866 --> 00:29:05,836
- One for each speedster.
- That's right.

640
00:29:05,838 --> 00:29:07,204
One is A-positive,

641
00:29:07,206 --> 00:29:09,304
and the other one's
AB-negative... super rare.

642
00:29:09,306 --> 00:29:11,374
I'm gonna run them both through
the CCPD criminal database

643
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:12,810
to see if I get any matches.

644
00:29:12,812 --> 00:29:15,416
Can you run them against a specific person?

645
00:29:15,418 --> 00:29:17,351
Yeah, sure, if we
have something to match it to.

646
00:29:17,353 --> 00:29:19,321
Who are we looking at?

647
00:29:19,323 --> 00:29:21,520
Dr. Harrison Wells.

648
00:29:27,362 --> 00:29:30,863
I thought we were trying
to solve Barry's mom's murder.

649
00:29:30,865 --> 00:29:32,397
We are.

650
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,267
And I'm asking you to keep this between us.

651
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:40,539
You think Dr. Wells killed Barry's mom?

652
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:43,006
No way. He didn't even know Barry then.

653
00:29:43,008 --> 00:29:45,742
Why would he kill his mom?

654
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:48,178
I don't know yet.

655
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,981
But I do know that Wells keeps secrets.

656
00:29:51,983 --> 00:29:53,918
And this may be one of them.

657
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,888
Dr. Wells is a great man.

658
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,922
I was nothing when he gave me a job,

659
00:29:58,924 --> 00:30:01,425
a chance to change my life.

660
00:30:01,427 --> 00:30:04,362
He has helped so many people.
He's not a murderer.

661
00:30:04,364 --> 00:30:08,133
Cisco, I'm a cop.

662
00:30:08,135 --> 00:30:09,668
I'm good at reading people,

663
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:14,007
so I know I can trust you
with my suspicion.

664
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:16,144
When I go talk to the family and friends

665
00:30:16,146 --> 00:30:17,479
of a murder suspect,

666
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:20,313
somebody I know is guilty,

667
00:30:20,315 --> 00:30:23,083
and I tell them the person
they love is a killer,

668
00:30:23,085 --> 00:30:26,253
guess what they all say.

669
00:30:26,255 --> 00:30:28,987
That's not the person I know.

670
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:35,526
I think I'm done being a cop for today.

671
00:30:42,136 --> 00:30:44,569
Are you comfortable?

672
00:30:44,571 --> 00:30:46,438
A little warm.

673
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,643
Ronnie used to always run warm.

674
00:30:50,645 --> 00:30:54,511
Not that warm.

675
00:30:54,513 --> 00:30:57,582
Can I talk to him?

676
00:30:57,584 --> 00:30:59,115
I'm sorry, my dear.

677
00:30:59,117 --> 00:31:01,616
I'm not sure it works like that.

678
00:31:01,618 --> 00:31:04,421
I can feel him though.

679
00:31:04,423 --> 00:31:06,391
I have these memories.

680
00:31:06,393 --> 00:31:09,691
Memories that I know aren't my own.

681
00:31:09,693 --> 00:31:12,191
One is particularly strong.

682
00:31:12,193 --> 00:31:13,459
Piedmont State Park?

683
00:31:13,461 --> 00:31:16,563
It's famous for the Hudson Falls.

684
00:31:16,565 --> 00:31:18,065
I know that I've never been,

685
00:31:18,067 --> 00:31:21,971
but I can remember
those waterfalls perfectly.

686
00:31:24,474 --> 00:31:27,240
That's where Ronnie proposed to me.

687
00:31:27,242 --> 00:31:30,311
He loves you very much.

688
00:31:30,313 --> 00:31:34,184
That I can feel.

689
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:37,285
(Wells over radio) Dr. Snow,
can we see you for a minute?

690
00:31:37,287 --> 00:31:40,489
(Caitlin) Excuse me.

691
00:31:42,894 --> 00:31:44,094
You okay?

692
00:31:44,096 --> 00:31:46,865
Yeah, it's just confusing.

693
00:31:46,867 --> 00:31:50,103
What isn't confusing is
what's happening to him now.

694
00:31:50,105 --> 00:31:51,904
Ronnie's body is rejecting Stein's atoms

695
00:31:51,906 --> 00:31:54,804
like a host rejecting a parasite.

696
00:31:54,806 --> 00:31:58,607
The resulting instability is
causing an exothermic reaction.

697
00:31:58,609 --> 00:32:01,343
I worry if his temperature
continues to rise,

698
00:32:01,345 --> 00:32:04,076
it'll set off a chain reaction.

699
00:32:04,078 --> 00:32:06,747
And then what happens?

700
00:32:08,584 --> 00:32:10,519
He could go nuclear.

701
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:22,711
Ronnie.

702
00:32:22,713 --> 00:32:24,247
Not Ronnie.

703
00:32:24,249 --> 00:32:25,648
Martin Stein.

704
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,250
Cisco Ramon.

705
00:32:27,252 --> 00:32:28,718
Your colleagues are in the next room,

706
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,955
not so subtly discussing my condition.

707
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:37,765
That's not freaky at all.

708
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:39,568
It seems Ronnie's fight with The Flash

709
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:42,338
has exacerbated the Firestorm Matrix.

710
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,173
It's unstable.

711
00:32:44,175 --> 00:32:46,575
Exponentially increasing
the rate of fission

712
00:32:46,577 --> 00:32:48,043
inside his body.

713
00:32:48,045 --> 00:32:50,513
Well, how long does he have?

714
00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:54,415
If his temperature keeps
rising at the current pace,

715
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:55,984
no more than a couple of hours.

716
00:32:55,986 --> 00:32:57,686
But you can fix it, right?

717
00:32:57,688 --> 00:32:59,654
I mean, you... you can separate
them before it's too late.

718
00:32:59,656 --> 00:33:03,191
Any attempt we make
to separate the two of them

719
00:33:03,193 --> 00:33:07,063
could be catastrophic...
a nuclear explosion.

720
00:33:07,065 --> 00:33:09,065
And a nuclear explosion of this magnitude

721
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:11,536
would level this entire city.

722
00:33:11,538 --> 00:33:13,774
Unless...

723
00:33:13,776 --> 00:33:15,677
Unless what?

724
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,986
Unless the host body
were no longer functional.

725
00:33:19,988 --> 00:33:21,187
You want to kill Ronnie?

726
00:33:21,189 --> 00:33:24,290
No, I don't want to kill Ronnie.

727
00:33:24,292 --> 00:33:27,228
But in this scenario,
Ronnie is the host body.

728
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,129
If you kill Ronnie, you kill Stein.

729
00:33:29,131 --> 00:33:30,431
That's two people.

730
00:33:30,433 --> 00:33:33,235
I don't know how else to stop it.

731
00:33:33,237 --> 00:33:36,874
And my guess is that
if Ronnie and Professor Stein

732
00:33:36,876 --> 00:33:39,143
knew the consequences
that we were all facing,

733
00:33:39,145 --> 00:33:40,944
they would make the same decision.

734
00:33:40,946 --> 00:33:44,448
It's two lives for millions.

735
00:33:47,922 --> 00:33:51,123
Can you give us a minute?

736
00:33:56,727 --> 00:33:57,860
Caitlin...

737
00:33:57,862 --> 00:33:59,694
I've already lost Ronnie once.

738
00:33:59,696 --> 00:34:03,030
I'm not going to do it again.

739
00:34:03,032 --> 00:34:05,899
You said we have a couple of hours.

740
00:34:05,901 --> 00:34:07,599
Use them.

741
00:34:14,172 --> 00:34:15,671
Dr. Wells, you don't really think

742
00:34:15,673 --> 00:34:17,837
we should kill Ronnie, do you?

743
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,841
Stay here, Cisco.

744
00:34:28,887 --> 00:34:33,093
(Barry) Hey. Sorry.

745
00:34:33,095 --> 00:34:35,733
Um, can I get you anything or...

746
00:34:35,735 --> 00:34:39,003
A glass of Château Haut-Brion
Pessac-Leognan 1982

747
00:34:39,005 --> 00:34:41,808
might be nice.

748
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,611
Or maybe it wouldn't.

749
00:34:43,613 --> 00:34:45,482
This body's taste buds would obviously

750
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:48,017
be different from my own.

751
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:51,017
Perhaps I'm now a light beer man.

752
00:34:51,019 --> 00:34:53,117
There are worse things to be.

753
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,484
You mean like a living nuclear bomb?

754
00:34:57,486 --> 00:34:58,851
You know.

755
00:34:58,853 --> 00:35:01,020
Unstable nuclear fission
was always a danger

756
00:35:01,022 --> 00:35:03,789
in the transmutation process.

757
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:08,491
Plus, you all argue very loudly.

758
00:35:08,493 --> 00:35:10,193
I'm sorry.

759
00:35:10,195 --> 00:35:11,462
But my friends are gonna figure out

760
00:35:11,464 --> 00:35:13,396
how to fix this, I promise.

761
00:35:13,398 --> 00:35:16,796
I remember meeting you,
Mr. Allen, on the train.

762
00:35:16,798 --> 00:35:19,399
You were headed
to S.T.A.R. Labs with a girl

763
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:21,565
but not your girlfriend.

764
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:24,936
Yeah.

765
00:35:24,938 --> 00:35:29,838
I'm not sure that I have any girlfriend.

766
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,444
You know, Einstein was not only brilliant,

767
00:35:33,446 --> 00:35:36,245
he had a great sense of humor.

768
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:38,246
How did it go?

769
00:35:38,248 --> 00:35:41,517
"Any man who drives safely
while kissing a pretty girl

770
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:46,556
is not giving the pretty girl
the attention she deserves."

771
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,132
If I learned anything this past year,

772
00:35:51,134 --> 00:35:53,769
life's too short not to live.

773
00:36:01,478 --> 00:36:03,647
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

774
00:36:03,649 --> 00:36:05,984
- I gave you an out.
- I don't want an out.

775
00:36:05,986 --> 00:36:07,887
I don't wanna date someone
who's into someone else.

776
00:36:07,889 --> 00:36:08,889
I'm not into anyone else.

777
00:36:08,891 --> 00:36:10,658
I'm gonna prove it to you.

778
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,395
This is the Naga Jolokia

779
00:36:12,397 --> 00:36:13,696
or the ghost pepper.

780
00:36:13,698 --> 00:36:15,229
It is the world's hottest pepper

781
00:36:15,231 --> 00:36:19,066
measuring 401.5 times hotter
than Tabasco sauce.

782
00:36:19,068 --> 00:36:21,366
If you do not agree
to go on another date with me,

783
00:36:21,368 --> 00:36:24,734
I will eat it right here, right now.

784
00:36:27,205 --> 00:36:29,037
You're bluffing.

785
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:30,370
I never bluff.

786
00:36:30,372 --> 00:36:33,575
[crunching]

787
00:36:35,546 --> 00:36:36,842
Are you okay?

788
00:36:36,844 --> 00:36:38,843
- I'm fine, yeah.
- You sure?

789
00:36:38,845 --> 00:36:40,812
Mm-hmm. Mm!

790
00:36:40,814 --> 00:36:43,181
Yes! Yes, I'll go out with you.

791
00:36:43,183 --> 00:36:45,552
That pepper could have killed you, nerd.

792
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:50,956
Oh, thank you.

793
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,224
Okay.

794
00:36:52,226 --> 00:36:55,028
I won't let my job... [coughs]

795
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,732
Or how bad my mouth is burning right now

796
00:36:57,734 --> 00:37:00,033
come between us.

797
00:37:00,035 --> 00:37:03,503
My spice champion of Central City.

798
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:22,317
(Gideon) A crude weapon, if
I may say so, Dr. Wells.

799
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:25,651
I couldn't agree more, Gideon.

800
00:37:25,653 --> 00:37:27,823
But it will do the job.

801
00:37:34,968 --> 00:37:40,374
Gideon, can the Tachyon Prototype

802
00:37:40,376 --> 00:37:42,276
be converted into a Quantum Splicer?

803
00:37:42,278 --> 00:37:45,078
(Gideon) Theoretically, but
I must warn you, Dr. Wells,

804
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,917
converting the Tachyon Prototype
will delay your timetable.

805
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:50,252
There's not going to be a timetable

806
00:37:50,254 --> 00:37:53,422
if Central City goes up
in a mushroom cloud.

807
00:37:53,424 --> 00:37:56,523
(Barry) Hey. Anything?

808
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:57,625
I have an idea.

809
00:37:57,627 --> 00:37:59,528
It's a bit of a Hail Mary,

810
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,430
but Cisco and I are going to give it a try.

811
00:38:01,432 --> 00:38:02,796
Thank you.

812
00:38:02,798 --> 00:38:04,799
I'll get Professor Stein.

813
00:38:04,801 --> 00:38:06,367
Looking for the professor?

814
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:09,470
Yeah, he's gone.

815
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,667
You guys almost done?

816
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,934
Hang on. Hang on.

817
00:38:17,936 --> 00:38:19,771
I found Stein. He's in the Badlands.

818
00:38:19,773 --> 00:38:22,574
Middle of nowhere, 30 miles
outside of Central City.

819
00:38:22,576 --> 00:38:26,311
- Minimum safe distance.
- He's sacrificing himself.

820
00:38:26,313 --> 00:38:28,880
How much time does he have left?

821
00:38:28,882 --> 00:38:31,451
12 minutes.

822
00:38:31,453 --> 00:38:33,587
And...

823
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:35,053
We're done.

824
00:38:35,055 --> 00:38:36,555
What is it?

825
00:38:36,557 --> 00:38:40,191
This is a Quantum Splicer.

826
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,225
Will it work to separate them?

827
00:38:41,227 --> 00:38:43,158
We'll know in 12 minutes.

828
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,462
Now, Barry, even you
can't outrun a nuclear blast,

829
00:38:45,464 --> 00:38:47,531
so you get this device to Professor Stein,

830
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:50,499
and you get out of there
as fast as you can.

831
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:52,099
- What are you doing?
- I'm going with you.

832
00:38:52,101 --> 00:38:54,567
- No, you're not.
- It's too dangerous!

833
00:38:54,569 --> 00:38:56,568
Barry doesn't know
how to operate the splicer.

834
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,033
Cisco's gonna talk me through it.

835
00:38:58,035 --> 00:38:59,300
There's not enough time.

836
00:38:59,302 --> 00:39:00,400
Let's go.

837
00:39:00,402 --> 00:39:02,733
Go!

838
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,902
[beeping]

839
00:39:08,904 --> 00:39:11,336
What was that?

840
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,802
Uh, comm system's on the fritz.

841
00:39:15,804 --> 00:39:17,469
I'll be right back.

842
00:39:17,471 --> 00:39:19,870
[phone rings]

843
00:39:19,872 --> 00:39:21,304
Cisco.

844
00:39:21,306 --> 00:39:23,005
I'm not proud of it, but I ran the samples.

845
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:25,376
One wasn't identified,
and the other had a match.

846
00:39:25,378 --> 00:39:27,343
Cisco, you're hesitating. Was it Wells?

847
00:39:27,345 --> 00:39:28,779
No, it's not Dr. Wells.

848
00:39:28,781 --> 00:39:31,148
I told you, he has nothing to do with this.

849
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,518
But I know whose blood it is.

850
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,852
It's Barry's.

851
00:39:34,854 --> 00:39:36,819
We already know Barry was there that night.

852
00:39:36,821 --> 00:39:39,121
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

853
00:39:39,123 --> 00:39:41,156
The sample had high levels of P16.

854
00:39:41,158 --> 00:39:43,858
That's a protein that builds up
in the blood as we get older.

855
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,695
And these levels were
way too high for an 11-year-old.

856
00:39:47,697 --> 00:39:51,464
This sample was from Barry as an adult.

857
00:40:01,173 --> 00:40:04,238
[breathing heavily]

858
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:09,709
Professor Stein!

859
00:40:09,711 --> 00:40:11,877
What are you doing here? Yo can't be here!

860
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:13,778
Get her out of here now!

861
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,249
Please, look, Ronnie's still
in there somewhere.

862
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:20,522
All those people... Clarissa...
I won't let them die!

863
00:40:20,524 --> 00:40:22,625
It's better I end this now.

864
00:40:22,627 --> 00:40:24,624
We can separate you!

865
00:40:24,626 --> 00:40:27,792
We can stop the explosion.

866
00:40:27,794 --> 00:40:28,827
How?

867
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:30,395
A Quantum Splicer.

868
00:40:30,397 --> 00:40:33,399
It's a fission device
designed to bombard your atoms

869
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:35,135
with as much energy as they experienced

870
00:40:35,137 --> 00:40:37,403
in the particle accelerator explosion.

871
00:40:37,405 --> 00:40:39,572
It should be enough to separate you.

872
00:40:39,574 --> 00:40:43,142
Please, Professor,
you have nothing left to lose.

873
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:53,453
Ronnie, if you're in there, I love you.

874
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:06,565
That was from him.

875
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:11,135
I look forward to meeting you
in person, Professor.

876
00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:23,119
It's not working!

877
00:41:23,121 --> 00:41:24,856
He's not gonna make it. He's gonna blow.

878
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:25,958
Get out of there.

879
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,694
Barry, get out of there now!

880
00:41:28,696 --> 00:41:30,461
- No! No!
- Caitlin, we have to go.

881
00:41:30,463 --> 00:41:32,628
Run!

882
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:35,296
[screams]

883
00:41:35,298 --> 00:41:37,330
No!

884
00:41:54,518 --> 00:41:56,219
Sir, we have a thermonuclear detonation

885
00:41:56,416 --> 00:41:58,516
approximately 30 miles
north east of Central City.

886
00:41:59,515 --> 00:42:01,315
Deploy the RAP response team, Sergeant.

887
00:42:02,615 --> 00:42:04,415
Bring me Firestorm.
