Like family. I know.

182
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:34,300
And I know you two have a long history
that predates me. But, Iris, we live together.

You're my girlfriend.

every time you and Barry are together.

-I shouldn't have to.
-Eddie...

-...Barry's always gonna be a part of my life.
-I get that.

But something's changed between you two.

00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:58,158
Whatever that is, I am not okay with it.

190

Mm. I haven't had one of those
in way too long.

00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,461
It felt appropriate.

192
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:15,091
So you want to talk
about what's been going on with you?

193
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,720

-Sure.

-About what?

-Uh, you know, just relationship stuff.
-Oh, you mean like with that girl Linda?

No, actually. Um, with Iris.

One perfectly good explanation
is that Wells did something to the trap.
