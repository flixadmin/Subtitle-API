It's a lot of water.

You okay, boss?

Yeah, I'm fine
, I just...

12
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,290
I just can't...
Can't stomach the water.

13
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,379
You're my new partner.

14
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,881
That's right.

15
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,884
Not the best way to meet,
with my head halfway
down the toilet.

16
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,921
Doesn't exactly square
with "Teddy Daniels,
the man, the legend,"

17
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:18,922
I'll give you that.

Seattle. I came from
the office in Seattle.

22
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,601
How long you been
with the Marshals?

23
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:33,102
Four years.

24
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:37,106
So you know
how small it is.

25
00:02:37,607 --> 00:02:39,275
Sure.

26
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:42,278
What about you?
You got a girl? Married?

27
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:44,581
I was.

Don't worry about it.

33
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:06,636
There was a fire
at the apartment building
while I was at work.

34
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:08,638
Four people died.

35
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:10,139
It was the smoke
that got her,
not the fire.

36

See, that's important.

I'm sorry, boss.

Oh, here,
have one of mine.

I could've sworn
they were in my jacket
before I got on.

Government employees
will rob you blind.

Thanks.

They give you a briefing
about the institution
before you left?

00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,632
All I know is it's
a mental hospital.

45
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,134
For the criminally insane.

Well, if it's just
folks running around
hearing voices

00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:45,475
and chasing
after butterflies,
they wouldn't need us.

Is that where
we're headed?

Yep.

Welcome to Shutter Island.

I'll be the one taking you
up to Ashecliffe.

a little on edge,
Mr. McPherson.

Right now, Marshal,
we all are.

I've seen somethin
g like it before.

All right.

68

You gentlemen will be
accorded all the help
we can give,

69
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,731
.
but during your stay,
you will obey protocol

70
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,400
Is that understood?

71
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,185
Absolutely.

72
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:45,855
The red brick building
on your right is Ward A,
the male ward.

73
00:06:45,855 --> 00:06:49,192
Ward B, the female ward,
is the one on your left.

74

Ward C is that building
on the bluffs.

75
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:54,030
An old Civil War fort.

76
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,332
The most dangerous patient
s are housed there.

77
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,334
Admittance to
Ward C is forbidden

without the written consent 
and physical presence

You act like
insanity is catching.

to surrender your firearms

Mr. McPherson,
we are duly appointed
federal marshals.

84
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,809
We are required to
carry our firearms
with us at all times.

85
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,478
Executive order 319
of the Federal Code
of Penitentiaries

86
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,897
states that when
inside a penitentiary,

87
00:07:27,897 --> 00:07:31,400
the officers of
that institution
have final authority.

Gentlemen, you will not
get through this gate
with your firearms.

00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,930
Okay. Now that
the official stuff's done,
come on, boys,

90
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,815
what do you say
we go find Dr. Cawley?

91
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,530
When did she escape?
This prisoner?

92
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,532
I'm afraid Dr. Cawley
will have to fill you in

93
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:22,034
on the situation.
Protocol.

Correctional officers
at a mental institution,

95
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,422
that's a weird sight,
if you don't
mind me saying.

It's the only facility
of its kind in the U.S.,

00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,376
even the world.

98
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,378
We take only
the most dangerous,
damaged patients,

99
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,380
ones no other
hospital can manage.

100
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,599
And it's all
due to Dr. Cawley.

101
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,518
He's created something
really unique here.

102
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,520
It's a hospital for
people our society

103
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,221
normally considers
beyond treatment.

Why?

111
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,899
What do you mean?

112
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,735
What do intelligence agencies

113
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,604
want to consult
a psychiatrist about?

114
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,606
I guess you'll have to ask him.

Yes, sir.

He had a lot to say about you.

122
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,349
McPherson's a good man.
He believes in
the work we do here.

123
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,802
And what would
that be, exactly?

between law and order
and clinical care.

what and what?

Those paintings
are quite accurate.

127
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:21,737
Used to be the kind of patients
we deal with here

128
00:10:21,737 --> 00:10:24,740
were shackled and left
in their own filth.

129
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,242
They were beaten,

130
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:28,494
as if whipping them bloody
would drive the psychosis out.

131
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,630
We drove screws into their brains,

132
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,634
we submerged them
in icy water until
they lost consciousness.

133
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,136
or even drowned.

134
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,088
And now?
We treat them.

135
00:10:39,088 --> 00:10:41,590
Try to heal,
try to cure.

136
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,092
And if that fails,
at least we provide them

137
00:10:43,592 --> 00:10:46,479
with a measure of comfort
in their lives. Calm.

138
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,849
These are all violent offenders,
right?

139
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,984
I mean, they've hurt people.

140
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,320
Murdered them in some cases.

141
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,822
In almost all cases, yes.

142
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,824
Then, personally, Doctor,
I'd have to say,

143
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,327
screw their sense of calm.

144
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,031
It's my job to treat my patients,
not their victims.

145
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,699
I'm not here to judge.

Patient.

148
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,121
Excuse me. Patient,

149

one Rachel Solando, escaped 
sometime in the last 24 hours.

150
00:11:17,293 --> 00:11:19,628
.
Last night between
10:00 and midnight

151
00:11:19,628 --> 00:11:21,013
Is she considered dangerous?

152
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:25,434
You could say that.
She killed all three
of her children.

153
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,804
She drowned them
in the lake behind her house.

154
00:11:28,804 --> 00:11:29,605
She took them out
one by one,

155
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,891
held their heads
under till they died,

156
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,392
then she brought
them back inside

157
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:34,894
and arranged them
around the kitchen table.

158
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:38,230
She ate a meal there before 
a neighbor dropped by.

159
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,734
And what about
the husband?

160
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:45,705
He died on the beaches of 
Normandy. She's a war widow.

00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,074
She starved herself
when she first came here.

162
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,210
She insisted
the children weren't dead.

163
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,134
(DISTORTED CHATTER)

164
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,556
Sorry, Doctor.
You don't happen to have
an aspirin, do you?

165
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,591
Prone to headaches,
Marshal?

166
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:09,061
Sometimes. But today,
I'm a little more
prone to seasickness.

167
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,563
Ah, dehydration.

168
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,732
You all right, boss?
Yeah.

169
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,234
In that case,
you're quite right.
The simpler the better.

170
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,570
Thanks so much.

171
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,524
Rachel still believes
the children are alive.

172
00:12:21,524 --> 00:12:24,276
She also believes
this place is her home
in the Berkshires.

173
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,611
(CHUCKLES)

174
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:27,613
You're kidding me.

175
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:28,614
She's never once
in two years

176
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:30,533
acknowledged that
she's in an institution.

177
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:34,420
She believes
we're all deliverymen,
milkmen, postal workers.

178
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,622
To sustain the delusion
that her children never died,

179
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,125
she's created an elaborate
fictional structure,

180
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:43,379
and she gives us all
parts to play in that fiction.

181
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:45,264
So have you searched
the grounds yet?

182
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,767
The warden and his men
scoured the island.

183
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,352
Not a trace.

184
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,270
And what's more
disturbing is

185
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,774
we don't know how she got out
of her room.

186
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,276
It was locked from the outside,

187
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,778
and the only window is barred.

188
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,700
It's as if she evaporated
straight through the walls.

189
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,794
I brought her right back
here after group therapy,
locked her in,

190
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,797
came back for midnight rounds,
she was gone.

191
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,222
Seriously, Doctor,
how is it possible

192
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,841
that the truth never
gets through to her?

193
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,644
I mean, she's in a mental
institution, right?

194
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,646
Seems like something you'd notice
from time to time.

195
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,098
How many pairs of shoes are 
the patients given?

196
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:37,433
Two pairs.

197
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:39,401
Sanity's not a choice, Marshal.

198
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,605
You can't just choose
to get over it.

199
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:46,442
So, she left here barefoot?

200
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:49,078
Come on, Doc, she couldn't get 
10 yards in that terrain.

201
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,831
CAWLEY: Marshal?

202
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:13,052
This is definitely
Rachel's handwriting.

203
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,804
I have no idea what the law of
four is, though.

204
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,606
It's not a psychiatric term?

205
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,557
I'm afraid not.

206
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,559
"Who is 67?"

207
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,062
.
Fuck if I know

208
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:26,398
.
I have to say
that's quite close to
my clinical conclusion

209
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,400
Think it's just random scribblings?

210
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,238
Oh, no, not at all.
Rachel's smart. Brilliant, in fact.

211
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,156
This paper could be important.

212
00:14:34,156 --> 00:14:37,159
Excuse me, Doctor,
but we're gonna have
to hold on to this.

213
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,494
Of course.

214
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:43,415
CHUCK: And you say
she had to come
through here?

215
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:47,419
.
After lights out, the orderlies
play cards in here

216
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,421
Last night,
there were seven men

217
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,756
sitting at the base of those stairs

218
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:52,675
playing stud poker.

219
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:55,511
Yet somehow, Rachel managed
to slip past them.

220
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,346
(ANGUISHED) Why?

221
00:14:57,346 --> 00:15:00,683
How? She turns invisible?

222
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:03,185
Doctor,
we're gonna need access
to the personnel files

223
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:04,570
of all the medical staff.

224
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,822
The nurses,
the guards, the orderlies,
anyone who was working then.

225
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,108
We'll take your request under consideration.

226
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,075
(CHUCKLES)

227
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,578
This is not a request, Doctor.

228
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,947
This is a federal facility,
and a dangerous prisoner...

229
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,115
Patient.

230
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:17,616
...patient

231
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,952
has escaped.
Now, you will comply or...

232
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,421
.
All I can say is
I'll see what I can do

233
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,924
Doctor, we're gonna need to speak
with the staff.

234
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,376
Do you understand?

235
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:30,462
I'll assemble them in the common room
after dinner.

236
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,464
If you have any further questions,

237
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,467
feel free to join the deputy warden
in the search.

238
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,281
McPHERSON: It's 11 miles
to the nearest land

239
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,150
and the water's freezing.

240
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,153
Current was strong last night,
tide pushing in.

241
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,155
She'd have drowned
or been crushed on the rocks,

242
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:59,158
and her body would have
washed back up on shore.

243
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,462
TEDDY: What about
those caves down there?

244
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,381
Have you checked them?

245
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,883
No way she could get there.

246
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,803
The bases of those cliffs
are covered in poison ivy,

247
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,137
live oak, sumac,

248
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:15,591
a thousand plants with thorns as big
as my dick.

249
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:18,594
You said yourself, Marshal, she's got no shoes.

250
00:16:24,099 --> 00:16:26,902
All right, let's check
the other side.

251
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,525
What's that tower?

252
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,527
.
It's an old lighthouse

253
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,530
.
The guards already
searched inside it

254
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,534
What's in there?
More patients?

255
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,537
Sewage treatment facility.

256
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:49,291
It's getting dark soon . I'm calling this off
for tonight.

257
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,093
Let's go, boys!

258
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,682
TEDDY: You were on watch
on the landing, huh?

259
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,634
Yeah. Couldn't nobody
get in or out

260
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:00,135
of their room on that corridor

261
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:01,887
without me seeing.

262
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,972
Okay, Rachel Solando,

263
00:17:03,972 --> 00:17:06,975
who else does she have to pass
to get down here?

264
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:15,818
Me. Glen Miga.

265
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,071
Sir, I didn't see nothing.

266
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,290
And you were at your post all night?

267
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,575
Yeah, but I didn't see a thing.

268
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,879

I...

272
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,260
I maybe went to the bathroom.

273
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,063
What? You breached protocol.
Christ...

274

All right, look. Let's back up here.
Let's all just back up

276
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:52,938
Miss Solando was put in her room
for lights out.

277
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:56,442
Does anyone here know
what she did before that?

00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,169
Huh.
Anything unusual occur?

282
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,038
Define "unusual."

Yes, he was running the session.

00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,474
.
No, not a clue, Doctor

483
00:30:59,474 --> 00:31:00,775
War.

484
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,695
The old school believes
in surgical intervention.

485
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,196
Psychosurgery.

486
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:09,567
Procedures like
the transorbital lobotomy.

487
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:12,570
Some say the patients
become reasonable, docile.

488
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:15,373
Others say they
become zombies.

489
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,157
And the new school?

490
00:31:16,157 --> 00:31:17,625
Psychopharmacology.

491
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,627
A new drug has just been approved
called Thorazine,

492
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:22,997
which relaxes psychotic patients,
you could say tames them.

493
00:31:22,997 --> 00:31:24,499
And which school are you, Doctor?

494
00:31:24,499 --> 00:31:26,000
Me?

495
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,920
I have this radical idea that if you treat a patient
with respect,

496
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,424
listen to him, try and understand,
you just might reach him.

497
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:36,060
(WOMAN SCREAMING)

498
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,063
Come on, Marge
. It's okay.

499
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,065
These patients, huh?

500
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,767
Even these.

501
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,769
What should be a last resort is becoming
a first response.

502
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:48,489
Give them a pill, put them in a corner,
it all goes away.

503
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,992
Rachel Solando was
on a combination of drugs

504
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,994
meant to keep her
from becoming violent,

505
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,863
but it was only
intermittently effective.

506
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,832
The greatest obstacle
to her recovery

507
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:00,835
was her refusal to face
what she had done.

508
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,421
"Was."

509
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,423
Is there a reason you keep referring
to your patient

510
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,426
in the past tense, Doctor?

511
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,432
Look outside, Marshal.
Why do you think?

512
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:23,191
Next up is Peter Breene.

513
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,193
Assaulted his father's nurse
with broken glass.

514
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:29,197
Nurse survived, but her face is
permanently disfigured

515
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,698
I can't wait.

516
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:34,035
She'd smile at me.
She was so sweet,

517
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,038
but you could see it in her eyes.

518
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,241
She liked to be naked,
to suck cock.

519
00:32:41,743 --> 00:32:44,245
Okay, Mr. Breene.

520
00:32:44,245 --> 00:32:47,415
And then she asked me if she can have
a glass of water?

521
00:32:47,415 --> 00:32:50,718
Alone, in the kitchen,
like that's no big deal?

522
00:32:51,586 --> 00:32:53,087
Well, why was that
a big deal?

523
00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:54,973
It was obvious.

524
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,475
She wanted me to pull out my thing

525
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:58,977
so that she could laugh at it.

526
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,680
Mr. Breene.

527
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:06,851
We need to ask you
some questions, okay?

528
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:11,155
When I cut her, she screamed.

529
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:15,827
.
But (SNORTS) she scared me

530
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,830
What did she expect?

531
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,999
Interesting.

532
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,502
But we're here to talk about
Rachel Solando, okay?

533
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,621
Rachel Solando.
Do you...

534
00:33:27,121 --> 00:33:29,340
Do you know that
she drowned her own kids?

535
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,342
She drowned her kids!

536
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,844
This is...

537
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,712
This is a sick fucking world we live in,
I'll tell you that.

538
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,047
But you know what?
They should be gassed.

539
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:40,802
All of them. The retards,
the killers, the niggers.

540
00:33:40,802 --> 00:33:43,388
You kill your own kid,
gas the bitch.

541
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:46,941
(PENCIL SCRATCHING LOUDLY)

542
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,726
Could you stop that?

543
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:50,945
That nurse...

544
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,447
Please, stop that.

545
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:55,483
That nurse,
maybe she had kids, huh?

546
00:33:57,652 --> 00:33:59,153
A husband.

547
00:34:00,154 --> 00:34:02,657
Just trying to make ends meet,

548
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,993
lead a normal life.

549
00:34:06,994 --> 00:34:10,498
It says in your file that

550
00:34:10,498 --> 00:34:13,000
you tore her face off.
Didn't you?

551
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,553
Congratulations.

552
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,389
No more normal for her,
not ever again. No.

553
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,927
Do you know what
she was afraid of?

554
00:34:25,513 --> 00:34:26,681
You.

555
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:29,267
(LOUDLY) Could you
stop that? Please?

556
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,437
Stop that!

557
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:34,989
Please! Stop!

558
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,991
Do you know a patient
named Andrew Laeddis?
Do you?

559
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,276
No! No.

560
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:39,277
Boss. What's up?

561
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,578
Fine.

562
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,363
I wanna go back. I wanna go.
Peter!

563
00:34:42,864 --> 00:34:46,367
Come on! I got him.
Peter! Peter!
Hey, Peter!

564
00:34:46,367 --> 00:34:48,086
PETER: Go back.
I wanna go back.

565
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:48,920
TREY: Come on, Peter.

566
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,455
I don't wanna see him.
Easy now.

567
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,456
I don't wanna
see him anymore.

568
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,341
It's okay.
It's all right.

569
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:03,101
Oh,
I'll never get out of here
. I'm not sure that I should

570
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,188
Excuse me for saying this,
Miss Kearns...

571
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:08,973
Mrs.

572
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,391
Mrs. Kearns.

573
00:35:11,893 --> 00:35:14,896
But you seem quite normal.

574
00:35:14,896 --> 00:35:18,032
I mean, in comparison to the
other patients here.

575
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:23,037
Well, I have my dark days.
I suppose everybody does.

576
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:26,657
The difference is
most people don't kill
their husbands with an ax.

577
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,659
Ah.

578
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:31,412
Although, personally,
I think if a man beats you

579
00:35:31,412 --> 00:35:36,918
and fucks half the women he sees,
and no one will help you,

580
00:35:36,918 --> 00:35:40,638
axing him isn't the least understandable
thing you could do.

581
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,474
Maybe you shouldn't get out.

582
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,009
(CHUCKLES)

583
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,012
What would I do if I did?

584
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,514
I don't know the world anymore.

585
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:54,602
They say there are
bombs that can reduce
whole cities to ash.

586
00:35:54,602 --> 00:35:57,605
And what do you
call them, televisions,

587
00:35:57,605 --> 00:35:59,740
voices and faces
coming from a box.

588
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:03,778
(CHUCKLES) I hear
enough voices already.

589
00:36:04,278 --> 00:36:06,164
What can you
tell us about Rachel?

590
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,167
Um...

591
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,170
Not much.
She keeps to herself.

592
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,674
She believed
her kids were alive.

593
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,126
She thought she was still living
in the Berkshires,

594
00:36:19,126 --> 00:36:24,015
and we were all her neighbors,
the milkmen, postmen...

595
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,517
Deliverymen.

596
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,103
And Dr. Sheehan
was there that night?

597
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:33,107
.
Yes. He talked about anger

598
00:36:35,643 --> 00:36:38,980
Tell me about him.
What's he like?

599
00:36:40,982 --> 00:36:42,483
Uh, he's, uh...

600
00:36:44,986 --> 00:36:46,988
Okay. Nice.

601
00:36:47,989 --> 00:36:50,491
Not hard on the eyes,
as my mother would say.

602
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,211
(CHUCKLING SOFTLY)

603
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,129
Did he ever
make a pass at you?

604
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,132
No.

605
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:01,302
No, Dr. Sheehan's a good doctor,
he would never...

606
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,722
Um...

607
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,724
(STAMMERING) Could I have
a glass of water, please?

608
00:37:07,174 --> 00:37:08,509
No problem.

609
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:24,775
Thank you, Marshal.
CHUCK: Sure.

610
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,750
TEDDY: I just have
one more question for you,
Mrs. Kearns.

611
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:39,173
Did you ever meet a patient named 
Andrew Laeddis?

612
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,678
No.

613
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,547
(VOICE BREAKING)
Never heard of him.

614
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,105
TEDDY: She was coached.

615
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:57,108
She used
practically the same words
as Cawley and the nurse,

616
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,609
like she'd been told
exactly what to say.

617
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,227
Who's Andrew Laeddis?

618
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:07,318
You asked every one
of those patients
back there about him.

619
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:09,320
Who is he?

What the hell, boss?
I'm your partner,
for Christ's sake.

622
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,080
.
We just met, Chuck

623
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,082
You've been on the beat for a long time.

624
00:38:21,082 --> 00:38:22,583
You've got a duty.
You've got a career.

625
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:26,887
What I'm doing,
it's not exactly
by the book.

626
00:38:28,756 --> 00:38:31,258
I don't give a damn about
by-the-book, boss.

627
00:38:31,258 --> 00:38:34,061
I just wanna know
what the hell's going on.

628
00:38:38,432 --> 00:38:41,902
When this case
came over the wires,

629
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,905
I requested it specifically,
you understand?

630
00:38:45,272 --> 00:38:46,741
Why?

631
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:51,529
Andrew Laeddis,

632
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,531
he was the maintenance man
in the apartment building

633
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:56,033
where my wife and I lived.

634
00:38:56,784 --> 00:38:58,285
Okay.

635
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:02,206
He was also a firebug.

636
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:07,211
Andrew Laeddis
lit the match

637
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:13,217
that caused the fire
that killed my wife.

638
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,610
GUARD: Let them out!

639
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,565
CHUCK: What happened
to Laeddis?

640
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:28,566
.
TEDDY: He got away with it

641
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:31,068
Laeddis got away with it
and then he disappeared.

642
00:39:31,485 --> 00:39:34,488
About a year ago,
I open up the paper
and there he is.

643
00:39:34,488 --> 00:39:36,490
Ugly-looking
son of a bitch.

644
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:38,993
Huge scar
from his right temple
down to his left lip.

645
00:39:38,993 --> 00:39:42,546
Eyes different colors.
Not the type of face
you'd forget.

646
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:45,549
He burned down
a schoolhouse,
killed two people,

647
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,551
said voices
told him to do it.

648
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,421
First he went to prison,
then he got transferred here.

649
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:51,422
Then what?

650
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:52,923
Then nothing.

651
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:56,427
He vanished like
he never existed.
No record whatsoever.

652
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:58,929
Pretty sure
he's not in Ward B.
That leaves Ward C.

653
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:00,231
Or he could be dead.

654
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,067
So could Rachel Solando,
for that matter.

655
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,070
Lot of places to
hide a body here.

656
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,073
Only one place no one
would really notice.

That patient,
Bridget Kearns,

658
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,089
when she sent me
for water,

659
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:28,125
she said something
to you back there,
didn't she?

660
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,126
No.

661
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,179
Come on, boss.

662
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,635

665
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,206
Hold on.

666
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,658
No, let's go!

667
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,829

You okay, boss?

678
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,203
Yeah, I'm all right.

679
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,462
So if Laeddis is here,

680
00:41:56,463 --> 00:41:57,464
what are you
gonna do about it?

681
00:41:57,464 --> 00:41:58,966
Mmm.

682
00:42:00,467 --> 00:42:02,970
I'm not here
to kill Laeddis.

683
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,279
If it was my wife,
I'd kill him.

684
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,280
Twice.

685
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,044
TEDDY: When we got
through the gates
at Dachau,

686
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,796
the SS guards surrendered.

687
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,557
The Kommandant
tried to kill himself

688
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,893
before we got there,
but he...

689
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:45,563
He botched it.

690
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,183
Took him an hour to die.

691
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:57,741
When I went outside,
I saw all the bodies
on the ground.

692
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,747
Too many to count.

693
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,610
Too many to imagine.

694
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,614
So, yeah, the...

695
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,951
The guards surrendered
, we took their guns,

696
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,153
and we lined them up.

It was murder.

Yeah, I've had
enough of killing.

.
After Laeddis vanished
, I started doing some
checking on Ashecliffe

708
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,229
A lot of people
know about this place,
but no one wants to talk.

709
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:01,231
You know, it's like it...

710
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,484
It's like they're
scared or something.

711
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:09,323
You know,
this place is funded
by a special grant

712
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,159
from The House
Un-American
Activities Committee?

713
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:15,796
HUAC? And how exactly
are we fighting
the communists

714
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,582
from an island
in Boston Harbor?

715
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:21,085
By conducting
experiments on the mind.

716
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,088
At least that's my guess.

717
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,756
And you think
that's going on here?

718
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:28,258
Like I said,
no one would talk, right?

719
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:31,261
Till I found somebody
who used to be
a patient here.

720
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:35,899
Guy's name is George Noyce.
Nice college kid. Socialist.

721
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,601
He gets offered some money
to do a psych study.

722
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:39,319
Guess what
they were testing?

723
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,687
Toothpaste.

724
00:45:40,687 --> 00:45:43,157
So, he starts seeing
dragons everywhere.

725
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,908
He almost beats his
professor to death.

726
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:48,862
Ends up here
in Ashecliffe, Ward C.

727
00:45:48,862 --> 00:45:52,282
They release him
after one year, right?
And what does he do?

728
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:57,204
Two weeks on the mainland,
he walks into a bar,
stabs three men to death.

729
00:45:58,205 --> 00:45:59,206
His lawyer pleads insanity,

730
00:45:59,706 --> 00:46:02,709
but Noyce, he stands up
in the courtroom and he...

731
00:46:02,709 --> 00:46:04,711
He begs the judge
for the electric chair.

732
00:46:04,711 --> 00:46:07,714
Anywhere but
a mental hospital.

733
00:46:07,714 --> 00:46:10,517
Judge gives him life
in Dedham Prison.

734
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,436
And you found him.

735
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,388
Yeah, I found him.

736
00:46:14,388 --> 00:46:16,890
Well, he's a mess.

737
00:46:18,392 --> 00:46:20,394
But it's pretty clear
from what he tells me.

738
00:46:20,894 --> 00:46:21,895
What?

739
00:46:21,895 --> 00:46:24,398
They're experimenting
on people here.

740
00:46:24,898 --> 00:46:26,200
I don't know, boss.

741
00:46:27,901 --> 00:46:29,403
How do you believe
a crazy guy?

742
00:46:29,403 --> 00:46:30,737
That's the beauty
of it, isn't it?

743
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:32,656
Crazy people,
they're the perfect subjects.

744
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:35,659
They talk, nobody listens.

745
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:37,911
I stood at Dachau.

746
00:46:37,911 --> 00:46:40,414
We saw what
human beings
are capable

747
00:46:40,414 --> 00:46:42,416
of doing to
each other, right?

748
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:44,918
For Christ's sakes,
we fought a goddamn war
to stop them,

749
00:46:45,419 --> 00:46:47,421
and now...
Now I find out it
may be happening here?

750
00:46:47,921 --> 00:46:50,174
On our soil? No.

751
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:54,561
?
So what are you
really here to do, Ted

752
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:58,565
I'm gonna get the proof,
I'm gonna go back,

753
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,567
and I'm gonna blow
the lid off this place.

754
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:02,569
That's it.

755
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,656
Wait a minute.

756
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,408
You started asking around
about Ashecliffe,

757
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,910
waiting for a chance
to get out here,

758
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,446
and then suddenly
they need a U.S. Marshal?

759
00:47:12,946 --> 00:47:14,448
Yeah, I got lucky.

760
00:47:14,448 --> 00:47:16,450
There was a patient escape.
It was the perfect excuse.

761
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:19,870
No, no, no, boss.
Luck doesn't work
that way.

762
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,371
The world doesn't
work that way.

763
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:24,875
They got an
electrified fence
around a septic facility.

764
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:27,878
Ward C is inside
a Civil War fort?

765
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:31,882
A Chief of Staff
with ties to the OSS?
Funding from HUAC?

766
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:33,383
I mean, Jesus Christ,

767
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:36,386
everything about
this place stinks of
government ops.

768
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:38,355
What if they
wanted you here?
Bullshit.

769
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:39,473
You were asking questions.

770
00:47:39,973 --> 00:47:40,474
Bullshit! Bullshit!

771
00:47:40,974 --> 00:47:42,476
Bullshit. We came here
for Rachel Solando.

772
00:47:42,476 --> 00:47:45,062
Where's one
shred of evidence
she even existed?

773
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:46,563
There's no way
they could've known

774
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:48,065
I'd be assigned
to this case.
There's no way.

775
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:49,616
What if while you were
looking into them,

776
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:51,618
they were
looking into you?

777
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,203
All they had to do
was fake an escape

778
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,705
to get you here,
and now they have you.

779
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,540
Now they have us both.
Here! Now!

780
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,213
McPHERSON: (ON MEGAPHONE)
Marshals, are you out here?

781
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,249
This is Deputy
Warden McPherson.

782
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,301
Marshals!

783
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,636
How about that?
They found us, huh?

784
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,972
It's an island, boss.
They're always gonna find us.

785
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,725
I know you're in there.

786
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:20,097
We're getting off
this goddamn island.
You and me. Come on.

787
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,019
Come on!
Go, go!

788
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:39,666
McPHERSON: Get dried off.
Dr. Cawley wants to
talk to you now.

789
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:43,253
And hurry up!
This thing is turning
into a goddamn hurricane!

790
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:53,013
I dropped those
suits off to be cleaned.
Should be ready by tomorrow.

791
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,515
That is, if we all
don't wash away first.

792
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,017
You know,
speaking of which,

793
00:48:57,017 --> 00:49:00,020
I'm afraid your smokes
are pretty much done for.

794
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,022
So...

795
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,943
This is our
only choice, huh?

796
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,946
Got something really nice
in a prison gray if that
don't work for you.

797
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:12,566
Now that you mention it,
these are just fine.

798
00:49:12,566 --> 00:49:15,619
That's why I must
repeat my insistence
that all Ward C patients

799
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,205
be placed in
manual restraints.

800
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:21,992
If the facility floods
, they'll drown.
You know that.

801
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:22,909
NAEHRING: That would take
a lot of flooding.

802
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:24,411
CAWLEY: We're on an island

803
00:49:24,411 --> 00:49:25,912
in the middle of the ocean
during a hurricane.

804
00:49:25,912 --> 00:49:28,465
.
A lot of flooding
seems like
a distinct possibility

805
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,801
DOCTOR 1:
It's a gamble, Stephen
. Say the power fails.

806
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,636
.
There's a backup generator

807
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,055
And if that goes,
the cell doors will open.

808
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:39,059
Where are they
going to go? Mmm?

809
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,560
They can't jus
t hop a ferry,

810
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,062
scoot over to the mainland
and wreak havoc.

811
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,480
.
NAEHRING: Oh,
you're quite right

812
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,351
They're far more likely
to wreak havoc
right here on us.

813
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:50,654
If they're manacled
to the floor, they'll die.

814
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,939
This is 24 human beings.

815
00:49:52,939 --> 00:49:54,324
?
And you can live
with that, can you

816
00:49:54,775 --> 00:49:56,777
Well, frankly,
if it were up to me,

817
00:49:56,777 --> 00:49:58,445
I'd put all 42
in Wards A and B

818
00:49:58,945 --> 00:50:00,280
in manual restraints as well.

819
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,865
Excuse me! Excuse me.

820
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:03,367
CAWLEY: Marshal.

821
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:05,752
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I just have one
quick question.

822
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,254
Yes, I'll be with you
in a moment.

823
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:10,007
When we spoke
this morning about
Rachel Solando's note...

824
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,925
"The law of four."
I love that.

825
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,210
...you said
you had no idea

826
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,346
what that second line
could refer to, correct?

827
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:20,967
"Who is 67?" Yes,
I'm afraid I still don't.
None of us do.

828
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:23,553
Uh-huh.
Nothing comes to mind?

829
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:27,724
Nothing?

830
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,696
Because I believe
I just heard you say

831
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:36,700
there are 24 patients
in Ward C

832
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,202
and 42 patients
in Wards A and B,

833
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,704
which means
there's a total of, what,

834
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,706
66 patients
at this facility?

835
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,375
That is correct, yes.

836
00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:51,832
Well, it seems to me
Rachel Solando
was suggesting

837
00:50:51,832 --> 00:50:55,085
that you have
a 67th patient, Doctor.

838
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,921
But I'm afraid we don't.

839
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,474
(CHUCKLING)
This is ridiculous.
What are they doing here?

our goddamn job.

841

Didn't McPherson
tell you the good news

842
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:09,266
(SIGHS) No.
What's the good news, Doctor?

843
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:11,268
Rachel's been found.

844
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:13,770

845

Who are these men?

848
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:40,130
(WHISPERING)
Why are they in my house?

849
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:44,634
Police officers, Rachel.
They have a few questions.

850
00:51:48,054 --> 00:51:49,556
Ma'am.

851
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,561
There has been
a sighting of a known

852
00:51:54,561 --> 00:51:57,447

in this area,

853
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,449
.

854

Yes, I'm afraid so

857
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:13,046
Now if you could tell us
what you did yesterday,
where you were,

858
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:15,048
.
it would really help u
s narrow down our search

859

Well, I, um...

861
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:28,061
I made breakfast
for Jim and the children,

862
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,064
and then I

863
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:35,068
packed Jim's lunch
and he left.

864
00:52:38,939 --> 00:52:41,441
Then I sent the children
off to school.

865
00:52:46,112 --> 00:52:47,113

After that,

I don't know what
you're talking about.

875
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,640
Don't you know
how lonely I've been, Jim?

876
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:53,897

01:12:54,144 --> 01:12:55,446
What the hell do you mean?

1113
01:12:55,863 --> 01:12:57,865
All your talk.
All your fucking talk,

1114
01:12:57,865 --> 01:12:59,867
and I'm back in here
because of you.

1115
01:12:59,867 --> 01:13:02,653
George,
how did they get you
out of Dedham, huh?

1116
01:13:02,653 --> 01:13:03,654
(STAMMERING) However this
happened, I...

1117
01:13:03,654 --> 01:13:05,990
I'm gonna find
a way to fix this,
you understand me?

1118
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:09,793
I'll never get out now.
I got out once.
Not twice, never twice.

1119
01:13:09,793 --> 01:13:11,579
Just tell me how
they got you here.

1120
01:13:11,579 --> 01:13:15,082
They knew!
Don't you get it?

1121
01:13:15,082 --> 01:13:18,419
Everything you were up to.
Your whole plan.

1122
01:13:18,886 --> 01:13:23,173
This is a game.
All of this is for you.

1123
01:13:23,173 --> 01:13:25,175
You're not
investigating anything.

1124
01:13:25,676 --> 01:13:27,678
You're a fucking rat
in a maze.

1125
01:13:29,179 --> 01:13:30,648
Georgie...

1126
01:13:30,648 --> 01:13:32,149
George, you're wrong.
You're wrong.

1127
01:13:32,650 --> 01:13:35,152
Oh, really?

1128
01:13:35,152 --> 01:13:36,654
Been alone much
since you got here?

1129
01:13:38,489 --> 01:13:40,774
I've been with my partner.

1130
01:13:41,275 --> 01:13:42,660
You never worked
with him before,
have you?

1131
01:13:45,112 --> 01:13:47,414
He's a U.S. Marshal.
He's...

1132
01:13:47,831 --> 01:13:50,334
(INSISTENTLY) You never
worked with him before,
have you?

1133
01:13:53,504 --> 01:13:57,007
George, look,
I know people.
I trust this man.

1134
01:14:01,962 --> 01:14:03,964
Then they've already won.

1135
01:14:06,967 --> 01:14:07,968
(WHIMPERS) Fuck.

1136
01:14:09,770 --> 01:14:12,890
(SOBBING)

1137
01:14:12,890 --> 01:14:15,893
And they're gonna take me
to the lighthouse.

1138
01:14:17,895 --> 01:14:19,396
They're gonna
cut into my brain.

1139
01:14:20,698 --> 01:14:22,700
And I'm only here

1140
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,069
(SHOUTING) because of you!

1141
01:14:25,569 --> 01:14:27,571
George, I'm gonna
get you out of here.

1142
01:14:27,571 --> 01:14:30,074
You're not going
to the lighthouse.
You're not.

1143
01:14:30,074 --> 01:14:31,458
You can't dig out the truth

1144
01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:32,960
and kill Laeddis
at the same time.

1145
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,797
You gotta make a choice.
You understand that,
don't you?

1146
01:14:36,797 --> 01:14:38,549
.
I'm not here
to kill anyone

1147
01:14:38,549 --> 01:14:40,000
Liar!

1148
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,253
I'm not gonna kill him,
I swear to you! I swear.

1149
01:14:43,253 --> 01:14:44,755
She's dead.

1150
01:14:45,756 --> 01:14:47,341
She... Let her go.

1151
01:14:48,842 --> 01:14:51,345
Let her go.

1152
01:14:51,345 --> 01:14:54,181
DOLORES: Tell him, Teddy.
Tell him why.

1153
01:14:57,101 --> 01:15:00,487
You gotta do it.
There's no other way.

1154
01:15:00,487 --> 01:15:01,989
Let her go.
Tell him about the day

1155
01:15:01,989 --> 01:15:03,490
you brought me
my locket.

1156
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:05,192
You gotta do it!

1157
01:15:05,192 --> 01:15:08,746
How I told you
my heart was breaking
and you asked me why.

1158
01:15:08,746 --> 01:15:11,448
She's fucking with your head.

1159
01:15:11,448 --> 01:15:13,450
And I told you
it was from happiness.

1160
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:16,170
She's gonna kill you.
She's gonna kill you.

1161
01:15:19,006 --> 01:15:22,509
You wanna uncover the truth?
You gotta let her go.

1162
01:15:24,511 --> 01:15:26,296
!
I can't.
You have to let her go

1163
01:15:26,296 --> 01:15:28,298
I can't! I can't.

1164
01:15:35,105 --> 01:15:37,608
Then you'll never
leave this island.

1165
01:15:43,113 --> 01:15:44,314
Dolores.

1166
01:15:51,739 --> 01:15:53,240
He's not in this ward.

1167
01:15:55,242 --> 01:15:58,245
He was transferred
out of here.

1168
01:16:00,748 --> 01:16:05,252
If he's not in Ward A,
there's only one place
he can be.

1169
01:16:11,141 --> 01:16:12,893
The lighthouse.

1170
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,351
Hey,

1171
01:16:23,737 --> 01:16:25,239
God help you.

1172
01:16:34,114 --> 01:16:35,115
Boss, we got problems.

1173
01:16:35,616 --> 01:16:38,168
McPherson and Cawley
are in the building.

1174
01:16:38,168 --> 01:16:39,670
They heard an orderly
went batshit on a patient.

1175
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:41,171
They're looking all
over the place for him

1176
01:16:41,672 --> 01:16:42,673
and they're on
their way to the roof.

1177
01:16:42,673 --> 01:16:44,675
Let's get the hell
out of here. This way.

1178
01:16:47,678 --> 01:16:50,180
Just keep going.
We belong here.

1179
01:16:53,433 --> 01:16:54,935
(TEDDY GRUNTS)

1180
01:16:56,436 --> 01:16:58,021
(BOTH PANTING)

1181
01:17:00,023 --> 01:17:01,775
What happened to you?

1182
01:17:01,775 --> 01:17:03,894
What do you mean?
I mean,

1183
01:17:03,894 --> 01:17:05,779
where were you?

1184
01:17:05,779 --> 01:17:07,281
After we got that guy
to the infirmary,

1185
01:17:07,281 --> 01:17:10,617
I took a little detour
to patient records.

1186
01:17:10,617 --> 01:17:12,536
Did you ever find Laeddis?

1187
01:17:13,036 --> 01:17:14,538
No. No, I never found him.

1188
01:17:14,538 --> 01:17:17,875
Well, I got
the next best thing.
His intake form.

1189
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:18,876
It was the only thing
in his files.

1190
01:17:18,876 --> 01:17:20,244
There's no session notes,

1191
01:17:20,244 --> 01:17:23,497
no incident reports,
no photographs, just this.
It was weird.

1192
01:17:23,997 --> 01:17:25,499
Here. Take a look.

1193
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,501
I'll look at it later.

1194
01:17:29,503 --> 01:17:31,722
What's the matter, boss?

1195
01:17:31,722 --> 01:17:34,224
I'll look it over later,
that's all.

1196
01:17:36,226 --> 01:17:37,728
Ashecliffe's that way.

1197
01:17:37,728 --> 01:17:39,730
I'm not going
to Ashecliffe.

1198
01:17:41,398 --> 01:17:42,900
I'm going to
that lighthouse.

1199
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,652
I'm gonna find out
what the fuck is happening
on this island.

1200
01:17:59,449 --> 01:18:02,035
TEDDY: There it is.

1201
01:18:02,035 --> 01:18:05,789
Damn. We're too far south.
We're gonna have to
double back.

1202
01:18:06,089 --> 01:18:08,091
There's no way we could
cross those rocks.

1203
01:18:08,091 --> 01:18:10,127
There could be a way
behind those trees.

1204
01:18:10,127 --> 01:18:12,129
Maybe a path that goes
around the rocks

1205
01:18:12,129 --> 01:18:13,130
and leads over
to the lighthouse.

1206
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:14,548
Boss...
Come on.

1207
01:18:14,548 --> 01:18:16,550
Wait, wait,
what are we doing?
We got the intake form.

1208
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:18,552
It's proof
there's a 67th patient,

1209
01:18:18,552 --> 01:18:21,939
which they said,
repeatedly, doesn't exist.

1210
01:18:21,939 --> 01:18:24,942
I'm getting to
that lighthouse.
You understand?

1211
01:18:27,277 --> 01:18:29,229
What the hell
can I say to you
to stop you?

1212
01:18:29,529 --> 01:18:31,815
Why would you want to,
Chuck? Why?

1213
01:18:31,815 --> 01:18:33,734
Because climbing
down there when it's dark

1214
01:18:33,734 --> 01:18:36,536
is a thin step
short of suicide,
that's why.

1215
01:18:37,037 --> 01:18:40,040
Okay, maybe you better
sit this one out then.

1216
01:18:41,658 --> 01:18:43,660
You brought me
into this, boss,

1217
01:18:44,161 --> 01:18:47,464
and now we're trapped
here on this rock,
on this island,

1218
01:18:47,464 --> 01:18:48,916
with no one to rely on
but each other,

1219
01:18:48,916 --> 01:18:50,918
and now you're acting like...

1220
01:18:50,918 --> 01:18:52,920
Like what? Like what?

1221
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:54,388
How am I acting?

1222
01:18:58,892 --> 01:19:02,396
What the hell
happened back there
in those cells, Ted?

1223
01:19:06,817 --> 01:19:10,520
?
What do you think
the weather's like
in Portland, Chuck

1224
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:12,022

alone.

1228
01:19:24,868 --> 01:19:26,670
I'm going with you, boss.

1229
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:27,671
I said alone.

1230
01:19:29,673 --> 01:19:30,540
Fine.

1231
01:19:57,317 --> 01:19:58,318

01:19:59,319 --> 01:20:00,821
Damn it.

but I couldn't get to it.

I'm gonna keep this

Did you kill your children?

I never had children.

01:24:46,072 --> 01:24:47,574
?
And if I say I'm not crazy

1269
01:24:48,575 --> 01:24:52,078
Well, that hardly helps,
does it?

1270
01:24:52,078 --> 01:24:54,581
That's the Kafkaesque
genius of it.

1271
01:24:57,951 --> 01:25:00,337
People tell the world
you're crazy,

1272
01:25:00,337 --> 01:25:01,838
and all your protests
to the contrary

1273
01:25:01,838 --> 01:25:04,457
just confirm
what they're saying.

1274
01:25:04,958 --> 01:25:08,628
I'm not following you.
I'm sorry.

1275
01:25:08,628 --> 01:25:10,513
Once you're declared insane,

1276
01:25:10,513 --> 01:25:14,050
then anything you do
is called part of
that insanity.

1277
01:25:14,050 --> 01:25:17,137
Reasonable protests
are denial.

1278
01:25:17,137 --> 01:25:19,723
Valid fears, paranoia.

1279
01:25:19,939 --> 01:25:21,441
Survival instincts are

1280
01:25:22,442 --> 01:25:23,943
defense mechanisms.

1281
01:25:24,361 --> 01:25:25,612
You're smarter than you look, Marshal.

1282
01:25:25,612 --> 01:25:27,781
That's probably
not a good thing.

1283
01:25:28,698 --> 01:25:30,200
Tell me something.

1284
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,701
Yeah.

1285
01:25:32,702 --> 01:25:35,205
What happened to you?

1286
01:25:35,205 --> 01:25:38,875
I started asking about
these large shipments
of sodium amytal

1287
01:25:38,875 --> 01:25:40,744
and opium-based
hallucinogens.

1288
01:25:40,744 --> 01:25:42,462
Psychotropic drugs.

1289
01:25:43,463 --> 01:25:45,965
.
I asked about
the surgeries, too

1290
01:25:47,967 --> 01:25:50,253
You ever heard of
a transorbital lobotomy?

1291
01:25:51,755 --> 01:25:54,557
They zap the patient
with electroshock,

1292
01:25:54,557 --> 01:25:57,477
then go through the eye
with an ice pick,

1293
01:25:59,729 --> 01:26:01,731
.
pull out some nerve fibers

1294
01:26:04,317 --> 01:26:06,653
Makes the patients
much more obedient.

1295
01:26:06,653 --> 01:26:08,021
Tractable.

1296
01:26:09,606 --> 01:26:10,824
It's barbaric,

1297
01:26:12,108 --> 01:26:14,160
unconscionable.

1298
01:26:14,661 --> 01:26:18,281
Do you know how pain
enters the body, Marshal?
Do you?

1299
01:26:19,282 --> 01:26:21,084
Depends on where you're hurt?

1300
01:26:21,084 --> 01:26:22,001
No,

1301
01:26:22,369 --> 01:26:24,003
it has nothing
to do with the flesh.

1302
01:26:24,003 --> 01:26:26,673
The brain controls pain.

1303
01:26:27,006 --> 01:26:31,428
The brain controls fear,
empathy, sleep, hunger,
anger. Everything.

1304
01:26:33,546 --> 01:26:35,715
What if you could control it?

1305
01:26:36,015 --> 01:26:37,350
You mean the brain?

1306
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:39,386
Recreate a man

1307
01:26:39,386 --> 01:26:44,057
so he doesn't feel pain or love or sympathy.

1308
01:26:45,558 --> 01:26:47,060
A man who can't
be interrogated,

1309
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:49,696
.
because he has
no memories to confess

1310
01:26:52,615 --> 01:26:55,985
You can
never take away all
a man's memories. Never.

1311
01:26:56,486 --> 01:27:00,457
Marshal, the North Koreans
used American POWs

1312
01:27:00,457 --> 01:27:02,242
during their
brainwashing experiments.

1313
01:27:02,242 --> 01:27:03,960
.
They turned
soldiers into traitors

1314
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:05,295
.
That's what
they're doing here

1315
01:27:05,795 --> 01:27:07,714
They're creating ghost
s to go out in the world

1316
01:27:08,047 --> 01:27:11,134
and do things sane men...
Sane men never would.

1317
01:27:11,134 --> 01:27:14,387
To have that kind of ability,
that kind of knowledge,

1318
01:27:14,387 --> 01:27:15,722
that would take years.

1319
01:27:15,722 --> 01:27:17,474
Years. Years of research.

1320
01:27:17,474 --> 01:27:20,226
Hundreds of patients
to experiment on.

1321
01:27:21,094 --> 01:27:23,096
Fifty years from now,

1322
01:27:23,096 --> 01:27:25,815
people will
look back and say,
here, this place,

1323
01:27:25,815 --> 01:27:27,317
is where it all began.

1324
01:27:27,817 --> 01:27:29,319
The Nazis used the Jews,

1325
01:27:29,319 --> 01:27:33,573
Soviets used prisoners
in their own Gulags,
and we,

1326
01:27:33,573 --> 01:27:36,943
we tested patients
on Shutter Island.

1327
01:27:38,862 --> 01:27:40,196
No, they won't.

1328
01:27:41,197 --> 01:27:42,449
No.

1329
01:27:44,751 --> 01:27:46,920
You do understand

1330
01:27:49,372 --> 01:27:51,791
that they can't
let you leave.

1331
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:56,596
I am a federal marshal.
They can't stop me.

1332
01:27:56,596 --> 01:28:02,018
I was
an esteemed psychiatrist
from a respected family.

1333
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:05,438
Didn't matter.

1334
01:28:08,274 --> 01:28:09,859
Let me ask you.

1335
01:28:09,859 --> 01:28:12,362
Any past traumas
in your life?

1336
01:28:13,563 --> 01:28:14,948
Yes.

1337
01:28:15,899 --> 01:28:18,201
But why would that matter?

1338
01:28:18,201 --> 01:28:20,570
Because they're gonna
point to some event
in your past

1339
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:23,289
and say it's the reason you lost your sanity.

1340
01:28:23,289 --> 01:28:25,291
So that when they
commit you here,

1341
01:28:25,575 --> 01:28:28,795
your friends and
colleagues will say,

1342
01:28:28,795 --> 01:28:31,581
"Of course he cracked.

1343
01:28:31,581 --> 01:28:33,082
"Who wouldn't after what
he'd been through?"

1344
01:28:33,082 --> 01:28:35,502
They can say that
about anyone,
anyone at all.

1345
01:28:35,502 --> 01:28:38,338
The point is they're gonna
say it about you.

1346
01:28:41,891 --> 01:28:43,309
How's your head?

1347
01:28:43,309 --> 01:28:45,645
My head?

1348
01:28:45,645 --> 01:28:48,932
Any funny dreams lately?
Trouble sleeping?

1349
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:52,685
Headaches?

1350
01:28:54,187 --> 01:28:55,688
I am prone to migraines, yes.

1351
01:28:55,939 --> 01:28:56,906
Jesus.

1352
01:28:59,359 --> 01:29:02,529
You haven't taken
any pills, have you?
I mean, even aspirin?

1353
01:29:02,996 --> 01:29:03,997
The aspirin?

1354
01:29:03,997 --> 01:29:05,582
Jesus.

1355
01:29:05,582 --> 01:29:07,417
And you ate the food
in the cafeteria

1356
01:29:07,417 --> 01:29:09,502
and drank the coffee
they gave you?

1357
01:29:09,502 --> 01:29:13,006
You tell me, at least,
that you've been smoking
your own cigarettes.

1358
01:29:14,674 --> 01:29:15,675
No.

1359
01:29:16,543 --> 01:29:18,011
No.

1360
01:29:18,678 --> 01:29:20,213
No, I haven't.

1361
01:29:20,713 --> 01:29:23,216
It takes 36 to 48 hours
for neuroleptic narcotics

1362
01:29:23,216 --> 01:29:25,935
to reach workable levels
in the bloodstream.

1363
01:29:27,554 --> 01:29:29,973
Palsy comes first,

1364
01:29:30,557 --> 01:29:34,811
first the fingertips,
then eventually
the whole hand.

1365
01:29:34,811 --> 01:29:39,232
Seen any walking nightmare
s lately, Marshal? Huh?

1366
01:29:41,534 --> 01:29:44,454
Tell me what goes on
in that lighthouse.

1367
01:29:45,572 --> 01:29:46,706
Tell me.

1368
01:29:47,957 --> 01:29:50,043
Brain surgery.

1369
01:29:50,376 --> 01:29:50,877
The let's-open-
the-skull-and-see-

1370
01:29:51,461 --> 01:29:54,964
what-happens-if-we
- pull-on-this kind.

1371
01:29:54,964 --> 01:29:57,967
The learned-it-
from-the-Nazis kind.

1372
01:30:00,253 --> 01:30:02,422
That's where they
create the ghosts.

1373
01:30:04,223 --> 01:30:07,810
Who knows about this?
On the island, I mean. Who?

1374
01:30:10,313 --> 01:30:11,514
Everyone.

1375
01:30:11,514 --> 01:30:15,568
Come on. The nurses?
The orderlies?

1376
01:30:15,935 --> 01:30:17,153
They couldn't
possibly know...

1377
01:30:17,570 --> 01:30:19,188
(FIRMLY) Everyone.

1378
01:30:38,007 --> 01:30:39,876
You can't stay here.

1379
01:30:40,376 --> 01:30:41,878
They think I'm dead,
that I drowned.

1380
01:30:41,878 --> 01:30:44,380
I'm afraid if they
come looking for you,
they might find me.

1381
01:30:44,881 --> 01:30:47,300
.
I'm sorry,
but you have to go

1382
01:30:53,690 --> 01:30:55,191
I'm gonna come back for you.

1383
01:30:55,191 --> 01:30:58,611
I won't be here.
I move during the day.
New places every night.

1384
01:30:58,611 --> 01:31:00,613
But I could come get you,
get you off this island.

1385
01:31:01,114 --> 01:31:03,616
Haven't you heard
a word I've said?

1386
01:31:03,616 --> 01:31:07,620
The only way off
the island is the ferry,
and they control it.

1387
01:31:08,121 --> 01:31:09,989
You'll never leave here.

1388
01:31:19,499 --> 01:31:21,000
I had a friend.

1389
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,503
I was with him yesterday,
but we got separated.

1390
01:31:25,004 --> 01:31:26,506
Have you seen him?

1391
01:31:27,507 --> 01:31:29,008
Marshal,

1392
01:31:30,510 --> 01:31:32,512
you have no friends.

1393
01:31:36,816 --> 01:31:38,818
(GRUNTING)

1394
01:32:04,844 --> 01:32:06,345
There you are.

1395
01:32:09,549 --> 01:32:12,051
We were wondering
when you'd show up.

1396
01:32:13,553 --> 01:32:15,221
Have a seat.

1397
01:32:15,722 --> 01:32:16,723
Come on.

1398
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:30,069
Taking a leisurely stroll,
were we?

1399
01:32:31,070 --> 01:32:34,073
I was just looking around.

1400
01:32:37,076 --> 01:32:39,829
Did you enjoy
God's latest gift?

1401
01:32:41,130 --> 01:32:42,632
What?
God's gift.

1402
01:32:45,001 --> 01:32:46,219
The violence.

1403
01:32:49,172 --> 01:32:51,174
When I came downstairs
in my home

1404
01:32:51,174 --> 01:32:53,176
and I saw that tree in my living room,

1405
01:32:53,676 --> 01:32:57,180
it reached out for me
like a divine hand.

1406
01:32:59,682 --> 01:33:01,184
.
God loves violence

1407
01:33:04,153 --> 01:33:05,905
I hadn't noticed.

1408
01:33:05,905 --> 01:33:07,774
(CHUCKLES) Sure you have.

1409
01:33:08,274 --> 01:33:10,276
?
Why else would
there be so much of it

1410
01:33:10,777 --> 01:33:12,278
It's in us.

1411
01:33:12,278 --> 01:33:13,663
It's what we are.

1412
01:33:15,164 --> 01:33:17,667
,
We wage war,
we burn sacrifices

1413
01:33:17,667 --> 01:33:20,036
and pillage and plunder and tear 
at the flesh of our brothers.

1414
01:33:20,036 --> 01:33:23,122
And why? Because God
gave us violence

1415
01:33:23,122 --> 01:33:24,123
to wage in his honor.

1416
01:33:27,593 --> 01:33:29,929
I thought God
gave us moral order.

1417
01:33:29,929 --> 01:33:33,299
There's no moral order
as pure as this storm.

1418
01:33:33,299 --> 01:33:35,802
.
There's no
moral order at all

1419
01:33:36,302 --> 01:33:39,806
There's just this,
can my violence
conquer yours?

1420
01:33:45,194 --> 01:33:46,028
I'm not violent.

1421
01:33:46,479 --> 01:33:47,480
Yes, you are.

1422
01:33:48,981 --> 01:33:51,984
You're as violent
as they come.

1423
01:33:51,984 --> 01:33:55,488
I know this because I'm as violent
as they come.

1424
01:33:55,488 --> 01:33:57,990
If the constraints of

between you and a meal,

Oh, extremely.
He can be quite upsetting.

I don't doubt it,

1581
01:47:35,974 --> 01:47:37,476
.
considering she's not real

1582
01:47:39,895 --> 01:47:42,898
Your delusions
are more severe
than I thought.

1583
01:47:44,399 --> 01:47:46,902
.
You're not on neuroleptics

1584
01:47:46,902 --> 01:47:48,403
You're not on anything
, as a matter of fact.

1585
01:47:48,904 --> 01:47:50,038
Then what
the fuck is this?

1586
01:47:50,038 --> 01:47:51,289
Huh? What the fuck is this?

1587
01:47:51,573 --> 01:47:52,324
Withdrawal.

1588
01:47:53,208 --> 01:47:55,210
Withdrawal? From what?

1589
01:47:55,711 --> 01:47:56,712
I haven't had
a goddamn drink

1590
01:47:56,712 --> 01:47:57,879
since I've been
on this island.

1591
01:47:57,879 --> 01:48:00,382
Chlorpromazine.

1592
01:48:00,382 --> 01:48:01,883
I'm not a fan
of pharmacology,

1593
01:48:01,883 --> 01:48:03,885
but I have to say,
in your case...

1594
01:48:03,885 --> 01:48:05,420
(STAMMERING)
Chloraproma-what?

1595
01:48:05,921 --> 01:48:07,556
Chlorpromazine.

1596
01:48:07,556 --> 01:48:11,560
.
The same thing
we've been giving you
for the past 24 months

1597
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:14,930
Oh, so for the past
two years, you...

1598
01:48:14,930 --> 01:48:18,433
You've had somebody
slipping me drugs in Boston.
Is that it?

1599
01:48:18,433 --> 01:48:19,985
Not Boston.

1600
01:48:20,485 --> 01:48:21,987
Here.

1601
01:48:22,487 --> 01:48:24,489
You've been here
for two years.

1602
01:48:24,489 --> 01:48:26,358
A patient of
this institution.

1603
01:48:29,861 --> 01:48:32,364
After everything
I've seen here, Doctor,

1604
01:48:33,865 --> 01:48:37,369
you really think
you're gonna convince me
I'm crazy, huh?

1605
01:48:37,369 --> 01:48:39,371
Do you know
the kind of people that
I deal with every day?

1606
01:48:39,371 --> 01:48:41,373
I'm a U.S. Marshal,
for God's sakes.

1607
01:48:41,373 --> 01:48:43,125
You were a U.S. Marshal.

1608
01:48:43,125 --> 01:48:47,262
Here's a copy of
the intake form
you broke into Ward C for.

1609
01:48:47,262 --> 01:48:48,547
Proof of the 67th patient.

1610
01:48:48,547 --> 01:48:49,681
If you'd gotten it
to the mainland,

1611
01:48:50,182 --> 01:48:51,550
you could have
blown the lid
off this place.

1612
01:48:51,550 --> 01:48:52,934
Wait. Where did...
Where did you...
Yet somehow,

1613
01:48:52,934 --> 01:48:55,937
you couldn't find
time to look at it.
Well, read it now.

1614
01:48:57,139 --> 01:48:58,140
Go ahead.

1615
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:03,361
"Patient is

I've had enough
of this bullshit!

Where's my partner, huh?

1626
01:49:24,466 --> 01:49:26,668
Where's Chuck?
Where is he?

1627
01:49:26,668 --> 01:49:28,170
.
Let's try this another way

1628
01:49:28,670 --> 01:49:31,089
Your wife's
maiden name was Chanal
, am I correct?

1629
01:49:31,089 --> 01:49:32,390
Don't you even
talk about her.
Don't you...

1630
01:49:32,724 --> 01:49:34,476
I'm afraid I have to.

1631
01:49:36,261 --> 01:49:38,764
Notice anything
these four names
have in common?

1632
01:49:38,764 --> 01:49:40,766
It's your rule of four.

1633
01:49:40,766 --> 01:49:41,767
Andrew, what do you see?

1634
01:49:42,267 --> 01:49:43,852
If you've done anything
to my partner, Doctor,

1635
01:49:43,852 --> 01:49:44,853
that is a violation of...

1636
01:49:45,270 --> 01:49:47,272
Focus, Andrew!
What do you see?

1637
01:49:48,774 --> 01:49:51,993
The names have
the same letters.

1638
01:49:51,993 --> 01:49:55,363
Edward Daniels has exactly
the same 13 letters
as Andrew Laeddis.

1639
01:49:55,363 --> 01:49:57,866
The same as
Rachel Solando
and Dolores Chanal.

1640
01:49:57,866 --> 01:49:59,868
The names are anagrams
for each other.

1641
01:49:59,868 --> 01:50:02,454
Your tactics,
they're not gonna
work on me.

1642
01:50:02,454 --> 01:50:05,290
You came here
for the truth.
Here it is.

1643
01:50:05,290 --> 01:50:07,292
Your name is
Andrew Laeddis.

1644
01:50:07,292 --> 01:50:11,096
The 67th patient
at Ashecliffe
is you, Andrew.

1645
01:50:13,014 --> 01:50:14,266
Bullshit.

1646
01:50:14,266 --> 01:50:16,051
You were committed
here by court order
24 months ago.

1647
01:50:16,051 --> 01:50:19,554
Your crime is terrible,
one you can't forgive
yourself for,

1648
01:50:19,554 --> 01:50:22,057
so you invented
another self.

1649
01:50:22,357 --> 01:50:24,226
(BREATHING TREMULOUSLY)

1650
01:50:24,226 --> 01:50:26,228
All right.

1651
01:50:26,228 --> 01:50:28,730
(STAMMERING) Let's get down
to the facts, all right?

1652
01:50:28,730 --> 01:50:31,817
You've created a story
in which you're not
a murderer.

1653
01:50:31,817 --> 01:50:33,819
You're a hero,
still a U.S. Marshal,

1654
01:50:33,819 --> 01:50:35,954
only here at Ashecliffe because of a case,

1655
01:50:35,954 --> 01:50:37,539
and you've uncovered
a conspiracy

1656
01:50:37,539 --> 01:50:39,324
so that anything
we tell you

1657
01:50:39,324 --> 01:50:41,293
about who you are,
what you've done,

1658
01:50:41,293 --> 01:50:43,161
you can dismiss
as lies, Andrew.

1659
01:50:43,161 --> 01:50:44,663
My name is Edward Daniels.

1660
01:50:44,963 --> 01:50:47,249
I've been
hearing this fantasy
for two years now.

1661
01:50:47,249 --> 01:50:48,633
I know every detail.

1662
01:50:49,134 --> 01:50:50,919
Patient 67, the storm,

1663
01:50:51,219 --> 01:50:52,888
Rachel Solando,
your missing partner,

1664
01:50:52,888 --> 01:50:54,389
the dreams
you have every night.

1665
01:50:54,389 --> 01:50:56,725
You were at Dachau,
but you may not have
killed any guards.

1666
01:50:58,677 --> 01:51:00,679
(SIGHS)

1667
01:51:00,679 --> 01:51:04,683
I wish I could
let you just live in
your fantasy world.

1668
01:51:04,683 --> 01:51:06,601
I really do.

1669
01:51:07,102 --> 01:51:08,987
.
But you're violent
, trained, dangerous

1670
01:51:08,987 --> 01:51:11,489
You're the most
dangerous patient
we have.

1671
01:51:11,489 --> 01:51:13,992
You've injured
orderlies, guards,
other patients.

1672
01:51:13,992 --> 01:51:15,994
Two weeks ago,
you attacked
George Noyce.

1673
01:51:15,994 --> 01:51:17,996
No, no. I am fucking
on to you, Doctor.

1674
01:51:18,446 --> 01:51:20,198
!
You had Noyce beaten.
Of course I didn't

1675
01:51:20,198 --> 01:51:22,033
Give me one reason
why I would even touch him!

1676
01:51:22,534 --> 01:51:25,036
,
Because he
called you Laeddis

1677
01:51:25,036 --> 01:51:28,039
and you'd do anything
not to be him.

1678
01:51:28,039 --> 01:51:30,041
I have a transcript of the conversation

1679
01:51:30,041 --> 01:51:31,543
you had with
Noyce yesterday.

1680
01:51:31,543 --> 01:51:34,045
"This is about you
, and, Laeddis,

1681
01:51:34,045 --> 01:51:35,547
"that's all it's ever
been about."

1682
01:51:37,716 --> 01:51:40,018
No, no.
He's saying this is
about me and Laeddis.

1683
01:51:40,018 --> 01:51:41,937
When you asked him
what happened to his face,

1684
01:51:42,437 --> 01:51:45,440
he said, now here
I'm quoting again,
"You did this."

1685
01:51:45,941 --> 01:51:47,893
No, no, he meant
that it was my fault.

1686
01:51:47,893 --> 01:51:50,111
You almost killed him.

1687
01:51:51,613 --> 01:51:53,114
The warden and
the Board of Overseers

1688
01:51:53,114 --> 01:51:54,115
are determined
something be done.

1689
01:51:54,616 --> 01:51:56,318
It's been decided

1690
01:51:56,318 --> 01:51:59,237
,
that unless
we can bring you
back to sanity now

1691
01:51:59,237 --> 01:52:00,739
right now,

1692
01:52:00,739 --> 01:52:02,240
permanent measures
will be taken

1693
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:04,242
.
to ensure you can't
hurt anyone ever again

1694
01:52:07,879 --> 01:52:11,383
They'll
lobotomize you, Andrew
. Do you understand?

1695
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:17,222
Yeah, I understand.

1696
01:52:18,223 --> 01:52:20,759
I understand just fine.

1697
01:52:21,259 --> 01:52:25,313
If I don't play along
with your little game here,

1698
01:52:25,313 --> 01:52:28,767
Dr. Naehring's
gonna turn me into
one of his ghosts.

1699
01:52:28,767 --> 01:52:30,268
But what about my partner?

1700
01:52:30,268 --> 01:52:32,437
You gonna tell
the U.S. Marshal's office

1701
01:52:32,437 --> 01:52:34,439
that he's a defense mechanism?

1702
01:52:36,441 --> 01:52:37,943
Hello, boss.

1703
01:52:54,843 --> 01:52:57,846
(SOFTLY) What the fuck
is going on here? Hmm?

1704
01:52:59,347 --> 01:53:00,348
Huh?

1705
01:53:00,849 --> 01:53:05,053
You working for him?

1706
01:53:05,053 --> 01:53:06,554
I'm sorry.
There wasn't
any other way.

1707
01:53:06,554 --> 01:53:09,441
Someone had to
stick with you,
keep you safe.

1708
01:53:12,394 --> 01:53:14,396
You been watching me, huh?

1709
01:53:15,397 --> 01:53:17,399
Watching me every minute.

1710
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:19,901
Who are you?

1711
01:53:20,402 --> 01:53:21,903
Who are you? Tell me.

1712
01:53:22,404 --> 01:53:25,457
Don't you
recognize me, Andrew?

1713
01:53:25,824 --> 01:53:29,828
I've been
your primary psychiatrist
for the last two years.

1714
01:53:29,828 --> 01:53:31,830
.
I'm Lester Sheehan

1715
01:53:38,253 --> 01:53:40,088
I told you... I told
you about my wife, I...

1716
01:53:40,088 --> 01:53:41,556
I know.

1717
01:53:41,556 --> 01:53:44,309
I climbed down
a cliff to get you.
I trusted you.

1718
01:53:44,309 --> 01:53:48,096
I risked everything
to come in here after you.
Everything!

1719
01:53:48,096 --> 01:53:49,347
I know, boss.

1720
01:53:49,347 --> 01:53:52,484
We're running out
of time here, Andrew.

1721
01:53:52,484 --> 01:53:54,235
I swore before
the Board of Overseers

1722
01:53:54,235 --> 01:53:58,239
that I could construct
the most radical,
cutting-edge role-play

1723
01:53:58,239 --> 01:54:00,492
ever attempted in psychiatry,
and it would bring you back.

1724
01:54:00,492 --> 01:54:03,361
I thought that if we
let you play this out

1725
01:54:03,361 --> 01:54:07,248
we could get you
to see how untrue,
how impossible it is.

1726
01:54:08,249 --> 01:54:10,752
You've had the run
of the place for two days.

1727
01:54:11,119 --> 01:54:14,039
Tell me, where are
the Nazi experiments?

1728
01:54:14,039 --> 01:54:16,041
The satanic ORs?

1729
01:54:29,687 --> 01:54:33,391
Andrew, listen to me.

1730
01:54:33,892 --> 01:54:36,394
If we fail with you,

1731
01:54:36,394 --> 01:54:37,896
then everything that
we've tried to do here

1732
01:54:37,896 --> 01:54:40,198
will be discredited.
Everything.

1733
01:54:42,067 --> 01:54:46,037
We're on the front lines
of a war here, old boy.

1734
01:54:46,037 --> 01:54:49,040
And right now,
it all comes down to you.

1735
01:54:55,713 --> 01:54:57,165
Don't move! Don't move!

1736
01:54:57,165 --> 01:54:58,550
Andrew! Andrew! No. No.

1737
01:54:58,917 --> 01:55:01,920
(ENUNCIATING) My name
is Edward Daniels!

1738
01:55:02,303 --> 01:55:04,255
This one's loaded.
I can tell by the weight.

1739
01:55:04,255 --> 01:55:06,925
I see. And that's
your firearm, Marshal?
You're sure?

1740
01:55:06,925 --> 01:55:08,426
My initials are on the side.

1741
01:55:08,426 --> 01:55:10,428
There's a dent in the barrel
from when Philip Stacks
shot at me.

1742
01:55:10,428 --> 01:55:12,931
You're not gonna
fuck with my mind
on this one, Doctor!

1743
01:55:12,931 --> 01:55:14,182
CAWLEY: Then blast away.

1744
01:55:14,682 --> 01:55:17,018
Because that's
the only way you're ever
getting off this island.

1745
01:55:23,324 --> 01:55:25,193
Andrew, please don't.

1746
01:55:36,337 --> 01:55:37,338
My gun.

1747
01:55:43,845 --> 01:55:46,848
What did you do
to my goddamn gun?

1748
01:55:46,848 --> 01:55:49,134
It's a toy, Andrew.

1749
01:55:51,636 --> 01:55:54,105
We're telling you the truth.

1750
01:55:54,105 --> 01:55:58,193
.
Dolores was insane,
manic-depressive, suicidal

1751
01:55:58,193 --> 01:56:01,279
You drank, stayed away
, ignored what everyone
told you.

1752
01:56:01,279 --> 01:56:02,697
You moved to that lake house

1753
01:56:02,697 --> 01:56:05,900
.
after she
purposely set your
city apartment on fire

1754
01:56:05,900 --> 01:56:06,951
You were...
(SCREAMING) You're lying!

1755
01:56:06,951 --> 01:56:08,453
Andrew!
Andrew, stop. No.

1756
01:56:08,453 --> 01:56:10,455
You drugged
the cigarettes!

1757
01:56:10,455 --> 01:56:12,323
All you've done is lie!
Andrew. Andrew.

1758
01:56:12,790 --> 01:56:15,994
Your children.
Andrew, your children.

1759
01:56:15,994 --> 01:56:18,913
Simon. Henry.

1760
01:56:18,913 --> 01:56:20,298
I never had any children.

1761
01:56:20,298 --> 01:56:24,252
Your wife drowned them
at the cabin by the lake.

1762
01:56:24,252 --> 01:56:27,639
And here,
the little girl,
the one you dream of

1763
01:56:28,139 --> 01:56:30,141
every night.

1764
01:56:30,141 --> 01:56:31,142
I never had a little girl.

1765
01:56:31,142 --> 01:56:32,894
The one who tells
you over and over

1766
01:56:32,894 --> 01:56:35,180
that you should have saved her

1767
01:56:35,180 --> 01:56:37,182
.
saved them all

1768
01:56:37,182 --> 01:56:39,684
Your daughter,
her name was Rachel.

1769
01:56:39,684 --> 01:56:42,687
Are you going to deny
that she ever lived?

1770
01:56:43,238 --> 01:56:44,739
Andrew, are you?

1771
01:57:08,012 --> 01:57:10,014
DOLORES: (WHIMPERING)
I'm so sorry, baby.

1772
01:57:14,385 --> 01:57:17,188
I told you not
to come in here.

1773
01:57:17,188 --> 01:57:21,226
I told you this
would be the end of you.

1774
01:57:41,546 --> 01:57:43,548
I'm back!

1775
01:57:43,548 --> 01:57:46,050
We got him just
outside of Oklahoma.

1776
01:57:46,551 --> 01:57:48,720
Must've stopped 10 places
in between here and Tulsa.

1777
01:57:49,220 --> 01:57:51,222
I could sleep for a week.

(BLUES MUSIC PLAYING)

1779
01:57:55,226 --> 01:57:56,227
Dolores?

1780
01:58:03,234 --> 01:58:04,736
Dolores?

1781
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:11,743
PREACHER: And he said,
"Take up your bed and walk."

Dolores?

PREACHER: Then he said,
"Take up your bed and walk."

01:58:57,238 --> 01:58:59,240
why are you all wet?

1788
01:59:01,242 --> 01:59:02,744
I missed you.

1789
01:59:10,251 --> 01:59:12,253
I wanna go home.

1790
01:59:15,256 --> 01:59:16,758
You are home.

Hmm?

They're in school.

It's Saturday, honey.

on Saturday.

Let's put them
at the table, Andrew.

We'll dry them off.
We'll change their clothes.

.
Rachel. Rachel Laeddis

1835
02:04:12,970 --> 02:04:14,972
My daughter.

1836
02:04:18,693 --> 02:04:20,111
Why are you here?

1837
02:04:23,614 --> 02:04:25,116
Because I killed my wife.

1838
02:04:25,366 --> 02:04:27,368
And why did you do that?

1839
02:04:30,871 --> 02:04:33,874
Because she murdered
our children,

1840
02:04:36,877 --> 02:04:38,379
and she told me
to let her go.

1841

Who's Teddy Daniels?

1842
02:04:44,385 --> 02:04:45,670
He doesn't exist.

1843
02:04:48,089 --> 02:04:50,591
Neither does Rachel Solando.
I made them up.

1844
02:04:50,591 --> 02:04:52,810
Why?

1845
02:04:52,810 --> 02:04:55,312
We need to
hear you say it.

1846
02:05:01,018 --> 02:05:04,021
After she tried
to kill herself
the first time,

1847
02:05:06,524 --> 02:05:09,026
Dolores told me she...

1848
02:05:09,026 --> 02:05:13,531
She had an insect
living inside her brain.

1849
02:05:15,533 --> 02:05:20,037
She could feel it
clicking across her skull,

1850
02:05:20,037 --> 02:05:24,542
just pulling the wires
just for fun.

1851
02:05:28,045 --> 02:05:30,047
She told me that.

1852
02:05:31,549 --> 02:05:34,051
She told me that,
but I didn't listen.

1853
02:05:38,055 --> 02:05:40,307
I loved her so much,
you know.

1854
02:05:41,609 --> 02:05:43,110
Why did you
make them up?

1855
02:05:46,147 --> 02:05:49,650
Because I can't take
knowing that Dolores
killed our children.

1856
02:05:53,654 --> 02:05:55,156
And I...

1857
02:05:57,658 --> 02:06:02,163
I killed them 'cause
I didn't get her help,
you know.

1858
02:06:06,167 --> 02:06:07,668
I killed them.

1859
02:06:12,807 --> 02:06:13,808
.
Here's my fear, Andrew

1860
02:06:13,808 --> 02:06:17,311
We broke through
once before,
nine months ago,

1861

.
and then you regressed

I don't remember that.

1863
02:06:23,484 --> 02:06:24,485
.
I know

1864
02:06:25,486 --> 02:06:27,822
You reset, Andrew.

1865
02:06:27,822 --> 02:06:32,827
Like a tape
playing over and over
on an endless loop.

1866
02:06:33,327 --> 02:06:34,829
I hope that
what we've done here
will be enough

1867
02:06:34,829 --> 02:06:37,832
to stop it from
ever happening again,

1868
02:06:37,832 --> 02:06:41,335
but I need to know
you've accepted reality.

1869
02:06:47,925 --> 02:06:50,427
You came after me,
huh, Doctor?

1870
02:06:52,429 --> 02:06:56,433
You tried to help me
when no one else would.

1871
02:07:07,978 --> 02:07:10,981
My name's Andrew Laeddis,

1872
02:07:17,988 --> 02:07:21,492
and I murdered my wife
in the spring of '52.

1873
02:07:46,567 --> 02:07:48,068
How we doing this morning?

1874
02:07:49,069 --> 02:07:50,571
Good. And you?

1875
02:07:51,572 --> 02:07:52,573
.
Can't complain

1876
02:08:02,583 --> 02:08:04,084
So what's our next move?

1877
02:08:05,586 --> 02:08:06,587
You tell me.

1878
02:08:12,092 --> 02:08:13,594
We gotta get off
this rock, Chuck.

1879
02:08:15,095 --> 02:08:16,597
Get back to the mainland.

1880
02:08:16,597 --> 02:08:19,350
Whatever the hell's
going on here, it's bad.

Don't worry, partner,
they're not gonna catch us.

1883
02:08:50,130 --> 02:08:52,633
That's right.
We're too smart for them.

1884
02:08:54,134 --> 02:08:56,136
Yeah, we are, aren't we?

1885
02:09:11,735 --> 02:09:14,738
You know, this place
makes me wonder...

1886
02:09:15,239 --> 02:09:17,241
Yeah, what's that, boss?

1887
02:09:18,242 --> 02:09:20,244
Which would be worse,

1888
02:09:20,744 --> 02:09:22,746
to live as a monster
