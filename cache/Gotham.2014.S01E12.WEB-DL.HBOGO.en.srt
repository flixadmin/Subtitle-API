1
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,120
No. Oh, no, no.

2
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,920
The merchandise has gotta be mint
or you won't get a dime.

3
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,520
My God.

4
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,320
Jack.

5
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,840
Hi, Irwin.

6
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,800
Where's my stuff?

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,680
Aaron Danzig, 6'4", 225, mental age
of a young child.

8
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,440
We believe he's under the control
of this man.

9
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,280
Jack Gruber.

10
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,440
In Arkham off a rape-murder beef.

11
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,000
We can't find any records on Gruber
prior to his incarceration.

12
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,960
So we're guessing Gruber is an alias.

13
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,440
We're sending his prints nationwide,

14
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,680
see if we can find another name
for him.

15
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:46,800
Whoever he is, he's clever and angry
and a grave public menace.

16
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,360
The commissioner is deeply concerned
and he is on his way here

17
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,880
to talk to all of you right now.

18
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,400
You know what that means
and you know...

19
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,200
Jim?

20
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,440
- Captain.
- Hey, partner.

21
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,200
- Hi.
- You're out of your jurisdiction.

22
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,400
- Captain, this is my case.
- Jim.

23
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,960
- You need to get out of here.
- It's my case.

24
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,480
No, no, no. The captain is right.

25
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,120
You need to leave
before the commissioner gets here.

26
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Why?

27
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,280
Because he holds you responsible
for all of this and... Oh, fudge.

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,840
He's here.
And you're there. Side step.

29
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,560
- Captain Essen.
- Good morning, Commissioner.

30
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,080
Officer Gordon, isn't it?

31
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,920
Yes, sir.

32
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,280
- Why are you here?
- I have a better question.

33
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,960
Why are you here, commissioner?

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,800
- Excuse me?
- This is the first I've seen

35
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,440
you down here with the rank and file.

36
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,800
You must be desperate.

37
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,440
Follow me.

38
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,200
Really nice knowing you.

39
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,400
Bring your friend, bullock.

40
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,440
I hate you.

41
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,920
I hate you.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,480
It wasn't my idea,
it was your friend.

43
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,920
He came up with the double-cross,
made me go along.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,160
You have a mind of your own,
don't you?

45
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,320
Hey, come on.

46
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,800
See?

47
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,520
I kept your gadgets safe.

48
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,200
I know what it means to you.

49
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,640
All of your experiments.

50
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,240
Oh, I appreciate that.

51
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,800
Please.

52
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,920
You don't have to kill me.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,720
I don't...

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,040
...have to do anything.

55
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,760
I'm free.

56
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,880
You know the funny thing?

57
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,000
I think it was my time in Arkham
that freed me.

58
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,000
I mean, in here.

59
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,200
Now I see the world
for what it really is.

60
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,800
An abandoned factory full
of broken machines.

61
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,520
Some very few...

62
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,920
can be fixed.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Most...

64
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,120
just have to be scrapped.

65
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,200
Danzig, hold him, please.

66
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,920
Please.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,040
Please. No, stop, please.

68
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,640
Please.

69
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,800
Two maniacs on the loose

70
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,800
makes the whole Arkham project
look kind of shady, huh?

71
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,680
The moneymen want results fast,
I bet.

72
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,080
You're strangely self-righteous,
given that it was you

73
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
that let these men escape.

74
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,640
Blame me all you want.
My name is already mud.

75
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,080
Those two will still be out there.

76
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,200
And that means you need me.

77
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,840
James.

78
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,680
Why did you become a policeman?

79
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,960
Your father
was the district attorney.

80
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,760
A proud station
for a man of substance

81
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,800
you would think that would inspire
a son to practice law.

82
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,320
I'm enforcing the law.

83
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,640
You wanna talk about my dad

84
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,200
or do you wanna catch
Gruber and Danzig?

85
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,880
Where do you get that rebellious fire
in your belly?

86
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,400
Can I take this opportunity to say

87
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,960
that I have no rebellious fire
here, nada.

88
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,720
Jack Gruber is out there.

89
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,360
Planning a catastrophe.

90
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,200
I know the man.

91
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,400
I know how he thinks.

92
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,840
I know what he'll do next.

93
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,520
Which is what?

94
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,080
That I'll keep to myself.

95
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,200
I guarantee I'll bring
in these two men.

96
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,720
But first I need you to reinstate me

97
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,320
as detective first grade in the GCPD.

98
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,280
Extortion, Officer Gordon.

99
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,720
- Twenty-four hours?
- What?

100
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,080
You've got 24 hours
to bring these men in.

101
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,200
You don't, you can both spend

102
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,360
the rest of your miserable careers
down at Arkham.

103
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,960
That will be all, detectives.

104
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,680
- What the hell just happened?
- It's okay. It's okay.

105
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,160
- Everything's gonna be fine, Harvey.
- Yeah?

106
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,720
Yeah, we just gotta catch
the bad guys.

107
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,640
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.

108
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,560
What? You just told him you knew
what Gruber was gonna do next.

109
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,200
I lied.

110
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,960
Please.

111
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,240
Don Falcone.

112
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,960
Have mercy. We're family.

113
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,920
{\an5}I know, son.

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,840
I know it's hard.

115
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,160
A young man like you.

116
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,120
{\an5}Doesn't seem fair.

117
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,440
Please.

118
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,200
{\an5}Don Falcone, please!

119
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,360
{\an5}This whole area used to be slums
when I was a boy.

120
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,760
{\an5}You've come a long way.

121
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,360
{\an5}Some of your people
are looking for you, you know.

122
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,440
{\an5}But you're the one I wanted to see.

123
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,880
{\an5}I've worked so long all my life
to get where I am.

124
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,160
{\an5}So long I forget
why I wanted to be here.

125
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,560
{\an5}Well, you wanted to be someone
and you are.

126
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,360
{\an5}I mean, look at all the stuff
you have.

127
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,560
{\an5}You're a good girl, Liza.

128
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,960
{\an5}You need to find a young man
and get married, have babies.

129
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,600
{\an5}It's not fair of me
keeping you cooped up here

130
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,120
{\an5}doing my house work.

131
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,080
You'll never find
a good husband here.

132
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,040
Anyhow, if you'd like to get out
in the world, I was thinking

133
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:00,520
{\an5}I could set you up with a bakery
or some type of business like that.

134
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,040
{\an5}So you can be independent.

135
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,840
{\an5}That's really nice, Mr. F. Thank you.

136
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,920
{\an5}But I would rather be here with you.

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,360
- You would?
- I like it here.

138
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,560
{\an5}You make me feel safe.

139
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,960
{\an5}Well, good.

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,320
I like having you here.

141
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,360
{\an5}Maybe I'll try to get a little
work done before dinner.

142
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,240
{\an5}Making something special tonight.

143
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,120
What are you laughing at?

144
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,600
It's good to be back.

145
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,120
Only a man from a lunatic asylum
would say that.

146
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,040
You're like a human roller coaster
except you only go down.

147
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,760
Wouldn't that make him
more of an elevator?

148
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
You have anything useful, Ed?

149
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,600
I got a little less than 20 hours
before I lose my job.

150
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,400
I do have something useful.

151
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,320
- And it is?
- I cross-checked fingerprints.

152
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,280
The clinically insane Jack Gruber
of Arkham,

153
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,400
is a figment of the files.

154
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,280
The man himself
is really a career criminal

155
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,440
by the name of Jack Buchinsky.

156
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,960
How is that even possible?

157
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,680
Easy enough to bribe someone
to change the records.

158
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,640
Yep, apparently, he wanted
to be transferred to Arkham.

159
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,880
That's really good work, Ed.

160
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,320
What's this Buttinsky's deal?

161
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,800
It's... Buchinsky.

162
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,280
It's all in the files.

163
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,560
Just make sure you sign it out.

164
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,520
It's classified information,
so just be careful.

165
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,920
Miss Kringle?

166
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,680
I believe you left this on my desk.

167
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,840
It's a riddle.

168
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,840
It's a cupcake with a live bullet
sticking out of it.

169
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,640
It's a riddle.

170
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,240
It's menacing and weird and inedible.

171
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,680
Thank you for the files,
Miss Kringle.

172
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,040
This Buchinsky dude and his partners

173
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,440
pulled four successful
bank robberies,

174
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,760
killed six along the way before
the GCPD caught him by accident.

175
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,160
He never named his accomplices.

176
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,800
He's in prison, he hears Arkham
is opening its doors,

177
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,760
so he uses his connections,
and he gets himself a new identity

178
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,840
as the mental patient Gruber.

179
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,320
He must have some good connections.

180
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,760
Right, and when the rest of the nuts
get transferred to Arkham viola.

181
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,840
So he had partners, huh?

182
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,840
Yeah, GCPD never identified them.
They're still out there.

183
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,200
Yep, we find them, we'll find him.

184
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,680
Easy enough, huh?

185
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,880
Detective.

186
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,840
A hit.

187
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
What do we got?

188
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,000
Lead detectives dusted for prints,
two sets...

189
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,960
Gruber and Danzig,
just like we thought.

190
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,200
- Right. Thanks.
- All right.

191
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,600
Van checks out.

192
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,800
It was them.

193
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,160
Our man's an electronics freak,
right?

194
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,280
Yeah.

195
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,560
Think he went shopping?

196
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,680
He's dead.

197
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,400
Fried like a doughnut.

198
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,240
GCPD.

199
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,440
Turn around slowly,
let me see those hands.

200
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,960
Hey.

201
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,440
Hey, buddy.

202
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,720
Hey.

203
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,840
Hey!

204
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,760
Help!

205
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,520
- Help, help! Please!
- Get back in the store.

206
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,960
Okay. Take it easy. Okay.

207
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,720
Please, there's been
a terrible mistake.

208
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,200
I am Don Falcone's housekeeper.

209
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,560
Fish? Thank God.

210
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,120
Why'd you have to pull me out
like that?

211
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,200
You scared the life out of me.

212
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,200
It's time, Liza.

213
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,320
I'm gonna make my move on Falcone.

214
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,720
And don't be scared, baby girl.

215
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,040
I got this.

216
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,120
<i>Mr. Falcone, we have your girl, Liza.</i>

217
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,000
<i>Would you like to see her again?</i>

218
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,600
Yes, I would.

219
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,480
<i>She'll be glad to hear that.</i>

220
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,760
For a fit young woman,
she has a low pain threshold.

221
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,760
Please! No! Stop!

222
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,400
<i>An intermediary will be in contact
with you soon.</i>

223
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,560
Don't hurt her.

224
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,800
She's a civilian.

225
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,920
Hello?

226
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
What now?

227
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,360
Now we let him sit
and think about his life for a while.

228
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,160
"The Electrocutioner."

229
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,480
Cute.

230
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,280
- No pressure.
- Don't worry, we'll get him.

231
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,320
Yeah, and we got 17 hours to do so.

232
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,920
I love the name.
It's catchy, has drama.

233
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,120
The Electro-cutioner.

234
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,280
Speaking of which,
given the general mode of attack,

235
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,160
may I suggest you both wear your

236
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,040
department-issue galoshes
while you're out in the field.

237
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,160
Galoshes?

238
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,560
In the event
of electrical misadventure,

239
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,680
your footwear should be insulated.

240
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,200
No, Mom! I'm not gonna wear
my rubbers on the case.

241
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,680
Nygma, give them here.

242
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,040
Seriously?

243
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,400
All right, so what do we know?

244
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,240
Gruber wasn't too happy with Irwin.

245
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,680
Maybe they were partners in crime,
Irwin turned on him,

246
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,800
Gruber took the fall.

247
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,960
Detective Gordon.

248
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,520
- Dr. Thompkins.
- My friends call me Lee.

249
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,320
Congratulations,
you got your job back.

250
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,960
Or not, depending.

251
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,000
- It's good to see you.
- Is it?

252
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,480
I, I know you're caught up
with the escape.

253
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,960
- That's why I'm here.
- Is everything okay?

254
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,680
Must be chaos down there.

255
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,080
We're getting by just fine.
Thanks for asking.

256
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,360
Oh, right, this is my partner,
Harvey Bullock.

257
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
Hola.

258
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,040
Detective Bullock.

259
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,480
Who's your little friend there?

260
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,080
Oh, this is why I'm here.

261
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,480
One of the women in my wing
is a pagan sorceress.

262
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,680
- Of course.
- She's very popular.

263
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,520
The inmates make dolls
to look like people

264
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,640
that they want to curse.

265
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,560
And then they give it
to the sorceress to curse them.

266
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,480
In exchange for extra soda and candy.

267
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,440
I curse you all the time.
You never give me candy.

268
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,800
I asked her if Gruber had ever given
her a doll to curse and she said yes.

269
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,880
This is the doll.

270
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,560
His name is Mr. M.

271
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,560
You owe me for a double six-pack
of root beer.

272
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,920
-Mr. M?
-Mr. M.

273
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,240
Mr. M.

274
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,320
Who does this look like to you?

275
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,000
I tell this guy, I said, Maurice

276
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,680
we've pulled out half
your freaking teeth.

277
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,880
What the hell are you waiting for?

278
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,520
- The tooth fairy?
- Right?

279
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,560
So, what he does
you know what Maurice does?

280
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,680
He smiles at me.

281
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,040
So I say, I'm gonna take out
another one, man.

282
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,400
I go to his molar.

283
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,680
I got to get Mario
and Gabe to help me pull it out.

284
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,080
Do excuse me.

285
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,720
Right. So we're, like, pulling it,
we're pulling it, right?

286
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,040
And finally, we get it out.

287
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,160
The thing is this big...

288
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,640
- Yes.
<i>- Come see me.</i>

289
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,920
<i>I need you.</i>

290
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,040
I'm on my way.

291
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,600
<i>What's wrong?</i>

292
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,800
Somebody took Liza.

293
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,280
Come, quickly.

294
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,560
You sly devil.

295
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,000
You took her.

296
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,400
You're mine now.

297
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
So I'm trying to tell this guy,
"Let him talk."

298
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,480
Because now he's trying to talk
but now I don't understand him

299
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,640
'cause he's got no teeth, right?

300
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,800
So I'm saying, "Let him talk.

301
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,800
Clean him out.
He's gonna tell us something."

302
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,040
Don Maroni, sir, forgive me.

303
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,920
Such fun we're having.

304
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,880
But I regret that I must run away.

305
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,440
If you'll let me.

306
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,680
My mother is sick.

307
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,080
Well, a sick mother's a sick mother.

308
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,640
Go.

309
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,920
Hey.

310
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,360
Penguin, you all right?

311
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,200
Hey, kid, what are you...

312
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,440
What's going on here?

313
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,000
Get down!

314
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,440
I don't know what happened.
It was like a silent bomb.

315
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,000
You know who did this, right?

316
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,080
Who?

317
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,880
A few years ago, Jack Buchinsky

318
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,160
and partners unknown
knocked over four banks.

319
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,480
Killed six people.

320
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,880
Buchinsky went down for life.

321
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,720
His partners were never caught.

322
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,440
You're one of those partners.

323
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,600
The one that took his share
and sold him up the river, I expect.

324
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,000
What guy was this?

325
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,880
Who?

326
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
While he's out there
looking to hurt you,

327
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,040
he doesn't care who else he hurts.

328
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,840
Women, kids.

329
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,560
Hey. That's not my fault.

330
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,040
Help me do the right thing here,
Don Maroni.

331
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,840
Let me place you
in protective custody.

332
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,720
- Protective custody?
- Yes.

333
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,000
Bait, you mean.

334
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,720
We catch our bad guy,
you get rid of a dangerous nuisance.

335
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,960
We both come out ahead.

336
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,080
Excuse me.

337
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,720
Hello?

338
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,960
I must be going.

339
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,200
Very urgent business.

340
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,240
With Falcone.

341
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,960
All right, make yourself at home.

342
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,240
Hey, sweetheart.

343
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,760
Get me a double espresso.
Extra sugar.

344
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,840
Nah.

345
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,680
I'm Barbara.

346
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,680
Barbara Kean.

347
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,600
My parents, they live here.

348
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,960
It's very nice to see you, Barbara.

349
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,360
Isn't it, Everett?

350
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,920
Yes, very nice.

351
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,080
It's nice to see you, too.

352
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,680
You've been well, I hope?

353
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,480
Yes.

354
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,200
- And you?
- Splendid.

355
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,240
Are you staying the night?

356
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,760
If that's all right.

357
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,240
In fact...

358
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,120
I... I thought maybe
I could stay a few days.

359
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,720
If that's...

360
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,480
Oh, I see.

361
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,280
Yes, of course.

362
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,840
I'm sure you're going
to be frightfully bored.

363
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,960
But stay until the weekend.

364
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,200
By all means.

365
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,360
Thank you.

366
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,680
How's that young man of yours?

367
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,440
James?

368
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,520
The policeman?

369
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,800
All well, I hope?

370
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,360
Yes.

371
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,800
He's well, thank you.

372
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,160
Good.

373
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,400
We're very happy.

374
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,800
Very happy.

375
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,800
You guys are, like, hungry for this.

376
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,080
What do you do here for excitement?

377
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,040
Remember that joke
about the what is it?

378
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,760
The two cops and the undertaker
that go on a fishing boat.

379
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,040
When you use a tethered goat as bait,

380
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,080
shouldn't the goat be out
in the jungle and not in the house?

381
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,680
This house is the best defended
spot in Gotham.

382
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,000
Buchinsky is crazy
and arrogant and resourceful.

383
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,800
Wherever Maroni is,
he'll come after him.

384
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,560
He'll enjoy the challenge.

385
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,480
I can show you.

386
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,840
- Hey, there.
- Hi, boss.

387
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,880
- How long have I been unconscious?
- Couple of hours.

388
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,840
Oh, my gosh.

389
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,120
I must go.

390
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,280
My, my poor mother is...

391
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,240
Your mother can wait.

392
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,920
It's her heart.

393
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,440
Poor thing. Valves.

394
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,280
She might be taken at any moment.

395
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,720
But... but by all means,
of course, she can wait.

396
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,480
When you woke up before,
you said you had urgent business...

397
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,440
with Falcone.

398
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,920
I did?

399
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,600
I said that, did I?

400
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,520
<i>Carmine.</i>

401
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,280
Some people have called me
about your girl Liza.

402
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,600
They want me to help make a deal.

403
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,640
I didn't think
it was going to be you.

404
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,480
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

405
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,960
I'm just an intermediary.

406
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,520
<i>I just wanna help.</i>

407
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,240
Please, my dear, stop.

408
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
<i>I know this is you.</i>

409
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,680
<i>Be honest.</i>

410
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,440
- It's me.
<i>- Of course it is.</i>

411
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,200
How long have I known you?

412
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,720
You're the smart one in the family,
didn't I always say so?

413
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,080
She won't be hurt.

414
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,240
Leave Gotham, that's all.

415
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,280
Leave Gotham, never come back.

416
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,720
You can take her with you.

417
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,760
Agreed.

418
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,440
<i>That's the right decision.
I'll make the arrangements.</i>

419
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,200
You were always my favorite.

420
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,240
Wait for my call.

421
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,080
He's leaving?

422
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,360
You did it?

423
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,600
Boss.

424
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,800
The genius, the vision.

425
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,200
You brought down the old man.

426
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,520
Finally.

427
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,960
Let's celebrate.

428
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,720
Butch, this is not the time
to celebrate.

429
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,880
He was a great man once.

430
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,080
You don't think somebody
would take him out if he stayed on.

431
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:19,240
I am doing him a favor
and giving him an easy way out.

432
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,520
I owe him...

433
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,920
at least that.

434
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,600
Of course. You're right.

435
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,000
It's best for everyone.

436
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,760
How did he sound?

437
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,040
Sad.

438
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,440
Look at me.

439
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,920
Is there something
you're not telling me?

440
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
No.

441
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,160
You're gonna have to leave town
with him.

442
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,360
String him along for a while.
Do you think you can do that?

443
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,360
- Sure.
- Sure.

444
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,280
But you like him though, don't you?

445
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
Well, I can like him, can't I?

446
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,120
He's been a perfect gentleman.

447
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,360
He could've done anything...

448
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,800
and he never laid a hand on me.

449
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,960
Liza, you can like him all you want.

450
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,680
But you can never tell him the truth.

451
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,240
I know that.

452
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,840
Sir.

453
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,480
Let me go to work.

454
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,040
No.

455
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,800
No?

456
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,440
If Fish and the others...

457
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,120
and there must be others.

458
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,760
If they all want me to step away
so badly, maybe it's time.

459
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,080
Why not?

460
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,600
Why am I still here fighting?

461
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,040
For what?

462
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,000
For respect.

463
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,320
You're Don Carmine Falcone.

464
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,080
Respect?

465
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,480
Who cares?

466
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,360
They all want me to go live
in the country with Liza.

467
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,720
I would like that.

468
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,320
That's what I want too.

469
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,680
So why not do it?

470
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,200
Please, don't talk that way, sir.

471
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,760
Just me on my own...

472
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,240
I can take out Fish's crew easy.

473
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,720
You're not listening, Victor.

474
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:45,320
Your job is to keep me and Liza safe
through the coming transaction.

475
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,840
That's all.

476
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,400
Yes, sir.

477
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,000
- Miss Kringle.
- What? What?

478
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,280
The cupcake is sweet,
the bullet is deadly.

479
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,600
A beautiful woman
is a dangerous thing.

480
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,760
Listen, I...

481
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,560
That is so...

482
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,280
I don't, I don't even know
what to say to that.

483
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,240
Nygma, you perv, back off.

484
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,480
Can't you see the lady
doesn't want you bugging her?

485
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,920
I...

486
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,400
Hey, there.
Hey, now. Who's bugging who?

487
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,800
I'm just, I'm just...

488
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,600
What's green and then red?
Frogs in a blender.

489
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,040
Walk away, Nygma.

490
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,200
Walk away.

491
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,560
I'm very sorry if I offended you,
Miss Kringle.

492
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,200
That was not my intention.

493
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,400
- Do you hear that?
- Go.

494
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,520
Thank you.

495
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,720
He is so weird.

496
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,200
I have no business with Falcone.

497
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,320
I swear on my mother's life.

498
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,440
May God strike her dead
with horrible torments if I'm lying.

499
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,800
Okay, then, my friend.

500
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,280
I'm sorry I doubted you.

501
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,440
Go see your mom.

502
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,400
- Give her a kiss from me.
- Thank you.

503
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,480
What the hell's going on here?

504
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,960
- Hey, hey!
- What's going on?

505
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,720
There's the one.

506
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,000
Under that funny-looking fella there.

507
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,080
Take him to the truck.

508
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,240
They didn't cook, just stunned.

509
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,000
I expected more oomph.

510
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,840
You want oomph, Jack?

511
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,400
Officer Gordon.

512
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,080
Nice shoes.

513
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,840
Detective Gordon.

514
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,080
Hands up, both of you.

515
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,520
You might wanna drop that.

516
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,920
Why fight me, Gordon?

517
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,680
Who here deserves your protection?

518
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,120
- Any of them?
- All of them.

519
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,440
Even Maroni? Please.

520
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:15,960
Just let me kill this false friend
and get on with my life.

521
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,560
All this fight, and for what?

522
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,480
I'm putting you back in Arkham, Jack.

523
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,720
That's closer to the mark now,
isn't it, Jim?

524
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,720
You need to win, don't you?

525
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,560
You pretend to care
about the law but in your heart,

526
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:49,560
it's all primitive ego
and your lust for blood and power.

527
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,400
You just hate to lose.

528
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,640
You know what? You're right.

529
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,600
I do hate to lose.

530
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,480
Congratulations, young man.

531
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,440
New day.

532
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,520
New day.

533
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,520
Next man that tries to take away
my shield, one way or another,

534
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,240
I'm gonna make him eat it.

535
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,000
Say again.

536
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,680
New day, commissioner.

537
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,920
I hope you have some nasty
pictures of him,

538
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,720
because I bet what you said
was very rude.

539
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,520
I'm done being careful.

540
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,600
You think you've been careful so far?

541
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,840
Men like Commissioner Loeb
are never gonna trust me.

542
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,600
You think you've been careful
so far?

543
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,840
So why play nice?

544
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,880
You think you've been careful
so far?

545
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,240
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

546
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,680
Let's go grab a beer.

547
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,360
Now you're messing with my mind.

548
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,240
I need something stronger than beer.

549
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,800
Hush, young man.

550
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,920
I can hear you sigh.

551
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,880
Sorry, sir.

552
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,200
Let him be.

553
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,880
It's good to see you, old friend.

554
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,880
I am so sorry
it took me so long to get here.

555
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,120
Such a day I've had.

556
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,520
I won't even tell you.

557
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,320
But I'm here.

558
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,640
You were right about Fish.

559
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,400
It's her that's taken Liza.

560
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,040
Sir, allow me.

561
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,840
I must tell you what I've discovered.

562
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,520
You're not gonna want to hear this.

563
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,440
Speak.

564
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,560
Liza was planted on you by Fish.

565
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,720
She belongs to Fish.

566
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,840
This was a setup from the start.

567
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,080
She found a girl
that looked just like your mother

568
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,840
and trained her to...

569
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,720
No.

570
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,200
I'm sorry.

571
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,360
- Prove that.
- How?

572
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,680
I can't.

573
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,840
I just know.

574
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,120
You're wrong.

575
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,800
When have I been wrong?

576
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,840
<i>Hello, Fish.</i>

577
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,640
Don Falcone.

578
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,520
We will meet at my place.

579
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,120
Acceptable?

580
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,920
<i>Yes.</i>

581
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,800
<i>Is she there? Is Liza there now?</i>

582
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,440
<i>- Can I speak to her?</i>
- No.

583
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,760
What time?

584
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,080
<i>In an hour.</i>

585
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,000
I'll be there.

586
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,800
Fish.

587
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,240
Don Falcone.

588
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,440
How's this work?

589
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,920
Liza is close by.

590
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,800
All I need for you to do
is sign papers.

591
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,480
Relinquish all control
of the family...

592
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,440
and then you're both free to leave.

593
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,240
Papers.

594
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,200
You think papers make a don?

595
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,520
I'm offering you a way out, Carmine.

596
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,600
I appreciate that, thank you.

597
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,720
But I need to see her first.

598
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,920
Before I sign anything,
I need to know she's all right.

599
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,120
She's fine.

600
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,880
I need to see her, or no deal.

601
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,320
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

602
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,680
How long have you known Fish Mooney?

603
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,720
I don't.

604
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,360
I just met her now.

605
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,760
No.

606
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,400
A little bird told me you and she
have been friends for a while.

607
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,760
No.

608
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,680
Told me that she told you stuff

609
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,520
about my mother so that I'd get
all caught up in you.

610
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,240
Because Fish knows,
you know, about my mother.

611
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,600
You know how much I love my mother.

612
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,320
Because we talked about her
all the time, you and me.

613
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,520
Remember, Fish, back in the day?

614
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,760
I do.

615
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,880
It seems as though a little bird
has been making a bit of mischief.

616
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,680
Yes...

617
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,040
that's what I had hoped.

618
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,320
But the truth is plain to see.

619
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,800
I'm very disappointed
at my own stupidity.

620
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,720
I'm sorry, Liza. Is that your name?

621
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,720
I'm sorry you had to get mixed up
in this.

622
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:15,240
Because I'm sure
you're a good, honest girl, really.

623
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,160
No.

624
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,280
I want these two alive for now.

625
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,880
Lock them up some place.

626
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,880
Don't bother yelling for help.
All of your people are dead.

627
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,880
Carmine, you have to under...

628
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,320
I can forgive all kinds of betrayal
and dishonesty.

629
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,960
But my mother...

630
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,120
How dare you use
my sainted mother against me?

631
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,840
That's wrong!

632
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,880
- You'll suffer for that.
- I need you...

633
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,320
Thank you, Fish.

634
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,080
For the first time in a long time,
I feel alive.

635
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,040
I remember who I am.

636
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,000
I remember why I'm here.

637
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,520
- Just listen...
- You can come out now.

638
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,680
Right as usual, my friend.

639
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,880
Say your goodbyes quickly.

640
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,480
Miss Mooney has places to go.

641
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,680
Hello, Fish.

642
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,840
Hi.

643
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,200
Dr. Thompkins.

644
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,760
Lee.

645
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,840
Lee.

646
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,520
The desk sergeant said
it was okay to come back here.

647
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,920
- I didn't mean to disturb you.
- No, no. It's okay. Something wrong?

648
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,280
No. I was in the area.

649
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,240
And my sorceress wants her doll back.

650
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,560
Right. Yeah.

651
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,920
Is that why you're here?

652
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,440
Yes.

653
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,000
No.

654
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:29,200
She does want her doll back
but not entirely.

655
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,280
No.

656
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,320
You live here?

657
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,080
I'm sort of between places right now.

658
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,560
I don't know why I'm here.

659
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,160
Sorry.

660
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,680
A whim.

661
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,960
Wait.

662
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,200
Hey, Gordon, did you hear?

663
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,520
There's been a big shootout
at Fish Mooney's place.
