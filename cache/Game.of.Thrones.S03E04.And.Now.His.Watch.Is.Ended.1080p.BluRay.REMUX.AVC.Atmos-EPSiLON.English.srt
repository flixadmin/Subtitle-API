Before all this nastiness,

46
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:35,586
I was going to tell you
the story of how I was cut.

47
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,962
Do you want to hear it still?

48
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:38,797
I don't know. Do I?

49
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:44,178
As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of
actors through the Free Cities.

50
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,222
One day in Myr,

51
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:50,935
a certain man made
my master an offer too tempting to refuse.

52
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,270
I feared the man meant to use me

53
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:55,689
as I'd heard some men used small boys.

54
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:58,275
But what he wanted was far worse.

55
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,239
He gave me a potion
that made me powerless to move or speak,

56
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:06,325
yet did nothing to dull my senses.

57
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,953
With a hooked blade he sliced me,

58
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,705
root and stem, chanting all the while.

59
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:15,251
He burned my parts in a brazier.

60
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:20,464
The flames turned blue,
and I heard a voice answer his call.

61
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,097
I still dream of that night.

62
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,810
Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade.

63
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:36,355
I dream of the voice from the flames.

64
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:40,234
Was it a god? A demon? A conjuror's trick?

65
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,570
I don't know.

66
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:45,906
But the sorcerer called and a voice answered.

67
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:52,246
And ever since that day, I have hated magic
and all those who practice it.

68
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,040
But you can see why I was eager to aid in your

69
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,918
fight against Stannis and his red priestess.

70
00:06:58,002 --> 00:07:00,546
A symbolic revenge of sorts.

71
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:01,797
Yes.

72
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:03,257
(CLEARS THROAT)

73
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,468
I feel the need for actual revenge against

74
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:09,763
the actual person who tried to have me killed,

75
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,601
which will require
a degree of influence, which...

76
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:17,813
You do not possess at the moment.

77
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:24,278
But influence is
largely a matter of patience, I have found.

78
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,239
Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose,

79
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:30,284
he threw me out of his house to die.

80
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:34,538
I resolved to live to spite him.

81
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:36,123
I begged.

82
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,293
I sold what parts of my body remained to me.

83
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,629
I became an excellent thief,

84
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:45,299
and soon learned that
the contents of a man's letters

85
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:49,178
are more valuable
than the contents of his purse.

86

Step by step,
one distasteful task after another,

87
00:07:54,558 --> 00:08:00,105
I made my way from the slums of Myr
to the Small Council chamber.

Influence grows like a weed.

89
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,990
I tended mine patiently

90
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:13,369
until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep

91
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:16,789
all the way across to the far side of the world,

92

to wrap them around something very special.

00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,341
Extraordinary.

167
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:41,428
The most extraordinary man they've ever
had. And they've had a lot of men.

168
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,388
We're talking about the same Podrick?

169
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:47,517
The quiet boy in
Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?

170
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:50,479
What did he do to them?

171
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:51,980
I don't know, my lord.

172
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:54,274
The girls are usually quite descriptive.

173
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,193
So what did they say?

174
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,363
They said it was hard to describe.

175
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,447
Huh.

176
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:05,786
Prodigies appear in the oddest of places.

177
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:09,957
And what did
Littlefinger say about this loss of income?

178
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,000
He was too preoccupied to notice.

179
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,086
He's leaving for the Eyrie soon.

180
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,046
I'm helping him prepare for his journey.

181
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,049
Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the

182
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:22,135
Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her.

183
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,304
Sad, really.

184
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,723
Is that all it takes to make our friend

185
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,267
lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?

186
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:33,730
He hasn't spoken to her
since the last time, as far as I know.

187
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:34,815
Hmm.

188
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,316
But I don't think he's lost interest.

189

What makes you say so?

190
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,698

I'm missing something obvious
you're about to point out?

195
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:57,671
Two featherbeds.

196
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,589
He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.

197
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,095
Who is important enough to Littlefinger

198
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,848
to merit a featherbed, besides Littlefinger?

199
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,100
Could he be bringing one of his girls?

200
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,310
He's not interested in them, my lord.

201
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,146
How do you know?

202
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:16,523
Because I'm one of his girls.

203

Prodigies in odd places indeed.

204
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,281
Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered

205
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:27,159
by her brother, or rather, his dragon.

206
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,828
It ate her while her son watched.

207

(GIGGLES)

208
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:34,958
What's left of her is
buried in the crypts right down there.

209
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,881
CERSEI: The ceremony
is traditionally held in the main sanctum,

210
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:44,051
which seats 700 comfortably.

211

to be a good deal of room elsewhere

213
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:52,392
There aren't
more than 700 people of any importance.

214
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:56,772
No, the rest are there
to look adoringly upon the 700

215
00:14:56,855 --> 00:15:00,776
to remind them how
superior they must be to have the best seats.

216
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:04,696
Over there, in that urn,
the ashes of Aerion Targaryen.

217
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,782
Aerion Brightflame, they called him.

218
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,910
He thought drinking wildfire
would turn him into a dragon.

Would you like to
see where the last Targaryens are buried?

Are you sure Lady Margaery
doesn't find all this a bit macabre?

No, it's quite all right, Your Grace.

229

Hmm. Seems like a lifetime ago.

233
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,278
Your husband was buried here as well?

234
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:48,532
No, he wanted his remains
returned to Storm's End.

235
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:49,741
Such a tragedy.

236
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:52,119
A fairly predictable tragedy.

237
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,703
Hunting and drinking don't mix.

I should say not.

My son's a hunter. It helps him forget

240
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,418
he's never been within a mile of a real battle.

241
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:04,840
I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm's End
for the better part of a year.

242
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:08,969
All he laid siege to
was the banquet table in the command tent.

He had no business fighting an actual warrior.

We shower them with good sense,

326
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:25,308
How could someone like that
ever be a brother to me?

327
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,519
He's the King in the North.

328
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:28,853
And me...

329
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:32,857
My father gave me a choice and I made it.

330
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,820
I could never be a Stark.

331
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:42,409
But ironborn, that's what I was born to be.

332
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:50,333
I paid the iron price for Winterfell.

333
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:58,925
I murdered those boys.

334
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,805
The Stark boys?

335
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:07,058
Never found them.

336
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:10,603
Just some poor orphans living with a farmer.

337
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:18,820
I let Dagmer slit
their throats and I let him burn the bodies,

338
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:23,533
so I could keep Winterfell

339
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:28,037
and make my father proud.

340
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,499
Maybe it's not too late.

341
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,045
It is.

342
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,214
(SNIFFLES)

343
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:47,724
My real father lost his head at King's Landing.

344
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,769
I made a choice,

345
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,357
and I chose wrong.

346
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,529
And now I've burned everything down.

347
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,617
Not everything, my lord.

348
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:09,746
She's up here.

349
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,594
- Yara.
- Shh!

350
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,262
Wait.

351
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,148
I brought him back. He... He killed the others.

352
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,275
What? No, I didn't.

353
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,569
You can't! (GROANS)

354
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:44,155
No! Please, stop!

(SCREAMING)

360

Eat.

What are you doing?

362
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:25,363
I'm dying.

363
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,615
You can't die.

364
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:33,454
You need to live to take revenge.

365
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:35,748
I don't care about revenge.

366
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:37,667
You coward.

367
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,629
A little misfortune and you're giving up.

368
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:44,924
Misfor...

369
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:47,176
Misfortune?

370
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:48,636
You lost your hand.

371
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,472
My sword hand. I was that hand.

372
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:52,599
(SCOFFS)

373
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,102
You have a taste,

374
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,938
one taste of the real world

375
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:01,816
where people have
important things taken from them,

376
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:04,736
and you whine and cry and quit.

377
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,196
You sound like a bloody woman.

378
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:35,141
I know what you did for me.

379
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:39,520
You told them Tarth was full of sapphires.

380
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:47,695
It's called the Sapphire Isle
because of the blue of its water.

381
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,784
You knew that.

382
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,251
Why did you help me?

383
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:18,893
(SIGHS)

384
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:30,196
You wanted to speak to me?

385
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,448
Yes, about Jaime.

386
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,201
What about him?

387
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,078
I wanted to make sure we're doing

388
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:38,996
everything we can to get him back.

389
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,336
When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner,

390
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,256
what did I do in response?

391
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:49,716
You started a war.

392
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:54,011
And if I would start
a war for that lecherous little stump,

393
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:57,265
what do you think I am doing
for my oldest son and heir?

394
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:58,641
Whatever you can.

395
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,936
Whatever I can.

396
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:16,200
You're still here.

397
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:17,660
Yes.

398
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,080
Why?

399
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:23,666
Did it ever occur to you that

400
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,168
I might be the one who deserves

401
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,753
your confidence and your trust,

402
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:28,212
not your sons?

403
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:31,090
Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me.

404
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:35,344
Years and years of lectures
on family and legacy... (CHUCKLES)

405
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:40,308
The same lecture, really,
just with tiny, tedious variations.

406
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:42,018
Did it ever occur to you that your daughter

407
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:45,730
might be the only one
listening to them, living by them?

408
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:49,400
That she might have the most
to contribute to your legacy

409
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:52,278
that you love so much more
than your actual children?

(BLOWS)

411
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,163
All right. Contribute.

412
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:07,043
The Tyrells are a problem.

413
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:11,589
The Tyrells helped us
defeat Stannis Baratheon.

414
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:14,926
The Tyrells saved your life,
your children's lives.

415
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:19,055
Margaery has her claws in Joffrey.

416
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,725
She knows how to manipulate him.

417
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:26,229
Good. I wish you knew
how to manipulate him.

418
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:30,483
I don't distrust you because you're a woman.

419
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:34,153
I distrust you because
you're not as smart as you think you are.

420
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:36,739
You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod

421
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:39,450
over you and everyone else in this city.

422
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:50,336
Perhaps you should try
stopping him from doing what he likes.

423
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:56,259
I will.

424
00:27:58,261 --> 00:28:00,304
GIRL: Do you like it, Nana?

425
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:03,182
Another golden rose. How original.

426
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:05,476
I eat from plates stamped with roses.

427
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,854
I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses.

428
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:10,731
I have a golden rose
painted on my chamber pot,

429
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:12,984
as if that makes it smell any better.

430
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:14,861
Roses are boring, dear.

431
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:17,363
"Growing strong."

432
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,616
Ha! The dullest words of any house.

433
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,620
"Winter is coming!" Now that's memorable.

434
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,707
"We do not sow." Strong. Strong.

435
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,709
Those are houses you watch out for.

436
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:33,880
Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts.

437
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:36,549
But a golden rose growing strong,

438
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:39,260
(SCOFFS) that strikes fear in the heart.

439
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,723
Look, little loves.

440
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:45,641
A spider in the garden.

441
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:50,438
Run along now. Grow strong.

442
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:54,150
My lady.

443
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:57,528
I wanted to personally
welcome you to King's Landing.

444
00:28:57,612 --> 00:29:00,031
The city has
been made brighter by your presence.

445
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:03,075
The city is made brighter by my presence?

446
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:07,121
Is that your usual line,
Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me?

447
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,748
A little obvious, perhaps.

448
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:14,170
Oh, no, please.
Seduce away. It's been so long.

449
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,631
Though I rather think it's all for naught.

450
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:20,092
What happens when
the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit?

451
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,554
A question for the philosophers.

452
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:26,599
But you've come mincing
all this way for something.

453
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,684
- So?
- Might I sit?

454
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:29,852
No.

455
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,564
Come, I've heard you're such a clever man.

456
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:36,525
I'm curious why you've sought me out.

457
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:40,321
You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.

458
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,449
Have I?
Because I spoke to her once in this garden

459
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:46,452
and one of your little spies
came running to tell you?

460
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,955
Why shouldn't I? She's an interesting girl.

461
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:50,206
Is she?

462
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:51,582
No, not particularly.

463
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,542
But she's had an interesting childhood.

464
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,628
She has, sadly.

465
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:58,673
Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then.

466
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:01,842
I thought we shared
certain hopes for her well-being.

467
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:05,930
(CHUCKLING) Come, come.
You surrender rather easily.

468
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:08,891
Walk with me.

469
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:13,104
I know the walls have ears,
but apparently the shrubbery does, too.

470
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:18,985
I choose my allies
carefully, and my enemies more carefully still.

471
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:20,987
Which is Sansa Stark?

472
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,656
Neither. A babe in the woods.

473
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:24,740
I admired her father.

474
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:25,866
Yes.

475
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,994
Ned Stark had many admirers,

476
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:32,039
and how many stepped forward
when the executioner came for his head?

477
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:35,459
I could not help Lord Stark.
Perhaps I can help his daughter.

478
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:37,003
How?

479
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:40,548
You're not the only one
who has taken an interest in her.

480
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:44,760
That's hardly surprising.
She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.

481
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:48,222
Indeed.
She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.

482
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:51,183
It almost feels
as if you're about to arrive at the point.

483
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,853
Littlefinger is not long for the capital.

484
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:56,022
A confidant of mine has told me that

485
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:58,274
when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him.

486
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:01,110
And why have you come
to me with this matter?

487
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:05,031
Littlefinger was born
with no lands, no wealth, no armies.

488
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:08,534
He has acquired the
first two. How long before he has the army?

489
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:12,663
Perhaps you'll laugh,
but I know him better than most,

490
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:15,041
and this is the truth.

491
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:19,545
Littlefinger is one of
the most dangerous men in Westeros.

492
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:24,300
If Robb Stark falls,
Sansa Stark is the key to the North.

493
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,344
And if he marries her,
he'll have the key in his pocket.

494
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:29,055
Which seems such a shame.

495
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:31,182
Why should a man with such a low reputation

496
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,392
steal away such a lovely bride?

497
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:37,646
You must despise him.
You're working so hard to undermine him.

498
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,608
Actually, I rather enjoy him.

499
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:42,610
But he would see this country burn

500
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:44,653
if he could be king of the ashes.

501
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,198
You are a clever man, Lord Varys.

502
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:51,786
You are too kind.
I believe I have a possible solution.

503
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:54,997
One doesn't need to
be clever for that. It's obvious, isn't it?

504
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,594
(CLEARS THROAT)

505
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:09,970
I didn't mean to disturb you.

00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:11,430
You haven't.

507
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:14,058
We'd like some privacy, please.

508
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:17,061
If you wouldn't mind
waiting back inside the keep.

509
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,648
Or if you'd be kind enough
to give me your names,

510
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:23,442
I'll ask the King to speak with you himself.

511
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,281
What did you pray for?

512
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:30,658
I can't tell you.

513
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:32,076
Why not?

514
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,703
I'll tell you
what I prayed for in the Sept this morning.

515
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:38,582
Let's see,
for my family's health and happiness,

516
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:41,752
for an end to the war, for a short winter.

517
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:45,381
Boring and traditional, I'm afraid. And you?

518
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,300
I'm sorry, I just can't.

519
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:52,513
MARGAERY: My cousin Alanna
was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen.

520
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,765
When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees,

521
00:32:54,849 --> 00:32:57,184
and Alanna
looked like a goddess sent to torture me.

522
00:32:57,268 --> 00:32:59,061
"Pig Face," she called me.

523
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:00,980
(LAUGHS) "Pig Face"? That's ridiculous.

524
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:03,149
It had something to do with my nose.

525
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,193
Whenever she passed me
in the halls, she'd oink.

526
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:07,778
- (OINKS)
- (LAUGHS)

527
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:11,532
So I prayed that
she'd catch a horrible skin disease.

528
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:14,118
A week after that,
she came down with porridge plague.

529
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,286
Porridge plague?

530
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:16,495
Oh, you don't have it in the North?

531
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:18,998
Your skin starts to look like boiled oats,

532
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:21,876
and eventually,
your face slides off and you die in agony.

533
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:23,752
But that's awful.

534
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:26,839
(LAUGHS)

535
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:28,507
You're...

536
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:30,676
I believed you!

537
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,344
Porridge plague. I'm an idiot.

538
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:34,972
Don't say that. No, you're not.

539
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,349
So what happened to Alanna?

540
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:39,351
Oh, she grew up to be
the most beautiful woman

541
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:42,438
and married a handsome
lord and they have darling children

542
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,190
and live in a castle by the sea.

543
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:45,983
It's all terribly frustrating.

544
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,653
SANSA: I'm sure she's jealous of you now.

545
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:51,947
You'll be married here in the capital,

546
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:53,782
and she'll have to come watch and

547
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:55,618
pretend to be happy that you're queen.

548
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:56,702
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

549
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:01,916
I want us to be friends, good friends.

550
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,293
That would make me very happy.

551
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:10,049
You must see Highgarden.
You'd love it there. I know you would.

552
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:13,052
We have a great
masquerade the night of the harvest moon.

553
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:15,971
You should see the
costumes. People work on them for months.

554
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:21,143
Uh, I don't think
the Queen would let me leave King's Landing.

555
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:25,272
The Queen Regent, you mean.
Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen.

556
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:31,403
And if you were to marry Loras,

557
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:37,576
your place would
be at Highgarden, wouldn't it?

558
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:42,873
We would be sisters,
you and I. Would you like that?

559
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:59,848
His name was Bannen.

560
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:03,269
He was a good man, a good ranger.

561
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:05,354
He came to us from...

562
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:09,066
Where did he come from?

563
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:10,901
Down White Harbor way.

564
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:14,071
He came to us from White Harbor.

565
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:17,116
Never failed in his duty.

566
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,286
He kept his vows the best he could.

567
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:23,872
He rode far, fought fiercely.

568
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,794
We shall never see his like again.

569
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,880
ALL: And now his watch has ended.

570
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:35,884
And now his watch has ended.

571
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:43,475
Didn't think a broke foot could kill a man.

572
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:46,478
It wasn't his foot that killed him.

573
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:49,106
That bastard Craster starved him to death.

574
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:50,733
Craster's got his daughters to feed.

575
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,484
RAST: You on his side?

576
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:55,863
We can't just show up and steal all his food.

577
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:58,157
We're brothers of
the Night's Watch, not thieves.

578
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,871
The day we leave,
Craster will tap a barrel of our wine,

579
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:06,999
and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes

580
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:10,210
and laugh at us starving in the snow.

581

583

You have one son, don't you, Mormont?

584
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:39,740
I had my 99th.

585
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,911
You ever meet a man with 99 sons?

586
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:49,249
And more daughters than I can count.

587
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:50,459

cut their throats and be done with it?

Lions, you call yourselves.

At the Mummer's Ford,
girls of seven years were raped,

691
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:41,995
and babes still on the breast
were cut in two while their mothers watched.

House Clegane was built upon dead children.

695
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:53,298
I saw them lay Prince Aegon
and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.

696

Do you take me for
my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime?

697
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:59,095
Murder is a crime.

698
00:43:59,221 --> 00:44:00,722
I never touched the Targaryen babes.

699

them, never heard them bawling.

But don't call me murderer
and pretend that you're not.

00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:14,319
You murdered Mycah.

703
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:18,615
The butcher's boy. My friend.

704
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:23,495
He was 12 years old.
He was unarmed. And you rode him down.

705
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:26,039
You slung him
over your horse like he was some deer.

706
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:28,583
Aye, he was a bleeder.

707
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,461
You don't deny killing this boy?

708
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,088
HOUND: I was Joffrey's sworn shield.

709
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,048
- The boy attacked the prince.
- That's a lie!

710
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:38,510
I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.

711
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:42,430
Then I should have
killed you. Not my place to question princes.

712

You stand accused of murder.

But no one here knows the truth

if your fire god really loves you, priest?
