-He's gonna be okay.

00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:03,420
But there's been some memory impairment.

00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:05,630
Particularly his short-term memory.

215
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,716
Right now he can't remember the accident

or anything that happened to him recently.

217

Is it permanent?

It could be. Only time will tell.

219
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:16,391

Oh. Maybe I should wait.

00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:56,948
Just--Yeah, a little chunky.

328
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,451
Okay.

329
00:36:00,118 --> 00:36:03,329
But you don't have to worry
about that anymore, buddy.

330
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:12,630
[Jameson] Dazzle me.

331
00:36:17,052 --> 00:36:18,720
Pow. Zap.

332
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:23,099
Just a little something the boys
in the Ad Department and I whipped up.

333
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:26,186
As you know, circulation at
the <i>Bugle's</i> been pretty good.

334
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:28,271
Though not as good as <i>The New York Times.</i>

335
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:30,899
Or the <i>Daily News</i>, or the Post,
or several other smaller--

-Get on with it, you moron--!

00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:44,204
Thank you.

341
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:49,125
[Hoffman] So I propose this campaign.

342
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:51,753
<i>"Daily Bugle.</i>" That's obvious.

343
00:36:51,836 --> 00:36:55,090
"It's hip, it's now."
I came up with that one.

344
00:36:55,882 --> 00:36:58,677
"It's wow." That's actually Erickson.
He goes crazy.

345
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,221
We gave him a couple lattes,
he's like, phew!

346
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:03,014
"And how." That's me again.

347
00:37:03,098 --> 00:37:04,641

-Oh, no.

00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:39,092
-I'm just here to talk to you, beautiful.
-What's that smell?

360
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:42,554
That's a little something called
Nice and Easy. What's on you?

361
00:37:42,637 --> 00:37:44,347
It's called Go Away.

362

Get out! That is the dumbest idea
you've ever had!

-And you have had some doozies!
-Blood pressure.

364

Hey, where are you going?

-Who are you?
-You hired him last week. Freelance.

366
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:58,987
-I did? What's that smell?
-It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

367
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,197
-Who? What--?
-Can I just say I really like that shirt?

368
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:02,490
Here, it's the crane accident.

-Check out the light source.
-He likes my shirt.

-Hey, Betty.
-Hey, Pete. You better get in there.

371
00:38:07,245 --> 00:38:10,165

He's trying to sell some Spidey photos.

Thanks.

It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

-But I got you this.
-But he got me this.

377
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:23,887
Wait, how'd you get that? I didn't see
you there. How'd you get that high?

378
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,723
-Climbed. Nearly fell off a flagpole.
-A flagpole?

379
00:38:26,806 --> 00:38:29,809
-Which one do we use?
-I like Bernstein's.

-It's better.
-Cheaper too.

381

Congratulations, son, we'll use your shot.
I'll pay you 50 bucks.

382
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:37,108
All right, J.J., I'm your man. I know
more about what makes a good picture

383
00:38:37,192 --> 00:38:38,568
than any photographer in this town.

384
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:42,447
See, photography, it's not just about,
no offense, uh, flagpoles or whatever.

385
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,866
It's about lighting. Composition. Drama.

386
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:47,160
I want a staff job, sir.

387
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:50,497
I have a girl that I intend to marry

388
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,583
and I guess, I don't know,
I have this stupid little dream

389
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:56,836
of working with one of the greatest
newspaper editors of our time...

390
00:38:57,754 --> 00:38:59,172
J. Jonah Jameson.

391
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:05,387
Well, we do have an opening.
Johnson quit, remember?

392
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,721
-You fired him.
-Whatever.

393
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:09,808
Wait a minute. I know what makes a good
picture and I've been here a long time.

394
00:39:09,891 --> 00:39:12,102
If there's a staff job, Mr. Jameson,
I think I deserve it.

395
00:39:12,185 --> 00:39:16,022
He's right, Jonah. Peter's been with us
for years. He's done a great job.

396
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:18,149
You want a staff job,
and you want a staff job.

397

-Anybody care about what I want?
-[Hoffman] I do.

398
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:22,112
Shut up. Get out.

399
00:39:22,195 --> 00:39:25,740
I want the public to see Spider-Man
for the two-bit criminal he really is.

400
00:39:25,824 --> 00:39:29,285
He's a fake, he's full of stickum.
Catch him in the act.

Spider-Man with his hand in a cookie jar.

I'm on it, boss.

405
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:41,131
You'll never get that shot.

406
00:39:41,214 --> 00:39:42,549
Oh, we'll see.

407
00:39:57,063 --> 00:40:01,651
You know, I guess one person
can make a difference.

408

Enough said.

409

-Sir.

412

Got you a little homecoming present.

-[Peter] Yeah.

Thanks, buddy.

Hey, we were pretty good
in the back yard, weren't we?

416
00:40:31,348 --> 00:40:35,101
We were terrible. And we tried out
for the varsity team.

417
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:37,312
-For the cheerleaders.
-Right.

418
00:40:37,395 --> 00:40:40,023
-Hey, do I have any girlfriends?
-I don't know.

419
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:41,399
You don't?

420
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:44,527
Hey, Bernard. Do I have any girlfriends?

421
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:47,113
Not that I know of, sir.

422
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,371
It's a pretty cool pad, huh?

423
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:56,206
It's okay.

424
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:59,334
-Looks like I'm not hurting for money.
-No.

425
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:02,671
Well, maybe I can turn this
no-girlfriend thing around.

[Peter chuckles]

427

You know, he always appreciated
how you helped me through high school.

428
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:18,978
Just wish I could remember more about him.

429
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,316
Well, he loved you. That's the main thing.

Get something to eat.

Yeah.

00:44:52,817 --> 00:44:54,694
Isn't that that guy
from that prison break?

483
00:44:55,737 --> 00:44:57,280
[officer] He fits.

Hey, you. Halt!

[car alarms blaring]

496
00:46:38,214 --> 00:46:39,841
People of the city of New York,

497
00:46:39,924 --> 00:46:43,511
I am here today because I fell 62 stories

498
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:45,305
and someone caught me.

499
00:46:45,388 --> 00:46:48,475
Someone who never asks
for anything in return.

500
00:46:48,558 --> 00:46:52,312
Someone who doesn't even
want us to know who he is.

501
00:46:52,395 --> 00:46:53,563
Hey, M.J.

502
00:46:53,646 --> 00:46:56,107
-Harry.
-Hey.

503
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:58,234
-Where's Pete?
-Um...

504
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:00,570
-Taking somebody's picture, I guess.
-Right.

505
00:47:00,653 --> 00:47:03,531
I'm so happy to see you.
You look so good, Harry.

506
00:47:03,615 --> 00:47:05,033
I've never felt better.

507
00:47:05,116 --> 00:47:07,327
It's a weird feeling
not knowing who you are.

508
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:10,330
Bump on the head, I'm as free as a bird.

509
00:47:10,413 --> 00:47:13,708
-Will you bump me on the head?
-Bop.

510
00:47:15,043 --> 00:47:17,212
Hey, Pete said you're in a play.

511
00:47:17,295 --> 00:47:20,048
You came. You sent me flowers.

512
00:47:20,131 --> 00:47:22,717
I did? I'll come again tonight.

513
00:47:23,635 --> 00:47:26,429
You can't. I was let go.

514
00:47:26,513 --> 00:47:28,223
What happened?

515
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:31,434
I wasn't very good.

516
00:47:32,852 --> 00:47:34,938
You know, this is embarrassing,

517
00:47:35,021 --> 00:47:37,399
but I once wrote you a play
in high school. Heh.

518
00:47:37,482 --> 00:47:38,817
-You wrote me a play?
-Yeah.

519
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,985
Harry, that's the sweetest thing.

520
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:44,364
So I ask you: When you're
dropping without a parachute

521
00:47:44,447 --> 00:47:47,951
or your store's being robbed
or your house is on fire,

522
00:47:48,034 --> 00:47:50,203
who is it that breaks your fall,

523
00:47:50,286 --> 00:47:54,040
puts out the flames
and saves your children?

524
00:47:54,124 --> 00:47:55,875
[all] Spider-Man!

525
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:57,127
They love me.

526
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:00,880
Then let's hear it for your one and only

533
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:31,327
[Spider-Man] Hey there. Hi.

534

-Kiss him.
-Kiss him.

Go ahead, lay one on me.

-Really?
-Yeah, they'll love it.

-Kiss her.
-Kiss him.

539
00:48:43,631 --> 00:48:45,008
No, Spider-Man, no.

540
00:48:45,091 --> 00:48:46,968
All right.

Yes, and I wanna do
something very special.

if the musicians would play this song...

Listen, I have been through this.
It happens to me all the time.

614
00:55:08,516 --> 00:55:10,894
I see Spider-Man posters in the window,

with me on their sweaters--

I don't know, I guess
I've become something of an icon.

618
00:55:17,984 --> 00:55:22,781
Like yesterday, they kept screaming,
"Spider-Man, Spider-Man."

619
00:55:23,656 --> 00:55:26,993
I don't know, you know,
I mean, I'm thinking to myself:

"I'm just a nerdy kid from Queens.
Do I deserve this?"

-Hi, Pete. [chuckles]
-Hi.

Hi, my parents and I
were just having dinner here.

-Hello. I'm Gwen Stacy.
-Hi.

Oh! Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you.

626

Pete talks about you all the time.

627
00:55:57,649 --> 00:55:59,442
Oh?

628
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:03,613
Gwen is my lab partner
in Dr. Connors' class.

629
00:56:03,697 --> 00:56:06,950
Pete's something of a genius.
I'd be completely lost without him.

630
00:56:07,033 --> 00:56:09,035
Which actually reminds me,

631
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,372
Pete, if you've got a picture
of my kiss with Spider-Man,

632
00:56:12,455 --> 00:56:14,791
could you bring it to class?

633
00:56:14,874 --> 00:56:18,420
I'd really love it. Heh. For my portfolio.

634
00:56:19,754 --> 00:56:22,257
After all, who gets
kissed by Spider-Man, right?

635
00:56:23,008 --> 00:56:24,759
I can't imagine.

636
00:56:26,136 --> 00:56:28,638
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

637
00:56:29,597 --> 00:56:31,099
-Good night.
-Good night.

Oh, she's in my science class.

00:56:44,362 --> 00:56:46,364
It's not her best subject.

641
00:56:48,575 --> 00:56:49,909
What?

642
00:56:49,993 --> 00:56:52,370
How come you never mentioned her?

643
00:56:53,663 --> 00:56:56,166
