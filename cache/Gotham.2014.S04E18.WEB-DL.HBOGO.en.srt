1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,200
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,960
Where is Xander Wilde?

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,480
My God.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,480
- There's two of them.
- I'm gonna drive you mad, brother.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,600
All of Gotham
will be joining you too.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,560
You shall become the Demon's Head.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,840
She's got the mark
of the Demon's Head.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,600
No woman has ever been allowed
to lead the League of Shadows.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,520
The sisters of the league
are yours to command.

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,800
Tell me what I need to know.

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,320
<i>I could've killed Jerome,
and I didn't.</i>

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,600
Don't take so much responsibility
that you get yourself killed.

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,040
I came up with a plan
to turn this city into a madhouse.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,760
Oh, we're gonna need
a lot more of this.

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,080
Thank you all for
coming this evening.

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,280
As your interim mayor, I know my
recent appointment was sudden

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,520
and perhaps a bit of a shock to some.

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,200
Quite frankly, I was shocked.
What is important

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,560
now is the future of this great city.

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,560
That is why I'm meeting
with all of you.

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:20,040
Well, mayor, as chairperson
of Gotham's Moral Authority Society

22
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,280
our members have been, quite frankly

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,600
unnerved by the recent
going-ons in our great city.

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,080
We have seen criminals take office

25
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,200
gunfights in our streets,

26
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,240
- corruption on a massive scale.
- Mrs. Haverstock, the Commissioner

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,600
and I have worked tirelessly these
past few weeks

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,680
to improve the way
this city conducts itself.

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,760
- Wyatt? Everything all right?
- We're looking into it now, sir.

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,600
Did a window blow open?
It's gotten so cold.

31
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,960
- What's happened?
- Don't come any closer!

32
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,880
Good evening, everyone.

33
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,800
What do you want with us?

34
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,640
Sorry, no time for questions,
Mr. Mayor.

35
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,200
You see, your presence
is urgently needed elsewhere.

36
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,560
Whatever you expect as ransom,
I will double it.

37
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,960
I have access
to the police pension fund.

38
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,720
That can be a lot of money.
Tempting, but...

39
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,560
no, thanks.

40
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,960
Bridgit, isn't It?

41
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,600
I can get you safe passage
from the city, money, a new home.

42
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,160
It was people like you that locked
me up in Strange's lab

43
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,600
and thanks to that,
there is no Bridgit anymore.

44
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,240
I can get you a pardon, son. All will
be forgiven, just stop this lunatic.

45
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,000
Lunatic is a little harsh.
I prefer visionary.

46
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,800
Oswald, can't you do something?

47
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,520
Afraid not.

48
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,120
I am with Mr. Valeska, 100 percent.

49
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,440
Every cop this city will be looking
for us, and when they find you

50
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,720
expect no mercy,
just a hail of bullets.

51
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,840
So serious.

52
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,400
That's why your
approval ratings are so low.

53
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,080
Hey, tell you what

54
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,440
try threatening me again,
but this time, try it with a smile.

55
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,080
Oh, see, this is what's wrong, nobody
knows how to have fun anymore, right?

56
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,440
But see our friend down there,
bag head?

57
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,720
He's figured out a way to solve that.

58
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
Please stop.

59
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,400
It's time to give this city
the boost it needs.

60
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,520
Time to stop taking
ourselves so seriously.

61
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,280
I mean, come on, Gotham,
what do you have to lose?

62
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,960
Except your sanity.

63
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,040
You gonna tell me why we need to
come to the garage, Alfred?

64
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,560
Happy birthday, Master Wayne.

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,600
- You remembered.
- Of course, I remembered.

66
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,040
I bloody love your birthdays.

67
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,960
Your seventh was an absolute blinder.

68
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,120
I remember you had
about 50 kids come out,

69
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,960
but you were off outside on your own.

70
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,760
You were obsessed by this one gift
that your dad gave you,

71
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,240
this bright red wagon.

72
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,840
You were in the garden all-day
collecting these rocks.

73
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,240
When I asked what you were
gonna do with these rocks you said.

74
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,360
"I'm gonna build a home for my wagon

75
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
a secret place that only
I know about."

76
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,280
- What's this?
- It's the reason

77
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,520
I brought you to the garage.
Master Bruce.

78
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,000
Alfred, I don't know what to say.

79
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,280
V8, five-liter,
460 horsepower engine.

80
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,200
Painted matte black anti-reflective.
Very difficult to see at night.

81
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,400
Oh, and of course this.

82
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,960
One hundred percent bulletproof.

83
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,360
Best be prepared?

84
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,320
Oh, mate.

85
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,720
Jim, hey. What gives?

86
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,440
{\an5}The mayor and the police commissioner
have been kidnapped by Jerome.

87
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,080
{\an5}I got every cop in the city
out there searching all

88
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,240
{\an5}the spots Jerome's been
seen the last week.

89
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,880
{\an5}You got something for me?

90
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,680
{\an5}I was gonna say I
won a hundred bucks

91
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,520
{\an5}and a scratch
in the lotto at the liquor store

92
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,560
{\an5}and we could go to the track with it,
but we can do your thing first.

93
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,280
{\an5}- Gordon.
<i>-We need to talk.</i>

94
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,400
{\an5}- Oswald?
- I'm out back, come alone.

95
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,080
{\an5}Yeah.

96
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,320
All right.

97
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,640
{\an5}Well, this is a first.

98
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,440
{\an5}Are you doing anything about Jerome?

99
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,560
{\an5}We're looking for him.
Do you know where he is?

100
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,920
{\an5}And if I did, do you think
I'd just tell you?

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,840
{\an5}Have you march in there, guns
blazing? He needs to be stopped.

102
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,000
{\an5}He has everyone under his thumb,
Freeze, Firefly, Hatter.

103
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,560
{\an5}They are all part of his plan.
A dark, terrible plan.

104
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,680
Which is?

105
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,080
{\an5}Scarecrow has made a gas for him.

106
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,560
{\an5}- Like the fear toxin?
- Worse, much worse.

107
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,400
{\an5}I saw it turn someone into a
maniacal, cackling, violent animal.

108
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,880
{\an5}And what does he plan to do with it?

109
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,600
{\an5}He's smart, he hasn't shared his
plans with anyone.

110
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,200
{\an5}Instead, we all have a separate
task to perform.

111
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,400
{\an5}Such as?

112
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,480
{\an5}He has yet to give me my role.

113
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,080
{\an5}Why'd you come if
you're not gonna help?

114
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,080
{\an5}He scares the living hell
out of me, okay?

115
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,520
{\an5}I mean, I was willing
to play along with him for a while.

116
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,240
{\an5}Perhaps he had a way
to make us all rich,

117
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,760
{\an5}a return to the
good old days, you know?

118
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840
But nothing good will come of this.

119
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,560
{\an5}Or maybe you just don't
like the competition.

120
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,480
{\an5}Jerome casts quite the shadow.

121
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,200
{\an5}Oh, please, he's a
maniac, an anarchist.

122
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,320
He is not interested in
money or power.

123
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,040
- And I am a honest criminal, Jim.
- Where is he? Where is the gas?

124
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,800
He only tells you what he needs to,
when he needs to.

125
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,440
- I just know he has to be stopped.
- Jim, hey.

126
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,760
Are you down here?

127
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,600
- Jim.
- Yeah.

128
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,000
Hey, a uni just spotted
Jerome near Paisley Square.

129
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,120
All right, let's go.

130
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,160
Hey, what happened to my mic?

131
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,560
Hey, buddy, beat it,
will you? I'm trying to work here.

132
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,440
Where's everyone going?

133
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are the Arkham Asylum Lunatics.

134
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,760
We came here to blow some minds!

135
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,800
Sorry to interrupt your little show.

136
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,280
But you are gonna love this next one.

137
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,720
Introducing Mayor Pritchard,
Commissioner Reynolds

138
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,480
Archbishop McGregor
and this lady, whoever she is.

139
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,160
This is everybody.

140
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,240
Everybody, say hi.

141
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,440
Now, as you can see, we're still
waiting for two guests of honor.

142
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,360
But in the meantime,

143
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,520
let's go over the rules of tonight's
entertainment, shall we?

144
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
Dynamite.

145
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,520
Trigger. I don't get what I want?

146
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,040
Boom. Headless people.

147
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,440
And if any of you are thinking
of going anywhere, you'll die too.

148
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,680
Now, the one man
who can get me what I want.

149
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,680
<i>Come over here. Calling Gordon.</i>

150
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,200
<i>Calling Captain James Gordon.</i>

151
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,160
I speak on behalf of myself

152
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,240
and all other gang
leaders in this city

153
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,480
when I say your arrogance
and disrespect

154
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,640
will no longer be tolerated.

155
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,840
You beat and then dragged
my brother from here like a dog.

156
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,360
Your brother's an ass.

157
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,240
He abuses our staff and refuses
to pay his exorbitant tab.

158
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,040
He is my brother,
and he demands your respect.

159
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,080
And I suppose an apology
would be out of the question.

160
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,400
Your blood will be his apology.

161
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,280
Thought so.

162
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,600
I could've handled them.

163
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,040
That's the advantage of having
your own personal army,

164
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,840
Tabs. You don't have to.

165
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,200
Isn't that right?

166
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
What's wrong?

167
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,480
Ra's al Ghul chose you,
no one else, to pass on his spirit.

168
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,120
We will serve you,
protect you, of course.

169
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,000
But surely,
you intend to continue his legacy

170
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,880
and not just remain here
in this place?

171
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
What does that mean?

172
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,680
Continue his legacy?

173
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,040
I like the sound of that.

174
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,200
As I told you

175
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,080
we have much more to show you.

176
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,480
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

177
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,320
The hell was that?

178
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,040
Gentlemen, ladies

179
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,960
your assistance is urgently required.

180
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,320
Be careful.
These are very dangerous materials.

181
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,520
Oh, we're counting on it.

182
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,120
More laughing gas. We need to make.

183
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,440
- What?
- There's no time to waste.

184
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,800
We need it in bulk, you see.

185
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,560
Well. Well, how much of it
do you need?

186
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,120
This much.

187
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,480
Ladies and gentlemen,
as I live and breathe,

188
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,560
James Gordon is in the house.

189
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,160
I'm not talking to you until
I can get up there

190
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,600
and check on the wellbeing
of your hostages.

191
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,760
First of all, Jim, you're late.

192
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,520
Secondly, I think I'm the one
who should be making demands.

193
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
Don't you?

194
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,360
What you're doing is an act
of terror, Valeska.

195
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,520
<i>Yeah, you scumbag.</i>

196
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,040
Ask our mayor what this city's policy
is on negotiating with terrorists.

197
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,200
Terrorists?

198
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,800
Frankly, I'm offended. No, no, no!

199
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,920
That's close enough, Gordon.

200
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,600
And none of you go anywhere either.

201
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,400
Deadman's trigger.

202
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,960
If this falls out of my hand
for any reason and, bang!

203
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,440
I got two empty chairs here.

204
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,360
You haven't even asked me
who they're for yet.

205
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,200
All right, I'll bite.
Who are they for?

206
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,840
Come on, James, you're a detective.

207
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,680
Do some detecting.

208
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,640
Jeremiah, your brother.

209
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,240
- Bingo. That's one.
- And the other?

210
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,320
Well, the only
other irksome do-gooder

211
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,320
who's ever spoiled
my fun in this town.

212
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,120
Bruce Wayne.

213
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,080
No.

214
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,360
No?

215
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,640
You can take me.

216
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,720
I'll sit up there with one of
those things around my neck,

217
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,160
but I won't let you have him.

218
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,200
Well, I don't want you, Jim.

219
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,680
I want my brother.

220
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,280
And I want Bruce. I want them now.

221
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,240
All right, let me get these people
out of here. I'll come up there and...

222
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,120
You are not listening to me!

223
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,920
And that is forcing my hand.

224
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,640
Jerome.

225
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
No.

226
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,000
Bring me my brother.

227
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,120
Bring me Wayne.

228
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,640
Bring them now.

229
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,240
<i>Happy birthday, dear Master B</i>

230
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,520
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

231
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,160
I'll get some plates.

232
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,520
You know, for a billionaire,
your security system is lame.

233
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,720
Miss Kyle.

234
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,800
- Thank you, Alfred.
- Enjoy.

235
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,560
- Thank you.
- For what?

236
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,520
Visiting me on my birthday.

237
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,280
I actually,
didn't know it was your birthday.

238
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,240
I just happened to be strolling
in the neighborhood.

239
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,280
Either way, it's good to see you.

240
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,360
I knew it was an act.

241
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,480
What?

242
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,640
The brat.
And the drinking, the... the friends.

243
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,800
It was an act.

244
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,840
I think you're more sure
about that than me.

245
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,520
Master Bruce. We have visitors.

246
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,280
Bruce, we need your help.

247
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
What happened?

248
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,320
<i>Don't you know it's rude
to keep a guy waiting?</i>

249
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:03,520
<i>Bring me my hostages, James.
My trigger finger is getting itchy.</i>

250
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,240
The hostages he wants
are his brother.

251
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,400
And you.

252
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,840
What? You're having a laugh.
No bloody way.

253
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,320
I don't like it any more than you do,

254
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,640
but Bruce you have to trust me.
Lucius and I have a plan.

255
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,760
<i>Okay, you know what?</i>

256
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:22,400
<i>I don't think you're taking me
seriously enough. Well, all right.</i>

257
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,000
{\an5}<i>Let's see, eenie, meenie, minie, mo.</i>

258
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,800
{\an5}<i>One of these people have got to go.</i>

259
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,480
{\an5}<i>It was that guy. Oh, well.</i>

260
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,840
Did you see what just happened?

261
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,160
He's a raving lunatic.
He can't be trusted.

262
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,120
- For once, I agree with Alfred.
- Bruce, listen to me.

263
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,240
With your help,
we can prevent more deaths.

264
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,480
What's the plan?

265
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,400
Jerome is using a shortwave radio
trigger with a Deadman's switch.

266
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,480
If we can cut the signal,
he can't activate the explosives.

267
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,040
This emits a powerful signal that
disables all radio waves close to it.

268
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,240
Once within a few feet of Jerome's
device, his trigger will be useless.

269
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,640
That will give us time
for the snipers to get

270
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,000
a clean shot on Jerome,
Firefly and the others.

271
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,880
I wear this,
give you time to take them out.

272
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,760
- Correct.
- Are you sure it's gonna work?

273
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,960
I'm positive.

274
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,520
99 percent positive.

275
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,360
What are we waiting for?
They need our help.

276
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Good man.

277
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,160
Ra's owned this house
for as long as this city has existed.

278
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,400
He said he kept his secrets in here.
Ancient secrets.

279
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,720
None of us have ever seen
what's behind this door.

280
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,080
It remains locked
and there is no key.

281
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,160
Tried dynamite?

282
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,080
No need.

283
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,840
Our master chose you for a reason.

284
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,360
All my life

285
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,680
I have known
that I was meant for more.

286
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,360
That there was something deep
inside of me that I couldn't explain.

287
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,680
I'm home.

288
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,040
Sir, we got the target in sight.

289
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,120
<i>No way in from below the stage.</i>

290
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,640
<i>- Four my men have found positions.</i>
- Good. Stay low, hang tight.

291
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,000
No hair-triggers.

292
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,360
One missed shot means<i>adios</i>, mayor.

293
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,920
<i>Copy that.</i>

294
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,560
Standing by.

295
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,720
I watch the news.
I know why you're here, Mr. Gordon.

296
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,200
You must be out of your mind

297
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,600
if you think I'd be led
like a lamb to slaughter.

298
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,240
I understand your concern,
but your brother doesn't bluff.

299
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,880
If we ignore his demands,
there's no telling what he'd do.

300
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,800
We can block
his remote's signal with this.

301
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,000
If you and Bruce can get within
a few feet of him,

302
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,400
it'll disable his remote.

303
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,800
He'll be a sitting duck.
Our snipers can take it from there.

304
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,760
For God's sake, Gordon.
You have to know what he wants.

305
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,480
To murder us both on live television.

306
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,440
Mr. Valeska, I'm Bruce Wayne.

307
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,440
It's a pleasure to meet you.

308
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,960
Likewise. I wish
the circumstances were better.

309
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,720
May I ask what it is
you've been working on?

310
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,040
Yeah, it's a compact electrical
engine. It generates power.

311
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,200
Fascinating. How much power?

312
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,080
Just two could light up
every building south

313
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,240
of the Westward Bridge.

314
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,680
You have a brilliant mind.

315
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,920
We all hope we can soon be
rid of your brother

316
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,760
so you can carry out your work
free from fear.

317
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,480
I understand if you choose
not to help us today, but

318
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,560
I trust that Captain Gordon

319
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,840
and Mr. Fox will see that
no harm comes to me.

320
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,400
But even if it does

321
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,120
maybe, by facing Jerome

322
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,640
I can show the people of Gotham
that standing up to terror

323
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,800
is the only way
to take its power away.

324
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,280
Well, said.

325
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,560
Harvey?

326
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,800
Hey. Just got word that
Freeze and Scarecrow

327
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,200
broke into Wayne Industries' chemical
lab. Jerome's playing the long game

328
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,680
<i>but we're not sure what it is
unless we get ahead of him.</i>

329
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,320
The gas. Penguin told me
about a new Scarecrow toxin.

330
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,160
Head over to the lab,
we're on our way to the square.

331
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,760
They've got a weapon. Poison gas.

332
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
Okay, let's go.

333
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,640
Thank you.

334
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
You two.

335
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,600
Hey. Hey, buddy.

336
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,760
What happened? What's so funny?

337
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,160
No, no, no.

338
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,960
Hello.

339
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,760
Ma'am. Let me help you.

340
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,280
- What happened?
- They made us make it.

341
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,440
- Tons of it.
- Where is it?

342
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,400
It's gone, they took it.

343
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,400
<i>Why are we waiting</i>

344
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,520
<i>Ready, ready, ready
Someone's gonna die</i>

345
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,360
Well, look who decided to show up.

346
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,320
We were starting to get nervous

347
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,320
especially the mayor here.
My guest of honor.

348
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,720
Please, take your seats on stage.

349
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,560
Come on.

350
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,320
Don't be shy.

351
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,640
It's all right.

352
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,960
We don't have all day.

353
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,520
It's activated,
just let them get a little closer.

354
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,440
On my command.

355
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,160
<i>My men have all targets in view.</i>

356
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,280
Standing by.

357
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,040
Hi, brother.

358
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,600
Now.

359
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,720
Fire. All targets fire.

360
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,560
I had my guys take up
the best vantage points last night.

361
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,920
So they've been watching
your little SWAT team all day.

362
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,160
Now, Bruce, brother dear.

363
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,240
Get up on stage.

364
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,640
It's time to get
this party really started.

365
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,800
What are you doing here?
This is a restricted area.

366
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,760
Our cargo is too precious to waste.

367
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,400
Let me give you something
I like to keep

368
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,720
up my sleeve for times
just like these.

369
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Oh, my God!

370
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,160
You can pilot
this contraption alone, sir?

371
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,240
Yes.

372
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,160
Then look into my eyes.

373
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,000
The kidnappings,
the concert in the square?

374
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,560
All to draw the biggest crowds, so we
can drop the laughing gas on them.

375
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,200
This is madness.

376
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,240
I thought you'd appreciate
the beauty of it all.

377
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,360
But Jerome was right.

378
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,040
You know he anticipated
your betrayal?

379
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,920
That's right. You went to Gordon.

380
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,720
Judas.

381
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,240
Tie him up, put him on the blimp.

382
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,160
Jerome wants him
to have a bird's-eye view.

383
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,640
This book tracks Ra's legacy
dating back nine centuries.

384
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,840
Did you know he not
only overthrew governments

385
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,800
but infiltrated royal families?

386
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,080
Ra's influenced history.

387
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,960
He was a cult leader

388
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,400
and he still has
them brainwashed.

389
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,000
And what about me, am I brainwashed?

390
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,120
There are things written here
that could change

391
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,000
the way we view the past forever.

392
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,400
Perhaps I am the one
to bring that change to light.

393
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,040
Look.

394
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,320
This book was compiled
by shamans and mystics

395
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,520
from all over Eastern Asia
and the Middle East.

396
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,360
Shamans and mystics?
Give me a break.

397
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,640
It contains formulas for potions
and incantations said to raise demons

398
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,840
curse our enemies
and contact the dead.

399
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,160
This isn't you.

400
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,120
The Barbara I know would've already
sold this junk to the highest bidder.

401
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,320
Junk? This is my destiny.

402
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,800
And being with me and Selina
at the club? That isn't?

403
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,240
You begged me to partner with you.

404
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,720
Can't you see who that is up there?
That is me and Ra's 400 years ago.

405
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,880
Oh, please,
it doesn't even look like you.

406
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,320
It looks exactly like me. It is me.

407
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,320
I have finally found my true purpose.

408
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,840
I'm not gonna let
your jealousy distract me.

409
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,280
Ladies, escort Ms. Galavan
to the street.

410
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,440
I'll show myself out.

411
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:15,160
Actually, I think it's time my loyal
servants taught you some manners.

412
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,560
Why don't you do it?

413
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,480
Because I am the one true heir
of an immortal god's ancient dynasty

414
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,160
and I don't dirty my fingers
with the likes of you anymore.

415
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,800
No parent will admit it,
but everyone's got their favorites.

416
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,600
Right, brother?

417
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,360
The one who cleans their room,
does their homework.

418
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,360
Doesn't try to kill everybody.

419
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,000
Little Mister Perfect here

420
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,720
yeah, he was that guy.

421
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,720
He got adopted by rich folks.

422
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,320
Went to the top schools,
then a top college.

423
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,600
Meanwhile, I got dragged through
the circus by my depressed,

424
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,000
alcoholic mother.

425
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,280
Forced to clean up
elephant dung every day.

426
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,440
Who cares?

427
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,920
Do you know how big
those things are, folks?

428
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,000
But I know something
that Mommy and Daddy

429
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,000
they never knew.

430
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,600
You're as crazy as I am.

431
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,080
It's in your DNA.

432
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,680
See

433
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,840
we got the same blood
running through us.

434
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,200
We are practically identical.

435
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,040
You are a killer!

436
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,200
It's your nature.

437
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,960
Stop trying to fight it.

438
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,800
Take your best shot.

439
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,440
Hey, what the hell happened?

440
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,400
Snipers are dead. Get up on the roof,
take as many as you can.

441
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,440
All right. A bunch of chemicals
are heading this way.

442
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,400
Scarecrow had the Wayne chemists
mix it up.

443
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,600
That's why he's been stalling.
He wants a big crowd.

444
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,960
He's gonna release
the laughing gas right here.

445
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,400
We need to evacuate the area!
Get these people out of here!

446
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,680
Do whatever you have to,
get them out of here.

447
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,360
Time to kill this maniac
once and for all.

448
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,320
That was so good.

449
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,520
I love you.

450
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,880
Hey, hey, look up in the sky.

451
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,560
Holy crap.

452
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,400
Excuse me, sir, could you help me?

453
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,640
No can do, sport.

454
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,400
Gotta get this rig into position
for the boss.

455
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,680
And where is that?

456
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,600
Paisley Square.

457
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,760
Almost there.

458
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,040
Then I can drop the load.
With this lever.

459
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,760
You turn this thing around,
right now!

460
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,160
Can you not see that.

461
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,360
Like I said, pal, no can do.

462
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,040
<i>Keep coming.</i>

463
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,560
Get into position.

464
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,080
Holy moly.

465
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,440
Holy moly.

466
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,480
- Jim, are you seeing this?
- Yeah, get everyone out of here.

467
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,760
<i>I'm going after Jerome.</i>

468
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,080
- I can take it down with a shot.
- And risk spilling the chemicals?

469
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,920
Oh, yeah, right.

470
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,560
- Oswald?
<i>- Jim, Jim, help me.</i>

471
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,320
They knocked me out and now, I am
in some blimp with that horrible gas

472
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,640
and the pilot.
He's been hypnotized and I.

473
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,920
You're on the blimp?

474
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,120
Yes. Yes, you have to help me.

475
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,600
No, you're gonna help us.

476
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,960
You're near the river,
I need you to steer it over there.

477
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,840
Steer a blimp?

478
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,920
Are you out of your mind, Jim?
I don't even drive my own car.

479
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,080
You don't,
thousands will die, maybe worse.

480
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,800
What's worse than that?

481
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,080
How can you run an empire
in a city full of lunatics?

482
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,720
Hands up.

483
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,240
Beautiful, isn't she?

484
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,520
Just give me a second.

485
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,720
Gotta call the pilot,
tell him he's in position.

486
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,040
<i>Yes?</i>

487
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,040
- Not cool.
<i>- Jerome?</i>

488
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,480
<i>Jerome? I'm in position.</i>

489
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,440
It doesn't matter.

490
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,240
Too late anyway. Bombs away!

491
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,680
Funny.

492
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,680
- Go!
- Let's go.

493
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,240
Up, up, up.

494
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,320
Okay. Okay. Okay.

495
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,440
River. River, yeah, yeah,
we gotta reach the river.

496
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,120
Quite the dilemma, Jim.

497
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,120
You gonna let me fall and die?

498
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,560
Or are you gonna pull me up
and arrest me?

499
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,000
What's it gonna be?

500
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,200
Lawman? Or murderer?

501
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,720
Good old Gordon.

502
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,000
Always playing by the rules.

503
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,760
That's why I'll outlive you.

504
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,360
That's why I'm loved, because I don't
give a damn about the rules.

505
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,920
It's a long way down.
You sure you'll outlive me?

506
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,120
Oh, I'm sure,
because I'm more than a man.

507
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,720
I am an idea

508
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,440
a philosophy

509
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:46,840
and I will live on in the shadows
within Gotham's discontent.

510
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,280
I'll be seeing you soon.

511
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,360
<i>Au revoir!</i>

512
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,400
- Never thought I'd see this.
- Sure he is dead.

513
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,000
- He can't be.
- Is he?

514
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,760
Yeah.

515
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,840
Get back.

516
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,320
G.C.P.D. everybody get back.

517
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,680
Mr. Valeska

518
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,960
I meant what I said about your work
being of importance to this city.

519
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,280
Let Wayne Enterprises
fund your work with a grant.

520
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,440
Thank you.

521
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,480
Captain.

522
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,960
Oswald?

523
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,360
Hello.

524
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:45,080
Still here. Will someone please
get me the hell off of this thing?

525
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,200
All right, we're on it.

526
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,840
How do we get a blimp
down safely from over a river?

527
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,600
You asking me? I say we let him
stew up there for a few more hours.

528
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,080
We'll get ahold of the standby pilot,
have advise. Sit tight. All right?

529
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,280
And Oswald Cobblepot

530
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,120
- Gotham thanks you.
- Wait, Jim. Jim?

531
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,520
Jim? Jim?

532
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,120
Jim?

533
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,880
Jim!

534
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,480
Never touch me again.

535
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,120
Miss Kean has a new path
to take now.

536
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,640
- It no longer involves you.
- Is that so?

537
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,560
We will accept you leaving this city
and never coming back.

538
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,120
The only thing I'll accept
is you kissing my ass.

539
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,240
We are trained
by the League of Shadows

540
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,600
in 90 different forms of combat
since we were five-years-old.

541
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,120
Oh, yeah? Which one of you bitches
wants to go first?

542
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,560
Next time, we kill you.

543
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,040
Let me help you.

544
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,880
Who the hell are you guys?

545
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,320
The ones that have been watching you

546
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,280
and Barbara Kean, the imposter,
for quite some time.

547
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,880
We serve the one and only
true master, Ra's al Ghul.

548
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,680
But he's dead.

549
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,480
Death is only an illusion.

550
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,680
<i>Hello, brother.</i>

551
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,920
<i>Didn't think you could get
rid of me so easily, did you?</i>

552
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,000
<i>See, my days were numbered.</i>

553
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,680
<i>But you</i>

554
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,560
<i>oh, you can continue on for me.</i>

555
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,040
<i>Be my ultimate revenge.</i>

556
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,840
<i>So calm yourself.</i>

557
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,200
<i>Don't fight it.</i>

558
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,880
<i>Breathe it in.</i>

559
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:45,520
<i>This gas is a special mixture
I had made, just for you.</i>

560
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,960
<i>Something to finally set you free.</i>

561
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,040
<i>It's time to have some fun.</i>

562
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,920
<i>Burn it down, brother.</i>

563
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,680
<i>Burn it all down.</i>
