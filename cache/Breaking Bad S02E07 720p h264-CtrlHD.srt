1
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:19,645
<i>The city's called Duke
The state's called New Mexico</i>

2
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:30,031
<i>Among the gangsters
The gringos' fame is inflated</i>

3
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:35,327
<i>'Cause of the new drug they created</i>

4
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:49,467
<i>They say the colour is blue
And the quality pure</i>

5
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:59,643
<i>This potent drug's runnin'
Through the city</i>

6
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:04,982
<i>And no one could stop it
If they wanted to</i>

7
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:13,657
<i>The cartel's runnin' hot because
They weren't getting respect</i>

8
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:20,664
<i>Talkin' 'bout some "Heisenberg"
Who owns the market now</i>

9
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:27,421
<i>No one knows the man since
They've never seen his face</i>

10
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,676
<i>The cartel's 'bout respect
And they ain't forgiving</i>

11
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:39,433
<i>But that homey's dead
He just doesn't know it yet</i>

12
00:01:55,074 --> 00:02:01,664
<i>Heisenberg's fame has got
Down to Michoacan</i>

13
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:08,379
<i>From way far away
They want to taste that meth</i>

14
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:14,218
<i>That blue stuff has crossed the border</i>

15
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:23,853
<i>Now New Mexico's livin' up to its name</i>

16
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:37,408
<i>Looks just like Mexico
In all the drugs it's hiding</i>

17
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:43,789
<i>Except there's a gringo boss
And he's known as "Heisenberg"</i>

18
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,922
<i>The cartel's runnin' hot because
They weren't getting respect</i>

19
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,846
<i>Talkin' 'bout some "Heisenberg"
Who owns the market now</i>

20
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,479
<i>No one knows the man since
They've never seen his face</i>

21
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:10,858
<i>The fury of the cartel
Ain't no one escaped it yet</i>

22
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:15,279
<i>But that homey's dead</i>

23
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:18,783
<i>He just doesn't know it yet</i>

24
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,355
Nitrogen bonds to oxygen,
which in turn....

25
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:53,317
You do know what a bond is?

26
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:59,740
A strong force of attraction.

27
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:03,119
Covalent bonds, ionic bonds.

28
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:07,707
The coming together of atoms
and molecules to form compounds.

29
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,375
No?

30
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:15,589
Chemical bonds
are what make matter matter.

31
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:19,885
Bonds are what hold
the physical world together.

32
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:24,348
-What hold us together.
-Yeah. Yeah. No, I got it.

33
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:25,558
Bonds.

34
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:30,396
Your test score says otherwise.
It tells me you don't get it at all.

35
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:34,817
Yeah, but, I mean, 58. I was close.

36
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,408
What is "close"?

37
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,577
There's no "close" in science, Barry.

38
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,705
There are right answers
and wrong answers.

39
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,166
"Close" didn't put men on the moon.

40
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:54,420
Yeah, but I'm just saying, Mr. White,
two points?

41
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,591
Look, if I don't pass chemistry,
I have to go to summer school.

42
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:04,430
And, I mean, I really studied.
Like, really, really studied.

43
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,433
Like, all night, hard.

44
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:11,937
And, I mean, I'm so into chemistry
for, like, the concepts.

45
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:17,985
I just think I might have, you know,
the attention deficit....

46
00:05:18,194 --> 00:05:20,571
Couldn't you please
just let this slide?

47
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:32,792
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

48
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,423
The answer is no.
Next time, apply yourself.

49
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:26,012
<i>Yo. If I know you, leave a message.</i>

50
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,808
Are you ducking me, or what?
This makes the third time.

51
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:36,355
Look, I will be leaving this phone on
for another 15 minutes, so call me.

52
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:41,485
Oh, and by the way,
that thing we talked about, the....

53
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:44,363
When I said, "Handle it."

54
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:48,701
Well, don't. Just let it go.

55
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,411
All right.

56
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,390
Come on.

57
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,602
Jesse, open the door.

58
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,565
I know you're home. Your car is here.
Come on. Hey.

59
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:26,697
Can I help you?

60
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,367
No. Thank you.

61
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:33,871
Well, I'm the manager, so can we stop
with the pounding, please?

62
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,415
You're the manager?

63
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:39,085
Yes. Yes, you can help me.
Absolutely.

64
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:44,173
I very much need to get inside here,
so if you have a master key....

65
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:48,052
-You have a key, right?
-Yeah, I have a key.

66
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:53,557
Look, the person who lives here...

67
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:56,686
...it's just very important
for me to see him.

68
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:59,772
-And you knocked, right?
-Yeah.

69
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,982
He didn't answer?

70
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,527
Which means...?

71
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:12,201
-Look, I'm his father, all right?
-You're Mr. Jackson?

72
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:16,956
Yes. That's me. Walt Jackson.

73
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,165
And you are...?

74
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,752
-Jane.
-Jane. Very nice to meet you, Jane.

75
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:23,921
Now, if you wouldn't mind....

76
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,966
Mr. Jackson,
I'm happy to let you use my phone.

77
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,136
-Wanna call him?
-No.

78
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,014
No. I--

79
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,684
As I said, I would like
if you let me inside here...

80
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:40,354
...so that I can check on
my son's well-being.

81
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:42,148
You understand?

82
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:45,484
Look, whatever's going on
between the two of you is family.

83
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:47,486
I don't get involved in family.

84
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:49,989
Jesse doesn't want you in,
you're not getting in.

85
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,198
Period.

86
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:53,117
Sorry.

87
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:01,375
Come on in, Dad.

88
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,798
-Thanks.
-You okay?

89
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,801
Yeah.

90
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,602
"Jesse Jackson"?

91
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,562
Do you even...?

92
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:26,567
Oh, I see you have a telephone,
at least.

93
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:30,112
You know, that blinking thing
I've been calling you on?

94
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:32,448
Whatever, man.

95
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:38,079
-Hey, give me my-- Give--
-I will break this. I will break this!

96
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,832
Damned druggie idiot.
Is this what you've been doing...

97
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,210
...the whole time
I've been trying to reach you?

98
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:48,214
-No. I've been taking care of business.
-What business?

99
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:49,924
What business?

100
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:54,804
The business you put me on, asshole.
What, you already forgot?

101
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,562
This business.

102
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:09,902
Does that jog your memory?
Son of a bitch.

103
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,076
-You didn't actually--?
-Hey, you said--

104
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,537
You said, "Handle it,"
so, you know, I handled it.

105
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:22,707
When I said, "Handle it,"
I meant fear and intimidation.

106
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:24,875
I meant get your money back.
I never meant--

107
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:27,169
-Oh, didn't mean to kill somebody?
-No!

108
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:30,339
Well, too late, yo,
because dude's dead.

109
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:32,425
-Oh, God.
-All right? Way dead.

110
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:36,762
-Oh, God.
-Oh, and, hey, hey, hey. Here.

111
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,889
Here's your money.

112
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,895
Yeah, 4660 bucks. Your half.

113
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:50,609
Spend it in good health,
you miserable son of a bitch.

114
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:22,308
I didn't say I killed him.

115
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:26,145
Tell me what happened.

116
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,984
Dude's wife crushed his head
with an ATM machine.

117
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:35,488
-Crushed his--?
-Crushed his head...

118
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,741
...with an ATM machine
right in front of me.

119
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,993
I mean, crushed it like....

120
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:45,665
Oh, my God, the sound...

121
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,625
...it's still in my ears.

122
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,544
You know, and the blood,
like, everywhere.

123
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:56,008
Like, there was so much,
you would not believe.

124
00:11:56,217 --> 00:12:01,180
Man, will you just please give me--?
Just give me my weed, all right?

125
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:03,849
It helps with my nausea.

126
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:07,436
So...

127
00:12:08,104 --> 00:12:10,690
...you did not kill anyone?

128
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:14,527
Does anybody think
that you killed anybody?

129
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,570
I called the cops.

130
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,031
You called the cops?

131
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,743
Yeah. You know, I called,
and I split, you know?

132
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:25,037
And then they came in
and busted her.

133
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:29,709
God, she was--
She was so zapped out of her mind.

134
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:33,295
You know? It's....
She did it for, like, nothing.

135
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:37,008
I mean, he told her she was a skank,
but, yo, I mean, she was a skank.

136
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:42,555
Can this person identify you?
Can she identify you being there?

137
00:12:43,723 --> 00:12:47,476
She couldn't identify
her left ass cheek.

138
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:49,979
She was so zonked.

139
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,566
And she had this....

140
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:55,860
God, she had this kid.

141
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,488
Listen, I'm a little fuzzy
on the mechanics here...

142
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:04,660
...but could you not stop this woman
from killing this man?

143
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:08,664
Look, she had a gun on me,
all right?

144
00:13:15,338 --> 00:13:18,049
Yeah, my gun, okay? Mine.

145
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:20,092
Go ahead, say it. Say it.

146
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:24,305
No, I ain't no Tuco or Krazy-8.
I can't run a crew.

147
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:28,225
Come on. Come on. Point made, man.
Point made. Yes.

148
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:37,735
<i>Yo. If I know you, leave a message.</i>

149
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:40,946
<i>-Hey, it's Badger, man.
-What are you doing?</i>

150
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:44,950
<i>-Don't use your real name.
-What? That isn't my real name.</i>

151
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,203
<i>Okay.</i>

152
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:52,750
<i>Yo, we got those pants you wanted.
Thirty-two large, right?</i>

153
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,461
<i>We got them just for you, jefe.</i>

154
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,130
<i>Let's do some business, yo.</i>

155
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:08,641
So are you gonna
get back up on that horse?

156
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,978
No.

157
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:16,107
You get on. All right?

158
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:19,276
I just want to forget. I just....

159
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:30,121
Sorry.

160
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:44,218
Hey.

161
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:46,637
Hey, what's up with that?

162
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:51,350
Jesus Malverde,
patron saint of Mexican drug dealers.

163
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:54,186
Well, yeah, hell,
I know who it is, okay?

164
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:56,981
Scumbags kneeling down
praying to him:

165
00:14:57,189 --> 00:15:02,361
"Please, Señor Saint.
No DEA, please."

166
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:13,581
I'm just-- I'm just saying,
why's he on your desk?

167
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,501
Going after neo-Nazis,
you don't wear swastikas, right?

168
00:15:20,338 --> 00:15:23,132
-Sun Tzu.
-Son who?

169
00:15:23,341 --> 00:15:26,135
<i>Sixth-century Chinese general.
Wrote The Art of War.</i>

170
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,055
"If you know your enemy
as yourself...

171
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,807
...you'll fight without danger
in many battles."

172
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:37,229
Right on.

173
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:45,404
-Agent Schrader.
-Sir.

174
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,784
-Glad to have you onboard.
-Thanks.

175
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:53,871
-Everybody getting you settled in?
-Oh, yeah, yeah. Great group of guys.

176
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,416
And gals. And gals.
Guys-- Guys and gals.

177
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,336
Good. You couldn't have
picked a better time to arrive.

178
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:03,214
We're about to put a big dent
in the cartel. Right, Vanco?

179
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:05,049
Yes, sir.

180
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:36,831
Yo, bro, check it out.
It's a satellite picture of you farting.

181
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:40,793
"Fat Man and Little Boy."
Sounds like you two.

182
00:16:41,002 --> 00:16:44,630
I got your fat man in my pants, bitch.

183
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:51,971
-Hey, watch it.
-It ain't real, dumb-ass.

184
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,305
Just watch it, is all.

185
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:55,307
You watch it.

186
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,153
I'm Heisenberg.

187
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,822
You're Heisenberg?

188
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:12,074
Yeah, I remember you.
You were the cook.

189
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:14,577
Let's get this over with.

190
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,412
Where's Jesse?

191
00:17:17,163 --> 00:17:19,749
-Busy.
-Hey, that's cool.

192
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,375
Real cool.

193
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:23,127
Totally cool.

194
00:17:23,336 --> 00:17:24,795
Hey, hey--

195
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:29,550
It's all there, man. Every dollar.
Case you wanna, like, count it.

196
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,928
-Here?
-I'm just saying....

197
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:34,972
Just saying, like, we cool, yo.

198
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:37,308
Ain't got no confusions
and interpretations...

199
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:38,809
...as to who we work for.

200
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:42,229
And that's church, yo. For real.

201
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:48,986
What have you heard?

202
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:53,908
Did Jesse really...?

203
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:57,578
I mean, did he really...

204
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:02,625
...squash that dude's head
with an ATM machine?

205
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,168
Word.

206
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,675
Who's saying that?

207
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:14,929
Damn, man, it's all over town.
Everybody's like, "Whoa, snap."

208
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:17,807
Usually I gotta chase dudes down
for their money...

209
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:19,767
...but today everybody's paying up.

210
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:22,895
True that. Serious.

211
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:24,980
But, like....

212
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:27,858
He really did it?

213
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:40,162
You didn't hear that from me.

214
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,152
Big lunch.

215
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,580
Thank you.

216
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,671
-Here you go.
-Very good, Ms. White.

217
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,591
We'll consider your application
and let you know.

218
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,092
Thank you.

219
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:38,346
I'd just like to mention
that I have worked here before.

220
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:39,680
Really?

221
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:41,766
When are you due?

222
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:46,979
-Several months.
-Congratulations.

223
00:19:47,313 --> 00:19:51,942
I see. Accounting Department.
You left us four years ago?

224
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:53,569
Family.

225
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:57,782
We'll definitely let you know.
Thank you for coming by.

226
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:07,458
Actually, may I see Ted Beneke?
I-- I think he'll remember me.

227
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:10,461
Mr. Beneke's very busy today,
unfortunately.

228
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,963
You know, if it's okay, I'll just--

229
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:16,634
Ma'am--

230
00:20:30,231 --> 00:20:33,442
Skyler. Oh, my God, look at you.

231
00:20:33,651 --> 00:20:35,152
Hey, Ted.

232
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:37,655
-Come in, come in.
-Okay.

233
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:40,491
No calls, Margaret, thanks.

234
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,201
Come on, sit down right here.

235
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,662
Okay. Thank you.

236
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:51,502
-You look great.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

237
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,963
Boy or girl?
Or are you keeping it a secret?

238
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:56,507
Oh, it's a little girl.
We're very excited.

239
00:20:56,716 --> 00:20:59,468
I'll bet. One of each.

240
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:01,929
How's Walt Jr.?

241
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:05,766
Oh, 10th grade,
and he's just growing like a weed.

242
00:21:05,975 --> 00:21:07,518
He's-- He's taller than I am now.

243
00:21:08,394 --> 00:21:13,566
Yeah. I'm betting 6'3", 6'4"
by the time he's finished.

244
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:16,318
And, wow, handsome. Oh, my God.

245
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:18,112
Good genes.

246
00:21:21,741 --> 00:21:25,995
Speaking of movie stars,
those can't be the twins.

247
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:28,372
Oh, yeah. Yep. That's them.

248
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:30,708
-They're gorgeous.
-Yes, they are.

249
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,544
And they know it.

250
00:21:33,753 --> 00:21:35,546
I'm in real trouble there, huh?

251
00:21:35,755 --> 00:21:37,423
Yeah.

252
00:21:38,758 --> 00:21:41,761
So the big office, huh?

253
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,679
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

254
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:45,848
Weird, isn't it?

255
00:21:46,057 --> 00:21:48,392
I still think of it as my dad's.

256
00:21:48,601 --> 00:21:49,935
I miss him.

257
00:21:50,144 --> 00:21:51,687
Me too.

258
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:57,735
I'd like to think he'd be proud.
Last year was our best year yet.

259
00:21:58,194 --> 00:22:00,071
Yeah, he'd be proud.

260
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,783
Walt? How's he doing?

261
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:08,954
Oh, he's-- He is doing great.
Yeah. He's plugging away.

262
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:12,583
-Great. He's still teaching?
-Yeah.

263
00:22:12,792 --> 00:22:17,588
-You tell him I said hello.
-I will definitely do that.

264
00:22:21,676 --> 00:22:26,722
To be honest, Ted,
I didn't just stop by to say hello. I....

265
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,227
I was applying for the data-entry job.

266
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:34,271
You're kidding.

267
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,774
Skyler, you were, like,
our go-to bookkeeper.

268
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:39,443
Yeah. Well...

269
00:22:39,652 --> 00:22:42,113
...the economy, you know, so....

270
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:45,866
Well, you, data entry?
That'd be a mistake.

271
00:22:49,787 --> 00:22:51,580
How about...

272
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:54,583
...get your old job back?

273
00:22:56,836 --> 00:23:00,631
We're expanding, and, well,
between you and me...

274
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,134
...the whole department's
pretty much of a mess.

275
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:06,053
Your work would be cut out for you...

276
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:08,973
...but we could use your help.

277
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:16,480
Okay.

278
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:22,486
All right. Now, this is our territory,
right? Currently.

279
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:23,988
Hey. Hello.

280
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:26,532
-Yeah, man. Current. Whatever.
-Now, look at this.

281
00:23:26,741 --> 00:23:28,659
Here, here, here and here.

282
00:23:29,994 --> 00:23:31,954
What does that look like to you?

283
00:23:33,331 --> 00:23:36,584
Opportunities. Golden ones.
That's what that looks like.

284
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:40,379
No, look.
Look, it's an entire city full of buyers.

285
00:23:40,588 --> 00:23:42,340
Now, why aren't we exploiting that?

286
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:46,010
-Because it's not our territory?
-Because we lack initiative.

287
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:47,511
-Initiative.
-Yes.

288
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,680
You need to employ more dealers.

289
00:23:49,889 --> 00:23:52,224
Double, triple your crew.
Those three I met?

290
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:56,687
They should each have three, six, nine
sub-dealers working for them.

291
00:23:56,896 --> 00:23:58,939
Exponential growth,
that's the key here.

292
00:23:59,148 --> 00:24:04,904
It's not our territory, man.
Yo, you follow me here, huh?

293
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:07,782
We go rolling into
these neighbourhoods...

294
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,826
...other crews ain't gonna take kindly,
you understand?

295
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:13,704
Sure, they won't like it...

296
00:24:13,913 --> 00:24:16,791
...but I say they're not gonna
do a thing about it.

297
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,959
-No. Listen, Jesse--
-No.

298
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:20,795
Jesse.

299
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:28,010
The game has changed.
The word is out that you are a killer.

300
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:32,014
-What are you talking about?
-Apparently, it's all over town.

301
00:24:32,223 --> 00:24:34,725
Somebody crossed you,
you got angry...

302
00:24:34,934 --> 00:24:38,020
...you crushed their skull
with an ATM machine.

303
00:24:38,229 --> 00:24:40,231
-That's not how it happened.
-Who cares...

304
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:43,734
...as long as it's our competitors
who believe it and not the police?

305
00:24:43,943 --> 00:24:47,238
-Oh, my--
-No, don't you see how great this is?

306
00:24:48,948 --> 00:24:51,534
Look, you-- You are a....

307
00:24:54,787 --> 00:24:56,539
Jesse, look at me.

308
00:24:57,206 --> 00:25:00,334
You are a blowfish.

309
00:25:00,543 --> 00:25:02,753
-What?
-A blowfish. Think about it.

310
00:25:02,962 --> 00:25:07,091
Small in stature,
not swift, not cunning.

311
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:08,592
Easy prey for predators...

312
00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:11,095
...but the blowfish
has a secret weapon...

313
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:13,639
...doesn't he? Doesn't he?

314
00:25:13,848 --> 00:25:17,768
What does the blowfish do, Jesse?
What does the blowfish do?

315
00:25:20,563 --> 00:25:22,606
-I don't even know--
-The blowfish puffs up.

316
00:25:22,815 --> 00:25:26,652
The blowfish puffs himself up
four, five times larger than normal.

317
00:25:26,861 --> 00:25:29,447
And why? Why does he do that?

318
00:25:29,655 --> 00:25:32,325
So that it makes him intimidating,
that's why.

319
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:33,534
Intimidating.

320
00:25:33,743 --> 00:25:36,954
So that the other scarier fish
are scared off.

321
00:25:37,163 --> 00:25:39,915
And that's you. You are a blowfish.

322
00:25:40,124 --> 00:25:43,085
You see, it's just all an illusion.

323
00:25:43,294 --> 00:25:46,297
You see, it's nothing but air.

324
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,300
Now...

325
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:52,636
...who messes with the blowfish,
Jesse?

326
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:56,265
-Nobody.
-You're damn right.

327
00:25:57,433 --> 00:26:00,519
-I'm a blowfish.
-You are a blowfish.

328
00:26:00,728 --> 00:26:02,229
-Say it again.
-I'm a blowfish.

329
00:26:02,438 --> 00:26:04,315
-Say it like you mean it.
-I'm a blowfish.

330
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:07,401
-You're a blowfish. That's right.
-Yeah!

331
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,488
Blowfishing this up.

332
00:26:48,234 --> 00:26:49,527
Hello?

333
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:52,655
<i>The SkyMall.
Give me the SkyMall, would you?</i>

334
00:26:58,411 --> 00:26:59,829
Vanco...

335
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:03,582
...new guy don't speak Spanish.
What's up?

336
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:08,462
Hey, white boy,
better learn Español, huh?

337
00:27:08,671 --> 00:27:11,966
This ain't Branson, Missouri,
know what I'm talking about?

338
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:15,678
You know what? I'll teach you.

339
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,727
It means, "Let's make a deal."

340
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:25,229
So go ahead. We're waiting.

341
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:28,524
Okay.

342
00:27:30,693 --> 00:27:32,069
Right here.

343
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:34,989
"Item SS4G:

344
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:39,744
Yankee Stadium final season
commemorative baseball...

345
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:41,746
...hand-signed by Derek Jeter."

346
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:44,540
Vanco, write this down.

347
00:27:45,291 --> 00:27:47,126
Oh, man, watch out.

348
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:52,590
"661 00ZBG: large-size floor runner."

349
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:56,010
Look at that, huh?
It's a rug you put on the floor...

350
00:27:56,218 --> 00:27:59,096
...except for it looks like
a hundred-dollar bill.

351
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:03,559
<i>I love them. Get me 20 of them.
I'm gonna put them all over my casa.</i>

352
00:28:03,768 --> 00:28:04,935
We'll get you three.

353
00:28:05,144 --> 00:28:07,188
-No, you give me 10.
-Five.

354
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:12,568
Hey. How about you stop
jerking us off here?

355
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:19,909
Where's the meet?
When's it going down?

356
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:23,621
White boy don't like
let's make a deal, huh?

357
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:26,624
White boy's gonna kick your ass,
you don't stop wasting time.

358
00:28:26,832 --> 00:28:27,875
Schrader....

359
00:28:28,084 --> 00:28:34,548
Hey, white boy. My name's Tortuga.
You know what that means?

360
00:28:34,757 --> 00:28:39,220
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd say that's Spanish for "asshole."

361
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:44,016
Tortuga means "turtle." That's me.

362
00:28:47,061 --> 00:28:51,148
I take my time, but I always win.

363
00:28:54,694 --> 00:28:56,404
Oh, wait. That reminds me.

364
00:28:56,612 --> 00:28:59,115
I seen this earlier. Lookit.

365
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:03,244
This is awesome, homes.
Right there, look at that.

366
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:06,539
"The tranquil tortoise
garden sculpture."

367
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:08,416
Definitely two of those, huh?

368
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:12,169
Check it out, huh? Good likeness.

369
00:29:13,546 --> 00:29:16,048
Hank's doing great down there.
He's making inroads.

370
00:29:16,257 --> 00:29:18,801
I'm sure he is. He's a hero, after all.

371
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:22,096
So you gonna go down to El Paso?

372
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,765
Please. It's Third World enough
around here.

373
00:29:24,974 --> 00:29:26,559
They keep him busy every second.

374
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:28,769
He's already got some
big operation going.

375
00:29:28,978 --> 00:29:31,355
Some hush-hush deal
he couldn't tell me about...

376
00:29:31,564 --> 00:29:33,899
...except it's on the other side
of the border.

377
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:35,693
Wow, that sounds exciting.

378
00:29:36,444 --> 00:29:38,446
He's being safe, right?

379
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:40,740
Yeah.
He says he's mostly riding a desk.

380
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:43,951
Which, between you and me,
is just the way I want it.

381
00:29:44,702 --> 00:29:47,538
Speaking of riding desks...

382
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,707
...got myself a job today.

383
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:52,543
You did not.

384
00:29:55,296 --> 00:29:57,840
As big as you are?

385
00:29:59,425 --> 00:30:03,554
-Thank you.
-You know I just mean....

386
00:30:03,763 --> 00:30:05,389
Where? With who?

387
00:30:05,598 --> 00:30:09,310
Well, someone willing
to work around that, apparently.

388
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:10,519
Beneke.

389
00:30:10,728 --> 00:30:14,398
You did not.
Is Mr. Grabby-Hands still there?

390
00:30:14,607 --> 00:30:16,734
Marie, that was one time
at a Christmas party.

391
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:21,906
And he was so drunk,
he was practically slurring his words.

392
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:25,451
-Just what you want in an executive.
-And he apologised profusely.

393
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:29,246
Plus he's married with a family.
I'm sure he doesn't wanna get sued.

394
00:30:29,455 --> 00:30:32,166
It will not happen again.

395
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:36,712
Is money that tight?

396
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,258
Yeah.

397
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,470
You know we can always help out.

398
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:47,139
No, Marie.

399
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:49,016
You know Walt. He would just....

400
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:55,856
-Speak of the devil.
-Hey. Hi, Marie.

401
00:30:56,065 --> 00:30:57,775
How are you? What's up?

402
00:30:58,984 --> 00:31:00,736
Nothing much.
How's things with you?

403
00:31:01,237 --> 00:31:02,613
-Good. Good.
-Hi, honey.

404
00:31:02,822 --> 00:31:05,449
-Dinner will be about an hour and--
-Oh, thanks, sweetie.

405
00:31:05,658 --> 00:31:09,328
-Everything okay?
-Everything's perfect.

406
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:35,312
This is Raisin Bran,
not Raisin Bran Crunch.

407
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:37,523
So? Same thing.

408
00:31:37,732 --> 00:31:39,275
Not the same thing.

409
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:42,278
I'll tell you what, why don't you
do the grocery shopping?

410
00:31:42,737 --> 00:31:46,741
And then you can get
whatever you want. Great.

411
00:31:46,949 --> 00:31:52,038
It's-- It's not that hard, Mom.
It says "crunch" on the box.

412
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:53,456
You're pushing it.

413
00:31:53,664 --> 00:31:56,417
-Morning.
-Morning, honey.

414
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,669
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey.

415
00:31:58,878 --> 00:32:01,964
Dad, notice anything?

416
00:32:04,008 --> 00:32:05,634
Is there a funeral today?

417
00:32:05,843 --> 00:32:06,844
-A funeral?
-Well--

418
00:32:07,053 --> 00:32:09,180
-Oh, Christ, do I look that bad?
-No, no, no.

419
00:32:09,388 --> 00:32:11,474
Mom got a job.

420
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:13,100
A job? Why?

421
00:32:13,309 --> 00:32:15,853
Well, do I need to get out
the chequebook and show you?

422
00:32:16,062 --> 00:32:19,190
No, I.... Do you think it's a good idea
in your condition?

423
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:22,109
No, no. The doctor said I can work
up until I go into labour.

424
00:32:22,318 --> 00:32:25,696
And it's just an office job.
I'm just sitting on my butt.

425
00:32:27,365 --> 00:32:28,574
Where?

426
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:30,993
Beneke.

427
00:32:31,202 --> 00:32:33,788
I'm back working
in the Accounting Department.

428
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:37,667
Skyler, what about the welding fumes?
Isn't that why you had to quit...

429
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:40,878
-...in the first place?
-They've gone green since then.

430
00:32:41,087 --> 00:32:44,757
They have some kind of
green welding or something.

431
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:47,718
I didn't smell anything
when I was in there.

432
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:51,806
Didn't Mr. Beneke pass away?

433
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:53,140
Yeah.

434
00:32:53,349 --> 00:32:54,392
Who's running things?

435
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,852
Ted. The son.

436
00:32:58,938 --> 00:33:02,400
Anyway, I have got to go.

437
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:06,195
I don't wanna be late
my first day back.

438
00:33:06,404 --> 00:33:08,155
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

439
00:33:08,364 --> 00:33:10,157
-Bye.
-Bye.

440
00:33:10,366 --> 00:33:11,784
Okay.

441
00:33:12,702 --> 00:33:15,371
-Wish me luck.
-Good luck.

442
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:19,750
Bye.

443
00:33:31,637 --> 00:33:33,139
Hey.

444
00:33:34,724 --> 00:33:36,726
You left your cave.

445
00:33:37,226 --> 00:33:38,936
Yeah.

446
00:33:39,145 --> 00:33:41,772
I was-- I'm missing my TV.

447
00:33:41,981 --> 00:33:43,357
Thinking maybe I'd hit Costco.

448
00:33:43,566 --> 00:33:46,110
You know,
snag a big-ass wide-screen.

449
00:33:47,028 --> 00:33:48,571
So....

450
00:33:48,988 --> 00:33:50,489
Yeah.

451
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,825
What you drawing?

452
00:33:55,745 --> 00:33:56,746
Damn.

453
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:58,331
That's good.

454
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:00,207
Make a hell of a tat.

455
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:01,542
That's the plan.

456
00:34:01,751 --> 00:34:02,918
Really?

457
00:34:03,127 --> 00:34:05,963
I work part-time, down at ABQ Ink.

458
00:34:06,172 --> 00:34:07,256
Right on.

459
00:34:08,299 --> 00:34:11,969
Yo, you're a real good drawer.

460
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:14,764
I used to do a little of that.

461
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:19,352
You used to be a drawer too, huh?

462
00:34:22,313 --> 00:34:23,981
What stopped you?

463
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:29,320
You know, just....

464
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:31,447
So tell me something.

465
00:34:31,656 --> 00:34:36,035
What kind of tattoo artist
has no tattoos?

466
00:34:37,828 --> 00:34:40,164
That's way too big a commitment.

467
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:52,593
Hey, man. You're Pinkman.

468
00:34:54,845 --> 00:34:57,181
You're the man!
Everybody's been talking about you.

469
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,849
Yeah.

470
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,435
Right on, man. Keep it real.

471
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:10,069
"Pinkman," huh?

472
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:11,696
Yeah.

473
00:35:11,988 --> 00:35:14,156
I thought your name was "Jackson."

474
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,550
Well, your snitch
is really earning his nickname.

475
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:34,010
Are we...?

476
00:35:34,218 --> 00:35:35,720
Are we just on mañana time?

477
00:35:35,928 --> 00:35:37,263
They'll show.

478
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:40,224
Yeah? Why is that?

479
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:43,352
You got more catalogues
for him to clean out?

480
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:47,231
Maybe a little Sharper Image
or Pottery Barn?

481
00:35:51,152 --> 00:35:53,154
What the hell are they thinking?

482
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:55,865
Sending us some loudmouth
who doesn't speak the language?

483
00:35:56,115 --> 00:35:58,284
Politics, man. Politics.

484
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,249
Supposed to be some hotshot hero.
I say it's a bunch of crap.

485
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:10,755
Hero for Albuquerque, maybe.
Maybe it don't take much up there.

486
00:36:12,506 --> 00:36:14,717
Hey, something
I need to know about?

487
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:17,303
What? Oh, that? No, man.

488
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:20,473
We were just singing your praises.

489
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:21,974
Glad to have you.

490
00:36:22,183 --> 00:36:23,934
Welcome aboard.

491
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,040
Hey, is that your guy?

492
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:49,877
Hey, I think that's your guy.

493
00:36:51,212 --> 00:36:53,297
What the hell
is he doing down there?

494
00:38:00,323 --> 00:38:01,949
Schrader, where you going?

495
00:38:03,117 --> 00:38:06,871
We need an evidence bag, right?
A pretty big one.

496
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:11,042
What's the matter?
You act like you never saw...

497
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,544
...a severed human head
on a tortoise before.

498
00:38:25,014 --> 00:38:27,558
Hey, welcome to--

499
00:38:53,209 --> 00:38:54,710
My leg.

500
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:18,484
<i>--headed by Werner Heisenberg,
were also undertaken during the war.</i>

501
00:39:18,693 --> 00:39:21,112
The game has changed, yo.

502
00:39:21,654 --> 00:39:24,115
This is our city, all right?

503
00:39:24,323 --> 00:39:26,867
All of it. The whole damn place.

504
00:39:27,076 --> 00:39:29,120
Our territory.

505
00:39:29,495 --> 00:39:31,122
We're staking our claim...

506
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:35,084
...that we sell when we want,
where we want.

507
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:38,045
Now, we're gonna be kings,
understand?

508
00:39:38,254 --> 00:39:39,797
Well, I'm gonna be king.

509
00:39:40,006 --> 00:39:42,466
You guys will be princes
or dukes or something.

510
00:39:42,675 --> 00:39:45,302
-I wanna be a knight.
-But first things first.

511
00:39:45,845 --> 00:39:47,596
We gotta get more dealers.

512
00:39:47,805 --> 00:39:50,307
You know, foot soldiers, right?

513
00:39:50,516 --> 00:39:52,309
Now, they'll be working for you.

514
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:55,604
You're working for me,
and they're working for you.

515
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,898
You follow me?

516
00:39:58,107 --> 00:39:59,900
Layered, like nachos.

517
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:01,819
Exponential growth.

518
00:40:02,028 --> 00:40:05,614
Now, that's success
with a capital S.

519
00:40:05,823 --> 00:40:07,366
Straight up, straight up.

520
00:40:07,575 --> 00:40:08,576
For shizzle.

521
00:40:08,784 --> 00:40:09,827
Frigging awesome.

522
00:40:21,714 --> 00:40:23,382
Well, we're set.

523
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:27,094
Our boys are ready.
Gonna be some mad cheddar, yo.

524
00:40:28,054 --> 00:40:29,388
Cheddar, Mr. White.

525
00:40:29,597 --> 00:40:33,809
Fat stacks, dead presidents,
cash money.

526
00:40:35,436 --> 00:40:37,104
Gonna own this city.

527
00:40:37,897 --> 00:40:39,357
We're not charging enough.

528
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:41,984
What?

529
00:40:42,777 --> 00:40:45,321
You corner the market,
then raise the price.

530
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:48,157
Simple economics.

531
00:41:08,678 --> 00:41:11,055
Oh, hey, Ted. Come on in.

532
00:41:11,263 --> 00:41:14,183
-Looks like they got you all set up.
-Yeah. It's perfect.

533
00:41:14,392 --> 00:41:17,395
I am close enough to the bathroom
that I don't have to waddle far.

534
00:41:17,603 --> 00:41:18,604
And that's very nice.

535
00:41:18,813 --> 00:41:21,065
-I figured that might be a deal-breaker.
-Yeah.

536
00:41:22,775 --> 00:41:23,985
Listen, I....

537
00:41:25,361 --> 00:41:28,197
I wanted to thank you
for having me back.

538
00:41:28,948 --> 00:41:31,242
You don't have to thank me.
I need you.

539
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:38,582
Wow, Ted, it's a little early
for wine, isn't it?

540
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:40,418
Oh, damn. It's grape juice.

541
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:42,920
Been making the girls
breakfast in the morning.

542
00:41:43,129 --> 00:41:44,588
Hey, how is Denise doing?

543
00:41:45,798 --> 00:41:47,591
We split up, about a year ago.

544
00:41:49,677 --> 00:41:51,095
I'm sorry.

545
00:41:51,971 --> 00:41:54,640
She's definitely happier now.
I guess I am too, most days.

546
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:57,435
-Together since high school.
-Yeah.

547
00:41:57,643 --> 00:41:59,603
-I remember that.
-Anyway....

548
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:02,690
I don't know, people change.

549
00:42:02,982 --> 00:42:03,983
Yes.

550
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:06,777
Anyway, I just wanted
to welcome you.

551
00:42:06,986 --> 00:42:09,488
Welcome you back. And....

552
00:42:09,697 --> 00:42:12,199
I'll see you around
the vending machines.

553
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,909
Okay.

554
00:42:17,413 --> 00:42:18,998
We should have lunch one day.

555
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:20,458
Like old times.

556
00:42:21,334 --> 00:42:22,793
Sure.

557
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:57,221
Oh, hey.

558
00:43:58,055 --> 00:43:59,765
Hey, yourself.

559
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:06,731
So listen. My....

560
00:44:07,273 --> 00:44:09,984
My name is not really
Jesse Jackson.

561
00:44:12,695 --> 00:44:14,822
It's Jesse Pinkman.

562
00:44:15,031 --> 00:44:17,908
And that guy you met...

563
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:22,830
...he's not my dad.

564
00:44:31,547 --> 00:44:35,551
You're not gonna kick me out,
are you?

565
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,596
Because I actually really like it here.

566
00:44:40,514 --> 00:44:42,892
I don't make it my business
what you do.

567
00:44:43,726 --> 00:44:46,020
So long as you don't do it here.

568
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:56,572
So, hey, I got this kick-ass
new flat-screen.

569
00:45:00,326 --> 00:45:02,078
Wanna see?

570
00:45:29,355 --> 00:45:31,816
It's got that thing where the blacks...

571
00:45:32,024 --> 00:45:36,153
...are, like, you know,
really, really, really black.

572
00:45:36,862 --> 00:45:41,701
And the Dolby six-point-whatever.

573
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:46,038
So it'll really rock the house.

574
00:45:46,998 --> 00:45:48,708
But I'll, you know....

575
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:54,171
I'll keep it way down, of course.

576
00:46:04,223 --> 00:46:07,351
I don't know what the hell
is taking so long.

577
00:46:10,563 --> 00:46:13,524
Come on, come on.
