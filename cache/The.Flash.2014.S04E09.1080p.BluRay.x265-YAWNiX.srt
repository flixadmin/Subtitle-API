00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,417
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,496
<i>I now pronounce you
husband and wife.</i>

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,289
I think it's time you introduce
these guys to your mean roommate.

4
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,091
Tell Amunet I'm done.

5
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,051
Nobody walks away from me, Frost.

6
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,550
So, you think DeVoe and his wife
are supervillains?

7
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:16,802
<i>Who are you, really?</i>

8
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,555
<i>I was born
on the same evening you were.</i>

9
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,262
I know every answer
to every question ever asked.

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,431
Incredible. Clifford!

11
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,479
<i>Your body's deteriorating
faster than the chair can handle.</i>

12
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,526
It will survive long enough.

13
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:37,485
What are you doing?

14
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:39,904
Tinsel.

15
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,911
Your tinsel-to-surface ratio
is terrible.

16
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,454
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm not kidding you.

17
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,663
I've done extensive research
to make sure that this tinsel

18
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,418
is properly proportioned for this tree.

19
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,090
- It's terrible.
- "It's terrible"?

20
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,257
- I'll tell you what's terrible.
- What?

21
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,676
Your Scrooge-to-Grinch
ratio is terrible.

22
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,470
You're a mean one. I wouldn't touch you
with a 39-and-a-half foot pole.

23
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,173
- Haven't heard that one before.
- Yeah.

24
00:00:58,267 --> 00:00:59,849
Hey, Cisco. Where's Gypsy?

25
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:04,100
She had to work the holiday shift,
but I think I got her the perfect gift.

26
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,933
A Gulag-class mech knife
forged in the unholy blood-fires

27
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,268
of Earth-22 by none other than

28
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:11,728
- Wells 2.0.
- Wells 2.0.

29
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,190
Of course, Gypsy should've
sent something for me by now.

30
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,403
Awkward.

31
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,025
I'm sure it's fine.

32
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,110
Yikes.

33
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,321
Did Rudolph
just diarrhea all over your tree?

34
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,702
Cool. Cool. Two humbugs.
It's a Festivus miracle.

35
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,704
No, don't get me wrong.
Ralphy loves Christmas.

36
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,626
I ring in every holiday season
with my nana.

37
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,921
<i>She never remembers me but I am getting
that inheritance.</i>

38
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,336
You are just incorrect.

39
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,626
<i>If you don't want to spend Christmas
conning your grandma,</i>

40
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:38,971
you're more than welcome to join
your friends at the West family party.

41
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,053
Extremely obvious. I saw that.

42
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,009
And, by the way,
that sounds like a snooze fest.

43
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,930
Unless, of course,
you're serving baking soda!

44
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,398
Baking soda!

45
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,568
What... Sorry, what's that about?

46
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,655
Well, it's a bit of an inside joke.

47
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,484
- Actually, concerning Killer Frost.
- Classic Killer Frost.

48
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,611
You guys were
hanging out with Killer Frost?

49
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:02,695
Oh, yeah.

50
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,870
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

51
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,409
I hope you had a great time.

52
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,788
We had the best time.

53
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,957
I mean, you're great, Snow Cone,
but my girl Frostbite...

54
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,122
Come on.

55
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,542
I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee.

56
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,545
- Caitlin.
- Caitlin.

57
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,050
Hey, if you see my girl
K-Frost later,

58
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,015
tell her what I said
about the baking soda.

59
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,059
- Dibny.
- Too much?

60
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:35,691
Okay. From Oliver and Felicity...

61
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:40,734
We have an espresso machine. All right.

62
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,527
Okay, not on the registry.

63
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,783
But I guess getting married

64
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,330
during our wedding
wasn't on the registry either.

65
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,329
- So, yeah, sure. I'm not bitter.
- All right.

66
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,544
I'll put this in the return pile.

67
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,872
Well, I guess that's everything.

68
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,547
No, we got one more.

69
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:56,841
There's no card.

70
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,418
Um...

71
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,879
Great, it's another set of knives.

72
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,683
It's not even a full set.
Yeah, it's one knife.

73
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,601
- That's just shoddy gifting.
- Let me see.

74
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,011
I'm gonna clean up.

75
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,652
So, what, no speed cleaning today?

76
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,562
No, we're not in a rush.

77
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,741
Barry, you barely
used your powers in Bali, either.

78
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,238
I mean,
not even to put on suntan lotion.

79
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,156
It was a spray-on bottle.

80
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,159
What is going on, Barr?

81
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,956
Nothing.

82
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,494
I mean, I don't know.
I have been thinking recently that...

83
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:38,375
You know, when I first got my powers,
I would use any excuse to use them.

84
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,959
<i>It would just be me and the road</i>

85
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,794
and everything around me
would disappear.

86
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:46,846
It's like the first time in my life
I really felt like I was at peace.

87
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,601
<i>I just...</i>

88
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,220
Feel like that all the time now.

89
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,768
I don't have to run when I'm with you.

90
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:56,517
Aw.

91
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:58,937
So sweet.

92
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,316
I love you, Iris West Allen.

93
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,318
I love you, too.

94
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,463
Let me.

95
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,553
The atrophy of my fine
motor skills is accelerating.

96
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,813
I'm so sorry, my love.

97
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,144
The pain is but fleeting.

98
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,480
- After all, today is the day.
- How fitting.

99
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,366
You'll share a birthday
with the Messiah.

100
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,496
The Nazarene wasn't born until spring.

101
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,620
<i>You can check the constellation patterns
to verify that.</i>

102
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,214
You've heard this lecture before,
haven't you?

103
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,420
Maybe.

104
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,382
But I will never grow tired
of hearing your voice.

105
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,801
The words are still mine
even if the voice isn't.

106
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,856
Do you have any doubts?

107
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,519
No, of course not.

108
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,986
It will just take some getting used to.

109
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,743
Don't be afraid, my love.

110
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,206
This is the great work.

111
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:47,212
I swear,
I will stand beside you in your time.

112
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,272
Ho, ho, ho!

113
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,612
<i>Well, let's see...</i>

114
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,699
Dark roast. The light roast...

115
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,448
What are you having,
the self-pity roast?

116
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,699
I wish.

117
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,751
- "The Killer Frost."
- Finally got a drink. Woo-hoo.

118
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,454
I'm thrilled that she helped everybody
fight the Reichsmen,

119
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,540
but now it's like I can't escape her.

120
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,625
Everybody keeps saying,
"Killer Frost is so funny.

121
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,051
"Killer Frost is so badass."

122
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,345
I spent so long worried
that she was gonna hurt people.

123
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:33,675
But now, turns out people would rather
hang out with my villainous alter-ego.

124
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,476
Look, I...

125
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,771
I get it. I know what it's like
to have the evil doppelganger,

126
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,644
but you're not like me anyways.

127
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:44,478
No, you're different. You're special.

128
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:50,613
And your friends would much rather
be with you than with her.

129
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,947
- Thanks, Harry.
- You're welcome.

130
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,760
Ho, ho, ho.

131
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,806
This is like a lifetime supply
of store credit.

132
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,350
Why would Rory think that
we needed 40 toasters?

133
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,769
He said that there was some
kind of fire sale...

134
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,684
- He stole them. Yeah.
- He definitely stole them.

135
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,980
Barry!

136
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,819
Caity!

137
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,779
- That's Amunet.
- Hide. Hide. Hide.

138
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,626
I blocked your Glock.

139
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,175
Hello, Iris. My deepest congratulations
on your wedding.

140
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,187
No, no, no, dear.

141
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,066
Frosty melted away.

142
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,940
I've come for you, Caity.

143
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,943
- You okay?
- Yeah.

144
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,319
I'll be right back.

145
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,078
Barry!

146
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,095
DeVoe. He attacked us on the street.

147
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,512
- He took Barry.
- What?

148
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,886
- Are you kidding me?
- What happened to you?

149
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,184
Amunet Black abducted Caitlin.

150
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,099
Two people go missing at the same time.
That's quite a coinky-dink.

151
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,226
Yeah, that's a great observation,
Captain Obvious.

152
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,683
Can you set the satellite
to look for Caitlin's cryokinetic energy

153
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,393
or Barry's Speed Force signatures?

154
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,399
No. No.
We've got to look for both of them.

155
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,823
Cisco, I need you to vibe Barry.
I need to know that he's alive.

156
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,657
Holy poltergeist.

157
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,167
Hey. Are you okay?

158
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,587
Yeah, I'm just not gonna be vibing again
for a while.

159
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,663
What about Allen?

160
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,965
Wherever he is,
I've never experienced anything like it.

161
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,028
Hello?

162
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,260
Here we are.

163
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,553
Really moving up in the world.

164
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:11,814
You know, a sprinkle of enthusiasm
would not kill you.

165
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,519
Listen, Amunet,
whatever it is you have planned,

166
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,397
I guarantee you Killer Frost
wants nothing to do with it.

167
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,984
It's all right, darling.
I don't need her. I need you.

168
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,448
Meet your patient.

169
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,908
What have you done?

170
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,003
There's no need to be overdramatic.
He's alive.

171
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,004
And I'm sure he'd be happy to meet you,

172
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,129
just as soon
as that tranquilizer wears off.

173
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,051
Why do you have him? What is he to you?

174
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,425
My golden goose.

175
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,802
You see, Dominic here
is a delightful new meta

176
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,634
that I "found."

177
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,346
And I'd intended on selling him,

178
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,523
but unfortunately, he did not want to
go so gently into the good night.

179
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,770
And...

180
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,696
- I shot him.
- That is...

181
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,274
In desperate need of medical attention.
I know.

182
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,902
And now you know
why I need you, Caity, MD.

183
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,612
You're talking about an intricate

184
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,242
cranial foreign body
retraction, at best.

185
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,448
At worst, that's an...

186
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,749
I'm gonna stop you there

187
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,872
'cause I have absolutely no idea
what you're saying.

188
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,705
But, you see, it does not matter.

189
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,007
Because I knew that you would understand
what needed to happen.

190
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,670
Amunet, I won't. I can't.

191
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,507
This environment isn't sterilized,
the equipment is ancient.

192
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,479
I suppose I could
just yank it out myself.

193
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,603
And risk him bleeding out
or a dozen other brain deficits.

194
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,276
Right. Good point.

195
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,737
Well, there's only one way to find out.

196
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,944
No. No.

197
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,405
I'll do what I can.

198
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,746
Excellent.

199
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,542
Oh! I almost forgot.

200
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,461
Should he die,

201
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,288
you die as well.

202
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:02,090
This Killer Frost iced mocha
is really delicious.

203
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,816
Hello, Mr. Allen.

204
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,453
Not exactly S.T.A.R. Labs.

205
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,832
- Who are you?
- My name is Caitlin Snow,

206
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,748
and you're in St. Andrew's Hospital.
At least, I think that's where we are.

207
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,673
This place has been closed down
for a while.

208
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,377
Please, you have to help me
get out of here.

209
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,928
Easier said than done.

210
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,681
That blonde lady, she took you, too?

211
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,474
God, I don't understand
why this is happening to us.

212
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,063
Dominic, do you know
what a meta-human is?

213
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,062
Listen, I didn't do anything wrong.

214
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,984
- I didn't rob a bank or something.
- No, I know.

215
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,609
People with abilities, people like you,

216
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,612
they're a commodity, especially...

217
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:06,909
Especially to Amunet.

218
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,404
Yeah.

219
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,248
Listen, I'm gonna be honest with you.

220
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,543
It would be very difficult to fix
what she did to you,

221
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,622
even under the best of circumstances
with the right equipment.

222
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,174
But I feel fine.
My head doesn't even hurt.

223
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,220
Which is a minor miracle.
But if that shard were to fracture...

224
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,640
It could cause permanent motor skills
or permanent brain deficits.

225
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,351
How did you...

226
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,976
You have telepathic abilities.

227
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,441
Can you hear
what I'm thinking right now?

228
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,319
When did I get my powers?

229
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,897
A couple months ago.

230
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,569
I took the bus to my job
at the airport. TSA.

231
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:50,903
<i>But when I got there,</i>

232
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,365
it was like everyone was yelling at me,
screaming mad,

233
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:55,870
but their mouths weren't moving.

234
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,581
It only works when I'm close enough
to see someone.

235
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,669
You don't think
we're getting out of here?

236
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,176
I'm gonna do
everything I can to fix you,

237
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,633
but I can't get you away from her.

238
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,506
Not on my own.

239
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,091
<i>Caitlin.</i>

240
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,597
I'm scared, too.

241
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,560
Wow.

242
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,982
What an entrance.

243
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,938
So, where are we?

244
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,104
This is your sanctuary?

245
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,148
What gave that away?

246
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,820
DeVoe, if you wanted to kill me,

247
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,870
you could have just electrocuted me
on the street. So...

248
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,198
I'm here for a reason.

249
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,829
Yes, Mr. Allen.
So that I may teach you.

250
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:41,287
I am, after all,
first and foremost a teacher.

251
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,039
God.

252
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,970
All right. Fine. Teach me.

253
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,305
<i>But first I wanna make sure
I'm all caught up.</i>

254
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,722
You sent your Samuroid after me.

255
00:14:56,521 --> 00:15:00,561
You arranged to pull me
out of the Speed Force.

256
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:05,357
You made sure that we turned
all those people on that bus

257
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,062
into meta-humans.

258
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,071
Why?

259
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:13,493
You see, the finer points of my agenda
are not part of today's syllabus.

260
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,661
Come on. We can squeeze it in.
I'm a fast learner.

261
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:20,789
Please. You're about as capable
of seeing the breadth of my machinations

262
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,996
as an infant mastering
multivariable physics.

263
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,419
Well...

264
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,001
But the lesson I have prepped for today
is much more simple.

265
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,548
<i>Life 101.</i>

266
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,927
There are no happy endings.

267
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:37,976
<i>Oh.</i>

268
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,511
We have a guest.

269
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,362
DeVoe...

270
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:52,158
You should learn to lose
every once in a while, Barr.

271
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,493
A little humility will prepare you
for what lies ahead.

272
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,163
Now, if you will excuse me.

273
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,948
DeVoe!

274
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,374
If you hurt him...
If you put a hand on him...

275
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,171
DeVoe!

276
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,714
DeVoe!

277
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,632
<i>It's open.</i>

278
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,138
Good evening, Detective West.

279
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:20,644
Now, something tells me

280
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,813
you're not here for more
of my wife's world-famous lemonade.

281
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,106
Where's my son?

282
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,227
Mr. Allen? Has he gone missing?

283
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:32,110
He's not missing. He was taken.
By someone I am eager to meet.

284
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,776
Thinly-veiled threats aside, Mr. West,

285
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,037
I'm afraid I have not a clue
as to Barry Allen's location.

286
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,992
I do know, however, that your colleague
is located behind my front porch,

287
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,544
carrying an ionic subrepeating
pulse firearm.

288
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,509
But the birdbath
it's a much better vantage point.

289
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,382
A smart man
would've taken up position there.

290
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:58,140
A smarter man would understand
that this gun has no safety

291
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,013
and my finger is still on the trigger.

292
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,479
Is there something you find funny?

293
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,146
Well, it has occurred to me that
there is an amusing irony at play,

294
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,068
you being a detective and all,

295
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,857
yet you fail to acknowledge

296
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,611
the most basic result
in missing-children cases.

297
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,691
And what would that be?

298
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,446
Perhaps your son just ran away.

299
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,372
- Joe...
- Now, I do have

300
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,620
a restraining order against your son.

301
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,084
Shall I add you to the list?

302
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,456
If something happened to Barry,

303
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,631
there ain't a restraining order on Earth
that would keep me from getting you.

304
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:35,336
- I'm coming back with a search warrant.
- Completely unnecessary, Detective.

305
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:39,013
If you desire to search my abode,

306
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,431
by all means.

307
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,066
- You're not as smart as you think.
- Yes, I am.

308
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,991
You're only hurting yourself.

309
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,875
Running faster than sound,
vibrating through walls,

310
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,581
even throwing lightning...

311
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,759
None of that can destroy this barrier.

312
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,173
You know a lot about my abilities.

313
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,684
Is that why I'm here?

314
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,812
DeVoe wants my powers?

315
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,601
You don't have to do this.

316
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,982
Whatever he has planned,
you don't have to help him.

317
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,941
A helper. Is that what you think I am?

318
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,824
A mindless minion
carrying out her master's bidding?

319
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,363
Some sort of evil secretary?

320
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:45,618
You tell me.

321
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,574
No, Mr. Allen.

322
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:53,289
I am now, and forever will be,
my husband's partner.

323
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,334
I understand that.

324
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,760
You're not the only one

325
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,429
who promised to stand by your loved one
for better or for worse.

326
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,675
In sickness and in health.

327
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,264
<i>If you go down this path with DeVoe,</i>

328
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:11,019
can't you see that you risk sacrificing
everything that you have together?

329
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,440
Your entire marriage.

330
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,518
You're missing the point.

331
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,195
I am willing to sacrifice everything
for my marriage.

332
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,365
I'd ask if you could do the same,
but there's no need.

333
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,946
My husband already knows.

334
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,779
His body may be human,

335
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,790
but his brain is smarter than yours.

336
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,220
- Zark me!
- What happened?

337
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:46,050
Well, the satellite's trying to search
for Barry's Speed Force energy

338
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,975
and Caitlin's cryokinetic signature,

339
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:50,019
so the bandwidth limiters
are overheating.

340
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,060
Well, that's what you get
when you rely on machines

341
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,561
rather than a master private eye.

342
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,484
I've had a ton a missing-person cases.

343
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,819
There was this wife once,

344
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,522
turns out she faked her own death,
she was just living in Arizona.

345
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,408
Are you saying Barry faked his own death
and moved to Arizona?

346
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,577
Well, no.

347
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,112
Well, then shut up.

348
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,279
Oh, boy.

349
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,116
Tell me you got something.

350
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:12,747
Got nothing.

351
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,669
<i>Searched the DeVoe house thoroughly.
It's clean.</i>

352
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,956
Your father's gone to check the scene
from where Barry was taken.

353
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,175
You know,
there was this other case once.

354
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:23,004
A woman couldn't find her husband.
Turns out she just had amnesia.

355
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,721
He was home,
she just didn't recognize him.

356
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,719
And I still got paid. Twice.

357
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,015
Ralph.

358
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:32,559
Please, shut up.

359
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,857
You got something
you wanna say to me, Ramon?

360
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,059
Yeah.

361
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,819
Yeah, I got something to say to you,
Ralphy boy.

362
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,696
Caitlin's been kidnapped.

363
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,445
Of course, she wouldn't have been
at Jitters in the first place

364
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,527
if you hadn't acted
like such a jackass today

365
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,279
but of course,
in true Ralph Dibny fashion,

366
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,535
you drove her away with your fat mouth!

367
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,992
Maybe I should turn my hand
into a fat fist?

368
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,918
- Oh, yeah?
- Hey, guys, cool it.

369
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,330
Listen, the people we love are in danger

370
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,881
and you two can't get it together?

371
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:01,879
Really?

372
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,043
Whatever.

373
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:05,795
I'll be in my lab.

374
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:11,096
And I will be in whatever room
is farthest from that.

375
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,268
Speed lab.

376
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,141
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

377
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,562
- What is wrong with those two?
- You.

378
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,236
Excuse me?

379
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,233
You're what's wrong.

380
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,943
You are the team leader.

381
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,405
Team leader is supposed
to make the tough call.

382
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,992
I made a call. I said we would look
for both of them.

383
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,169
No. Looking for both of them
is not a choice.

384
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,087
We're overtaxing our resources,
our people,

385
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,710
<i>because you won't face the hard truth.</i>

386
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,793
And the hard truth is
we can't look for both.

387
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,964
We can only look for one.

388
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,803
Harry, I just made a vow

389
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,853
to love and protect Barry,
to stand by him through thick and thin.

390
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,396
And now you're asking me to choose

391
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,439
between my husband's life
and my friend's?

392
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,602
- I can't do that.
- You have to.

393
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,029
Or you risk losing them both.

394
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,200
You have to choose.

395
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:21,996
Damn it.

396
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:26,592
Who's Killer Frost?

397
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,464
Sorry. She's just on your mind a lot,

398
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,760
with a lot of cursing.

399
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:37,100
She is my meta-power.

400
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,355
Whenever I get scared or angry
she takes over.

401
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:43,310
She is violent and dangerous
and unpredictable

402
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:46,272
but she's a whole lot more useful
than I am.

403
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:47,614
No, thanks.

404
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,034
I'm already scared to death
of one psychotic woman.

405
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,452
I'll take my chances with you.

406
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:59,076
Dominic, I'm sorry, it's too risky
to perform this surgery here.

407
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,245
<i>And I don't have
any powers to save us...</i>

408
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:03,959
But you do.

409
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:21,060
<i>Take a right.</i>

410
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,566
Caitlin, get back.

411
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,539
Somebody's made my naughty list.

412
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,844
Gentlemen, can you please
take Dominic in?

413
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,521
I need to have a word
with Caity in private.

414
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,560
Thank you.

415
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,695
Why can't you just appreciate
how nice I've been to you?

416
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,367
I don't think you understand
the meaning of the word "nice."

417
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,322
Now, now. It's not about words,
it's about actions.

418
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:21,374
And I have not stabbed you
or punched you

419
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,497
or shot a deadly piece of metal
at you once.

420
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,120
Today.

421
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,207
So why did you run away from me?

422
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,253
Tried. Tried and failed.

423
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,051
Killer Frost
would have been able to do it.

424
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:38,971
Ah.

425
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:41,761
I see.

426
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,018
Caity, do you know what I was doing

427
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:48,648
before I became the successful
entrepreneur you see before you today?

428
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,234
Mean British nanny?

429
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,982
No.

430
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,489
I was a stewardess.

431
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,488
You see, unlike you, I did not have
fancy scientists for parents.

432
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,289
<i>I did not collect scholarships</i>

433
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:03,875
or attend fine institutions.

434
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:08,330
My career options were limited.

435
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,966
So I spent my days
in a quaint little skirt and vest,

436
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,920
serving coffee to handsy pilots,
powerless to stop them.

437
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:19,015
But then,
the particle accelerator exploded

438
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,686
and I was powerless no more.

439
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,109
I showed those pilots
the error of their ways.

440
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,366
Why are you telling me this?

441
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:40,867
Because obtaining my powers
is quite literally what made me me.

442
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,492
But the same cannot be said about you.

443
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,284
There are any number of doctors
I could have come to for this procedure.

444
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,706
I did not. I came to you.

445
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:54,628
Because you, Caitlin Snow, are
and have always been remarkable.

446
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:01,596
You are bright, resourceful, resilient.

447
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,642
And I am more than certain
you can do this.

448
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,441
<i>So, with that said,</i>

449
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,110
unless you want to spend the rest
of your medical career in the morgue,

450
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,813
I suggest you buck up, darling.

451
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,277
You know, pull on your big-girl pants

452
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,109
and do the bloody thing.

453
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,532
Find Caitlin and Barry.

454
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,125
Come on, you bum.

455
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,409
Do it.

456
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:29,911
Do it!

457
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,421
Are you yelling at my satellite?

458
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,507
No, I was just encouraging it.

459
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,673
Although, Sally here
clearly doesn't wanna be encouraged.

460
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,305
Okay, one, her name isn't Sally.

461
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,422
Two...

462
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,509
I'm sorry.

463
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,892
Barry and Caitlin,
we've lost them both before,

464
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,190
and it just feels like
we just got them back.

465
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,190
So, sorry I was a dick.

466
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,816
You weren't a dick.

467
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,355
I'm the dick.

468
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,065
Private and public.

469
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,075
<i>You were just being honest.</i>

470
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:04,245
If it wasn't for me, Caitlin would be
right here with you, me and Sally.

471
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,412
Not "Sally."

472
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:08,958
The truth is,
I haven't had friends in a while.

473
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,286
I'm sure you find that hard to believe,

474
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,121
given my good looks
and winning personality.

475
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,376
Mmm-hmm.

476
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,458
But I'm out of practice.

477
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,422
I suck at being a friend.

478
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:23,257
<i>Now Christmas is ruined,
everyone is kidnapped,</i>

479
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:25,679
and it's all my fault.

480
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:27,264
You're here.

481
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:28,849
And you're helping.

482
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,644
Caitlin's in a vulnerable
state right now

483
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,988
and Barry can take care of himself.

484
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,111
So let's turn off
the Speed Force satellite.

485
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,325
We're going after Caitlin.

486
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,323
We're on it.

487
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:51,333
Let's go get our girl.

488
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,753
<i>I used some equipment
that I found in the basement</i>

489
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,711
to jerry-rig an MRI machine
so that I don't hit an artery.

490
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,753
Now that's ingenuity.

491
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,386
You know, I knew
you were the right doctor to kidnap.

492
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,931
This is a very delicate procedure.
Do you mind giving me some space?

493
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,811
Right. Sorry.

494
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,272
I'll just... I'm gonna leave this
right here.

495
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,484
You know, medical insurance and all.

496
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:17,852
Great.

497
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,606
- Ready?
- I trust you.

498
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:29,159
Now I need you to hold still.

499
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,329
You're gonna feel some pressure.

500
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,795
Extracting the foreign object.

501
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,726
Foreign object extracted.

502
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,646
Applying some surgical glue.

503
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,857
- He's going into shock.
- So un-shock him.

504
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:04,941
I don't know if I can.

505
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,083
That is not the rhythmic tone
of a steady heartbeat.

506
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,130
I need to hear a beep-beep-beep, dearie,

507
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:22,630
or Dominic won't be
the only flatliner in the room.

508
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,005
Oh.

509
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,177
Oh, you're good.

510
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,269
We're clear.

511
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,018
They're all out.

512
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:44,318
Forty psi of inhalation anesthetic,
that'll keep 'em out, but not for long.

513
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:45,902
Let's go.

514
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,237
Satellite's pinging
Caitlin's latent cryokinetic signature.

515
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,779
Where is she?

516
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,459
East wing of St. Alexander Hospital.
That place has been closed for years.

517
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,036
We'll breach over. You got your suit?

518
00:29:58,547 --> 00:29:59,708
Never leave home without it.

519
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,582
Caitlin!

520
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,921
Damn it! I was aiming for your head.

521
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,224
So pointy! That is not very nice, lady.

522
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,525
Are you a time traveler?

523
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,191
'Cause those white-girl dreads
came straight from the '90s.

524
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,913
Yeah, what he said.

525
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:41,045
Although, if you wanna give me
your phone number

526
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:42,292
we could Netflix and chill...

527
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:52,344
Impossible.

528
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,427
<i>Well, that's the thing.</i>

529
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,644
I am the impossible.

530
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,692
We built that cell
so you couldn't run your way out.

531
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:05,144
I didn't run.

532
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,860
I just stood still really fast.

533
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,737
You vibrated faster
than the eye can process.

534
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,072
Like your wife said,

535
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:16,372
your brain may be smarter than mine,
but your body is still human.

536
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,282
It's over, DeVoe.

537
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,292
Far from it, Mr. Allen.

538
00:31:20,316 --> 00:31:22,316
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

539
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,677
<i>Flotation mode, activated.</i>

540
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,572
Life raft was a good call, Cisco.

541
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:45,207
Barry!

542
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:57,639
There's no sign of DeVoe.

543
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:01,056
The house is empty. Facial recognition
is not picking up him or his wife.

544
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,182
So, what, he just drowned?

545
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,021
Or he went back
to wherever he was holding Barry.

546
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,139
Why do you think he took you?

547
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,689
I'm not sure, but I think
that he's interested in my powers.

548
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:12,572
Great. We've got evil Mary Poppins
collecting metas, too.

549
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,824
Yeah, and Amunet won't back down.

550
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,527
Nothing like a lingering threat
to put us all in the Christmas spirit.

551
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:20,284
Speaking of which, with all this DeVoe
stuff and Cecile being out of town,

552
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,864
<i>I didn't have a chance
to decorate the house.</i>

553
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,329
Do you guys still wanna do Christmas?

554
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,661
Yeah, of course,
we have a lot to celebrate.

555
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,414
Do you mind if I invite Dominic,
that meta we just saved?

556
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:30,589
The more the merrier.

557
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,711
Let's get some nog.

558
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,428
So, everything worked out, huh?

559
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,257
Yeah, but what if it didn't?

560
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,932
What if he killed you
because of a decision that I made?

561
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,515
Honestly, Barry, I don't know
if I can keep doing this.

562
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:50,352
Hey, Wells told me about the tough call
you had to make yesterday.

563
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,231
You're gonna have to make
a lot more in the future.

564
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,813
But you made the right call.

565
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,985
And I'm proud of you for making it.

566
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,693
So what now?

567
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:02,405
Now we have ourselves
a merry little Christmas.

568
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,074
- Let's go.
- Okay.

569
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,208
- What the...
- Wow.

570
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,252
Ho, ho, ho. Oh.

571
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,802
Wait.

572
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,299
Like a bowl full of jelly.

573
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,012
Ralph, what is all this?

574
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,220
Well, Joe said
he didn't have any time to decorate

575
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:28,056
and I wanted to do something nice

576
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,312
for my friends.

577
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:34,070
I realize that I don't usually say
or do the right thing.

578
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:36,147
So I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

579
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:40,159
Well, you really went all out,
Ralph, thanks.

580
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,077
It looks great, man, thank you.

581
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,491
I'm glad you like it.

582
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:44,743
Oh, wow.

583
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,074
Uh, Caitlin.

584
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:50,503
It was wrong of me to say
that Killer Frost is better than you.

585
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,872
Because the truth is

586
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,046
no one is better than you.

587
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:57,793
Thank you.

588
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,637
And I know, I'm the one
who saved the day this time.

589
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,222
You know, Cisco, a gift came for you

590
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,016
through one of those death holes
that you call a breach.

591
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,218
Oh, well...

592
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,470
Looks like Gypsy came through, I guess.

593
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:10,355
- Um...
- Wait.

594
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,020
This is a breakup cube.

595
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,851
I thought things were going so well
with you and Gypsy.

596
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:14,981
That makes two of us.

597
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,154
Ramon, that's not a breakup cube.
You should open that when you're alone.

598
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,948
No, no, no. If she's gonna break up
with me, I wanna hear why.

599
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,487
- No, Ramon, I wouldn't...
<i>- Cisco,</i>

600
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:24,863
<i>somebody told me you've been
a very naughty boy this year.</i>

601
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,947
<i>Why don't you come over
and jingle my bells, huh?</i>

602
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,158
Sweet baby Jesus.

603
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,288
Told you, not a breakup cube.

604
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,335
<i>...and I promise it's not gonna be...</i>

605
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,412
You use the same button to...

606
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:39,130
- Joe, do you mind if I...
- Take that to your house.

607
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:40,419
Yeah.

608
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:42,384
No Wally?

609
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,888
He couldn't make it.

610
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,308
- He's still in Blue Valley?
- Cambodia.

611
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,556
Dominic, I'm so glad you came.
Come on in.

612
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:53,687
This is Joe.

613
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:55,434
Thank you.

614
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,394
This house is...

615
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,779
Bitchin'?

616
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,064
Festive.

617
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:03,155
Thanks for the compliment
but who the hell are you again?

618
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,364
He's the guy you just helped save.

619
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:06,036
Yeah, the meta who can read your mind.

620
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:08,619
Oh, good. Then he knows that I'm
thinking that there is only room

621
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,041
for one new guy in this group
and that's me.

622
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,703
I'm not here to fight crime
or get a code name.

623
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,668
Just to brainstorm ideas
about my powers.

624
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,758
I hereby christen thee "Brainstorm."

625
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,168
Come on, man.

626
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,174
I've been here for months
and I don't have a name yet.

627
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,298
Uh-oh.

628
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,683
- What? What is it?
- Security at the loft.

629
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,888
It's probably just more gifts
being delivered.

630
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,264
I'll be right back.

631
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,108
Hello.

632
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,488
Hello, Mr. Allen.

633
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:47,486
Dominic?

634
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:51,370
You really have an acute
sense of detection and wit.

635
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,659
<i>But like I said, Mr. Allen,</i>

636
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,712
you are incapable of seeing
the breadth of my machinations.

637
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:01,375
DeVoe?

638
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,252
You really should have listened
to your teacher.

639
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,300
How is this possible?

640
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,780
I told you
I have a very important buyer, Dom.

641
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,422
As promised.

642
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,753
Always a pleasure doing business
with another savvy woman.

643
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,140
Please, don't do this to me.

644
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,684
I won't be doing anything to you.

645
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,982
Pleased to meet you, Dominic Lanse.

646
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,489
Or should I say, Subject Six?

647
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,748
I have created many meta-humans

648
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:19,997
but only your unique abilities
will allow me to do...

649
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:25,959
This.

650
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,673
You see, Mr. Allen, three months ago

651
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,629
you emerged from the Speed Force
a new man.

652
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:14,096
And in order for you
and the world to experience my plan,

653
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,051
I, too, needed to be reborn.

654
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,307
If you hurt my family...

655
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,310
I have no interest in your family.

656
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,772
Besides, you're gonna need someone
to miss you when you're gone.

657
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:29,231
What did you do?

658
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,863
I merely left something for you.

659
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,365
It's a regift, as it were.

660
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,540
<i>I don't have need for it anymore.</i>

661
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,604
<i>Allen! C.C.P.D. Open up.</i>

662
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,268
<i>Open up in there.</i>

663
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,817
<i>Breach, breach, breach!</i>

664
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,128
Don't run.

665
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,085
Move, move, move.

666
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,424
Keep your hands
where I can see them, Barry.

667
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:39,389
<i>Clear!</i>

668
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,220
<i>Clear!</i>

669
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,613
Barry Allen, you're under arrest
for the murder of Clifford DeVoe.

670
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,947
Excuse me, I have to go.

671
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,745
But thank you so much.

672
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,041
Of course, thank you for coming.

673
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,660
Merry Christmas to you all.

674
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:05,961
Merry Christmas.

675
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,344
I told you I would stand beside you.

676
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,488
Always.

677
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,696
Now, let's bring about
the Enlightenment.
