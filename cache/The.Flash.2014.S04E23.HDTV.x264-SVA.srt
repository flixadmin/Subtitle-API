1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,460
This season on "The Flash"...

2
00:00:01,463 --> 00:00:03,460
DeVoe and his wife are super villains.

3
00:00:03,463 --> 00:00:04,929
He created 12 meta-humans

4
00:00:04,932 --> 00:00:06,614
just so he could steal their powers.

5
00:00:06,617 --> 00:00:08,817
This was your team member, Ralph Dibny.

6
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,088
A rookie hero.

7
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,523
I'll save you!

8
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:14,126
My husband is dead. I'm
leaving you, Clifford.

9
00:00:14,128 --> 00:00:16,461
This is an intelligence booster.

10
00:00:16,463 --> 00:00:17,796
Your mind is being rebooted.

11
00:00:17,798 --> 00:00:19,398
The more I try to use my brains,

12
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,732
the sooner I'm going to lose it.

13
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:22,078
DeVoe plans to position

14
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:24,101
each of his five satellites
around the globe.

15
00:00:24,104 --> 00:00:26,370
Satellites working together
for a single purpose?

16
00:00:26,373 --> 00:00:28,000
DeVoe wants to remove the intelligence

17
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:29,036
of everyone on earth.

18
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,247
Let there be light.

19
00:00:35,983 --> 00:00:38,617
Hey, it's Barry. Leave a message.

20
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:40,786
Allen, Captain Singh.

21
00:00:40,788 --> 00:00:43,255
Got some good news about
you getting your job back.

22
00:00:43,257 --> 00:00:45,157
You can thank your wife, too.

23
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:47,226
Apparently the Mayor read
all those posts Iris wrote

24
00:00:47,228 --> 00:00:48,793
about DeVoe, and she's decided...

25
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,684
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

26
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:45,043
- Cisco, we need power!
- Working on it.

27
00:01:45,046 --> 00:01:46,914
Nothing is working.
Not even cell phones.

28
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:48,017
That's what I was worried about.

29
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:49,140
It's happening isn't it?

30
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,799
I don't know. I mean,
our plan didn't work.

31
00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:52,456
DeVoe replaced the satellite I destroyed

32
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:53,892
with the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite

33
00:01:53,894 --> 00:01:55,040
to set off The Enlightenment.

34
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:56,533
Bar, it's going nuts out there.

35
00:01:56,536 --> 00:01:58,404
There is no power anywhere.
Our car just stopped working.

36
00:01:58,406 --> 00:01:59,536
Thank God we were close by.

37
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:01,499
I mean, the hospital is
another three miles away.

38
00:02:01,502 --> 00:02:03,402
The hospital?

39
00:02:03,404 --> 00:02:05,481
- Joe?
- The sky turned purple,

40
00:02:05,484 --> 00:02:07,372
and she started having contractions

41
00:02:07,374 --> 00:02:09,174
- Cisco, hurry!
- If we're not able to get her

42
00:02:09,176 --> 00:02:10,481
to the hospital can you use...

43
00:02:10,484 --> 00:02:11,531
No, Barry can't run her.

44
00:02:11,534 --> 00:02:13,111
It is not safe for Cecile or the baby.

45
00:02:13,113 --> 00:02:14,203
Then what are we gonna do?

46
00:02:14,206 --> 00:02:16,114
I have everything here
I'd need to deliver a baby.

47
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:17,182
- Huh?
- What?

48
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:18,515
- Thank God.
- Great.

49
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:20,452
Uh, let's go see how dilated you are.

50
00:02:20,454 --> 00:02:22,821
- Okay.
- Breathe, baby, breathe.

51
00:02:22,823 --> 00:02:24,189
Hey.

52
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:27,926
You're gonna want to see this.

53
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:29,695
DeVoe must to predicted
Harry would build

54
00:02:29,697 --> 00:02:32,698
his own thinking cap and power it

55
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,933
with the dark matter from this tube.

56
00:02:34,935 --> 00:02:36,535
Dark matter that he
could then siphon off

57
00:02:36,537 --> 00:02:38,303
from S.T.A.R. Labs to
use to infect the world.

58
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:40,906
Harry was his guinea pig.
He knew if he could reboot

59
00:02:40,908 --> 00:02:42,708
Harry's brain, he
could reboot everyone's.

60
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,898
What about Gideon, could
she hack into the satellites?

61
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:47,346
No, purple haze took her out too.

62
00:02:47,348 --> 00:02:49,937
What do we do?

63
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,367
I don't know.

64
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,070
It's okay, Barry.

65
00:02:56,073 --> 00:02:58,689
I think I do.

66
00:03:03,564 --> 00:03:07,733
Look, I love "Inception"
as much as the next guy,

67
00:03:07,735 --> 00:03:10,125
but sending Barry into DeVoe's mind?

68
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:11,894
His mind is the only one fast enough

69
00:03:11,897 --> 00:03:14,364
to survive the linking
process without any harm.

70
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:15,934
Yeah, but how would
this help us to stop him?

71
00:03:15,936 --> 00:03:18,075
If we can find the good left in Clifford

72
00:03:18,078 --> 00:03:20,012
and help it retake control of his mind,

73
00:03:20,014 --> 00:03:21,646
that good could overpower the bad.

74
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:24,082
You think there actually
is good left inside him?

75
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:26,284
I know that this is hard to imagine,

76
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:28,451
but there was a time when
Clifford was nothing but good,

77
00:03:28,453 --> 00:03:29,977
when he truly wanted to help the world.

78
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:32,257
It's the dark matter he infused
in his brain that changed him.

79
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:34,567
So yes, I do believe that
there is some good in him.

80
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,061
Someway we just need to find it.

81
00:03:36,063 --> 00:03:37,629
This is crazy.

82
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:39,279
I mean, why don't we just
call someone we trust?

83
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:40,532
Kara, Oliver, Wally...

84
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:42,234
You could bring a
legion of your friends,

85
00:03:42,236 --> 00:03:44,436
but they would pose no challenge.

86
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:46,605
Clifford created the bus
metas and the combination

87
00:03:46,607 --> 00:03:49,174
of the abilities to ensure
that he could defeat anyone

88
00:03:49,176 --> 00:03:51,243
whose assistance you might enlist.

89
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:56,914
How long until our minds are wiped?

90
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:59,911
Once the permeation grid hits 100%.

91
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,923
How would we get me inside his mind?

92
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:06,625
We need to find a way to transfer

93
00:04:06,627 --> 00:04:07,984
your consciousness into his.

94
00:04:07,987 --> 00:04:10,161
No, you know what happens
every time I try to vibe him.

95
00:04:10,164 --> 00:04:13,165
I can't do it. I do.

96
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:16,234
But I don't think it's your
power we need, Mr. Ramon.

97
00:04:16,236 --> 00:04:19,438
I believe it's hers.

98
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:28,747
This will amplify Ms.
Horton's telepathic ability

99
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:31,049
to link The Flash's
consciousness to Clifford's,

100
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:32,651
wherever he may be.

101
00:04:32,653 --> 00:04:34,719
It could also provide
a one-way link so that

102
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:37,756
he doesn't realize that
someone is inside his mind.

103
00:04:37,758 --> 00:04:41,226
So it's kind like a one-way brain radio.

104
00:04:41,228 --> 00:04:42,694
I suppose so, yes.

105
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:45,630
Hey, hear that, Harry?
That cerebral inhibitor

106
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:47,532
of yours is going to be put to good use.

107
00:04:51,148 --> 00:04:53,271
I'm sorry about your
friend. His mind could...

108
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:55,740
Sorry won't make him better. Will it?

109
00:04:57,377 --> 00:05:01,713
- Everything ready?
- Think so.

110
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:04,249
Mr. Allen, the chair.

111
00:05:04,251 --> 00:05:06,184
Ms. Horton, the gurney.

112
00:05:06,186 --> 00:05:08,086
You want to put him in that thing?

113
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:10,188
It is the only way to
establish a transcranial link

114
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,125
between Ms. Horton and Mr. Allen.

115
00:05:13,128 --> 00:05:14,726
Joe, I'll be all right.

116
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:16,428
I'll be here the whole time.

117
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,630
We know.

118
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:30,742
Mr. Allen, put the cap on your head.

119
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:33,078
Once Cecile has locked
on to DeVoe's brain waves,

120
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,180
we'll transfer your
consciousness to his amygdala.

121
00:05:35,182 --> 00:05:36,681
That's the part of
the brain that connects

122
00:05:36,683 --> 00:05:38,356
emotional significance to memories.

123
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,851
Where the good memories are,

124
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:42,254
we will find the good part of Clifford.

125
00:05:44,124 --> 00:05:46,458
Here we go, Ms. Horton...

126
00:06:11,652 --> 00:06:13,351
Barry?

127
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:15,070
Barry?

128
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:16,973
Is everything okay?

129
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,796
You've gotta be kidding me.

130
00:06:33,432 --> 00:06:35,269
- Guys, I'm in.
- Paint the picture.

131
00:06:35,272 --> 00:06:36,748
What do you see? What's around you?

132
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:38,684
For starters, The Thinker.

133
00:06:38,687 --> 00:06:41,357
I'm in the 405 bus, in
the middle of the street.

134
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,793
I just came out of that
same portal from before.

135
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:45,628
This is where it all began.

136
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,664
It is the nexus of Clifford's brain.

137
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,532
Once you find him, get him through it,

138
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,334
and he can regain control of his mind.

139
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:53,370
Okay, what does he need to look for?

140
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:54,637
Our house.

141
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,473
All right.

142
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:17,127
Barry, what do you see?

143
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:18,728
Nothing.

144
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,497
A little vague for the viewers at home.

145
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:21,865
What do you mean "nothing"?

146
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:24,534
I mean it's empty.

147
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:30,040
It is completely empty.

148
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:32,220
All right, well, where should I go...

149
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:33,943
Barry? Barry, can you hear me?

150
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:36,680
- Ahhhh!
- Babe, breathe.

151
00:07:36,683 --> 00:07:38,715
Cecile's powers are
connected to her pregnancy.

152
00:07:38,717 --> 00:07:40,183
Her contractions must
be putting a strain

153
00:07:40,185 --> 00:07:41,618
- on her transcranial link.
- No, no, no.

154
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,253
We need to do something about that.

155
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,522
We can't stop her from
having a baby, Marlize.

156
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:48,324
We have to, Mrs. West-Allen,
or this will never work.

157
00:07:48,326 --> 00:07:49,859
She is the only way to get Barry

158
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:51,308
in and out of Clifford's mind.

159
00:07:51,311 --> 00:07:53,163
Everyone chill, it's not
like Cecile is going to lose

160
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:55,495
her powers if she has this baby.

161
00:07:55,498 --> 00:07:57,966
Cecile is going to lose her
powers if she has this baby?

162
00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:00,302
Won't that leave Barry
stranded in DeVoe's mind?

163
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:02,050
I'm afraid so.

164
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:03,640
Information you may
have wanted to share,

165
00:08:03,642 --> 00:08:05,475
like, way before now.

166
00:08:05,477 --> 00:08:07,812
Joe, do you still have
that inhaler I gave you?

167
00:08:07,815 --> 00:08:09,712
Yeah, it's in our hospital bag.

168
00:08:09,714 --> 00:08:11,614
Okay, most inhalers contain
the drug terbutaline,

169
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,350
which can be used to
slow down contractions.

170
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:19,022
I found Thomas.

171
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:22,692
He's been this way all the time.

172
00:08:22,694 --> 00:08:24,667
What the hell is all about?

173
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,996
I... I don't know... I'm
going to get the inhaler.

174
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:29,599
- Cisco, cover me.
- Yeah.

175
00:08:30,912 --> 00:08:32,835
Guys, we need to tell
Barry where to go next.

176
00:08:32,838 --> 00:08:35,371
And fast. Harry figured
out where Marlize was.

177
00:08:35,373 --> 00:08:37,807
Maybe he can...

178
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,976
Harry?

179
00:08:44,308 --> 00:08:45,815
What are you doing?

180
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,100
Help.

181
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:52,889
No.

182
00:08:52,891 --> 00:08:55,558
You are not frying
away what's left of you.

183
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,870
Help!

184
00:08:56,921 --> 00:08:59,161
Help.

185
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,965
Please.

186
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:36,966
See?

187
00:09:36,968 --> 00:09:39,369
Nothing.

188
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,956
Ramon.

189
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:48,144
Where DeVoe first fell
in love with Marlize.

190
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:52,382
Tell Barry to go there.

191
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,261
You'll find him there.

192
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:02,091
Okay?

193
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:04,360
Okay.

194
00:10:04,362 --> 00:10:06,229
And one more thing.

195
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,723
Stars, so little.

196
00:10:33,725 --> 00:10:35,558
We shouldn't be here.

197
00:10:38,496 --> 00:10:41,531
I won't lose anyone else today.

198
00:10:43,868 --> 00:10:46,836
I won't.

199
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,942
Harry had an idea. Go to Oxford.

200
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,043
Oxford?

201
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:55,812
The hamlet of Boars Hill.

202
00:10:55,814 --> 00:10:58,548
The place where we fell in love.

203
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,583
All right, I'm on my way.

204
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,956
I'm here.

205
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,828
There is a blanket, some wine...

206
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,931
There's a song playing on a car radio.

207
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:17,300
Our first dance.

208
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,735
And DeVoe?

209
00:11:18,737 --> 00:11:20,870
He's not here.

210
00:11:20,872 --> 00:11:23,339
All right guys, well...

211
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:25,354
where to next?

212
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,912
Rookie?

213
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:41,537
Allen? What are you doing here?

214
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:43,909
Ralph? Is that really you?

215
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:47,390
I thought I lost you.

216
00:11:47,393 --> 00:11:50,713
I'm so sorry, man. I...

217
00:11:50,715 --> 00:11:52,440
I missed you too, Barry.

218
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:54,378
Barry, did you just say, Ralph?

219
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,854
Yes, guys. Yeah, it's Ralph.

220
00:11:55,857 --> 00:11:58,855
He's... he's alive.

221
00:12:03,128 --> 00:12:04,694
Wait, how are you even here?

222
00:12:04,696 --> 00:12:07,663
How are you here?

223
00:12:07,665 --> 00:12:09,284
Did DeVoe... did he get you?

224
00:12:09,287 --> 00:12:10,687
No, no, he didn't.

225
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,568
He... Cecile is using her telepathy

226
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:16,305
to get my consciousness
inside DeVoe's mind.

227
00:12:16,307 --> 00:12:18,641
That's trippy.

228
00:12:18,643 --> 00:12:20,076
Why?

229
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:22,011
We need to find the good part of him

230
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:24,680
so we can stop the bad from
starting the Enlightenment.

231
00:12:24,682 --> 00:12:26,482
Have you seen him?

232
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:29,018
A good DeVoe?

233
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,420
No.

234
00:12:30,422 --> 00:12:34,357
Just the evil, floating chair variety.

235
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:36,459
He visits me all the time.

236
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:39,562
He knows you're here?

237
00:12:39,564 --> 00:12:41,097
Why would he need to...

238
00:12:41,099 --> 00:12:44,567
In this place I do as
I please, Mr. Allen.

239
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:46,432
I must say, the fact that you thought

240
00:12:46,435 --> 00:12:48,604
I wouldn't have calculated
you and your team making

241
00:12:48,606 --> 00:12:51,874
this feeble attempt
is somewhat insulting.

242
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:55,678
There will be not defeating the
big bad this year, Mr. Allen.

243
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,015
See, you are in my mind now.

244
00:13:01,186 --> 00:13:03,190
And there's no escape.

245
00:13:07,058 --> 00:13:10,560
Run, Mr. Allen, run.

246
00:13:12,297 --> 00:13:14,330
Barry?

247
00:13:14,332 --> 00:13:15,665
Barry!

248
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:18,501
He's... he's coming for us.

249
00:13:18,503 --> 00:13:20,136
He's coming for us.
I heard his thoughts.

250
00:13:20,138 --> 00:13:22,104
He's coming. He's coming here.

251
00:13:22,106 --> 00:13:24,707
- We need to leave.
- And go where?

252
00:13:27,878 --> 00:13:29,678
Okay, what do we doing?

253
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:31,047
I'm getting you out of here.

254
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:32,735
We still need to find
the good DeVoe, though.

255
00:13:32,737 --> 00:13:33,688
How?

256
00:13:33,691 --> 00:13:36,551
He's gonna be someplace
that means something to him.

257
00:13:36,554 --> 00:13:39,889
Before he became who he is now.

258
00:13:42,561 --> 00:13:45,854
You mean like when he was
a simple history professor?

259
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:51,534
Stars are raining.

260
00:13:51,536 --> 00:13:53,550
Got to go! Come on.

261
00:13:57,008 --> 00:13:59,675
Good.

262
00:13:59,677 --> 00:14:04,180
We are gathered here
today to worship in song.

263
00:14:04,182 --> 00:14:08,050
I suggest "Kumbaya."

264
00:14:08,052 --> 00:14:09,300
Ah.

265
00:14:09,303 --> 00:14:11,454
- A force field.
- Ah.

266
00:14:11,456 --> 00:14:12,955
Force field, sucker.

267
00:14:12,957 --> 00:14:15,658
I should never have
let you build this chair

268
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,260
without my oversight.

269
00:14:17,262 --> 00:14:20,096
It was my first miscalculation.

270
00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:22,625
You've made many miscalculations.

271
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,033
Really?

272
00:14:24,035 --> 00:14:26,875
Have you ever pondered why
I never pursued The Flash?

273
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:30,706
Never needed his speed or his mind?

274
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,096
Anyone?

275
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:34,175
His connection to the Speed Force.

276
00:14:34,178 --> 00:14:38,812
Access to all of time...
Past, present, future.

277
00:14:38,815 --> 00:14:40,250
True knowledge.

278
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:45,187
And now that you have
placed him inside my mind,

279
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:47,104
I'll have it all.

280
00:14:48,826 --> 00:14:51,360
You'll have to find us first.

281
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:02,038
DeVoe's lair? Are you crazy?

282
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,740
Can he find us in this pocket dimension?

283
00:15:04,742 --> 00:15:06,242
I've bought us some time.

284
00:15:06,244 --> 00:15:10,313
Time... rhyme... fly... side.

285
00:15:10,315 --> 00:15:13,316
Cecile, we need you to try
and link up with Barry again.

286
00:15:13,318 --> 00:15:15,112
I'll try.

287
00:15:26,998 --> 00:15:30,333
Professor DeVoe?

288
00:15:30,335 --> 00:15:31,567
Barry?

289
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:32,969
Barry, can you hear me?

290
00:15:32,971 --> 00:15:35,871
Yeah. Yeah, Iris, I hear you.

291
00:15:35,873 --> 00:15:37,106
What's wrong?

292
00:15:37,108 --> 00:15:38,441
Good DeVoe, we found him.

293
00:15:42,502 --> 00:15:43,734
He's dead.

294
00:15:55,028 --> 00:15:57,733
I don't suppose you have
another plan, do you?

295
00:15:57,735 --> 00:16:00,335
No, man. I mean, I... this was it.

296
00:16:00,337 --> 00:16:01,317
Now...

297
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,739
Now the world belongs to the Thinker.

298
00:16:04,742 --> 00:16:08,177
Allen, listen to me.

299
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:10,145
I'm stuck here,

300
00:16:10,147 --> 00:16:12,781
but you're not.

301
00:16:12,783 --> 00:16:14,583
You should go.

302
00:16:14,585 --> 00:16:17,586
Be with your family for
whatever time is left.

303
00:16:17,588 --> 00:16:19,262
No.

304
00:16:19,356 --> 00:16:20,889
No.

305
00:16:20,891 --> 00:16:22,664
Okay, first of all, it's our family,

306
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:25,627
and I'm not leaving you behind.

307
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:27,246
There's gotta be another way.

308
00:16:27,249 --> 00:16:29,131
Allen, you said the only
way to save the world

309
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:32,668
is by finding the good
that's left in DeVoe.

310
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,103
It's right here.

311
00:16:35,105 --> 00:16:37,005
With a hole in its chest.

312
00:16:44,014 --> 00:16:46,615
It's not the only good left in him.

313
00:16:49,753 --> 00:16:51,820
Why the brakes? Are we there?

314
00:16:51,822 --> 00:16:53,555
Almost.

315
00:16:53,557 --> 00:16:55,067
So that's the Hellmouth?

316
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,270
That's the nexus of DeVoe's mind.

317
00:16:57,273 --> 00:16:59,194
Marlize said we can take control of him

318
00:16:59,196 --> 00:17:00,891
if the good in DeVoe passes through it.

319
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,861
Allen, we know that's
not possible anymore.

320
00:17:03,864 --> 00:17:05,901
Why do you think he's keeping you alive?

321
00:17:05,903 --> 00:17:07,603
I couldn't figure it
out, but think about it.

322
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:10,138
If you get out, you take
back control of this body,

323
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,540
because it's yours.

324
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:13,475
That's why he won't let you leave.

325
00:17:13,477 --> 00:17:16,745
Once you get out, DeVoe
will cease to exist.

326
00:17:16,747 --> 00:17:19,047
All you have to do is make
it through that portal,

327
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:20,482
and you'll regain control.

328
00:17:20,484 --> 00:17:22,157
Remember who you are, Ralph.

329
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,986
A hero.

330
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:36,565
Let's go get control.

331
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:39,635
Or how about I kill you?

332
00:17:39,637 --> 00:17:43,238
A second time if necessary.

333
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:52,514
What was that?

334
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:54,950
My husband.

335
00:17:54,952 --> 00:17:56,418
He's getting close.

336
00:18:03,427 --> 00:18:05,827
Please tell me someone else felt that.

337
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:07,129
Apologies.

338
00:18:07,131 --> 00:18:08,530
I had to force an emergency shift

339
00:18:08,532 --> 00:18:09,798
to another pocket dimension.

340
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,754
It can be unnerving.

341
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,035
Nerving, serving, swerving, curving.

342
00:18:13,037 --> 00:18:14,595
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

343
00:18:14,598 --> 00:18:16,314
- Ahh!
- What's wrong?

344
00:18:16,317 --> 00:18:19,608
No more labor suppression.
How you feeling, Cecile?

345
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,244
Like... like I don't
know if I can do this.

346
00:18:22,246 --> 00:18:24,513
You shouldn't have to.
You should be able to have

347
00:18:24,515 --> 00:18:25,978
our baby just like any other parent,

348
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,509
in a hospital, in a regular bed,

349
00:18:27,512 --> 00:18:29,751
not with all this.

350
00:18:29,753 --> 00:18:33,431
Hey, look what you've
done to our friend, my son,

351
00:18:33,434 --> 00:18:35,324
my daughter, the love of my life,

352
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:37,192
everybody in this damn city.

353
00:18:37,194 --> 00:18:39,294
- Dad...
- How could you ever think

354
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:41,530
that this would be better for humanity?

355
00:18:41,532 --> 00:18:43,398
Dad, what did you say
to me when Barry came out

356
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,233
of the Speed Force?

357
00:18:45,235 --> 00:18:48,570
You said, "Strength without
faith means nothing."

358
00:18:48,572 --> 00:18:52,975
We need to have faith that we
can get through this together.

359
00:19:02,152 --> 00:19:03,611
How long until he finds us?

360
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:05,954
Minutes, maybe less.

361
00:19:28,946 --> 00:19:31,035
Crap in a hat. I can't hit him.

362
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:32,547
They can read our minds.

363
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:34,079
Then we do this Dibny-style.

364
00:19:34,082 --> 00:19:35,951
- What?
- We don't think.

365
00:19:35,953 --> 00:19:38,887
Just fill your mind with something else.

366
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:40,348
Something you love.

367
00:19:40,351 --> 00:19:41,456
Ralph.

368
00:19:47,242 --> 00:19:49,192
Shrimp buffet!

369
00:19:56,707 --> 00:19:59,241
It's you and me, Iris.

370
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,788
Shrimp platter! Shrimp cocktail!

371
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:16,191
Um, beignets de crevettes.

372
00:20:20,164 --> 00:20:21,965
Once again, Mr. Allen,

373
00:20:21,968 --> 00:20:25,317
your best will not be good enough.

374
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,653
What's the plan, Rookie?

375
00:20:26,656 --> 00:20:28,669
I'm running out of shrimp entrees.

376
00:20:28,672 --> 00:20:30,595
Well, you're only gonna need one.

377
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,380
They're coming every five minutes.

378
00:20:38,382 --> 00:20:40,549
The stars are raining...

379
00:20:40,551 --> 00:20:43,151
Cecile, please just focus
on not having a baby.

380
00:20:43,153 --> 00:20:45,353
Stars are raining, draining, painting.

381
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:46,955
He sounds just like Barry

382
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:48,289
when he came out of the Speed Force.

383
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,244
Yeah, I know.

384
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:52,426
No, I mean, he's saying
the exact same words.

385
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,976
You should mind where
you point your weapon,

386
00:21:18,979 --> 00:21:21,323
Detective West.

387
00:21:35,372 --> 00:21:37,572
Stay away from my girls.

388
00:21:39,076 --> 00:21:40,575
Joe!

389
00:22:00,697 --> 00:22:03,865
Hey, attack of the clones,

390
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:05,186
come and get me.

391
00:22:17,948 --> 00:22:19,915
Hang on!

392
00:22:31,228 --> 00:22:32,661
That was awesome.

393
00:22:37,668 --> 00:22:39,868
Come on.

394
00:22:58,989 --> 00:23:00,555
Now it ends.

395
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:18,471
How did you beat me?

396
00:24:20,237 --> 00:24:22,837
I didn't. We did.

397
00:24:24,841 --> 00:24:28,143
Their emotional attachment
to Mr. Dibny have made them

398
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:31,346
stronger than you
would ever be, Clifford.

399
00:24:31,348 --> 00:24:32,847
But then, you wouldn't understand.

400
00:24:32,849 --> 00:24:36,272
No! This is not my will!

401
00:24:40,692 --> 00:24:43,292
Not anymore. It's mine.

402
00:24:51,514 --> 00:24:52,780
Whoa.

403
00:24:59,209 --> 00:25:01,713
Numbers are still rising.

404
00:25:01,716 --> 00:25:03,149
Clifford's meta-abilities

405
00:25:03,152 --> 00:25:05,586
are no longer controlling
each satellite.

406
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:08,817
If I can just override
their last command.

407
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:10,985
Come on.

408
00:25:49,229 --> 00:25:52,548
There's no more dark
energy anywhere in the city.

409
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,851
We did it.

410
00:25:57,401 --> 00:25:59,397
Oh, my stretchy so-and-so.

411
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,971
Uh, guys...

412
00:26:02,973 --> 00:26:04,693
my water just broke.

413
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,429
Let's get her to the Med Lab. Quickly.

414
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:07,525
- Okay.
- Baby's coming.

415
00:26:07,528 --> 00:26:09,916
- Oh, boy, baby's coming.
- Careful. Carefully.

416
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:14,560
Come on, Harry.

417
00:26:31,536 --> 00:26:33,435
Please, tell me you've done this before.

418
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:36,421
A few times. In med school.

419
00:26:36,424 --> 00:26:37,747
Med...

420
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,049
- Med school?
- Yeah.

421
00:26:39,052 --> 00:26:41,611
Okay. Okay. Med school. Okay.

422
00:26:41,614 --> 00:26:43,563
Joe, just relax.

423
00:26:43,565 --> 00:26:45,465
We got this. Right?

424
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:47,667
Yeah, just breath out.

425
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:49,869
Just breath out.

426
00:26:56,255 --> 00:26:58,364
Power's back on everywhere.

427
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,443
Now the world can finally
get back to normal.

428
00:27:00,446 --> 00:27:03,393
Standing, tossing,
turning, falling, falling...

429
00:27:03,396 --> 00:27:05,051
What happened to him?

430
00:27:05,053 --> 00:27:07,053
He is enlightened.

431
00:27:11,025 --> 00:27:13,926
Another use of Mr. Deacon's powers.

432
00:27:13,928 --> 00:27:16,195
Technological reincarnation.

433
00:27:16,197 --> 00:27:17,530
Cisco.

434
00:27:17,532 --> 00:27:20,032
He's taking over.

435
00:27:20,034 --> 00:27:22,468
I told you that The Enlightenment

436
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,538
will come for you, Marlize, and it will.

437
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:29,041
Remember, I thought of everything.

438
00:27:30,378 --> 00:27:32,345
Even this moment.

439
00:27:34,783 --> 00:27:37,483
Good-bye, my love.

440
00:27:49,164 --> 00:27:52,131
We're back online.

441
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:54,634
Not just that.

442
00:27:54,636 --> 00:27:56,335
Satellite's in a decaying orbit.

443
00:28:03,178 --> 00:28:04,932
Wait, so Marlize deactivating him

444
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:06,526
triggered a literal dead man's switch?

445
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:07,311
It's falling fast.

446
00:28:07,314 --> 00:28:09,526
Clifford must've increased
its mass by a thousand-fold.

447
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:10,757
Barry, the impact of
something that heavy

448
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:12,404
and that fast... How much
time do we have?

449
00:28:12,407 --> 00:28:13,484
Three minutes if we are lucky.

450
00:28:13,486 --> 00:28:14,549
Okay, how do we stop
something it is going to

451
00:28:14,551 --> 00:28:16,532
send us back into the stone age?

452
00:28:16,535 --> 00:28:18,709
Together. I'll spread the
word to evacuate downtown.

453
00:28:18,712 --> 00:28:20,795
Ralph, Cisco, you guys
clear the impact zone.

454
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:23,095
Barry, you've gotta
destroy that satellite.

455
00:28:27,702 --> 00:28:29,769
Okay, now it's time for you to push.

456
00:28:29,771 --> 00:28:31,304
On three.

457
00:28:31,306 --> 00:28:34,540
One, two, three.

458
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:37,443
You're doing great.

459
00:28:44,452 --> 00:28:46,689
Go that way! Ma'am, not this way.

460
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:47,787
Take cover.

461
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:28,027
- Whoa, what is he doing?
- He's building up speed.

462
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:29,795
He's gonna use a sonic
punch to destroy it.

463
00:29:29,797 --> 00:29:32,031
Given the satellite's mass
and its escalating descent,

464
00:29:32,033 --> 00:29:34,300
what prevents it from destroying him?

465
00:29:45,113 --> 00:29:48,547
You're doing great. Now,
I need one big push, okay?

466
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:52,051
One, two, three.

467
00:29:55,089 --> 00:29:56,289
Here she comes.

468
00:31:21,109 --> 00:31:22,808
Yeah!

469
00:31:40,828 --> 00:31:42,795
Barry.

470
00:31:43,898 --> 00:31:45,698
Oh, my gosh.

471
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,421
Oh, my God.

472
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:30,953
This will restore your friend's mind.

473
00:32:30,955 --> 00:32:33,188
Thank you.

474
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,424
I have a lot to make amends for.

475
00:32:38,301 --> 00:32:40,429
You know, Marlize,

476
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:42,775
there are still a lot
of metas out there.

477
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:45,067
I mean, we...

478
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:47,302
We could use your help.

479
00:32:47,304 --> 00:32:49,872
You have all the support you need.

480
00:32:49,874 --> 00:32:53,142
There are those, however,
that do need my help.

481
00:32:53,144 --> 00:32:57,546
Before I joined my
late husband's crusade,

482
00:32:57,548 --> 00:32:59,783
I used technology to
better the lives of those

483
00:32:59,786 --> 00:33:01,316
who had nothing.

484
00:33:01,318 --> 00:33:05,320
Back then my mechanical
creations healed the world,

485
00:33:05,322 --> 00:33:08,857
not harmed it.

486
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:11,760
I'll just pick up where I left off.

487
00:33:11,762 --> 00:33:13,195
Well, good luck.

488
00:33:13,197 --> 00:33:15,330
Thank you.

489
00:33:15,332 --> 00:33:16,732
Hm.

490
00:33:18,869 --> 00:33:21,027
- Good luck.
- Bye.

491
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:31,814
She risked everything
to try and save him.

492
00:33:31,816 --> 00:33:34,716
She really loved him.

493
00:33:34,718 --> 00:33:38,420
Part of her always will.

494
00:33:41,992 --> 00:33:44,860
What is it?

495
00:33:44,862 --> 00:33:47,629
The last satellite,

496
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:49,631
it wasn't just me who took it down.

497
00:33:49,633 --> 00:33:52,134
There was someone else.

498
00:33:52,136 --> 00:33:54,570
Who? Who was it?

499
00:33:54,572 --> 00:33:56,009
Another speedster.

500
00:33:59,009 --> 00:34:02,511
Hang on, Harry. We're almost there.

501
00:34:02,513 --> 00:34:04,746
Okay. Now put this on.

502
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:29,004
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

503
00:34:29,006 --> 00:34:31,243
- Is he okay?
- His vitals are stable.

504
00:34:31,246 --> 00:34:33,722
The program completed.
It should have worked.

505
00:34:33,725 --> 00:34:35,177
Hey, Harry.

506
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:37,546
Hey. Harry.

507
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:42,484
Harry?

508
00:34:48,759 --> 00:34:50,592
Don't worry.

509
00:34:50,594 --> 00:34:55,597
You have been and will always be...

510
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,001
my friend.

511
00:34:59,003 --> 00:35:00,602
Khan.

512
00:35:05,543 --> 00:35:07,075
Kill them.

513
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:14,383
Oh, my God.

514
00:35:14,385 --> 00:35:17,319
"Star Wars."

515
00:35:17,321 --> 00:35:18,820
I can't believe it.

516
00:35:18,822 --> 00:35:21,089
Oh, I can't believe it.

517
00:35:21,091 --> 00:35:23,825
It's not every day you translate symbols

518
00:35:23,827 --> 00:35:29,164
into binary programming polynomials.

519
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:30,966
I... I don't know what that means.

520
00:35:30,968 --> 00:35:33,068
Yes, you do.

521
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:35,938
Actually, I don't. I
don't know what that means.

522
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,075
I think some short
circuit's been fried up here,

523
00:35:40,077 --> 00:35:42,778
but it's fine.

524
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,253
What are you talking about?

525
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,814
I mean, I just don't understand the...

526
00:35:45,816 --> 00:35:47,182
The pol... the thing you said.

527
00:35:47,184 --> 00:35:49,384
It's okay though.

528
00:35:53,324 --> 00:35:54,695
What's the matter?

529
00:35:54,698 --> 00:35:56,491
Marlize said this would work.

530
00:35:56,493 --> 00:35:58,260
It did work.

531
00:35:58,262 --> 00:36:02,364
Ramon, you did it.

532
00:36:02,366 --> 00:36:04,700
I'm back, I'm here.

533
00:36:04,702 --> 00:36:06,668
I mean, maybe I'm a little more average

534
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,503
than I used to be up
there, but I'm here.

535
00:36:08,505 --> 00:36:10,639
Harry, there's nothing
average about you.

536
00:36:10,641 --> 00:36:12,226
You have seven PhDs.

537
00:36:12,229 --> 00:36:14,581
Well, not anymore.

538
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:17,646
- I was supposed to fix this.
- What's the matter?

539
00:36:17,648 --> 00:36:19,014
- And you did, Ramon.
- I didn't...

540
00:36:19,016 --> 00:36:21,883
Ramon, you did. You did.

541
00:36:21,885 --> 00:36:25,454
You brought me back. You
brought back what matters.

542
00:36:25,456 --> 00:36:27,522
So what if I'm... Look, my whole life,

543
00:36:27,524 --> 00:36:30,692
I've been defined by one thing...

544
00:36:30,694 --> 00:36:37,633
My IQ... and somehow
you've given me, uh,

545
00:36:37,635 --> 00:36:40,102
a balance...

546
00:36:40,104 --> 00:36:44,673
between my head and...

547
00:36:50,714 --> 00:36:54,983
Thank you for the balance, Ramon.

548
00:36:57,721 --> 00:37:01,323
Now I'm going to take
that balance to my Earth.

549
00:37:01,325 --> 00:37:02,924
- Huh?
- Wait, Harry.

550
00:37:02,926 --> 00:37:06,995
Harry, we just... We just got you back.

551
00:37:06,997 --> 00:37:10,232
No, I know, Iris.

552
00:37:10,234 --> 00:37:12,267
I have to go see my daughter.

553
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:15,170
I mean, I might not have
the intelligence to garner

554
00:37:15,172 --> 00:37:19,975
seven PhDs, but I can
see one thing clearly.

555
00:37:19,977 --> 00:37:21,510
Family matters.

556
00:37:21,512 --> 00:37:26,381
Well, we're family too.

557
00:37:26,383 --> 00:37:29,418
Heck yeah, you are.

558
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,254
Each and every one of you.

559
00:37:32,256 --> 00:37:34,135
I'll miss you.

560
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,959
- Okay.
- Well...

561
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,666
I don't know.

562
00:37:44,668 --> 00:37:46,368
- We should probably hug.
- I was like...

563
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,603
Yeah.

564
00:37:51,675 --> 00:37:52,841
I'll miss you.

565
00:37:52,843 --> 00:37:55,410
- Love you guys.
- Love you too.

566
00:37:55,412 --> 00:37:56,945
I love you too.

567
00:38:00,016 --> 00:38:03,384
There could be a million
Harrys in this multiverse,

568
00:38:03,387 --> 00:38:06,922
but you... are one of a kind.

569
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,997
I love you too.

570
00:38:23,173 --> 00:38:25,307
It's the end of an era.

571
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:38,353
- Hi.
- There she is.

572
00:38:38,355 --> 00:38:40,856
Hi.

573
00:38:40,858 --> 00:38:42,257
Oh, man.

574
00:38:42,259 --> 00:38:44,292
Ohh.

575
00:38:45,095 --> 00:38:46,628
Hi.

576
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,063
Joe, she's beautiful.

577
00:38:48,065 --> 00:38:50,599
Just like her mother.

578
00:38:50,601 --> 00:38:54,102
I think this calls for a toast.

579
00:38:56,607 --> 00:38:59,040
I said, this calls for a toast.

580
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:01,495
- Sorry, I was...
- I got it, I got it.

581
00:39:01,498 --> 00:39:03,232
- Wally!
- You didn't think I'd miss

582
00:39:03,235 --> 00:39:05,513
my new baby sister's first party, right?

583
00:39:08,452 --> 00:39:09,751
All right,

584
00:39:09,753 --> 00:39:12,854
to the newest member of Team Flash.

585
00:39:12,856 --> 00:39:15,924
Jenna Marie West.

586
00:39:15,926 --> 00:39:18,360
Welcome to the family.

587
00:39:18,362 --> 00:39:19,761
Cheers.

588
00:39:24,468 --> 00:39:28,406
Nice party. It's so
good to see everyone.

589
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:30,510
You know, I heard that the Legends

590
00:39:30,513 --> 00:39:31,907
have quite some parties too.

591
00:39:31,909 --> 00:39:33,508
Mm.

592
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,614
So, tell me,

593
00:39:35,617 --> 00:39:37,617
did you find what you were looking for?

594
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,916
Yeah, I did. And a lot more.

595
00:39:40,918 --> 00:39:43,185
I think fighting a time-demon helped.

596
00:39:43,187 --> 00:39:44,651
Hm.

597
00:39:44,654 --> 00:39:47,221
But, Dad, look, I left
Team Flash cause I felt

598
00:39:47,224 --> 00:39:49,758
like I was always gonna
be in Barry's shadow.

599
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,061
But as a Legend, I...

600
00:39:53,063 --> 00:39:55,831
I learned how to be
comfortable just being me.

601
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:58,233
I'm so proud of you, son.

602
00:39:58,235 --> 00:40:00,168
Thank you.

603
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:03,605
- Let's see your sister.
- Yes.

604
00:40:03,607 --> 00:40:06,475
- Hi, handsome.
- Hi.

605
00:40:06,477 --> 00:40:08,844
Oh, you know Harry was right.

606
00:40:08,846 --> 00:40:11,476
This is really all that matters.

607
00:40:11,479 --> 00:40:13,381
Mm-hmm.

608
00:40:13,383 --> 00:40:16,017
We're next, you know?

609
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:17,719
Wait, you want to
have... What do you mean?

610
00:40:17,721 --> 00:40:19,187
You want to have a baby now?

611
00:40:19,189 --> 00:40:20,655
What do you mean? Right now?

612
00:40:20,657 --> 00:40:21,690
- Barry.
- What?

613
00:40:21,692 --> 00:40:22,963
- Relax.
- I'm fine.

614
00:40:22,966 --> 00:40:25,526
Are you? I just meant someday.

615
00:40:25,529 --> 00:40:28,163
- Yeah.
- Not anytime in the near future.

616
00:40:28,165 --> 00:40:30,468
- Right.
- Oh my God.

617
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:33,502
Let me just get you a
refill so you can relax.

618
00:40:33,504 --> 00:40:36,404
That's nice. Thanks.

619
00:40:41,947 --> 00:40:43,546
- Hi.
- Hey.

620
00:40:43,549 --> 00:40:45,947
- We need to talk.
- What?

621
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:48,945
Wow, this house is bitchin'.

622
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:50,552
Huh?

623
00:40:50,554 --> 00:40:52,554
I think I've seen you before.

624
00:40:52,556 --> 00:40:54,898
Didn't you spill coffee
all over Harry and me?

625
00:40:54,901 --> 00:40:57,792
Yeah, did she pay for yours?
Because she paid for ours.

626
00:40:57,794 --> 00:40:59,461
Weren't you the server at their wedding?

627
00:40:59,463 --> 00:41:02,030
Wait, yeah, you were.

628
00:41:02,032 --> 00:41:04,799
And where did you get this jacket?

629
00:41:04,801 --> 00:41:06,101
Uh...

630
00:41:08,557 --> 00:41:10,605
From her.

631
00:41:10,607 --> 00:41:12,841
Um...

632
00:41:12,843 --> 00:41:17,734
No, mine... mine is one of a kind.

633
00:41:17,737 --> 00:41:21,683
So was this, uh, when
you let me borrow it.

634
00:41:21,685 --> 00:41:26,288
Who are you?

635
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:29,391
I'm your daughter, Nora.

636
00:41:29,393 --> 00:41:31,096
From the future.

637
00:41:31,099 --> 00:41:33,682
And I think I...

638
00:41:33,685 --> 00:41:37,587
made a big, big, mistake.

639
00:41:43,331 --> 00:41:46,295
