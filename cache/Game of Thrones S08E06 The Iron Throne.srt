1
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,024
I'll find you later.

2
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:03,737
It's not safe.

3
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,829
Let me send some men with you.

4
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,244
I'm going alone.

5
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,592
In the name of the one true queen,
Daenerys Targaryen,

6
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,300
I sentence you to die.

7
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,673
Grey Worm!

8
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,022
It's over.

9
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,354
These men are prisoners.

10
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,731
It is not over until
the queen's enemies are defeated.

11
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,939
How much more defeated
do you want them to be?

12
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,989
- They're on their knees.
- They are breathing.

13
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,194
Look around you, friend. We won.

14
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,700
I obey my queen's commands,
not yours.

15
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,123
And what
are the queen's commands?

16
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,078
"Kill all who follow
Cersei Lannister."

17
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,663
These are free men.

18
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,132
They chose to fight for her.

19
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,842
Easy, men. Easy! Easy.

20
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,811
Jon.

21
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,646
We should speak with the queen.

22
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,814
Blood of my blood.

23
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,408
You kept all your promises to me.

24
00:13:57,128 --> 00:14:00,963
You killed my enemies
in their iron suits.

25
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,507
You tore down their stone houses.

26
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:20,812
You gave me the Seven Kingdoms!

27
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,994
Torgo Nudho.

28
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,917
You have walked beside me
since the Plaza of Pride.

29
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:47,001
You are the bravest of men,
the most loyal of soldiers.

30
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:51,256
I name you commander
of all my forces,

31
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:55,301
the Queen's Master of War.

32
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,862
Unsullied.

33
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:17,365
All of you were torn from your
mothers' arms and raised as slaves.

34
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,374
Now...

35
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,831
...you are liberators!

36
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:27,007
You have freed the people of King's
Landing from the grip of a tyrant!

37
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,504
But the war is not over.

38
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:37,677
We will not lay down our spears
until we have liberated

39
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,853
all the people of the world!

40
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,691
From Winterfell to Dorne,

41
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,359
from Lannisport to Qarth,

42
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,446
from the Summer Isles to the Jade Sea!

43
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:59,035
Women, men and children

44
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,081
have suffered too long
beneath the wheel.

45
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:08,875
Will you break the wheel with me?

46
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:20,937
You freed your brother.

47
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,873
You committed treason.

48
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,119
I freed my brother.

49
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,503
And you slaughtered a city.

50
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,796
Take him.

51
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,786
What are you doing here?

52
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:34,622
Hey, what happened?

53
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,456
I came to kill Cersei.

54
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,547
Your queen got there first.

55
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,057
She's everyone's queen now.

56
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,884
Try telling Sansa.

57
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,903
Wait for me outside the city gates.
I'll come find you.

58
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,069
Jon.

59
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,608
She knows who you are.

60
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,948
Who you really are.

61
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,745
You'll always be a threat to her.

62
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,242
And I know a killer when I see one.

63
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,943
Did you bring any wine?

64
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,245
No.

65
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,916
Ah...

66
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,454
Well...

67
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,580
thank you for coming to see me.

68
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,959
Our queen doesn't keep prisoners
for long.

69
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,505
I suppose there's
a crude kind of justice.

70
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,435
I betrayed my closest friend
and watched him burn.

71
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,351
Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes:

72
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,728
"See, I told you."

73
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,147
It just occurred to me.

74
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:28,364
I'm talking to the only man alive
who knows where I'm going.

75
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,156
So is there life after death?

76
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,960
Not that I've seen.

77
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,791
I should be thankful.

78
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,501
Oblivion is the best
I could hope for.

79
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,170
I strangled my lover.

80
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,428
I shot my own father with a crossbow.
I betrayed my queen.

81
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,009
- You didn't.
- I did.

82
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:57,139
And I'd do it again,
now that I've seen what I've seen.

83
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,601
I chose my fate.

84
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,402
The people of King's Landing did not.

85
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,907
I can't justifywhat happened.

86
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,694
I won't try.

87
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,658
- But the war is over now.
- Is it?

88
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:22,206
When you heard her
talking to her soldiers,

89
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,258
did she sound like someone
who's done fighting?

90
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,478
She liberated the people
of Slaver's Bay.

91
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:39,602
She liberated the people
of King's Landing.

92
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,524
And she'll go on liberating

93
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,603
until the people of the world
are free...

94
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,154
and she rules them all.

95
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,449
And you've been by her side,
counseling her.

96
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:50,742
Until today.

97
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,657
Until today.

98
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,288
Varys was right.

99
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,370
I was wrong.

100
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,251
It was vanity
to think I could guide her.

101
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,921
Our queen's nature is fire and blood.

102
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,094
You think our house words
are stamped on our bodies

103
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,341
when we're born
and that's who we are?

104
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,760
Ah, then I'd be fire and blood too.

105
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,262
She's not her father,
no more than you're Tywin Lannister.

106
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:23,567
My father was an evil man.
My sister was an evil woman.

107
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:27,108
Pile up all the bodies
of all the people they ever killed,

108
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,190
there still won't be half as many
as our beautiful queen slaughtered

109
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:31,445
in a single day.

110
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,651
Cersei left her no choice.

111
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,987
The moment the gates fell,
the battle was over.

112
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,447
She saw her friend beheaded.

113
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,373
She saw her dragon
shot out of the sky.

114
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,827
And she burned down a city for it.

115
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:45,039
Ah, it's easy to judge when you're
standing far from the battlefield.

116
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,714
Would you have done it?

117
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,634
What?

118
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,763
You've been up there,
on a dragon's back.

119
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,013
You've had that power.
Would you have burned the city down?

120
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,098
I don't know.

121
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,524
Yes, you do.

122
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,605
You won't say because
you don't want to betray her...

123
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,861
but you know.

124
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,459
What's it matter what I'd do?

125
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,413
It matters more than anything.

126
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,636
When she murdered
the slavers of Astapor,

127
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,307
I'm sure no one
but the slavers complained.

128
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:40,181
After all, they were evil men.

129
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,816
When she crucified hundreds of
Meereenese nobles, who could argue?

130
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,563
They were evil men.

131
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:52,273
The Dothraki khals she burned alive?

132
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,904
They would have done worse to her.

133
00:24:56,412 --> 00:25:00,531
Everywhere she goes, evil men die

134
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,786
and we cheer her for it.

135
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,626
And she grows more powerful

136
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:09,002
and more sure
that she is good and right.

137
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:19,182
She believes her destiny is
to build a better world for everyone.

138
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,679
If you believed that...

139
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,595
if you truly believed it,

140
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:27,603
wouldn't you kill whoever stood
between you and paradise?

141
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,760
I know you love her.

142
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:07,768
I love her too.

143
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:15,564
Not as successfully as you.

144
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,947
But I believed in her
with all my heart.

145
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:34,124
Love is more powerful than reason.

146
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,803
We all know that.

147
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,300
Look at my brother.

148
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,641
"Love is the death of duty."

149
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,694
You just came up with that?

150
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,241
Maester Aemon said it
a long time ago.

151
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:14,252
Sometimes duty is the death of love.

152
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:23,882
You are the shield
that guards the realms of men.

153
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,218
You've always tried
to do the right thing.

154
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,973
No matter the cost,

155
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,351
you've tried to protect people.

156
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,645
Who is the greatest threat
to the people now?

157
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,871
It's a terrible thing I'm asking.

158
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,162
It's also the right thing.

159
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:56,047
Do you think I'm the last man
she'll execute?

160
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:02,675
Who is more dangerous than
the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?

161
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,527
That's her decision.
She is the queen.

162
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,288
I'm sorry it came to this.

163
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,422
And your sisters?

164
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,761
Do you see them bending the knee?

165
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,354
My sisters will be loyal
to the throne.

166
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,150
Why do you think Sansa
told me the truth about you?

167
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,228
Because she doesn't want Dany
to be queen.

168
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:02,109
- She doesn't get to choose.
- No.

169
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,656
But you do.

170
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,076
And you have to choose now.

171
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,940
When I was a girl,
my brother told me it was made

172
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,489
with 1,000 swords
from Aegon's fallen enemies.

173
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,240
What do 1,000 swords look like

174
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:21,205
in the mind of a little girl
who can't count to 20?

175
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:26,290
I imagined a mountain of swords
too high to climb.

176
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,961
So many fallen enemies,

177
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,131
you could only see
the soles of Aegon's feet.

178
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:33,335
I saw them executing
Lannister prisoners in the street.

179
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,550
They said they were acting
on your orders.

180
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,258
- It was necessary.
- Necessary?

181
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,093
Have you been down there?

182
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,519
Have you seen?

183
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:46,268
Children, little children, burned!

184
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,686
I tried to make peace with Cersei.

185
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:57,241
She used their innocence
as a weapon against me.

186
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,614
- She thought it would cripple me.
- And Tyrion?

187
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,450
He conspired behind my back
with my enemies.

188
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,045
How have you treated people
who've done the same to you,

189
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,248
even when it broke your heart?

190
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,256
Forgive him.

191
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,802
- I can't.
- You can.

192
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:26,479
You can forgive all of them,
make them see they made a mistake.

193
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,347
Make them understand.

194
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,403
Please, Dany.

195
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,948
We can't hide behind small mercies.

196
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,451
The world we need

197
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,284
won't be built by men
loyal to the world we have.

198
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:51,212
The world we need
is a world of mercy. It has to be.

199
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:52,630
And it will be.

200
00:34:55,885 --> 00:35:00,676
It's not easy to see something
that's never been before.

201
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,884
A good world.

202
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,136
How do you know?

203
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,774
How do you know it'll be good?

204
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,567
Because I know what is good.

205
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,149
And so do you.

206
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,572
- I don't.
- You do.

207
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,866
You do. You've always known.

208
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,951
What about everyone else?

209
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,576
All the other people
who think they know what's good.

210
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:35,289
They don't get to choose.

211
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,429
Be with me.

212
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,134
Build the new world with me.

213
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,765
This is our reason.

214
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,221
It has been from the beginning,

215
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,774
since you were a little boy
with a bastard's name

216
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,978
and I was a little girl
who couldn't count to 20.

217
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,651
We do it together.

218
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,531
We break the wheel together.

219
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,198
You are my queen.

220
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,585
Now, and always.

221
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,316
Where's Jon?

222
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:39,527
He is our prisoner.

223
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,778
So is Lord Tyrion.

224
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,825
They were both to be brought
to this gathering.

225
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,780
We will decide what we do
with our prisoners.

226
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,330
This is our city now.

227
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,829
If you look outside the walls
of your city,

228
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:52,377
you'll find thousands of Northmen
who will explain to you

229
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:56,252
why harming Jon Snow
is not in your interest.

230
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:59,255
And you will find thousands
of Unsullied who believe that it is.

231
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,928
Some of you may be quick to forgive.

232
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,176
The Ironborn are not.

233
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,133
I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.

234
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:07,934
You swore to follow a tyrant.

235
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,852
She freed us from a tyrant.

236
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:11,350
Cersei is gone because of her,

237
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,898
and Jon Snow put a knife
in her heart.

238
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,147
Let the Unsullied give him
what he deserves.

239
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:19,480
Say another word about killing
my brother and I'll cut your throat.

240
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,031
Friends, please.

241
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:26,029
We've been cutting
each other's throats long enough.

242
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:29,081
Torgo Nudho.
Am I saying that properly?

243
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,336
If it weren't for you and your men,

244
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:36,914
we would've lost the war
with the dead.

245
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,375
This country owes you
a debt it can never repay,

246
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,130
but let us try.

247
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,672
There is land in the Reach.
Good land.

248
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,303
The people that used to live there
are gone.

249
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,429
Make it your own.

250
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,182
Start your own house
with the Unsullied as your bannermen.

251
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,893
We've had enough war.

252
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:56,145
Thousands of you, thousands of them.

253
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,147
You know how it ends.

254
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,899
We need to find a better way.

255
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:02,447
We do not need payment.

256
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,024
We need justice.

257
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,076
Jon Snow cannot go free.

258
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:11,949
It's not for you to decide.

259
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,500
You are not here to speak!

260
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,954
Everyone has heard enough words
from you.

261
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:21,087
You're right.

262
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:23,590
And no one's any better for it.

263
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,222
But it's not
for you to decide.

264
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,263
Jon committed his crime here.

265
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:34,722
His fate is for our king to decide.

266
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,147
Or our queen.

267
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,396
We don't have a king or queen.

268
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,779
You're the most powerful people
in Westeros.

269
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,198
Choose one.

270
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:57,870
Make your choice, then.

271
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:23,236
My lords and ladies...

272
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:30,320
I suppose this is the most important
moment of our lives.

273
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:34,327
What we decide today will reverberate
through the annals of history.

274
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:38,995
I stand before you as one
of the senior lords in the country.

275
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:42,168
A veteran of two wars.

276
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:48,755
And I like to think my experience has
led to some small skill in statecraft

277
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,055
- and under...
- Uncle?

278
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:54,180
Please sit.

279
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,547
Well, we have to choose someone.

280
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:31,345
Um...
Why just us?

281
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,018
Um...

282
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:42,562
We represent all the great houses,
but whomever we choose,

283
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,985
they won't just rule over
lords and ladies.

284
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:49,281
Maybe the decision about
what's best for everyone

285
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:50,574
should be left to...

286
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,697
well, everyone.

287
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:10,837
Maybe we should give the dogs
a vote as well.

288
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,341
I'll ask my horse.

289
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:24,107
I suppose you want the crown.

290
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:25,229
Me?

291
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:27,276
The Imp?

292
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,777
Half the people hate me
for serving Daenerys,

293
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,950
the other half hate me
for betraying her.

294
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,369
- Can't think of a worse choice.
- Who, then?

295
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:50,172
I've had nothing to do but think
these past few weeks.

296
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,753
About our bloody history.

297
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,849
About the mistakes we've made.

298
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,650
What unites people?

299
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:14,445
Armies?

300
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:17,448
Gold?

301
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,490
Flags?

302
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:29,918
Stories.

303
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:35,633
There's nothing in the world
more powerful than a good story.

304
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:39,599
Nothing can stop it.

305
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,893
No enemy can defeat it.

306
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,264
And who has a better story...

307
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:49,230
than Bran the Broken?

308
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:56,366
The boy who fell
from a high tower and lived.

309
00:49:58,037 --> 00:50:01,951
He knew he'd never walk again,
so he learned to fly.

310
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:07,119
He crossed beyond the Wall,
a crippled boy,

311
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:09,375
and became the Three-Eyed Raven.

312
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,342
He is our memory,

313
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,465
the keeper of all our stories.

314
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:21,513
The wars, weddings, births,
massacres, famines.

315
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:23,514
Our triumphs,

316
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:26,142
our defeats,

317
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:27,393
our past.

318
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,068
Who better to lead us
into the future?

319
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:38,775
Bran has no interest in ruling
and he can't father children.

320
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,235
Good.

321
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:42,662
Sons of kings
can be cruel and stupid,

322
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,159
as you well know.

323
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,204
His will never torment us.

324
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:54,583
That is the wheel
our queen wanted to break.

325
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:04,927
From now on, rulers will not be born.

326
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:10,937
They will be chosen on this spot by
the lords and ladies of Westeros...

327
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,517
to serve the realm.

328
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,198
I know you don't want it.

329
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:27,790
I know you don't care about power.

330
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:33,873
But I ask you now,
if we choose you...

331
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,962
will you wear the crown?

332
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:41,759
Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms
to the best of your abilities

333
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:44,466
from this day until your last day?

334
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,065
Why do you think I came all this way?

335
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,942
To Brandon of House Stark...

336
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,577
I say aye.

337
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,294
Aye.

338
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:24,968
Aye.

339
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,262
Aye.

340
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:31,392
Aye.

341
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,270
Aye.

342
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,064
Aye.

343
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,195
Aye.

344
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:44,659
Aye.

345
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,657
- Aye.
- Aye.

346
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:47,783
Aye.

347
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:52,284
I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye.

348
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,416
Aye.

349
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,887
I love you, little brother.
I always will.

350
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,639
You'll be a good king.

351
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:15,228
But tens of thousands of Northmen
fell in the Great War

352
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,309
defending all of Westeros.

353
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:19,269
And those who survived
have seen too much

354
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:22,197
and fought too hard
ever to kneel again.

355
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:27,660
The North will remain
an independent kingdom,

356
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,538
as it was for thousands of years.

357
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:58,434
All hail Bran the Broken,

358
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:02,191
First of His Name, King of the Andals
and the First Men,

359
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:07,826
Lord of the Six Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

360
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:13,665
All hail Bran the Broken!

361
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,628
Lord Tyrion...

362
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:30,348
you will be my Hand.

363
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,595
No, Your Grace, I don't want it.

364
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,601
And I don't want to be king.

365
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,275
I don't deserve it.

366
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:45,067
I thought I was wise, but I wasn't.

367
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:49,242
I thought I knew what was right,
but I didn't.

368
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:53,079
Choose Ser Davos.

369
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:54,576
Choose anyone else.

370
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,874
- I choose you.
- You cannot.

371
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,792
Yes, I can.

372
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:01,292
- I'm king.
- This man is a criminal.

373
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,715
- He deserves justice.
- He just got it.

374
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:07,260
He's made many terrible mistakes.

375
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:10,259
He's going to spend
the rest of his life fixing them.

376
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:16,806
It is not enough.

377
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,863
Giving you to the Unsullied
would start a war.

378
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,534
Letting you walk free
would start a war.

379
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:35,947
So our new king has chosen
to send you to the Night's Watch.

380
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,621
There's still a Night's Watch?

381
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,915
The world will always need a home
for bastards and broken men.

382
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:52,089
You shall take no wife,

383
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,299
hold no lands,

384
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:55,929
father no children.

385
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:02,065
The Unsullied wanted your head
of course,

386
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,314
but Grey Worm has accepted
the justice of a life sentence.

387
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:09,447
Sansa and Arya wanted you freed,

388
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:14,236
but they understand our new king
needs to make peace.

389
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,865
No one is very happy.

390
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:19,665
Which means it's a good compromise,
I suppose.

391
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:22,914
Was it right?

392
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,544
What I did?

393
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:32,053
What we did.

394
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,801
It doesn't feel right.

395
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:46,939
Ask me again in 10 years.

396
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,627
I don't expect
we'll ever see each other again.

397
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:18,803
I wouldn't be so sure.

398
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:21,473
A few years as Hand of the King

399
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:24,397
would make anyone want to
piss off the edge of the world.

400
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:06,411
All the men have boarded.

401
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:07,992
Good.

402
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:12,539
We sail for the Isle of Naath.

403
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:45,579
<i>I wish
there'd been another way.</i>

404
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:49,117
Can you forgive me?

405
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,844
The North is free, thanks to you.

406
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:07,760
But they lost their king.

407
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,598
Ned Stark's daughter
will speak for them.

408
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,984
She's the best they could ask for.

409
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:39,633
You can come see me, you know,
at Castle Black.

410
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,594
I can't.

411
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:46,049
You think anyone will dare tell you
women aren't allowed?

412
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,226
I'm not going back north.

413
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:56,393
Where are you going?

414
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:00,651
What's west of Westeros?

415
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:04,950
I don't know.

416
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,322
No one knows.

417
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:09,784
It's where all the maps stop.

418
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:13,576
That's where I'm going.

419
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:23,632
You have your Needle?

420
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:26,009
Right here.

421
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,328
Your Grace.

422
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,127
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you needed me.

423
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:05,928
You were exactly where
you were supposed to be.

424
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:21,634
That's not... Uh...

425
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:28,269
What's this?

426
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:30,146
<i>A Song of Ice and Fire.</i>

427
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:32,937
Archmaester Ebrose's history
of the wars

428
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:35,318
following the death of King Robert.

429
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:37,570
I helped him with the title.

430
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:42,993
I suppose I come in
for some heavy criticism.

431
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,540
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

432
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:48,244
Oh, he's kind to me.
Never would've guessed.

433
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:53,961
He's not kind?

434
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:56,380
- He...
- He what?

435
01:06:57,514 --> 01:06:58,925
What does he say about me?

436
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:08,438
I don't believe you're mentioned.

437
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:32,629
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

438
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:54,439
We appear to be missing
a Master of Whisperers.

439
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:55,645
And a Master of Laws.

440
01:07:56,948 --> 01:07:58,780
- And a Master of War.
- Yes, Your Grace.

441
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:00,528
Suitable prospects
will be brought to you

442
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:02,610
for an audience in the coming weeks.

443
01:08:03,955 --> 01:08:06,572
And Drogon? Any word?

444
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,532
He was last spotted flying east,
toward...

445
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:09,833
The farther away, the better.

446
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,332
Perhaps I can find him.

447
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:15,918
Do carry on with the rest.

448
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:18,963
As you wish, Your Grace.

449
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,633
Ser Podrick.

450
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:34,104
We serve at your pleasure,
King Bran the Broken,

451
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:36,856
ruler of the Six Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

452
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:41,824
- Long may he reign.
- Long may he reign.

453
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:43,275
Long may he reign.

454
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:45,994
That will improve.

455
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,455
I'm sure it will.

456
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,169
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,

457
01:08:58,259 --> 01:08:59,420
Lord of Highgarden,

458
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:02,674
Lord Paramount of the Reach
and Master of Coin,

459
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:06,215
would you say the crown's debt to you
has been paid?

460
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:08,050
In full, my lord Hand.

461
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,351
Good.

462
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:11,679
Time to start incurring a new one.

463
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:13,059
We have hungry people to feed.

464
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,936
Can we expect some assistance
in this regard?

465
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:16,688
Indeed we can.

466
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:20,317
Lord Davos, we have an armada
to rebuild and ports to repair.

467
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,568
We have.
These projects will begin as soon as

468
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:26,528
the Master of Coin and Lord
of Lofty Titles provides funding.

469
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:29,204
The Master of Coin looks forward
to helping the Master of Ships,

470
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:31,998
but first he has to ensure
we're not wasting coin,

471
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:33,792
or soon there won't be no more coin.

472
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:35,085
"Any more."

473
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,628
You Master of Grammar now too?

474
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:38,125
Grandmaester...

475
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:42,259
it is my theory, based on my years
of work on the Casterly Rock sewers,

476
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:44,337
that clean water
leads to a healthier population.

477
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,968
The Archmaester has done
some research on this subject

478
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:49,471
- and it turns out...
- The strong live and the weak don't.

479
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:52,720
Find the best builders
and set them to the task.

480
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:56,228
Oh, speaking of builders,
all the best brothels burned down.

481
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:59,105
The Master of Coin
is willing to fund reconstruction.

482
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:02,063
Uh, the Archmaester
is less than enthusiastic

483
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:04,489
about the salutary effects
of brothels.

484
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:06,783
Well, I imagine
he isn't using them properly.

485
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:10,863
I think we can all agree that
ships take precedence over brothels.

486
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:13,290
I think that's
a very presumptuous statement.

487
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:18,788
I once brought a jackass
