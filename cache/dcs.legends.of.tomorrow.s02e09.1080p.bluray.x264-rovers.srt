00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,800
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>Time travel is real,</i>

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:06,090
<i>and all of history
is vulnerable to attack.</i>

3
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:08,350
<i>Which is why we must travel through time</i>

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,433
<i>to stop the spread
of these so-called Time Aberrations</i>

5
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,222
<i>and to erase their damage to history.</i>

6
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,354
<i>We are a team of outcasts and misfits,</i>

7
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,019
<i>so please don't call us heroes.</i>

8
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,858
<i>We're legends.</i>

9
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,947
RORY:
<i>Previously, on</i> Legends of Tomorrow...

10
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,779
RIP: <i>Mick has elected to stay.</i>
SNART: <i>Why?</i>

11
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:26,694
Someone needs to be present
to destroy the Oculus.

12
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,447
SNART: <i>Get him out of here!</i>

13
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,536
RAY: <i>He traded his life for ours.
He was a hero.</i>

14
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,579
RORY: <i>Leonard?</i>

15
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,380
I must be losing my mind.

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,134
You're not right in the head, Mick.
That's why I'm here.

17
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,384
To set you straight.

18
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,717
SARA:
<i>The amulet, why is it so important?</i>

19
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:46,971
Hand over the box.

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,137
I swiped it off Darhk.

21
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,517
You have something we need.

22
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,350
I would like to broker a deal with you.

23
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,729
How did you manage to defeat him?

24
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,140
I gave him the amulet.

25
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,522
EOBARD: <i>It's a compass.</i>
DARHK: <i>Compasses generally find things.</i>

26
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,064
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

27
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,858
It can be used to rewrite reality itself.

28
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,067
How do we find it?

29
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,907
EOBARD: <i>You remember Captain Rip Hunter?</i>

30
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,117
RIP: Cut!

31
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,884
Gideon, what's our status?

32
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,429
GIDEON: <i>The Waverider is surprisingly
not destroyed, Captain.</i>

33
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,852
<i>Though, that condition
may not be permanent.</i>

34
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,941
How long will it take to effect repairs?

35
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,692
GIDEON: <i>Fifteen years.</i>

36
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,743
Well, that won't do.

37
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,126
GIDEON: <i>What is that, Captain?</i>

38
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,797
There are some things, Gideon,
I can't even tell you.

39
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,470
Initiate repair procedures.

40
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,385
<i>Auto repair engaged.</i>

41
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,557
Shogun Ballistic.

42
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:20,107
<i>Captain, that is the shutdown code</i>
<i>for my primary system...</i>

43
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,998
Angels and Ministers of Grace,

44
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,123
defend us.

45
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,350
RORY: <i>You're my best friend.</i>

46
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,562
<i>I love you, man.</i>

47
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,149
What did you hear?

48
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,781
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

49
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,871
Though, if I did, I suppose,
I might be flattered.

50
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,168
I wasn't talking to you.

51
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,418
Perhaps you've had enough to drink
for one night.

52
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,299
That's the point, I haven't had enough.

53
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,513
So, if you weren't talking to me, then...

54
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,469
- Snart.
- Snart, what?

55
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,431
I've been talking to Snart.
I've been seeing him lately.

56
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,766
You've been having hallucinations
of Leonard Snart...

57
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,647
If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.

58
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,140
I believe you.

59
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,227
- You can fix me.
- Me?

60
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,067
- You're a doctor.
- Of nuclear physics.

61
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,152
- Same thing.
- Mr. Rory, I can't...

62
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,864
You can fix me.
But you can't tell anybody about it.

63
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,361
- You got that?
- Yes.

64
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,780
- You got that?
- Yes.

65
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,996
Nate. Nate.

66
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,543
Nate.

67
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,503
Sorry, guys. It helps me concentrate.

68
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,513
- It's 3:00 in the morning.
- Amaya and I were trying to sleep.

69
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,845
Not together.

70
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,926
What are you doing up so late?

71
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,310
Just trying to figure out

72
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,313
what the Legion of Doom wants
with those two amulets.

73
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,349
"The Legion of Doom"?

74
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,188
Darhk, Merlyn and the Speedster.

75
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,481
It's from a Hanna-Barbera cartoon
I liked when I was a kid.

76
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,777
Sorry I woke you guys up.

77
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,282
We weren't together.

78
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,201
- He knows, Ray.
- Yeah.

79
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,781
Well, have you figured anything out?

80
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,824
Well, I carbon-dated the amulet
that Sara took from Darhk in 1987.

81
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,868
Before she gave it back
to the Legion of Doom, I'm guessing.

82
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:50,337
Yeah, and Gideon puts the amulet's date
of origin around 30 A.D.

83
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,131
High concentrations
of manganese, copper and zinc.

84
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,712
Which would make bronze.

85
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:58,348
Correct. Now, Roman centurions
put bronze in all their metalwork.

86
00:04:58,507 --> 00:04:59,599
Circa 30 A.D.

87
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:03,638
I also sketched the two amulets
the best I could from memory,

88
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,477
but they don't match
any artifacts on record.

89
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,769
What if they are not two artifacts?

90
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,984
What if they're one?

91
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,454
Shut up.

92
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,876
The Longinus Medallion.

93
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:28,829
Hmm.

94
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,166
Longinus is the name generally
associated with the Roman centurion

95
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,881
who pierced the side of Christ
during the Crucifixion.

96
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,172
Yeah, he was blind
and got the blood of Jesus in his eyes

97
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,385
and then he could see again.

98
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,971
- DR. HEYWOOD: <i>Look at you.</i>
- What? I went to Sunday School.

99
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,761
Now, that blood
allegedly got on the Medallion,

100
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,432
and empowered it and the Spear
with magical powers.

101
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,521
Well, why does the Legion of Doom
want the Medallion?

102
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,981
"Legion of Doom"?

103
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,395
- Yeah.
- Don't ask.

104
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,857
Well, according to legend,
the Medallion calls for the Spear,

105
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,650
and basically takes you right to it.

106
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:02,617
The Spear is also known as
the Holy Lance or the Spear of Destiny.

107
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,828
Hold on, this all just sounds
like an Indiana Jones movie.

108
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,790
<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> is the reason
I became a historian. You know that?

109
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:13,128
Okay, so the Legion wanted the Medallion
so they could get the Spear.

110
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,088
But what do they want with the Spear?

111
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,471
Well, the Spear allegedly
has the power to rewrite reality.

112
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,801
But how's that different from us

113
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,262
traveling through time,
making changes in history?

114
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:27,646
Changes to history cause timequakes
and Aberrations which we can undo.

115
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:31,692
Changes to reality, however,
those are permanent.

116
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,609
SARA: Great.

117
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,522
And I just handed them over the Medallion.

118
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,108
In exchange for Grey's life.

119
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,859
Any one of us would've made that call.

120
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,324
Would Rip?

121
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,877
So much for sunny California.

122
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,169
When we're done here, we need to go
to the 1600 block of Vine Street.

123
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,382
Why, pray tell?

124
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,546
It's where Frank Sinatra's star
is on the Walk of Fame.

125
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,181
I've always wanted to see it.

126
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,846
I am not sure if that's part of
our little trinket's itinerary.

127
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,556
I said, "When we're done."

128
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:11,724
As far as magical artifacts go,
this one is frustratingly unspecific.

129
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,190
Actually, like most magical artifacts,
its ways are nuanced.

130
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:18,572
That's just a fancy word for vague.
And I'm getting tired of walking.

131
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,607
True. We could use some transportation.

132
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:27,739
Wow.

133
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,623
Afternoon, fellas.

134
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,831
Not so fast, buddy.

135
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,417
Wallets.

136
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,705
Now.

137
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,000
Just give us your motorcycles.

138
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,376
Excuse me?

139
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,671
Give us the bikes and we'll let you live.

140
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,715
What are you?
Some sort of comedians or something?

141
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,761
Oh. Something.

142
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,892
That charming-looking fellow
is Cal DeVito.

143
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,729
Instead of being killed, he's supposed
to go on to invent a new carburetor

144
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,438
for Shovelhead motorcycles.

145
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,569
As far as Aberrations go,
don't you think that's a bit...

146
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,775
Puny? Yeah.

147
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,236
Well, Gideon was going over
autopsy reports,

148
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,618
and, well, I'll just let her tell you.
Gideon?

149
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,619
GIDEON: <i>Both gentlemen
were killed in close quarters</i>

150
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,452
<i>with suzuki strikes to the
xiphoid processes of their sternums.</i>

151
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,912
A League of Assassins technique.

152
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,918
Weren't Darhk and Merlyn former L.O.A.?

153
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,171
He must be getting closer
to the Holy Lance.

154
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,672
I'm leaning towards Spear of Destiny.

155
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,124
I prefer Holy Lance.

156
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,291
Can't imagine why.

157
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,925
Gideon, plot a course
for the point of origin of the Aberration.

158
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,259
GIDEON: <i>I already have, Captain.</i>

159
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,348
<i>Hollywood, 1967.</i>

160
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,183
AMAYA: Is the Professor all right?

161
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,595
Uh, depends on
what you mean by "all right."

162
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,183
He's helping Mick with something.

163
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,064
I don't know.
He's been kinda quiet about it.

164
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,105
I hope he figures it out soon,
'cause if the Legion of Doom is here...

165
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,815
Really like how that name's catching on.

166
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,446
We're gonna need Mick and Firestorm.

167
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,107
Let's figure out what's going on first.

168
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,200
Look, all I know is Gideon said,

169
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,361
the motorcycles Darhk
and Merlyn stole are here.

170
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:52,328
What? We're just supposed to walk around
until we see a sign that says, "This Way"?

171
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:53,950
Good idea.

172
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:00,124
Subjugating the world to your rule
isn't saving it.

173
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,126
You would create a wasteland,
and call it peace.

174
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,962
Do not misquote Tacitus to me.

175
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,297
I knew him well.

176
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,468
I lived long enough to watch
civilizations rise and fall...

177
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,135
Cut! Just stop.

178
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,179
- Cut, please.
- MAN: <i>All right. Cut.</i>

179
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,482
And everyone take five.

180
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,988
I just need to think.

181
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,367
George.

182
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,821
What do I do?

183
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,409
It wasn't that bad...

184
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,656
You saw him.

185
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,748
I just can't seem to get Peter
to bring any menace to the part.

186
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,625
I may need to recast.

187
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,335
No, no, no.
You don't have time to recast, okay?

188
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,341
Your thesis film is due
in less than a month.

189
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,672
I know, I know, but...

190
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,178
Look, a film is only as good
as its villain.

191
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,216
And I have an antagonist
who's as threatening as a...

192
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,841
Weiner dog.

193
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,176
Rip Hunter?

194
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,854
No, I'm the director,
Rip's being played by Adam Glassman.

195
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,356
He's probably at craft services.

196
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,359
Nice to see your reputation
for dry humor is well-earned.

197
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,191
You see, this is what I'm talking about.

198
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,400
You guys are good.

199
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,735
Yeah. These are great props.
Did you make these yourselves?

200
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,616
Hey, we're on something of a clock here.

201
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,698
SARA: <i>Oh, my God. It's Rip.</i>

202
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,697
Don't worry. We got you, Rip.

203
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,909
- Who the hell are you guys?
- We don't have time for this.

204
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,762
Get outta here. Save yourself!

205
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,557
- What about you?
- I can't leave my film in there!

206
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,059
Get out of here, man!
No film is worth losing your life.

207
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,598
Jesus!

208
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,065
Get Rip out of here.

209
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,573
- Hey, come on. We got to go.
- Get away from me.

210
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,449
What the hell, man?

211
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,909
- Fall back!
- RAY: <i>Run!</i>

212
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,415
OFFICER 1: <i>Stay right there!</i>
OFFICER 2: <i>Hands! Hands!</i>

213
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:58,996
Freeze! Don't Move!

214
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,578
- Where do you think you're going?
- My movie's inside.

215
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,462
- These lunatics just showed up...
- Do you know these people?

216
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,089
- No, no. I told you...
- Against the wall, long hair.

217
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,670
What? But my movie...

218
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,382
- Can wait. You're under arrest.
- What?

219
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,222
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

220
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,105
Well, that went apocalyptically awful.

221
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,767
I've got Nate and Amaya researching
where the police took Rip.

222
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,435
We'll spring him, and then...

223
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,696
We'll find out what the hell is
going on with him?

224
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:31,779
Dude tried to bludgeon me
with this non-lethal weapon.

225
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,943
Look, we don't know how long
he was in 1967.

226
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,784
He could be suffering from time drift,
which is why he doesn't remember us.

227
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,789
The question is, how?

228
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,127
Well, he could have time-scattered himself
like he did with us.

229
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:45,164
No. He sent us his final message
after scattering us.

230
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,207
He wouldn't have been able
to use it for a second time.

231
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,297
Well, he got here somehow,
and so did Darhk and Merlyn.

232
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,632
The Legion of Doom.

233
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,717
- I'm not calling them that.
- Okay.

234
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,475
If they came to 1967 looking for Rip,
that means...

235
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,602
The Medallion must have led them here.

236
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,475
Rip has the Spear of Destiny.

237
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,982
We gotta bust him out of jail
before they get to him first.

238
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:09,817
And ever since,
I've had a fear of giant toads.

239
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,992
Mr. Rory, while I appreciate
the thoroughness of your insights,

240
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,653
perhaps we could focus
on the issue at hand.

241
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,490
I thought shrinks liked mommy talk.

242
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,249
I'm not a...

243
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,832
You know, I think I've heard
enough on that subject.

244
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,713
Now, when did you
first encounter the apparition?

245
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,260
The ghost of Mr. Snart.
When did he first appear?

246
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,880
Back in Chicago.

247
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,840
Can you remember anything specific?

248
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,008
Something that might have
triggered the vision?

249
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,512
He said something about
setting me straight.

250
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,351
- Why do you think he'd say that?
- I <i>don't</i> know.

251
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,022
Maybe he's, um...

252
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,361
Captain! Hello.
What can we do for you?

253
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,905
It's Rip. He's here, in 1967.

254
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,907
That's astonishing. How?

255
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,694
We don't know. But Damien Darhk
and Malcolm Merlyn are after him,

256
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,908
which means you two
cannot sit this one out.

257
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:04,702
Of course. My apologies.
I was helping Mr. Rory with his migraine.

258
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,375
Yes. I have a very bad headache.

259
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,586
Well, you're going to have to suck it up,

260
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,750
'cause I need your help
breaking Rip out of jail.

261
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,591
What's he doing in prison
and how do you plan on breaking him out?

262
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,472
It involves you playing a shrink.
Do you think you can do it?

263
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,100
If I must.

264
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,809
Great.

265
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,904
Good day.

266
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,777
Can I help you?

267
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,118
Yes, I believe you have
one of my patients in custody.

268
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,498
Name?

269
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,122
His name...

270
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,751
Gideon, a little help.

271
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,541
GIDEON: <i>According to his mug shot,
he was booked as Phil Gasmer.</i>

272
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,507
Philip Gasmer.

273
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,090
It's imperative that he be released
into my custody immediately.

274
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:04,853
He suffers from delusions
of being pursued by futuristic spacemen.

275
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,476
Oh, yeah, that guy.

276
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,311
This way.

277
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,115
Astonishing.

278
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,738
It's really you.

279
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,778
Yeah. It's me.

280
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:22,991
Who are you?

281
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:28,126
I'm your doctor, Mr. Gasmer.
I'm here to take care of you.

282
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,546
I have never laid eyes on you before
in my life.

283
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,007
Memory problems are part of the delusion.

284
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,509
I'll have to admit him.
He can't be treated here.

285
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,294
What? No...

286
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:42,307
Look, don't leave.
This man is not my doctor.

287
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,384
I'm not crazy!

288
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,018
Hey, I know. I know. It's okay.

289
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,724
Look, my name is Sara Lance.

290
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,099
This is Mick Rory and Martin Stein.
We're your friends.

291
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,105
Two of them are.

292
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,985
You're one of them.

293
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,236
- Help! Help!
Hey, okay. Hey!

294
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,651
Hey! Hey!

295
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,826
Listen to me, all right? Calm down.

296
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,746
We're here to help you.

297
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,657
You got to trust me.
Your name is Rip Hunter.

298
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:11,249
Rip Hunter's a figment of my imagination!

299
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,711
Help!

300
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,547
Mick.

301
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,178
We've got Rip.
We're headed to the extraction point.

302
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,059
Oh, no.

303
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,887
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>What is it?</i>

304
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,397
Can I help you?

305
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:37,854
Hey.

306
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,117
DR. HEYWOOD:
<i>Sara, you've got incoming.</i>

307
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,703
<i>Darhk and Merlyn
just entered the precinct.</i>

308
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,128
SARA: <i>Yeah. I see him.</i>

309
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,215
- They're blocking our escape.
- There must be another way out.

310
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,967
Ray, how well can you fly the <i>Waverider?</i>

311
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,473
RAY: <i>I thought you'd never ask.</i>

312
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,310
- Wait, you know how to fly the ship?
- Sure do.

313
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,018
I just have to channel my inner Han Solo.

314
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,103
- Gideon does most of the work.
- She does?

315
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:15,517
GIDEON: <i>I do.</i>

316
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:16,772
Where to, Cap?

317
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,617
All right. We're here.

318
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,449
Get to the cargo bay.

319
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,913
Ray, do not crash my ship.
You break it, you buy it.

320
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:47,178
- Get away from me!
- Captain Hunter, you must listen to us.

321
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,763
Why do you keep calling me that?

322
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,724
- Look, Rip...
- Is this some kind of joke?

323
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,389
Rip, just calm down, okay?
We need you to remember.

324
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:58,401
Your name is Rip Hunter.
You are a Time Master.

325
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,232
You fly the Waverider. It's a time ship.

326
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,153
Rip! Rip, just wait.

327
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,623
This cannot be happening.

328
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,625
- Am I dreaming?
- Rip?

329
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:23,301
Oh, God! Did I drop some really bad acid?

330
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:24,794
Rip, be careful.

331
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,180
Why? I'm hallucinating.

332
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:33,311
There's no such thing as Rip Hunter,
and there's no such thing as a time ship.

333
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:37,978
There's a...

334
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,238
Get to the ship. Go!

335
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,655
- Let's go. Let's go!
- Guys, come on. Quick.

336
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:52,822
Come on!

337
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,463
SARA: <i>Well, Gideon?</i>

338
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,514
GIDEON: <i>I'm afraid the news isn't good,
Captain.</i>

339
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:11,765
<i>A deep scan reveals that.</i>

340
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,178
<i>Captain Hunter's neural architecture
has been completely restructured.</i>

341
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,847
<i>His limbic system reprogrammed
with a new identity.</i>

342
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,937
So it isn't time drift.

343
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,524
Rip didn't forget who he was. He...

344
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,447
- Changed.
- RAY: <i>Reprogrammed?</i>

345
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,068
The technology to alter the brain
at that level doesn't even exist.

346
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,698
Unless Rip's brain was somehow altered
by impulses from the...

347
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,746
- From the...
- From the ship's time drive?

348
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,206
Yeah.

349
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:43,214
You're talking temporal electrocution
as a method of time travel.

350
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,921
- It's practically suicidal.
- Does that track?

351
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,842
I'm not sure. Excuse me.

352
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,715
What's his problem?

353
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,633
I don't know.

354
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,519
GIDEON: <i>Captain Hunter must have
shut down my systems because he knew</i>

355
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,397
<i>I would never permit him to
make physical contact with the time drive.</i>

356
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,725
For good reason,
he could have ended up anywhere,

357
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,235
and in any period in time.

358
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,522
<i>But before he deactivated me,
he recovered something from his parlor.</i>

359
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,532
<i>A piece of wood
approximately .6 meters long.</i>

360
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:11,734
A piece of wood?

361
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,903
The Spear of Destiny?

362
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,828
Could be. I'm gonna go tell the others.

363
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,086
I got an idea.

364
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,583
So this would be
a new milestone for you then.

365
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,335
What's your idea?

366
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,008
Why don't we use that thing
to see what's up with my brain?

367
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,183
I doubt you'd find the results
you're hoping for.

368
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,515
These tests are meant to find
neurological changes,

369
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,430
while my theory is that

370
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,645
your visions are the result of emotion.

371
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,939
You're saying I'm crazy?

372
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,946
I'm saying you're feeling something.

373
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,905
And in the wake of your partner's demise,
that's perfectly normal.

374
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:56,697
I don't do feelings.
Run a test. Fix my brain.

375
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,790
Hey, what's up?

376
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,951
Sara asked us to find
any physical descriptions

377
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,870
of the Spear that might help us find it.

378
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,539
She thinks Rip had it with him
when he traveled to 1967.

379
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,129
And she also wanted you to work on

380
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:14,092
figuring out, um, a way
to reverse the effects on Rip

381
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,967
since he came in contact with the...

382
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,139
Time drive.

383
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,145
GIDEON: <i>I've brought up the time drive
schematics for you, Dr. Palmer.</i>

384
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:26,226
What? How do you expect me
to understand any of that?

385
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,645
Uh, maybe using one of your four PhDs?

386
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,859
I don't have four...

387
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,319
What's wrong?

388
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,660
It's like I should have memories
that aren't there,

389
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,823
and I should understand what this is,
but I don't.

390
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,492
Yeah, I feel it, too.
It's happening right now.

391
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,411
I'm reading this book
about Centurion Longinus

392
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,831
and it's just a bunch of words.

393
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,918
How long have the two of you
been feeling like this?

394
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,386
- Since, uh...
- RAY: <i>Since, uh...</i>

395
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,756
- Film set.
- DR. HEYWOOD: <i>Film set.</i>

396
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,682
Mr. Hunter's film.

397
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,803
Sara had Jax go and recover
what he could find.

398
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,138
"Glucas."

399
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,683
Wait. Isn't that what you pretend
you're allergic to, Ray?

400
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:10,274
What? First of all, my gluten allergy
is very real and challenging.

401
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:15,029
Secondly, it's G. Lucas,
as in George Lucas.

402
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,612
<i>Wait. George Lucas.
How do I know that name?</i>

403
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:23,036
Gideon, pull up George Lucas
on the historical record.

404
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:27,124
GIDEON: <i>George Lucas, born in Modesto,
California, on May 14th, 1944.</i>

405
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,207
<i>Named Modesto Hartman's
"insurance Salesman of the Year"</i>

406
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,091
<i>in 1977, 1980, and 1983.</i>

407
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,877
Three years. Hmm.

408
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,839
- That doesn't seem right.
- No.

409
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,719
Gideon, is there a version of history

410
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,980
where Mr. Lucas
did something else with his life?

411
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,229
Apparently, this Mr. Lucas
is an Aberration.

412
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,563
He's not the Aberration.

413
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,353
The Legion of Doom scaring him
is the Aberration.

414
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,397
An Aberration
that directly affects our lives!

415
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,658
Okay! Calm down. Take it back.

416
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,070
Gideon thinks that the Legion's attack
on Mr. Hunter's film set

417
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,615
caused this George Lucas guy
to quit moviemaking.

418
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,250
As a result, he never made some movie
about space battles,

419
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,911
or another one about an
improbably handsome archeologist.

420
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,705
And we care about this because?

421
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:14,713
GIDEON: <i>In the unaltered timeline,
Dr. Palmer sees </i>Star Wars <i>as a child</i>

422
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,593
<i>and is inspired to become an inventor.</i>

423
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,255
<i>Likewise, Dr. Heywood
chooses to be a historian</i>

424
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,593
<i>after seeing</i> Indiana Jones

425
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,596
<i>instead of becoming a yoga instructor.</i>

426
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,851
Aw, man!

427
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,182
Wait. So, you're telling me

428
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,268
that because some film geek
drops out of school,

429
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,434
my inventor and my historian
are now, essentially, useless?

430
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:32,685
- Yes.
- Hey.

431
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:33,899
- I'm just saying.
- I'm just saying.

432
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,563
GIDEON:
<i>If the Aberration is not corrected, yes.</i>

433
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,857
We need to fix this now.

434
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,451
GIDEON:
<i>I fear you may already be too late.</i>

435
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:44,455
<i>As of today, George Lucas
is no longer enrolled in film school.</i>

436
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,899
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>There he is.</i>

437
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,736
George Lucas, the man who inspires
both of our careers.

438
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,652
- Supposedly.
- Well, let's go inspire him.

439
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,824
- Guys, maybe I should do the...
- Hey, George!

440
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,451
You remember us? I had metallic skin.

441
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,329
- No! No! No, no!
- Hey. George Lucas, wait.

442
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,364
Look, time takes time to harden.

443
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,659
Sooner or later,
we're going to lose our superpowers

444
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,418
the same way we're losing our memories.

445
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,579
If you don't make the movies
that you make,

446
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,214
I don't become a brilliant inventor.

447
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,670
And I don't become
an incredibly handsome historian.

448
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:42,180
I haven't made any movies yet, okay?
I'm still in film school.

449
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,265
- Or I was.
- RAY: <i>That's the point.</i>

450
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,185
If you don't go back to school,
you'll screw up both of our lives.

451
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:49,937
We don't live up to our full potential.

452
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,813
And I do not want to be a heart surgeon!

453
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,440
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>And I don't want
to be a yoga instructor.</i>

454
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,853
Okay, guys, like I said,
why don't I talk to our Time Aberration?

455
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,111
- Yeah, but...
- Shh.

456
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,113
Stay in school.

457
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,032
I'm sorry about my friends,
they're just...

458
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,118
Completely insane?

459
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:11,368
Yeah, but what they say is true.

460
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:16,289
Okay, what?
That you guys are from the future?

461
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,880
That you've somehow seen a bunch of movies
that I haven't even made yet?

462
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,545
Well, actually I'm from the past,
but that's beside the point.

463
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:26,011
Look, George, I don't care about movies,

464
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,300
but guys like them,

465
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:30,887
they do.

466
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:33,890
<i>So, before you get in that oar
and drive back to Modesto,</i>

467
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,808
just think about them, okay?

468
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,821
Them and all the millions of other people
that your stories will someday inspire.

469
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,237
<i>The future of the entire world
is at stake.</i>

470
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,244
And you're our only hope.

471
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,081
I've never actually seen
your quarters, Mr. Rory.

472
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,337
They're charming.

473
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,922
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

474
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:02,256
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>Something unusual. Some sort of receiver.</i>

475
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,386
Judging from its design,

476
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,681
one sensitive
to gravitation wave transmissions.

477
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,551
You're telling me
I have an antenna in my head.

478
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:14,013
- Well, the good news is you're not crazy.
- RORY: <i>Oh, really?</i>

479
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:17,062
So, seeing and talking to Snart is real.

480
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,643
Well, in a sense, yes.

481
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,937
Your former partner was killed

482
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:24,277
when the Oculus exploded
in a blast of temporal energy.

483
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,285
Now, if Mr. Snart
was able to bond with that blast,

484
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,952
the version of him you're now seeing
could be, um...

485
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,536
How will I put this?

486
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,542
Like a time-ghost?

487
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:36,793
Precisely!

488
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,078
But what I want to know is,

489
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:43,467
how did someone manage to put a device
inside your brain without you knowing it?

490
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,969
MAN: <i>You're Chronos.</i>

491
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,384
The Time Masters.

492
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:52,977
They did some sick things to me
when I was Chronos.

493
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,642
I'm sorry, I forgot.

494
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,478
So, what you're saying is,
Snart's stuck out there,

495
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,612
blasted into a billion pieces
floating around in time and space.

496
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:07,492
A rather simplistic way of looking at it,
but, yes.

497
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,992
You're an idiot.

498
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:12,621
- Excuse me?
- It didn't have to end like this.

499
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,666
Mr. Snart, is he here?

500
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,412
Why am I here? Why are you here?

501
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,088
You are dead.

502
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,087
What's he saying?

503
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:28,508
He's telling me I've gone soft
because I'm still on the ship.

504
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,800
Doc. Doc.

505
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,431
You gotta get this thing out of my head.

506
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,063
As I explained, I'm not a medical doctor.

507
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:42,435
But I'm sure Gideon and I
can figure something out.

508
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,104
- That can work?
- In theory, yes.

509
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:54,363
Huh.

510
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,201
Groovy office.

511
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,586
Used to be yours.

512
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,634
Come on. None of this is bringing back
any memories for you?

513
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:11,013
Listen, lady. I wish that I could be
the guy that you want me to be.

514
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:15,096
The "Rip." But I am not.

515
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,893
I take it you two were pretty tight?

516
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,525
- Yeah, he saved my life.
- Cool.

517
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:24,685
You.

518
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,737
You saved my life.

519
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:32,402
I was lost. You came, you recruited me.
You gave me purpose.

520
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,449
It sounds like Sandra.

521
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,410
She's the hero of my movie.

522
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:40,326
- That's weird...
- What? A female hero?

523
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,915
Get with the times, lady.

524
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,247
Yo, we're all in his movie.

525
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,919
I mean, it's different versions of us,
but this is definitely the team.

526
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:54,799
Like on page 89, my character, Max,
he saves...

527
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,967
Hold on.
You're telling me that this burnout

528
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:00,433
used repressed memories
to write a screenplay?

529
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,099
That's not all.
He's writing about the Spear of Destiny.

530
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:07,691
Which you had with you
when you time-jumped off the <i>Waverider.</i>

531
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,948
I don't know what you're talking about.

532
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,234
- Yes, you do.
- Come on, now.

533
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:16,446
What, I just made it all up.
The spear is the McGuffin.

534
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:17,738
- The what?
- The what?

535
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,748
The thing in the movie
that everyone's trying to get.

536
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:20,908
Well, where is it?

537
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:25,329
In the movie, it's in pieces.
Rip just has a fragment of it.

538
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:28,795
What inspired you to write it that way?

539
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,296
I don't know.

540
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,797
I just had this old piece of wood.
I thought it'd be a cool movie prop.

541
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:38,343
- Where is it?
- Uh, I gave it to my prop master. George.

542
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,385
Oh.

543
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:42,809
Great.

544
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,808
George Lucas has the Spear of Destiny.

545
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,480
Glad you changed your mind, George Lucas.

546
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,157
Going back to film school,
definitely the right call.

547
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:55,609
We agree.

548
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,166
MALCOLM: Neat trinket.

549
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,548
One of the lost totems of Zambesi, right?

550
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,839
Ah, Mr. Lucas,

551
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,176
you have something that we have
traveled a very long way to find.

552
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,842
A piece of the Spear of Destiny.

553
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,848
Where is it?

554
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,853
Lady and gentlemen,
if you don't mind, hands up.

555
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:33,902
And if you do mind,
we'd be happy to kill you.

556
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:38,076
- I'll cover George Lucas.
- And I've got...

557
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,321
What?

558
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,864
It's not here. My suit's not here.

559
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,199
I can't steel up.

560
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:46,744
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.
Put 'em up.

561
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,127
- He was talking, I didn't...
- Hands up.

562
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,381
- Shut up.
- They're up.

563
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,921
Thank God. I don't think it's here.

564
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:56,212
All right, Specky Four-eyes,
I'm starting to lose my patience with you.

565
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,380
Where is the Spear?

566
00:29:58,547 --> 00:29:59,548
What spear?

567
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:03,139
We had a little chat
with the members of your film crew.

568
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,680
And they all claimed the
"Spear of Destiny" was a prop,

569
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,019
and that you, Mr. Lucas, were its master.

570
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,228
Yeah, but the movie was done.

571
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:10,734
I tossed all the props
down the garbage chute.

572
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:14,021
- They were just trash.
- But, but, but, but... Shh!

573
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,574
I've one question for you, Mr. Lucas.

574
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:21,203
And your life depends on
answering me honestly.

575
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,040
Where is the city dump?

576
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:30,378
Gideon, set us down
as close to their location as you can get.

577
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,754
GIDEON: <i>Yes, Captain Lance.</i>

578
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,381
And while you're at it, find Mick and...

579
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,962
Grey?

580
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,966
SARA: <i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

581
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,756
Brain surgery. What does it look like?

582
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:44,426
DARHK: We down there somewhere.

583
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,937
Good, because you'll never find it.

584
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,221
You're right.

585
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,059
You're going to.

586
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,779
I could be in Modesto by now.

587
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,993
Shut up and dig, George Lucas.

588
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,334
What kind of superheroes
are you guys, anyway? Huh?

589
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:10,710
I mean, sure they have laser guns,

590
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,496
but aren't you guys
supposed to have superpowers?

591
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,130
Yeah, well, we had superpowers.

592
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,633
But because you don't make Star Wars,
I don't become a scientist,

593
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:17,918
I don't make the Atom suit.

594
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:19,678
Or the serum that turns me into steel.

595
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,510
I can't believe we're all going to die
because of a stupid movie.

596
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,549
Perhaps they need a little incentive.

597
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,717
DARHK: Oh.

598
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,519
Agreed.

599
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:31,770
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- RAY: Oh, no.

600
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,517
What was that?

601
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:35,440
<i>Don't just stand there,
try and brace it with something.</i>

602
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,649
Oh, no.

603
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,491
Oh, no.

604
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,997
- Guys, I found it.
- Don't show 'em.

605
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,837
What? We're in a trash compactor.
We're going to die.

606
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:01,003
No, Ray's right. If we give them what
they want, they're gonna kill us anyway.

607
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,295
Okay, well, then what do we do?

608
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,466
They're going too slow.
Shoot one of them to move things along.

609
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,600
- Which one?
- Dealer's choice.

610
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,019
What was that?

611
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,556
This rescue mission
is not going very well, is it?

612
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,717
GIDEON: <i>I'm afraid not, Captain.</i>

613
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,599
Would you stop calling me that, please?

614
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:55,061
I'm not a captain, I'm just a regular guy.

615
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,395
<i>So was Captain Hunter.</i>

616
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:57,775
<i>He had no superpowers,</i>

617
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:01,108
<i>unless you count his courage,
intellect, and honor.</i>

618
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:05,492
Well, what would he do, huh?
Your captain, if he were here?

619
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:14,664
You guys, we have to give it to them.
There's no other way.

620
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,337
There is. You have to become a filmmaker,
you have to make movies.

621
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,749
And you, George Lucas,
have to believe that.

622
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,588
- What?
- You have to make your movies,

623
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,423
so that we can become
who we're supposed to become.

624
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:24,711
So we can save you.

625
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,255
Your movies go on to change the world.

626
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:28,090
All you have to do is believe in yourself.

627
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,929
You have to believe
you are gonna make amazing movies.

628
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,101
You have to believe it,
like there's no tomorrow.

629
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:34,267
Say it, George, say it out loud.

630
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,773
George Lucas, what do you really want?

631
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,524
What I really want?

632
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,981
What I really want?

633
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,610
What I really want is to direct.

634
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,403
Ah!

635
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:09,798
Whoa!

636
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:38,001
- About time you showed.
- Where were you?

637
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,628
Always busy, gentlemen,
and yet never late.

638
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,382
So, who do we kill first?

639
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,668
That would be me.

640
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,882
EOBARD: <i>Captain Rip Hunter.</i>

641
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,009
<i>It's been ages.</i>

642
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,678
I was beginning to think you were dead.

643
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,392
On the contrary,

644
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:03,811
for the first time in recent memory,
I am finally, truly, alive.

645
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,697
Oh, crap.

646
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,742
Hey, does this thing work?

647
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,798
Screw it. Gideon, fire!

648
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,713
Fire everything!

649
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,430
Go!

650
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:44,067
- Hey, come on.
- Rip!

651
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:45,944
- Rip!
- Hey, Sara.

652
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:49,110
- Rip!
- We gotta go, he's gone.

653
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,066
- Gideon...
- Rip!

654
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,469
We couldn't have got him.

655
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:17,805
You know that, right?

656
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,057
Yeah.

657
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:24,350
Look, Sara,
you can't beat yourself up about this.

658
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,560
It's my responsibility, as captain,

659
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,899
to make sure that everyone
gets back on this ship.

660
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,734
<i>Everyone.</i>

661
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,612
And I failed.

662
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,779
You call getting a piece
of the Spear of Destiny

663
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,948
and the Medallion a failure?

664
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,251
The Legion have nothing.

665
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,291
They have Rip.

666
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:48,916
We lost him, Jax. Again.

667
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,668
But they won't have him for long.

668
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,464
If I know one thing about you,
it's that you don't give up.

669
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,767
When you really want something,
you are unstoppable,

670
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,394
<i>and God help anybody
that tries to get in your</i> way.

671
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:05,891
We are gonna find him
and we're gonna bring him home.

672
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,106
Is that a promise?

673
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,236
That's a prophecy.

674
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:22,916
How are you feeling? Have you seen
our mutual friend around lately?

675
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,998
No, that's because you took the chip out.

676
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,162
Well, actually...

677
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,757
- You did take the chip out?
- Yes, I did.

678
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,384
But after further inspection,

679
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:36,968
I discovered that the device
hasn't functioned in months.

680
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,680
It seems you've taken one too many
blows to the head.

681
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,719
So I am going crazy.

682
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,647
- I'm seeing a ghost.
- There is no ghost.

683
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,693
Leonard Snart truly is no more.

684
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,189
Then why do I keep hearing his voice?

685
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,109
That voice inside your head is your own.

686
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:03,532
If Leonard Snart is second-guessing
your moral obligation to this team...

687
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,245
But that's what I feel.

688
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:11,499
We all hear contradictory voices
inside our heads, Mr. Rory,

689
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:16,378
creating what is known in psychology
as cognitive dissonance.

690
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,338
My brain hurts.

691
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,428
Well, I'm sure it does.

692
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:26,642
The complexities of human emotion
can, at times, be mindboggling.

693
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,602
What's this?

694
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,812
I thought you got your smarts back.
It's movie night.

695
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,195
Gideon checked the timeline.

696
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:38,108
It seems all of George's movies
are now part of history again.

697
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:41,653
Huh. I've almost forgotten
how to perform a median sternotomy.

698
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,996
Well, I guess, I'll just go back to being
a billionaire inventor with four PhDs.

699
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,750
So, what are we gonna watch first?

700
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,913
I mean, after we watch Raiders,
clearly his best film.

701
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,836
Which he never would've made
if he hadn't made Star Wars first.

702
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,842
Oh, wait, this one sounds cute,
it's called <i>Howard the Duck?</i>

703
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,002
- No.
- No.

704
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,212
Okay.

705
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,381
Maybe movie night
wasn't such a good idea.

706
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,095
Maybe you're right.

707
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:06,137
After all, we did just lose Rip.

708
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,772
I know Nate and I
never really got to know Rip,

709
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,434
but we know how much
he means to the rest of you.

710
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,601
Yeah.

711
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,896
GIDEON: <i>Might I offer my opinion?</i>
RAY: Fire away.

712
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:20,317
<i>I believe Captain Hunter would want you
to enjoy yourselves tonight.</i>

713
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,986
All right then, dim the lights.

714
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,951
Gideon, pick the movie.

715
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,957
We'll watch Raiders after.

716
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,123
- Then, <i>Empire.</i>
- Then, <i>Last Crusade.</i>

717
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:35,123
Get comfy. It's gonna be a long night.

718
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:38,418
Uh...

719
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,596
Hello?

720
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,305
Hello?

721
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,350
Is anybody there?

722
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,438
Hey, man.

723
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,153
Welcome, Captain Hunter.

724
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,772
You know I was bluffing, right?

725
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:03,864
I am not actually Rip Hunter.

726
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,029
My name is Phil.

727
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:10,913
I'm a full-time film student,
and part-time recreational drug user.

728
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,077
Seriously regretting the latter.

729
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,372
Oh, I know exactly who you are.

730
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:19,209
I know that you are one of the
protectors of the Spear of Destiny.

731
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:23,221
And I know that you know
where the other pieces are hidden.

732
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:28,510
I don't know anything! I swear.

733
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,346
<i>I am not Rip Hunter!</i>

734
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,479
I am nobody!

735
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:42,486
I can't believe this is happening to me.

736
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,369
You're gonna torture me, aren't you?

737
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:49,160
Oh, I'm not going to torture you,
Mr. Hunter.

738
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:51,704
<i>No.</i>

739
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,249
They are.

740
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,051
No.

741
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:09,676
No, please, please. Please,
please, please, let me go.

742
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:13,058
Let me go!
