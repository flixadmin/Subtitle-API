1
00:00:02,254 --> 00:00:03,934
Hey, hey!

2
00:00:05,254 --> 00:00:06,534
Teddy!

3
00:00:46,534 --> 00:00:47,894
Listen to me!

4
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:51,854
Listen!
I do not want to leave, all right?

5
00:00:52,214 --> 00:00:56,014
Why wouldn't anyone want that?
I have heard many things here.

6
00:00:56,134 --> 00:00:58,614
About the outside world.
About atolls,

7
00:00:58,654 --> 00:01:01,134
about the hydrogen bomb tests.

8
00:01:01,254 --> 00:01:04,134
You know how
a hydrogen bomb works?

9
00:01:04,174 --> 00:01:06,614
- With ... Hydrogen?
- that's funny.

10
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,214
Other bombs exploding, right?

11
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:12,894
But not the hydrogen bomb
It's imploding.

12
00:01:12,934 --> 00:01:17,214
An explosion that is hundredth thousand
millionth degree .

13
00:01:17,254 --> 00:01:19,014
- Do you understand?
- Yes, yes ...

14
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:20,654
- do you?
- I get it!

15
00:01:20,654 --> 00:01:22,534
Go!

16
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:37,734
No!

17
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:40,014
What are you doing?

18
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,934
Jesus Christ, Teddy. Jesus!

19
00:01:43,214 --> 00:01:45,134
you got Billings?

20
00:01:45,454 --> 00:01:48,214
What's the matter with you guys?
catch them, not kill them!

21
00:01:48,254 --> 00:01:49,854
He jumped at us.

22
00:01:49,934 --> 00:01:53,254
You give me a hand with him
we've got to get him to the infirmary

23
00:01:53,254 --> 00:01:56,534
No! Not you, not you.
take a walk.

24
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,534
Come on!

25
00:01:57,614 --> 00:02:00,134
. get up thr roof where you belong..

26
00:02:29,534 --> 00:02:31,454
. Laeddis ..

27
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:52,334
. Laeddis ....

28
00:02:58,734 --> 00:03:02,254
you're dead, we're all dead
this is hell, we're in hell

29
00:03:04,614 --> 00:03:06,054
Please ...

30
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:07,454
...................

31
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:10,214
stop me.

32
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:18,814
Go!

33
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:22,934
Please, please!

34
00:03:30,134 --> 00:03:32,454
Laeddis ...

35
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:42,934
you told me i'de be free of
this place

36
00:03:43,134 --> 00:03:44,654
You promised.

37
00:03:46,654 --> 00:03:47,854
You lied.

38
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:49,454
Laeddis?

39
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:56,334
Laeddis!?

40
00:03:57,854 --> 00:03:59,614
That's pretty damned funny.

41
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:02,254
Your vioce ...

42
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,134
Don't you recognize it?

43
00:04:05,134 --> 00:04:07,574
After all the talks we've had?

44
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,054
After all the lies
that you've tell me?

45
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:11,934
Let me see your face.

46
00:04:12,214 --> 00:04:14,454
They say i'm theirs now

47
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:17,934
They say i'll never leave.

48
00:04:18,654 --> 00:04:21,214
Your match is about to go out.

49
00:04:23,134 --> 00:04:25,214
Let me see your goddamn face!

50
00:04:25,254 --> 00:04:26,214
Why?

51
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:28,574
so you can lie me more?

52
00:04:28,614 --> 00:04:30,894
- This isn't about the truth!
-yes it is.

53
00:04:30,934 --> 00:04:34,534
- It's about exposing
- This is about you!

54
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,014
And Laeddis.

55
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:40,014
That's all it's ever been about.

56
00:04:40,054 --> 00:04:41,654
I was incidental.

57
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:44,134
a way in

58
00:04:46,734 --> 00:04:47,934
George?

59
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,734
George Noyce?

60
00:04:50,534 --> 00:04:53,814
No, it is not possible,
You can not be here.

61
00:04:54,054 --> 00:04:55,334
do you like it?

62
00:04:56,934 --> 00:04:58,854
Who did this to you, George?

63
00:04:58,854 --> 00:05:00,134
You did!

64
00:05:00,614 --> 00:05:01,894
What do you mean?

65
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,934
What are you talking
all of your fucking talk

66
00:05:03,974 --> 00:05:06,254
And I'm back here because of you!

67
00:05:06,294 --> 00:05:08,494
George, I get you out of here.

68
00:05:08,534 --> 00:05:11,734
I'll find a way to fix this

69
00:05:11,774 --> 00:05:13,094
I'll never get out now.

70
00:05:13,134 --> 00:05:15,734
I got out once, But not twice, never twice

71
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,934
- Tell me how sis they got you here?
-they knew!

72
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:20,334
Don't you get it?

73
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,334
Everything you were up to.
Your whole plan.

74
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:26,214
This is a game. All of this ...

75
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:28,014
is for you.

76
00:05:28,214 --> 00:05:30,134
You're not investigating anything.

77
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:33,734
You're a fucking rat
in a maze.

78
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:35,014
George ...

79
00:05:35,454 --> 00:05:37,454
you're wrong.

80
00:05:38,134 --> 00:05:39,334
Really?

81
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:43,214
Been alone much since
you got here?

82
00:05:43,334 --> 00:05:45,334
I'm with my partner.

83
00:05:45,454 --> 00:05:48,334
You have never worked
with him before, right.....?

84
00:05:49,134 --> 00:05:50,134
He's a ...

85
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:52,894
US Marshall from Seattle.

86
00:05:52,934 --> 00:05:55,854
You have never worked
with him before, have you?

87
00:05:57,134 --> 00:05:58,294
George, look ...

88
00:05:58,334 --> 00:06:01,614
I know people.
I trust this man.

89
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:08,054
Then, they've already won.

90
00:06:10,054 --> 00:06:14,654
fuck!

91
00:06:15,214 --> 00:06:17,734
they're going to  ...

92
00:06:17,774 --> 00:06:20,134
tale mr to the lighthouse.

93
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,654
they're going to
cut into my brain.

94
00:06:23,334 --> 00:06:27,654
And I'm only here because of you!

95
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:31,934
George, I'm going to get you out of here.
You're not going to the lighthouse.

96
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:37,334
You can't kill Leaddis and expose
the truth at the same time

97
00:06:37,374 --> 00:06:39,654
You have to make a choice
you understand that, don't you?

98
00:06:39,654 --> 00:06:41,134
I'm not here to kill anyone.

99
00:06:41,214 --> 00:06:44,854
- Liar!
- I won't kill him! I swear to you ...

100
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:47,454
She's death.

101
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:50,134
Let her go ...

102
00:06:50,454 --> 00:06:51,534
Let her go.

103
00:06:52,654 --> 00:06:53,934
. Tell him Teddy ..

104
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:57,134
. Tell him ..

105
00:06:59,134 --> 00:07:01,134
You've got to do it
There's no other way.

106
00:07:01,814 --> 00:07:05,934
- Let her go.
- The time you brought me these flowers ...

107
00:07:05,974 --> 00:07:06,934
You have to do!

108
00:07:07,054 --> 00:07:10,334
And I told you and you broke my heart.
And you asked me why?

109
00:07:10,374 --> 00:07:12,094
Play with your mind.

110
00:07:12,134 --> 00:07:15,214
And then i told you
it broke from happiness

111
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,734
she kill you. she's going to kill you.

112
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:23,454
You want to uncover the truth?
then you have to let her go ...

113
00:07:24,054 --> 00:07:27,014
I can't.
- You have to let her go!

114
00:07:27,054 --> 00:07:28,854
I can't!
I can't.

115
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:38,014
Then you'll never leave
this island.

116
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:44,454
Dolores?

117
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:53,614
He's not in this ward.

118
00:07:54,214 --> 00:07:56,014
He was transferred ...

119
00:07:56,454 --> 00:07:57,734
Out of here.

120
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:01,454
If he's not in ward A

121
00:08:02,134 --> 00:08:04,934
There's only one place he can be

122
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:10,934
The lighthouse.

123
00:08:18,134 --> 00:08:19,214
Hey!

124
00:08:22,054 --> 00:08:23,334
God help you.

125
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:34,414
Boss, we have problems.
Cawley and McPherson are in the building.

126
00:08:34,454 --> 00:08:37,134
Cawley heard an orderly went batshit on a patient,

127
00:08:37,174 --> 00:08:39,854
then got sent up to the roof.
He went up to look for him

128
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:41,214
Let's get the hell out of here.

129
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,214
This way

130
00:08:44,214 --> 00:08:47,134
Just keep going.
we belong here

131
00:08:56,134 --> 00:08:59,454
- What happened to you?
- What do you mean?

132
00:09:00,254 --> 00:09:01,894
Where were you?

133
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:04,094
after we got that guy to the infirmary,

134
00:09:04,134 --> 00:09:06,254
I took a little detect
to patient records.

135
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:07,814
did you find Laeddis?

136
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:09,814
No.

137
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:12,814
- I didn't find him.
- I find next best thing.

138
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:14,294
in his intake form.

139
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:17,054
that's all that was in his file
no session note, no incident reports

140
00:09:17,054 --> 00:09:18,934
no photograph... just this.
It was weired

141
00:09:19,054 --> 00:09:20,734
here, take a look.

142
00:09:21,534 --> 00:09:22,814
I'll take a look later.

143
00:09:24,734 --> 00:09:25,854
What's the matter boss?

144
00:09:26,454 --> 00:09:28,734
I'll look at it later,
that's all.

145
00:09:31,014 --> 00:09:32,334
Ashecliffe's that way.

146
00:09:32,454 --> 00:09:34,214
I'm not going to Ashecliffe.

147
00:09:35,654 --> 00:09:37,134
I'm going to the lighthouse.

148
00:09:38,014 --> 00:09:40,654
I'm going to find out what
the fuck is hapening in thid island.

149
00:09:53,614 --> 00:09:54,734
Here it is.

150
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:56,454
Damn!

151
00:09:57,534 --> 00:09:59,254
too far north
We'll have to double back

152
00:09:59,854 --> 00:10:02,254
There's no way to cros those rocks

153
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:05,054
there could be a way behind those trees

154
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:06,814
maybe a path that goes around the rocks
to the lighthouse

155
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:09,654
what are we doing here?
we've get the intake form

156
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:13,534
It proofs ther's a 67th patient...
who they've said repeatedly he doesn't exist

157
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:17,933
I'm getting to that lighthouse
do you understand?

158
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:23,053
What can I say to you stop.

159
00:10:23,453 --> 00:10:24,453
why would you want to?

160
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:28,933
Because climbing down there
when it's dark ......... suicide

161
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:29,933
okay.

162
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:33,333
maybe it's better you sit this one out

163
00:10:34,853 --> 00:10:38,453
you brought me into this, boss.
And now I am trapped on this rock.

164
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:39,333
On the island.

165
00:10:39,453 --> 00:10:43,133
Without anyone we know.
And now you acting like .........

166
00:10:43,173 --> 00:10:44,133
Like what?

167
00:10:44,213 --> 00:10:45,653
How my acting?

168
00:10:49,453 --> 00:10:53,453
What the hell happened
in those cells, Ted?

169
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:03,253
- What do you think weather is like in Portland, Chuck?
- I'm from Seattle.

170
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:06,533
Seattle?

171
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:13,653
I'll go alone... alone

172
00:11:15,213 --> 00:11:16,733
Come with you, partner.

173
00:11:16,773 --> 00:11:18,333
I said alone

174
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:21,653
Fine.

175
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:47,453
Damn it!

176
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:49,733
Damn it!

177
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:57,613
I knew it will take long.
but I couldn't get there because tide is on

178
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:07,933
Chuck!

179
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,533
Chuck!

180
00:13:11,053 --> 00:13:12,053
Come on!

181
00:13:45,653 --> 00:13:46,853
Chuck!

182
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,933
Where are you, chuck!

183
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:13,933
Chuck!

184
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:16,933
Chuck!

185
00:14:59,613 --> 00:15:00,853
Who are you?

186
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,613
I am Teddy Daniels.

187
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:05,733
I'm a cop.

188
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:08,053
You're a marshal.

189
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:11,053
that's right.

190
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,333
would you mind ...

191
00:15:14,453 --> 00:15:17,133
take your hands from behind
your back?

192
00:15:17,173 --> 00:15:18,133
Why?

193
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:19,933
Why?

194
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:23,333
To make sure what you
have hold there does not hurt me

195
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:31,533
I'm gonna keep this...

196
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,213
If you do not mind.

197
00:15:35,453 --> 00:15:37,213
fine with me.

198
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:49,853
You're Rachel Solando.

199
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:53,333
the real one.

200
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:58,453
did you kill your children?

201
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:01,333
I never had children.

202
00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:04,133
I was never married.

203
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:09,453
before I be a patient
in Ashecliff, I worked here.

204
00:16:11,213 --> 00:16:12,533
You were a nurse?

205
00:16:14,213 --> 00:16:15,813
I was a doctor, marshall.

206
00:16:19,653 --> 00:16:20,813
you think i'm crazy?

207
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,933
- No, I ...
- And if I say I'm not crazy ...

208
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:27,213
well that hardly helps, does it?

209
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:31,733
That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.

210
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:35,933
people always tell you you're crazy

211
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:38,013
and protested, on the contrary,

212
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:39,653
confirm what they say.

213
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:44,733
I do not following you.
I'm sorry.

214
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,333
Once you are declared insane,

215
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:49,853
then anything you do is called
as a part of insanity.

216
00:16:49,853 --> 00:16:52,453
Your reasonable protests
or denial .

217
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:55,653
valid fears,
paranoia.

218
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:57,733
survival Instincts

219
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,333
As defense mechanisms.

220
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,613
You're smarter than you look marshall
that's probably not a good thing

221
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:05,133
Tell me something ...

222
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,453
Yes ...

223
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,933
What happened to you?

224
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:13,333
I started asking about shipping this
this large amount of sodium .

225
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:17,133
- And the sodium-based hallucinogens.
- Psychotropic drugs.

226
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:19,933
And I began to ask about the surgeries, too

227
00:17:23,213 --> 00:17:24,813
Ever heard of transorbital lobotomy?

228
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:28,013
they cap the patient with electroshocks,

229
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:32,853
then go through the eye with an ice pick

230
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:35,533
and pull out some nerve fibers

231
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:39,853
Makes the patient more obedient.

232
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:42,653
Tractable

233
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:44,453
It's barbaric.

234
00:17:45,853 --> 00:17:46,933
Unconscionable

235
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:52,533
Do you know how pain enters the
body marshal? do you?

236
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:54,813
Depends on where you hurt.

237
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:57,013
No, it has nothing to the flesh

238
00:17:57,613 --> 00:17:58,933
The brain controls pain.

239
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,933
The brain controls fear, empathy,
sleep, anger, hunger ... everything.

240
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:07,613
what If you could control it?

241
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:09,813
the brain?

242
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:11,453
To re-create a man,

243
00:18:12,653 --> 00:18:13,933
so he doesn't feel pain

244
00:18:14,533 --> 00:18:16,533
Or love. Or sympathy.

245
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:22,213
A man who can't be interrogated
because he has no memories to confess

246
00:18:25,213 --> 00:18:26,733
They can never takes
all men memories

247
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:28,213
Never.

248
00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:31,733
And you know the North Koreans
use american POWs

249
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:34,933
during brainwashing experiments

250
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,453
they turns soldiers into traitors.
that's what they are doing here.

251
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:41,933
Creates ghosts and give way in the world.
And do things sane man never do.

252
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:44,718
that kind of ability, that kind of knowledge

253
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:52,813
It would take years.

254
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:50,333
Years of research,
experiments on hundreds of patients.

255
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,453
For 50 years now,
people will look back

256
00:18:55,453 --> 00:18:58,013
and they say ... this place
is where it all began.

257
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:01,013
The Nazis used the Jews
the Soviets

258
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:03,613
used prisoners in their own gulags
and we...

259
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,453
We tested patients,

260
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:07,333
on Shutter Island.

261
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:10,133
No, they won't ...
no

262
00:19:14,813 --> 00:19:15,933
you do understand

263
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,533
That they can't let you leave?

264
00:19:22,053 --> 00:19:23,053
I'm a federal marshall ...

265
00:19:23,813 --> 00:19:25,133
they can't stop me.

266
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:27,653
I was a esteemed psychiatrist,

267
00:19:30,013 --> 00:19:32,013
from a respected family.

268
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:34,533
It did not matter.

269
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:38,533
let me ask you ...

270
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:40,453
any past trauma in your life?

271
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,453
yes, why... why that matter?

272
00:19:47,213 --> 00:19:48,813
If a particular event is past

273
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:51,213
the reason you lost your sanity......

274
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:53,533
so when they commit you in here

275
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:57,733
your friends, colleagues will say...
he has cracked.

276
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:01,253
And who would do it,
after what happened.

277
00:20:01,253 --> 00:20:03,613
That could be said of anyone

278
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:06,253
- anyone at all.
- The point is they're going to say it about you.

279
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:11,053
How's your head?

280
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:14,653
- My head?
- You had funny dreams?

281
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:19,333
trouble Sleeping, headaches ...

282
00:20:20,813 --> 00:20:22,533
I'm prone to migraine

283
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:23,533
Jesus!

284
00:20:26,453 --> 00:20:27,653
you haven't taken any pills, no?

285
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:30,870
- Not even aspire?
- I get a aspirin.

286
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,375
Jesus!

287
00:20:32,653 --> 00:20:35,733
And you ate in the canteen and of drinking
coffee that gave it.

288
00:20:36,213 --> 00:20:38,333
Tell me that even
Smoking Cigars of you.

289
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:43,733
Not ... no.

290
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:46,333
I haven't.

291
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:49,853
It takes between 36 and 48 hours for
neuroleptics narcotics ...

292
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,333
To reach sufficient blood
that you-and take effect.

293
00:20:53,373 --> 00:20:55,133
pulse will become first

294
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:58,133
Fingers first and then
shall include all labor.

295
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:03,333
seen any waking nightmares lately,
marshall?

296
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:08,333
Tell me what's going on in that lighthouse?

297
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:11,133
Tell me.

298
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,213
brain surgery.

299
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:18,653
Like, "to open the skull to see
What if we pull on this kind. "..............

300
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:21,453
that's not different with Nazi's kind

301
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:25,853
And then they created the ghosts.

302
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,333
Who knows about this?

303
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:31,653
on the islandm i mean. Who?

304
00:21:34,013 --> 00:21:35,333
Everyone.

305
00:21:35,453 --> 00:21:38,733
Come on, the nurses, the orderlies?

306
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:42,133
- it's not possible ...
- Everybody.

307
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,453
you can't stay here.

308
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:06,253
They think i'm dead, that I drowned.
If they come looking for you, they might finf me

309
00:22:07,253 --> 00:22:08,613
I'm sorry, but you have to go.

310
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:17,213
I'm gonna come back for you.

311
00:22:17,453 --> 00:22:20,333
I will not be here. I move during the day.
new places every night.

312
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:22,653
but I could come get you
take you out of the island.

313
00:22:22,653 --> 00:22:24,733
Haven't you heard a word I've said?

314
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:28,533
The only way off the island
is ferry and they control it

315
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:30,733
You'll never leave here.

316
00:22:40,332 --> 00:22:41,652
I had a friend.

317
00:22:42,132 --> 00:22:44,452
he was with me yesterday,
but we got seperated.

318
00:22:45,212 --> 00:22:46,732
Have you seen him?

319
00:22:48,012 --> 00:22:49,532
marshall ...

320
00:22:50,932 --> 00:22:52,652
You have no friends.

320
00:22:58,652 --> 00:23:03,652
subtitle by
Amir_T6262

321
00:23:24,052 --> 00:23:26,132
There you are.

322
00:23:28,012 --> 00:23:30,332
We've been wondering when
you'd show up

323
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:33,532
Take a seat.

324
00:23:34,132 --> 00:23:35,332
Come on.

325
00:23:45,852 --> 00:23:48,132
Taking a leisurely stroll? were we?

326
00:23:49,332 --> 00:23:50,732
I just...

327
00:23:51,452 --> 00:23:52,732
just looking around.

328
00:23:55,332 --> 00:23:57,332
Did you enjoy
God's latest gift?

329
00:23:58,932 --> 00:24:00,932
- What?
- The God's gifts.

330
00:24:02,452 --> 00:24:03,932
the violence.

331
00:24:08,612 --> 00:24:11,932
when I came downstaires in my home
and saw a tree in my living room

332
00:24:12,932 --> 00:24:14,932
it reached for me like a divine hand.

333
00:24:16,532 --> 00:24:18,212
God loves violence.

334
00:24:21,212 --> 00:24:23,812
- I hadn't noticed.
- sure you have.

335
00:24:24,452 --> 00:24:26,132
Why else would there be so much of it?

336
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,332
It's in us.

337
00:24:28,532 --> 00:24:29,732
what we are.

338
00:24:31,452 --> 00:24:34,652
we wage war, we burn sacrifices
we pillage and plunder

339
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:36,292
and treat at the flesh
of our brothers

340
00:24:36,332 --> 00:24:40,132
and why? Because God gave us violence
to wage in his honor.

341
00:24:43,332 --> 00:24:45,492
I thought God gave us moral orders.

342
00:24:45,532 --> 00:24:48,132
There is no moral orders
as pure as this storm.

343
00:24:49,012 --> 00:24:51,012
There's no moral order at all.

344
00:24:51,452 --> 00:24:54,932
there's just this:
can my violence conquer yours?

345
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,132
- I'm not violent.
- You are.

346
00:25:03,732 --> 00:25:05,532
You're violent as they come.

347
00:25:06,612 --> 00:25:09,332
I know, because I am as violent as they come.

348
00:25:10,452 --> 00:25:12,212
From constructred society
we were lifted..............

349
00:25:12,532 --> 00:25:17,332
If I always stood between you and my meal you
would crack my skull with rock and steal my meal

350
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:21,532
Poor you

351
00:25:24,212 --> 00:25:27,852
Cawley thinks you're harmless, you can be
controled, but I know are different.

352
00:25:29,012 --> 00:25:32,932
- You don't know me.
- Oh but I do.

353
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:36,012
We've known each other for centuries.

354
00:25:45,532 --> 00:25:48,132
If I am to send my teeth to sank into your eye
right now,

355
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:51,332
could you stop me before I blinded you?

356
00:25:55,332 --> 00:25:56,852
Give it a try.

357
00:25:58,332 --> 00:26:02,332
That's the spirit.

358
00:26:45,532 --> 00:26:47,012
Where have you been?

359
00:26:48,132 --> 00:26:50,212
Wandering, just looking at your island.

360
00:26:50,332 --> 00:26:54,452
You'll be leaving,
Now that Rachel has been found.

361
00:26:54,932 --> 00:26:56,332
sure.

362
00:26:58,532 --> 00:26:59,732
big meeting

363
00:27:00,332 --> 00:27:02,732
Oh, yes ...

364
00:27:02,812 --> 00:27:05,332
Apparently there was an unidentified man
in ward C yesterday

365
00:27:05,372 --> 00:27:08,732
He subdued a very dangerous patient.
quite handly.

366
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:10,932
Even so?.........

367
00:27:11,052 --> 00:27:15,452
It seems he had a long concersation with a
paranoid schizophrenic, George Noyce.

368
00:27:18,452 --> 00:27:21,212
This Noyce,
so you said his name was,

369
00:27:22,132 --> 00:27:25,172
- he's delusional, right?
- oh extremely. he can be quite upseting

370
00:27:25,212 --> 00:27:28,212
In fact, two weeks ago, a patient
was so worked up

371
00:27:28,252 --> 00:27:32,012
over one of Noyce's stories
that he beat him up.

372
00:27:32,332 --> 00:27:33,852
Cigarette?

373
00:27:35,212 --> 00:27:36,932
No, thanks.
I quit.

374
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:40,532
So, you'll taking the ferry?

375
00:27:41,132 --> 00:27:42,452
Absolutely ...

376
00:27:43,132 --> 00:27:44,852
I think we've gotten
all we came here for

377
00:27:45,732 --> 00:27:46,852
"We" Marshall?

378
00:27:49,012 --> 00:27:50,652
Speaking of a ..............

379
00:27:51,132 --> 00:27:53,452
- You've seen him, Doctor?
- Who?

380
00:27:54,332 --> 00:27:55,852
My partner, Chuck.

381
00:27:58,532 --> 00:28:00,452
You don't have a partner, Marshall.
You came here alone.

382
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,412
You know, I've built something valuable here

383
00:28:05,452 --> 00:28:08,812
But valuable things have a way of
being misunderstood in their own time

384
00:28:08,932 --> 00:28:10,812
Everyone wants a quick fix,
they always have

385
00:28:10,932 --> 00:28:14,332
I'm trying to do something that people
that even you don't undersyand

386
00:28:14,452 --> 00:28:16,812
And I'm not going to give up
without a fight

387
00:28:18,212 --> 00:28:20,652
I can see that ...

388
00:28:24,332 --> 00:28:26,132
so tell me again
about your partner.

389
00:28:28,012 --> 00:28:29,852
What partner?

390
00:29:32,212 --> 00:29:33,852
Marshall ...

391
00:29:35,132 --> 00:29:36,532
Going somewhere?

392
00:29:37,012 --> 00:29:40,532
No. Just ... take my way
to ferry.

393
00:29:42,132 --> 00:29:43,732
I'm afraid it's the other side.

394
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:48,452
If you wait a moment,

395
00:29:49,012 --> 00:29:51,852
I find someone to take you
to the port.

396
00:29:55,532 --> 00:29:57,972
What is this, Doctor?

397
00:29:58,012 --> 00:30:00,452
it's just a sedative?

398
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:03,052
- It's for precaution.
- precaution?

399
00:30:05,452 --> 00:30:09,532
What are you going to do?
To kill me?

400
00:30:10,052 --> 00:30:11,332
you think you deserve it

401
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:14,532
for what?
for provoking you?

402
00:30:15,052 --> 00:30:17,532
and forgive me
what doesn't provoke you?

403
00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:19,052
remarks ...

404
00:30:19,452 --> 00:30:20,812
- Words ...
- Nazi !

405
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:23,132
And that too

406
00:30:23,652 --> 00:30:25,332
And of course, memories, dreams ...

407
00:30:26,532 --> 00:30:30,452
did you knew that the word "trauma" comes
from a Greek word of wound?

408
00:30:30,932 --> 00:30:35,012
And what's the German word for "dream"
is "traumen.

409
00:30:35,052 --> 00:30:36,132
. Traumen......... "
a dream-.

410
00:30:37,452 --> 00:30:40,132
Wounds can creates monsters.

411
00:30:40,452 --> 00:30:42,932
And you ...
you are wounded, Marshall.

412
00:30:43,932 --> 00:30:46,732
I think you're agree,
when you see a monster

413
00:30:47,532 --> 00:30:48,932
you must stop it.

414
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:53,932
- I agree.
- Yes ...

415
00:31:38,652 --> 00:31:40,332
What are you doing, baby?

416
00:31:45,452 --> 00:31:47,012
You've got to get to the ferry.

417
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:49,732
No. Not ... no.

418
00:31:53,732 --> 00:31:57,532
If the world thinks that Chuck is dead,
then he is perfect for their experiments.

419
00:31:58,132 --> 00:32:00,612
Only one place they'd take him

420
00:32:03,132 --> 00:32:05,532
You go there and you'll die.

421
00:32:05,612 --> 00:32:09,452
He's my partner. if they're hurting him
holding him against his will, I have to bring him out

422
00:32:09,812 --> 00:32:11,812
I can not lose anyone else.

423
00:32:12,452 --> 00:32:16,452
Do not go there.
Please don 't do this Teddy.

424
00:32:19,332 --> 00:32:21,212
I'm sorry, honey.

425
00:32:22,932 --> 00:32:25,532
I love this because
you gave it to me

426
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:30,132
But the truth is ...

427
00:32:30,212 --> 00:32:33,132
it's one fucking ugly tie.

428
00:33:11,932 --> 00:33:13,052
No!

429
00:34:31,532 --> 00:34:33,332
Do not move!
Stay where you are.

430
00:34:34,932 --> 00:34:36,532
Are you going to kill me?

431
00:34:36,932 --> 00:34:40,852
No.
I will not kill you.

432
00:36:28,451 --> 00:36:31,211
Why are you all wet, baby?

433
00:36:32,331 --> 00:36:34,731
- What did you say?
- You know exactly what I said.

434
00:36:47,651 --> 00:36:50,011
The rifle's empty by the way.

435
00:36:55,451 --> 00:36:57,251
have a seat

436
00:37:03,731 --> 00:37:06,811
For god's sake dry off
you're going to catch cold

437
00:37:07,931 --> 00:37:08,931
all right.

438
00:37:11,531 --> 00:37:14,211
How badly did you hurt the guard?

439
00:37:16,811 --> 00:37:18,931
I do not know what
are you talking about.

440
00:37:21,651 --> 00:37:23,211
Yes. he's here.

441
00:37:23,731 --> 00:37:26,651
Have Dr.Sheehan take a good look
at your man before you send him up

442
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:30,131
So, Dr. Shehan ...

443
00:37:30,731 --> 00:37:31,931
He came on the ferry
this morining.

444
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:33,931
Not exactly.

445
00:37:35,651 --> 00:37:38,131
You blew up my car.
I really loved that car.

446
00:37:39,451 --> 00:37:41,131
sorry to hear about that.

447
00:37:44,451 --> 00:37:46,011
Tremors are getting pretty bad.

448
00:37:47,451 --> 00:37:48,531
How are the hallucinations?

449
00:37:49,531 --> 00:37:50,931
. Go away, Teddy ....................

450
00:37:52,131 --> 00:37:53,931
. this place is gonna be the end of you ..

451
00:37:56,851 --> 00:37:59,531
- Not bad.
- they'll get worse.

452
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,051
I know.

453
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:03,331
Dr. Solando ...

454
00:38:04,251 --> 00:38:06,611
she told me about neuroleptics.

455
00:38:06,731 --> 00:38:09,931
did she now?
and when was this?

456
00:38:10,051 --> 00:38:14,811
I found her doctor,in a cave on the cliffs.
But you won't get her.

457
00:38:14,931 --> 00:38:16,451
I don't doubt it.

458
00:38:17,051 --> 00:38:18,811
considerations are not real.

459
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,731
But your hallucinations are
more severe than I thought.

460
00:38:24,211 --> 00:38:26,131
You are not on neuroleptics.

461
00:38:27,131 --> 00:38:29,451
You are not on neuroleptics
as a matter of fact

462
00:38:29,451 --> 00:38:31,731
Then what the fuck is this?
Huh, what the fuck is this?

463
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:32,851
Withdrawal.

464
00:38:33,131 --> 00:38:34,331
Withdrawal?

465
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:37,531
From what? I haven't even had a goddamned
drink since we got on this island.

466
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:38,851
Chlorpromazine

467
00:38:39,211 --> 00:38:42,851
I'm not a fan of pharmacology
but I have to see in your case ...

468
00:38:43,731 --> 00:38:46,011
- Clorpro ... like you said?
- Chlorpromazine.

469
00:38:46,731 --> 00:38:51,131
the same thing we've
been giving you for the last 24 months.

470
00:38:52,531 --> 00:38:54,931
So in the past two years

471
00:38:55,011 --> 00:38:57,531
you have had somebody in Boston
who gave me drugs.........

472
00:38:57,571 --> 00:38:59,851
Not Boston.
Here.

473
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:05,131
You've been here for two years.
a patient of this institutions.

474
00:39:07,811 --> 00:39:11,731
After everythings I see here, Doctor,

475
00:39:12,211 --> 00:39:14,651
You really thinks you can
convince me I'm crazy?

476
00:39:14,731 --> 00:39:18,931
You know what kind of people we are dealing?
I'm U.S. marshal

477
00:39:19,451 --> 00:39:23,091
You were a U.S. marshal
Here's a copy of your intake form

478
00:39:23,131 --> 00:39:26,331
you broke into ward C for.
Proof of the 67th patient

479
00:39:26,451 --> 00:39:29,331
If you'd gotten to the mainland,
you could have blown the lid off this place.

480
00:39:29,851 --> 00:39:31,131
- wait ...wait
- But somehow

481
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:32,931
and yet you couldn't find time
to look at it yet. read it

482
00:39:34,131 --> 00:39:35,331
Go ahead

483
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:41,131
The patient is highly intelligent
highly delusional.

484
00:39:41,211 --> 00:39:42,651
Decorated army veteran.

485
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:44,651
prisoned for the
liberation of Dachav.

486
00:39:45,531 --> 00:39:47,651
Former U.S. marshal

487
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,331
known proclivity for violence.

488
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:51,131
shown no remorse for his crime because
his denial is such

489
00:39:51,211 --> 00:39:54,531
that no crime ever took place
highly developed and fantastical

490
00:39:54,571 --> 00:39:57,731
narratives which preclude facing
the truth of his actions...

491
00:39:57,851 --> 00:39:58,931
I am tired of this bullshits.

492
00:39:59,011 --> 00:40:00,331
Where's my partner?

493
00:40:00,451 --> 00:40:01,931
Where's Chuck?
Where is he?

494
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:04,931
Let's try this in another way.

495
00:40:05,051 --> 00:40:07,411
your wife's maiden name was
"Chana" am I correct?

496
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:09,651
- Not even talk about her!
- I'm afraid I have to.

497
00:40:11,331 --> 00:40:14,211
Notice anything these four names have in common?

498
00:40:14,731 --> 00:40:15,811
the rule 4.

499
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:18,731
- Andrew, what do you see?
- If you done anything

500
00:40:18,811 --> 00:40:22,811
- to my partner, Doctor, It is a violation ...
- Focus, Andrew. What do you see?

501
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:25,931
the names ...
have the same letters.

502
00:40:26,011 --> 00:40:28,451
Edward Daniels has exactly same
13 letters

503
00:40:28,531 --> 00:40:31,011
As Andrew Laeddis.
the same as Rachel and Solando

504
00:40:31,051 --> 00:40:33,451
and Dolore Chan. All names

505
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,851
- Are anagrams of each other.
- Tactics of intimidation........

506
00:40:36,331 --> 00:40:37,811
it doesn't work on me.

507
00:40:37,851 --> 00:40:40,131
You came here for the truth.
Here it is.

508
00:40:40,331 --> 00:40:41,931
Your name is Andrew Laeddis.

509
00:40:42,211 --> 00:40:45,851
the 67th patient at Ashecliffe
is you, Andrew.

510
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:47,931
Bullshit

511
00:40:48,211 --> 00:40:50,651
You were committed here by
court order 24 months ago.

512
00:40:50,731 --> 00:40:53,931
your crime's terrible.
One you can't forgieve yourself.

513
00:40:53,971 --> 00:40:55,731
So you invented
another self.

514
00:41:00,611 --> 00:41:01,731
Let us return to the facts.

515
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:06,131
And have created a story in which
you're not a murderer, you are hearless.......

516
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:08,011
you are a U.S marshal.

517
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:09,451
only here in Ashkliff
because of a case

518
00:41:09,731 --> 00:41:11,051
and you've uncovered conspiracy

519
00:41:11,451 --> 00:41:13,811
So that anything we tell you about
who you are, what you've done

520
00:41:14,451 --> 00:41:16,931
you can dismiss as lies, Andrew

521
00:41:16,971 --> 00:41:18,051
My name is Edward Daniels.

522
00:41:18,651 --> 00:41:21,451
I've been hearing this fantasy
for two years. I know every details.

523
00:41:21,811 --> 00:41:24,211
Patient 67. Storm.
Rachel Solando.

524
00:41:24,331 --> 00:41:26,851
your missing partner
Dreams you have every night.

525
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:29,211
You were at Dachave,
But it could not have killed any guards.

526
00:41:33,131 --> 00:41:36,011
I wish i could let you just
live in your fantasy world

527
00:41:36,531 --> 00:41:37,731
I really do.

528
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:42,851
But are violent, trained, dangerous.
You're the most dangerous patient we have.

529
00:41:43,211 --> 00:41:45,651
You've injured all of the guards
Other patients.

530
00:41:45,731 --> 00:41:48,211
Two weeks ago
you attacked George Noyce.

531
00:41:48,251 --> 00:41:49,731
I did so something!.............................

532
00:41:49,931 --> 00:41:51,731
- You have ............
- off course I didn't.

533
00:41:51,931 --> 00:41:53,931
Give me one reason
why i even touch him.

534
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:55,851
Because he called you Laeddis

535
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:58,131
and you do anything not to be him

536
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:01,931
I have a transcript of that conversation
you had with Noyce yesterday .

537
00:42:01,971 --> 00:42:06,131
This is about you and Laeddis
That's all it's ever been about

538
00:42:08,251 --> 00:42:10,731
This says it's about
"me and Laeddis".

539
00:42:10,771 --> 00:42:13,211
When you've asked him what happened
to his face,

540
00:42:13,251 --> 00:42:15,531
said, and I quote again,
"You did it".

541
00:42:16,051 --> 00:42:19,451
- he meant it was my fault he ...
- you almost killed him.

542
00:42:21,811 --> 00:42:25,451
The warden and the board of overseas
are determined that something be done it's been decided

543
00:42:26,331 --> 00:42:30,211
nevertheles we can bring you back in sanity now
right now

544
00:42:30,851 --> 00:42:33,731
Permanent measures will be taken to ensure
you can't hurt anyone ever again

545
00:42:37,451 --> 00:42:39,651
they lobotomine you, Andrew.

546
00:42:39,731 --> 00:42:41,131
do you understand?

547
00:42:45,011 --> 00:42:46,211
Yes, I understand.

548
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,011
I understand just fine

549
00:42:50,211 --> 00:42:54,091
If , if I don't play along
with your little game here

550
00:42:54,131 --> 00:42:56,651
Dr. Naehring will turn me into
one of his ghosts.

551
00:42:56,731 --> 00:42:58,251
What about my partner?

552
00:42:58,931 --> 00:43:03,051
you mean a U.S. marshal
is a  defense mechanism?

553
00:43:05,051 --> 00:43:06,251
Hey, boss .

554
00:43:24,051 --> 00:43:26,931
What the fuck is going on here?

555
00:43:30,011 --> 00:43:31,531
you're working for him?

556
00:43:32,011 --> 00:43:36,931
I'm sorry about that
someone had to stay with you, keep you safe

557
00:43:39,011 --> 00:43:40,851
You've been watch me, right?

558
00:43:41,531 --> 00:43:43,331
watch me every minute.

559
00:43:45,131 --> 00:43:46,451
Who ... who are you?

560
00:43:46,851 --> 00:43:48,131
Who are you?
Tell me.

561
00:43:48,651 --> 00:43:50,331
don't you recognize me, Andrew?

562
00:43:52,131 --> 00:43:54,651
I've been you primary psychiatrist
for the last two years.

563
00:43:55,931 --> 00:43:57,331
I am Lester Sheehan.

564
00:44:03,331 --> 00:44:05,731
And I told you about my wife ...

565
00:44:05,931 --> 00:44:08,931
- I know.
- I climbed a cliff to save you.

566
00:44:09,651 --> 00:44:13,571
I trusted you. I risked
everything, after you. Everything!

567
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,691
I know, boss `.

568
00:44:14,731 --> 00:44:16,331
we're running out of time here, Andrew,

569
00:44:17,731 --> 00:44:20,211
I swore before the entire board of
overseas that I could construct

570
00:44:20,251 --> 00:44:22,651
The most radical, role-play

571
00:44:22,731 --> 00:44:25,211
ever in history of psychiatry and
that will bring you back.

572
00:44:25,251 --> 00:44:27,731
I thought if we let you play
this out

573
00:44:28,451 --> 00:44:31,331
we could get you to see how
untrue how impossible it is

574
00:44:33,011 --> 00:44:34,331
we've had to tun of the place for two days

575
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:37,731
Tell me, where are the Nazi experiments

576
00:44:38,651 --> 00:44:40,331
The satanic O.R.'s

577
00:44:53,051 --> 00:44:54,651
Andrew, listen to me.

578
00:44:57,011 --> 00:44:58,531
If we fail on you

579
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:01,931
then everything we've tried
to do here will be discredited.

580
00:45:02,051 --> 00:45:03,131
Everything.

581
00:45:05,451 --> 00:45:07,611
We are on the first line of a war, Andrew

582
00:45:09,131 --> 00:45:11,451
and right now, in this place
it comes down to you

583
00:45:18,131 --> 00:45:20,131
Do not move!

584
00:45:20,211 --> 00:45:23,211
- Andrew, no!
- My name is Teddy Daniels.

585
00:45:24,131 --> 00:45:26,851
This one is loaded.
I can tell from the weight.

586
00:45:26,931 --> 00:45:28,931
I see. and that's your firearm marshall
You're sure?

587
00:45:29,451 --> 00:45:30,931
There's a dent in the barrel from
the day Philip Stacks shot at me.........

588
00:45:31,011 --> 00:45:35,131
and the bullet ricocheted. You're not going to mind-fuck me out of this doc

589
00:45:35,171 --> 00:45:38,131
Then blast away, because that's the
only way you're ever getting off this island

590
00:45:44,731 --> 00:45:46,131
Andrew, please don't.

591
00:45:56,851 --> 00:45:57,851
My gun ...

592
00:46:04,731 --> 00:46:06,251
What have you done to
my goddamned gun.

593
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:08,811
It's a toy, Andrew.

594
00:46:11,531 --> 00:46:13,051
we're telling you the truth.

595
00:46:14,531 --> 00:46:17,731
Dolores was insane. Manic-depressive.
suicidal.

596
00:46:18,211 --> 00:46:21,291
You drank. stay away.
ignored what everyone told you.

597
00:46:21,331 --> 00:46:24,211
You moved in that lake house after
she, purposely,

598
00:46:24,331 --> 00:46:26,851
set your city apartment on fire

599
00:46:27,011 --> 00:46:28,651
Andrew... Andrew
stop it

600
00:46:30,851 --> 00:46:31,851
you're lying...

601
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,011
These are your children.

602
00:46:34,851 --> 00:46:36,011
Serena ...

603
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:39,531
- Henry ...
- I have no children.

604
00:46:39,731 --> 00:46:41,131
Your wife drowned them

605
00:46:41,531 --> 00:46:44,011
in the cabin by the lake.

606
00:46:44,131 --> 00:46:46,211
And here, the little girl,
you dream about

607
00:46:46,851 --> 00:46:47,931
every night.

608
00:46:48,651 --> 00:46:49,811
I never had a daughter.

609
00:46:49,851 --> 00:46:53,731
the one who tells you over and over that
you should saved her

610
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:54,931
save them all

611
00:46:55,531 --> 00:46:56,651
Your daughter ...

612
00:46:57,131 --> 00:47:00,011
Her name is Rachel. are you going to deny
that she ever lived?

613
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:02,331
Andrew, are you?

614
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:26,930
I'm so sorry, honey ..

615
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:33,130
I told you not to coming here.

616
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:35,010
I told you ...

617
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:38,130
this would be the end of you.

618
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:00,130
I came back.
we got him

619
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,730
just out of Oklahoma.
must stopped ten places

620
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:05,730
between here and Tulsa
I could sleep for a week

621
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,210
Dolores?

622
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:19,930
Dolores?

623
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:27,130
Dolores?

624
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:41,930
Dolores?

625
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:07,450
Honey ...

626
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:10,930
Why are you all wet?

627
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:15,330
I missed you.

628
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:24,930
I want to go home.

629
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:28,650
You're home!

630
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:34,450
Where are the kids?

631
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:41,210
they're in school.

632
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:46,850
It's Saturday, honey.

633
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:49,210
school's not in on Saturday

634
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:53,610
my school is

635
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:08,450
Oh my God!

636
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:12,130
My God!

637
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:27,850
God!

638
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:33,850
Oh, Good God, no!

639
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:38,130
Come on!
Come on!

640
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:57,930
Please, God, no.

641
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:01,530
No!

642
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:03,530
No!

643
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:10,050
No!

644
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:13,450
No!

645
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:16,810
Let put them in the kitchen.

646
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:19,930
let's dry them off ...

647
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:22,050
change their clothes ...

648
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:27,010
They'll be our living dolls

649
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,450
Tomorrow we can take them on a picnic.

650
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:39,530
If you ever loved me , Dolores ...

651
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:41,730
Please stop talking

652
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:49,650
I need you to love me.

653
00:52:57,930 --> 00:52:59,530
I need you to free me!

654
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:05,810
Honey ...

655
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:10,050
We'll give them baths...

656
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:19,130
- I love you so much Dolores
- And I love you. I love you.

657
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:51,330
Andrew ...

658
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:54,450
Andrew, can you hear me?

659
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:59,250
Rachel!
Rachel, Rachel ...

660
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:02,250
Rachel.

661
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,130
Rachel who?

662
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:10,730
Rachel Laeddis ...

663
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:13,450
My daughter.

664
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:18,730
Why are you here?

665
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,650
Because I killed my wife.

666
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:25,210
and why did you do that?

667
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,730
she murdered our children.

668
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:36,530
And she told me to let her go.

669
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:43,650
- Who is Teddy Daniels?
- he doesn't exist.

670
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:47,530
Neither Rachel Solando.
I made them up.

671
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:48,930
Why?

672
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:52,010
we need to hear you say it.

673
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:00,610
After she trie to kill
her for the first time,

674
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:04,330
Dolores told me that ...

675
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,530
she has an insect ...

676
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:10,450
living inside her brain.

677
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:12,810
she could feel it ...

678
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:17,130
walking cross
her skull ...

679
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:21,730
pulling the wires,
just for fun.

680
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:26,330
she told me that.

681
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:29,210
she told me but i didn't listen

682
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:35,130
I loved her so much.

683
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:38,650
Why did you make them up?

684
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:44,130
Because I can not take knowing
that Dolores killed our children.

685
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:55,850
I killed them, because
i didn't get her some help.

686
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:04,130
I killed them...

687
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:10,650
Here's my theory, Andrew.
we broke through once before,

688
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:13,450
nine months ago,
and then you regressed.

689
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:19,330
- I do not remember that.
- I know.

690
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:22,530
you reset, Andrew.
like a tape

691
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:26,730
playing over and over on an endless loop

692
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:29,850
I hope that what we've done will be enough
to stop it from happening again

693
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:32,330
I need to know ...

694
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:34,850
that you have accepted the reality.

695
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:43,930
You came after me, Doctor?

696
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:49,530
You tried to help me when no one else would

697
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:03,330
My name is Andrew Laeddis ...

698
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:13,450
And I murdered my wife
in the spring of 1952.

699
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:38,850
how we doing this morning?

700
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,850
good.
and You?

701
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:43,010
can't complain.

702
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:54,050
So what's our next move?

703
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:56,130
You tell me.

704
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:03,130
We've gotta get off this rock,
Chuck.

705
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:07,810
Back to the mainland. Whatever the
hell is going on here is bad.

706
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:31,330
Do not worry, partner.
I'm gonna catch this

707
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:39,330
that............ is too small for them.

708
00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:43,130
Yes, we are.
aren't we?

709
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:00,610
You know this place makes
me wonder

710
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:03,050
Yeah? What's that boss?

711
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:06,130
which would be worse?

712
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:09,130
To live as a monster ...

713
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:12,050
or to die as a good man.

714
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:21,450
Teddy?
