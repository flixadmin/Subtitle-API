that hive had Andy killed

because his criminal operations
conflicted with theirs.

at all with what you

some explanation.

have a choice, either.

it's to scramble

it was done with

of an organization
of killers?

325

I'm sure there are
a million things

326
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,250

Well, i... why, so I can...

331
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,590
Hold off some kind of false hope

He doesn't deserve that.

No, he probably
doesn't, but you do.

After Andy died,
a part of you

My nephew in the eye

339
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,870
and tell him that...

340

his daddy again...

The months after Andy died
were the darkest times
of my life.

343
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,360
I would have given anything,

344

345
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,870
I would have sacrificed my life

Thank you. Mr.?

Darhk. I have some ideas

357
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,690
of how I might contribute
to your campaign.

Do you have a minute?
Of course.

359
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,070
Well, it's not just
about financial support.

360
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,700
I have strong relations
in the business circles,

361

That's all well and good,

362
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,430
but I am running unopposed.

So I don't totally understand
how you can help me win.

364
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,010
Oh, it's not about winning.

365
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,380
It's about how much
we can accomplish
if we worked together.

366
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,450
Right.

367

And not to be indelicate,

368
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,380
but a lot has
changed in star city

369

since your parents
held sway here.

370

The levers of power
have changed.

371
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,990
And not understanding
that is what doomed
Jessica Danforth's bid.

372

Hmm.

What do you want,
Mr. darhk?

Reconsider your plans.
Leave the bay as it is.

all of the terrible ideas

you've had over
the past three years,

387
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,130
of which throwing in
with Damien darhk

388
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,570
has got to be the worst.

Isn't Lance already
our man on the inside?

392
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,410
Lance has lost darhk's trust,

393
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,740
making this the only way...

394
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,170
To get yourself killed.

395
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,240
You remember the last time

396
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,840
you tried to take down
an evil organization
from the inside?

397
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,450
This is different.
Why?

398
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,550
Because you'd be doing it
as Oliver queen?
Yep.

399
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,340
What about
your mayoral campaign?

400
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,950
You cannot be an effective
candidate for mayor

and darhk's undercover stooge.

402
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,060
Ahem. Taking down darhk
is more important,

403
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,830
especially now that
we know he has Andy
under his thumb.

404
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,330
First, there is a whole
long list of things that
we don't know about Andy.

405
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,730
Second, you didn't
decide to run for mayor

406
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,460
to take down darhk.

something that the green Arrow

At least not this week.

482
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,110
[Sniffs] Ahh.

483
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,410
Lance has some intel for us.
Hmm?

484
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,480
Slip 52 at the docks.

485
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,740
Felicity checked it out,
and that whole area's

486
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,380
been shut down
for the entire night.

487
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,760
Think the ghosts
have something
planned there?

488
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,080
And maybe your brother.

489
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,820
Every time we face the ghosts,

490
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,550
it's Russian roulette.
I'm not risking
any of you for Andy.

491
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,200
You're not.
We're offering.

492
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,530
Ok. But just us.

493
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,400
Thea and Laurel
sit this one out.

494
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,170
Ok.

495
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,940
Gentlemen, you all come
here from different walks,

496
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,550
different paths.

497
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,720
But all burdened
with the same knowledge...

498
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,590
that this world is diseased.

499
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,990
Fortunately,
there is a cure
for this pestilence.

500
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,730
That cure, gentlemen,

501
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,300
is hive.

502
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,500
Those little yellow
pills you swallowed,

503
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,970
they do a few
interesting things...

504
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,900
including making you
cooperative.

505
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,570
Now, I understand
you all volunteered
and that's just swell.

506
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,570
But I think we can
all agree that in
any chain of command,

507
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,980
there can never be
too much compliance.

508
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,880
[Evil chuckle]

509
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,040
Perhaps a demonstration.

510
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,580
Kneel.

511
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,260
The people of this city...

512
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,820
what's left of them,
at any rate...

513
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:58,630
they call you ghosts.

514
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,010
And they have no idea
how right they are.

515
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,640
Up there!

516
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,470
Kill the green one.

517
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,360
[All grunting]

518
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,610
This isn't on you,
John, it was my call.

519
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:12,410
Ahem. I never
should have
let you make it.

520
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,580
Felicity, can you
give us a second?

521
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,950
No, I think I should stay.

522
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,920
I just, uh, remembered,

523
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,090
I got that thing
in the whatever
with the what's-it.

524
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,120
Oliver, let this go, man.

525
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,550
I have.

526
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,230
You almost got yourself killed.

527
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:32,460
[Coughs] I've been a lot
closer to almost killed.

528
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,060
Andy made his choice.
You don't know that.

529
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,400
John, you saw what was
going on tonight.

530
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,060
Those men, they were
under the influence
of something.

531
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,270
Whatever pill
is scrambling their DNA

532
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,600
is also making them
susceptible to dark suggestion.

533
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,910
All right, just because
you have a blind spot
for your family,

534
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,210
don't expect me to, as well.

535
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,510
That... that's not
what this is about.

536
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,710
The hell it's not.

537
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,190
Family is exactly
what this is about.

538
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,750
Criminal or not.

539
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,350
Under the influence or not.

540
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,860
Andy let his son
and his wife
believe he was dead

541
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,990
for eight years, Oliver.

542
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,020
Eight years!

543
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,000
And there's no excuse for that.

544
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,870
None.

545
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,930
John, I'm just...
you don't know.

546
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,030
Oliver, you don't
know. You have this
inexplicable way

547
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,040
of excusing
everything just
because it's family.

548
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,940
It's not inexplicable!
I'm asking you...

549
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,800
ahem. I'm asking you
to hold out hope for Andy,

550
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,740
because I need that hope.

551
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,750
I need to believe

552
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,820
that no matter what
happens in our lives,

553
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,490
no matter how much
darkness infects us,

554
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:31,790
I need to believe
that we can
come back from that!

555
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,930
And it was exactly that
thinking that led you
to the league last year.

556
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:38,460
Doesn't seem
like you learned
much from that.

557
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,990
Felicity told you?

558
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,530
Getting in bed
with darhk, Oliver?

559
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,690
I don't see how
you can even
consider it.

560
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,700
[Groans]

561
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,880
We are going
to take this guy down,

562
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,170
and no idea is off the table.

563
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,680
I thought
you're doing things
differently, Oliver.

564
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,280
Fighting darhk from the inside

565
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,140
is just fighting darhk
in the shadows.

566
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,920
You want to do
things differently?
You want ideas, fine.

567
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,680
Let's take this
son of a bitch down
in the light of day.

568
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,930
Hey.

569
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,100
Just in time.

570
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,100
For what?

571
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,770
Ah, roasted lizard

572
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,900
with a little bit
of coriander and sea salt.

573
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,350
I've gotten better
at removing the skin
with a sharp rock.

574
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,650
I ate already.

575
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:32,320
Thank you.

576
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,320
Are you all right?

577
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,820
It's a hard day.

578
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,260
Taiana...

579
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,320
I have to...

580
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:49,430
I have to tell you
something about your brother.

581
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,600
Vlad?

582
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,430
Is he all right?

583
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,210
No.

584
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,410
I'm sorry.

585
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,010
What do you mean?

586
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,570
Is he...
taiana...

587
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,080
I'm very sorry.

588
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,780
Hey.
Hey.

589
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,950
Sorry, I had Curtis
grab some more toys

590
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,090
so I could keep
working on your tooth.

591
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,900
That's ok; I don't
think we're going
to be using the table

592
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,840
for eating tonight, anyway.

593
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,940
Oliver and John
are busy fighting over

594
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,010
John's not-so-dead
after all brother.

595
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,610
Do I even want to ask?

596
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,680
Let's just say
you no longer
corner the market

597
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,150
on not being dead
as people think.

598
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,420
Though, in John's
brother's case,

599
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,810
he does have
a pretty good excuse...

600
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,480
unlike some people.

601
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,210
Have you seen anyone?

602
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,090
Of course not;
I've been busy here
working on your tooth.

603
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,990
You're stalling.
Ray, when you come
back from the dead,

604
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,390
you're supposed to
start living again.

605
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,090
What's going on?

606
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,420
I've been catching up
on the past six months.

607
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,600
My company, my city, my life.

608
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,000
And I feel like
tom Sawyer watching
his own funeral.

609
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Except in my case,
nobody really cares.

610
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,770
That is not true, ray.

611
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:04,030
Renaming starling
star city is nice,

612
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,070
but then take a look
to what's happened
to the place.

613
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,780
And my company,
this thing I've built

614
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,010
that was supposed to outlast me,

615
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,620
is now on life support.

616
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,990
Because it needs you.

617
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,320
To do what?

618
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,520
The same thing I was doing
before I died?

619
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,550
Obviously that didn't
amount to anything.

620
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,330
Oh, self-pity is not
a good look on you.

621
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,960
Ah, I don't think
it's self-pity.

622
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,960
I think it's self-reflection.

623
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,990
If I'm going
to come back to life,

624
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,040
I have to figure out
what it is that
I'm living for.

625
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,640
Ok.

626
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,010
I played around
with your bicuspid a bit.

627
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,380
Ah, the, uh, compound
definitely broke down

628
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,110
the residual DNA on the tooth.

629
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,140
It's pretty inventive, actually.

630
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,350
Is there any way to
reconstitute the DNA

631
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,680
so we have a shot
at iding these guys?

632
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,660
No. Once the alleles
are decomposed,

633
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,520
they're gone for good.
Yeah.

634
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,180
So since that was a dead end,

635
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,650
I took another look
at the polymer

636
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,060
the fake tooth was made of.

637
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,520
Uh, I found faint traces
of sodium fluoride.

638
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,990
Like from water?

639
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,740
There's no way that
the concentration

640
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,970
could be high enough
to leave behind
any sort of residue.

641
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,740
It would if there was
an unusually high

642
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,340
sodium fluoride count
in the drinking water,

643
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,480
like say in the facility
that was closed down

644
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,210
for that very reason.

645
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,310
Muller psychiatric center.

646
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,150
You got to admire the irony

647
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,120
of Damien darhk keeping
his army of bad guys

648
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,050
in a defunct looney bin.

649
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:27,280
Not bad for a guy who
thinks his life didn't
add up to anything.

650
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:33,000
Never going to outlive that one.

651
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,800
Everyone clear on the plan?

652
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,170
You know, I wasn't
the first 80 times
we went over it,

653
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,800
but now I think I got it.

654
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,130
What's going on, guys?

655
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,010
Felicity found
a probable location

656
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,340
for the ghosts'
base of operations.

657
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,170
These guys are not going
to be easy to take out.

658
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,450
How are you feeling?
[Sighs]

659
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,390
We're not trying
to take down the ghosts;
We don't have the manpower.

660
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:55,350
Going after Andy.

661
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:58,620
Guys, Oliver nearly
got himself killed
trying to help Andy.

662
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,350
I'm not letting you do the same.

663
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,630
I'm sorry, but it's not
really just up to you.

664
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,400
I did everything that I could

665
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,760
to bring my sister back,

666
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,920
and I think
your brother
deserves the same.

667
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,530
No, Laurel,

668
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,260
that's just it...
i don't think he does.

669
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,940
And I don't know
what Oliver told you...

670
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,370
he told them
the only two things
that matter...

671
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,600
Andy's under darhk's influence,

672
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:17,810
and we need to get him out.

673
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,440
I can't let you risk your life

674
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,900
for someone who
does not deserve it.

675
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,670
That's your call.
But we've made ours.

676
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,380
Let's move.

677
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,890
Oliver: We're onsite.

678
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,870
Oh, satellite's
reading a hell
of a lot of activity

679
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,440
for 3:00 in the morning.
I'm guessing 50
or so ghosts

680
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,140
plus who knows
how many recruits.

681
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,410
Hey, wait,
if the ghosts
are wearing

682
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:49,070
their usual Halloween costume,

683
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,430
then how are we
supposed to tell
which one's Andy?

684
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,600
That's what your fancy
new cameras are for.

685
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:56,070
A little gift from Curtis.

686
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,920
Infrared lenses
should virtually unmask
our ghosty friends.

687
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,220
Sick.

688
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,460
Ok, ready?

689
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,360
I'm in position.

690
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,420
In position.

691
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,800
This isn't just
a base of operations.

692
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,530
It looks like a staging area.

693
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,940
For what?
Equipment.

694
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,140
Military crates marked g6:5.

695
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,900
Does that mean anything?

696
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,140
Maybe they're playing bingo.

697
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,480
Let's assume that's not it.

698
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,620
Deadly bingo.

699
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,920
Ahem. We need to get
an ID on Andy.

700
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,520
When we do, you wait
for my signal
before engaging.

701
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,960
Yeah, I might not
have that option.

702
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,790
Speedy?

703
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,650
She's been spotted,
third floor,
southwest building.

704
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,630
Laurel: I've been spotted,
too. [Grunting]

to get a visual

That's him, you got him,
the one on your right.

710
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:16,720
Actually, he's got
me! [Grunting]

[Elevator dings]

712
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,330
Thea: I got him.
He looks heavy,
I need help in here.

713
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,080
I'm on my way.

714

It's Merida.

Aren't you out
a little bit
past your bedtime?

716
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:30,400
I've seen something
of your fighting style.

717
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,430
You were trained
by ra's al ghul.

718
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,510
Tell me... how is Malcolm
doing these days?

Black canary's got Andy,

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,900
I got this!

Are you sure?
Go!

727
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,720
It's, uh, nice
of you to show up.

728

My brother needed me.

730
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:39,140
Thank you, thank you,

thank you, all of you.

Palmer, even you, thank you.

733
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,540
My pleasure.
Feels good to do

734
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,370
something useful.
It's been a while.

735
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,150
Does that mean I can
expect to see you
at work tomorrow?

736
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,710
Ah... No.

737
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,340
Can't keep doing

738
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,320
the same useless,
ineffective things.

739
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,220
You know? I got to
do something different.

740
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,860
I'm going to take some time
and figure out what that is.

741
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,860
But, uh, it still include
the occasional super heroics
whenever you need me.

742
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,530
Where are you going?

743
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,730
Well, I have a long overdue chat

744
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,890
with my brother.
I hope you were right.

745
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,900
Me, too.

746
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,530
You were right.
About what?

747
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,540
Darhk. I thought
about what you said,

748
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,310
and how to fight him.
I'm going to do it
in the light of day.

749
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,180
Good. What did you have in mind?

750
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,750
You'll see.

00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,550
We never should
have gotten on
that damn boat!

752
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,720
Reiter's men
hijacked the yacht
that we were working on.

753
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,960
I was a dive instructor

754
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,190
and vlad was the deckhand.

755
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,970
They killed everyone
on our charter

756
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,400
and they brought us here.

757
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,400
What happened?

758
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,910
With vlad?

759
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,540
Conklin.

760
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,940

Taiana, wait, wait.

762
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:57,040
I'm going to kill him
for what he did!

763
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:00,250
Conklin is...
is terrible,

764
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,350
but he's not the problem.

765
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,580
He's just a pawn.

766
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,090
Pawn for what?

767
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,090
For reiter's plan.

768
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,750
What is this?

769
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,990
This is a map of lian yu,

770
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,030
and I think that it leads

771

to whatever reiter
is looking for.

something like that?

Well, I had an idea.

777

but it's worth a try.

Yes.

And I'm still not
going to take it.

790

Look... I think
I might have found
a different way

00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,380
And my blood lust was gone.

801
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,590
I mean, at least
for a little while.

802
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:48,560
So what I want
is for you to help me

803
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,930
figure out a way
to make that permanent.

804
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,940
Andy, I don't even
know where to begin.

805
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,050
Andy, I need to understand.

806
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,610
Can you help me understand?

807
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,820
Is what's in this file true?!

808
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,500
Andy, answer me.

809
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,580
It's true.

810
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,210
All of it.

811
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,600
[Birds squawking]

812
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,760
Well, this is quite
a lot of media

813
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:11,270
for a, uh, what'd you call it?

814
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,410
Hippie, crunchy program.
That's right.

815
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,880
Always happy to admit
when I'm wrong.

816
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,120
Good luck up there.
Thank you.

817
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,450
Ok, sorry I'm late.

818
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,810
Ah, you're fine.

819
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,580
We're just getting started.

820
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,290
So, I...

821
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:31,920
Haven't been
arrested
for battery yet.

822
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,600
I keep thinking...

823
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,070
You would have killed him

824
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,640
if I hadn't stopped you.

825
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,130
I just had a really bad night.

826
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,770
I guess I'm just asking if

827
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,830
maybe you could be
a little patient...

828
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,430
With me.

829
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,080
[Indistinct chatter]

830
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,420
Thank you all for coming.

831
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,080
My, uh,

832
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,380
my campaign advisor

833
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:58,320
doesn't think that
saving the bay
is the right fight

834
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,580
given the state the city is in.

835
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:02,850
But I'd like everyone
to know that I'm not blind

836
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,730
to star city's problems.

837
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:08,400
And I wouldn't be here today

838
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,200
if I wasn't confident
that this program
could help solve them.

839
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,660
And the reason I chose the bay

840
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:16,800
is because it's in
the center of the city.

841
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:19,480
It's out in the open.

842
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,610
For everyone to see.

843
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,520
The fight to save star city

844
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,150
isn't going to be
fought in the shadows.

845
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,980
It's going to be fought
in the light of day.

846
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,560
And I promise you,

847
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,690
all of you,

848
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:37,350
that I will never
stop fighting
to save this city.

849
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,520
Woman: We love you!
[Cheers and applause]

850
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,080
Greg, move your head.
