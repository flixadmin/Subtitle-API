1
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,618
<i>Why do we die?</i>

2
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:01,498
<i>What is death?</i>

3
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,581
TIEDEMANN, REGINA
1.8.1971 - 2.9.2019

4
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:04,664
MUM AND SISTER CAVE

5
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,696
<i>Could we escape it if we
knew when to expect it?</i>

6
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:15,293
<i>Is the time of our
departure predetermined?</i>

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,380
<i>Our dying, part of
an endless clockwork?</i>

8
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,628
<i>We all have one truth in common.</i>

9
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,789
<i>We are born.</i>

10
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,441
<i>And we die.</i>

11
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:41,041
<i>No matter what path we take in between.</i>

12
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:18,171
LIFE AND DEATH

13
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,000
Your path will always lead you here.

14
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,308
To Elisabeth.

15
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,393
To me.

16
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,293
Time plays a cruel game.

17
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,268
Have you made your decision?

18
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,311
Just one more day

19
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,673
and we can untie this
knot once and for all.

20
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,280
But you must,

21
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,633
as all of us,

22
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,625
do your part.

23
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,310
Will you see it through?

24
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,206
Eva will never achieve her goal.

25
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,626
Her world doesn't deserve to be saved

26
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,300
any more than ours does.

27
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:35,713
ONE DAY UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

28
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,414
We have to go.

29
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,831
To the nuclear power plant.

30
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,443
We don't have much time.

31
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,333
Jonas?

32
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,950
Never mind.

33
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,385
My God, where were you?

34
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,925
We were looking for
you all day yesterday.

35
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,288
Kilian said you were with him

36
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,765
and then you just
vanished into thin air.

37
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,433
And who are you?

38
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,005
Everything will be okay.

39
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,233
What's wrong?

40
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,516
I have to go now.

41
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,335
Wait at the entrance.

42
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,456
I'll get you out of here tonight at 10.

43
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:35,498
And if anyone asks what you're
doing, say you couldn't sleep.

44
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,206
My mother changes shifts at 5:00 p.m.

45
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,808
She has a keycard.

46
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,860
She always takes the same route.

47
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,998
We'll bring Mikkel back.

48
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,250
I promise.

49
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,040
I promise.

50
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,586
I'm sorry.

51
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,886
For everything.

52
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:27,081
<i>One year after the horrific
events in Chernobyl,</i>

53
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,598
<i>five high-ranking
employees at the reactor</i>

54
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,206
<i>have been given long prison sentences.</i>

55
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,881
<i>Meanwhile, German nuclear power plants</i>

56
00:09:34,883 --> 00:09:38,164
<i>have seen increased safety inspections.</i>

57
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:41,206
Oh, Charlotte. You're back already?

58
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,581
<i>...that German nuclear
power plants are safe.</i>

59
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,664
<i>USA.</i>

60
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,873
<i>German Foreign Affairs
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher</i>

61
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:50,914
<i>addressed the UN General
Assembly in New York</i>

62
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,889
<i>and urged global superpowers</i>

63
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:55,831
<i>to take further steps
towards disarmament.</i>

64
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,498
<i>Bremerhaven.</i>

65
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,827
<i>The German research vessel Polarstern</i>

66
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:01,706
<i>has set out to explore the Antarctic...</i>

67
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,328
Bad day?

68
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,080
<i>The expedition's aim is to
research the hole in the ozone.</i>

69
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:12,793
Have you ever thought whether
it's possible to turn back time?

70
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,250
Yes.

71
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,166
Yes, I have.

72
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,164
And?

73
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,876
Do you think it's possible?

74
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,853
That you can go back and change things?

75
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,310
You're so grown up now.

76
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,171
Grown up enough.

77
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,501
For a long time now I've wanted
to be able to turn back time.

78
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,248
But my place isn't in the past

79
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,000
nor in the future.

80
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,456
But here,

81
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,908
with you.

82
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,263
Are these my parents?

83
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,488
You said there were no photos.

84
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,841
That's not you.

85
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,985
Those aren't your parents.

86
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,498
That's my son and his wife.

87
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,121
And my granddaughter.

88
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:49,414
They died in a car accident.

89
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:53,623
In the night,
when it happened, I woke up.

90
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,245
There was a noise
downstairs in the shop.

91
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,368
And 2 women were there.

92
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,748
They looked peculiar.

93
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,380
They were carrying a bundle.

94
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,776
That bundle was you.

95
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,078
They said

96
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:22,331
that everything would be
taken from me that very night.

97
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,173
And that at the same time,
I would be given everything.

98
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,289
And then I got the call.

99
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,789
On the bridge,

100
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:37,831
a truck had forced my
son's car into the river.

101
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,831
They only ever found the
bodies of my son and his wife.

102
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,493
My granddaughter...

103
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,630
was never found.

104
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,926
This is the only thing

105
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,946
that you had with you.

106
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,678
FOR CHARLOTTE

107
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,706
I don't understand this.

108
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,308
Who are my parents?

109
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,788
Charlotte...

110
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,575
Who am I?

111
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,498
I don't know.

112
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,576
I don't know.

113
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,433
- Charlotte?
- One of your colleagues let me in.

114
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,414
I have questions about
the dead boy in the bunker.

115
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,096
I hope that's okay.

116
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,485
Are you all right?

117
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,826
The planning meeting for
dismantling the facility.

118
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,320
Everyone's getting nervous.

119
00:14:22,322 --> 00:14:24,525
In a year this is all meant to be over.

120
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:29,498
I never would have thought
it would end like this.

121
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,180
But that's how it is.

122
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,546
There's a time for everything.

123
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,130
When exactly did you come to Winden?

124
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,278
Autumn of 1986.

125
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,156
Why?

126
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,561
And when did you start working here?

127
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,643
Around the same time.

128
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,193
So you got the shift schedules?

129
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:18,128
I was wondering if you
archive the shift schedules.

130
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,805
Long term.

131
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,033
What month is this about?

132
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,230
Not month.

133
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,578
1986.

134
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,581
POLICE

135
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,788
Hello, Claudia.

136
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,953
We need more men!

137
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,464
Come on.

138
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,998
We need to go.

139
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,710
I'm not going with you.

140
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,955
They're dead, Daddy.

141
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,706
We haven't...

142
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,248
found them.

143
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:17,831
If they're alive, why
haven't they come back?

144
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,463
Why aren't they looking for us?

145
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,123
They're dead.

146
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,375
Everyone here is dead.

147
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,415
I don't want to do this anymore.

148
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,498
POLICE

149
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,310
You're from another world?

150
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,065
What do you want here?

151
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,876
I'm here to guide you into the light.

152
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,831
There are 2 groups out there

153
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,003
who are fighting for
supremacy in time travel.

154
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,733
Light and shadow.

155
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,035
I want you to join our side.

156
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,151
Eva's side.

157
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,501
Eva?

158
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,923
You thought you could
trust him, but you can't.

159
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,789
Who?

160
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:28,791
Jonas.

161
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,528
He belongs to the shadow.

162
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,458
Jonas?

163
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,543
He's dead.

164
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:39,583
No.

165
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,666
He's not.

166
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,706
He wants to obliterate both
worlds and destroy the knot.

167
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,878
He doesn't yet know that's
what he'll want in the end.

168
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,463
But all the impulses on his
journey will lead him there.

169
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,575
But Eva wants to save both worlds.

170
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,956
I don't understand.

171
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,498
Jonas said we could change it.

172
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,748
We change one component, which
will change the entire world.

173
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,880
That's what you told him.

174
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,770
Your older self.

175
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,425
A positive feedback loop.

176
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:23,789
Jonas opened the passage in 2020.

177
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:27,456
The older Jonas had shut
it prior to that, in 2019.

178
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:31,289
After it had been opened for the
first time in the summer of 1986.

179
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:35,171
All three times, cesium
residue was left behind.

180
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,330
A component of the black matter.

181
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,540
Radioactive half-lives.

182
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:47,078
In each cycle, at all 3 moments,

183
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:52,128
cesium is brought back into the
tunnel before it has fully decayed.

184
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,878
It expands exponentially ad infinitum.

185
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,873
So that's how the passage was created.

186
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,675
And that's how it must
continue to exist for eternity.

187
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,039
Everything has to happen again.

188
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:10,206
Jonas bringing the
matter into the passage,

189
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:13,958
the opening of one of the drums in
the plant triggering the apocalypse.

190
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,378
Everything in this loop repeats itself.

191
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:20,878
Life.

192
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,000
And death.

193
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:33,325
WARNING!
SECURITY ZONE NO TRESPASSING

194
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,914
What exactly is in these barrels?

195
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:47,426
I don't know.

196
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:53,976
But something happened
here in the summer of 1986.

197
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,081
An accident.

198
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,581
And what remained,

199
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,843
the substance in the barrels...

200
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,630
that makes it possible
to travel through time.

201
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:12,516
They're bringing the truck
with the barrels in today.

202
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,578
We'll wait until nightfall.

203
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:30,745
Oh, crap.

204
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,100
It's fine. Just a scratch.

205
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,920
What's wrong?

206
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,368
That scratch.

207
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,813
She had it.

208
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,990
The Martha who brought me here.

209
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,976
Everything repeats itself.

210
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:24,296
She wanted to change it.

211
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:28,458
But if you become her,
everything stays the same.

212
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,055
Why did Eva lie?

213
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,615
She said there was a way to save it.

214
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:38,701
My world.

215
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,498
I've got no idea about your
world, but this is my world.

216
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,528
If I can stop the barrels being opened,
if it's possible to stop it all...

217
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:52,003
And what if that's what she wants?

218
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,540
For it all to happen again?

219
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:02,275
Maybe she doesn't want us to stop it.

220
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:05,955
Maybe it's us

221
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,930
who trigger it in the first place.

222
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:15,386
- Why would she want that?
- Because they're all lying!

223
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,873
The entire time

224
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:22,095
I've done what the
others have told me to do.

225
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:26,908
And it just made everything worse.

226
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:32,216
I have to go back to Eva.

227
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:35,511
I finally want to
know what the truth is.

228
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:41,961
Jonas.

229
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:00,166
Jonas, wait!

230
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:29,733
You need a special invitation,
or what?

231
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:33,285
Coming or not?

232
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:48,398
Excuse me.

233
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,250
If I walk, how long does
it take to get to Winden?

234
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:54,781
If I were you, I'd reconsider.

235
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,789
Winden is like a black hole.

236
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:01,221
Once you're there, you never get out.

237
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,180
You all right?

238
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:21,483
It's complicated.

239
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:29,481
Almost everything is complicated.

240
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,160
What are you doing here?

241
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:41,616
It's complicated.

242
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:55,833
My mother died.

243
00:27:57,958 --> 00:27:59,598
My father lives here.

244
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:05,596
Until a few days ago, I didn't
even know who my father was.

245
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,710
She told me.

246
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:14,425
Shortly before she died.

247
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:27,583
Do you believe it's possible to
bring someone back from the dead?

248
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,040
How's that supposed to work?

249
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:37,878
You have to get them before they die.

250
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:51,866
I'm Peter.

251
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:55,168
Charlotte.

252
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:05,333
Peter?

253
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,883
Back from school so early?

254
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,789
I didn't go.

255
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:15,041
What do you mean, you didn't go?

256
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,590
What are you doing here?

257
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:22,176
I saw Aleksander.

258
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:25,875
The day Mads disappeared,
Helge was working at the plant.

259
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:29,835
His shift ended at 6:00 p.m. Mads
disappeared at around 6:21 p.m.

260
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,850
You're not serious, are you?

261
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,206
I don't know why Helge said that.

262
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:41,539
But he had nothing to do with Mads

263
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:44,039
or with the boy you found.

264
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:45,706
He was with us all evening.

265
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:48,458
Your father may be involved
in the murders of two boys.

266
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:54,581
- She's not deaf!
- Erik is still missing.

267
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,583
This penny, what does it mean?

268
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,535
Ulrich is right.

269
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,540
It's all somehow connected.

270
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:14,225
Ulrich?

271
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,090
I have to go back to the office.

272
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:58,021
Hey, wait.

273
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:09,215
Don't be scared.

274
00:32:04,833 --> 00:32:06,553
Do you live here alone?

275
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:15,738
I asked if you live alone.

276
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:57,578
I've no idea when I last ate warm food.

277
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:53,128
It's time.

278
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:58,171
You have to let her go, Franziska.

279
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:12,461
Adam can never be allowed
to untie that knot.

280
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:17,206
You have to lead them.

281
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:18,648
Jonas.

282
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,239
Noah.

283
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:21,981
Elisabeth.

284
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:27,483
I don't understand.

285
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:32,955
- Lead them where?
- Down the same path.

286
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,490
Again and again.

287
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,956
We have to preserve the knot.

288
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:41,347
In your world you must
do all you can to do that,

289
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:42,988
as I must in mine.

290
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:48,539
Jonas. You'll have to guide him.

291
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:50,631
And then later, defy him.

292
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,000
- How will I know what I must do?
- It's all in there.

293
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:02,573
We'll see each other again.

294
00:40:02,575 --> 00:40:04,081
In your world.

295
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:05,773
Soon.

296
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:07,405
Hold on, wait!

297
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:27,288
Jonas?

298
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:30,891
What if it's the truth?

299
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:39,303
If there can only be one world.

300
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:43,236
Yours or mine.

301
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,050
You decided long ago.

302
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:19,346
You want to go back.

303
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:22,378
To your world.

304
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:36,963
I didn't want any of this.

305
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,833
You have to believe me.

306
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:51,625
You didn't want any of this?

307
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,990
Last night...

308
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:05,046
you didn't want that?

309
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,210
This is wrong.

310
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,630
I'm wrong here.

311
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:10,163
So this is wrong, hey?

312
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,110
Are you following me?

313
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:25,985
What do you want?

314
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:36,095
The keycard.

315
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:39,373
You're crazy.

316
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:41,789
I don't want to hurt you.

317
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:43,398
The keycard!

318
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,539
I know you. I knew it right away,
that first day in the hospital.

319
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:49,331
Where do I know you from?

320
00:44:57,625 --> 00:44:59,125
Mum, stop it!

321
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:04,538
What did you say?

322
00:46:18,583 --> 00:46:20,498
I'm not your mother.

323
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,290
You come from hell.

324
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,081
The devil sent you.

325
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,633
You're not real.

326
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:37,723
I got rid of you.

327
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:40,181
I got rid of you.

328
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:27,431
Here. You go inside.

329
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:30,233
I'll grab the rest.

330
00:49:01,666 --> 00:49:03,036
Right...

331
00:49:06,633 --> 00:49:08,433
here we are again.

332
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,040
Should I make us a hot chocolate?

333
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,870
Or are you hungry?

334
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:27,288
Michael?

335
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:30,296
Are you hungry?

336
00:49:58,125 --> 00:50:00,295
Mum, is everything all right?

337
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:02,576
You're bleeding!

338
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:15,485
Mum, what happened?

339
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:20,245
Mum, say something.

340
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:37,876
What is that?

341
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:41,815
Is that from Ulrich?

342
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,123
You dirty little slut.

343
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,680
You're not worthy of
the name you were given!

344
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:03,740
I should've gotten rid of you too.

345
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,180
What is this place?

346
00:54:33,125 --> 00:54:35,225
It is what will become of you.

347
00:54:42,166 --> 00:54:43,746
Adam and Eva.

348
00:54:58,458 --> 00:55:01,828
And thus everything starts over again.

349
00:55:05,375 --> 00:55:06,785
You lied.

350
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:11,978
You said we could save both worlds,
but we can only save one.

351
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:14,055
Or is that a lie too?

352
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,748
I want to go back!

353
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,039
Now!

354
00:55:20,041 --> 00:55:21,641
To my world!

355
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:33,181
Of course you do.

356
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,700
But there is no way back for you.

357
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:42,735
What do you mean?

358
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:48,963
A human being lives 3 lives.

359
00:55:51,458 --> 00:55:53,488
The first one ends

360
00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:57,456
with the loss of naiveté.

361
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:02,028
The second...

362
00:56:02,916 --> 00:56:05,126
with the loss of innocence.

363
00:56:09,416 --> 00:56:10,866
And the third...

364
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:14,228
with the loss of life itself.

365
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:31,706
Yours ends here and now.

366
00:56:31,708 --> 00:56:32,918
What?

367
00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:47,664
You have accomplished what you
were sent to this world for.

368
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:49,706
We've accomplished nothing.

369
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:52,373
She said we had to stop the apocalypse.

370
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:55,539
- The barrels in the power plant...
- You'll understand it all

371
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:57,671
when it's time for you to understand.

372
00:57:36,666 --> 00:57:38,286
Who are you?

373
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:41,275
I'm sorry.

374
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:49,708
No. Jonas!

375
00:57:59,916 --> 00:58:02,123
Jonas, stay with me.

376
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:03,735
Please, I can't...

377
00:58:45,875 --> 00:58:47,455
Please, Jonas.

378
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:52,080
I'll make this right.

379
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:02,325
No, no.
