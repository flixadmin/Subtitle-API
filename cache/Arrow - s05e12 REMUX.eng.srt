1
00:00:02,128 --> 00:00:03,963
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:05,256
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:08,759
I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.

4
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:11,387
Today, I fight that war on two fronts.

5
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:13,973
By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.

6
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:15,933
But by night, I am someone else.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,977
I am something else.

8
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,438
I am the Green Arrow.

9
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:22,982
Previously on Arrow...

10
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:24,551
Really sorry about this, Sergeant.

11
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:26,628
You're not here to secure the trigger.
You're stealing it.

12
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,422
You want to read your confession
before you sign it?

13
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:31,782
- You did this.
- No one will ever believe your story.

14
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:34,952
We call ourselves Helix.
We're calling the data cache "Pandora."

15
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,246
With it, you can spark revolutions.

16
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,582
So, you're not just
giving me the file for John?

17
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,476
I've got all we need to exonerate John.

18
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,419
- Well, how'd you do that?
- Long story.

19
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:47,465
Pleased to meet you.

20
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:51,802
I know exactly how this brotherhood works,
and right now, it works for me.

21
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:57,433
Shipwrecked on Lian Yu, fled to Hong Kong,
and now, you're mixed up with the Bratva.

22
00:00:57,642 --> 00:01:01,187
The man who survived all this
is destined for so much more.

23
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,731
You need to give the monster an identity.

24
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,858
It's only when the monster
becomes someone else,

25
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:09,362
something else,
that you're free to be Oliver Queen.

26
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,905
I don't know if I'm ready.

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,907
I will help you become ready.

28
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:26,504
What are we doing here?
These are low-level drug dealers.

29
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,422
They're target practice.

30
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:35,429
Stop!

31
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,076
You're beginning to understand now.

32
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,536
Understand what?

33
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:02,540
That the man who embraces the dark
is never without sight.

34
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:09,130
Okay,
so is this the Orchid Bay facility

35
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:10,423
or the Downtown rebuild?

36
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:12,550
How long until the announcement?

37
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,195
Don't you have a chief of staff
who usually handles this stuff?

38
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,013
- Excuse us, please.
- Okay.

39
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,724
Thea is looking into a few
joint initiatives that I proposed

40
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:21,392
while in Hub City last week.

41
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,802
Oh, that's really too bad. I've come to
look forward to her many looks of death.

42
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,147
Thea likes you, she's just...

43
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,441
It's okay, Oliver.
She's not the Queen I'm seeing.

44
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,586
That's sort of an old-fashioned way
to say it, don't you think?

45
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,446
Well, I'm not really sure
how else to put it

46
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,323
given that we haven't progressed.

47
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,408
A funny way of saying
we haven't slept together.

48
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:39,910
Hi.

49
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:44,957
Hi, Quentin,
I wasn't expecting to see you today.

50
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,251
Well, you know,
that's the thing about rehab.

51
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,337
It's a long process, and then it ain't.

52
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:52,256
And by the looks of that assistant
out there, you need me back bad.

53
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:54,258
- How about I give you guys a moment?
- Yeah.

54
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:57,928
It's all right, Ms. Williams. I wasn't
planning on keeping my problems a secret.

55
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:02,266
In fact, I wanted to talk with you
about them. You know, on camera.

56
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:05,102
- I'll have my people set up an interview.
- Thank you.

57
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:09,899
I believe you are running late
for a press conference, Mr. Mayor.

58
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,863
- Oh, you live a complicated life.
- How are you?

59
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,133
You know, I'm better
than I've been in a long while, thanks.

60
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:20,993
That's fantastic to hear, but...
Look, maybe we shouldn't...

61
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:23,430
What, push my luck
by sitting down with your new girlfriend?

62
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:26,334
Well, no, just wait a little bit,
let Thea come back and prep you, and...

63
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:29,001
Oliver, if I were any more dry,
I'd be dust, okay?

64
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,463
I'm ready to move forward.
And this is how.

65
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:36,217
Now, didn't Ms. Williams say you were late
for a press conference?

66
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,426
Yep.

67
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,845
I like to thank District Attorney Chase

68
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:43,933
who stepped out of his lane
to represent my friend John Diggle

69
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,976
to make sure that justice was done.

70
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:50,398
Mr. Chase's efforts further exemplify
Star City takes care of their own.

71
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,526
Thank you, everybody, that'll be all.

72
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:56,487
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

73
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:57,655
For getting me out.

74
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,658
Thank whoever leaked the NSA's case
against Walker. My job was easy.

75
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,701
Congratulations, Mr. Diggle.

76
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,621
I was wondering if the DA
might have a second to chat?

77
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,070
Save your energy, Ms. Williams,

78
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:09,648
I know you're doing a story
on the death of Detective Malone.

79
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,835
I have no comment for you.

80
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,879
And yet everyone I spoke to
said you're the man to speak to.

81
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,049
It's a little odd for a DA
to be so involved in a police matter.

82
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,884
The victim
was a member of the ACU.

83
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:22,680
That office is monitored by City Hall,
not by the SCPD.

84
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,723
- Oh, my God.
- Not what you wanted to hear?

85
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:27,351
Military police just took General Walker
into custody.

86
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:30,438
Walker and his men
just shot their way off of Fort Zerillo.

87
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,232
Thirty dead, and he and his men
are in the wind.

88
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:36,110
And the nuke trigger he stole
in Chechnya is still missing.

89
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,204
What can you tell us?

90
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,206
Lots. But first, welcome back.

91
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:51,333
- Hugs, kisses, warm feelings.
- Likewise.

92
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:54,688
I just got word from Lyla that A.R.G.U.S.
discovered a batch of encrypted emails

93
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,690
between Walker
and a group of Markovian separatists.

94
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:58,817
He's looking to sell the nuke.
We can't let that happen.

95
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,927
We have the US military and A.R.G.U.S.
hunting Walker.

96
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:04,472
They can't go where it's going.
The sale's in Russia.

97
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,265
This one's personal.

98
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:09,894
I gotta take that murderous son of a bitch
off the grid right now, whatever it takes.

99
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,530
City Hall gives me access
to a private plane.

100
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:14,887
- I'm coming, too.
- Felicity...

101
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:16,317
This is personal for me as well.

102
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,236
I promised I'd never let
another Havenrock happen again

103
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:22,072
as long as it was in my power,
and I believe that this qualifies.

104
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:25,242
Walker will have his whole unit with him,
maybe even some Markovians.

105
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,814
We need the whole team for this.

106
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:30,456
Agreed, but Quentin just got out of rehab,
and with Thea out of town I...

107
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,645
I need someone to keep an eye on him.

108
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,376
Who'd you have in mind?

109
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,639
Better be the report
on the Washington district water projects.

110
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,224
Not exactly, hoss.

111
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,768
- What are you... What?
- Why aren't you in your office?

112
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:54,438
Well, I came in here to work 'cause
everyone's been dropping by my office

113
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,249
asking how I am,
and I don't need the attention.

114
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,959
And by the way, I just got off the phone
with Oliver

115
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,128
who says he's on the way to Russia.
So what are you doing here?

116
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:03,614
Oliver said I'm supposed to help you prep
for your interview with Susan Williams,

117
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:06,867
and it was safer for me to be here
than over there

118
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,619
starting an "international incident."

119
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,829
Also, you need talk to your receptionist.

120
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,059
She didn't believe I was here for you,
I had to sneak past her just to get in.

121
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,126
I wonder how
she could've made that mistake.

122
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,649
Listen, why don't you just do us
both a favor, all right?

123
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:22,609
Just go home, polish your hockey mask
or something,

124
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:25,593
and I'll just tell Oliver you were here
the whole time. That's cool, right?

125
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:30,349
Sure. Except you're fresh out of rehab,
not a politician, about to face the media.

126
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,770
- So, what's it hurt to have a little help?
- Oh, just my waking sanity.

127
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,345
All right, well, pull up a chair.

128
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,321
Alrighty.

129
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,282
- Coffee?
- Sure.

130
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,889
Okay, this whole flying private thing
is something I could really get used to.

131
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:53,998
Being Mayor has its perks.

132
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,500
You're lucky that Star City's
"sister city" is in Russia.

133
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:58,168
As of 12 hours ago, at least.

134
00:06:58,377 --> 00:06:59,378
You ready for this?

135
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,855
When I signed on, I didn't think

136
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,119
I'd be stopping a nuclear arms sale
in a foreign country.

137
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:06,343
Yeah, when I signed on,
I didn't think I'd be dealing with aliens.

138
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:07,761
- Aliens?
- Yeah.

139
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,410
John said you had friends in Russia.

140
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,307
One friend.
Reached out, didn't hear back...

141
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,684
- Oliver Queen!
- Anatoly!

142
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,856
You never should have come back to Russia.

143
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:28,490
- Anatoly?
- Alexi Leonov. You remember him, yes?

144
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,868
- He was one of your brothers.
- I can explain.

145
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,536
You asked favor of him.

146
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:36,874
He asked favor in return,
and you pulled gun on him instead?

147
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:40,085
You know why I can't be some Bratva thug.

148
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,464
You made promise. You swore oath.

149
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,550
And now one of your brothers is dead.

150
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:50,012
So why should I welcome you as brother?

151
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,725
Go home, Oliver.
There's nothing for you here.

152
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,489
Ugh. Feel like somebody died
of tuberculosis in here.

153
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:10,824
What's the Russian word for creepy?

154
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,284
Zhutko.

155
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:16,413
I was studying on the plane.
Where did you find this place?

156
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,082
Lyla.

157
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,751
This used to be an A.R.G.U.S. safe house,

158
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,379
but as you can tell
from Amero-Russian relations,

159
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,690
- it hasn't been used much lately.
- Yeah, no kidding.

160
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,883
Right.
And why aren't we working with A.R.G.U.S.?

161
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:29,927
I assume preventing black market
nuclear deals

162
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,571
would be pretty high on their to-do list.

163
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:32,638
John's right about Russia.

164
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:35,408
A.R.G.U.S. can't operate here
without causing a diplomatic crisis.

165
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,193
Oh, yes, speaking of diplomatic crises,
why did your friend punch you?

166
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,939
Three years ago, I used a Bratva contact
when I was trying to track Slade Wilson.

167
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:46,735
He asked me for something in exchange,
I refused. Slade Killed him.

168
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:51,091
How long do you think
until we're up and running?

169
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:53,134
I'm not sure. I'm pretty much
starting from scratch here,

170
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:56,398
and I have to hack the Russian server to
see if we can find any chatter on Walker,

171
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,932
and that might take no time,
or it might take, like, a lot of time.

172
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,208
What about your Bratva friend
with the good right hook?

173
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,498
You could try making nice.

174
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:03,711
It's not that simple.

175
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:07,089
Yeah, well, simple or not, Oliver,
we have to use every asset we've got.

176
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,109
I made a mistake with Leonov.

177
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:30,028
It was a challenging time.

178
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:34,324
But you still owe me for Gregor.

179
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,795
Lucky for you, I never liked Leonov. Sit.

180
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,883
John Diggle, it's good to see you.
Now you my favorite American.

181
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,342
Thanks.

182
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,095
So, what brings you to Russia?

183
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,639
We're looking for a US general
that has gone rogue.

184
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:01,477
We have reason to believe he's trying
to sell a nuke to Markovian terrorists.

185
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:02,936
What concern is that of yours?

186
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:04,897
Are you gonna help me
find this man or not?

187
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,485
After business with Leonov,

188
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,363
just me sitting with you
squares us with Gregor, yes?

189
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,908
Fine.

190
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,534
Then, we are even.

191
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:20,621
And back to how things work in Bratva.

192
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,080
I help you, you help me.

193
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:25,542
An arrangement you refused with Leonov,
if I'm not mistaken.

194
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:30,756
An arrangement I'm going to refuse again.
That part of my life is over.

195
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:33,884
Well, then I cannot help you.

196
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,054
But I can offer you some free advice.

197
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,056
Act quickly, Oliver.

198
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,768
The Markovians do not,
as you Americans say,

199
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:44,394
"Sit on their hands."

200
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,236
You did well.

201
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:55,072
You've proven to be a most adept student.

202
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:58,450
I know a few teachers
who would disagree with that assessment.

203
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,580
Hideo Yamane.
His name is in my father's notebook.

204
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,123
And for good reason.

205
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,417
Mr. Yamane's criminal enterprise
is responsible

206
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:10,170
for much of the designer drug trade
in Starling City.

207
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,840
I think you'll recognize
his chief product?

208
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:23,183
My sister was using this,
so I killed her dealer.

209
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:29,314
But I didn't consider the supply.
I left her, I left the city vulnerable.

210
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:33,360
This is why I found you, Oliver.
So you can correct your mistakes.

211
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:38,657
Now, Mr. Yamane is in town tonight
meeting with his Russian contacts.

212
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,827
He's a careful man,
he'll be heavily guarded.

213
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,248
- Am I ready?
- That's what we find out tonight.

214
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,680
Sorry. I don't really have much control
beyond "on" and "off."

215
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,892
Yeah, probably because you just produced
the sound of 1,000 Beyoncés?

216
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,978
I mean, polyphonics doesn't even begin
to explain what you're doing.

217
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,856
Can you guys please keep it down?

218
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:12,792
Okay, Walker has gone completely dark.

219
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:15,402
There is no way of pinpointing his IP
or his GPS from his phone,

220
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,613
which is probably just a burner anyway.

221
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,449
- That's good.
- How is that good?

222
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,993
Military men
tend to be creatures of habit.

223
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,363
If Walker's using a burner, odds are
it's the same model he used in the States.

224
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,457
And the only one
making calls to the Markovians.

225
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,677
Walker's flip phone of choice
is an old model.

226
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,086
The only network here
that supports it is DetraLink DST.

227
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,181
Can you hack it?

228
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,309
I mean, I could,
but it would take a lot of time.

229
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,161
I think I know someone
that could get us a shortcut.

230
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,686
You have contacts in Russia, too?

231
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:53,106
Well, kind of.
He might need a little bit of convincing.

232
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,878
Think you two could look like Bratva?

233
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:10,624
Sorry. I mean prosti.

234
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,563
- I can't see a thing in these.
- Tough guys don't say sorry, Curtis.

235
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,464
Right. No prosti.

236
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:19,049
Guys, focus.

237
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,052
Why isn't Dinah here with us?

238
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,696
Look, I'm secure enough in my manhood

239
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,431
to admit that she is way more intimidating
than either one of us.

240
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,059
Yes, and a total unknown quantity.

241
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:33,814
Look tough.

242
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:48,286
Maxim Ostrovsky. You speak English.
I suggest you start using it.

243
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,831
Who are you? What do you want?

244
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,916
To talk in private.

245
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,963
Don't make me ask you again.

246
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:08,473
Who are you?

247
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,393
Someone who needs access
to your system's credentials.

248
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,103
You work for DetraLink.

249
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,107
Not for long, I won't,
if I gave you my sign-in materials.

250
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,610
Funny, you didn't seem worried
about losing your job

251
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:24,448
when you ignored company policy to notify
the Kremlin about certain suspicious

252
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,325
and terrorist-like activity
on your network last year.

253
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:28,952
How do you know about that?

254
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,913
Better question is, who would I tell?

255
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,668
Because I am sure that the Kremlin
would love to hear about this.

256
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,295
You can't.

257
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,715
My family, they'll kill them.

258
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,052
Yes.

259
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:50,640
So I suggest it's in your best interest
to give me exactly what I want.

260
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,233
Time to go.

261
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:01,568
Prosti.

262
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,953
That guy was seriously shaken.
What'd you say?

263
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:05,989
What he needed to hear.

264
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:08,200
I've got what we need
to get a location on Walker.

265
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,551
Recon's in position.
I count 10 civilians in the church.

266
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,595
No sign of Walker or his men.

267
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,224
Backstop's also in position.
No activity here.

268
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,686
Are we sure
this is the spot, Overwatch?

269
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:40,440
Walker's phone just went active
from that address.

270
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,776
There.

271
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:45,695
John, there are civilians here.

272
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,406
I don't care, Oliver,
this may be our only shot.

273
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:54,121
We're moving on the target.
Everyone, stay sharp.

274
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,215
Proximity alarm!

275
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:06,758
Walker knew we were coming.

276
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,718
Diggle, get down!

277
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,789
- Are you guys hearing that?
- I'm guessing those aren't fireworks.

278
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,541
Recon, get those civilians clear.
Backstop...

279
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:22,858
I'm coming in.

280
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,239
I don't know
who you gentlemen are,

281
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:32,450
but I wanna thank you for
being so damn eager to find me.

282
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,930
- You guys all right?
- Yeah, we're good.

283
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,140
We lost Walker.

284
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,225
- Overwatch, do you have eyes on?
- Negative.

285
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,674
- All right, meet us out back.
- We've gotta find Walker.

286
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:02,939
We have his man.
He'll take us right to him. Come on.

287
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,580
What the hell is this?
There's no way you're A.R.G.U.S. or D.O.D.

288
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:19,873
Shut up.

289
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,417
Do whatever you want,
I'm not telling you anything.

290
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:26,129
There are thousands,
maybe millions, of lives at stake.

291
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,387
You don't want those deaths
on your conscience.

292
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:33,511
My conscience? You gotta be kidding.
What's that?

293
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:37,224
- This is your conscience.
- Stop!

294
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:40,227
Nothing stops.
Nothing stops until you tell me

295
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,729
when and where the buy is happening.

296
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:47,484
Now you have five minutes to decide
what you want your face to look like.

297
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,052
Oliver, you're just gonna leave him
in there?

298
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,077
Just give it time.

299
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,680
Oliver, we don't have time!
We have to get Walker now, right now!

300
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,807
Let me in there, and I'll give him
all the persuasion he needs.

301
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,167
He's gonna crack.
If you push him too hard right now,

302
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:06,856
he'll tell you whatever you wanna hear
to get the pain to stop.

303
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:09,756
We have to be smart, John, you know that.

304
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:25,230
As much as I enjoy my visits
to Mother Russia,

305
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:28,858
have you ever considered
relocating to Starling City?

306
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:41,538
What do you want? Money? Drugs?
I'll give you anything.

307
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,125
There's nothing you have that I want.

308
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,377
Why, why are you doing this?

309
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:51,298
Because you have failed Starling City.

310
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,182
All right, I got transcripts
of past interviews

311
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:04,185
Williams has done with alkies and addicts,
no offense.

312
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,563
Is you being here
really necessary?

313
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,065
Oliver wanted me to help you
prep for the interview.

314
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,192
So how about some practice questions?

315
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,445
All right, so you just got out of rehab.

316
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,090
What makes you think you're still fit
to serve as deputy mayor?

317
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,575
Well, that's a
very excellent question, Susan.

318
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:21,036
- Ms. Williams.
- "Ms. Williams..."

319
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,414
Well, I think
it's my dedication to this city.

320
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,584
- I have lived here my whole life...
- So have lots of people.

321
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:30,191
And I'm pretty sure not all of them
are recovering alcoholics.

322
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,731
I think it's been
my ability to persevere...

323
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,733
What are you persevering through?
Could you be more specific?

324
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:36,277
Well, I'm trying to. Would you let me
get a word in edgewise, please?

325
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,345
You think Susan Williams is gonna go
any easier?

326
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:41,431
Now, when did the drinking begin?

327
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,463
Was it before or after
the death of your daughter, Laurel?

328
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:47,729
What'd you just say?

329
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,777
Do you hold yourself
accountable for her death?

330
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,468
Or for working with Damien Darhk?

331
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,413
You shut your damn mouth
about my daughter!

332
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,087
Dude, chill! I'm just trying to help.

333
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,447
You're trying to help? Great.

334
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:01,785
I'm gonna leave here and when I get back,
you don't be here.

335
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,087
It's just me.

336
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:20,303
You know you have
a workstation inside, right?

337
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,972
Yeah, I wasn't having any luck
locating Walker,

338
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:26,184
so I decided I'd work on my frustration
in private.

339
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:28,853
What?

340
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,272
The guy back in the teahouse,

341
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,692
didn't look like someone
who owed you a favor.

342
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:39,989
He was terrified.
Felicity, what's really going on?

343
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:44,619
The NSA file that exonerated John.

344
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,165
It was part of a cache of information
given to me by a hacker group,

345
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:55,713
and that cache includes intel that I used
to pressure the DetraLink exec.

346
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,715
You mean you blackmailed him.

347
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,175
Well...

348
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:04,597
For this data cache to have exactly
what you needed for this particular guy,

349
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,101
it has to be huge.

350
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,978
I think the term is "beyond massive."

351
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,190
What?

352
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:17,110
One of the last things my dad said to me

353
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,028
when he gave me the rags,

354
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:24,701
was that they hold a power most
people could never even imagine.

355
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:30,039
And that I needed
to respect and guard that power,

356
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:32,959
not abuse it.

357
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:36,421
The people in this data cache,
they're not good people.

358
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,717
I'm starting to believe that my purpose
on this Earth is to stop people like them,

359
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:43,094
like Walker, no matter what the cost.

360
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,016
And sometimes
you gotta fight fire with fire.

361
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:51,936
I'm not worried about them,
I'm worried about you.

362
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,774
I thought you were
working on locating Walker.

363
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:57,984
Yeah.

364
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:01,029
Is everything okay?

365
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:06,326
This might be none of my business but
I think she crossed a line to find Walker.

366
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,620
- Rory.
- What? What line?

367
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,040
Stay here.

368
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:17,420
Where's the buy happening?

369
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:20,173
- Where's the buy happening?
- Hey, hey! John! That is enough!

370
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,343
That's enough!
I thought we were doing this my way.

371
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,972
Your way wasn't fast enough, Oliver.
I'm not letting Walker get away!

372
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:30,600
- Neither am I.
- What's happening?

373
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,604
- What happened?
- John got a little carried away.

374
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:36,940
Did he say anything?

375
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,901
No.

376
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:44,447
You get yourself cleaned up. I'll be back.

377
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:47,242
- Where you going?
- I'm going to handle this.

378
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,085
- What do you need me to do?
- That did not take long.

379
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:59,087
Anatoly, what do you want?

380
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:08,429
To our imperfect union. Vashe zdorovie.

381
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,390
Vashe zdorovie.

382
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:19,274
Thanks.

383
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,401
For coming as backup,
or for not telling anyone?

384
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:22,610
Both.

385
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:52,419
This isn't the first time
you've done something like this.

386
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:54,767
Is it?

387
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:58,563
- I don't mean as the Green Arrow...
- You mean as a thug, right?

388
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,025
No.

389
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:06,291
It's a part of my life that
I thought that I had moved past, but...

390
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,531
Here we are.

391
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:10,575
Right.

392
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:14,722
You know, the other guys said
when you get in one of your moods,

393
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:17,874
I should just let you be,
but, to be honest, brooding

394
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,251
really kinda gets on my nerves.

395
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,546
They told you about me.
They tell you about Prometheus?

396
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:24,964
Yeah, they did.

397
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,591
What... Why? Is this mood

398
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:28,885
because you got pulled back
into some Bratva drama?

399
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:30,053
No, it...

400
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:33,748
That I'm trying to move forward...

401
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:39,896
But I'm back here, I'm in Russia,
in the Bratva.

402
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:43,191
And it just proves to me
I can't seem to do that.

403
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:48,404
Prometheus got in your head.

404
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:51,324
What was it, some crap about
infecting the people closest to you?

405
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,826
Yeah, and tonight
I watched John torture a man.

406
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,914
And there is something
going on with Felicity. There's...

407
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:01,334
You affect the
people in your life, Oliver,

408
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,795
that's hardly a revelatory observation.

409
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:07,924
Yeah, in fact, I...
I think it's, uh... It's called living.

410
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:11,427
Prometheus has you so
fixated on what's wrong with you,

411
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:13,561
you've completely
stopped seeing what's right.

412
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:17,266
You know, John and Felicity,
they'll listen to you

413
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:22,689
because you have
more to offer than just this.

414
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:27,819
Your past is a part of you.

415
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:30,345
There is nothing you can do about that,
you can't change it.

416
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,408
Doesn't mean it has to be your anchor.

417
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,543
The other names in that book
are waiting for you, Oliver.

418
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:47,213
- They're waiting for you at home.
- I know.

419
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:49,477
Leaving the Bratva
is not going to be easy.

420
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:52,301
I swore an oath of allegiance.

421
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,916
Your father asked you to
take a different vow, did he not?

422
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:57,974
You told me he wanted you
to right his wrongs.

423
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:00,017
You cannot do that from here.

424
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:10,236
Can lcomein,
or is it still "no dogs allowed?"

425
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:13,740
You really got
a wise-ass mouth on you, don't you?

426
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,826
I'm not sure, but did you just say
my mouth looks like ass?

427
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,430
Look, I just came in here to tell you that

428
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:21,294
Susan Williams'
producer called to confirm that

429
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,374
10:00 a.m. tomorrow
still works for the interview.

430
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:24,876
When did you become my assistant?

431
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:28,337
When I answered the phone, I guess.

432
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,317
It was out of line
bringing up my daughter.

433
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,844
You gonna tell that to Susan Williams
at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow?

434
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:37,764
Look, man,
you expecting me to give you an apology,

435
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,170
- you don't know me that well.
- I don't know you at all.

436
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:44,520
But my sponsor says that
I'm the one that owes you the apology.

437
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:46,689
- It's cool, hoss.
- No, it's not cool.

438
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,693
My daughter, Laurel, is gone.

439
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,616
And I gotta figure out a way to live with
that which doesn't involve booze

440
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:00,788
or snapping at guys
that are just trying to help.

441
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,120
You know, 10:00 a.m.
will be here before you know it.

442
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:08,252
How about another dry run?

443
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:11,964
- Take a seat.
- Atta boy.

444
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,216
Quit calling me "hoss."

445
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:17,094
All right. You ready?

446
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:20,223
- Where are your questions?
- I got 'em right here.

447
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:24,352
Where were you?
Did you take Dinah somewhere?

448
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:26,103
Yes, but not like that.

449
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,481
Okay, what happens in Russia,
stays in Russia, remember?

450
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:31,210
- Where's Walker's man?
- Curtis and Rory are keeping eyes on him.

451
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:32,874
I think she means protecting him from me.

452
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:34,630
Oliver, I still think it's a mistake

453
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:36,715
not pushing the scumbag
for the location of the sale.

454
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,634
We don't have to,
we're gonna have it within the hour.

455
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:40,910
- What? How?
- Bratva.

456
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,997
Hey, Anatoly wasn't playing ball
unless you did the Bratva's dirty work...

457
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:46,499
Which is where you took Dinah.

458
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,061
Oliver, I thought you didn't
want anything to do with the Bratva.

459
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:51,271
I don't, but if it's a choice between
me crossing a line

460
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,881
and the two of you crossing one,
that is a very easy choice.

461
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:56,991
- What did you do?
- Doesn't matter.

462
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,471
Here's what does. I am who I am.

463
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,790
Now, I'm trying to work past that.

464
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,142
Maybe I do, maybe I don't, but I cannot,

465
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:08,729
I will not have the two of you
make the same mistakes.

466
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,374
Oliver, you're the one that taught us

467
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:13,442
that sometimes you have to
get in the muck to make things right.

468
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:16,779
Well, then Prometheus wins
because he'll be right.

469
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,575
I need the two of you to prove to him,
and quite frankly,

470
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,702
to prove to me that he's not.

471
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,205
I need the two of you
to be better than me.

472
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:31,419
Because you are.
That's why we work together.

473
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:35,840
Uh, there is a whole mess
of angry Russian dudes outside.

474
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,978
I have location for Walker,
and men to help in fight.

475
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,396
But we have to leave now.

476
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,525
Your strange friend's pronunciation
is horrible.

477
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:56,235
Yeah, I'll tutor him later.

478
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:10,958
Hey.

479
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:13,252
Pleasure doing business with you, Lev.

480
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:16,047
You sure you don't wanna
toast the transaction?

481
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,674
Ah, I'd love to,
but I got a plane to catch.

482
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:20,801
And there's someone I'm trying to avoid.

483
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,722
- American government?
- I wish it were just them.

484
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:38,069
Green Arrow, tango headed your way.
I love saying the word "tango."

485
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:39,278
So dol.

486
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:06,267
Okay, in the future,
you might not wanna do that

487
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:07,789
with a van carrying a nuclear bomb!

488
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:12,405
That was a neat trick.
Now what's your plan?

489
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,245
Stay down, you son of a bitch.

490
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,414
Who the hell are you?

491
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,291
You didn't expect to
see me here, did you, General?

492
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:38,087
And no one's gonna believe that I was.

493
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:41,334
But everyone's gonna know that you tried
to sell a nuclear bomb to terrorists.

494
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:45,511
You're assuming I actually meant to
sell a bomb to the Markovians, John.

495
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:52,810
Bomb's not here.

496
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:58,149
Walker's headed for the hangar.
Odds are that's where the nuke is.

497
00:30:58,315 --> 00:30:59,358
Felicity!

498
00:31:00,443 --> 00:31:01,527
Why the ruse?

499
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:03,654
Why sell a nuclear weapon once

500
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:07,158
when I can steal it back and
sell it to another rebel sucker?

501
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:11,078
Rory?

502
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:13,932
Curtis told me you needed some help.

503
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:15,475
He was probably worried
I'd do something stupid.

504
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,293
Those were his exact words, actually.

505
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,603
Okay, you need to get out of here.

506
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,022
I think he said those would be
your exact words.

507
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:21,189
The bomb is in countdown mode.

508
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,357
- What?
- It's wired with a failsafe.

509
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,067
We must have triggered it
when we entered the hangar.

510
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,760
- Can you disarm it?
- If I can't,

511
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:28,304
the yield of this thing
will spread over 50 miles.

512
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:32,725
Do it.

513
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:34,935
You know you want to.

514
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:37,521
Come on, John, you have to.

515
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:40,775
I got a lot of friends, John.

516
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,486
Lots of resources
with itchy trigger fingers.

517
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:48,324
And you, well, you got a wife and kid.

518
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:53,165
Terrific, Overwatch,
any luck locating the nuke?

519
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:55,164
Overwatch is off comms
and in the hangar.

520
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:57,833
I think she's trying to
disable the nuke herself.

521
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,419
- I'm on my way.
- No, no, no, no. No!

522
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:02,171
- What happened?
- Trapdoor code,

523
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:03,774
- I walked right into it.
- What does that mean?

524
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:07,051
Any attempt to disarm the nuke will
exponentially pace up the countdown clock.

525
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:08,636
Wait, what are you doing?

526
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:10,447
Hoping like hell I can
figure out how to fly a plane.

527
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:11,698
- What?
- I can't disarm the nuke,

528
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,762
but hopefully I can get it
to a less populated area.

529
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:15,768
Less populated? What, like Havenrock?

530
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:17,375
This isn't the time to revisit that.

531
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:19,271
No. No, no, this is exactly the time.

532
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,792
The rags survived Havenrock,
they can survive this, too.

533
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:24,026
I can use them to
contain the blast and the radiation!

534
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:27,530
- No, you don't know that!
- Well, I don't need to know, I have faith.

535
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,198
Okay, but it should be me. Not you.

536
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:31,367
I don't have time
to take these rags off, so...

537
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,537
Go! Just in case this, you know,
doesn't work.

538
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:36,497
Felicity, go!

539
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,918
Do it. Go on.

540
00:32:45,256 --> 00:32:48,884
No, General. No, you're gonna stand trial.

541
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,220
I'm gonna see that justice is done.

542
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:05,609
What's happening?

543
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:14,326
- Rory!
- Oh, my God!

544
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:19,206
- Well, he always gets the credit.
- Are you okay?

545
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:22,042
This means I get a promotion, right?

546
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,513
To Rory and his
amazing nuke-stopping rags,

547
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,880
which hopefully doesn't
give us all radiation poisoning.

548
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:44,148
- Wimps.
- Yeah, can't you hold your vodka?

549
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:46,525
Now you my favorite American.

550
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:48,652
Did you hear from Lyla?

551
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,697
Walker's being escorted
under military guard as we speak.

552
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:52,865
Congratulations.

553
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,901
First, I wondered why
I didn't shoot him like I did Andy,

554
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:03,999
then I remembered
what you said to me and Felicity.

555
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:05,461
Well, I'm just glad that it took.

556
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:07,523
But, you know, Oliver, you were wrong.

557
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:09,351
Me and Felicity, we're no better than you.

558
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:14,136
You, me, Felicity,
we make each other better.

559
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,931
- I'll drink to that.
- You're my brother, Oliver.

560
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:25,105
Oliver. It's good,
good being friends again.

561
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,691
I forgot how strong this is over here.

562
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:30,611
I make sure I bring some
when I come to Star City.

563
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:32,196
Yeah.

564
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:37,117
Ah, I hear you're mayor now.
Big promotion.

565
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,662
Now you Pakhan,
now you tell everyone what to do.

566
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,789
That's not how things work in America,
Anatoly.

567
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:43,791
Yeah, that's the way things work
everywhere.

568
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,585
I was hoping maybe you could repay me.

569
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:49,072
- I thought we were even.
- I thought you return to Bratva.

570
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:50,881
That was temporary.

571
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:54,677
That is thing about oaths, Oliver.

572
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:59,181
They are never temporary,
they are for life.

573
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:15,322
I need to speak with Anatoly.

574
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:18,659
Where have you been?

575
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:22,037
I need to speak with Anatoly.

576
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:24,498
Where is he?

577
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:41,348
Anatoly?

578
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,436
Oliver? Is that you?

579
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:46,895
Yeah.

580
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:50,441
What happened?

581
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:52,318
Gregor.

582
00:35:53,444 --> 00:35:55,738
I questioned his deal with Kovar.

583
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:57,656
He did this to me.

584
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:00,576
You were right about him.

585
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:04,747
His loyalty lies with Kovar.

586
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,918
But Gregor is Pakhan.
There is nothing we can do.

587
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:11,920
That's not true.

588
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,883
We can kill him.

589
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,766
You are my brother, Oliver.

590
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,854
Oleg said that you
needed to tell me something.

591
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:31,523
That can wait.

592
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:48,791
You know,
if visiting Star City's "sister city"

593
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,459
is what it took to get you to bed,

594
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:53,754
I would've bought you
a ticket to Russia months ago.

595
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:58,967
A friend of mine told me that

596
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,805
my past doesn't have to be my anchor.

597
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,976
And I think my past is what was

598
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:11,647
stopping me from
moving things forward with you.

599
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:19,321
Looking at all this, I can understand why.

600
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:24,618
What exactly happened
to you on that island, anyway?

601
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:27,329
Things that I'm not ready to talk about.

602
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,456
Not even this crazy tattoo?

603
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:32,560
I mean, how do you even get
something like this on a deserted island...

604
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:33,836
Hey, hey.

605
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,115
You're not ready to talk about it.

606
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,883
- Mmm-hmm.
- Right. Okay.

607
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,929
Do you mean, like, not now or not ever?

608
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,056
Not now.

609
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:49,351
Maybe someday?

610
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:52,354
Yeah.

611
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:54,356
I can wait for someday.

612
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:23,218
Hey, what'd that bag ever do to you, huh?

613
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:25,345
- You got a minute?
- Sure.

614
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,390
How'd the interview go with
Oliver's girlfriend?

615
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:29,600
Cakewalk.

616
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:33,645
In fact, I asked her if she
went easy on me and she said she did.

617
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,129
'Cause of something you said to her.

618
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,736
I didn't say much.

619
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,990
I just told her a story about you and me.

620
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:48,076
- You and me?
- I figured you didn't remember.

621
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:51,997
When I was a kid,
you were a beat cop on my block.

622
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:54,249
You caught me tagging a building,

623
00:38:57,002 --> 00:39:00,881
but instead of hauling me in,
you crouched down,

624
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:03,509
looked me in the eye and told me...

625
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:07,596
I could be more than just
some rip-run thug.

626
00:39:09,723 --> 00:39:13,435
It really set me on a better path.
You did, I mean.

627
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:17,105
I had no idea, Rene.

628
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,917
Anyway, I just wanted the reporter to know

629
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:20,741
just what kinda guy
she was sitting down with.

630
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,660
Didn't you still get dishonorably
discharged from the military, though?

631
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,036
Nobody's perfect.

632
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:47,970
Hey.

633
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:51,473
Hey. What're you doing here?

634
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:54,309
Well, I'm just making sure
you're not radioactive.

635
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,939
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yeah, I'm sorry. I was...

636
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:00,440
I was gonna call.

637
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:04,528
Well, I was probably gonna
wimp out and text.

638
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:05,696
What's going on?

639
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:15,122
The blast did something to them.
They don't work anymore.

640
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:19,835
I don't have any control.
They don't offer any protection.

641
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,216
- Well, I'm sure it's just temporary.
- I'm not.

642
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:26,216
I have a bond with them, Felicity,
I can feel it.

643
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,595
And let's be honest,
without the rags, I'm a liability.

644
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,681
And one the team can't risk,
not with Prometheus out there.

645
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:34,933
Okay, well, that doesn't
mean you have to leave.

646
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,394
Don't worry. I'll be back.

647
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,105
You'll, uh...

648
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,191
You'll let the team know?

649
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:48,030
Yeah. I mean,
I'll probably just wimp out and text.

650
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,555
- Well?
- You were right.

651
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:18,477
All the guys in this photo are Bratva.
Means "brotherhood" in Russian.

652
00:41:18,644 --> 00:41:19,645
I know.

653
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,773
Bratva get tattoos on their chests
when they make captain.

654
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,066
What about the other thing?

655
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,568
Nah, I couldn't find
anything else on Queen in Russia.

656
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:29,154
But I reviewed criminal activity

657
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:32,041
from the period he was there,
and I found something very interesting.

658
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:36,411
The Russians call him Luchnik,
the Archer.

659
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:38,413
Does he remind you of anyone you know?

660
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,873
The Green Arrow.

661
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,585
Now, what are the odds of Oliver Queen

662
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:46,296
and the Green Arrow
being in Russia at the same time?

663
00:41:48,674 --> 00:41:49,883
Very good...

664
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:52,928
If Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow.

665
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,131
English - SDH
