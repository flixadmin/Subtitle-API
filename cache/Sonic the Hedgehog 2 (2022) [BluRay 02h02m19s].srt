1
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,569
Doctor's log.

2
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,155
It's day 243 in this

3
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,033
portobello purgatory.

4
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,244
My only companion is a rock I named Stone.

5
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:06,168
The question is,
for whom am I narrating this?

6
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,757
It seems I've become a featured player
in the theater of the absurd.

7
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,135
Marooned in deep space
by that wretched blue rodent.

8
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:19,598
But it's all good, thanks to a breathable
atmosphere and my supreme intellect,

9
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,934
sharpened against the only competitor
savvy enough to bring it.

10
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,519
Chanterelle to d4.

11
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:28,774
I've been striving to make fungi
into a functional drink of choice...

12
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,317
Mushroom coffee.

13
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,446
with limited

14
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,990
limited

15
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,202
limited

16
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,245
success.

17
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,502
But today, day 243,

18
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,838
has brought a new optimism
to my most pressing endeavor

19
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:56,635
planetus exodus to returnicus
and kick blue butticus.

20
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,394
If my calculations are correct,

21
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:08,021
and there's no reason to say "if"
because they always are

22
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:13,318
this quill is going to power
my masterpiece.

23
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,988
Let's light this candle,

24
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,367
and see who comes a-knockin'.

25
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,310
Greetings!

26
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,109
Klaatu barada nikto.

27
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,789
Agent Stone? Now!

28
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,008
Thank you, Stone.

29
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:06,681
It's time to say goodbye
to this piece-of-shiitake planet!

30
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,625
Where did you get that?

31
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,131
From a little blue menace
on the planet called Earth.

32
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,928
I'd be happy to show you the way.

33
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,881
They're still on us.

34
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,091
This'll slow 'em down.

35
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,786
Watch out. Excuse me.
Pardon me. Coming through.

36
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,457
Good evening, gentlemen. Mind if I drive?

37
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,336
Better buckle up.

38
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,845
How we doing back there?

39
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,139
And now this way.

40
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,984
I'm sorry. I don't speak duct tape.

41
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,071
- What the heck are you?
- Fear not, citizen.

42
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:30,158
I am the hero you need
and the hero you deserve.

43
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,702
The blue dawn that banishes the darkest...

44
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,954
Holy crap!

45
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,710
Don't worry. Nobody's gonna get hurt.

46
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,467
- What are those?
- Bombs. Bombs.

47
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,052
They're bombs! Those are bombs!

48
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,304
Relax. They're not even lit.

49
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,224
So I'll say again, nobody's gonna get

50
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,811
I was wrong! We're all gonna die!

51
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,773
Why aren't you slowing down?

52
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,608
That would require brakes.

53
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,363
It's hot. Hot, hot, hot!

54
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,156
Why don't you just let
the police handle this?

55
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,201
Because that's not what heroes do.

56
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:19,165
Thank you very much.
Please hold your applause.

57
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,922
Do you hear that? There's one bomb left.

58
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,386
- Did you check under the seat?
- Of course I checked under the seat!

59
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,973
You are terrible at this!

60
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,976
You know what? Your negative attitude
is not helping anyone.

61
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,020
It's in your spiky things!

62
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,690
I can never find anything in here.

63
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,652
Drained it from downtown!

64
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,322
See? I told you nobody would get hurt.

65
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,702
Holy sherbet!

66
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,955
Hello.

67
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,750
Don't panic. This is only a drill.

68
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,879
- Come here!
- No need to thank me, citizens.

69
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,340
All in a night's work for...

70
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,884
Blue Justice!

71
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,386
You're a terrible hero!

72
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,526
- Morning, Wade!
- Morning, Sonic!

73
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,994
Good morning, Green Hills!

74
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,056
Come on.

75
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,122
Sonic.

76
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,874
I miss you, Longclaw.

77
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,543
I'm trying to make you proud.

78
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,639
And now for a little shut-eye.

79
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,520
Ozzy, morning breath!

80
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,522
Sonic. Are you still in bed?

81
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,983
You're supposed to meet Tom, remember?

82
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,405
All right, all right, I'm up! I'm up.

83
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,116
What a day.

84
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,329
Thanks for coming out, bud.

85
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,499
I feel like you and me,
we haven't had much time together lately.

86
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,213
How's it going over there?
You getting any bites?

87
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,680
I can't swim! Help!

88
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,432
If I die, don't look in my closet!

89
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,727
Hey, hey, you're good.
You're all right. Come on.

90
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,939
- It's freezing.
- All right, okay. Take it easy.

91
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,734
You're good. Okay.

92
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,449
But now that you've had a nap and a bath

93
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:25,578
I went up to your room last night
to bring you some new comics and...

94
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,542
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop right there.

95
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:32,919
I wouldn't come any closer,

96
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,005
because this little hedgehog
had way too many chili dogs.

97
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,215
No. No.

98
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,218
I'm so embarrassed. Get out of here quick!

99
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,761
No, here comes another one!

100
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,681
Go. Now. Save yourself.

101
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop right there.

102
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,475
I wouldn't come any closer,

103
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,603
because this little hedgehog
had way too many chili dogs.

104
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,813
No. No.

105
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,357
I'm so embarrassed. Get out of here

106
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,609
I knew I should've used real farts.

107
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,364
- How many times are we gonna do this?
- What?

108
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,992
Cast your line and not catch anything?
Seems like a billion.

109
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,910
I think you know what I'm talking about.

110
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,997
The lying. The sneaking out.

111
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,373
The pretending to be Batman.

112
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,334
- Blue Justice, trademark pending.
- Whatever. You're being reckless.

113
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,628
Not this conversation again.

114
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,505
Hey. It's no fun for me, either.

115
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,300
But if you keep being irresponsible,
we're gonna keep having this conversation.

116
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,427
How is it irresponsible to use my powers?

117
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,555
Sonic, you destroyed an entire city block!

118
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,558
That block was already messed up.
Who cares?

119
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,186
Look, I stopped a robbery. I was a hero.

120
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,189
No, you put people in danger
and that's not what a hero does.

121
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,236
You're supposed to be my friend.

122
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,155
Stop trying to be my dad.

123
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,078
I can take care of myself.

124
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:53,750
Sonic, taking care of yourself
is not what being a hero's all about.

125
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,918
It's about taking responsibility
for other people.

126
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,340
And right now, whether you want to hear
this or not, you are still just a kid.

127
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,761
You got some more growing up to do
before you're ready to be the big hero.

128
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,180
But trust me when I tell you,

129
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,724
there will come a time
when your powers will be needed.

130
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,561
But you don't choose that moment.

131
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,314
That moment chooses you.

132
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,317
Look at you.

133
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,694
Look at that. I just got goose bumps.

134
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,988
Wait a second.
Did you steal that from Oprah?

135
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,449
No, sir.
That is a Wachowski family special.

136
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,037
Came from my dad,
in this very boat, on this very lake.

137
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,957
He would always try and steer me
in the right direction.

138
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,835
And that's what Maddie and I
have always tried to do with you.

139
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:42,131
So, until your moment arrives,

140
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,760
I want you to work on
being a little more responsible.

141
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,304
Comprende?

142
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,348
Comprende.

143
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,433
High five on it.

144
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,646
Yeah! Donut Lord and the Blue Blur
are back at it again!

145
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,897
Hang on.

146
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,565
Speedboat!

147
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,821
Sonic!

148
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,785
How excited are you,
going to Hawaii with me?

149
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,036
Yeah!

150
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,914
Wow.

151
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,835
Welcome to Sonic Air,
the fastest way to travel.

152
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,294
Now boarding groups one and two.

153
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,383
Sonic, this is so fun!

154
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,718
I'm sorry, ma'am, you're group three.
Please wait your turn.

155
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:31,305
- Anyone from groups one and two? Nobody?
- Just let him get it out of his system.

156
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,558
Okay, then everybody else right this way.

157
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,309
Thank you.

158
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,357
And you, sir?

159
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,527
Terrible shirt detected.

160
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,611
There we go.

161
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:49,157
Okay, you're free to go. Enjoy your trip.
Bye-bye now.

162
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:50,992
Okay.

163
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:52,910
Bring it in.

164
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:56,164
Tom, I'm about to be
hedgehog of the house for the first time.

165
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,583
I think I'm a little mature
to hug you goodbye.

166
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,585
Okay, what about a power bump?

167
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,962
- Power bump?
- Yes, power bump.

168
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,714
That's more like it.

169
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,007
- Wachowski!
- Wachowski!

170
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,593
Okay, use this one to get back home.

171
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,139
All right, we're off. Be good.

172
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,099
Yes. You have our number.

173
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,935
Sorry! Can't hear you! You're traveling
through a cross-dimensional portal!

174
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,437
- Miss you already!
- Okay?

175
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,105
Have fun at Rachel's wedding!

176
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,026
Okay, it's 48 hours until they come back.

177
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:29,071
We've got TV channels, streaming channels,
a house full of food and no supervision.

178
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,574
Let's do this.

179
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,290
If these readings are accurate, he's here.

180
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:03,499
I found him!

181
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,710
I just hope I'm not too late.

182
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,187
He's close.

183
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,607
I just need a way to reach him
without being spotted.

184
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,445
Standard human transport. Perfect.

185
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,000
Boy.

186
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,632
Aloha!

187
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,800
- How's it going, bud?
- You know.

188
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,970
Just a quiet night at home,
settling in with a good book.

189
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,931
- And you? What's up with you?
- I was just calling to say we're here.

190
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,434
But now every word out of your mouth
is making me suspicious.

191
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,560
What?

192
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:08,773
You got to relax, buddy.
You're at the Four Seasons Oahu.

193
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,275
Have a mai tai.
Enjoy some time with your wife.

194
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,194
Get sunburned somewhere embarrassing.

195
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,696
This weekend is about you.

196
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,366
You know what? You're right.
We power-bumped on it.

197
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:19,867
So whatever it is you're doing,

198
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,453
I'm sure you can undo it
by the time we get home, yeah?

199
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:27,166
Exactly! I mean, I am deeply offended
by such accusations!

200
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,959
So, how's Rachel's fiancé?

201
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:32,129
Is he as good-looking in person
as he is in pictures?

202
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,591
Somehow better-looking.

203
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,552
Wow! You're about to be
the third best-looking dude in the family.

204
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,471
But, hey, still on the podium.

205
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,100
All right,
I better go and introduce myself.

206
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,143
Stay out of trouble.

207
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:50,690
Trouble? Don't worry.
Everything here is completely normal.

208
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,233
Night, bud.

209
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,111
Hey! I was just coming over to say hi.

210
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,947
You've got a lot of nerve coming up
in here after what you did to my fiancée.

211
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,075
- Wait. What?
- Totaling her car?

212
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,328
Leaving her tied to a chair?
I should rip you limb from limb.

213
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,251
My God, look at your face!

214
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,253
Tommy, breathe, baby. Breathe.
I was kidding.

215
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,255
- Hey, man, I was totally kidding.
- Okay.

216
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,842
- You were kidding.
- Yeah.

217
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,761
I'm sorry. Rachel put me up to it.
It was totally her idea.

218
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,638
That rascal.

219
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,851
Listen, I don't know if you're aware.
Rachel does not care for you at all.

220
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:28,936
I'm aware. Yeah.

221
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,689
Seriously, bro, you got work to do.

222
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,232
- Hey!
- Hey.

223
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,609
Good to see you! Thanks for coming, Tom.

224
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,737
- Really glad you came.
- Really?

225
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,741
Great to see you, too. Congratulations.

226
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,285
I mean, you guys seem
really happy together.

227
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,953
You know, you're all right,
Thomas Wachowski.

228
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,249
- Can we bury the hatchet?
- I'd love that.

229
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,834
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

230
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,378
- All right, bring it in!
- All right! Great.

231
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,757
And if you screw up my wedding,
I will end you.

232
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,722
All right, Ozzy,
it's movie night at Casa de Sonic,

233
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,056
and it's your turn to pick.

234
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,684
But I am not watching Snow Dogs again.

235
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,437
That movie is the worst!

236
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,649
Blackout!

237
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,195
Ozzy.

238
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,447
Sorry, buddy. Everything's okay.

239
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,624
Excuse me. We did not order a poltergeist.

240
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:45,471
If this is the pizza guy,
this is really unprofessional.

241
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,615
Eggman?

242
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:11,038
Hello, hedgehog.

243
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,624
Did you miss me?

244
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,338
I don't know how you got back,
but you made a big mistake coming here.

245
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,258
Au contraire, mon frère.

246
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,302
The mistake was thinking you'd won.

247
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,847
But that was just a prelude,
an hors d'oeuvre,

248
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,099
an aperitif, an amuse-bouche.

249
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,475
I get it.

250
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,603
I don't think you do.

251
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,605
But you're about to.

252
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,233
And so will that idiot sheriff
and his wife.

253
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,362
And your little dog too!

254
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,716
Pitiful.

255
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,427
What? Who are you?

256
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,598
Where are my manners?

257
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:14,685
Sonic, meet Knuckles.

258
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,979
My new BFFAE.

259
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,441
Bestest friend forever and ever!

260
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,652
Look, Robotnik, I don't care
who you brought to help you.

261
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,571
You're never going to get my power.

262
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,240
Do I look like I need your power?

263
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:43,005
So nice when diabolical evil
lives up to the hype.

264
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,343
Where is it?

265
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,471
You want it? Here it comes.

266
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:55,184
I was expecting more of you.
You're unskilled.

267
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,311
Untrained.

268
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,190
And unworthy!

269
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:06,195
You forgot one. Unstoppable.

270
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,975
It is my destiny
to do what my ancestors could not...

271
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:40,229
To restore the ultimate power
to the home of my people.

272
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,775
Ultimate power?
I don't know what you're talking about.

273
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,068
You've got the wrong guy.

274
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,320
Ultimate power?

275
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,615
Now you're speaking my language.

276
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:54,868
Don't play dumb with me,
apprentice of Longclaw.

277
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,412
You knew Longclaw?

278
00:24:56,495 --> 00:25:00,624
Longclaw and her people were
the sworn enemy of my tribe, the Echidna.

279
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:05,713
We fought and died at their hands,
and now you will die at mine.

280
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,559
Come on. Get in! I'm on your side.

281
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,561
I'm sorry. Who are you?

282
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,522
You know what? It doesn't matter.

283
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,110
Get us out of here! Go, go, go!

284
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,323
He's gone rabid!

285
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:36,994
Gross! Is he licking it?

286
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,496
See ya!

287
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,874
Make sure to get your shots, Eggman!

288
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:59,433
Wow. Okay. Let me just say
it is an honor to finally meet you, Sonic.

289
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,060
Is it okay if I call you Sonic?

290
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,896
Everyone calls me Tails.
You're probably wondering why.

291
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,356
Let me guess. Because of the extra tail?

292
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,358
That's right!
I should've known you'd get that.

293
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:12,154
Cool. Also, what is going on?
Robotnik's back?

294
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,698
And who is
Clifford the Big Red Rage Monster?

295
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,326
That's Knuckles, the last of the Echidnas

296
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,828
and the most dangerous warrior
in the galaxy.

297
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,997
He's obsessed with finding
the Master Emerald.

298
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,416
Are you serious? The Master Emerald?

299
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,126
That's just a bedtime story.

300
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,628
Well, he believes it's real.

301
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,005
And he must think
you're the key to finding it.

302
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,051
Red light! Give me the wheel!

303
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,969
- Hey, what are you...
- Move your foot.

304
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,020
I think we lost him.

305
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,531
We did not lose him.
We definitely did not lose him!

306
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,955
I've got an idea. Do you trust me?

307
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,249
Of course not! I literally just met you!

308
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,417
- Just let me... Come on!
- What are you doing?

309
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:27,646
We're flying.

310
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,440
Did your butt just turn into a helicopter?

311
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,443
A butt-copter!

312
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,364
Only Sonic the Hedgehog
could come up with something like that.

313
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,631
Foxy move.

314
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:57,926
You want something done right

315
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:02,222
you have to hire someone
you can push around.

316
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,267
All caps.

317
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:24,912
Doctor,

318
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:26,955
where are you?

319
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:34,796
Freak.

320
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,349
I'm sorry, folks.

321
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,809
I have to close early. Everybody out!

322
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,979
Everybody out.
Thank you for visiting the Mean Bean.

323
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,106
All right, good night. Good night.

324
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,335
He's back.

325
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,047
He's back!

326
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,021
That's more like it.

327
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:17,858
I've been re-hatched!

328
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:33,957
So, my massively metacarpaled friend,

329
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,375
you mentioned

330
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,254
ultimate power.

331
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:40,339
Back at the house?

332
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:42,049
The Master Emerald?

333
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,508
It does not concern you.

334
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:46,595
I got you off that planet
and you brought me to the hedgehog.

335
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,764
We have no more use for each other.

336
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,183
Well, I hate to be a contrarian, but

337
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,226
I think we might.

338
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:57,189
You think these machines
are a match for me?

339
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,734
I will shatter them
like the bones from a fallen...

340
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,736
They are stairs.

341
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:12,621
You see, Earth is my turf, G.

342
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,874
If you don't know how to floss,
you'll be lost without me.

343
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,502
I understand nothing
of what you just said.

344
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:22,964
I help you retrieve the Emerald,
and you use it to

345
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:29,388
destroy the hedgehog!

346
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,681
You're suggesting an alliance.

347
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:35,894
Around here we simply
grip each other's hands tightly.

348
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:44,903
You truculent space bumpkin!

349
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,155
You've crushed my favorite hand!

350
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,741
Really? My hand is uninjured.

351
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:53,203
But I'm now convinced of your commitment.

352
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,205
"goody,"

353
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:58,792
he exclaimed,
while he reset two of his knuckles.

354
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,211
I'm

355
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:06,216
delighted to be on the same team.

356
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,434
Road trip!

357
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,061
I'll let you stick your nose
out the window.

358
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,023
Sonic, where are we?

359
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:24,484
Welcome to the Wade Cave.

360
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:27,612
Which is something
I hope to someday say to a woman.

361
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,364
A woman who's not my mom.

362
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,408
Wade, focus.

363
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:35,203
We need to figure out why Knuckles thinks
I'm the key to finding the Master Emerald.

364
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,205
And why did he mention Longclaw?

365
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,041
There must be a connection.

366
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,043
Wait a minute. There is.

367
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:46,506
Look. There's an emerald symbol
on the map Longclaw gave me.

368
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,467
I never knew what it meant before.

369
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:50,844
Something's happening.

370
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,358
Longclaw?

371
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:06,985
Hello, Sonic.

372
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,447
If you're watching this,
then something has happened to me.

373
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,366
And I pray
you've made it to Earth unharmed.

374
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:18,163
This world has been chosen
for a very important reason.

375
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,875
It's the secret location
of the Master Emerald.

376
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,631
The Emerald has the power
to turn thoughts into reality.

377
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,634
Like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man
from Ghostbusters.

378
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:35,472
In the wrong hands it could threaten
all life in the universe.

379
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,475
Protecting the Emerald was my sacred duty.

380
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,229
And now I must pass
that responsibility to you.

381
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,024
This is my moment.

382
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:49,569
Follow the map, find the Emerald,
and keep it safe.

383
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,738
My dear Sonic,

384
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:54,783
you have a heart
like no creature I've ever known.

385
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,077
I love you so much.

386
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,955
Goodbye.

387
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:03,124
No, no, wait.

388
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,133
I won't let you down, Longclaw.

389
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:17,222
So is that your dad?

390
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,765
What?

391
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:19,724
No?

392
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,436
According to this map,
the first clue is in Siberia.

393
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,814
It's a compass
that will lead to the Emerald.

394
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,817
And with Knuckles already here,
it's a race.

395
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,901
Knuckles?

396
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,445
I knew a kid in middle school
named Knuckles.

397
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,364
Could fit his whole fist in his mouth.

398
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:38,577
If this is the same Knuckles,
we are screwed.

399
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,079
This Knuckles, that Knuckles.
It doesn't matter.

400
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,831
We're gonna get there first.

401
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,586
What do you mean, "we"?

402
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:48,962
You're coming with me.

403
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,380
No, no, no.

404
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:53,675
I just came here to warn you.
I'm not a field guy.

405
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:57,554
Don't worry. I got your back.
I won't let anything happen to you.

406
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:02,767
It's a power bump.
On Earth, it means an unbreakable promise.

407
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:05,562
Okay, I'm in.

408
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,663
Doctor. It's really you.

409
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,124
You look different.

410
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,419
Papa's got a brand new 'stache.

411
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:36,176
I knew it. I knew it!
I knew you'd come back, sir.

412
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,678
I never stopped steaming
your Austrian goat's milk.

413
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:45,935
Could use some mushroom.

414
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,980
You brought something.

415
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,525
Some kind of space porcupine.

416
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:56,029
Porcupine? I am an Echidna!

417
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,698
Trained since birth
in all forms of lethal combat,

418
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,992
destined to restore honor to my tribe,

419
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:04,871
and willing to destroy
anything that gets in my way.

420
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:06,873
Welcome to the team.

421
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,006
That means he trusts you, Stone.

422
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:18,343
Now let's renovate this dump!

423
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,346
Latte with steamed Austrian goat milk!

424
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:42,909
Good one. Solid.

425
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,459
- Sorry, fellas.
- That's game!

426
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,212
That's how we do!

427
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,173
- But are they good at math?
- Teamwork makes the dream work!

428
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,134
Sorry about that, Big Tom.

429
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,803
- Are you good?
- All good. Fine.

430
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,931
Thanks for inviting me out to hang
with you and your groomsmen.

431
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,516
Good quality bonding.

432
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,309
You know, bro,

433
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,895
those guys right there,
they're way more than my groomsmen.

434
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,105
That's my squad.

435
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,232
Never would've made it through life
without 'em.

436
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,358
Get over here!

437
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,152
Yeah, I'm coming!

438
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:20,447
- I'll catch you later.
- Hey. Yeah!

439
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,824
Let me know if you're ready
for some power yoga.

440
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,952
- You bet.
- Come on, Tommy boy. Let's go.

441
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,078
Don't make me.

442
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,247
What am I doing?

443
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,623
Hey, Uncle Tommy!

444
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:32,208
Hey, girls!

445
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:35,128
How you do... Are those the wedding rings?

446
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:36,713
May I?

447
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:40,258
This little ring bearer
has been taking her job very seriously.

448
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,677
- She's been practicing all morning.
- I can see that.

449
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,138
How very responsible of you.

450
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,890
Except aren't there supposed
to be two wedding rings?

451
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:53,313
- Uncle Tommy?
- Hang on. What's going on here?

452
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:56,941
You're gonna do great, kiddo.

453
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,067
Bye.

454
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,527
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

455
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,657
That's right! Groom in the building!

456
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,201
Look at those guys.

457
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,203
I wish Sonic had that.

458
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:10,955
- Muscles?
- Control yourself.

459
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,668
No. Buddies. Wingmen. A squad.

460
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:19,255
Sonic doesn't have anything like that.
He's flying solo.

461
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,091
Baby, you got to relax.

462
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,385
You're at the Four Seasons.

463
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:27,388
Have a mai tai.
Spend some time with your wife.

464
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,558
That's what he said.
Seriously, his exact words.

465
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:34,687
See? He's a smart kid. He'll find his way.

466
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,358
I absolutely cannot find my way.

467
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,778
We are completely, totally,
unequivocally lost.

468
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:44,697
Sonic, in this weather,

469
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:47,784
there's no way we're gonna get
any readings on this thing!

470
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,619
- Should we go back?
- No, no, no.

471
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,956
There's a light up ahead.
Maybe we can take shelter in there.

472
00:38:58,545 --> 00:38:59,629
Perfect.

473
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,882
Are you sure about this?
We don't know who's inside.

474
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:06,219
Don't worry.
On Earth, people are very welcoming,

475
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,681
and love taking complete strangers
into their homes.

476
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:40,795
Run.

477
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:45,008
Table for two, please!

478
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:49,345
What would you like to order?

479
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,139
Two beef stews, please.

480
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:59,772
- Where'd you get all these cool gadgets?
- I invented 'em.

481
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,774
That's kinda my thing.

482
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:04,319
In fact,
my inventions are how I discovered you.

483
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,488
Remember that night at the baseball field?

484
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:11,284
Your energy blast reached all the way
to my home planet.

485
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:15,997
I saw you save your whole village
from that crazy mustache guy.

486
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,292
Wait, so you've been watching me
this whole time?

487
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,960
Even in the shower?

488
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:22,962
That's a trick question.

489
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:25,256
Sonic the Hedgehog prefers bubble baths.

490
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,674
Man, you're good!

491
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:29,218
When I learned Knuckles was on your trail,

492
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:32,138
I knew I couldn't just sit back
and watch anymore.

493
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,681
I had to come warn you.

494
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,601
What? Hang on one sec.

495
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,269
Donut Lord is checking in.

496
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:43,900
"Just chilling. Watching TV."

497
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,152
Dot, dot, dot.

498
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,988
Dot, dot, dot.

499
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,449
Dot, dot, dot.

500
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,326
Dot, dot, dot.

501
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,496
Dot, dot, dot.

502
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:57,997
Doctor,

503
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,334
why are we working with this imbecile?

504
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:07,256
Because that simpleminded space trash
is the key to something extraordinary.

505
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,718
Something to help you get revenge
on the hedgehog.

506
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,428
Think bigger, Stone.

507
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,307
The emerald he seeks
could power my wildest designs.

508
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,768
My genius wouldn't just be recognized
on Earth.

509
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,854
It would spread virally
to every corner of the galaxy,

510
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:25,191
allowing me to harness
all the negative forces of the universe

511
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,236
and commune with Darkness itself.

512
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,697
Wow. That sounds big.

513
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:34,534
It's been on my vision board for years.
It's the Law of Attraction.

514
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:35,952
Didn't you see The Secret?

515
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,330
Kaplooey!

516
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:40,456
Kaplooey.

517
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,751
"Another boring night at home."

518
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,837
The hedgehog has returned home!

519
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,382
Falsa. Which is Latin for "wrong-o."

520
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:54,303
According to my worldwide network
cell tower triangulation, he's lying,

521
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,180
all the way

522
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:01,144
from the majestic hinterlands
of Eastern Siberia.

523
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:05,148
He's a long-distance liar!

524
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,863
Yeah, there's more where that came from.

525
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,451
Tiny magic hedgehog destroyed.

526
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,871
Now let's begin our quest.

527
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:23,916
Wait.

528
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,461
What about your minion? The goat milker.

529
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,422
There's no room on the ship for Stone.

530
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,300
I say we ditch him,
ghost him, blow him off.

531
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,342
Dishonor!

532
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:37,346
"Dis" is how I roll.

533
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,441
I'm sorry, but I asked for the beef stew.

534
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,236
Your breath smells like goat poop.

535
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,739
What did you say?

536
00:42:58,493 --> 00:42:59,911
What's going on?

537
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:03,081
Maybe they think it's my birthday?

538
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,835
Don't worry, I'll take care of this.
Okay, everybody, take it easy.

539
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,962
I'm sure there's
a perfectly good explanation

540
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:12,465
for whatever my friend said or did.

541
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:14,258
Stand back.

542
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,885
I just farted.

543
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:22,183
Meow?

544
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,602
Throw these monsters in the fire!

545
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,567
No, no. Come on, guys.
Take it easy. Let's talk this through.

546
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,319
Let's talk this through!

547
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:37,240
Come on, come on.
Scanning Siberian customs.

548
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:41,077
- There's got to be something in here.
- Tails, whatever you're doing, do it fast.

549
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,203
I think I got it!

550
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,497
Pivonka! Pivonka!

551
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,707
Pivonka!

552
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,361
Da.

553
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,029
Pivonka!

554
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,950
Tails, what's a "pivonka"?

555
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,828
It's a Siberian custom
to resolve disputes.

556
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,581
If we win, they let us go. If we lose...

557
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:35,423
Okay, we have to grab the map
and get out of here. Where's the map?

558
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,176
No. I left it on the table! Look!

559
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,143
What?

560
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:13,002
My God, it's a dance fight.

561
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,631
Sonic, what do we do?

562
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,008
We dance and get that map.

563
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,969
Here we go.

564
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:26,641
Okay, now let's do... No, we're gonna go...

565
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:34,982
Okay.

566
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:47,995
Okay, this is not going well.
Channing Tatum makes it look so easy.

567
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,622
Wait, Sonic. Look!

568
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,337
The map! Come on, let's grab it!

569
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,425
You want?

570
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:03,844
Come get.

571
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,221
Freaks!

572
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:07,306
Freaks!

573
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,767
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

574
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,019
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

575
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,230
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

576
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,773
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

577
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,526
What's wrong, Tails? Come on. I need you!

578
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,529
I can't do this, Sonic.
I'm not brave like you.

579
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,282
My gadget got us in this mess,
and I lost your map,

580
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:26,409
and we're gonna get tossed into a fire!

581
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,082
New deejay coming in.

582
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,296
Come on, pal. I got an idea.

583
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:40,089
They called us freaks,

584
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,842
so let's get freaky.

585
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,177
Just follow my moves. You'll be fine.

586
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,042
All right! Backup dancers!

587
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:22,048
Here we go!

588
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:45,821
There's a lot of me up here!

589
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,204
I love pivonka!

590
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:59,877
And big dismount!

591
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,671
Yeah!

592
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:07,927
I'll take that.

593
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,683
We did it!

594
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:17,937
That was amazing! Way to go, Tails.

595
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:31,242
Wow. Only Sonic the Hedgehog
could win a dance battle that epic.

596
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,743
Well, stick with me, pal.

597
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:36,831
Earth can be a scary place, but I know
everything about this old pale blue dot.

598
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,624
Do you really mean that?

599
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:42,294
I mean, not everything. But I watch
a lot of Discovery Channel and

600
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:45,256
I meant about me being your pal.

601
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,300
Of course, buddy.

602
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:52,888
Comin' in hot.

603
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:56,183
Growing up, I didn't have any friends.

604
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:59,186
Everyone in my village
thought my two tails were weird.

605
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,021
Hey, I know that feeling.

606
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:05,151
But then I saw you,
the fastest creature in the galaxy.

607
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:09,113
You were weird too. But you were a legend.

608
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,908
That made me think,
maybe being weird isn't so bad.

609
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,412
You inspired me to leave my village,

610
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:19,457
to find you and help you in your mission.

611
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,834
I'm really glad you're here, Tails.

612
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,919
I'm glad I'm here too, Sonic.

613
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,720
Well, might as well get some sleep.

614
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,264
This feels like a good place
to spend the night.

615
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,099
You'll be able to get clear readings
on your gizmo thing

616
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:39,685
once the storm is over, so I...

617
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:52,781
Night, Tails.

618
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:09,840
Tails. Tails. We have a situation.

619
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,517
Today's forecast calls for
clear, sunny skies

620
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,520
and a 100% chance of adventure.

621
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:25,564
I pinpointed the coordinates.
It's right up ahead.

622
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,360
Wow.

623
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:40,996
Hey, Tails. Wait up.

624
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:50,798
Okay, we got a giant owl door.
Seems encouraging.

625
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:05,229
Check this out.

626
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:08,023
- Can you translate that?
- Yeah.

627
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:12,611
Ages ago, a fearsome group of warriors,

628
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:14,321
known as the Echidnas,

629
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,699
forged the Seven Chaos Emeralds

630
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:20,536
into the most unstoppable weapon
ever created.

631
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,457
The Master Emerald.

632
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,918
With it, a single warrior

633
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:30,504
could defeat entire armies.

634
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,426
Believing no one should have such power,

635
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:39,054
an order of heroes recovered the Emerald

636
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:41,890
and swore to protect it from evil.

637
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,768
Sounds like the Owls and the Echidnas

638
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:47,313
have been fighting each other
for centuries.

639
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:49,398
Like Vin Diesel and The Rock.

640
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,192
Wait for me.

641
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:02,953
Okay, giant owl door, giant owl.
Makes sense.

642
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,259
Wait a second.
I've seen these symbols before.

643
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:22,640
Here we go.

644
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,775
Well, that did something.

645
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:53,337
- The compass!
- This will lead us to the Emerald!

646
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,679
Hey, you got a little something on your...

647
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:04,390
No. Tails, get back.

648
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:10,062
Run!

649
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,278
That guy again?

650
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:22,157
Heads up, my little stalagmites.
Someone call an Uber?

651
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:25,619
Hey, thanks for doing all the hard stuff.

652
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:31,083
But we'll take it from here.

653
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,669
Okay, we really gotta talk
about your new look.

654
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:36,505
It's like Professor X
meets the Monopoly man.

655
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:40,008
And what kind of genius
shows up to Siberia in a convertible?

656
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:43,095
The kind of genius
that can turn up the heat

657
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:46,765
with a flick of a switch.

658
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:00,946
Good one! I'm sure that wasn't important.

659
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:05,659
Tails, that's our exit. Come on.

660
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,758
Let's split up.

661
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:23,343
- You go high, I go low.
- Right.

662
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,888
Quick little stretch and here we go.

663
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:38,942
So you want to play?

664
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:45,407
That's new.

665
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:57,920
Sonic!

666
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:12,810
Snowball fight!

667
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:22,027
It's too easy. Come on, challenge me!

668
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,253
We are talking style and pizzazz.

669
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:49,221
Yeah! I make this look good.

670
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:53,851
Great. The Winter Soldier.

671
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:03,652
For a guy named Knuckles,
you are really bad at punching.

672
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:07,030
Surrender the compass!
You are no match for me.

673
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:09,616
I've been training for this
my entire life.

674
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:13,203
And I had no training at all,
yet here I am ahead of you.

675
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,372
That's gotta be embarrassing.

676
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:22,754
My rings!

677
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:29,511
Has anyone ever told you
you've got serious anger issues?

678
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:32,139
You mock me with your weak jokes,

679
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,433
but you know nothing about me, hedgehog.

680
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:38,520
Well, I know you Echidnas have a habit of
showing up uninvited and ruining my life.

681
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:42,024
Ruining your life? Another bad joke.

682
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:44,943
I lost everything because of you.

683
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:48,322
My tribe was on the verge
of its greatest victory.

684
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:51,283
The last of the Owl warriors
had been located.

685
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:55,120
Soon Longclaw's Emerald secrets
would be ours.

686
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:58,415
But my father stopped me
from joining the fight.

687
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:02,044
He said my moment
to honor our tribe would come,

688
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:04,254
but it was not this moment.

689
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:06,965
Those were the last words he spoke to me.

690
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,384
I never saw him again.

691
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:13,472
We both lost everything that day.

692
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:17,434
- Goodbye, Sonic.
- No!

693
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,394
Longclaw!

694
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,567
Sonic! Are you okay?

695
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:26,818
Deceiver!

696
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,529
No, it wasn't a trick.

697
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,908
Tails, take the compass
and get out of here!

698
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,704
Yeah!

699
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:40,415
Later, haters!

700
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:44,878
Tails!

701
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,637
Tails, come on. Wake up.

702
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,390
He chose helping the fox
over pursuing the compass.

703
00:57:56,473 --> 00:58:00,644
Of course he did.
New friend, same pathetic weakness.

704
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:13,615
No. No, no, no.
We're in real trouble here.

705
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:16,702
Come on, Tails. I need you to fly us
out of here. Time to wake up.

706
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:27,504
See ya, kids. Enjoy the fresh powder.

707
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:54,114
Did you...

708
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:02,539
These rings signify the...

709
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,254
Sorry.

710
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,423
Thought it was on silent.

711
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:19,264
These rings...

712
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:22,726
So help me, Thomas!

713
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,024
Okay, sorry.

714
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:30,650
Excuse me, this is an emergency.

715
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,945
Sorry.

716
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:41,203
What? This better be important. I just...

717
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:43,080
Are you skiing?

718
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:45,415
Snowboarding, actually.
But I need your help now.

719
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:47,834
Life or death situation this very second.

720
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:50,837
I need you to use the ring I gave you
to save me. Like right now.

721
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:53,173
Okay, slow down.
I don't even know where you are.

722
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,467
You just gotta picture
where you want the ring to go.

723
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,676
So picture this.

724
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:02,015
My God. Okay, okay. Hang on.

725
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:11,483
What?

726
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:14,277
Did you throw it?

727
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,739
- God.
- What? Tell me what "God."

728
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:19,366
I mixed up the rings
when I was teasing Jojo.

729
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,867
What? Where is it then?

730
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:26,456
You don't want to know.

731
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:27,874
But I do, Tom.

732
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,292
I very much want to know,

733
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:31,837
before I become
a hedgehog-flavored snow cone.

734
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,005
Hang tight, buddy. I got this.

735
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:35,882
With this ring, Rachel...

736
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:37,717
Hey! Hi.

737
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:40,595
Everything okay, bud?

738
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,222
- Not really.
- What are you doing?

739
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:45,809
This is gonna sound crazy, but I need
to see that ring for just one second.

740
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:48,311
- Have you lost your mind?
- I'm gonna give it right back, I promise.

741
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:51,148
- Please, Randall, it's really important.
- No, bro. Go sit down.

742
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:54,192
- Give me the ring, please?
- Randall, don't look at him, look at me.

743
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:55,861
- One second.
- Put the ring on my finger.

744
01:00:55,944 --> 01:00:59,281
- No, Randall, listen to me.
- Randall! Look at me. Ring on my finger.

745
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,825
- Give me the ring! Just one second.
- Put a ring on it!

746
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:03,952
Please, love? Okay?

747
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:05,036
- With this ring...
- Yes, baby.

748
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,580
I'm so sorry about this.

749
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:19,176
- Snow, my God.
- Boy.

750
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:22,470
Incoming!

751
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,357
Anybody hurt?

752
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:36,484
- Sonic!
- Hawaii.

753
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:37,819
Are you okay?

754
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:39,779
What's happening? Are you hurt?

755
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:41,823
- No, no, I'm fine.
- Okay, good.

756
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:45,452
- Because you're in so much trouble!
- Okay, you calm down.

757
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,870
You talk.

758
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,371
Okay, quick version.

759
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:51,249
Robotnik is back on Earth
and he's after a magic emerald.

760
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:55,337
We need to get it back
or the world is doomed.

761
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:57,172
Tails!

762
01:01:57,255 --> 01:02:00,717
- Wait! All this happened since yesterday?
- Wait. Who's Tails?

763
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,052
Tails, can you hear me?

764
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:04,095
Lord, there are two of them now.

765
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:06,348
Okay, let me think. Tails, come on, buddy.

766
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:12,479
Hey!

767
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,731
Randall, why do all of your friends
have weapons?

768
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:20,070
You really should have taken me up
on that brunch, Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski.

769
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:21,905
Olive Garden guy?

770
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:24,532
It's okay, everyone. We're federal agents.

771
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:27,786
You, too, Agent. Go ahead.

772
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:38,380
You mean to tell me
that this entire wedding was a setup?

773
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:40,173
- Rachel, wait a minute.
- What?

774
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:41,341
That's correct, ma'am.

775
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:44,803
Every single aspect of Operation Catfish
was a complete fabrication.

776
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:47,389
Operation Catfish?

777
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,766
So is everyone here an agent?

778
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:52,394
Are you an agent?

779
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:54,396
Son of a...

780
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:58,233
Was the florist an agent?
How about the photographer?

781
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,360
The woman who waxed my

782
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:02,445
at the spa?

783
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,449
- Is Jojo an agent?
- Rachel.

784
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:09,119
- What?
- Rachel, listen to me.

785
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:12,289
I'm done listening! I am done listening!

786
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:15,834
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

787
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,502
I really am. I am so sorry.

788
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,131
No. Hey, no!

789
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:24,676
Let him go! Hey!

790
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:28,805
Sonic, hang on.

791
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:31,975
- Take it easy. It's not worth it.
- Tom!

792
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:35,478
Sonic is not a threat. He's on our side.

793
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:37,480
He's an uncontrolled extraterrestrial.

794
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:39,649
And your days of aiding
and abetting him are over.

795
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,444
Secure them in the hotel
until the chopper arrives.

796
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:44,446
You're making a mistake.

797
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,072
Hold on, Major A-hole!

798
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,325
This is still my day,

799
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:52,120
and someone is gonna explain to me
what the hell is going on here!

800
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:55,540
After the events in San Francisco,
a global task force was created,

801
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:58,835
devoted to protecting our planet
from alien threats.

802
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:01,588
That day,
Guardian Units of Nations was born.

803
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,257
- G-U-N. Seriously?
- GUN, yeah.

804
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:06,926
Look, what about protecting our planet
from Dr. Robotnik?

805
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,637
Robotnik is dead.

806
01:04:09,721 --> 01:04:11,806
You're wrong. He's back.

807
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:14,309
And you just hauled away the only ones
who could stop him.

808
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:19,064
Sounds like Robotnik
might be back in play.

809
01:04:19,147 --> 01:04:21,649
If he is, I want him found immediately.

810
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:25,153
And cancel my five o'clock
at the Olive Garden.

811
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:27,280
- Aunt Maddie?
- Yeah.

812
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:29,032
Sonic and his friend dropped this.

813
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,290
I have an idea.

814
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:39,542
And I want to have a word with my fiancé.

815
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:41,252
And that word is "murder."

816
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,760
Hey, come on.
You can't just leave us in here.

817
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:51,971
My friend is hurt!
He needs a doctor, a vet, anyone!

818
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:56,184
Tails, you got to wake up, buddy.
Please wake up.

819
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:05,652
All clear.

820
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,865
All right. Game plan.

821
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:13,910
I get inside the hotel and find
where they're hiding Tom and Sonic.

822
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,620
Then I find Randall, right?

823
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:17,122
And then I squeeze the breath

824
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:21,292
from his lying, deceitful,
perfectly manscaped body!

825
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:25,380
I'm going through a lot right now.

826
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:28,550
- So let me process this my own way, okay?
- Sure, sure.

827
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:30,844
- No judgment.
- Should've brought a journal.

828
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,303
Okay...

829
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:35,932
Okay. Is this meant to be a weapon?
This is adorable.

830
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,143
Take that, Randall!

831
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,270
Run, Randall!

832
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,771
All right.

833
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:43,773
- We're about to find out.
- All right!

834
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:45,650
Let's go kick some booty.

835
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:00,623
Rachel! No. Rachel!

836
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:03,001
In a minute.

837
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:09,674
Stop right there!

838
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:11,593
Get the bag.

839
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,352
He's gonna come back down, right?

840
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:22,896
I don't know.

841
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:23,980
Good luck!

842
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:28,485
Look. Tom and Sonic have to be inside.

843
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:30,987
I got a fiancé to vaporize.

844
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:32,572
- Watch your back, sis.
- Okay.

845
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:36,451
Randall!

846
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:46,127
We got her. Move in.

847
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:51,591
Okay.

848
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:09,150
I did not mean to do that!

849
01:07:21,913 --> 01:07:23,873
Something bothering you, Agent?

850
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:26,626
I just feel a little guilty
about what I did to Rachel, sir.

851
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:30,004
Don't worry about it.
We'll send her a gift card.

852
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:32,215
Now, I propose a toast.

853
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:38,221
To a perfectly executed operation.

854
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,561
Sir, we're under attack.

855
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:08,459
Randall, wifey's home!

856
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:14,757
My God. Rachel.

857
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:42,285
What a woman.

858
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:45,663
You no-good,

859
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:49,917
lowdown, dirty, lying

860
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:51,210
Rachel, just listen to me.

861
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:55,548
What kind of twisted sicko
tricks someone into a fake wedding?

862
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,178
Party's over, Bridezilla.
Stop right there.

863
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:03,640
You son of a...

864
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,266
- Have it your way.
- No!

865
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,602
No!

866
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:14,859
Very disappointing, Agent Handel.

867
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:21,199
- Is that supposed to be a weapon?
- I don't know, but we gonna find out.

868
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:23,701
Haven't you caused enough trouble
for one day?

869
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:26,079
I haven't even begun causing trouble.

870
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:29,874
Hell hath no fury like a bride scorned.

871
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:39,008
Looks like it's real?

872
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:44,597
No. Right.

873
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:49,102
Be honest. How bad is it?

874
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:52,313
Not bad at all.
You got Tased. You'll be fine.

875
01:09:56,901 --> 01:10:00,321
- I'm so cold.
- You landed on our ice sculpture.

876
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:01,489
Get up.

877
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:12,083
Just tell me the truth, for once.

878
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:17,422
Is there anything about you
or about us that was real?

879
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:21,551
Rachel, look at me.

880
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:26,514
Before I met you, I didn't think
that I was even capable of real happiness.

881
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:30,435
But that all changed
when you walked into my life.

882
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:34,313
And I ended up breaking the first rule
of undercover work.

883
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:36,399
Which is?

884
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,526
Never fall in love.

885
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:54,375
- Maddie!
- We're busting out of here.

886
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:55,668
How'd you get past the guards?

887
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:57,587
Because that little fox
is into some crazy stuff.

888
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:58,713
Come on.

889
01:11:00,298 --> 01:11:01,841
- Let's go.
- You're amazing.

890
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:15,313
The Owls were fools to think
they could hide this.

891
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:54,936
What's happening?

892
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,231
Wait for it.

893
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:12,036
Yes. Eureka!

894
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:14,956
I've found it!

895
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:35,560
Sonic.

896
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,272
- What is that?
- A big problem.

897
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:42,233
The compass led Robotnik to the Emerald.

898
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:44,318
That's got to be hundreds of miles away.

899
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:49,198
All right. Huddle up.
Let's figure out a plan.

900
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:51,325
- Together.
- There's no time for that.

901
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:53,369
I'm the only one
that can get there fast enough.

902
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:56,330
Sonic, this is way too big for you
to do by yourself.

903
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:58,416
You see that little fox over there?

904
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,003
He came all the way across the universe
to meet his hero.

905
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:05,006
And what did his hero do?
I practically got him killed.

906
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:07,842
You know what? You were right.

907
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:11,971
My moment came and I blew it. I'm no hero.

908
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,222
- Wait.
- No.

909
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:15,641
I'm not letting anyone else get hurt
because of me.

910
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:17,602
I'm gonna fix this while I still can.

911
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,730
Sonic!

912
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:22,231
Sonic, wait!

913
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,944
Hold on. Wait.

914
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:29,530
- Don't move.
- Take it easy, little guy. You're hurt.

915
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:33,284
But we have to help him.
You don't know what he's up against.

916
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:41,876
You believe us now?

917
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:50,092
Hey, Bob!

918
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:51,928
Hey, Maria, how you doing?

919
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:56,515
Working on my moves.

920
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:59,226
Just keepin' it green.
No need to burn the fuel.

921
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:00,311
Speaking of fuel...

922
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:08,110
Closed?

923
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:10,905
That doesn't seem right.

924
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:24,752
Close.

925
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:30,591
Yes.

926
01:14:30,675 --> 01:14:33,219
Makeover, makeover. Look at you.

927
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:34,637
Freeze! Police!

928
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:38,099
My God, you got robot hands.

929
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:41,560
- No, they're gloves.
- Get 'em up. Now spread your fingers!

930
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:45,523
Now wiggle 'em! Wiggle your digits!

931
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:49,652
Yes! Like you just finished
a big musical number.

932
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,030
Good.

933
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:54,532
Why is there a light on your head?

934
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:00,496
'Cause I'm the sheriff
for the weekend, pal.

935
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:10,589
Water.

936
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:12,550
Why did it have to be water?

937
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:18,305
Okay, you can do this.

938
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:23,519
I gotta go fast.

939
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:09,458
I don't want to die like this!
It's derivative!

940
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,670
Make room for Daddy!

941
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:21,804
Two and two.

942
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:25,141
Great! We're still bipedals, more or less.

943
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:29,979
Fire in the hole!

944
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:35,401
I've solved it. There is a booby trap
every seven seco...

945
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:43,450
That was a little early.

946
01:17:44,952 --> 01:17:48,539
So glad it didn't cut off my mustache.

947
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:51,041
Hey, Little Red Wrecking Ball.

948
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:54,211
I know you're dying
to get your Emerald on,

949
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:58,007
but can we be a little bit more mindful
of our surroundings?

950
01:17:58,507 --> 01:17:59,550
May I?

951
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:08,767
In 30 feet, turn left.

952
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:10,728
Work smarter, not harder.

953
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:33,542
My pelvis.

954
01:18:37,922 --> 01:18:42,051
Okay, Secret Temple,
let's see what you've got.

955
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:51,852
No, no, no! No!

956
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:57,566
No.

957
01:18:58,734 --> 01:18:59,735
Yes!

958
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:07,618
You have arrived at your destination.

959
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:10,704
Wow. That really opened up the space.

960
01:19:10,788 --> 01:19:13,749
I can't even picture it
with an impenetrable wall now.

961
01:19:13,832 --> 01:19:15,751
And the rubble is always a nice touch.

962
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:28,681
At last. The Master Emerald.

963
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:30,015
Ultimate power.

964
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:32,935
Soon order will be restored.

965
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:36,355
All because of what we have done together.

966
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,732
Such a lovely sentiment, Knuckles.

967
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:41,819
I think I feel a single tear forming.

968
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,031
Sadly

969
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:51,745
you're as useful to me now
as a backstage pass to Limp Bizkit.

970
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:07,594
Nailed it.

971
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:12,224
This guy is always trying to spoil
a bad thing!

972
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:16,061
You guys are here, too?
Took the long way?

973
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:18,314
Is everything a joke to you?

974
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:21,358
Why must you constantly interfere
with my destiny?

975
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:25,112
Because my destiny is to protect
my friends and family.

976
01:20:25,195 --> 01:20:27,364
I think I just threw up in my mouth.

977
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:33,370
And if you want that emerald,
you're gonna have to go through me.

978
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:58,687
The Echidna's taking no prisoners today!

979
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:02,524
Sonic has heart,
but will he lose the quill to live?

980
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,030
I don't want to fight you,
but you're not giving me much choice.

981
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:17,498
Too easy. Let's do this.

982
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:49,071
Why don't you stand still
and die with honor?

983
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:50,406
Let me think about it.

984
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:54,159
Okay, I thought about it and I pass.

985
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:05,087
Hi there, beautiful.

986
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:08,382
You're the real deal, aren't you?

987
01:22:09,091 --> 01:22:12,511
Where have you been all my life?

988
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:18,767
Say goodbye, hedgehog.

989
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:25,190
Knuckles, stop.
Robotnik's stealing the Emerald!

990
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:27,734
What kind of fool do you take me for?

991
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:29,069
Just look.

992
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:32,948
Mine.

993
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:36,910
Wait! That wasn't the deal.

994
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:43,000
You poor, naive creature.

995
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:44,501
It's not your fault.

996
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:48,213
A more advanced intellect would have seen
this move coming a mile away.

997
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:50,132
Or 1.6 kilometers.

998
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:53,385
But I trusted you! You were my friend!

999
01:23:00,517 --> 01:23:02,936
I'm sorry. That just hit me funny.

1000
01:23:03,854 --> 01:23:08,901
Let this be my final lesson to you,
you dim-witted celestial skin tag.

1001
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:11,236
Friends

1002
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:15,324
are open, honest
and vulnerable with each other.

1003
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,951
Which means X squared
times the hypotenuse of Y squared,

1004
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:20,871
divided by the absolute value
of friendship, equals

1005
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:22,414
dookie!

1006
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:23,749
No.

1007
01:23:31,882 --> 01:23:36,887
Chaos is power!

1008
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:56,949
Let's get out of here!

1009
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:10,671
Knuckles!

1010
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:18,011
Water again? Come on!

1011
01:25:16,737 --> 01:25:20,741
- You saved me.
- Don't talk to me. I'm not in the mood.

1012
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:26,163
How dare you attack me
in my hour of sorrow!

1013
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:28,498
Why did you save me?

1014
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:32,377
Because you saved me first,

1015
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:36,131
which clearly gave you
a tactical advantage I do not understand.

1016
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:39,843
It wasn't a tactic.
I couldn't just let you die.

1017
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:45,599
Why? I've been trying to destroy you
since the moment we met.

1018
01:25:45,682 --> 01:25:49,603
Because being a hero
isn't about taking care of yourself.

1019
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:53,106
It's about taking responsibility
for other people.

1020
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:58,654
Wise words. An ancient Earth proverb?

1021
01:25:58,737 --> 01:26:01,156
No, sir,
that's a Wachowski family special.

1022
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:03,241
I got it from a guy in a rowboat.

1023
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,494
Someone who means a lot to me.

1024
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:08,997
Wait a second. What's that sound?

1025
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:14,670
Only Sonic the Hedgehog
needs rescuing this much.

1026
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:17,714
That sly little fox!

1027
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:22,594
Come on, Knucklehead. We're not beat yet.

1028
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:25,931
On the mountain,
you told me you'd lost everything.

1029
01:26:26,556 --> 01:26:28,058
The way I did.

1030
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:30,894
But you seem so hopeful and free.

1031
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:35,482
How did you move forward
despite failing again?

1032
01:26:36,233 --> 01:26:39,361
And again. And again.
And again. And again.

1033
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:43,073
Okay, I didn't fail that much.
But I didn't do this all alone.

1034
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:45,742
I found a new family. New friends.

1035
01:26:45,826 --> 01:26:47,244
And you can too.

1036
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:51,957
You don't have to be alone anymore.

1037
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:59,214
Are you kidding me with that handshake?

1038
01:27:01,842 --> 01:27:03,260
I'm done playing games, pal.

1039
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:06,680
You're gonna tell me what I want to know.

1040
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:12,477
And I am asking you for the last time

1041
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:17,274
what would you like on your bagel?

1042
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:19,276
I'm not telling you anything.

1043
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:22,279
And that is a display bagel.

1044
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:25,574
I don't get it with you!
I mean, I've tried everything.

1045
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:29,286
I was good cop. I was bad cop.
I was cop who offers you a bagel.

1046
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:30,370
And nothing. It's like...

1047
01:27:30,454 --> 01:27:32,706
That is a display bagel. Wow.

1048
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:43,717
Doctor, you're here.

1049
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:50,390
Yes, I'm here, and yet I'm

1050
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:53,602
not all there.

1051
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:55,187
Sir, are you feeling okay?

1052
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:59,399
I'm more than okay.

1053
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:03,153
I'm upgraded.

1054
01:28:03,236 --> 01:28:06,281
Sinister 3.0.

1055
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:10,368
My game is next level.

1056
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:16,625
Hi.

1057
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:25,634
I can smell the electricity in your brain.

1058
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:29,763
You smell like a snack plate.

1059
01:28:31,181 --> 01:28:34,309
Yeah, that's fair. I had a couple today.

1060
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:36,311
Sit down.

1061
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:42,400
In the chair.

1062
01:28:45,612 --> 01:28:46,780
I didn't know.

1063
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:50,951
'Cause he was in the chair,
so I didn't... Okay.

1064
01:28:51,034 --> 01:28:52,953
Sir? We have a problem.

1065
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:01,419
- All teams in position!
- Set up a perimeter!

1066
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,463
Move! Move! Move!

1067
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:22,232
Incorrectus, my trusty barnacle.

1068
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:26,027
After all these years,

1069
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:28,405
what I finally got

1070
01:29:29,573 --> 01:29:31,616
is a solution.

1071
01:29:42,252 --> 01:29:44,129
- Commander.
- Status report.

1072
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:47,591
Robotnik is in there with Stone
and a hostage. Possibly local PD.

1073
01:29:47,674 --> 01:29:51,052
I'm not saying he's dumb,
but if he is local PD,

1074
01:29:51,136 --> 01:29:52,762
this town's in a lot of trouble.

1075
01:29:53,513 --> 01:29:54,806
Wade.

1076
01:30:09,195 --> 01:30:10,196
Okay.

1077
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:13,700
Rockin' that new spring collection, I see.

1078
01:30:13,783 --> 01:30:18,330
Well, if it isn't the Pastry King.

1079
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:19,539
The Donut Lord.

1080
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:21,833
A real genius would remember
the name of the guy

1081
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:23,835
who helped kick your butt off this planet.

1082
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:25,879
And I'll do it again if you mess
with Green Hills.

1083
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:30,759
Congratulations on your so-temporary
sense of superiority.

1084
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:33,178
You're finished, Robotnik!
We've taken everything.

1085
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:35,972
Your lab, your drones, your funding!

1086
01:30:36,056 --> 01:30:39,225
Let's see how big of a man you are
without your silly little robots.

1087
01:30:40,977 --> 01:30:42,896
Would you like to see

1088
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:46,483
how big a man I can be?

1089
01:30:57,369 --> 01:31:00,538
Welcome to the new norm.

1090
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,217
My God!

1091
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:19,432
Doctor! Take me with you!

1092
01:31:43,873 --> 01:31:45,709
He's taking everything apart.

1093
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:48,128
He's building something.

1094
01:31:56,136 --> 01:31:58,513
That can only be one thing.

1095
01:31:58,596 --> 01:32:00,974
The fearsome power of the Emerald.

1096
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:05,061
If that thing really turns thoughts
into power, we are in big trouble.

1097
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:07,188
Robotnik has a lot of bad thoughts.

1098
01:32:07,272 --> 01:32:10,233
Hey, Sonic,
are you sure it was a good idea

1099
01:32:10,316 --> 01:32:11,818
bringing you-know-who aboard?

1100
01:32:11,901 --> 01:32:15,655
Knuckles isn't really a bad guy.
He's just a little mixed up.

1101
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:17,449
I am not mixed up!

1102
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:22,412
I have steely focus. And I'm complex.
And that's a lot for some people.

1103
01:32:23,246 --> 01:32:25,874
Hope you're not still mad
I hit you with that car.

1104
01:32:26,624 --> 01:32:28,376
I was completely uninjured.

1105
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:31,629
And my revenge will come
when you least expect it, fox.

1106
01:33:03,078 --> 01:33:05,663
Sir, you're magnificent!

1107
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:07,791
Thank you, sycophant.

1108
01:33:07,874 --> 01:33:10,293
Your admiration is inevitable.

1109
01:33:20,345 --> 01:33:21,805
I knew it!

1110
01:33:21,888 --> 01:33:24,390
Just like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

1111
01:33:25,475 --> 01:33:27,519
World Domination playlist.

1112
01:33:40,865 --> 01:33:42,033
Fall back.

1113
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:46,287
Fall back! Quick! Retreat!

1114
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:50,375
How are we supposed to beat this thing?

1115
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:51,501
We need a plan.

1116
01:33:51,584 --> 01:33:53,628
Knuckles, use your strength to...

1117
01:33:54,212 --> 01:33:56,548
Jump off the plane. Wow.

1118
01:33:56,631 --> 01:34:00,552
Okay, this is what we're gonna do.
Step 1: Light taunting.

1119
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:02,387
Step 2: I have no idea.

1120
01:34:05,515 --> 01:34:06,683
Sonic!

1121
01:34:09,853 --> 01:34:11,813
Nice action figure, Eggman.

1122
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:14,816
Does it do anything
or just stand there looking ugly?

1123
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:21,156
Like a blister, he keeps coming back!

1124
01:34:22,157 --> 01:34:25,118
He's on the okay-to-kill list.
Shoot the missiles. Make a decision.

1125
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:27,996
I need a moment, sir.
I'm trying to figure out how to do this.

1126
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:30,165
Did you even glance at a manual?

1127
01:34:30,248 --> 01:34:32,417
- No!
- I'll do it.

1128
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:33,918
Pardon my lightning.

1129
01:34:34,002 --> 01:34:35,879
You might want to ground yourself.

1130
01:34:39,132 --> 01:34:41,676
I'm gonna pop that thing open
like a can of chili...

1131
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:45,680
Hang on!

1132
01:34:58,985 --> 01:35:01,237
- Yeah!
- Close one.

1133
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:03,114
Sonic!

1134
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:08,453
Robotnik!

1135
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:11,539
Deceiver!

1136
01:35:11,623 --> 01:35:13,416
Die, mosquito.

1137
01:35:25,845 --> 01:35:26,846
I felt that.

1138
01:35:46,032 --> 01:35:47,492
What just happened?

1139
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:50,828
It's the Stache Masher.
Right here in the manual.

1140
01:35:53,122 --> 01:35:55,458
Return to sender.

1141
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:04,384
Stone?

1142
01:36:05,885 --> 01:36:10,056
Great. Next thing you know, there'll be
a report about a hostile work environment.

1143
01:36:13,142 --> 01:36:16,312
Those were our best attacks,
and they did nothing!

1144
01:36:16,396 --> 01:36:20,233
We can't beat Robotnik as long as he's got
that Emerald. He's too powerful.

1145
01:36:20,316 --> 01:36:23,403
Look, we aren't strong enough
to beat Robotnik on our own.

1146
01:36:23,486 --> 01:36:24,737
But there's three of us.

1147
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:27,991
Your strength, your smarts and my speed.

1148
01:36:28,074 --> 01:36:29,742
Together. That's how we win.

1149
01:36:29,826 --> 01:36:34,289
So we make our stand here
on the field of battle.

1150
01:36:34,372 --> 01:36:35,748
As a team.

1151
01:36:35,832 --> 01:36:37,333
This is it.

1152
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:41,379
This is our moment.

1153
01:36:43,423 --> 01:36:44,924
Time to fight.

1154
01:36:52,432 --> 01:36:55,852
Bad time to say this,
but I don't actually have a plan.

1155
01:36:56,853 --> 01:36:58,688
Tails, any ideas?

1156
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:00,440
We have to find his weak spot.

1157
01:37:00,523 --> 01:37:02,150
I suggest the groin.

1158
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:04,319
What? No. No!

1159
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:06,988
Traditionally, yes,
the groin is the weakest spot.

1160
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:09,115
Stop saying "groin."

1161
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:10,992
Hedgehog!

1162
01:37:11,075 --> 01:37:12,410
Look out!

1163
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:17,707
I know what his weak spot is. It's me.

1164
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:19,542
I'm the groin!

1165
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:25,131
Think about it.
I live rent-free in this dude's head.

1166
01:37:25,214 --> 01:37:27,050
So if I go out there and rile him up...

1167
01:37:27,133 --> 01:37:29,552
He'll focus on only you,
leaving himself open

1168
01:37:29,635 --> 01:37:31,888
to a flanking maneuver
from me and the fox!

1169
01:37:31,971 --> 01:37:34,724
Hedgehog,
you are a brave and noble warrior.

1170
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:37,477
Go to your certain death with honor.

1171
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:40,104
We're gonna have to work
on your pep talks, pal.

1172
01:37:40,188 --> 01:37:41,981
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

1173
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:47,320
All right, mustache.

1174
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:50,239
You want me? Come and get me.

1175
01:37:50,323 --> 01:37:53,076
You don't tell me
about coming and getting.

1176
01:37:53,159 --> 01:37:55,536
I am on the cutting edge
of coming and getting!

1177
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:57,538
Coming, getting.

1178
01:37:57,622 --> 01:38:01,793
Coming, getting.
Coming, getting. Coming, getting.

1179
01:38:04,379 --> 01:38:06,464
You're really heavy.

1180
01:38:06,547 --> 01:38:10,385
That's because I am
one million percent muscle. Faster, fox!

1181
01:38:12,595 --> 01:38:15,765
- Go! Move, guys! Move back!
- Let's go, that's it! Go, go, go!

1182
01:38:15,848 --> 01:38:16,891
- Keep going!
- Go! Go!

1183
01:38:16,974 --> 01:38:18,851
- No, no! Stop!
- Stop the truck!

1184
01:38:18,935 --> 01:38:20,228
Tom, what happened here?

1185
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:23,189
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Let's get our kid.

1186
01:38:23,272 --> 01:38:24,649
We need your truck!

1187
01:38:30,863 --> 01:38:33,074
Coming, getting.

1188
01:38:34,075 --> 01:38:36,077
Yoo-hoo!

1189
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,079
So what's the plan here?

1190
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:43,042
You gonna build a big robot house?
Get yourself a big robot wife?

1191
01:38:43,126 --> 01:38:47,463
I'm going to enslave humanity
and force them to service my machines.

1192
01:38:47,547 --> 01:38:50,383
First, Green Hills. Then the universe.

1193
01:38:50,466 --> 01:38:51,717
Then the multiverse.

1194
01:38:51,801 --> 01:38:54,512
Then who knows? Maybe that'll be enough.

1195
01:38:55,179 --> 01:38:56,472
Full disclosure?

1196
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:59,934
You won't be there.

1197
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:06,607
Eye lasers? Really?

1198
01:39:19,078 --> 01:39:21,038
Snot rocket!

1199
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:23,666
No, no, no!

1200
01:39:32,175 --> 01:39:33,676
Giving up already?

1201
01:39:33,759 --> 01:39:37,472
Not so tough when you're fighting someone
700 times your size, are ya?

1202
01:39:39,599 --> 01:39:42,059
You can't beat me!

1203
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:45,354
I'm all-powerful! All-knowing!

1204
01:39:48,065 --> 01:39:50,276
All-seeing.

1205
01:39:51,402 --> 01:39:53,738
Looks like your fancy robot has a glitch.

1206
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:57,074
Is it me? What about me? I'm over here.
Up top! Down below! Behind you!

1207
01:39:58,075 --> 01:39:59,994
I'm over here. Sorry! Over here.

1208
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:01,829
Too slow! Try again.

1209
01:40:01,913 --> 01:40:03,956
- You can't outsmart me.
- Missed me again.

1210
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:05,833
I'm the outsmarter-er!

1211
01:40:10,171 --> 01:40:13,132
I didn't outsmart you.
I'm just the distraction.

1212
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:14,509
Robotnik!

1213
01:40:15,134 --> 01:40:17,887
I am also a hologram.

1214
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:19,889
Disloyal.

1215
01:40:19,972 --> 01:40:22,808
"Dis" is how I roll.

1216
01:40:51,212 --> 01:40:52,755
Where's my Emerald?

1217
01:40:53,506 --> 01:40:55,383
No, no, no, no!

1218
01:40:55,466 --> 01:40:57,802
Computer, auxiliary power.

1219
01:41:07,144 --> 01:41:09,397
The Emerald. It's right there.

1220
01:41:09,939 --> 01:41:11,857
Move, you hunk of junk!

1221
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:19,782
I have to... reach it.

1222
01:41:43,014 --> 01:41:44,015
Come on.

1223
01:41:46,183 --> 01:41:48,352
There he is! Go! Go, go, go!

1224
01:41:57,278 --> 01:41:58,321
No!

1225
01:41:58,404 --> 01:41:59,697
We got you, Sonic.

1226
01:42:00,906 --> 01:42:02,325
Hold on!

1227
01:42:15,546 --> 01:42:17,798
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

1228
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:20,343
Okay.

1229
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:27,933
I got the Emerald.
We could still defeat him.

1230
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:31,187
Come on, come on.
How does this thing work? What do I do?

1231
01:42:32,396 --> 01:42:33,564
What?

1232
01:42:34,231 --> 01:42:36,942
No. No, no, no!

1233
01:42:40,821 --> 01:42:44,992
Look at the happy little family.

1234
01:42:50,873 --> 01:42:53,376
You have to get away from me.
I'm the one he wants.

1235
01:42:53,459 --> 01:42:54,460
Hey.

1236
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:56,587
We're not going anywhere.

1237
01:42:57,171 --> 01:42:58,339
We're family.

1238
01:43:01,926 --> 01:43:03,594
And families stick together

1239
01:43:06,472 --> 01:43:07,682
no matter what.

1240
01:43:10,810 --> 01:43:11,936
I love you guys.

1241
01:43:12,853 --> 01:43:14,397
We love you too, Sonic.

1242
01:43:22,905 --> 01:43:24,365
No!

1243
01:43:26,409 --> 01:43:28,577
I got him!

1244
01:43:28,661 --> 01:43:32,248
I finally got him!

1245
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:39,463
What was that?

1246
01:44:25,342 --> 01:44:27,553
It's over, Eggman.

1247
01:44:28,929 --> 01:44:31,640
I like the new look. It works for you.

1248
01:44:32,224 --> 01:44:35,227
What do you say
we just let bygones be bygones?

1249
01:44:35,311 --> 01:44:39,064
I did some things, you did some things.
There are good people on both sides.

1250
01:44:40,775 --> 01:44:43,861
Surely two intelligent beings

1251
01:44:45,613 --> 01:44:47,615
can work these things out!

1252
01:44:59,627 --> 01:45:02,087
- Come on, buddy. Come on.
- Get him, Sonic!

1253
01:45:02,171 --> 01:45:03,506
Yeah. Come on.

1254
01:45:20,064 --> 01:45:21,524
It's like that?

1255
01:45:23,025 --> 01:45:25,319
Okay, we're not friends.

1256
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:32,034
Later, hater!

1257
01:45:43,420 --> 01:45:44,880
- Sonic!
- Buddy!

1258
01:45:45,464 --> 01:45:47,508
Wait! You cannot touch him!

1259
01:45:47,591 --> 01:45:50,261
The hedgehog holds
the power of the Emerald.

1260
01:45:50,970 --> 01:45:54,557
I am sorry.
He is no longer the Sonic you once knew.

1261
01:45:55,140 --> 01:45:56,141
What?

1262
01:46:16,078 --> 01:46:17,705
You got to try this.

1263
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:26,797
Okay.
He is exactly the Sonic you once knew.

1264
01:46:38,517 --> 01:46:39,602
Sonic!

1265
01:46:41,896 --> 01:46:43,480
Bring it in, bud.

1266
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:46,901
It's good to be back in blue.

1267
01:46:46,984 --> 01:46:50,321
The golden god thing was fun,
but blue has always been more my color.

1268
01:46:50,404 --> 01:46:51,488
Looks good on you.

1269
01:46:51,572 --> 01:46:56,994
Sonic, you were the most powerful hero
in the universe, and you let it go.

1270
01:46:57,077 --> 01:46:58,162
Why?

1271
01:46:59,914 --> 01:47:03,042
Because I still have
some growing up to do.

1272
01:47:05,294 --> 01:47:09,048
- And I kind of like being a kid.
- And you're not just any kid.

1273
01:47:09,632 --> 01:47:11,508
You're our kid.

1274
01:47:11,592 --> 01:47:13,010
That's right.

1275
01:47:13,093 --> 01:47:15,804
- Bring it in!
- Yay. Hugs.

1276
01:47:15,888 --> 01:47:18,724
It's a good thing we didn't do this
before. You would've blown up.

1277
01:47:26,357 --> 01:47:27,942
You fixed it.

1278
01:47:28,025 --> 01:47:31,362
I've spent my whole life
questing for this.

1279
01:47:31,445 --> 01:47:32,738
Now I have it.

1280
01:47:32,821 --> 01:47:34,615
Now we have it.

1281
01:47:34,698 --> 01:47:37,284
What do we do with it? What next?

1282
01:47:37,368 --> 01:47:39,495
There were once two orders of heroes

1283
01:47:39,578 --> 01:47:43,707
who protected the galaxy from those
who would use the Emerald for evil.

1284
01:47:43,791 --> 01:47:47,670
But they have all passed on
to the great battleground in the sky.

1285
01:47:47,753 --> 01:47:51,215
So we start a new order. The three of us.

1286
01:47:51,298 --> 01:47:53,008
This is no light task.

1287
01:47:53,092 --> 01:47:57,721
We must make a vow to use our powers
to keep the universe safe,

1288
01:47:58,555 --> 01:48:00,391
to watch out for each other.

1289
01:48:00,474 --> 01:48:02,184
Our new tribe.

1290
01:48:02,267 --> 01:48:03,394
I know!

1291
01:48:03,477 --> 01:48:05,896
- A power bump!
- Good idea.

1292
01:48:06,939 --> 01:48:10,150
It's an Earth custom.
An unbreakable promise.

1293
01:48:10,734 --> 01:48:12,027
Very well.

1294
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:15,239
A power bump it is.

1295
01:48:16,407 --> 01:48:18,075
Power bump!

1296
01:48:21,996 --> 01:48:26,125
It's truly a beautiful day for baseball
here in Green Hills.

1297
01:48:26,208 --> 01:48:27,918
An exciting lineup today

1298
01:48:28,002 --> 01:48:31,296
with the debut appearance
of two new players!

1299
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:35,551
On the mound,
rookie sensation from across the galaxy,

1300
01:48:35,634 --> 01:48:38,178
Miles "Tails" Prower,

1301
01:48:38,262 --> 01:48:42,975
facing off against the powerhouse,
Knuckles the Echidna.

1302
01:48:44,435 --> 01:48:46,311
I don't understand.

1303
01:48:46,395 --> 01:48:48,564
Why am I angry at the enemy ball?

1304
01:48:48,647 --> 01:48:49,815
You're not angry.

1305
01:48:49,898 --> 01:48:53,152
You just want to hit it as hard as you can
and then run around the bases.

1306
01:48:53,235 --> 01:48:57,865
But if my quest ends where I am standing,
why run at all?

1307
01:48:58,532 --> 01:49:01,076
I can't with this guy. Why do I even try?

1308
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:03,829
This is just a game.
We're out here having fun.

1309
01:49:03,912 --> 01:49:05,414
Just having some fun.

1310
01:49:05,497 --> 01:49:06,915
Fun.

1311
01:49:08,125 --> 01:49:10,502
All right! Give him the heat, Tails!

1312
01:49:10,586 --> 01:49:12,504
Hope you're ready for my fastball.

1313
01:49:12,588 --> 01:49:15,049
Your fastball will be dishonored.

1314
01:49:15,132 --> 01:49:17,384
And so will you, fox.

1315
01:49:17,468 --> 01:49:19,845
- Easy, guys!
- Don't think about it too much.

1316
01:49:19,928 --> 01:49:23,348
Just keep your elbow up,
eye on the ball and give it a ride.

1317
01:49:23,432 --> 01:49:24,850
A ride? To where?

1318
01:49:29,104 --> 01:49:30,397
Power bump!

1319
01:49:35,694 --> 01:49:37,154
Victory is mine!

1320
01:49:37,237 --> 01:49:39,782
Hey, no fair! That shouldn't count.

1321
01:49:39,865 --> 01:49:42,117
First base is also mine!

1322
01:49:42,201 --> 01:49:46,789
- I think that was our only ball.
- I have conquered the second of the bases!

1323
01:49:46,872 --> 01:49:48,415
Who wants ice cream?

1324
01:49:48,499 --> 01:49:49,708
Knocked the cover off that.

1325
01:49:49,792 --> 01:49:51,710
- Ice cream!
- Ice cream, yeah!

1326
01:49:52,961 --> 01:49:56,423
I am having the fun! What is ice cream?

1327
01:49:56,507 --> 01:49:59,843
It's a dessert.
If you like fun, you're gonna love it.

1328
01:49:59,927 --> 01:50:03,097
Yum. Dessert. Does it have grapes in it?

1329
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:04,765
No, not usually.

1330
01:50:04,848 --> 01:50:06,517
I'm proud of our little guy.

1331
01:50:07,392 --> 01:50:10,437
I really like his new friends,
especially the red one.

1332
01:50:10,938 --> 01:50:13,565
- He cracks me up.
- Heck of a swing too.

1333
01:50:13,649 --> 01:50:16,401
Come on, fox.
Our dessert adventure awaits.

1334
01:50:16,485 --> 01:50:17,820
- Good job, guys.
- Yeah.

1335
01:50:17,903 --> 01:50:21,198
You too, baby. Let's go get
some ice cream. Come on, come on.

1336
01:50:22,366 --> 01:50:24,535
I'm happy for you, pal.

1337
01:50:24,618 --> 01:50:27,788
Got your wingmen.
Perfect friends to grow up with.

1338
01:50:27,871 --> 01:50:31,166
- Come on, Knuckles.
- My victory chariot!

1339
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:36,171
I've got a lot more than that... Dad.

1340
01:50:41,635 --> 01:50:42,970
Race you to the truck.

1341
01:50:44,638 --> 01:50:46,056
One, two, three, go!

1342
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:48,767
No, don't go easy on me. I want your best.

1343
01:50:48,851 --> 01:50:51,812
Sonic, I have just been told
they have sprinkles.

1344
01:50:51,895 --> 01:50:55,566
Ice cream and sprinkles?
This is your new destiny.

1345
01:50:55,649 --> 01:51:00,571
What a perfect meal to celebrate
my victory over you in base of ball.

1346
01:51:00,654 --> 01:51:03,282
- What?
- I mean, you barely beat me.

1347
01:51:03,949 --> 01:51:06,451
You've never been beaten so hard.

1348
01:51:10,873 --> 01:51:12,040
Can't forget this.

1349
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:13,287
Agent, I want an update.

1350
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:16,290
Still searching, sir.
We haven't found any sign of Robotnik.

1351
01:53:16,373 --> 01:53:18,709
No one could've survived that crash.

1352
01:53:18,792 --> 01:53:21,378
He's toast. Good riddance.

1353
01:53:21,962 --> 01:53:24,715
What a mess that lunatic made.

1354
01:53:25,299 --> 01:53:28,176
Sir, there's something else.

1355
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:32,222
When we were wiping Robotnik
off our database, we found something.

1356
01:53:32,306 --> 01:53:36,059
A file buried deep in our system
and dating back over 50 years.

1357
01:53:36,143 --> 01:53:39,062
- What was it?
- Coordinates, sir.

1358
01:53:39,146 --> 01:53:41,023
Coordinates? To what?

1359
01:53:41,773 --> 01:53:43,734
A secret research facility.

1360
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:45,944
It was a black site, sir.

1361
01:53:46,695 --> 01:53:49,156
Someone worked very hard
to keep this hidden.

1362
01:53:50,532 --> 01:53:51,742
My God.

1363
01:53:52,701 --> 01:53:54,036
Project Shadow.
