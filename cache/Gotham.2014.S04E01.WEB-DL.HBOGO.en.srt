1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,360
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,560
The infected are being killed
all over the city.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,880
I'm the one you seek.
I am Ra's al Ghul.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,800
This man is your past.
Now, embrace your future.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,600
Use the waters, Bruce.

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,560
You were the one time
I let love weaken me.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,960
I want you around
as a constant reminder

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,080
to never make that mistake again.

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,160
No!

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,840
I heard about Alfred.
Is he gonna be okay?

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,280
You don't give a damn about Alfred

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,800
and you sure as hell
don't care about me.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,120
- I know you better than that.
- I thought you did.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,160
Jonathan Crane's father
made a toxin

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,160
from the adrenal glands
of his victim.

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,880
All they experience is terror.

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,080
- What do you want?
- I'm tired of just surviving.

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,160
I want more.

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,320
I'm sorry, Alfred.

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,840
I've been trying to find
who I am for so long.

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,360
Who am I supposed to be?

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,760
Money, now!

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,800
You need to find your true north

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,200
and let that guide you.

25
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,880
You've always picked up the Penguin.

26
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,960
I know.

27
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,000
Money, now!

28
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,920
- Please, don't hurt us.
- Give it to me.

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,880
Hurry up, all of it.
Give me the ring.

30
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,240
I'm trying.

31
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,320
You have one chance.
Walk away.

32
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,480
Who's this?

33
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,880
I...

34
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,640
I got a license.

35
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,840
{\an5}<i>Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down</i>

36
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,960
<i>Never gonna run around
and desert you</i>

37
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,240
{\an5}<i>Never gonna make you cry,
Never gonna say goodbye</i>

38
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,360
<i>Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you</i>

39
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,600
{\an5}Nobody move.

40
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,560
Jewelry, watches, wallets.

41
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,840
You know the drill. Let's go.

42
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,440
- We wanted all.
- All your money.

43
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,640
{\an5}- Hey, you.
- Come on. Oh, nice. Thank you.

44
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,960
{\an5}- Oh, jackpot.
- Hey you.

45
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,040
Let me see that.

46
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,040
{\an5}Cheapskate, huh.

47
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,680
{\an5}- Come on.
- Hey, careful.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Excuse me.

49
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
Hi.

50
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,560
{\an5}- That's Victor Zsasz.
- I know who it is.

51
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
{\an5}What do you want?

52
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,880
{\an5}Oh, I was just passing by
heard the ruckus.

53
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,680
{\an5}You know you can't commit a crime
in Gotham now

54
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,760
{\an5}without a license
from Penguin, right?

55
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
{\an5}Is it right?

56
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,240
{\an5}Well, we just started it
so words still getting out.

57
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,280
{\an5}We're kicking half our take
to that little creep.

58
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Well...

59
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
...that's a problem.

60
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,520
{\an5}Maybe you ain't notice,
but there's four of us

61
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,760
and only one of you.

62
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,840
My finger!

63
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,200
{\an5}No license, no crime.

64
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,360
{\an5}Now, drop the loot and blow.

65
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,440
{\an5}You tell Penguin he hasn't heard
the last of this.

66
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,400
{\an5}And stay out.

67
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,600
I can't thank you enough.

68
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,840
Don't bother
because you see those guys

69
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,840
they do have a license.

70
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,960
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

71
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,560
Seriously?

72
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,160
{\an5}No.

73
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,480
{\an5}Best wedding ever.

74
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,200
You know, we appreciate
all you've done.

75
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
Do you?

76
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,480
Three months ago,
following the Tetch incident,

77
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,480
this city was in flames.

78
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,880
I came to you
and offered to, cut crime in half

79
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,200
and I delivered.

80
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,760
Violent crime is down 57%.

81
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,560
But now, you want to literally
unionize crime.

82
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,080
- I mean, but we can't possibly...
- Quiet!

83
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,920
I remember when I sat there.

84
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,960
In the mayor's chair.

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,240
I do not envy you.

86
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,480
Or you.

87
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,160
Commissioner of police
and a city notorious for crime.

88
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,000
That's why I wanna help.

89
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,520
Yeah, but we are fully aware
of all you've done.

90
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Are you?

91
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,720
What do you think really happened
to those hordes of criminals

92
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,560
who once prowled our streets?

93
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,000
I'll tell you. I hunted them down...

94
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,880
- No, no, no.
- I made Gotham safe.

95
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,440
Me.

96
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,040
But this is Gotham City.

97
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,680
There will always be crime.

98
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,960
What I am offering is crime
in the hands of professionals.

99
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,720
And held to agreed upon terms...

100
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,920
from which you'll profit.

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,280
God bless, America.

102
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,840
You have a choice.

103
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,320
An era of calm and prosperity.

104
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,680
Or return to the good old days.

105
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,960
And they will return
with a vengeance.

106
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,080
We deny everything to the press.

107
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,880
What you need to worry about
is the G.C.P.D.

108
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,320
When one of your officers
finds someone committing a crime,

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,960
if that person has a license,

110
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,240
they walk away.

111
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,880
3% each from the day.

112
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,640
Two, to split between you.

113
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,960
- Two and a half.
- One.

114
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,920
- You...
- Yes, fine. Done.

115
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,160
Excellent.

116
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,440
Well, if you'll excuse me

117
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,280
I have to go prepare
for the grand opening

118
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,280
of my new club, The Iceberg Lounge.

119
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,440
Good luck.

120
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,280
Smile, gentlemen. It's a new day.

121
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,200
- Hi, Frank.
- Morning, Jim.

122
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,680
I'll get you coffee in a second.

123
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,840
Sure.

124
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,960
- Morning.
- Good morning.

125
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,720
- Everything okay, Frank?
- Everything's fine, copper.

126
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,960
I got a license.

127
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,360
Penguin approved.

128
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,680
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

129
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,320
I'll take that coffee to go.

130
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,160
What the hell are you doing?

131
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,520
- Look, I got a license.
- Yeah.

132
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,680
And unless you shut up...

133
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,360
...you're also gonna get a fat lip.

134
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
We got a problem?

135
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,600
Penguin guarantees these numbers?

136
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,240
Mr. Cobblepot has negotiated them
with the Mayor and Commissioner.

137
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,760
It's a damn good numbers.

138
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,040
But I already heard
from the Commissioner

139
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,120
we have to play ball.

140
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,280
What the hell are you doing here?

141
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,560
Compliance
with the licenses is key.

142
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,560
Mr. Cobblepot worries
about Detective Gordon.

143
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
He has a history.

144
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,400
My men will honor the licenses.

145
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,320
You let me worry about Gordon.

146
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,960
Now, get the hell out of my office.

147
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,240
- Who was that?
- A dung beetle.

148
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
What's up?

149
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,080
I pulled this...

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,120
...off of some guy
robbing my corner bar.

151
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,440
You're a homicide detective.

152
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,960
Isn't stick up a little, JV?

153
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,600
I'm a cop. I see a crime, I stop it.

154
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,360
This is the second one of these
I've come across

155
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,200
- and I'm not the only one.
- Yeah.

156
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
Harvey.

157
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,440
Harvey, we cannot let this slide.

158
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,560
Words come down
from the Commissioner.

159
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,680
You find someone
with one of those, they walk.

160
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,120
And before you get on your
high horse three months ago

161
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,800
this city was in a tailspin.

162
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,920
We survived because Penguin
took control of the underworld.

163
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,800
I am not giving this city
over to Penguin.

164
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,040
I don't care
what the commissioner says.

165
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,640
What about your fellow cops
on the past month?

166
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,440
- How many have been shot?
- None. I know the stats.

167
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,320
Jim, we will bust Penguin one day.
I promise you.

168
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,960
But this city has to get back
on her feet.

169
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,920
- Please.
- Harvey, I get that.

170
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,240
But everyday the citizens
of Gotham look to Penguin

171
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,480
and not the G.C.P.D.
to keep them safe

172
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,200
the harder it's gonna be
to win them back.

173
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,800
You want people to trust cops?

174
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,960
There are better ways in doing it
than spitting in Penguin's eyes.

175
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,240
You see one of these, you walk.

176
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,640
Bloody Penguin.

177
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,240
There must be some way
we can turn this against him.

178
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh, just... just stop.

179
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,000
Stop right there.

180
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,880
How does this fit in
to what we're doing?

181
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,200
What was the initial reason
that you popped on that mask

182
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,480
and you went out there?

183
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,760
We agreed that I have to be ready
for when Ra's al Ghul returns.

184
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,920
You, yourself, said
there's no substitute

185
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
for real world encounters.

186
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,000
But my point is if that is
our mission, we must hold to it.

187
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,120
My finger was on the button
that released the virus.

188
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,240
- Oh, I see.
- I know I didn't press it,

189
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,000
but I feel responsible
for what happened.

190
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,600
And more than that, I could make
a difference in Gotham, Alfred.

191
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,520
- I know I can.
- And that is what we call

192
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,800
mission creep, Master Bruce.

193
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,840
You are trying to achieve
not one but two objectives.

194
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,480
So, go on then.
Which one is your priority?

195
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,400
It's messy, sir.

196
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,640
It's dangerous.

197
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,960
I hear you, Alfred.

198
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,320
But I can prepare myself for Ra's
and make Gotham safer.

199
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,120
You have to trust me.

200
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,040
<i>All inmates to the platform
in five minutes.</i>

201
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,920
<i>Make your way to the door.
Secure the...</i>

202
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
This way.

203
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,520
Hey, Warden Reed.

204
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,680
Warden Reed is the boss here.

205
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,040
- Where is he?
- This way.

206
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,160
Back when I was in orderly in here

207
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,440
he'd always talk about his dad
and this formula he'd made.

208
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,480
Some sort of scare juice.

209
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,160
Make you see your greatest fear.

210
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,280
Well, we get a hold of that.

211
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,920
We don't gotta worry about Zsasz
or Penguin.

212
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,080
Or nobody.

213
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,080
What's wrong with him, anyway?

214
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,400
The toxin his father
injected him with

215
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,080
have reloaded Jonathan's
fear response.

216
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,760
His mind created a sort
of bogeyman figure.

217
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,280
Now, it haunts him.

218
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,880
I find it very useful for...

219
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,760
...controlling him.

220
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,680
Jonathan,
you're going with these men.

221
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,920
What? Wait, where are you taking me?

222
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,760
We just want to give someone
a little scare.

223
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
Excellent.

224
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,520
Yeah, that's all...
That's all my dad's stuff.

225
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,040
Look, I can't be here after dark.

226
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,440
Please, I really,
I cannot be here after...

227
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,480
You were your daddy's
little assistant, weren't you?

228
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,200
You help with the experiments.

229
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,160
Some but I don't know everything.

230
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,120
But you're gonna take
your daddy's notebooks

231
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,400
and make as much of that
fear juice as I say.

232
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,680
And so you don't get lonely?

233
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,000
The boy is here.
I brought your friend.

234
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,080
No.

235
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,400
No, make it stop!

236
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,360
No, you don't understand! Stop.

237
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
No, you don't understand!

238
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,600
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

239
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,120
May I have your attention, please.

240
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Hey, what the...

241
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,880
All the money now!

242
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,800
- Give it to me. All of that.
- Yes, sir, yes.

243
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,720
Hey, you have a license?

244
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
Oh, here.

245
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,280
Look at me.

246
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,360
Fiery demons.
It was fiery demons. Demons.

247
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,840
Demons, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, we'll catch him.

248
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,120
Get him out of here. Go, go, go.

249
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Fiery demons.

250
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
Hey.

251
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,720
Did Penguin issue a license for this?

252
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,960
Why are you asking me?

253
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,840
Best of my knowledge, no.

254
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,600
And why do something so public?

255
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,560
Unless you're trying
to send Penguin a message.

256
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,640
I hope the message was,

257
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,480
"Please send Victor Zsasz
down here to kill me"

258
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,280
because that's exactly
what's gonna happen.

259
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,240
- Not if I find him first.
- Hey.

260
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,280
You ask me to stop busting
crooks with licenses.

261
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,680
This gang didn't have a license.

262
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,320
And you're gonna find him
before Zsasz

263
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,800
just to prove the G.C.P.D.
still matters?

264
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,400
That's not thumb in your nose
at Penguin?

265
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,640
- Fire me.
- Hey, don't tempt me.

266
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,800
You got a lead?

267
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,000
The victims, the way they're acting

268
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,480
their terror reminds me
of Crane's formula.

269
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,960
You think someone's using
the fear juice?

270
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,760
It ain't him. He's dead, remember?

271
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,080
Not that that matters much
in this town anymore.

272
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
He's dead.

273
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,520
His son isn't.

274
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,080
Jonathan Crane's condition
is fragile.

275
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,480
I'm afraid he can't see anyone

276
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,880
certainly not the two men
who killed his father.

277
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,440
Yes, so how many loonies
you got in this joint?

278
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,080
436 total.

279
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,120
We mustn't call them loonies.

280
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Of course not.

281
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,240
How about staff
that had access to Crane?

282
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,600
Any of them not show up for work?

283
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,640
All present and accounted for.

284
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,440
- You don't wanna check?
- We don't need to.

285
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,720
See, that's impressive

286
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
because I ran a precinct

287
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,120
and if half my cops didn't show up,
I'd be none the wiser.

288
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,680
It's true. He wouldn't.

289
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,200
Clearly, we have different
professional standards.

290
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,800
Jonathan Crane's father
created a toxin

291
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,120
that makes people see
their greatest fear.

292
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,680
This morning it was used
to rob a bank.

293
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,320
How is that my problem?

294
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,560
Let me explain it to you.

295
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,160
See, whoever rob the bank

296
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,320
they challenge Penguin.

297
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,720
And all we have to do

298
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,040
is tell Penguin that you're involved

299
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,120
and he'll send Victor Zsasz
down here to talk to you.

300
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,680
Jim, how would you describe Victor?

301
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,960
Victor Zsasz...

302
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,120
...a homicidal maniac and sadist.

303
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,120
A homicidal maniac and sadist

304
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,120
to the highest professional
standards.

305
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,120
So, you can talk with us
here and now,

306
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,120
or you can talk to Victor.

307
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,560
They threatened me.
I had no choice.

308
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,560
We want a name, putz.

309
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,280
I knew it ring a bell.

310
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,240
Grady Harris run a crew
a few years back

311
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,200
and his cousin murdered

312
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,120
a couple of cowboys
from the sticks.

313
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,000
Grady!

314
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,360
G.C.P.D.

315
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,400
G.C.P.D.!

316
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,360
Well, well, look at what we got here.

317
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,880
What's wrong with you, pigs

318
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,840
harassing honest fellas like us

319
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,040
when there's real criminals
out there?

320
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,760
You robbed a bank in broad daylight.

321
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,080
That don't make you a criminal?

322
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,560
I'm an outlaw.
Outlaws have a code.

323
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,640
Criminals, they'll take everything.

324
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,680
They'll take a man's livelihood
like the Penguin.

325
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,600
And his licenses.

326
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,080
But we're gonna show him, you'll see.

327
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,640
Penguin wouldn't give you a license

328
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,800
if you beg him until the cows
came home, you stupid hick.

329
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,680
You'll lucky I'm not the Penguin.

330
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,440
We'll gut you right here.

331
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,720
We're better than them.

332
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,160
Take care, pigs.

333
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,040
They see him anyway.

334
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,120
Hey, check it out.

335
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,400
- Are you lost?
- See.

336
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,720
We've got a company.

337
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,800
She all by herself?

338
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,320
Just let me go, okay?

339
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,880
Not a chance.

340
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,800
Don't say I didn't warn you.

341
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,760
Don't turn your back on a guy
unless you're sure he's down.

342
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,880
Otherwise, not bad.

343
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,400
Does this mean we can get pizza?

344
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,400
I'm just saying
you steal my pepperoni again,

345
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,480
I'll break your fingers.

346
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,600
So, you're saying,
do steal your pepperoni again?

347
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,000
I come in peace.

348
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,360
You, ladies,
were not easy to track down.

349
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,680
Then again,

350
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,960
I can see why you don't advertise.

351
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,240
Didn't you use to be rich?

352
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,320
That was before your boss
stole my club.

353
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,440
Well, you murdered his mum,

354
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,320
and tried to kill him.

355
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
So...

356
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
...call it even?

357
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,960
There a reason you're here?

358
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,320
Know about these?

359
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,920
The boss can have you operating
on your own.

360
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,640
Now, we can just kill you.

361
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,440
But he figures it's time
to let bygones be bygones.

362
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,560
How big of him.

363
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,960
Tomorrow night's the opening
of his club.

364
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,320
Come by, kiss the ring

365
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,480
get your license.

366
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,960
Is that pepperoni?

367
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,160
Goes without saying,
this is one of those...

368
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,960
...or else, kind of deals.

369
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,080
Later.

370
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,880
We gotta find a new place.

371
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,400
Why? We join Penguin,
we can at least get work.

372
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,600
I came to you
because I wanted to move up

373
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,360
and look around.

374
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,560
We're barely making it.

375
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,680
I'm not working for him.

376
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,560
Now, pack.

377
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Detective Gordon.

378
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,960
Bruce.

379
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I didn't hear you.

380
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,680
What happened?

381
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,280
Nothing.

382
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,760
Harvey and I were tracking a gang.

383
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,400
We let ourselves get surprised.

384
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,800
What brings you down here?

385
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,160
I found this when I was in the city.

386
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,520
Wasn't sure what to do with it.

387
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,080
One of Penguin's licenses.

388
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,680
Apparently, crime is legal now

389
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,280
and you're going along with that?

390
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,360
Not really.

391
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
There's a number on the license.

392
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,120
I was thinking, Penguin must have
some sort of master list.

393
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,280
Connecting the crime and the criminal
to the license issue.

394
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,840
Just like that we'll tell you not
only who committed that crime

395
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,840
or crimes that haven't
even happened yet.

396
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,520
Unfortunately, the judges are going
along with the licenses

397
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,920
and trying to track down
who in Penguin's organization

398
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,200
keeps the list.

399
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,560
We've set off too many alarms.

400
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,280
I see.

401
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
But you haven't given up.

402
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,080
You just said you were out
tracking gang.

403
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
It's different.

404
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,640
This gang isn't licensed

405
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,480
but Penguin will come after them
if he hasn't already.

406
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,200
And when he catches them

407
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,120
it'll be more proof that Gotham
doesn't need the G.C.P.D.

408
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,120
Sorry, it's been a long day.

409
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,120
So, why don't use Penguin
to lead you to them?

410
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
If I could figure out
how to do that, I would.

411
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,200
It was good to see you, Detective.

412
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,160
Would you come by the house
for dinner?

413
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,960
Yes.

414
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,160
I'd like that.

415
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,240
How about we grab a bite...

416
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
...tonight?

417
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,520
Exclusive, but welcoming,
we're bane and edgy.

418
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,360
Tonight's opening will establish

419
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,160
that Iceberg Lounge is Gotham's
newest place to see...

420
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
...and be seen.

421
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,360
And you say you acquired the clip
from Barbara Kean?

422
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,440
Is that a question?

423
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,000
It's just no one's seen her
for months and...

424
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,720
Now, Barbara Kean's whereabouts
are not my concern.

425
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,640
This wasn't Sirens Club.

426
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,640
It is now mine.

427
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,320
Mr. Cobblepot, there's a rumor
going around about criminals

428
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,680
being given licenses.

429
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,120
The rumor is you're issuing them.

430
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,120
Tell me, what is the crime rate
in Gotham?

431
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,120
We're at a historic close.

432
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,520
Historic close.

433
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,280
You know, Augustus Caesar
once presided over

434
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,560
the longest period
of peace and prosperity

435
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,840
the world has ever known.

436
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,240
It was called the Pax Romana.

437
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Perhaps one day, this would
be known as the Pax Penguina.

438
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,000
That's not a denial.

439
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,600
We're here to talk about my club.

440
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,040
Your readers
will find this interesting.

441
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,120
Ivy?

442
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,800
That's Edward Nygma.

443
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,840
Turns out Ed
had a very rare brain disease.

444
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,120
There is only one option.

445
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,080
To freeze him
and wait for the cure.

446
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,760
In his final lucid moments...

447
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,440
...he begged me, "Oswald

448
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,760
do not hide me away.

449
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,080
Put me out with the people."

450
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,160
It was the least I could do.

451
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,360
Anyone tell him he was being frozen?

452
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,720
I have affidavits from his doctor,
if you would like to see them.

453
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,840
No, thanks.

454
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,000
Well, Jim...

455
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,120
I'm rather busy,
so whatever your business is...

456
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,760
I came to tell you you're a fraud.

457
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,480
A gang that has Crane's fear toxin
and they're not afraid of you.

458
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,760
Others will find out,
and so it begins.

459
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,800
You've had a nice run, Oswald.

460
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,720
But it's over.

461
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
Coach him.

462
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,720
It's so hard to admit
when you've become irrelevant.

463
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,960
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.

464
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,640
I'm going to find this gang

465
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,200
and I'm going to crush them.

466
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,080
And everyone will see
that it is Oswald Cobblepot

467
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,240
the Penguin, who keeps Gotham safe.

468
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,200
Always good to see you, old friend.

469
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,600
<i>As he prepares for the opening
of the Iceberg Lounge</i>

470
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,320
<i>Oswald Cobblepot announced</i>

471
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,720
<i>that he would destroy the gang
that attacked</i>

472
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,680
<i>Gotham First National Bank yesterday.</i>

473
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,600
<i>He described them
as cowards and pond scum.</i>

474
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,080
Penguin's going down tonight.

475
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,560
Have you finished
that new batch yet?

476
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,680
Yes.

477
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,640
Oh, can you please, can you please
get rid of that, please?

478
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,160
What?
You and him ain't getting along?

479
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,680
Please, just get rid of it!

480
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,440
Listen, I gotta do
some things tonight,

481
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,800
but I think you, guys, should spend
some time together, huh?

482
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,800
- Please.
- We all have our fears to face.

483
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,920
Please, don't. I beg.

484
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,800
Stop, stop, please!

485
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,480
Stop, please!

486
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,680
No!

487
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,040
Stop!

488
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,000
Let me out!

489
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,920
Remember how you accused me
of being a slave to my emotions?

490
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,960
No more.

491
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,160
I've banished those feelings.

492
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,800
And look how I have risen.

493
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
But at what cost?

494
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,480
I wonder which of us is frozen.

495
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,240
Him.

496
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,880
He's, like, totally frozen.

497
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,600
Ivy, go somewhere else.

498
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,520
All right!

499
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,480
I want two unmarked units
at street level

500
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,040
and another two teams
of me and Harvey

501
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,800
watching the entrances of the club.

502
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,640
The moment that gang arrives,
we move.

503
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,280
You heard the man.

504
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,680
Suit up, let's go!

505
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,240
- Can we count on them?
- Let's see.

506
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,160
You tricked Penguin
into baying the gang

507
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,160
to attack his club,
hoping to arrest them

508
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,440
before they cause mass panic,
only so you could embarrass Penguin.

509
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,440
So, I would say, yeah,
they are about as dependable

510
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,000
as any other part
of this cockamamie plan.

511
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,160
Thanks.

512
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,480
I'll get the gas masks.

513
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,040
Please, let me out!

514
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
<i>Jonathan.</i>

515
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,240
Let me out!

516
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,600
<i>Jonathan.</i>

517
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,800
So you guys work for Penguin, huh?

518
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,080
It ain't like that.

519
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,880
- Sure.
- Come on, Gordon.

520
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,400
Since Penguin's been cracking down,
life's been good.

521
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,760
Why you gotta rock the boat?

522
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,680
What happens when he starts
giving out licenses for murders?

523
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,440
Huh? What then?

524
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,080
I'm wasting my breath, aren't I?

525
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,160
Pretty much.

526
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
All right then.

527
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
Who wants to be first?

528
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,360
Mr. Wayne.

529
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Mr. Pennyworth.

530
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,600
- I am so glad you could make it.
- It's our pleasure.

531
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,480
Congratulations.

532
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,800
We were just admiring
your frozen mates.

533
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,480
Is he still alive in there?

534
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,600
I fear we may never know.

535
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,720
But you'll know
when you finally thaw him out.

536
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,600
When they discover a cure
for his disease.

537
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,720
Oh, yes. Then, of course.

538
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,320
I wanted to personally thank you

539
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,920
for everything you've done
for this city.

540
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,080
Thank you, Mr. Wayne.

541
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,440
So...

542
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,240
...can I ask about the licenses?

543
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,800
A little discretion if you would,
Master Bruce.

544
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,200
Everybody's talking about it, Alfred.

545
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,600
I just wanna know how it works.

546
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,600
So, does someone come to you
and say, I'm gonna rob a bank?

547
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,520
Now, Bruce,
if I didn't know any better

548
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,880
I would think that you wanted me
to implicate myself.

549
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,560
Anything you say stays between us.

550
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,240
First, let me ask.

551
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,640
You would be agreeable
to the idea of licensed crime?

552
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,880
If crime have been licensed
and controlled three years ago

553
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,400
my parents would still be alive.

554
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,240
Exactly so.

555
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,240
Well, between us

556
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,600
I have nothing to do
with the licenses directly.

557
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,640
I provide the guidelines
while Mr. Penn

558
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,480
handles all of the details.

559
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,440
Now, would you excuse me?

560
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,680
- Well done, sir.
- Thank you.

561
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,120
Now, we know who has the list.

562
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,160
The next step is...

563
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
Selina.

564
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,760
Where is your babysitter?

565
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,200
It's kind of a package deal.

566
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,720
Yeah, well, he's got me.

567
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,840
Is that good enough or not?

568
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,560
Actually, we're both in.

569
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,960
We should pat you down
for weapons.

570
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,760
Sure, if you wanna lose a hand.

571
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,040
It's worth a shot.

572
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,320
I'll tell the boss.

573
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,360
See you.

574
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,280
You were worried about me.

575
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,280
Hey, man, I've been looking
all over for you.

576
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,400
Oh, ouch.

577
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,520
I think we can forget
about backup.

578
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,560
I see. You talked to some
of your fellow officers.

579
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,440
Probably not a bad thing.

580
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,920
- How's that?
- Guys get to let off steam.

581
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,840
Resentments don't fester.

582
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,720
Next time, you can get punched
in the face.

583
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,040
This beautiful mug,
no one would dare.

584
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,120
Let's go.

585
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,560
All right, once inside, get Zsasz
and Penguin first, and then go crazy.

586
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,000
I still don't see Penguin.

587
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,680
Hello.

588
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,400
I'm guessing that gas
isn't faster than a bullet.

589
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,480
What do you think?

590
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,840
Jim Gordon
and his ham-fisted manipulation.

591
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,360
He thought he fooled me.

592
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,840
You wanna do them here
or downstairs?

593
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,960
- It'd be a little loud in here.
- Neither.

594
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,680
I have something special
planned for them.

595
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,080
What do you want, Bruce?

596
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
You knew I'd follow you.

597
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,400
Just like I knew
that you'd come up here.

598
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,120
You don't know anything about me.

599
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,840
I wanted to apologize
for what I said at the hospital

600
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,160
when you came to visit Alfred.

601
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,000
You were making a kind gesture.

602
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,760
You wanna talk to me,
come up here.

603
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,560
My point is I'm sorry.

604
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,880
Yeah.

605
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,440
You were a jerk.

606
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,840
I saw you arrived
with Tabitha Galavan.

607
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,480
I'm not trying to choose her
as a mentor.

608
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
Wow.

609
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,120
That means absolutely nothing to me.

610
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,480
Selina.

611
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,320
You... you wanna say something?

612
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,920
It's a lovely dress
you're wearing tonight.

613
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,480
Honestly, you'd say.

614
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,080
Why can't you just go to a cinema
like normal teenagers?

615
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,200
Master Bruce, we've got
a bit of situation downstairs.

616
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,080
What sort of situation?

617
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,520
Let's go.

618
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,920
For the past three months

619
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,800
I have given this city
a tranquility that's never known.

620
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,400
Now, I would like to ensure
that peace for the future.

621
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,000
In the weeks to come,
you will hear whispers

622
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,360
about what's happening
on the streets of Gotham.

623
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,960
All you need to know

624
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,120
is, without me, this is what you get.

625
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,920
Men who want to bring fear
back to our city

626
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,880
who promised
a return to the old days.

627
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,600
So tell your families,
tell your friends

628
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,960
it is Oswald Cobblepot
who keeps them safe

629
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,280
not the G.C.P.D.

630
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,040
- You're welcome.
- That's right.

631
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,360
I have my things in the car, we can
stop them in the parking garage.

632
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,360
Absolutely not, Master Bruce.

633
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,560
Alfred, Penguin is gonna take
those men out and kill them.

634
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,640
Undoubtedly, sir.

635
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,160
But as you said before,
you can make a difference.

636
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,720
There is time for masks,
and there is a time for Bruce Wayne.

637
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,640
Do you know what's going
to be done to you?

638
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,720
Wait!

639
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,000
I want to know what
you're gonna do with those men.

640
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,800
You need not concern yourself
with that.

641
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,800
Are those men gonna be
turned over to the police?

642
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,960
Earlier tonight, you thanked me
for making this city safer.

643
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,440
Now, how do you think that happens?

644
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,880
I do the dirty work no one else will.

645
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,920
I understand.

646
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
But I'm asking you.

647
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,360
Turn those men over to the police.

648
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,400
You're young.

649
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,080
You have a good heart.

650
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,480
No.

651
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,960
Enjoy your party, Penguin.

652
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,160
Little twerp.

653
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,840
What's wrong? You scared?

654
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,360
Hey.

655
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,000
You're under arrest.

656
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,120
By order of the Gotham City
Police Department.

657
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,200
Cuff him.

658
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,560
Help me!

659
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,440
Help me! Help me!

660
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,760
Help me!

661
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,920
Penguin ain't gonna be too happy.

662
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,160
Screw him.

663
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,680
I'm just worried about
finding Jonathan Crane.

664
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,240
If he's out there, with access
to his father's formula...

665
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,760
Relax. We'll find him.

666
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,680
Wouldn't expect too much help
from these parts though.

667
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,960
There's good cops out there.

668
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,800
They just need reminding.

669
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,320
You have a list
of all the licenses you've given.

670
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,000
- I want it.
- I...

671
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,200
I can't.

672
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,440
Penguin, he'll...

673
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,040
- What about the alarm?
- Forget it.

674
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,640
You got a license, remember?

675
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,440
Hey, I found it. I got it. I got it.

676
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,640
Everybody out. Let's go. Come on.

677
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,240
Move.

678
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,680
Oh, no.

679
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
What the...

680
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,480
G.C.P.D.!

681
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,680
Gotham Police, you're under arrest.

682
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,200
Crane, we gotta make more
of that fear gas.

683
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,600
We gotta get Merton out of jail.
Crane!

684
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,760
Crane?

685
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,560
Jonathan Crane isn't here
anymore.

686
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,360
It's just the Scarecrow.
