1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,121
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:07,497
<i>Taking a life will lead you
down a darker path</i>

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,002
<i>that you could never imagine.</i>

4
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:11,050
I know, I've been down it.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,882
I'm not the hero Gotham needs.

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,256
<i>Then it's gonna be
a long, bumpy journey back.</i>

7
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:21,515
<i>You've met Martin, I see.</i>

8
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,813
You and I, we're more than friends.

9
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,685
<i>We're conspirators.</i>

10
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,688
Oh, no.

11
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,530
<i>You are relieved of duty,
Harvey Bullock.</i>

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,738
As of this moment, I am assuming the
captaincy of Gotham Central.

13
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,743
What did you have to do to get it?

14
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,662
<i>Gotham finds itself in
the hands of a ritualistic cop killer</i>

15
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,292
<i>Being called Professor Pyg.</i>

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,840
<i>It doesn't stop until I've
butchered every single swine</i>

17
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,096
<i>on Penguin's payroll.</i>

18
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,302
I'm gonna find you.

19
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,261
I hope you do, it's a spectacle.

20
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,349
And you're my muse, Jimmy Gordon.

21
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,527
My poor lost lambs.

22
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:15,482
I come to you today with an offer
for this evening.

23
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:20,279
Fresh biscuits and
a hearty bowl of soup.

24
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:24,040
I have place settings for six.

25
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,457
Nobody wants some fresh pumpkin pie?

26
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,838
Smile.

27
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,895
My children.

28
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,099
There are two Gothams.

29
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,566
The haves.

30
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,527
And the have-nots.

31
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,189
I know what it is

32
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,321
to feel like a have-not.

33
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:03,614
But I say, "Enough."

34
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:10,295
Here's to giving the haves a taste

35
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,335
of what it is like to be

36
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,126
a have-not.

37
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,938
Let's begin.

38
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:39,483
Shall we?

39
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,139
I'll be out of your way
in just a second, Captain.

40
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,424
Harvey.

41
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,432
This isn't how I wanted
things to go down.

42
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,017
And yet, here we are.

43
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,392
You know what
I was thinking about today?

44
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,144
Our first case.

45
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,105
When I told you to walk Penguin
to the end of the pier,

46
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,862
put a bullet in his head
and dump him in the water,

47
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:22,942
and you wouldn't.

48
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:25,278
- You thought it was wrong.
- It was.

49
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,030
Well, maybe if you would have done it,

50
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,323
Falcone would still be running things

51
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:33,124
and a lot of people who are dead
would be alive today.

52
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,329
If I could go back,

53
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:36,747
I'd do the same thing.

54
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,380
'Cause you still don't understand
how the city works, Jim.

55
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,135
You want to be a hero.

56
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,928
And Gotham doesn't need heroes.

57
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,846
It needs people
who will do what is necessary.

58
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,389
You're wrong. If you show 'em the way,

59
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,011
the people will follow.

60
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,060
I guess we'll just have to
wait and see, huh?

61
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,147
When your leave is up,

62
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,570
there'll be a desk here waiting for you.

63
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,655
Sit around, watch you all day?

64
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:03,441
No, thanks.

65
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,035
Right there's perfect. Thank you.

66
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,915
Beautiful.

67
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,588
I predict this evening's fundraiser
will be a smashing success.

68
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,173
If I want Gotham's wealthiest families

69
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,759
to support the orphanage,
things have to be perfect.

70
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,762
I appreciate you taking part, Oswald.

71
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:34,764
Yes.

72
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,401
- Sadly, a situation has arisen.
- No.

73
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,276
That thing in The Narrows
with your former chief of staff?

74
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,907
No, no. This is far more serious.

75
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,161
It has to do with Mayor Burke
promoting James Gordon

76
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,239
to captain of the GCPD.

77
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,699
You're not really
worried about James Gordon.

78
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:54,784
Please.

79
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:59,122
The issue is the person
who ordered his appointment.

80
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,915
- I see.
- Do you?

81
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,049
Oswald, we both know
the mayor is a weasel.

82
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,504
Someone must've paid him off.

83
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,262
But I don't see why that means
you can't attend my dinner.

84
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,223
Because, my dear,
the mayor has vanished.

85
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
But I will find him.

86
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,648
I will learn the name of my enemy,

87
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,275
and there will be a reckoning.

88
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,440
And that is why I might
not be able to make it this evening.

89
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,734
Very well,

90
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,119
but a few of the children
are doing a song.

91
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:32,705
Martin is taking part.

92
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,619
It would mean the world to him
if you could come.

93
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,034
Of course.

94
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,667
Now, don't let me keep you.

95
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,013
If you think she's the one,

96
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,718
we could have Victor talk to her.

97
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,138
You do realize she is

98
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,520
literally my only friend.

99
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,146
I need the mayor.

100
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:02,984
I need proof.

101
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,653
But, sir, what if Ms. Falcone,
not to say it is her,

102
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,822
has seen to it that the mayor
is missing, well,

103
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,778
permanently?

104
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,497
I could be chasing a ghost
while she prepares her next move.

105
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:25,633
I wish I had a spy close to her.
Someone quiet.

106
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,178
Bring me Martin.

107
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,259
Who?

108
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,969
The boy with the pad around his neck.

109
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,563
The one who can't talk.

110
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,076
I thought I was clear. We're done.

111
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,120
<i>Penguin suspects something.</i>

112
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,822
What are you talking about?

113
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,749
He was just here saying
that he couldn't come to the party

114
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,201
I'm having tonight for the orphanage.

115
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,707
He knows someone paid the mayor
to make you captain.

116
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,588
<i>I think he suspects me.</i>

117
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,000
- Have you warned the mayor?
<i>- I'm not a fool, Jim.</i>

118
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,801
I had him leave town
after your appointment.

119
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,383
Sounds like you have
your bases covered as usual.

120
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,469
Thanks for the heads up about Penguin.

121
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,179
Don't call me again.

122
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,308
This is Harper.

123
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,609
Gordon, line one. Says it's private.

124
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:30,648
Sofia.

125
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,028
<i>Wrong. Try again.</i>

126
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,284
You son of a bitch.

127
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,028
Attaboy, Jim.

128
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,780
Or should I say "Captain"?

129
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,873
<i>Congratulations, by the way.</i>

130
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,413
<i>So, do you remember when you said</i>

131
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,212
the rot in Gotham went from high to low?

132
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,214
<i>You've hit the nail on the head.</i>

133
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,334
Police were low,

134
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,262
and now it's time for Gotham's elite

135
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,093
to feel the pain.

136
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,017
Enter phase two.

137
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,766
I won't spoil the reveal.

138
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,057
Hurry outside for a little taste

139
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,851
of what's to come.

140
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,477
<i>Ciao, mon ami.</i>

141
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,073
He's outside. Let's go.

142
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,317
GCPD.

143
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,829
GCPD.

144
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,907
Make way. GCPD.

145
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,162
- Back up. Back up.
- Excuse me.

146
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,425
Are they dead?

147
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,672
Get forensics here.

148
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,429
And I want this whole area
closed off. No press.

149
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,802
That pig's eating that guy.

150
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,015
Now, Harper.

151
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,855
Excuse me. Excuse me.

152
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,111
Where's breakfast?

153
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,909
Breakfast was produced and consumed
by yours truly at breakfast time.

154
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,294
It is now a fast approaching
luncheon, Master Bruce.

155
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,834
Whatever. Just give me a coffee.

156
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,293
Enjoying the benefits

157
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,679
of another night out on the tiles
with Tommy Elliot

158
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,757
and his band of miscreants, are we?

159
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,267
How absolutely delightful.

160
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,105
I know what you're going through,
you know, Master Bruce.

161
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,390
Yeah?

162
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,897
I went out with my friends.
I'm hungover.

163
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,149
It doesn't take a genius
to figure it out.

164
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,859
You're lost is what you are.

165
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,650
I've seen that countless times
in young men.

166
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,531
Going off to war with a clear purpose

167
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,489
only to return home to a normal life,
unable to assimilate,

168
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,076
confused, angry.

169
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,242
And they make a complete tosh of it.

170
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,961
I don't really care.

171
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,758
You killed Ra's al Ghul.

172
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,468
Vengeance for your parents' death

173
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,295
has been your driving force for so long.

174
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,472
You are completely lost without it.

175
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:01,799
I need to call Tommy.

176
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,062
Have you forgotten what day it is today?

177
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,648
- Give me my phone.
- You have, ain't you?

178
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,600
Today is the day
my father took me camping.

179
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,356
We put a rock on top of Mount Bristol.

180
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,738
We did it every year.
Now give me my phone.

181
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,326
You are Bruce Wayne,
son of Thomas Wayne.

182
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,912
And the sooner you start
remembering that, the better.

183
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,964
So, you drink your coffee,

184
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,926
you go upstairs, you put your kit on
'cause you and I,

185
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,005
we're going for a walk.

186
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,348
According to the medical examiner,

187
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,401
both victims had been
living outdoors for some time,

188
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,818
most likely homeless.

189
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,236
Now, see these incisions.

190
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,773
He removed their organs.

191
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,734
- Any idea why?
- Not yet.

192
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,907
The Pyg all but announced
that his next victims

193
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,455
would be the rich and powerful.

194
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,123
The high in Gotham.

195
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,950
So why is he killing the homeless?

196
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,295
You are asking for logic
from a psychopath.

197
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,124
From him, yeah. Everything he's done
has been thought through carefully.

198
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,709
There was a card on the table in French.

199
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,094
It said, "Long live the revolution."

200
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,631
Maybe he's using them
to make a statement.

201
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,345
He wants the city's attention.

202
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,426
For what?

203
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,180
He said this is just a taste
of what's to come.

204
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,099
There's a piece that's still missing.

205
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,768
The homeless are densest in The Narrows

206
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,020
I'm gonna start there.

207
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,938
A hell of a first day to be captain.

208
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,230
Yeah.

209
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,736
Call me if you find anything else.

210
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,653
We checked all buildings
in the three-block radius, Captain.

211
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:46,862
Nothing.

212
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,118
All right. Widen it out
a couple of blocks.

213
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,451
Focus on buildings
with protected loading docks.

214
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,288
Captain, that was Lucius Fox.

215
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,126
Final tox came back.

216
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,210
Both victims had sodium sulfide
and chlorine residue on their skin.

217
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,511
He says it's common
in paper manufacturing.

218
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,014
There's an old paper plant
a few blocks from here

219
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,433
that closed down a while back.
Let's check that out.

220
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,688
Backup still incoming. Should we wait?

221
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:21,772
No.

222
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,442
Over here.

223
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,490
What is he doing to them?

224
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,746
Taking their organs.

225
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,751
A smoker oven?

226
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:45,963
He's cooking them.

227
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,616
Harper.

228
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,458
Drop the gun, Captain.

229
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,459
Shoot this bastard.

230
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,752
Drop it!

231
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:33,969
Thank you.

232
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:38,349
You found me too soon, James.

233
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:42,645
The table is not yet set
and no meal should be served

234
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,147
before its time.

235
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,068
You want a hostage? Take me.

236
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,151
No, no, no, no, no.
That won't do at all.

237
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,785
You must see my final act.

238
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,076
Along with all of Gotham!

239
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,805
Right. Well, it's a lovely day for it.

240
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,470
Best foot forward.

241
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:22,560
Very distinguished.

242
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,734
Sofia tells me you're taking part
in a performance this evening.

243
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,867
Well, she's quite a lady, isn't she?

244
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,158
She's been a friend to both of us.

245
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,411
Or has she?

246
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,243
Martin.

247
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:44,461
I worry Sofia is only
pretending to be my friend.

248
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,249
And worse,

249
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,672
I fear she may be using you.

250
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,468
Now.

251
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,809
I have been
running this over in my mind.

252
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,442
And there are two ways
this might have gone.

253
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:07,480
One, Sofia chose a specific orphan, you,

254
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,487
to place in my path. She groomed you,

255
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,613
she told you how to act.

256
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:14,986
Or,

257
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,912
Sofia simply
collected a group of children

258
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,744
hoping one would gain my trust,

259
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,542
and make me easier to manipulate.

260
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,635
In this version, you are innocent.

261
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,467
Martin.

262
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,347
This is the version
I very badly want to believe.

263
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:43,978
But I need proof

264
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,234
of our friendship.

265
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,820
I need to know
if my suspicions are correct.

266
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,903
And if so, what Sofia is planning,

267
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,529
and who she is planning it with.

268
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,453
I need you to be my eyes and my ears.

269
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,408
Do you think you could do that?

270
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,170
Don't let me down, Martin.

271
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,003
Please.

272
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,522
<i>I want a city-wide BOLO
on that van.</i>

273
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:28,189
I want every cop in Gotham
on the streets looking for Harper.

274
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,608
She will not be the Pyg's next victim.

275
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:31,855
- Go.
- All right.

276
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,236
- All right. Let's go.
- Let's go.

277
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,197
- Captain Gordon.
- Captain Gordon!

278
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,781
Captain Gordon! Captain Gordon!

279
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,580
Is it true that the serial killer
known as the Pyg is back?

280
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:44,126
That he's responsible for the scene
outside the GCPD this morning?

281
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,127
We believe so, yes.

282
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,706
We've also heard
he's kidnapped a GCPD detective.

283
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,590
How can you
keep the people of Gotham safe

284
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,793
when you can't protect
your own officers?

285
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,680
We remain hopeful
for Detective Harper's safe return.

286
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,381
Let me be clear.

287
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,801
The GCPD will stop this monster.

288
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,016
- That's a promise.
- And if you fail,

289
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,313
will you be pushed aside
like Harvey Bullock was?

290
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,396
We're done here. Thank you.

291
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,602
Captain Gordon!

292
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,655
What about the rumor that the Pyg
is now cooking his victims?

293
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:16,983
Who told you that?

294
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:18,652
Is it true?

295
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,161
As I said, the GCPD
will bring the Pyg to justice.

296
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,449
That's all.

297
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,711
Captain Gordon! Captain Gordon!

298
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,257
Someone leaked to the press
that the Pyg is cooking his victims.

299
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,425
Maybe it was the Pyg.

300
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,803
We know he wants attention.

301
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,260
Look, Jim.

302
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,054
Everyone in the department
is on your side.

303
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,598
Yeah.

304
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,272
There is something you need to see.

305
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,366
"I grant this food
will be somewhat dear,

306
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,407
"and therefore
very proper for landlords who,

307
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,831
"as they have already devoured
most of the parents,

308
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,456
"seem to have the best title
to the children."

309
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,627
It's Jonathan Swift, <i>A Modest Proposal.</i>

310
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,384
He made an argument for cannibalism
about the rich eating the poor.

311
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,837
The poor are the homeless.

312
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,463
But who are the rich?

313
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,014
Swift didn't just talk about
the rich eating the poor.

314
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,096
He specifically mentioned the orphans.

315
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,307
I know where he's going.

316
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,024
He left this for me.

317
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,819
He's doing exactly what he did
with Harvey. It could be a trap.

318
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,981
And I won't lead more officers
to their deaths.

319
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,238
- You're going alone?
- I'm sorry, Lucius.

320
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,205
Where's Chef Louis?

321
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,833
<i>Ici, mademoiselle.</i>

322
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,502
It's such a pleasure
to meet you in person.

323
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,635
I was expecting you earlier.

324
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,714
Apologies. I was detained.

325
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,887
But I've made
a small change in the menu.

326
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,477
I've steered us away from haute cuisine

327
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:11,390
to something a bit more mundane.

328
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:12,932
<i>Voila.</i>

329
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:24,695
I'm calling them Gotham meat pies.

330
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,456
Your guests will die for them.

331
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,629
I've made us a delicious
brown English stew

332
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,381
with herb dumplings, Master Bruce.

333
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,135
Your father used to love it
when I made stew.

334
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,144
Did I ever tell you
how I met your old man?

335
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,306
In London.

336
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,855
He was doing postgrad work there.
He told me.

337
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,072
Yeah, but no details.

338
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,368
Well, I was just out of the army.
Two months.

339
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,907
I don't remember any of it.

340
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,740
All a bit of blur, really.
Booze, drugs, brawling.

341
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,039
A sucking great black cloud.

342
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,089
One day I wake up
and I'm lying in this alley,

343
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,382
and I'm covered in blood.

344
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:20,960
Don't know how.

345
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,678
So, I picked myself up,
I took myself straight down

346
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,255
to the police station, turn myself in,

347
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,716
hoping that they would chuck me
into the big house

348
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,054
and throw away the key.

349
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,891
And they told me to shut up,
sit down and wait.

350
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,982
And there was this really annoying
Yank wandering about,

351
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,900
dressed like he's ready
for a game of tennis,

352
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,068
and it was your dad.

353
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,773
Anyway, he bowls up to me
and asks me what I'd done.

354
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,820
Asking me questions.

355
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,902
Eventually, you know,
I found myself telling him

356
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,868
stuff that I was too frightened
even to think about.

357
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,207
But I guess it'd just been building.

358
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,502
Anyway, at that point,
the desk sergeant called him over

359
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,545
and your dad turned around
at me, and he said,

360
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:00,799
"Alfred, last night, I was
being attacked in the alley.

361
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,210
"And you started fighting this geezer.

362
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,923
"I headed on my toes, and I ran away."

363
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,136
And I said, "Yeah, but that's not
what happened, is it, Thomas?"

364
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,344
And he says, "It is now."

365
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,648
Your father saved my life.

366
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,604
His friendship saved me.

367
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,111
You see, I know what
it's all like being lonely,

368
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,652
hoping that the world will punish you.

369
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:32,906
I can help you.

370
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,581
- Bruce, listen to me...
- Alfred, I hear you.

371
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,208
I just don't want
to talk about this right now.

372
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,628
All right.

373
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,344
Well, this looks lovely.

374
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,850
The rocks are gone.
They must've fell out in the car.

375
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,643
The keys are in the bag, just there.

376
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,968
- Beautiful.
- So nice to see you, dear.

377
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,048
- Thanks.
- Yes.

378
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,558
Oswald, you came!

379
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,476
Look at you two.

380
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,020
So handsome.

381
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,523
I know how important
tonight's party is to you.

382
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,146
And I wouldn't have forgiven myself

383
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,072
if I had missed Martin's performance.

384
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,526
Why don't you go
find the other children?

385
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,123
Did you locate the mayor?

386
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,580
Unfortunately, no.

387
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,829
But I've not given up hope.

388
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:04,998
Well, I, for one, am happy.

389
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,750
This way you get to come to my dinner.

390
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,421
I need to go check on the chef.
He seems a bit odd.

391
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,760
Please, try and enjoy yourself.

392
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:52,587
Hello, Martin.

393
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,132
What are you writing?

394
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:03,765
Don't make a noise.

395
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,153
I'm a cop. Who are you?

396
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:11,273
A waiter.

397
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:14,610
I'm looking for a man.
Caucasian, about five foot ten.

398
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,699
He would've brought the food.
Maybe the chef.

399
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,620
The chef's in the kitchen

400
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,665
Look, I just got hired tonight.

401
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,208
Whatever the dude's into,
I have no idea.

402
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,455
You're okay. You're okay.

403
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,836
Do me a favor.
Find Ms. Falcone, bring her to me.

404
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,459
- Can you do that for me?
- Yeah.

405
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:31,842
What's that in your jacket?

406
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:33,836
I don't...

407
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:43,055
Jim Gordon really is
an impressive policeman.

408
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,353
- Was he alone?
- It seems so.

409
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:47,643
But, man,

410
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,853
whatever it is you're into,

411
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:52,564
my partner and I,
our rates just doubled.

412
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,003
Harper.

413
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,807
Hi, friends. The Falcone orphanage

414
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:21,935
is the realization
of a long-cherished dream.

415
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,183
And one that
would have not been possible

416
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,932
without your support. So, thank you.

417
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:28,482
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

418
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,356
Now, if you could please
take your seats in the next room,

419
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,153
a few of the children
have prepared a song.

420
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:36,733
Where's Martin?

421
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,488
I wanted to wish him luck.

422
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,491
Ah. Off getting ready, no doubt.

423
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,415
Oswald, I've been thinking,

424
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,126
maybe things happened for a reason.

425
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,329
Licensing crime was a bold move,

426
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:51,255
but it would've destroyed you.

427
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,501
Whoever had Jim Gordon
appointed captain,

428
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,761
may actually have saved you.

429
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:01,141
By attempting to destroy
everything I ever created?

430
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,887
- Oswald...
- Enough!

431
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,058
If you're going to confess, confess.

432
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,723
And face the consequences.

433
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,236
So sorry to interrupt.

434
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:17,024
The servers are getting everyone seated.

435
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,818
We don't want the food to get cold.

436
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,778
Shall we go in to dinner?

437
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,198
Chop-chop.

438
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,666
All right.

439
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,669
I stopped the bleeding, I think.

440
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,964
That's the best I can do
until I can get you out of here.

441
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,808
I gotta get that door open.

442
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,806
- Gordon.
- Maybe I can get the hinges off.

443
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:46,886
Gordon.

444
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,556
Idiots forgot to search me.

445
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,247
Is this another one of your plans?

446
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:11,661
No.

447
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:17,960
Ladies and gentlemen,
as you by now have surmised,

448
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,340
there's been a change in the program.

449
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,850
Tonight we are proud to present

450
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:28,599
the six merry Gothamites
of Squatter's Row

451
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,057
and Martin from
the Falcone home and school

452
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:35,644
for orphans, in our rendition of

453
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:40,114
the meat pie tango.

454
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:42,401
Bob.

455
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,952
Fricks.

456
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:47,989
Trish.

457
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,163
Nunuh.

458
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,079
Cyrano.

459
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,206
Vincent.

460
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:02,629
<i>You have it coming</i>

461
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,802
<i>You have it coming</i>

462
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,434
<i>You only have yourself to blame</i>

463
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:12,564
<i>If you would've been fair
If you would've been keen</i>

464
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,771
<i>I bet you these pies
Wouldn't taste the same</i>

465
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,732
Enough! Where are the other children?

466
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,571
If you hurt them, I swear...

467
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,403
Rude, I'm not finished.

468
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,614
Sit down.

469
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:33,792
Pull it out,
and the next one's in her eye.

470
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:34,994
Oswald, no.

471
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:36,954
Don't.

472
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,427
Now, to answer your question, my dear,

473
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:47,382
the other children and your staff
are safely locked in the kitchen.

474
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,848
Despite appearances, I am not an animal.

475
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:56,145
Martin, may we continue?

476
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:03,486
You have all fed upon the poor
of Gotham for years.

477
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,192
Now, you're going to know
what they taste like.

478
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:10,614
Please open your envelopes
and look at the photographs inside.

479
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,500
Come on.

480
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,535
Open them!

481
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,013
Who is Trish?

482
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,724
Well, I thought you should see
who you are eating.

483
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:36,560
Bob, Fricks, Trish,
Nunuh, Cyrano, and Vincent

484
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,108
all deserve our gratitude.

485
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:42,229
So, these pies are...

486
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:44,773
People. Yup, they're people pies.

487
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,023
People.

488
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,994
And you're all going to eat them.

489
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,291
Absolutely not.

490
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:56,909
Okay.

491
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,082
Let's try this again.

492
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,166
No!

493
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,928
Eat, or I kill the boy.

494
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,756
But he's just an orphan.

495
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:13,718
What did you say?

496
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:16,764
Well, these are made of people,
for God's sake.

497
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,689
You can't expect us, I mean...

498
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:20,517
So they kill some urchin.

499
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,150
What a waste of a good pie.

500
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,075
But I do applaud the sentiment.

501
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,749
Especially, as you, Mr. Cobblepot,
are the reason I'm here.

502
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:39,168
Me? Why?

503
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:42,956
I could've chosen any gathering
of wealthy Gothamites

504
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:46,088
who've gotten fat upon the poor,
but you,

505
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,170
with your Pax Penguina,

506
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,673
you are the biggest glutton of them all.

507
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,467
You have gorged yourself
on this city's heart,

508
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,598
its lungs, its liver.

509
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:59,017
Why should today be any different?

510
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,563
Now, eat, little penguin. Eat.

511
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,645
Eat the pies or the boy dies.

512
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,765
If you don't all eat,

513
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:38,470
I will hunt you down and kill you all!

514
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:47,111
Now, that's what I like to see.

515
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,955
...and as mother always used to say,

516
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,628
"Nobody leaves
until every plate is clean."

517
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,874
It's a compliment to the chef.
And I love compliments.

518
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,586
And Ms. Falcone...

519
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:18,427
<i>Mangia, signorina.</i>

520
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,430
Only if you don't hurt him.

521
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,198
Can you help me?

522
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,494
Yes.

523
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,108
No!

524
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,743
He'll kill the kid!

525
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:18,903
Get off of me!

526
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:20,988
Martin!

527
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,699
Jim!

528
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,005
Get out of here!

529
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,840
Go!

530
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,716
Come on, Jim.

531
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,426
Don't give up.

532
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:26,099
You will ruin everything.

533
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:41,944
Should be better.

534
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,620
How is your hand?

535
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:53,914
I'll be fine.

536
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,332
How's Martin?

537
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,505
He's stronger than he looks.

538
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,809
You paid off the mayor
to make Jim Gordon captain.

539
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,095
Yes.

540
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,314
And you want me to believe
that you did this out of friendship.

541
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,528
To save me.

542
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,658
I tried to talk you
out of the license program,

543
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:21,860
you wouldn't listen.

544
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,779
There seemed no other way.

545
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:32,746
Of course, it's equally plausible
that you are my enemy

546
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,547
intent upon my destruction.

547
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,085
You could choose to see it that way.

548
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,170
The choice is yours, Oswald.

549
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:42,463
Well,

550
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,303
whatever your actual reasoning,

551
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,554
you went behind my back.

552
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,437
I would be justified in killing you.

553
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,901
But what you were
going to do for Martin,

554
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,238
that was real.

555
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,919
Don't ever betray me again.

556
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:17,373
Never.

557
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,336
I will abandon the licenses.

558
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,380
But Jim Gordon cannot be captain.

559
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:26,508
Pick someone else then.

560
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,262
Gordon's less than nothing to me.

561
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,569
Oh, my God, look!

562
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,946
- It's the Pyg!
- It's the Pyg!

563
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,527
It's really him.

564
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,453
Bye, bye, piggy, bye, bye.

565
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,826
- Captain Gordon!
- Captain Gordon!

566
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,036
- Captain Gordon!
- Captain Gordon!

567
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,042
- Captain Gordon!
- Captain Gordon!

568
00:36:58,967 --> 00:36:59,957
Is that the Pyg?

569
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,382
Did you really catch him?

570
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:05,258
The suspect known as the Pyg
is in custody.

571
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:08,683
Detective Vanessa Harper
is on her way to Gotham General

572
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,972
and is expected to make a full recovery.

573
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,143
The GCPD kept its promise.

574
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,810
Captain Gordon.

575
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:21,437
Yes?

576
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:23,105
Thank you.

577
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,940
Thank you.

578
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:54,599
Come on.

579
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,438
Hey, Alfred!

580
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:03,896
How was your walk?

581
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:06,194
Everybody out now.

582
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,025
Nobody move.

583
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:10,990
This is not your house.

584
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:13,914
If I want my friends to stay,
they're staying.

585
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:19,828
Like hell they are.

586
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:21,664
Dude, your butler
is a little out of line.

587
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,710
Have you been
hitting the sherry, Jeeves?

588
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:29,218
You have no idea what extreme danger
you are now in, son.

589
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,639
If I was you, I would walk away.

590
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:33,634
Yeah, whatever.

591
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,394
Meet us at the club.

592
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,224
Come on, driver will take us.

593
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,735
Well, you...

594
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,575
You certainly showed
a new side of yourself today

595
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,410
- haven't you, Master Bruce?
- Save it, Alfred.

596
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,670
You tell me a story

597
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,582
about you and my Dad,
and I'm supposed to get all weepy.

598
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,678
You don't know what I'm going through.

599
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,466
You and I are nothing alike.

600
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:15,384
Then talk to me.

601
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,472
Let me know how I can help you.

602
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:20,681
You can't!

603
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,317
Like you said, I did what I did.

604
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,400
I killed Ra's.

605
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,233
I avenged my parents' death,
and guess what?

606
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:34,695
Nothing changed.

607
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,413
It made no difference.

608
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,461
So then what did I do it for?

609
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,335
How can you help that?

610
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,592
I can help with the way
that you're feeling.

611
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,467
But you need to talk to me.

612
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,597
You have to face up
to who you really are.

613
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:03,057
Stop telling me who I am.

614
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:06,693
I know who I am.

615
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,281
And if you really want to help me,

616
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:15,661
you can stop trying to be my father,
and you can be my butler.

617
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,071
Clean this place up.

618
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,455
Tommy!

619
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,479
You're the hero of the day.

620
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:48,898
I was just doing my job.

621
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,776
I know you hate me for what I did,

622
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,277
but you deserve to be captain.

623
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:54,984
I went to your father for help,

624
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,697
I knew what I was getting into.

625
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,075
It doesn't mean I have to like it.

626
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:00,739
But you accept it.

627
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,202
Because I do deserve it.

628
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,881
Just like Gotham deserves law and order.

629
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,795
And I'm gonna make sure it gets it.

630
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,679
You don't think I want that, too?

631
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,225
I'm not your enemy, Jim.

632
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,427
I never will be.

633
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,223
Did you find anything out?

634
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,472
"I saw Sofia

635
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,143
"kissing the policeman."

636
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,314
Is this true?

637
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,395
Martin, you are a good friend.

638
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,019
As for Sofia,

639
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,736
she will answer for what she's done.

640
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,281
I swear.
