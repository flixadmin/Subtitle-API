1
00:00:00,184 --> 00:00:01,679
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,682 --> 00:00:03,937
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,130
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:07,140
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,143 --> 00:00:09,223
But secretly, with the help of my friends

6
00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:10,765
at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime

7
00:00:10,768 --> 00:00:12,789
and find other meta-humans like me.

8
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:15,209
But when my daughter came
back from the future to help,

9
00:00:15,212 --> 00:00:17,598
she changed the present.

10
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:20,195
And now our world is
more dangerous than ever,

11
00:00:20,198 --> 00:00:22,770
and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.

12
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,890
I am The Flash.

13
00:00:26,148 --> 00:00:27,536
Previously on "The Flash"...

14
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,270
Meet Joss Jackam.

15
00:00:29,272 --> 00:00:32,040
She's a delinquent teen
turned amateur storm chaser.

16
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:34,520
That weathervane, Doesn't
it look a lot like...

17
00:00:34,523 --> 00:00:36,110
The staff she was carrying, yeah.

18
00:00:36,112 --> 00:00:39,080
It's infected with a satellite shard.

19
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:41,349
Our satellite didn't
just create new metas.

20
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:42,583
It created meta-tech.

21
00:00:43,887 --> 00:00:45,620
Every time you vibe or breach,

22
00:00:45,622 --> 00:00:46,881
the dark matter is going to affect

23
00:00:46,883 --> 00:00:48,589
your central nervous system, causing you

24
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:49,906
more and more pain.

25
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:51,958
- We need to talk.
- Yes, Nora.

26
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:53,728
Yes, we do.

27
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,568
You've been gone a long time, Nora.

28
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,523
You're lucky I came back at all.

29
00:01:02,526 --> 00:01:03,638
Really?

30
00:01:08,845 --> 00:01:11,079
I can tell you have questions.

31
00:01:12,482 --> 00:01:13,748
Ask them.

32
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,687
- You killed my grandmother?
- I did.

33
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,323
- In front of my father?
- I did.

34
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:18,458
- He was a boy.
- Nora...

35
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:20,862
He was just a kid!

36
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:22,290
You're right,

37
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:26,027
and I think of that moment every day,

38
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:28,484
how it changed the course of destiny

39
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:29,886
for him,

40
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,455
for you,

41
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,958
for me.

42
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:35,595
I never knew he had that
kind of hatred inside of him,

43
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:38,238
but he does because of you.

44
00:01:38,241 --> 00:01:41,609
And I have that same
hatred inside of me for him!

45
00:01:43,613 --> 00:01:45,446
Or at least I did.

46
00:01:45,448 --> 00:01:48,916
I was inspired by him, as you are.

47
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:51,645
I wanted to know him, as you do.

48
00:01:51,648 --> 00:01:54,937
I wanted to be him. I
wanted to be the Flash.

49
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,741
You will never be the Flash.

50
00:01:57,744 --> 00:01:59,110
Exactly!

51
00:02:00,697 --> 00:02:03,965
And that realization is what broke me.

52
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:07,268
That's the realization that led me to do

53
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,736
the things that I did.

54
00:02:08,738 --> 00:02:11,973
The terrible, horrible,

55
00:02:11,975 --> 00:02:15,276
evil things I did.

56
00:02:15,278 --> 00:02:18,045
I've been coming here for so long.

57
00:02:18,047 --> 00:02:19,981
Why didn't you tell me what you did?

58
00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:21,516
I thought you must know.

59
00:02:21,518 --> 00:02:23,351
Your mother would've told you.

60
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,386
I was wrong. I see that.

61
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:29,757
I'm sorry, Nora.

62
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,692
I don't trust you anymore.

63
00:02:31,694 --> 00:02:34,228
Have I not given you everything?

64
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,064
The chance to go back and
know a father you never knew?

65
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:39,433
To learn from him? To run with him?

66
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:41,202
To run with the Flash.

67
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:45,239
I showed you how to
time travel because...

68
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:47,554
I want to help you.

69
00:02:47,557 --> 00:02:50,324
No, the only person that
you ever help is yourself.

70
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:52,027
Who told you that?

71
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,514
Your father?

72
00:02:59,122 --> 00:03:01,422
For as long as I can remember,

73
00:03:01,424 --> 00:03:03,758
all I ever thought about was myself,

74
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,234
and that will not be my legacy.

75
00:03:05,237 --> 00:03:07,527
That will not the
legacy of Eobard Thawne!

76
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,896
Let me help you!

77
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:13,521
I don't want your help.

78
00:03:13,524 --> 00:03:14,857
Not anymore.

79
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:31,284
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

80
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:33,621
So we've got some good
news and some bad news.

81
00:03:33,623 --> 00:03:35,890
The good news is that CCPD
is still stationed outside

82
00:03:35,892 --> 00:03:38,893
of Grace's room and will remain
so until Dwyer's been caught.

83
00:03:38,895 --> 00:03:40,761
But the bad news is,
that means Dwyer won't

84
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:42,201
be visiting her again anytime soon.

85
00:03:42,204 --> 00:03:43,464
And then the worse news is,

86
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:45,499
we have no idea where
Cicada could be hiding.

87
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:48,469
Can't we just track him by
the dark energy in his dagger?

88
00:03:48,471 --> 00:03:51,172
Well, we can but only
when he uses it, which,

89
00:03:51,174 --> 00:03:53,274
thank God, hasn't been recently.

90
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:55,142
And he's not showing up
on facial recognition?

91
00:03:55,144 --> 00:03:57,511
Unless he decides to make an
appearance, we've got zilch.

92
00:03:57,513 --> 00:03:59,580
Which reminds me, where
the rest of Team Flash is?

93
00:03:59,582 --> 00:04:01,647
Where's baby giraffe and young Nora?

94
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,718
Ralph's visiting his mom. He
said to call if we need him.

95
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,153
- And Nora is...
- Right here.

96
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:08,155
I just stopped by the loft
to pick up your blue suit.

97
00:04:08,157 --> 00:04:09,890
I figured you'd had enough of green.

98
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:11,659
Hey, I made that green
suit work, though.

99
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:14,120
What is, uh, that for again?

100
00:04:14,123 --> 00:04:16,062
Mama Cecile's first day
back to the courtroom

101
00:04:16,065 --> 00:04:18,099
and Dad's testimony
against Weather Witch.

102
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:19,867
Joss Jackam's trial is later today.

103
00:04:19,869 --> 00:04:21,402
It starts in 30 minutes.

104
00:04:21,404 --> 00:04:24,171
Well, since my dad is
with Jenna visiting Wally,

105
00:04:24,173 --> 00:04:26,507
why don't I come with you
guys and help support Cecile?

106
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:28,442
Yeah. When are they
coming back, by the way?

107
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:30,116
- They've been gone forever.
- Uh, he's not sure.

108
00:04:30,118 --> 00:04:32,580
After having a psychopath
break into his home,

109
00:04:32,582 --> 00:04:33,566
I don't think he's in any rush

110
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:34,969
to bring a newborn back to Central City.

111
00:04:34,971 --> 00:04:36,683
Besides, Cecile has a lot on her plate

112
00:04:36,686 --> 00:04:38,419
with this being her
first day back at work.

113
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:39,620
I can't wait to see Weather Witch

114
00:04:39,622 --> 00:04:40,821
get what she deserves.

115
00:04:44,394 --> 00:04:47,228
Hey, you ready to get those
shards out of your hands?

116
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,306
Hell yes!

117
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:50,730
I haven't been able to
play PS4 properly for weeks.

118
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:52,633
See you in there.

119
00:04:54,304 --> 00:04:55,603
Hey, you feel that?

120
00:04:55,605 --> 00:04:56,704
Feel what?

121
00:04:56,706 --> 00:04:58,806
That's the feeling of free time.

122
00:04:58,808 --> 00:05:00,875
AKA unbillable hours,

123
00:05:00,877 --> 00:05:02,877
so we better not be seeing
any invoices from you

124
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,045
in the near future.

125
00:05:04,047 --> 00:05:05,313
Oh, that's all right.

126
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:09,216
This is one mystery
I will solve for free.

127
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:32,340
The state versus Joslyn Jackam,

128
00:05:32,342 --> 00:05:37,378
Criminal Court of Central
City, meta-crime number 99512.

129
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,613
Welcome back to my
courtroom, Miss Horton.

130
00:05:39,615 --> 00:05:42,892
I trust your maternity
leave was enjoyable?

131
00:05:42,895 --> 00:05:44,227
Thank you, Your Honor.

132
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,153
I am very happy to be back at work.

133
00:05:47,156 --> 00:05:49,256
Yeah, there never really is enough time

134
00:05:49,258 --> 00:05:51,325
with a newborn, is there?

135
00:05:51,327 --> 00:05:54,028
There is not. You may proceed.

136
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,763
Thank you, Your Honor.

137
00:05:56,999 --> 00:05:58,599
The prosecution intends to prove

138
00:05:58,601 --> 00:06:00,401
that between November 20th and 27th,

139
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:02,837
Joslyn Jackam used this device,

140
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,402
a so-called piece of meta-tech,

141
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:07,139
to unlawfully and intentionally

142
00:06:07,142 --> 00:06:09,243
harm the citizens of Central City.

143
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:10,578
Her meta-crimes include

144
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,813
massive property damage at Iron Heights,

145
00:06:12,815 --> 00:06:14,949
the grounding of 21 separate flights

146
00:06:14,951 --> 00:06:16,183
at Sheldon County Airport,

147
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:18,219
and the attempted murder

148
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:21,856
of her own father, Mark Mardon.

149
00:06:21,858 --> 00:06:24,291
Now, this attack on her father was...

150
00:06:28,308 --> 00:06:30,408
Uh...

151
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:32,811
Uh, the...

152
00:06:32,814 --> 00:06:35,769
The attack on her
father was premeditated.

153
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:38,873
Um, and...

154
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,575
the prosecution is seeking the...

155
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,483
Are you okay?

156
00:06:48,486 --> 00:06:51,221
Uh...

157
00:06:51,224 --> 00:06:53,424
yeah, it's just a...

158
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:55,133
feeling.

159
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:58,159
I'll be fine.

160
00:07:03,398 --> 00:07:06,599
The prosecution is seeking the
maximum sentence, Your Honor.

161
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,975
Gotcha.

162
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,197
All right, almost done.

163
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,546
Micro-scale surgery is not the easiest.

164
00:07:18,548 --> 00:07:20,381
Is that why you missed
these the first time?

165
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:21,382
Hey, now!

166
00:07:22,518 --> 00:07:23,984
All right, there you go.

167
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,654
Your hands are officially
dagger shard free.

168
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:27,688
Hallelu.

169
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,889
One more thing.

170
00:07:38,534 --> 00:07:41,142
Mm, meta-sutures for meta-wounds,

171
00:07:41,145 --> 00:07:42,275
that's clever.

172
00:07:42,278 --> 00:07:45,012
Ah! Note to self, ice
healing actually hurts.

173
00:07:45,015 --> 00:07:46,739
Don't be a wuss.

174
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:50,678
Wuss. You're the wuss.

175
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,251
Looks like you've got this whole

176
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:54,214
Caitlyn/Killer Frost thing down pat.

177
00:07:54,217 --> 00:07:55,850
- Eh, not totally.
- I got it.

178
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:58,385
But it is getting easier
to switch to Killer Frost

179
00:07:58,387 --> 00:08:00,020
when I need to.

180
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:02,723
So those sutures should stay
frozen while the wound heals.

181
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:05,559
Once they melt, you can
take the bandages off.

182
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:06,759
You'll be good to go.

183
00:08:06,762 --> 00:08:08,863
I have to confess.

184
00:08:08,865 --> 00:08:13,067
I've actually really enjoyed
not having my powers lately.

185
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:14,902
- Really?
- Yeah.

186
00:08:14,904 --> 00:08:18,272
I got used to being Cisco
again sans Vibe-age, you know?

187
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:21,108
And not having villains
breathing down my neck

188
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,677
once a week, I have to
say, is pretty schway.

189
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:25,312
Well, if we're gonna defeat Cicada,

190
00:08:25,314 --> 00:08:27,081
we need a fully functioning Vibe.

191
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,550
So hopefully this does the trick.

192
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:31,185
Here, souvenirs.

193
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:34,021
- Oh, thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

194
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:40,561
Opening statements are underway

195
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:42,396
in the trial of Joss Jackam,

196
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:45,399
otherwise known as Weather Witch.

197
00:08:49,871 --> 00:08:51,070
Just saying, nothing wrong

198
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,840
with three or four martinis at lunch.

199
00:08:52,843 --> 00:08:55,256
It is when you get in
your Lamborghini and drive.

200
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:57,545
Sir, sir, focus here.

201
00:08:57,547 --> 00:09:01,081
Touch your nose.

202
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:08,988
Hey! That's my car!

203
00:09:12,161 --> 00:09:13,727
And then what happened, Miss Pellett?

204
00:09:13,729 --> 00:09:17,631
She created some kind
of lightning tornado.

205
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:20,042
I wasn't sure if any of
us were gonna make it.

206
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:25,031
I got to go.

207
00:09:25,034 --> 00:09:27,368
One moment, please.

208
00:09:29,378 --> 00:09:31,145
I got to go. There's been a car theft.

209
00:09:31,147 --> 00:09:33,113
What are you talking about?
You're my lead CSI witness.

210
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:34,648
You're on the stand in 30 minutes.

211
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,817
I'm sorry. It's a
Lamborghini, all right?

212
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:38,713
The cops aren't gonna be able
to keep up with this thing.

213
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:39,830
- It'll be quick.
- 30 minutes.

214
00:09:39,832 --> 00:09:41,788
- All right.
- Miss Horton?

215
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:48,971
Hmm, where were we?

216
00:10:14,256 --> 00:10:16,357
Guys, the car just turned north on 8th,

217
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:18,592
- headed towards Wakefield.
- Got it.

218
00:10:18,594 --> 00:10:20,361
Get ready to take control of the wheel.

219
00:10:20,363 --> 00:10:22,796
- What are you gonna do?
- Get the driver.

220
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,432
Here we go.

221
00:10:48,224 --> 00:10:49,289
Dad!

222
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,956
- What's happening?
- I can't stop vibrating.

223
00:10:57,588 --> 00:10:59,006
- Guys! We need your help!
- Guys!

224
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:02,891
- With what?
- With...

225
00:11:02,893 --> 00:11:04,457
With that?

226
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,759
I can't stop phasing.

227
00:11:05,762 --> 00:11:07,694
And I can't counter-phase him forever.

228
00:11:07,697 --> 00:11:08,842
Okay, that's not good.

229
00:11:08,845 --> 00:11:10,632
If you keep going but you don't,

230
00:11:10,634 --> 00:11:11,767
then you could...

231
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,068
fall to your death.

232
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,173
- Yeah!
- What are we gonna do?

233
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:16,703
- Let him.
- Uh...

234
00:11:16,706 --> 00:11:17,806
What?

235
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:19,375
Yes, if you phase through the floor,

236
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:20,979
you're actually gonna
fall into pipeline cell

237
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,015
directly below us.

238
00:11:22,018 --> 00:11:23,911
And the dampening unit
will negate your powers.

239
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:25,514
Unless we don't time it right.

240
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:28,550
In which case, your torso
would be severed from your legs

241
00:11:28,552 --> 00:11:29,868
as you enter the cell.

242
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:31,170
- Not helping.
- Stop, stop.

243
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:33,722
Okay, stop. I tr... I trust you Cisco.

244
00:11:33,724 --> 00:11:34,963
Move to the right.

245
00:11:34,966 --> 00:11:36,557
No, my right.

246
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,260
Cisco! Come on!

247
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:40,195
Okay, stop right there!

248
00:11:40,197 --> 00:11:41,830
- One step back.
- Cisco!

249
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:43,232
Actually, never mind, one step forward.

250
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:47,035
Okay, ready? Three, two, one, go!

251
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:05,954
What's going on with me?

252
00:12:05,956 --> 00:12:07,322
So...

253
00:12:07,324 --> 00:12:08,824
the car you touched

254
00:12:08,826 --> 00:12:11,960
was saturated with unstable dark matter.

255
00:12:11,962 --> 00:12:13,362
And because you were
phasing at the time,

256
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:15,097
it caused your body to destabilize

257
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:16,331
on a cellular level.

258
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,566
When I got close to the driver,

259
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:19,149
I saw dark matter veins flare up,

260
00:12:19,152 --> 00:12:20,953
just like on the back of
Spencer Young's phone.

261
00:12:20,955 --> 00:12:23,093
So the car is a piece of meta-tech?

262
00:12:23,096 --> 00:12:24,795
That or whatever was controlling it.

263
00:12:24,798 --> 00:12:26,475
How long is he gonna
have to stay in there for?

264
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:27,910
Without the help of the power dampeners,

265
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:30,045
it could take up to a day?

266
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:32,214
No, no, no, no! I-I have to
present evidence on the stand

267
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:33,582
in, like, ten minutes.

268
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:34,750
Cecile's gonna kill me.

269
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:37,853
- That's not good.
- Um...

270
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:39,254
I could do it.

271
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:43,358
You can't be serious.

272
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,726
Well, when Dad made me official,

273
00:12:44,728 --> 00:12:46,295
he submitted my paperwork to the court,

274
00:12:46,297 --> 00:12:48,702
so I'm qualified to
present forensic evidence.

275
00:12:48,705 --> 00:12:49,898
I can do this.

276
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:54,470
I cannot believe this is
happening on my first day back.

277
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:56,338
It's my first day back. Okay.

278
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,807
Go to the court reporter. Check in.

279
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:02,544
Tell her that Barry was
in a traffic accident.

280
00:13:02,546 --> 00:13:03,812
Yes.

281
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:06,248
And, Nora, when you're
up there on the stand,

282
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,683
you just follow my lead.

283
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:09,751
- Got it?
- Mm-hmm.

284
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:12,521
Don't worry. Nora can handle this.

285
00:13:12,523 --> 00:13:13,459
It's not that.

286
00:13:13,462 --> 00:13:15,690
I've decided I'm gonna
pursue a lighter sentence.

287
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:17,259
Why the change of heart?

288
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:20,329
Because I keep feeling these

289
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:24,066
waves of remorse coming off of Joss.

290
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:26,101
I think she just wants to start over

291
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:28,003
so she doesn't turn out like her father.

292
00:13:29,305 --> 00:13:32,406
So, Miss West, can
you explain what effect

293
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:35,410
these conditions had on
the Sheldon County Airport?

294
00:13:35,412 --> 00:13:36,979
The facility was hit by winds

295
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:40,483
ranging from 150 to 250 miles per hour.

296
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,585
Wow, that's... That is pretty dangerous.

297
00:13:43,587 --> 00:13:49,057
And yet not a single person was injured.

298
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:51,026
Well, no, but that was because...

299
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:52,961
What about these lightning
marks on the tarmac?

300
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:55,330
Would you say that that is common,

301
00:13:55,332 --> 00:13:57,099
given the nature of the weather

302
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:58,500
during the incident in question?

303
00:13:58,502 --> 00:14:00,936
Yes, but luckily, in this case,

304
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:02,337
the lightning only hit the runway

305
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:03,872
and not the surrounding structures.

306
00:14:03,874 --> 00:14:06,742
The structures where all
of the passengers were.

307
00:14:06,744 --> 00:14:10,445
I would say that is pretty lucky indeed.

308
00:14:11,448 --> 00:14:13,882
Your Honor, the prosecution rests.

309
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:16,885
So that's it? You're not
gonna ask me anything else?

310
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:23,458
Well, it would appear so.

311
00:14:24,862 --> 00:14:27,195
Mr. Lee, I think you're up.

312
00:14:32,403 --> 00:14:35,837
Miss West, is my client a meta-human?

313
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,431
No, but she used meta-tech.

314
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:39,875
Specifically a weather staff

315
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:42,711
that was corrupted by dark matter.

316
00:14:42,713 --> 00:14:46,944
So one could say it was
the staff, not my client,

317
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:49,248
that attacked the Sheldon
County Airport that night?

318
00:14:49,251 --> 00:14:53,021
No, one couldn't. She used that staff.

319
00:14:53,023 --> 00:14:55,390
But isn't this just an
ordinary weather staff

320
00:14:55,392 --> 00:14:56,691
corrupted by dark matter?

321
00:14:56,692 --> 00:14:58,660
These are your words.

322
00:14:58,662 --> 00:15:00,429
- Yes, but...
- And since dark matter

323
00:15:00,431 --> 00:15:01,830
was able to corrupt a tool

324
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:03,886
and turn it into a
weapon of destruction,

325
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:06,623
isn't it also possible it
could corrupt the defendant?

326
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:09,237
No. Dark matter doesn't
make you do things.

327
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:12,491
She pointed lightning at a
hangar full of scared families.

328
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:15,477
Your Honor, there were
little kids in that hangar.

329
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:17,813
Did you know that... that
lightning is five times hotter

330
00:15:17,815 --> 00:15:19,414
than the surface of the sun?

331
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,584
That is the kind of power
that the defendant unleashed

332
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:23,952
upon those people.

333
00:15:23,954 --> 00:15:26,121
She did this.

334
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:28,790
This was her choice,
and she can't be trusted.

335
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:30,756
No, Miss West, you must sit down.

336
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:31,994
I know, but, Your Honor...

337
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:34,329
- Sit down!
- No! She's right.

338
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:36,098
I'm guilty,

339
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,266
and I should pay for what I did.

340
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:47,442
- What you doing?
- Get a load of this.

341
00:15:47,444 --> 00:15:48,744
You know those shards you removed?

342
00:15:48,746 --> 00:15:50,479
I ran a biochemical analysis on them

343
00:15:50,481 --> 00:15:51,858
and the tissue from my hands.

344
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:53,148
You know how to do that?

345
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,617
I picked up a thing or
two from Caitlin Snow MD

346
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:59,454
over the years, and I found this.

347
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:03,303
That's my tissue right
after I got sliced.

348
00:16:03,306 --> 00:16:04,960
Mm-hmm.

349
00:16:04,962 --> 00:16:06,528
That's from today.

350
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,664
Almost all the dark matter is gone.

351
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,732
The shards weren't dampening my powers.

352
00:16:10,734 --> 00:16:12,200
They were removing them.

353
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:14,703
So the dagger has
anti-dark matter properties.

354
00:16:14,705 --> 00:16:15,689
Yes!

355
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:17,738
Cisco, if we can synthesize
that into a serum,

356
00:16:17,741 --> 00:16:20,142
we could get rid of
Cicada's powers entirely.

357
00:16:20,144 --> 00:16:22,544
And not just his powers, everyone's.

358
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:24,913
- Everyone's?
- Caitlyn,

359
00:16:24,915 --> 00:16:27,649
we could make a meta-human cure.

360
00:16:28,686 --> 00:16:31,353
You think we need a meta-human cure?

361
00:16:31,355 --> 00:16:32,688
Don't you?

362
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,923
Um...

363
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:36,373
Okay, maybe not.

364
00:16:36,376 --> 00:16:39,209
But I seem to remember
a time when you did?

365
00:16:39,212 --> 00:16:41,363
Sure, when I first
discovered Killer Frost,

366
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:42,986
I wanted to get rid of her.

367
00:16:42,989 --> 00:16:47,235
But when she was gone, it felt
like a piece of me was missing.

368
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:50,238
Besides, we have seen meta-human powers

369
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,107
do really good things.

370
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:54,776
Okay, yeah! If you
can build an ice bridge

371
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:56,378
to avoid rush hour traffic,

372
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,648
but what if my existence
gives everyone around me

373
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,584
radiation poisoning like "Fallout"?

374
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:05,387
Those metas, we created
them against their will.

375
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:07,723
No, Thawne created the
particle accelerator

376
00:17:07,725 --> 00:17:09,111
and he sabotaged it.

377
00:17:09,114 --> 00:17:11,226
And who shattered the
satellite full of dark matter

378
00:17:11,228 --> 00:17:13,228
and created God knows how many metas?

379
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,529
We did that.

380
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:18,400
This cure could give
meta-humans a second chance

381
00:17:18,402 --> 00:17:19,901
at having a normal life.

382
00:17:19,903 --> 00:17:22,904
Maybe not everyone wants
a normal life, Cisco.

383
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:50,766
Watch out!

384
00:18:02,346 --> 00:18:03,945
Who does this lady think she is?

385
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,590
What the hell?

386
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:33,108
Who are you?

387
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,811
Your ride. Let's go.

388
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,028
So Joss Jackam never
made it to Iron Heights.

389
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:43,597
Nope, and the transport driver said

390
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,166
that the woman who
took her used something

391
00:18:45,168 --> 00:18:47,096
that completely shut down his truck.

392
00:18:47,098 --> 00:18:48,331
Pause.

393
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,533
That. Look familiar?

394
00:18:50,535 --> 00:18:52,335
Ugh, another piece of satellite shard.

395
00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:54,070
So the fob is the meta-tech?

396
00:18:54,072 --> 00:18:56,138
Yeah, probably sends out
some kind of dark matter pulse

397
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,274
that overrides any
guidance system in seconds.

398
00:18:58,276 --> 00:18:59,909
So as long as she has an engine,

399
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:01,277
she can control it and we still

400
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,778
don't even know who we're looking for.

401
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:07,249
Maybe we do. Hey, can you fast-forward?

402
00:19:07,251 --> 00:19:08,651
Stop.

403
00:19:08,653 --> 00:19:11,908
Yeah, look, that salute.
She's definitely military.

404
00:19:11,911 --> 00:19:15,358
Okay, let's run that face
through the DOD database.

405
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:20,277
Raya Van Zandt.

406
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,142
Former air force, ace pilot, mechanic,

407
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:25,622
and expert in vehicle operations.

408
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,436
She was dishonorably discharged.

409
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:31,173
Call sign was Silver Ghost. Huh?

410
00:19:31,175 --> 00:19:34,142
The rest of her military
record was sealed.

411
00:19:34,145 --> 00:19:36,245
Okay, well, I'm gonna see
if my dad can call in a favor

412
00:19:36,247 --> 00:19:37,346
and maybe we can get a copy.

413
00:19:37,348 --> 00:19:38,387
Yeah, and in the meantime,

414
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:40,915
it looks like we have two
bad girls to track down.

415
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:42,685
I'm not so sure, Nora.

416
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:45,488
I mean, Cecile said that
she could feel Joss' remorse.

417
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,490
Come on, Mom. That was a show.

418
00:19:47,492 --> 00:19:50,059
I mean, do you think this
escape was a coincidence?

419
00:19:50,061 --> 00:19:51,861
Uh, well, we don't know yet, Nora.

420
00:19:51,863 --> 00:19:52,793
Yes, we do.

421
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:55,337
Raya got that fob to break Joss
out of the prison transport.

422
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,266
I guarantee you Joss is a part of this.

423
00:19:57,268 --> 00:19:58,280
How do you know that?

424
00:19:58,283 --> 00:20:00,316
Because bad people don't change.

425
00:20:04,175 --> 00:20:05,541
Hey, guys, any way

426
00:20:05,543 --> 00:20:07,877
you could send down some food?

427
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:12,982
Welcome to home base.

428
00:20:12,984 --> 00:20:14,583
Home base of what?

429
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:16,118
The Young Rogues.

430
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,387
There's been enough old
men running this town.

431
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:19,622
Our turn.

432
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,857
I have my eyes on a few candidates,

433
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:24,827
but for this job, plan on
it just being you and me.

434
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:27,463
Um, I'm not planning anything!

435
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:30,500
I don't even know who you
are! Just take me back!

436
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:35,404
You ever heard of A.R.G.U.S.?

437
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:38,874
It's an off-the-grid facility
primed with bleeding-edge tech,

438
00:20:38,876 --> 00:20:40,409
and it's protected by one

439
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:43,913
of the most advanced
security systems on Earth.

440
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:46,582
The only thing that can short it out is

441
00:20:46,584 --> 00:20:49,151
a billion jolts of electricity.

442
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:52,388
So a few bolts of lightning.

443
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,890
You're the Weather Witch, right?

444
00:20:54,892 --> 00:20:58,928
Beneath this wall is the
facility's power junction.

445
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:02,531
You hit that and we
have a four-minute window

446
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:06,335
to get something that
will make us unstoppable.

447
00:21:06,337 --> 00:21:09,238
No, look, even if I was gonna help you,

448
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,573
and I'm not,

449
00:21:10,575 --> 00:21:12,341
I need my weather staff
to control any of that,

450
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:13,743
and right now, that is in police holdup.

451
00:21:13,745 --> 00:21:16,345
So if you could just take me back.

452
00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:19,889
Okay.

453
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,085
To do what?

454
00:21:24,155 --> 00:21:25,955
Turn myself in.

455
00:21:25,957 --> 00:21:28,023
I see.

456
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:29,892
You don't want to be like your dad.

457
00:21:29,894 --> 00:21:32,161
I get that, but it's too late.

458
00:21:32,163 --> 00:21:35,431
You're a criminal. So am I.

459
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:37,299
And those people out there,

460
00:21:37,301 --> 00:21:40,559
trust me, all they think is,
"Like father, like daughter."

461
00:21:40,562 --> 00:21:42,738
But I guess you need to
find that out for yourself,

462
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,039
don't you?

463
00:21:48,212 --> 00:21:49,578
Find me when you do.

464
00:21:59,023 --> 00:22:00,089
Thank you.

465
00:22:00,091 --> 00:22:01,957
- Well... right.
- Yeah.

466
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:05,895
That will hold you
until you get out... oh!

467
00:22:08,007 --> 00:22:09,331
Uh, can I ask you a question?

468
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,733
Uh, do you have a minute?

469
00:22:10,735 --> 00:22:12,034
Yeah.

470
00:22:12,036 --> 00:22:13,669
Yes, you're not going anywhere.

471
00:22:13,671 --> 00:22:17,139
So, um, last year, you
came out of the Speed Force

472
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:20,743
and you were writing a
kind of a symbol language.

473
00:22:20,745 --> 00:22:21,715
Do you remember that?

474
00:22:21,718 --> 00:22:23,856
- Yeah, I remember.
- And apparently,

475
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:27,325
Cisco could only translate
one of these phrases. Right?

476
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,590
So far, yeah. I mean,
Gideon couldn't even do it.

477
00:22:30,755 --> 00:22:32,421
Gideon.

478
00:22:32,423 --> 00:22:34,089
Right, Gideon.

479
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:36,258
So what do you think that language was?

480
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,628
I don't know. It was some
kind of, uh, chronolinguistics.

481
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,463
Chronolinguistics that
you got from your time

482
00:22:41,465 --> 00:22:43,495
in the Speed Force, which
is all time at once, right?

483
00:22:43,497 --> 00:22:44,800
Past, present, future.

484
00:22:44,802 --> 00:22:46,802
What do you think this
language was? Future, maybe?

485
00:22:46,804 --> 00:22:49,605
Why? Is this about Cicada?

486
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:54,028
Cicada? No, no. No, It's just, um...

487
00:22:54,031 --> 00:22:55,530
le mystère, huh?

488
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:57,513
I'm a detective. I see
mystery everywhere, so...

489
00:22:57,515 --> 00:22:59,782
- Uh-huh.
- Uh, all right. Thank you.

490
00:22:59,784 --> 00:23:01,050
See you next time.

491
00:23:01,052 --> 00:23:04,053
Okay... oh! Ah, before I forget,

492
00:23:04,055 --> 00:23:07,089
the Legends, uh, dropped
off some, um, books

493
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:08,390
to help you pass the time.

494
00:23:08,392 --> 00:23:11,360
- Huh.
- "Uncaged Desire."

495
00:23:11,362 --> 00:23:13,162
Your kind of caged desire.

496
00:23:13,164 --> 00:23:15,197
- Hope you enjoy it.
- Huh.

497
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:16,966
- See you next time.
- Thanks.

498
00:23:16,968 --> 00:23:18,901
Yeah, probably not very good.

499
00:23:18,903 --> 00:23:20,402
See you!

500
00:23:23,608 --> 00:23:24,973
What is it?

501
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:28,076
According to Doppler, it's
a hurricane in Central City.

502
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,046
No, it's not a hurricane. It's Joss.

503
00:23:31,731 --> 00:23:32,959
I'm on it.

504
00:23:40,358 --> 00:23:41,700
What, no Flash today?

505
00:23:41,703 --> 00:23:44,437
Figured he wasn't needed
to stop a fake hurricane.

506
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,564
Guess we can add
damaging private property

507
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:50,132
to your résumé.

508
00:23:50,134 --> 00:23:51,300
Look, I just need your help.

509
00:23:51,302 --> 00:23:53,369
Oh, stop with the sorry act.

510
00:23:53,371 --> 00:23:55,509
That ended when your
friend helped you escape.

511
00:23:55,512 --> 00:23:58,941
She is not my buddy,
and I did not escape.

512
00:23:59,877 --> 00:24:01,443
Look,

513
00:24:01,445 --> 00:24:02,978
I want to turn myself back in.

514
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,680
Oh, you really expect
me to believe that?

515
00:24:04,682 --> 00:24:07,750
My dad is the career criminal,

516
00:24:07,752 --> 00:24:09,051
not me.

517
00:24:09,053 --> 00:24:11,086
I just...

518
00:24:12,262 --> 00:24:13,610
I want to show everybody

519
00:24:13,613 --> 00:24:16,224
that I'm not the person
that they think I am.

520
00:24:16,227 --> 00:24:17,926
Then what do you need me for?

521
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:18,981
You're a hero.

522
00:24:18,984 --> 00:24:20,283
If you vouch for me,

523
00:24:20,286 --> 00:24:22,897
people will know that
I'm telling the truth.

524
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,135
Look, I will tell you everything.

525
00:24:26,137 --> 00:24:28,537
I'll even show you
where that woman took me.

526
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:33,642
Just give me a chance.

527
00:24:38,616 --> 00:24:41,676
If anyone asks, you never saw this.

528
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,052
Thank you, Major Morgan.

529
00:24:43,054 --> 00:24:44,119
Please tell the lieutenant general

530
00:24:44,121 --> 00:24:45,387
that my dad and I owe him one.

531
00:24:50,014 --> 00:24:52,560
Special delivery. One Weather Witch.

532
00:24:52,563 --> 00:24:55,331
What? I thought you were gonna help me.

533
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,732
I'm trying to turn myself in.

534
00:24:56,734 --> 00:25:00,145
No, I-I didn't escape.
I-I was kidnapped.

535
00:25:00,148 --> 00:25:01,370
Will you please tell them?

536
00:25:01,372 --> 00:25:03,872
Sorry, I don't trust criminals.

537
00:25:03,874 --> 00:25:05,741
She's all yours.

538
00:25:05,743 --> 00:25:08,708
No! No, no! This is a misunderstanding!

539
00:25:08,711 --> 00:25:10,045
This is unfair!

540
00:25:10,047 --> 00:25:12,314
If I could just talk to her, please!

541
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,164
Your father does the exact same thing.

542
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:30,367
When something's on his mind, he runs.

543
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:32,869
Nothing's on my mind, Mom.

544
00:25:32,871 --> 00:25:35,340
I got to take a look at
Raya Van Zandt's DOD file.

545
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:37,007
Oh, yeah, did you find the connection

546
00:25:37,009 --> 00:25:38,308
between her and Joss?

547
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:41,478
Well, there doesn't seem to be one.

548
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,512
Really?

549
00:25:42,514 --> 00:25:44,915
Yeah, she left the air force

550
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:47,083
after a failed mission overseas,

551
00:25:47,085 --> 00:25:49,886
and then she spent two
months on desk duty,

552
00:25:49,888 --> 00:25:52,789
and then she was
dishonorably discharged.

553
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:57,360
But it seems like she has a
pretty good service record.

554
00:25:57,362 --> 00:26:00,197
Exactly, so clearly the
DOD had egg on its face

555
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:02,116
and Raya became its scapegoat.

556
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,590
I'm just saying, Nora,

557
00:26:03,593 --> 00:26:05,502
not everyone is as bad as they seem.

558
00:26:05,504 --> 00:26:10,173
Raya, Joss. I think everyone
deserves a second chance.

559
00:26:10,175 --> 00:26:12,709
If you don't believe
me, ask your father.

560
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:15,412
He gives more second chances
than anyone I've ever met.

561
00:26:22,222 --> 00:26:25,923
Come on. Come on.

562
00:26:28,426 --> 00:26:33,028
Yes. Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

563
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:37,167
Yes!

564
00:26:50,057 --> 00:26:51,419
What the hell are you doing?

565
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,817
What the hell are you doing?

566
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:56,820
Well, I was distilling dark matter ore

567
00:26:56,822 --> 00:26:58,288
from Cicada's dagger shards.

568
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,357
But I can't really do
that anymore, can I?

569
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,391
Whoops.

570
00:27:01,393 --> 00:27:02,826
Why did you do that?

571
00:27:02,828 --> 00:27:04,866
You're smart. You can figure it out.

572
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:06,202
When are you gonna figure out that

573
00:27:06,204 --> 00:27:07,963
a meta-cure could actually help people?

574
00:27:07,966 --> 00:27:10,200
Listen, I heard all
about it, short stuff.

575
00:27:10,202 --> 00:27:11,801
But you know what? Caity and I,

576
00:27:11,803 --> 00:27:13,436
we're doing just fine,

577
00:27:13,438 --> 00:27:16,673
and so were you until Cicada
got all up in your head.

578
00:27:16,675 --> 00:27:18,866
Don't do that. This isn't just about me.

579
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:20,100
Oh, the hell it isn't!

580
00:27:20,103 --> 00:27:22,111
And... and you know what? I get it.

581
00:27:22,114 --> 00:27:23,713
He tried to kill you.

582
00:27:23,715 --> 00:27:26,283
You're trying to create
something that'll save us all.

583
00:27:26,285 --> 00:27:27,951
Yeah, I am!

584
00:27:27,953 --> 00:27:29,452
All of us!

585
00:27:29,454 --> 00:27:31,855
Barry, Iris, Nora, they have a family.

586
00:27:31,857 --> 00:27:34,190
Even you and Caitlyn have
your weird little family.

587
00:27:34,192 --> 00:27:36,059
But what about my family?

588
00:27:36,061 --> 00:27:39,329
I want a wife to grow old with.

589
00:27:39,331 --> 00:27:40,930
I want a kid.

590
00:27:40,932 --> 00:27:43,600
And I don't want them
to wonder all the time

591
00:27:43,602 --> 00:27:44,934
if their dad is in trouble,

592
00:27:44,936 --> 00:27:46,538
if he's even gonna make it home tonight.

593
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:48,738
Cisco, you don't have to
choose between having powers

594
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,973
and having a family.

595
00:27:49,975 --> 00:27:51,921
Yeah? Well, some of us do.

596
00:27:51,924 --> 00:27:53,890
I'm not the Flash.

597
00:27:55,247 --> 00:27:57,180
I don't want to be the Flash.

598
00:27:59,818 --> 00:28:01,418
I want to be me.

599
00:28:02,545 --> 00:28:04,175
A cure is the only way.

600
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:09,025
Or it was.

601
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:19,269
What?

602
00:28:19,271 --> 00:28:21,905
Oh, come on, girl.

603
00:28:23,842 --> 00:28:25,909
You're reading Mick's book?

604
00:28:25,911 --> 00:28:28,022
This is...

605
00:28:28,025 --> 00:28:30,612
surprisingly well-written.

606
00:28:34,386 --> 00:28:36,519
What's going on?

607
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:42,892
Just having a hard time believing

608
00:28:42,894 --> 00:28:44,928
some people can change.

609
00:28:48,924 --> 00:28:50,886
How come?

610
00:28:50,889 --> 00:28:54,303
'Cause after everything
that you've seen,

611
00:28:54,306 --> 00:28:56,740
don't you think that
bad people stay bad?

612
00:28:56,742 --> 00:28:57,882
Not always.

613
00:28:57,885 --> 00:29:00,733
When I first met Leonard
Snart, he was a criminal.

614
00:29:00,736 --> 00:29:02,879
Probably the worst criminal in the city.

615
00:29:02,881 --> 00:29:03,980
But I...

616
00:29:03,982 --> 00:29:05,202
You know, I knew

617
00:29:05,205 --> 00:29:07,116
that there was a good
person in there somewhere,

618
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,318
and look at him.

619
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,019
Turned out to be a Legend.

620
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,256
Died a hero.

621
00:29:13,258 --> 00:29:16,126
If he can change, anyone can.

622
00:29:16,128 --> 00:29:18,128
You really believe that?

623
00:29:19,131 --> 00:29:21,331
Yeah. I do.

624
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:26,436
What about Eobard Thawne?

625
00:29:30,142 --> 00:29:33,076
I think...

626
00:29:33,078 --> 00:29:34,511
part of being a hero

627
00:29:34,513 --> 00:29:37,414
is being able to see the good in people.

628
00:29:38,316 --> 00:29:41,818
So yeah, maybe someday in the future...

629
00:29:43,121 --> 00:29:46,756
even Thawne could change.

630
00:29:46,758 --> 00:29:49,926
Besides, if we don't believe in people,

631
00:29:49,928 --> 00:29:51,294
who will?

632
00:30:13,151 --> 00:30:14,484
Very funny!

633
00:30:19,624 --> 00:30:21,458
I got 595s!

634
00:30:25,363 --> 00:30:27,297
We got a lot of vehicles! Let's go.

635
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:28,998
Copy that. Suit up!

636
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,202
We've got multiple 595s
in our own parking lot!

637
00:30:32,204 --> 00:30:34,003
Get out there quick!

638
00:30:34,005 --> 00:30:36,072
Requesting more backup! We've got a lot!

639
00:30:39,911 --> 00:30:41,778
What are you doing here?

640
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:46,182
Doing what no one else
is gonna do for you...

641
00:30:49,788 --> 00:30:53,623
Offer you a second chance...

642
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:55,024
Weather Witch.

643
00:31:03,148 --> 00:31:04,348
That's it.

644
00:31:04,351 --> 00:31:06,270
That's where the power junction is.

645
00:31:06,273 --> 00:31:08,341
Give it everything you got.

646
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,129
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know, sir.

647
00:31:29,132 --> 00:31:31,898
But it knocked out security
grids 41 through 60.

648
00:31:38,706 --> 00:31:41,140
Ten years and $24 million later,

649
00:31:41,142 --> 00:31:44,577
the stealth automobile,
AKA the SAM, was born.

650
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:46,679
Rumor has it that
everything under its hood

651
00:31:46,681 --> 00:31:48,581
comes directly from WayneTech.

652
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,658
This is a $24-million prototype?

653
00:31:59,766 --> 00:32:00,998
What can it do?

654
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:03,161
Let's find out.

655
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:22,581
Is it Joss or Raya?

656
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:24,317
I'm guessing both
because someone just stole

657
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,118
a very expensive vehicle from A.R.G.U.S.

658
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,987
after a very precise lightning strike.

659
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:29,588
It's a next-gen prototype

660
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,999
with all the bells and whistles.

661
00:32:31,002 --> 00:32:33,592
If bells and whistles could
explode and murder people.

662
00:32:33,594 --> 00:32:35,094
And supposedly it's untrackable.

663
00:32:35,096 --> 00:32:36,015
So how do we find it?

664
00:32:36,018 --> 00:32:37,852
- We don't search for the car.
- We search for them.

665
00:32:37,854 --> 00:32:39,585
If Joss made lightning strike again,

666
00:32:39,588 --> 00:32:40,914
it means she has her staff.

667
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,068
Oh, so we can track the
dark matter in it. Nice!

668
00:32:43,071 --> 00:32:44,503
I got the location.

669
00:32:47,108 --> 00:32:49,307
Okay, remember, Nora,
whatever you do,

670
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,781
don't touch the car
while using your powers.

671
00:32:51,784 --> 00:32:54,752
Hey, Caitlin, can I
steal you for a second?

672
00:33:11,432 --> 00:33:13,766
Joyride's over, Silver Ghost.

673
00:33:13,768 --> 00:33:16,635
Joss, I need to talk to you.

674
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:20,165
Hard pass.

675
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:41,694
Got to love remote detonation.

676
00:33:56,432 --> 00:33:58,244
Icy roads ahead.

677
00:34:02,283 --> 00:34:05,210
Oh, my God. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, Raya!

678
00:34:05,213 --> 00:34:07,179
Raya!

679
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:24,312
Holy Buckaroo Banzai.

680
00:34:24,315 --> 00:34:25,881
It phases?

681
00:34:25,884 --> 00:34:27,788
Whatever phase-trick they just used,

682
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:28,974
it jammed our tracking.

683
00:34:28,976 --> 00:34:30,209
We can't get a lock on them

684
00:34:30,211 --> 00:34:31,777
if she doesn't use that weather staff.

685
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:34,280
XS is gonna come after us.

686
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:35,581
Let her try.

687
00:34:44,592 --> 00:34:47,460
Hear no evil, see no evil.

688
00:34:47,462 --> 00:34:49,128
We're invisible.

689
00:34:53,267 --> 00:34:54,700
Hey, Cisco?

690
00:34:54,702 --> 00:34:56,635
Can you connect me to
the car's comm system?

691
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:59,338
No, but best I can do is
have you send out radio waves,

692
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,674
and if the car's nearby,
it'll pick them up.

693
00:35:01,676 --> 00:35:03,075
Do it.

694
00:35:06,114 --> 00:35:10,416
Joss? Joss, it's XS. I
hope you can hear me.

695
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:14,186
You tried to tell me something earlier.

696
00:35:14,188 --> 00:35:15,921
You tried to tell me
that you wanted to pay

697
00:35:15,923 --> 00:35:17,857
for the crimes that you committed.

698
00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:20,092
You said you weren't a
criminal like your father.

699
00:35:20,094 --> 00:35:22,128
You asked me to give
you a second chance,

700
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,529
but I didn't listen.

701
00:35:23,531 --> 00:35:26,098
Now I'm asking you for a second chance.

702
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,568
Joss, this isn't who you are.

703
00:35:34,442 --> 00:35:36,375
Nora, the car's headed straight for you.

704
00:35:36,377 --> 00:35:39,145
I don't see anything.

705
00:35:45,086 --> 00:35:46,852
Nora, look out!

706
00:35:54,595 --> 00:35:56,788
How the hell did I lose control?

707
00:35:59,634 --> 00:36:01,767
Hey, hold on to me.
This is gonna feel weird.

708
00:36:06,507 --> 00:36:09,608
Well, at least we got their wheels.

709
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,843
What's left of them.

710
00:36:10,845 --> 00:36:12,912
Thanks for the last-minute rescue.

711
00:36:12,914 --> 00:36:15,581
- For the what?
- Icing up the road.

712
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:17,015
I didn't ice the road.

713
00:36:17,018 --> 00:36:19,184
What? Who...

714
00:36:26,788 --> 00:36:28,782
And...

715
00:36:28,784 --> 00:36:30,383
time! 24 hours are up.

716
00:36:30,385 --> 00:36:32,320
Okay, I double-checked with Caitlin,

717
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,487
and there doesn't seem to
be any unstable dark matter

718
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:36,056
in your biometric scans.

719
00:36:36,058 --> 00:36:38,058
Okay.

720
00:36:45,643 --> 00:36:47,133
Man, it feels good to be out of there.

721
00:36:47,135 --> 00:36:48,373
We definitely missed you, Dad.

722
00:36:48,376 --> 00:36:50,099
Sorry I haven't been able
to help with everything.

723
00:36:50,101 --> 00:36:51,638
Do we know where Joss and Raya are now?

724
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,772
No, we got nothing yet.

725
00:36:52,774 --> 00:36:54,040
But you were right about Joss.

726
00:36:54,042 --> 00:36:55,288
She saved my life.

727
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:56,824
If she hadn't iced over the road...

728
00:36:56,827 --> 00:36:58,878
But she did because
you connected with her.

729
00:36:58,881 --> 00:36:59,843
It's like Dad said,

730
00:36:59,846 --> 00:37:01,788
she just needed someone
to believe in her.

731
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:03,691
Sounds like you found
your own Leonard Snart.

732
00:37:03,694 --> 00:37:06,418
Well, time might prove
me wrong, but I think so.

733
00:37:06,421 --> 00:37:07,821
I hope so.

734
00:37:07,824 --> 00:37:09,629
I'm sorry I messed up
your first day back.

735
00:37:09,632 --> 00:37:12,225
It's all right, Nora.
There's always day two.

736
00:37:12,227 --> 00:37:14,029
- I'm happy you're back.
- Thanks.

737
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:15,731
Hey do you wanna help me find Cisco?

738
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,898
I gotta get this extrapolator
thing recalibrated.

739
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,401
I went to go see Joe in
Tibet, and I ended up in Fiji.

740
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:26,673
Being a parent sure is hard sometimes.

741
00:37:26,675 --> 00:37:28,942
Yeah, it is.

742
00:37:28,944 --> 00:37:31,745
But there's nothing like it.

743
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:48,728
Okay, well, we can't
both be the basket case.

744
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,297
"We're all pretty bizarre.

745
00:37:50,299 --> 00:37:52,732
Some of us are just
better at hiding it."

746
00:37:52,734 --> 00:37:54,200
Come on, "Breakfast Club"?

747
00:37:54,202 --> 00:37:55,502
It's one of the only movies

748
00:37:55,504 --> 00:37:57,257
Killer Frost and I actually agree on.

749
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,656
Let me guess, she's into Bender?

750
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:00,739
- Totally. She loves him.
- Yeah, makes sense.

751
00:38:00,742 --> 00:38:02,242
- I'd ship that.
- Put that on.

752
00:38:02,244 --> 00:38:04,744
It's cold where we're going.

753
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,452
Your dad's old lab.

754
00:38:12,454 --> 00:38:14,120
- Mm-hmm.
- Cool.

755
00:38:14,122 --> 00:38:16,656
Caitlin, why did you bring me here?

756
00:38:16,658 --> 00:38:19,492
Because despite our
last encounter with him,

757
00:38:19,494 --> 00:38:21,594
he did create a meta-gene.

758
00:38:21,596 --> 00:38:24,197
So I was thinking that
you could use his research

759
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:26,132
to do the reverse.

760
00:38:26,134 --> 00:38:28,559
Um, okay,

761
00:38:28,562 --> 00:38:31,471
don't look now, but if
I didn't know any better,

762
00:38:31,473 --> 00:38:36,943
I'd say this feels a
lot like you helping me

763
00:38:36,945 --> 00:38:39,245
make a meta-human cure.

764
00:38:39,247 --> 00:38:40,480
I couldn't stop thinking about

765
00:38:40,482 --> 00:38:42,582
what you said about how a cure

766
00:38:42,584 --> 00:38:46,786
would give you a second
chance at a normal life.

767
00:38:46,788 --> 00:38:49,389
No friend would stand
in the way of that.

768
00:38:49,391 --> 00:38:54,527
But there is a difference
between you standing in my way

769
00:38:54,529 --> 00:38:57,831
and you actively helping me.

770
00:38:57,833 --> 00:39:00,633
I still think this is dangerous, but...

771
00:39:00,635 --> 00:39:03,570
maybe if I'm involved, we
can have some ground rules.

772
00:39:03,572 --> 00:39:05,805
Like the first and most important,

773
00:39:05,807 --> 00:39:10,443
we will never, ever
force a cure on anyone.

774
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,847
Okay.

775
00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:16,383
Rule number one.

776
00:39:16,385 --> 00:39:19,853
We're not just here to make a cure.

777
00:39:19,855 --> 00:39:21,287
We're here to make a choice.

778
00:39:40,742 --> 00:39:42,308
Nora.

779
00:39:43,845 --> 00:39:46,513
You either trust me, or you don't.

780
00:39:48,417 --> 00:39:50,417
There's no in-between.

781
00:39:51,553 --> 00:39:53,620
Fine.

782
00:39:53,622 --> 00:39:55,871
I don't trust you.

783
00:39:55,874 --> 00:39:58,992
But I'm willing to give you
the chance to change my mind.

784
00:40:00,595 --> 00:40:03,430
Well, that might take some time.

785
00:40:03,432 --> 00:40:08,201
And time, as you may recall,

786
00:40:08,203 --> 00:40:11,137
is not on my side.

787
00:40:11,139 --> 00:40:13,206
Minutes are minutes,

788
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:16,342
seconds are seconds,

789
00:40:16,344 --> 00:40:19,345
and there's very few of them left.

790
00:40:27,656 --> 00:40:29,055
I want to believe that

791
00:40:29,057 --> 00:40:31,091
there is good inside of
you somewhere, Thawne.

792
00:40:36,231 --> 00:40:38,198
Let me prove there is.

793
00:40:44,331 --> 00:40:45,538
Okay.

794
00:40:52,481 --> 00:40:54,132
What's next?

795
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,978
Hello, Dr. Wells.

796
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:28,414
Hello, Gideon.

797
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:30,984
I have access to all the files?

798
00:41:30,986 --> 00:41:32,671
- Right?
- Of course.

799
00:41:32,674 --> 00:41:35,187
Which files would you like me to locate?

800
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:38,758
I would like you to locate the files

801
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,593
from Nora West-Allen.

802
00:41:40,596 --> 00:41:41,874
I'm sorry, Dr. Wells,

803
00:41:41,877 --> 00:41:43,795
but all entries have
been permanently deleted

804
00:41:43,798 --> 00:41:45,165
by Nora West-Allen.
