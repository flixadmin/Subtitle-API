1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,595
- Hey, come on, folks. Give us a break.
- Hey, back it up.

2
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,035
There's enough fire here for everybody,
all right?

3
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,673
What kind of pool is it?

4
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,331
Well, that's the beauty of it.

5
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,537
You get to pick the spot where El Flasho
makes his next appearance.

6
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:51,047
Come on.
You don't even believe he exists.

7
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,946
Of course I don't, but you do.

8
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,646
And so does every badge in Homicide
and Narcotics and Vice.

9
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,688
You could make a lot of money here.

10
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:01,156
I don't know, Murph.

11
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:06,521
That's the third barn burn
in three weeks.

12
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,267
Whatever's going to hell down here
is going up in smoke.

13
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:13,565
It's scandalous to let
the old gal go this way.

14
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:17,132
She was a real beauty in her time.

15
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,410
My husband used to work up there.

16
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:26,040
Back when they was moving hooch
through the back room.

17
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,914
That was a long time ago, though.

18
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,283
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

19
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:34,393
- What are you, some kind of goon?
- Just doing my job, lady.

20
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,530
Life ain't hard enough, huh?
So you wanna keep a record of it.

21
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,289
You never know what you'll miss.

22
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,404
Look, the kids up there
on the second floor.

23
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,676
So, Murph, when does that pool start?

24
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,025
Come on, guys, I'll get you out of here.

25
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:19,832
Thanks, Flash. At least somebody around
here knows how to rescue a kid.

26
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,681
Cross the fireman off my suspect list.

27
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,710
Why don't you go home, girl.
Ain't nothing more to see.

28
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,615
You didn't see him?
How could you miss him?

29
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,351
- He was standing right there with the kids.
- I saw a fireman with those kids.

30
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:45,624
But it doesn't matter. That's the beauty
of the Flash pool, it's reported sightings.

31
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,129
- What?
- Good evening, my dear.

32
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,892
I'm Officer Murphy. May I help you?

33
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:53,630
Not unless you can cut, rinse
and blow dry for under 35.

34
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:11,148
Well, that leaves one more possibility.

35
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,997
<i>Central City Police.</i>

36
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,764
Yeah, police lab. Barry Allen, please.

37
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,335
- <i>He's not in.</i>
- He isn't?

38
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,171
- <i>Any message</i>?
- No. No message.

39
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,881
And how do you look in red, Mr. Allen?

40
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,945
Hey, there he is.

41
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,519
Joe Klein, <i>Voice of the City</i>,
any comment on the state's allegations...

42
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,179
...about your illegal gambling
and racketeering?

43
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:56,923
The jury made my comment. "Not guilty."
I'm a legitimate businessman.

44
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:00,497
Does that mean that you didn't order
the murder of a State's witness?

45
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:04,763
You know, one of these days you're
gonna lose your voice, Mr. Klein.

46
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:07,804
And I don't mean by a sore throat.

47
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,702
Legitimate businessman?

48
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,572
Yeah, babe, and I'm Connie Chung.
You know what I'm saying?

49
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,508
What kind of district attorney
are you?

50
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,081
Simonson would've had more trouble
in traffic court.

51
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,515
Next time, have the police bring me a case
that will stand up in court.

52
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,884
Your guys couldn't even get their names
straight on cross-examination.

53
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:27,083
They were into their third straight
double shift when they arrested Simonson.

54
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,195
Simonson's running the riverfront
like his own private kingdom.

55
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,228
- Numbers, vice, extortion.
- You're right.

56
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:36,095
He's worse than his father ever was,
and you can't seem to make anything stick.

57
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,032
Well, I'm gonna nail him.

58
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,071
With or without the police.

59
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,616
Gum under the craps table.

60
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,619
Where were these people raised?

61
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,791
Go ahead, shoot the DA
in your illegal casino.

62
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,059
I'd like the movie rights
to that one, Arthur.

63
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,430
You shouldn't be here, Castillo.

64
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:15,370
Two of your bogus corporations just bought
the torched riverfront properties.

65
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,873
Why wasn't I told what was going on?

66
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,945
If we are making any allegations,
please, talk to my lawyer.

67
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:26,114
- I talked to your lawyer already, in court.
- I know. He walked all over you.

68
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:31,484
Arthur, it's an election year.
I need to win a few.

69
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:37,357
Well, I'll get someone to take a fall,
make you look good in the papers.

70
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,422
Can't afford to lose you.

71
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,623
Yeah, well...

72
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,770
...we need to talk about that too.

73
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:50,875
I need a better deal.
Our current arrangement is unacceptable.

74
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,968
Our arrangement is fine.

75
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,446
Haven't I taken care of you
since law school?

76
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,279
Go home, Tommy boy.

77
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:05,014
Having the DA around
is bad for business.

78
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:07,825
Right.

79
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,297
Sabrina's got this girlfriend.

80
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,594
She's young, she's hip,
she's single, she's perfect for you.

81
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,431
Yeah, like the last perfect one,
the one with the phobias.

82
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,507
- So she was afraid of spiders, big deal.
- Yeah, along with hats, fish, suitcases...

83
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:27,806
...and anything with fur. I'm too busy
with this arson case to worry about women.

84
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,881
Look, you get too caught up in the job,
and the engine just...

85
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,884
All right. Okay. So what's the word on that
metal scrap you found at the warehouse?

86
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,852
Fragment of incendiary fuse.
Asian, according to my analysis.

87
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,959
That only narrows it down to
a few hundred firework factories...

88
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,754
...between Seoul and Hong Kong.

89
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,159
- Can I help you boys?
- Mrs. Grosso.

90
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,425
- Yes?
- Hi, I'm Barry Allen.

91
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:53,402
And I wanted to ask you a few questions
about the fire on the docks last night.

92
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:57,100
Yeah, and I'm here to find a birthday
present for the woman of my dreams.

93
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,766
A romantic.

94
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:02,403
I remember when everybody
in this town was like that.

95
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,016
Now, about the fires.

96
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,550
You know, it's a miracle those kids
weren't hurt.

97
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,655
They don't have anywhere else to play
but outside there.

98
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:14,623
But we've got a contribution up
to replant Riverside Park.

99
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:18,463
Check it out, Barry.
Lights are low, she's on fire...

100
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,963
According to your statement...

101
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:24,959
...you saw all three recent fires.
- Saw them?

102
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,639
I almost burned around them.

103
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,640
But I was really worried
about the old cannery.

104
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,607
- The one on Angel Street.
- Yes.

105
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,542
You see, my second husband
got me a deed for it...

106
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:39,378
...and I was hoping that the developers
would buy me out...

107
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:42,112
...so that I could send my grandchildren
to school.

108
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:46,992
- But all these fires burning through...
- It's a love machine.

109
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,558
Julio.

110
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,892
Can you describe the blazes?

111
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:54,499
Well, at first it was a big burst...

112
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:58,967
...and then a lot of little fires
that break out all at once.

113
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,406
Isn't that suspicious?

114
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,369
That explains a lot.

115
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,973
Look, if you're gonna nix this date tonight,
I gotta call Sabrina.

116
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,277
Julio, I got arsonist records faxing in
from the capitol, all right?

117
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,386
Not till tomorrow.

118
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,782
Judith, huh?

119
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,552
- What did you tell her about me?
- That you're 4'8"...

120
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:27,495
...with a mug like a scouring pad.
What do you think, man? Just trust me.

121
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,498
I'm living proof of what love can do.

122
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,866
Yeah, but inhaling lab fumes
does the same thing.

123
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,802
My face is precious.

124
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:04,562
- First date, huh, buddy?
- First, double, blind.

125
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,034
- This one's on me.
- Thanks.

126
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,189
Baby, why take pictures
when you got the real thing, huh?

127
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,758
I'm flattered,
but I'm expecting my date any minute.

128
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:31,055
Doll face, bring me two of those
l-wanna-iguana cocktails...

129
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,790
...for me and my new
best girlfriend here.

130
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,163
I have other plans, but I'm sure
that girl in red over there...

131
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:41,363
...would love to have you buy her a drink.
- Sweetheart, you won the lottery tonight.

132
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,405
Hey, babe, come on, relax...

133
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:48,673
...and let me bring you
to the threshold of unearthly delight.

134
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,182
He slipped crossing the threshold.

135
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,488
Do you do this professionally?

136
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:06,490
Listen, if you wanna press charges...

137
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,626
...l'm a police officer.

138
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:14,830
And here I heard they were never around
when you needed one. Excuse me.

139
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,738
Hey, wait a minute.

140
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,607
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Hey, wait a minute. Excuse me.

141
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,911
What do you mean "wait a minute"?
We're not walking backwards here.

142
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,384
Hi, Barry.
Your mom pick that suit out for you?

143
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:33,321
This is my best friend from high school,
Judith. This is the guy I told you about.

144
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,225
Hi.

145
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:40,559
You've had a near-death experience.
I can tell by your aura.

146
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,130
My aura?

147
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,460
Would you excuse us a moment, please?

148
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,905
Be back in a second.

149
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,942
Julio, you're a dead man.

150
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,641
What the hell are you doing here?

151
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,947
Who would have thought you could get
that acrobatic in a motel room?

152
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:07,252
Feet off the desk, Mr. DA.
And those are confidential.

153
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:15,631
What about the job, Ms. Lockhart? You've
been tracking suspects for three months.

154
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,269
And I've been working for three months,
thank you.

155
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:22,498
Flash doesn't advertise. I've cross-indexed
every piece of data I could find:

156
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,872
News footage, reported sightings.
Plotted against demographic...

157
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:29,811
...and psychological profiles,
as well as random variables...

158
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:33,474
...like atmospheric disturbances.
You got your money's worth, pal.

159
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,788
This can't hurt your reputation any,
Ms. Lockhart.

160
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:40,392
He's obviously a concerned citizen,
and we have to know how to reach him.

161
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,289
And you'll be the one with his number.

162
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,929
Or won't this salvage
your re-election campaign...

163
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,090
...with your opponent slaughtering you
in the polls?

164
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:55,265
I don't plan on being district attorney
forever. What do you have for me?

165
00:12:56,275 --> 00:13:01,508
I've narrowed it down from a cast
of thousands to one front-runner.

166
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,045
But no names yet.

167
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,410
I still need hard evidence.

168
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,746
I'll have the man behind the mask
by Friday.

169
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,881
Fine, Friday.

170
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:31,565
Okay, Barry,
you're number one with a bullet.

171
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,716
Hey, I'm sorry, man.
She wasn't exactly your type.

172
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,186
- Not exactly?
- Sabrina thought you two hit it off.

173
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:49,054
Yeah, maybe if I'd been the reincarnation
of Joan of Arc or Flipper.

174
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:52,026
- Look, Sabrina's cousin...
- Yo, Julio, Barry-o.

175
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:56,567
We got a pool going here, the next spot
the Flash shows up, five bucks.

176
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:59,067
- I never win at those things.
- You never get in.

177
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:02,469
Put me down for the five you owe me.
I'll take Chinatown.

178
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,041
- Chinatown. You got it.
- All right, tell you what...

179
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,679
...pick Central City Park, man.
Another five bucks.

180
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,044
That's a good bet. You know,
you're at the opposite side of the city.

181
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,014
I got lucky there before. Why not.

182
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,382
Listen, you guys. Heard anything else
about that warehouse fire?

183
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,580
Yeah. You know, your hunch
was right, Barry.

184
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:22,454
That's right. Jamoe's cousin over at
the fire department confirmed it was arson.

185
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:26,257
- That's what I thought. Thanks.
- See you in a bit.

186
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:30,027
Hey, Barry. Don't forget Helltown's still
open, in case you change your mind.

187
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,370
Thanks, I'll remember.

188
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,909
From the FBI.

189
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:44,375
Look, you may be right. It says
that fuse is from a Saigon manufacturer.

190
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,485
What, we got a Vietnamese firebug
torching the dockside?

191
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,052
No, not necessarily.

192
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:53,590
This fuse was used during the war by a U.S.
Demolition team known as the Fire Lords.

193
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,691
Those guys could
start a firestorm during a monsoon.

194
00:14:56,862 --> 00:15:00,559
Wait, someone's paying top dollar
for a pro who trained with Uncle Sam?

195
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,531
Yeah, but who's making money
off these torchings?

196
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,206
Ladies and gents,
the royal creed from the kingdom of chance.

197
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:12,003
Twenty dollars buys you an invitation.
Find where the little lady is hiding...

198
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,771
...double your money.
Go ahead mister, pick a card.

199
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,676
I think he's got it.

200
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,681
Too bad. Maybe next time.
Try your luck again.

201
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:24,084
Here we go, once more.
Okay, pick a card.

202
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,817
Hey, what's he doing?

203
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:31,329
I don't think you quite got it, pal.
It's one card at a time.

204
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,331
Hey.

205
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,570
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Move along, folks.

206
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,669
Only winner in three card monte
is the dealer.

207
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:49,280
What kind of racket are you playing?
This is harassment to free enterprise.

208
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,815
Come on, you got along fine
with my father and brother.

209
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,511
I'm Barry Allen.

210
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,048
- You're Henry's younger boy.
- Yeah.

211
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,054
Yeah.

212
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,987
I was real sorry to hear about Jay.
He was okay.

213
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:09,427
Listen, I need a little help, okay?

214
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:12,092
I'd like anything you got
on fires on the wharf.

215
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,096
I could use a little down payment.

216
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,299
- How about I don't bust you for fraud?
- Okay, okay.

217
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,070
Tell me one thing.
How'd you pull that little gag before?

218
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,975
I'd already palmed the queen
in the first place.

219
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,680
TV magic cards when I was a kid.

220
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,443
Call me with anything.

221
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,289
<i>Witnesses say they saw a red blur.</i>

222
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,991
<i>Makes the fourth time</i>
<i>this month this mysterious</i>...

223
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,442
Star Lab.

224
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,157
Star Labs' van again.

225
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,987
What do they have to do
with the Flash?

226
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,533
Sherry, can you come in here, please?

227
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:29,204
Okay, there's a couple of things.
If Dr. Carter Hall calls...

228
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,781
...can you tell him I'll be in
the gene-splicing lab?

229
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,942
- I just have to find something to write on.
- Sherry?

230
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,953
Sherry had like a...
You know, a female thing.

231
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,686
- I'm the New York City College intern.
- No problem.

232
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,831
- Heather.
- Yes, of course.

233
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,367
Okay, that's Dr. Carter.

234
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:56,304
Sorry. I'm really sorry.
It's just that I don't have a pen.

235
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,636
I'm sorry.
It's just that I didn't have a pen.

236
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,245
Never mind. Just hold my calls.

237
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:06,316
Okay. Great. I mean, anything that you
need, because I really need this job.

238
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:11,184
Especially after the last one. Who knew
those chemicals would be so volatile?

239
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,056
Listen, just hold my calls.

240
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,593
- "Hold my calls."
- And don't touch anything.

241
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,664
- "Don't touch anything."
- Please.

242
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,164
"Please."

243
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,752
Following the Flash around, eh, McGee?

244
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,888
Hyperkinetic field studies.

245
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,863
Still waters do run deep, Dr. McGee.

246
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:58,935
Or at the very least, classified.

247
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,698
You didn't talk that way
to my father.

248
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,308
And unless you want to lose a hand...

249
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,335
...you won't take that tone with me.

250
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:15,643
Mr. Spanier. Again, a pleasure.
Wonderful work, just wonderful.

251
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,647
I take no pleasure from my calling, sir.

252
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,993
Can a man take fire
in his bosom and clothes not be burned?

253
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,394
Yeah, right.
I've got big plans for the riverfront:

254
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,967
Hotels, casinos. All legitimate.

255
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,801
You see, I can't buy property...

256
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:38,272
...the city has put aside
for historical restoration.

257
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:42,612
But if it burns,
there's nothing to restore.

258
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,614
Our days on earth are a shadow...

259
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,386
...and there is none abiding.

260
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,480
Whatever you say.

261
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:56,356
Meanwhile, your next job
is the customs house off Bleaker.

262
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,640
What a way to earn a living.

263
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,588
Hey, big Earl. Look what I got.

264
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,093
Excuse me.

265
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:40,232
Just checking the cable. We've been
having some problems with line outage.

266
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,669
Your landlady let me in.

267
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,975
Iguana's, right?

268
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,147
You're a cable-repair person?

269
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,845
Putting myself through school.
Neurosurgery.

270
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:57,318
Great. I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

271
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,013
Particularly not in my apartment.

272
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:02,024
I'm just a regular bad penny,
keep showing up.

273
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:05,186
Hey, how did you learn those moves
in the bar, huh?

274
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,594
- Older brothers.
- Yeah. Well, listen, you hungry?

275
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,599
I know a great Odessan restaurant
right around the block.

276
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,863
I have to take a rain check.
Work, work.

277
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,768
Yeah, I see.

278
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:17,999
Earl!

279
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,473
Hey, big guy.

280
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,805
Well, Earl likes you, so it's settled.

281
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:26,508
- How about this weekend?
- I'm kind of involved.

282
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:30,212
- Triplets.
- Triplets? That's involved.

283
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:34,291
And you should answer that.
My van is double-parked.

284
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,519
If I add the science channel,
can I call you?

285
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,327
Hello?

286
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,931
Fosnight, slow down.

287
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,396
What, Spanier?

288
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,667
Yeah, Spanier. Noble John Spanier.
I just spotted him tonight.

289
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:55,244
Last time I saw this guy was 15 years ago,
right after the Polo Club fire.

290
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,110
- The one that killed Simonson's father?
- Right.

291
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,513
And junior made a fortune
on the insurance.

292
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,883
Listen, this Spanier is kind of
a Bible belter, you know what I mean?

293
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,251
He was in and out of jail
all his life until...

294
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,451
- <i>... the Special Forces got hold of him.</i>
- One of the Fire Lords?

295
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,062
Yeah. Hey, not bad.

296
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,724
Anyway, Spanier's a real case. Guy's got
one foot in the church and one foot in hell.

297
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:21,635
- Where did you last see him?
- By the old custom house over on Pier 23.

298
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,902
What, no thank you?

299
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,997
Yeah.

300
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,404
Mr. DA, get out your checkbook.

301
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,776
Well, how should I know who it is, Earl?

302
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,610
Hey, who's the watchdog around here?

303
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,328
We have to talk.

304
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:54,222
District Attorney Castillo,
it's 3 a.m.

305
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:57,698
So let's cut to the chase.
I know you're the Flash.

306
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,669
Earl, did you hear that?
Have you got the wrong apartment?

307
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:08,040
Like you said, Barry, it's 3 a.m.
Let's cut the comedy.

308
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:15,146
I don't know what you're talking about.

309
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,454
The lightning bolt, your brother's death,
the woman at Star Labs.

310
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,421
Do I have to go on?

311
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,091
Barry.

312
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:29,459
You need a patron.
You need a mentor...

313
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,102
...to guide you.

314
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:36,070
To direct you. Unofficially, of course.

315
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:40,000
How else to condone a masked vigilante?

316
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,112
The city needs you, Barry.

317
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,044
And you need a friend in high places.

318
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,682
Let me be that friend.

319
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,982
Because you sure as hell
don't want me as an enemy.

320
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:56,753
I don't know what you're talking about
here. I mean, we have nothing to discuss.

321
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:01,597
In your short career, you've already made
enemies in all the wrong places, Barry.

322
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,564
- Lf your identity was made public...
- My identity?

323
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:09,036
Everyone you love would be in danger
from everything in Central City.

324
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:13,644
You family, your friends, your dog.
Here, boy.

325
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,744
Fetch.

326
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:20,943
Four-second fuse. Three, two...

327
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,721
Four-second fuse.

328
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:29,725
Three...

329
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:32,022
...two...

330
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:33,859
...one.

331
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:45,034
I'll give you 24 hours to get smart.

332
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,577
Either you work for me, or that reporter
Joe Klein gets the videotape...

333
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:51,739
...of you flashing out of here
earlier tonight.

334
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,147
You know where to find me.

335
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,357
Damn!

336
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:05,355
Videotape.

337
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,073
I can't believe Castillo,
threatening my family like that.

338
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:57,646
I'd like to bash his head
into a wall at hyper speed.

339
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:00,341
Barry, stop.
You're not going to hurt Castillo.

340
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:03,316
And your anxiety level
is not doing your metabolism any good.

341
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:05,718
But the thing is,
part of what he said is true.

342
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,619
Sanction from downtown couldn't hurt.

343
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,556
But not from a crusading DA
who throws a grenade at Earl.

344
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,594
No, of course not.
The man's crooked.

345
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:15,733
On the other hand, I can't go public,
endanger the people I love.

346
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,733
Mom, Dad, Eve, Shawn, you.

347
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:20,803
Think of the heat
it could create for you.

348
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:24,100
Barry, don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

349
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:31,338
I'll play your little game for now, Castillo.

350
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:34,144
But I promise you,
you threaten me or my family again...

351
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,843
...and there'll be hell to play.

352
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:42,188
I want you to hit Simonson's casino
at the wharf.

353
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:47,863
Throw a monkey wrench into the works.
His free ride at the riverfront is over.

354
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:52,259
Think of the good you'll be doing, shutting
down a known criminal's operations.

355
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:56,396
- Our goals are the same, Barry.
- Yeah, but your methods stink.

356
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:21,198
Hey, big guy. Listen, a friend of mine
gave me her card for the evening, all right?

357
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,062
But no names, see.

358
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:27,901
Her husband would never understand.

359
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:42,215
Babe, one 100-dollar chip, please.

360
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,415
It's all I need.

361
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,221
Thanks.

362
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,495
Another out-of-work gigolo
with time to kill?

363
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:02,765
Playing your own money.
I bet you got a system too.

364
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,205
No, I just feel lucky.

365
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:26,496
Timing is everything.

366
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:28,996
You just have to know when to move.

367
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,465
I guess you do.

368
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,131
You're hot. All right.

369
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:44,872
- Yes!
- Seven. Winner.

370
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,249
I don't believe it.

371
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:57,094
Two different dealers,
he's still a quarter of a mil ahead?

372
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,222
You know this guy?

373
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,936
- I feel particularly lucky.
- I'm gonna stay.

374
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,903
Hit me.

375
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:19,412
Let's hope both of us
are honest men, sir.

376
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:23,748
I'm a very bad sport
when it comes to sharks and cheats.

377
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:32,529
- Twenty-three. Bust.
- Now, why don't we call it a night...

378
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:35,063
...and quit while we're ahead.

379
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:39,932
And if I ever see you in this room again,
you'll regret it.

380
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:51,411
And if I don't see you in my room,
we're both gonna regret it.

381
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,118
You can't afford me.

382
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:02,253
Thank you.

383
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,156
Yes, that's lovely.

384
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,792
Thank you.

385
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:08,933
Thank you very much.

386
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,157
That's nice.

387
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:14,400
Thank you. Later.

388
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:28,786
What the hell is happening here?

389
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:36,424
Shut the place down, damn it!

390
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:39,222
Two-hundred-seventy thou and change.

391
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,422
For the love of...

392
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,831
I thought I told you to lock up.

393
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:50,764
Damn it, Castillo. Enough with the showing
up already. You'll get us both indicted.

394
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:55,208
I'm not hired help anymore.
We are partners as of right now.

395
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,181
- You're flipped out of your head.
- How much you lose tonight?

396
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,818
One-fifty, 200 grand?

397
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:05,353
I could arrange for you
to lose like that every night.

398
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:08,924
How long do you think it'll take
the Flash to break you?

399
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,891
The Flash? That punk in shades?

400
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:17,357
Of course not. The Flash is so quick,
you never saw him.

401
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:19,765
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'm supposed to buy that?

402
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,906
Who else could beat your rigged game?

403
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:24,837
Who else could have diffused the bomb
at the customs house?

404
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,442
But don't worry.

405
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:32,273
He won't be visiting
your real-estate fire-sales anymore.

406
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,085
The Flash works for me now.

407
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,651
Just like you do.

408
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:44,222
Boy, I hate these cheap divorce jobs.

409
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:52,765
Nice p.j.'s. Where did you buy them,
Ringling Bros.?

410
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,884
Where do you get off...

411
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:09,952
...breaking and entering,
hiding a camera in my home?

412
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:13,451
Just doing my job.
You wanna press charges, fine.

413
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:16,092
- I'm working here.
- To hell with your job.

414
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,528
You had no right to interfere in my life.

415
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:22,598
The moment you put on that mask,
you gave me that right.

416
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,461
I wear a mask to protect
the people I know and love...

417
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,400
...who might get hurt for what I do.

418
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,837
You're a cop,
you know wearing masks are illegal.

419
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,910
All right. But what would you do,
run through the streets...

420
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:37,275
...stark naked at 350 miles an hour
with bells on your toes?

421
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:40,576
No, you're too busy to worry
about the consequences of your actions.

422
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:43,949
- To hungry for the paycheck.
- What is so noble about running around...

423
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:47,580
...in a Halloween costume?
You should see a psychiatrist.

424
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,659
I can sleep at night.

425
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,289
How about you?

426
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:55,229
Doesn't working for a man
like Castillo bother you?

427
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,369
- What does that mean?
- He's out for all the power he can grab.

428
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,697
Thanks to you,
he's got me up against the wall.

429
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:04,308
He's my client.
He pays his bills. So what?

430
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,136
So what?

431
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:09,845
So he's threatening
my family and my friends...

432
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:12,512
...unless I do his dirty work. Get it?

433
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:18,319
It's Mrs. Kief. She's got a gun.

434
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:28,098
Oh, my God.
She would've killed her husband.

435
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:47,580
Anything on that scrap of cloth
from the second sweep of the warehouse?

436
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,117
Department-store polyester.

437
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:52,415
Our man's not making
this year's "best dressed" list.

438
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:56,354
- Can I help you?
- No, thank you. I'm here to see...

439
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,927
Julio, go downstairs and check
on the test results.

440
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,325
Sure thing.

441
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,436
Hey.

442
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,138
I loved what you did to Simonson.
I loved it.

443
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:13,038
So where's the cash?

444
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,975
Made a very sizable donation
to the Riverside Park Fund.

445
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:19,412
- I didn't tell you to...
- You didn't say anything about the money.

446
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,279
Anyway, I'm finished with you.

447
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:25,119
Like hell you are.

448
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:30,291
Your father's an old man. Your sister-in-law
can't watch your nephew all the time.

449
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,096
What now?

450
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:42,603
I want the list of my
opponent's campaign contributors...

451
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:46,368
...and any other dirt
you can dig up on Paul Van Duzer.

452
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:50,036
Van Duzer's the cleanest politician
this town has seen in years.

453
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:53,078
Nobody's completely honest, Barry.

454
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,813
Everybody's got something to hide, right?

455
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:09,627

"A.S."

457
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,336
Arthur Simonson?

458
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,879
Running with a dangerous crowd,
Castillo.

459
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,357
Certain doors have to be closed.

460
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,826
Take out Megan Lockhart.

461
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,790
<i>And since information is valuable</i>
<i>only if it's exclusive...</i>

462
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,832
<i>... get rid of Christina McGee.</i>

463
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:54,137
- Dr. McGee.
- Why aren't you two in radiation suits?

464
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:56,930
Weren't you told about the leak?

465
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:00,269
Excuse me,
what are you people doing in my lab?

466
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,469
Come on, McGee,
they're trying to kill us.

467
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:17,519
- Heather!
- I'll explain later.

468
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:48,080
- I have nothing to say to you.
- Shut up and listen. She just saved my life.

469
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,819
- I checked on Castillo...
- He's in bed with Simonson.

470
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:54,658
- That's why he's never been convicted.
- Barry, stop. What is going on here?

471
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,202
I think I've got this thing figured.

472
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,930
There's a bill in the state senate
to legalize gambling.

473
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:05,140
And that would put Simonson's
illegal casinos out of business.

474
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:08,244
Right. So he hires Spanier
to torch the waterfront.

475
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:12,178
Then he buys it dirt cheap,
using a phony corporation to cover his tail.

476
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,141
Then when the gambling bill passes,
lo and behold...

477
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:18,447
...Simonson has valuable property,
perfect for a major casino strip.

478
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,954
Putting him back in business,
bigger than ever.

479
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,116
That's the gold ring
Castillo's looking for?

480
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:27,628
Yeah. Just got a call from my informer.
The firebug's headed to the waterfront.

481
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:30,266
If I can catch him,
I can bring this scheme down.

482
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,334
Simonson and Castillo both.

483
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,971
- Let me help.
- Forget it.

484
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,775
Does that weird you out?

485
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,572
All the time.

486
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:57,293
I beheld Satan
as lightning falls from earth!

487
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:15,008
<i>I told you to put the screws</i>
<i>to the senator.</i>

488
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:18,205
- <i>What are you stalling for?</i>
- <i>I know what I'm doing.</i>

489
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:20,873
<i>I don't need anyone to tell me</i>
<i>how to run my business.</i>

490
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:23,611
<i>You've been sitting on your hands.</i>
<i>The moment's passing.</i>

491
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,380
<i>A little patience goes a long way.</i>

492
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:29,014
<i>The hell with patience. You've had</i>
<i>Senator Clark on your payroll for years.</i>

493
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:31,923
Can't move on the gambling bill
until after the election.

494
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,532
Then I say we push him right now.
He don't play, we roll right over him.

495
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,826
Slow down!
I've spent too many years on this...

496
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:41,335
...to see you blow it. You want it all,
but you can barely handle...

497
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:44,599
...what you've got.
- That's right, what I've got.

498
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,342
Oh, mine enemy!

499
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:58,847
I'm not ready for eternity yet!

500
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:00,888
Shut the hell up.

501
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:43,233
Listen to me, Spanier, who hired you?

502
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:48,828
- Who hired you?!
- Arthur Simonson.

503
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:53,835
Tell that to the police, or I'll be back.

504
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:02,677
He's the one, officer.
He's been torching the waterfront.

505
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,946
But he didn't get my cannery.
No, sir.

506
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:08,455
- Gosh, ma'am, how did you manage this?
- The Flash did it.

507
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:11,656
I seen him with my own eyes.

508
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:15,697
The angel of Satan, red as the devil!

509
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:19,893
Ah, nuts. Who had Pier 23
in the office pool, Bellows?

510
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,366
Get out of here.

511
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:26,338
No more calls. We have a winner.

512
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,545
Was every job I did for you a crime?

513
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,203
You know this woman?

514
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,545
She's got enough on this
to lock us both away for life.

515
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:38,377
The awful truth is I used you
because nobody's gonna miss you...

516
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,649
...one way or the other.
- You pig!

517
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:43,554
Get her out of here.

518
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,423
- Kill her and dump her in the river.
- Slime dog.

519
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:36,074
Watch out, Red!

520
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:51,986
- I thought you worked for Castillo.
- I don't work for anybody.

521
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:56,525
Take this.
You've just been closed down.

522
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,897
Tie him up.
I've got to go after Castillo.

523
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,436
- He'll expose you.
- I know.

524
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:04,506
I have to risk it.

525
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,407
- End of the line, Castillo.
- No way, Barry. You're a boy scout.

526
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:16,052
You believe in that whole
"good guy, bad guy" rap.

527
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:19,982
I open my mouth, they'll be all over you.
The mob doesn't get you...

528
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:24,218
...you'll end up dissected by the feds.
The only way to stop me is to kill me.

529
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,158
And you won't.

530
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:44,580
Castillo was out of his league
from word one.

531
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:46,272
Mob justice.

532
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,247
Yeah, you got that right.

533
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:51,718
Simonson wasn't about
to take orders from Castillo.

534
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:56,823
That's the problem with secret lives,
they can really screw you up.

535
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:04,266
You know, I still resent you for
poking around in my personal life.

536
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:07,962
Yeah, and if I hadn't, you never
would have nailed Simonson and Castillo...

537
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:09,901
...not to mention Spanier.

538
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:15,811
Yeah, but how can I be sure
you're not gonna blow my cover...

539
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:19,415
...the minute you leave town?
- You did save my life.

540
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,551
It's a heavy marker, wouldn't you say?

541
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,051
Yeah, but I need to be sure.

542
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:27,520
You might just trust me a little
after all that's gone on.

543
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:30,592
Look, this is really hard for me to say...

544
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:33,286
...but you taught me a real lesson
when you zoomed...

545
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:37,594
...into that hot-sheet hotel. I can't go
traipsing through other people's lives...

546
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:40,430
...until I figure out
what I should be doing with my own.

547
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:43,565
I got to take responsibility
for my actions.

548
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,343
Here's every frame I ever shot of you.

549
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:54,382
I fudged the computer records to blur
any connection between you and the Flash.

550
00:45:55,018 --> 00:46:01,082
But you still got to watch out
for that cute little red behind of yours.

551
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:06,728
To think,
I was just about to ask you out.

552
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:10,293
It wasn't dinner and a movie...

553
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:16,464
...but I'd call an evening's action
at a local hot spot...

554
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:20,469
...one hell of a first date.
- Yeah?

555
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,515
That's all for now.

556
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:31,344
- I'm not that kind of girl.
- Well, it's never too late to start.

557
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,381
