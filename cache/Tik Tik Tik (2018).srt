1
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:20,962
"The Tsunami colony in Chennai's Ennore
region was impacted around 11.30 PM..."

2
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,087
"...last night, by an asteroid."

3
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:29,087
"At least fourteen people were killed..."

4
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:34,712
"...and more than 35 people admitted
to the hospital with serious injuries."

5
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:37,962
"A team of meteorologists surveyed
the impact zone..."

6
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:41,004
"...and have sent samples of the asteroid
to the research center."

7
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:44,378
"Only after thorough analysis,
can more be known about this asteroid."

8
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:50,296
Munnar, Kerala.

9
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:03,545
The information which I'm about to share
does not leave this room.

10
00:06:04,587 --> 00:06:09,254
You are all aware of the asteroid
which struck Chennai two days ago.

11
00:06:09,378 --> 00:06:10,879
As per our calculations...

12
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:14,087
...we will be struck by another asteroid
in seven days.

13
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,753
It will slam into the Bay of Bengal,
50 kilometers away from Chennai.

14
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,962
The asteroid which struck two days ago,
measures eight square feet.

15
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,170
This one, measures 60 square kilometers.

16
00:06:31,212 --> 00:06:33,004
Larger than the city of Chennai.

17
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:35,170
If it strikes the Bay of Bengal...

18
00:06:35,296 --> 00:06:40,587
...Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Sri Lanka
would witness a devastating tsunami.

19
00:06:43,545 --> 00:06:47,004
The resulting tremors would bring down
many buildings.

20
00:06:48,296 --> 00:06:51,545
It will change India's very topography.

21
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,670
I suggest we evacuate everyone
and move them to a neighboring state.

22
00:06:57,795 --> 00:07:01,212
Moving a population of 80 million
would take a month...

23
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:05,420
...even if we deploy our rail, road
or air services.

24
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:08,879
It would take a week to source
the fuel for this mission.

25
00:07:09,004 --> 00:07:11,920
Not only that.
If this news reaches the public...

26
00:07:12,045 --> 00:07:14,670
...imagine the problems
that would stem from mass panic.

27
00:07:15,461 --> 00:07:17,712
How many lives would be lost?

28
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,587
It would be devastating.

29
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:23,712
Forty million people will lose their lives.

30
00:07:27,296 --> 00:07:30,920
Do you want us to be mute spectators
while people die?

31
00:07:31,045 --> 00:07:32,920
We're not here to sit and watch.

32
00:07:39,212 --> 00:07:42,628
We will not tolerate any attack
on India.

33
00:07:45,254 --> 00:07:47,296
Here is the surface map of the asteroid.

34
00:07:50,587 --> 00:07:53,129
The rear of the asteroid
has a crater.

35
00:07:55,753 --> 00:07:59,587
It seems like a well and runs deep
into the center of the asteroid.

36
00:08:01,712 --> 00:08:03,129
This is its weakest point.

37
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:06,837
A nuclear blast in the crater...

38
00:08:06,962 --> 00:08:10,378
...would blow it in two
and deflect it away from Earth.

39
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:11,837
This is the safety line.

40
00:08:11,962 --> 00:08:16,087
We need to blast the asteroid
before it crosses the safety line...

41
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:18,628
...to deflect it away from earth.

42
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,420
There is no use blasting the asteroid
once it crosses the safety line.

43
00:08:30,212 --> 00:08:33,087
We have six days before it crosses
the safety line.

44
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:40,004
Is it possible for us to launch a rocket,
within six days, without raising suspicion?

45
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:41,129
Possible, Chief!

46
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:45,212
We can announce it to the public
as a satellite maintenance program.

47
00:08:45,337 --> 00:08:48,045
News about rocket launches
is pretty common these days.

48
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:52,545
The blast calculations are precise.

49
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,837
But there is one problem!

50
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:59,087
We don't have such a powerful missile.

51
00:08:59,212 --> 00:09:00,795
Nor does any country.

52
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,337
All the countries signed a peace treaty
last year at the United Nations.

53
00:09:06,461 --> 00:09:11,420
Per the treaty, production of nukes
more than 20 kilotons is prohibited.

54
00:09:11,545 --> 00:09:14,753
We will need a 200 kiloton nuke
to blast this asteroid.

55
00:09:21,337 --> 00:09:24,378
I need permission
to speak off the record, sir .

56
00:09:25,962 --> 00:09:29,795
A few countries have sourced nukes
from black markets owing to war.

57
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:34,337
Given our situation,
can we consider that alternative?

58
00:09:34,461 --> 00:09:37,587
Do we need to source it from the
black markets? Like terrorists?

59
00:09:37,712 --> 00:09:39,337
I need some time to think about this.

60
00:09:52,712 --> 00:09:54,545
Istanbul, Turkey.

61
00:09:57,712 --> 00:09:59,712
Please trace this identification number.

62
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,795
If you have really placed this call
through this ID...

63
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,087
...I will have to close my business
and go under the radar.

64
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:14,129
We called to talk business.

65
00:10:16,545 --> 00:10:18,045
Give me the list.

66
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,795
Just one item.

67
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,962
200 kiloton nuclear missile.

68
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:23,587
Do you know what you are asking for?

69
00:10:23,712 --> 00:10:26,587
Do you know who you are speaking to?

70
00:10:26,712 --> 00:10:29,337
With a 200 kiloton nuke,
we can wipe out an entire country.

71
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:30,837
No black market will have it.

72
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:33,837
Then we don't need you at all.

73
00:10:34,837 --> 00:10:38,712
Cut the call, shut down your network
and pack up.

74
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:43,461
There is one place
where you can source it from.

75
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:48,004
This country has kept a 200 kiloton missile
under wraps.

76
00:10:50,962 --> 00:10:53,920
How do we verify
if the information is true?

77
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:56,461
I will send you all the details.

78
00:10:56,587 --> 00:10:58,670
You will know once you see it.

79
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:11,962
Can we seek help from them
through the Indian embassy?

80
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:13,795
No.

81
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,296
That would go against the treaty.
They won't go on record and admit it.

82
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,212
Other countries will impose sanctions
on them if the truth comes out.

83
00:11:22,337 --> 00:11:25,420
If we can't speak to them,
what are our alternatives, Chief?

84
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:27,795
There is only one way.

85
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,212
Now, allow me to speak off the record.

86
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:36,753
This is a secret mission.

87
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:42,920
The report will be sent only to the Home,
Defence Depts. and the Prime Minister.

88
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,296
We need to steal the missile.

89
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,420
Stealing the weapons of another country,
could lead to war.

90
00:11:58,087 --> 00:11:59,087
No.

91
00:11:59,628 --> 00:12:01,670
Their possession of the weapon
is illegal.

92
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:05,045
They won’t be even able to report
it missing.

93
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:09,461
Stealing the missile is no easy task.

94
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:11,587
Because the missile isn't in their country.

95
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:17,628
It's been strategically placed to attack
any corner of the world.

96
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:19,879
In space!

97
00:12:28,587 --> 00:12:31,628
It is under the guise
of a research centre.

98
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,795
But it is a military base.

99
00:12:38,296 --> 00:12:41,170
Knowing that wars of the future
are to be waged in space...

100
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:43,254
...they have taken this drastic step.

101
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:48,170
The missile is housed in a secured vault.

102
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:53,879
It is impossible to breach the alarm system
and gain entry.

103
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:02,753
Even if one does gain entry,
an army of soldiers will block the exit.

104
00:13:04,628 --> 00:13:09,628
Our team isn't equipped
to crack such vaults and gain entry.

105
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:12,795
We can't rely on our team alone
to gain entry into the vault.

106
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,753
We need an expert.

107
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,628
To help us break the vault...

108
00:13:20,753 --> 00:13:22,545
...we are going to employ a thief.

109
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,045
How can we trust an outsider
while handling such a sensitive issue?

110
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,378
A thief, no less!

111
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,004
Let me ask you a question.

112
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:40,545
To save 40 million lives,
I'm passing an order, to steal the missile.

113
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,170
Does anybody have any objection?

114
00:13:46,795 --> 00:13:49,503
We will execute your order
without any questions.

115
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:12,587
Get me the most talented thief out there!

116
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,587
"Tik. Tik. Tik."

117
00:15:32,545 --> 00:15:34,545
Chennai, Tamil Nadu.

118
00:15:44,212 --> 00:15:48,170
Oblivious to what's happening up there,
they are fighting over frivolous issues.

119
00:15:48,296 --> 00:15:50,045
Based on the five cases we saw...

120
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,628
...I am sure
they will be reduced to ashes in a week.

121
00:15:52,753 --> 00:15:56,212
There's no thief on Earth,
that matches our Chief's expectations.

122
00:15:58,378 --> 00:16:00,962
His name is Vasu.
A very dangerous man.

123
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:04,129
That is why we have jailed him
in isolation.

124
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,254
Great!

125
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:08,254
Is he that dangerous?
-He is an expert magician!

126
00:16:09,296 --> 00:16:12,254
Once he managed to get out of the cell!

127
00:16:12,378 --> 00:16:15,628
The doors were locked. Bars weren't bent.
But he was outside the cell.

128
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:19,837
Why do you all want to meet Vasu?

129
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:21,461
To save the country!

130
00:17:15,337 --> 00:17:17,129
He has the nerves to insult the Chief!

131
00:17:17,254 --> 00:17:19,879
It's a one side mirror.
He can't see us.

132
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,254
Vasudevan.

133
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:30,045
You need to be careful
while dealing with Vasu.

134
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:35,296
He can practically break in to any place.

135
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,296
He can escape from any situation.

136
00:17:38,296 --> 00:17:43,004
Initially, he used his skills to help a few
and perform some magic shows.

137
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:47,087
Later, he started targeting people
who had amassed wealth illegally.

138
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:57,337
We are all aware of the recent twin murder
involving a minister's son.

139
00:17:57,461 --> 00:18:02,296
But they tried to frame the son
of this old man who works at their house.

140
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,920
The weapon used was hidden away
in the police evidence room.

141
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,170
Six months ago.

142
00:18:10,461 --> 00:18:13,753
It conked out this morning!

143
00:18:20,087 --> 00:18:23,212
They stopped producing these,
even before I was born!

144
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:24,795
Do you still use these things?

145
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,129
Get it replaced!

146
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:34,129
Poker!

147
00:18:34,254 --> 00:18:35,879
Dude, we are in!

148
00:19:10,045 --> 00:19:11,545
She was the one who beat me up, sir!

149
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:19,461
Which station?
-Ayanavaram!

150
00:19:19,587 --> 00:19:21,087
Please sign here.

151
00:19:40,753 --> 00:19:41,753
You may go!

152
00:20:01,212 --> 00:20:03,545
Why did you allow a cop
from another station inside?

153
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,670
Sir, the thing is...

154
00:20:04,795 --> 00:20:06,795
Did you verify in the system?
-Yes, sir!

155
00:20:23,087 --> 00:20:25,004
No one must exit the station!
-Yes, sir!

156
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:26,837
Close the gates!
Don't let anyone out!

157
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,712
We shouldn't let him escape.

158
00:21:16,837 --> 00:21:17,837
Search him!

159
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,420
Check his pockets.

160
00:21:31,045 --> 00:21:32,129
Search him thoroughly!

161
00:22:00,296 --> 00:22:04,045
All done, sir. He doesn't have a gun.
-What? Where is it then?

162
00:22:13,212 --> 00:22:14,212
Here, sir!

163
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:18,837
I searched him thoroughly.
-Keep him here until we find the gun.

164
00:22:31,087 --> 00:22:33,045
The gun has been produced
in court, sir!

165
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,429
You shouldn't have played
with police.

166
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:52,034
The evidence in this box is against
a gang, that deal with illegal explosives.

167
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,285
For coming in and burning them...

168
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,784
...you can be jailed without trial
under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

169
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:59,826
For how many years?
-At least five.

170
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:12,618
You went to save my son...

171
00:23:12,743 --> 00:23:15,034
...but now, you're separated from yours!

172
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:20,285
Compared to doing nothing
while being aware of your bad situation...

173
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,118
...this isn't that big a sentence.

174
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,159
Dad...

175
00:23:33,618 --> 00:23:34,618
His only weakness...

176
00:23:35,285 --> 00:23:36,743
...is his son, Ravi.

177
00:23:39,076 --> 00:23:41,576
You can control him
only by exploiting this.

178
00:23:46,784 --> 00:23:49,368
'O scamp!'

179
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,535
'My dear scamp!'

180
00:23:57,576 --> 00:24:00,118
'O scamp!'

181
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:05,451
'My dear scamp!'

182
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:24,784
'I grew shorter, because of you.
I drew in the sand, because of you.'

183
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:28,410
'I melted in the sea, because of you!'

184
00:24:30,493 --> 00:24:35,743
'I spread as wings, because of you.
I flew on ground, because of you.'

185
00:24:35,867 --> 00:24:39,285
'My life filled with hue,
because of you!'

186
00:24:41,201 --> 00:24:46,159
'A crayon broken into two
for me and you.'

187
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:51,368
'A packet of chips,
together we tore and chomped away.'

188
00:24:51,493 --> 00:24:53,451
'Chomped away to oblivion!'

189
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:54,993
'O scamp!'

190
00:24:56,493 --> 00:24:58,784
'You are my whole world!'

191
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:00,826
'My dear scamp!'

192
00:25:01,826 --> 00:25:04,076
'You are my life!'

193
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:06,159
'O scamp!'

194
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:09,493
'You are my whole world!'

195
00:25:09,618 --> 00:25:11,326
'My dear scamp!'

196
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,784
'You are my life!'

197
00:25:47,867 --> 00:25:52,993
'Across the stars in the skies,
all I see are your eyes.'

198
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:57,410
'I will bring the moon to your feet!'

199
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:03,660
'Should a thousand victories come by,
I shall accept with a smile.'

200
00:26:03,784 --> 00:26:07,076
'Only to you, will I ever lose!'

201
00:26:08,201 --> 00:26:13,451
'When it's time to celebrate,
beautiful, the world does seem!'

202
00:26:13,576 --> 00:26:18,784
'When it's time for homework,
blood pressure soars extreme!'

203
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:23,784
'Don't I know from where springs
your naughty gene?'

204
00:26:26,784 --> 00:26:29,702
'O scamp!'

205
00:26:29,826 --> 00:26:32,076
'You are my whole world!'

206
00:26:32,201 --> 00:26:34,993
'My dear scamp!'

207
00:26:35,118 --> 00:26:37,451
'You are my life!'

208
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:40,368
'O scamp!'

209
00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:42,660
'You are my whole world!'

210
00:26:42,784 --> 00:26:45,743
'My dear scamp!'

211
00:26:45,867 --> 00:26:48,076
'You are my life!'

212
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:54,285
'I speak gibberish, because of you.'
'I dream in cartoons, because of you.'

213
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:57,034
'I became a loony, because of you!'

214
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,368
'I lived one amongst the ants,
a days few.

215
00:27:02,493 --> 00:27:04,951
'I lived as a dog and a cat,
a days few.'

216
00:27:05,076 --> 00:27:08,034
'I turned a human,
because of you!'

217
00:27:10,535 --> 00:27:13,702
'As a wonder,
you came into my life...'

218
00:27:13,826 --> 00:27:15,702
'...and warmed my heart.'

219
00:27:15,826 --> 00:27:19,118
'You bestowed on me,
the title of a "father"...'

220
00:27:19,243 --> 00:27:20,826
'...and made me raise my head high!'

221
00:27:20,951 --> 00:27:22,867
'Raise my head high!'

222
00:27:22,993 --> 00:27:25,618
'O scamp!'

223
00:27:25,743 --> 00:27:28,034
'You are my whole world!'

224
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,951
'My dear scamp!'

225
00:27:31,076 --> 00:27:33,368
'You are my life!'

226
00:27:33,493 --> 00:27:36,368
'O scamp!'

227
00:27:36,493 --> 00:27:38,660
'You are my lifeblood!'

228
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:41,702
'My dear scamp!'

229
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,993
'You are my dawn!'

230
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,326
He is Vasu's son.
You can go see Vasu first.

231
00:28:13,368 --> 00:28:14,909
Let the kid go ahead.
-Yes, sir.

232
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,451
Your son is here to see you.

233
00:28:25,576 --> 00:28:26,702
I'll send him in.

234
00:28:26,826 --> 00:28:28,159
In here?

235
00:28:28,285 --> 00:28:29,993
We usually meet in the visiting area.

236
00:28:30,118 --> 00:28:33,118
If you want to see him here, do it.
If not, I'll send him away.

237
00:28:33,243 --> 00:28:35,326
He'd be anticipating this.
I'll see him here.

238
00:28:35,451 --> 00:28:37,493
Can you take off these cuffs, please?

239
00:28:37,618 --> 00:28:39,034
Let him not see me with these.

240
00:28:39,702 --> 00:28:42,867
When you come in here,
forget about your dignity!

241
00:28:42,993 --> 00:28:46,326
This is how you will see him.
If you don't want to, I'll send him away!

242
00:28:54,201 --> 00:28:55,826
How did you take them off?

243
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:57,034
Hey!
Release me!

244
00:28:58,034 --> 00:29:00,159
Let the Chief see
what kind of person he is.

245
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:03,118
Someone might see this!
I'll be ruined on my first day here!

246
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:04,951
I beg of you!
Let me loose!

247
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,368
Isn't it a rule to not have inmates
in cuffs during visiting hours?

248
00:29:08,493 --> 00:29:11,243
Rather than doing that,
why this needless mockery?

249
00:29:11,368 --> 00:29:13,368
Want to see your son?
Do so without cuffs!

250
00:29:13,493 --> 00:29:15,118
I'll even give you the keys. Take it!

251
00:29:24,201 --> 00:29:25,743
He has no discipline!

252
00:29:25,867 --> 00:29:27,493
He behaves like a rogue!

253
00:29:28,993 --> 00:29:29,993
Dad!

254
00:29:33,326 --> 00:29:34,410
Ravi!

255
00:29:34,535 --> 00:29:35,535
Dad!

256
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,743
What is it?

257
00:29:38,867 --> 00:29:39,993
Look in your pocket!

258
00:29:51,076 --> 00:29:53,076
Having a hard time
staying in this room, dad?

259
00:29:54,076 --> 00:29:56,576
Who told you that
your father's just stuck in here?

260
00:29:57,285 --> 00:29:59,243
Abracadabra!

261
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,118
All the cops
are your dad's friends!

262
00:30:04,243 --> 00:30:06,493
Then tell them to send you home!

263
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:08,576
I'll be home in a few days.

264
00:30:08,702 --> 00:30:10,326
Look in your pocket, dad.

265
00:30:13,034 --> 00:30:15,201
Playing my game with me, eh?
-Yeah!

266
00:30:17,826 --> 00:30:18,951
Dad...

267
00:30:19,076 --> 00:30:21,743
Visiting time's up.
That's enough sweet talk for now.

268
00:30:22,535 --> 00:30:23,702
Come along!
-Dad!

269
00:30:23,826 --> 00:30:25,243
A little more time, please...

270
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:28,867
Dad!

271
00:30:29,784 --> 00:30:30,909
Don't be afraid!

272
00:30:50,493 --> 00:30:52,493
He can't follow a single rule, Chief!

273
00:30:53,535 --> 00:30:55,535
But he's a good man.

274
00:31:05,618 --> 00:31:07,326
I have your release order
in my hands.

275
00:31:07,743 --> 00:31:11,493
With the special powers of the Indian Army,
your criminal record is cleared.

276
00:31:12,243 --> 00:31:14,076
Please step outside.
-Yes, sir.

277
00:31:17,993 --> 00:31:21,034
Per this order, if you wish to be released,
you must do what we say.

278
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:27,368
You must steal something
from a high security vault.

279
00:31:30,243 --> 00:31:33,660
I'm ready to do anything,
if I can be with my son again.

280
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:38,784
If I have my team,
I can break into any vault.

281
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,951
Ritchie Street, Chennai.

282
00:31:54,618 --> 00:31:56,034
Third empire's decision, man!

283
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,326
Confirmed not-out!

284
00:32:02,326 --> 00:32:03,326
Let's see.

285
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,951
Saw the third umpire's decision, yes?
March back to the dressing room!

286
00:32:43,034 --> 00:32:44,451
Damn it, Billy!

287
00:32:46,993 --> 00:32:49,076
What did you do?
The army's here for you!

288
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:50,368
Army?
Hey!

289
00:32:50,493 --> 00:32:52,535
How did they hear about this so fast?
-Army?

290
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:02,909
Hey Venkat!

291
00:33:12,618 --> 00:33:15,285
Let go of me, sir!
They declared it not-out, didn't they?

292
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,493
Where is your partner?

293
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:30,159
Bloody prick!

294
00:33:34,618 --> 00:33:38,326
They wrongly declared Chief Dhoni out
by LBW, last time. That's why I did it.

295
00:34:04,493 --> 00:34:07,493
Under the POTA act,
I think they'll make us hang by the neck.

296
00:34:07,618 --> 00:34:09,034
Hey!
What are you saying, man?

297
00:34:16,451 --> 00:34:18,702
What is this, bro?
The army guys caught you, too?

298
00:34:19,702 --> 00:34:21,410
I made them bring you here.

299
00:34:21,535 --> 00:34:22,660
You?

300
00:34:22,784 --> 00:34:25,826
Are we getting the President's Award
as a reward for our service?

301
00:34:25,951 --> 00:34:27,410
Why do you think they called us?

302
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:32,118
To steal some object,
they released me from prison.

303
00:34:32,243 --> 00:34:33,243
What object?

304
00:34:33,951 --> 00:34:35,743
Steal what?
-What is this?

305
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:37,618
It's like the mirror from "Bigg Boss".

306
00:34:48,076 --> 00:34:52,243
You've been released under the provisions
of Armed Forces Special Power Act, 1958.

307
00:34:53,243 --> 00:34:54,951
So even the military needs our help!

308
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:58,368
How did they get that tablet?
-I don't know, Colonel.

309
00:34:58,493 --> 00:35:00,201
We thoroughly searched them.

310
00:35:00,326 --> 00:35:02,159
Did you ask for 50% share
of the loot?

311
00:35:02,285 --> 00:35:06,034
When that military girl stated her terms,
all I thought of, was to get out of jail.

312
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:07,743
A military girl?

313
00:35:07,867 --> 00:35:10,493
What's she like?
-Not hot, but above average.

314
00:35:12,867 --> 00:35:14,368
If anyone's a threat, it's them!

315
00:35:14,493 --> 00:35:16,285
It's okay even if I don't get a share.

316
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,201
But at 7 PM, my hands start trembling!

317
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:20,702
Can I get some free rum
from the military?

318
00:35:20,826 --> 00:35:22,243
Hey!

319
00:35:22,368 --> 00:35:23,618
What the hell, man?

320
00:35:23,743 --> 00:35:26,243
That... is guaranteed.
-Totally!

321
00:35:30,118 --> 00:35:32,118
We're supposed to rely on these clowns?

322
00:35:34,702 --> 00:35:37,909
I'm sorry, Chief.
But I think we're better off without them.

323
00:35:38,034 --> 00:35:39,410
Let's avoid this, Chief.

324
00:35:41,034 --> 00:35:42,076
We'll give them a test.

325
00:35:43,118 --> 00:35:44,493
And then take a decision.

326
00:35:44,618 --> 00:35:46,076
Give them a very hard test.

327
00:35:46,201 --> 00:35:48,702
If not, they might come along
and ruin this mission.

328
00:35:48,826 --> 00:35:51,702
Even in such a big mirror,
I can't see you completely!

329
00:35:52,743 --> 00:35:53,743
What a figure!

330
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:04,034
Thought he'd give them a test,
but he's giving us one!

331
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,993
We shouldn't lose in front of them!

332
00:36:08,118 --> 00:36:11,285
This vault is made of
the world's strongest titanium.

333
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,909
Your task is to open it.

334
00:36:14,034 --> 00:36:16,076
For that, you can use
any of this equipment.

335
00:36:19,784 --> 00:36:21,702
But, your time to finish it...

336
00:36:22,576 --> 00:36:23,702
...is just two minutes.

337
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,826
You have one more minute.

338
00:37:03,826 --> 00:37:05,159
Get those explosive sticks!

339
00:37:11,826 --> 00:37:14,034
What is this?
Decoration for "Ayudha Pooja"?

340
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,201
Don't ridicule them.

341
00:37:36,867 --> 00:37:38,743
You have the same rules and regulations.

342
00:37:38,867 --> 00:37:40,660
You can use
any of this equipment.

343
00:37:52,702 --> 00:37:54,618
Go on, man.
They're getting pissed off!

344
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,576
We should've used more powerful sticks.

345
00:38:27,702 --> 00:38:29,285
Two of them...
-That's what I took.

346
00:39:01,702 --> 00:39:03,201
Now do you get it?

347
00:39:03,326 --> 00:39:04,867
Now do you get why we need him?

348
00:39:04,993 --> 00:39:07,576
Give them the necessary training.
-Yes, Chief!

349
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:32,451
It has crossed Triplicane!

350
00:39:32,576 --> 00:39:36,326
Washermanpet. Chinthatharipet.
Ritchie Street. Our hood is finished?

351
00:39:37,493 --> 00:39:38,743
Worried about our "hood"?

352
00:39:38,867 --> 00:39:40,451
It's crossing Villupuram, man!

353
00:39:40,576 --> 00:39:42,118
You make it sound like a bus route!

354
00:39:43,576 --> 00:39:45,909
My uncle lives in Thanjavur.
No sea there, right?

355
00:39:46,034 --> 00:39:47,034
Quiet!

356
00:39:48,702 --> 00:39:50,576
You talked about stealing some object.

357
00:39:50,702 --> 00:39:52,118
Won't you tell us what it is?

358
00:39:52,993 --> 00:39:55,493
I'm learning about this for the first time,
right now!

359
00:39:56,576 --> 00:39:57,909
In space...

360
00:39:58,034 --> 00:40:00,285
...there is no gravitational energy.

361
00:40:01,368 --> 00:40:02,576
There is no air.

362
00:40:02,702 --> 00:40:05,201
The faintest sound cannot travel.
You can't hear it.

363
00:40:06,201 --> 00:40:10,368
If you leave the spaceship
without wearing this suit...

364
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:12,243
...your bodies will explode.

365
00:40:13,867 --> 00:40:15,660
If you remove these gloves
or helmet...

366
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,576
...or even a small scratch
appears on it...

367
00:40:19,576 --> 00:40:20,618
...instant death.

368
00:40:26,493 --> 00:40:28,576
Why does it say "Made in India"?

369
00:40:28,702 --> 00:40:32,034
In this mission, every bit of technology
is Indian made.

370
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:33,702
So everything is indigenous?

371
00:40:33,826 --> 00:40:36,493
Hollywood has the best space stuff.
Our stuff won't fly.

372
00:40:36,618 --> 00:40:38,326
This is a mission of the Indian Army!

373
00:40:38,451 --> 00:40:40,034
Least from now, try to be patriotic!

374
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,243
Patriotism, huh?

375
00:40:41,368 --> 00:40:43,368
How many of you use Indian made phones?

376
00:40:48,201 --> 00:40:50,660
Even for inexpensive phones,
we trust nothing local.

377
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,201
And you want us to stake our lives?

378
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:55,243
If you have any serious questions,
ask me!

379
00:40:55,368 --> 00:40:56,951
If not, go and pig out!

380
00:40:57,076 --> 00:40:58,326
One small doubt.

381
00:40:58,451 --> 00:41:01,618
While wearing this outfit,
what do we do if we want to pee?

382
00:41:02,451 --> 00:41:04,660
He asked me to ask you!
-As if you never pee!

383
00:41:07,576 --> 00:41:08,576
In a diaper?

384
00:41:09,951 --> 00:41:13,243
You'll definitely be needing this,
for the place you're going next.

385
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:40,410
Hey! She's flying!

386
00:41:45,702 --> 00:41:48,743
In a zero gravity environment,
your breathing must be controlled!

387
00:41:48,867 --> 00:41:51,618
If you breathe fast,
whatever's in your body will get out!

388
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:54,285
We don't puke even after downing
a full shot of whiskey!

389
00:41:56,118 --> 00:41:57,493
Don't embarrass me like this!

390
00:42:05,867 --> 00:42:06,909
I'm scared of heights!

391
00:42:10,493 --> 00:42:11,867
Can this fan handle my weight?

392
00:42:13,702 --> 00:42:14,702
Hold me!

393
00:42:15,326 --> 00:42:17,034
Don't be scared!
You okay?

394
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:18,867
Don't you dare!

395
00:42:21,118 --> 00:42:22,243
What's wrong?

396
00:42:22,368 --> 00:42:24,660
It's okay. Just hold it in.

397
00:42:24,784 --> 00:42:26,034
Hold it in!

398
00:42:29,702 --> 00:42:30,702
Go over there!

399
00:42:47,784 --> 00:42:49,993
My goodness.
I'm sorry, buddy!

400
00:42:50,118 --> 00:42:52,118
Had a heavy lunch.
-Never mind.

401
00:42:52,243 --> 00:42:53,867
Next time, we'll fly like a phoenix!

402
00:42:53,993 --> 00:42:55,326
Are you okay, Vasu?

403
00:43:03,993 --> 00:43:08,326
This is the exact design model,
of the missile that you have to steal.

404
00:43:10,576 --> 00:43:14,118
All crew members must be aware
of how to load the missile.

405
00:43:23,535 --> 00:43:26,660
The missile will travel
to the precise spot...

406
00:43:26,784 --> 00:43:29,410
...of the location co-ordinates
that we input into it.

407
00:43:30,576 --> 00:43:34,326
In space, rather than using
North, South, East and West...

408
00:43:34,451 --> 00:43:37,535
...we feed in co-ordinates titled
"X", "Y", and "Z".

409
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:42,493
Using these three axes,
we can travel anywhere in space.

410
00:43:42,618 --> 00:43:45,702
What I told you, is very important.
Please make note of it.

411
00:43:48,118 --> 00:43:50,076
How attentive the both of you are!

412
00:43:50,201 --> 00:43:51,618
Look at him!

413
00:44:56,159 --> 00:44:57,993
Sorry, sir.
Swathi got away.

414
00:44:58,993 --> 00:45:02,201
It's alright.
Execute our plan!

415
00:45:02,326 --> 00:45:03,660
There is another way.

416
00:45:09,826 --> 00:45:12,076
Swathi's pissed off
and she's got a gun!

417
00:45:12,201 --> 00:45:13,201
With a gun?

418
00:45:14,368 --> 00:45:16,118
You're right!
It wasn't me!

419
00:45:30,034 --> 00:45:31,034
Still don't get it?

420
00:45:40,993 --> 00:45:42,826
Hey!
It says we shouldn't go in here.

421
00:45:56,535 --> 00:45:57,784
She came with a gun for this?

422
00:46:01,951 --> 00:46:02,951
All an act, huh?

423
00:46:04,784 --> 00:46:05,784
For what?

424
00:46:07,867 --> 00:46:08,867
Come. Let's eat.

425
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,867
Someone tried to kill me
from there.

426
00:46:13,993 --> 00:46:16,951
Despite so much security,
how can anyone get in?

427
00:46:17,076 --> 00:46:18,618
Definitely wasn't an outsider!

428
00:46:19,909 --> 00:46:22,702
I'm against having a criminal like you
in a mission like this!

429
00:46:24,326 --> 00:46:26,576
But now, your team
is the only one I can trust.

430
00:46:28,451 --> 00:46:31,243
We need to stand up to anyone
trying to impede this mission!

431
00:46:46,285 --> 00:46:50,076
'Are those the drops of time,
that ring through your ears?'

432
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:55,826
'Are those quivers
the beat of your heart?'

433
00:46:55,951 --> 00:46:59,702
'Can anything that a man does
to end the root of suffering...'

434
00:46:59,826 --> 00:47:01,702
'...be considered a sin?'

435
00:47:01,826 --> 00:47:05,618
'If clouds do not steal water
from the sea...'

436
00:47:05,743 --> 00:47:07,535
'...can there ever be any rain?'

437
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:11,535
'Can anything that a man does
to end the root of suffering...'

438
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,451
'...be considered a sin?'

439
00:47:13,576 --> 00:47:17,368
'If clouds do not steal water
from the sea...'

440
00:47:17,493 --> 00:47:19,326
'...can there ever be any rain?'

441
00:47:19,451 --> 00:47:22,201
'Destiny, small.
Determination, huge.'

442
00:47:22,326 --> 00:47:25,076
'Obstacles, small.
Answers, huge.'

443
00:47:25,201 --> 00:47:28,076
'Pain, small.
Path, huge.'

444
00:47:28,201 --> 00:47:30,951
'The material, small.
The spiritual, huge!'

445
00:47:33,118 --> 00:47:36,784
'Are those the drops of time,
that ring through your ears?'

446
00:47:38,993 --> 00:47:42,576
'Are these quivers
the beat of your heart?'

447
00:47:44,867 --> 00:47:48,618
'Are those the drops of time,
that ring through your ears?'

448
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:54,326
'Are these quivers
the beat of your heart?'

449
00:47:54,451 --> 00:47:57,493
'From when the war begins,
whatever may happen...'

450
00:47:57,618 --> 00:48:00,285
'...we need to be stubborn.
Just like children!'

451
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,243
'Look at the night sky!
And the shining stars!'

452
00:48:03,368 --> 00:48:06,076
'Let's head over there!
To this celestial garden!'

453
00:48:06,201 --> 00:48:09,034
'Dreams become realities,
with progress made every day!'

454
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:11,909
'From India to space,
we are astronomical!'

455
00:48:12,034 --> 00:48:14,784
'Running hard to reach our destination,
is our ambition!'

456
00:48:14,909 --> 00:48:17,909
'We swear upon our lives,
that we will return with success!'

457
00:48:18,034 --> 00:48:21,118
'While many wars lie ahead of us...'

458
00:48:21,243 --> 00:48:23,951
'...can a puny asteroid deter us?'

459
00:48:24,076 --> 00:48:28,909
'Obliterate it! Shut the doors!
And then, we wage war!'

460
00:48:29,909 --> 00:48:32,826
'When conflicts over language, religion
and ethnicity abound...'

461
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:35,743
'...will a falling sky
be the architect of our destruction?'

462
00:48:35,867 --> 00:48:38,201
'Halt it! End its journey!'

463
00:48:38,326 --> 00:48:41,201
'Only then,
shall we destroy ourselves!'

464
00:48:41,326 --> 00:48:42,784
'Foam?
-Small!'

465
00:48:42,909 --> 00:48:44,034
'Shore?
-Huge!'

466
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:45,535
'Footprint?
-Small!'

467
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,201
'Place?
-Huge!'

468
00:48:47,326 --> 00:48:48,535
'A falling...
-Heart!'

469
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,951
'When it rises...'

470
00:48:50,076 --> 00:48:51,493
'Distress?
-Small!'

471
00:48:51,618 --> 00:48:53,034
'Life is huge!'

472
00:48:54,993 --> 00:48:58,784
'Are those the drops of time,
that ring through your ears?'

473
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:04,451
'Are these quivers

'When dangerous forms
attack the Earth...'

475
00:49:19,493 --> 00:49:22,285
'...push the limits of energy,
we will!'

476
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:25,159
'When fearless hearts
band together...'

477
00:49:25,285 --> 00:49:28,034
'...delay the bells of death,
we will!'

478
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:32,201
'Can anything that a man does
to end the root of suffering...'

479
00:49:32,326 --> 00:49:33,826
'...be considered a sin?'

480
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:37,784
'If clouds do not steal water
from the sea...'

481

'...can there ever be any rain?'

482
00:49:39,826 --> 00:49:42,702
'Destiny, small.
Determination, huge.'

483
00:49:42,826 --> 00:49:45,451
'Obstacles, small.
Answers, large.'

484
00:49:45,576 --> 00:49:48,451
'Pain, small.
Path, huge.'

485

'The material, small.
The spiritual, huge!'

486
00:49:53,576 --> 00:49:57,034
'Are those the drops of time,
that ring through your ears?'

487
00:49:59,326 --> 00:50:02,951
'Are these quivers
the beat of your heart?'

488
00:50:05,243 --> 00:50:08,909
'Are those the drops of time,
that ring through your ears?'

489
00:50:11,201 --> 00:50:14,951
'Are these quivers
the beat of your heart?'

490
00:50:15,076 --> 00:50:17,867
'The clock relentlessly goes
"Tik! Tik! Tik"!'

491
00:50:17,993 --> 00:50:20,784

we will finish that story.'

493

you know we do it, quick and slick!'

'Take us to the shrine of victory,

498
00:50:40,743 --> 00:50:43,993
"Today, five highly trained astronauts
at ISRO, are set to leave..."

499
00:50:44,118 --> 00:50:48,368
"...in the 'Dhruva-1' spacecraft, from the
Sriharikota Space Research Centre."

500
00:50:49,118 --> 00:50:51,660
Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh.

501
00:52:40,714 --> 00:52:43,171
I have never even taken a flight abroad.

502
00:53:07,006 --> 00:53:08,297
Are you able to hear me?

503
00:53:16,255 --> 00:53:17,964
Who is this?

504
00:53:18,088 --> 00:53:20,755
How are you able to speak in this channel?

505
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,880
Your son Ravi, is with me.

506
00:53:25,006 --> 00:53:26,006
What are you saying?

507
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:27,130
Grandpa!

508
00:53:35,213 --> 00:53:39,880
Don't shout!
No one outside this channel can hear us.

509
00:53:44,006 --> 00:53:46,047
Your son wants to talk to you.

510
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,505
I'm really scared, dad!

511
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:53,047
Did you hear that?

512
00:53:53,171 --> 00:53:55,630
Who the hell are you?
What do you want?

513
00:54:01,589 --> 00:54:05,130
I need that missile!

514
00:54:09,547 --> 00:54:12,088
If I give you the missile,
40 million lives will be lost!

515
00:54:21,797 --> 00:54:27,130
Do you want to be a hero
and sacrifice your son?

516
00:54:46,422 --> 00:54:47,964
There is no doubt!

517
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:53,922
My son is important to me!

518
00:54:56,171 --> 00:54:58,047
I will steal it and give it to you.

519
00:57:18,297 --> 00:57:22,130
We have ten hours before we cross
the asteroid safety line.

520
00:57:22,255 --> 00:57:25,589
Dhruva-1 can reach
the target space station in two hours.

521
00:59:14,088 --> 00:59:15,630
Don't bloody puke!

522
00:59:24,755 --> 00:59:26,755
Here is the cabin uniform.
Get changed.

523
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,797
After we enter
their space station...

524
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:31,714
...it's up to you from there.

525
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:33,922
That's all I'm thinking about, Captain.

526
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:47,006
What are you doing over there?
-Sir, I'm so disoriented.

527
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:48,672
Here! Get changed!

528
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:21,672
Every problem appears small from here.

529
01:00:24,422 --> 01:00:28,964
No father in the world,
would be this far apart from his son.

530
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:17,047
I would rather use a diaper
than use this.

531
01:01:18,088 --> 01:01:20,171
Alright then!
Let me get down to task!

532
01:01:38,755 --> 01:01:40,672
That was the last bottle of liquor!

533
01:02:42,714 --> 01:02:44,047
Swathi!
Vasu is unconscious!

534
01:02:52,422 --> 01:02:54,422
Few people may faint
due to lack of gravity.

535
01:02:54,547 --> 01:02:56,589
Think there's high blood flow
to the brain.

536
01:02:56,714 --> 01:02:58,088
Let's take him to the sick bay.

537
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:17,171
Press this pack of glucose.

538
01:03:24,255 --> 01:03:27,422
You fainted due to excess blood flow
to your brain.

539
01:03:29,297 --> 01:03:30,547
Please take rest.

540
01:03:44,297 --> 01:03:45,463
Turn off your headphone.

541
01:03:52,505 --> 01:03:53,672
What are you doing, Vasu?

542
01:03:58,589 --> 01:03:59,755
Where are you going?

543
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,422
Dude!
Good Morning!

544
01:04:04,255 --> 01:04:05,422
Where are you both going?

545
01:04:12,839 --> 01:04:16,797
What are you doing in here?
-I'm going to cut the red and blue wires.

546
01:04:16,922 --> 01:04:18,130
Cut the wires?

547
01:04:20,338 --> 01:04:22,922
Once I do, the ship will lose
liquid hydrogen.

548
01:04:23,047 --> 01:04:25,171
And then?

549
01:04:25,297 --> 01:04:27,505
It is like fuel for the spacecraft.

550
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,463
We are going to empty the tank.

551
01:04:29,589 --> 01:04:32,630
Why are you doing it then?
-Just go and sit!

552
01:04:32,755 --> 01:04:35,839
Listen to me! It might go wrong.
-Do what I say! Now go!

553
01:04:35,964 --> 01:04:38,547
I'm talking to you!
Why are you doing this?

554
01:04:38,672 --> 01:04:40,088
Ravi has been kidnapped!

555
01:04:41,547 --> 01:04:42,922
By whom?

556
01:04:43,047 --> 01:04:47,922
I don't know who is behind it.
But he is no ordinary man!

557
01:04:50,422 --> 01:04:52,880
If I don't listen to him,
he will kill Ravi.

558
01:04:55,006 --> 01:04:58,964
Vasu, act like you are unconscious.

559
01:04:59,088 --> 01:05:02,630
They will take you to the sick bay
at the lower deck.

560
01:05:02,755 --> 01:05:07,297
Go there and do what I say
without asking any questions.

561
01:05:10,088 --> 01:05:11,255
I don't have a choice.

562
01:05:26,922 --> 01:05:29,171
Swathi, the fuel level
seems to be dropping down.

563
01:05:39,006 --> 01:05:40,171
The fuel tank is leaking!

564
01:05:51,797 --> 01:05:53,297
The controls aren't functioning!

565
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:01,380
Chief, the fuel level is dropping down!

566
01:06:10,422 --> 01:06:12,047
The ship isn't in our control!

567
01:06:17,088 --> 01:06:18,797
We are being pulled by some force!

568
01:08:42,971 --> 01:08:44,638
Can you hear me?
Please respond.

569
01:08:44,764 --> 01:08:45,846
Are you okay, Captain?

570
01:08:50,055 --> 01:08:51,180
Please respond.

571
01:08:51,305 --> 01:08:52,305
Chief!

572
01:08:58,888 --> 01:08:59,888
We are okay.

573
01:09:02,846 --> 01:09:05,430
Sorry, Chief.
Don't know where we went wrong.

574
01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:07,430
It's okay, Captain.

575
01:09:08,138 --> 01:09:10,347
There's no time for
"Sorry" or "Thank you".

576
01:09:10,472 --> 01:09:11,929
Let's think of what to do next.

577
01:09:23,929 --> 01:09:25,764
Have you thought this through?

578
01:09:25,888 --> 01:09:28,180
Forty million lives are at stake.

579
01:09:28,305 --> 01:09:30,221
There are four teams here.

580
01:09:30,347 --> 01:09:32,263
Each team seems to have its own motive.

581
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:36,388
The army wants to steal the missile
and stop the asteroid.

582
01:09:37,055 --> 01:09:39,929
The missile's owner doesn't want
to lose it at any cost.

583
01:09:40,055 --> 01:09:42,555
For the one who blackmails,
no matter what happens...

584
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,722
...to our country,
he needs the missile.

585
01:09:44,846 --> 01:09:46,263
The fourth team, is us.

586
01:09:49,305 --> 01:09:50,555
We should win!

587
01:10:02,055 --> 01:10:05,055
Chief, this is Dhruva-1,
reporting from the surface of the moon.

588
01:10:07,805 --> 01:10:10,096
The outer doors are open
to check the fuel leak.

589
01:10:11,597 --> 01:10:12,971
In this historic moment...

590
01:10:13,096 --> 01:10:15,846
...I'm proud to step on the moon.

591
01:10:15,971 --> 01:10:18,221
As the first Indian to step on the moon.

592
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:22,263
The first Indian to step on the moon...

593
01:10:22,388 --> 01:10:24,722
...is Captain D. Raghuram.

594
01:10:33,888 --> 01:10:34,888
Vasu!

595
01:10:50,013 --> 01:10:51,013
No.

596
01:10:52,597 --> 01:10:54,180
It is M. Vasu.

597
01:10:57,764 --> 01:11:00,055
Whoever it is,
it is great for our country, isn't it?

598
01:11:00,638 --> 01:11:02,055
He pushed me, Captain!

599
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:03,971
Everyone knows Neil Armstrong.

600
01:11:04,096 --> 01:11:06,388
The second and third person
to step on the moon...

601
01:11:06,513 --> 01:11:08,263
...are forgotten even by Google!

602
01:11:57,805 --> 01:12:00,555
Chief, the fuel wire has been cut.

603
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,055
That's impossible!

604
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:03,555
We don't know how it happened.

605
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:06,388
With the fuel we have,
we can run the engines only for an hour.

606
01:12:06,513 --> 01:12:09,096
The fuel will reach you
in another six hours, Captain.

607
01:12:09,221 --> 01:12:11,722
By then, the asteroid would be closer
to the safety line!

608
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,472
The time will not be sufficient.

609
01:12:19,388 --> 01:12:22,846
I don't understand why
he made me open the fuel tank.

610
01:12:23,846 --> 01:12:27,597
If the asteroid crosses the safety line,
while we're waiting...

611
01:12:27,722 --> 01:12:30,305
...then there is no point
in getting the missile.

612
01:12:32,013 --> 01:12:33,805
However you see it,
nothing can be done.

613
01:12:33,929 --> 01:12:35,138
We have to wait here.

614
01:12:35,263 --> 01:12:38,013
As if there's a fuel station nearby
to go and fill the tank!

615
01:12:40,096 --> 01:12:41,096
Yes, there is.

616
01:12:56,055 --> 01:12:58,888
Dhruva-2 is ready to be launched
immediately, with fuel.

617
01:12:59,555 --> 01:13:00,971
Let's not take any more chances.

618
01:13:03,347 --> 01:13:04,888
What happened, Vasu?

619
01:13:05,013 --> 01:13:08,638
Why don't we request fuel
from the target space station?

620
01:13:10,263 --> 01:13:11,680
Are you mad?

621
01:13:11,805 --> 01:13:13,221
Will you ask them for it?

622
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:16,472
No, Captain.
It might actually work.

623
01:13:16,597 --> 01:13:20,680
To them, we are just Indian astronauts
who have come for satellite maintenance.

624
01:13:27,096 --> 01:13:29,013
This is Dhruva-1, Indian spacecraft.

625
01:13:29,138 --> 01:13:31,680
We're here for satellite maintenance
and we've lost fuel.

626
01:13:31,805 --> 01:13:33,638
Requesting help for refueling.

627
01:13:33,764 --> 01:13:35,347
I'm sending in our co-ordinates.

628
01:13:39,388 --> 01:13:40,846
I'll put this message on a loop.

629
01:13:40,971 --> 01:13:42,764
Let's see if we get a reply.
-Go ahead.

630
01:13:52,597 --> 01:13:54,055
Oh God!

631
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:56,430
Don't know whether
God is above or below us.

632
01:14:10,096 --> 01:14:13,263
We have an entry point
into their space station.

633
01:14:16,472 --> 01:14:18,513
Dhruva-1 attempting unorthodox take off.

634
01:14:20,013 --> 01:14:21,805
Liquid hydrogen is dangerously low.

635
01:14:30,472 --> 01:14:32,013
Dhruva-1 taking off, Chief.

636
01:15:04,013 --> 01:15:06,430
Chief,
Dhruva-1's estimated time of arrival...

637
01:15:06,555 --> 01:15:08,680
...at the target space station
is 45 minutes.

638
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:35,472
I don't know why
a petty criminal from North Madras...

639
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:37,764
...did such a thing.

640
01:15:37,888 --> 01:15:39,430
But I definitely know...

641
01:15:39,555 --> 01:15:41,513
...that someone from our department...

642
01:15:41,638 --> 01:15:43,388
...is behind all this.

643
01:15:46,055 --> 01:15:48,305
But I don't know who it is.

644
01:15:51,221 --> 01:15:54,013
Shall we inform our department
about this?

645
01:15:54,138 --> 01:15:55,929
No need to disturb them now.

646
01:15:56,055 --> 01:15:58,555
For now, just closely observe
the three of them.

647
01:16:08,888 --> 01:16:12,138
Yakub Bhai, I'll get the missile
in another two days.

648
01:16:12,263 --> 01:16:14,430
Six buyers are waiting for this.

649
01:16:15,513 --> 01:16:19,555
But if it goes to certain buyers,
things will get dangerous.

650
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:22,680
I don't care who buys it
and for what reasons.

651
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,971
The expense for this thing...

652
01:16:26,096 --> 01:16:27,638
The loss of lives it brings...

653
01:16:27,764 --> 01:16:30,013
Knowing all this, I'm giving this to you.

654
01:16:30,138 --> 01:16:32,305
Whoever accepts the price I've quoted...

655
01:16:32,430 --> 01:16:33,846
...finish the deal with them.

656
01:16:45,555 --> 01:16:47,472
This boy is not eating at all.

657
01:16:48,472 --> 01:16:50,388
He won't die
if he doesn't eat for two days.

658
01:17:25,138 --> 01:17:26,764
Dhruva-1 requesting to dock.

659
01:23:23,805 --> 01:23:26,638
You thought you could fight like a thug
and escape from here?

660
01:23:26,764 --> 01:23:29,055
Don't you need a plan
before attempting anything?

661
01:24:54,650 --> 01:24:57,049
Don't forget to get me a spicy
Chicken rice and chilly manchurian

662
01:24:58,235 --> 01:24:59,526
Why were you so late?

663
01:24:59,651 --> 01:25:01,776
I was scared that I'd be doomed
in that box.

664
01:25:03,484 --> 01:25:05,151
Did you finish the job?

665
01:25:05,276 --> 01:25:08,776
Yeah, I placed the bug perfectly
in the mainframe system.

666
01:25:08,901 --> 01:25:11,734
You both didn't notice
that I wasn't here, right?

667
01:25:11,859 --> 01:25:14,318
I'm your Captain.
Tell me before doing anything.

668
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:17,318
You sound like the 'Captain'
who lost his deposit.

669
01:25:34,026 --> 01:25:35,526
We are in, dude.
-Good.

670
01:25:38,985 --> 01:25:40,235
To open this vault...

671
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:43,235
...we need Captain Lee's fingerprints
and his retinal scan.

672
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:46,734
Even with that,
if the missile is moved by an inch...

673
01:25:46,859 --> 01:25:48,901
...the alarm will go on.

674
01:25:49,026 --> 01:25:52,110
We have no way to bypass
this alarm system.

675
01:25:52,235 --> 01:25:53,235
That's the problem.

676
01:30:23,443 --> 01:30:24,443
I don't know, bro.

677
01:30:29,693 --> 01:30:32,193
You locked us in the room, didn't you?

678
01:30:32,318 --> 01:30:34,443
Then how can we get out from here?

679
01:30:42,276 --> 01:30:43,484
Alright then.

680
01:30:43,609 --> 01:30:44,651
Kill me!

681
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:48,901
Vasu!
-Hey dude.

682
01:31:11,901 --> 01:31:15,318
Even if I ask you to say it,
please don't do it, Vasu.

683
01:31:46,484 --> 01:31:47,734
I'll tell you!

684
01:31:47,859 --> 01:31:49,151
Don't, Vasu!

685
01:32:01,651 --> 01:32:02,651
In the Indian ship!

686
01:32:21,402 --> 01:32:22,943
I'll return the missile.

687
01:32:23,068 --> 01:32:24,693
Ask him to release all of us.

688
01:32:24,818 --> 01:32:27,193
He will give you the missile
if you release all of us.

689
01:34:02,567 --> 01:34:04,693
Flat nose punk!
You didn't expect this, right?

690
01:35:12,693 --> 01:35:17,026
No one enter the shuttle.
If you do, you won't make it back home.

691
01:35:22,235 --> 01:35:23,567
Tell them to note this down.

692
01:35:25,402 --> 01:35:28,402
89.8067 degrees North...

693
01:35:28,526 --> 01:35:32,026
...and 221.5285 degrees...
Vasu!

694
01:35:34,693 --> 01:35:40,734
89.8067 degrees North.
And 221.5285 degrees East.

695
01:35:47,151 --> 01:35:51,026
Take a step forward to the Indian ship,
you will not return to your country.

696
01:38:29,068 --> 01:38:30,526
Are they really spooked?

697
01:38:31,943 --> 01:38:33,734
Yes. They all are terrified.

698
01:38:33,859 --> 01:38:36,193
I am pretty scared out here, too.

699
01:38:36,318 --> 01:38:40,318
Be careful.
If you slip, you have to keep going.

700
01:38:40,443 --> 01:38:42,276
There is no limit to the universe, dude.

701
01:38:42,402 --> 01:38:44,484
Hey! Don't scare me!

702
01:40:01,859 --> 01:40:04,693
You thought you could fight like a thug
and escape from here?

703
01:40:04,818 --> 01:40:07,235
Don't you need a plan
before attempting anything?

704
01:40:51,193 --> 01:40:52,693
Listen carefully!

705
01:40:52,818 --> 01:40:55,985
Escape to our ship
before their confusions clear.

706
01:41:49,151 --> 01:41:51,276
Come on!

707
01:41:55,318 --> 01:41:56,318
Captain! Behind you!

708
01:41:57,693 --> 01:41:59,151
Come soon and close it!

709
01:42:11,068 --> 01:42:12,068
Undocking Dhruva-1.

710
01:42:22,776 --> 01:42:24,443
Vasu hasn't come yet, Captain.

711
01:42:24,567 --> 01:42:25,901
We do not have any time!

712
01:42:26,026 --> 01:42:28,859
With the fuel we have,
we can run the engine for fifteen minutes.

713
01:42:34,193 --> 01:42:36,235
Come on, Vasu!
-Come on, dude!

714
01:42:40,026 --> 01:42:41,026
Hey!
-Come soon!

715
01:42:58,985 --> 01:43:00,443
His oxygen tank is leaking!

716
01:43:16,734 --> 01:43:17,734
Hey Vasu!

717
01:43:48,985 --> 01:43:51,151
Yes!
Thank God.

718
01:44:47,901 --> 01:44:48,985
Dad!

719
01:45:11,693 --> 01:45:12,693
He has made it!

720
01:45:18,985 --> 01:45:19,985
Running Engine A.

721
01:45:21,526 --> 01:45:22,567
Running Engine B.

722
01:46:08,854 --> 01:46:10,812
He needs an injection of adrenalin.
Hurry!

723
01:46:55,712 --> 01:46:56,712
Buddy!

724
01:47:25,629 --> 01:47:27,670
We've got the missile!

725
01:47:27,795 --> 01:47:29,379
The Chief will be glad
to hear this!

726
01:47:47,338 --> 01:47:51,670
Almost time for you
to hand over the missile to me.

727
01:47:51,795 --> 01:47:54,338
From here,
how can I give this missile to you?

728
01:47:54,462 --> 01:47:55,462
Dhruva-2!

729
01:47:55,587 --> 01:47:59,296
That's why I made you empty the fuel tank.

730
01:47:59,420 --> 01:48:01,254
What about my son?

731
01:48:01,379 --> 01:48:04,338
The minute you hand over
the missile to Dhruva-2...

732
01:48:04,462 --> 01:48:10,171
...your son will be safe with his grandpa
at the Army guest house in Munnar.

733
01:48:21,212 --> 01:48:22,629
Dhruva-2 is ready for docking.

734
01:49:18,503 --> 01:49:19,754
I have done what you asked.

735
01:49:32,629 --> 01:49:34,004
In another ten minutes...

736
01:49:34,129 --> 01:49:36,379
...your son will be safe
at the Army guest house.

737
01:49:37,670 --> 01:49:41,296
Do you know why I chose you
for this mission?

738
01:49:41,420 --> 01:49:43,129
Your love for your son.

739
01:49:47,004 --> 01:49:51,629
Neither you nor I are responsible
for those 40 million deaths.

740
01:49:51,754 --> 01:49:53,462
It was purely an act of nature.

741
01:49:53,587 --> 01:49:55,379
We couldn't stop it.
Simple as that.

742
01:51:01,379 --> 01:51:03,754
We have visual contact
with the asteroid's crater.

743
01:51:18,712 --> 01:51:21,795
Ten minutes left
to cross the safety line.

744
01:51:21,921 --> 01:51:24,338
Load the missile now, Swathi.
-Yes, Captain!

745
01:51:44,462 --> 01:51:45,545
The missile is missing!

746
01:51:50,296 --> 01:51:52,296
Only eight minutes
to cross the safety line!

747
01:51:55,962 --> 01:51:57,462
Is the missile ready for launch?

748
01:52:02,087 --> 01:52:03,587
What are you saying, Captain?

749
01:52:24,046 --> 01:52:25,338
Vasu's responsible for this.

750
01:52:29,712 --> 01:52:31,921
Look at the images
I'm sending over right now.

751
01:52:32,046 --> 01:52:33,171
He cut the fuel wire!

752
01:52:40,921 --> 01:52:43,629
He hid in plain sight
and betrayed our mission.

753
01:52:45,046 --> 01:52:47,212
He lies and cheats for a living.

754
01:52:47,338 --> 01:52:49,379
What else could we expect from him?

755
01:52:49,503 --> 01:52:52,129
Even if he is bad,
how could the missile leave the ship?

756
01:53:09,296 --> 01:53:11,503
Only one minute away
from the safety line.

757
01:53:13,587 --> 01:53:15,046
We came so close
to stopping it!

758
01:53:53,795 --> 01:53:55,212
It has crossed the safety line.

759
01:53:59,670 --> 01:54:01,087
The lives of 40 million people!

760
01:54:11,879 --> 01:54:13,795
Some of our families...

761
01:54:13,921 --> 01:54:15,171
...are in the target areas.

762
01:54:16,462 --> 01:54:18,254
We won't share details of the mission.

763
01:54:18,379 --> 01:54:21,046
Can you permit us
to speak to them one last time?

764
01:54:41,296 --> 01:54:44,296
Your son has been released, Vasu.

765
01:55:39,338 --> 01:55:41,338
Apologies for the delay
in telling you this.

766
01:55:41,462 --> 01:55:43,338
Missile is locked
and ready to launch!

767
01:55:45,670 --> 01:55:48,712
The asteroid hasn't crossed
the safety line. We have two minutes!

768
01:56:12,921 --> 01:56:14,587
In another ten minutes...

769
01:56:14,712 --> 01:56:18,171
...your son will be safe
at the Army guest house.

770
01:56:18,296 --> 01:56:19,795
Thank you, Vasu.

771
01:56:19,921 --> 01:56:21,795
If he's talking through this channel...

772
01:56:21,921 --> 01:56:24,629
...no one else must know of our plan,
until this is over.

773
01:56:33,129 --> 01:56:37,420
This is the exact design model,
of the missile that you have to steal.

774
01:56:38,420 --> 01:56:40,962
In space, one cannot tell the difference
in weight...

775
01:56:41,087 --> 01:56:44,171
...between a duplicate and the original.

776
01:56:47,795 --> 01:56:49,879
Load the missile now, Swathi.
-Yes, Captain!

777
01:58:54,587 --> 01:58:56,754
The suspense would've killed
the folks below!

778
02:02:43,587 --> 02:02:44,587
Dad!

779
02:03:00,087 --> 02:03:02,087
Look in your pocket!

780
02:04:16,503 --> 02:04:19,004
On our team's behalf,
here's a medal for you.

781
02:04:20,670 --> 02:04:21,670
Look in your pocket.

782
02:04:42,462 --> 02:04:43,962
After all, he is my son!
