We had a tree come through
the picture window last night,

right in my studio.

wouldn't you know?

233

But with funds being
cut every year,

236
00:10:27,605 --> 00:10:29,291

00:32:47,774 --> 00:32:49,126
We've gotta discuss how
we're gonna stop that thing

659
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,543
getting in here.

660
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:52,712
Wait, what do you
mean getting in?

661
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,422
You shut the loading door.

662
00:32:54,446 --> 00:32:59,202
Yeah, but the entire front
of the store is plate glass.

663
00:33:01,955 --> 00:33:03,207
Jesus Christ.

664
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,696
Um, listen.

665
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,600
That guy who came in here
with the bloody nose.

666
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,833
They're, they're...

667
00:33:27,857 --> 00:33:29,585
We saw tentacles.

668
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:31,753
It ain't going very well, is it?

669
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:32,611
Nah uh.

670
00:33:34,322 --> 00:33:35,133
You, what?

671
00:33:35,157 --> 00:33:36,157
Come here.

672
00:33:37,242 --> 00:33:38,076
Come here.

673
00:33:40,578 --> 00:33:41,414
Tell him.

674
00:33:43,874 --> 00:33:44,875
It's true.

675
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:53,068
Tentacles.

676
00:33:53,092 --> 00:33:53,926
Yeah.

677
00:34:02,935 --> 00:34:05,188
Um, gentlemen, I'm sorry,

678
00:34:06,356 --> 00:34:08,459
I'm just not that stupid.

679
00:34:08,483 --> 00:34:10,211
I mean, what do you take me for?

680
00:34:10,235 --> 00:34:11,236
I'm shocked.

681
00:34:12,404 --> 00:34:13,923
I'm shocked.

682
00:34:13,947 --> 00:34:15,675
I'm shocked, it's
pretty tasteless

683
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:16,801
using what's happening here

684
00:34:16,825 --> 00:34:18,052
to try to make me
look like an idiot.

685
00:34:18,075 --> 00:34:19,470
No, no, no, that's not
what's going on here.

686
00:34:19,494 --> 00:34:22,099
Look, come back to the
loading dock, okay?

687
00:34:22,123 --> 00:34:23,350
I'll show you.

688
00:34:23,374 --> 00:34:26,437
Blood, and a chuck of
tentacle on the floor.

689
00:34:26,461 --> 00:34:27,563
No.

690
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:28,647
No, what do you mean no?

691
00:34:28,671 --> 00:34:29,815
Uh, no.

692
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,525
We've got real problems
to deal with here,

693
00:34:31,549 --> 00:34:35,196
and this pathetic
attempt at a joke

694
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,364
has gone far enough.

695
00:34:36,388 --> 00:34:38,116
Mr. Norton.

696
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,909
What reason could
we possibly have-

697
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:41,451
Oh, please, please!

698
00:34:41,476 --> 00:34:42,620
This is payback for the lawsuit

699
00:34:42,644 --> 00:34:44,039
that I filed against
him last year,

700
00:34:44,063 --> 00:34:46,207
and you guys are backing him up.

701
00:34:46,231 --> 00:34:47,625
So, winning wasn't enough, huh?

702
00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:50,128
You wanted to
humiliate me some more.

703
00:34:50,152 --> 00:34:52,339
Show me a rubber snake
while these hicks

704
00:34:52,363 --> 00:34:53,716
stand around laughing
their asses off.

705
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,717
Watch who you're calling a hick.

706
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:55,550
Myron, Myron, Myron!

707
00:34:55,574 --> 00:34:56,427
Hey, hey, fuck-

708
00:34:56,451 --> 00:34:57,719
- Mr. Norton, I swear.

709
00:34:57,743 --> 00:34:59,972
You've got us all wrong.

710
00:34:59,996 --> 00:35:04,292
You're not too crazy about
out of towners, are ya?

711
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,980
I only spend my money
and I pay my taxes here,

712
00:35:07,003 --> 00:35:10,423
and I've seen you
talking behind my back.

713
00:35:12,926 --> 00:35:15,012
How y'all stick together?

714
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:19,326
Well, don't I feel foolish?

715
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:21,788
I actually thought you were
being kind to me today.

716
00:35:21,812 --> 00:35:23,413
Well, thanks for
setting me straight.

717
00:35:23,436 --> 00:35:24,915
And I'm glad that tree
fell on your boathouse,

718
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:25,750
you know that?

719
00:35:25,774 --> 00:35:26,791
Glad.

720
00:35:26,816 --> 00:35:27,710
Smashed it in pretty
good, didn't it?

721
00:35:27,733 --> 00:35:28,920
Fantastic.

722
00:35:28,944 --> 00:35:29,754
Now all of y'all, just
stay out of my way-

723
00:35:29,779 --> 00:35:31,214
- I know you're scared, man.

724
00:35:31,238 --> 00:35:32,632
I'm scared too.

725
00:35:32,656 --> 00:35:34,050
Lives are at stake around here.

726
00:35:34,074 --> 00:35:35,510
- David, I-
- Okay, my son's life.

727
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:36,845
Now, I need you.

728
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:40,431
Brent, please, get your
head out of your ass.

729
00:35:40,455 --> 00:35:41,557
All right?

730
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,850
I'll drag you back
there if I have to.

731
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:43,850
Come here.

732
00:35:43,876 --> 00:35:44,937
- David, get your-
- No, I need-

733
00:35:44,961 --> 00:35:46,855
- Get your God damn
hands off of me!

734
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:48,357
I'll sue your ass again!

735
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,358
Sue your ass!

736
00:35:49,382 --> 00:35:51,442
And this time you'll go to jail.

737
00:35:51,466 --> 00:35:52,820
This man assaulted me.

738
00:35:52,844 --> 00:35:53,655
He assaulted me.

739
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:55,322
You were witness to it.

740
00:35:55,346 --> 00:35:56,281
This man's crazy, he's crazy.

741
00:35:56,305 --> 00:35:57,139
No.

742
00:35:58,141 --> 00:35:59,034
He isn't.

743
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:01,395
I wish he was, but he isn't.

744
00:36:03,063 --> 00:36:05,041

745
00:36:05,064 --> 00:36:07,794
You want to come back here?

746
00:36:07,818 --> 00:36:09,379
There's something
that you need to hear,

747
00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:11,464

For Christ's sake, Ollie.

Do you want me to report you?

754
00:36:20,206 --> 00:36:22,393
You want to lose your job?

755
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:23,353
Look, I'm gonna be
taking down names,

756
00:36:23,377 --> 00:36:24,645
starting with you.

757
00:36:24,669 --> 00:36:26,397
And I am prepared to
file a police report.

758
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,982
Fine, Bud, write
down your names.

759
00:36:28,006 --> 00:36:29,358
I will.

760
00:36:29,382 --> 00:36:33,404
And in the meantime, shut
the fuck up and listen.

761
00:36:33,428 --> 00:36:34,864
This is Mr. David Drayton.

762

You need to hear
what he's got to say

if you're thinking
about leaving.

Go hang out with the
ladies, all right?

765

00:36:43,104 --> 00:36:44,106

Okay.

This is how it is.

Now, I don't know
what this mist is,

770
00:36:53,241 --> 00:36:54,802
but there are things in
it, and they're dangerous,

771
00:36:54,826 --> 00:36:55,762

772
00:36:55,786 --> 00:36:57,513

773
00:36:57,537 --> 00:36:59,265
That's exactly right.

00:36:59,288 --> 00:37:01,017
[MIKE] What kinda things?

775
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:03,018
I never saw it, it
happened too fast.

776
00:37:03,043 --> 00:37:05,188
I got knocked down.

777
00:37:05,212 --> 00:37:07,648
Five us went back
in the loading dock.

778
00:37:07,672 --> 00:37:10,092
It was Jim, Myron, Ollie, me,

779
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,448
Norm, the bag boy.

780
00:37:14,472 --> 00:37:15,282
And we opened the door-

781
00:37:15,306 --> 00:37:17,034
- Where's Norm?

782
00:37:17,057 --> 00:37:20,871
So Norm could go out and
clear the vent for the generator.

783
00:37:20,894 --> 00:37:22,748
Something came out of
the mist and took him.

784
00:37:22,772 --> 00:37:23,709
Took him?

785
00:37:23,732 --> 00:37:25,150
What do you mean?

786
00:37:26,735 --> 00:37:27,879
Just killed him.

787
00:37:27,903 --> 00:37:29,463
I mean, dragged him off.

788
00:37:29,487 --> 00:37:33,325
Now, guys, I don't know
what these things are.

789
00:37:35,452 --> 00:37:37,621

No, it's a lie, you know.

All these people do is
just lie each other up.

It's a pile of shit.

797
00:37:55,182 --> 00:37:56,743
Of course it's a lie,
of course it's a lie,

it's lunacy!

And from the look of it,

800
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:01,372
the tentacles are coming
out of the beer cans.

801

All right, Bud, don't
take our word for it.

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,275

I will have pulled my weight,

823
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,358
I will have earned my
place at your side,

824
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:29,947
I will have served a
purpose here on this earth.

825
00:40:29,971 --> 00:40:31,388
Hello?

826
00:40:41,065 --> 00:40:43,277
(SNIFFLES)

827
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:48,197
What?

828
00:40:48,823 --> 00:40:51,136
I just need to use the bathroom.

829
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:51,994
Oh.

830
00:40:53,162 --> 00:40:55,497
Okay, well then, have at it.

831
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:03,505
Ma'am, I just want you
to know that it's okay,

832
00:41:05,716 --> 00:41:07,486
being scared, I mean.

833
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:11,740
And, well, if you need
a friend, you know,

834
00:41:11,764 --> 00:41:12,907
someone to talk to-

835
00:41:12,931 --> 00:41:15,602
- I have a friend, God up above.

836
00:41:16,978 --> 00:41:18,831
I talk to him every day.

837
00:41:18,855 --> 00:41:21,083
Don't you condescend me.

838
00:41:21,108 --> 00:41:21,960
I'm sorry?

839
00:41:21,984 --> 00:41:22,837
Not ever.

840
00:41:22,861 --> 00:41:25,380
You don't mock me.

841
00:41:25,404 --> 00:41:28,257
That's not what I was doing.

842
00:41:28,281 --> 00:41:30,594
Look, I tell you what.

843
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:32,762
The day I need a
friend like you,

844
00:41:32,786 --> 00:41:34,181
I'll just have
myself a little squat

845
00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:35,623
and shit one out.

846
00:41:40,045 --> 00:41:41,271
(AMANDA GASPS)

847
00:41:41,295 --> 00:41:43,273
Maybe you do believe this,

848
00:41:43,297 --> 00:41:46,611
maybe they're not lies,
they're delusions, whatever.

849
00:41:46,635 --> 00:41:49,405
The fact remains the
evidence here is flimsy,

850
00:41:49,429 --> 00:41:50,323
it's bordering on ludicrous.

851
00:41:50,348 --> 00:41:52,451
Hey, this isn't a court room.

852
00:41:52,475 --> 00:41:53,452
You're not arguing a case,

853
00:41:53,476 --> 00:41:54,578
and you're doing
nothing but damage

854
00:41:54,602 --> 00:41:55,745
talking the way you are.

855
00:41:55,769 --> 00:41:56,871
And you can throw
as much cow's blood

856
00:41:56,895 --> 00:41:58,039
around the loading
dock as you want to,

857
00:41:58,063 --> 00:41:59,666
you still haven't fooled anyone.

858
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:00,627
[OLLIE] Leave it alone, David.

859
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:01,960
You can't convince some people

860
00:42:01,984 --> 00:42:04,588
there's a fire even when
their hair is burning.

861
00:42:04,612 --> 00:42:06,173
Denial is a powerful thing.

862
00:42:06,197 --> 00:42:07,342
Well, keep talking.

863
00:42:07,366 --> 00:42:08,302
I'll have no part of it,

864
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:11,136
nor would any thinking person.

865
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,805
Keep thinking, Mr. Lawyer.

866
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:16,518
There's no defense
against the will of God.

867
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:19,270
There's no court
of appeals in hell.

868
00:42:19,294 --> 00:42:21,231
There's no defense here either,

869
00:42:21,255 --> 00:42:23,775
not even with all the
fertilizer in the world.

870
00:42:23,799 --> 00:42:26,110
Not even if you stack
it as high as you can,

871
00:42:26,133 --> 00:42:28,780
it's still just bags
of shit, isn't it?

872
00:42:28,804 --> 00:42:30,950
Those of you who want to
discuss this thing rationally

873
00:42:30,974 --> 00:42:34,745
to find a means of rescue
are welcome to join me.

874
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:39,315
Those who want to stack dog
food, knock yourselves out.

875
00:42:43,152 --> 00:42:45,382
We got those windows
taped up as best we could,

876
00:42:45,405 --> 00:42:46,675
it should help.

877
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:48,284
Yeah, I think so.

878
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:52,412
Duct tape and dog food bags.

879
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:55,642
That bad?

880
00:42:55,666 --> 00:42:56,977
It's not good.

881
00:42:57,001 --> 00:43:00,940
There's none so blind as
those who will not see.

882
00:43:00,964 --> 00:43:02,607
Open your eyes.

883
00:43:02,632 --> 00:43:04,985
Let the scales fall away.

884
00:43:05,009 --> 00:43:07,177
This has all been written.

885
00:43:08,638 --> 00:43:10,640
Revelations, chapter 15.

886
00:43:12,058 --> 00:43:14,495
"And the temple was
filled with smoke

887
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:18,000
from the glory of God,
and from his power.

888
00:43:18,024 --> 00:43:19,875
And no one could
enter the temple

889
00:43:19,899 --> 00:43:22,712
until the seven plagues
of the seven angels

890
00:43:22,736 --> 00:43:24,214
were completed."

891
00:43:24,238 --> 00:43:26,090
Well, what are you saying?

892
00:43:26,115 --> 00:43:27,467
What are you proposing?

893
00:43:27,491 --> 00:43:32,265
That we all prepare
to meet our maker.

894
00:43:32,289 --> 00:43:35,017
Oh, prepare to meet shit.

895
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:37,519
Lady, your tongue must
be hung in the middle

896
00:43:37,543 --> 00:43:39,647
so that it could
waggle at both ends.

897
00:43:39,671 --> 00:43:41,566
No, the end time has come.

898
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:43,609
Not in flames, but in mist.

899
00:43:43,634 --> 00:43:44,528
Come here!

900
00:43:44,552 --> 00:43:45,695
Easy, man!

901
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:47,655
How about if your
ass prepares to meet

902
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:49,866
my size 10 work
boot, how bout that?

903
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:51,618
Hey, there's no call for that.

904
00:43:51,642 --> 00:43:53,953
Yeah, Myron, please,
calm your friend down.

905
00:43:53,977 --> 00:43:56,081
[MRS. CARMODY] I'm trying to
save your soul, you stupid man.

906
00:43:56,105 --> 00:43:57,291
Doubters will doubt till
the end.

907
00:43:57,315 --> 00:43:58,733
Don't worry, Billy, it's okay.

908
00:43:59,108 --> 00:44:03,422
A monstrosity did pull
that poor boy away.

909
00:44:03,446 --> 00:44:05,174
Things in the mist.

910
00:44:05,197 --> 00:44:06,925
Do you doubt?

911
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:07,985
Do you?

912
00:44:09,453 --> 00:44:10,454
Then go out.

913
00:44:11,538 --> 00:44:13,850
Go out and say "How do you do?"

914
00:44:13,874 --> 00:44:15,208
Shut up, lady!

915
00:44:16,793 --> 00:44:18,021
For God's sakes!

916
00:44:18,044 --> 00:44:18,939
Look, you'll have to stop now,

917
00:44:18,963 --> 00:44:20,023
you're scaring the children.

918
00:44:20,047 --> 00:44:22,108
They should be scared.

919
00:44:22,131 --> 00:44:23,801
Oh yes, they should.

920
00:44:25,428 --> 00:44:28,074
Their beautiful,
pure little minds

921
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:31,326
have been corrupted
with lies, lies.

922
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:34,771
All this talk of a
modern God, or no God.

923
00:44:36,606 --> 00:44:38,376
There is one God.

924
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,253
The God of the Israelites.

925
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:42,880
And he is a stern
and vengeful God.

926
00:44:42,904 --> 00:44:45,507
And we have been mocking
him far too long.

927
00:44:45,532 --> 00:44:49,304
And now he demands
retribution and blood.

928
00:44:49,328 --> 00:44:52,516
It is time to
declare yourselves.

929
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:55,687
Take sides, the
saved and the damned.

930
00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:00,065
Read the Good Book, it
calls for expiation, blood!

931
00:45:00,089 --> 00:45:01,024
What?

932
00:45:01,048 --> 00:45:01,882
Blood.

933
00:45:03,343 --> 00:45:05,113
Little Normie was first,

934
00:45:05,137 --> 00:45:08,366
and now God calls
the rest of us.

935
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:09,784
The bill is due.

936
00:45:09,808 --> 00:45:11,369
It must be paid.

937
00:45:11,393 --> 00:45:14,497
As Abraham prepared to
sacrifice his only son

938
00:45:14,521 --> 00:45:16,082
to prove his love for God, so...

939
00:45:16,105 --> 00:45:19,277
- (LOUD SLAP)
- Enough.

940
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,842
Another down payment.

941
00:45:25,866 --> 00:45:27,428
A few more pennies in the jar.

942
00:45:27,452 --> 00:45:28,721
Now that's nice.

943
00:45:28,745 --> 00:45:30,556
See, I can't smack her,
but it's okay for you?

944
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,599
I'm sorry everybody, but
this lady's perspective

945
00:45:32,623 --> 00:45:34,978
is a little too Old
Testament for my tastes.

946
00:45:35,002 --> 00:45:37,564
They'll come for you.

947
00:45:37,587 --> 00:45:40,423
Maybe tonight when
darkness comes.

948
00:45:41,508 --> 00:45:43,236
They'll come tonight.

949
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,238
And they'll take someone else.

950
00:45:45,261 --> 00:45:46,990
See if they don't.

951
00:45:47,014 --> 00:45:50,185
And when they do,
you will cry to God,

952
00:45:51,352 --> 00:45:54,998
and you will beg Mother
Carmody to show you the way.

953
00:45:55,022 --> 00:45:56,190
That's fine.

954
00:45:57,317 --> 00:45:59,545
Until then if you don't shut up,

955
00:45:59,569 --> 00:46:01,756
I'll wrap this tape
around your mouth.

956
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:04,091
You just try it, Ollie Weeks.

957
00:46:04,115 --> 00:46:05,367
And you, bitch.

958
00:46:06,785 --> 00:46:09,287
You hit me again, if you dare.

959
00:46:11,831 --> 00:46:16,253
You'll be on your knees to
me before this is through.

960
00:46:21,258 --> 00:46:22,819
Those of you who aren't
locals should know

961
00:46:22,843 --> 00:46:27,950
that Mrs. Carmody is known
in town for being unstable.

962
00:46:27,974 --> 00:46:28,767
No shit.

963
00:46:29,893 --> 00:46:31,978
What was your first clue?

964
00:46:36,858 --> 00:46:38,418
Hi.

965
00:46:38,443 --> 00:46:40,087
Sup, little dude?

966
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:41,923
How come your friends
don't come get us?

967
00:46:41,947 --> 00:46:44,885
They got tanks and stuff, right?

968
00:46:44,909 --> 00:46:46,512
Why can't you just call 'em?

969
00:46:46,536 --> 00:46:47,805
Phones don't work.

970
00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:49,555
But don't you got like a radio?

971
00:46:49,579 --> 00:46:51,099
Hey champ, what's going on?

972
00:46:51,123 --> 00:46:53,018
I want their friends
to come rescue us.

973
00:46:53,042 --> 00:46:53,977
They would if they could, pal,

974
00:46:54,002 --> 00:46:55,479
they're stuck here just like us.

975
00:46:55,503 --> 00:46:56,563
- But-
- Shh.

976
00:46:56,587 --> 00:46:58,525
Guys, we could use
a hand over there.

977
00:46:58,549 --> 00:46:59,400
Yeah, sure thing.

978
00:46:59,425 --> 00:47:01,402
Troop, off your asses.

979
00:47:01,426 --> 00:47:02,278
You all right?

980
00:47:02,302 --> 00:47:04,279
I don't like that scary lady.

981
00:47:04,303 --> 00:47:06,741
Oh, man, I don't either.

982
00:47:06,765 --> 00:47:08,743
But you know what?

983
00:47:08,766 --> 00:47:10,686
Maybe she's scared too.

984
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,353
You think?

985
00:47:13,857 --> 00:47:15,942
You think Mommy's okay?

986
00:47:17,525 --> 00:47:18,360
Billy...

987
00:47:21,573 --> 00:47:23,676
I'm sorry about the
times I was bad to her.

988
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,794
Oh, hey.

989
00:47:25,743 --> 00:47:28,596
Mommy loves you very much,

990
00:47:28,831 --> 00:47:30,582
and I bet she's fine.

991
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,979
And I promise you, I'm
gonna do everything I can

992
00:47:36,004 --> 00:47:37,840
to get us back to her.

993
00:47:38,883 --> 00:47:39,884
- Okay?
- Okay.

994
00:47:41,218 --> 00:47:42,219
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

995
00:47:44,139 --> 00:47:46,408
So we can use the charcoal fluid

996
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,993
and the mops to make torches,

997
00:47:48,017 --> 00:47:50,245
and we've got knives
and stuff, God knows.

998
00:47:50,268 --> 00:47:51,956
This may be a silly
question, Bud,

999
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:56,377
but do you happen to
have a gun in the store?

1000
00:47:56,401 --> 00:47:57,211
Here?

1001
00:47:57,235 --> 00:47:58,088
No.

1002
00:47:58,112 --> 00:47:59,714
Please, this isn't Los Angeles.

1003
00:47:59,738 --> 00:48:02,163
I've got a shotgun in my truck.

1004
00:48:02,949 --> 00:48:04,594
I could try for it if you want.

1005
00:48:04,618 --> 00:48:05,470
Oh God, I don't
think that would be

1006
00:48:05,494 --> 00:48:06,762
a good idea, Mr. Cornell.

1007
00:48:06,786 --> 00:48:07,622
Hold on.

1008
00:48:10,416 --> 00:48:13,084
This gun, uh, my husband's idea.

1009
00:48:14,169 --> 00:48:16,064
He's away on business a lot.

1010
00:48:16,087 --> 00:48:17,107
It's not even loaded.

1011
00:48:17,131 --> 00:48:19,884
Ain't much use unloaded, ma'am.

1012
00:48:23,555 --> 00:48:24,949
You know how to use that?

1013
00:48:24,972 --> 00:48:27,034
Well, I shot it once
on a pistol range,

1014
00:48:27,058 --> 00:48:29,036
hit the target a few times.

1015
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,896
So, we've got a gun.

1016
00:48:32,105 --> 00:48:34,167
Anybody know how to shoot it?

1017
00:48:34,191 --> 00:48:35,585
Well, I mean?

1018
00:48:35,608 --> 00:48:36,443
I do.

1019
00:48:39,113 --> 00:48:39,948
You?

1020
00:48:41,365 --> 00:48:42,532
Ollie, please.

1021
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:50,392
Some target shooting.

1022
00:48:50,416 --> 00:48:52,185
State champion in '94.

1023
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:54,022
Hey, you're crazy
if you go out there.

1024
00:48:54,046 --> 00:48:55,105
Let us pass!

1025
00:48:55,129 --> 00:48:56,315
Let us pass, please!

1026
00:48:56,339 --> 00:48:57,650
Let's just talk
this thing through.

1027
00:48:57,674 --> 00:48:59,193
[NORTON] We have, and we
made our decision.

1028
00:48:59,217 --> 00:49:00,528
We're leaving.

1029
00:49:00,552 --> 00:49:01,905
Hey, Mr. Mackey's gonna
barbecue some chicken

1030
00:49:01,929 --> 00:49:02,823
on the gas grill.

1031
00:49:02,847 --> 00:49:04,074
Why don't we just sit down and-

1032
00:49:04,098 --> 00:49:05,407
- What, and let you
keep on talking?

1033
00:49:05,432 --> 00:49:06,660
No, I've been in far
too many court rooms

1034
00:49:06,684 --> 00:49:07,744
to fall for that.

1035
00:49:07,768 --> 00:49:09,537
You've already psyched out
half a dozen of my people already.

1036
00:49:09,561 --> 00:49:10,622
Your people?

1037
00:49:10,646 --> 00:49:11,499
What kind of talk is that?

1038
00:49:11,523 --> 00:49:12,916
They are people, that's all.

1039
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,292
Now, listen everyone.

1040
00:49:14,316 --> 00:49:17,504
We are experiencing
some kind of disaster.

1041
00:49:17,529 --> 00:49:19,131
I don't know whether
it's man-made or natural,

1042
00:49:19,155 --> 00:49:23,386
but I do know that it's
definitely not supernatural,

1043
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:24,387
or Biblical.

1044
00:49:24,411 --> 00:49:25,596
And no offense, Mrs. Carmody,

1045
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,139
but the only way we're
gonna help ourselves

1046
00:49:27,163 --> 00:49:28,665
is to seek rescue.

1047
00:49:31,085 --> 00:49:32,420
We're going out.

1048
00:49:34,714 --> 00:49:35,816
Brent, look.

1049
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,733
I'm not discussing
this any further.

1050
00:49:36,757 --> 00:49:37,734
I know.

1051
00:49:37,758 --> 00:49:40,529
I just want to ask a favor.

1052
00:49:40,553 --> 00:49:42,698
Tie this around your waist.

1053
00:49:42,722 --> 00:49:43,907
What for?

1054
00:49:43,931 --> 00:49:47,829
It'll let us know you
got at least 300 feet.

1055
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:48,937
I'll do it.

1056
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:51,915
Are you throwing in with them?

1057
00:49:51,938 --> 00:49:52,750
Me?

1058
00:49:52,774 --> 00:49:54,168
No thanks.

1059
00:49:54,192 --> 00:49:56,838
I think your man there's a
little too tightly wound.

1060
00:49:56,862 --> 00:49:58,965
Gonna get somebody killed.

1061
00:49:58,988 --> 00:50:02,302
I'm thinking we could use
that shotgun of yours.

1062
00:50:02,326 --> 00:50:04,637
I saw where you parked
when I pulled in.

1063
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:05,722
Red pickup, right?

1064
00:50:05,746 --> 00:50:07,055
Far entrance?

1065
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,810
Son, you've got brass balls.

1066
00:50:09,834 --> 00:50:15,024
The shells are in the glove
compartment, drive it back.

1067
00:50:15,048 --> 00:50:16,275
All right.

1068
00:50:16,299 --> 00:50:18,027
Just see they're
paying out this line.

1069
00:50:18,051 --> 00:50:20,571
Line's up, I'll cut her loose.

1070
00:50:20,594 --> 00:50:21,822
Just so you understand.

1071
00:50:21,846 --> 00:50:23,097
Yeah.

1072
00:50:30,522 --> 00:50:33,209
You sure there's no way I
can talk you out of this?

1073
00:50:33,233 --> 00:50:36,755
David, there's
nothing out there.

1074
00:50:36,778 --> 00:50:38,590
Nothing in the mist.

1075
00:50:38,614 --> 00:50:41,009
What if you were wrong?

1076
00:50:41,034 --> 00:50:45,080
Then I guess the joke
would be on me after all.

1077
00:50:53,046 --> 00:50:55,567
We're gonna send back help.

1078
00:50:55,591 --> 00:50:58,510
You'll die out
there, all of you.

1079
00:51:10,857 --> 00:51:12,085
Hey, crazy lady.

1080
00:51:12,109 --> 00:51:13,711
I believe in God too,

1081
00:51:13,735 --> 00:51:16,546
I just don't think he's
the bloodthirsty asshole

1082
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:17,963
you make him out to be.

1083
00:51:17,988 --> 00:51:19,717
Well, you take that
up with the devil

1084

when you run into him.

1085

at your leisure.

1086

Well, let's strike out
toward the center of town.

1089
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,255
Keep goin'.

1090
00:52:30,107 --> 00:52:30,941

1315
01:06:25,866 --> 01:06:27,844
I want my mommy.

1316
01:06:27,868 --> 01:06:28,702
I know.

1317
01:06:29,829 --> 01:06:31,974
I know, of course you do.

1318
01:06:31,998 --> 01:06:32,809
Shh.

1319
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:34,560
I want to go home.

1320
01:06:34,584 --> 01:06:35,668
Just sleep.

1321
01:06:37,211 --> 01:06:40,632
Everything will be
better in the morning.

1322
01:06:45,533 --> 01:06:47,256
I think he likes you.

1323
01:06:49,344 --> 01:06:52,018
Well, I hate that I
had to lie to him.

1324
01:06:53,395 --> 01:06:54,915
You have kids?

1325
01:06:54,939 --> 01:06:56,118
No.

1326
01:06:56,482 --> 01:07:01,301
I always wanted to, but things
haven't been working out.

1327
01:07:03,391 --> 01:07:06,199
Right now I'm thinking
maybe that's for the best.

1328
01:07:07,827 --> 01:07:11,516
I saw creatures fly
into the store tonight,

1329
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:13,291
they shouldn't exist.

1330
01:07:14,417 --> 01:07:17,351
I keep thinking I'm gonna
wake up in a rubber room.

1331
01:07:18,506 --> 01:07:20,608
You're not alone in that.

1332
01:07:20,632 --> 01:07:22,582
We're all right there with you.

1333
01:07:23,553 --> 01:07:25,671
This isn't gonna end, is it?

1334
01:07:28,145 --> 01:07:29,400
[OLLIE] David.

1335
01:07:30,351 --> 01:07:32,770
It's Joe, he's getting worse.

1336
01:07:51,582 --> 01:07:52,416
Joe.

1337
01:07:54,252 --> 01:07:57,022
How you holdin' up, partner?

1338
01:07:57,046 --> 01:07:59,299
[JOE] David, is that you?

1339
01:08:00,632 --> 01:08:03,320
Yeah, pal, how are doin'?

1340
01:08:03,344 --> 01:08:05,906
It's bad, he's bad.

1341
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:09,034
I didn't know anything
could hurt like this.

1342
01:08:09,058 --> 01:08:15,676
If you guys can't help me,
you gotta end it, okay?

1343
01:08:17,776 --> 01:08:20,112
Ollie's got that gun, right?

1344
01:08:21,655 --> 01:08:22,466
Right?

1345
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:23,925
No, no way.

1346
01:08:23,949 --> 01:08:26,721
[JOE] You can't fuck with
me on this, bro.

1347
01:08:26,745 --> 01:08:28,889
Not with me like this.

1348
01:08:28,913 --> 01:08:29,829
I'll do it.

1349
01:08:30,956 --> 01:08:32,709
Just give me the gun!

1350
01:08:34,628 --> 01:08:35,605
We're not there yet, okay?

1351
01:08:35,629 --> 01:08:36,463
Please!

1352
01:08:37,964 --> 01:08:39,132
Joe, listen.

1353
01:08:40,426 --> 01:08:41,260
Pal.

1354
01:08:42,594 --> 01:08:43,905
We're gonna work something out,

1355
01:08:43,928 --> 01:08:45,698
I just need you to hang
in a little longer, okay?

1356
01:08:45,722 --> 01:08:47,057
Can you do that?

1357
01:08:51,062 --> 01:08:53,397
Stay with him, I'll be back.

1358
01:08:55,776 --> 01:08:58,462
Hattie, I need to
go to the bathroom,

1359
01:08:58,486 --> 01:09:00,237
will you watch Billy?

1360
01:09:01,781 --> 01:09:02,615
Hattie?

1361
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:21,153
See anything?

1362
01:09:21,177 --> 01:09:24,656
The last of those bugs
went away about four.

1363
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,847
Dawn's coming.

1364
01:09:26,849 --> 01:09:28,285
What's on your mind?

1365
01:09:28,309 --> 01:09:29,227
It's Joe.

1366
01:09:31,104 --> 01:09:32,873
If we don't get him on
some serious antibiotics

1367
01:09:32,897 --> 01:09:34,209
he's gonna die of infection.

1368
01:09:34,233 --> 01:09:36,544
Plus he needs painkillers
in the worst way.

1369
01:09:36,568 --> 01:09:40,714
All we've got here is
liquor and aspirin.

1370
01:09:40,738 --> 01:09:43,260
You thinking about going
to the pharmacy next door?

1371
01:09:43,284 --> 01:09:45,220
Irene Reppler says
they've got Silvadene.

1372
01:09:45,244 --> 01:09:47,222
You know, the stuff
they use in burn wards.

1373
01:09:47,246 --> 01:09:48,348
She knows where they keep it.

1374
01:09:48,372 --> 01:09:49,600
Slow down.

1375
01:09:49,624 --> 01:09:51,143
You can't actually be
thinking of doing this.

1376
01:09:51,167 --> 01:09:53,436
I'm also thinking beyond that.

1377
01:09:53,459 --> 01:09:55,855
We have to get out of here.

1378
01:09:55,879 --> 01:09:57,066
I mean, permanently.

1379
01:09:57,090 --> 01:09:58,150
Why?

1380
01:09:58,174 --> 01:09:59,360
We've got plenty to eat.

1381
01:09:59,384 --> 01:10:00,820
And what happens when
one of those things

1382
01:10:00,844 --> 01:10:02,572
decides to break
through this window?

1383
01:10:02,596 --> 01:10:03,698
I'm talking one of the big ones,

1384
01:10:03,722 --> 01:10:05,325
like the one that killed Norm.

1385
01:10:05,349 --> 01:10:07,118
Yeah, then the
flaming torch idea

1386
01:10:07,142 --> 01:10:08,286
didn't work so well, did it?

1387
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:11,646
We almost burned the
goddamn store down.

1388
01:10:16,527 --> 01:10:17,695
It's Hattie.

1389
01:10:24,327 --> 01:10:26,138
Here?

1390
01:10:26,162 --> 01:10:28,099
Gently now, gently.

1391
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:29,624
One, two, three!

1392
01:10:39,718 --> 01:10:42,113
I don't know how long
she was there like that,

1393
01:10:42,136 --> 01:10:43,907
lying there next to us.

1394
01:10:43,931 --> 01:10:46,577
I thought she was sleeping.

1395
01:10:46,601 --> 01:10:48,578
I got my 4-wheel drive.

1396
01:10:48,602 --> 01:10:50,331
It's out there.

1397
01:10:50,355 --> 01:10:52,875
You're talking about leaving?

1398
01:10:52,899 --> 01:10:56,670
Well, we should hit
the pharmacy first.

1399
01:10:56,694 --> 01:10:58,006
We gotta bring back
supplies for the injured.

1400
01:10:58,030 --> 01:11:00,300
I mean, if we don't, Joe
Eagleton's gonna die,

1401
01:11:00,324 --> 01:11:02,344
and we can't let that happen.

1402
01:11:02,368 --> 01:11:03,785
But after that...

1403
01:11:04,619 --> 01:11:06,306
Look, my Land Cruiser
can hold eight people.

1404
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:08,183
I say we drive south as
far as the fuel takes us

1405
01:11:08,207 --> 01:11:10,486
and try to keep
clear of this mist.

1406
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:12,259
That's it?

1407
01:11:12,795 --> 01:11:14,315
That's the plan?

1408
01:11:14,339 --> 01:11:15,358
That's what I got.

1409
01:11:15,382 --> 01:11:16,691
No, you can't mean it.

1410
01:11:16,714 --> 01:11:17,942
Not after what happened
to Norton and his group.

1411
01:11:17,966 --> 01:11:19,152
No, no, no.

1412
01:11:19,176 --> 01:11:20,653
Amanda, think.

1413
01:11:20,677 --> 01:11:23,074
Norton got over 200
feet from this store,

1414
01:11:23,098 --> 01:11:24,700
that's how much rope played out.

1415
01:11:24,724 --> 01:11:27,244
I'm parked half that
distance from here.

1416
01:11:27,268 --> 01:11:29,247
But who knows how far
this mist has spread.

1417
01:11:29,271 --> 01:11:30,748
It could be the entire
eastern seaboard.

1418
01:11:30,772 --> 01:11:32,958
Yeah, it could be the whole
world for all we know,

1419
01:11:32,982 --> 01:11:36,463
wouldn't make us any
less dead, now would it?

1420
01:11:36,487 --> 01:11:39,216
We have 1 gun, how many rounds?

1421
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,216
We got 10 left.

1422
01:11:40,241 --> 01:11:41,510
10 rounds, Jesus.

1423
01:11:41,534 --> 01:11:43,636
Okay, so 10.

1424
01:11:44,162 --> 01:11:46,223
Want another reason to
get the hell outta here?

1425
01:11:46,247 --> 01:11:47,798
I'll give you the best one.

1426
01:11:48,499 --> 01:11:49,332
Her.

1427
01:11:50,501 --> 01:11:52,271
Mrs. Carmody.

1428
01:11:52,295 --> 01:11:55,108
She's our very own Jim Jones.

1429
01:11:55,132 --> 01:11:56,525
I'd like to leave
before people start

1430
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:57,693
drinking the Kool-Aid.

1431
01:11:57,717 --> 01:11:59,112
He's right.

1432
01:11:59,136 --> 01:12:01,114
The flakier people get, the
better she's gonna look.

1433
01:12:01,138 --> 01:12:02,198
No, I don't buy that.

1434
01:12:02,222 --> 01:12:03,908
It's obvious she's nuts.

1435
01:12:03,931 --> 01:12:05,201
Look, a few people, maybe.

1436
01:12:05,225 --> 01:12:06,036
But-

1437
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:07,037
No, I count 4.

1438
01:12:07,061 --> 01:12:07,872
She's preaching
to 'em right now.

1439
01:12:07,896 --> 01:12:09,331
By noon, she'll have 4 more.

1440
01:12:09,355 --> 01:12:11,959
By tomorrow night, when
those things come back,

1441
01:12:11,983 --> 01:12:13,167
she'll have a congregation,

1442
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:15,337
and then we can
start worrying about

1443
01:12:15,361 --> 01:12:18,465
who she's gonna sacrifice
to make it all better.

1444
01:12:18,489 --> 01:12:19,323
Hm?

1445
01:12:20,283 --> 01:12:21,284
You, Amanda?

1446
01:12:22,286 --> 01:12:23,680
My little boy?

1447
01:12:23,704 --> 01:12:25,306
[DAN] He's right.

1448
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:28,684
You don't have much faith
in humanity, do you?

1449
01:12:28,708 --> 01:12:29,853
None whatsoever.

1450
01:12:29,877 --> 01:12:31,354
I can't accept that.

1451
01:12:31,378 --> 01:12:34,065
People are basically
good, decent.

1452
01:12:34,089 --> 01:12:36,359
My God, David, we're
a civilized society.

1453
01:12:36,383 --> 01:12:37,945
Sure, as long as the
machines are working

1454
01:12:37,969 --> 01:12:39,280
and you can dial 9-1-1,

1455
01:12:39,304 --> 01:12:40,947
but you take those things away,

1456
01:12:40,971 --> 01:12:42,657
you throw people in the dark,

1457
01:12:42,681 --> 01:12:46,495
you scare the shit outta
them, no more rules.

1458
01:12:46,519 --> 01:12:48,247
You'll see how
primitive they get.

1459
01:12:48,271 --> 01:12:50,958
If you scare people
badly enough,

1460
01:12:50,982 --> 01:12:53,670
you can get 'em to do anything.

1461
01:12:53,694 --> 01:12:57,673
They'll turn to whoever
promises a solution.

1462
01:12:57,697 --> 01:12:58,716
Or whatever.

1463
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:00,802
Ollie, please, back me up here?

1464
01:13:00,826 --> 01:13:02,636
I wish I could.

1465
01:13:02,661 --> 01:13:05,891
As a species, we're
fundamentally insane.

1466
01:13:05,915 --> 01:13:07,225
Put more than two
of us in a room,

1467
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:09,102
we pick sides and start
dreaming up reasons

1468
01:13:09,126 --> 01:13:10,794
to kill one another.

1469
01:13:11,921 --> 01:13:14,524
Why'd you think we invented
politics and religion?

1470
01:13:14,548 --> 01:13:17,135
Oh, Jesus, that's just wrong.

1471
01:13:18,053 --> 01:13:20,990
Look, nobody has to
decide anything now, okay?

1472
01:13:21,014 --> 01:13:23,767
First things first,
the pharmacy.

1473
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:27,079

there were other dimensions.

Other worlds all around us,

1875

and how they wanted to
try and make a window.

1876

could look through

the other side.
