he isn'<i>t</i> a drug trafficker?

96

Mrs Moncada,
why don't you go and look around?

you came to say.

00:12:12,402 --> 00:12:14,488
'but it turns out the folks in New York

160
00:12:14,613 --> 00:12:18,533
'were just as head over heels
for cocaine as the folks down south.

161
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:21,578
'And while there were
1 .8 million people in Miami,

162
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:23,914
'there were seven million
in New York City.

163
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:28,543
'As much as the Cali guys loved money
and the finer things in life,

164
00:12:28,669 --> 00:12:30,712
'they hated the wrong kind of attention.

165
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,714
'For the "Gentlemen of Cali"

166
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:35,467
'it was about appearing
like legitimate businessmen.

00:12:35,592 --> 00:12:37,344
'And business was good.

00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:40,430
'But that didn'<i>t</i> mean
that it couldn'<i>t</i> get better.'

169
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:43,809
(In Spanish) So tell me, Mrs Moncada,
why did you come all this way?

170
00:12:43,934 --> 00:12:48,230
To help you kill the man
who murdered my husband and brother

171
00:12:48,355 --> 00:12:51,942
by offering very important information
that only I possess.

172
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:55,237
- And what is this information?
- Targets.

173
00:12:55,362 --> 00:12:57,614
The location of every one of his labs.

174
00:12:57,739 --> 00:13:03,787
Going after Pablo's infrastructure
will cripple him, force him to surface.

175
00:13:03,912 --> 00:13:08,792
We put a bullet in his head
and we take turns shitting on him.

176
00:13:09,418 --> 00:13:12,462
What's valuable isn'<i>t</i> knowing
what Pablo has,

177
00:13:12,587 --> 00:13:14,298
but what he wants to acquire.

178
00:13:14,923 --> 00:13:16,967
Because that's where he'll be next.

179
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:20,554
Pablo is picking apart your operation
piece by piece.

180
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:23,807
Knowing what remains
tells us where he's going.

181
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,688
You want me to tell you
where my labs are?

182
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:34,901
Well... let's say...

183
00:13:35,736 --> 00:13:42,034
that I share that information. Hmm?
What happens to my labs?

184
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:44,494
Oh, Judy.

185
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:47,331
Your sense of vengeance
is heart-warming.

186
00:13:47,456 --> 00:13:50,375
Kiko would be so proud of your priorities.

187
00:13:51,251 --> 00:13:53,670
Mmh. You're right.

188
00:13:54,296 --> 00:13:56,757
He would be very proud of me.

189
00:13:56,882 --> 00:14:00,802
I built the business by his side, Pacho.

190
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:04,222
I'm from the Medellín cartel.
I know what I am.

191
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:09,311
I don'<i>t</i> need bullshit art
on my wall to prove any different.

192
00:14:09,436 --> 00:14:11,396
Wait, wait, <i>wait.</i>

193
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:14,066
Hold on.

194
00:14:14,983 --> 00:14:20,697
Confronting Pablo directly
won'<i>t</i> help us maintain a low profile.

195
00:14:21,615 --> 00:14:22,699
But...

196
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:30,123
what if the Search Bloc were to learn
the location of your labs?

197
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,127
What good is it if he's arrested?

198
00:14:34,836 --> 00:14:38,590
He's already shown
he can fuck us from prison.

199
00:14:38,715 --> 00:14:41,051
This won'<i>t</i> end with Pablo in a cell.

200
00:14:41,885 --> 00:14:43,595
You think the police will kill him?

201
00:14:45,013 --> 00:14:48,225
There is one officer
that seems particularly determined.

202
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,311
And President Gaviria
has arranged for his return.

203
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:55,399
(Steve) 'This was one thing that the
Cali guys and the DEA could agree on.

204
00:14:55,524 --> 00:14:58,693
'As controversial
as Colonel Carrillo's methods were,

205
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:01,738
'he was the only guy
that Escobar was afraid of.

206
00:15:01,863 --> 00:15:03,990
'And returning command
of Search Bloc to him

207
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:06,201
'was exactly what we needed.'

208
00:15:06,326 --> 00:15:10,247
The president has offered us every
available resource to defeat Escobar.

209
00:15:10,372 --> 00:15:12,374
All we have to do now
is manage it properly.

210
00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:14,876
So I'm still gonna rely
on intelligence from you.

211
00:15:15,627 --> 00:15:18,505
But we're gonna do things
a little bit differently.

212
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:22,259
No more large-scale operations. Search
Bloc goes back to small-scale tactics.

213
00:15:22,384 --> 00:15:23,385
Amen.

214
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,595
Stealth operations,
surprise raids, that sort of thing.

215
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,681
We change the game.

216
00:15:27,806 --> 00:15:30,976
But there's one thing
that we need to do first. Trujillo.

217
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:35,897
(In Spanish) Assemble the Search Bloc
outside. I want 100 men and six trucks.

218
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:38,733
- Tell them we're moving out. Got it?
- On it, Colonel.

219
00:15:39,985 --> 00:15:45,031
(In English) A hundred men?
That's not exactly small-scale tactics.

220
00:15:45,907 --> 00:15:48,785
First thing is,
we let Pablo know that we're back.

221
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:52,456
(Sirens chirping)

222
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:57,669
(Steve) 'Now you can bet that
the second a convoy of a hundred men

223
00:15:57,794 --> 00:16:00,130
'and six marked police trucks
leave that base,

224

'that Escobar's army of spotters
would be burning up the phone lines

225

- 'just to tell Escobar all about <i>it.'</i>
- (Phone rings)

226
00:16:06,136 --> 00:16:09,347
- (In Spanish) What's up?
- They just left. Four motorcycles,

227
00:16:09,473 --> 00:16:13,393
'five pickups, and a truck.
It's a large convoy.'

228
00:16:14,478 --> 00:16:17,355
(Steve) 'And you'd be right.
But that was the point.

229
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,067
'You see, these spotters
made it impossible for us to operate

230

'in the secrecy we required.

231
00:16:23,403 --> 00:16:25,363
'So we needed to blind them.

'And the first step to blinding someone
is getting them to open their eyes.'

233

(In Spanish) They're heading to
Barrio Escobar. It's going to get crowded.

234
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:36,750

It's probably this rooftop here.

235

we could pick them up,

(Steve) 'I guess you could say
the second part of Carrillo's plan

that the sheriff was back in <i>town.</i>

Look. Look up there.

There's something weird happening.
What do you see?

246
00:17:30,554 --> 00:17:32,806
- (Juan Pablo) They're clouds.
- (Pablo) Not clouds.

247
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:35,684
Because clouds form shapes.

248

Sir, sorry to interrupt,
but it's very important.

- (Sighs) What's going on?
- Carrillo is back.

253

And he's here in Medellín.

254
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:09,384
Hmm.

255
00:18:11,386 --> 00:18:12,929
What else?

256
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:20,145
That son of a bitch
filled Barrio Escobar with police and...

257
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:24,149
he pissed on your mural, sir.

until you reached Barrio Pablo Escobar.
We captured six radio transmissions.

But we haven'<i>t</i> pinpointed
the exact location.

264

- No, sir.
- So our best bet

265
00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:13,281
is to corner each of these buildings.
This time, we hit the ground.

266

(In Spanish) Trujillo, load up
six unmarked cars, four men per car.

Instruct them to leave in 20-minute
intervals to avoid attention. Clear?

- Yes, Colonel.
- OK.

Where are you going?

- Good evening.
- Yes?

Would you allow me to search
your house? We're looking for...

287

Stop! Stop, boy! Stop!

You think you're slick?
Why were you running?

291
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,716
- No! What did I do wrong?
- You tell me what you did.

292
00:21:22,076 --> 00:21:23,703
Do you know who I am?

293
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,291
My name is Colonel Horacio Carrillo.

294
00:21:29,292 --> 00:21:34,756
Last week,
30 police officers were murdered.

295
00:21:34,881 --> 00:21:38,426
- Those pigs probably deserved it.
- (Murmurs in English) Shut up, kid.

296

Many of them were my friends.

guiding murderers with radios...

are assassins themselves.

00:21:52,732 --> 00:21:57,195
I hope after this encounter,
you'll reconsider

300

working with someone
who thinks he's above the law.

(Carrillo cocks pistol)

302
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:11,000
What? Am I supposed
to shit my pants in fear?

303
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:14,045
No.

304
00:22:20,218 --> 00:22:21,886
(Carrillo)
Do I make myself clear?

305
00:22:22,011 --> 00:22:23,596
I want you to tell your friends,

306
00:22:23,721 --> 00:22:27,100
that this is what happens
when you work for Pablo Escobar!

307
00:22:50,123 --> 00:22:51,249
Take it.

308
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,710
Take it.

309
00:23:01,217 --> 00:23:03,219
Tell them this is for Pablo.

310
00:23:08,808 --> 00:23:10,143
Remember what you saw.

311
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,566
And know what will happen to you
if I see you on a rooftop.

312
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:18,401
You can leave.

313
00:23:19,986 --> 00:23:21,321
Leave!

314
00:23:41,174 --> 00:23:45,219
So, what book shall we read
before bed tonight?

315
00:23:45,345 --> 00:23:46,888
"The Witch".

316
00:23:47,013 --> 00:23:48,640
No, my love. No scary stories.

317
00:23:48,765 --> 00:23:51,309
"The Witch"? What's that?
I don'<i>t</i> know <i>it.</i>

318
00:23:51,434 --> 00:23:53,978
Dad reads it to us. Right, Dad?

319
00:23:54,103 --> 00:23:57,315
- The bad witch and the good witch?
- (Juan Pablo) Yes.

320
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,359
Not "The Witch", Pablo.

321
00:23:59,484 --> 00:24:02,320
I don'<i>t want</i> any more scary stories
in this house.

322
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:10,495
Love, take your sister
and brush your teeth.

323
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,288
And go straight to bed.

324
00:24:14,415 --> 00:24:17,126
(Pablo)
Listen, where's my kiss?

325
00:24:17,877 --> 00:24:19,295
Good night.

326
00:24:19,837 --> 00:24:23,383
- Good night, my love.
- Straight to bed, Manuela, please.

327
00:24:28,388 --> 00:24:30,264
(Dishes clattering)

328
00:24:40,942 --> 00:24:44,112
- I heard a scary story, Pablo.
- (Hermilda) Tata.

329
00:24:45,113 --> 00:24:47,615
The man who killed Gustavo
is back in Medellín.

330
00:24:48,491 --> 00:24:50,159
Is that story true?

331
00:24:52,328 --> 00:24:53,955
Yes.

332
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,920
Does that sound like the government
is trying to negotiate? Huh?

333
00:25:05,258 --> 00:25:06,551
Good night.

334
00:25:17,937 --> 00:25:19,230
Tata.

335
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,609
Someone has to tell you
how things are, Pablo.

336
00:25:26,696 --> 00:25:28,865
That man is here to kill you.

337
00:26:01,522 --> 00:26:03,399
I'm scared, Pablo.

338
00:26:07,737 --> 00:26:09,781
I promise you one thing:

339
00:26:10,782 --> 00:26:14,619
if things get out of hand
and I can'<i>t</i> control <i>it...</i>

340
00:26:15,578 --> 00:26:17,246
we'll leave the country.

341
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,126
OK?

342
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:39,352
(In English)
Javi, where are the fucking spotters?

343
00:26:39,477 --> 00:26:42,271
Carrillo went a different way.
He, uh... he cut them loose.

344
00:26:42,396 --> 00:26:44,190
Oh, we're letting people go now?

345
00:26:45,024 --> 00:26:47,068
Yeah, Murphy, we're letting people go.

346
00:26:48,111 --> 00:26:49,695
And what does that mean?

347
00:26:49,821 --> 00:26:52,949
- Don'<i>t</i> worry about it, man.
- Hey, fucking talk to me.

348
00:26:53,074 --> 00:26:55,827
- Let go of my fucking arm.
- What the fuck happened?

349
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,999
Carrillo put a gun to the kid's head
and he pulled the trigger.

350
00:27:03,793 --> 00:27:05,586
To make a fucking point.

351
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:10,133
We good now?

352
00:27:12,593 --> 00:27:14,637
(Engine starts)

353
00:27:14,762 --> 00:27:16,305
Yeah, we're good.

354
00:27:21,102 --> 00:27:23,646
(♪ Up-tempo Latin music playing)

355
00:27:23,771 --> 00:27:26,858
- (In Spanish) Seen this woman?
- No.

356
00:27:28,151 --> 00:27:30,278
She works at the market.

357
00:27:31,904 --> 00:27:33,197
Sweetheart?

358
00:27:37,368 --> 00:27:38,911
- Are you sure?
- No.

359
00:27:47,253 --> 00:27:48,546
(La Quica sighs)

360
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,632
Nobody's seen the bitch.

361
00:27:52,466 --> 00:27:53,843
I'm pissed off, brother.

362
00:27:58,014 --> 00:27:59,557
(Sighs)

363
00:28:02,393 --> 00:28:04,854
Let's go for some ice cream.

364
00:28:04,979 --> 00:28:06,189
Something cold.

365
00:28:06,314 --> 00:28:07,899
(Starts engine)

366
00:28:17,491 --> 00:28:18,951
(Raps on door)

367
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:25,875
(In English) I'd like to talk to you
about what happened tonight.

368
00:28:27,251 --> 00:28:30,338
- What do you think happened?
- I know I got left behind on purpose.

369
00:28:30,463 --> 00:28:31,839
For your own best interest.

370
00:28:31,964 --> 00:28:34,800
You don'<i>t</i> know a goddamn thing
about my best interest.

371
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:38,221
Murphy, what happens out there
isn'<i>t</i> pretty for everyone.

372
00:28:38,346 --> 00:28:40,056
- But it is for Peña?
- You're not Peña.

373
00:28:40,181 --> 00:28:42,266
- 'Cause I'm a damn gringo.
- Because I trust him.

374
00:28:42,391 --> 00:28:43,976
Why don'<i>t</i> you try me?

375
00:28:45,061 --> 00:28:47,563
This fight against Escobar,
you want to win it.

376
00:28:47,688 --> 00:28:51,025
These guys aren'<i>t</i> fighting
by the same rules, so why should we?

377
00:28:53,027 --> 00:28:55,780
- You know what that means?
- Oh, I do.

378
00:28:56,781 --> 00:29:01,619
So whether this is about protecting me
or protecting you, stop icing me out.

379
00:29:05,706 --> 00:29:06,958
(Door opens)

380
00:29:12,546 --> 00:29:14,882
(Woman speaks Spanish)
You were different this time.

381
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:24,392
I always know when my clients
are trying to forget something.

382
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:30,356
You know what I do to relax?

383
00:29:32,608 --> 00:29:35,027
- I write.
- You write?

384
00:29:37,947 --> 00:29:40,658
- What do you write?
- Letters.

385
00:29:40,783 --> 00:29:42,910
For my family, but I never send them.

386
00:29:44,328 --> 00:29:45,955
It's good to forget.

387
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:01,846
What do you want to forget?

388
00:30:08,102 --> 00:30:09,812
Why don'<i>t</i> you stop?

389
00:30:13,607 --> 00:30:15,109
Why don't you?

390
00:30:31,042 --> 00:30:32,793
(Men murmur in Spanish)

391
00:30:38,632 --> 00:30:40,926
(Velasco)
Welcome, brother.

392
00:30:42,428 --> 00:30:43,763
This way.

393
00:30:55,691 --> 00:30:57,651
- What is your name?
- David.

394
00:30:57,777 --> 00:31:02,156
- I'm Pablo. Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you, too.

395
00:31:02,281 --> 00:31:03,532
Follow me.

396
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:09,038
They told me you like soccer.

397
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:13,376
- I play defence.
- Of course.

398
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,253
Those are the real men.

399
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:22,176
You're very brave, David.

400
00:31:24,303 --> 00:31:26,180
I'm sorry for what you witnessed.

401
00:31:26,972 --> 00:31:30,059
The people we're fighting
are very bad people.

402
00:31:30,184 --> 00:31:32,812
Tell me about the man who did that.

403
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,567
He said this bullet is for you.

404
00:31:51,914 --> 00:31:54,667
I need you to do one last favour for me.

405
00:31:56,585 --> 00:31:58,712
It's very important.

406
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,298
You think you can do it?

407
00:32:08,055 --> 00:32:09,807
Thank you, David.

408
00:32:10,975 --> 00:32:13,269
(Phone ringing)

409
00:32:15,146 --> 00:32:16,188
Peña.

410
00:32:16,313 --> 00:32:19,817
(In Spanish)
'Agent Peña. This is Don Berna.

411
00:32:19,942 --> 00:32:23,070
'I have a proposition
you might be interested in.'

412
00:32:24,947 --> 00:32:26,699
What a surprise.

413
00:32:32,538 --> 00:32:35,082
What's up, Peña?
Are you expecting anyone else?

414
00:32:35,207 --> 00:32:37,835
No. Are you?

415
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,337
No, it's not necessary.

416
00:32:40,463 --> 00:32:43,632
Everywhere I go in this town,
I'm surrounded by friends.

417
00:32:43,757 --> 00:32:47,761
Sit down. Sit so you can taste
the best coffee in Medellín.

418
00:32:47,887 --> 00:32:51,474
Doña Luz! Bring my friend a coffee.

419
00:32:52,641 --> 00:32:55,019
You have something
other than coffee for me?

420
00:32:57,188 --> 00:33:00,900
Look, Agent, I'm not one of those
street-corner informants

421
00:33:01,025 --> 00:33:04,028
that you slip a few gringo dollars
for a tip. No, sir.

422
00:33:04,153 --> 00:33:05,571
Then why are we here?

423
00:33:12,244 --> 00:33:15,748
Agent, you and I
are like the snake and the <i>cat.</i>

424
00:33:16,957 --> 00:33:19,960
If the snake has the chance,
it will kill the <i>cat.</i>

425
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:23,339
And if the cat has the chance,
it will kill the snake.

426
00:33:24,548 --> 00:33:29,470
But there are times
when they see a big rat,

427
00:33:29,595 --> 00:33:31,889
and they both want to eat it.

428
00:33:33,974 --> 00:33:35,601
(In English)
This is Moncada's biggest lab.

429
00:33:35,726 --> 00:33:39,271
It'll have to be inventoried
before it's dismantled and moved.

430
00:33:39,396 --> 00:33:40,814
How you know that?

431
00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:44,818
- One of my Cl's.
- Hell of a tip.

432
00:33:44,944 --> 00:33:46,320
It's a hell of a Cl.

433
00:33:46,445 --> 00:33:48,489
Look, you want Escobar's men,
there they are.

434
00:33:48,614 --> 00:33:50,824
- Let's do it.
- All right.

435
00:34:02,044 --> 00:34:05,089
(♪ Rap music playing inside)

(In English) Get up! Move! Move!
(Murmurs indistinctly)

439
00:35:22,499 --> 00:35:23,917
Get up!

440

Gato!

441

(In Spanish) No, no, no!

442
00:35:28,547 --> 00:35:32,259
Calm down. OK, relax.
Don'<i>t</i> kill <i>me...</i> (Grunts)

Detaining the prisoners.

446
00:35:41,435 --> 00:35:43,729
(In English)
Your Cl hooked us a pretty big fish.

447
00:35:43,854 --> 00:35:45,105
Yeah, he's a winner.

448
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,274
(In Spanish)
We captured about 45 of them.

449
00:35:48,025 --> 00:35:50,152
I wonder if he'll give us Escobar.

450
00:35:50,277 --> 00:35:52,488
I don'<i>t</i> know.
We'll see what Carrillo gets out of him.

451
00:35:52,613 --> 00:35:54,698
Yeah. We'll see.

452
00:35:58,035 --> 00:36:02,414
Carrillo told me that he talked to you.
He thinks he can trust you.

453
00:36:03,082 --> 00:36:04,792
Yeah, he can.

454
00:36:06,627 --> 00:36:09,088
- That's not what I mean.
- Ahh.

455
00:36:10,506 --> 00:36:11,590
(In English) Let's go.

456
00:36:12,675 --> 00:36:14,885
I'm a big boy. I can handle <i>it.</i>

457
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:20,641
Yeah.

458
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:45,708
(In Spanish) Approaching.

459
00:36:55,509 --> 00:36:57,177
We're locking you up.

460
00:36:57,302 --> 00:36:58,470
Move it!

461
00:36:58,595 --> 00:37:01,223
- (In English) Got anything out of him?
- Something.

462
00:37:01,348 --> 00:37:04,059
Not everything. Are you coming?

463
00:37:07,396 --> 00:37:08,814
I'm in, yeah.

464
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:50,147
- (In Spanish) Hello, Valeria.
- Pablo.

465
00:37:51,565 --> 00:37:56,403
- I didn't realise you'd be here.
- I wanted to be sure it went well.

466
00:37:56,528 --> 00:37:59,198
People need to hear the truth, right?

467
00:37:59,323 --> 00:38:01,325
Yes, it's important.

468
00:38:02,242 --> 00:38:05,829
They forced this boy
to watch his friend get shot.

469
00:38:05,954 --> 00:38:09,583
When the country hears this story,
they'll turn on that son of a bitch

470
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:12,211
who's murdering children
for the Americans.

471
00:38:13,712 --> 00:38:17,424
Well... that's what I hope.

472
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,137
I'm glad you came.

473
00:38:23,597 --> 00:38:25,766
It's good to see you again.

474
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:37,528
Are all eyes still on you?

475
00:38:39,947 --> 00:38:41,573
Except yours.

476
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:52,501
(Pablo sighs)

477
00:38:54,336 --> 00:38:55,754
Let's begin.

478
00:38:57,589 --> 00:38:58,924
Yes.

479
00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:01,134
- (Valeria) 'How old are you?'
- (David) 'Ten.'

480
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:04,012
I understand you're quite a soccer player.

481
00:39:04,137 --> 00:39:05,430
(Chuckles)

482
00:39:05,556 --> 00:39:08,350
Thank you for being brave enough
to tell us your story, David.

483
00:39:09,476 --> 00:39:13,021
Tell me, who were the men who
brought you to the building that day?

484
00:39:13,146 --> 00:39:15,065
They were Search Bloc policemen.

485
00:39:16,525 --> 00:39:18,735
(Valeria) 'You know
why they took you there?'

486
00:39:18,861 --> 00:39:21,738
(David) 'He said he wanted
to send a message to other kids.'

487
00:39:21,864 --> 00:39:24,283
(Valeria) 'Who is "he"?
Do you remember his name?'

488
00:39:24,408 --> 00:39:26,285
(David) 'Colonel Carrillo.'

489
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,328
Relax, gentlemen, everything's fine.

490
00:39:29,121 --> 00:39:31,790
- Where are you taking us?
- Bogotá.

491
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:36,461
You're going to jail
until this gets resolved.

492
00:39:36,587 --> 00:39:40,924
But look... if you help me,
I can help you.

493
00:39:42,009 --> 00:39:46,680
Give me Pablo, or Blackie
or someone else, then I'll help you.

494
00:39:46,805 --> 00:39:49,391
I don'<i>t</i> know where they are.
I don'<i>t</i> know them.

495
00:39:49,516 --> 00:39:52,394
- So you don'<i>t</i> know anything?
- No, sir.

496
00:39:55,731 --> 00:39:56,773
What about you, Gato?

497
00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:02,696
All right.

498
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:05,782
If it's going to be like this...

499
00:40:06,575 --> 00:40:08,160
(Man screams)

500
00:40:12,706 --> 00:40:15,542
(Valeria) 'Who else was there
besides Colonel Carrillo?'

501
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:16,752
'A bunch of men.'

502
00:40:16,877 --> 00:40:21,840
Some I heard speaking English.
Americans. Like in the movies.

503
00:40:21,965 --> 00:40:24,009
Are you sure they were police?

504
00:40:25,218 --> 00:40:26,720
Yes.

505
00:40:26,845 --> 00:40:28,221
What now?

506
00:40:30,098 --> 00:40:33,060
You think Pablo is going to reward you
for being brave?

507
00:40:33,727 --> 00:40:36,563
Asshole, he doesn'<i>t</i> know you exist.
Do you know that?

508
00:40:37,564 --> 00:40:39,733
It's your last chance, Gato.

509
00:40:39,858 --> 00:40:42,361
Ask your mother, you son of bitch!

510
00:40:50,243 --> 00:40:52,412
(Faint screaming)

511
00:41:29,282 --> 00:41:30,993
(Sighs)

512
00:41:41,169 --> 00:41:43,255
(Line ringing)

513
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,173
(Rings)

514
00:41:45,298 --> 00:41:47,175
- Hello.
- 'Everything is good.'

515
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:50,387
- It worked.
- 'Very well.'

516
00:41:52,764 --> 00:41:53,890
It worked.

517
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,480
- They took my lab.
- And a bunch of Escobar's men.

518
00:42:00,605 --> 00:42:03,525
It's for a noble cause, Mrs Moncada.

519
00:42:08,572 --> 00:42:10,490
Boss, forgive me, but there's bad news.

520
00:42:11,658 --> 00:42:15,370
Search Bloc took the Moncadas'
biggest lab before we could take it apart.

521
00:42:15,495 --> 00:42:20,000
Carrillo got Gato. We don'<i>t</i> know where
they are or what they're doing to him.

522
00:42:58,914 --> 00:43:00,707
(Dialling)

523
00:43:00,832 --> 00:43:03,293
(Phone rings)

524
00:43:05,879 --> 00:43:07,172
Hello?

525
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:08,924
Hello?

526
00:43:10,842 --> 00:43:13,804
- 'Steve?'
- Hey, baby.

527
00:43:13,929 --> 00:43:15,597
'What time is it?'

528
00:43:16,348 --> 00:43:17,599
Uh...

529
00:43:19,392 --> 00:43:20,852
It's late.

530
00:43:21,728 --> 00:43:23,188
'Are you OK?'

531
00:43:24,731 --> 00:43:26,149
Yeah.

532
00:43:27,734 --> 00:43:30,821
I'm good.
I just need to hear your voice.

533
00:43:33,406 --> 00:43:35,534
I wanted to call, Steve. I...

534
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,996
'It's OK. You don'<i>t</i> have to explain.'

535
00:43:41,748 --> 00:43:42,791
What's happened?

536
00:43:44,334 --> 00:43:45,752
'Tell me.'

537
00:43:47,587 --> 00:43:51,842
I'm good, baby. I'm...
Don'<i>t</i> worry. (Clears throat)

538
00:43:53,802 --> 00:43:55,804
(Baby crying)

539
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:59,432
(Crying continues over phone)

540
00:44:00,183 --> 00:44:01,434
You have to go.

541
00:44:04,646 --> 00:44:06,815
Let's talk tomorrow. OK?

542
00:44:07,607 --> 00:44:08,859
Yeah.

543
00:44:10,193 --> 00:44:11,611
Yeah, I'd like that.

544
00:44:15,991 --> 00:44:17,284
Good night.

545
00:44:31,047 --> 00:44:32,841
(Heavy breathing)

546
00:44:41,975 --> 00:44:43,768
(Grunts)

547
00:45:14,716 --> 00:45:16,718
(♪ Up-tempo Latin music playing)
