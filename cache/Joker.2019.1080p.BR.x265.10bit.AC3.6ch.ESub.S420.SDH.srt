Never even returned his sign.

307
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,020

Just get him his sign back.

312

How the fuck do I know?
Why does anybody do anything?

315

If you don't return the sign,

316

Is that right?

1443
01:39:38,176 --> 01:39:39,612
That's right, Murray. I'm not political.

1444

Yeah, that's not funny, Arthur.

01:42:14,734 --> 01:42:16,836
you think that killing those guys is funny?

I do.

1497
01:42:18,904 --> 01:42:21,674
And I'm tired of pretending it's not.

1498
01:42:21,741 --> 01:42:24,142
Comedy is subjective, Murray.

1499
01:42:24,209 --> 01:42:26,045
Isn't that what they say?

1500
01:42:26,112 --> 01:42:27,980
All of you,

you decide what's right or wrong.

1503

01:42:45,831 --> 01:42:47,399
that you did this to start a movement,

1507
01:42:47,465 --> 01:42:50,102
to become a symbol?

1508
01:42:50,168 --> 01:42:51,671
Come on, Murray.

1509
01:42:51,737 --> 01:42:53,072
Do I look like the kind of clown

1510
01:42:53,139 --> 01:42:54,674
that could start a movement?

1511
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:57,677
I killed those guys because they were awful.

1512
01:42:57,743 --> 01:43:00,412
Everybody is awful these days.

1513
01:43:00,478 --> 01:43:02,782

No.

But these guys, what, because Thomas Wayne

1524
01:43:26,872 --> 01:43:28,574
went and cried about them on TV?

1525

You have a problem with Thomas Wayne, too?

Yes, I do.

1527
01:43:32,878 --> 01:43:36,481
Have you seen what it's like out there, Murray?

1528
01:43:36,549 --> 01:43:39,652
Do you ever actually leave the studio?

1529
01:43:39,719 --> 01:43:43,856
Everybody just yells and screams at each other.

Nobody thinks what it's like to be the other guy.

1532

You think men like Thomas Wayne ever think

what it's like to be someone like me?

1534
01:43:55,501 --> 01:43:58,369
To be somebody but themselves? They don't.

1535
01:43:58,436 --> 01:44:00,539
They think that we'll just sit there

1536

and take it, like good little boys!

1537
