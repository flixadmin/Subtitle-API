1
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,096
(Gasps)

2
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,548
The infiltration spell
was successful?

3
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,763
Yes.

4
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:09,468
Now evil shall
truly prevail.

5
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,336
What's uncle
doing now?

6
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:20,205
Jade,
- if you listened
once in a while,

7
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,640
you might not
need to ask

8
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,008
so many
questions.

9
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,176
What was that?

10
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:27,112
The incense ritual
honors uncle's teacher,

11
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:28,780
chi master fong.

12
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:31,717
(Gasps)

13
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,852
A spirit is among us!

14
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,020
Cool.

15
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,862
It is chi master fong.

16
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:45,697
He wishes
to tell me something.

17
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,266
He's gonna
have to speak up.

18
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:48,333
Shh.

19
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,835
To communicate
with the spirits,

20
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,070
we must open
all of our senses.

21
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,875
Darkness approaches.

22
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,378
(Chiming)

23
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,913
An ill omen
from the north.

24
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,585
The falcon
leaves its perch.

25
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:08,287
What does it
mean, uncle?

26
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:09,454
Like the falcon,

27
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:12,090
we must take our leave
northward

28
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,626
to suppress
the forces of darkness.

29
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:15,761
Duh.

30
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,448
The hidden valley.

31
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,185
Its location has
remained secret
for centuries.

32
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,486
What's
the big whoop?

33
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,689
Looks like any
another misty
monkey valley.

34
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,257
There.

35
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,597
Whoa. Mount chimpmore.

36
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,000
The great idol
of the 3 wise monkeys.

37
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:58,003
Legend tells that it is
filled with dark chi.

38
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,339
The idol is evil?

39
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:03,675
No. The 3 wise monkeys
are guardians.

40
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,377
Good wizards

41
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:08,480
sealed the dark chi
within them long ago

42
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:11,350
so that humanity
may neither see, hear,

43
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:13,318
nor speak of such evil.

44
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,621
Hoo.

45
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:16,955
What is it,
<i>sensei?</i>

46
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,557
The willies.

47
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,893
No doubt the forces of light
have summoned you here

48
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,563
since I possess
the only existing map.

49
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:26,932
Daolon wong!

50
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,066
The anti-uncle.

51
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:31,036
So, you have come
to steal the dark chi!

52
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:33,305
Not steal it,
good chi wizard,

53
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,807
unleash it.

54
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,109
But that will
upset the balance

55
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,944
between good and evil!

56
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,279
Indeed.

57
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:41,680
(Chanting)

58
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,315
Jackie,

59
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,817
daolon must not
complete his spell!

60
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,120
Go, uncle.

61
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,521
(Chanting)

62
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,089
Unh.

63
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,557
(Groans)

64
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,096
Daolon is gone!

65
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:34,232
Uncle: As is the idol.

66
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:35,300
Whoa.

67
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,569
Mount chimpmore
is gone, too!

68
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,604
That is what
I just said.

69
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,409
Daolon is gone,

70
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,211
and he took
mount chimpmore
with him!

71
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,780
Stop shouting, Jade.
I am old, not deaf.

72
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,452
Speak up, Jackie!
I cannot hear you!

73
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:56,221
How can you see
through this cloud
of dark chi?

74
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,390
There is no dark chi cloud.

75
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:00,492
Then why
can I not see you?

76
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:05,364
Uncle, no sound
is coming out
of Jackie's mouth!

77
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,566
Because Jackie is mute.

78
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:10,135
Uncle, no sound
is coming out
of <i> your</i> mouth!

79
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,803
Jade is deaf.

80
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:12,871
<i>Sensei?</i>

81
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,240
And tohru is blind.

82
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:16,308
What is it?

83
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,409
What'd
uncle say?

84
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,016
We are like
the 3 wise monkeys.

85
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,852
What?!
- Speak up, tohru!

86
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,453
I said,
we are like--

87
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:31,556
yo, tohru,
over here!

88
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,492
I don't think
"t" can see!

89
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:36,928
Why were you
not affected, <i> sensei?</i>

90
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,930
As a student of master fong,

91
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:42,567
I am protected by
an abundance of good chi.

92
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,404
If I'm deaf
and tohru is blind,

93
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,672
that means uncle
must be mute!

94
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:53,311
Jackie,
I can't hear you! Duh!

95
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,717
I cannot read your lips.
Your accent is too thick.

96
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,954
Uncle, what are
we gonna do?!

97
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,323
Find daolon wong
and stop him

98
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,793
before he unleashes
more dark chi.

99
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:09,628
More dark chi?

100
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,064
Your afflictions
are but a demonstration
of its power.

101
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,733
Under daolon's control,

102
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:17,402
multitudes will be
rendered senseless.

103
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,811
(Yelling in fear)

104
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,286
(All gasp)

105
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,633
Dark chi of ages past,
I summon you forth.

106
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,436
Spread your plague
upon the land.

107
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,083
(Concerned murmuring)

108
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,990
Dark chi, I summon you.

109
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,266
My spell worked before.

110
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:23,535
Something is missing.

111
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:24,936
(Chanting)

112
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,807
Of course.

113
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,277
The dark chi
may only be released

114
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,113
in the presence
of a good chi wizard.

115
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,616
<i>Gan. Ren. Chui.</i>

116
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,953
Bring the old man to me.

117
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,691
How can we hope
to defeat daolon wong

118
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,393
in our condition?

119
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,062
By not relying
on your missing senses.

120
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,364
For instance,

121
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,566
I do not see
so well anymore,

122
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:57,469
so I have strived
to sharpen my hearing.

123
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:59,538
But you do not
hear so well, either.

124
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,575
So must you 3 strive to
sharpen your other senses.

125
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:05,243
Whoo. Garlic!

126
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:08,513
I think we're
downwind from uncle.

127
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:11,683
See? You are
not handicapped.

128
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:14,152
You are handi-capable.

129
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,254
Learn to listen
to nature.

130
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:18,123
Feel the wind
on your face

131
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,258
and the earth
beneath your feet.

132
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,862
Form an image of the world
in your mind's eye.

133
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,738
Ahh.

134
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,641
Maybe we should work
on some alternative

135
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,677
means of communication,
Jackie.

136
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,512
Ok, when you want me

137
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:43,281
to use my chungking express
maneuver,

138
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,150
give me one of these:

139
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,259
You are
doing very well, tohru!

140
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,493
Yes, <i> sensei.</i>

141
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,495
It is as if I can see.

142
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,164
Whoa. (Grunting)

143
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,735
Aiya.

144
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:07,639
Do this for
the high-flying whirlygig.

145
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,515
No. This.

146
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:20,885
Jackie,

147
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,354
the dark warriors!

148
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:23,755
They're after uncle!

149
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,323
Let's get 'em!

150
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,327
You want a piece
of uncle?

151
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,857
Hoo.

152
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:01,459
You will pay for that,
dark warriors!

153
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,195
Dark warriors?

154
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,431
(Tohru yells battle cry)

155
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,366
Dark warrior, be gone!

156
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:16,741
Whoa.

157
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,143
(Grunting)

158
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,548
(Chanting)

159
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,256
Uncle!

160
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,463
Why would they take uncle?!

161
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:41,533
Probably to
disable us further.

162
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,202
How will we stop daolon
without <i> sensei's</i> guidance?

163
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,004
How will we find him?

164
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,172
Whoa.

165
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:51,342
Chi master fong
will help us find uncle.

166
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,144
We just gotta
open all our senses

167
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,245
like uncle did.

168
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:55,647
Good idea.

169
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:04,155
(Bird caws)

170
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,590
East! East!

171
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:07,859
East!

172
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,260
All: East.

173
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,963
Oh. (Grunting)

174
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,274
Unhand me.

175
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:26,077
Only once
all of the dark chi
is released--

176
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,879
with your humble
contribution,

177
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,447
my accomplice.

178
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:31,850
(Grunting)

179
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:35,120
You will be so sorry!

180
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:37,922
With the senses
of humankind dulled,

181
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,891
evil shall roam freely.

182
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,465
(Concerned chatter)

183
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:48,833
I can't see!

184
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:50,301
Man: Oh, it's dark.

185
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,072
It would appear

186
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:56,975
you are the appropriate
yin to my Yang,

187
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:58,176
good wizard.

188
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,577
(Laughing)

189
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,491
Let us venture forth

190
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:16,961
and spread
more darkness.

191
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,740
No sign of uncle.

192
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:30,008
Maybe
chi master fong

193
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,843
was
chi master <i> wrong.</i>

194
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,815
Whoa!

195
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,416
Flying monkeys!

196
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,285
Where?

197
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,606
Daolon's up top,
front and center!

198
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:04,509
And see that wee bitty
thing next to him?

199
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,245
I'm pretty sure
that's uncle's head!

200
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:10,481
Hey, my other senses
<i>are</i> sharper!

201
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:13,551
Ok, team, this is what
we've been training for.

202
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:16,821
Let's haul deaf,
mute, and blind butt
up that rock!

203
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,524
(Grunts)

204
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,093
Uh, what's that,
Jackie?

205
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:23,895
You want to join
a bowling league?

206
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,300
(Groans)

207
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:30,468
(Concerned chatter)

208
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,803
Man: I can't see!

209
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:33,872
Second man:
Oh, it's dark.

210
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,912
Straight up?

211
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:45,750
Ready?

212
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,053
(Grunts)

213
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,226
Oh, my mind's eye
sees trouble.

214
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,517
(Tohru grunting)

215
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,820
Whatever you do, "t,"
don't look down.

216
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:23,988
(Groans)

217
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,790
Oops. Heh.

218
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,725
(Chanting)

219
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,505
I know, I know.

220
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,573
But this time,
it's different, Jackie.

221
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,909
I can be t's eyes
and your mouth.

222
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:46,744
Besides, do the math.

223
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,713
3 wise monkeys,
3 of us.

224
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,320
And 3 dark warriors.

225
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,755
Whoop.

226
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,793
Ok, you run
interference, Jackie.

227
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,461
We'll get uncle.

228
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,920
(Tohru grunts)

229
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,722
Charge!

230
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,625
Get ready.

231
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,361
Hop!

232
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:47,772
Your disabled disciples
cannot possibly defeat me.

233
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:50,475
Not disabled.
Handi-capable.

234
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,415
Whoa! Turn!

235
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,351
Stop! Stop!

236
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,656
Turn.

237
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,260
1, 2, 3, catch!

238
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:27,779
Jump!

239
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,416
Daolon: Aah!

240
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,318
Hi, uncle!
Looking for these?

241
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,187
Thank you, Jade.

242
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:37,622
Wave them over--

243
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:38,823
can't hear you!

244
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,826
(Muffled chanting)

245
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,501
(Spits)

246
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:54,906
(Daolon coughs)

247
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,140
Very well.

248
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,376
You shall suffer
the same fate

249
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:01,012
as chi master fong,
good wizard.

250
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,248
I do not think so.

251
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:09,554
One more thing:

252
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,656
Chi master fong
says hello.

253
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,060
No.

254
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:27,939
Aah!

255
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,442
No!

256
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,478
Hey, yell
in your own ear!

257
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,681
Whoa. I can hear.

258
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,616
Tohru, are you ok?

259
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:39,717
(Gasps)

260
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,185
I can speak!

261
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,454
Wah!

262
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,856
I can see!

263
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,475
(Loud)
Where'd mount--

264
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,144
(softer)
I mean, where'd
mount chimpmore go?

265
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,579
Back to the hidden valley,

266
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:13,451
where it will hopefully
remain for
many more centuries.

267
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,853
How can you
be certain, <i> sensei?</i>

268
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,922
Have you
learned nothing?!

269
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:26,264
Chi master fong
tells me so.

270
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,770
And he also tells me
he's pleased

271
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:36,174
that the balance
between light and dark

272
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,909
has been restored.

273
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,778
Not without casualties.

274
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,648
Look out.

275
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,489
Ooh.

276
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,157
He should've
listened.

277
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:57,161
Daolon has been cursed
with all 3 afflictions.

278
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,230
He will have
to train very hard

279
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:01,165
to become
handi-capable.

280
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,000
(Villagers cheering)

281
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:15,780
Yes.
- Hey, Jackie?

282
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,181
How high can you jump?

283
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,683
After I've broken my ankle,

284
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,718
and also I've
broken my toes.

285
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,255
Right now,
I cannot bend my toes,

286
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:28,259
and I lose a lot of,
you know, bouncing things.

287
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,294
So, this way,
when I'm making a movie,

288
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:31,963
I know my own problem--

289
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:33,497
my broken ankle.

290
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:37,668
My knees get hurt
because--from the injury.

291
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,303
So, this way, when I run,

292
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:41,439
it's like, uh,
running, running,

293
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,941
maybe one step
on the chair,

294
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,676
then I jump
to another things.

295
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,011
But I'm fine.

296
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:49,914
I still can--
still do a lot of things.

297
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,916
And bouncing,
bouncing, bouncing.
