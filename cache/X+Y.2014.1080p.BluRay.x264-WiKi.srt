1
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:05,173
I find any communication

2
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:09,407
of a non-mathematical nature very difficult.

3
00:01:11,607 --> 00:01:15,775
Because I don't talk much, people think
I don't have anything to say,

4
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,875
or that I'm stupid.

5
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,250
And that's not true.

6
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:24,048
I have lots of things to say.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,380
I'm just afraid to say them.

8
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:35,273
I know that I'm strange in lots of ways.

9
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:41,708
I think I see the world
in a different way to other people.

10
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:46,462
I've always been like that.

11
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:04,093
Would you like to play with it?

12
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,817
Are you scared it will eat you?

13
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:08,442
No.

14
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:10,667
Is it because it's a toy?

15
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:14,780
No. Because stegosauruses
aren't carnivores.

16
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:20,333
So, Nathan, what do you like?

17
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,567
I imagine there's things that you don't like.

18
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:28,009
Maybe, say, when meal times change?

19
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:31,623
Yes. Yes, he is fussy about his food.

20
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:34,417
Nathan?

21
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,625
Nathan?

22
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,091
I... I like patterns.

23
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:44,025
And what does it feel like
to see a good pattern?

24
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,125
Nice.

25
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,792
They're pretty colours.

26
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,442
So, it's positive.
Nathan is certainly on the spectrum.

27
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:57,067
Traits of autism combined
with synaesthesia,

28
00:02:57,167 --> 00:03:00,067
sensitive to a change in light and pattern.

29
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:04,608
These can be gifts, of course, but they
do come with some big challenges,

30
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:09,233
socially and emotionally, which will
stay with Nathan all of his life.

31
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:13,923
But there is no question;
That he's a unique young man.

32
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:25,632
Give Mum a wave. Bye, Mum.

33
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,750
Bye.

34
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:34,042
Bye.

35
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:38,382
You know what I was thinking?

36
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:42,525
You know, sometimes it might seem like...

37
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:47,108
...we don't always understand
what it's like to be you.

38
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,775
It's like you've got these special powers,

39
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,875
like a wizard.

40
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,430
And we're just Muggles
that don't understand how you do it.

41
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:01,020
It's like a different language to us.

42
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:07,473
But even though we don't always
understand each other, Nath,

43
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:12,442
it doesn't mean that any of us
ever stops loving each other.

44
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:14,542
Does that make sense?

45
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:17,792
Nathan, look at me.

46
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,588
But you shouldn't be afraid.

47
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:12,199
# Sweetheart...

48
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,666
...# What have you done to us?

49
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:29,077
# I turned my back and you turned to dust...

50
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:33,043
...# What have you done?

51
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:39,167
# And, Oh, please...

52
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:43,697
...# Just come here, don't fight with me...

53
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,458
...# And I admit...

54
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:54,823
...# Think you may have broken It...

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,039
...# Yeah, I admit #

56
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:25,086
Come here, darling. Come here.

57
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,375
Just hold my hand.

58
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:37,900
Please, Nathan.
Nathan, just hold my hand. Just this once.

59
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,650
It's okay. We'll do this together.

60
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,895
Come here, darling. Darling, come on.

61
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:47,015
Nathan. Please, don't. No, Nathan.

62
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,875
Hey.

63
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:09,542
Gosh.

64
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
That looks complicated.

65
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,170
That's not schoolwork then?

66
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,650
Wait, why don't you try
and explain it to me?

67
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,817
I might be able to help you.

68
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:22,917
Hmm?

69
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:25,292
You can't.

70
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,708
Why not?

71
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:30,667
You're not clever enough.

72
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,558
So, Nathan, this is the big school.

73
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,067
When you're older,
you'll go here every single day.

74
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:42,167
Watch out.

75
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:44,525
We're just gonna start things early.

76
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,685
It's nothing to be frightened about.

77
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,466
Don't run in the corridor.

78
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,692
Excuse me.

79
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:55,792
Excuse me.

80
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
There you go.

81
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,167
Oh, that's subtle.

82
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,008
Ah, really subtle.

83
00:08:10,108 --> 00:08:11,525
What? We're not... We're
not doing anything.

84
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,567
'â€œWe're not... We're not...
We're not doing anything.'

85
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,667
Give me that now.

86
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:25,542
Is this drugs?

87
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Go on, piss off.

88
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:37,667
We're so lucky.

89
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,317
Mr Humphreys.
- Yep.

90
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:54,052
Can I have a quick word?
- Yeah.

91
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,125
How old are you? Five?

92
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,875
No, Nathan is nine.

93
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:06,317
His mum got in touch because
of Nathan's rather advanced interest...

94
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:09,983
...in numbers and patterns and his primary
schoolwork was no longer testing.

95
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,568
Mmm, I can see why, yeah. Bit of algebra.

96
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:16,292
Mmm, distance geometry.

97
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:19,347
Where'd you learn all this, mate?

98
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,900
Mr Humphreys just joined
our maths department.

99
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,858
He was a bit of a maths whizz
when he was young, Nathan.

100
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,733
Not really, it was a long time ago.
- No, no, no.

101
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,692
He competed in the International
Mathematical Olympiad.

102
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:34,707
Olympiad?
- Olympiad, yes. The IMO.

103
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:39,358
Did you know you could win
medals for maths, Nathan?

104
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:45,108
Just like sport, only for people who
are really, really strong up here instead.

105
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,835
Mrs Ellis, if Mr Humphreys is willing

106
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:55,108
I think that we can absolutely begin offering
Nathan some special advanced tuition.

107
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,208
Can't we?

108
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,583
Okay, yeah.

109
00:10:13,042 --> 00:10:15,422
Why don't you walk properly?

110
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,418
That's very direct of you.

111
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,880
I've got multiple sclerosis.

112
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,375
What about you?

113
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,667
Why are you weird?

114
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:33,036
I've got special powers.
- Mmm-hmm.

115
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,833
Can you fly?

116
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,295
Can you turn things to ice?

117
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,525
Are you really good at maths?

118
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,665
Ah, yeah. Ah, fair play.

119
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:46,442
Well, listen, I should tell you,
I'm not a very good teacher.

120
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:48,817
I barely encourage myself to get out of bed,

121
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:50,692
let alone inspire some kid
with special powers...

122
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:52,358
...who wants to spend
all his spare time doing maths.

123
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,668
So as long as we're clear.

124
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:55,991
What's that for?

125
00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:58,400
It's to give it a shake.
It's my hand, isn't it?

126
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,317
It's what men do when they agree.
- I don't like doing that.

127
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:03,650
Yeah, well, we all have
to do things we don't like doing,

128
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,942
but we fucking do them, don't we?
So give it here.

129
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,167
What does 'fucking' mean?

130
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
All in good time, son.

131
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,233
Right then.

132
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,650
We'll start with some probability, shall we?

133
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,650
Like what's the probability of me
remembering any of this shit.

134
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,775
I can't hear you.

135
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:27,114
I said, let's do tree diagrams, shall we?

136
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,358
Mr Humphreys?

137
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,108
Yes, Mr Ellis.

138
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,503
What was the Olympiad like?

139
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:37,257
Mind your own business, nosy.

140
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:40,042
Boom.

141
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:42,233
Do you know what this means?

142
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,400
Go on, Sir Nod-A-Lot, tell me,
what does it mean?

143
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,150
A toss.

144
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,733
Toss?

145
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,833
How dare you?

146
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,802
Yeah, the coin toss. Well done.

00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,628
'And let P denote
the perimeter of the hexagon.'

165
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,967
Nathan. Breakfast.

166
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:14,303
'Prove that RA plus RC plus RE'

167
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:18,245
'is greater than or equal to P over 2.'

168
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,583
Here.

169
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:28,650
It doesn't matter if you don't get in.
- Of course it matters.

170
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,417
Got twisted. Okay? Good.

171
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Good luck.

172
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,525
Get a job.
- You get a job.

173
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,192
I'm trying. I've handed CVs out.
- You've got a CV?

174
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:44,942
Yeah, obviously. I don't wanna
sit on me arse all day, you know.

175
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:47,608
And even If I do, you're sat next to me.
- No, I'm not.

176
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,400
Yeah, you are.
Joined at the friggin' hip.

177
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,070
Are you listening to our conversation? Eh?

178
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,025
No.
- What?

179
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,440
No, I wasn't.
- Are you sure about that?

180
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:00,792
Better not be.
- No.

181
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,025
You're late.
- Sorry, mate.

182
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:35,185
I had a quick look at it first. Shh.

183
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,400
It's a piece of piss, really.

184
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,358
Well, not really, but...

185
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,838
You know, just do your best.

186
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,900
It's the biggest day of your life, mate, innit?

187
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,858
Don't feel any pressure.

188
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,608
I'm a bit nervous.

189
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,150
Are you nervous?

190
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,692
A little bit.
- Well, you shouldn't be.

191
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,025
Because you're brilliant.

192
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,525
Are you ready?

193
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:56,733
Yeah.

194
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,317
Yeah?

195
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:00,542
On your marks, get set...

196
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,750
Go on, my son.

197
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:05,692
I'll just be over there, out the way.

198
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:07,192
'Question one.'

199
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:12,477
'Are there infinitely many pairs of
positive integers such...'

200
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:18,983
'Question one.'

201
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:22,525
'Are there infinitely many pairs
of positive integers'

202
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:26,960
'such that both m divides
n squared plus one and...'

203
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:35,983
'Are there infinitely many pairs
of positive integers'

204
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,889
'such that both m divides
n squared plus one...

205
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:43,559
...and that n divides m squared plus one?'

206
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,108
When will we find out?

207
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,503
Uh, about a week, probably.

208
00:15:55,417 --> 00:16:00,262
It's all right, male. Relax to the max.
Take a chill pill.

209
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,233
Talking of which, this hill's a killer.

210
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,563
Do you mind if we take the weight off?

211
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,100
Can I ask you a question?
- Hang on.

212
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,631
Go on then, hit me.

213
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,813
Hit you?
- Ask me the fucking question.

214
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:25,497
Why did things go wrong for you,
at the Olympiad?

215
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:29,637
There's lots of reasons, really.

216
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:35,738
My 'thing' was kicking
off around that time.

217
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,958
My ailment.

218
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:42,233
Cutting me down in the prime of my life.

219
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,750
I just sort of lost it.

220
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:48,775
I can't Lose it.

221
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:53,210
Nathan, you haven't gotta
prove anything, all right?

222
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:58,733
What's important is that you enjoy doing
it, maths, and you do, don't you?

223
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,233
So whether you get on the team or not,

224
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:05,073
you're gonna do amazing
things in the future.

225
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,708
You haven't.

226
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,583
Well, thanks a lot.

227
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,965
You charming little bastard'.

228
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,817
Hi. Hi.

229
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:22,807
Um, can I order number 47, please,

230
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,608
with, um,

231
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:28,618
seven prawn balls
and a small chips, thank you.

232
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:34,015
It come with six balls, number 47.

233
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:36,207
Yeah, I know. Usually...

234
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:37,775
Sorry, are you new?

235
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,108
It's just we come here all the time...

236
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,858
...and it's usually just fine,
you give us an extra ball.

237
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,400
Number 48 is a large prawn ball meal.

238
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,233
You get nine balls, large
chips and crackers.

239
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,483
Yeah, I know.

240
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,108
No. Sorry.

241
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,192
Sorry.

242
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:57,483
No, he doesn't like, um, crackers
and he likes to have a small chips.

243
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,650
I'm sorry, it's just, uh...

244
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,358
My son, he's quite picky...

245
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:05,650
...and he needs the meal number
to be a prime number...

246
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,900
...and there to be a prime number
of prawn balls.

247
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,108
And, um,

248
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,733
if he had nine balls
it wouldn't be a prime number...

249
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,733
...and number 48 isn't...

250
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,567
Isn't... Isn't a prime...

251
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:20,650
Is it? Is it? I don't know. Yes, I do.

252
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,750
Um, yes, no, I'm right.

253
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,750
47.

254
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:29,542
Is that okay?
- Yeah.

255
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,725
There we go. A big fat 'well done'.

256
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,375
It's all spilt out.

257
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,733
Oh.

258
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:56,900
No, no, it's fine.
Nathan, Nathan, don't get upset. It's fine.

259
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,983
No, Mum, it's not fine.
- It's fine.

260
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,650
You don't do anything right.
- I'm sorry?

261
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,817
Everything you do is wrong.

262
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:04,637
Oh... Oh, well, I'm sorry, okay?

263
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:06,667
Thank you so much.

264
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,208
Sorry.

265
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:28,900
That doctor didn't know his
herbivores from his carnivores, did he?

266
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And do you know why?

267
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,805
Because he's not as smart as you.

268
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,275
Is there someone else you know
that has what you have?

269
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,375
Einstein.

270
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,942
Okay.

271
00:19:47,042 --> 00:19:49,042
But...

272
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,543
I just want you to know...

273
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:56,115
...that you're fine the way you are, Nathan.

274
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,025
So do you want one of them
ice cream things for dessert or what?

275
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,233
. Dad.'What?

276
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,336
Oh, no. Not again. Ah.

277
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,233
What do I do? Do I lean forward?
- No, back.

278
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,138
Back? Oh, no, this is a disaster.

279
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:17,132
I know. I know. Give me this.

280
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:38,013
As promised, I come bearing news.

281
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:46,400
Are you sure it's okay if I stand out here?
I don't wanna put you out.

282
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,880
Yeah.
- Invite me in, Nathan.

283
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,842
Come in.
- Thank you very much.

284
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,998
Put the kettle on, then.

285
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,733
Put the kettle on what?
- It's okay. I'll do it.

286
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,108
Hi, Julie.
- Hi, Mr Humphreys.

287
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,692
How are you?
- Very good, thank you.

288
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:08,275
Thanks for coming round.
- I got it.

289
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,733
Oh. Oh, my goodness.
Is that what I think it is?

290
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:14,483
I hope so, otherwise it would have
been a wasted journey.

291
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,275
Um, you open it.

292
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:20,285
You want me to open it? All right then.
- Yeah.

293
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:27,737
â€œDear Mr Ellis, I am writing to let you
know that unfortunately...

294
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:32,650
'â€œ...you have successfully earned a place
on the United Kingdom maths squad.'

295
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,983
Oh, my goodness. Oh, Nathan, darling.

296
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,525
Well, that's good news, isn't it?
- Oh, my gosh.

297
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,692
Well done, mate.
- Oh, well done.

298
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:39,942
Why is that unfortunate?

299
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:41,108
No, I was having a joke, mate.

300
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,942
It says the training camp's
in Taiwan this year.

301
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:45,400
Have you ever been on a plane before?
- No. He's not.

302
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,275
Well, that's exciting, isn't it?
- Um...

303
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,817
But...

304
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:51,917
I should study.

305
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:55,767
Are you leaving now, or...
- Nathan.

306
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:58,667
He doesn't mean that.

307
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:00,442
Probably, yeah.

308
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:02,108
Okay.
- Well...

309
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,358
I'm gonna go and study.
- Okay.

310
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,775
Well done, mate.

311
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,942
He is pleased. He's...
- I know he is, yeah.

312
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:12,483
I'm gonna have something stronger
than a cup of tea, actually, I think.

313
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,150
I'm gonna have a glass of wine.
- Okay.

314
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,233
Would you like...

315
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,817
I should probably shoot off.

316
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:18,233
Okay, no, that's fine.

317
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,478
But I mean, if you're gonna have one.

318
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:30,900
Actually, I was thinking maybe,
you know you'd like to...

319
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,323
To join us next month,

320
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:35,498
take him to the airport.

321
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:38,602
I know that would make Nathan happy.

322
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:46,650
I should probably tell you before they...

323
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,067
I'm taking a bit of a break from work.

324
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,483
Uh, it's a bit of a forced break.

325
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:55,153
It's a bit like I'm being fired, basically.

326
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,650
I'm sorry.

327
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,650
But I wanted to say to you
even though I'm not working...

328
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,608
...for the school any more, I'd really
like to carry on teaching Nathan.

329
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:02,085
Really?

330
00:23:02,185 --> 00:23:04,942
Yeah. I mean, if that's all right with you?

331
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:07,108
That would be amazing.
- Obviously for no money.

332
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:09,615
Oh. Jesus Christ.

333
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,125
Oh, my God.

334
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,650
That's a bit of a weird one.

335
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,108
Thanks for the drink and stuff.
- Not at all.

336
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,483
Don't worry about it. All right.
- Yeah, no, good.

337
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:24,525
Will you be all right? Okay.
- Yeah. Cheers, Julie. Thank you.

338
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:27,430
Thank you. Take care.
- All right.

339
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,298
We were just talking, Nathan.

340
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,625
I was looking at Jupiter.

341
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,335
I didn't do it on purpose.

342
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
It was just...

343
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:56,192
It was just nice, you know,
to have someone to talk to.

344
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:58,292
For once. For me.

345
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:03,257
Sometimes I feel a bit alone.

346
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,458
Okay.

347
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:38,983
What else can we write?
Numbers? Say a prime number.

348
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:42,568
Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly.
- 353.

349
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:47,460
353.

350
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,983
Whoa.

351
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,650
Just in time.

352
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,858
Perfect timing.

353
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:54,423
Fireworks night again, is it?

354
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:56,900
He's letting you hold his hand, isn't he?

355
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,817
The sparkler helps.

356
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:00,150
Come on, Nathan.

357
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,317
It's time to change the fish.

358
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,608
If you come now you can get
an extra scoop of ice cream.

359
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:07,483
Extra scoop of Ice cream.
And what do I get?

360
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:08,983
You don't get anything.
- Go ahead, go ahead.

361
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:11,025
You're lucky I'm here, that's all.

362
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:13,930
I'm lucky. â€œ
- Yeah, you get me.

363
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:27,425
I like a man in a shed.
- Ah...

364
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:29,650
Go and get me ice cream.
- But you're not getting...

365
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,275
I told you, you're not getting...

366
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:33,375
Ice cream, Julie.

367
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,583
Nathan?

368
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,708
Jesus.

369
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:47,875
Nathan.

370
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:50,650
Oh.

371
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,750
Nathan, It's okay.

372
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:54,983
Nathan, I'm not angry.

373
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:56,275
Nathan.

374
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:58,698
Michael? Michael?

375
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:18,567
Everything all right?
- Yeah.

376
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:20,817
I'm quite looking FORWARD to this
in a weird sort of way.

377
00:26:20,917 --> 00:26:22,275
Yeah, I know.

378
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:24,840
Little trip down memory lane.

379
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,548
Okay. We all ready?
- Hang on.

380
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,250
This is for you.

381
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:35,417
Nathan...

382
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:37,417
What do you say?

383
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:39,858
Thank you.
- Well, I used to use them,

384
00:26:39,958 --> 00:26:41,233
so they're probably cursed.

385
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,608
But, you know, it might remind
you of home or something.

386
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:45,108
Very lovely of you.
- Right then.

387
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:47,900
Shall we get this show on the road?
- Yep. Let's go.

388
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Nathan?

389
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:52,025
Can you get in the back with me?

390
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:56,608
Nathan, I think Mr Humphreys will be
more comfortable in the front.

391
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:57,900
It's okay, darling.

392
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,380
Darling, darling, it's okay.

393
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,500
I'll drive carefully.

394
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:05,025
No, It's all right.

395
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,845
I'm actually surprisingly bendy.

396
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:28,708
Christ.

397
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,130
It's Tricky Dicky. Look out.

398
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:34,233
All right, Richard?

399
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:36,333
Oh.

400
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:38,233
Martin Humphreys.'95.

401
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:40,858
Humphreys. Yeah, hell's teeth. Yes.

402
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:44,188
Yes. The last I heard, you were, um...

403
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:46,542
Teaching, was it?
- Yes.

404
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,067
Yeah. At what university? I can't...

405
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,775
It's a secondary school.
- Ah, yeah.

406
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:53,608
Wasted opportunity, this one.

407
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:55,983
So what are you doing here?
You flying off to Ibiza?

408
00:27:56,083 --> 00:28:00,358
Fleeing the world of reason and rationality
for some hallucinogenic escape?

409
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:03,692
No, I'm dropping this one off, actually.

410
00:28:03,792 --> 00:28:04,983
Ah.

411
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,192
Nathan Ellis, I presume. Yes.

412
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:09,025
The dragon. Ah.

413
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:10,442
And where have you been
lying dormant, eh?

414
00:28:10,542 --> 00:28:12,983
It's not often we have a mind like yours
spring up off the radar.

415
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:14,525
He's mine.

416
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:16,942
I mean, I'm his...
Urn, I've been teaching him.

417
00:28:17,042 --> 00:28:20,171
Ah. The plot thickens.

418
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:22,525
Well, we'll get you signed in, shall we, eh?

419
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:24,858
Just a quick goodbye and then avanti.

420
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:27,459
Oh, well, Nathan, darling.

421
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,858
Um...

422
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,233
You got your phone on you? Yeah?

423
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:33,900
Yeah.

424
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,995
Make sure you ring me
as soon as you land, yeah?

425
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:42,543
AH right. Bye, then.
- Bye.

426
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,750
Sorry.

427
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:01,928
Time to meet your peers, Nathan.

428
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:06,333
Mingle. Mingle.

429
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:10,625
Um, watch your step,
there's a chess game going on.

430
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:17,083
Hey. How do you do?

431
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,750
How do I do what?

432
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:23,042
I mean, what's your name?

433
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:26,375
Nathan.
- I'm Isaac.

434
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:29,900
I'm guessing this is your first maths camp?
You'll be fine.

435
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,150
Best thing is just to dive in.

436
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,250
Come. Sit down.

437
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,108
I mean, can you believe the Chinese team?

438
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,483
They won six golds again last year.

439
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:42,983
Yes, although upon recent evidential proof
I'd expect this to possibly change,

440
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:46,358
if I'm allowed to split infinitives,
to possibly change.

441
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:48,650
Which I believe I technically am now.

442
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,442
Of course, one of the most famous
infinitive splits of all time...

443
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:55,317
...came in the introductory lines
of Star Trek, 'to boldly go,' and...

444
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:58,150
I think if the writers of a popular
American television series...

445
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:01,275
...can get away with it for 40 years,
then, really, any of us can.

446
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:03,192
Don't worry, he's always like this.

447
00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:05,417
Everyone, this is Nathan.

448
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:07,483
Hi, Nathan.
- Hello, Nathan.

449
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:09,583
Hi, I'm Pav.

450
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,525
Paf?

451
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,625
P-A-V, Pav.

452
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:15,917
Pav is from India. Pav.

453
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:17,483
Actually I'm from Chipping Norton.

454
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:20,983
Yes, but of course I meant your origins,
not your birthplace,

455
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:23,067
before we open that little Pandora's box.

456
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:25,167
Oh, dear.

457
00:30:27,417 --> 00:30:30,546
Seat belts on, please.
Seat belts on.

458
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,358
Right, don't sit at the front next
to the driver, that's my seat.

459
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:38,753
Right, away you go, driver.

460
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:44,802
Now, you are 16 of the cleverest
young brains in this country.

461
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:49,275
Now, outside you might be
considered nerds or geeks...

462
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:52,067
...or whatever the insult du jour might be.

463
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:55,567
But here, you are among kindred spirits.

464
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:58,650
Now, assuming you're capable
of basic arithmetic,

465
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:03,483
you'll know that there are six places
available yet more than six of you.

466
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:07,483
Which means that this, to a large extent,
is about whittling you down.

467
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:11,525
Now, we will be training with four other
national teams in Taiwan.

468
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,567
And after some
delicate diplomatic negotiation,

469
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:17,650
I can confirm that the Chinese
will be one of them.

470
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,817
Now we should, of course, be cordial...

471
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:23,733
...as it falls to us to host
the competition this year, in Cambridge.

472
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:26,358
But that doesn't mean we can't be ruthless.

473
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:31,473
Now, I want you up there
with the Chinese, top of the table.

474
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:35,650
And I will consider it an abhorrent
failure to include a candidate...

475
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,130
...who does not win a medal.

476
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,291
Be under no illusion.
This is all about winning.

477
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:48,405
Although that doesn't mean it can't be fun.

478
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:53,386
55,89, 144,

479
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,701
233, 377,

480
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:58,025
610.

481
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:03,636
987, 1,597, 2,584.

482
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,975
I like the Fibonacci sequence, too.

483
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:12,015
Invaluable for music compositions.

484
00:32:12,167 --> 00:32:13,733
So you're new.

485
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:15,567
Fresh meat.

486
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,667
How's that going?

487
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:23,298
Okay, so you're the shy type.

488
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:27,858
Makes a nice change, to be honest.

489
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:32,650
Most of these weirdos just wanna show off
about how much maths junk they know.

490
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,525
What?

491
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:36,025
Nothing.

492
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:39,185
It's just I'm usually the weird one.

493
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,650
They do all seem good at maths, though.

494
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,608
Yeah.

495
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:50,650
Here you are neither weird
nor the best mathematician, I'm afraid.

496
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,300
You are painstakingly average.

497
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:31,192
Post-Olympiad of course,
I'll need to branch out into...

498
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:35,192
...modem theoretical physics if I'm going
to describe a unified field theory...

499
00:33:35,292 --> 00:33:37,608
...for the four fundamental forces of nature.

500
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:40,983
Are you one of the fundamental
forces of nature, Luke?

501
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:42,233
No.

502
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:44,692
But you are terribly gifted, aren't you?

503
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:48,051
Yes. Gifted but not arrogant, Isaac.

504
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,283
Here we are. Maths camp, Taipei.

505
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,555
Your home for the next two weeks.

506
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:24,042
Right, everybody out.

507
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:25,942
Don't forget your umbrellas.

508
00:34:26,042 --> 00:34:28,167
There's a typhoon coming.

509
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:32,525
Hello.
- Hello. Welcome to Taiwan.

510
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:34,317
Nice to meet you.
- Hello. I'm Richard.

511
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:35,400
My name is Jason.

512
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,233
Nice to meet you, Jaigen.

513
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:38,817
Jason. Yeah.
- Jason. I'm sorry.

514
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:39,900
Jason. It was the accent.

515
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,983
Hello. Nice to meet you.

516
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:44,358
Right, come on, get your bags. Chop-chop.

517
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,817
Can someone help the man, please?

518
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:50,487
It's not the days of the Empire.
Thank you.

519
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,708
Oh.

520
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,792
Here comes the typhoon.

521
00:34:57,292 --> 00:34:59,332
Batten down the hatches.

522
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:03,983
Taiwanese.

523
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:05,775
Currently below us in the rankings,

524
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:09,870
but they're our hosts,
so we should be gracious.

525
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:12,713
Here's the real competition.

526
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,750
The Chinese.

527
00:35:16,042 --> 00:35:17,733
Guys, check out the board.

528
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:20,275
Is she messing around
with the Goldbach Conjecture?

529
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:21,567
Maybe it's what they do for fun.

530
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:24,650
Mmm, I love cracking unprovable theorems
in my free time.

531
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,650
No one has proven that it's unprovable.

532
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,470
Right, come on. They won't bite.

533
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:33,583
Ah. The enemy.

534
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:35,782
Surrender or die.

535
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:37,817
Deng Laoshi.

536
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:39,358
Dear Richard, welcome.

537
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:41,150
Such an honour to have you here.
- Thank you.

538
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,324
Ni hao.
- Ni hao.

539
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,208
Students, hello.

540
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:50,945
I hope you are ready for some mathematics.

541
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:04,303
Now, pay attention, Team UK.

542
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:08,567
Deng Laoshi and I have decided to pair
you up with a Chinese buddy...

543
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,942
...and you should make the most
of this opportunity,

544
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:14,525
or, more to the point, you should
spy on your Chinese counterpart...

545
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:17,025
...and bring their trade secrets to Blighty.

546
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:19,125
Very funny, Richard.

547
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:21,667
Uh, Luke Shelton.

548
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:24,833
Zhang Zhi.

549
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,650
Hello. My name is Zhang Zhi.

550
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,750
Luke.

551
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,750
Nathan Ellis.

552
00:36:36,917 --> 00:36:38,917
Zhang Mei.

553
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:53,607
Nice to meet you. My name is Zhang Mei.

554
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Pavinder Kamdar.

555
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,250
This is Shao Tong.

556
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:18,918
Nice to meet you.
- Ni hao.

557
00:37:19,542 --> 00:37:21,580
And you know my uncle.

558
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:26,123
Nathan. The lucky one
learning from my niece, huh?

559
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:31,307
We have high expectations for her.

560
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:33,275
And for you, of course.

561
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:36,350
High expectations all round, I say.

562
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,858
Zhang Mei.

563
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,958
Oh.

564
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:46,942
Yes, of course, though it may be
the world's fastest developing nation...

565
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:52,150
...some of the cuisine doesn't seem
to have advanced quite so quickly.

566
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,900
Careful. Careful.
- Oh, look at this.

567
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,825
Thank you. Uh, zhi Zhia... Xie xie.
- Xie xie.

568
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:01,108
You put this in there?
- You put the raw food in this.

569
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:02,567
In the peanut sauce?
- Oh...

570
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:05,217
No.
- Okay, okay, I'll do that.

571
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:10,990
You don't use them... Like that.

572
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:15,577
Hold it like this and pinch it like a lobster.

573
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:17,358
Yeah.

574
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:21,963
So, Nathan, what was your score
on the mock IMO paper?

575
00:38:22,792 --> 00:38:25,775
Zhang Mei got the full seven marks
on questions one to three.

576
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:29,615
Though her combinatorics
is her weakest area.

577
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:33,262
I'm really not... Not that good.

578
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:36,542
No, but you soon will be.

579
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:16,329
Nathan, are you okay?

580
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:39,067
Almost everyone on the
camp speaks English.

581
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:41,167
It is expected of us.

582
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:44,025
You speak it very well.

583
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:45,900
Thank you.

584
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,567
So do you.

585
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:49,667
Chinese, I mean.

586
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:53,397
You don't say a lot in English at all.

587
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:16,567
This room seems reasonably symmetrical.

588
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,667
Apart from the window.

589
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:21,067
I don't know about you,

590
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:26,097
but I don't appreciate
this forced proximity to each other.

591
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:30,083
I'll take this side.

592
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,710
I'm going to the bathroom.

593
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:16,660
Oh, you dirty little bastard.

594
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,442
Go on, then.

595
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:23,169
Oh, my God, that is absolutely disgusting.

596
00:41:24,042 --> 00:41:26,258
Boom. Wanker.

597
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,750
Yeah?

598
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,875
Yes. Who's this?
- It's...

599
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,750
Nathan? Is that you?

600
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:39,650
How are you doing? How's
it going out there?

601
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:44,340
Everything's different
and everyone's cleverer than me.

602
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:48,608
Look, Nathan, it's your
first night away and...

603
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:53,128
And first nights away
are always really, really shit.

604
00:41:53,417 --> 00:41:55,275
I mean, it's only a fortnight, innit?

605
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:57,925
That's 14 days. And what's 14?

606
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:03,246
A positive integer.
- Positive integer.

607
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:05,375
So think positively.

608
00:42:05,417 --> 00:42:07,650
Which is the square root of?

609
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,483
196.

610
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:12,048
Whose prime factorisation is?

611
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,215
Two squared by seven squared.

612
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:17,625
See?

613
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:46,040
# One, two, buckle my shoe...

614
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,750
...# Three, four.

615
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:51,164
# Knock on my door.

616
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:56,675
# Five, six, pick up your sticks...

617
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:01,384
...# Seven, eight, lay them straight...

618
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,250
...# One, two.

619
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:06,958
# Buckle my shoe...

620
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:09,458
...# Three, four... #

621
00:43:16,542 --> 00:43:18,542
Strong squad this year?

622
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:21,608
Testing my team for weaknesses, Richard?

623
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:25,150
You should relax more,
not take it so seriously.

624
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:29,775
It's all right for you, you got
the best in the world to choose from.

625
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:32,942
But having your niece on the team, Deng?

626
00:43:33,042 --> 00:43:35,042
I mean, really?

627
00:43:36,792 --> 00:43:38,792
You'll see.

628
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:42,900
Luke, I don't care.

629
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,150
Civilizations have used 10, not l2,
digits to count for millennia.

630
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,775
Yes, for purely primitive reasons, and the
fact that we have lo digits on our hands.

631
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:52,400
My argument is that if we use base 12...

632
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,400
...it is an infinitely superior system,
and more logical.

633
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,900
It takes 12 months for the Earth
to orbit the sun,

634
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,442
there are 12 hours a night
and 12 hours a day,

635
00:44:00,542 --> 00:44:02,942
and each of those hours there
are 12 five-minute increments.

636
00:44:03,042 --> 00:44:04,775
And what do you think, Nathan?

637
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:07,400
You a member of the dozenalist society?

638
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,150
Uh, I don't know.

639
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,608
Sorry.

640
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:15,775
People disagreeing with my opinion
is one thing, but no opinion?

641
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:18,425
You might as well not be here.

642
00:44:20,417 --> 00:44:21,358
The vertices of a regular 72-gon.

643
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:22,733
The vertices of a regular 72-gon...

644
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:26,275
...are each coloured red,
green or blue in equal amounts.

645
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:30,900
Show that we can always choose four red,
four green or four blue vertices...

646
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,942
...such that each monochromatic set
form a congruent quadrilateral.

647
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:38,650
Yes, so, of course, the whole question can
be trivialised by Ramsey Theory.

648
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,192
No, sorry, Luke.
There were other hands up before you.

649
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:42,942
Well, I've already answered it now.

650
00:44:43,042 --> 00:44:45,042
Really? You think so?

651
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:48,442
Is anyone here convinced
by Luke's answer?

652
00:44:48,542 --> 00:44:50,567
'It's interesting you ask
â€œis anyone convinced?'

653
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:52,650
rather than 'is anyone not convinced?'

654
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:55,650
I'm not convinced.
- I'm not convinced.

655
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:58,483
Nathan, would you join in, please?

656
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:00,583
This isn't a holiday.

657
00:45:00,792 --> 00:45:03,257
Do you have a proof to share?

658
00:45:05,792 --> 00:45:07,832
That's a disappointment.

659
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:10,333
Ben?

660
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:14,323
Muirhead's inequality
and Schur's inequality?

661
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,858
It's interesting stuff, Nathan,
but you do over-complicate everything.

662
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:23,525
Things can be much simpler
than they initially appear.

663
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:26,317
Did Mr Humphreys not tell you that?

664
00:45:26,417 --> 00:45:29,400
Mind you, he never did quite live up
to his potential, that one.

665
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,150
It's because his illness was getting worse.

666
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,250
His Illness?

667
00:45:34,417 --> 00:45:36,967
Is he still using that excuse?

668
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:40,233
Stephen Hawking has done
all right on far worse.

669
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:43,608
No, I'm afraid it wasn't
Mr Humphreys' body that failed him,

670
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:45,708
it was his character.

671
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,050
He just couldn't stay with it.

672
00:46:24,292 --> 00:46:26,923
# If you must wait...

673
00:46:28,917 --> 00:46:33,373
...# Wait for them here
in my arms as I shake...

674
00:46:40,417 --> 00:46:42,953
...# If you must weep...

675
00:46:43,792 --> 00:46:47,067
Is that strong enough for you?
- That's fine.

676
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:49,442
No sugar?
- No sugar, sweet enough for me.

677
00:46:49,542 --> 00:46:52,347
How are you doing?
- Never better.

678
00:46:56,375 --> 00:46:59,883
# you must mourn, my love...

679
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:05,253
...# Mourn with the moon
and the stars up above...

680
00:47:09,958 --> 00:47:12,281
...# you must mourn...

681
00:47:14,542 --> 00:47:17,173
...# Don't do it alone #

682
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:22,442
So, as well as your cycle of amitriptyline,

683
00:47:22,542 --> 00:47:27,982
you were prescribed glucocorticosteroids
for your latest relapse.

684
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:29,692
You can't have got through
all of those already.

685
00:47:29,792 --> 00:47:30,775
I wouldn't have thought.

686
00:47:30,875 --> 00:47:32,442
Someone broke Into my car.

687
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:34,150
Unfortunate.

688
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,608
Mention it to the police?
- No, there's no point, is there?

689
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:39,650
Because they only stole
the pills and some CD's.

690
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:42,233
Bee Gees' greatest hits.
Which I was gutted about...

691
00:47:42,333 --> 00:47:44,942
...because I bloody love
those squeaky little bastards.

692
00:47:45,042 --> 00:47:48,150
Soto be clear, these are not
anti-depressants, Mr Humphreys.

693
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,817
I mean, that's good
because I'm not depressed.

694
00:47:50,917 --> 00:47:52,233
You know, maybe you wanna
change your mind...

695
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:56,498
...about going to one of those groups
I mentioned?

696
00:47:56,542 --> 00:47:59,358
What, sit in a circle and listen
to how crap everybody else's life is?

697
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:04,233
You know, sharing your issues might help.
- Sharing my issues?

698
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:07,358
Like how I hate wobbling about like a twat,

699
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:10,358
how I've started to lose control
of my bladder and it won't be Mung...

700
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:12,900
...before I lose control of my arse
and start to shit myself.

701
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,983
So, be careful,
'cause I could go at any second.

702
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:17,633
And then, to top it all off...

703
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
My dick doesn't work.

704
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:24,150
Is that the sort of thing
you think I should be sharing?

705
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:26,250
Yeah.

706
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:27,525
Perhaps.

707
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:31,733
No, but what I really want, Martin,
is for you to...

708
00:48:31,833 --> 00:48:33,833
...not give up.

709
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:44,218
I should probably take this
because it's my crack dealer.

710
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Hello?
- Hello, Martin.

711
00:48:47,875 --> 00:48:50,281
It... It's Julie. Yes.

712
00:48:50,417 --> 00:48:52,627
That's right. Julie Ellis.

713
00:48:57,125 --> 00:48:59,125
Hi. Hi.
- Hiya.

714
00:48:59,167 --> 00:49:00,942
Thanks for coming round. It's...
- It's all right.

715
00:49:01,042 --> 00:49:03,483
Yeah.
- You sure you're ready for this?

716
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:05,583
Absolutely.

717
00:49:05,708 --> 00:49:08,567
Okay, then.
Let's begin at the beginning, shall we?

718
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:10,667
Mmm-hmm.

719
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:14,108
It's all right. It's like anything.
It's scary at first.

720
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:16,817
But then when you get your head
round it, you'll be all right.

721
00:49:16,917 --> 00:49:18,917
Uh...

722
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,750
Has he, um...

723
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:24,358
Has he rung you again?

724
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:26,458
Nathan? No.
- Yeah.

725
00:49:27,917 --> 00:49:29,900
Now, look, I'm sure he didn't mean
anything by it, calling me.

726
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,733
It's just he doesn't think
sometimes, does he?

727
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:36,233
Oh, well, no, he does think a lot.
Just mainly about maths.

728
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:38,233
Which is fine, you know.

729
00:49:38,333 --> 00:49:41,525
He just thinks I'm a bit of an idiot
because I failed at maths at school.

730
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:43,733
I mean, I got everything else,
it was just, you know...

731
00:49:43,833 --> 00:49:45,108
Mmm.

732
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:49,567
It's why I wanna do this really,
you know, get into his head more.

733
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:52,692
I'm not making sense. Shut up, Julie.
- No, you're making perfect sense.

734
00:49:52,792 --> 00:49:54,917
Not really.
- No, you are.

735
00:49:55,667 --> 00:49:58,233
I mean, the thing about maths,
as with any subject,

736
00:49:58,333 --> 00:50:01,942
I think if you have an inspirational
teacher, urn, then you'll be away.

737
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:03,317
Which is where I come in.

738
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,420
Mr Inspirational.

739
00:50:05,542 --> 00:50:07,542
Okay, then.

740
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:09,983
Let's start with something...

741
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:12,233
Yeah. Pythagoras. Yay.
- Okay.

742
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:14,775
Uh, can you say that word?
- Hypotenuse.

743
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:16,949
Bless you.

744
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:21,410
You all right? You got a little bit of a cold?

745
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:26,400
# It's time to step up, mofo,
and see what you can do...

746
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:33,555
...# Keep your Pythag theorem to yourself
I raise you B minus C plus F equals 2 #...

747
00:50:35,125 --> 00:50:37,692
Who's next? Who's next?
- Your turn, Luke.

748
00:50:37,792 --> 00:50:39,067
Go, Luke.

749
00:50:39,167 --> 00:50:40,942
Go, Luke. Go, Luke.

750
00:50:41,042 --> 00:50:43,650
Thank you, but I really don't see the point.

751
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,650
Apart from succumbing
to testosterone-fuelled irrationality.

752
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:48,317
It's because it's funny, Luke.

753
00:50:48,417 --> 00:50:50,692
Don't you have a sense of humour?
- Just ignore him.

754
00:50:50,792 --> 00:50:52,065
He's hereto bring the
mood down as always,

755
00:50:52,165 --> 00:50:52,650
so don't let him.

756
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:57,680
I'm hereto do maths.
- You're just a regular quadrilateral.

757
00:50:57,708 --> 00:51:00,150
Okay, take it, Ben.
- # UK, make some noise.

758
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:03,358
# 'Cause I'm talking pi, bro, I'm talking...

759
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:07,879
...# 1141592653553...

760
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,947
...# 9793238462643... #...

761
00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:21,775
Sorry.
- Um...

762
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:23,875
No, It's all right.

763
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:28,767
I was just practicing my fingering.

764
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:31,833
Um...

765
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:35,958
Go on, laugh.

766
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:39,375
No? Okay.

767
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:41,667
Um, do you Play?

768
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:45,667
No.
- Come on.

769
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:50,775
So...

770
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:54,358
Beautiful sounds are
about frequency ratios.

771
00:51:54,458 --> 00:52:00,238
The simpler the ratio, like this C
and this C, a simple ratio of 1:2.

772
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:02,608
Beautiful.

773
00:52:02,708 --> 00:52:05,343
Comphex harmonies, like this...

774
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,250
Ugly.

775
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:27,833
Do you want to try?

776
00:52:28,542 --> 00:52:30,542
Okay.

777
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,250
Is that right?

778
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:50,958
Yeah, it was, um...

779
00:52:51,792 --> 00:52:54,767
So you've never played before?
- No.

780
00:52:57,542 --> 00:52:59,837
All music is maths, really.

781
00:53:00,583 --> 00:53:03,728
Come on, I'll teach you the next bit.

782
00:54:31,625 --> 00:54:33,483
Is this all right?
- Oh, Christ, yeah.

783
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:36,898
Do you want me to pour it out?
- Please.

784
00:54:36,917 --> 00:54:38,942
It's nice to relax actually.
It's been a while.

785
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:40,400
There you go.
- Thank you.

786
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,325
Well, it's good that you find maths relaxing.

787
00:54:48,042 --> 00:54:51,272
Must have been very difficult for you,

788
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:53,543
being just you and Nathan.

789
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,208
You know, without...

790
00:55:02,417 --> 00:55:04,417
Michael.
- Michael.

791
00:55:04,583 --> 00:55:06,400
Sorry. Dickhead.
- No.

792
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,220
Me, not... Not Michael.
- I know.

793
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,795
Well, I mean, but you're...

794
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:18,473
You're the same. It must be the...

795
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:23,093
I mean, you're not with anyone.

796
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:25,583
No. No.
- Are you? No.

797
00:55:26,625 --> 00:55:29,340
My passion's my work, you see.

798
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:33,208
Sorry.

799
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:36,208
You all right?
- Yeah.

800
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:41,650
Sometimes I wonder if Nathan
will ever find anyone, you know?

801
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,875
Nathan's nothing like me.

802
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:47,608
If you're worried that Nathan's
gonna end up like... You shouldn't.

803
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:52,043
I wasn't. It would be a good thing.
- You shouldn't.

804
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:58,237
I might just pop off to the toilet.
- Okay.

805
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,625
Uh, I got crisps.

806
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:33,692
Oh...

807
00:56:33,792 --> 00:56:35,792
Sorry.
- It's all right.

808
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:42,067
Sorry, are you a bit stiff?
- No, what?

809
00:56:42,167 --> 00:56:44,167
I mean, your back.

810
00:56:57,333 --> 00:56:59,786
Oh...

811
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:02,108
Shit. I'm so sorry. Did I hurt you?
- It's okay. Are you all right?

812
00:57:02,208 --> 00:57:04,208
No. It's okay.

813
00:57:04,667 --> 00:57:06,858
You all right?
- Sorry. Sorry about that.

814
00:57:06,958 --> 00:57:08,958
It's okay.
- I, urn...

815
00:57:09,042 --> 00:57:11,233
I just want to say that, um...

816
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:12,900
You don't...
- For me... No, I do.

817
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:19,120
In this sort of situation there's only
so far that I am able to, urn, go.

818
00:57:19,417 --> 00:57:22,987
And I don't want to make you disappointed.

819
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:28,235
You... You couldn't. I wouldn't... Sorry.

820
00:57:30,958 --> 00:57:32,958
Yeah, I understand.

821
00:57:33,792 --> 00:57:38,637
Do you mind if we get up?
I think I'm sat on a set square.

822
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:29,645
I think it's funny that your favourite
English food is Chinese.

823
00:58:30,958 --> 00:58:33,817
Do you always like
to have everything the same?

824
00:58:33,917 --> 00:58:38,082
Because I change
my favourite things all the time.

825
00:58:38,583 --> 00:58:40,963
I don't usually like change.

826
00:58:43,167 --> 00:58:44,983
I like it here, though.
- Do you?

827
00:58:45,083 --> 00:58:47,858
I mean, the Chinese approach to maths.

828
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:49,958
Yes?

829
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:52,625
Look.

830
00:58:52,958 --> 00:58:57,533
This is called The Nine
Chapters of Mathematical Art.

831
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:01,652
This took more than 1,000 years to write.

832
00:59:02,833 --> 00:59:07,089
In China, mathematics
is more than numbers.

833
00:59:07,667 --> 00:59:10,073
Um, It is like art.

834
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:17,083
Here.

835
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:28,660
There are... There are eight prawn balls. I...

836
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,750
It needs to be a prime.

837
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:47,864
So... 20 random cards
are placed in a row all face-down.

838
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:53,672
A move consists of turning
a face-down card face-up...

839
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:59,255
...and turning over the card
immediately to the right.

840
00:59:59,458 --> 01:00:03,442
Show that no matter
what the choice of cards to turn...

841
01:00:03,542 --> 01:00:07,027
...this sequence of moves must terminate.

842
01:00:08,542 --> 01:00:12,112
Nathan, hiding in the back won't help you.

843
01:00:12,292 --> 01:00:15,522
Would you like to come up and show us?

844
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:23,583
Go on, Nathan.

845
01:00:58,042 --> 01:01:03,983
Okay, so we need to... We need to look
at the cards not as cards, but as, uh...

846
01:01:04,083 --> 01:01:06,083
As numbers.

847
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:10,496
We can call face-down cards...

848
01:01:13,667 --> 01:01:15,108
One.

849
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:18,089
Face-up cards... Zero.

850
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:23,608
And initially it would be a sequence
of ones as the cards are all face down.

851
01:01:23,708 --> 01:01:29,125
But after a while it would look
something like that.

852
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:34,530
And, as we can see, that
is a binary number.

853
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:38,733
And a move that consists of turning
a face-down card face up...

854
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:42,998
...and the card immediately
to the right of it...

855
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:46,913
...could be that a one followed by a one,

856
01:01:48,042 --> 01:01:51,527
will turn into a zero followed by a zero.

857
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:57,858
That would be like that.
Or it could be a one followed by a zero...

858
01:01:57,958 --> 01:02:01,538
...turning into a zero followed by a one.

859
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:10,125
In either case, we can see that the
number in binary is strictly decreasing.

860
01:02:11,875 --> 01:02:13,875
And that means?

861
01:02:14,917 --> 01:02:18,275
Which means that the sequence
must terminate.

862
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:19,400
Because?

863
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,942
Because you can't keep taking away
from a positive integer...

864
01:02:22,042 --> 01:02:26,037
...without it turning negative.
- No, you can't.

865
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:28,650
You definitely can't. Good work;.

866
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,750
Everyone. Good work.

867
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:09,567
Uh, hello. My name's
Martin Humphreys and I'm an alcoholic.

868
01:04:09,667 --> 01:04:11,775
No, not really. Well, a little bit.

869
01:04:11,875 --> 01:04:14,525
Um, I've got MS, that's why I'm here.
I got that group tomorrow.

870
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:16,442
Uh...

871
01:04:16,542 --> 01:04:21,442
No, seriously, thank you for
everybody who's, uh, shared and stuff.

872
01:04:21,542 --> 01:04:25,775
Because there's definitely things
that I can identify with...

873
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:28,233
...and that I definitely recognise;.

874
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:30,333
Uh...

875
01:04:31,583 --> 01:04:35,625
So, there's this person I like, but I know...

876
01:04:36,542 --> 01:04:38,837
...how bad I'm gonna get...

877
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:45,317
...and it's very difficult to imagine
any sort of a rosy future...

878
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:50,135
...or anyone wanting to be
a part of that future with me.

879
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:06,883
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Um...

880
01:05:10,333 --> 01:05:12,333
Because you...

881
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:18,208
This is ridiculous.

882
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:27,150
Because in a few years' time I might not...
I might not even be able to hold hands...

883
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:29,545
...or have a little cuddle.

884
01:05:31,458 --> 01:05:33,458
And...

885
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:40,300
That really, really scares me.

886
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,358
We should ask the others to suggest
a variety of trigonometric identities...

887
01:05:58,458 --> 01:06:02,400
...to simplify the expressions,
which could include, say, coversine...

888
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:07,685
...or possibly covercosine or versine
or excosecant and so on.

889
01:06:07,708 --> 01:06:09,692
Luke, we're trying to think of
fun questions for each other,

890
01:06:09,792 --> 01:06:12,358
we're not trying to prove how many
trigonometric identities we know.

891
01:06:12,458 --> 01:06:17,983
Well, then I really don't see the point.
We are competing with each other.

892
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:20,692
You can pretend you're everyone's
best friend all you like, Isaac,

893
01:06:20,792 --> 01:06:22,025
but I'm here to get on the team.

894
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:27,055
Sorry, when have I ever tried
to be your best friend, Luke?

895
01:06:28,667 --> 01:06:31,150
Nathan, this is a democracy,
yours is the casting vote.

896
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:35,108
Yes. Democracy in the true Chinese
sense of the word. Forget it.

897
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:37,942
We'll just do your question...
- Are you gonna sulk?

898
01:06:38,042 --> 01:06:40,042
Boo-hoo-hoo, poor Luke.

899
01:06:49,667 --> 01:06:51,667
Sorry.

900
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:54,692
I've come across people like him before.
- Definitely autistic.

901
01:06:54,792 --> 01:06:57,858
He seems to have picked up all the
bad traits and none of the good.

902
01:06:57,958 --> 01:07:00,338
What bad traits?
- Obsessive.

903
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:04,278
Socially incompetent.
- That sort of thing.

904
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:11,345
It's about adaptability, Nathan.

905
01:07:12,667 --> 01:07:17,342
Sometimes we have to change our shape
so that we fit in.

906
01:07:20,792 --> 01:07:21,817
That was you pushing the cage.

907
01:07:21,917 --> 01:07:26,243
I did not.
- Yes, you did. Polly.

908
01:07:27,708 --> 01:07:29,708
Polly Parrot, wake up.

909
01:07:30,708 --> 01:07:32,708
Polly.

910
01:07:33,125 --> 01:07:36,185
Now that's what I call a dead parrot.

911
01:07:38,875 --> 01:07:42,573
I love this. It's stinky tofu.

912
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Stinky?

913
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:48,905
Oh, that's horrible.

914
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:53,115
It stinks but it tastes really, really good.

915
01:07:53,583 --> 01:07:54,775
Oh, look.

916
01:07:54,875 --> 01:08:00,315
I used lo play this when I was small,
in my hometown, as a child.

917
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,233
A sweet.

918
01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:07,025
It's sticky.
- It's stuck in my teeth.

919
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:09,756
You have a funny face.

920
01:08:12,167 --> 01:08:16,757
You don't like it? I'll eat it.
And you can have this'.

921
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:22,275
We should, uh... We should probably go.

922
01:08:22,375 --> 01:08:23,400
Aren't you...

923
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,650
Aren't you worried about the exam?

924
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:29,915
Well, it is good to have a break.
Clear your mind.

925
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:36,233
Don't worry. We will both get into
the Olympiad in Cambridge. The IMO.

926
01:08:36,333 --> 01:08:40,525
And I will meet your family
when I come and stay with you.

927
01:08:40,625 --> 01:08:42,625
My cultural exchange.

928
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:45,875
Ah.

929
01:08:45,917 --> 01:08:47,917
Look at this.

930
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:55,648
You're a bit like a turtle, aren't you?

931
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,500
In your shell.

932
01:09:00,875 --> 01:09:02,875
Come on.

933
01:09:12,708 --> 01:09:16,655
In China, do boys like me get bullied?

934
01:09:18,333 --> 01:09:20,333
'Bullied'?

935
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:24,817
You know, like when people treat you
badly because you're clever.

936
01:09:24,917 --> 01:09:26,917
Why would they do that?

937
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:30,442
I wish England was more like China.

938
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:33,262
I wish China was more like here.

939
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,655
In China we have to succeed for the family.

940
01:09:38,417 --> 01:09:40,627
Especially for Uncle Deng.

941
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:48,004
Some people say that I am only here
because of him.

942
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:52,320
That's not true. No, you're really clever.

943
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:55,500
Thank you.

944
01:09:56,542 --> 01:09:58,542
And you're very nice.

945
01:10:00,292 --> 01:10:03,302
Prawn ball. Turtle boy.

946
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:55,483
Alternate team seating.

947
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:58,442
UK team member, Chinese team member.

948
01:10:58,542 --> 01:11:03,302
Alternative seating.
UK team member, Chinese team member.

949
01:11:08,042 --> 01:11:10,042
IMO conditions apply.

950
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:14,812
White card if you request some paper.

951
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:17,833
A blue for water.

952
01:11:19,042 --> 01:11:22,272
Green if you need to go to the toilet.

953
01:11:22,833 --> 01:11:27,483
Yellow to ask a question
but only in the first half-hour.

954
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:33,067
And red if you've left the gas on at home
or something and you need to leave.

955
01:11:33,167 --> 01:11:39,627
The six of you who score highest will
represent Team UK, no 'ifs', no 'buts'.

956
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:45,875
You may begin.

957
01:11:58,375 --> 01:12:02,965
'Each integer is coloured
either red, yellow or green.'

958
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:07,753
'Show that there always exist A, B, C,'

959
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:13,329
'such that A, B, C,.'

960
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,667
'A plus B, A plus C...'

961
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:22,703
'A plus B, A plus C, B plus C
and A plus B plus C'

962
01:12:23,292 --> 01:12:25,502
'are all the same colour.'

963
01:13:13,708 --> 01:13:18,129
Right. No point in dilly-dallying, I suppose.

964
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:21,858
I'll pin your scores up on the board
in a second.

965
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:23,858
The five outstanding students...

966
01:13:23,958 --> 01:13:29,143
...guaranteed a place at the IMO
in Cambridge this year are...

967
01:13:29,417 --> 01:13:31,192
Isaac.

968
01:13:31,292 --> 01:13:33,292
Lee Jing.

969
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,500
Rebecca.

970
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,500
Pav. And Ben.

971
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:44,983
The last place was very tight
between Nathan and Luke.

972
01:13:45,083 --> 01:13:49,192
Both scores somewhat disappointing, but
one of you will have to go to Cambridge.

973
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:52,741
So, by the smallest fraction of a point,

974
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:56,895
the last place on the team goes to...

975
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:01,750
Nathan.

976
01:14:02,833 --> 01:14:06,192
The six of you will be hosting
the Chinese team at your own homes...

977
01:14:06,292 --> 01:14:08,525
...and I'll see you all
in Cambridge next week.

978
01:14:08,625 --> 01:14:10,920
Onward, Christian soldiers.

979
01:14:33,083 --> 01:14:35,715
A real Taiwanese last supper.

980
01:14:36,583 --> 01:14:41,067
'As the old proverb say,
â€œSlowly, slowly, catchy prawn.'

981
01:14:41,167 --> 01:14:46,067
Now, you put your bait on the hooks
and you put your hooks in the water.

982
01:14:46,167 --> 01:14:50,672
Don't worry, Nathan.
I only just made the team myself.

983
01:14:52,125 --> 01:14:54,250
We should be celebrating.

984
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Okay.

985
01:14:59,667 --> 01:15:01,192
He's so strange.

986
01:15:01,292 --> 01:15:04,692
At least we don't have to see him again.

987
01:15:05,833 --> 01:15:07,833
What a dick.

988
01:15:09,542 --> 01:15:11,542
Ah. Ah.
- What do I do?

989
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Yes.

990
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I'm sorry.

991
01:15:24,875 --> 01:15:26,025
How's it going?
- Good.

992
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:27,650
These two are tender?
- Not yet.

993
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:31,067
Not yet. I have this all under control,
thank you very much. It's fine.

994
01:15:31,167 --> 01:15:33,717
Okay, okay. You're the expert.

995
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:37,150
I think these ones... Can I get a plate?

996
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:43,375
Smells good.

997
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:50,900
Have you seen this?
Now that's what I call a dead prawn.

998
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,192
This prawn is definitely deceased.

999
01:15:53,292 --> 01:15:55,650
When I bought it half-hour ago,
you assured me...

1000
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:58,983
...that its lack of movement was due to
it being tired and shagged out.

1001
01:15:59,083 --> 01:16:01,083
Oh, my God.

1002
01:16:01,375 --> 01:16:04,010
'Say, â€œNo, no, it's resting.'

1003
01:16:04,333 --> 01:16:07,427
What?
- Say, 'No, no, it's resting.'

1004
01:16:09,792 --> 01:16:10,942
No, no, it's resting.

1005
01:16:11,042 --> 01:16:15,608
All right, then.
Well, if it's resting, I'll wake it up.

1006
01:16:15,708 --> 01:16:19,051
Hello, Prawny. Prawny, wake up.

1007
01:16:19,917 --> 01:16:23,192
This prawn wouldn't wake up
if I put 4,000 volts through it.

1008
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:25,817
It's bleedin' demised.
It has ceased to be.

1009
01:16:25,917 --> 01:16:27,983
It's expired and gone to meet its maker.

1010
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:30,083
This is an ex-prawn.

1011
01:16:34,625 --> 01:16:37,175
Seriously, Luke, what are you?

1012
01:16:38,625 --> 01:16:40,835
Well, what are you, Isaac?

1013
01:16:41,333 --> 01:16:44,442
â€œI find everything so easy
and I have everything.

1014
01:16:44,542 --> 01:16:51,257
'And I'm gonna go out of my way to make
sure that you're not happy at all. â€œ.'

1015
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:59,525
Remarkable bird,
the Norwegian Blue. Beautiful plumage.

1016
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:02,525
The plumage don't enter into it.
It's stone-dead.

1017
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:04,750
No, no, no. It's resting.

1018
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:08,998
All Right, then.
If it's resting, I'll wake it up.

1019
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:14,067
Hello, Polly. I got a nice Cuttlefish
for you when you wake up, Polly Parrot.

1020
01:17:14,167 --> 01:17:16,887
There, it moved.
- No, it didn't.

1021
01:17:27,292 --> 01:17:29,025
Nathan.

1022
01:17:29,125 --> 01:17:31,125
Nathan...

1023
01:17:31,167 --> 01:17:33,167
It's fine.

1024
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,750
I've done it before.

1025
01:17:37,375 --> 01:17:40,605
Just got a bit carried away this time.

1026
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:47,238
How did your mum and
dad explain it to you?

1027
01:17:47,583 --> 01:17:49,583
When they found out.

1028
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:54,512
I presume you've been diagnosed.

1029
01:17:56,333 --> 01:17:58,716
Mine said it made me unique.

1030
01:18:02,167 --> 01:18:05,907
'â€œNo one wants to be ordinary,' they said.

1031
01:18:08,958 --> 01:18:11,423
It's all right being weird...

1032
01:18:12,458 --> 01:18:14,838
...as long as you're gifted.

1033
01:18:16,917 --> 01:18:19,722
But if you're not gifted, then...

1034
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:24,250
That just leaves weird.

1035
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:26,750
Doesn't it?

1036
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:29,875
You are gifted, Luke.

1037
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,500
I don't even enjoy it.

1038
01:18:35,833 --> 01:18:37,833
Maths.

1039
01:18:39,167 --> 01:18:41,167
Isn't that stupid?

1040
01:18:46,458 --> 01:18:48,458
What's the point?

1041
01:19:11,417 --> 01:19:13,417
Right, away you go.

1042
01:19:18,917 --> 01:19:20,917
Your chariot awaits.

1043
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:24,877
Nathan, can I have a word?

1044
01:19:35,083 --> 01:19:39,588
When I speak to people
of a non-mathematical nature,

1045
01:19:41,167 --> 01:19:46,483
they always struggle with the notion
that mathematics can be beautiful.

1046
01:19:46,583 --> 01:19:50,238
But if beauty is truth and truth is beauty,

1047
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:54,775
well, then surely mathematics
is the most beautiful thing of all.

1048
01:19:54,875 --> 01:19:56,875
Ng?

1049
01:19:58,333 --> 01:20:01,903
There is rare beauty in your work, Nathan.

1050
01:20:02,958 --> 01:20:08,058
But you are unpredictable and inconsistent.
Which worries me.

1051
01:20:08,333 --> 01:20:11,983
You need to focus
if you're gonna win a medal.

1052
01:20:12,083 --> 01:20:15,908
And don't be distracted
by your Chinese guest.

1053
01:20:49,292 --> 01:20:51,292
Oh, cai hang.

1054
01:20:51,792 --> 01:20:55,362
Uh, the rainbow.
- Yeah, rainbow, cai hang.

1055
01:20:55,792 --> 01:20:57,483
Cai hang.
- Yeah.

1056
01:20:57,583 --> 01:20:59,583
Cai hang.
- Cai hang.

1057
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:03,750
So beautiful.

1058
01:21:23,333 --> 01:21:26,053
Welcome home. Hi, darling.
- Hey.

1059
01:21:26,208 --> 01:21:29,013
Hi, darling... Hi.
- Welcome back.

1060
01:21:30,208 --> 01:21:32,958
Hi. Hello, sweetheart.

1061
01:21:33,542 --> 01:21:34,567
Hi.
- Hi.

1062
01:21:34,667 --> 01:21:37,067
How do you pronounce your name?
- Uh, Zhang Mei.

1063
01:21:37,167 --> 01:21:41,442
Zhang Mei. Julie. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1064
01:21:41,542 --> 01:21:44,064
We put a little... Wait,
it's coming round now.

1065
01:21:44,164 --> 01:21:45,525
Cambridge, here we come.

1066
01:21:45,625 --> 01:21:47,842
Whoo-whomwhoo-whoo.

1067
01:21:49,292 --> 01:21:52,097
Why did you get my train set out?

1068
01:21:52,667 --> 01:21:54,667
Um... Nathan...

1069
01:21:56,875 --> 01:21:58,875
Sorry.

1070
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:04,010
Welcome to England.
- Thank you.

1071
01:22:09,208 --> 01:22:10,858
Nathan.

1072
01:22:10,958 --> 01:22:14,783
Nathan, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about the train.

1073
01:22:19,958 --> 01:22:22,253
So that's Zhang Mei, is it?

1074
01:22:23,167 --> 01:22:25,167
What's she like?

1075
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:27,250
She's... She's clever.

1076
01:22:29,292 --> 01:22:31,292
And she's nice, too.

1077
01:22:32,125 --> 01:22:35,270
Sounds to me like you quite like her.

1078
01:22:35,542 --> 01:22:37,400
Of course I like her.

1079
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:42,454
Than you normally like; Things;.

1080
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:45,218
You know, uh, like more than...

1081
01:22:46,792 --> 01:22:49,044
Ice cream. Or...

1082
01:22:50,583 --> 01:22:52,275
Or maths.

1083
01:22:52,375 --> 01:22:56,200
I don't like anything more than I like maths.

1084
01:22:57,333 --> 01:23:01,158
Nathan, darling, I wish you'd just called me.

1085
01:23:01,583 --> 01:23:04,898
Let me know that you're okay, you know?

1086
01:23:05,833 --> 01:23:07,833
Why?

1087
01:23:07,958 --> 01:23:10,625
Well, because, darling...

1088
01:23:12,875 --> 01:23:14,875
I like you...

1089
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,795
More than I like ice cream.

1090
01:23:27,333 --> 01:23:29,883
I said she could have my room.

1091
01:23:31,625 --> 01:23:34,260
That's very gentlemanly of you.

1092
01:23:34,625 --> 01:23:37,275
Isn't that the right thing to do?

1093
01:23:37,375 --> 01:23:39,375
Yes.

1094
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:43,830
So, I'm... I'm blowing this up
for you then, am I?

1095
01:23:43,875 --> 01:23:47,275
Yeah. But, uh, can I have it in my room?

1096
01:23:49,667 --> 01:23:51,667
Zhang Mei's in there.

1097
01:23:52,542 --> 01:23:54,542
We might want to study.

1098
01:24:01,542 --> 01:24:06,745
So, that man today, he is not your father?

1099
01:24:08,875 --> 01:24:12,703
No, he's my teacher. My father died.

1100
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:16,750
I'm sorry, Nathan.

1101
01:24:18,167 --> 01:24:20,167
It's not your fault.

1102
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:25,382
I mean, I feel sad for you.

1103
01:24:27,125 --> 01:24:31,630
It must be hard to lose someone
that you love so much.

1104
01:25:09,042 --> 01:25:10,733
You think it will work?

1105
01:25:10,833 --> 01:25:13,678
100%? I hope so.

1106
01:25:16,167 --> 01:25:19,367
We did it. It actually works.

1107
01:26:08,042 --> 01:26:11,697
Right-oh, observers. It's time to assemble.

1108
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:13,983
Panama hats, Richard? Really?

1109
01:26:14,083 --> 01:26:16,150
Yes, it was a consensus decision.

1110
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:19,900
I discussed it with myself
and I decided it would be a good idea.

1111
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,150
Are you sure you're not
too rusty for all this?

1112
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:24,692
I can manage a bit of shepherding.

1113
01:26:24,792 --> 01:26:28,233
Been Nathan's teacher for seven years,
I wanna see this through.

1114
01:26:28,333 --> 01:26:30,192
He's a very sensitive kid.

1115
01:26:30,292 --> 01:26:34,287
Yeah, yeah, I suppose children
are like animals.

1116
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:38,065
You get attached to them after a while.

1117
01:26:43,208 --> 01:26:46,693
Oh, my gosh.
Is this where you're staying?

1118
01:26:47,333 --> 01:26:49,333
Oh, wow.

1119
01:26:50,375 --> 01:26:52,375
Oh...

1120
01:26:55,333 --> 01:26:56,858
Well...

1121
01:26:56,958 --> 01:27:00,692
So, um, you've got your phone on you
and you know you can call me any time.

1122
01:27:00,792 --> 01:27:02,792
So...

1123
01:27:04,542 --> 01:27:06,582
I'll be thinking of you.

1124
01:27:06,667 --> 01:27:08,667
Okay. Well, goodbye.

1125
01:27:10,542 --> 01:27:12,317
Goodbye.
- Bye.

1126
01:27:12,417 --> 01:27:13,650
Bye.
- Bye.

1127
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:15,750
Bye, darling.

1128
01:27:21,708 --> 01:27:25,466
What are you doing?
- I was taking your hand.

1129
01:27:26,625 --> 01:27:28,625
Come on.

1130
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,108
You let go.

1131
01:27:32,208 --> 01:27:35,159
Isaac Newton. G.H. Hardy.

1132
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:38,702
Ramanujan. Bertrand Russell.

1133
01:27:39,542 --> 01:27:42,983
They all began their
mathematical journeys here.

1134
01:27:43,083 --> 01:27:46,400
Trinity alumni have accumulated
thirty two Nobel prizes...

1135
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:49,525
...and no less than four Fields Medals.

1136
01:27:49,625 --> 01:27:52,067
Although Russell did go off the rails
somewhat later in his career.

1137
01:27:52,167 --> 01:27:56,400
But nevertheless,
this is the most prestigious place...

1138
01:27:56,500 --> 01:28:00,733
...to study mathematics on the planet.
And you are here.

1139
01:28:00,833 --> 01:28:04,913
Because they are the past
and you are the future.

1140
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:07,750
So don't let me down.

1141
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:13,650
Ladies and gentlemen,

1142
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:16,275
I would like to welcome; You.
To the 59th International.

1143
01:28:16,375 --> 01:28:19,350
Mathematical Olympiad in Cambridge.

1144
01:28:23,208 --> 01:28:25,333
Please welcome Australia.

1145
01:28:37,208 --> 01:28:39,758
A warm welcome for Bangladesh.

1146
01:28:43,167 --> 01:28:45,167
Canada.

1147
01:28:47,167 --> 01:28:49,802
The People's Republic of China.

1148
01:28:57,583 --> 01:29:00,898
A round of applause for United Kingdom.

1149
01:29:26,792 --> 01:29:28,792
Nathan?
- Yeah?

1150
01:29:32,042 --> 01:29:34,042
I can'. Sleep.

1151
01:29:34,958 --> 01:29:39,718
You can, uh, stay here if you want.
Like... Like at home.

1152
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:46,125
What are you reading?

1153
01:29:48,958 --> 01:29:52,783
It's the Ten Years of
Mathematical Challenges,

1154
01:29:53,083 --> 01:29:55,083
'97 to '06 edition.

1155
01:30:07,958 --> 01:30:09,958
Oh.

1156
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:12,750
I'm sorry.

1157
01:30:37,208 --> 01:30:39,208
Is that right?

1158
01:30:39,208 --> 01:30:41,208
Yes.

1159
01:30:55,667 --> 01:30:57,667
Are you okay?

1160
01:31:18,625 --> 01:31:21,968
I am glad I am here with you.

1161
01:31:24,333 --> 01:31:26,333
Me, too.

1162
01:32:58,458 --> 01:33:02,525
I can't be here with people
thinking I don't deserve it.

1163
01:33:02,625 --> 01:33:05,275
Why don't you just stay
until the end of the competition?

1164
01:33:05,375 --> 01:33:07,375
No, Nathan.

1165
01:33:12,167 --> 01:33:14,300
Nathan...

1166
01:33:15,667 --> 01:33:17,667
Just because...

1167
01:33:19,292 --> 01:33:22,326
Just because I'm going, it...

1168
01:33:25,583 --> 01:33:27,623
It does not mean that...

1169
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:33,448
I don't find myself liking you.

1170
01:34:15,958 --> 01:34:17,817
Excuse me. Sorry.

1171
01:34:17,917 --> 01:34:20,133
Nathan? Um...

1172
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:25,320
Did you get into trouble? About Zhang Mei?

1173
01:34:26,292 --> 01:34:30,369
I think I might have accidentally...

1174
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:34,070
...sort of mentioned something to someone.

1175
01:34:35,042 --> 01:34:38,612
I didn't mean to hurt anyone. It's just...

1176
01:34:42,208 --> 01:34:44,208
Anyway...

1177
01:34:45,542 --> 01:34:47,542
I'm sorry.

1178
01:34:53,792 --> 01:34:54,942
Oi. Oggy.

1179
01:34:55,042 --> 01:34:57,042
Oi.
- 099v, easy, my.

1180
01:34:57,083 --> 01:34:59,083
Oi, Oi, Oi.

1181
01:35:04,083 --> 01:35:05,525
Hello, Nathan.

1182
01:35:05,625 --> 01:35:10,192
I know, I know, I know. I know you said
not to bother you, but I just, um...

1183
01:35:10,292 --> 01:35:13,775
Well, I just wanted to...
I wanted to cheer on Team Nathan.

1184
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:15,875
Go, Nathan.

1185
01:35:16,042 --> 01:35:19,733
Anyway, urn, I'll be
waiting outside and, uh...

1186
01:35:19,833 --> 01:35:21,567
Best of luck, darling.

1187
01:35:21,667 --> 01:35:24,217
There's no such thing as luck.

1188
01:35:25,667 --> 01:35:27,667
No.

1189
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:10,442
Nathan.

1190
01:36:10,542 --> 01:36:14,567
I'm gonna be circling, so I'll try and
slip you some of the answers, all right?

1191
01:36:14,667 --> 01:36:16,667
That's cheating.

1192
01:36:16,875 --> 01:36:18,875
You know I was joking.

1193
01:36:20,042 --> 01:36:22,252
You're gonna be all right.

1194
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:34,758
Four hours and 30 minutes.
You may begin.

1195
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:48,325
'4n squared trains
are arranged in a 2n x Zn square'

1196
01:36:48,792 --> 01:36:51,692
'and each is painted with
one of four colours.'

1197
01:36:51,792 --> 01:36:57,232
'Every 2 x 2 square of trains
involves each of the four colours.'

1198
01:36:59,083 --> 01:37:01,888
'Every 2 x 2 square of trains...'

1199
01:37:02,542 --> 01:37:06,150
'Every 2 x 2 square of trains
involves each of the four colours.'

1200
01:37:06,250 --> 01:37:08,460
'Prove that the trains...'

1201
01:37:10,167 --> 01:37:14,483
'Prove that the trains on
the comers of the Zn x 2n square'

1202
01:37:14,583 --> 01:37:17,728
'are painted with different colours.'

1203
01:38:04,208 --> 01:38:08,713
It must be hard to lose someone
that you love so much.

1204
01:38:47,333 --> 01:38:49,373
What's the matter, mate?

1205
01:39:00,042 --> 01:39:01,858
Nathan?

1206
01:39:01,958 --> 01:39:03,958
Nathan.

1207
01:39:04,708 --> 01:39:06,708
Nathan.

1208
01:39:13,708 --> 01:39:16,853
Open the door. Martin, open the door.

1209
01:39:17,042 --> 01:39:19,592
Open the door, Martin. Martin.

1210
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:22,250
Martin.

1211
01:39:25,708 --> 01:39:27,708
Nathan?

1212
01:39:28,625 --> 01:39:30,625
Nathan.

1213
01:39:33,167 --> 01:39:35,775
Where's he going?
- I don't know.

1214
01:39:35,875 --> 01:39:38,108
He just wanted to go, Julie.
I could see it in his eyes.

1215
01:39:38,208 --> 01:39:42,416
And I'm sorry,
I didn't wanna stop him. I'm sorry.

1216
01:39:43,833 --> 01:39:45,833
It's okay.

1217
01:39:54,542 --> 01:39:56,542
Nathan?

1218
01:39:58,208 --> 01:40:00,208
Nathan?

1219
01:40:30,125 --> 01:40:32,930
Zhang Mei said that she liked me.

1220
01:40:33,833 --> 01:40:35,833
Right.

1221
01:40:36,125 --> 01:40:38,125
That's a...

1222
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:42,300
That's a good thing, isn't it?

1223
01:40:44,750 --> 01:40:47,775
And do you... Do you think that you might...

1224
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:51,632
...have those kind of feelings, too?

1225
01:40:53,083 --> 01:40:55,083
I don't know.
- Hmm.

1226
01:40:55,875 --> 01:40:59,190
I've been trying to work it out. But...

1227
01:41:00,333 --> 01:41:04,243
I found a formula. I just can't understand it.

1228
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,995
Well, as far as I know, Nathan,
no one ever has.

1229
01:41:11,125 --> 01:41:14,704
I know that when... When I'm around her,

1230
01:41:15,875 --> 01:41:18,170
my brain works differently.

1231
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:26,040
And my body feels strange and I don't
know what it means or why it matters.

1232
01:41:26,667 --> 01:41:28,667
Why it matters?

1233
01:41:29,708 --> 01:41:31,708
It matters because...

1234
01:41:33,958 --> 01:41:35,958
Well, when...

1235
01:41:36,375 --> 01:41:38,508
When somebody loves you,

1236
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:44,707
it means that they see something in you...

1237
01:41:46,875 --> 01:41:51,210
That they think is worth something.
So it sort of...

1238
01:41:52,333 --> 01:41:54,333
It adds value to you.

1239
01:41:58,792 --> 01:42:00,792
But it can be hard...

1240
01:42:02,292 --> 01:42:05,871
You know,
when you love someone and they...

1241
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,275
They show no sign that
they love you back, then ifs...

1242
01:42:10,375 --> 01:42:13,090
Then it's unequal. Or, um...

1243
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:18,220
When... When someone you love...

1244
01:42:23,042 --> 01:42:25,422
...ls subtracted from you...

1245
01:42:28,625 --> 01:42:33,858
Then it feels like, you know,
that your value is less than it was.

1246
01:42:33,958 --> 01:42:35,958
Does that make sense?

1247
01:42:43,292 --> 01:42:45,292
Why did he have to go?

1248
01:42:46,792 --> 01:42:48,792
I don't know.

1249
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:52,810
It just doesn't make sense.
- I know.

1250
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:57,344
It never will. It was an accident.

1251
01:42:58,417 --> 01:43:00,608
Things made sense when I was with him.

1252
01:43:00,708 --> 01:43:02,708
But why? Why...

1253
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:06,130
What did he do that I don't?

1254
01:43:07,292 --> 01:43:10,692
How did he make sense of things for you?

1255
01:43:17,667 --> 01:43:19,667
Nathan?

1256
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:24,293
1 don't know,
he made me laugh and...

1257
01:43:26,542 --> 01:43:28,837
He stuck chips up his nose.

1258
01:43:29,583 --> 01:43:31,583
What?

1259
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:35,795
He stuck chips up his nose?

1260
01:43:40,958 --> 01:43:44,783
Oh, okay, well, I'll stick a chip up my nose.

1261
01:43:46,458 --> 01:43:48,458
Talk to me now?

1262
01:43:54,375 --> 01:43:56,375
Nathan?

1263
01:43:58,792 --> 01:44:00,792
Nathan.

1264
01:44:01,417 --> 01:44:04,307
Nathan, it's all right. It's okay.

1265
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:08,250
It hurts.

1266
01:44:09,125 --> 01:44:11,250
I know, darling. Me, too.

1267
01:44:16,542 --> 01:44:18,025
Come here.

1268
01:44:18,125 --> 01:44:20,125
It's all right.

1269
01:44:21,125 --> 01:44:25,460
It's all right, it's all right, good boy.
It's okay.

1270
01:44:44,083 --> 01:44:46,083
Hey, hey.

1271
01:44:50,333 --> 01:44:52,333
Where is Zhang Mei now?

1272
01:44:53,542 --> 01:44:56,347
She... She's gone to the station.

1273
01:44:57,542 --> 01:44:59,922
Do you wanna fetch her back?

1274
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:02,483
Yeah.

1275
01:45:02,583 --> 01:45:04,878
Okay, we'd better be quick.

1276
01:45:13,542 --> 01:45:15,542
What?

1277
01:45:16,458 --> 01:45:18,458
Nothing.

1278
01:45:41,875 --> 01:45:46,650
# Miss you terribly already
Miss the space between your eyelids...

1279
01:45:46,750 --> 01:45:49,358
...# Where I'd stare
through awkward sentences...

1280
01:45:49,458 --> 01:45:51,567
...# And avoid through awkward silence...

1281
01:45:51,667 --> 01:45:56,192
...# Miss your teeth when they chatter
when we smoked out in my garden...

1282
01:45:56,292 --> 01:45:59,275
...# When we couldn't sleep for all the heat.

1283
01:45:59,375 --> 01:46:01,483
# Soft talk began to harden...

1284
01:46:01,583 --> 01:46:04,108
...# Miss your small hands
in the palm of mine...

1285
01:46:04,208 --> 01:46:06,275
...# The fact they're good at making...

1286
01:46:06,375 --> 01:46:08,775
...# Miss your sitting up incessantly...

1287
01:46:08,875 --> 01:46:13,380
...# And the fact you're always
waking in the night...

1288
01:46:15,667 --> 01:46:18,701
...# The night...

1289
01:46:22,708 --> 01:46:24,708
...# And I...

1290
01:46:26,083 --> 01:46:29,497
...# I hope for your life...

1291
01:46:31,292 --> 01:46:33,828
...# You forget about mine...

1292
01:46:36,208 --> 01:46:39,408
...# Forget about mine...

1293
01:46:44,583 --> 01:46:46,942
...# Miss your teeth dug in my shoulder...

1294
01:46:47,042 --> 01:46:49,442
...# As we rolled in early mornings...

1295
01:46:49,542 --> 01:46:51,483
...# Miss your arm dying beneath me.

1296
01:46:51,583 --> 01:46:54,150
# As I lay there, simply yawning...

1297
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:55,317
...# Please forget me...

1298
01:46:55,417 --> 01:46:56,525
...# You were right, dear...

1299
01:46:56,625 --> 01:46:59,108
...# I am cold and self-involved...

1300
01:46:59,208 --> 01:47:01,650
...# And though I'll miss you, recent lover...

1301
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:03,983
...# lam weak and therefore fold...

1302
01:47:04,083 --> 01:47:06,150
...# Get distracted by my music...

1303
01:47:06,250 --> 01:47:08,650
...# Think of nothing else but art...

1304
01:47:08,750 --> 01:47:11,108
...# I'll write my loneliness in poems...

1305
01:47:11,208 --> 01:47:13,858
...# If I can just think how to start...

1306
01:47:13,958 --> 01:47:16,317
...# Dot my I's with eyebrow pencils...

1307
01:47:16,417 --> 01:47:18,442
...# Close my eyelids, hide my eyes...

1308
01:47:18,542 --> 01:47:20,900
...# I'll be idle in my ideals...

1309
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,129
...# Think of nothing else but.

1310
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:26,467
# And I...

1311
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:31,164
...# And I...

1312
01:47:34,833 --> 01:47:37,299
...# And I...

1313
01:47:38,542 --> 01:47:42,370
...# I hope for your life.

1314
01:47:43,625 --> 01:47:46,659
# You can forget about mine...

1315
01:47:48,292 --> 01:47:52,831
...# Just forget about mine...

1316
01:47:54,625 --> 01:47:58,204
...# And mine

1317
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,378
# Mine #
