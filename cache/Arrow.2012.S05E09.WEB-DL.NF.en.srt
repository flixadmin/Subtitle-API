00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:24,092
TO REWATCH THAT MOVIE
LAST WEEK.

160
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,470
IT REMINDED ME HOW MUCH WORK
I STILL HAVE TO DO,

161
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,349
HOW MUCH WORK
ALL OF US STILL HAVE TO DO,

162
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,518
AND IT INSPIRED ME
TO RECOMMIT MYSELF

163
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,688
TO MAKING OUR CITY,
OUR HOME

164
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,066
A BETTER AND A SAFER PLACE.

165

-HEY.
-HOW YOU FEELING?

201
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,270
LIKE SOMEONE THREW
A THROWING STAR AT ME,

202
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:41,980
KICKED ME DOWN
A FLIGHT OF STEPS,

203
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,273
AND KNOCKED ME OUT.

204
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,652
THE DOCTOR SAID
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO SIT UP.

205
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:51,614
YEAH. WELL, THE DOC
DOESN'T KNOW ME THAT WELL.

206
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,825
NOT SURE I DO
ANYMORE EITHER.

207
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,327
I CAN EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING.

208
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,496
GREAT. LET'S START
WITH WHERE YOU
LEARNED

209
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,621
TO FIGHT LIKE THAT.

210
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,956
FIGHT LIKE WHAT?

211
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,083
I CASE YOU HADN'T NOTICED,
I LOST BADLY.

212
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,170
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW
WHO THAT WAS, CURTIS.

213
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,880
THAT WAS THE THROWING
STAR KILLER.

214
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,841
HE'S MURDERED PEOPLE,
AND YET SOMEHOW,
YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.

215
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,177
HOW IS THAT EVEN
POSSIBLE?

CURTIS, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

LIKE I ALWAYS AM WHEN I
GET INTO STREET FIGHTS
WITH MUGGERS.

219
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,601
IT WASN'T A MUGGER.

220
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,813
IT WAS A SERIAL KILLER,
THE THROWING STAR KILLER.

221
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,316
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
THE ANTI-CRIME UNIT

STATEMENT COULD REALLY HELP.

HE ATTACKED ME
AS, WELL, ME.

230
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,215
SO HE KNOWS YOU'RE
MR. TERRIFIC.

231
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,467
YEAH, WHICH MEANS
HE PROBABLY KNOWS...

CAN'T YOU?
YOU THINK I HAVEN'T

239
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,030
FIGURED OUT THAT
THE TALL GUY
IN THE BLACK MASK

240
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,199
ROLLING WITH
THE GREEN ARROW WAS CURTIS?

241
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,825
PROMISE ME YOU DIDN'T
TELL PAUL.

242
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,370
NO, BUT RIGHT NOW,
I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

243
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,789
IF PROMETHEUS IS TARGETING
THE PEOPLE WORKING
WITH THE GREEN ARROW...

244
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,207
-I'LL BE FINE.
-AND I'LL FEEL BETTER

245
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,542
IF YOU'RE STAYING
AT MY PLACE,

246
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:28,128
AT LEAST UNTIL WE
TRACK DOWN PROMETHEUS.

247
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,880
-WE?
-IT'S MY JOB, FELICITY.

248
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,799
IF THERE'S A KILLER
OUT THERE, I'M GONNA
STOP HIM,

249
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,051
ESPECIALLY IF HE'S
A THREAT TO SOMEONE
I CARE ABOUT.

EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

253
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,188
NO. THE DOCTOR WAS
SPEAKING WITH CURTIS.

254
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,524
HE'S GONNA BE FINE,
BUT THEY FOUND A DRUG
IN HIS SYSTEM

255
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,733
CALLED DYCLOSERAL.

256
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,236
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT.

257
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,113
BUT YOU HAVE.
WHAT IS IT?

258
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,496

SOME ADJUSTING

259

NOT TRYING TO
CATCH YOU GIVING
ME THE SLIP.

260
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:06,916
I GRABBED
SOME BIG BELLY
ON THE WAY IN.

261
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,168
HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY.

262
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,752
I LOST MY APPETITE.

263
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,212
COME LOOK AT THIS.

264
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:16,259
JOHN: TB OUTBREAK
IN LAMB VALLEY? SINCE WHEN?

265
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,927
SINCE THIS GUY
GOT GREEDY.

266
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,429
THAT'S ONE SMUG-LOOKING
SON OF A BITCH.

267
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,473
JUSTIN CLAYBOURNE OWNS
CLAYBOURNE PHARMACEUTICALS

268
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,475
THAT RECENTLY
ACQUIRED THE RIGHTS

269
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,768
TO THIS DRUG
DYCLOSERAL,

270
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,396
WHICH FIGHTS THIS
PARTICULAR STRAIN OF TB.

271
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,897
LET ME GUESS.
AS SOON AS THE
OUTBREAK STARTED,

272
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,399
HE JACKED UP
THE PRICES.

273
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,193
PRICE WENT FROM $10
A PILL TO $1,000 OVERNIGHT.

274
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,279
THE PEOPLE IN LAMB VALLEY,
THEY'RE WORKING CLASS,
LOW INCOME.

275
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,696
THEY CAN'T AFFORD THIS.

276
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,574
WELL, IT'S DISGUSTING
BUT NOT ILLEGAL.

277
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,535
CLAYBOURNE IS
ON THE LIST.

278
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,578
I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT ILLEGAL.

279
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,788
JUST BECAUSE YOUR
FATHER WROTE DOWN
HIS NAME?

280
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,458
MY FATHER EXPLAINED
THIS LIST.

281
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,001
THESE ARE TERRIBLE PEOPLE.

282
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,794
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT?
I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD.

283
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,712
I AM GONNA MAKE SURE
THAT CLAYBOURNE STOPS
GOUGING PEOPLE.

284
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,256
AND WHAT IF HE REFUSES
TO COOPERATE.

285
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,551
YOU ASK THAT LIKE
HE HAS A CHOICE.

286
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,309
BETHANY SNOW:
<i>AFTER WHAT SEEMS LIKE A RESPITE</i>

287
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,894
<i>FROM THE
SERIAL MURDERS WEEKS AGO,</i>

288
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,605
<i>THE THROWING STAR KILLER
STRIKES AGAIN.</i>

289
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,607
<i>ANOTHER ATTACK
BY THE THROWING STAR KILLER</i>

290
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:16,444
<i>DISRUPTED THE ANNUAL
HOLIDAY PARTY AT CITY HALL.</i>

291
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,239
MAYBE WE SHOULD CHANGE
THE SECURITY CODES
ON THE BUNKER.

292
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,700
AND WE DID THAT
OVER AN HOUR AGO.

293
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,950
RENE: ALL THE GOOD
THAT WILL DO.

294
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,036
RENE'S RIGHT.

295
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,371
AND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
SHE HATES SAYING THAT.

296
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,788
IF PROMETHEUS KNOWS
WHO CURTIS IS,

297
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,624
HE KNOWS
WHO WE ALL ARE.

298
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,626
MAYBE BARRY COULD DO THAT
FLASHPOINT THING AGAIN.

299
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,337
YEAH, HE DOES THAT,
DIG MIGHT END UP
WITH 5 KIDS.

300
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:35,963
THAT STUFF MAKES
MY BRAIN HURT.

301
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,257
HOW'S CURTIS?

302
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,757
OLIVER:
HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

303
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,051
FELICITY: BETTER NOW THAT
THE DYCLOSERAL'S

304
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,636
OUT OF HIS SYSTEM.

305
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,054
PROMETHEUS INJECTED
HIM WITH IT WHEN
HE ATTACKED HIM.

306
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,931
DYCLOSERAL.
NOW WHY DOES
THAT RING A BELL?

307
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,475
BECAUSE 4 YEARS AGO,
THE HOOD TOOK DOWN

308
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,352
JUSTIN CLAYBOURNE,
THE CEO

309
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,605
OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY
THAT MANUFACTURES IT.

310
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,690
BY TOOK HIM DOWN, YOU
MEAN KILLED, RIGHT?

311
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:54,982

00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,787
PUTTING ARROWS
INTO PEOPLE?

468
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,831
WELL, YEAH,
BUT ONLY BAD PEOPLE

469
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,791
AND ONLY THE ONES
WHO REALLY TRY TO
PUT UP A FIGHT.

470
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,418
MOST GUYS WE JUST
TRY TO SEND TO JAIL.

471
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,920
THIS IS
COMPLETELY INSANE.

472
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,797
YES, I KNOW THAT,
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE

473
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,050
OUT THERE DOING IT,
IT'S DIFFERENT.

474
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:23,723
IT FEELS...AMAZING,
EMPOWERING...

475
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,475
ALMOST A LITTLE
INSPIRING.

476
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,896
YOU LIED TO ME...
FOR MONTHS!

477
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,939
-TO KEEP YOU SAFE.
-TO KEEP ME SAFE.

478
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,566
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

479
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,985
YOU'VE BEEN HURT
HOW MANY TIMES SINCE
YOU STARTED THIS?

480
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,070
I ACTUALLY LOST TRACK.

481
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,404
WHICH IS WHY YOU
NEED TO STOP.

482
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,948
-STOP WHAT?
-THIS, BEING A VIGILANTE.

483
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,449
I MADE A COMMITMENT!

484
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,951
YOU MADE ONE
TO ME, TOO!

485
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,745
LAST TIME I CHECKED,
OUR VOWS DIDN'T INCLUDE

486
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,454
ME WORRYING EVERY NIGHT
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

487
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,540
YOU WERE GONNA
MAKE IT HOME ALIVE
THE NEXT MORNING.

488
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,796
PAUL...

489
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:58,132
YOU CAN BE A VIGILANTE,

490
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,509
OR YOU CAN BE
MARRIED TO ME,

491
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,512
BUT YOU CAN'T DO BOTH.

492
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,305
I CAN'T DO BOTH.

493
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,601
PAUL, WAIT.

494
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,526
THINK IN FLASHPOINT
I MAYBE DATED HER
BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL?

495
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:20,362
IT'S AN ALTERNATE TIMELINE,
NOT AN ALTERNATE REALITY.

496
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,572
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

497
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,866
IT MEANS...
AND NO OFFENSE...

498
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,492
BUT IN A MULTIVERSE
OF POSSIBILITIES

499
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,203
THERE'S NO WORLD
WHERE THEA QUEEN GOES OUT

500
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:29,872
WITH, YOU KNOW,
SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

501
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,874
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN...SOMEONE
LIKE ME?

502
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,210
IT MEANS YOU'RE
NOT MY TYPE.

503
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:35,836
FELICITY: ANY NEWS?
THEA: NOTHING.

504
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,046
IF CLAYBOURNE'S
OUT THERE,

505
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,923
HE'S NOT SHOWING
HIS FACE.

506
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,425
WELL, MAYBE HIS DEAD
FRIEND WILL GIVE US
SOME INFORMATION.

-OH! GOOD WORK.

YOU HAVE FAILED
THIS CITY.

00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,982
I...I THINK YOU GOT
THE WRONG GUY, PAL.

MY COMPANY MAKES
DRUGS THAT HELP
PEOPLE.

528
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,611
NOT THE PEOPLE
IN LAMB VALLEY.

529
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,280
IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM
THAT SOME PEOPLE
CAN'T AFFORD IT.

00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:45,823
IT IS NOW.

TO YOU?

THAT IS WHAT I'M
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT,

546
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:21,752
THAT AND WHY MEN
DON'T LISTEN

WHEN YOU SPECIFICALLY TELL
THEM NOT TO DO SOMETHING.

WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
LISTEN?

00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,590
THEA: OK. DID YOU ASK
HIM WHY HE SENT IT?

550
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,050
YEAH, I TEXTED RIGHT BACK.
NO REPLY.

TO THE GPS TAG ON HIS TEXT.

WHY WOULD HE SEND
THIS PHOTO?

WHAT'S
THE RELEVANCE?

THAT'S WHAT I'M
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

557
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,228
RIGHT AFTER I TRY
TO FIGURE OUT

558
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,980

PRICE GOUGE WITH HIS DRUG.
