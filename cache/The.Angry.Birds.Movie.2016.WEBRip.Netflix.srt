1
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,363
Okay.

2
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,490
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

3
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,658
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

4
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,909
Come on, let's go. Let's go, buddy.

5
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,828
Come on, come on, we gotta move,
we gotta move.

6
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:26,836
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

7
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:28,421
No, no, no, no, no!

8
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,557
Hey! Hey! Gotcha!

9
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,026
I don't like it! I don't like it!

10
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,208
Beak! Wing! Tail!

11
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,293
Ribs!

12
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:08,085
Giblets!

13
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,633
I'm flying!

14
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,801
Nope, still can't fly.

15
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,681
I cannot believe this.

16
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:21,891
Breathe, breathe.

17
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,230
Bottom feeder.

18
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,023
Up and over!

19
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,323
Ta-da!

20
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,574
No, no, no, no.

21
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,617
Look. It's okay. I'm just a clown.

22
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,910
Oh, boy.

23
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:44,497
That's a loud... Loud...
You're very scared of me.

24
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,334
Here, come here. Nope. Okay. Nope.
Never mind.

25
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,418
Happy hatchday!

26
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,502
Hi, pal.

27
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:53,881
You must be so disappointed
in yourself for being this late.

28
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:54,924
No. No, no, no, no.

29
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:56,218
I'm not late. Look at the time.

30
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,052
See, the order said before noon.

31
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,432
Okay, now you're late.

32
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,434
-What?
-Where have you been?

33
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,519
-It's funny you ask. You see, I was...
-You missed the party.

34
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,313
-What is that?
-That.

35
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,814
Yes, see, I fell on the box.

36
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,108
The squirrel?

37
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,443
That's on us.

38
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,987
You know, I tried to keep my body
between the ground and the box,

39
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,822
but, you know, I think I got a little bruise.

40
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:19,491
See anything back there?

41
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,700
Hear that, honey?

42
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:25,288
The clown we paid to be here an hour ago
fell on our son's hatchday cake.

43
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,291
That's why our son's hatchday party
is ruined!

44
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:32,044
And the next time you mess up,
don't tell me a story,

45
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:35,131
just take responsibility.

46
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,674
Hey, man, it wasn't a story.

47
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:41,053
"I'm a screwup that woke up late
and fell on the thing you paid for!"

48
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:44,098
-It wasn't a story. I almost drowned.
-"I'm really bad at my job and I'm late..."

49
00:03:44,181 --> 00:03:45,558
Why don't we just settle this out

50
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,394
-and say the cake's on you.
-You.

51
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,527
I'm sorry, it's on me?

52
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,237
Well, who else would it be on?

53
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,198
Well, you know, I...

54
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:04,994
I'm not sure you're gonna like this,
but since you asked.

55
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,498
Rather than being on me, as you suggested,

56
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,417
this cake is on you!

57
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:15,505
So, you wanna hear a story?

58
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,007
I run my butt off, literally, mind you,

59
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,176
to get the "gluten-free cake."

60
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,678
What the heck is gluten?

61
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,013
I mean, does gluten even exist?

62
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:25,473
Who are you?

63
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,599
Get outta here!

64
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,518
Already? But you're the only one
that's had cake.

65
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,602
What...

66
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,397
That's good stuff.

67
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,774
Anybody want to eat some cake
off their dad or husband?

68
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,777
Who needs plates
when you got this guy's face, right?

69
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:39,862
Wait. I almost forgot.

70
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,449
You know, I'm supposed to do
a quick customer satisfaction survey

71
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,200
before I split, okay?

72
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,412
So, on a scale of one to three stars,
what would you say about my performance?

73
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,582
And don't forget, the squirrel was free...

74
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,922
-Sorry about this!
-No!

75
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,343
My bad.

76
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,189
Congratulations!

77
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,525
It's a boy!

78
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,931
Hey, Eyebrows.

79
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:56,355
Eyebrows!

80
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,774
Eyebrows!

81
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:12,264
Your Honor, our family has
always practiced natural childhatch.

82
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,935
The risks of having
a scrambled infant are too great.

83
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,145
There was going to be music,

84
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,398
the nest was going to be full of
beautiful, fresh-cut flowers.

85
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,361
And the first two faces he was going to see

86
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,531
were the loving faces
of his mother and his father.

87
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,786
We can never get that moment back.

88
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:37,915
Ma'am, I never wanted my face to be
the first face your baby saw.

89
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,584
I mean, what are we talking about here?

90
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,461
He probably doesn't even remember me.

91
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:43,379
Daddy!

92
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,422
No, no, no. No. Shut up.

93
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:46,508
Shut up.

94
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,675
Cool it.

95
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,263
Ladies and gentlemen,
am I a passionate bird?

96
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,389
Yes.

97
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,724
Guilty as can be.

98
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,893
It was a quality cake.

99
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,980
Look, I worked very hard
to get it there on time

100
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:04,191
and he wouldn't even try it!

101
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:09,196
Mr. Red, we are
a happy, happy bird community.

102
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,866
Under the protection of Mighty Eagle,

103
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,746
we work, we play, we laugh, we love,

104
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,999
and we live our lives
free from conflict and strife, sir.

105
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,418
We love the sound
of our own voice, too, evidently.

106
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,088
Perhaps you never heard the joke,
"Why don't birds fly?"

107
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,423
I'm gonna tell you why.

108
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,342
Because where else
would we ever wanna go?

109
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,430
-It gets me every time, guys!
-Not a good joke.

110
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,725
So now, what am I to make
of the likes of you?

111
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,020
There seems to be a recurring issue here.

112
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,689
Anger.

113
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,106
I don't think I have an anger issue.

114
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,817
I think you got an anger issue.

115
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:53,032
Anger is a weed growing in our garden.

116
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,661
And what do you do when you find a weed?

117
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,288
I don't know, but I bet you're gonna tell me.

118
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:01,040
You pluck it out!

119
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,959
Oh, my God.

120
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:07,046
Mr. Red, when you moved your house
outside of our village,

121
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:10,049
did you notice that nobody tried to stop you?

122
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:16,388
Birds, they may smile at you on the street,
but that doesn't mean they like you.

123
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:20,643
Hey, you know what?
I got a question for you.

124
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:24,188
Are you aware that that robe
that you're wearing isn't fooling anybody?

125
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:28,484
We all see ya prancing along the street,
Your Honor!

126
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,988
And you're, what, and I'm just
approximating here, like, an inch tall?

127
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,573
You... What are you doing?

128
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,657
Voilà!

129
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,119
What the...

130
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,704
Daddy!

131
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,832
Mr. Red, given the severity of the crimes,

132
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:49,130
I have no choice but to impose
the maximum penalty allowed by the law.

133
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,175
Anger management class.

134
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:55,928
Pluck my life.

135
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,016
Fresh worms caught today.

136
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,851
Hey, Red. How are ya?

137
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:02,935
I'm horrible.

138
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,020
Hi, Red.

139
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,146
It's good to see you!

140
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,649
-I wish I could say the same.
-Get your worms here!

141
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,108
Upsy-daisy!

142
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,318
Thank you.

143
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,449
Let's go.

144
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,703
How are you, Susie? You good?

145
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,579
No running. No running.

146
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,416
Come on.

147
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,377
Hey, how's that nap schedule coming along?

148
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:29,796
Oh, boy.

149
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,715
You guys ever thought about bird control?

150
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,301
Left, right, left, right.

151
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,803
There ya go.

152
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,058
Hey, hey.

153
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:50,942
All right.

154
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,860
Shirley.

155
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,028
Girly, you got this.

156
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,822
We don't want you to fall, now.
Take your time.

157
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,240
Here we go. That's it.

158
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,119
You're doing it!

159
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,413
Seriously?

160
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:05,707
I'm almost there.

161
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:11,462
Nope.

162
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,478
Pigeon pose.

163
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,189
Crane pose.

164
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,399
Okay, we worked out.

165
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,901
Who's down for a froyo?

166
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,486
Froyo.

167
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,321
"Mighty Mighty Eagle, soaring free.

168
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:39,115
"Defender of our homes and liberty!"

169
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,199
Hi, Red.

170
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,784
Is one of those yours?

171
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:42,827
What?

172
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,703
Yeah, when birds fly.

173
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,873
"Mighty Eagle is a legend."

174
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,502
You think that's funny?

175
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:34,670
This is funny!

176
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:42,594
Come on!

177
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,069
What?

178
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,631
Don't look, Bobby.

179
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,926
The anger might be contagious.

180
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,302
Let's go!

181
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,555
-He started it.
-Move it, move it! Don't look back!

182
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,183
There you go.

183
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,448
Look at this.

184
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:46,325
This is gonna be awful.

185
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,371
Okay, I guess that's art.

186
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,373
That's garbage.

187
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,292
And that's exotic.

188
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,089
"Free rage" what?

189
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,173
Hi!

190
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,716
-Hi there! Welcome...
-Hello.

191
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,969
...to the Infinity Acceptance group.

192
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,470
-I am Matilda.
-Okay.

193
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:10,975
And I'm just super psyched
to be taking this journey with you!

194
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,310
You're gonna have a blast.

195
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,937
I'm really fun.

196
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,772
Everybody says that about me.

197
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,232
Hey, guys.

198
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,691
Say hello to Red, everyone.

199
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,776
Hello!

200
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,694
Hi, Red.

201
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,696
Hello, birds I won't get to know well.

202
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:27,324
Hey, apparently somebody didn't get
the memo that we like to start on time

203
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,409
because you're about two minutes late.

204
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,451
Don't let it happen again.

205
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,536
Hi, my name is Chuck.

206
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,620
I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.

207
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:32,872
I like you a lot. I can tell.

208
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,290
Okay.

209
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:38,377
Now, Red, would you like to
share your story with us?

210
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,586
No, not really.

211
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,631
Well, the court mentioned
something about a rage episode

212
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:45,009
at a child's birthday party.

213
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,178
How long is this class, anyway?

214
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,638
As long as you make it.

215
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,307
Really? Okay.

216
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,977
Gentlemen, very nice to see you,
and to almost meet you.

217
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,853
Probably the nicest part of it
is not getting to meet you,

218
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,564
you know, in some weird way.

219
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,482
All right, so I'm gonna go ahead

220
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:04,236
and scoot on back out
past those creepy statues and...

221
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,113
Back you go.

222
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,240
Sure. No, I can take a seat.

223
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,326
So, in another sense,

224
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:16,207
you are here until I notify the court
that your anger issues have been resolved.

225
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,542
Oh, boy.

226
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,626
Chuck!

227
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,170
Share your story with Red.

228
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,339
Me? I am the last guy who should be here.

229
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,798
Simple speeding ticket.

230
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:28,635
Judge tells me I was going too fast,
so I say, "Your Honor, to be honest, I was.

231
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,720
"You caught me."

232
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,305
I'm not angry. I'm honest.

233
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,474
So, shouldn't I be in
honesty management class?

234
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,767
'Cause we gotta manage my honesty.

235
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:41,148
My one problem, that's a different story
than you told last time.

236
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:09,468
Drinks on me, guys!

237
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,852
Chuck?

238
00:16:18,935 --> 00:16:20,854
Okay, maybe it wasn't ice cream.

239
00:16:20,937 --> 00:16:22,898
All right, Chuck, thanks. We got it.

240
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,484
And this is Terence.

241
00:16:27,944 --> 00:16:29,446
More like terrifying.

242
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,408
Now, it says here, in your little filey...

243
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:49,675
Terence seems to have had an incident.

244
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:53,429
Now, Bomb started with us two weeks ago.

245
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,347
Tell us your story, Bomb.

246
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,099
Okay.

247
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,560
Well, sometimes when I get upset,

248
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:04,023
I have been known to blow up.

249
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,109
So, like... Like, what, like,
you get mad, you mean?

250
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,360
Well, no.

251
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,196
I literally blow up, okay?

252
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,739
I explode like a bomb.

253
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,163
Hence the name.

254
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,250
Surprise!

255
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:28,964
Excuse me.

256
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,299
Party foul.

257
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,636
Do it!

258
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,679
No can do.

259
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:37,473
I just went boom-boom before class.

260
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,682
Hey, look, I don't want to be here at all,

261
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:42,478
but this can maybe make it a little more
interesting to me, so please, explode.

262
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,854
You can't do it, can you?

263
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:47,149
Yes, I can, but I'm having back issues today.

264
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,443
So, I'm gonna have to take a rain check.

265
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:50,861
Do it!

266
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,279
Not the time or place, little amigo.

267
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,240
These guys are all nuts, huh, big man?

268
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,162
Are we speaking telepathically,
or you're just...

269
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,790
Good talk.

270
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,710
Nice chatting with you.

271
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:11,257
Today we're gonna be working on
managing our anger through movement.

272
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,594
The first pose is the dancer pose.

273
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,054
Great form, Terence.

274
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,265
Eagle! Heron!

275
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,349
Peacock! Warrior!

276
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,476
Mountain! Tree! Rabbit! Fish! Locust!
King pigeon!

277
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,103
And of course, downward duck.

278
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,357
Excuse me, boring hippie lady.

279
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,151
Looks like the explodey guy's gonna puke.

280
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,902
And have you done this before?

281
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,820
Yes, I have, but usually not for free.

282
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,364
Didn't think so.

283
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,073
-Awesome.
-And how are we doing over here, Bomb?

284
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,785
Doing wonderful. Stretching out the core.

285
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:45,291
Just remember to breathe up
through your feathers and from your talons.

286
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,168
Namaste.

287
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,128
Bomb?

288
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:54,966
Nice!

289
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:57,719
I don't know what happened.

290
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,722
I was doing the poses, I was feeling all Zen,

291
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,143
Matilda was digging it,
then I lost my grip on it.

292
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,228
Let it slip and it just squeaked out.

293
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,396
Hey, so, where we going?

294
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,064
I'm sorry. "We"?

295
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,149
Yes, we.

296
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,319
There's a new happiness exhibit
at the Museum of Happiness

297
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,446
that I'm dying to see.

298
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,655
You know what?

299
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,490
I... I mean, I got a... I got a thing.

300
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,575
A thing?

301
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:21,493
Like a disease?

302
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,245
Is it bird flu? Chicken pox?

303
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,580
Cardinal sin?

304
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:28,083
No, by "thing," I mean, like,
desire not to hang out.

305
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,168
With you.

306
00:19:31,002 --> 00:19:33,004
Yeah, well...
You know, may be for the best, you know,

307
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,799
because I got something, too.

308
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,634
How did I forget?

309
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,846
Even if you'd said yes,
I probably couldn't have gone.

310
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,139
I'm busy, too.

311
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:50,564
I have a business offer deal that is...

312
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,608
No, Bomb, you're not good at this, buddy.

313
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:56,195
It's... It's charming up to a point,
and now it's just sad.

314
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,905
It's a guy I know.

315
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:03,244
And he's opening up a brand-new luxury

316
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,871
class reunion.

317
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,289
Okay.

318
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,541
Good. Good, good, good.

319
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,377
Well, looks like it's just us.

320
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,003
Want to go get a bite?

321
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,923
But what about your "class reunion"
where everybody brings a "business offer"?

322
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:18,967
No, no, no.

323
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,677
Chuck, I was lying.

324
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,012
I'm sorry if I fooled you.

325
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,520
No means no.

326
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,564
My sweetheart.

327
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,691
Cheers.

328
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,403
Hey!

329
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,070
Get over here!

330
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,072
Hey, peckerhead!

331
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,991
What's up?

332
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,001
I felt a peck!

333
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,648
This is the legendary Mighty Eagle,

334
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:19,194
our protector and hero,
but no one has seen him for years.

335
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,863
Mighty Eagle is missing.

336
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,658
When's Mighty Eagle gonna come back?

337
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:29,079
Eyebrows, didn't your parents ever tell you
Mighty Eagle isn't real?

338
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,332
He doesn't know that.

339
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,875
-He doesn't have parents.
-Yeah.

340
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,752
Or even friends.

341
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,762
Eureka!

342
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,684
Say bye to Daddy.

343
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,852
Bye-bye!

344
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,353
-Goodbye, hatchlings.
-Bye!

345
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,230
Have a happy day!

346
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,940
Good morning!

347
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,108
Morning, Your Honor.

348
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,028
Here you go.

349
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:44,780
Bless you.

350
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:52,871
-Yes!
-Bye!

351
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,039
Daddy's making dinner!

352
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:58,710
"If my name were Bobby
Would you ask about my hobbies?

353
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:02,464
"Or if my name were Judas
Would you ask me what my mood is?

354
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:06,552
"I laugh, I cry, I love, I hate

355
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:11,056
"I do so much more than detonate"

356
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,434
Think about it.

357
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,852
That was beautiful.

358
00:23:16,227 --> 00:23:17,688
You're gonna make me cry!

359
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,524
Yeah, that was some real clever symbolism.

360
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,569
Red, why don't we hear your poem?

361
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,903
I don't have a poem.

362
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:26,447
Why not?

363
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,865
Because I didn't write one.

364
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,241
Right.

365
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,661
And is there a reason?

366
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,995
Well, you know, I was gonna do it,

367
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,166
but then I thought about it and I realized,
"This is a huge waste of my time."

368
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:39,334
So, I didn't do it.

369
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,795
Deep breath, deep breath.

370
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,254
Deep breath!

371
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,675
And we're back in the now.

372
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,761
Chuck! You've had your hand up
the whole time.

373
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,849
My poem is about a hate crime.

374
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,230
No.

375
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,774
Lot of sickos out there. Lot of sickos.

376
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:07,112
"What, oh, what did I make you of?

377
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,905
"I made you out of love

378
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,532
"But wait, too late!

379
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,493
"Now I see your fate

380
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:16,705
"Some very troubled somebody
Destroyed you out of hate

381
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,168
"What could have made him so despise

382
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,505
"Your happy smile, your laughing eyes?

383
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:28,759
"Your soul was pure, your heart was true

384
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,595
"And someone hated that

385
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,346
"But who?"

386
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,812
Terence.

387
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,567
Yeah, I deserved that.

388
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:50,739
Billy has passed
to a higher plane of existence.

389
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,658
Everyone, join wings.

390
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,869
Let us all say our goodbyes.

391
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,079
Yeah, let me get in here. I gotta say goodbye.

392
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,164
Okay.

393
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,292
Okay. You know,
I'll just mourn from back here.

394
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,376
That's fine.

395
00:25:03,459 --> 00:25:05,045
You know, if there's one thing
Billy always hated,

396
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,338
-it was goodbyes.
-Hey, what's going on out there?

397
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,592
Class dismissed.

398
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,469
Very moving.

399
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,888
Come on, everybody! Let's go!

400
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,264
Hey, where's everybody going?

401
00:25:16,347 --> 00:25:17,933
Hurry! Something's coming!

402
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,475
Last one to the beach is a rotten egg!

403
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,602
Let's go!

404
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,688
Coming through! Pardon me! Excuse me!

405
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:26,775
What?

406
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,405
Again?

407
00:25:32,488 --> 00:25:34,365
Let's get down to the beach!

408
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,784
Follow the trail!

409
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,578
Last one there is a rotten eggy!

410
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:38,662
What?

411
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,380
Didn't mean to photobomb you.
Sorry about that.

412
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:52,801
What is that thing?

413
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,471
It looks like a UFO.
An Unidentified Floating Object.

414
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,389
Daddy!

415
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,475
Stop it. No, I'm not your daddy!

416
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,227
What is that?

417
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,730
-Look at the size of that thing!
-Where's it going?

418
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,023
I don't know, but it's not stopping.

419
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,987
My house, my house.

420
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:13,989
Slow down!

421
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,073
Stop!

422
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,215
What the...

423
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:39,180
That house took me five years to build.

424
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:43,727
It's such a shame when you create something
and someone just destroys it.

425
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:47,147
Ladies and gentlemen,

426
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,108
we have a very special guest for you!

427
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:53,236
-He's a green marine sailing machine.
-Careful, now.

428
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:56,364
And he's keen to let you know he's not mean!

429
00:26:56,447 --> 00:27:00,952
Put your wings together for Leonard!

430
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,289
Thank you so much.

431
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,624
Please hold your applause.

432
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:10,420
Greetings from my world!

433
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,964
The world of the pigs.

434
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,424
What's a pig?

435
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,052
I am a pig.

436
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,433
Unbelievable.

437
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,851
Unbelievable.

438
00:27:26,352 --> 00:27:27,478
Where we going?

439
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:28,897
Wrong way.

440
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,732
Oopsie. Not working.

441
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,359
We practiced this 100 times.

442
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,278
-Oh, man.
-Give it to me.

443
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,030
We're gonna come in again.

444
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,573
I'm so sorry.

445
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:44,913
My name is Leonard,
but my friends call me Chuckles.

446
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,415
Very generous!

447
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:50,376
-Thank...
-We mean no harm.

448
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,464
We saw your island across the sea,
and we thought,

449
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,299
"Wonder what they're up to."

450
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,634
But there's no other place besides here.

451
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,928
-Yes, there is.
-Stop it!

452
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,847
-And we are from there.
-Please stop!

453
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,015
We call it Piggy Island.

454
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,683
Oh, my God.

455
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:09,437
P-I-double-G-Y Island.

456
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,106
Who else is out there?

457
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,359
My first officer, Ross, and I
have sailed everywhere.

458
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:17,153
One brave soul against the sea.

459
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,238
And Ross.

460
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,280
Excuse me.

461
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,700
Have you come to smash
all of our houses or just mine?

462
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,577
Oh, man!

463
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,287
Somebody want a gift basket?

464
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,331
Please, please, don't be afraid.

465
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:32,335
My partner and I request
the honor of your friendship.

466
00:28:32,418 --> 00:28:34,379
Ross, show 'em how we do it.

467
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:36,965
Don't worry, he's had all his shots.

468
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,341
We're all friends now!

469
00:28:38,424 --> 00:28:39,425
Hi, friends.

470
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,304
Not a hugger.

471
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:48,309
Welcome to Bird Island!

472
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,062
Welcome to our new friends, the pigs.

473
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,940
Let us have a celebration!

474
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,026
-Put 'er there!
-Welcome!

475
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,319
-Sorry.
-And a hoof to a wing.

476
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:02,490
We would like to honor the pigs
with a special performance.

477
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:09,039
Watch out. Shakin' my bacon!

478
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,331
They don't have feathers?

479
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,292
You know, they're just
walking around naked,

480
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,543
just presenting themselves.

481
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,336
I'm looking at all their business here.

482
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,172
That part about them I really admire.

483
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:21,009
Now we would like to welcome
our special guests, the pigs!

484
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:22,844
All right!

485
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,972
Thank you for your kindness and hospitality.

486
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:28,183
Our king sends his warmest regards.

487
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,309
"King"?

488
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:33,939
You have shared with us the wonders
of your quaint, simple little island.

489
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,648
Drop the banner, Ross!

490
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:42,030
Now we would love to humbly share
some of the wonders of our world.

491
00:29:42,488 --> 00:29:44,115
Yeah. Humble, my bird butt.

492
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,366
Language.

493
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,161
A hundred years from now, everyone will ask,

494
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:51,790
"How did the friendship between
the pigs and the birds start?"

495
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,125
-Who cares?
-Oh, no.

496
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:58,171
Well, let them say we lit up the night!

497
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,133
Holy moly!

498
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,387
Yeah!

499
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:09,557
Hey, look, they destroyed more of the stuff
we worked hard to build.

500
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,351
-But there's more!
-More?

501
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,561
Has gravity gone haywire?

502
00:30:13,644 --> 00:30:15,438
No! Even better!

503
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:18,649
Your friends, the pigs, proudly give you

504
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,694
the trampoline!

505
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,655
-Those are my assistants, Oinky...
-Hello.

506
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,491
...and Jon Ham!

507
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,575
Hold on a second.

508
00:30:27,658 --> 00:30:29,577
I thought there was only supposed to be
two of these guys.

509
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,037
Squad goals!

510
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,498
Look at those jiggly pigglies!

511
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,583
But that's not all.

512
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:38,211
Throwing things just got a whole lot easier.

513
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,130
Say hello to

514
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:43,008
the slingshot!

515
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,510
-I can't see.
-This is crazy!

516
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,013
-Tired of carrying things from place to place?
-Yeah!

517
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,016
-Wish you could just get it there?
-Yeah!

518
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,475
-Well, now you can!
-How?

519
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:53,768
Waiters, do me a favor.

520
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,395
-Take the rest of the night off.
-Thank you.

521
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,898
Hey, if you got the night off,
why don't you fix my house!

522
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,191
Yeah, it's the same guy.

523
00:31:00,691 --> 00:31:04,737
Well, the slingshot
does it all in three easy steps.

524
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,116
Ready, aim, fire!

525
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,159
I got it!

526
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,618
Incredible!

527
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,454
-Flown in fresh!
-Me! Me! I want fruit!

528
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,208
Guys, it's the same fruit sitting
on the plates in front of you.

529
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:20,045
-Watch out for that pineapple.
-Somebody, please...

530
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,298
And now for our last gift to you.

531
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,133
Shut up and fix my house!

532
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,801
We don't know him.

533
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:32,098
I'm going to ask for
a volunteer from the audience.

534
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,474
Pick me!

535
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,600
Who should I pick?

536
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,352
-Who, who, who?
-Pick me, Mr. Pig!

537
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:39,814
How about the red guy
with the enormous eyebrows?

538
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:40,899
Me?

539
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,609
-Yeah!
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

540
00:31:43,734 --> 00:31:45,070
Yes, you, sir.

541
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,196
Come on up here.

542
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,530
It's your lucky day!

543
00:31:47,613 --> 00:31:48,739
Are you sure you don't want to choose

544
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,783
one of the hundreds of birds
that had their wings up?

545
00:31:50,866 --> 00:31:52,160
-Get him up here!
-Come on, Red!

546
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,453
Have some fun!

547
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,746
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

548
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:57,540
He's shy.

549
00:31:57,623 --> 00:31:58,624
You hear that?

550
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,709
They're cheering for you.

551
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,044
You gotta be kidding me.

552
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,379
Red guy with the eyebrows!

553
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:06,299
I would've sat closer had I known
that I was gonna be part of the show.

554
00:32:06,757 --> 00:32:08,009
Okay, now what?

555
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,928
Come on, give him a hand.

556
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,721
Right this way. Come on.

557
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:12,973
Relax. Be brave.

558
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,100
-Ready!
-Who, me? Yeah, no, I'm ready.

559
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,726
-Aim!
-Aim at what?

560
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,478
-Everybody on this one.
-Fire!

561
00:32:21,772 --> 00:32:23,858
Who says birds don't fly?

562
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,776
This seems really unnatural!

563
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,778
I hope he's okay.

564
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,205
Hey, don't worry!

565
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,539
I'm fine!

566
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,083
Thanks for the lift!

567
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,293
I wish they would have done that
10 minutes ago.

568
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,968
You know you want to search their boat.

569
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,636
What? No, I don't.

570
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,180
Yeah, you're right, I do.

571
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:56,141
Bomb's on his way.

572
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,186
Come on. Let's go.

573
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,356
And remember, keep it quiet.

574
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,317
Yeah.

575
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,947
-This is an impressive ship!
-No. Inside voice.

576
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,241
Inside voice.

577
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,284
Come on.

578
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,451
Sorry.

579
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,997
Piggy fitness.

580
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:20,956
I don't know.

581
00:33:32,843 --> 00:33:34,304
Very strange.

582
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,019
Who are these weirdos?

583
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,402
What are you doing?
We're trying to sneak around.

584
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,612
We didn't rent this place out.

585
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,031
You can rent this place?

586
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,240
Give me that!

587
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,871
Hey, you guys!

588
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,498
No.

589
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:06,127
Looks like there's
some more stuff down here.

590
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,717
We were hiding.

591
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,348
When I say, "Hey!" you say, "Ho!"

592
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,932
-Hey!
-Ho!

593
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,434
-Hey!
-Ho!

594
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,685
-Hey!
-Ho!

595
00:34:22,768 --> 00:34:24,229
There's more of them!

596
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,313
Hey!

597
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,564
Ho!

598
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:28,441
That's right, I'm back.

599
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,319
Enjoying the party, everyone?

600
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:36,532
Because while you were living it up,
I snuck onto their boat.

601
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,493
-What?
-What did he say?

602
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,370
And look at what I found.

603
00:34:41,787 --> 00:34:43,664
There's more of them than we thought!

604
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,251
Which is mysterious and weird, am I right?

605
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,044
Hi.

606
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,381
How ya doin'?

607
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:54,217
Remember, he said there were
only two pigs on board,

608
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,552
but he was obviously lying.

609
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,556
And there are strange devices on their boat!

610
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,518
So, clearly, there's, you know,
some messed-up stuff going on here.

611
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,935
How messed up? I don't know.

612
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,854
What specifically? I don't know that, either.

613
00:35:06,937 --> 00:35:07,938
Any questions?

614
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:11,484
Sweet!

615
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,069
You snuck onto their boat?

616
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,030
You know, I don't need a reward.

617
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,074
If you guys are trying to think of what honor
to bestow upon me, don't need it.

618
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,951
-Boo!
-Yeah, boo 'em!

619
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,537
Boo!

620
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,079
-You're booing them or me?
-You!

621
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,456
It's me.

622
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,208
Perhaps I can explain.

623
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:30,878
You see, my cousins are simple folk.

624
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:32,672
Watch.

625
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,965
A, B, C...

626
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,136
Nothing. See? Nothing.

627
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,431
I didn't want to risk their lives
until I found out that the...

628
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,724
The new world was safe.

629
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,477
We were gonna put on
a cowboy show for you.

630
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,062
Let 'er go, boys!

631
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,111
...and I'll take the low...

632
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,697
Ixnay on the ongsay.

633
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,282
That was Pig Latin.

634
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,659
But perhaps it wasn't meant to be.

635
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:06,664
I believe that birds and pigs
are meant to be friends.

636
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:11,085
But if we crossed boundaries
that were not meant to be crossed...

637
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:18,634
Mr. Red, you've shamed not only yourself,
but our entire community!

638
00:36:19,134 --> 00:36:20,303
I think you... You messed up there.

639
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,222
You said "shamed"
and you meant "saved," right?

640
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,558
I sent you to treatment
to deal with your problems.

641
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:28,018
Clearly, more treatment is required.

642
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,645
-No!
-No!

643
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,523
Do not trouble our honored guests again!

644
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:37,445
My friends, we would love
to see your cowboy show.

645
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,988
-Yeah!
-Thank you.

646
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,406
Thank you so much.

647
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,949
Come on, everybody!

648
00:36:42,032 --> 00:36:43,284
Put your hands together!

649
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:44,327
Yeah!

650
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,371
Whatever. Don't listen to me.

651
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,539
Party train coming through!

652
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,920
It's crazy that we're standing side by side

653
00:36:56,171 --> 00:36:58,633
Fighting just like two birds of a feather

654
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,510
I can't see. I can't see.

655
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:04,013
Who's gonna tell us now that we can't fly?

656
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:07,808
Just some roughed-up desperados

657
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:12,397
Hanging tough through thick and thin

658
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:16,609
Kicking up dust wherever we go

659
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:21,239
I can see that you and me
Are gonna be friends...

660
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,658
Piggyback rides?

661
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,825
Yee-haw! Let's move it, piggies!

662
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,201
Oh, boy.

663
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:28,037
Group picture! Group picture!

664
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,664
Everybody say, "Cheese"!

665
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,374
-Cheese omelet.
-Cheese!

666
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,458
Cheese omelet.

667
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,584
Classic.

668
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,170
Spoiler alert.

669
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,505
-Step right up!
-Jump!

670
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,840
So, I'm thinking about what kind of nest.
I don't know.

671
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,134
I was in the store, and I saw this...

672
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,393
-I am famished...
-It's chow time!

673
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:54,355
Just some roughed-up desperados

674
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:59,234
-Hanging tough through thick and thin
-Hanging tough through thick and thin

675
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:02,655
Kicking up dust wherever we go...

676
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,989
Yeah!

677
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,452
What?

678
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:12,332
To the end
You and me are gonna be friends...

679
00:38:14,124 --> 00:38:15,293
What the heck?

680
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,379
Who invited you to move in?

681
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:19,422
Hey!

682
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,881
That's my toothbrush!

683
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:21,966
Get it out!

684
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,399
All right, class, thought for the day.

685
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,526
Water is the softest thing,

686
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,779
yet it can penetrate mountains and earth.

687
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,699
Here's my thought of the day.
When are we done?

688
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:51,662
Red, what the caterpillar calls the end,
the world calls a butterfly.

689
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,874
Can I just say I never understand
a single thing you're talking about?

690
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:57,042
"Can I just say..."

691
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,384
That's very lifelike.

692
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,178
So deep.

693
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,723
And, Terence, let's see your...

694
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,183
My goodness.

695
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,479
I did not know you felt that way.

696
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,272
Class dismissed!

697
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,859
And now we've come to
the prestigious Palms district.

698
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:27,114
Where birds of all feathers flock together
with eight kinds of fruit and nut trees.

699
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:28,449
Suck those bellies in.

700
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:29,534
Insta-ham!

701
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,161
Is that what I think it is?

702
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,454
That's an egg.

703
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,330
That's how our children are born.

704
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,082
You guys don't lay eggs?

705
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,210
I wish we did.

706
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,256
Enchanté.

707
00:39:47,217 --> 00:39:50,054
You look delicious, my dear.

708
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,025
That's us.

709
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,322
Hey. Hello.

710
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,574
Excuse me. Buddy?

711
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,741
Those are fragile.

712
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,577
Maybe you shouldn't pick 'em up, all right?

713
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:13,911
Not yours.

714
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,830
My friend from the banquet.

715
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,457
Well, that's a very good painting.

716
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:18,749
Very good.

717
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,000
Yeah.

718
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:23,463
The assignment was "Paint Your Pain,"
so I painted your pain.

719
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,256
It's actually the first in a series.

720
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,883
Here you go.

721
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,469
This one is nice.

722
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,554
I call this one Catharsis.

723
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,850
And I call this one Bye-Bye.

724
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,602
Wonderful likeness.

725
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:41,230
I thought you said
you stored your nuts for winter.

726
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,440
Burn.

727
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,149
All right, what's going on here?

728
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,235
Are you explorers, or are you staying?

729
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:49,279
Because if you're explorers,
then why are there more of you coming?

730
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,865
Hi, everybody!

731
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,369
Not my house again!

732
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,412
-That's my home!
-Okay!

733
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:59,999
And you know what?
If you are staying, why don't you just say so?

734
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,083
And why'd you leave your home?

735
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:03,168
How do we know
you're not fugitives of the law?

736
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,838
You are making our guests feel unwelcome!

737
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,339
And you're not asking basic questions.

738
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,675
Maybe I wasn't clear enough.

739
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,761
Your opinion is not needed!

740
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:12,887
Why do we have to agree?

741
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,388
Why does it matter that we're not the same?

742
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,307
Anger is not always the answer!

743
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,643
Continue the tour.

744
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,145
Surf's up, you guys.

745
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:24,524
-So, get ready to hang loose.
-That went well, if you're me.

746
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:26,817
Dummy.

747
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,241
We could really use you right about now.

748
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,326
Wait, actually...

749
00:41:37,327 --> 00:41:38,412
Hey, Chuck! It's Red!

750
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,830
Zip on down here!

751
00:41:42,332 --> 00:41:43,417
Hey, Chuck's mom.

752
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,044
Can your son come out to play?

753
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:49,339
All of this does not just happen on its own.

754
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,931
Hey. Just taking a shower.

755
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,724
Bomb, buddy, TMI.

756
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:01,644
Now, I'm telling you,
something isn't kosher with these pigs.

757
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:02,770
Bull's-eye!

758
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,147
And it's up to us to figure it out.

759
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,649
Figure what out, exactly?

760
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,400
I don't know,
maybe they're just being innovative.

761
00:42:08,483 --> 00:42:09,443
Go ahead.

762
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,903
All aboard!

763
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,531
Does seem a little odd, though.

764
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,704
-Nailed it!
-Flawless.

765
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,497
Come on, does none of this
seem wrong to you guys?

766
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,418
I'll tell you this, if anyone knows
what these pigs are up to...

767
00:42:26,501 --> 00:42:28,253
-Hey!
-...it's Mighty Eagle.

768
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:31,256
Mighty Eagle!

769
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,051
Yeah!

770
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,270
Take that, tree!

771
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:46,981
Eat my foot!

772
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,610
Tasty! Yum, yum, yum!

773
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,782
Mighty Eagle!

774
00:42:58,784 --> 00:42:59,869
Peek-a-boo.

775
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,998
Hello, Bird Island!

776
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,171
You're welcome.

777
00:43:12,422 --> 00:43:14,174
Does Mighty Eagle still live?

778
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,217
Did he ever live?

779
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,969
And if he did live, where would he live?

780
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,764
By the Lake of Wisdom in the Ancient Tree.

781
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:20,931
That's a fairy tale.

782
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,224
I've run all over this island.

783
00:43:22,307 --> 00:43:23,517
Where could that possibly be?

784
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,060
Way up high.

785
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,899
It's a long way up that mountain,

786
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:33,736
and if I'm being honest, well, I mean,
you know, I could kind of use your help.

787
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,613
What's that? What are you trying to say?

788
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,490
Nothing. I was just saying
that I, you know, I could use your help.

789
00:43:38,573 --> 00:43:40,826
I'm sorry, I couldn't quite hear you
over your ego.

790
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,870
Could you enunciate
that last word a little bit?

791
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,038
I need your help!

792
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,874
Why didn't you say so?

793
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:47,958
Bomb?

794
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,752
Let's do it!

795
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:58,886
If there is a Mighty Eagle, well,
how come we don't ever hear his battle cry?

796
00:43:58,969 --> 00:43:59,970
I don't know.

797
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,180
Maybe we have.

798
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,557
What would a Mighty Eagle
battle cry sound like?

799
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,059
You know what? I think I got an idea.

800
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,560
Maybe something like...

801
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,230
No, I bet it's more like...

802
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,735
That's theoretically what
it's more like, scientifically.

803
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,986
I got one.

804
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,409
Not bad. It's a good impression.

805
00:44:22,492 --> 00:44:25,162
But in my head, I'm kind of imagining
it's something more like a...

806
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:34,171
That sounds about right.

807
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:36,423
Now I'm thinking maybe
it's a little bit more subtle.

808
00:44:36,506 --> 00:44:38,884
Like a little bit just more majestic, like...

809
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,107
"Hello, world!

810
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,026
"I am calling for you!"

811
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,528
Stop making Mighty Eagle noises!

812
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,614
It's like running a nursery.

813
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,116
Absolute child care.

814
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,035
Someone has anger issues.

815
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,710
This... This is the wrong mountain.

816
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,298
My calves are killing me.

817
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:49,579
That is simply unreal.

818
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:51,248
The Lake of Wisdom.

819
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,921
What are you guys waiting for?

820
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,590
Guys, hurry up!

821
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:04,219
This is what Mama talked about!

822
00:46:12,602 --> 00:46:14,855
Be honest, do I sound any wiser?

823
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:16,523
Way wiser.

824
00:46:16,606 --> 00:46:18,984
You were kind of dumb before.
I can say that now.

825
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:20,527
That water is no joke.

826
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:24,281
I can literally taste
the intelligence and wisdom

827
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,825
circulating through my body now.

828
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:29,119
Guys, nobody's here.
I mean, nobody's used this place in years.

829
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,621
What are you doing?

830
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,499
Get out of there.

831
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,678
Don't spit in his mouth.

832
00:46:46,761 --> 00:46:48,388
No, don't spit it back!

833
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,640
Don't swallow it.

834
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,032
Get out. Let's go. Come on.

835
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,826
Come. Take your time, will you?

836
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,620
Red, I've found the meaning of life. It's...

837
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:12,997
Shut your wormhole.

838
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,021
It's him.

839
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,255
Oh, man.

840
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,765
No. No. No.

841
00:48:16,851 --> 00:48:19,354
Horrible turn of events. Horrible.

842
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:39,666
Well, not so much the Lake of Wisdom,
it's more like the Lake of Whiz.

843
00:48:39,749 --> 00:48:43,087
Did you just come here to look at me?

844
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,048
Or did you have something to say?

845
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,425
I think he saw us.

846
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:49,593
You think so?

847
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:54,306
You have passed the first test!

848
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,975
You have found me.

849
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,101
Look out.

850
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,643
Behold.

851
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:01,146
Gaze upon

852
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,733
Mighty Eagle!

853
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,282
I see all and know all.

854
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,658
What are your names?

855
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,370
If you know all,
why don't you know who we are?

856
00:49:17,662 --> 00:49:19,414
I know very well who you are.

857
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:24,628
You are lost souls
who have come here seeking wisdom.

858
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,506
Can we have some?

859
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:31,343
Wisdom is not something that is given.

860
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:34,304
It is something that is attained.

861
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,015
Okay. Goodbye.

862
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:39,893
No, no, no, no.
Will I help you attain wisdom?

863
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:42,771
Yes. That I will do.

864
00:49:42,937 --> 00:49:45,565
Right. So, the reason we've climbed
the mountain is that we want to know...

865
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,942
-Prepare...
-Okay.

866
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:50,570
...to have your minds blown.

867
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,072
Son of a...

868
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:54,741
This guy is good.

869
00:49:54,824 --> 00:49:58,537
Welcome to the Hall of Heroism.

870
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,914
It's really amazing to meet you.

871
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:02,624
You know, I actually have your poster up...

872
00:50:02,707 --> 00:50:07,212
You might want to shield your eyes
from the sparkle of those trophies.

873
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,798
How many? I have no idea.
Countless, I'm sure.

874
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:10,924
Thirteen.

875
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,468
This is way nicer than my Hall of Wimpiness.

876
00:50:13,968 --> 00:50:16,346
Bring it home, mamacita.

877
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,972
Get outta town.

878
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,684
What the...

879
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:30,944
Those are some old-school moves there.

880
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:32,362
Yeah.

881
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:38,243
What?

882
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,121
Yes!

883
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:42,206
Yeah.

884
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:49,003
So, he's kind of a wackadoodle.
You know, that doesn't mean he's not wise.

885
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:55,344
Hey, are you tired of filling your balloons
with heavy old air?

886
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:57,471
Finally, there's a better way.

887
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:58,722
-Helium.
-Helium?

888
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,557
It's a gas.

889
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,809
Don't worry about your balloon.

890
00:51:02,892 --> 00:51:05,019
It'll just land in the ocean.

891
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:06,646
The fish love it.

892
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,565
It's good for their tummy.

893
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:16,072
Free party, free party.
It's gonna be the piggest party of the year.

894
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,411
-Party! Get a birdsitter.
-Let's go, piggies.

895
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:24,331
Well, now, that is some fine handiwork.

896
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,333
-Hey, Judge, you're under arrest.
-What?

897
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,001
For looking too good.

898
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:29,253
Hello. What about me?

899
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,255
Do... Do I get a plus one?

900
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,089
-Thank you.
-Let me see, let me see.

901
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:35,759
That was a wet one.

902
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,233
Almost there. Don't rush me!

903
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,819
Deep breath, deep breath.

904
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:58,198
And we're back in the now.

905
00:51:58,282 --> 00:51:59,658
Who's ready for trust falls?

906
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:00,950
-I gotcha.
-No, no, no.

907
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,495
Help.

908
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:09,584
Mighty, Mighty Eagle
Soaring free

909
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:14,047
Defender of our homes
And liberty

910
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,007
Bravery! Humility!

911
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:18,552
And honesty

912
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:22,138
You must have grown up
singing this song in school.

913
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,142
Yeah. Yes, we did.

914
00:52:26,851 --> 00:52:28,019
Right. Yeah.

915
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,566
Mighty, Mighty Eagle

916
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,194
Rescue me

917
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,945
Now, you do the second verse.

918
00:52:38,863 --> 00:52:39,906
Come on.

919
00:52:39,989 --> 00:52:41,575
-Me?
-Yes.

920
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,411
Do it. Do it.

921
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:47,789
Mighty, Mighty Eagle
Flap your wings

922
00:52:47,872 --> 00:52:48,915
Yeah.

923
00:52:48,998 --> 00:52:51,918
And fill up your big cave
With all your fancy things

924
00:52:52,001 --> 00:52:53,086
That's it.

925
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:54,629
Politeness
Good sportsmanship

926
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:55,755
That's not me.

927
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:56,840
And a long attention span

928
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:57,924
What?

929
00:52:58,007 --> 00:53:00,510
Mighty, Mighty Eagle

930
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:01,595
Yeah!

931
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,472
Take it away, Charles.

932
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:07,559
Great heroic Mighty Eagle

933
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:11,605
With finer plumage
Than a seagull

934
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,731
Sing it.

935
00:53:17,151 --> 00:53:18,945
Ambidexterity
Pottery

936
00:53:19,028 --> 00:53:20,447
And bankruptcy

937
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:24,534
Mighty, Mighty Eagle

938
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:25,702
Harmonize. Harmonize.

939
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:30,457
Rescue me

940
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:38,673
You know it better than me.

941
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:40,509
So, anyway, the other day,

942
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:45,305
these pigs showed up out of nowhere,
and it caused me a great deal of suspicion...

943
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:47,056
And he's walking out of the room.

944
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,518
I don't get this.

945
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:52,937
This guy sits here on his butt, all alone,
clearly doesn't leave the house.

946
00:53:53,062 --> 00:53:56,149
He talks a good game, but he
doesn't care about anyone but himself.

947
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:57,817
Sounds a lot like you.

948
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,404
Good. Thank you for your opinion, Chuck.

949
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:06,075
Well, hello.

950
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:08,620
-Hello? Mighty Eagle?
-What?

951
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,163
What are you doing?

952
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:12,791
-I'm bird-watching.
-What?

953
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,959
Take a peek.

954
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,549
-You're disgusting.
-Yeah.

955
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,634
Look, are you gonna help us or not?

956
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:25,219
-I am helping you.
-No, this is you helping.

957
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:27,681
Looking through binoculars,
spying on old ladies.

958
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:28,932
What is that?

959
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:31,351
Wait.

960
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:34,563
Oh, my...

961
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:38,317
I was right.

962
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,734
I was right. I knew it!

963
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,445
Bomb, Chuck, hurry up! Get out here!

964
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:45,281
Mighty Eagle, hey, fly us down there now.

965
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:50,704
No.

966
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,205
I'm sorry. What?

967
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:54,374
I don't do that anymore. I'm retired.

968
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:55,917
Mostly just tired.

969
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,213
Go handle it yourself.
This is everything I've prepared you for.

970
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:01,923
What? Prepared us for?

971
00:55:02,006 --> 00:55:03,342
Hold on, did I miss something?

972
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,134
Let me just go through my notes really quick.
Let's see.

973
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,596
Crazy stuff, bragging, crazy stuff, karaoke.

974
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:10,056
No, see, I don't see anything useful here.

975
00:55:10,139 --> 00:55:13,727
The whole world,
everyone we know, is in danger.

976
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,103
Yes, it is.

977
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,270
So, off you go.

978
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:17,814
Hey, you know what?

979
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,442
I used to believe in you.

980
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:25,447
When I was a kid, I believed
nothing really bad could ever happen

981
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,615
because you were here.

982
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:31,202
And now I see the fate of the world
hangs on idiots like me.

983
00:55:31,285 --> 00:55:34,498
And that, sir, is sort of terrifying.

984
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,709
It's time for you to go.

985
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:40,962
You know, it's really upsetting to me
that you're the only bird that can fly

986
00:55:41,045 --> 00:55:42,255
and you're too afraid to do it.

987
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:47,093
Hey, guys, come on, let's go.
We're done here. He's no hero.

988
00:55:47,176 --> 00:55:49,554
So, I'm having a party next Tuesday.

989
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:51,765
-Could you just do, like, a little pop in?
-Come on.

990
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:57,979
Come on, run faster!

991
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,029
Come on, come on, come on, let's go.

992
00:56:17,331 --> 00:56:20,710
I sentence you all
to four hours of hard partying.

993
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:25,089
Look out below!

994
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,343
-They're taking the eggs!
-Follow 'em.

995
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:37,936
Oh, man!

996
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:42,857
Move it!

997
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:49,197
Right on time. Eggcellent.

998
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,993
Chuck, go shut that party down now!

999
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,996
Me? But I only know
how to get parties started!

1000
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,372
-Go!
-On it.

1001
00:56:58,457 --> 00:56:59,999
-Bomb, we gotta stop 'em.
-Yeah.

1002
00:57:05,254 --> 00:57:07,131
Gotta get more speed!

1003
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,261
It's Chuck time!

1004
00:57:13,472 --> 00:57:14,764
Get to the ship!

1005
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:17,976
Move 'em out!

1006
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,394
Catch.

1007
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:27,486
Can everybody please stop partying?
There are eggs being stolen!

1008
00:57:30,404 --> 00:57:32,532
Matilda, we need your help.
The pigs are stealing our eggs!

1009
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:33,617
What?

1010
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,743
I'm airborne!

1011
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,203
We have to get back to the village!

1012
00:57:37,286 --> 00:57:39,998
Stop dancing and start running!

1013
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,375
Hors d'oeuvres. My weakness.

1014
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:45,712
Come on, let's wrap it up.

1015
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,047
-We gotta get the eggs off the ship.
-Yes!

1016
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,508
-Is everyone on board?
-Let's go. Let's go.

1017
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,759
Use the trampolines.

1018
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:54,262
Can you get up there?

1019
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:56,055
We've got intruders!

1020
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,474
What the heck are they doing?

1021
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,684
Untie the ropes, drop the eggs in the water.

1022
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:02,479
Get rid of 'em! Get him off of there!

1023
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,607
It's too strong. I can't break it.

1024
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,776
Bomb, blow up the chain.

1025
00:58:08,442 --> 00:58:09,653
Knock 'em down.

1026
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:12,739
Come on, Bomb, you can do this.

1027
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:18,161
Come on, Bomb, you got this. Blow up.

1028
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:19,328
You gotta get me mad.

1029
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:21,247
Okay, well, then what makes you mad?

1030
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:23,457
Try insulting me on a personal level.

1031
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,753
Your poetry stinks.

1032
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:29,255
You're just a bad poet. And you know it.

1033
00:58:29,338 --> 00:58:32,008
I know! I know!

1034
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,384
Hey, who wants a birdie bath?

1035
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,895
I'm sorry, Red. I couldn't do it.

1036
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:45,814
Don't give up. This isn't over.

1037
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,525
Thanks for your hospitality.

1038
00:58:51,485 --> 00:58:54,030
Set sail for Piggy Island.

1039
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:28,231
Oh, no.

1040
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:29,733
We'll find them.

1041
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:35,529
They're all gone.

1042
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,410
It's okay.

1043
00:59:48,417 --> 00:59:49,836
Mr. Red.

1044
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:57,385
What do we do now?

1045
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:00,346
Wait, hold on, you're asking me?

1046
01:00:00,429 --> 01:00:03,307
You knew. You tried to tell us.

1047
01:00:03,432 --> 01:00:04,768
But we didn't listen.

1048
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:07,896
I didn't listen.

1049
01:00:09,563 --> 01:00:11,482
Red, we need a leader.

1050
01:00:11,565 --> 01:00:13,067
-What are we gonna do?
-What do we do now?

1051
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:15,111
Wait a minute. I'm not a leader.

1052
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:17,363
Okay, pigs stole our kids. That sucks.

1053
01:00:17,446 --> 01:00:19,198
Made all you guys look like idiots.

1054
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,700
You know what we gotta do?

1055
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:23,161
We start replacing those kids.

1056
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:26,497
Ladies, get busy!

1057
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:28,582
We're gonna be laying some eggs tonight.

1058
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:30,459
No, no, stop. No, no, no, no. No.

1059
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:32,420
We're not gonna replace those kids.

1060
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:33,713
We're gonna get them back.

1061
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,464
How are we gonna do that?

1062
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,634
What do you mean how?
The pigs already showed us how.

1063
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:40,303
That is where they went.

1064
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:43,056
And so, that is where we're going.

1065
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,016
But how do we get from here to there?

1066
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:47,226
I am not aquatic in the least.

1067
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,645
Well, you know...

1068
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,980
We're gonna build our own boat.

1069
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,398
What are you talking about?

1070
01:00:52,481 --> 01:00:53,900
They stole your kids...

1071
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,026
No.

1072
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:56,527
They stole our kids.

1073
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:58,571
I mean, who does that?

1074
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:01,658
Have you ever stolen anyone's children?

1075
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,576
Have you?

1076
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,536
I mean, you look like you would.

1077
01:01:05,619 --> 01:01:07,789
And you know what? I'm a little bit angry.

1078
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:10,709
Correction. I'm really angry.

1079
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:13,002
And I don't think I'm the only one.

1080
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:16,505
Come on, we're birds.
We're descended from dinosaurs.

1081
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,632
We're not supposed to be nice. Right?

1082
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,974
Yeah. Point... Point made.

1083
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,308
Who else here is angry?

1084
01:01:27,391 --> 01:01:28,727
-I am!
-Yeah, you are.

1085
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:31,312
We're getting our kids back.

1086
01:01:31,395 --> 01:01:35,274
And I don't need any calm,
detached, happy birds.

1087
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,485
Not gonna help us. Don't need it.

1088
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:40,864
I need some angry flockin' birds.

1089
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:42,782
You hear me? Now, who's angry?

1090
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:45,076
-Yeah! Yeah!
-Let's go!

1091
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,871
Bring me everything that floats.

1092
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:49,622
Yeah, yeah, that's perfect. Yeah.

1093
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:02,260
With every single feather of my being,

1094
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:06,222
I am not gonna let any of these eggs
get taken from their parents.

1095
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:17,650
Chuck, I need you to
tie those crates together.

1096
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:18,777
You got it.

1097
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,237
Done and done.

1098
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,488
A little help here?

1099
01:02:22,571 --> 01:02:24,073
Let's go. Move it, everybody.

1100
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,825
Push with your upper body.

1101
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:29,037
I have no upper body!

1102
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,621
Darn good for a bunch of birds.

1103
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,136
All right!

1104
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:48,389
When I say, "Eat the," you say, "Eggs."

1105
01:02:48,472 --> 01:02:50,183
-Eat the...
-Eggs.

1106
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,684
-Eat the...
-Eggs.

1107
01:02:52,476 --> 01:02:53,519
What a reception!

1108
01:02:53,602 --> 01:02:55,604
All right, snouts up.

1109
01:02:57,606 --> 01:03:00,777
Man, it's a snout staircase.
Who thinks of that?

1110
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:07,158
Welcome home, King Mudbeard!

1111
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:14,123
My father and my father's father
and my weird Aunt Chloe

1112
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:16,334
have all searched for the eggs.

1113
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:19,420
But only I, King Mudbeard...

1114
01:03:19,503 --> 01:03:20,546
My pom-pom.

1115
01:03:20,629 --> 01:03:22,006
-...have found them.
-We love you, Leonard!

1116
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,716
I present to you the eggs!

1117
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:27,678
Oh, man!

1118
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,806
Say goodbye to Harvey.

1119
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:31,349
A feast!

1120
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:34,310
I proclaim a feast two nights hence.

1121
01:03:37,771 --> 01:03:39,983
Let's go make some omelets!

1122
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,911
I feel a little nervous inside,
but that's normal, right?

1123
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:53,329
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

1124
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:58,167
Anybody else got butterflies in the stomach?

1125
01:03:58,251 --> 01:03:59,335
Yeah.

1126
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:01,254
Probably because
you ate too many caterpillars.

1127
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:05,842
Drop your nuts and move your butts!

1128
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:08,511
Come on, let's go!

1129
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:15,226
Oh, no.

1130
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:19,981
I wasn't expecting this.

1131
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:24,693
Hold on a second.

1132
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:27,738
That guy's the king?

1133
01:04:27,821 --> 01:04:30,283
He's got to have the eggs
with him in the castle.

1134
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,201
-What the heck's a castle?
-And that's where we're going.

1135
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:35,621
Hey, guys, do you remember
everything you learned in my class?

1136
01:04:35,704 --> 01:04:36,747
-Yep.
-Nope.

1137
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:39,000
-What class?
-Well, forget all of it for now.

1138
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:40,793
Now it's time to let loose.

1139
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,836
Good, because I never
learned anything anyway.

1140
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:44,463
Me, neither. I actually just came to socialize.

1141
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:45,924
I came for the snacks.

1142
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:47,716
You don't happen to have any now, do you?

1143
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,178
Deep breath, deep breath, deep breath!

1144
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:52,430
How are we gonna get over those walls?

1145
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:57,518
I'll tell you how. We're gonna fly.

1146
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:00,313
Remember, the goal is the castle.

1147
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,065
Get to the castle.

1148
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,232
Who wants to go first?

1149
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,068
-Over here! Me! Me! Me!
-I do!

1150
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,444
Hey! All right, Matilda.

1151
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,696
Always a bridesmaid.

1152
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:11,657
Step right up, keep your wings, legs and feet
inside the slingshot at all times.

1153
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:13,159
-Shoot it!
-Okeydoke.

1154
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:14,327
Fire!

1155
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,248
And a one and a...

1156
01:05:19,623 --> 01:05:20,917
Take that, porkers!

1157
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,751
Incoming!

1158
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,379
Boom, baby, boom!

1159
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:26,547
Well, how about that?

1160
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:28,632
My teacher can shoot fireballs
out of her butt.

1161
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:30,009
You! What's your name? Hal?

1162
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:31,344
I've seen you
do something strange before, right?

1163
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:33,262
Well, let's see, I'm really good at...

1164
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:34,388
Doesn't matter. Launch him.

1165
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:37,891
This guy looks good.

1166
01:05:38,767 --> 01:05:39,893
He's gonna make it!

1167
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:43,647
This is incredible.
We're witnessing history right now.

1168
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,608
Nope. He's coming back.

1169
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:47,360
He's coming, duck. Get down.

1170
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:52,240
Did we win?

1171
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,200
No, not quite yet, buddy.

1172
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:57,161
We're still tied.
Hey, can we get an ice pack for Hal?

1173
01:05:57,245 --> 01:05:59,247
-Medic!
-All right, who's up next?

1174
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:01,499
What can you do?

1175
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:05,878
Need a tissue?

1176
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:17,723
Who's next? We need fliers, not standbyers!

1177
01:06:17,806 --> 01:06:19,142
Let's go!

1178
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,894
You go out there and you show them
how frightening mimes can be.

1179
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:22,979
Yeah!

1180
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:24,938
Oh, my God!

1181
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:27,733
We're having a feast
We're eating the eggs

1182
01:06:27,816 --> 01:06:31,779
Gonna have a big feast
We're gonna eat all the eggs

1183
01:06:31,945 --> 01:06:33,072
What?

1184
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:35,449
What is that?

1185
01:06:38,827 --> 01:06:40,079
Fire!

1186
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:41,330
That guy again.

1187
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:43,499
Citizens of Pig Island,

1188
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,711
if you spot any birds
destroying your neighborhood,

1189
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:49,630
please, capture them.

1190
01:06:49,713 --> 01:06:52,508
-What did he say?
-There's been a change of plans.

1191
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:55,219
We will eat the eggs for lunch.

1192
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,305
Did he say, "Eat the eggs"?

1193
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,360
Okay, I want you to curl up into a little ball.

1194
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:12,945
All right? Make yourself aerodynamic.

1195
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,113
Like this?

1196
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:16,282
-To the left. To the left!
-Let me at 'em!

1197
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:17,366
Launch!

1198
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:23,289
Don't mess with Bubbles!

1199
01:07:24,748 --> 01:07:26,167
Get him!

1200
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,876
-Piggy pile!
-Hog-tie him!

1201
01:07:28,877 --> 01:07:31,089
I told you not to mess with me!

1202
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:32,965
That blows.

1203
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,550
In a good way.

1204
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:36,302
-To the left!
-Hold on, wait.

1205
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:37,761
My left or your left?

1206
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:41,140
My left is your left.
We are facing the same direction.

1207
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:42,308
Right. Good call.

1208
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:45,311
Just look where the last bird went
and adjust from there.

1209
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:47,563
-I got this, you guys.
-All right.

1210
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:08,417
She got far, but not far enough.

1211
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,544
Get out of our town!

1212
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,045
We have to get closer.

1213
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:16,759
Judge power...

1214
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:22,515
Trial by fire!

1215
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:24,225
No, literally, he's on fire right now.

1216
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:25,643
Can somebody please help him?

1217
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:39,782
Mighty Eagle!

1218
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,583
Terence, I got an idea.

1219
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:53,921
Do you think you can pull the slingshot back
far enough to hit that giant boulder?

1220
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:56,882
Okay. Launch me
right towards the top of that thing.

1221
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:01,762
Ready?

1222
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:05,141
Red, I'm not gonna lie to you. I am

1223
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,893
really gonna miss you when you die.

1224
01:09:07,976 --> 01:09:10,979
Rest in peace, my friend. Rest in peace.

1225
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:13,357
Hey, guys, let's not get cheesy, okay?

1226
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:14,692
Ready? Fire!

1227
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,243
This is gonna hurt.

1228
01:09:25,744 --> 01:09:26,954
What was that?

1229
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:29,998
My roof!

1230
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,500
Did he make it?

1231
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,126
I hope he's okay.

1232
01:09:34,127 --> 01:09:35,504
I'm in!

1233
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:36,964
Yeah. I knew he'd make it!

1234
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:41,134
Send everyone else!

1235
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:44,722
Guards! There is a red bird in these walls.

1236
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:46,849
Bring him to me.

1237
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:48,517
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Roger that, boss.

1238
01:09:51,019 --> 01:09:52,855
Not in these walls.

1239
01:09:52,938 --> 01:09:54,022
In the castle!

1240
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:55,524
Come on, you guys.

1241
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:57,193
Here, pretty bird. Here, pretty bird.

1242
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:03,073
Transport the eggs!

1243
01:10:03,156 --> 01:10:05,576
Trot, trot, trot, trot, trot...

1244
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:13,041
Launch me exactly the same way
you did for Red...

1245
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:15,878
I wasn't ready!

1246
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:17,255
Faster!

1247
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:34,563
Chuck, is that you?

1248
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:37,149
This is the house of horrors.

1249
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,984
I gotta be honest, you look a little...

1250
01:10:39,067 --> 01:10:40,193
Fine. You look fine. Come on.

1251
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:41,570
Bomb's on his way.

1252
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,540
Call in the Piggy Air Force!

1253
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:57,670
My loyal subjects,

1254
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:00,923
the treacherous birds
have repaid our friendship

1255
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:03,676
with an unprovoked act of aggression.

1256
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:05,969
The attack will fail.

1257
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:10,849
We have glass, we have wood, we have TNT.

1258
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:14,937
We tried to kill them with kindness,
and now we're just gonna have to...

1259
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,772
-Well, you know.
-Bye-bye.

1260
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:22,152
Who's gonna go next?

1261
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:30,411
Aim for that ramp.

1262
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:34,540
Terence! Terence! Terence!

1263
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,430
No eggs in here.
Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.

1264
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:50,848
Hey! I'm on this.

1265
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:55,311
Redrum.

1266
01:11:56,937 --> 01:11:58,105
Never mind.

1267
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,609
Backup engines!

1268
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:08,574
Wait, hold on a second.

1269
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:10,117
Wait, I know that rear end. That's Bomb.

1270
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,036
Yeah, Chuck, that's not his rear end,
that's his face, man.

1271
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,497
-Sorry, Bomb.
-No prob.

1272
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:16,415
Easy mistake to make.

1273
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:17,666
Thanks for getting me out.

1274
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,460
We want eggs!

1275
01:12:19,543 --> 01:12:20,669
We want eggs!

1276
01:12:20,794 --> 01:12:22,505
We want eggs!

1277
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:23,881
We want eggs!

1278
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:27,968
He was sick, but then he got cured.

1279
01:12:29,052 --> 01:12:31,096
"No eggs in here."

1280
01:12:31,179 --> 01:12:32,515
These are clever pigs.

1281
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:34,975
Okay, look, I'm gonna run up
and tackle the pig on the left.

1282
01:12:35,058 --> 01:12:36,268
Bomb, you could handle two.

1283
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:37,895
Chuck, I don't know if you can help.

1284
01:12:37,978 --> 01:12:41,982
We gotta figure out a way
to get into that room.

1285
01:13:01,209 --> 01:13:02,711
Anyone have any bright ideas?

1286
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:09,677
You are gonna pay for that.

1287
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:13,055
What the heck just happened?

1288
01:13:13,138 --> 01:13:15,391
I'm sorry. You were saying?

1289
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:17,560
And here we are?

1290
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:19,478
We found 'em!

1291
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:20,854
Come on!

1292
01:13:24,357 --> 01:13:25,943
-Red!
-Guys, come on!

1293
01:13:26,026 --> 01:13:27,152
Quick, follow him.

1294
01:13:27,235 --> 01:13:30,238
-We want eggs!
-Things are looking sunny side up!

1295
01:13:31,364 --> 01:13:33,492
Guys, I'm here. Everything's gonna be okay.

1296
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:34,660
We're gonna get you out of here.

1297
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,036
-Hurry up, Bomb! Come on!
-I'm coming!

1298
01:13:36,119 --> 01:13:37,496
Don't lose me!

1299
01:13:38,288 --> 01:13:40,040
Doesn't this nightmare ever end?

1300
01:13:40,123 --> 01:13:41,374
Oh, boy!

1301
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,001
We want eggs!

1302
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:44,252
We want eggs!

1303
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:47,339
What is he doing up there?
This is a civilized buffet.

1304
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:57,600
Don't hatch now. Do not hatch now.

1305
01:13:57,725 --> 01:13:59,893
Get that red scab off my eggs.

1306
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:01,854
-Hey!
-Oh, man.

1307
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:03,564
-Bomb, are you okay?
-I've been better.

1308
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,483
We want eggs!

1309
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:07,150
I'm gonna get a running start.

1310
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:10,738
Chuck time!

1311
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:14,074
Fine. Boil him, too.

1312
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:15,951
Let's pig out!

1313
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:18,537
Looks like it's just you and me, pork belly.

1314
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:20,122
I'll be taking that.

1315
01:14:25,252 --> 01:14:26,795
Hey!

1316
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:27,963
No!

1317
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:32,092
Red, we're coming!

1318
01:14:32,175 --> 01:14:33,260
Deep breath.

1319
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:39,725
I'm in!

1320
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,644
Classy joint.

1321
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,186
Hello!

1322
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:44,897
Where is everyone?

1323
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,565
Mighty Eagle! Where's he going?

1324
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:48,400
I can't believe I'm about to do this.

1325
01:14:51,194 --> 01:14:52,613
My battle cry?

1326
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:57,075
Coming in, coming in.

1327
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:00,245
Mighty Eagle!

1328
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:17,095
Mighty Eagle.

1329
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:20,015
Mighty Eagle, wake up.
Come on. That's bad breath.

1330
01:15:20,098 --> 01:15:23,268
I can sleep late, Mom. It's not a school day.

1331
01:15:23,351 --> 01:15:24,603
Throw them in the pot, too.

1332
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:26,313
I'll have the big turkey.

1333
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:30,818
Red!

1334
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:33,486
-Hey!
-What did I miss?

1335
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:35,155
You gotta fly those eggs to safety.

1336
01:15:35,238 --> 01:15:37,240
I got this. Here we go.

1337
01:15:43,371 --> 01:15:44,582
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1338
01:15:48,501 --> 01:15:49,628
My eggs!

1339
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:51,797
-Don't forget Chuck and Bomb!
-Who?

1340
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:52,923
-Hey!
-Those guys!

1341
01:15:53,006 --> 01:15:54,174
Right, right.

1342
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,218
Gotcha!

1343
01:16:03,141 --> 01:16:04,893
You're not getting away that easy.

1344
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:09,690
No!

1345
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:16,739
-Save yourselves!
-Hold on, Red!

1346
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:17,948
I'm gonna save that egg.

1347
01:16:18,031 --> 01:16:21,159
-Red, don't be a hero. Red, no!
-No!

1348
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:28,250
Get out of town, everybody.

1349
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:30,085
Get down!

1350
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:33,171
There's just so many of them!
We're outnumbered!

1351
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:34,632
What? How many?

1352
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:36,675
No, not that many.
Just the right amount, really.

1353
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:39,261
No need to look back.
Just keep flying. Faster!

1354
01:16:40,428 --> 01:16:41,764
I'll take that.

1355
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,098
-No, you won't.
-Get him!

1356
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:44,474
Gimme that!

1357
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:49,897
You just don't know when to stop, do you?

1358
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,398
Here's a two-word answer.

1359
01:16:52,315 --> 01:16:55,443
Looks like your little
slingshot game ends here.

1360
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:57,029
-Gimme that!
-Not gonna happen!

1361
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,283
Oh, no.

1362
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,369
Get out of my way!

1363
01:17:06,496 --> 01:17:08,290
Every pig for themselves!

1364
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:09,457
I quit!

1365
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:15,005
I know what I gotta do.

1366
01:17:15,088 --> 01:17:16,548
I gotta blow up that ramp.

1367
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:19,384
And that would be a good plan
if you were good at blowing up.

1368
01:17:19,467 --> 01:17:21,011
I need to stop those planes.

1369
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:22,930
Remember me, Chuck. Remember me!

1370
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:24,640
Bomb's away!

1371
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:33,565
-Hi there.
-Here, chickie, chickie, chickie.

1372
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,150
This little piggy popped.

1373
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:37,861
This little piggy exploded.

1374
01:17:37,945 --> 01:17:42,115
And this little piggy went,
"Wee, wee, wee, I want my mama!"

1375
01:17:45,493 --> 01:17:47,579
Come on, Bomb, you can do this.

1376
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,331
Blow up! Blow up!

1377
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:56,004
No.

1378
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:58,631
Think explosive thoughts.

1379
01:17:58,716 --> 01:17:59,883
Surprise parties!

1380
01:18:01,259 --> 01:18:02,678
Yoga poses!

1381
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:05,973
Pigs in airplanes!

1382
01:18:11,644 --> 01:18:12,896
I blew up.

1383
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,272
On purpose.

1384
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:17,234
You're wrecking my house.
What's wrong with you?

1385
01:18:17,317 --> 01:18:18,610
You wrecked my house.

1386
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:19,737
Your house was ugly.

1387
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:20,863
Well, now we're even.

1388
01:18:28,161 --> 01:18:29,204
Strike!

1389
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:33,208
Run! Run!

1390
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:37,838
Guys, look out!

1391
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:41,591
Everyone, stand back.

1392
01:18:47,555 --> 01:18:48,891
Terence?

1393
01:18:49,099 --> 01:18:51,434
Put on your seat belts, everyone. Trust me.

1394
01:18:57,565 --> 01:19:00,068
Well, this is dynamite.

1395
01:19:08,451 --> 01:19:11,079
-There you are.
-Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin!

1396
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,961
Delicious bird eggy-weggy.

1397
01:19:18,045 --> 01:19:19,379
You can't eat eggs!

1398
01:19:19,462 --> 01:19:21,006
What are you gonna do? I'm a foodie.

1399
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,470
It's over. You're finished, Eyebrows.

1400
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:32,184
-Eyebrows!
-Someone has anger issues.

1401
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:34,853
Anger is not always the answer!

1402
01:19:37,564 --> 01:19:39,191
Well, you know what?

1403
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:40,567
I guess you win.

1404
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:41,777
What?

1405
01:19:42,986 --> 01:19:44,947
That was an awesome plan.

1406
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:47,032
Mindblower.

1407
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:49,076
Really? Well, thank you.

1408
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:52,454
You know, a lot of hard work
goes into my sinister plans.

1409
01:19:52,537 --> 01:19:53,705
It does.

1410
01:19:55,623 --> 01:19:57,709
Nah, I mean, your plan was great.

1411
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,252
But you didn't plan for this!

1412
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:20,190
You have annoyed me for the last time.

1413
01:20:20,273 --> 01:20:21,316
Yup.

1414
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:23,902
No!

1415
01:20:25,403 --> 01:20:26,905
Faster!

1416
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:40,752
Cramp. Cramp.

1417
01:20:41,544 --> 01:20:42,587
It's him!

1418
01:20:42,670 --> 01:20:43,796
Look at that!

1419
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:45,173
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

1420
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:47,300
-Jeez, is that Mighty Eagle?
-It's him!

1421
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:49,427
This guy looks nothing like his statue.

1422
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:51,304
-Honey.
-Our eggs!

1423
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,570
-Are you okay?
-Chuck, my man.

1424
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:09,531
-Did you see what I did back there?
-Yeah.

1425
01:21:12,825 --> 01:21:14,619
This egg is the spitting image of you.

1426
01:21:14,702 --> 01:21:16,872
There. Safe and sound.

1427
01:21:26,006 --> 01:21:27,632
-Where is he?
-Red?

1428
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:30,677
Where is he?

1429
01:21:40,853 --> 01:21:42,772
I think he might be dead.

1430
01:21:57,412 --> 01:21:58,705
Daddy!

1431
01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:01,208
He's alive!

1432
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:02,834
He's alive!

1433
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:12,469
What?

1434
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:22,854
Yeah!

1435
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:25,565
Red, you're alive! I thought you had died!

1436
01:22:25,648 --> 01:22:27,150
Or defected to the pigs' side.

1437
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:29,194
Hey, buddy, way to not be dead.

1438
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:30,903
Hey. It's good to see you guys.

1439
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:32,030
Come on.

1440
01:22:48,588 --> 01:22:50,132
Sir. Ma'am.

1441
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:53,635
I think these belong to you.

1442
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,186
Thank you.

1443
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:07,732
Crimson, Woody, Ash.

1444
01:23:07,815 --> 01:23:09,192
-Who?
-Is he talking to us?

1445
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:11,528
You learned your lessons well.

1446
01:23:11,611 --> 01:23:13,280
Come on, bring it in.

1447
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,448
No. I'm not really the affectionate type.

1448
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:20,412
Okay. Does it feel like
this is crossing the line to anyone else?

1449
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:22,247
-Yup.
-Nope.

1450
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:24,832
You're my prize pupils.

1451
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:27,419
-Your prized what?
-Don't you see?

1452
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:32,465
I had to make you lose faith in me
so you could learn to have faith in yourself.

1453
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:34,217
That's really not how it felt.

1454
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:35,302
Tell them, Rosy.

1455
01:23:35,385 --> 01:23:37,137
Yeah, I don't think
that's what happened, man.

1456
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:39,472
Look, he's blushing.

1457
01:23:40,848 --> 01:23:42,850
I'm not blushing. I'm just red.

1458
01:23:46,938 --> 01:23:49,274
Okay, who wants an autograph?

1459
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:00,410
Hoist it up.

1460
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:02,245
Nice.

1461
01:24:11,879 --> 01:24:14,049
Grand reopening. Get your worms.

1462
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:16,926
Well done, indeed.

1463
01:24:21,806 --> 01:24:23,850
Is that you right there, Red?

1464
01:24:23,933 --> 01:24:25,852
Really? Where? No. They didn't have to do...

1465
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:27,562
Yeah.

1466
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:31,066
That's funny, I don't remember
crying on my knees like that.

1467
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:33,193
But, you know, it's nice.

1468
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:36,488
Look at that.
They gave Mighty Eagle all the credit.

1469
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:39,366
They made him look
so much more handsome than you.

1470
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:43,953
You know, back when I was angry,
that would have really ticked me off.

1471
01:24:44,036 --> 01:24:45,830
Forget about that.

1472
01:24:45,913 --> 01:24:47,540
You know what we should do?
Let's go to the village.

1473
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:48,708
Let's do it.

1474
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:50,168
No, actually, I'd love to
go hang out with you guys,

1475
01:24:50,252 --> 01:24:52,920
but, you know, I got this thing,
and I have another thing after that thing,

1476
01:24:53,004 --> 01:24:54,089
and there's all these things in a row, so...

1477
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:55,215
Would you look at that!

1478
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:59,177
What the...

1479
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:24,119
Mr. Red, welcome back to the village.

1480
01:25:54,106 --> 01:25:57,944
Mighty, Mighty Red
You rescued me

1481
01:25:58,236 --> 01:26:03,325
Defender of our homes
And liberty

1482
01:26:03,616 --> 01:26:05,952
-Bravery
-Humility

1483
01:26:06,035 --> 01:26:08,288
Anger-y

1484
01:26:09,789 --> 01:26:13,000
Mighty, Mighty Red
You

1485
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:19,131
Rescued me

1486
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:38,735
Oh, my God.

1487
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:50,955
How did you guys
find the time to pull this off?

1488
01:26:51,038 --> 01:26:53,375
This is why we went to
go get pedicures, isn't it?

1489
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:55,877
Nope. We got pedicures
because we're worth it.

1490
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,087
-I got gels.
-You guys are something else.

1491
01:26:58,170 --> 01:27:00,172
To be honest with you,
I am gonna miss the beach view.

1492
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:01,633
But so what? It's still there.

1493
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:04,219
It's just not right there when I wake up
and look out my window.

1494
01:27:04,302 --> 01:27:07,096
Well, you can still look out your window
and see me and Bomb.

1495
01:27:07,179 --> 01:27:08,390
Right.

1496
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:10,308
So, you know, pluses and minuses.

1497
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:11,684
Okay. See you later.

1498
01:27:15,688 --> 01:27:17,189
Well, this just got awkward.

1499
01:27:17,274 --> 01:27:18,775
That's really insensitive.

1500
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:21,193
Want to go get a bite?

1501
01:27:21,278 --> 01:27:23,571
Forget it. Let's just go home.

1502
01:27:27,074 --> 01:27:29,661
Guys! I'm just messing with you.

1503
01:27:29,744 --> 01:27:30,828
Get in here.

1504
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:34,416
-I knew it!
-Let's be roomies.

1505
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:36,709
Roommates! I can't wait to make
a chores list.

1506
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:37,835
Wait, hold on a second.

1507
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:39,211
I'll move my nest in the master bedroom.

1508
01:27:39,296 --> 01:27:40,588
Bomb, you can stay in the guest house.

1509
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:42,340
-No, no, no.
-Can we get a bunk nest?

1510
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:43,925
This is gonna be perfect!

1511
01:27:44,008 --> 01:27:45,510
Guys! No!

1512
01:27:57,397 --> 01:27:58,440
Yeah.

1513
01:28:00,232 --> 01:28:01,276
Groovin' out.

1514
01:28:02,444 --> 01:28:03,986
Watch this. Coming right at you.

1515
01:29:06,549 --> 01:29:08,217
Come on, Leonard.

1516
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:09,802
Leonard can't dance.

1517
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:12,347
He's hatching a new plan.

1518
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:13,806
Yeah!

1519
01:29:19,812 --> 01:29:21,313
Okay, maybe I'll dance for just a sec.

1520
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:29,321
Show 'em what you got, Red.

1521
01:29:29,406 --> 01:29:30,740
Come on, Red Stuff.

1522
01:29:30,823 --> 01:29:31,866
-No.
-Yeah, yeah.

1523
01:29:31,949 --> 01:29:32,992
Nice try.

1524
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:39,791
Okay.

1525
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:10,237
There you go.

1526
01:30:17,119 --> 01:30:18,746
Wait. What are we doing?

1527
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:24,418
Watch out.
