1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,082
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,446
I got an ID on our Mr. Creepy.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,409
<i>- I'm not sure what that symbol means.
- It means "anarchy."</i>

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,204
<i>Lonnie Machin.
Full-time crazy-pants.</i>

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,925
Speedy, don't!

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,964
Sometimes the best way to teach someone
a lesson isn't to punish them.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,691
<i>It's to punish the ones
he cares about the most.</i>

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,126
Felicity Smoak...

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,604
Would you make me the happiest man
on the face of the Earth?

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,086
Yes.

11
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,006
Now I know that it's not my fault.

12
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,004
It's my responsibility.

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,004
Responsibility to do what?

14
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,080
To end it.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,490
I'm gonna kill him.

16
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,002
Where is Damien Darhk?

17
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,043
Where's Darhk? Where is Darhk?

18
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,371
Any luck?

19
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,245
Just more Ghosts
who would rather die than talk.

20
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,645
Nobody, nobody is gonna give up Darhk.

21
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,164
John, we gotta talk to Andy again.

22
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,368
I don't think Andy
is in a very cooperative place.

23
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,567
Darhk has gone to ground.

24
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,690
Right now, unless things change,
Andy is our best chance of catching him.

25
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,922
Felicity's going in for another surgery.

26
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,004
If we hurry, we might be able to see her
before she goes into prep.

27
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,407
No, no. Darhk's in the wind.

28
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,244
The longer he's there,
the harder he's gonna be to catch.

29
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,609
I'm going to stay here,
find something useful from the tip line.

30
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,602
It's what Felicity would want me to do.

31
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,082
Can't lie your way out of this one, pal.

32
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,163
Reiter might've bought your BS before,

33
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,528
but now, between these maps

34
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,281
and 0l' Miss Ukraine over here
still being alive,

35
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,611
it's game over.

36
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,403
He needs to rest for a moment.

37
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,284
Don't care. Keep moving.

38
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,566
And when he passes out,
do you plan on carrying him?

39
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,609
Fine. Quick.

40
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,730
Hey. You need to make a run for it.
I'll distract Conklin.

41
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,809
By doing what? Bleeding on him?

42
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,804
Well, isn't this touching.

43
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,290
All right, come on, let's go.

44
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,484
Don't get too attached to him, sweetheart.

45
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,961
His prospects for a long life
don't look too good.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,286
Hey-

47
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,446
Hey-

48
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,161
How you feeling?

49
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,765
I have never been more ready

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,321
to have a bunch of guys
poking around inside me.

51
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,646
Doctors.

52
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,967
Doing doctor things.

53
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,401
They, um...

54
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,007
They think the last surgery
will fix the nerve damage, so...

55
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,446
Mmm-hmm.

56
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,685
These are from Oliver.

57
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,687
Well, that's really nice
of him to stop by.

58
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,687
Yeah, it's okay.

59
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,368
I know he's doing everything he can
to track down the, uh, flowers.

60
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,489
Which is much more important.

61
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,523
Plus I got all the support
I need right here.

62
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,011
<i>- Felicity?</i>
- Mmm?

63
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,691
I'm here to prep you for surgery.

64
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,681
I'm gonna be fine.

65
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,600
Yeah.

66
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,645
Aren't you tired of this?

67
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,006
Same dead-end conversation.

68
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,168
I'm not talking. I'm not helping.

69
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,727
So how about you stop wasting
both our time?

70
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,723
The Green Arrow told me to have
a conversation with you about Darhk.

71
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,725
I'm surprised, John.

72
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,564
I didn't think you had it in you.

73
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,689
- I didn't.
- What changed?

74
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,962
Her name is Felicity.

75
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,404
Yeah, listen. I know, I know, all right?

76
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,085
Just do...

77
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,367
Listen, I gotta call you back,
call you back.

78
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,687
How's she doing?

79
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,046
She's in surgery again.

80
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,571
Then what are you doing here?

81
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,569
Looking for Damien Darhk.

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,367
There's a card
that we haven't turned over yet.

83
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,086
And we haven't turned it over
because when we do,

84
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,685
he will know that you are working with us.

85
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,609
You want to know where
I've been meeting with Darhk.

86
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,086
Yeah.

87
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,250
You won't be able to go home.

88
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,084
Luckily, we have space in the bunker.
There are living quarters.

89
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,841
- What about Laurel?
- She can take care of herself.

90
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,366
Yeah, I've seen that.

91
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,286
All right. Office building,
8326th Street, 30th floor.

92
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,760
But with Felicity in the hospital,

93
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,247
me and Laurel watching our backs,
your team gets mighty small.

94
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,966
None of it matters
once Darhk is off the board.

95
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,284
So you're back to dropping bodies?

96
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,811
Just this one.

97
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,605
Lonnie Machin.

98
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,121
The symbol that I found at Darhk's lair
is consistent with the symbol

99
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,164
that Machin left near the bodies
of two paramedics a few months ago.

100
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,971
Okay. But why is Machin
still targeting Ghosts?

101
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,685
When he kidnapped Danforth's daughter,

102
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,251
Darhk was the one
who gave up his location.

103
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,131
This is payback.
Darhk cleared out before Machin got there.

104
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,604
Darhk is one step ahead of Machin,
but Machin is one step ahead of us.

105
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,122
Yeah. And I'll keep chipping away
at my stone wall.

106
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,525
Wait. How did you suddenly
find Darhk's base of operations?

107
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,888
Finally had an interrogation
that went somewhere.

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,525
I'm gonna bring up
everything I can on Machin.

109
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,690
I'll ask my dad if SCPD found
any leads at the crime scene.

110
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,887
Mr. Conklin,
I trust there is a reason for this?

111
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,686
It's like I've been telling you.

112
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,167
Queen's a liar.
He told me he'd killed this one.

113
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,528
It turns out he's just been
keeping her stowed away.

114
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,202
What you and your men do
to satisfy your needs outside of camp

115
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,407
is no interest of mine.

116
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,721
Yeah, I thought you might say that.

117
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,530
That's why I made sure
to bring these with me.

118
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,690
<i>I found these two coming up
from a shipwrecked freighter.</i>

119
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,325
<i>Must've found them inside.</i>

120
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,683
If he's been on this island
the whole time like he says,

121
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,566
how'd he know where they were?

122
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,927
I got those for you.

123
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,403
For whatever it is
you're doing here.

124
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,729
And yet you waited all this time.

125
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,083
With someone you claimed to kill.

126
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,403
I've defended you, Mr. Queen.

127
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,887
At the cost of my credibility with my men.

128
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,526
No more.

129
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,769
You can kill him now if you like.

130
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,766
No. I got something else in mind.

131
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,408
<i>"TNANA". You can't do this!</i>

132
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,125
You can't do this!

133
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,360
How's Felicity?

134
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,961
She's in surgery. It's a long procedure.

135
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,925
<i>I'm gonna go to the hospital in a bit,</i>

136
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,645
but I needed to come here
and get something first.

137
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,120
What?

138
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,644
I'd hate to see the other guy.

139
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,131
The other guy's Andy.

140
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,809
We had to
get information on Darhk.

141
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,325
I thought that was Oliver's vendetta.

142
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,880
Oliver does have a vendetta.

143
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,724
I'm just trying to keep my friends safe.

144
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,321
You feel betrayed.

145
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,484
I do feel betrayed, Lyla.
He was my brother. My family.

146
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,166
I think that's your problem.

147
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,564
Ever since you heard about
what Andy did back in Afghanistan,

148
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,848
Andy stopped being Andy to you.

149
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,842
He became a traitor. The enemy.

150
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,801
Yeah. And then he doubled down
and became one of Darhk's Ghosts.

151
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,764
<i>And you've been treating him
like a Ghost ever since.</i>

152
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,007
How's that working out for you?

153
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,161
What's your point, Lyla?

154
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,691
If you're not getting through
to Andy as a Ghost,

155
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,524
maybe you should try
reaching him as your brother.

156
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,000
No. No.

157
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,647
I can't do that.

158
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,080
Sure you can.

159
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,209
I've seen the love you have
for your brother, Johnnie.

160
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,363
The strength of it. It's iron.

161
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,690
Before you give up on Andy,

162
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,124
just make sure he sees what I do.

163
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,529
A man who'd go to the ends of the Earth
for the ones he loves.

164
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,360
And if it helps,

165
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,047
consider it an order, soldier.

166
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,211
_Are YOU doing okay?

167
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,850
You mean now that Machin's back?

168
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,565
I'm sure he's not after you.

169
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,404
Why would he be?

170
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,882
I only burned his face off
in a fiery fit of Lazarus rage.

171
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,371
Thea.

172
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,245
Look, you know those crime scene photos
that Ollie showed us,

173
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,723
with paramedics
and the writing symbols in blood?

174
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,564
Whoever is out there now
is a complete monster.

175
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,848
A monster that we're going to catch.

176
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,651
I don't know anymore.

177
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,242
And lately,
I can't seem to win for losing.

178
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,721
What do you mean?

179
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,161
When we got John's brother outta HIVE,

180
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,403
I ran into Damien Darhk.

181
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,724
And he tried to use his
creepy magic mojo on me,

182
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,241
but after that, my bloodlust was better.

183
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,603
It was almost completely gone.

184
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,043
I don't know. I really just thought

185
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,089
I was starting to get on
the other side of this.

186
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,523
Hey. Sounds like you already are.

187
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,845
Except now, Machin's out there
and he has a bloodlust of his own.

188
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,930
And it's completely my fault.

189
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,963
No, Thea. You can't think that way.

190
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,690
It's a little too late for that.

191
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,246
Dad.

192
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,202
What are you...

193
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,241
I had no idea that Felicity's friend
was Quentin's daughter.

194
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,247
It's such a small world.

195
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,811
Microscopic.

196
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,760
Um, Thea, I've been trying to get, um,
Donna to eat something at the cafeteria.

197
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,564
But maybe you'd have better luck.

198
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,807
Uh...

199
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,481
Yeah. Yeah. Sure, sure. Come on.

200
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,802
- Yeah, okay.
- All right, sweetheart. All right.

201
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,088
I was gonna say something, but then,
with everything with Felicity and...

202
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,169
Dad, Dad. It's fine.

203
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,481
Really?

204
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,846
I want you to be happy.

205
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,323
Okay, so, Oliver found
Darhk's base of operations,

206
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,482
and I'm guessing that's thanks to you?

207
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,923
Well, there's no use being on the inside
if I can't provide inside intel, right?

208
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,009
Darhk's going to realize
that you're helping the Green Arrow.

209
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,525
I think that ship's
probably already sailed.

210
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,286
Don't worry. I can look after myself.
I'm more worried about you.

211
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,681
I thought we already worked past this.

212
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,162
There's no working past a father
caring about his daughter.

213
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,522
Mmm. Text from your new girlfriend?

214
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,966
Easy. Get outta here.

215
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,206
Crime lab. I had the handful of CSl's
I got working on the HIVE crime scene.

216
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,850
I doubt they'll find anything.

217
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,281
The Ghosts have their DNA scrambled.

218
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,448
Which makes this particularly strange.

219
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,646
The blood Machin used for his graffiti
didn't come from the Ghosts.

220
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,881
How do you know?

221
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,690
The CSU got a match.

222
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,851
Two of them, actually.

223
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,369
Michael and Crystal Olguin.

224
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,846
Machin's foster parents.

225
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,280
Kidnapped three days ago.

226
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,726
Machin's settling old scores.

227
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,567
He planted their blood at HIVE,
so clearly Darhk is next on his list.

228
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,166
But Machin's gotta be laying low
somewhere, right?

229
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,481
You think his former home?

230
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,045
Well, I mean, it's vacant now.

231
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,641
Yeah. Maybe they have
a security system we can hack into.

232
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,166
I got it.

233
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,010
- Or not.
- Here, <i>let</i> me try.

234
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,246
Okay, wait, who's that?

235
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,846
It's him.

236
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,846
Suit up.

237
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,567
Whoa. That's not at all creepy.

238
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,603
The front's clear.

239
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,283
Same. Except for trash, flies
and some bad graffiti.

240
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,088
Wait. I think we might have something.

241
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,643
I was expecting Mr. Darhk's friends,

242
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,202
but you guys are a pleasant surprise.

243
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,925
Especially you, dear.

244
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,883
Hey! Don't move.

245
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,803
Funny. I was gonna tell you
the same thing.

246
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,445
It's on a motion sensor.

247
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,491
Good.

248
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,003
Oh, did you think I was going to kill you?

249
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,284
Why would I do such a thing?

250
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,601
You're the one who saved me from myself.

251
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,601
Come on, then. Hit me with your best shot.

252
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,370
Oh, that's pretty.

253
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,721
You take voice lessons?

254
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,564
No, Speedy! Stay away from her!

255
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,563
Oh, I would never hurt her.

256
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,290
You, on the other hand...

257
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,890
Speedy, you okay?

258
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,891
Now what?

259
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,369
<i>We find out what he knows.</i>

260
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,242
Aren't we risking some crazy
Bond villain stupidity here?

261
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,168
I mean, this guy needs to be put away.
Far, far away.

262
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,364
Machin found Darhk's base of operations
without any help.

263
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,080
I need to know how,
I need to know where Darhk is right now,

264
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,089
and the cops can have him
when I'm done with him.

265
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,925
Machin is about
10 different kinds of deranged.

266
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,765
Why would you believe
anything he tells you?

267
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,604
'Cause I don't have any other choice.

268
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,047
Now, lam done talking about this.

269
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,411
Give me the room.

270
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,921
Thought we'd moved past this.

271
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,287
Sorry to disappoint. Wake up.

272
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,725
Where's Damien Darhk?

273
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,283
He went home.

274
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,970
I was planning, you know, a party for him
when you interrupted my...

275
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,806
Tell me where he is.

276
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,291
Or what?

277
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,451
Look at me.

278
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,124
What can you possibly do
that I haven't already enjoyed?

279
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,204
- Hey!
- Get out.

280
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,641
No. Look, there's something
you need to hear.

281
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,766
What?

282
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,970
Felicity is out of surgery.

283
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,287
Donna just texted me.

284
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,161
Didn't say what was wrong,
but I don't think it's good.

285
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,450
You need to go there.

286
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,164
Hmm. Back for more?

287
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,250
Does beating up on your little brother
give you a little thrill?

288
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,805
I'm not proud of what I did, Andy.

289
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,570
In fact, I'm ashamed of it.

290
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,281
You, John? Mr. High and Mighty?

291
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,006
Do you remember the last time
you beat on me until your knuckles bled?

292
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,844
Yeah, I do. Ten years ago.

293
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,161
When I found out you were dealing.

294
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,931
Yeah. You convinced me to enlist.

295
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,688
To go the straight and narrow
like my big bro.

296
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,851
And I tried. Honestly, I tried, man.

297
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,805
Enough to fool you.

298
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,971
That's just not who I was.

299
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,046
'Cause it's always been about you, John.

300
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,682
Because I'm such an embarrassment,
my bad deeds look bad on you.

301
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,883
No, Andy, no. That's not true.

302
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,441
I did what I did because I love you, man.

303
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,169
No, I do, Andy. Then, now.

304
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,123
Andy, you're still my little brother,
who I stayed up late playing cards with.

305
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,808
You going through this, that's on me.

306
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,327
But do you really think Damien Darhk
gives a damn about you?

307
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,040
He believes that the world needs a reset.

308
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,050
And honestly, John, after
what we witnessed in Afghanistan,

309
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,730
can you tell me otherwise?

310
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,409
Okay. All right, so you and Darhk

311
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,846
are burning the village
in order to save it.

312
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,081
I get that.

313
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,242
Malcolm Merlyn was talking the same tune.

314
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,722
But, Andy, Darhk hurt a friend of mine.

315
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,320
A close friend.

316
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,407
A woman better than you
and me put together.

317
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,045
It doesn't matter if Darhk
wants to save the world.

318
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,605
He crossed a line!

319
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,606
So I'm asking you, Andy,

320
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,410
begging you, man,

321
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,606
brother to brother,

322
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,205
where can I find Darhk?

323
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,451
He, uh,

324
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,281
likes to talk about Stonehaven.

325
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,126
About how the leaves look there in autumn.

326
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,600
Thanks, Andy.

327
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,451
Don't thank me.

328
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,290
You're ashamed?

329
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,931
Now we're even.

330
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,042
Speedy.

331
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,488
That is what the blonde
with the black leather

332
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,610
and the big mouth called you, right?

333
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,328
Hard to look at me, I know.

334
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,441
Your doing. I owe you a thank you.

335
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,769
Baptism by fire. It's transcendent.

336
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,649
You burnt away my weakness,

337
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,322
like a phoenix rising from the ashes.

338
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,326
If you thought burning your face off
was fun, keep talking.

339
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,005
Put an arrow through your eye.

340
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,491
So why hold back?

341
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,840
I know you want to kill me.

342
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,083
Because I can control myself.

343
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,850
No, you can't.

344
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,480
You think you can, you say you can,

345
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,684
but I can see it in your eyes.

346
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,321
The hunger to deliver death.

347
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,080
Ah, delicious.

348
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,327
Told you.

349
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,646
Bye, dean

350
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,641
<i>Coming to you live now
from downtown Star City, where the SCPD</i>

351
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,844
<i>has apprehended a fugitive wanted
for murder and kidnapping charges...</i>

352
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,168
- Hi, Donna.
- Where have you been?

353
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,611
I... I should have been here.

354
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,361
Thea said that Felicity is out of surgery.

355
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,010
Yeah, yeah. She's, uh, well,
she's got a new diagnosis.

356
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,131
What?

357
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,531
They can't...

358
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,531
They can't fix her.

359
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,564
What do you mean, they can't fix her?

360
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,527
The damage to her spinal cord, it's...

361
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,731
Oliver, it's permanent.

362
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,404
She's never gonna walk again.

363
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,801
No. No. No. We'll talk to another doctor.

364
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,644
No, no, no. See, you don't...

365
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,086
This...

366
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,367
This is the other doctor, okay?

367
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,404
This is the doctor that came
all the way from Central City.

368
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,922
This is... This is the doctor.

369
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,726
Where is she? I need to see her.

370
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,160
She's in recovery.

371
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,850
<i>In</i> a <i>special report, Lonnie Machin</i>

372
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,611
<i>has just been apprehended
by the Star City Police Department.</i>

373
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,924
<i>D.A. Laurel Lance was onsite
to oversee his containment.</i>

374
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,091
Stop!

375
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,447
What?

376
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,931
Stop.

377
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,124
You said he was mine
to do whatever I want with.

378
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,443
That was before I saw the signs.
On his abdomen.

379
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,807
Mmm.

380
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,247
Well, you can look at it
all you want after he's dead.

381
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,806
But I have need of him.

382
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,481
No! No! No! Everyone stay back!

383
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,122
Well, I count five guns.

384
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,926
You got one.

385
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,768
What you gonna do? You can't run.

386
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,730
I'm not running.

387
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,126
Ah, long time no see.

388
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,129
We didn't finish our conversation.

389
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,324
And, what, I'm supposed to be so grateful,

390
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,364
I'm just gonna give up what I know
about where Darhk is?

391
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,365
Not likely.

392
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,044
You make sure he's dead.

393
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,363
Have you
completely lost your mind?

394
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,851
I don't have time for a debate.

395
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,361
Good, because there's nothing to debate.
What you did is...

396
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,971
What I did?

397
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,409
I did what I had to do,
after you made it necessary.

398
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,324
Machin was only arrested by the SCPD
because you gave him up.

399
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,411
You were holding a man prisoner
as some sort of personal vendetta.

400
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,041
Do you have any idea
how many people Damien Darhk

401
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,368
and HIVE have killed
over the past six months?

402
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,246
This might be a vendetta,
but it's not personal.

403
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,920
I don't know what's worse.

404
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,641
You actually believe that
or you expect me to.

405
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,405
I put a tracker on Machin.

406
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,245
He will lead us to Darhk,
and then we will take both of them down.

407
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,084
And when your master plan doesn't work,

408
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,244
you just sent a murdering psychotic
back on the streets.

409
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,330
Like you did with Sara?

410
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,920
That's not fair.

411
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,361
What's going on?

412
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,080
Oliver broke Machin out of custody.

413
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,568
- What?
- I'm using Machin to get to Darhk.

414
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,000
Peflod.

415
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,604
If either of you has a problem with it,
you know where the door is.

416
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,923
Laurel, give us a second.

417
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,445
I don't have time for a lecture, John.

418
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,681
There's no lecture here, Oliver.

419
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,450
But you should know that
Andy gave me a lead on Darhk.

420
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,443
- And I've been working on it.
- Good. What have you found?

421
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,681
Unfortunately, it was a dead end.

422
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,604
- But you should also...
- But nothing. But nothing.

423
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,966
<i>Oliver, I know you're hurting, man.</i>

424
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,248
But you should know
that whatever your play is,

425
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,809
- I got your back.
- But?

426
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,565
But you've come so far, Oliver.

427
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,923
You've recovered a humanity
that you'd lost when I first met you.

428
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,647
I know you want payback
for what Darhk did to Felicity,

429
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,041
and you should.

430
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,811
But don't lose what made her
fall in love with you in the first place.

431
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,484
Oh. Hey.

432
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,767
What are you doing here?

433
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,928
I came by to tell you, um...

434
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,646
I can't do this.

435
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,571
My "anger management issues,"

436
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,003
they are less manageable than I thought.

437
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,167
Look, I called what's going on with you
"anger management" because

438
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,323
I don't know what else to call it.

439
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,086
All I know is that there's something
that's really bothering you.

440
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,642
And if I know what it is,
maybe I can help.

441
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,840
You can't.

442
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,964
This... This can't really be helped.

443
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,841
I don't believe that.

444
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,331
I don't believe that for a second.

445
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,842
Thea, you've lived through more tragedies
than a person has any right to,

446
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,009
but instead of crumbling, here you are,

447
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,328
every single day,
working to rebuild your home.

448
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,206
- You've got steel inside of you, Thea.
- Huh.

449
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,488
That's what drew me to you
in the first place.

450
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,042
Thank you. I'm...

451
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,851
Just not ready.

452
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,211
Well, hey, when you are, I'll be here.

453
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,691
Hmm.

454
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,566
Okay.

455
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,563
Oh, boy. What did I miss?

456
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,689
<i>Well, it's a long story.</i>

457
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,203
Short version, Machin's gotten loose,
he's after Darhk, and we're tracking him.

458
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,563
Wait. What? What happens
if he gets out and starts hurting people?

459
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,722
- That's exactly my point.
- It doesn't matter.

460
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,081
You sound like him.

461
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,644
No, I mean the tracker's gone dark.
I mean, we just lost his signal.

462
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,321
He must have found the tracker.
We lost him.

463
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,170
Okay, so what do we do now?

464
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,771
I don't know.

465
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,931
That was the whole plan.

466
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,085
Oliver, go see Felicity.

467
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,765
Not right now, John. Not when we're...

468
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,524
<i>Then when? Then when, Oliver?</i>

469
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,046
She needs you.

470
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,240
And right now,
I think you need her too.

471
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,205
We will find Machin.

472
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,762
Look, they are right, okay?

473
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,922
We are going to figure this out.

474
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,765
But right now,
you need to go and be with her.

475
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,646
Hey, stranger.

476
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,964
Sorry I didn't come by sooner. It's...

477
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,801
It's unforgivable.

478
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,168
Only if you were in Bali or something.

479
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,961
Were you in Bali?

480
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,491
No, I was, uh...

481
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,926
Beating the streets?

482
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,608
Probably a lot of people
looking for Darhk.

483
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,087
I didn't want to come see you
until Darhk was off the board.

484
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,486
Any luck?

485
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,491
We're working some leads.

486
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,649
Tell me you haven't gone off the rails.

487
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,486
Well...

488
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,126
It's just...

489
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,969
I can't help but think that

490
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,164
the reason that Darhk is winning

491
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,011
is because I haven't been willing
to go far enough.

492
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,687
And that if I was, if I had,

493
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,367
maybe you wouldn't be in here right now.

494
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:34,042
And I don't know what the point of
what I'm doing as Green Arrow is

495
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,526
if I can't protect the people
that are closest to me.

496
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,604
What was the point of doing it
if you lose yourself in the process?

497
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,046
Yeah.

498
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,168
There's something else
we need to talk about.

499
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,131
The doctors,

500
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,851
they say that I'm... Uh...

501
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,726
I know.

502
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,202
My point being is
we didn't really exchange any vows,

503
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,727
so the whole "for better, for worse"
thing doesn't really apply here.

504
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,405
What are you talking about?

505
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,642
That maybe the real reason
you haven't been here is because...

506
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,205
Felicity.

507
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,882
The nurse, she took this
off of you in the ER.

508
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,566
How dare she.

509
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,240
For better or for worse.

510
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,366
Yeah.

511
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,087
He's bluffing.

512
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,766
Reiter, I can help you find what you need,

513
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,845
on one condition.

514
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,726
What do you want?

515
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,160
I want Taiana's safety.

516
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,444
So long as she is alive, I'll cooperate.

517
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,764
He's manipulating you.

518
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,442
What do you think he's been doing
this whole time?

519
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,568
You give him what he wants,
he's gonna turn on you.

520
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,046
Do we have a deal or not?

521
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,725
Take them both to prison.

522
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,646
You can't trust him!

523
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,805
Remember, Conklin,

524
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,564
there's no part of my plan
which requires you to be alive.

525
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,330
When we go out every night,

526
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,243
<i>suiting up, risking our lives,</i>

527
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,488
fighting assassins and meta-humans,

528
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,642
<i>and all the worst kinds of people,</i>

529
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,965
she's stronger than all of us.

530
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,809
You won't get an argument from me.

531
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,491
Oliver, we might have something.

532
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,763
John's brother said Darhk could be found
at a place called "Stonehaven."

533
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,685
Dig said that lead was a dead end.

534
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,003
That was before we cross-referenced
the tracker's location

535
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,766
and came back with a residential address.

536
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,168
Machin's going after Darhk where he lives.

537
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,646
We're gonna roll out.

538
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,651
I thought you might want to tag along.

539
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,846
Thank you.

540
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,000
Let's go.

541
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,489
All righty. I just spoke with Mr. Darhk.

542
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,530
He's on his way.

543
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,647
Traffic's a bitch.

544
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,486
Could take a while.

545
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,169
I really don't see why we can't have
some fun in the meanwhile.

546
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,884
Just so you know, this isn't your fault.

547
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,041
You see, Daddy done me wrong.

548
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,368
There needs to be recompense for that.

549
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,883
He's not responsible for what
happened to my face.

550
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,241
Not directly. But incidentally.

551
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,565
<i>And isn't that what anarchy is?</i>

552
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,486
The intersection of seemingly
unconnected events?

553
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,161
Who owns the house?

554
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,771
It's owned by a dummy corporation.

555
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,367
Couldn't work through
all the layers without Felicity.

556
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,602
And we're sure
that Machin's inside?

557
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,766
Oh, yeah.

558
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,761
We're sure.

559
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,251
Hey-

560
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,606
Get on the ground!

561
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,441
First, you catch me,
then you break me out,

562
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,808
now you wanna catch me again.

563
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,090
Make up your mind!

564
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,880
Stick him.

565
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,640
Get them out of here!

566
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,807
You're gonna be okay.
Just come with us.

567
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,650
_5plit UP-_0kay-

568
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,966
There it is.

569
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,364
Shut up.

570
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:14,210
A little piece of me inside of you
just begging to come out and play.

571
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,565
Where's my family?

572
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,120
I saved them.

573
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,325
I want to be clear about something.

574
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,810
I have shown you repeatedly
that you cannot beat me.

575
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,084
You saved my family.

576
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,721
So I'll give you a few weeks
to spend with yours.

577
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,526
Enjoy your time.

578
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,005
What's left of it.

579
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,891
You missed.

580
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,766
<i>On purpose.</i>

581
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,331
I'm disappointed in you.

582
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,887
Are Darhk's wife
and daughter in police custody?

583
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,600
They told police
they weren't his wife and daughter.

584
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,250
Had fake ID and everything.

585
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,120
Speedy,

586
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,121
you okay?

587
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,566
Yeah.

588
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,963
I'm just sorry I let Machin get away.

589
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,565
I'm just glad that you're all right.

590
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,443
I'm gonna go see Felicity.

591
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,363
Chinese used this island as a prison.

592
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,410
Bet you didn't know that.

593
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,890
They said being sentenced here
was worse than any hell.

594
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,927
Guess I'll just have to see if I can give
those Chinese a run for their money.

595
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,162
Reiter's gonna get through
with you eventually.

596
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,648
Then you and me'll have
a little uninterrupted time.

597
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,846
You've lost a lot of blood.

598
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,248
You shouldn't let these wounds
sit open like that.

599
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,846
Thank you.

600
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,930
You saved my life again.

601
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,330
Nearly at the expense of your own.

602
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,846
No.

603
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,525
You didn't deserve to die.

604
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,526
You're a good man.

605
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,650
My brother would have liked you.

606
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,161
I already told you
everything I know, John.

607
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,284
I'm not here
to ask any questions, Andy.

608
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,730
Thank you for coming.

609
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,885
Yeah. I'm glad I did.

610
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,280
And glad you called.

611
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,520
<i>You know, this is
a little bit confusing. Uh...</i>

612
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,960
Yeah.

613
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,886
First we're on, then we're off,
now we're...

614
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,969
- Drinking wine.
- Drinking wine.

615
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:38,406
Look, um,
something happened earlier today,

616
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,923
and I guess I just wanted to say
that you were right.

617
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,086
I am stronger than I think I am.

618
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,242
Well, uh, here's to being stronger, huh?

619
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,887
Mmm.

620
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,087
How you feeling?

621
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,924
How long you been sitting there?

622
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,611
Not long enough.

623
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,206
Sorry I went away.

624
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,761
I think you apologized already.

625
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,922
Nowhere near done apologizing.

626
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,761
You know, I think I wanna go to Bali.

627
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,566
Yeah.

628
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,126
Wanna come with me?

629
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,886
Yeah.

630
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,045
I'd go anywhere with you.

631
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,287
Yeah.

632
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,805
Just one question.

633
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,086
Mmm-hmm?

634
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,442
What's Damien Darhk doing in Bali?

635
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,968
I only ask 'cause if he's still here,

636
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,131
we have some work to do.

637
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,929
How did you get to be so strong?

638
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,404
I take my lead from you.

639
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,165
Shh.

640
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,120
I've bought out the Fairmont
for the month.

641
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,926
You'll be safe there
until we find a new home.

642
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,569
And what about the man that attacked us?

643
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,925
Lonnie Machin?

644
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,487
He'll never hurt you again.

645
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,682
Those vigilantes saved us.

646
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,966
My dearest Ruvé, do I detect
a note of criticism in your voice?

647
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,842
Yes, but not the one you think.

648
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,363
You should have killed
the Green Arrow tonight.

649
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,968
As you said, he saved your life.

650
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,964
It would be bad form to take him out now.

651
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,683
Genesis is almost ready.
We're much too close to play games.

652
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,531
Do you remember what I promised you?

653
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,685
A new beginning.

654
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,360
And you will have it.

655
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,887
Once we've brought this world to its end.

656
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,091
Are you okay?

657
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,051
Are you?

658
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,366
No.

659
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,208
You know what you have to do, right?

660
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,608
You have to kill the son of a bitch.

661
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,881
