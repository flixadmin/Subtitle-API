1
00:00:01,004 --> 00:00:03,324
<i>Jack Nelson's coming to London.</i>

2
00:00:03,444 --> 00:00:06,044
There are some people in this
country who I'd like to meet.

3
00:00:06,164 --> 00:00:07,164
Fascists.

4
00:00:07,284 --> 00:00:10,124
Not the ones
in boots and black shirts.

5
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,684
<i>The ones in tuxedos.</i>

6
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:13,284
Mr Shelby, Lady Diana Mitford.

7
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:15,684
Oswald's most recent
and last ever mistress.

8
00:00:15,804 --> 00:00:18,724
Officially he's coming to buy
liquor import licences.

9
00:00:18,844 --> 00:00:22,124
And unofficially
he's Roosevelt's envoy.

10
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:24,124
By being among the Fascists,
by being among 'em,

11
00:00:24,164 --> 00:00:25,364
I can undermine them.

12
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,644
Still looking for trouble
big enough to kill you.

13
00:00:27,764 --> 00:00:29,380
If you don't want
to help me carry the bucket,

14
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,644
then I wouldn't blame you.

15
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,340
You have to carry this bucket
on your own.

16
00:00:32,364 --> 00:00:33,764
Do we have a deal, Mr Nelson?

17
00:00:33,884 --> 00:00:36,684
You're a brave man.

18
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:38,324
Every war hero I ever met,

19
00:00:38,444 --> 00:00:41,084
they're just someone who wanted
to get themselves killed.

20
00:00:41,204 --> 00:00:42,740
If anyone is going to kill
Tommy Shelby...

21
00:00:42,764 --> 00:00:44,044
It will be you.

22
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:47,444
The devil will be dead.
The future belongs to us.

23
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:49,164
<i>You need to see a doctor.</i>

24
00:00:49,284 --> 00:00:52,404
We've got to keep going until
this Boston business is done.

25
00:00:52,524 --> 00:00:54,804
Hello?

26
00:00:54,924 --> 00:00:57,484
Tommy, she has a temperature
of 101 and nothing is working.

27
00:00:57,604 --> 00:00:59,244
Just get here now.

28
00:01:21,524 --> 00:01:23,244
Out of the way! Out of the way!

29
00:01:23,364 --> 00:01:26,044
- No... No. Where's the doctor?
- Can you get the doctor?

30
00:01:26,164 --> 00:01:27,164
I need to speak a doctor!

31
00:01:27,284 --> 00:01:30,204
Mr Shelby! Mr Shelby...
your daughter has consumption.

32
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:33,044
Consumption
is a very infectious disease.

33
00:01:33,164 --> 00:01:34,964
There are procedures
that must be followed.

34
00:01:35,084 --> 00:01:37,084
- Please, hand over the child.
- OK.

35
00:01:37,204 --> 00:01:38,204
Lizzie?

36
00:01:39,364 --> 00:01:41,644
Right, you take her.
You be gentle.

37
00:01:41,764 --> 00:01:43,524
Look after her.

38
00:01:43,644 --> 00:01:46,444
That's my daughter.
You hear me?

39
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,884
I need to be with her.

40
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:49,804
I need to be with my daughter!

41
00:01:49,924 --> 00:01:51,444
Calm.

42
00:01:51,564 --> 00:01:54,244
OK. Come on.
They are X-raying Ruby.

43
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,724
They have to X-ray us because
we might have it as well.

44
00:01:56,844 --> 00:01:57,844
Fuck us, Lizzie.

45
00:01:57,964 --> 00:01:59,884
Fuck us! Fuck you and me!

46
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:01,684
Who brought this on?!

47
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,764
We brought on this curse!

48
00:02:05,884 --> 00:02:07,764
Stop, Tommy.

49
00:02:07,884 --> 00:02:09,244
Fucking stop!

50
00:02:10,684 --> 00:02:12,244
They wouldn't let me pass.

51
00:02:13,364 --> 00:02:14,564
They wouldn't let me pass.

52
00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:19,564
They did it on purpose -
to punish me.

53
00:02:21,804 --> 00:02:23,844
Tommy, stop it, please.

54
00:02:23,964 --> 00:02:25,804
All right.

55
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:27,564
All right.

56
00:02:30,044 --> 00:02:33,084
My husband... is very sorry.

57
00:02:33,204 --> 00:02:35,004
OK.

58
00:02:35,124 --> 00:02:38,164
My husband is very sorry

59
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:39,804
and he is calm now.

60
00:02:41,724 --> 00:02:44,484
He is recovering from addiction.

61
00:02:44,604 --> 00:02:45,844
Sometimes...

62
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:49,964
Sometimes...

63
00:02:51,284 --> 00:02:53,804
...he's a horse in a crate,
kicking the crate.

64
00:02:55,324 --> 00:02:57,164
It's just the crate I'm kicking.

65
00:02:59,244 --> 00:03:00,524
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:01,804 --> 00:03:03,764
- Lizzie.
- Yeah?

67
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:05,644
Tell me what I have to do.

68
00:03:05,764 --> 00:03:07,844
- This way, sir.
- Sorry.

69
00:03:11,244 --> 00:03:12,804
Thank you.

70
00:03:20,844 --> 00:03:23,484
Mr Shelby, you will need
to keep still for a moment.

71
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:39,684
To see what's inside.

72
00:03:41,604 --> 00:03:43,284
Wait till you see.

73
00:03:46,164 --> 00:03:47,444
God.

74
00:03:50,684 --> 00:03:52,524
God knows what's inside.

75
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:57,324
God help her.

76
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:33,484
She has a tubercular infection
in her left lung.

77
00:04:34,844 --> 00:04:36,284
They've caught it quite early.

78
00:04:37,804 --> 00:04:39,164
They'll do more tests.

79
00:04:41,844 --> 00:04:45,524
They do this thing,
pulmonary something,

80
00:04:45,644 --> 00:04:48,324
where they collapse the lung,
let it rest.

81
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:50,084
Sometimes the lung cures itself.

82
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:55,484
And if that doesn't work,
they use gold.

83
00:04:55,604 --> 00:04:57,484
What?

84
00:04:57,604 --> 00:05:00,724
- Gold?
- Gold salts.

85
00:05:00,844 --> 00:05:03,204
The doctor said he explained
their methods to you

86
00:05:03,324 --> 00:05:06,004
when you cut the ribbon
to open the institution.

87
00:05:06,124 --> 00:05:08,404
I can't remember.
I wasn't listening.

88
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:10,604
Yeah, well.

89
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:12,484
Gold salts.

90
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,604
Salt with 37% gold.

91
00:05:20,164 --> 00:05:23,564
They say it helps, but it will
make her more sick at first.

92
00:05:34,404 --> 00:05:35,684
Did they say what...?

93
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:39,524
Did they say
what the chances are?

94
00:05:39,644 --> 00:05:41,924
- No. They don't say.
- Hmm.

95
00:05:43,004 --> 00:05:45,484
But she's small.
And with TB that's not good,

96
00:05:45,604 --> 00:05:47,724
because the disease
is big and fast.

97
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:34,244
I'm so sorry... my darling.

98
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,764
I will deal with it.

99
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:42,804
I will make it go away.

100
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,564
I will strike a bargain.

101
00:06:56,644 --> 00:06:58,124
You should be wearing a mask.

102
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,204
I am.

103
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:24,084
You can try gold.

104
00:07:24,204 --> 00:07:26,164
I will try something else.

105
00:07:35,044 --> 00:07:36,684
<i>Mayfair 244.</i>

106
00:07:38,164 --> 00:07:40,204
Ada? Listen to me.

107
00:07:40,324 --> 00:07:43,004
I need you to be me in London.

108
00:07:43,124 --> 00:07:44,764
No, it's important.

109
00:07:44,884 --> 00:07:46,964
I know you want nothing
to do with my business,

110
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:49,404
but Ruby is very sick.

111
00:07:49,524 --> 00:07:51,324
I need five days of your time.

112
00:08:07,124 --> 00:08:08,684
So, she dresses well.

113
00:08:11,404 --> 00:08:13,484
Go to the door
and take her coat.

114
00:08:13,604 --> 00:08:15,524
- Yes, ma'am.
- Uh...

115
00:08:15,644 --> 00:08:17,284
And make a note of the label.

116
00:08:17,404 --> 00:08:18,924
Of course, ma'am.

117
00:08:48,644 --> 00:08:50,724
Oh, Thomas,
where the devil are you?

118
00:10:06,244 --> 00:10:07,964
Mrs Ada Thorne, ma'am.

119
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:11,124
I thought you were
all called Shelby.

120
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,604
Ah, I'm a widow.

121
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:14,764
My husband didn't have
the good grace to die.

122
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:16,284
He lingers yet.

123
00:10:16,404 --> 00:10:18,964
Your husband is a member of
the Guinness family, I believe.

124
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:21,524
They do a lot of good work
on behalf of the poor.

125
00:10:21,644 --> 00:10:22,924
The poor who are only poor

126
00:10:23,044 --> 00:10:25,684
because they've spent so much
of their income on Guinness.

127
00:10:25,804 --> 00:10:26,804
Please.

128
00:10:26,844 --> 00:10:28,364
I think the causes of poverty

129
00:10:28,484 --> 00:10:30,164
are a little more complex
than that.

130
00:10:30,284 --> 00:10:32,924
Yes. I believe
it is to do with genetics.

131
00:10:33,964 --> 00:10:35,324
Huh. Beautiful vase.

132
00:10:35,444 --> 00:10:38,044
My grandfather stole it
from a brothel in Cairo.

133
00:10:38,164 --> 00:10:39,364
Egyptian.

134
00:10:39,484 --> 00:10:41,204
The 18th Dynasty, I think.

135
00:10:41,324 --> 00:10:43,924
How do you know so much
about Egyptian vases?

136
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,004
- I collect antiques.
- Hmm.

137
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:50,844
A tribe of Gypsies settles on a
clearing in a factory town.

138
00:10:50,964 --> 00:10:53,884
Children, of course,
ensue in their hundreds,

139
00:10:54,004 --> 00:10:57,044
but one of them becomes
a gangster and a politician,

140
00:10:57,164 --> 00:10:59,044
the other
a collector of antiques.

141
00:10:59,164 --> 00:11:00,804
It is quite extraordinary.

142
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:02,164
A result of genetics, I think.

143
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:05,644
My dear, you researched me
and I researched you.

144
00:11:05,764 --> 00:11:08,844
If this was 1919, you would
have come through my front door

145
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:11,004
carrying a revolver
and a Molotov cocktail

146
00:11:11,124 --> 00:11:12,724
and would happily
have blown off my head.

147
00:11:12,764 --> 00:11:15,724
Hmm. Isn't it wonderful
how time changes everything?

148
00:11:15,844 --> 00:11:17,084
Where is the American?

149
00:11:17,204 --> 00:11:18,740
- He'll be here later.
- Where's Mosley?

150
00:11:18,764 --> 00:11:20,804
He heard Thomas wasn't coming
so he decided to sulk.

151
00:11:20,884 --> 00:11:22,004
You know how men are.

152
00:11:22,124 --> 00:11:24,164
Where is Thomas?

153
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:25,964
His daughter is sick.

154
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:27,884
Does he not employ a governess?

155
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:31,284
Hmm. It's a class thing,
a genetic thing.

156
00:11:31,404 --> 00:11:34,004
He puts his daughter's welfare
before business.

157
00:11:34,124 --> 00:11:35,924
Even the business
of changing the world?

158
00:11:36,044 --> 00:11:37,884
I thought
today was purely social.

159
00:11:38,004 --> 00:11:40,084
Now that it's just you,
I suppose it will be.

160
00:11:45,924 --> 00:11:47,924
You should know your brother
has altered my life.

161
00:11:49,364 --> 00:11:52,484
The men here just bounce up
and down in their saddles

162
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:55,324
in a rising trot,
never even galloping.

163
00:11:55,444 --> 00:11:58,004
Thomas is the man on the horse
on the vase.

164
00:11:58,124 --> 00:12:00,964
That's why I put it out for you
to look at.

165
00:12:02,164 --> 00:12:04,564
According to
recent interpretations,

166
00:12:04,684 --> 00:12:08,244
the black rider on 18th Dynasty
vases is meant to signify

167
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:10,084
approaching death,

168
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:13,964
so, yes, I suppose
it resembles Thomas.

169
00:12:15,164 --> 00:12:17,204
Tell me, why is he
so emotionally mutilated?

170
00:12:17,324 --> 00:12:21,164
Oh. Because he's a character
in a novel, of course.

171
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:23,884
One of those novels
ladies like you like to read -

172
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:25,484
all about wild men.

173
00:12:25,604 --> 00:12:27,644
Oh, I don't read novels,

174
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:30,284
I read only pornography
and politics.

175
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:33,364
In the absence of the men,

176
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:35,964
shouldn't we ladies
be engaging in small talk?

177
00:12:36,084 --> 00:12:37,764
Very well.

178
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:39,924
Small talk.

179
00:12:51,764 --> 00:12:54,684
You know I like to fuck women
as well as men?

180
00:12:56,644 --> 00:12:58,604
Mmm, Tommy was right.

181
00:12:58,724 --> 00:13:01,444
He says that
everything is a circle.

182
00:13:01,564 --> 00:13:03,084
A lady in Eaton Square,

183
00:13:03,204 --> 00:13:06,084
as coarse and honest
as an Aston whore.

184
00:13:06,204 --> 00:13:08,604
I just realised I haven't
even offered you a drink.

185
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:17,444
Ada...

186
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:20,284
Before the dreary business
of changing the world begins,

187
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:21,804
I want you to know something.

188
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:26,164
When the time comes
for the great cleansing,

189
00:13:26,284 --> 00:13:28,364
I myself will personally
argue the case

190
00:13:28,484 --> 00:13:30,404
that the Jews
must be dealt with,

191
00:13:30,524 --> 00:13:32,364
but that the Gypsies
should be spared.

192
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:33,844
Huh.

193
00:13:35,284 --> 00:13:37,844
Let's drink whisky
and wait for the American.

194
00:13:39,204 --> 00:13:40,564
Huh.

195
00:14:27,644 --> 00:14:29,124
Who the fuck are you?!

196
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,124
I am the owner
of this Colt pistol

197
00:14:36,244 --> 00:14:38,524
and the bullets within it.

198
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,404
And I'm in a hurry.

199
00:14:41,644 --> 00:14:44,764
I followed the patrin signs
for the Lee family.

200
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,604
I'm looking for Esme Shelby-Lee.

201
00:14:47,724 --> 00:14:49,644
Never heard of her.

202
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:01,604
Esme's husband
was a fucking dirty didicoy.

203
00:15:01,724 --> 00:15:04,644
- He was a Peaky Blinder.
- Yeah?

204
00:15:04,764 --> 00:15:07,484
Well, I'm the elder
and more terrible.

205
00:15:07,604 --> 00:15:09,084
And as I said, I'm in a hurry.

206
00:15:10,724 --> 00:15:12,284
Where is she?

207
00:15:32,484 --> 00:15:35,604
Put your gun away, Thomas.
There's children around.

208
00:15:42,164 --> 00:15:44,924
You only found me
cos I let you find me.

209
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:48,044
I heard you were looking,
and I'm curious.

210
00:15:50,364 --> 00:15:53,564
If any of these men is your man,

211
00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:55,844
please tell him
I want no trouble.

212
00:15:55,964 --> 00:15:57,124
I don't have a man.

213
00:15:58,244 --> 00:15:59,924
What use is a man?

214
00:16:01,364 --> 00:16:03,124
Horse pulls the wagon.

215
00:16:03,244 --> 00:16:04,444
Dog keeps me safe.

216
00:16:05,684 --> 00:16:07,244
Cat keeps me warm at night.

217
00:16:08,604 --> 00:16:11,804
And if anybody's going to give
you trouble, Tommy Shelby,

218
00:16:11,924 --> 00:16:13,124
it'll be me.

219
00:16:13,244 --> 00:16:14,964
What do you want?

220
00:16:17,084 --> 00:16:18,924
Tell 'em to leave.

221
00:16:20,204 --> 00:16:21,644
What, you think <i>I'm</i> in charge
here?

222
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:23,324
Oh, I'm sure of it, Esme.

223
00:16:52,004 --> 00:16:54,844
Didicoy's too grand to put his
arse on the grass these days?

224
00:17:01,084 --> 00:17:03,804
I have a daughter, Esme.

225
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:05,644
Her name is Ruby.

226
00:17:05,764 --> 00:17:07,604
She's fallen ill suddenly.

227
00:17:07,724 --> 00:17:09,364
She's very sick.

228
00:17:11,724 --> 00:17:13,204
And I can tell...

229
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:16,484
...by saying her name
and looking in your eyes...

230
00:17:16,604 --> 00:17:19,004
...that I have wasted petrol,
time and hope.

231
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,924
Wasted petrol on what?

232
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,524
Ah...

233
00:17:26,884 --> 00:17:29,684
Tommy Shelby OBE MP...

234
00:17:29,804 --> 00:17:31,444
...running around
the mountains

235
00:17:31,564 --> 00:17:34,204
in pursuit of a Gypsy curse,
is that it?

236
00:17:35,364 --> 00:17:37,644
I thought you had
Polly deal with the spirits.

237
00:17:37,764 --> 00:17:38,884
Polly is dead.

238
00:17:42,404 --> 00:17:43,804
Bullet or blade?

239
00:17:43,924 --> 00:17:46,444
Still speaks to me in my dreams.

240
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,324
It was her who told me
come find you.

241
00:17:52,724 --> 00:17:53,924
Polly...

242
00:17:57,524 --> 00:18:00,004
That name like the ringing
of the school bell.

243
00:18:00,124 --> 00:18:01,604
"Come and do as you're told."

244
00:18:02,844 --> 00:18:04,204
Fuck!

245
00:18:05,204 --> 00:18:07,404
I am so glad I'm not
in your camp any more.

246
00:18:08,604 --> 00:18:10,284
Made of bricks and bars.

247
00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:13,964
My daughter is dying, Esme.

248
00:18:14,084 --> 00:18:16,364
Some people go to France,
to Lourdes.

249
00:18:16,484 --> 00:18:18,084
I hear they sell trinkets.

250
00:18:18,204 --> 00:18:19,844
I need more than
fucking trinkets.

251
00:18:22,724 --> 00:18:25,964
I can tell from your reaction
this is not your doing.

252
00:18:26,084 --> 00:18:28,084
Sorry for troubling you.

253
00:18:46,764 --> 00:18:50,164
The butler says our American
friend is parking the car.

254
00:18:50,284 --> 00:18:52,764
He also says, in answer
to your inquiry, Diana,

255
00:18:52,884 --> 00:18:56,524
that the coat our exotic friend
is wearing is made by Chanel.

256
00:18:58,924 --> 00:19:00,964
That's a very expensive label.

257
00:19:01,084 --> 00:19:02,204
Yes, it is.

258
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:04,724
But the perfume I can smell
on you is very cheap.

259
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,844
I am deeply, deeply annoyed
that Thomas isn't here.

260
00:19:14,964 --> 00:19:17,644
It is a family
emergency, apparently.

261
00:19:17,764 --> 00:19:19,684
We only have Ada. The sister.

262
00:19:21,764 --> 00:19:25,324
Well, would the sister
like some more champagne?

263
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:26,884
Oh, the sister is allowed
to speak?

264
00:19:27,004 --> 00:19:30,324
She thinks this lunch
is purely social.

265
00:19:30,444 --> 00:19:33,404
The sister is here because
there's sickness in the family.

266
00:19:33,524 --> 00:19:35,684
Thomas wanted someone
from the Shelby organisation

267
00:19:35,804 --> 00:19:37,524
to introduce Mr Nelson to you

268
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:40,204
and to offer all three of you
an invitation.

269
00:19:40,324 --> 00:19:41,924
Ooh.

270
00:19:42,044 --> 00:19:43,684
What invitation?

271
00:19:43,804 --> 00:19:45,564
The invitation can wait.

272
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,604
And please remember that,
in this moment, in this room,

273
00:19:48,724 --> 00:19:51,084
it is the Shelby family
that holds the power,

274
00:19:51,204 --> 00:19:53,804
because we have the information
and the incentives

275
00:19:53,924 --> 00:19:57,724
that will make Mr Nelson
do what you require him to do.

276
00:19:57,844 --> 00:20:00,404
So when I speak, please keep
your fucking mouths closed,

277
00:20:00,524 --> 00:20:02,044
because, although I'm reluctant,

278
00:20:02,164 --> 00:20:03,524
I am actually quite good
at this.

279
00:20:03,644 --> 00:20:06,324
And yes, I will have champagne.

280
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:13,844
- Ah.
- Take care of this.

281
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:17,284
OK, so before
these dull introductions begin,

282
00:20:17,404 --> 00:20:19,444
I just have to tell you
something that my niece Gina

283
00:20:19,524 --> 00:20:21,764
- just told me.
- Jack.

284
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:24,324
She said the Shelby family
are all witches and sorcerers

285
00:20:24,444 --> 00:20:26,004
who speak freely with the dead.

286
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,964
So... who here's a Shelby?

287
00:20:31,724 --> 00:20:33,684
Is it true?

288
00:20:33,804 --> 00:20:35,684
Hmm. Gina.

289
00:20:35,804 --> 00:20:37,884
Hello, Ada.

290
00:20:38,924 --> 00:20:40,164
Michael sends his regards.

291
00:20:40,284 --> 00:20:41,924
You're the sister.

292
00:20:42,044 --> 00:20:45,364
Yes, it seems I am indeed
the sister.

293
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:48,444
I did some research.
You were a communist once,

294
00:20:48,564 --> 00:20:50,124
but diamonds and lipstick now.

295
00:20:50,244 --> 00:20:51,804
Actually, I'm a socialist.

296
00:20:51,924 --> 00:20:55,204
She's Mr Shelby's
political adviser.

297
00:20:55,324 --> 00:20:58,204
And you, you're the future
Prime Minister of Great Britain

298
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:00,564
- and its dominions.
- Indeed I am.

299
00:21:00,684 --> 00:21:03,244
And you, Lady Diana Mitford,

300
00:21:03,364 --> 00:21:06,124
the talk of London with
her amphetamines and emeralds.

301
00:21:07,804 --> 00:21:09,564
It's her sharp mind
that I'm in love with.

302
00:21:09,684 --> 00:21:11,684
Men bore me.

303
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:14,164
Ada, do you have a man?

304
00:21:14,284 --> 00:21:17,364
My husband died,
but of course we speak often.

305
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,484
Between
this sparkling conversation,

306
00:21:21,604 --> 00:21:24,724
could I get a drink
of some kind?

307
00:21:24,844 --> 00:21:27,684
So, this little kid Gina,
she runs out,

308
00:21:27,804 --> 00:21:29,444
she marries a gangster,

309
00:21:29,564 --> 00:21:31,484
and now here we all are.

310
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:33,964
Oh, Jack, please,
you're so blunt.

311
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,444
Yes, it's wonderful. A man who
is not careful with his words.

312
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:38,684
I'm not careful.

313
00:21:38,804 --> 00:21:41,524
Just say it first, and then
clear up the broken glass

314
00:21:41,644 --> 00:21:43,004
with my bare hands.

315
00:21:43,124 --> 00:21:44,324
There you are.

316
00:21:44,444 --> 00:21:46,964
I don't seem to have
a drink either.

317
00:21:48,364 --> 00:21:51,364
Well, I have Scotch or Irish.

318
00:21:51,484 --> 00:21:53,844
- Thomas drinks Irish.
- Where the hell is he?

319
00:21:53,964 --> 00:21:55,364
Irish.

320
00:21:55,484 --> 00:21:57,324
He's been unavoidably detained.

321
00:21:57,444 --> 00:21:58,564
Nothing's unavoidable.

322
00:21:58,684 --> 00:21:59,884
His daughter is unwell.

323
00:22:00,004 --> 00:22:02,564
He doesn't have a wife?

324
00:22:06,084 --> 00:22:09,004
You know, I did some research
on you too, Mr Nelson.

325
00:22:09,124 --> 00:22:11,324
Ada here is the smart one

326
00:22:11,444 --> 00:22:12,564
- of the family.
- I learnt

327
00:22:12,684 --> 00:22:14,924
that when you were young,
you lost a brother and a sister

328
00:22:15,044 --> 00:22:17,004
to consumption.

329
00:22:24,204 --> 00:22:25,324
No ice?

330
00:22:26,404 --> 00:22:29,564
Well, that same awful illness
has entered our family.

331
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:32,164
And, you see,
Thomas has very little faith

332
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,884
in current medical practices
regarding tuberculosis.

333
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:36,780
- Man, he has <i>that</i> right.
- He's gone off in search

334
00:22:36,804 --> 00:22:39,484
of alternative approaches
to curing the disease,

335
00:22:39,604 --> 00:22:42,084
experimental work that he hopes
will save the life

336
00:22:42,204 --> 00:22:43,284
of his daughter.

337
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,964
In his shoes, I would do
the same thing.

338
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:47,644
Your brother intrigues me.

339
00:22:47,764 --> 00:22:50,564
Yes, he often has that effect
on people.

340
00:22:52,124 --> 00:22:55,084
Yes, and my future husband
has that effect on

341
00:22:55,204 --> 00:22:58,044
20 million people in this
country who attend his rallies

342
00:22:58,164 --> 00:23:00,004
and listen to his broadcasts.

343
00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:02,164
It's amazing...

344
00:23:02,284 --> 00:23:05,444
...what English
upper-class women can do

345
00:23:05,564 --> 00:23:08,804
with just skin, bone
and arrogance.

346
00:23:10,324 --> 00:23:12,724
My brother sends his apologies
for not being here

347
00:23:12,844 --> 00:23:16,484
and would like to invite all of
you to his home for a meeting,

348
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,004
a meeting where the real
business will be done,

349
00:23:19,124 --> 00:23:22,244
and where you can meet
like minds from Ireland

350
00:23:22,364 --> 00:23:25,284
who would also like to discuss
the future of Europe.

351
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,324
But, as you say,
this lunch is purely social.

352
00:23:28,444 --> 00:23:32,164
And looking at my glass, I see
I still don't have champagne.

353
00:23:32,284 --> 00:23:35,324
Michael told me
the sister had gone straight.

354
00:23:35,444 --> 00:23:37,364
Yes, but her brother is the sun.

355
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:39,884
The rest just orbit around him.

356
00:23:41,924 --> 00:23:43,404
Gina tells me lots of things,

357
00:23:43,524 --> 00:23:46,284
but I want to hear it from you,
Ada.

358
00:23:48,484 --> 00:23:53,244
What exactly does
the Shelby Company Limited do?

359
00:24:12,044 --> 00:24:13,844
Fuck!

360
00:24:33,524 --> 00:24:36,044
You used to have eyes
in the back of your head.

361
00:24:37,604 --> 00:24:40,844
How can you change so much
and not change at all?

362
00:24:40,964 --> 00:24:43,164
I have other lines of enquiry.
Give me the spark plug.

363
00:24:43,284 --> 00:24:44,524
Give me the...

364
00:24:44,644 --> 00:24:46,164
Give me the fucking spark plug.

365
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,884
Give you the spark, give you
hope? Is that what you want?

366
00:24:57,084 --> 00:24:58,844
Something you should see.

367
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,684
Someone dead.

368
00:25:00,804 --> 00:25:02,604
Someone grieving.

369
00:25:03,684 --> 00:25:05,524
Lot of hate against you.

370
00:25:10,284 --> 00:25:12,564
You were wise to come to me,
Thomas.

371
00:25:14,204 --> 00:25:16,004
Open the bonnet, would you?

372
00:25:17,604 --> 00:25:18,844
What hate?

373
00:25:18,964 --> 00:25:21,404
What hate? What grieving?

374
00:25:45,124 --> 00:25:47,564
I can't explain where it is
you have to go,

375
00:25:47,684 --> 00:25:48,884
so I'll take you there.

376
00:25:50,324 --> 00:25:52,684
I hope the suspension's good.

377
00:25:52,804 --> 00:25:55,244
We're going to a wild old place.

378
00:26:09,884 --> 00:26:12,364
Mrs Thorne,
Mr Shelby isn't here.

379
00:26:12,484 --> 00:26:14,444
I know. I am.

380
00:26:14,564 --> 00:26:16,044
Do you know where he's gone?

381
00:26:16,164 --> 00:26:19,644
He's gone up a mountain
looking for a miracle.

382
00:26:19,764 --> 00:26:22,684
No-one is allowed to go in
if he's not here.

383
00:26:22,804 --> 00:26:24,404
Just bring me the keys.

384
00:26:24,524 --> 00:26:25,924
All of the keys.

385
00:26:48,604 --> 00:26:50,004
Do you want tea, Mrs Thorne?

386
00:26:50,124 --> 00:26:52,004
Whisky.

387
00:26:52,124 --> 00:26:55,044
Mr Shelby doesn't allow whisky
in the building any more.

388
00:26:55,164 --> 00:26:57,524
Then have someone
go and fetch some.

389
00:26:59,404 --> 00:27:03,804
Until Mr Shelby comes down off
his mountain, I'm in charge.

390
00:27:03,924 --> 00:27:05,324
Yes, Mrs Thorne.

391
00:27:40,244 --> 00:27:41,844
Fuck.

392
00:28:05,204 --> 00:28:07,404
Mickey, I've got to go.
The boss's sister is here.

393
00:28:07,524 --> 00:28:10,164
For the next five days,
I'm not the boss's sister,

394
00:28:10,284 --> 00:28:11,644
I'm the boss.

395
00:28:11,764 --> 00:28:13,324
Where is Arthur?

396
00:28:13,444 --> 00:28:15,284
We locked him in the cash safe.

397
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:17,324
When he gets the yamps
really bad,

398
00:28:17,444 --> 00:28:19,404
he tells us to lock him
in the safe,

399
00:28:19,524 --> 00:28:21,884
to stop him from slipping down
to Chinatown.

400
00:28:22,004 --> 00:28:25,924
- What are the yamps?
- When you lose your head.

401
00:28:26,044 --> 00:28:28,404
When you can't control yourself.

402
00:28:28,524 --> 00:28:29,684
Young people say it.

403
00:28:31,644 --> 00:28:34,684
Hmm. And Arthur gets the yamps
a lot?

404
00:28:34,804 --> 00:28:36,444
A lot is twice a day.

405
00:28:36,564 --> 00:28:38,684
Arthur gets them
three times a day.

406
00:28:40,164 --> 00:28:42,004
It smells in here.

407
00:28:42,124 --> 00:28:45,564
Arthur sleeps on the floor.
We lock him in at night.

408
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:47,004
On your feet.

409
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:52,044
Sit down.

410
00:28:57,284 --> 00:28:59,364
Nice perfume.

411
00:29:03,484 --> 00:29:05,964
Tommy likes you, Isiah.

412
00:29:06,084 --> 00:29:08,524
I believe I'm suited
to this life.

413
00:29:08,644 --> 00:29:10,684
I'm not so sure about you.

414
00:29:13,364 --> 00:29:14,844
I was given to understand

415
00:29:14,964 --> 00:29:17,444
that you are no longer part
of the company.

416
00:29:17,564 --> 00:29:19,284
Hmm.

417
00:29:19,404 --> 00:29:21,084
You speak well.

418
00:29:21,204 --> 00:29:23,524
I was going to be an accountant

419
00:29:23,644 --> 00:29:26,604
but everybody said I'd be
wasted counting money...

420
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:28,364
...instead of stealing it.

421
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:33,164
What's the name of that perfume?

422
00:29:33,284 --> 00:29:34,924
I've got a girlfriend
with a birthday.

423
00:29:36,564 --> 00:29:38,804
I want you to go to Liverpool.

424
00:29:38,924 --> 00:29:41,164
Then I will go to Liverpool.

425
00:29:41,284 --> 00:29:44,364
We have opium in storage
at the Salthouse Docks.

426
00:29:44,484 --> 00:29:46,604
Word got out
among the dock workers.

427
00:29:46,724 --> 00:29:49,684
They started stealing cupfuls.
Now it's by the bucket.

428
00:29:49,804 --> 00:29:51,724
By the bucket?

429
00:29:51,844 --> 00:29:54,124
The audacity of it.

430
00:29:56,204 --> 00:29:58,564
The sale of the stolen opium
is being organised

431
00:29:58,684 --> 00:30:01,964
by a union convenor
called Hayden Stagg.

432
00:30:02,084 --> 00:30:04,684
In the envelope you'll find
details of where to find him

433
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:07,284
and what to do to him
when you do.

434
00:30:10,364 --> 00:30:12,844
Is there a black star
in the envelope?

435
00:30:13,884 --> 00:30:15,804
I decided not.

436
00:30:16,844 --> 00:30:18,524
<i>You</i> decided?

437
00:30:18,644 --> 00:30:20,484
The name of the perfume is

438
00:30:20,604 --> 00:30:22,804
know your fucking place,
soldier.

439
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,964
I decided

440
00:30:26,084 --> 00:30:27,284
he'll just take a beating,

441
00:30:27,404 --> 00:30:31,284
and, also, that you're
going to take Arthur with you.

442
00:30:31,404 --> 00:30:33,844
Arthur, ten days clean,

443
00:30:33,964 --> 00:30:35,564
and we're gonna take him
into a warehouse

444
00:30:35,684 --> 00:30:36,684
full of fucking opium?

445
00:30:36,804 --> 00:30:39,004
It can be your job
to look after him.

446
00:30:39,124 --> 00:30:40,604
Why take him at all?

447
00:30:40,724 --> 00:30:43,084
It's his reputation
you're taking.

448
00:30:43,204 --> 00:30:46,404
The beating can be conducted
in a civilised way.

449
00:30:46,524 --> 00:30:48,924
No-one would dare fuck
with Arthur Shelby.

450
00:30:50,284 --> 00:30:53,084
- But they would fuck with me?
- Yes.

451
00:30:53,204 --> 00:30:54,924
He is Arthur Shelby.

452
00:30:55,044 --> 00:30:57,684
You're Isiah... who?

453
00:31:01,124 --> 00:31:03,164
I'm just Isiah...

454
00:31:03,284 --> 00:31:06,164
...who is keen to learn, Ada.

455
00:31:07,484 --> 00:31:08,844
Keep him clean.

456
00:31:10,164 --> 00:31:13,444
Deal with Hayden Stagg.
Bring Arthur back in one piece.

457
00:31:13,564 --> 00:31:15,884
And in return,
I won't tell Tommy

458
00:31:16,004 --> 00:31:19,604
that you're laying private bets
on races that we've fixed.

459
00:31:21,124 --> 00:31:23,884
Just trying to make
a few extra pennies,

460
00:31:24,004 --> 00:31:26,724
buy that birthday present
for my girlfriend.

461
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:29,324
Mmm, lucky girl.

462
00:32:16,804 --> 00:32:19,244
Lock the door, Lizzie.
There are people around here

463
00:32:19,364 --> 00:32:21,804
who start drinking
this early in the morning.

464
00:32:27,924 --> 00:32:29,124
No.

465
00:32:30,724 --> 00:32:34,244
I need to stay myself...
be strong.

466
00:32:34,364 --> 00:32:37,484
Now, come on, not with me.
You can let it go with me.

467
00:32:37,604 --> 00:32:40,724
I can't cry, Ada.
If I start, I'll fall apart.

468
00:32:41,924 --> 00:32:43,964
I need to stay strong for Ruby.

469
00:32:47,004 --> 00:32:49,204
Tommy says
it's just in one lung.

470
00:32:49,324 --> 00:32:52,604
No. They now think
it's in both.

471
00:32:52,724 --> 00:32:54,804
It's... moving quickly.

472
00:32:56,964 --> 00:32:59,364
They collapsed the left lung
but it made no difference.

473
00:33:00,444 --> 00:33:03,044
They're starting her
on the gold salts tomorrow.

474
00:33:06,124 --> 00:33:09,404
You know somebody who died
on the gold treatment, yes?

475
00:33:09,524 --> 00:33:11,844
Half the people I tell look
like you just did,

476
00:33:11,964 --> 00:33:15,204
because they know someone
who died on the gold treatment.

477
00:33:17,684 --> 00:33:19,484
The person I knew was old.

478
00:33:19,604 --> 00:33:22,284
Huh. Old and young, the same.

479
00:33:26,724 --> 00:33:28,204
Have you given up, Lizzie?

480
00:33:30,764 --> 00:33:32,364
No.

481
00:33:32,484 --> 00:33:35,084
I'm... being strong...

482
00:33:36,524 --> 00:33:38,364
...at her bedside...
on my own...

483
00:33:39,964 --> 00:33:41,524
...while Tommy is up
in the mountains

484
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,324
to be amongst Gypsies.

485
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:46,564
In truth, it's a blessing

486
00:33:46,684 --> 00:33:48,804
he's not around at the hospital,

487
00:33:48,924 --> 00:33:51,324
because all he wants to do
is fight people

488
00:33:51,444 --> 00:33:53,084
and blame himself,

489
00:33:53,204 --> 00:33:54,924
and I've never felt
so ashamed of him,

490
00:33:55,044 --> 00:33:58,324
Christ, because right now I...
I need a normal man.

491
00:34:01,284 --> 00:34:03,804
It's me sitting there,
taking away the bloody rags

492
00:34:03,924 --> 00:34:05,604
and watching her disappear.

493
00:34:27,884 --> 00:34:29,924
Do you know when he's back, Ada?

494
00:34:31,364 --> 00:34:33,844
He gave me instructions,
not information.

495
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:40,124
Can you get a message to him?

496
00:34:41,284 --> 00:34:42,724
He'll be out of reach.

497
00:34:43,844 --> 00:34:45,844
Ada, I thought you might
know things.

498
00:34:47,364 --> 00:34:49,324
I've been away from all this.

499
00:34:50,644 --> 00:34:52,124
You're still Gypsy.

500
00:34:52,244 --> 00:34:55,204
Yeah, well...
The mystery leaves you.

501
00:34:57,084 --> 00:34:58,324
What mystery?

502
00:34:58,444 --> 00:35:00,764
Lizzie, is there anything
practical that I can do?

503
00:35:05,124 --> 00:35:08,284
Before he left, he was looking
for a number for Esme.

504
00:35:09,364 --> 00:35:11,524
What's Esme got to do with this?

505
00:35:11,644 --> 00:35:13,604
I thought you might know.

506
00:35:15,124 --> 00:35:17,364
Esme's a Lee.

507
00:35:18,364 --> 00:35:19,524
What does that mean?

508
00:35:19,644 --> 00:35:22,604
The Lees and the Barwells,
they're wild tribes.

509
00:35:24,564 --> 00:35:26,004
Where do they live?

510
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,284
They're Gypsies.
They live where they like.

511
00:35:28,404 --> 00:35:30,164
Fuck.

512
00:35:30,284 --> 00:35:32,244
Fuck, Ada.

513
00:35:35,604 --> 00:35:37,644
Tribes in the mountains!

514
00:35:39,964 --> 00:35:43,084
It's 1934, and the doctors
know what it is,

515
00:35:43,204 --> 00:35:44,564
they know what causes it,

516
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,604
but, oh, no, my husband,
he knows better.

517
00:35:46,724 --> 00:35:48,764
Not a normal man, your brother.

518
00:35:49,884 --> 00:35:51,484
He's up in the mountains with...

519
00:35:51,604 --> 00:35:53,204
...fucking horse thieves
and sorcerers

520
00:35:53,324 --> 00:35:55,004
while I'm here on my own.

521
00:35:57,084 --> 00:35:58,804
Not a normal man.

522
00:36:48,244 --> 00:36:51,404
It's OK, Arthur.
I'll look after you.

523
00:36:52,724 --> 00:36:54,324
Yeah.

524
00:36:54,444 --> 00:36:57,444
And Ada said it'd be OK
if I recruited my cousins -

525
00:36:57,564 --> 00:37:00,964
off the streets of Alum Rock
and looking for the big time.

526
00:37:04,044 --> 00:37:05,524
What do you say, Arthur?

527
00:37:20,844 --> 00:37:23,684
I say big-time boys
don't ask for permission.

528
00:37:25,724 --> 00:37:27,764
I think he means you're in.

529
00:37:27,884 --> 00:37:29,324
Let's go.

530
00:37:50,564 --> 00:37:52,284
Can you still ride bareback?

531
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:59,084
We're a long way from anywhere,
Esme.

532
00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:01,564
If I find out
you've been wasting my time,

533
00:39:01,684 --> 00:39:03,884
I'll use that rope
to fucking hang you.

534
00:39:21,964 --> 00:39:24,764
Right, hold up,
Hold on, hold on.

535
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:27,564
Listen, you know
what you've got to do, right?

536
00:39:27,684 --> 00:39:30,564
You've got your orders.
I'm depending on you.

537
00:39:30,684 --> 00:39:32,084
Do you hear me?

538
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:33,964
Let me tell you something.

539
00:39:34,084 --> 00:39:39,324
Any man, any fucking man
who looked like this before...

540
00:39:41,684 --> 00:39:43,324
...they're Peaky Blinder.

541
00:39:43,444 --> 00:39:45,884
Peaky Blinder
still looks like this...

542
00:39:47,364 --> 00:39:48,844
...after.

543
00:40:17,644 --> 00:40:20,604
We are here to meet a gentleman
called Hayden Stagg.

544
00:40:22,244 --> 00:40:23,524
A gentleman?

545
00:40:25,404 --> 00:40:26,804
Mr Stagg?

546
00:40:30,044 --> 00:40:31,324
That scoundrel.

547
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:34,764
Never there when you need him.

548
00:40:38,124 --> 00:40:39,764
Who needs him?

549
00:40:39,884 --> 00:40:41,124
We do.

550
00:40:42,324 --> 00:40:43,924
Where is he?

551
00:40:46,084 --> 00:40:48,324
The last I saw, he was...

552
00:40:48,444 --> 00:40:50,844
...up to his balls in a lady
called Maria.

553
00:40:55,124 --> 00:40:56,844
We have no time for tradition

554
00:40:56,964 --> 00:40:58,924
or the rules of
the sporting life,

555
00:40:59,044 --> 00:41:01,644
because, among
the Peaky Blinders,

556
00:41:01,764 --> 00:41:05,764
any man who comes home from
a mission with all his bullets,

557
00:41:05,884 --> 00:41:07,724
he pays a fine.

558
00:41:09,004 --> 00:41:11,404
My name's Hayden Stagg.

559
00:41:11,524 --> 00:41:14,244
I hear there's some men here
from Birmingham looking for me.

560
00:41:15,924 --> 00:41:18,884
I was in the banana warehouse
playing football with the boys.

561
00:41:27,324 --> 00:41:30,764
But I'm guessing you gentlemen
aren't here to kick footballs.

562
00:41:32,004 --> 00:41:33,564
No.

563
00:41:33,684 --> 00:41:36,444
We're here about other business.

564
00:41:37,564 --> 00:41:40,004
We like to call it
Black Star business.

565
00:41:40,124 --> 00:41:42,204
The Black Star a pub, is it?

566
00:41:44,724 --> 00:41:46,644
Yeah. The Black Star's a pub.

567
00:41:48,244 --> 00:41:51,364
The last pub
you ever fucking drink in.

568
00:41:51,484 --> 00:41:53,444
Peaky Blinders
take you to the Black Star...

569
00:41:53,564 --> 00:41:55,404
...and all your troubles
are done.

570
00:41:57,924 --> 00:42:00,484
But the pub <i>you</i> drink in,
Mr Stagg...

571
00:42:01,764 --> 00:42:04,324
...is called the Dolphin,
right?

572
00:42:04,444 --> 00:42:07,164
Every night... you're in there.

573
00:42:09,324 --> 00:42:11,324
Not to drink.

574
00:42:11,444 --> 00:42:14,444
You're there divvying up
the day's takings, ain't ya?

575
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:19,684
And there's a woman there.

576
00:42:21,204 --> 00:42:24,084
She sings out,
"Opium for sale!"

577
00:42:28,124 --> 00:42:30,004
Sit down, boys.

578
00:42:34,324 --> 00:42:36,484
The rules say the king
puts his head on the block

579
00:42:36,604 --> 00:42:38,044
when the game's up.

580
00:42:39,844 --> 00:42:42,684
You're stealing from
the Shelby Company Limited.

581
00:42:44,244 --> 00:42:46,884
You're stealing from
the Peaky Blinders, man.

582
00:42:50,444 --> 00:42:51,764
Therefore...

583
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:55,804
...punishment...

584
00:42:57,284 --> 00:43:00,004
...is a visit
to the Black Star pub.

585
00:43:01,844 --> 00:43:03,284
Hmm.

586
00:43:05,884 --> 00:43:08,684
But... out of kindness...

587
00:43:10,444 --> 00:43:12,044
...of my heart...

588
00:43:12,164 --> 00:43:15,284
...your sentence
has been commuted.

589
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:19,004
Praise the fucking Lord!

590
00:43:20,244 --> 00:43:22,164
And our lovely Ada, eh?

591
00:43:25,804 --> 00:43:27,564
Instead...

592
00:43:29,284 --> 00:43:32,044
...instead, Mr Hayden Stagg,
it's just a beating for you.

593
00:43:34,684 --> 00:43:36,924
Well, before
I take this beating...

594
00:43:39,044 --> 00:43:40,964
Arthur Shelby, is it, yeah?

595
00:43:42,844 --> 00:43:47,284
Well, comrade, beneath
your sleeves lies the truth.

596
00:43:47,404 --> 00:43:49,044
The marks on your arm.

597
00:43:50,284 --> 00:43:51,364
Yeah.

598
00:43:51,484 --> 00:43:54,004
Stories about you
come up the canal.

599
00:43:54,124 --> 00:43:57,044
You know, where once
you walked fine alone,

600
00:43:57,164 --> 00:43:59,084
now you need a stick.

601
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:01,084
Let's just fucking do it,
Arthur.

602
00:44:02,884 --> 00:44:05,964
For me, it was the morphine
they gave us in France.

603
00:44:06,084 --> 00:44:07,764
I got a taste for it, Arthur.

604
00:44:09,444 --> 00:44:13,364
It was 1924 before I realised
the fucking war was over.

605
00:44:14,804 --> 00:44:18,564
There's a warehouse full of it
just across the yard, there,

606
00:44:18,684 --> 00:44:20,844
where the boys play football.

607
00:44:20,964 --> 00:44:23,724
And they steal it
and roll around laughing,

608
00:44:23,844 --> 00:44:25,724
and it floats in the air.

609
00:44:28,884 --> 00:44:31,204
But I'm strong, comrade.

610
00:44:31,324 --> 00:44:33,564
Arthur, let's just
fucking do it.

611
00:44:35,604 --> 00:44:36,724
Liar.

612
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:38,684
It's me that's due a beating,

613
00:44:38,804 --> 00:44:41,964
but it's me who feels sorry
for <i>you,</i> Mr Shelby,

614
00:44:42,084 --> 00:44:46,404
because you take your beating
every hour of every day.

615
00:44:46,524 --> 00:44:50,644
Your own blood betrays you,
because it demands dilution.

616
00:44:52,324 --> 00:44:55,164
Sometimes you want
to cut a doorway in your arm

617
00:44:55,284 --> 00:44:58,444
so your blood can escape
and leave you in blessed peace.

618
00:44:58,564 --> 00:44:59,724
Yeah.

619
00:45:01,124 --> 00:45:02,924
Fuck you, man.

620
00:45:03,044 --> 00:45:05,404
I was once where you are now,
Arthur.

621
00:45:08,964 --> 00:45:11,364
If you're going to do it, do it.

622
00:45:11,484 --> 00:45:14,444
But look at me
as the man you can be.

623
00:45:17,724 --> 00:45:19,484
You've tried Jesus, yeah?

624
00:45:19,604 --> 00:45:22,764
Yeah, he looked you up and down
and he shook his head.

625
00:45:22,884 --> 00:45:24,244
Your loved ones?

626
00:45:25,964 --> 00:45:28,244
Your wife, your kids?

627
00:45:32,924 --> 00:45:36,924
Jesus and your wife
and your kids can't help you.

628
00:45:38,804 --> 00:45:42,044
Only you, Arthur Shelby.

629
00:45:43,444 --> 00:45:45,404
Only you.

630
00:45:45,524 --> 00:45:47,404
Don't count the days.

631
00:45:47,524 --> 00:45:49,204
Futile.

632
00:45:49,324 --> 00:45:51,084
You get to 100,
and then you wake up

633
00:45:51,204 --> 00:45:52,764
and it's fucking one again.

634
00:45:55,884 --> 00:45:58,244
Don't build mountains.

635
00:45:58,364 --> 00:46:01,084
Walk like it's a flat plain.

636
00:46:02,484 --> 00:46:05,884
Easy step... by easy step.

637
00:46:08,164 --> 00:46:09,524
Arthur, just give me

638
00:46:09,644 --> 00:46:11,764
the fucking word!
I'll fucking do it!

639
00:46:15,124 --> 00:46:18,044
Use your stick, Arthur.
Give him the order.

640
00:46:24,004 --> 00:46:26,844
Arthur, I'm not gonna
ask you fucking twice!

641
00:46:26,964 --> 00:46:29,684
- Isiah, leave him alone.
- No... No fucking way.

642
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:33,524
Isiah, I said
you can stand down!

643
00:46:50,284 --> 00:46:51,924
Be off. Let's go. Come on.

644
00:46:52,044 --> 00:46:54,684
Come on, all of ya! Go on.

645
00:46:54,804 --> 00:46:56,044
Go on!

646
00:47:32,404 --> 00:47:34,204
Gypsy graveyard?

647
00:47:34,324 --> 00:47:36,084
You can still read the signs?

648
00:47:37,484 --> 00:47:40,244
No horse will go beyond here.
We'll have to walk.

649
00:47:48,044 --> 00:47:49,844
Just tell me whose grave it is.

650
00:47:49,964 --> 00:47:51,684
You'll see.

651
00:47:51,804 --> 00:47:53,804
Who knows what you'll see?

652
00:47:56,284 --> 00:47:58,204
Do you ever go to John's grave?

653
00:47:58,324 --> 00:47:59,884
When things are really bad.

654
00:48:00,004 --> 00:48:01,844
When what's really bad?

655
00:48:01,964 --> 00:48:03,924
I've done bad things, Esme.

656
00:48:05,284 --> 00:48:07,724
And you think now you're being
punished for them?

657
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:09,604
I would like to make amends.

658
00:48:09,724 --> 00:48:12,404
You want to lift every curse
anyone's ever put on you?

659
00:48:12,524 --> 00:48:14,244
That's a lot of lifting.

660
00:48:14,364 --> 00:48:16,124
My own curse is in there
somewhere.

661
00:48:16,244 --> 00:48:17,884
I should have done more
to protect John.

662
00:48:18,004 --> 00:48:19,124
You think in this holy place

663
00:48:19,204 --> 00:48:21,164
the spirits are listening
to you being kind?

664
00:48:21,284 --> 00:48:24,244
Believe it or not, Esme,
I'm discovering kindness.

665
00:48:24,364 --> 00:48:26,444
I'm learning it
from my children.

666
00:48:26,564 --> 00:48:29,924
Do you ever think
you've lost your mind, Thomas?

667
00:48:30,044 --> 00:48:33,764
Lost it long ago. I only use
the crate it came in.

668
00:48:33,884 --> 00:48:37,164
- I know why you're here.
- I'm in a hurry, Esme.

669
00:48:37,284 --> 00:48:39,444
You think you can make a deal
even with death?

670
00:48:39,564 --> 00:48:42,244
Well, soon you'll be
in the right place to do it.

671
00:48:42,364 --> 00:48:44,804
The village disappeared.
Church fell down.

672
00:48:44,924 --> 00:48:46,844
Only us still use the graveyard.

673
00:48:48,644 --> 00:48:50,324
Do you recall a sapphire?

674
00:48:52,484 --> 00:48:55,164
You gave a sapphire to
a woman called Bethany Barwell.

675
00:48:55,284 --> 00:48:56,764
Ten years ago.

676
00:48:56,884 --> 00:48:58,764
She took the stone back
to her camp.

677
00:48:58,884 --> 00:49:01,484
I warned her about it,
but she took it anyway.

678
00:49:01,604 --> 00:49:04,164
She gave the sapphire
to her sister.

679
00:49:04,284 --> 00:49:05,964
Evadne Barwell.

680
00:49:06,084 --> 00:49:08,844
Evadne put the stone around
the neck of her daughter.

681
00:49:08,964 --> 00:49:10,364
A little girl.

682
00:49:12,204 --> 00:49:14,844
Straight away, the little girl
began to cough.

683
00:49:16,604 --> 00:49:18,564
She died that night.

684
00:49:18,684 --> 00:49:19,964
Seven years old.

685
00:49:27,324 --> 00:49:30,404
I heard they threw the sapphire
in the river.

686
00:49:30,524 --> 00:49:32,844
No-one's ever gone
to look for it.

687
00:49:34,684 --> 00:49:36,724
I'm guessing
it'll be the girl's mother

688
00:49:36,844 --> 00:49:38,364
who laid the curse.

689
00:49:38,484 --> 00:49:40,604
Only women can lay curses.

690
00:49:42,004 --> 00:49:44,604
Perhaps she waited till
your little girl was seven,

691
00:49:44,724 --> 00:49:47,084
so you'd know how it feels.

692
00:49:58,404 --> 00:50:00,284
- Do you have whisky?
- No.

693
00:50:16,844 --> 00:50:18,484
Tommy!

694
00:50:18,604 --> 00:50:21,644
Perhaps the treatment will work
and your daughter will live.

695
00:50:24,004 --> 00:50:26,084
It's science.

696
00:50:26,204 --> 00:50:28,604
Science is winning everything
these days.

697
00:50:28,724 --> 00:50:30,964
Even against the angels.

698
00:50:35,884 --> 00:50:38,404
I can leave you, if you want.

699
00:50:38,524 --> 00:50:41,044
Your horse'll know its way back.

700
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:43,204
But I think there should be
some reward

701
00:50:43,324 --> 00:50:46,084
for what I have shown you,
some consideration.

702
00:50:46,204 --> 00:50:48,804
You can afford it,
Mr Shelby OBE.

703
00:50:50,164 --> 00:50:51,684
I will find her.

704
00:50:51,804 --> 00:50:53,924
I will find this fucking
Evadne Barwell,

705
00:50:54,044 --> 00:50:55,484
I will fucking find her,

706
00:50:55,604 --> 00:50:57,604
and I will give her money
to take back this curse!

707
00:50:57,724 --> 00:50:59,844
You only found me
because I wanted to be found.

708
00:50:59,964 --> 00:51:01,964
And the Barwells roam
from the border to the sea.

709
00:51:02,084 --> 00:51:04,164
I will give her £10,000.
More. Anything!

710
00:51:04,284 --> 00:51:05,404
You will put out word, Esme.

711
00:51:05,524 --> 00:51:07,204
You will put out word.
I will put out word,

712
00:51:07,324 --> 00:51:08,844
and I will find her!
And instead

713
00:51:08,964 --> 00:51:10,804
- of this poor wooden cross...
- Tommy!

714
00:51:10,924 --> 00:51:13,684
...I will build a monument
to this little girl!

715
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:15,164
Her mother can decide how big.

716
00:51:15,284 --> 00:51:17,964
It can be as big as
fucking Nelson's Column.

717
00:51:18,084 --> 00:51:20,804
That, and £10,000!

718
00:51:20,924 --> 00:51:23,724
I will buy her off.
I will start looking today.

719
00:51:23,844 --> 00:51:25,084
Ruby will be well!

720
00:51:26,364 --> 00:51:28,204
She will be well!

721
00:51:28,324 --> 00:51:31,324
And I will undo the many wrongs
that I have done!

722
00:51:31,444 --> 00:51:34,004
Now that I'm without whisky,
I can hear the spirits clearly,

723
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:36,444
and they're saying that Ruby
will be well if I make amends.

724
00:51:36,564 --> 00:51:37,804
That is the conversation!

725
00:51:37,924 --> 00:51:39,460
If you want my help,
I will help you, Thomas,

726
00:51:39,484 --> 00:51:42,844
if you also pay me. Pay me and
I will help you to find her.

727
00:51:42,964 --> 00:51:44,964
- I will pay you.
- But I don't want money.

728
00:51:45,084 --> 00:51:47,524
I don't read the papers,
but I know there was a crash,

729
00:51:47,644 --> 00:51:49,804
and nothing is certain,
and money loses value.

730
00:51:49,924 --> 00:51:52,444
Instead of money, give me gold.

731
00:51:52,564 --> 00:51:54,044
Gold. Yes.

732
00:51:54,164 --> 00:51:55,364
I will give you gold.

733
00:51:55,484 --> 00:51:57,684
In uncertain times,
gold is always certain.

734
00:51:57,804 --> 00:52:01,804
I will give you gold. And you
will help me find this woman.

735
00:52:01,924 --> 00:52:04,444
And she will spare my daughter.

736
00:52:23,524 --> 00:52:25,404
- Lizzie!
- Where the fuck were you?!

737
00:52:26,724 --> 00:52:30,124
Where were you?
Where the fuck were you?!

738
00:52:35,324 --> 00:52:37,484
She's gone, Tommy.

739
00:52:41,084 --> 00:52:42,644
She's gone.

740
00:52:44,404 --> 00:52:46,284
Just now. 5.17.

741
00:52:51,044 --> 00:52:54,684
You weren't fucking here...
were you?

742
00:52:55,924 --> 00:52:57,404
Were you?

743
00:53:08,604 --> 00:53:10,524
It was before then,
and she was here,

744
00:53:10,644 --> 00:53:11,844
and then she was gone,

745
00:53:11,964 --> 00:53:14,444
and now she's gone to
where they've put the dead.

746
00:53:17,044 --> 00:53:18,964
They've put her
with the dead people.

747
00:53:29,604 --> 00:53:31,524
She was asking, just now,
for you...

748
00:53:33,164 --> 00:53:34,164
...but went...

749
00:53:36,124 --> 00:53:37,524
...at 5.17.

750
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:49,044
I told her that you loved...

751
00:53:51,964 --> 00:53:53,964
I gave her your kiss goodbye.
