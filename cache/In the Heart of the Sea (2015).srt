27
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,573
No boarders after 8 o'clock.

28
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:05,359
You came.

29
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,692
Someone here for you, my love.

30
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,567
Tom Nickerson?

31
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:22,908
Herman Melville.

32
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,471
We received your letter.

33
00:03:26,536 --> 00:03:28,391
You are either a desperate man,

34
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,509
or a fool to come
all the way to Nantucket.

35
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:33,535
Well,

36
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:35,767
my offer still stands.

37
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,825
Three months' lodgings
for a single night's talk.

38
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,887
All I have in the world.

39
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,848
But I prefer to think of it as an investment.

40
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:47,882
I want you to tell me what happened...

41
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:49,970
to the Essex.

42
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,257
What do you think happened?

43
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,728
There are rumblings.

44
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:03,178
Rumors that the Essex was...
What do you want?

45
00:04:03,597 --> 00:04:05,556
What story do you expect to hear?

46
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:07,129
That of the whale.

47
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,407
The Essex ran aground.

48
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:13,782
There was a full inquiry.

49
00:04:13,807 --> 00:04:16,350
I believe the inquiry was less than truthful.

50
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,174
Get out.

51
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:23,157
You are the last survivor of the Essex sir.

52
00:04:23,943 --> 00:04:25,527
If you won't talk, who will?

53
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,241
Did you not hear me?

54
00:04:27,714 --> 00:04:28,590
Leave.

55
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:29,967
Now.

56
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,696
No. You must not go. Please.
He is in no mind to talk.

57
00:04:36,721 --> 00:04:39,264
And I have not come all this way
to be humiliated and waste my time.

58
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,082
Please, Mr. Melville.

59
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,941
He won't talk about the Essex to me.

60
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:46,363
To anyone. Never has. Never.

61
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,938
There is an agony about him.

62
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,864
His soul is...

63
00:04:53,852 --> 00:04:55,282
in torment,

64
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,913
and in need of confession.

65
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,091
Please, just let me talk to him.

66
00:05:01,116 --> 00:05:01,917
Please.

67
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,071
Love.

68
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,868
I believe it would do you good
to talk to the man.

69
00:05:17,976 --> 00:05:18,843
No.

70
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:24,389
You listen well.

71
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,834
Who holds this place together
while you drink yourself to death?

72
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,410
You will talk with this man

73
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:33,071
as much as is necessary,

74
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:34,637
to keep the money.

75
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,795
You know our circumstances Thomas.

76
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,100
Only as much as is necessary.

77
00:05:57,513 --> 00:05:58,780
I will get whiskey.

78
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,215
I neglected to mention it in my letter but...

79
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,027
I was a whaler once.

80
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,137
One trip, I mean.

81
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:14,521
Green hand.

82
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,833
So, you have seen it all.

83
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,488
My wife read your books.

84
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:22,912
She...

85
00:06:23,147 --> 00:06:24,176
enjoyed them.

86
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:25,712
I am happy to hear it.

87
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,555
I have had good sales.

88
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,503
And I think this story...

89
00:06:30,946 --> 00:06:33,298
could surpass the success
of even my first novel,

90
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:35,088
which did quite well.

91
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,301
Another of your...

92
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:38,340
seafaring yarns?

93
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,194
Have you read Hawthorne, Mr. Melville?

94
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,930
Now there is a writer.

95
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,805
Great writer.

96
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:50,993
He is.

97
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:54,902
But he is not here.

98
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,789
And I am.

99
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,291
For my own particular reasons.

100
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,625
I will tell you of the Essex.

101
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,556
I believe you will be disappointed.

102
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,420
But every word I say will be true.

103
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:18,509
Story of the Essex,

104
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:20,732
is the story of two men.

105
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,265
Captain George Pollard,

106
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:26,917
and his first mate,

107
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,722
Owen Chase.

108
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:30,688
Owen.

109
00:07:31,391 --> 00:07:32,692
You don't wanna be late.

110
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,156
I will be there.

111
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,706
Besides, can't have our daughter
sleeping under a leaky roof, can we?

112
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,083
What makes you so sure it's a girl?

113
00:07:40,908 --> 00:07:42,033
Well, it has to be.

114
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,327
So she can remind me
why I still love you

115
00:07:44,351 --> 00:07:45,547
when you are being stubborn.

116
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:48,414
Well, if it's to be a daughter,
she will be a version of you, not me.

117
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,203
Blond locks and determined
to conquer the world.

118
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:55,098
I suppose after today, you will be
trading in that tunic for a uniform.

119
00:07:55,123 --> 00:07:56,114
That's right.

120
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,226
Finally out of this patch of dirt,

121
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:00,036
into a captain's house like you deserve.

122
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:03,491
I don't need one of those houses
in town with stuffy neighbors.

123
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,561
There is plenty of room here
for the three of us.

124
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,069
You know, sometimes your kind heart
and good nature

125
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,046
is just unbearable.

126
00:08:12,232 --> 00:08:13,699
Go get your captaincy.

127
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,299
What's your bid?
I will have 1.90.

128
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,331
I have got 1,000 gallons at 2 dollars!

129
00:09:02,356 --> 00:09:03,564
I will take 40 shares!

130
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,637
Seller! Seller! Over here!

131
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,195
Criterion's back with a fine haul.

132
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,762
1,600 barrels.

133
00:09:15,787 --> 00:09:16,972
A new record.

134
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,809
50 Pound sterling for head matter
on the London market.

135
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:23,332
Congratulations.

136
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,728
Good morning Mr. Chase.

137
00:09:33,752 --> 00:09:34,656
Mr. Mason.

138
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,762
Come in please.

139
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,853
My partner Benjamin Fuller.

140
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,244
Good morning sir.

141
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,673
Do sit down.

142
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,408
Mr. Chase.

143
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,815
I do hope you realize how satisfied we are

144
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,775
with the work you have done for us
over the years.

145
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,947
Thank you sir.

146
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,793
Now one of our ships,

147
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:57,927
the Essex

148
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,213
has just been refitted at great expense,

149
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:01,725
and is to go to sea.

150
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,025
Now having made
such an investment in her,

151
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,256
we want to be sure
she is in the best possible hands.

152
00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:09,490
So,

153
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:13,506
it gives us great pleasure
to offer you a position aboard her.

154
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,014
As first mate.

155
00:10:19,587 --> 00:10:20,748
As first mate?

156
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,017
Mr. Mason, you-you promised me
command of a ship after my last voyage

157
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,075
when I brought you back 1500 barrels.
Do you remember?

158
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,338
You gave me your word.

159
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,995
That promise must now be deferred.

160
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,804
Like everyone else,
we have had a lean time recently.

161
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,192
No never on my watch.

162
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,504
Nantucket now dominates
the world market.

163
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,278
That must not change.

164
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,244
This is no time for experimentation.

165
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,556
The Essex will be captained
by George Pollard,

166
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,228
scion of a great whaling family.

167
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,313
His father also happens to be our patron.

168
00:10:57,611 --> 00:10:58,851
Blood Mr. Chase.

169
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,686
You can have all the voyages
under your belt you want

170
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,490
but blood will always win out.

171
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,531
Yes well blood is not gonna fill
a ship with oil Mr. Mason.

172
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,828
To successfully command
a captain needs respect.

173
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:10,343
Now what if the men don't respect him?

174
00:11:11,164 --> 00:11:12,893
You will make sure that they do.

175
00:11:13,729 --> 00:11:15,048
Good day gentlemen.

176
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,417
I understand your disappointment

177
00:11:17,691 --> 00:11:18,676
So...

178
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,496
a one fifteenth lay.

179
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,371
That's more than
I have ever paid any first officer.

180
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,846
And if you bring back
2000 barrels of oil

181
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:31,314
I give you my word...

182
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,135
next time you will have your captaincy.

183
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,642
You have given me
your word before Mr. Mason.

184
00:11:40,502 --> 00:11:42,657
No this time I will take it in writing.

185
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,109
Captain Pollard.

186
00:11:58,349 --> 00:12:01,592
We have just had a most
agreeable conversation with Mr. Chase.

187
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,536
He will be honored to serve under you.

188
00:12:05,027 --> 00:12:06,271
I am glad to hear it.

189
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,523
Now I am to babysit a greenhorn.

190
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:13,753
Some chinless Nantucketer born
with a damn silver spoon in his mouth.

191
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,208
You know I should have thrown
the offer back in their faces.

192
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:16,933
Why?

193
00:12:17,534 --> 00:12:19,680
You now have
the offer of command in writing.

194
00:12:19,858 --> 00:12:23,050
Yes well a liar's word is worthless
even on paper.

195
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,144
You know I would love you just as much
if you were a merchant captain.

196
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,472
And you would not be gone for 2 years.

197
00:12:38,854 --> 00:12:40,094
I won't be gone 2 years.

198
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:43,071
A Bedford whaler came back
last week who was gone 3.

199
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,480
She lost two men,
and still with her hull half empty.

200
00:12:46,505 --> 00:12:48,891
Yeah well they were from Bedford
and they didn't have me on board.

201
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,507
Son of a bitch!

202
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,202
I will captain my own ship!

203
00:13:02,177 --> 00:13:03,363
A whaling ship.

204
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,015
Up to them all we would ever have
is this patch of dirt

205
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,535
and that's not gonna happen Peggy.

206
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,622
Those are your father's words not yours.

207
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,341
What's wrong with his words?

208
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,778
He wanted things
for his family for himself.

209
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:18,109
He was a dreamer Owen.

210
00:13:18,328 --> 00:13:19,312
Yes he was.

211
00:13:20,094 --> 00:13:22,992
Dreamed of the sea and never got
to sail it because of men like them.

212
00:13:23,226 --> 00:13:25,117
At least he got to see his children born.

213
00:13:34,283 --> 00:13:35,485
It's all I know.

214
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,748
I am sorry.

215
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,365
I married a whaleman.

216
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,495
Hey.

217
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,451
I will come back as quick
as a summer's night I swear.

218
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:10,256
Just come back.

219
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:13,192
Promise me.

220
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,944
I already swore to you.
Now you want me to promise too?

221
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,988
I promise.

222
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,533
Son, a word with you.

223
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,682
To be a captain, you cannot be a friend.

224
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,588
You are their superior.

225
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,168
Never forget that.

226
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:50,862
Never let them forget that.

227
00:14:51,705 --> 00:14:52,651
Thank you sir.

228
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,508
Your great grandfather
and a few others,

229
00:14:55,742 --> 00:14:57,216
created this industry.

230
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,261
Without us, without you,

231
00:14:59,605 --> 00:15:01,594
the world plunges into darkness.

232
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,898
I hope to bring honor
to the Pollard family name sir.

233
00:15:11,587 --> 00:15:14,997
Thou didst, O Lord,
create the mighty whale.

234
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,317
That wondrous monster of a mighty length,

235
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,157
beyond conception,

236
00:15:20,427 --> 00:15:22,122
his unmeasured strength.

237
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:25,622
But everlasting God, thou dost ordain

238
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,539
That we,

239
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:28,457
poor feeble mortals,

240
00:15:28,481 --> 00:15:29,727
should engage.

241
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,582
Ourselves our wives
and children to maintain

242
00:15:33,963 --> 00:15:35,923
This dreadful monster,

243
00:15:35,947 --> 00:15:37,441
with a martial rage.

244
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,716
O Father,

245
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:44,140
grant that your glorious light,

246
00:15:44,164 --> 00:15:45,599
shine on these men.

247
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,810
Ensure them a prosperous voyage

248
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,824
that they may return safely
and with a full ship

249
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,879
so that the white flames
of Nantucket whale oil

250
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,949
may continue to keep light in our homes

251
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,617
city streets safe from sin in the night

252
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,671
and to fuel the machines of industry

253
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,656
that drive our great nation forward

254
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,867
as our noble species evolves.

255
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,898
In your name we pray.

256
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,723
So,

257
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:27,516
what month was this?

258
00:16:28,173 --> 00:16:29,501
Late in the year.

259
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,845
We were one of the last ships to go out

260
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:34,776
which is why my friend
Barzillai and I got a berth.

261
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:36,358
You know...

262
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:38,409
I was 14.

263
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,088
14.

264
00:16:41,397 --> 00:16:44,030
<i>Nickerson, you are standing
around boy. Move!</i>

265
00:16:44,147 --> 00:16:45,451
First time to sea.

266
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:47,787
Scared but more scared to show it.

267
00:16:47,942 --> 00:16:49,512
Barzillai was 17.

268
00:16:50,158 --> 00:16:52,059
Orphans. Grew up on the wharf.

269
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,512
Both in a hurry to be called men.

270
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:00,007
Grubs.

271
00:17:00,738 --> 00:17:02,255
What are those pins they are wearing?

272
00:17:02,428 --> 00:17:03,918
They are whale pins Thomas.

273
00:17:04,496 --> 00:17:05,895
How do I get one of them?

274
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,488
Well you got to thrust the killing lance

275
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,941
into the largest beast that
ever breathed on this Earth.

276
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,096
Nickerson get the green stuff
to Mr. Bond there.

277
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,846
Make it quick damn it.

278
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,243
I shall have 12 of those one day.

279
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,962
Windlass is ready
and sails are loose sir.

280
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,215
Mr. Joy this is only half my order!

281
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,695
Put them over the ground tier casks.

282
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,399
Well, well, you being on board
means only one thing.

283
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:34,321
Yeah. at least there is one person on this
ship who knows the truth about Owen Chase.

284
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,907
No that all the other ships
have already crewed up.

285
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,953
Now, now.

286
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,820
I am a reformed man Owen.

287
00:17:40,484 --> 00:17:41,878
Question is are you?

288
00:17:41,903 --> 00:17:44,135
Don't tell me Matthew Joy's
put down the bottle.

289
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,707
Dry as sand.

290
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,887
Has Owen Chase put down his temper?

291
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,621
Serene as the church.

292
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,887
I will believe that when I see it.

293
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,074
And given our captain

294
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,563
I will give your serenity about...

295
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,300
48 hours?

296
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:00,567
Good luck.

297
00:18:06,774 --> 00:18:08,594
Pollard. George Pollard.

298
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:09,782
Owen Chase.

299
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,245
Chase.

300
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,258
That's an off island name isn't it?

301
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,665
Yes it is.

302
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,951
And very shortly we will be
off island for some time

303
00:18:17,976 --> 00:18:19,341
and I will be very much at home.

304
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,154
Must say I was surprised.

305
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,281
Normally a captain gets
to choose his first mate.

306
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,650
An experienced captain, yes.

307
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,853
Of course you can understand
from the owners' point of view

308
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,201
they want to feel their investment's
in the hands of men.

309
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:34,657
Indeed.

310
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,336
They probably want a little
extra reassurance that's all.

311
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,945
Well do keep an eye on me and let me
know if I am doing anything wrong.

312
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,525
Oh, I know no other way Captain.

313
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:56,272
Mr. Chase haul short the anchor.

314
00:18:56,297 --> 00:18:57,935
Yank to the wind! There is top men aloft.

315
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,564
Aye!
Mr. Lawrence take the helm.

316
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:01,114
Aye sir.
Mr. Joy make sail.

317
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,552
Mr. Cole! Mr. Chappel!
Stand by the spanker.

318
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:06,404
Set your fore stay sail
and your fore and main topsails.

319
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:07,760
Come on look lively you lads.

320
00:19:07,785 --> 00:19:09,116
Come on Nickerson! While we are young!

321
00:19:09,456 --> 00:19:11,440
Let fall clews and bunts and sheet ho!

322
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:13,183
Set topsails and topgallants.

323
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,378
Heave away on the windlass.
Heave away on the windlass.

324
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,161
Set topgallants.

325
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,412
Let go clew lines and sheet ho!

326
00:19:22,437 --> 00:19:24,402
There is a snarl in the gasket sir.

327
00:19:24,475 --> 00:19:26,129
Mr. Chappel take the helm.

328
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,324
It won't clear Mr. Chase!

329
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,698
Come on!

330
00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:31,709
Why are not those braces laid out?

331
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,781
Mr. Ray where are my headsails?

332
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:35,967
Aye sir!

333
00:19:36,623 --> 00:19:38,170
Crank away on the windlass!

334
00:19:38,287 --> 00:19:40,042
Crank away on the windlass sir!

335
00:19:40,901 --> 00:19:42,255
Nickerson pull!

336
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:47,850
Make sail God damn it!

337
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,405
God and all of Nantucket is watching men.

338
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,419
Anchor's trim!

339
00:19:56,892 --> 00:19:59,599
Captain! Head down!
Mind your head Captain.

340
00:20:03,005 --> 00:20:04,274
What's the matter Mr. Sheppard?

341
00:20:04,298 --> 00:20:05,997
Gasket has fouled the sheet sir.

342
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:07,831
It won't clear Mr. Chase!

343
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,524
Topgallant sheet is jammed!

344
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:11,031
The gasket still won't clear!

345
00:20:12,274 --> 00:20:14,236
We don't have enough sail on yet.

346
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,788
Still won't clear!

347
00:20:21,948 --> 00:20:23,046
Watch your step!

348
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,405
It's the gasket Owen!

349
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:38,262
Stand clear.

350
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:46,519
Bloody hell!

351
00:20:46,731 --> 00:20:48,779
Let fall your course!
Heave!

352
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,418
Make fast!

353
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:07,479
Nice piece of work Mr. Chase.

354
00:21:20,606 --> 00:21:22,495
If we make Cape Verdes
in the next 2 weeks

355
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,062
we will have a decent chance
of reaching the Pacific on schedule.

356
00:21:28,243 --> 00:21:29,505
Corn Mr. Chase?

357
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,331
Oh no thank you sir.

358
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,013
Never did have much of a taste for it.

359
00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:35,427
That's odd.

360
00:21:36,606 --> 00:21:38,734
Told your father grew corn on Cape Cod.

361
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,995
That's right. He did.

362
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,277
As you can imagine I certainly
grew tired of eating it every day.

363
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,058
Corn.

364
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:50,016
Okra. Beans I believe?

365
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,266
Before he went to jail.

366
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,415
Are you familiar with this story Mr. Joy?

367
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,133
Sir?

368
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,381
Were you aware that...

369
00:22:00,881 --> 00:22:02,517
Mr. Chase was effectively orphaned,

370
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,188
due to his father's incarceration?

371
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:05,395
Well we all have...

372
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:07,599
we all have our own paths to sea.

373
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,126
As a rule we tend
not to ask too many questions.

374
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,405
Can't have been easy though.

375
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,465
Yet

376
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,332
you had Nantucket's great seafaring family
to adopt you.

377
00:22:20,308 --> 00:22:23,168
This is far from the first time I have been
called a landsman...

378
00:22:23,614 --> 00:22:27,000
or an offislander by some
Nantucketer reminding me how I am not,

379
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:28,812
a part of that family.

380
00:22:30,732 --> 00:22:34,533
Now if the Captain will excuse me there
are whaleboats and watches to assign.

381
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,364
No sir. Not for me.

382
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,893
Not a drop?

383
00:22:45,026 --> 00:22:45,872
No sir.

384
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:47,479
Like I said...

385
00:22:48,455 --> 00:22:50,722
sometimes the fewer questions,
one asks the better.

386
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,961
Serve that food up.

387
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,938
Getting this slop on the first day?

388
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,845
Cheap bastards. Where is the meat?

389
00:23:10,564 --> 00:23:11,850
That's a gorgeous girl Mr. Chappel.

390
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,810
A vision of beauty that.
Carved on a varnished whale bone.

391
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,924
Let me have a touch.

392
00:23:16,276 --> 00:23:17,243
Don't touch.

393
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,975
I thought you were married anyway.

394
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,490
I am and there she is.

395
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,723
Well...

396
00:23:23,217 --> 00:23:24,834
that's her nose anyway.

397
00:23:25,475 --> 00:23:27,381
Congratulations ladies.

398
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:32,128
That was a fine job trimming sails today.

399
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,769
A sorrier pack of deck wallopers
I don't think I have ever seen.

400
00:23:38,214 --> 00:23:39,182
Mr. Chappel.

401
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:39,990
Sir!

402
00:23:40,264 --> 00:23:41,443
You are Captain's harpooner.

403
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,909
Mr. Lawrence,

404
00:23:43,313 --> 00:23:44,276
you will be mine.

405
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:45,432
Aye sir.

406
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,878
And Mr. Peterson.

407
00:23:48,376 --> 00:23:49,844
Second mate's harpooner.

408
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,361
Aye sir.

409
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,087
There will be 6 men to a boat.

410
00:23:53,379 --> 00:23:55,666
First drills are tomorrow.
6 bells sharp.

411
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,452
We are not even east of Halifax, sir.

412
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,681
What's your name?

413
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,511
Coffin.

414
00:24:01,925 --> 00:24:02,960
Henry Coffin.

415
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,850
He is the Captain's cousin sir.

416
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,446
Well, well, Mr. Coffin.

417
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,954
You think a whale knows
if it's east of Halifax?

418
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,234
I don't know who all of you are,

419
00:24:16,508 --> 00:24:17,661
or how you got here.

420
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:21,066
Some of you probably have felonies
to hide and you are on the run.

421
00:24:21,457 --> 00:24:22,395
That's fine.

422
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,633
I don't give a damn.

423
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,452
But in return you exist for one thing,

424
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,556
and one thing only.

425
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,891
And that is whale oil.

426
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,627
I intend to fill our 2000 barrels,

427
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:35,363
and be home as quickly as possible.

428
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,718
And even when the weather is fine
and there are no whales Mr. Coffin

429
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,375
we will lower the boats
and practice all maneuvers

430
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,500
necessary in the capture of a whale.

431
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,302
And any man who is idle
will find himself swimming home.

432
00:24:46,327 --> 00:24:47,328
Is that understood?

433
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,441
Aye sir.

434
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,458
Sir.

435
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:54,380
Greenhorn.

436
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,489
On deck.

437
00:24:59,795 --> 00:25:00,669
On you go.

438
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,650
Aye, aye, landsman.

439
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,329
Thomas Nickerson right?
Aye sir.

440
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:11,236
You know some feel sick at first.

441
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,410
Please, pull me back up!

442
00:25:16,435 --> 00:25:18,777
Best way to square it
with King Neptune boy!

443
00:25:18,802 --> 00:25:20,042
Please bring me up!

444
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:25,908
Better now?

445
00:25:28,618 --> 00:25:29,650
Shit.

446
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,605
Sir I am so sorry.

447
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,813
Well,

448
00:25:35,235 --> 00:25:37,368
now you got something
to write home to your mother about.

449
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,305
My mother is buried up in Smith's Hill.

450
00:25:45,084 --> 00:25:47,014
There is a stone for my father too, he was...

451
00:25:47,266 --> 00:25:49,427
He was lost at sea before I was born.

452
00:25:51,276 --> 00:25:52,303
Here give me that.

453
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,422
Well this is your family now boy.

454
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,321
For better or for worse.

455
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,782
Worse mostly.

456
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,061
Swab the deck kid.

457
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,696
Dogwatch!

458
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,228
You are gonna learn
what it takes to be whalers today mates.

459
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,642
Aye sir!
Aye sir!

460
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,401
You led that line wrong Nickerson.
Aye sir.

461
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,415
We will stay at this
till sundown if we have to.

462
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,658
Aye Mr. Joy sir!

463
00:26:34,683 --> 00:26:36,243
Main topsail leech lines!

464
00:26:36,347 --> 00:26:37,885
Harpooner make ready to boat!

465
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,160
Aye sir!
Aye Mr. Joy!

466
00:26:39,185 --> 00:26:40,710
Go main topsail leech lines.

467
00:26:40,757 --> 00:26:42,411
Too slow you damn coofs!

468
00:26:42,864 --> 00:26:44,001
The bailing piggins.

469
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,044
You will learn every inch of this ship

470
00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:47,794
before you return to your bunks.
Aye sir!

471
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,409
Sweat that line Barz.

472
00:26:54,018 --> 00:26:55,935
You need to move quicker Mr. Ray.
Aye Mr. Chase.

473
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,026
Ain't no greenhorns no more Mr. Chase.

474
00:26:59,545 --> 00:27:01,224
You are a sailor now!

475
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,722
Not bad Mr. Ray. Well done.

476
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,715
Forecourse bunts!
Aye sir.

477
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,239
Get used to it lads.
You are gonna work like horses.

478
00:27:11,277 --> 00:27:12,278
Mr. Chase?

479
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,676
Sir.

480
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,961
Set stunsails.

481
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,994
Is that wise sir?
We are nearing the Gulf Stream.

482
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,087
Best keep it 5 knots
till we can see the weather.

483
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,783
We are 2 days behind.

484
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,869
We need to make up the time
if we are to catch the easterlies.

485
00:27:27,489 --> 00:27:28,929
Set stunsails.

486
00:27:34,405 --> 00:27:35,895
Set stunsails.
Aye Mr. Chase!

487
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,851
Come on, move.

488
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:39,013
Belay that! Set stunsails!

489
00:27:39,677 --> 00:27:41,164
Get aloft Mr. Coffin.

490
00:27:41,189 --> 00:27:42,795
The captain wants speed.
Aye sir.

491
00:27:43,516 --> 00:27:44,881
Look for braces lads.

492
00:27:44,906 --> 00:27:46,206
Trim for speed.
Aye sir.

493
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,821
Set fore the main topsail

494
00:27:47,845 --> 00:27:49,952
and topgallant stunsails men.
Move it.

495
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,402
Make fast your stunsail halyard.

496
00:27:54,427 --> 00:27:56,207
Make fast stunsail halyard sir.

497
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,855
Stunsail boom ready sir!

498
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,770
Bracing fore topsail sir.

499
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,805
Hey!

500
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,506
The captain's got us moving now!
We are finally getting somewhere!

501
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,264
She may be old
but she can still roll boys!

502
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,810
Sir a squall on the starboard bow.

503
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,613
We must shorten sail immediately.

504
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,963
Not just yet Mr. Chase.

505
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,487
Sir we are headed into a squall
at more than 8 knots

506
00:28:46,512 --> 00:28:47,843
and it's moving faster than that.

507
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,090
Let it come.

508
00:28:49,114 --> 00:28:50,658
The men are soft from months on land.

509
00:28:50,683 --> 00:28:53,331
They need a good baptism.
Let them know our work has begun.

510
00:28:56,511 --> 00:28:59,515
If we don't shorten sail and bear off
it will catch us on the beam.

511
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,602
Mr. Chase...

512
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:02,769
we will stand on.

513
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,079
Mr. Lawrence?

514
00:29:04,794 --> 00:29:05,795
Hold our course.

515
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,126
Holding course sir.

516
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:08,943
We will lose half a day running
like that.

517
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:10,579
We will skirt the edge of it.

518
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,644
If the men can't handle a gust like this
then God help us all.

519
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,204
Best secure for heavy weather.

520
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,850
Rough weather coming up boys.

521
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,171
Get this deck secure.

522
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,694
Double gripes on the boats!

523
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,124
Best prepare for weather Mr. Bond.

524
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,544
We are headed into a squall.

525
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,443
Secure the main hatch!

526
00:29:50,974 --> 00:29:52,138
She is moving fast!

527
00:30:07,716 --> 00:30:09,684
We must fall off and run with it.

528
00:30:09,997 --> 00:30:11,867
We will stand on Mr. Chase.

529
00:30:11,975 --> 00:30:13,093
Mr. Lawrence!

530
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,384
Hold your course!

531
00:30:14,572 --> 00:30:16,099
Holding course, sir.

532
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,243
Sea is coming aboard!

533
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,407
Hold on!

534
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,148
Shorten sail Mr. Chase!

535
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,030
Climb to weather and grab the shrouds!

536
00:30:36,054 --> 00:30:37,046
Climb to weather!

537
00:30:37,071 --> 00:30:38,601
Get to windward and hold on!

538
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,578
We need to get those sails down!

539
00:30:41,602 --> 00:30:43,088
Go now!

540
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,773
Nickerson hold fast!

541
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,725
Hold steady lines!

542
00:30:57,916 --> 00:30:59,156
Hold fast!

543
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:01,002
Turn the ship!

544
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,655
Turn to leeward!

545
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,512
No! The damage is done!

546
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,091
Strike topgallants. Let fly sheets!
No turn the ship!

547
00:31:07,219 --> 00:31:08,869
Veer off Mr. Lawrence.

548
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,369
It's too late! It's too goddamn late!

549
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,522
We will be broadsided!
Turn this ship!

550
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,908
Hold on!
Turn!

551
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,560
Strike those damn topgallants!

552
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,750
Hold on!

553
00:32:03,613 --> 00:32:04,594
Look out!

554
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,525
Mr. Joy!

555
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,134
We have to cut away the topgallants!
Topgallants away!

556
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,743
We have to get her upright!

557
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,082
You wish to see me sir?

558
00:33:30,388 --> 00:33:31,878
At 6 bells tomorrow

559
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,306
you will assemble the crew.

560
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,314
Inform them that we will be returning
to Nantucket for repairs.

561
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,335
You will then apologize to them
for interfering with a captain's order

562
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,174
which nearly cost the lives
of every man on this ship today.

563
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,415
What?

564
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,869
I will accept your resignation
upon our return to port.

565
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:50,618
That will be all.

566
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,187
It was your order to set stunsails sir.
That decision was sound.

567
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:55,733
The men needed testing.

568
00:33:55,758 --> 00:33:57,523
So you send them into a storm?
That...

569
00:33:58,501 --> 00:33:59,462
was unlucky.

570
00:33:59,487 --> 00:34:01,312
No it was bad seamanship.

571
00:34:01,418 --> 00:34:03,738
And blaming misfortune
is just plain weakness.

572
00:34:03,966 --> 00:34:05,465
Damn your impertinence!

573
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,598
Do you know who you are speaking to?

574
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,646
My name is Captain George Pollard.

575
00:34:11,386 --> 00:34:12,387
Pollard!

576
00:34:15,201 --> 00:34:17,775
And you Mr. Chase
no matter how many whale pins

577
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,087
you may have on your lapel,

578
00:34:19,337 --> 00:34:21,470
are nothing more than
the son of a farmer,

579
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,689
who is managed to bully his way
into an officer's tunic.

580
00:34:26,346 --> 00:34:27,453
Now get out.

581
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,516
To return to port without a single
barrel of oil would be a mistake sir.

582
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,561
And not behoove a man
whose name is Pollard.

583
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,461
Or Chase for that matter.

584
00:34:41,602 --> 00:34:45,171
And the best thing for both of us
would be to work all hours God sends us

585
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,485
fill this ship with oil
and be home inside a year

586
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,825
and rid of one another
as quickly as possible.

587
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,851
Trust me I am every bit
as desirous of that as you.

588
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,768
Of course that is a captain's decision.

589
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,023
They were like an ill married couple.

590
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,204
An ill married couple
will tolerate each other Mr. Melville.

591
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,204
But an ill married couple
can also bring down a ship.

592
00:35:24,557 --> 00:35:25,967
Are you married Mr. Melville?

593
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,864
I am.

594
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,444
God have mercy on you.

595
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,214
First child on the way too.

596
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,222
So does your good wife
know that you have brought

597
00:35:34,247 --> 00:35:36,454
all you have in the world here tonight

598
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,925
and given it to a stranger?

599
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,441
No sir.

600
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,446
You are full of surprises are not you?

601
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,391
So...

602
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,217
The Essex did not return to...

603
00:35:48,342 --> 00:35:49,349
to port.

604
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:50,936
She did not.

605
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,722
She continued out to sea.

606
00:35:52,746 --> 00:35:53,967
Yes she did.

607
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,558
And before long,

608
00:35:56,146 --> 00:35:57,019
we heard that...

609
00:35:57,183 --> 00:35:59,449
call that all whalemen pray for.

610
00:36:00,777 --> 00:36:01,841
Blows.

611
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,329
Blows!

612
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,107
To windward!

613
00:36:07,154 --> 00:36:08,804
There she blows!

614
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,739
Right or sperm Mr. Ramsdell?

615
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,411
Sperm whales they are!

616
00:36:13,436 --> 00:36:15,078
There go the flukes!

617
00:36:15,103 --> 00:36:16,229
Mr. Chase!

618
00:36:16,453 --> 00:36:17,960
Hoist and swing boats.

619
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,429
All hands! All hands on deck!

620
00:36:20,701 --> 00:36:22,499
All hands on deck!

621
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,241
Away the boats.

622
00:36:29,342 --> 00:36:30,522
Lower away!

623
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,870
Straight!

624
00:36:58,401 --> 00:37:00,299
Crack them backbones.
Aye sir!

625
00:37:01,034 --> 00:37:02,240
Give way all.

626
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:04,893
Spring those oars till your arms fall off.

627
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,798
There they breach!

628
00:37:11,008 --> 00:37:12,176
Thataway boys!

629
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,360
Full pressure!

630
00:37:13,385 --> 00:37:14,615
Aye sir!

631
00:37:14,694 --> 00:37:15,638
Come on!

632
00:37:15,974 --> 00:37:17,467
Put your back into it.

633
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,147
Pull!

634
00:37:21,268 --> 00:37:22,662
Pull like a vengeance!

635
00:37:22,687 --> 00:37:24,177
There she blows!

636
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,459
That's a calf.

637
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,201
That's the calf?

638
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,881
That's the cow.

639
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,253
And that's our boy!

640
00:37:47,277 --> 00:37:48,525
That's the money.

641
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,879
Nickerson push!
Sorry sir.

642
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,574
40barreler?

643
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,841
50.

644
00:37:54,957 --> 00:37:56,418
Oh he is a buster!

645
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,769
Bite the oars lads.

646
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,290
Blister your goddamn lungs!

647
00:38:01,637 --> 00:38:02,923
Full pressure!

648
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,204
Smartly lads! Smartly!

649
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,087
Mind your oars!

650
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,486
Mr. Ramsdell prepare the line.
Aye sir.

651
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,236
Mr. Lawrence the first one is mine.

652
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,845
Take me to the pretty spot.

653
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,495
Pull!

654
00:38:21,862 --> 00:38:23,444
Come on. Stay on him.

655
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,142
You are on your first
Nantucket sleigh ride boy.

656
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,651
Oh my God!

657
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,413
Look at him!

658
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,202
The most fearsome creature
ever to live on this Earth.

659
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,145
He sounds.

660
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,681
My hands!

661
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,608
We need to wet the line Nickerson.

662
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,568
Give way lads. Give way.

663
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,210
Got 140 fathoms of line left Mr. Chase.

664
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,323
80 fathoms of line left sir!

665
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,237
He is gonna pull us under!

666
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,065
Matthew I need your line!

667
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,366
Keep going!

668
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,652
Peterson give me the line.
Aye sir.

669
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,809
Give me that line Mr. Peterson.

670
00:40:10,834 --> 00:40:13,105
We are down to 60 fathoms of line left sir!

671
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,866
20 fathoms Mr. Chase.
Tie it off!

672
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,452
Safe!
Go!

673
00:40:36,853 --> 00:40:38,548
Peterson lay out.
Aye sir.

674
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,563
How many fathoms can he go?

675
00:40:42,498 --> 00:40:44,110
70 fathoms left sir.

676
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,081
No, no, no, wait.

677
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,201
Owen!
No, no! Not yet!

678
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,885
Don't touch that line!

679
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,941
Down to 50 fathoms sir.

680
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,660
Owen God damn it!

681
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,363
I said don't touch it!

682
00:41:04,388 --> 00:41:06,320
30 fathoms left Mr. Joy.

683
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,210
10 fathoms left sir!

684
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,077
Backwater!

685
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,937
Push!

686
00:41:58,171 --> 00:42:00,015
Chimney was afire!

687
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,676
Chimney was afire!

688
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,689
Afire!

689
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,074
Hurry it along lads.

690
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,691
God! Get out you bastards.

691
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,345
Blubber in the oil.

692
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:58,481
Smell that boys!

693
00:42:58,715 --> 00:43:00,087
That's us making money!

694
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,329
Get out of there you sons of bitches.

695
00:43:05,595 --> 00:43:07,694
There you got it?
There is not a chance.

696
00:43:11,898 --> 00:43:13,662
How is it looking?
It's not good.

697
00:43:15,835 --> 00:43:16,953
That's it.

698
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,213
Mr. Chase sir.

699
00:43:22,775 --> 00:43:23,617
Yeah?

700
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,207
That's all of it sir.

701
00:43:25,231 --> 00:43:26,453
We can't get any more out.

702
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,976
That's the gold in there boys.
Come on keep digging.

703
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,891
We are too big to wriggle down there.

704
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,548
Then find someone who can.

705
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,055
Nickerson! Come here boy.

706
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,575
Hey!

707
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:44,954
I said come here.

708
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,246
Climb on into him.

709
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,160
Come on Thomas.

710
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,845
What's in there is worth a hell of a lot
more than what they are boiling down.

711
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,561
Sir!

712
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,806
I can't I am...

713
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,256
I am sorry. I can't.

714
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,061
You get down there
or I will have you sleep down there.

715
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,827
You best put that between your teeth boy.

716
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,022
Stinks worse than
the devil's asshole down there.

717
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:21,772
Thanks.

718
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,287
Sorry.

719
00:44:28,312 --> 00:44:30,777
Here Nickerson, take my pillow with you.

720
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,801
Down you go.

721
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,322
A man gets to know himself down there.

722
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,833
They ever send you into a whale's head?
No.

723
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,236
I was spared.

724
00:45:01,873 --> 00:45:02,563
Well,

725
00:45:02,813 --> 00:45:04,263
that's where the treasure is.

726
00:45:06,299 --> 00:45:08,338
I will never forget that first bull.

727
00:45:10,401 --> 00:45:11,908
47 barrels.

728
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,940
Of course, the happiness was short lived.

729
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,641
The waters there had all been fished out?

730
00:45:17,768 --> 00:45:18,843
That they had.

731
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:20,622
So,

732
00:45:21,356 --> 00:45:22,898
we headed further out.

733
00:45:25,226 --> 00:45:26,148
Yeah.

734
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,607
Took us a month to round the Horn.

735
00:45:30,826 --> 00:45:33,826
Left the South Atlantic behind
with a sliver of hope

736
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,107
that things could change for the better.

737
00:45:38,182 --> 00:45:40,932
But making the Pacific
didn't improve our lot.

738
00:45:43,785 --> 00:45:46,072
Whale sightings were too damn scarce.

739
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,664
After nearly a year at sea...

740
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,641
the temperaments of our captain
and first mate grew more strained.

741
00:45:56,952 --> 00:45:59,827
Captain Pollard spent most
days and nights in his cabin

742
00:46:00,886 --> 00:46:02,570
afraid to look his crew in the eye.

743
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,271
Our hold was almost empty.

744
00:46:11,755 --> 00:46:14,123
And to gaze upon our paltry efforts

745
00:46:14,781 --> 00:46:16,740
only served as a reminder,

746
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,488
that we were a long way from going home.

747
00:46:43,959 --> 00:46:45,380
I don't talk that talk.

748
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,974
Speak English.
Offer me more.

749
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,263
Here sir.
This Nantucket whale oil.

750
00:46:53,721 --> 00:46:55,947
Ain't no skinny hog worth more than that.
More!

751
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:49,813
Capitan.

752
00:47:50,298 --> 00:47:51,128
Excuse me.

753
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,567
The locals told me your voyage
was waylaid sir.

754
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,924
Captain George Pollard. The Essex.

755
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,405
Capitan Clemente Pelaez,

756
00:47:58,741 --> 00:47:59,793
the Santa Maria.

757
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:02,561
Would you buy a colleague a drink?

758
00:48:09,251 --> 00:48:10,449
No, no.

759
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,045
Bad luck?

760
00:48:14,121 --> 00:48:15,066
How far out?

761
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,290
Far enough for only a fool to go.

762
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,337
How far would that be?

763
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:23,665
A thousand leagues along the equator.

764
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,321
The Offshore Grounds.

765
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,090
Were there whales there?

766
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,529
More than you have ever dreamed.

767
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:33,740
Hundreds.

768
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,881
Fields of flukes far as the eye can see.

769
00:48:37,211 --> 00:48:40,371
Could have filled up 3000 barrels
in the space of a day.

770
00:48:40,442 --> 00:48:41,648
What do you mean could have?

771
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,704
If it were not for that...

772
00:48:48,072 --> 00:48:48,911
demon.

773
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,587
A whale.

774
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,923
White as alabaster.

775
00:48:55,194 --> 00:48:56,720
Hundred feet long.

776
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,514
Sent 6 of my crew to their graves.

777
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,121
And the rest of us
something...

778
00:49:11,441 --> 00:49:12,809
to remember him by.

779
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,641
Now this white whale did he dance
a jig and pick your pocket as well?

780
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,247
Gracias.

781
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,345
You believe that?

782
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,917
If we set sail now,

783
00:49:34,445 --> 00:49:37,087
catch the south easterlies
at their best time

784
00:49:37,111 --> 00:49:39,687
and fill our belly
we could be home in six months.

785
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,476
What say you Mr. Chase?

786
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,336
No need to endure our predicament
for a moment longer than necessary.

787
00:49:46,443 --> 00:49:47,508
Amen to that.

788
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:49,732
Amen.

789
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,568
Greed took hold
of our captain and first mate.

790
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,419
So we headed out.

791
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,325
A thousand leagues along the equator.

792
00:50:00,502 --> 00:50:01,737
Where knowledge ended,

793
00:50:02,862 --> 00:50:04,361
speculation began.

794
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,753
That's where the whales had gone to hide.

795
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,511
As far from man as they could possibly go.

796
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,924
But we hunted them down.

797
00:50:14,214 --> 00:50:15,542
Centuries before,

798
00:50:16,034 --> 00:50:18,652
sailors feared sailing
off the edge of the Earth.

799
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,930
But we were headed for the edge of sanity.

800
00:50:27,594 --> 00:50:29,403
Trust gave way to doubt.

801
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,904
Hope to blind superstition.

802
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,603
Captain,

803
00:50:34,939 --> 00:50:35,998
the men are talking.

804
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,041
That's what men do.

805
00:50:38,365 --> 00:50:40,811
They are not happy with your decision
to sail out this far.

806
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,472
Well did you correct them?

807
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,206
Did you remind them of our purpose
to fill this ship with whale oil

808
00:50:47,231 --> 00:50:50,183
and if the whales are 1000 leagues out
that that is where we will go?

809
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:50,994
Cousin...

810
00:50:51,605 --> 00:50:52,368
please.

811
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,532
This is madness.

812
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,907
You have let yourself
be influenced by that man.

813
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,735
You must turn this ship back.

814
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,508
I suggest...

815
00:51:04,858 --> 00:51:06,131
you go back down

816
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,344
reassure the men...

817
00:51:07,859 --> 00:51:08,512
be...

818
00:51:08,714 --> 00:51:09,616
a leader

819
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,306
and don't ever...

820
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,481
ever abuse the privilege
of family with me again.

821
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,715
Mr. Coffin.

822
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,041
What is it?

823
00:51:50,113 --> 00:51:50,761
Listen.

824
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:51,888
Mr. Chase?

825
00:51:52,097 --> 00:51:53,363
I see some white water.

826
00:51:53,388 --> 00:51:55,207
Where?
Portside!

827
00:51:55,244 --> 00:51:56,754
We are away!
Portside Captain!

828
00:51:56,779 --> 00:51:58,720
Where are they?
You see anything?

829
00:52:06,005 --> 00:52:07,270
Lower away!

830
00:52:07,297 --> 00:52:08,905
Lower away!

831
00:52:08,929 --> 00:52:10,918
Lower away!

832
00:52:11,645 --> 00:52:13,590
The devil take the Mexican grounds!

833
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,521
Peak oars!

834
00:52:55,411 --> 00:52:57,300
Give it to him, Mr. Chappel!

835
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,705
Stick him man! Stick him!

836
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,666
Dead ahead Peterson!

837
00:53:18,472 --> 00:53:20,226
Don't let him chew your oars boys.

838
00:53:20,766 --> 00:53:21,839
Back to it.

839
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:46,795
The whale?

840
00:53:47,319 --> 00:53:48,131
Yes.

841
00:53:49,186 --> 00:53:49,993
So it's true?

842
00:53:50,173 --> 00:53:50,965
Yes.

843
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,387
Too much is true.

844
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:55,755
Get it up!

845
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,210
Full pressure!

846
00:54:28,156 --> 00:54:29,215
Mr. Bond!

847
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,697
Back the foreyard lower the tackle!

848
00:54:31,722 --> 00:54:32,603
Aye sir!

849
00:54:33,641 --> 00:54:35,775
Here she comes Peterson. Now! Now!

850
00:54:49,667 --> 00:54:50,567
Mr. Lawrence,

851
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,988
take us leeward
head us straight for the school.

852
00:54:53,013 --> 00:54:53,849
Aye sir.

853
00:54:53,984 --> 00:54:56,146
Hot tar sir.
We will find him.

854
00:55:01,305 --> 00:55:02,670
We are boat to black skin.

855
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,602
Beach us on her!

856
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:16,026
She is ours men!

857
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,643
What was that Mr. Lawrence?

858
00:55:54,315 --> 00:55:55,346
Mr. Chase!

859
00:56:03,842 --> 00:56:05,030
God damn it.

860
00:56:05,951 --> 00:56:06,943
Find Mr...

861
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,171
Mr. Easton!

862
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,826
Get Mr. Lawrence to man the pumps!

863
00:56:53,412 --> 00:56:54,413
Where is he?

864
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,466
Port bow!

865
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,167
Get me the biggest irons we have.

866
00:57:13,977 --> 00:57:15,103
He wants a fight?

867
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,603
Never seen a whale do that.

868
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,015
Mr. Lawrence take the wheel.

869
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,059
Mr. Ramsdell,

870
00:57:29,083 --> 00:57:31,394
secure the other end of the line
to the foremast.

871
00:57:31,418 --> 00:57:32,149
Aye sir.

872
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,563
As I live and breathe,

873
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:35,336
he is mine.

874
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,402
Cut the line!
Look out!

875
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,926
Captain!
What?

876
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,169
The Essex!

877
00:59:19,504 --> 00:59:20,614
She is listing.

878
00:59:32,165 --> 00:59:33,782
Turn this boat around!

879
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,135
Help me!
Nickerson!

880
01:00:11,205 --> 01:00:12,570
Mr. Joy!
Here!

881
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,965
Give me your hand!
Help!

882
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:15,116
Nickerson!

883
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,566
Mr. Chase!

884
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,285
A whale sir.

885
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,010
It stove the ship.

886
01:00:58,854 --> 01:00:59,837
What?

887
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,227
We lost Easton and Sanborn.

888
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,765
The pumps are useless sir.

889
01:01:14,302 --> 01:01:15,792
Prepare to abandon ship.

890
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,371
We can't row our way home.

891
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,775
We will have to strip her of her sails

892
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,410
and jimmyrig something.
Aye sir.

893
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,675
Gather as much food
and water as you can carry.

894
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,327
We are gonna need
all the fresh water you can find.

895
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,289
Nickerson you grab as much as you can.

896
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,571
Barz come with me.

897
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,485
Sweet Lord!

898
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,030
First the sails, then the provisions.

899
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,725
Get as much food as you can carry lad.

900
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:45,946
Make haste boys!

901
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,845
Nickerson there are
more casks in steerage.

902
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,028
Got it?

903
01:01:50,067 --> 01:01:51,407
Hardtack is dry.

904
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,173
Move sprightly gentlemen.

905
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,415
Lower away!

906
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,908
Take those tack lines.

907
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:56,965
Up aloft!

908
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:59,127
Lower away! Bring it down!
Mr. Cole get that yard down.

909
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,482
Bring it down. Keep it coming!

910
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:02,873
Hold off!

911
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,770
Come on Nickerson!
Get those sails!

912
01:02:15,158 --> 01:02:16,239
There you go.

913
01:02:19,004 --> 01:02:20,345
Get that yard down!

914
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,895
We need the sails.

915
01:02:24,379 --> 01:02:25,541
Not enough water.

916
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,152
Get the barrels now!

917
01:02:33,445 --> 01:02:34,606
Strip that rigging!

918
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,046
More fresh water!
More hardtack! Come on!

919
01:02:37,106 --> 01:02:38,875
I can see more casks in the steerage!

920
01:02:40,242 --> 01:02:41,735
Benjamin! Quick! Come on!

921
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,886
Give me your hand!
Get him up.

922
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,166
I got you.

923
01:02:44,449 --> 01:02:45,655
Hardtack!

924
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,516
Come on! Move it!

925
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,141
Step lively Mr. Nickerson!

926
01:02:56,598 --> 01:02:58,100
Gotta get away from the oil!

927
01:02:58,125 --> 01:03:00,495
She is going down! She is listing!
Where is Owen?

928
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,140
Nickerson where is Mr. Chase?

929
01:03:02,165 --> 01:03:03,621
He was just here sir.

930
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,103
Come on hurry up!

931
01:03:05,127 --> 01:03:06,082
Owen!

932
01:03:06,107 --> 01:03:07,613
Mr. Chase!
We got to shove off!

933
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,607
Come on now boys!

934
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:10,872
Oil on deck!

935
01:03:12,428 --> 01:03:14,348
Captain!
Mr. Chase!

936
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,091
Mr. Chase sir!

937
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,481
Owen!

938
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,497
Where is the first mate?

939
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,974
Owen!
Mr. Chase sir!

940
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,922
Owen!
She is gonna blow!

941
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,289
Owen!
We got to move!

942
01:03:53,314 --> 01:03:55,157
No wait! Wait!

943
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,686
Mr. Chase sir!

944
01:03:58,629 --> 01:03:59,755
Mr. Chase!

945
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,661
There he is!

946
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:47,067
There he is! There he is!

947
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,066
Over here!
Mr. Chase!

948
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,527
Move that!

949
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:56,933
Mr. Chase, sir.

950
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,130
Here!
Get a hold now.

951
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:00,283
We got you.

952
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,121
Sir.
You are alright now Mr. Chase.

953
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,086
Going fishing are we?

954
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,001
Clean and load it Mr. Joy.

955
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,242
Back away,

956
01:05:24,383 --> 01:05:26,048
or she will take us down with her.

957
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:10,976
Captain.

958
01:07:12,253 --> 01:07:13,523
What about our provisions?

959
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,207
2 ounces of hardtack a day per man.

960
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,872
And half a cup of water.

961
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,542
Hey man we can't live on that.

962
01:07:30,698 --> 01:07:32,042
Not for more than a few days.

963
01:07:49,499 --> 01:07:50,467
It's he.

964
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,130
Yeah it's him alright.

965
01:08:00,499 --> 01:08:02,651
You don't fool me Mr. Chase.

966
01:08:03,729 --> 01:08:04,776
Mr. Coffin?

967
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,848
That right?
You put us here.

968
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,828
You know you put us here.

969
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,925
Hey! Put it down!
Mr. Coffin put the pistol down.

970
01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:14,745
Say you are scared!
Mr. Coffin!

971
01:08:14,769 --> 01:08:15,966
Put the pistol down.

972
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:18,372
You know what happens
when the food and water runs out?

973
01:08:18,397 --> 01:08:20,126
Do as the captain says Coffin!

974
01:08:20,168 --> 01:08:21,614
I just wanna see the landsman scared.

975
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:23,744
Mr. Coffin put the pistol down.
That's an order!

976
01:08:23,769 --> 01:08:25,283
Do as the captain says! Now!

977
01:08:25,463 --> 01:08:26,166
Say it!

978
01:08:26,341 --> 01:08:27,342
Henry.
Say it!

979
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,224
Say it!

980
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:30,623
Henry!

981
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,633
Put the pistol down.

982
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,273
Henry!

983
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,640
Put it down.

984
01:09:17,262 --> 01:09:18,673
So east it was.

985
01:09:19,844 --> 01:09:21,613
Back in the direction we had come.

986
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:25,431
Though only the sun
and compass told us so.

987
01:09:26,795 --> 01:09:28,509
All directions looked the same.

988
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,570
Our hope was to catch
the Westerlies to Easter Island.

989
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,236
A journey of 3000 miles.

990
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,540
In 12 days we have drifted south.

991
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,720
6 degrees latitude.

992
01:09:42,858 --> 01:09:45,212
We are not one mile closer
to Easter Island.

993
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,744
We stayed in the same place.

994
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,142
We are cursed.

995
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,002
We will make up for it
when we catch the variables.

996
01:09:58,454 --> 01:09:59,595
We will catch them.

997
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,330
Chappel!

998
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,160
Chappel!

999
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,165
Chappel!

1000
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,423
You have got him Captain!

1001
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:44,237
Mr. Joy the halyard's jammed!

1002
01:10:48,021 --> 01:10:49,024
Mr. Joy!

1003
01:10:49,423 --> 01:10:51,036
You alright Mr. Joy?

1004
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:55,983
Grab the tiller!

1005
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,910
Grab it!
Matthew!

1006
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,125
Get that sail down!

1007
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,569
Matthew.

1008
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:34,965
Hey what happened?

1009
01:11:35,473 --> 01:11:36,589
What happened?

1010
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:37,615
Owen.

1011
01:11:37,787 --> 01:11:38,690
What are you doing here?

1012
01:11:38,715 --> 01:11:40,058
Let me take a look.
No, no, no.

1013
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:41,493
Lay still. Let me take a look.
No!

1014
01:11:41,517 --> 01:11:42,642
Owen I am fine.
Alright. Just relax.

1015
01:11:42,667 --> 01:11:43,368
Relax.
Let me take a look.

1016
01:11:43,393 --> 01:11:44,556
I am fine!
I know. I know.

1017
01:11:44,581 --> 01:11:45,501
I just wanna take a look.

1018
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,427
I banged my head.

1019
01:11:52,087 --> 01:11:53,368
Just a scratch alright?

1020
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:54,860
Just a scratch.
Give him some water.

1021
01:11:54,885 --> 01:11:56,008
I don't need any water!

1022
01:11:56,298 --> 01:11:57,855
Give him some goddamn water!

1023
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,364
No, no, no. I don't need water.
I am fine.

1024
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,103
Yeah.

1025
01:12:08,462 --> 01:12:09,345
Take that. Take it.

1026
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,783
Hey. I got you. I got you.

1027
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:14,234
You are alright.

1028
01:12:14,523 --> 01:12:15,557
You are alright.

1029
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,684
Hey! What are you all looking at?
I am fine.

1030
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,078
Captain Pollard.

1031
01:12:24,469 --> 01:12:25,370
Fit as a fiddle.

1032
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,414
Fit as a goddamned fiddle.

1033
01:12:27,438 --> 01:12:28,259
You hear me?

1034
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,161
Owen.
Yeah.

1035
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:31,384
I am fine.

1036
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,245
Alright? I am fine!

1037
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:35,964
You are a tough son of a bitch.
Thank you. I am fine.

1038
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:37,361
Get out of here.

1039
01:12:38,869 --> 01:12:39,648
He is good.

1040
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:41,890
Let's go.

1041
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,086
Why waste water on a dead man?

1042
01:12:46,844 --> 01:12:48,602
Them two men have known each other,

1043
01:12:49,421 --> 01:12:51,257
sailed together since childhood.

1044
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:52,773
Now tell me,

1045
01:12:53,179 --> 01:12:55,643
could you sit there
and watch your own brother die?

1046
01:12:57,002 --> 01:12:59,482
Simply a matter of numbers Mr. Chappel.

1047
01:13:00,669 --> 01:13:02,390
There is not enough for all of us.

1048
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,771
Why waste water on a dead man?

1049
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:19,520
Why waste water on...

1050
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,760
Why waste water?

1051
01:13:21,784 --> 01:13:23,006
Why waste?

1052
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,723
Why waste water on a dead man?

1053
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,372
Mr. Nickerson?

1054
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,889
Why waste water...
You alright sir?

1055
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,021
I cannot.

1056
01:13:33,408 --> 01:13:34,327
Cannot what?

1057
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,025
No you-you...

1058
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,577
You have enough. You hav...
More than enough.

1059
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:40,335
But sir we have come so far.

1060
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:41,646
We have come to an end.

1061
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,288
We have an agreement sir.

1062
01:13:43,445 --> 01:13:44,734
Take the money and leave!

1063
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,326
The devil's bargain.

1064
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:47,846
No sir.

1065
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,488
The devil loves unspoken secrets.

1066
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,361
Especially those that
fester in a man's soul.

1067
01:13:58,731 --> 01:13:59,781
What's yours?

1068
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:20,725
I am not a great writer.

1069
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,525
I am not Hawthorne.

1070
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,890
But from my first hearing of it this...

1071
01:14:30,106 --> 01:14:31,562
this tale has haunted me.

1072
01:14:33,801 --> 01:14:34,937
It consumes me.

1073
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,309
I fear if I do not write it

1074
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,007
then I should never write again.

1075
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,726
What else?

1076
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:48,476
I fear if I do write it...

1077
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,654
that it will not be
as good as it should be.

1078
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,050
Continue the story sir.

1079
01:15:06,665 --> 01:15:07,761
For the both of us.

1080
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,076
Pass that down.

1081
01:15:31,314 --> 01:15:32,373
Thank you sir.

1082
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,805
We thank you Lord for this is our food.

1083
01:15:41,205 --> 01:15:42,574
I am sorry.

1084
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,608
For life and health

1085
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,566
and every good.

1086
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,666
Let all manner to...
Land.

1087
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,330
Land!

1088
01:15:51,795 --> 01:15:53,638
Land! Land!
Land!

1089
01:15:54,496 --> 01:15:57,220
Land!
Land!

1090
01:15:57,245 --> 01:15:58,208
Oars!

1091
01:15:58,552 --> 01:16:00,176
Give way! Give way!

1092
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,921
Oars now! Give way!

1093
01:16:03,273 --> 01:16:04,612
Row!

1094
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:14,167
I saw it Mr. Chase.
That you did boy.

1095
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,869
Hold fast. Hold fast! Hold fast!

1096
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:29,990
Mr. Chase sir. What is it?

1097
01:16:30,014 --> 01:16:31,203
Mr. Chase!

1098
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:34,008
What the devil is it?
Why have you stopped?

1099
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,491
He is been following us!

1100
01:16:35,659 --> 01:16:37,375
What?
What is he talking about?

1101
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:39,716
There is nothing out there Mr. Chase!

1102
01:16:39,741 --> 01:16:41,251
There ain't nothing out there sir!

1103
01:16:41,275 --> 01:16:42,544
Sir what are you doing?

1104
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,480
Brace! Brace! Brace!

1105
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,161
No!

1106
01:17:25,743 --> 01:17:26,711
Where is he?

1107
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,404
This could be Ducie Island.

1108
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,932
Without a map compass or quadrant
there is no way to be certain.

1109
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:36,647
We will keep fires going night and day.

1110
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,553
Hope a passing ship,

1111
01:19:38,577 --> 01:19:40,292
catches sight of our smoke.

1112
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,050
This is what I wanted you to see.

1113
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:50,063
They ave been here a long time no doubt.

1114
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,399
Waiting for a ship.

1115
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:54,930
But no ship came.

1116
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,329
No ship is going to come.

1117
01:21:00,521 --> 01:21:02,011
If we stay we die.

1118
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:05,086
How long do you think
it will take the tropic birds

1119
01:21:05,143 --> 01:21:07,544
to stop coming here once
they see their eggs eaten?

1120
01:21:26,828 --> 01:21:29,672
It's a privilege to know
the moment of one is death in advance

1121
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:32,290
be able to prepare for it.

1122
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,926
Curse to be so far from home,

1123
01:21:38,108 --> 01:21:41,841
without a chance to say goodbyes
without a chance to make peace,

1124
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,848
without a chance to settle the scores.

1125
01:21:48,141 --> 01:21:50,560
Then let us at least settle
those between us...

1126
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,140
Captain.

1127
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:55,867
Captain of what?

1128
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,881
The Essex was lost
through no fault of yours.

1129
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:00,826
I was as much to blame for...

1130
01:22:00,851 --> 01:22:02,178
You are not the captain.

1131
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:09,456
But you were born to do this job.

1132
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,472
I was just born into it.

1133
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,392
What do we do do you think George?

1134
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:30,392
And what offense...

1135
01:22:30,705 --> 01:22:32,976
did we give God
to upset him so?

1136
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:36,081
The only creature to have
offended God here is the whale.

1137
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,115
Not us?

1138
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,153
In our arrogance, our greed,

1139
01:22:42,177 --> 01:22:43,667
look where we find ourselves.

1140
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,844
We are supreme creatures
made in God's own likeness.

1141
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,035
Earthly kings...

1142
01:22:49,691 --> 01:22:51,746
whose business it is to circumnavigate,

1143
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:53,160
the planet bestowed to us.

1144
01:22:54,172 --> 01:22:55,901
To bend nature to our will.

1145
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,093
You really feel like an earthly king

1146
01:22:58,118 --> 01:22:59,984
after everything that
we have been through?

1147
01:23:01,406 --> 01:23:03,030
We are nothing. We are...

1148
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,259
We are specks.

1149
01:23:04,931 --> 01:23:06,009
And dust.

1150
01:23:07,046 --> 01:23:09,014
We sail into the sun at dawn.

1151
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:11,641
If we are to die...

1152
01:23:12,371 --> 01:23:13,643
then with God's grace...

1153
01:23:15,027 --> 01:23:16,636
let us die as men.

1154
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:29,735
Are we ready Mr. Weeks?

1155
01:23:30,127 --> 01:23:31,174
Aye sir.

1156
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:39,557
Mr. Chappel?

1157
01:23:40,178 --> 01:23:41,179
Mr. Wright?

1158
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:42,706
I can't do it sir.

1159
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,330
Me Wrights and Weeks,

1160
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,015
we are staying.

1161
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,036
You ready to go Matthew?

1162
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,026
I will give you a hand.
Here you got to get up.

1163
01:24:11,051 --> 01:24:12,047
No, there is no point.

1164
01:24:12,071 --> 01:24:13,661
You hear me?
No we are going home.

1165
01:24:13,685 --> 01:24:14,660
We are going home.

1166
01:24:14,726 --> 01:24:15,871
There is no point.

1167
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:17,863
Just go.

1168
01:24:22,428 --> 01:24:23,714
God damn it Matthew.

1169
01:24:27,116 --> 01:24:28,129
It's alright.

1170
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,841
Well I will send a boat for you
the minute we get back.

1171
01:24:31,866 --> 01:24:34,274
Then we will play cards
back in Nantucket alright?

1172
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:35,420
Yeah.

1173
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:37,342
It's a deal.
Good.

1174
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:45,907
You want me to open that for you?

1175
01:24:51,058 --> 01:24:52,035
I think I will manage.

1176
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:54,531
If it comes to that.

1177
01:24:58,520 --> 01:24:59,933
God be with you brother.

1178
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:03,166
Yeah and you.

1179
01:25:22,675 --> 01:25:23,858
Brother Peterson?

1180
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:26,804
You all coming with us?

1181
01:25:27,771 --> 01:25:28,671
Mr. Peterson.

1182
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:31,147
Why don't you come in our boat
with Mr. Bond here?

1183
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:05,974
Where... Where is he?

1184
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,185
Pollard?

1185
01:26:10,754 --> 01:26:12,849
Mr. Lawrence.
Mr. Lawrence wake up.

1186
01:26:14,801 --> 01:26:16,208
Where is the other boat gone?

1187
01:26:17,291 --> 01:26:18,328
Pollard!

1188
01:26:18,352 --> 01:26:19,913
Captain Pollard!
Captain Pollard!

1189
01:26:19,937 --> 01:26:21,811
Pollard.
Captain Pollard sir!

1190
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:23,805
Pollard.
Captain!

1191
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,103
Captain Pollard!

1192
01:26:29,203 --> 01:26:30,486
Pollard!

1193
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:36,361
What's the matter?

1194
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:54,191
Ben-Benjamin. What are you doing?

1195
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:55,786
He is dead.

1196
01:26:56,787 --> 01:26:58,198
Putting him overboard sir.

1197
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:01,573
Look at me.

1198
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,393
Look at me Benjamin.

1199
01:27:08,529 --> 01:27:12,000
No right minded sailor discards
what might yet save him.

1200
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:25,169
Listen to me boy. Listen to me.

1201
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,080
He can help us.

1202
01:27:31,555 --> 01:27:32,568
My God.

1203
01:27:32,787 --> 01:27:33,916
My heavenly king.

1204
01:27:34,288 --> 01:27:37,260
Sweetness is the power of his grace.

1205
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:42,410
With longing eyes thy creatures
await on thee for daily food.

1206
01:27:43,708 --> 01:27:45,274
My soul is dead.

1207
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,383
So it was decided.

1208
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,482
We prepared the body.

1209
01:28:13,938 --> 01:28:15,511
We removed the organs.

1210
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,894
Separated his limbs from his body,

1211
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:25,005
and cut all the flesh from the bones.

1212
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,246
After which...

1213
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:33,692
we closed the body

1214
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:36,721
and we sewed it up

1215
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,106
as decently as we could

1216
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:41,848
and committed it to the sea.

1217
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,128
We ate the heart first.

1218
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,172
You judge me.

1219
01:28:58,642 --> 01:28:59,492
No.

1220
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,083
There.

1221
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:09,122
There.

1222
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,622
It is done.

1223
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:15,354
It is out.

1224
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,049
And you have never told anyone?

1225
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:22,643
No.

1226
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:25,930
Not even your wife?

1227
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,521
Do you think she could ever love me

1228
01:29:29,806 --> 01:29:31,479
if she knew the abominations,

1229
01:29:31,503 --> 01:29:32,742
I had committed?

1230
01:29:32,905 --> 01:29:33,731
Yes.

1231
01:29:34,285 --> 01:29:35,358
She would.

1232
01:29:36,475 --> 01:29:39,576
And if you had told me
the story when we met...

1233
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:42,990
I would still wear your ring today.

1234
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,878
The strength of that boy,

1235
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:48,995
still lives in you.

1236
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:52,540
I see that.

1237
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:55,120
Even if you don't.

1238
01:30:16,589 --> 01:30:19,050
You can finish your story now my love.

1239
01:30:35,234 --> 01:30:36,520
Hey sit up.

1240
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:41,072
Listen

1241
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,759
put your head back.

1242
01:30:46,505 --> 01:30:49,190
Look we still got
a few drops of water left.

1243
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,911
Don't you quit on me.
We are going home.

1244
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,275
Do you have a family...

1245
01:30:59,593 --> 01:31:01,925
back home, Mr. Chase?

1246
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,382
Yeah I have a wife.

1247
01:31:06,930 --> 01:31:09,331
Yes and a son or a daughter.

1248
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:55,809
Very well.

1249
01:31:58,120 --> 01:31:58,918
Captain.

1250
01:31:59,262 --> 01:32:00,496
We will draw again.

1251
01:32:00,521 --> 01:32:02,200
We will do no such thing.

1252
01:32:03,370 --> 01:32:04,451
We will draw again.

1253
01:32:04,994 --> 01:32:06,245
Mr. Ramsdell,

1254
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:09,160
you will assume command of this vessel.

1255
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:12,925
Cousin will you?

1256
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:15,927
You are our...

1257
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:17,103
You are our captain.

1258
01:32:17,501 --> 01:32:18,741
The men need you.

1259
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:21,645
The men will be fine.

1260
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:23,804
Please.

1261
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,398
Please. Please.

1262
01:32:26,547 --> 01:32:28,197
Henry.
Let us draw again.

1263
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:30,679
It is an order.

1264
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:33,786
If you cannot do it,

1265
01:32:34,247 --> 01:32:36,090
pass the pistol to another man.

1266
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:05,725
Henry, no, no, no!

1267
01:33:15,508 --> 01:33:16,829
You got to help me kid.

1268
01:33:17,220 --> 01:33:18,536
You got to help me.

1269
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,569
We were weeks in the doldrums.

1270
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:26,557
That part of the Pacific
is more desert than ocean.

1271
01:33:27,611 --> 01:33:29,420
The sun beating down.

1272
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,606
My fear.

1273
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:34,737
All I could think about

1274
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:39,914
was that everyone would die
and I would be the last left alive.

1275
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,526
And as best Mr. Chase could tell
we were still 800 miles from land.

1276
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:52,802
Mr. Chase.

1277
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:02,550
Captain Pollard.

1278
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:06,891
I am happy to see you.

1279
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:10,320
Been very little happiness in our survival.

1280
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,004
Or in ours sir.

1281
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:16,209
Barzillai?

1282
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:20,717
The third boat?

1283
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:23,171
They ave...

1284
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,450
They ave been gone for days.

1285
01:34:27,172 --> 01:34:28,776
I am afraid they are lost sir.

1286
01:34:58,885 --> 01:35:01,168
Mr. Chase, you have the best position.

1287
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:18,975
It's just a whale.

1288
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:24,407
He is there! Throw the lance!

1289
01:35:26,115 --> 01:35:27,162
Throw it!

1290
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:34,689
Throw it! Throw the lance!
Come on.

1291
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:47,084
Throw it!

1292
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:48,605
Come on.

1293
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:59,088
Kill it! He is there!

1294
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:01,153
Throw the lance!

1295
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,204
Why didn't you kill it?

1296
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:49,570
You are a damn fool.

1297
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:14,890
Currents drew us apart

1298
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,982
and that was the last we would see
of Captain Pollard's whale boat.

1299
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,206
A boat!

1300
01:37:25,261 --> 01:37:27,152
Broad on the port bow!

1301
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:54,451
May God have mercy.

1302
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:38,440
Mr. Chase.

1303
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:41,964
Fath...

1304
01:38:42,261 --> 01:38:43,167
Father!

1305
01:38:44,527 --> 01:38:45,566
Don't lea...

1306
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:47,690
Don't leave me Father!

1307
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,104
Mr. Chase.

1308
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,010
Mr. Chase.

1309
01:39:42,302 --> 01:39:42,923
Sir.

1310
01:39:43,399 --> 01:39:45,075
Look. Look sir.

1311
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:49,596
Mr. Chase.

1312
01:39:50,674 --> 01:39:51,484
Look.

1313
01:39:51,789 --> 01:39:52,719
Mr. Chase.

1314
01:39:53,417 --> 01:39:54,492
Wake up Mr. Chase!

1315
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:56,386
Here wake up!

1316
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:00,362
Please, wake up sir there is land.

1317
01:40:01,388 --> 01:40:02,676
Mr. Chase look.

1318
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:24,631
We were rescued there,

1319
01:40:25,178 --> 01:40:27,856
off the island of Mas Afuera, Chile

1320
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,408
90 days after the sinking of the Essex.

1321
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:34,924
They gave us some old clothes.

1322
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:36,851
Fed us too.

1323
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:39,947
It was hard to eat at first.

1324
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:41,588
Strange.

1325
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:45,403
They looked after us as best they could

1326
01:40:45,490 --> 01:40:47,731
till we found a ship
that would carry us home.

1327
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:51,616
That voyage took another three months.

1328
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:03,786
It looked like the whole island
turned out to see us return.

1329
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:06,919
But there were no cheers.

1330
01:41:08,130 --> 01:41:09,336
Only silence.

1331
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:12,930
They looked at us like we were...

1332
01:41:13,352 --> 01:41:14,432
apparitions,

1333
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:16,479
phantoms.

1334
01:41:17,755 --> 01:41:21,540
We did said nothing of the details
of our survival to anyone

1335
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:25,450
but I wondered if they somehow
knew of our privations.

1336
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,690
Maybe they were just curious.

1337
01:42:08,754 --> 01:42:09,714
Oh my God!

1338
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:18,372
I promised didn't I?

1339
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:27,886
Oh God.

1340
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:30,727
Hi.

1341
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:33,844
Hey sweetie. Who is this?

1342
01:42:35,249 --> 01:42:36,229
Phoebe Ann.

1343
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:42,313
Phoebe Ann Chase

1344
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:45,048
This is Daddy.

1345
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:48,460
Hey sweetie.

1346
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:55,092
It's your daddy.

1347
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:04,386
Oh my God.

1348
01:43:12,993 --> 01:43:14,910
Of course they could not leave him alone.

1349
01:43:15,405 --> 01:43:18,713
Mr. Chase and his wife had
scarcely walked a block towards home

1350
01:43:18,738 --> 01:43:21,985
when he was stopped and
made to return to the Maritime office.

1351
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:25,940
There were business matters
still in question.

1352
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:41,084
So to the matter.

1353
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:49,362
Due to the significant loss of life
and property on our voyage,

1354
01:43:50,116 --> 01:43:51,659
it seems there will be an inquiry.

1355
01:43:52,927 --> 01:43:55,801
And as captain and first mate
we will be expected to give...

1356
01:43:55,825 --> 01:43:57,400
an account of what happened.

1357
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:58,853
Yes, of course.

1358
01:43:59,356 --> 01:44:01,767
And having discussed this
with the ship owners and...

1359
01:44:02,747 --> 01:44:03,772
my father...

1360
01:44:04,934 --> 01:44:06,687
it is clear that full disclosure,

1361
01:44:07,031 --> 01:44:08,452
will have ramifications.

1362
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:11,487
Terrible ramifications
for the whole industry.

1363
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:15,161
That a whale brought down the Essex.

1364
01:44:16,490 --> 01:44:17,696
But it's the truth.

1365
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:28,263
If the insurance houses and investors

1366
01:44:28,288 --> 01:44:29,626
were to start worrying about...

1367
01:44:30,048 --> 01:44:32,244
sea monsters sinking ships

1368
01:44:33,058 --> 01:44:35,265
sailors drawing lots to survive...

1369
01:44:37,011 --> 01:44:38,679
We are in the oil business.

1370
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:40,453
All of us.

1371
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:42,528
And as in any business

1372
01:44:42,553 --> 01:44:46,114
the probability of success must
always be greater than the risk incurred.

1373
01:44:48,431 --> 01:44:50,479
So what are you suggesting George?

1374
01:44:50,706 --> 01:44:52,595
That you say the ship ran aground.

1375
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:56,903
That's a lie.
And that the men that died drowned.

1376
01:44:57,145 --> 01:44:58,463
And that's another lie.

1377
01:44:58,488 --> 01:45:00,174
Think on it. They will make you captain.

1378
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,408
Well that pledge I already have
in writing.

1379
01:45:02,433 --> 01:45:06,068
Only on the condition
you bring home a ship full of oil.

1380
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,505
This way it's guaranteed.

1381
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:11,449
You would be a wealthy man.

1382
01:45:12,202 --> 01:45:14,887
The name Chase need
no longer be a landsman's name

1383
01:45:14,974 --> 01:45:16,498
but an established name that...

1384
01:45:16,677 --> 01:45:19,408
belongs among the great families
of Nantucket.

1385
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:22,961
You want me to whitewash
what happened for profit?

1386
01:45:23,811 --> 01:45:26,758
We are asking you to be pragmatic.

1387
01:45:42,570 --> 01:45:44,834
The Essex was stove by a white whale.

1388
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,924
And those of us that survived
in ill equipped whaleboats

1389
01:45:48,949 --> 01:45:50,624
had to commit abominations,

1390
01:45:51,148 --> 01:45:52,419
in order to survive.

1391
01:45:53,203 --> 01:45:57,087
And on our return
we are expected to spread barefaced lies

1392
01:45:57,962 --> 01:46:00,423
so that you the ship owners of Nantucket

1393
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:03,790
might line your pockets
and sleep well at night?

1394
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,442
Well I will not embroider the truth.

1395
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,060
Nor should you George.

1396
01:46:30,088 --> 01:46:31,876
That last time I saw him...

1397
01:46:32,409 --> 01:46:33,517
Mr. Chase sir!

1398
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:37,025
I could not find the right words
to say what I wanted to.

1399
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:39,222
Thomas.

1400
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,207
Perhaps there are no words.

1401
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:47,013
I am gonna be on my way to Falmouth,

1402
01:46:47,402 --> 01:46:48,487
and...

1403
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:52,110
It's...

1404
01:46:53,243 --> 01:46:54,771
It's been an honor sir...

1405
01:46:55,575 --> 01:46:56,798
to sail with you.

1406
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,042
The honor is been mine Mr. Nickerson.

1407
01:47:20,562 --> 01:47:21,398
Here.

1408
01:47:26,961 --> 01:47:28,486
Good luck out there Thomas.

1409
01:47:30,154 --> 01:47:31,193
And you sir.

1410
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:03,688
Next day George Pollard was called
before the inquiry.

1411
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:10,079
Gentlemen Captain George Pollard.

1412
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,554
And all the important men
in Nantucket were there.

1413
01:48:14,748 --> 01:48:16,352
It was a formality.

1414
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,144
Good day to you Captain.
Please sit down.

1415
01:48:25,713 --> 01:48:27,078
For the record then...

1416
01:48:29,537 --> 01:48:31,868
The Essex was stove by a white whale,

1417
01:48:32,197 --> 01:48:34,849
1200 leagues west of Ecuador.

1418
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:37,755
It was as if Owen Chase himself
had spoken.

1419
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:41,164
Told them the truth.

1420
01:48:45,354 --> 01:48:47,482
Captain Pollard's conscience was clear.

1421
01:48:48,902 --> 01:48:50,625
But the inquiry was a sham.

1422
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:54,201
Pollard went out again

1423
01:48:57,442 --> 01:48:58,851
looking for the white whale.

1424
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:01,120
He never found it.

1425
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:05,042
He ran a second ship aground off Hawaii.

1426
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:07,800
Twice cursed.

1427
01:49:09,569 --> 01:49:10,616
Never sailed again.

1428
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:12,321
And Owen Chase?

1429
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:15,713
He was a man of his word.

1430
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:19,252
First he sent a boat back
to Ducie Island.

1431
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:22,051
Mr. Joy had passed.

1432
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:24,170
But the other 3 were...

1433
01:49:24,584 --> 01:49:26,125
incredibly still alive.

1434
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:30,031
And then?

1435
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:32,721
And then he packed up his family,

1436
01:49:33,127 --> 01:49:34,567
and moved to New Bedford.

1437
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:37,630
Started over.

1438
01:49:38,761 --> 01:49:40,172
Became a merchant captain

1439
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:42,683
sailing on his own terms.

1440
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:55,729
Well you certainly got your
money's worth Mr. Melville.

1441
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:58,760
These February nights
are the longest of the year.

1442
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:00,843
Well, you can both rest now.

1443
01:50:00,868 --> 01:50:01,852
Believe me.

1444
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:04,688
I shall not be resting for some time.

1445
01:50:05,253 --> 01:50:06,110
Why?

1446
01:50:07,593 --> 01:50:08,938
You got your story.

1447
01:50:09,605 --> 01:50:11,051
You know your plot.

1448
01:50:11,759 --> 01:50:12,688
It's all there.

1449
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:13,887
Maybe it was not...

1450
01:50:14,387 --> 01:50:15,138
a plot.

1451
01:50:15,379 --> 01:50:16,462
I was after.

1452
01:50:16,770 --> 01:50:17,432
No.

1453
01:50:17,573 --> 01:50:18,537
What then?

1454
01:50:18,735 --> 01:50:20,852
Something else you have given me tonight.

1455
01:50:21,438 --> 01:50:22,477
And what's that?

1456
01:50:23,809 --> 01:50:25,186
The courage to go where...

1457
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:27,725
one does not want to go.

1458
01:50:29,843 --> 01:50:30,975
Mr. Melville...

1459
01:50:32,026 --> 01:50:33,073
what you have heard,

1460
01:50:33,448 --> 01:50:34,686
what I have told you,

1461
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:38,870
will it all...

1462
01:50:39,409 --> 01:50:41,589
be of service to your book?

1463
01:50:43,338 --> 01:50:44,751
It will be a work of fiction,

1464
01:50:45,298 --> 01:50:46,282
Mr. Nickerson

1465
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:49,172
inspired by truth.

1466
01:50:51,082 --> 01:50:53,805
But I, don't believe
I will feel the need to use all of it.

1467
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:04,897
Thank you.
Here.

1468
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:06,616
Take that with you.
No.

1469
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:08,762
The money is for you. I insist.

1470
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:11,111
I insist you keep it.

1471
01:51:11,595 --> 01:51:12,904
And I insist,

1472
01:51:12,928 --> 01:51:15,537
one person in this conversation is sober.

1473
01:51:26,323 --> 01:51:28,974
So it's back to...
Pittsfield Massachusetts.

1474
01:51:29,843 --> 01:51:30,547
Well...

1475
01:51:31,079 --> 01:51:31,841
good luck.

1476
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:34,129
Thank you.

1477
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:38,955
You know...

1478
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:43,166
I heard a man from Pennsylvania
drilled a hole in the ground recently,

1479
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:45,705
and found oil.

1480
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:47,966
That can't be true.

1481
01:51:49,010 --> 01:51:50,077
I heard it too.

1482
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:54,124
Oil from the ground.

1483
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:57,551
Fancy that.

1484
01:52:59,175 --> 01:53:02,175
