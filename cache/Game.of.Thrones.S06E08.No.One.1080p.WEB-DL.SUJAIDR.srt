1
00:01:55,023 --> 00:01:57,090
<i>My son.</i>

2
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,643
My firstborn son.

3
00:02:04,015 --> 00:02:07,567
My child king, hush.

4
00:02:09,854 --> 00:02:12,655
Listen to the gods,
for you they sing.

5
00:02:16,695 --> 00:02:18,422
Fight no more, sweet child.

6
00:02:18,446 --> 00:02:20,496
Your wars are won.

7
00:02:22,117 --> 00:02:24,500
The wolves are buried

8
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:26,869
and the false stag done.

9
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:33,459
Shut your blue eyes, my love.

10
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:35,094
Let the crown fall.

11
00:02:35,213 --> 00:02:37,797
The Father above
beckons you to his hall.

12
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:42,719
In Seventh Heaven
I'll see you once more.

13
00:02:46,474 --> 00:02:51,110
But now I seek vengeance
on Sansa the whore

14
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:53,946
and my brother the Imp

15
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:56,866
who killed his own king.

16
00:02:56,951 --> 00:02:59,619
Born amongst lions,
our curse from within.

17
00:02:59,738 --> 00:03:01,988
I will slay him, I swear.

18
00:03:02,073 --> 00:03:04,657
With noose or with knife,

19
00:03:04,743 --> 00:03:07,377
though it take me a fortnight,

20
00:03:07,462 --> 00:03:10,997
a moon or my life.

21
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:38,052
<i>What is that I hear and smell?</i>

22
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:41,360
<i>Someone I'll soon send to hell.</i>

23
00:03:41,446 --> 00:03:44,113
<i>It's time to see
if truth they told</i>

24
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:47,033
<i>who said Tywin Lannister
shits gold.</i>

25
00:03:47,118 --> 00:03:48,868
<i>Get the wig!</i>

26
00:03:48,953 --> 00:03:52,655
<i>You beast, you beast.
You killed my wife.</i>

27
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:55,957
<i>And now you've taken your father's life.</i>

28
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,161
<i>No worse child
ever stained this land.</i>

29
00:03:59,264 --> 00:04:02,498
<i>I curse the day I named you.</i>

30
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:07,770
<i>My greatest crime!</i>

31
00:04:39,504 --> 00:04:41,203
You're good at that.

32
00:04:41,306 --> 00:04:43,756
Where did you learn?

33
00:04:43,842 --> 00:04:45,508
I'm a jealous woman.

34
00:04:45,593 --> 00:04:47,894
I've always liked bad men

35
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:50,096
and they've always liked me.

36
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:54,745
They'd come home wherever
home was that night

37
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:58,988
stinking of some
whore's perfume.

38
00:04:59,073 --> 00:05:02,002
So we'd fight and I'd
put a hole in them.

39
00:05:02,026 --> 00:05:04,744
And then I'd feel terrible,

40
00:05:04,863 --> 00:05:06,829
so I'd patch them up.

41
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:08,392
<i>I got good at patching them up.</i>

42
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,144
And good at putting
holes in them.

43
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:12,528
And that.

44
00:05:15,206 --> 00:05:17,456
What happened to the actress?

45
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:20,676
<i>The one who wanted you dead.</i>

46
00:05:20,762 --> 00:05:22,411
Bianca.

47
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:25,047
She'll have a hard time
finding work as an actress

48
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:27,183
after what I did to her face.

49
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,606
Mmm.

50
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:35,775
I never did learn to cook.

51
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:38,444
But eat.
Eat. You need it.

52
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:43,511
The company is moving
on to Pentos soon.

53
00:05:43,535 --> 00:05:45,067
You should come with us.

54
00:05:45,153 --> 00:05:47,203
- I can't.
- Why not?

55
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:49,800
Got a feeling you'd be
good at this sort of work.

56
00:05:49,824 --> 00:05:51,969
And besides,
we need a new actress.

57
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:55,745
I don't think I could
remember all of the lines.

58
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,247
Come with us.

59
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,653
What's left for you here?

60
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:04,253
You wouldn't be safe.

61
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:07,139
Not while she's looking for me.

62
00:06:07,258 --> 00:06:09,392
<i>Who?</i>

63
00:06:09,477 --> 00:06:11,060
She doesn't have a name.

64
00:06:16,734 --> 00:06:18,267
Where will you go?

65
00:06:21,105 --> 00:06:24,657
Essos is east
and Westeros is west.

66
00:06:24,776 --> 00:06:26,742
But what's west of Westeros?

67
00:06:28,112 --> 00:06:29,195
I don't know.

68
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,863
Nobody does.

69
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:33,082
<i>That's where all the maps stop.</i>

70
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,117
The edge of the world, maybe.

71
00:06:35,203 --> 00:06:36,502
<i>I'd like to see that.</i>

72
00:06:47,432 --> 00:06:49,599
- What's that?
- Milk of the poppy.

73
00:06:49,684 --> 00:06:51,267
I don't want any.

74
00:06:53,438 --> 00:06:56,555
Sleep is the only way
you'll heal.

75
00:06:56,641 --> 00:07:00,476
Trust me, if my soup
didn't kill you, nothing will.

76
00:07:42,854 --> 00:07:46,221
Thing about Gatins, right,
is he used to be pretty.

77
00:07:46,324 --> 00:07:47,657
I was a famous kisser.

78
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:50,326
You lads know
how to kiss proper?

79
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:53,496
Course we do.

80
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:56,115
This is for masters,
this technique.

81
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,067
- You're not ready.
- I'm ready.

82
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:00,569
He says he's ready.

83
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:03,673
All right.
Now, pay attention.

84
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:09,762
You put your left hand on the
back of the lady's head.

85
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:13,182
Your right hand holds the small
of the lady's back like so.

86
00:08:14,352 --> 00:08:15,685
Very romantic.

87
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,771
Take your middle finger, yeah,

88
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,973
and you jam it
right up her bunghole.

89
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:25,394
<i>So fucking close!</i>

90
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,114
Ah, it smells like pussy to me.

91
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:29,877
Look at him.
You get hard, boy?

92
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:32,985
Fuck you!
Disgusting old twats.

93
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:39,458
Got off on that,
did you, you old fuck?

94
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,932
Where's the other one?

95
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:05,629
- The one with the yellow cloak.
- Fuck you!

96
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:07,970
Those are your last words,
fuck you?

97
00:09:08,072 --> 00:09:09,939
Come on, you can do better.

98
00:09:10,024 --> 00:09:11,407
Cunt!

99
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:13,976
You're shit at dying,
you know that?

100
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:50,290
I'd call that
a successful gambit.

101
00:09:50,314 --> 00:09:52,114
- Would you?
- Look around.

102
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,360
The city has come back to life.

103
00:09:54,402 --> 00:09:58,070
- You made a pact with fanatics.
- I did and it worked.

104
00:09:58,156 --> 00:10:01,957
If you shaved your beard with a straight
razor, you'd say the razor worked.

105
00:10:02,043 --> 00:10:04,210
That doesn't mean
it won't cut your throat.

106
00:10:04,328 --> 00:10:07,546
Spoken like a man who has
never had to shave.

107
00:10:12,303 --> 00:10:14,114
I'm going to miss you.

108
00:10:14,138 --> 00:10:15,721
I know.

109
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,902
I hope you're right about
this expedition of yours.

110
00:10:18,926 --> 00:10:22,178
If I don't return,
you'll know I was wrong.

111
00:10:25,983 --> 00:10:27,795
We need friends in Westeros.

112
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:29,384
And we need ships.

113
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:31,081
Most of all, we need our queen.

114
00:10:31,105 --> 00:10:34,573
She'll come back.
She has to.

115
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:37,359
My heart's been broken
too many times already.

116
00:10:39,447 --> 00:10:41,914
I'll walk the rest
of the way myself.

117
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:43,677
I can't go off
on a secret mission

118
00:10:43,701 --> 00:10:46,335
in the company of the most
famous dwarf in the city.

119
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:52,208
Varys.

120
00:10:52,293 --> 00:10:55,294
The most famous dwarf
in the world.

121
00:11:23,457 --> 00:11:25,969
Your Grace, several members
of the Faith Militant

122
00:11:25,993 --> 00:11:28,661
have been permitted
entry to the Red Keep.

123
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:30,996
Have been permitted?

124
00:11:31,082 --> 00:11:33,249
That's rather a tortured
way of putting it.

125
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:35,885
They demand to see you,
Your Grace.

126
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,003
Who permitted them
inside the Red Keep?

127
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:43,559
The king is aware
of their presence?

128
00:11:43,644 --> 00:11:45,094
<i>He is, Your Grace.</i>

129
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:48,659
He's currently in his
chambers at prayer.

130
00:12:03,414 --> 00:12:05,614
Your Grace, His Holiness
the High Septon

131
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,478
wishes to speak with you at
the Great Sept of Baelor.

132
00:12:08,502 --> 00:12:10,230
His Holiness the High Septon

133
00:12:10,254 --> 00:12:13,122
is welcome to see me
here in the Red Keep.

134
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:15,674
Your Grace,
this is not a request.

135
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:17,993
It is a request, Cousin Lancel.

136
00:12:18,095 --> 00:12:20,815
You are asking me for something,
I'm refusing.

137
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:25,618
The High Septon commands you.

138
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,920
<i>Are you sure you want
to refuse him?</i>

139
00:12:30,141 --> 00:12:33,225
He promised me I could stay in
the Red Keep until my trial.

140
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:35,277
He made no such promises.

141
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:38,564
- If you refuse to come of your own free will...
- Get out.

142
00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:50,042
Move aside, ser.

143
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:56,411
Order your man to step aside
or there will be violence.

144
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:05,507
I choose violence.

145
00:13:46,717 --> 00:13:50,269
Please tell His High Holiness
he's always welcome to visit.

146
00:14:01,866 --> 00:14:04,116
Looks like a siege, my lady.

147
00:14:04,235 --> 00:14:07,569
You have a keen
military mind, Pod.

148
00:14:16,747 --> 00:14:19,415
My lady.
My lady.

149
00:14:22,803 --> 00:14:25,137
Who goes there?!

150
00:14:25,256 --> 00:14:26,496
State your business!

151
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,623
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

152
00:14:28,726 --> 00:14:32,561
Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister
I've come to speak with him.

153
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:37,466
Tell him I have his sword.

154
00:14:48,612 --> 00:14:50,913
Getting a bit old
to be a squire, aren't we?

155
00:14:56,337 --> 00:14:57,619
Podrick fucking Payne.

156
00:14:57,705 --> 00:15:00,322
I thought you'd be dead by now.

157
00:15:00,424 --> 00:15:01,823
Not yet.

158
00:15:03,511 --> 00:15:05,594
- Are they in there?
- Uh-huh.

159
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:11,550
You think they're fucking?

160
00:15:11,635 --> 00:15:13,185
What?

161
00:15:13,304 --> 00:15:14,887
No.

162
00:15:14,972 --> 00:15:17,856
Why not?
I'd fuck her.

163
00:15:17,975 --> 00:15:19,608
You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?

164
00:15:19,693 --> 00:15:22,010
- I'm her squire.
- Oh.

165
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:25,314
Well, he'd fuck her,
that's for sure.

166
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,366
And she'd fuck him,
don't you think?

167
00:15:27,485 --> 00:15:29,318
The way she looks at him.

168
00:15:29,403 --> 00:15:31,904
The way all women look at
him is frankly irritating.

169
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:35,124
I preferred working with the
little brother on that account.

170
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:38,961
Come on, you're the one
with the magic cock.

171
00:15:40,331 --> 00:15:42,491
You must have
shown it to her by now.

172
00:15:44,502 --> 00:15:47,202
- She's training me to fight.
- Is she?

173
00:15:47,304 --> 00:15:49,721
- Oh.
- An hour in the morning, an hour at night.

174
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,640
Every day.

175
00:15:51,725 --> 00:15:55,544
Then how come an old cunt like me
can still sneak up and murder you?

176
00:15:55,646 --> 00:15:58,180
Well, that's a different
sort of fighting.

177
00:15:58,265 --> 00:15:59,960
Now, that's the truth, isn't it?

178
00:15:59,984 --> 00:16:02,518
<i>You want to learn
that sort of fighting?</i>

179
00:16:03,904 --> 00:16:05,737
All right.

180
00:16:05,856 --> 00:16:08,106
All right, let's start
with your footwork.

181
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:10,409
Show me your stance.

182
00:16:11,862 --> 00:16:13,412
Now listen to me, Pod.

183
00:16:13,531 --> 00:16:16,198
See how your feet
are about a yard apart?

184
00:16:16,283 --> 00:16:19,179
Lesson number one, assume
everyone wants to hit you.

185
00:16:19,203 --> 00:16:23,288
'Cause they do, Pod. Everyone
wants to hit a fucking squire.

186
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,008
Do it again.
Come on, don't sulk.

187
00:16:26,093 --> 00:16:27,709
<i>I never thought you'd find her.</i>

188
00:16:27,795 --> 00:16:29,244
<i>I just assumed Sansa was dead.</i>

189
00:16:29,346 --> 00:16:31,525
Why would you assume that?

190
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:35,467
In my experience, girls like
her don't live very long.

191
00:16:35,553 --> 00:16:38,220
I don't think you know
many girls like her.

192
00:16:38,322 --> 00:16:41,256
Well, I'm proud of you.

193
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:43,942
<i>I am. You fulfilled your
oath to Catelyn Stark</i>

194
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,811
<i>against all odds.</i>

195
00:16:45,896 --> 00:16:48,897
Of course, my sister
wants Sansa dead.

196
00:16:48,983 --> 00:16:51,678
The girl is still a suspect
in Joffrey's murder,

197
00:16:51,702 --> 00:16:55,404
so there is that complication.

198
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,552
What the hell
are you doing here?

199
00:16:58,576 --> 00:17:00,292
I've come for the Blackfish.

200
00:17:00,411 --> 00:17:02,272
You're welcome to have him.

201
00:17:02,296 --> 00:17:06,081
Lady Sansa desires to take her
ancestral seat back from the Boltons

202
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,334
and assume her rightful
position as Lady of Winterfell.

203
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,566
With what army does she
plan on taking Winterfell?

204
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,972
The Tully army.

205
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:15,902
They're a bit occupied
at the moment.

206
00:17:15,926 --> 00:17:17,654
I was sent here
to reclaim Riverrun

207
00:17:17,678 --> 00:17:19,489
currently defended
by the Tully rebels,

208
00:17:19,513 --> 00:17:21,291
so you can see the conundrum.

209
00:17:21,315 --> 00:17:23,493
The Tullys are rebels because
they're fighting for their home?

210
00:17:23,517 --> 00:17:25,967
Riverrun was granted to
the Freys by royal decree.

211
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,571
As a reward for betraying Robb
Stark and slaughtering his family.

212
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:31,073
Exactly.

213
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:36,756
We shouldn't argue
about politics.

214
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,531
You're a knight, Ser Jaime.

215
00:17:39,617 --> 00:17:41,617
I know there is honor in you.

216
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:44,486
- I've seen it myself.
- I'm a Lannister.

217
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:46,566
Don't ask me
to betray my own house.

218
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,840
I do no such thing.

219
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:51,510
Take Riverrun without bloodshed.

220
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:55,163
Ride south again with your mission
complete and your army intact.

221
00:17:55,266 --> 00:17:56,848
What do you propose?

222
00:17:56,967 --> 00:18:00,636
Allow me to enter Riverrun
under a flag of truce.

223
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:03,116
Let me try to persuade the
Blackfish to give up the castle.

224
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,252
Why would he abandon
his ancestral home?

225
00:18:05,276 --> 00:18:08,860
Because you'll allow him to lead
the Tully forces safely north.

226
00:18:11,865 --> 00:18:14,225
Have you ever met the Blackfish?

227
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:18,654
- No.
- He's even more stubborn than you are.

228
00:18:18,739 --> 00:18:20,822
All right.

229
00:18:20,908 --> 00:18:23,325
Try to talk some sense
into the old goat.

230
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,711
He won't listen,
but his men might.

231
00:18:25,829 --> 00:18:28,297
Not everybody wants to die
for someone else's home.

232
00:18:28,382 --> 00:18:30,415
I need your word.

233
00:18:31,802 --> 00:18:33,730
If I persuade him
to abandon the castle,

234
00:18:33,754 --> 00:18:36,204
you'll grant
a safe passage north.

235
00:18:36,307 --> 00:18:38,507
You have my word.

236
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:40,509
You have until nightfall.

237
00:18:57,444 --> 00:19:00,112
You gave it to me for a purpose.

238
00:19:00,197 --> 00:19:03,415
I've achieved that purpose.

239
00:19:06,203 --> 00:19:07,869
It's yours.

240
00:19:09,623 --> 00:19:11,623
It will always be yours.

241
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:22,934
One last thing, Ser Jaime.

242
00:19:23,053 --> 00:19:25,187
Yes, Lady Brienne?

243
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:29,224
Should I fail to persuade
the Blackfish to surrender

244
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:32,194
and if you attack the castle,

245
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:35,313
honor compels me
to fight for Sansa's kin.

246
00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:37,482
Of course it does.

247
00:19:37,568 --> 00:19:39,067
To fight you.

248
00:19:43,574 --> 00:19:45,741
Let's hope it doesn't
come to that.

249
00:19:56,003 --> 00:19:58,053
<i>I've said no
three times already.</i>

250
00:19:58,138 --> 00:20:00,450
I have a signed letter
from your niece Sansa Stark.

251
00:20:00,474 --> 00:20:02,290
I haven't seen her
since she was a child.

252
00:20:02,393 --> 00:20:04,559
I don't know her signature.
I don't know you.

253
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:08,096
And I will not surrender.
Double the guards tonight.

254
00:20:09,516 --> 00:20:11,767
The Kingslayer wants to try us.

255
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:13,769
I can feel it.

256
00:20:14,905 --> 00:20:16,549
As I have said, my name is...

257
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:19,013
Yes, Brienne of Tarth.
I know your father.

258
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:20,970
- Good man.
- He always spoke highly of you.

259
00:20:20,994 --> 00:20:23,757
And if he were here now,
I'd tell him the same I'm telling you.

260
00:20:23,781 --> 00:20:26,309
If you think I'm abandoning
my family's seat

261
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,728
on the Kingslayer's word of honor,
you're a bloody fool.

262
00:20:28,752 --> 00:20:31,481
Riverrun cannot stand against
the Lannisters and the Freys.

263
00:20:31,505 --> 00:20:35,123
We can stand longer than your
one-handed friend thinks we can.

264
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:37,626
- He's not my friend.
- No?

265
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,442
Who gave you permission to cross the
siege line and enter the castle?

266
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:45,328
Who gave you that sword with
the gold lion on the pommel?

267
00:20:45,352 --> 00:20:49,170
Ser Jaime kept his word
to your niece Catelyn Stark.

268
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:52,507
He sent me to find Sansa,
to help her as Catelyn wanted.

269
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:54,693
He gave me this sword
to protect her.

270
00:20:54,812 --> 00:20:57,479
That is what I have done
and I will continue to do

271
00:20:57,564 --> 00:20:59,865
until the day I die.

272
00:21:12,996 --> 00:21:15,356
She's exactly like her mother.

273
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,784
I don't have enough men to
help her take Winterfell.

274
00:21:24,808 --> 00:21:26,875
You have more than she does.

275
00:21:26,977 --> 00:21:29,511
She wants her home back.
I understand that.

276
00:21:29,596 --> 00:21:31,480
But this is my home.

277
00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:33,548
And if Jaime Lannister wants it,

278
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:37,235
he can bloody well take it
the way everyone else does.

279
00:21:54,004 --> 00:21:56,705
Find the maester.

280
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,508
We need to get a raven
north to Sansa.

281
00:22:01,261 --> 00:22:03,011
What should I write?

282
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:07,682
Tell her I failed.

283
00:22:38,498 --> 00:22:40,193
There's to be
a royal announcement?

284
00:22:40,217 --> 00:22:42,167
There is.

285
00:22:42,252 --> 00:22:43,885
Why wasn't I informed?

286
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:48,957
There is to be
a royal announcement

287
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:51,009
in the throne room

288
00:22:51,094 --> 00:22:53,094
at this very moment.

289
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:58,149
Where are you going?

290
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:03,137
To stand by my son.

291
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,907
Your place is in the gallery

292
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:08,660
with the other ladies
of the court.

293
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,090
<i>Your Grace...</i>

294
00:23:36,023 --> 00:23:38,356
<i>Lords and ladies,</i>

295
00:23:38,475 --> 00:23:41,109
the Faith and the Crown

296
00:23:41,194 --> 00:23:44,446
are the two pillars
that hold up this world.

297
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:48,149
One collapses,
so does the other.

298
00:23:49,736 --> 00:23:52,237
The Father judges us all.

299
00:23:52,322 --> 00:23:53,788
If you break his laws...

300
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,910
<i>you will be punished.</i>

301
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:04,499
After conferring with His
Holiness the High Septon,

302
00:24:04,584 --> 00:24:06,918
we have determined
that Loras Tyrell

303
00:24:07,004 --> 00:24:08,815
and Cersei Lannister's trial

304
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:10,984
<i>will be held in
the Great Sept of Baelor</i>

305
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,569
<i>on the first day of the
Festival of the Mother.</i>

306
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,884
Furthermore, after much prayer

307
00:24:22,986 --> 00:24:25,036
<i>and reflection,</i>

308
00:24:25,138 --> 00:24:28,239
the Crown has decided
that from this day forward,

309
00:24:28,358 --> 00:24:30,325
trial by combat
will be forbidden

310
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,444
throughout the Seven Kingdoms.

311
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:36,559
<i>The tradition is a brutish one,</i>

312
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,583
<i>a scheme devised
by corrupt rulers</i>

313
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:41,286
<i>in order to avoid
true judgment from the gods.</i>

314
00:24:41,371 --> 00:24:43,905
<i>Cersei Lannister
and Loras Tyrell</i>

315
00:24:44,007 --> 00:24:46,019
will stand trial
before seven septons

316
00:24:46,043 --> 00:24:48,877
as it was in the earliest
days of the Faith.

317
00:24:48,962 --> 00:24:51,096
<i>Seven blessings to all.</i>

318
00:24:51,214 --> 00:24:53,048
<i>Seven blessings.</i>

319
00:25:15,455 --> 00:25:17,939
Your Grace...

320
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:21,493
that old rumor
you told me about.

321
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:25,497
My little birds investigated.

322
00:25:27,384 --> 00:25:30,118
And?

323
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,304
Was it just a rumor
or something more?

324
00:25:33,423 --> 00:25:35,056
More.

325
00:25:37,277 --> 00:25:38,893
Much more.

326
00:25:44,851 --> 00:25:47,068
<i>You seem happy.</i>

327
00:25:47,154 --> 00:25:48,987
I am happy.

328
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,073
You should both
be happy as well.

329
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,528
Not so long ago, this city
was ready to devour itself.

330
00:25:56,613 --> 00:25:59,080
Now it's like a man reborn.

331
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:01,344
I will be happy
when our queen returns.

332
00:26:01,368 --> 00:26:05,036
Why don't you drink? Why don't
either of you ever drink?

333
00:26:05,122 --> 00:26:06,487
Unsullied never drink.

334
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,934
- Why not?
- Rules.

335
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:10,258
And who made these rules?

336
00:26:10,343 --> 00:26:12,260
Your former masters?

337
00:26:12,345 --> 00:26:15,413
<i>Those miserable old shits
didn't want you to be human.</i>

338
00:26:15,515 --> 00:26:17,599
Have a drink with me.

339
00:26:20,554 --> 00:26:23,805
And you?
What's your excuse?

340
00:26:24,858 --> 00:26:26,452
I have tried wine before.

341
00:26:26,476 --> 00:26:28,276
It made me feel funny.

342
00:26:28,361 --> 00:26:30,311
That's how you know
it's working.

343
00:26:32,816 --> 00:26:35,316
Here's to our queen.

344
00:26:35,402 --> 00:26:38,653
Anyone not drinking
is disrespecting our queen.

345
00:26:41,908 --> 00:26:44,125
To Daenerys Stormborn,
Mother of Dragons,

346
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:46,911
Breaker of Chains,
long may she reign.

347
00:26:46,997 --> 00:26:49,214
- Long may she reign.
- Long may she reign.

348
00:26:54,971 --> 00:26:56,504
<i>Do you like it?</i>

349
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,701
Tastes like it has turned.

350
00:26:58,725 --> 00:27:01,976
Yes, yes.
Fermentation.

351
00:27:05,515 --> 00:27:10,151
One day, after our queen has
taken the Seven Kingdoms...

352
00:27:11,855 --> 00:27:14,105
I'd like to have
my own vineyard.

353
00:27:15,408 --> 00:27:18,059
Make my own wine.

354
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:20,662
The Imp's Delight.

355
00:27:20,747 --> 00:27:23,198
Only my close friends
could drink it.

356
00:27:26,837 --> 00:27:29,403
Tell me a joke,
Missandei of Naath.

357
00:27:29,506 --> 00:27:32,073
I do not know any jokes.

358
00:27:32,175 --> 00:27:33,291
Grey Worm?

359
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,595
Right.

360
00:27:39,466 --> 00:27:42,467
Three lords
walk into a tavern...

361
00:27:42,552 --> 00:27:45,086
A Stark, a Martell,
and a Lannister.

362
00:27:45,188 --> 00:27:46,688
<i>They order ale,</i>

363
00:27:46,773 --> 00:27:49,274
but when the barkeep
brings them over,

364
00:27:49,392 --> 00:27:51,893
each of them finds
a fly in his cup.

365
00:27:51,978 --> 00:27:56,314
The Lannister, outraged, shoves the
cup aside and demands another.

366
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,568
The Martell plucks the fly
out and swallows it whole.

367
00:28:01,621 --> 00:28:05,323
The Stark reaches into his cup,

368
00:28:05,408 --> 00:28:08,243
pulls out the fly and shouts,

369
00:28:08,328 --> 00:28:10,912
"Spit it out, you wee shit.

370
00:28:10,997 --> 00:28:12,330
Spit it out."

371
00:28:18,138 --> 00:28:20,471
It's funnier in Westeros.

372
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,791
The Starks and the Lannisters,
I thought these were enemies.

373
00:28:23,894 --> 00:28:24,926
Yes.

374
00:28:25,011 --> 00:28:28,646
A joke is like a story,
Torgo Nudho.

375
00:28:28,765 --> 00:28:30,899
Not a true story, necessarily.

376
00:28:30,984 --> 00:28:33,985
A story that's supposed
to make you laugh ideally.

377
00:28:34,104 --> 00:28:35,904
<i>Not at the moment, perhaps.</i>

378
00:28:35,989 --> 00:28:38,406
<i>Missandei, do you like the wine?</i>

379
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:39,941
I do.

380
00:28:40,026 --> 00:28:41,359
Tell a joke.

381
00:28:47,417 --> 00:28:50,251
Two translators
are on a sinking ship.

382
00:28:51,955 --> 00:28:53,955
The first says,

383
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,424
"Do you know
how to swim?"

384
00:28:56,509 --> 00:29:00,962
The second says, "No, but I can
shout for help in 19 languages."

385
00:29:04,017 --> 00:29:06,601
Ah!

386
00:29:10,056 --> 00:29:12,173
That is the worst joke
I ever heard.

387
00:29:12,275 --> 00:29:14,003
You don't even know
what a joke is.

388
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:16,945
I am soldier all my life.
You think I never hear joke?

389
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,397
You lied to us.

390
00:29:20,984 --> 00:29:22,317
I make joke.

391
00:29:32,963 --> 00:29:34,329
More jokes.

392
00:29:34,414 --> 00:29:36,798
I once walked into a brothel

393
00:29:36,883 --> 00:29:38,532
with a honeycomb and a jackass.

394
00:29:38,635 --> 00:29:41,302
The madam says...

395
00:29:53,516 --> 00:29:56,184
The Masters have come
for their property.

396
00:30:14,287 --> 00:30:15,670
Lord Edmure.

397
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,074
<i>I apologize for the way
the Freys treated you.</i>

398
00:30:20,176 --> 00:30:22,457
A man of your birth
deserves better.

399
00:30:22,545 --> 00:30:26,514
You have my word you'll be properly
fed and clothed from now on.

400
00:30:28,518 --> 00:30:30,468
I have your word?

401
00:30:32,689 --> 00:30:35,089
Oh, good.

402
00:30:35,191 --> 00:30:37,225
Good, that's...

403
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,277
That's a fine thing.

404
00:30:41,064 --> 00:30:44,032
My uncle will never
surrender the castle, ser.

405
00:30:44,117 --> 00:30:46,100
Whatever game you're playing.

406
00:30:46,202 --> 00:30:48,130
The Blackfish is an old man.

407
00:30:48,154 --> 00:30:50,349
A good death is all
he can hope for.

408
00:30:50,373 --> 00:30:53,653
But you, you have a
child now, I've heard.

409
00:30:54,878 --> 00:30:57,378
A son you sired
on your wedding night.

410
00:30:57,464 --> 00:30:59,280
You're a potent man.

411
00:30:59,382 --> 00:31:01,716
A son I've never met

412
00:31:01,801 --> 00:31:04,552
born of a wife
that I haven't seen

413
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:05,997
since our first night together.

414
00:31:06,089 --> 00:31:08,489
You should be with them both.

415
00:31:08,808 --> 00:31:10,975
I can arrange that, you realize?

416
00:31:11,094 --> 00:31:13,205
Comfortable rooms for you
at Casterly Rock.

417
00:31:13,229 --> 00:31:16,492
A tutor for your boy, knights to
train him to fight and to ride.

418
00:31:16,516 --> 00:31:19,045
And when he comes of age,
he'll have a keep of his own.

419
00:31:19,069 --> 00:31:21,486
Do you imagine yourself
a decent person?

420
00:31:21,604 --> 00:31:24,138
Is that it?

421
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,658
After you've massacred
my family.

422
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,862
Kept me in a cell for years.

423
00:31:30,947 --> 00:31:32,947
Stolen our lands.

424
00:31:33,032 --> 00:31:35,616
I'll remind you that
our houses are at war.

425
00:31:35,702 --> 00:31:37,930
I'm sorry if this conflict
has inconvenienced you,

426
00:31:37,954 --> 00:31:40,516
but rebelling against the
Crown does have consequences.

427
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,818
Says the man who shoved his
sword through his king's back.

428
00:31:42,842 --> 00:31:45,659
Did I give you the impression
that this was a negotiation?

429
00:31:45,762 --> 00:31:46,961
It's not.

430
00:31:49,466 --> 00:31:52,383
You understand.
On some level you understand

431
00:31:52,469 --> 00:31:54,435
that you're an evil man.

432
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:56,248
I'll leave the judgments
to the gods.

433
00:31:56,272 --> 00:31:58,556
Well, that is
convenient for you.

434
00:32:01,861 --> 00:32:05,463
You're a fine-looking
fellow, aren't you?

435
00:32:08,067 --> 00:32:10,651
Your square jaw,

436
00:32:10,737 --> 00:32:12,487
your golden armor.

437
00:32:14,157 --> 00:32:17,291
Tell me, I want to know.

438
00:32:17,377 --> 00:32:18,960
I truly do.

439
00:32:19,045 --> 00:32:20,495
How do you live with yourself?

440
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,384
All of us have to believe

441
00:32:26,503 --> 00:32:29,504
that we're decent, don't we?

442
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:32,757
You have to sleep at night.

443
00:32:32,842 --> 00:32:35,309
How do you tell yourself

444
00:32:35,395 --> 00:32:38,012
that you're decent

445
00:32:38,097 --> 00:32:40,598
after everything
that you've done?

446
00:32:46,406 --> 00:32:48,773
I was your sister's
prisoner once.

447
00:32:52,028 --> 00:32:55,530
She hit me on the head with a
rock if I remember correctly.

448
00:32:58,251 --> 00:33:00,084
Yeah.

449
00:33:01,788 --> 00:33:03,148
She should have killed you.

450
00:33:03,206 --> 00:33:05,039
Perhaps, but she didn't.

451
00:33:06,459 --> 00:33:10,211
Catelyn Stark hated me
just like you hate me.

452
00:33:10,296 --> 00:33:12,580
<i>But I didn't hate her.</i>

453
00:33:12,682 --> 00:33:14,248
I admired her.

454
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,278
Far more than her
husband or her son.

455
00:33:16,302 --> 00:33:18,664
Do you think I care whom you
admire and whom you don't?

456
00:33:18,688 --> 00:33:21,333
No, I don't, but I'm telling you
anyway because you're my prisoner.

457
00:33:21,357 --> 00:33:23,591
You don't have a choice.

458
00:33:23,693 --> 00:33:25,754
The love she had
for her children,

459
00:33:25,778 --> 00:33:27,840
I was a little awed by it.

460
00:33:27,864 --> 00:33:30,231
Reminded me of my sister.

461
00:33:30,316 --> 00:33:33,451
Oh.
Oh, I see.

462
00:33:35,288 --> 00:33:37,104
You're a madman.

463
00:33:37,207 --> 00:33:39,134
I'm not here to trade insults.

464
00:33:39,158 --> 00:33:41,659
- Your sister was a strong...
- Don't talk about Cat!

465
00:33:41,744 --> 00:33:45,663
I'll talk about whomever I want.

466
00:33:46,716 --> 00:33:48,782
She loved her children.

467
00:33:48,885 --> 00:33:51,452
I suppose all mothers do,

468
00:33:51,554 --> 00:33:54,288
but Catelyn and Cersei,

469
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,535
there's a fierceness
you don't often see.

470
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,343
They'd do anything
to protect their babies.

471
00:33:59,429 --> 00:34:01,262
Start a war.

472
00:34:01,347 --> 00:34:05,132
Burn cities to ash.
Free their worst enemies.

473
00:34:05,235 --> 00:34:07,385
The things we do for love.

474
00:34:11,741 --> 00:34:15,493
You didn't come here
to talk about our sisters.

475
00:34:15,612 --> 00:34:18,496
That's exactly why I came here.

476
00:34:20,116 --> 00:34:22,283
I love Cersei.

477
00:34:22,368 --> 00:34:24,418
You can laugh
at that if you want.

478
00:34:24,504 --> 00:34:26,624
You can sneer.
Doesn't matter.

479
00:34:26,673 --> 00:34:28,539
She needs me.

480
00:34:28,658 --> 00:34:32,460
And to get back to her,
I have to take Riverrun.

481
00:34:35,932 --> 00:34:39,050
I'll send for your baby boy.

482
00:34:39,135 --> 00:34:42,436
And I'll launch him into
Riverrun with a catapult.

483
00:34:42,522 --> 00:34:45,839
Because you don't matter
to me, Lord Edmure.

484
00:34:45,942 --> 00:34:48,509
Your son doesn't matter to me.

485
00:34:48,611 --> 00:34:52,280
The people in the castle
don't matter to me.

486
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:55,483
Only Cersei.

487
00:34:57,036 --> 00:34:59,654
And if I have to
slaughter every Tully

488
00:34:59,739 --> 00:35:02,823
who ever lived
to get back to her,

489
00:35:02,909 --> 00:35:05,409
that's what I'll do.

490
00:35:32,355 --> 00:35:34,939
<i>Who goes there?</i>

491
00:35:35,024 --> 00:35:36,774
Edmure Tully,

492
00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:38,359
son of Hoster Tully

493
00:35:38,444 --> 00:35:40,828
and the rightful
Lord of Riverrun.

494
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:45,082
I demand entry.

495
00:35:45,201 --> 00:35:48,002
Don't let him in.

496
00:35:48,087 --> 00:35:50,454
He's the Lord of Riverrun.

497
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,820
I have to obey his commands.

498
00:35:51,874 --> 00:35:53,507
He's been their captive

499
00:35:53,593 --> 00:35:56,410
ever since they murdered
his king at the Red Wedding.

500
00:35:56,512 --> 00:35:59,608
Why do you think the people who
murdered his king at the Red Wedding

501
00:35:59,632 --> 00:36:02,916
would decide
to let him come home?

502
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:06,187
Because it's a trap, you idiot.

503
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,588
Don't let him in.

504
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,390
He's my lord, my lord.

505
00:36:09,475 --> 00:36:12,338
I've sworn to serve the Lord of
Riverrun and obey his commands.

506
00:36:12,362 --> 00:36:15,146
You're not obeying
Edmure's commands.

507
00:36:15,231 --> 00:36:19,233
You're obeying the fucking
Kingslayer's commands.

508
00:36:19,318 --> 00:36:21,986
<i>I demand entry.</i>

509
00:36:22,071 --> 00:36:23,549
My lord has given an order.

510
00:36:23,573 --> 00:36:25,634
With a knife to his throat.

511
00:36:25,658 --> 00:36:28,075
That is not a valid order.

512
00:36:32,832 --> 00:36:35,027
Lower the drawbridge and
open the gate for Lord Ed...

513
00:36:35,051 --> 00:36:37,301
Aye, ser.

514
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,954
I'll have your head before
I surrender Riverrun.

515
00:36:41,057 --> 00:36:44,725
You are not lord
of this castle, my lord.

516
00:36:56,439 --> 00:36:59,273
- Lower the drawbridge.
<i>- Aye, ser!</i>

517
00:37:43,736 --> 00:37:45,464
<i>If you're wrong,</i>

518
00:37:45,488 --> 00:37:49,156
we've just surrendered
our most valuable prisoner.

519
00:38:29,115 --> 00:38:30,948
Welcome home, my lord.

520
00:38:35,705 --> 00:38:39,025
Command all the forces within the
castle to lay down their arms.

521
00:38:41,043 --> 00:38:42,793
Open the gates.

522
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:45,713
- My lord...
- Your lord has given a command.

523
00:39:19,749 --> 00:39:22,750
<i>Infantry, advance!</i>

524
00:39:35,932 --> 00:39:38,682
Find the Blackfish.

525
00:39:38,768 --> 00:39:42,019
Put him in irons and hand
him over to the Freys.

526
00:39:45,858 --> 00:39:47,691
Find him.

527
00:40:12,602 --> 00:40:14,685
Go on.

528
00:40:14,804 --> 00:40:16,020
Come with us.

529
00:40:16,138 --> 00:40:17,738
I've run before
from the Red Wedding.

530
00:40:17,773 --> 00:40:20,057
I'm not running again.
This is my family home.

531
00:40:20,142 --> 00:40:23,811
Your family is in the North.
Come with us.

532
00:40:23,896 --> 00:40:27,416
Don't die for pride when you
can fight for your blood.

533
00:40:28,567 --> 00:40:32,202
You'll serve Sansa far
better than I ever could.

534
00:40:37,326 --> 00:40:38,971
<i>All the way down!</i>

535
00:40:38,995 --> 00:40:41,795
- <i>Check that out!</i>
- Go on, now.

536
00:40:41,881 --> 00:40:44,882
I haven't had a proper
sword fight in years.

537
00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:47,718
I expect I'll make
a damn fool of myself.

538
00:41:21,754 --> 00:41:24,488
We found the Blackfish, my lord.

539
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,173
Good.

540
00:41:26,258 --> 00:41:28,559
Bring him to me.

541
00:41:28,661 --> 00:41:31,061
He died fighting, my lord.

542
00:43:01,303 --> 00:43:03,423
- I was wrong. I admit it.
- That changes nothing.

543
00:43:03,472 --> 00:43:05,912
The Unsullied could mount
a defense off the beachhead.

544
00:43:05,975 --> 00:43:09,171
- If the slavers' forces...
- No more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.

545
00:43:09,195 --> 00:43:10,839
And I have acknowledged that.
I'm trying...

546
00:43:10,863 --> 00:43:12,841
You're trying to tell me
what the army should do.

547
00:43:12,865 --> 00:43:15,315
<i>You do not know
what the army should do.</i>

548
00:43:15,401 --> 00:43:17,568
All right, what should
the army do?

549
00:43:17,653 --> 00:43:19,453
We'll not go to the beach.

550
00:43:19,538 --> 00:43:21,855
If we go to the beach,
the Masters will take the pyramid.

551
00:43:21,957 --> 00:43:24,374
The pyramid is the only place
in the city we can defend.

552
00:43:24,493 --> 00:43:25,971
- We stay here.
- And then?

553
00:43:25,995 --> 00:43:27,828
We wait for them to come to us.

554
00:43:27,913 --> 00:43:30,130
Then we fight them.

555
00:44:40,286 --> 00:44:41,985
Clegane.

556
00:44:42,071 --> 00:44:44,204
What the fuck you doing here?

557
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:46,406
Chasing them.
You?

558
00:44:46,492 --> 00:44:48,325
Hanging them.

559
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:50,222
Any particular reason?

560
00:44:50,246 --> 00:44:52,612
They're our men.
Or they were.

561
00:44:52,715 --> 00:44:55,282
They attacked a nearby sept
and murdered the villagers.

562
00:44:55,384 --> 00:44:56,533
<i>Why do you want them?</i>

563
00:44:56,635 --> 00:44:58,135
Same reason.

564
00:44:58,254 --> 00:45:00,287
I was helping build it.

565
00:45:00,389 --> 00:45:02,701
<i>They killed a friend of mine.</i>

566
00:45:02,725 --> 00:45:03,974
You've got friends?

567
00:45:04,093 --> 00:45:06,960
Not anymore.
They're mine.

568
00:45:07,062 --> 00:45:09,658
It's the Brotherhood's good name
they've dragged through the dirt.

569
00:45:09,682 --> 00:45:11,459
Fuck your name.
They're mine.

570
00:45:11,483 --> 00:45:13,078
I killed you once
before, Dondarrion.

571
00:45:13,102 --> 00:45:15,102
Happy to do it again.

572
00:45:15,187 --> 00:45:17,667
Drop that arrow,
you bloody girl.

573
00:45:18,857 --> 00:45:21,417
Tougher girls than you
have tried to kill me.

574
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:25,099
You can have one of them.

575
00:45:29,702 --> 00:45:31,084
Two.

576
00:45:42,798 --> 00:45:44,831
No, no, no.

577
00:45:44,934 --> 00:45:47,384
We're not butchers.
We hang them.

578
00:45:47,469 --> 00:45:49,136
Hanging?

579
00:45:49,221 --> 00:45:50,699
All over in an instant.

580
00:45:50,723 --> 00:45:52,250
Where's the punishment in that?

581
00:45:52,274 --> 00:45:54,858
- They die.
- We all bloody die.

582
00:45:54,977 --> 00:45:57,444
Except this one here.

583
00:45:57,529 --> 00:45:59,613
I'll only gut one of them.

584
00:45:59,698 --> 00:46:02,149
<i>No.</i>

585
00:46:02,234 --> 00:46:04,017
I'll chop off one hand.

586
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:07,187
We gave you two of the three
out of respect for your loss.

587
00:46:07,289 --> 00:46:08,655
That's generous.

588
00:46:12,461 --> 00:46:15,528
Bunch of nancies.

589
00:46:15,631 --> 00:46:18,131
There was a time I would
have killed all seven of you

590
00:46:18,217 --> 00:46:19,383
just to gut these three.

591
00:46:19,501 --> 00:46:20,862
You're getting old, Clegane.

592
00:46:20,886 --> 00:46:22,369
He's not.

593
00:46:24,473 --> 00:46:27,007
Please don't.
I'll give you anything.

594
00:46:55,587 --> 00:46:57,454
Got anything to eat?

595
00:47:09,718 --> 00:47:11,918
Enjoying yourself?

596
00:47:12,021 --> 00:47:14,054
I prefer chicken.

597
00:47:15,524 --> 00:47:18,859
You ought to join us.
We could use you.

598
00:47:20,145 --> 00:47:22,612
I tried joining.
Didn't work out for me.

599
00:47:22,731 --> 00:47:25,649
Clegane, we're here
for a reason.

600
00:47:27,236 --> 00:47:30,603
The Lord of Light is keeping
Beric alive for a reason.

601
00:47:30,706 --> 00:47:33,073
He gave a failed, drunk priest

602
00:47:33,158 --> 00:47:35,909
the power to bring him
back for a reason.

603
00:47:35,994 --> 00:47:38,328
We are part of something
larger than ourselves.

604
00:47:38,414 --> 00:47:41,614
Lots of horrible shit
in this world gets done

605
00:47:41,717 --> 00:47:43,917
for something larger
than ourselves.

606
00:47:51,093 --> 00:47:54,094
Cold winds
are rising in the North.

607
00:47:54,179 --> 00:47:56,579
And you're going
to go stop them?

608
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,244
We need good men to help us.

609
00:47:59,268 --> 00:48:03,019
Last time you saw me,
you wanted to execute me.

610
00:48:04,656 --> 00:48:06,334
<i>True enough.</i>

611
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:09,443
But the Lord of Light gave
you the power to defeat me.

612
00:48:09,528 --> 00:48:12,028
Why?

613
00:48:12,114 --> 00:48:15,093
I beat you because I'm
better than you, Beric.

614
00:48:15,117 --> 00:48:19,369
I was better than you before you
started yammering on about the Lord

615
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:22,456
and I'm better than you now.

616
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:24,436
Aye, you're probably right.

617
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:27,294
You're a fighter.

618
00:48:27,379 --> 00:48:29,629
You were born a fighter.

619
00:48:29,715 --> 00:48:32,132
You walked away from the fight.

620
00:48:32,217 --> 00:48:33,884
How did that go?

621
00:48:36,688 --> 00:48:39,973
Good and bad, young and old,

622
00:48:40,058 --> 00:48:42,809
the things we're fighting
will destroy them all alike.

623
00:48:44,646 --> 00:48:47,898
<i>You can still help a lot more
than you've harmed, Clegane.</i>

624
00:48:47,983 --> 00:48:49,900
It's not too late for you.

625
00:49:53,715 --> 00:49:55,515
Lady Crane?

626
00:50:03,725 --> 00:50:05,609
<i>Lady Crane?</i>

627
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:15,652
If you'd have done your job,
she would have died painlessly.

628
00:50:17,906 --> 00:50:19,990
Instead...

629
00:50:22,077 --> 00:50:24,557
The Many-Faced God
was promised a name.

630
00:50:25,914 --> 00:50:28,109
He must always
receive what is his.

631
00:50:28,133 --> 00:50:30,834
You can't change that.

632
00:50:30,919 --> 00:50:33,386
I can't change that.

633
00:50:33,472 --> 00:50:35,505
No one can.

634
00:50:38,143 --> 00:50:40,594
And now he's been
promised another name.

635
00:50:56,161 --> 00:50:58,361
- Hey!
- Get out!

636
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:03,166
Yah!

637
00:52:22,698 --> 00:52:24,414
Hey!

638
00:52:27,202 --> 00:52:29,035
Yah!

639
00:52:30,122 --> 00:52:31,671
Ah!

640
00:52:43,769 --> 00:52:46,102
My basket!

641
00:54:20,148 --> 00:54:21,748
It will all be over soon.

642
00:54:23,151 --> 00:54:25,952
On your knees or on your feet?

643
00:54:36,665 --> 00:54:38,915
Haven't we been
through this already?

644
00:54:41,086 --> 00:54:42,836
That won't help you.

645
00:55:54,576 --> 00:55:56,576
You told her to kill me.

646
00:56:03,301 --> 00:56:04,951
Yes.

647
00:56:05,053 --> 00:56:07,520
<i>But here you are.</i>

648
00:56:07,589 --> 00:56:10,306
And there she is.

649
00:56:20,518 --> 00:56:23,403
Finally a girl is no one.

650
00:56:26,775 --> 00:56:30,309
A girl is Arya Stark
of Winterfell

651
00:56:30,412 --> 00:56:32,528
and I'm going home.
