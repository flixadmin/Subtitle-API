1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:06,427
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,223
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,184
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,442
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,777
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:22,281
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,493
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,949
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,705
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,958
Zoom wants you dead.

11
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,459
Do you think he can do
everything really fast?

12
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,749
- How you doing, Dig?
- You're fast.

13
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,417
Welcome to Earth-2.

14
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,965
Dad! No! No!

15
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,597
Caitlin. That is your name isn't it?

16
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,011
I hate the name "Caitlin."

17
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,679
I'm Killer Frost.

18
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,847
Ronnie and Caitlin's
doppelgangers are evil?

19
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,516
If you're coming with us, we have to go.

20
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,103
Cisco!

21
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,773
Get ready to close the breach for good!
Zoom's coming!

22
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,567
No!

23
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,785
He's not dead. He's not dead.

24
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,130
- Caitlin.
- He's not dead. He's not.

25
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:21,836
- Caitlin.
- This isn't happening.

26
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,421
This isn't happening again.

27
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,178
Hey, I got you. Come on.

28
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,598
Open it up.

29
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,847
- Allen.
- I need to go back.

30
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,386
I can't do that.

31
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:35,975
- Open it up!
- Allen!

32
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,891
The breaches are closed.

33
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,569
All the breaches are closed.

34
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,693
Why can't we just open one of them?

35
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,951
The quark matter energy
that we used to seal the breaches,

36
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,491
it prevents them from being opened.

37
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,742
Ever again.

38
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,532
There's no going back to our world.

39
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:57,159
Wait.

40
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,669
We're trapped here for good?

41
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,289
Yes.

42
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,045
Look, we can'tjust let
Zoom get away with this.

43
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,963
He just murdered Jay right in front of us.

44
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,677
There's gotta be something we can do.

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,966
There's not.

46
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,980
Not this time.

47
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,935
It's over.

48
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,903
No.

49
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,505
How's she doing?

50
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,006
Not good.

51
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,263
I tried to get her to go home,
but she refused to leave.

52
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:55,426
So, you know,
I Just sat with her until she fell asleep.

53
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,437
First Ronnie, now Jay.

54
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,272
Yeah.

55
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,775
I'm afraid of what this double dose
of grief is gonna do to her.

56
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,481
I mean, she's pretty shell-shocked.

57
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,194
She'll be fine.

58
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,231
Snow's strong.

59
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:10,948
She'll get past this.

60
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,115
In the meantime,

61
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,282
I would not say anything to her
about her counterpart from my Earth.

62
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,451
That goes for Joe and Iris, too.

63
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,743
Why?

64
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,003
Because you don't wanna
influence their reality

65
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,789
in ways it should not be influenced.

66
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,084
Like in the same way
as when Barry time-travels?

67
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,549
Exactly. But also, what's the point?

68
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,557
Those people are not your people.

69
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,718
Their lives are not your lives.

70
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,352
Never were, never will be.

71
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,060
Bury it, move on.

72
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,149
Yes?

73
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:46,943
Yeah.

74
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,816
That I can do.

75
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,276
Allen?

76
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,294
So that's what we did.

77
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,836
We didn't talk about Earth-2.

78
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,005
We kept what happened there
between the three of us

79
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,511
and got on with our lives

80
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,468
knowing there was nothing
we could do now to stop Zoom.

81
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:28,152
Instead, we tried to just adjust
to our new circumstances

82
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,820
and cope with our losses.

83
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,440
Jay's death took its toll.

84
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,489
Left scars on all of us.

85
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,905
Some more than others.

86
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,210
And so to try and keep
my mind off thoughts

87
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:49,544
of the surreal other life
I experienced that wasn't my own,

88
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,166
I kept running.

89
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,132
Waiting for some other meta-human threat
to rear its ugly head

90
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,047
and distract me
from the frustration I was feeling.

91
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:02,186
And as fate would have it,
I did not have to wait long.

92
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:03,891
All good.

93
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,022
GUNS COCKING

94
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,367
Hey, ugly. It's time for dinner.

95
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,905
I think Bruce has gone belly up.

96
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,826
Power down the grid.

97
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,173
We're gonna have to fish him out.

98
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,221
So this is where Waller kept
all her secret projects, huh?

99
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,311
One of many sites, I'm learning.

100
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,522
Well, I'm sure the
new Director 0fA.R.G.U.S.

101
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,857
Will clean up the mess
that Waller left behind.

102
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,862
Easier said than done, honey.

103
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,147
Hey.

104
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,616
My wife can do anything
she puts her mind to.

105
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:03,243
Code seven in aquaria three.
Irepeat, code seven in aquaria three.

106
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,907
There's been a breach in the aquarium.

107
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,787
You have an aquarium? Why?

108
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,005
What the hell?

109
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,648
Are you kidding me?

110
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,444
Seven, six, five,

111
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:42,282
four, three, two, one.

112
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,661
- Time!
- Yes!

113
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,743
Ain't nobody faster than me!

114
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,000
Well, I don't know about that.

115
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:51,711
Earth to Barry.

116
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,667
It's your turn, dude.

117
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,963
Yeah. It's time to show this little punk

118
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,095
who the fastest Stack Attack-er alive is.

119
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,010
One of you guys go ahead. I'm gonna pass.

120
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,471
You're afraid of a little competition?

121
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,849
No. Just not in a gaming mood right now.

122
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,725
Okay, well, I guess
that makes me the champ.

123
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,068
Right? Whoo.

124
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,564
Uh, anyway, I'm gonna go meet up
with some friends.

125
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,856
All right.

126
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,245
- Bye.
- Bye.

127
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,699
Maybe next time.

128
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,212
And I thought you were the
competitive one in the family.

129
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,843
I know, right? What's up, Barr?

130
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,215
Nothing. Just...

131
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,423
I don't know.
I don't think Wally likes me too much.

132
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,099
Well, we need to fix that.

133
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,729
I mean, you've been so busy running
between alternate realities,

134
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,060
you two haven't had a chance
to spend any time together.

135
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,067
Well, what do you want us to do together?

136
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,732
Get to know each other.

137
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,985
I mean, find something
that you guys have in common.

138
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,941
He's part of the family now, Barr.

139
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,909
You're gonna have to give it a chance.

140
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,074
I know.

141
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,160
Um, all right, well, look,
I'm gonna head to bed, all right?

142
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,324
All right.

143
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,997
- Good night.
- Good night.

144
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,540
Something is up with him,

145
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,758
and I don't think it'sjust Jay's death.

146
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,095
He's been acting weird ever since
he came back from Earth-2.

147
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,973
Did he say anything to you about
what happened over there?

148
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,509
No. Nota thing.

149
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,309
You?

150
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:33,847
Hmm.

151
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,486
Hey, so I've been thinking.

152
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,110
You've been working around the clock,

153
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,446
maybe you wanna get some rest, go home.

154
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,081
You know, a good night's sleep
wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.

155
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,412
I'm fine.

156
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:54,959
Look, I get it.

157
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,586
You're having a hard time
with what happened.

158
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,589
- It's a lot to take so soon after...
- I said I'm fine.

159
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,298
Hey.

160
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,809
- Did you hear that?
- No. What?

161
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,310
Caitlin just bit my head off.

162
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:16,975
She's been all-business-no-emotion lately.
She's been cold.

163
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,568
Cold? Come on, Cisco.

164
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,859
This could be the beginning
of her becoming evil.

165
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,023
You're not worried about that?

166
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,820
I'm not worried about that.
Caitlin's not gonna become Killer Frost.

167
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,243
You haven't mentioned anything
about Earth-2, have you?

168
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,328
No. 'Cause I know how to keep a secret.

169
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,834
All right, well, look, I mean...

170
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,915
It's going to take some time
for her to heal.

171
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,541
We just got to be there for her.

172
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:40,914
Keep her busy.

173
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,874
- That shouldn't be a problem.
- Oh...

174
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,586
Hey, Dig, Lyla.
What are you guys doing here?

175
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,004
We came hereto give you
the heads-up, Barry.

176
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,505
About what?

177
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,595
A meta-human who escaped
from A.R.G.U.S. custody.

178
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,260
Goes by the name King Shark.

179
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,685
King Shark?

180
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,848
You mean, the half-man, half-shark
that tried to kill you months ago?

181
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,061
I thought he was dead.

182
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,773
That's what A.R.G.U.S. wanted you
to believe when they snatched him up.

183
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,188
But believe me,
this half-shark is very much alive.

184
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,028
And his biological imperative
is telling him to do one thing,

185
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,859
that's kill you, Barry.

186
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,703
We're gonna need a bigger Flash.

187
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,798
So how do you know about King Shark?

188
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,709
As the new director ofA.R.G.U.S.,

189
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,378
Lyla's job is to clean up
Amanda Waller's messes.

190
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,547
King Shark was one of the
bigger and weirder ones.

191
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,056
And it appears under her directives,

192
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,219
A.R.G.U.S. had been monitoring meta-human
activity for the past two years.

193
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,932
- Why?
- Well, to see if any of those powers

194
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,813
could be exploited.

195
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,306
Weaponized.

196
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,518
How do you know that he's coming after me?

197
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,525
While in our custody,
he kept saying the same thing.

198
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,652
"Zoom wants The Flash dead."

199
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,530
And although he removed
the tracker we had in him,

200
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,537
the readings we did receive show
that he was headed towards Central City.

201
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,697
Let him come.

202
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,832
Barry, this thing is a killing machine.

203
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,417
We just came here to warn you, man.
Let A.R.G.U.S. handle it.

204
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,954
No, I can't do that, Dig.

205
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,454
I'm sorry, but all year,

206
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,500
we've been sitting ducks for Zoom
and all his Earth-2 henchmen.

207
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,009
This is the last one.

208
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,805
I'm not gonna just wait for him to attack.
I'm going after him first.

209
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,089
I owe that to Jay.

210
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,681
Wells, he's from your Earth.
What do you know about him?

211
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:20,097
Real name is Shay Lamden.
He was a, get this, marine biologist

212
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,766
before my particle accelerator
changed him into King Shark

213
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,934
and Zoom put him under his control.

214
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,274
So how did you track him
when he attacked Barry?

215
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,360
Zoom sent him to this Earth to kill Barry.

216
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,906
I just followed.

217
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,741
Yeah, but you did track Grodd down.
Can you find King Shark, too?

218
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,076
- I can try.
- All right.

219
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,836
Okay, well, all these locations
are next to a body of water.

220
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:43,995
There must only be a few hours

221
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:47,382
before he needs to get back into the water
to re-oxygenate his blood.

222
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,635
I can take the waterfront.
Can you have your team handle the rest?

223
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,887
- I'll get them on it.
- All right.

224
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,758
What about Dr. Lamden's doppelganger?

225
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,392
Maybe he could help us somehow.

226
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,885
Or not.

227
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,896
Um, looks like he died when the
particle accelerator exploded.

228
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,352
What about next of kin?

229
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,688
Uh, he's got a widow, Dr. Tanya Lamden.

230
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,852
She's a research scientist
at Nautilus Labs,

231
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,023
and she studies, wait for it, sharks.

232
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,819
Okay, well, maybe the two of you can go

233
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,656
and see if she's discovered anything
in her research that could help us?

234
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,115
- Yeah.
- Sure.

235
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,370
Great.

236
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:21,991
- Hey, Dig.
- Yeah.

237
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,627
- How's that helmet treating you?
- It could use some improvements.

238
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,412
I'll get to work on it.

239
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,830
Hey, Joe, what's up?

240
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,419
Hey, Barr, ltalked to Wally.

241
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,209
- He wants to meet up with you.
- All right.

242
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,720
He's working on his engineering project
at our place tonight.

243
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,427
He would love some help
from that big brain of yours.

244
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,225
Okay, Joe, look, I'm sorry.
Right now is kind of a crazy time.

245
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,556
Why? What's going on?

246
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:44,598
Remember that meta-human shark
that Patty was after and attacked me?

247
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,688
- He's back? I thought Wells, you know.
- Yeah, me too.

248
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,978
But apparently, A.R.G.U.S. had him
and he escaped.

249
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,612
And now he's heading for Central City.

250
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,816
I get it. Uh, I'll tell Wally
some other time.

251
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,574
Hey, you know what? Um, it's all good.

252
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,489
I'll make it work.
Tell him tonight should be fine.

253
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,833
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

254
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,994
- Thanks, Barr.
- Yeah, bye.

255
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,211
Why?

256
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,555
It's been two years
since your particle accelerator exploded.

257
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,184
Seems a little late to be asking questions
about my husband, doesn't it?

258
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,766
Your husband passed away
from cancer, correct?

259
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,434
I suppose you could say that.

260
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:30,356
It only took three days for every cell
in his body to grow uncontrollably.

261
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:35,945
Whatever cancer he had,
it turned him into something not human.

262
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,859
Well, that's why we're here, actually.

263
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,573
There's a meta-human in Central City

264
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:43,411
whose body seems to be mutating
in the same way as your late husband.

265
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,584
But he didn't die,
he became a dangerous monster.

266
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,791
My husband was no monster.

267
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,747
That's not what she was implying.

268
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,586
What does this have to do with me?

269
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,968
We've read about the research
you're doing here on sharks.

270
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,254
Mmm-hmm. Yeah,
I've had some encouraging results.

271
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,967
Although, still preliminary.

272
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,590
We need to see it.

273
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,134
I beg your pardon?

274
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:03,976
Your research. All of it.

275
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,854
What my colleague means to say is that

276
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,516
if you could please let us
take a look at your findings,

277
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,902
it could help us stop this meta-human
from hurting anyone.

278
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,487
You're with S.T.A.R. Labs.

279
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,274
I'm just supposed to trust you?

280
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,283
Please, Mrs. Lamden.
This could help save lives.

281
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,744
I'll e-mail you what I have.

282
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,417
Thank you.

283
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,248
A little harsh.

284
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,587
I was being direct.

285
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,969
Yeah, well, that's one way to describe it.

286
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:41,681
You've been acting differently toward me
ever since you got back from Earth-2.

287
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,725
What's your problem, Cisco?

288
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,640
Nothing.

289
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,387
Let's just go.

290
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,316
Grid one, negative.

291
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,945
Grid four, negative.

292
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,836
Status check, grid two.

293
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,246
Grid two, negative.

294
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,507
- Anything?
- No, man. Nothing yet.

295
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,508
So far, nothing on our end, either.

296
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,840
I just hope Wells is doing
better than we are.

297
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,925
Hey, how's Felicity doing?

298
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,803
I'm not gonna lie, Barr.
It was pretty rough there at first,

299
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,685
but you know Felicity, she's tough.

300
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,897
Yeah. She's just not
returning any of my calls.

301
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,270
She has a lot going on right now.

302
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,361
But hey, I'll ask her if she can give you
a call when this is all over.

303
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,026
I just want to catch this thing, man.

304
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,442
If everything to do with Zoom and Earth-2
are put behind us,

305
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,077
we could just move on with our lives.

306
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,572
You're starting to do that thing
Oliver does, Barry.

307
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,124
Carry the weight of the world
on your shoulders.

308
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,540
You gotta stop that, man,
or it's going to slow you down.

309
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,209
Still nothing.

310
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,374
Status check, grid six.

311
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,214
Hold on,
I think we got something.

312
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,068
So much for cleaning up
after Waller's messes.

313
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,398
We don't find King Shark soon,

314
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,404
someone's going to be
cleaning up after mine.

315
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,315
We'll find him, Lyla.

316
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,619
All right.
I searched the whole area, he's gone.

317
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,154
He couldn't have gotten far.

318
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,996
Still, he knows we're here now.
We lost the element of surprise.

319
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,748
Not if Wells can figure out a way
to track him.

320
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,418
- In the meantime, we'll keep looking.
- All right.

321
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:41,252
I'll meet up with you guys later.
I gotta go see Joe's son.

322
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,757
Okay. I thought our relationship
was hard to follow.

323
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,343
See ya.

324
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,351
He's fast, John. Get over it.

325
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:52,762
Never.

326
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,943
Joe thought I should have you take a look.

327
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,569
So, this is what I got so far

328
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,659
for my project essay to get into
CCU's engineering program.

329
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:15,960
Turbine supercars?

330
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,454
Turbines. Like jet engines?

331
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,506
Yeah. Yeah, it'd use
an engine like the ones

332
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,635
they have in some helicopters,
only it'd run on biodiesel.

333
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,254
- Cool.
- Lt's very cool.

334
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,132
Yeah, you're gonna wanna address
the fuel economy issue here.

335
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,972
I mean, it is ajet, so it's gonna
burn through a lot of fuel.

336
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,637
Yeah. That's why I wanna use biodiesel.

337
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,772
It'll run off of anything
that burns with oxygen.

338
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:41,566
Okay, we also got a sound issue.
Gonna wake the neighbors for sure.

339
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,650
Anything else?

340
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:46,857
Um...

341
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,654
Well, I Just want to help, you know.

342
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,289
I'm just trying to make sure
they don't have any reason to say "no."

343
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,457
Okay.

344
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,369
Sorry, Wally, I didn't mean...

345
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,588
I mean, it looks really good.

346
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,002
All right, let's start over, okay?

347
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,676
Why don't we go through it
all together? Work it out.

348
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,884
- Sounds good.
- Cool.

349
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,903
This is a complete waste of time.

350
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,906
We're not gonna find anything
in Dr. Lamden's research

351
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,870
to tell us how to find King Shark.

352
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,289
Maybe I should take a look?

353
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,126
Oh, yeah, 'cause you're the doctor
with a specialty in biochem.

354
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:46,213
I'm just saying maybe you could use
another set of eyes, considering...

355
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,674
Considering what?

356
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,554
Considering the way
you've been acting lately.

357
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,298
What does that mean?

358
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,721
You are not yourself, Caitlin.

359
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:58,646
And it's freaking me out
'cause you have this icy look in your eye

360
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,147
just like you did over there.

361
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,149
Over there?

362
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:03,977
You mean Earth-2?

363
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,565
No.

364
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,400
Uh, no. Um...

365
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,908
What I meant to say was, um...

366
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,035
You met my doppelganger, didn't you?

367
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,372
What? No.

368
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,824
Cisco.

369
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,792
Look, I'm not supposed to say anything.

370
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,874
- Why not?
- Because I'm not supposed to say anything.

371
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:26,249
Francisco Ramon,
if you don't start talking...

372
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,510
Okay, fine! Yes, I met your doppelganger.

373
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,263
She's a coldhearted ice queen
named Killer Frost.

374
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,220
A meta-human, who enjoyed killing, a lot.

375
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,009
There.

376
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,600
Great. Now Harry's gonna kill me
and throw my stuff across the room.

377
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:44,142
Cisco, I'm not a meta-human.

378
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,937
Okay, I hear you, but you're acting
just like she did over there.

379
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:51,233
You're being shut off,
you're being detached,

380
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:52,991
you're being cold.

381
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,948
Because I have to be right now.

382
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:59,199
I just watched Jay get killed
right in front of my eyes.

383
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,119
Just when I was starting to
feel normal again.

384
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,629
Just when I was beginning to love him.

385
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,168
So if I let myself feel,

386
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:14,051
if I let all of that pain and anger out,

387
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,181
it's never gonna stop.

388
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,184
And that's not going to help me, either.

389
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,477
So let's just get back to this research

390
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,684
and figure out how to find King Shark.

391
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,731
Okay.

392
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,161
Here you are.

393
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,165
Yep, just like back home. Always working.

394
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,200
I'm trying to relocate this King Shark.

395
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,036
He's here? On this Earth?

396
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,339
Yes. It turns out, ourfriend
Zoom brought him here

397
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,291
to kill The Flash.

398
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,543
Looks like he's stuck here
just like we are.

399
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,884
Yeah, it looks like he is,
and so I have to figure this out

400
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,014
before more people get hurt, Jesse, so...

401
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:03,180
- Probability distribution algorithm?
- Partial matching strategies, yes.

402
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,188
- Based on what?
- Semantic trajectories.

403
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,520
Water, Central City, The Flash.

404
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,686
What about mobility behaviors?

405
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,237
Jesse.

406
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,111
Look, you wanted me out of that room,
but now that I am,

407
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,617
you don't want me here.

408
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,571
Just let me help. Please.

409
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,498
Grab a marker.

410
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,124
Yeah, okay.

411
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,169
Hardest pan' was amping the torque
without increasing drag.

412
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,758
A heavier engine would only
slow things down.

413
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,639
But this streamlined version
should optimize

414
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,596
both the torque and the horsepower.

415
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,557
Yeah. I'm just worried
it won't be enough still.

416
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:45,979
Here, let's do this.

417
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,563
Use a one-to-one transfer gearbox
to drop the output shaft of the engine.

418
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,154
Reverse rotation and send more power
to the torque converter.

419
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,909
I didn't come here for you
to just do it for me.

420
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,403
I thought we were gonna
work on this together.

421
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,570
Yeah, we are.

422
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,705
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to
speed up the process.

423
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,040
Why?

424
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,916
You got somewhere better to be?

425
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,833
No, I'm... Wally.

426
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,798
All right.

427
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,429
Do you have a problem with me?

428
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,307
Who could have a problem with you?

429
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,894
You're Barry, right? You're perfect.

430
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,266
Never do anything wrong.

431
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,685
Always this, always that.

432
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,476
Wally, it's...

433
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,270
I mean, take a look around you, man.

434
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,359
You're in every picture in this room.

435
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:42,154
You know, thanks for your help,
but I'll just take care of this myself.

436
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,455
Where's The Flash?

437
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,930
I know The Flash is here!

438
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,809
Ican smell him.

439
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:11,349
Everybody, get out!

440
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,230
Come on, all right, come on.

441
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,654
Where is he?

442
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,656
Right here!

443
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:32,833
Flash, Zoom wants you dead!

444
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,997
Yeah, I know.

445
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,333
Then you get to go home, right?

446
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,343
Well, guess what, man?

447
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:43,431
The breaches that Zoom used
to bring you here, they're all gone.

448
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,183
I closed them. For good.

449
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:51,473
There's no more Zoom.
There's no way back to your Earth.

450
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:56,190
You're going to be locked up here
for a very long time.

451
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:19,883
You might be fast,
but not as fast as I am in water.

452
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,921
You're not gonna catch me, Flash!

453
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,559
Okay.

454
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,934
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah, I'm good.

455
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:40,442
I think he broke a few things,
but I'm good.

456
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:56,584
I don't suppose my homeowner's insurance
covers a Sharknado attack.

457
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,256
I don't understand you people.

458
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,793
Jaws busts through your house
like the Kool-Aid Man.

459
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,051
The Flash shows up,

460
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,883
and you all just act like
it's no big deal.

461
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,427
Yeah, well, we've had a lot of
weird things happen

462
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,762
In Central City over the past two years.

463
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,519
Weirder than a talking shark
wearing pants?

464
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,430
Man, you'd be surprised.

465
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,809
Hey, hey, you guys.

466
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,651
Everybody Okay?

467
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,357
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

468
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,105
What, did you go hide under your bed?

469
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:24,903
Wally, come on.

470
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,193
You know, Joe and Iris told me
a lot about you.

471
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,486
Made out like you could walk on water
or something,

472
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,827
but they never mentioned anything about
you being a coward.

473
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,575
Okay, enough!

474
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,507
See you guys later.

475
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,219
Dad, you need to talk to him.

476
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,971
No, it's fine. I get it.

477
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,142
Look, I know you guys love me,

478
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:58,148
but please stop telling Wally
all this great stuff about me.

479
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,685
Start telling him the truth.
I'm not perfect.

480
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,229
I make mistakes
that even The Flash can't fix.

481
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,487
Okay.

482
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:09,242
What happened with you on Earth-2?
The truth.

483
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:14,874
I shouldn't tell you guys this, but, um,

484
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,165
I met your doppelgangers.

485
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:22,339
You were the cop in the family.
A good one, too.

486
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:25,167
I told you I would've made a good cop.

487
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,677
Don't get any ideas.

488
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,639
- What about me, then?
- You were a lounge singer.

489
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,101
Yeah, you had this
amazing voice, actually.

490
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,188
Um, but you didn't like me at all.

491
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,099
You actually blamed me
for Iris becoming a cop.

492
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:45,362
Said that she only became one
to help her selfish husband's career.

493
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:49,818
Wait, we were married?

494
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:52,194
Mmm-hmm.

495
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,913
We went to go see Joe perform.

496
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,668
And that's when everything went wrong.

497
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:06,463
Um, some metas that
worked for Zoom showed up.

498
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,629
They were looking for me. They knew
that I wasn't supposed to be there.

499
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,261
And they attacked, and

500
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,727
you got caught in the crossfire and

501
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,103
you died.

502
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:26,233
I knew that it wasn't you,
that none of that was this life,

503
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,854
but

504
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:34,119
watching it happen in front of me,
living that?

505
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:38,832
It didn't feel any different
because it was all still real.

506
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:44,748
And Jay warned me not to get
emotionally sucked in when I went there.

507
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:48,588
And then that's exactly what happened.

508
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,638
And now Joe West on Earth-2 is dead,

509
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,552
because I showed up.

510
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,188
Barr, that's not your fault.

511
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:03,895
Yeah, it is my fault.

512
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,443
It's all my fault.

513
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,194
Zoom,

514
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,652
this King Shark,

515
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,617
Jay's death.

516
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,827
It's all because of me.

517
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:22,164
And then I Just left an entire world
at Zoom's mercy.

518
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:41,478
Just when you thought it was safe
to go back in the suburbs,

519
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,560
King Shark shows up at your house.

520
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,019
I mean, I don't even know how he found me.

521
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,059
It's not like I was The Flash
while I was at home.

522
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,149
- Must be a reason.
- Yeah.

523
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,237
Have you figured out a way
to track King Shark yet?

524
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,946
No. I don't have enough information
to create an accurate location algorithm.

525
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,202
What about Dr. Lamden's research?
Anything that can help us?

526
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,453
I didn't think so at first,

527
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,614
but then I found something
that I think might help us.

528
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,457
Sharks are predators.

529
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:03,663
In order to track their prey,

530
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,044
they use what's known as
passive electro location.

531
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,331
- Passive electro location?
- Yes, it's how they sense

532
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:11,250
the bioelectric potential
around a fish's body.

533
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,669
King Shark senses electricity
in Barry's system.

534
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,505
Okay. That explains how
King Shark can track Barry.

535
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,299
But how is that going to
help us track him?

536
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,433
We flip it.
Instead of King Shark being the predator,

537
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,892
we make him the prey, and we track him
using active electro location.

538
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:27,354
We reprogram our satellite to
generate a specific electric field

539
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,359
and then measure any
electrical distortions

540
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,862
that correlate with a one-ton,
walking shark.

541
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,818
That'll help us get him.

542
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,196
- You'll help me out?
- Sure.

543
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,119
Great. Let us know when you locate him,
and we'll take it from there.

544
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:44,579
Okay.

545
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,084
Let's get the team ready.

546
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,132
What exactly is that?

547
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,935
That, my friend, is bait.

548
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,891
You made a Flash lure?

549
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,477
It's the best I could come up
with given the time frame.

550
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,814
It's rigged to mimic and enhance
the electric field Barry's body generates.

551
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,605
King Shark takes one whiff of that,
cue the Jaws soundtrack.

552
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,115
And I also stuffed it with enough tranqs
to knock him out for a month.

553
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,322
Which should make him
a lot easier to reel in.

554
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,784
And that container, strong enough
to hold him once he's sedated?

555
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,911
It's made of promethium metal.
It's impenetrable.

556
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,202
Meanwhile, we'll be able to keep track
of King Shark with this

557
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,496
and the cameras that are on the lure.

558
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,585
Whatever he does, we'll have eyes on him.

559
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,796
All right, then. Let's go fishing.

560
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:40,931
Caitlin, I don't understand why I can't be
the one playing Quint in this scenario.

561
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,262
I should be the one out there, not you.

562
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,181
I need to do this.

563
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,892
You know Quint dies, right?

564
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,567
Water is this monster's natural habitat.

565
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:58,232
He's gonna be a lot stronger here.
You sure about this?

566
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:00,826
This ends tonight.

567
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,289
Maybe he's not going to fall for this.

568
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,328
He's a shark. He'll come.

569
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,464
Anything, Cisco?

570
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,669
Uh, nope. Nothing that looks like
it could be him.

571
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:20,216
You programed the
satellite though, right?

572
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,505
- Yes, Harry.
- And you punched in

573
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,264
- the correct parameters?
- You're insulting my intelli...

574
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,427
- They could be waiting for hours. You...
- I know they've been out there for hours,

575
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,812
but you're insulting my intelligence
with this, okay? I know.

576
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,231
And you set the
right distortion scope, right?

577
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:32,940
Oh, for real?

578
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,485
Okay, you know what?
We're gonna play a game here.

579
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,108
It's called "lf you're from Earth-2,
you're gonna be quiet."

580
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,739
- Okay?
- Yeah.

581
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,332
Hey, Barry, you okay?

582
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,791
Ever since Zoom beat me here
and on Earth-2,

583
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:58,130
I've been running away from things,
instead of towards them.

584
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,336
That needs to change.

585
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:02,383
We'll get you back there.

586
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,510
I know.

587
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,847
Think of this as your first step. Or swim.

588
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:17,193
Uh, hey, guys, what is that?

589
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,775
The big, big kahuna. Guys, incoming.

590
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:24,909
He's headed for the bait.

591
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:40,000
Whoa.

592
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,335
He ate the lure!

593
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,049
Hey, reel him in, all right?

594
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:46,715
Come on.

595
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,068
Where'd he go?

596
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:00,900
He's headed for the docks.

597
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,777
GO, go:

598
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,487
Get ready to fire!

599
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,844
Those guns won't stop me, Flash.

600
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:27,344
First, I'll kill you.
Then I'll kill them.

601
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:31,268
Oh, yeah? Let's do this then! Come on!

602
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:01,290
- What is he doing?
- He's electrifying the water.

603
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,050
Now we can reel him in.

604
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,190
Hell of a catch, Barry.

605
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,480
Yeah.

606
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,526
Let's just make sure he doesn't become
the "one that got away."

607
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,114
Won't let that happen again.

608
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,278
So what are you gonna do with him?

609
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,742
I don't know yet.

610
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,372
But one thing's for sure.

611
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:20,206
A.R.G.U.S.'s plans to turn King Shark
into a weapon died with Amanda Waller.

612
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:24,256
I think our time would be better served
learning how he came to be

613
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,881
and how to cure him.

614
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,218
You know,
you should really talk to Dr. Lamden.

615
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,630
She's done a lot of research,
and I think it could be helpful to you.

616
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:32,922
I'll do that.

617
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:35,304
- Nice to see you again.
- Mmm-hmm.

618
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,561
Well, thanks a lot, Dig.

619
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,396
Hey, I gotta thank you, Barry.

620
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,446
Got Lyla her first win.
I got to watch you run on water.

621
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,606
It was biblical.

622
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:57,080
Look, Barry, when I was in Afghanistan,
I lost a lot of friends.

623
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:58,956
Brothers.

624
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,250
So losing Jay, I know what it feels like.

625
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,041
Question yourself,

626
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,047
blame yourself for his death.

627
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,085
And that guilt, it can tear you apart.

628
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,259
Trust me, man,
you gotta get control of it,

629
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,266
or it'll rip you up inside.

630
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,394
Use this, man. Let it guide you,

631
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,438
so it never happens again.

632
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,816
- All right, thanks, man.
- You got it.

633
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,227
- Say hi to everyone for me, all right?
- I will.

634
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,576
Yeah, okay, that's kind of freaky.

635
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,456
Yeah, yeah. See? I told you.

636
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,787
Hey, Oliver, what's up?

637
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,378
You're a really slow reader.

638
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:58,137
- So?
- I want one of these supercars.

639
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,473
I mean, especially if I can run it off
the bacon grease I collect.

640
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:06,229
Man, Wally, I'm so impressed.

641
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:10,737
Thanks. But Barry gave me
a lot of help, so...

642
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,399
Yeah, he did, but this was all your idea.
This is all your hard work.

643
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,819
It's all you.
Barry would say the same thing.

644
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:19,158
Would he?

645
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,659
Look, Wally.

646
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,250
Iris and I took Barry in

647
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,169
when he was 11.

648
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,843
And the reason he came to live with us
is because

649
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:34,886
his mother was murdered,

650
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:38,265
and his father was
wrongfully imprisoned for it.

651
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,677
And I have been overprotective
of that kid since that day.

652
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:46,724
We gave him all the love

653
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,809
and support he needed
to get through that tragedy

654
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:53,196
and become the man he is now.

655
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,487
So that pride

656
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,990
you see when Iris and I
are talking about him

657
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:04,078
is because things could have gone
very differently.

658
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,253
But he's not perfect.

659
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,628
And he's not favored
over you, or Iris, or anybody else.

660
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,968
So you have nothing to worry about.

661
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,051
He's my son.

662
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,176
Just like you are.

663
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,939
What are you doing with those?

664
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,894
I'm adjusting the wavelength trigger to
see if I can get these to work over here.

665
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,937
So you can catch some breachers?

666
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,649
Dear God, Caitlin,
your hands are freezing!

667
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:41,241
"Caitlin." I've always hated that name.

668
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,663
Oh, no!

669
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,666
No, no, no. It's starting.
You're starting to become...

670
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,293
Killer Frost?

671
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,248
That ain't right.

672
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,588
That ain't right. That's just rude.
Who put you up to this?

673
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,595
Barry put you up to this, didn't he?
Oh, I should've known.

674
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,347
- You two are...
- Cold?

675
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:02,632
Yeah.

676
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:06,303
You deserve it for thinking that
I could ever become like her.

677
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,518
Cisco, you need to stop worrying about me.

678
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,650
I may be sad, I may want to be alone
for a little while,

679
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,106
but I promise you

680
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:17,773
Killer Frost will never exist
on this Earth, okay?

681
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:21,409
Besides, you tested me.
I don't even have the meta-human gene.

682
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,619
So please stop worrying about me, okay?

683
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,289
Okay.

684
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:29,956
Come on, Barry wants us upstairs.

685
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,330
For real though,
you gotta work on that circulation.

686
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,670
You might have Raynaud's or something?
You know what Raynaud's is?

687
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,005
I'm a doctor, Cisco.

688
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,806
Hail, hail, the gang's all here.

689
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,465
What's good?

690
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,301
Uh...

691
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,806
I need to apologize to you all.

692
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:53,266
Um...

693
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:58,647
Last year, I made a choice
to go back in time

694
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,315
and save my mother.

695
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,194
And that choice had

696
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:08,115
a lot of consequences that will haunt me
for the rest of my life,

697
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,201
just like I know
it haunts all of you, too.

698
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,668
Zoom.

699
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,842
Jay's death.

700
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,387
It's all because of me.

701
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,475
But I own those choices.

702
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,977
We're the ones
who opened the door to Earth-2.

703
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,888
We're the ones who brought Zoom here.

704
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,775
But we are also the ones
who are gonna stop him.

705
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,235
How?

706
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,405
How are we going to stop Zoom, Allen?

707
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,317
I don't know yet.

708
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:52,914
But those breaches aren't closed forever,
and we're not done with Earth-2.

709
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:03,378
Jay's death was not in vain.

710
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,382
We will meet Zoom again.

711
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,718
And the next time,

712
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,518
I will beat him.

713
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,890
Whoever that monster is.

714
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:53,762
Well, this is a complication.
