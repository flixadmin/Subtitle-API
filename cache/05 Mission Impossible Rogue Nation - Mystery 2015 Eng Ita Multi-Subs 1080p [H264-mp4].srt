2
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,365
Benji?

3
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,570
Benji, do you copy?

4
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,576
Benji?

5
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,142
Shit.
Where is Ethan?

6
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,868
Uh, I can't talk right now.

7
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,576
The package is on the plane.

8
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,376
Yeah, I know.

9
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,116
We're currently formulating a plan B.
Although, technically, it's a plan C.

10
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,696
This isn't going very well.

11
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,856
I am aware of that, Brandt.
You're not helping.

12
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,536
- Where's Ethan?
- I don't know. We're on radio silence.

13
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,076
That plane cannot take off
with the package on it.

14
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,296
- Do you understand?
- We're working on it.

15
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,276
Luther?
What the hell are you doing there?

16
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,336
You're supposed to be
on assignment in Malaysia!

17
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,096
I am in Malaysia.
I've been here two days.

18
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,096
- Benji needed my help.
- I didn't need help.

19
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,656
I needed assistance.
It's a different thing.

20
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,467
The package is still on the plane.

21
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,396
We understand the package
is on the plane.

22
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,816
- We're trying to cripple it remotely.
- You can do that?

23
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,496
We can if the pilot left
the satellite uplink switched on.

24
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,696
Which he has.

25
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,256
- And how do you access the uplink?
- It involves hacking a Russian satellite.

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,416
- I can't authorize that.
- Which is why I didn't ask permission.

27
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,936
We're under investigation
for misconduct.

28
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,216
The package is on board.
What do you want me to do?

29
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,136
Uh, Luther.

30
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,896
I'm reading
a heat bloom, Benji.

31
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,416
- The engines are starting.
- Yeah, I'm aware of that.

32
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,645
But I can't do anything
until I'm connected to the satellite.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,176
Benji, you're connected.

34
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,683
Okay, great.

35
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,680
The package is still on that plane.

36
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,083
Shut down the fuel pump.

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,376
Uh, the mechanicals
are locked down.

38
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,096
- What about the electrical system?
- Oh, that might work.

39
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,216
Uh, no.

40
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,216
- Hydraulics!
- Okay, stand by.

41
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,073
No, they're encrypted.

42
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,856
Benji, the plane!

43
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,693
Yes! The package is on the plane!
We get it!

44
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,348
Can you open the door?

45
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,536
Ethan? Where are you?

46
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,216
I'm by the plane.
Benji, can you open the door?

47
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,056
Uh, can I open the door? Uh, maybe.

48
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,207
Open the door when I tell you!

49
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,056
I'm on the plane. Open the door.

50
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,616
How did you get in the plane?

51
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,376
Net in the plane.
I'm on the plane!

52
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,527
Open the door!

53
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,105
Benji! Open the door!

54
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,656
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay!

55
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,801
- Benji, open that door right now!
- Yeah, I'm trying!

56
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,466
Come on, Benji!
Benji, open that door!

57
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,728
Come on! Come on!

58
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,896
Come on!

59
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,250
Yes, got it!

60
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,256
That's the wrong door!

61
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,407
Benji, not that door. The other door.

62
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,336
The other door, right!
Yes, the other door.

63
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,536
Okay, yes! Sorry, my bad, my bad!

64
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,010
Check it out.

65
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,747
All right, look, I'm gonna open
the para door! How's that?

66
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,565
Hey! Hey!

67
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,856
We're about to close.

68
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,517
I won't be long.

69
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,475
Are you looking for anything
in particular?

70
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,621
Something rare.

71
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,713
Let me guess.

72
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,610
Classical.

73
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,836
- Jazz.
Sax?

74
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,936
- Coltrane.
- Piano?

75
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,191
Monk.

76
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,936
Shadow Wilson on bass.

77
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,619
Shadow Wilson played drums.

78
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,816
Know why they call him Shadow?

79
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,793
Because he had a light touch.

80
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,936
You're in luck.

81
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,781
I have a first pressing.

82
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,910
It really is you.

83
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,302
I've heard stories.

84
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,111
They can't all be true.

85
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,776
Good evening, Mr. Hunt.

86
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,656
The weapons you recovered in Belarus
were confirmed to be VX nerve gas

87
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,947
capable of devastating a major city.

88
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,016
The bodies of the air crew were found

89
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,016
less than 24 hours
after they landed in Damascus.

90
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,176
They were identified as
low-level Chechen separatists

91
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,096
with neither the access nor the ability

92
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,737
to acquire the weapons
they were transporting.

93
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,856
This would support your suspicion

94
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,216
that a shadow organization
is committed to inciting revolution

95
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,376
by enabling acts of terror
in nations friendly to Western interests.

96
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,456
IMF suspects this to be
the same shadow organization

97
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,696
you have been tracking for the last year,

98
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,043
also known as the Syndicate.

99
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,536
IMF would be right.

100
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,656
Normally, you and your team
would be tasked

101
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,736
with infiltrating and disrupting
this terrorist network.

102
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,456
But we have taken steps to ensure
that this will not happen.

103
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,136
Because we are
the Syndicate, Mr. Hunt.

104
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,896
And now we know who you are.

105
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,896
Your mission, should you choose
to accept it, is to face your fate.

106
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,056
Pursue us, you will be caught.
Resist us, you will be killed.

107
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,136
And your precious Secretary will
disavow any knowledge of your actions.

108
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,496
Good luck, Mr. Hunt.

109
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,256
This message will self-destruct
in five seconds.

110
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,296
Mr. Chairman,
the IMF's misadventures date back

111
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,216
to my earliest days at the CIA

112
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,976
when the IMF broke into the CIA
to steal a list of covert operatives.

113
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,976
And now, more recently,
a Russian warhead?

114
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,136
Disarmed Russian warhead.

115
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,536
- A Russian nuclear warhead...
Rendered safe by the IMF.

116
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,736
clipped the Transamerica Pyramid

117
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,556
before plunging into
the San Francisco Bay.

118
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,459
- Saving the western hemisphere.
- This made possible by IMF agents

119
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,536
who did willingly provide
the launch codes to a known terrorist.

120
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,400
Do I have that right, Agent Brandt?

121
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,776
I can neither confirm nor deny details

122
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,136
of any such operation
without the Secretary's approval.

123
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,056
This was the same week that the IMF
infiltrated the Kremlin.

124
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,759
Here is the Kremlin before

125
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,493
and the Kremlin after.

126
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,476
I can neither confirm nor deny details
of any operation...

127
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,616
Without the Secretary's approval,
yes, we know.

128
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,016
In fact, until this panel appoints
a new Secretary,

129
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,536
you really can't say much of anything,
can you, Agent Brandt?

130
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,096
Well, I didn't write the rules, Mr. Hunley.

131
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,936
Mr.. Chairman,
the so-called Impossible Mission Force

132
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,136
is not just a rogue organization.

133
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,136
It is an outdated one, a throwback
to an era without transparency

134
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,736
- and without oversight.
- Mr. Chairman?

135
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,416
- Time has come to dissolve the IMF...
- Mr. Chairman?

136
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,856
And transfer their salvageable assets
to the CIA.

137
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,936
Mr. Chairman, the IMF has operated
without oversight for 40 years.

138
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,696
- Mr. Chairman?
- Are its methods unorthodox? Yes.

139
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,696
Are its results less than perfect?
Absolutely.

140
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,416
- But without the IMF...
- There will be order and stability!

141
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,119
Without the IMF...

142
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,620
This panel recognizes
the IMF's contribution to global security.

143
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,216
But the events laid out
by CIA Director Hunley

144
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,216
also show a pattern
of wanton brinkmanship

145
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,136
and a total disregard for protocol.

146
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,976
From where I sit,
your unorthodox methods

147
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,416
are indistinguishable from chance.

148
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,340
And your results, perfect or not,
look suspiciously like luck.

149
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,860
I'm afraid today is the day
when the IMF's luck runs out.

150
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,270
What are you doing here?

151
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,751
Hmm?

152
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,533
I said, what are you doing here?

153
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,363
What does he see in you, I wonder?

154
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,456
Who is he?

155
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,245
I want to see what he's made of.

156
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,898
Well, why don't you
take off the cuffs and I'll show you,

157
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,508
Vinter?

158
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,216
You know who I am.

159
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,311
Janik Vinter.

160
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,416
They call you the Bone Doctor.

161
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,883
The funny thing is,

162
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,656
you were officially declared dead
three years ago.

163
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,968
Nice shoes, by the way.

164
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,671
Not his.

165
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,045
Yours.

166
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,965
Our instructions were to break him down...

167
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,736
not kill him.

168
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,096
Some guys break different than others.

169
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,331
This one's a fighter.

170
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,896
He'll die before you turn him.

171
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,287
Are you worried
he's going to take your place?

172
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,677
You should go before it gets ugly.

173
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,949
Yeah, he's right. You should go.

174
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,643
So now let's see how tough you are.

175
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,296
Janik.

176
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,216
We've never met before, right?

177
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,791
Follow me.

178
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,330
Give me the gun!

179
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,056
- What are you doing?
- I can't leave.

180
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,136
You can't stay.
We just killed those men.

181
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,656
We didn't kill them, you did.

182
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,633
I tried to stop you. You got away.

183
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,902
Who are you?

184
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,736
You better hurry now. Good luck.

185
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,816
No, wait! Wait!

186
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,290
Where is he?

187
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,856
He's heading towards the north passage.
He's closed the gate.

188
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,042
Run. He's getting away. HURRY.

189
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,416
- Satcom seven.
- Western Europe unsecured.

190
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,656
- Designator?
- Bravo-Echo-1-1.

191
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,911
Connecting.

192
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,102
- This is Brandt.
- Go secure.

193
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,616
Go.

194
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,776
London terminal is compromised.
Repeat, London is compromised.

195
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,856
Agent in place is down.
Request immediate extraction.

196
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,776
What happened?
Who breached London?

197
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,336
Do you have anything to go on?

198
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,736
A face.

199
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,816
He wanted something. Not information.
He could've killed me.

200
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,128
But he didn't.

201
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,176
- Okay. What do you think it means?
- The Syndicate is real.

202
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,936
They know who we are, how we operate.

203
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,776
I think I know why
they've been so hard to find.

204
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,456
Just focus operations on gathering
any available intel regarding

205
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,936
former covert operatives.

206
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,096
It doesn't matter
what country or agency,

207
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,456
just as long as they're dead
or presumed dead.

208
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,896
Start with Janik Vinter.

209
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,016
He's also known as the Bone Doctor.

210
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,456
I can't do that.

211
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,041
What? What are you talking about?

212
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,776
The Committee has shut us down.

213
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,711
Operations have been handed over
to the CIA.

214
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,668
There is no more IMF.
I've been ordered to bring everyone in.

215
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,296
- Ethan...
- I understand.

216
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,376
- Ethan...
- I understand, Brandt.

217
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,233
We didn't have this conversation.

218
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,656
I've disappeared in London.
You don't know where I am.

219
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,416
If I'm dead or alive.

220
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,280
This man you saw, can you find him?

221
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,502
I won't stop until I do.

222
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,376
This may very well be
our last mission, Ethan.

223
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,037
Make it count.

224
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,725
Brandt?

225
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,536
Since we're going
to be working together,

226
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,816
I want you to choose
your next words very carefully.

227
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,136
Where is Hunt?

228
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,056
- I don't know.
- Don't lie to me, Brandt.

229
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,656
I have no way of contacting him.
He's deep cover.

230
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,816
Last I heard,
he's tracking the Syndicate.

231
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,136
Let's out the bull. You know who we are,
you know what we're capable of.

232
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,896
How come the CIA has never discovered

233
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,976
any actionable intel
regarding this, uh, Syndicate?

234
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,696
- What are you implying?
- Not implying. Stating.

235
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,976
Levelling an accusation, actually.

236
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,496
Hunt is both arsonist and fireman
at the same time.

237
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,176
I believe that the Syndicate
is a figment of his imagination,

238
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,496
created to justify the IMF's existence.

239
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,936
I am going to find him, Brandt,
and when I do,

240
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,696
he will be called upon to answer for

241
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,806
every wanton act of mayhem
he is responsible for.

242
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,633
Welcome to the CIA.

243
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,536
You'll never find him.

244
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,460
Set your watch, Brandt. Ethan Hunt
is living his last day as a free man.

245
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,387
All right, everybody, heads up! This is it.

246
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,616
Alpha team prepped standing by.

247
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,696
Execute.

248
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,415
Langley, Brimstone. Go.
I say again, we are go.

249
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,113
Langley, there's nobody here.

250
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,792
Langley, Brimstone. Face the north wall.

251
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,028
Dunn.

252
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,409
Is it that time already? Okay.

253
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,216
I will ask you
a series of control questions.

254
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,896
I know,
and I'm gonna answer truthfully,

255
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,336
and then you're gonna ask me
to lie intentionally.

256
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,313
- State your name.
- The King of Norway.

257
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,050
See, that's a lie.

258
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,736
I'm actually third in line to the throne.
My brother was...

259
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,256
Has Ethan Hunt contacted you?

260
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,296
Why would he Contact me?

261
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,456
Hunt has resurfaced.

262
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,176
This time in Cuba.

263
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,853
He, uh, left these behind.

264
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,416
Tell me what you make of them.

265
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,656
I don't know. He's taken up
scrap booking?

266
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,359
Look at the photographs, Dunn.

267
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,216
All of them are either missing or dead.
Every one.

268
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,056
All of them were government agents.

269
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,697
Russian, French, British, Israeli,
you name it.

270
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,576
These are highly classified files and yet
Hunt had no trouble collecting them.

271
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,096
And he always seems to be
a step ahead of us.

272
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,496
I wonder how.

273
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,816
- Are you suggesting I'm helping him?
- Oh, the thought had crossed my mind.

274
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,496
Six months I have been here,

275
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,736
sifting through mountains of metadata
and exabytes of encoded excrement.

276
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,016
I have decrypted, processed, parsed
more data than anyone in my section.

277
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,976
And yet, every week you haul me in here

278
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,936
and you ask me the same question,
just in a different way.

279
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,416
And today you haven't answered it.

280
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,936
You seem to think
I have some kind of obligation to him.

281
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,536
Okay. Nothing could be further
from the truth.

282
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,616
Ethan Hunt is still out there in the field,

283
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,041
and I am stuck here answering for it.

284
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,333
We are not friends.

285
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,730
I owe him nothing.

286
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,667
That'll be all, Dunn.

287
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,496
Welcome to Vienna, Benji Miss me?

288
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,896
Ethan, where are you?
Where the hell have you been?

289
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,856
You know what?
Please, don't tell me that.

290
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,896
Because it's just another thing I'll have
to lie about in my weekly polygraph.

291
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,976
Everything's gonna be fine.
Just keep walking.

292
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,136
But make sure
you're not being followed.

293
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,176
I didn't win those opera tickets, did I?

294
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,656
No, I'm afraid not.

295
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,296
- So, where do we meet?
- We don't.

296
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,936
For your sake,
we shouldn't be seen together.

297
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,288
You have mail.

298
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,776
Who is he?
That's what

299
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,896
we're here to find out.

300
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,176
What I do know is he's our
only possible link to the Syndicate.

301
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,056
And I have reason to believe
he's going to be here tonight.

302
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,696
But I can't find him alone. Are you in?

303
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,456
- Uh...
- Are you in?

304
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,551
Yes, of course. Of course. Um...

305
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,816
So what's the play?

306
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,696
Simple. You find him. We tag him.
I follow him wherever he goes.

307
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,936
And after that?

308
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,456
After that, you're on a plane.

309
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,936
Back at work Monday morning.
No one is the wiser.

310
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,136
- Wait, that's it?
- You he in enough danger as it is.

311
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,776
I didn't want to involve you this much,
but I had no choice.

312
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,456
Well, if you're going to bring me
all this way,

313
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,976
you could at least give me something
a bit more, you know, dramatic.

314
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,009
Benji, we're trying to keep a low profile.

315
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,717
You want drama, go to the opera.

316
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,098
- Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
- Yes, I am.

317
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,816
Am I correct in assuming
that is the Chancellor of Austria?

318
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,336
Yes, you are.

319
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,176
Did you know
he was going to be here?

320
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,216
No.

321
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,256
Right. Well, we have
a European head of state here

322
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,136
at the same time as we are looking
for a nefarious terrorist.

323
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,936
And I'm sure that the two things
are completely unrelated.

324
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,016
Benji.

325
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,696
Meanwhile, I will try and overlook
the fact that

326
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,416
you're an international fugitive
wanted by the CIA!

327
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,856
And that this little unsanctioned
operation is tantamount to treason.

328
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,616
Because, as you stated earlier, I will be
back at my desk on Monday morning,

329
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,256
playing video games,
and no one will be any the wiser.

330
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,736
- The show's about to start, Benji.
- Right.

331
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,056
Just take your position.

332
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,536
- Tell me What you see.
- Okay.

333
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,296
Nice tux, by the way.

334
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,936
Lights ready, Act One preset.

335
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,336
Final preparations complete.

336
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,942
Everyone standby please.

337
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,336
Join the IMF! See the world!

338
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,663
On a monitor. In a closet.

339
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,117
Okay, I have eyes.

340
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,433
Searching.

341
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,576
Talk to me, Benji.

342
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,433
Nothing yet. Stand by.

343
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,318
I know you're here. Where are you?

344
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,736
Uh, Ethan, I might have
something for you. Can't confirm.

345
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,887
- Where?
- Backstage. I'll direct you.

346
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,056
Take the door on your left.

347
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,207
He should be right in front of you.

348
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,736
Benji, do you see that?

349
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,285
See what?

350
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,736
- That woman.
- What woman? Where are you?

351
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,342
I can't see you.

352
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,456
What was that?

353
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,257
I don't know.

354
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,736
Oh! Ah!

355
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,222
Ethan, do you copy? Ethan, come in!

356
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,616
Ethan, the lighting booth!

357
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,319
Ethan, do you copy?

358
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,145
It's just a flesh wound.

359
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,159
Seal the building. Close the exits.

360
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,231
I have a way out. Interested?

361
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,953
Lead the way.

362
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,376
- Anything you want to tell me?
- Uh, no, not right now.

363
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,156
- How's the pace?
- Don't wait for me.

364
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,616
What's next?

365
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,391
There.

366
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,163
Shoes.

367
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,393
Shoes, please.

368
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,616
Uh...

369
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,060
If anything were to happen to you...

370
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:01,016
Nothing's going to happen to me.

371
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,290
Get in!

372
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,803
Go, go, go.

373
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,376
What the... She tried to shoot me!

374
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,765
That doesn't make her a bad person.

375
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,736
I'm going to have to Search you.

376
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,416
- You have to let me go.
- Oh. Not a chance!

377
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,216
I assumed you were deep cover
back in London,

378
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,016
but isn't this taking
the role a little far?

379
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,576
Hang on a minute. Do you know her?

380
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,096
We haven't been formally introduced,

381
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,736
but I'm pretty sure
she's British intelligence?

382
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,419
Ilsa Faust. You're Ethan Hunt.

383
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:50,101
And that shade is very hard to find.

384
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,176
What were you doing
at the opera tonight?

385
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,776
Aside from killing the Chancellor.

386
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,216
Saving your life in London
put me in a tight spot

387
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,256
with some very dangerous people.

388
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,656
I was sent to kill the Chancellor
to regain their trust.

389
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,416
Ah, so you admit that you killed him!

390
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,616
I went through the motions.
That's not the same thing.

391
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,336
You thought you'd put him
in the hospital,

392
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,776
take him out of harm's way.

393
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,176
Same thing you tried to do.

394
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,416
You're not going to
believe that, are you?

395
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,856
What about the rest of her team?

396
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,776
You mean those other two idiots.

397
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,616
I can only assume
they were redundancies.

398
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,390
In case you didn't follow through.
One man to kill the Chancellor,

399
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,577
the other one to kill you.

400
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,576
- A test.
- Second one I've failed, thanks to you.

401
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,553
And the car bomb was insurance.

402
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,963
Uh, we have a tail.

403
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,757
Who is he?

404
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,136
We're after the same thing,
and I can help you.

405
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,976
If you want to bring down the Syndicate,
you have to let me out.

406
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,330
Uh, they're closing!

407
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,576
This has to look like an escape,
so you just throw me out anywhere.

408
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,096
Tell me who he is.

409
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,408
Whoa!

410
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,627
Change of plan! Throw her out!

411
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,963
You have everything you need
to find me.

412
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,136
Less than 24 hours

413
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,684
after we interviewed Benji Dunn
about Ethan Hunt,

414
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,616
he was on a plane to Vienna
with tickets to the opera.

415
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,616
And within six hours of his arrival,
the Chancellor was dead.

416
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,056
Now, that might be circumstance
to some public defender,

417
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,096
but to the CIA,
that is actionable intelligence.

418
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,216
Consider for the moment
the possibility that.

419
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,696
Ethan's investigation
led him to the opera,

420
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,416
and that he's the one
with the actionable intelligence!

421
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,616
In any case, finding Hunt
is no longer a pet project.

422
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:46,077
The Special Activities Division
will now have full discretion.

423
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,730
You mean shoot to kill.

424
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,860
Whether Hunt lives or dies
is entirely up to him.

425
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,296
New identity.

426
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,776
Passport, cash, move map.

427
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,176
There's a change of clothes
in that bag right there.

428
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,176
Everything you need
to make it to D.C. undetected.

429
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,461
Once you're there,
you have to inform on me.

430
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,736
- I'm sorry, what?
- Just tell the truth.

431
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,656
You came to Vienna believing
you won two tickets to the opera.

432
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,296
I attempted to recruit you
into assassinating the Chancellor.

433
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,856
- You refused.
- That's not the truth!

434
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,296
Your life depends on
them believing you, Benji.

435
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,616
It'll go easier
if you tell them what they want to hear.

436
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,978
Ethan, at least tell me
what this is all about.

437
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,017
You recognize anyone?

438
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,136
Him.

439
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,336
He's former KSA. German intelligence.

440
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,193
Missing, presumed dead.

441
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,816
He was at the opera tonight.

442
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,536
This one, too.

443
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,136
Former Mossad.

444
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,056
Let me guess. Presumed dead.

445
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,913
Tonight, I made it official.

446
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,776
I was looking for him in the Bosphorus.

447
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,083
The same day, a car accident
killed the visiting President of Malawi.

448
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,785
He slipped away again in Jakarta,

449
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,296
hours before a passenger plane
vanished over the Pacific

450
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,076
with 238 passengers.

451
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,736
I just missed him in the Philippines

452
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,016
right before a fire
at a petrochemical plant

453
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,461
gassed a village of 2,000 people.

454
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,436
You're saying these accidents
are somehow connected.

455
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,355
That missing plane was carrying
the Secretary of the World Bank.

456
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,021
That fire bankrupted
a global arms corporation.

457
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,561
That wreck triggered a civil war.

458
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,033
These are no accidents.

459
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,976
They're links in a chain.

460
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,989
The work of a single organization,
the Syndicate.

461
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,496
A rogue nation,
trained to do what we do,

462
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,256
imbued with a new sense of purpose.

463
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:59,164
Destroy the system that created them
regardless of who's in their way.

464
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,070
An anti-IMF.

465
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,016
Since Hunley shut us down,
they've been escalating unchecked.

466
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,616
Killing the Chancellor tonight
was a statement,

467
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,670
the start of a new phase.

468
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:15,318
Or they could just be
a series of random disasters.

469
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,351
He was there.

470
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,856
Every time.

471
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,636
Just like he was there tonight,
I'm sure of it.

472
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,773
I don't know who he is, where he's from,

473
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,776
how he's funded.

474
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,776
But I know he's the key.

475
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,656
Ethan, this is what I signed up for.
Let me help you find him.

476
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,536
That's why I brought you here
in the first place,

477
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,136
and look what happened!

478
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,936
I can't protect you.

479
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,016
That's why I need you to leave.

480
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,202
That's not your decision to make, Ethan!

481
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,976
I am afield agent. I know the risks.

482
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,696
More than that, I am your friend,

483
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,736
no matter what I tell
the polygraph every week.

484
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,776
Now, you called me
because you needed my help.

485
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,655
And you still do. So I am staying.

486
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,855
And that is all
we are going to say about that.

487
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,751
Okay.

488
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,128
Good.

489
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,108
Where do we start?

490
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,468
Ilsa.

491
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,319
Right. And how do we find her?

492
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,879
She said we have everything we need.

493
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,456
We had an agreement.

494
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,976
You send me to do a job, I do it.
But my way, not yours.

495
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,416
Where did I deviate?

496
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,496
You put two more gunmen
at the opera tonight.

497
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,045
One of them tried to kill me.

498
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,336
You missed.

499
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,056
I missed because Ethan Hunt was there
looking for you.

500
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,496
Ethan Hunt's in Vienna because
you allowed him to escape in London.

501
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,467
Vinter would have killed him in London,
and that's not what you asked for.

502
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,649
Twice now you've let him slip away.

503
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,185
Curious.

504
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,837
Are you questioning my loyalty
or my ability?

505
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:38,056
- Can't decide.
- I've told you before, trust me or kill me.

506
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,236
But if you're going to kill me, be a man.

507
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,916
Do it yourself.

508
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,247
Did he say anything?

509
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,656
He knows about Morocco.

510
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,905
What does he know about Morocco?

511
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:24,851
He knows about the power plant.
He doesn't know what's in it.

512
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,083
Find him, please.

513
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,417
He'll find me.

514
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,333
I've seen to that.

515
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,576
That's interesting.

516
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,176
- What is it?
- It's a skiff.

517
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,136
A secure computer facility.
Offline, ultra-contained.

518
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,136
It's impossible to hack into
from the outside.

519
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,816
It's essentially
a digital safety deposit box.

520
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,456
Very strange thing for a young lady
to be carrying in her sundries.

521
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,776
Where's it located?

522
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,976
Uh...

523
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,330
Morocco.

524
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,685
Morocco.

525
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,450
And what brings you gentlemen
to Casablanca?

526
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,936
Good to see you.

527
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,815
What couldn't you tell me
over the phone?

528
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,856
The Chancellor of Austria
was assassinated.

529
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,776
We believe that
Ethan and Benji were there.

530
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,690
Hunley has handed this over
to the Special Activities Division.

531
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,969
We need to find Ethan before they do.

532
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,356
And that's where you come in.

533
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,879
Not interested.

534
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,736
- Okay, look, Luther...
- Look, man, I know Ethan.

535
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,285
I don't know you.

536
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,776
All I know about you
is that you chose to work for Hunley.

537
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,816
Yeah. All I know about you
is you chose to resign.

538
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:29,296
You don't have to worry
about Ethan. They'll never catch him.

539
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,136
No, they're not gonna catch him. No.

540
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,616
This is the CIA.
This is Hunley we're talking about.

541
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:37,489
Things are out of control.
No, they're going to kill him.

542
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:41,002
They're going to kill Ethan.
They're going to kill Benji.

543
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,519
We have to get to them first.
Are you going to help me?

544
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,447
You need to understand something.

545
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,090
Ethan is my friend.

546
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:01,569
And if I have one second of doubt
whose side you're on...

547
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,385
Mmm?

548
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,297
I believe you.

549
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,616
- All right.
- All right.

550
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,928
What do I have to go on?

551
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,903
Not much. And not a lot of time.

552
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,596
His name is Solomon Lane.

553
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,045
He created the Syndicate.

554
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,810
Where does he come from?

555
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,071
He's former British intelligence.

556
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,536
Well, if British intelligence knows
the Syndicate exists,

557
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,696
why don't they just tell the CIA?

558
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,536
Because they don't want
anyone knowing

559
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:37,213
the Syndicate was created
by one of their own.

560
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,216
I was sent undercover
to earn Lane's trust

561
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,536
and eventually identify the members
of his organization.

562
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:48,460
And for the first time in two years,
I'm close to knowing who they are.

563
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,136
Lane had a ledger.

564
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,336
It contained the identities of
his operatives, his terrorist associates,

565
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:57,096
the entire inner workings
of the Syndicate.

566
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,216
One of his agents stole it,
hoping to blackmail him,

567
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,416
and kept it in a secure computer facility
for safekeeping.

568
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,216
He died being interrogated
for the access code,

569
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,367
leaving Lane with a serious problem.

570
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,736
So the key to crushing Lane

571
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,455
is sitting in a computer,
just waiting for someone to take it.

572
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:22,016
So, why hasn't Lane
just sent someone to steal it?

573
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,622
Oh, he has.

574
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,796
He sent me.

575
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,865
And I can tell you

576
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,917
it's impossible.

577
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:38,376
The facility's hidden beneath
a local power plant under military guard.

578
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,256
And the only way to download the ledger

579
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,778
is through the central
computer terminal, located there.

580
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,625
To reach the terminal,
you'll need to pass the main gate,

581
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,339
access the elevator
with fingerprint recognition,

582
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,690
and open
three separate combination locks.

583
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,016
BENJ: Well, that's easy.
We just impersonate the agent

584
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,457
who stole the ledger in the first place,
and I get to wear a mask!

585
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,576
Unfortunately, even if you could
make it through

586
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,816
every other security measure,
you won't beat the last one.

587
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,136
That's because it's protected
by gait analysis.

588
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,456
The step beyond facial recognition.

589
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,056
These cameras actually know
how the agent walks,

590
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,053
how he talks, how he moves.

591
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,443
Right down to his facial tics.

592
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,976
So, what you're saying is
no mask can beat it.

593
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,296
We're busted before we even get
into the vault,

594
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,736
and I wind up in a Moroccan jail,

595
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,416
playing mummies and daddies
with Ahmad the Strangler.

596
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,371
Okay, I don't get to wear a mask.

597
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,216
And there's no other way
into the computer lab?

598
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,536
No other way in.

599
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,816
- Air shaft?
- Six-inch-diameter pipe.

600
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:09,856
Foundation?

601
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,105
Twelve feet of concrete, top and bottom.

602
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:13,696
- Electrical conduit.
- Electrical conduit.

603
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,496
Bottom line is there's no way
into that terminal

604
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,216
unless your profile is pre-installed
in the security system.

605
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,163
Profile.

606
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,336
Where are the profiles stored?

607
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:28,536
All security data is stored offline
in the liquid-cooled array.

608
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,816
Here, inside the torus.

609
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,536
Liquid-cooled.
You mean that thing is underwater?

610
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,142
- Yes.
- Yes.

611
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,416
Okay. So, to get the ledger,

612
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,316
one of us needs to enter the torus

613
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,102
and change the security profile,

614
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:49,317
so that the other one can access
the computer without being caught.

615
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,890
- That's the only way.
- That's the only way.

616
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,656
Can I get in through there? What's that?

617
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:01,216
That's the service hatch.
It can only be opened from the inside.

618
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,856
If you try and open it from the outside,

619
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,056
you'd be hit with 70,000 gallons
of pressurized water.

620
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,296
Where does the water come from?

621
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,736
Desalinated seawater flows through
the intake, in the power plant.

622
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,856
And, before you ask, the system
is designed to shut down automatically

623
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,245
if any metal enters the intake.

624
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,628
No oxygen tanks.

625
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,976
All right.
Well, how long will it take to free swim

626
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,616
from the intake to the service hatch?

627
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,656
Two minutes,
with the current at full power.

628
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,496
Then you just have to hold your breath
for two minutes.

629
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,056
What about installing
the security profile?

630
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,256
Well, that's gonna be, like,
a minute, tops.

631
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,256
So I have to hold my breath
for three minutes.

632
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,536
You can do that.

633
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,776
What I think you're overlooking
is the physical exertion.

634
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,896
The more you exert yourself,
the faster you consume oxygen.

635
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:46,536
Don't worry about him, all right? All he
has to do is install the fake profile

636
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:50,096
before I get to the gait analysis.
You said it yourself, it's the only way.

637
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,443
That doesn't sound impossible.

638
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,376
Satellite over watch
covering all seven continents.

639
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:03,136
DNA profiling, facial recognition,
drone surveillance, drone strikes.

640
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:06,136
So, how are we supposed to find
Ethan and Benji before they do?

641
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:09,519
I'm not even looking for them.
I'm looking for her.

642
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,637
What do you mean?

643
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,525
These sketches. What do you see?

644
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:20,073
Ethan's not exactly sure
who this guy is.

645
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,302
But this woman...

646
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,881
- He knows her.
- He trusts her.

647
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,896
I'm betting that if he's not already
with her, he's on his way.

648
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,416
Find her, find Ethan.

649
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,936
Tell me it's possible to pull
facial recognition off a sketch.

650
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,616
For mere mortals, no.

651
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:39,390
- For me, I could've done this at home.
- All right.

652
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,389
- How long is this gonna take?
- Found her.

653
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:53,144
CCTV picked her up
at the airport in Casablanca.

654
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,559
What the hell?

655
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,616
She's bad news.

656
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,991
Sorry.

657
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,576
Your' card isn't working.

658
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,703
Benji we're in.

659
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,713
One more time.
You'll have three minutes.

660
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,176
Two and a half minutes
to switch the security profile.

661
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:55,055
Thirty seconds to escape
through the service hatch.

662
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,136
Remember, conserve oxygen.

663
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,456
Don't move a muscle
if you don't have to.

664
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,890
I'm in the elevator.

665
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,776
That current will carry you
to the torus.

666
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,927
Once you're there, I'll shut it down.

667
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:39,256
Important note.
The profile is in slot 108.

668
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,696
And a slightly more important note.
If you haven't switched that profile

669
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,770
before I reach the gait analysis,
I'm dead.

670
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,256
Thank you, Benji.

671
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,936
What's the problem?

672
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:01,907
The cooling system's rebooting by itself.

673
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:27,951
All systems normal.

674
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,333
Cooling system's at full power.

675
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,621
No, no, no.

676
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,056
You're all right.

677
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,759
Oh, you're okay.

678
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,976
You see? What did I tell you?

679
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,162
Difficult? Absolutely. But certainly not...

680
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:18,943
Jesus. Is he all right? What happened?

681
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,837
Okay.

682
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:34,951
Here.

683
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,083
Hey.

684
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,799
I misjudged you.

685
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,816
Hey, man. You okay? How you doing?

686
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,365
Hey, buddy.

687
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:53,856
- Benji.
- Yeah, Benji. You did good.

688
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,936
You take a moment, all right?
Just take a moment.

689
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,576
There's nothing a little sunshine
and fresh air won't fix.

690
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:01,334
- You'll be right as rain.
- What are you doing here?

691
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:02,988
Look, look.

692
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,568
We got it.

693
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,639
I knew we'd get it.

694
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,296
Listen, I don't want to
sound ungrateful, okay?

695
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,336
I appreciate everything you do for me,

696
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:15,816
But one of these days,
you're going to take it too far.

697
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,359
We got it!

698
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,536
We're gonna nail that...

699
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,531
Wait, wait...

700
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:36,336
I thought you said
you could find him.

701
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:37,616
I said I could locate him.

702
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,865
- You have to find him.
- Right.

703
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,697
Where's Hunt?

704
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,031
He's dead.

705
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,616
That really hurts!

706
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:10,896
- Can you walk?
- Yes.

707
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,279
We have to get to her before Lane does.

708
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,376
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

709
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,936
Are you okay to drive?
A minute ago you were dead.

710
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,542
What are you talking about?

711
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,119
This is not going to end well.

712
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,387
There she is!

713
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:39,546
Stairs, stairs, stairs!

714
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:43,065
Ah! God damn it!

715
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,631
Whoa.

716
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,071
We found him.

717
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:30,788
Oh, come on, man!

718
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:35,548
Shit!

719
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,096
It's a high-speed chase!

720
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:40,256
You just had to get the four-by-four,
didn't you?

721
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:43,016
- Don't blame me. You chose the car.
- You just had to have it!

722
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,416
- Do you want me to drive?
Look at this thing!

723
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,911
Look how slow you're going.
Speed it up!

724
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:53,951
Who's this guy?

725
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,191
Shit!

726
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,671
Oh!

727
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,145
Ahhh!

728
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,591
Go! Go! Go!

729
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,470
I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay!

730
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:37,791
Whoa!

731
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,763
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

732
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:51,399
Here they come!
What are we gonna do?

733
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,111
Uh...

734
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:05,951
Gun!

735
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,565
- Do you have your seatbelt on?
- You're asking me that now?

736
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,799
'Hang on!

737
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,511
We good?

738
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,696
Things got a little out of hand.

739
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,945
Ah! Look out!

740
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,182
We're good?

741
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,177
Oh, hey, boys, what did I miss?

742
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:33,927
Ooh, that looks sharp. Careful! Careful!

743
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,508
So what do we do now?

744
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:23,990
Please tell me
you made a copy of that disk.

745
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:28,301
Of course I made a copy.

746
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,636
So where are we going?

747
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:05,296
It's a ledger.
The Syndicate's entire infrastructure.

748
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,856
Who they are,
the politicians they control,

749
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,966
and where the money comes from.
It's everything you want to know.

750
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:15,376
What makes you think
this so-called ledger is authentic?

751
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:18,096
Why would Lane want it so badly
if it wasn't authentic?

752
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:20,496
Why would he ever
let you have it if it was?

753
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,976
Did you never stop to consider
that he may want me to have it?

754
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,496
Misinformation, manipulation,
it's what he does, Ilsa.

755
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,216
It's what he's trained to do.

756
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:31,416
Lane lies to you,
you sell these lies to Hunt.

757
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:35,330
Together, you're both compromised.
That's his ultimate objective.

758
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,125
This may be authentic.

759
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:42,380
But there's only one person I trust
to verify that information. You.

760
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:45,685
No.

761
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,896
My orders were to deliver you
information regarding the Syndicate.

762
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,616
Your orders were
to infiltrate the Syndicate

763
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:54,936
that we may learn more
about them first hand.

764
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,376
This isn't proof.
It's a test, like everything else.

765
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,896
The only way to pass is to go back.

766
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:04,016
I can't do that. I've betrayed Lane's trust
too many times.

767
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:06,576
And in every instance,
you did so on your own volition.

768
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,296
He was going to torture and kill
an American agent.

769
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:12,776
And you should have let him.
Then you would still have Lane's trust.

770
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,016
This is the trade. Hunt understands that.

771
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,536
I wasn't going to let him die.
He's our ally.

772
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:22,016
There are no allies in statecraft, Ilsa,
only common interests.

773
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:25,790
As it stands, Ethan Hunt is a man
without a country.

774
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:30,626
This makes killing him
decidedly less complicated.

775
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,536
Are you ordering me to kill Hunt?

776
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:36,415
Good God, no.
Nothing so crude as that. No.

777
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,996
Lane will order you.

778
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:42,576
And to regain his trust,

779
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,531
you will do it.

780
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:49,980
You sent me to do a job. I did it.

781
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,376
Now you bring me in!

782
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:55,703
Might I remind you,
you are without a country of your own?

783
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:00,216
The Director of the CIA called me,
inquiring about you personally.

784
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:02,576
Of course, to protect your cover,
I had to lie.

785
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:04,216
So, as far as the Americans
are concerned,

786
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:07,738
you're a rogue assassin,
a target of opportunity.

787
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:11,296
Precious few people know
about your true identity.

788
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:16,220
It would be unfortunate if we forgot.

789
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:20,056
You see, there really is no choice, Ilsa.

790
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,011
You're going back.

791
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,511
Glad to know you're still with us.

792
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:43,496
What's happening?
I can't open it.

793
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:47,096
- What do you mean, you can't open it?
- I mean I can't open it, ever.

794
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,776
That's a red box.

795
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,736
- A what?
- It's a red box.

796
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:53,616
The British government uses them
to transport state secrets.

797
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:56,176
- Doesn't sound good.
- Meaning it's triple-encrypted.

798
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:57,376
You're not getting into that thing

799
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,496
unless you have fingerprints,
retinal scan,

800
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,976
and a voice phrase spoken
by a specific individual.

801
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,016
The Prime Minister
of Great Britain himself.

802
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,256
Yes, him.

803
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:08,456
So what you're saying is
there is no ledger,

804
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,936
which means we have no proof
that the Syndicate even exists.

805
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:15,136
So we're back to square one,
only now we are all wanted by the CIA.

806
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:17,016
I'm so proud of us.

807
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,536
What I don't understand is
why is there a red box

808
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:22,569
sat in a private data vault in Morocco?

809
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:24,816
And why would Lane want it
if he can't open it?

810
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:28,395
If Lane wants it,
you can bet he has a plan to open it.

811
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,283
And we just helped him steal it.

812
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:37,136
He's going to take the Prime Minister.

813
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:40,336
Yes, he is. The question is how.

814
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:41,936
Well, we have to warn
the British government.

815
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:43,176
Yeah, MI6.

816
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:46,096
No, Brandt. Put down the phone.
Let's think about this for a minute.

817
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:48,176
We have a responsibility
to warn the British government

818
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:51,456
and not gamble
with the Prime Minister's life, Ethan,

819
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:56,380
just so you can beat the guy
that has beaten you at every turn.

820
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,293
Is that what you think this is?

821
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:02,068
Brandt?

822
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,590
Is that what you think this is?

823
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:10,936
I think right now you're incapable
of seeing that there is another way.

824
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:14,656
And sometimes Ethan is the only one
capable of seeing the only way.

825
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:18,216
And if he is wrong,
then we have Vienna all over again!

826
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:19,296
You don't know him.

827
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:22,376
If he wants something to happen,
there is no preventing it!

828
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,376
That's why we have to warn the British.

829
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,696
Maybe that's exactly
what he wants us to do.

830
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:29,216
Are you listening to yourself?
We are going to warn the British.

831
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:31,576
No. We're going to find Lane,
we're going to get him,

832
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,455
before he takes the Prime Minister.

833
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:40,348
Okay.

834
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:43,097
All right, Ethan.
We're going to find Lane.

835
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:46,898
But please tell me
how are we going to do that?

836
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:27,862
All is forgiven.

837
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:30,216
That isn't a ledger, is it?

838
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,311
You didn't take a look for yourself?

839
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,616
Of course I did,
but the file was encrypted.

840
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:37,296
And why would I lie to you?

841
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:39,741
So that I would lie to Hunt.

842
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:44,023
But he wouldn't have stolen it
if he knew what it was.

843
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,165
And you wouldn't have helped him.

844
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:50,616
What is actually on that disk?

845
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:54,489
I'll be honest with you
when you start being honest with me.

846
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:59,616
Now, you and I both know
why you've come back. Don't we?

847
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:00,871
Hmm?

848
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:04,776
You're still alive
because I believe in your potential.

849
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,123
But I'm growing impatient.

850
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:10,801
Why do you continue to resist?

851
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:18,816
Well, if we're being honest,
you're a terrorist.

852
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:21,336
If that were true,
my goal would be to spread fear.

853
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:26,260
But my method is far more surgical.

854
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:29,793
You kill innocent people.

855
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,976
I helped my government kill
many innocent people and more.

856
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,071
So much more.

857
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:38,339
Killing to keep things as they were.

858
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:42,096
And now I'm killing
to bring about change.

859
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:45,376
I think Ethan Hunt would disagree.

860
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:49,776
Ethan Hunt is a gambler.
And one day his luck will run out,

861
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:53,453
and thousands of innocent people
will pay the price.

862
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:56,102
Which one of us will be the villain then?

863
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:02,435
Nothing here. It's empty.

864
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:22,056
I'm interested to see who you blame

865
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:25,590
for what happens next.

866
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,170
So that's her?

867
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:15,665
That's her.

868
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:24,140
I have to say you sure can ride.

869
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:29,299
- Ethan...
- You were just doing your job.

870
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:32,210
That's all we're going to say about it.

871
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:35,696
Atlee said you would understand.

872
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:38,882
Atlee.
Your handler in British intelligence.

873
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:44,525
And he didn't bring you in,

874
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,833
even after you gave him the disk.

875
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:51,516
You knew perfectly well it was blank.

876
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,056
That's a lie..

877
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:55,616
The disk she took from me
was an exact copy. I'm sure of it.

878
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:58,551
Was it in your possession
the entire time?

879
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:13,559
They don't care if you live or die.

880
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:23,215
But you knew
I was going to take it to him.

881
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:27,369
I hoped you would.
I hoped it'd be enough to get you out.

882
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:31,096
Whoa, whoa, whoa. That means
Lane doesn't have the disk. Only we do.

883
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:32,256
I have a question.

884
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:36,336
If the disk was blank,
why is she still alive?

885
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:40,446
Unless, of course,
Lane wanted us to find her.

886
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:43,696
So who you working for now?

887
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:49,056
Lane, Atlee, your government,
my government, they're all the same.

888
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:50,816
We only think
we're fighting for the right side

889
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:53,163
because that's what
we choose to believe.

890
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:56,276
So where does that leave us?

891
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:59,216
The way I see it,
you have three choices.

892
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:03,056
One, you hand me
and the disk over to the CIA.

893
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:04,856
I am proof the Syndicate exists.

894
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:08,256
Lane becomes their problem
and your work is done.

895
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:10,841
- My thoughts exactly.
- Works for me.

896
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:13,016
But you know
they're not gonna believe you.

897
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:15,363
And you'll all be tried for treason.

898
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,090
Lane goes free.

899
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:19,136
I'm afraid she has a point.

900
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:23,204
Two, you let me walk away
to an uncertain fate.

901
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:26,741
You use the disk as bait to trap Lane.

902
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:30,096
But some part of you suspects
you've met your match.

903
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:32,896
And being a gambler, you'll probably
end up handing Lane that disk,

904
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:34,893
whether you want to or not.

905
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,150
That is entirely possible.

906
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:39,068
And option three?

907
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,237
Come away with me.

908
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:44,279
Right now.

909
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,310
Oh, boy.

910
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:54,083
And what about Lane?

911
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:56,273
Forget about Lane.

912
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:58,890
There will always be another Lane.

913
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:02,383
There will always be people like us
to face him.

914
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:06,690
We've done our part
and we've been cast aside.

915
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:09,441
We can be anyone.

916
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,942
We can do anything.

917
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:15,979
It's only a matter of going.

918
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:32,218
Lane sent you to deliver a message,
didn't he?

919
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:35,456
I've saved your life twice.
I won't be able to do it again.

920
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:37,313
What's the message?

921
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:51,410
Benji.

922
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,416
Parking garage.

923
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:07,470
Luther, stay with her!

924
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:34,019
She's gone. I lost her.

925
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,876
She set us up, Ethan.

926
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,256
No. She delivered a message.

927
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:44,216
She set us up!
She knew this would happen!

928
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:47,216
Only Lane knows
what's going to happen!

929
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:54,896
I have a job for you, Ethan.

930
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:57,696
And for the sake of your friend,
you will do it.

931
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:58,776
I'm listening.

932
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,896
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

933
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:05,576
is to bring me the unlocked disk
by midnight tonight.

934
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,630
New say the words, please.

935
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:10,353
I accept.

936
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,428
Yes.

937
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:16,605
I knew you would.

938
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:28,656
He wants the disk, unlocked,
by midnight tonight.

939
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:33,580
Ethan, there's only one person on Earth
who can unlock that disk.

940
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:36,856
We have to take the Prime Minister.

941
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:41,064
Let's just think about that
for a minute.

942
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:44,096
It's the only way to get Benji back.

943
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:47,618
Ethan, that's exactly
what Lane wants you to do.

944
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:51,061
Which is why it has to happen.

945
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:57,545
This is how we beat Lane.

946
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:00,096
This is how we make everything right.

947
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:01,702
Can you see?

948
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,516
Can't you see it?

949
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,890
William Brandt, sir. He says it's urgent.

950
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:28,496
I had a feeling
you'd come to your senses, Brandt.

951
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:30,976
I'm only calling you
because I have no other choice.

952
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,736
I'm trying to prevent a catastrophe.

953
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:34,776
I can understand that. Where are you?

954
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:40,336
- London.
- Reroute us to London now.

955
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:43,176
- Where in London?
- I'll tell you when you land, not before.

956
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:45,456
I'm not interested
in playing games, Brandt.

957
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:48,296
And I'm not interested
in seeing my friends get killed either.

958
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,776
So if I'm going to betray them,
we're going do this on my terms

959
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,656
and my terms only. Do you understand?

960
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:55,096
Keep your phone on.
Instructions will follow.

961
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,176
You should've been gone
by now.

962
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:04,431
Yeah.

963
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,237
You okay?

964
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:13,536
We're supposed to take down

965
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:15,821
the Prime Minister
of Great Britain tonight.

966
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:17,911
So...

967
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,128
Brandt?

968
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:27,410
I can't see another way.

969
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,016
Neither can I.

970
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:36,623
But we do what we have to do
for our friends, right?

971
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:22,563
Get him ready, please.

972
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,016
You were right to call me, Brandt.
Where is Hunt?

973
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:51,976
He's on his way.
We don't have much time.

974
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,816
- What does he intend to do?
- What matters is that he's alive.

975
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:57,856
And I need your reassurance
that he's going to stay that way.

976
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:15,696
Have you informed
the British government

977
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:17,656
that Hunt has targeted
the Prime Minister?

978
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:21,920
I will help you capture him alive.
That is the deal.

979
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:30,696
You've picked up some terrible habits
from your friend, Brandt,

980
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:35,058
the worst of them being that you still
believe you can control any outcome.

981
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:37,073
Stay with him.

982
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:43,016
Chief Atlee! Chief Atlee.

983
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:45,416
Director Hunley,
how delightful to see you here.

984
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:49,336
Last time we spoke, you were hunting
rogue agents in Morocco.

985
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:54,244
Chief Atlee, I have reason to believe that
the Prime Minister's life is in danger.

986
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,005
I'm listening.

987
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:04,936
AUCTIONEER: Any advance
on 22,000? Anyone?

988
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:07,619
Going once. Going twice.

989
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:10,339
Sold to our generous chairwoman.

990
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:13,536
Sir? Chief Atlee from MI6
needs to see you.

991
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:15,393
He says it's urgent.

992
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:18,457
Excuse me.

993
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:30,096
What's this all about?

994
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:32,876
It's a matter of national security, sir.

995
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:42,696
Under no circumstances
is anyone to enter.

996
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:44,148
Yes, sir.

997
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,546
Help me to understand.

998
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:50,736
Who is this man? Why is he after me?

999
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:53,576
I'm afraid, Prime Minister,
Director Hunley and I

1000
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:55,896
share responsibility for this.

1001
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:59,016
Ethan Hunt was part of
a disgraced intelligence agency

1002
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:00,296
which has since been dissolved.

1003
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,696
And he's gone rogue,

1004
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:05,576
unfortunately intent on dismantling
an imaginary terror network.

1005
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:08,016
But new intelligence suggests
he's been manipulated

1006
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:09,936
by one of your own former agents.

1007
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:12,936
Ilsa Faust, Prime Minister.
She disappeared two years ago.

1008
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:16,936
If you don't mind my asking, what do
I have to do with this phantom network?

1009
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:19,936
Uh, sir, this is William Brandt,
a former colleague of Hunt's.

1010
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:23,176
He came forward with first hand
knowledge of the plot against you.

1011
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:25,936
Sir, Hunt is in possession
of a virtual red box

1012
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:27,856
that can only be opened by you.

1013
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:32,120
He believes it is the key
to bring down the Syndicate.

1014
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:35,096
The Syndicate, you say?

1015
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:38,423
Yes, sir.
That's what he calls it.

1016
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:40,048
Atlee?

1017
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:43,336
He couldn't possibly be talking about

1018
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:44,745
that Syndicate.

1019
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:51,376
Because you assured me that
that Syndicate was merely an exercise.

1020
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:54,616
And it was, Prime Minister,
I can assure you.

1021
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:55,736
And yet here we have

1022
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:57,976
the Central Intelligence Agency
indicating otherwise.

1023
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,416
I don't understand.

1024
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,776
Prime Minister, your life is in danger.

1025
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:05,136
I think our first priority is to move you
to a secure location.

1026
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:08,715
Sir, does the name Solomon Lane
ring a bell?

1027
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:11,803
Yes.

1028
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:16,250
Unfortunately, it does.

1029
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:21,096
So there actually is a Syndicate?

1030
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:25,416
It was the hypothetical brainchild
of Chief Atlee.

1031
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:28,296
Recruit former agents
from other nations,

1032
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:29,736
supply them with a new identity,

1033
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:34,336
and use them to surgically remove
our enemies, both at home and abroad.

1034
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:36,696
Its operating budget
was to be hidden offshore

1035
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:40,256
in a virtual red box
which I alone would control.

1036
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:42,936
It would have made me
judge, jury, and executioner,

1037
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:44,256
with zero accountability.

1038
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:47,016
I rejected the proposal, unequivocally.

1039
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,776
Furthermore,
I was given every assurance

1040
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:51,696
it never passed the planning stage.

1041
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:54,456
Prime Minister, there is no Syndicate.

1042
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:56,936
These men have been duped
by Agent Faust.

1043
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:00,616
Atlee! Save it for the public inquiry.

1044
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:02,176
Sir, I urge you not to leave this room.

1045
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:03,683
- Excuse me.
- Please.

1046
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:06,416
Hunt is uniquely trained
and highly motivated.

1047
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:09,896
A specialist without equal,
immune to any countermeasures.

1048
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:12,216
There is no secret he cannot extract.

1049
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:16,326
No security he cannot breach.
No person he cannot become.

1050
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:20,096
He has, most likely,
anticipated this very conversation

1051
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:23,056
and is waiting to strike
in whatever direction we move.

1052
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:27,216
Sir, Hunt is the living manifestation
of destiny.

1053
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:30,445
And he has made you his mission.

1054
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:33,176
Prime Minister?

1055
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:50,210
Hunt.

1056
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:53,555
Sir, please step away
from the Prime Minister.

1057
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:59,496
Just relax, sir.
Everything's going to be all right.

1058
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:02,725
- Atlee shot me.
- Yes, he did, sir.

1059
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:08,176
Hunt, I hope you realize you've set back

1060
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:11,456
US-UK relations
to the American Revolution?

1061
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:14,839
Desperate times,
desperate measures, sir.

1062
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:17,896
I'm here.

1063
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,991
- Stand by to receive.
- Ready.

1064
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:28,976
The Prime Minister's office asked me
to meet him here.

1065
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,296
This way, sir.

1066
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:31,845
Scanning.

1067
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:37,919
Retinal scan confirmed.

1068
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:40,456
Mmm.

1069
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:42,650
It's okay. Here you go, sir.

1070
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:46,530
You've got a very warm hand.

1071
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:56,799
Biometric confirmed.

1072
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:01,606
The prompt is Kipling.

1073
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:05,696
Sir, I'm going to need a pass-phrase.
The prompt is Kipling.

1074
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:07,336
Yes, of course.

1075
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:11,404
If you can keep your head when
all about you are losing theirs...

1076
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:20,084
If you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you...

1077
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:26,016
- You got it?
- I got it.

1078
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:27,696
Oh, man, do I got it.

1079
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:29,656
I'm here to see the Prime Minister.

1080
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:31,520
We were told not to let anybody in.

1081
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,162
- By Whom?
- By you, sir.

1082
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:40,616
Hunley? What is this?

1083
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:42,473
Security!

1084
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:50,363
Chief Atlee.

1085
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:52,696
Kind of you to accept our invitation.

1086
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:53,951
Ah.

1087
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:04,382
Do you know who I am?

1088
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:08,336
We know you created the Syndicate.

1089
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:10,976
But Lane went rogue
and turned it against you, didn't he?

1090
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,576
And you've been
desperately trying to cover it up.

1091
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:16,416
That's why you erased the disk
when she brought it to you.

1092
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:18,273
That's true.

1093
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:25,536
Now, Director Hunley has some
questions for you regarding Ilsa Faust.

1094
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:28,256
Namely, how you framed her.

1095
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:31,191
That's also true.

1096
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:36,936
It's the antidote.

1097
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:39,416
When the Prime Minister found out
about the Syndicate,

1098
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:41,136
Atlee attacked him.

1099
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:42,416
Yes, that's true.

1100
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:45,216
And then you saved
the Prime Minister, sir.

1101
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:46,822
Did he?

1102
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:48,548
I'm very grateful.

1103
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:01,025
Sir.

1104
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:06,650
You're cutting it very close, Ethan.

1105
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:10,476
I have what you want. Where do I go?

1106
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:29,576
Ethan, wait.

1107
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:31,776
If I'm not there in 15 minutes,
he'll kill Benji.

1108
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:33,736
The mission
is to bring down the Syndicate.

1109
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:38,016
If Lane gets his hands on that money,
we're unleashing a terrorist superpower.

1110
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:40,176
He'll never take me alive.
I'll make sure of it.

1111
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:44,456
And what happens,
Ethan, if you can't make it back?

1112
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:46,747
I'll make it back.

1113
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:49,216
Just be ready.

1114
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:55,376
Greetings, Prime Minister.

1115
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:56,656
If you are viewing this message,

1116
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:59,816
it means that you have chosen
to activate the Syndicate.

1117
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:03,576
This disk gives you access
to 82.4 billion

1118
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,176
in untraceable currency

1119
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:09,976
that will allow the Syndicate
to operate undetected for decades.

1120
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:14,900
Instructions to access these funds
are as follows.

1121
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:23,779
This is the end, Mr. Hunt.

1122
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:34,083
Careful.

1123
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:38,873
Two pounds of Semtex.

1124
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:42,856
Five hundred .30 calibre ball bearings.

1125
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:44,936
Your friend is sitting on
a highly sensitive...

1126
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:46,856
pressure trigger.

1127
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:49,050
So no sudden moves.

1128
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:58,376
Your final test.

1129
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:03,056
When Lane has what he wants,
I kill you and Benji.

1130
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:07,166
If not, everyone dies.

1131
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:11,516
No time to think, Ethan.

1132
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:13,810
Have a seat, please.

1133
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:32,136
Human nature. My weapon of choice.

1134
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:35,816
From the moment I killed the young lady
in the record shop,

1135
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:39,176
- I knew you would...
- stop at nothing to catch me.

1136
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:41,816
I also knew Ilsa wouldn't have a choice.

1137
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:45,816
Whether she broke you
that night you met or let you go,

1138
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:48,107
whether you let her run in Morocco,

1139
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:51,136
whether she went to Atlee or not...

1140
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:55,946
You were certain we'd end up
where we are right now.

1141
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:01,111
Then, again,

1142
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:03,250
so was I.

1143
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:05,696
I know you, Lane.

1144
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:08,656
Somewhere along the line,
you had a crisis of faith.

1145
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:12,536
Human life didn't matter any more.
Or maybe it never really did.

1146
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:15,736
Either way,
you killed too many innocent people

1147
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:20,216
without ever asking
who was giving the orders or why.

1148
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:25,016
You blame the system for what you are,
instead of yourself.

1149
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:28,816
You wanted revenge,
but Rome wasn't destroyed in a day.

1150
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:32,696
You needed help.
You needed money, a lot of it.

1151
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:36,016
And you'll stop at nothing to get it.

1152
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:39,049
That's how I know
I'm going to put you in a box.

1153
01:51:40,920 --> 01:51:42,305
Where's the disk?

1154
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:45,397
Where is the disk?

1155
01:51:45,560 --> 01:51:47,138
You like to play games.

1156
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:49,057
I have a game for you.

1157
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:53,370
I'll give you $50 million

1158
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:56,985
to let Benji go.

1159
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:14,717
Where is the disk?

1160
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:17,102
Where is the disk?

1161
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:19,536
You're looking at it.

1162
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:20,856
I am the disk.

1163
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:24,576
I memorized it.
All £24 billion in numbered accounts.

1164
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:26,736
If that vest goes off, you get nothing.

1165
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:31,660
Without this money, you're nothing.
Without me, you're nothing.

1166
01:52:35,960 --> 01:52:38,056
Right now, you're thinking it's a bluff.

1167
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:39,776
I'd never let my friends die.

1168
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:43,296
I couldn't possibly memorize
the entire disk.

1169
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:45,545
There's only one way to be sure.

1170
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:48,279
Let Benji go.

1171
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:06,968
Take him.

1172
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,261
They come one step closer, shoot me.

1173
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:16,919
Stop!

1174
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:22,696
You remember I told you one day
you were going to take things too far?

1175
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:24,656
This is me speaking, by the way,
it's not him.

1176
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:29,580
The only way this ends is you and me,
Lane, face to face.

1177
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:32,656
Only this time,
I won't be locked in a glass box.

1178
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:34,056
You want your money?

1179
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:35,456
The Bone Doctor
is going to have to

1180
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:37,320
beat it out of me!

1181
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:40,781
Now let Benji go.

1182
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:47,307
1-3-9...

1183
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:09,936
- Go.
- Ethan...

1184
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:12,031
Brandt and Luther are waiting. Go.

1185
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:21,568
What do I do?

1186
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:23,068
Kill the woman.

1187
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:27,027
I need Hunt alive.

1188
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:16,136
- Go.
- It's Benji. Where am I going?

1189
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:17,736
- They're coming.
- We're not ready.

1190
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:19,145
Then get ready.

1191
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:47,199
Which way?

1192
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:11,165
Now let's see what you're made of.

1193
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:11,494
Face to face, just as you wished, Ethan.

1194
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:35,990
It hurts, I know.

1195
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:41,061
Gentlemen, this is Solomon Lane.

1196
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:43,456
Mr. Lane,

1197
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:47,067
meet the IMF.

1198
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:07,717
You're free now.

1199
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:12,356
Where will you go?

1200
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:14,963
I don't know.

1201
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:19,430
I've done my part.

1202
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:20,976
Yeah.

1203
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:28,037
Ethan, we got to go!

1204
02:02:37,680 --> 02:02:39,807
You'd better hurry now.

1205
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:43,165
Good luck.

1206
02:02:58,080 --> 02:03:00,151
You know how to find me.

1207
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:19,296
Director Hunley?

1208
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:22,796
Director Hunley!

1209
02:03:22,820 --> 02:03:24,016
Uh, Mr. Chairman.

1210
02:03:24,040 --> 02:03:26,496
Six months ago,
you stood before this panel

1211
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:28,899
and demanded that
the IMF be dissolved.

1212
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,736
That is correct, sir.

1213
02:03:30,760 --> 02:03:32,696
How do you explain
your testimony today?

1214
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:35,096
It's quite simple, really.
We had reason to believe that

1215
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:38,536
the Syndicate had infiltrated
our government at the highest level.

1216
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:41,176
In order for our man
to infiltrate that organization,

1217
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:43,896
his cover had to be absolute.

1218
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:45,336
The whole operation was known

1219
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:48,616
only to myself
and a handful of IMF agents.

1220
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:53,540
So the shuttering of the IMF
was all part of an elaborate scheme

1221
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:55,896
to expose the so-called Syndicate.

1222
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:57,056
That is correct, sir.

1223
02:03:57,080 --> 02:04:01,980
Which is why you're here today
asking for the IMF to be reinstated.

1224
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:04,573
That is correct, sir.

1225
02:04:06,760 --> 02:04:10,256
I'm not sure the Committee approves
of your methods, Director Hunley.

1226
02:04:10,280 --> 02:04:14,366
Uh, desperate times,
desperate measures, Mr. Chairman.

1227
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:20,211
And you, Mr. Brandt,
how can you justify this deception?

1228
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:25,096
I can neither confirm nor deny
details of any operation

1229
02:04:25,120 --> 02:04:27,639
without the Secretary's approval.

1230
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:37,576
Welcome to the IMF,

1231
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:39,476
Mr. Secretary.
