FELICITY: 4 YEARS AGO,
THE HOOD TOOK DOWN
JUSTIN CLAYBOURNE.

3
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:06,047
YOU TOLD ME THAT
CLAYBOURNE DIDN'T
HAVE ANY KIDS.

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,341
THERE'S NO RECORD
OF THE KID'S NAME.

5
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:08,843
HE'D BE ABOUT 30 TODAY.

6
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,636
JUST OLD ENOUGH TO PUT
ON A HOOD AND A MASK.

7
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,262
OLD ENOUGH
TO WANT REVENGE

8
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:15,265
ON THE MAN WHO MURDERED
HIS FATHER.

9
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:16,892
OLIVER: EVELYN, WHY?

10
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,226
YOU'RE A FRAUD.

11
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,938
THIS CITY NEEDS TO BE
SAVED FROM YOU.

12
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,147
JOHN: HEY.
LYLA: JOHNNY, I NEED YOU

13
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,273
TO COME TO
THE SAFE HOUSE.

14
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:26,067
-SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH JJ.
-LYLA?

15
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,403
DID YOU FIND BILLY?

16
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,155
OLIVER: I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS BILLY.

17
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,615
I COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN.

18
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,579
HI, OLLIE.

19
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,628
I SAW YOU DIE.

20
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,339
I WAS SAVED.

21
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:51,969
I SAW THIS WHITE LIGHT,
AND...IT'S...

22
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:53,387
IT'S JUST LIKE
THEY SAY.

23
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,223
THIS ANGEL, SHE...
SHE REACHED OUT TO ME,

24
00:00:56,264 --> 00:01:00,352
BUT SHE WASN'T
AN ANGEL.

25
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,103
SHE WAS MY SISTER.

26
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,939
WHAT?

27
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:06,274
SARA...SHE...SHE
HAD ME TELEPORTED

28
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,235
TO THE WAVE RIDER.

29
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,778
THEY HAVE
THIS TECHNOLOGY

30
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,113
THAT FIXED THE EMBOLISM.

31
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,240
I WAS THERE.

32
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,285
EVERYONE WAS THERE.

33
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,954
NOBODY SAW
A WHITE LIGHT,

34
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,664
AND YOU DIDN'T GO
ANYWHERE.

35
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:23,918
THAT'S BECAUSE SHE
HADN'T DONE IT YET.

36
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,378
OLLIE...

37
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,296
OLLIE I ASKED HER...

38
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:32,300
I ASKED HER TO BRING ME
TO YOUR PRESENT.

39
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,636
SHE GAVE ME THE SAME GIFT
THAT I GAVE HER.

40
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,226
SHE GAVE ME
A SECOND CHANCE.

41
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,477
IT'S A MIRACLE.

42
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,647
IT'S A MIRACLE.

43
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,196
LAUREL?

44
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,531
HI, FELICITY.

45
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,075
LAUREL?

46
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,785
OH, MY GOD!

47
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,828
OHH! OH, MY GOD!

48
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,248
IT'S A MIRACLE.

49
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,208
OLIVER SAID
THE EXACT SAME THING.

50
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,551
FELICITY: I THOUGHT
SARA AND THE LEGENDS

51
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,095
WERE AGAINST
CHANGING HISTORY.

52
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,554
SARA SAID THAT THEY
FIGURED OUT A WAY

53
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,974
TO BRING ME BACK
WITHOUT CAUSING
A, UH...

54
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,141
AN ABERRATION.

55
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,478
YES. THAT.

56
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,313
ARE YOU OK?

57
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,732
FINE.

58
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,651
YEAH. I JUST WISH
THE LEGENDS COULD
BRING BACK

59
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,403
EVERYBODY WE WANTED.

60
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,322
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT'D I MISS?

61
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,866
WE'LL TALK
ABOUT IT LATER.

62
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:41,411
THE IMPORTANT THING
IS THAT YOU'RE BACK
FROM THE PAST,

63
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,664
WHICH THEY BROUGHT
YOU BACK FROM
MONTHS LATER,

64
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,206
AND THEY JUST
DROPPED YOU HERE.

65
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,127
SO WEIRD.

66

AM I RIGHT?

67
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,755
WOW! HEH.

68
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,090
DO YOU GUYS WANT
A COFFEE?

69
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:55,050
I, UM...GONNA GET
A DECA...DECAF
PROBABLY

70
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,760
BECAUSE OF...

71
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,763
IT'S NICE TO SEE SOME
THINGS HAVEN'T CHANGED.

72
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,390
OH. I HAVE TO
CALL MY DAD.

73
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,726
HE'S GONNA KILL ME
FOR COMING HERE FIRST.

74
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,687
LAUREL, AFTER YOU...

75
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:12,067
UH, Y-YOUR DAD LEFT
WITH DONNA

00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,903
AND, UH, IT DIDN'T
GO WELL.

77
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,948
-HE'S DRINKING AGAIN.
-HE'S IN REHAB,

78
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,075
BUT HE'S...HE'S...HE'S
GETTING BETTER.

79
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,409
HE'S GETTING THE HELP
THAT HE NEEDS.

80
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,328
WOW. 9 MONTHS.

81
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,622
I GUESS I HAVE A LOT
OF CATCHING UP TO DO.

82
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:29,168
WHICH IS WHY I'M
GONNA TELL EVERYONE
TO COME TO THE PARTY.

83
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,878
-WHAT PARTY?
-THE PARTY THAT WE'RE GONNA

84
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,295
THROW FOR LAUREL

LOVE TO SEE EVERYONE...

OH, MY...JOHN! OHH!

88
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,428
I CAME HERE
TO TELL YOU,

89
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,681
AND I TOTALLY
FORGOT.

90
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,599
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH JOHN?

91
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,019
JOHN: I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE'S BACK.

92
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,311
I WALKED
INTO THE BUNKER,

WAS JUST THERE

LIKE IT WAS SOME
KIND OF GIFT.

97
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:58,030
HOW MUCH DOES SHE KNOW
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED?

98
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:59,364

WITH THE DUDE WHO
TRAINED THE TWO OF YOU?

00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,755

YOU OUT OF HERE.

YEAH. WELL, WE DID THAT,
REMEMBER,

111
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,769
AND HERE I AM RIGHT BACK
ON THE INSIDE.

112

-WELL, JOHN...
-NO, MAN. NO MORE RUNNING.

I'M GONNA NEED ONE

ASKED ME TO DO.

A GOVERNMENT AGENT,

A COURT-MARTIAL

AND ATTEMPTED THEFT
OF A WMD.

HE'S INNOCENT.

317
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:54,751
SO WHY DID HE ESCAPE
A FEDERAL PRISON?

318
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,503
BECAUSE HE'S INNOCENT.

319

INTO HIS HAND.
