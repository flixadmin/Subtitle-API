2
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,262
Benji.

3
00:01:13,515 --> 00:01:15,466
Benji, do you copy?

4
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,577
Benji.

5
00:01:17,983 --> 00:01:20,012
Oh. Shit.

6
00:01:20,037 --> 00:01:21,480
Where's Ethan?

7
00:01:21,505 --> 00:01:23,162
Uh. I can't talk right now.

8
00:01:23,187 --> 00:01:25,595
The package is on the plane.

9
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,192
Yeah, I know.

10
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:31,124
We're currently formulate a plan B
although technically, it's a plan C.

11
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:32,523
This isn't going very well.

12
00:01:32,563 --> 00:01:34,851
I am aware of that, Brandt.
You're not helping.

13
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:35,986
Where's Ethan?

14
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:37,465
I don't know.
We're on radio silence.

15
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,239
That plane cannot takeoff,
with the package on it.

16
00:01:40,264 --> 00:01:42,365
- You understand?
- We're working on it.

17
00:01:42,397 --> 00:01:44,474
Luther? What the hell
are you doing there?

18
00:01:44,499 --> 00:01:46,266
You are supposed to be on
an assignment in Malaysia.

19
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:49,321
I'm in Malaysia, I've been here 2 days.
Benji needed my help.

20
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:52,864
I didn't need help. I just... I needed
assistance, it's a different thing.

21
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:55,210
The package is still
on that plane.

22
00:01:56,582 --> 00:01:58,373
We understand the package
is on the plane.

23
00:01:58,398 --> 00:02:00,852
- We're trying to cripple it remotely.
- You can do that.

24
00:02:00,877 --> 00:02:03,646
We can if the pilot left the
satellite uplink switch on.

25
00:02:03,671 --> 00:02:06,022
- Which he has.
- And how do you access the uplink?

26
00:02:06,047 --> 00:02:09,576
- It involves hacking a Russian satellite.
- I can't authorise that.

27
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,419
Which is why
I didn't ask permission.

28
00:02:11,444 --> 00:02:13,903
We are under investigation
for misconduct.

29
00:02:13,928 --> 00:02:17,327
The package is on-board.
What do you want me to do?

30
00:02:25,285 --> 00:02:27,174
Uh. Luther.

31
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:29,852
I'm reading a heat bloom, Benji.
The engines are starting.

32
00:02:29,877 --> 00:02:31,437
Yeah. I'm aware of that.

33
00:02:31,462 --> 00:02:34,979
But I can't do anything until
I'm connected to the satellite.

34
00:02:35,268 --> 00:02:38,151
Benji, you are connected.
Okay, Great.

35
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,556
The package is still
on that plane.

36
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:43,465
Shut down the fuel pump.

37
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,317
Uh. Mechanical are lockdown.

38
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:48,506
- What about the electrical system?
- Oh, that might work.

39
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:49,317
No. No.

40
00:02:49,342 --> 00:02:51,202
- Hydraulics.
- Okay, standby.

41
00:02:51,227 --> 00:02:53,215
No, they're encrypted.

42
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:55,769
Benji, the plane.

43
00:02:55,794 --> 00:02:57,509
Yes! The package
is on the plane!

44
00:02:57,534 --> 00:02:59,396
We get it!

45
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,942
Can you open the door?

46
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:05,312
- Ethan? Where are you?
- I'm by the plane.

47
00:03:05,337 --> 00:03:07,251
Benji, can you open the door?

48
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:10,007
Uh. Can I open the door?
Uh. Maybe.

49
00:03:10,032 --> 00:03:12,547
Open the door when I tell you.

50
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:28,372
I'm on the plane. Open the door.

51
00:03:28,397 --> 00:03:29,538
How did you get in the plane?

52
00:03:29,563 --> 00:03:32,310
Not in the plane,
I'm on the plane!

53
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:34,604
Open the door!

54
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:41,172
Benji. Open the door!

55
00:03:41,197 --> 00:03:43,731
Yeah-yeah-yeah... Okay, okay.

56
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:51,513
- Benji, open that door right now!
- Yeah, I am trying.

57
00:04:05,294 --> 00:04:08,100
- Come on, Benji.
- Benji, open that door!

58
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,515
Come on. Come on. Come on.

59
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,138
Come on. Yes, got it.

60
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,367
That's the wrong door!

61
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:27,656
Benji, not that door.
The other door.

62
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:29,480
The other door.
Right. Yes, the other door.

63
00:04:29,505 --> 00:04:32,717
Okay, yes, yes. Sorry, sorry.
My bad, my bad.

64
00:04:37,758 --> 00:04:39,419
Check it out.

65
00:04:39,616 --> 00:04:41,641
Alright. Look, I'm gonna
open the para-door.

66
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,493
How's that?

67
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,127
Hey. Hey.

68
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:31,047
We're about to close.

69
00:06:31,072 --> 00:06:32,919
I won't be long.

70
00:06:32,944 --> 00:06:35,601
You looking for
anything in particular.

71
00:06:36,232 --> 00:06:38,762
Something rare.

72
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:44,060
Let me guess.

73
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:47,028
Classical.

74
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:48,054
Jazz.

75
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,198
- Sax.
- Coltrain.

76
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:52,397
- Piano.
- Monk.

77
00:06:52,422 --> 00:06:54,970
Shadow Wilson on the bass.

78
00:06:54,995 --> 00:06:57,759
Shadow Wilson played drums.

79
00:06:58,203 --> 00:07:00,854
Know why they called him Shadow?

80
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,560
Because he had a light touch.

81
00:07:04,218 --> 00:07:06,056
You're in luck.

82
00:07:07,498 --> 00:07:09,827
I've a first pressing.

83
00:07:17,906 --> 00:07:20,191
It really is you.

84
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:24,897
I've heard stories.

85
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:27,366
They can't all be true.

86
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:50,817
Good even, Mr. Hunt.

87
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:54,570
The weapons you recovered in Belarus
were confirmed to be VX nerve gas.

88
00:07:54,595 --> 00:07:57,321
Capable of devastating
a major city.

89
00:07:57,346 --> 00:07:59,193
The bodies of the air crew
were found less than

90
00:07:59,218 --> 00:08:02,114
24 hours after they
landed in Damascus.

91
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:05,158
They were identified as
low level Chechen separatist.

92
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:07,059
With neither the
access nor the ability

93
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:10,199
to acquire the weapons
they were transporting.

94
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:11,945
This would support your suspicion

95
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,198
that a shadow organization is
committed to inciting revolution.

96
00:08:15,222 --> 00:08:19,412
By enabling acts of terror in
nations friendly to Western interests.

97
00:08:19,438 --> 00:08:22,418
IMF suspects this to be the
same shadow organization

98
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:24,703
you have been tracking
for the last year.

99
00:08:24,728 --> 00:08:27,094
Also known as the Syndicate.

100
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:29,500
IMF would be right.

101
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:31,777
Normally, you and your
team would be tasked

102
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:34,770
with infiltrating and disrupting
this terrorist network,

103
00:08:34,795 --> 00:08:38,450
but we have taken steps to
ensure that this will not happen.

104
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:41,137
Because, we, are the Syndicate,
Mr. Hunt.

105
00:08:41,162 --> 00:08:43,851
And now we know who you are.

106
00:08:43,876 --> 00:08:46,179
Your mission, should you
choose to accept it,

107
00:08:46,204 --> 00:08:47,831
is to face your fate.

108
00:08:47,856 --> 00:08:52,017
Pursue us, you'll be caught.
Resist us, you'll be killed.

109
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:56,195
And you precious Secretary will
disavow any knowledge of your actions.

110
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,540
Good luck, Mr. Hunt.

111
00:08:57,566 --> 00:09:01,761
This message will self destruct
in 5 seconds.

112
00:09:51,434 --> 00:09:56,339
Mr. Chairman, the IMF's misadventures
date back to my earliest days in the CIA

113
00:09:56,378 --> 00:10:01,025
when the IMF broke into the CIA
to steal a list of covert operatives.

114
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,038
- And now, more recently a Russian warhead.
- Disarmed Russian warhead.

115
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:06,859
- A Russian nuclear warhead.
- Branded safe by The IMF.

116
00:10:06,884 --> 00:10:10,279
Clipped the Transamerica Pyramid
before plunging into the San Francisco bay.

117
00:10:10,304 --> 00:10:11,819
Saving the western atmosphere.

118
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,376
This made possible by IMF
agents who did willing

119
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:17,516
provide the launch codes
to a known terrorist.

120
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,390
Do I have that right, agent Brandt?

121
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:23,025
I can neither confirm
nor deny details of any

122
00:10:23,037 --> 00:10:25,110
such operation without
Secretary's approval.

123
00:10:25,144 --> 00:10:28,058
This was the same week after
IMF infiltrated the Kremlin.

124
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,552
Here's the Kremlin before.

125
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,051
And the Kremlin after.

126
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:38,710
I can neither confirm nor
deny details of any operation...

127
00:10:38,735 --> 00:10:40,491
Without the Secretary's approval.
Yes, we know.

128
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:43,016
In fact, until this panel
appoints a new Secretary,

129
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,461
you really can't say much of anything,
can you, agent Brandt?

130
00:10:45,486 --> 00:10:47,027
Well.
I didn't write the rules, Mr. Hunley.

131
00:10:47,052 --> 00:10:49,773
Mr. Chairman, the so call
Impossible Missions Force

132
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:53,256
is not just a rogue organization,
it is an outdated one.

133
00:10:53,282 --> 00:10:57,157
A throwback to an era without
transparency and without oversight.

134
00:10:57,182 --> 00:10:59,591
- Mr. Chairman.
- The time has come to dissolve the IMF.

135
00:10:59,616 --> 00:11:00,641
Mr. Chairman.

136
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:03,762
And transfer the salvageable
assets to the CIA.

137
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:07,089
Mr. Chairman, the IMF has operated
without oversight for 40 years.

138
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:09,531
- Now, are its methods unorthodox? Yes.
- Mr. Chairman.

139
00:11:09,556 --> 00:11:12,718
Are it's results less than perfect?
Absolutely.

140
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:15,330
- But without the IMF, to be force...
- There'll be order and stability.

141
00:11:15,355 --> 00:11:17,519
Without the IMF...

142
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:23,829
This panel recognizes the IMF's
contribution to global security.

143
00:11:23,854 --> 00:11:27,156
But the events laid out by
CIA director Hunley

144
00:11:27,185 --> 00:11:30,215
also show a pattern of
once and brinkmanship

145
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,148
and a total disregard for protocol.

146
00:11:33,173 --> 00:11:34,396
From where I sit,

147
00:11:34,421 --> 00:11:38,393
you unorthodox methods are
indistinguishable from chance.

148
00:11:38,418 --> 00:11:41,501
And your results,
perfect or not,

149
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:44,248
looked suspiciously like luck.

150
00:11:44,924 --> 00:11:50,056
I'm afraid today is the day
when the IMF's luck runs out.

151
00:13:29,086 --> 00:13:30,966
What are you doing here?

152
00:13:31,681 --> 00:13:33,028
Huh?

153
00:13:35,763 --> 00:13:38,713
I said: "What are you doing here?"

154
00:13:45,977 --> 00:13:49,119
What does he see in you, I wonder.

155
00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:51,084
Who is he?

156
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,478
I want to see what is done.

157
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,948
Why don't you
take off the cuffs.

158
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,122
And I'll show you.

159
00:14:03,147 --> 00:14:04,922
Vinter.

160
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:10,278
You know who I am?

161
00:14:10,303 --> 00:14:12,378
Janik Vinter.

162
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,399
They call you, the bone doctor.

163
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,595
The funny thing is.

164
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,732
You're officially declared dead,
3 years ago.

165
00:14:23,757 --> 00:14:25,918
Nice shoes by the way.

166
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:29,261
Not his.

167
00:14:29,471 --> 00:14:31,187
Yours.

168
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,199
We have instructions to talk,

169
00:14:40,224 --> 00:14:41,671
not to kill him.

170
00:14:41,696 --> 00:14:44,823
There are men who are
broken in different ways.

171
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:48,347
This one's a fighter.

172
00:14:48,372 --> 00:14:50,973
He'll die, before you turn him.

173
00:14:50,998 --> 00:14:53,774
Are you worry he's
gonna take your place?

174
00:15:04,302 --> 00:15:08,791
You should go,
before it gets ugly.

175
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,439
Yeah, he's right.

176
00:15:13,464 --> 00:15:15,487
You should go.

177
00:15:29,113 --> 00:15:32,370
Now, let's see how tough you are.

178
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:35,513
You, Janik.

179
00:16:58,098 --> 00:17:00,795
We've never met before, right?

180
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,329
Follow me.

181
00:17:12,301 --> 00:17:14,066
Give me the gun.

182
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:20,207
- What're you doing?
- I can't leave.

183
00:17:20,232 --> 00:17:22,302
Look. You can't stay.
We just killed those men.

184
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:24,510
We didn't kill them. You did.

185
00:17:24,535 --> 00:17:28,122
I tried to stop you.
You got away.

186
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:31,260
Who are you?

187
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:34,402
You better hurry now. Good luck.

188
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:36,094
No, wait. Wait!

189
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,251
Where is he?

190
00:17:37,276 --> 00:17:39,766
He's heading to the north corridor.
He has closed the gate.

191
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,965
Hurry, don't let him escape.
Quick!

192
00:17:54,883 --> 00:17:57,525
- Stack-com 7.
- Western Europe unsecured.

193
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,022
- Designator.
- Bravo Echo One One.

194
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:01,804
Connecting.

195
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:04,151
- This is Brandt.
- Go secure.

196
00:18:05,572 --> 00:18:06,430
Go.

197
00:18:06,455 --> 00:18:09,849
London terminal is compromised.
Repeat, London is compromised.

198
00:18:09,874 --> 00:18:12,859
Agent placed is down.
Request immediate extraction.

199
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,890
What happened?
Who breached London?

200
00:18:14,915 --> 00:18:16,569
Do you've anything to go on?

201
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:20,412
A face. He wanted something.
Not information.

202
00:18:20,437 --> 00:18:23,521
He could've kill me,
but he didn't.

203
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:27,206
- Okay, what do you think it means.
- The Syndicate is real.

204
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:29,995
They know who we're,
how we operate.

205
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,739
I think I know why
they've been so hard to find.

206
00:18:32,764 --> 00:18:35,519
Just focus operations on
gathering any available.

207
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,904
Intel regarding formal
covert operatives.

208
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:39,966
It doesn't matter what
country or agency.

209
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:42,434
Just as long as they are dead
Or presumed dead.

210
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:47,224
Start with Janik Vinter.
He's also known as the bone doctor.

211
00:18:47,249 --> 00:18:49,537
- I can't do that.
- What?

212
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,574
What're you talking about?

213
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,818
The Committee has shut us down.

214
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:57,019
Operations are to be
handled over to the CIA.

215
00:18:57,044 --> 00:18:58,778
There is no more IMF.

216
00:18:58,802 --> 00:19:01,579
I've been ordered
to bring everyone in.

217
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:04,363
- Ethan.
- I understand.

218
00:19:04,388 --> 00:19:06,753
- Ethan.
- I understand, Brandt.

219
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,741
We didn't have this conversation.

220
00:19:08,766 --> 00:19:11,906
I disappeared in London.
You don't know where I am.

221
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:13,495
If I'm dead or alive.

222
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,049
This man you saw.
Can you find him?

223
00:19:17,245 --> 00:19:20,152
I won't stop until I do.

224
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:23,549
This may very well be
our last mission, Ethan.

225
00:19:23,574 --> 00:19:25,210
Make it count.

226
00:19:25,235 --> 00:19:26,931
Brandt.

227
00:19:46,095 --> 00:19:47,473
Since we are going
to be work together,

228
00:19:47,498 --> 00:19:50,158
I want you to choose your
next works very carefully.

229
00:19:50,183 --> 00:19:51,302
Where is Hunt?

230
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:53,254
- I don't know.
- Don't lie to me, Brandt.

231
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,036
I have no way of contacting him.

232
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,870
He's deep cover. Last I heard,
he's tracking the Syndicate.

233
00:19:57,895 --> 00:19:59,203
Let's cut the bull.

234
00:19:59,228 --> 00:20:02,253
You know who we are.
You know what we are capable of.

235
00:20:02,278 --> 00:20:07,096
How come the CIA has never discovered
any actual Intel regarding this Syndicate.

236
00:20:07,121 --> 00:20:09,779
- What are you implying?
- Not implying, stating.

237
00:20:09,804 --> 00:20:12,070
Leveling an accusation actually.

238
00:20:12,095 --> 00:20:15,684
Hunt is both arsonist and fireman
at the same time.

239
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:18,319
I believe that the Syndicate
is a figment of his imagination.

240
00:20:18,344 --> 00:20:21,630
Created to justify
the IMF's existence.

241
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:24,006
I'm going to find him, Brandt.
And when I do,

242
00:20:24,031 --> 00:20:30,429
he will be called upon to answer for every
wanton active mayhem he's responsible for.

243
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:34,473
Welcome to the CIA.

244
00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:37,448
You'll never find him.

245
00:20:37,473 --> 00:20:39,319
Set your watch, Brandt.

246
00:20:39,344 --> 00:20:42,840
Ethan Hunt is living his
last day as a free man.

247
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:45,888
6 months later.

248
00:20:56,732 --> 00:20:58,873
All right, everybody. Heads up.

249
00:20:58,898 --> 00:21:00,572
This is it.

250
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:03,004
Alpha team prep. Standing by.

251
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:05,045
- Execute.
- Langley brimstone, go.

252
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,286
I say again. We are a go.

253
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,961
Langley, there's nobody here.

254
00:22:12,222 --> 00:22:15,914
Langley brimstone.
Face the north wall.

255
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,931
B. Dunn

256
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:24,367
Dunn.

257
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:28,519
Is it that time already. Okay.

258
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,209
I'm going to ask you
a series of control questions.

259
00:23:32,234 --> 00:23:33,909
I know and I'm gonna
answer truthfully.

260
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:36,473
And then you gonna ask
me to lie intentionally.

261
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,461
- State your name.
- The King of Norway.

262
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,454
See, that's a lie.

263
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:43,248
I'm actually third in line
to the throne.

264
00:23:43,273 --> 00:23:44,913
My brother was...

265
00:23:44,938 --> 00:23:47,415
- Has Ethan Hunt contacted you?
- Why would he contact me?

266
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,279
Hunt has resurfaced.
This time in Cuba.

267
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:54,263
He... left these behind.

268
00:23:54,538 --> 00:23:56,673
Tell me what you make of them.

269
00:23:56,975 --> 00:23:58,678
I don't know.
He's taken up scrap booking?

270
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,583
Look at the photographs, Dunn.

271
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:03,476
All of them are either
missing or dead, everyone.

272
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:05,101
All of them were
government agents.

273
00:24:05,126 --> 00:24:08,144
Russian, French, British, Israelis,
you name it.

274
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:11,438
These are highly classified files and yet
Hunt had no problem collecting them.

275
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:14,513
And he always seems
to be a step ahead of us.

276
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:16,903
- I wonder how?
- Are you suggesting I'm helping him?

277
00:24:16,928 --> 00:24:19,129
That thought had cross my mind.

278
00:24:19,154 --> 00:24:20,854
6 months, I have been here.

279
00:24:20,885 --> 00:24:24,912
Sifting through mountains of metadata
and exabytes of encoded excrement.

280
00:24:24,937 --> 00:24:28,991
I had decrypted, processed, passed
more data than anyone in my section.

281
00:24:29,016 --> 00:24:30,960
And yet every week,
you hold me in here.

282
00:24:30,985 --> 00:24:33,940
And you ask me the same question,
just in a different way.

283
00:24:33,965 --> 00:24:37,492
And today,
you haven't answered it.

284
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:43,103
You seem to thinks I have
some kind of obligation to him.

285
00:24:43,128 --> 00:24:45,726
Okay, nothing could be
further from the truth.

286
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:52,469
Ethan Hunt is still out there in the field,
and I'm stuck here answering for it.

287
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:54,963
We're not friends.

288
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,945
I owe him nothing.

289
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:06,029
That'll be all, Dunn.

290
00:26:04,153 --> 00:26:06,663
Welcome to Vienna, Benji.
Missed me?

291
00:26:06,688 --> 00:26:08,759
Ethan, where are you?
Where the hell have you been?

292
00:26:08,784 --> 00:26:10,950
No act.. you know what? Please,
don't tell me that,

293
00:26:10,975 --> 00:26:13,944
because it's just another thing I would
have to lie about in my weekly polygraph.

294
00:26:13,969 --> 00:26:16,169
Everything is going to be fine.
Just keep walking.

295
00:26:16,194 --> 00:26:18,534
But, make sure you're
not being follow. ed.

296
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,771
Oh. I didn't win those
opera tickets, did I?

297
00:26:20,783 --> 00:26:21,777
No, I'm afraid not.

298
00:26:21,802 --> 00:26:23,477
- So, where do we meet?
- We don't.

299
00:26:23,502 --> 00:26:26,355
For your sake,
we shouldn't be seen together.

300
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,972
You have mail.

301
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:30,935
- Who is he?
- That's what we're here to find out.

302
00:26:30,991 --> 00:26:34,112
What I do know, is he's our only
possible link to the Syndicate

303
00:26:34,714 --> 00:26:37,113
and I have reason to believe that
he's going to be here tonight.

304
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:40,333
But I can't find him alone.
Are you in?

305
00:26:40,358 --> 00:26:43,691
- Are you in?
- Yes, of course. Of course.

306
00:26:43,716 --> 00:26:47,187
- So, what's the play?
- Simple. You find him, we tag him.

307
00:26:47,212 --> 00:26:50,114
- I follow him wherever he goes.
- And after that?

308
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:53,199
After that you're on a plane,
back at work Monday morning.

309
00:26:53,224 --> 00:26:56,539
- No one is the wiser.
- What? That's it?

310
00:26:56,564 --> 00:26:58,135
You're in enough
danger as it is.

311
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,755
I didn't want to involve you
this much but I had no choice.

312
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,575
Whoa. If you're gonna bring me
all this way,

313
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,179
you could at least give me something
a little be more... you know, dramatic.

314
00:27:06,204 --> 00:27:09,188
Benji, we are trying
to keep a low profile.

315
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:12,874
You want drama, go to the opera.

316
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:44,552
- Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
- Yes, I am.

317
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:53,911
Am I correct in assuming that is
the Chancellor of Austria?

318
00:27:53,936 --> 00:27:57,441
- Yes, you are.
- Did you know he's going to be here?

319
00:27:57,466 --> 00:27:59,128
No - Right.

320
00:27:59,153 --> 00:28:01,477
Well. We have a European
Heads of State here,

321
00:28:01,502 --> 00:28:05,018
at the same time as we're
looking for a nefarious terrorist.

322
00:28:05,043 --> 00:28:07,687
And I'm sure the two things
are completely unrelated.

323
00:28:07,699 --> 00:28:08,585
Benji.

324
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:12,295
Mean while I'll try and overlook the fact that
you're an international fugitive wanted by the CIA.

325
00:28:12,307 --> 00:28:13,540
Benji.

326
00:28:13,565 --> 00:28:16,224
And this little unsanctioned
operation is tenement-ed treasonous.

327
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,127
Benji.

328
00:28:17,152 --> 00:28:18,474
Because as you stated earlier,

329
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:20,314
I will be back in my desk
on Monday morning,

330
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:23,236
playing video games and no one
will be any be the wiser.

331
00:28:23,262 --> 00:28:24,989
- The show's about to start, Benji.
- Right.

332
00:28:25,014 --> 00:28:27,135
Just take your position,
tell me what you see.

333
00:28:27,147 --> 00:28:27,858
Okay.

334
00:28:27,883 --> 00:28:30,191
Nice tux, by the way.

335
00:28:48,747 --> 00:28:51,114
Stage is set. Ready lights.

336
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:53,326
Ready lights.

337
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:02,561
The final preparations ready.

338
00:29:02,586 --> 00:29:04,838
Stay alert, please.

339
00:29:38,638 --> 00:29:43,111
Join the IMF. See the world,
on a monitor

340
00:29:43,136 --> 00:29:44,939
in a closet.

341
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,981
Okay, I have eyes.

342
00:30:29,006 --> 00:30:30,769
Searching.

343
00:31:32,312 --> 00:31:35,898
- Talk to me, Benji.
- Nothing yet. Standby.

344
00:31:37,043 --> 00:31:41,955
I know you're here.
Where're you.

345
00:31:47,014 --> 00:31:49,674
Uh Ethan, I might have something for you.
Can't confirm.

346
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,531
- Where?
- Backstage, I will direct you.

347
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,865
Take the door on your left.
He should be right in front of you.

348
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:47,644
Benji, did you see that?
See what?

349
00:32:48,262 --> 00:32:49,355
A woman.

350
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,134
What woman? Where're you?

351
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:53,041
I can't see you.

352
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:14,042
- What happened?
- I don't know

353
00:35:27,023 --> 00:35:29,926
Ethan, do you copy?
Ethan, come in.

354
00:37:51,258 --> 00:37:54,601
Ethan, the lighting booth.
Ethan, do you copy?

355
00:37:54,626 --> 00:37:56,125
Oh god.

356
00:39:21,948 --> 00:39:24,163
It's a flash wound.

357
00:39:58,807 --> 00:40:01,242
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

358
00:40:05,894 --> 00:40:09,534
Surround the building.
Secure the exits.

359
00:40:11,226 --> 00:40:15,111
I've a way out. Interested?

360
00:40:16,157 --> 00:40:17,955
Lead the way.

361
00:40:25,868 --> 00:40:29,250
- Anything you want to tell me?
- No, not right now.

362
00:40:29,275 --> 00:40:32,466
- How's the pace?
- Don't wait for me.

363
00:40:40,287 --> 00:40:42,214
What's next?

364
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:45,082
Alright.

365
00:40:45,578 --> 00:40:46,972
There.

366
00:40:54,682 --> 00:40:56,408
Shoes.

367
00:40:56,535 --> 00:40:58,671
Shoes, please.

368
00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:55,918
If anything happens to you...

369
00:41:55,943 --> 00:41:58,772
Nothing is going to happen to me.

370
00:41:59,161 --> 00:42:01,084
Stop the car!

371
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,666
Get in.

372
00:42:12,272 --> 00:42:14,084
Go go go.

373
00:42:21,685 --> 00:42:24,364
What the...!
She tried to shoot me.

374
00:42:24,389 --> 00:42:27,064
It doesn't make her
a bad person.

375
00:42:27,181 --> 00:42:29,812
- I'm gonna have to search you.
- You have to let me go.

376
00:42:29,837 --> 00:42:31,357
Oh oh. Not a chance.

377
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:33,209
I assume you're deep
cover back in London but

378
00:42:33,221 --> 00:42:35,021
isn't this taking the
role a little too far.

379
00:42:35,046 --> 00:42:36,224
Hang on a minute, you know her?

380
00:42:36,249 --> 00:42:38,354
Oh.
We haven't formerly introduced.

381
00:42:38,379 --> 00:42:40,774
But I am pretty sure
she's British intelligence.

382
00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:43,738
Ilsa Faust. You're Ethan Hunt.

383
00:42:43,763 --> 00:42:47,734
And... that shade is
very hard to find.

384
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:50,920
- What were you doing at the opera tonight?
- What? Aside from killing the Chancellor.

385
00:42:50,945 --> 00:42:55,107
Saving your life in London put me in a
tight spot with some very dangerous people.

386
00:42:55,132 --> 00:42:57,604
I was sent to kill the Chancellor
to regain their trust.

387
00:42:57,629 --> 00:42:59,323
Ha. So, you admit
that you killed him?

388
00:42:59,348 --> 00:43:02,492
I went through the motion,
that's not the same thing.

389
00:43:02,517 --> 00:43:05,561
You thought you put him in the hospital,
take him out of harm's way.

390
00:43:05,586 --> 00:43:07,276
The same thing you tried to do.

391
00:43:07,301 --> 00:43:09,728
You're not gonna believe that, are you?
What about the rest of her team?

392
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:13,610
You means those other 2 idiots?
I can only assumed they were redundancies.

393
00:43:13,635 --> 00:43:17,678
In case you didn't follow through.
One man to kill the Chancellor,

394
00:43:17,746 --> 00:43:20,320
the other one to kill you.
A test.

395
00:43:20,345 --> 00:43:22,304
Second one I failed,
thanks to you.

396
00:43:22,352 --> 00:43:25,742
And the car bomb was insurance.

397
00:43:29,588 --> 00:43:31,693
We have a tail.

398
00:43:33,002 --> 00:43:34,844
Who is he?

399
00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:37,027
We're after the same thing,
and I can help you.

400
00:43:37,052 --> 00:43:39,949
If you want to bring down the Syndicate,
you've to let me out.

401
00:43:39,974 --> 00:43:41,980
They're closing.

402
00:43:42,863 --> 00:43:45,490
This has to look like an escape.
So, you just throw me out anywhere.

403
00:43:45,515 --> 00:43:47,978
Tell me who he is.

404
00:43:48,003 --> 00:43:49,311
Oh!

405
00:43:50,095 --> 00:43:52,947
Oh. Change of plan.
Throw her out!

406
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:57,239
You have everything
you need to find me.

407
00:44:12,729 --> 00:44:16,718
Less than 24 hours after we interviewed
Benji Dunn about Ethan Hunt.

408
00:44:16,743 --> 00:44:19,273
He was on a plane to Vienna
with tickets to the opera.

409
00:44:19,301 --> 00:44:22,576
And within 6 hours of his arrival,
the Chancellor was dead.

410
00:44:22,601 --> 00:44:25,046
Now, that might be circumstance
to some public defendant.

411
00:44:25,071 --> 00:44:28,200
But to the CIA,
that is actionable intelligence.

412
00:44:28,201 --> 00:44:30,367
Consider the moment,
the possibility that.

413
00:44:30,379 --> 00:44:32,715
Ethan's investigation
lead him to the opera.

414
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,413
And he's the one with
the actionable intelligence.

415
00:44:34,414 --> 00:44:38,562
In any case. Finding Hunt
is no longer our pet project.

416
00:44:38,602 --> 00:44:42,860
The Special Activity Division
will now have full discretion.

417
00:44:43,499 --> 00:44:44,899
You mean shoot to kill?

418
00:44:44,924 --> 00:44:49,586
Whether Hunt lives or dies.
It's entirely up to him.

419
00:45:49,149 --> 00:45:52,558
New identity, passport,
cash, road map.

420
00:45:52,591 --> 00:45:54,162
There's a change of clothes
in that bag, right there.

421
00:45:54,187 --> 00:45:57,044
Everything you need to
make it to DC undetected.

422
00:45:57,069 --> 00:45:59,830
Once you're there,
you'll have to inform on me.

423
00:45:59,856 --> 00:46:01,694
- I'm suppose... what? Sorry, what?
- Tell the truth.

424
00:46:01,695 --> 00:46:04,653
You came to Vienna believing
you won 2 tickets to the opera.

425
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:08,036
And I attempted to recruit you into
assassinating the Chancellor, you refused.

426
00:46:08,061 --> 00:46:09,026
That is not the true.

427
00:46:09,038 --> 00:46:11,205
Your life depends on
them believing you, Benji.

428
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:13,645
It'll go easier if you tell them
what they want to hear.

429
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:17,312
Ethan, at least tell me
what this is all about.

430
00:46:25,454 --> 00:46:27,783
You recognized anyone?

431
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:43,359
- Him.
- He's former KSA, German intelligence.

432
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:45,542
Missing, presumed dead.

433
00:46:45,891 --> 00:46:47,841
He was at the opera tonight.

434
00:46:47,866 --> 00:46:49,415
This one too.

435
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,884
- Former Mossad.
- Let me guess. Presumed dead.

436
00:46:52,991 --> 00:46:55,450
Tonight, I made it official.

437
00:46:56,364 --> 00:46:58,747
I was looking for him
in Bosporus.

438
00:46:58,772 --> 00:47:02,811
The same day a car accident
killed the visiting President of Malawi.

439
00:47:03,485 --> 00:47:06,263
He slipped away again in Jakarta.

440
00:47:06,376 --> 00:47:09,410
Hours before a passenger plane
vanished over the Pacific

441
00:47:09,435 --> 00:47:12,225
with 236 passengers.

442
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,809
I just missed him
in the Philippines.

443
00:47:14,834 --> 00:47:19,937
Right before a fired petrochemical plant
gassed a village of 2,000 people.

444
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:24,860
You're saying these accidents
are somehow connected.

445
00:47:25,756 --> 00:47:29,884
That missing plane was carrying
the Secretary of the World Bank.

446
00:47:30,801 --> 00:47:34,411
That fire bank corrupted
a global arms cooperation.

447
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,923
That wreck triggered a civil war.

448
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:41,499
These are no accidents.

449
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:46,935
They're links in a chain. The work of
a single organization, the Syndicate.

450
00:47:47,075 --> 00:47:48,346
A rogue nation.

451
00:47:48,371 --> 00:47:51,478
Trained to do what we do.
Inbuilt with a new sense of purpose.

452
00:47:51,503 --> 00:47:53,834
Destroy the system that created them.

453
00:47:53,859 --> 00:47:56,418
Regardless if who's in the way.

454
00:47:56,912 --> 00:47:59,246
An anti-IMF.

455
00:47:59,271 --> 00:48:02,947
And since Hunley shut us down,
they've been escalating unchecked.

456
00:48:02,972 --> 00:48:05,675
Killing the Chancellor tonight
was a statement.

457
00:48:05,699 --> 00:48:07,825
The start of a new phase.

458
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:12,230
Or they could just be
a series of random disasters.

459
00:48:13,139 --> 00:48:15,430
He was there.

460
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,792
Every time.

461
00:48:16,817 --> 00:48:19,931
Just like he was there tonight.
I'm sure of it.

462
00:48:20,238 --> 00:48:23,612
I don't know who he is,
where he's from.

463
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:25,754
How he's funded.

464
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:27,893
But I know he's the key.

465
00:48:27,918 --> 00:48:30,435
Ethan, this is what I sign up for.

466
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,786
- Let me help you find him.
- That's why I brought you here.

467
00:48:32,811 --> 00:48:35,230
In the first place.
And look what happened.

468
00:48:35,255 --> 00:48:37,036
I can't protect you.

469
00:48:37,061 --> 00:48:39,019
That's why I need you to leave.

470
00:48:39,044 --> 00:48:42,277
It's not your decision
to make, Ethan.

471
00:48:42,302 --> 00:48:43,890
I'm a field agent.

472
00:48:43,915 --> 00:48:46,765
I know the risks.
More than that, I'm your friend.

473
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,709
No matter what I... con
a polygraph every week.

474
00:48:48,734 --> 00:48:51,793
Now you called me because
you needed my help.

475
00:48:51,818 --> 00:48:55,028
And you still do.
So, I'm staying.

476
00:48:55,053 --> 00:48:57,778
And that's all we're
gonna say about that.

477
00:49:01,724 --> 00:49:05,191
Okay - Good.

478
00:49:06,713 --> 00:49:08,699
Where do we start?

479
00:49:10,058 --> 00:49:11,708
Ilsa.

480
00:49:13,759 --> 00:49:16,406
Right. And how do we find her?

481
00:49:16,431 --> 00:49:18,867
She said we've
everything we need.

482
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,520
We had an agreement.

483
00:50:00,545 --> 00:50:02,399
You send me to do
a job, I'd do it.

484
00:50:02,424 --> 00:50:05,379
- But my way, not yours.
- When did I deviate?

485
00:50:05,404 --> 00:50:07,568
You put 2 more gunman
at the opera tonight.

486
00:50:07,593 --> 00:50:09,216
One of them try to kill me.

487
00:50:09,242 --> 00:50:10,360
You missed.

488
00:50:10,385 --> 00:50:12,986
I missed because Ethan Hunt
was there looking for you.

489
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:16,490
Ethan Hunt is in Vienna because
you allow him escape in London.

490
00:50:16,515 --> 00:50:20,653
Vinter would've kill him in London
and that's not what you asked for.

491
00:50:20,678 --> 00:50:23,505
Twice now
you've let him slipped away.

492
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,207
Curious.

493
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:29,711
Are you questioning
my loyalty or my ability.

494
00:50:30,642 --> 00:50:32,852
- Can't decide.
- I've told you before.

495
00:50:32,877 --> 00:50:35,071
Trust me or kill me.

496
00:50:35,096 --> 00:50:38,083
But If you're going to kill me,
be the man.

497
00:50:39,131 --> 00:50:41,380
Do it yourself.

498
00:51:08,971 --> 00:51:11,310
Did he say anything?

499
00:51:12,229 --> 00:51:17,078
- He knows about Morocco.
- What did he know about Morocco?

500
00:51:17,103 --> 00:51:21,472
He knows about the power plant.
He doesn't know what's in it.

501
00:51:22,785 --> 00:51:24,965
Find him, please.

502
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,598
He'll find me.

503
00:51:28,328 --> 00:51:30,613
I've him seen to that.

504
00:51:35,264 --> 00:51:37,374
- Well, that's interesting.
- What is it?

505
00:51:37,399 --> 00:51:41,114
It's a SCIF. Secure Computer Facility
offline, ultra-contained.

506
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,256
It's impossible to hack in
from the outside.

507
00:51:43,257 --> 00:51:45,804
It's essentially a digital
safety deposit box.

508
00:51:45,829 --> 00:51:49,499
Very strange thing for a young lady
to be carrying in her sundries.

509
00:51:49,524 --> 00:51:53,890
- Where's it located?
- Morocco.

510
00:51:55,113 --> 00:51:56,968
Morocco.

511
00:53:12,285 --> 00:53:16,055
Now, what brings you
gentlemen to Casablanca?

512
00:53:45,617 --> 00:53:49,802
Good to see you - What couldn't
you tell me over the telephone?

513
00:53:50,973 --> 00:53:53,896
The Chancellor of Austria
was assassinated.

514
00:53:53,921 --> 00:53:56,810
We believe that Ethan
and Benji were there.

515
00:53:56,835 --> 00:54:00,458
Huntley's handed this over
to Special Activities Division.

516
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:03,999
We need to find Ethan
before they do.

517
00:54:04,467 --> 00:54:06,771
That's where you come in.

518
00:54:08,228 --> 00:54:11,226
- Not interested.
- Okay. Look, Luther.

519
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:15,506
Look, man. I know Ethan.
I don't know you.

520
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:18,809
All I know about you is that
you chose to work for Hunley.

521
00:54:18,835 --> 00:54:22,467
Yeah, all I know about you
is you chose to resign.

522
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:25,216
You don't have to
worry about Ethan.

523
00:54:25,241 --> 00:54:28,297
- They'll never catch him.
- No, they're not going to catch him. No.

524
00:54:28,322 --> 00:54:30,696
This is the CIA, this is Hunley
we're talking about.

525
00:54:30,721 --> 00:54:34,208
Thing are out of control
And they're going to kill him.

526
00:54:34,703 --> 00:54:38,061
They're going to kill Ethan.
They're going to kill Benji.

527
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:41,916
We have to get to them first.
Are you going to help me?

528
00:54:48,362 --> 00:54:51,069
You need to understand something.

529
00:54:51,848 --> 00:54:54,392
Ethan is my friend.

530
00:54:54,728 --> 00:54:58,796
And if I have 1 second of doubt
whose side you're on.

531
00:55:01,539 --> 00:55:03,660
I believe you.

532
00:55:04,607 --> 00:55:06,634
- Alright.
- Alright.

533
00:55:06,659 --> 00:55:10,087
- What do I have to go on?
- Not much.

534
00:55:10,112 --> 00:55:12,295
And not a lot of time.

535
00:55:13,761 --> 00:55:18,530
His name is Solomon Lane.
He created the Syndicate.

536
00:55:18,555 --> 00:55:20,548
Where does he come from?

537
00:55:21,025 --> 00:55:23,814
He's former British intelligence.

538
00:55:24,101 --> 00:55:26,620
Well. If British intelligence
knows the Syndicate exist,

539
00:55:26,645 --> 00:55:28,832
why don't they
just tell the CIA?

540
00:55:28,857 --> 00:55:34,105
Because they don't want anyone knowing the
Syndicate was created by one of their own.

541
00:55:34,425 --> 00:55:37,259
I was sent undercover
to earn Lane's trust.

542
00:55:37,284 --> 00:55:40,541
And eventually identifying
the members of his organization.

543
00:55:40,566 --> 00:55:43,077
For the first time in 2 years,

544
00:55:43,102 --> 00:55:45,567
I'm close to knowing
who they are.

545
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:50,140
Lane had a ledger. It contain
the identities of his operatives,

546
00:55:50,165 --> 00:55:54,129
his terrorist associates, the entire
inner workings of the Syndicate.

547
00:55:54,154 --> 00:55:57,339
One of his agents stole it
hoping to blackmail him.

548
00:55:57,364 --> 00:56:01,475
He kept it in a secure computer
facility for safe keeping.

549
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,282
He died being interrogated
for the access code.

550
00:56:04,307 --> 00:56:07,245
Leaving Lane with a serious problem.

551
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:11,534
So the key to crushing
Lane is sitting in a

552
00:56:11,546 --> 00:56:14,940
computer just waiting
for someone to take it?

553
00:56:15,186 --> 00:56:18,939
So why hasn't Lane just
send someone to steal it?

554
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:23,495
Oh, he has. He sent me.

555
00:56:23,624 --> 00:56:25,515
And I can tell you.

556
00:56:26,401 --> 00:56:28,529
It's impossible.

557
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:35,479
The facility is hidden beneath the
local power plant under military guard.

558
00:56:35,504 --> 00:56:38,365
And the only way to download
the ledger is through

559
00:56:38,377 --> 00:56:40,912
the central computer
terminal located there.

560
00:56:41,645 --> 00:56:45,184
To reach the terminal,
you'll need to pass the main gates.

561
00:56:45,673 --> 00:56:49,168
Access the elevator with
fingerprint recognition.

562
00:56:49,688 --> 00:56:53,077
And open 3 separate combination locks.

563
00:56:58,122 --> 00:56:59,607
Well, that's easy. We
just impersonate the

564
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:01,255
agent who stole the ledger
in the first place.

565
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,107
And. I get to wear a mask.

566
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:30,353
Unfortunately, even if you can make
it through every other security measure

567
00:57:30,378 --> 00:57:34,195
you won't beat the last one. That's
because it's protected by gait analysis.

568
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:36,444
A step beyond facial recognition.

569
00:57:36,469 --> 00:57:39,240
These cameras actually know
how the agent walks,

570
00:57:39,265 --> 00:57:43,697
how he talks, how he moves,
right down to his facial takes.

571
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,868
So, what you're saying is,
no mask can beat it.

572
00:57:52,894 --> 00:57:54,339
We're busted before we could
even get into the vault.

573
00:57:54,364 --> 00:57:56,585
And I wind up in a Morocco
jail playing mommies

574
00:57:56,597 --> 00:57:58,460
and daddies without
a mother strangler.

575
00:57:58,485 --> 00:58:00,568
Okay, I don't get
to wear a mask.

576
00:58:00,593 --> 00:58:02,717
And there's no other way
into the computer lab?

577
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:03,542
No other way in.

578
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:05,917
- Air Shaft?
- 6 inch diameter pipe.

579
00:58:05,942 --> 00:58:09,572
- Foundation?
- 12 feet of concrete, top and bottom.

580
00:58:09,597 --> 00:58:11,275
- Electrical conduit?
- Bottom line is,

581
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:12,969
there's no way into
that terminal unless

582
00:58:12,994 --> 00:58:17,188
your profile is pre-installed
in the security system.

583
00:58:17,741 --> 00:58:19,382
Profile?

584
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:21,471
Where're the profile stored?

585
00:58:21,496 --> 00:58:25,603
All security data is stored
offline in the liquid cooler aid.

586
00:58:25,642 --> 00:58:28,708
Here, inside the torus,
liquid cooled.

587
00:58:28,733 --> 00:58:30,633
You mean that thing
is under water?

588
00:58:30,658 --> 00:58:32,813
- Yes.
- Yes.

589
00:58:32,838 --> 00:58:33,919
Okay.

590
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:38,283
So, to get the ledger, one of us
needs to enter the torus

591
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:41,447
and change the security profile.

592
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:46,545
So that the other one can access
the computer without being caught.

593
00:58:47,821 --> 00:58:51,841
- That's the only way.
- That's the only way.

594
00:58:52,731 --> 00:58:53,968
Can I get in through there.

595
00:58:53,993 --> 00:58:56,219
- What's that?
- That's the service hatch.

596
00:58:56,244 --> 00:58:59,735
It can only be opened from the inside
If you try and open it from the outside,

597
00:58:59,771 --> 00:59:03,185
you'll be hit with 70 thousand
gallons of pressurized water.

598
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,548
Where does the water come from?

599
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,506
Desalinized seawater
flows through the intake.

600
00:59:06,531 --> 00:59:08,863
In the pipeline.
And before you ask.

601
00:59:08,888 --> 00:59:11,222
The system is
designed to shut down

602
00:59:11,234 --> 00:59:14,233
automatically if any
metal enters the intake.

603
00:59:14,258 --> 00:59:16,787
No oxygen tanks.

604
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:20,351
Alright. Well, how long
will it take to free

605
00:59:20,363 --> 00:59:22,538
swim from the intake
to the service hatch.

606
00:59:22,579 --> 00:59:24,962
2 minutes.
With the current at full power.

607
00:59:24,986 --> 00:59:27,478
Well. Then, you just have to hold
your breath for 2 minutes.

608
00:59:27,504 --> 00:59:29,472
What about installing
the security profile?

609
00:59:29,484 --> 00:59:31,378
Well. That's gonna
be like a minute tops.

610
00:59:31,403 --> 00:59:33,378
So, I have to hold my breath
for 3 minutes?

611
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:34,563
You can do that.

612
00:59:34,588 --> 00:59:36,816
But I think you're overlooking,
is the physical exertion.

613
00:59:36,841 --> 00:59:39,955
The more you exert yourself,
the faster you consume oxygen.

614
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:41,502
Don't worry about him. Alright.

615
00:59:41,503 --> 00:59:45,200
All he has to do is install the fake
profile before I get to the gait analysis.

616
00:59:45,225 --> 00:59:47,619
You said it yourself,
it's the only way.

617
00:59:47,644 --> 00:59:50,252
That doesn't sound impossible.

618
00:59:53,334 --> 00:59:56,102
Satellite over-watch
covering all 7 continents,

619
00:59:56,127 --> 01:00:00,351
DNA profiling, facial recognition,
drone surveillance, drone strikes.

620
01:00:00,376 --> 01:00:03,196
So, how are we suppose to find
Ethan and Benji before they do?

621
01:00:03,221 --> 01:00:07,013
I'm not even looking for them.
I'm looking for her.

622
01:00:07,109 --> 01:00:08,888
What do you mean?

623
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:13,018
These sketches, what do you see?

624
01:00:14,198 --> 01:00:17,783
Ethan's not exactly sure
who this guys is.

625
01:00:18,845 --> 01:00:22,416
But this woman, he knows her.

626
01:00:22,441 --> 01:00:24,270
He trust her.

627
01:00:24,295 --> 01:00:26,951
I'm betting that if he's not
already with her, he's on his way.

628
01:00:26,952 --> 01:00:28,477
Find her, find Ethan.

629
01:00:28,502 --> 01:00:30,949
Tell me it's possible to pull
facial recognition of a sketch.

630
01:00:30,974 --> 01:00:35,062
For mere mortals, no.
For me, I could've done this at home.

631
01:00:35,087 --> 01:00:36,845
Alright.

632
01:00:40,795 --> 01:00:43,515
- How long is this going to take?
- Found her.

633
01:00:45,916 --> 01:00:50,341
CCTV picked her up
at the airport in Casablanca.

634
01:00:51,031 --> 01:00:53,279
What the hell?

635
01:00:53,946 --> 01:00:56,409
She's bad news.

636
01:01:16,957 --> 01:01:20,331
- Card.
- Hello.

637
01:01:24,837 --> 01:01:26,463
Sorry.

638
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:59,704
- Your card is not working.
- Benji, we're in.

639
01:02:03,675 --> 01:02:05,491
Thank you.

640
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:45,971
One more time.
You have 3 minutes.

641
01:02:45,996 --> 01:02:49,132
2.5 minutes to switch
the security profile.

642
01:02:49,157 --> 01:02:52,272
30 seconds to escape
through the service hatch.

643
01:02:52,297 --> 01:02:57,142
Remember, conserve oxygen.
Don't move a muscle if you don't have to.

644
01:03:14,455 --> 01:03:16,690
I'm in the elevator.

645
01:03:27,246 --> 01:03:30,016
That current will
carry you to a torus.

646
01:03:30,041 --> 01:03:32,498
Once you're there,
I'll shut it down.

647
01:03:32,523 --> 01:03:36,340
Important note.
The profile is in slot 108.

648
01:03:36,364 --> 01:03:38,401
And a slightly more
important note,

649
01:03:38,427 --> 01:03:41,354
if you haven't switched that profile
before I reach the gait analysis,

650
01:03:41,379 --> 01:03:42,722
I'm dead.

651
01:03:42,747 --> 01:03:44,816
Thank you, Benji.

652
01:04:53,666 --> 01:04:57,282
- What's the problem?
- The cooling system is rebooting...

653
01:04:57,307 --> 01:04:59,544
by itself.

654
01:06:08,455 --> 01:06:09,841
Oaf.

655
01:06:23,732 --> 01:06:25,423
All systems' normal.

656
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:28,246
All systems at full power.

657
01:06:33,387 --> 01:06:36,434
No-no-no...

658
01:10:02,757 --> 01:10:06,426
You're alright. You're okay.

659
01:10:06,451 --> 01:10:08,216
See. What did I told you.

660
01:10:08,217 --> 01:10:11,816
Difficult, absolutely,
but certainly not impossible...

661
01:10:12,738 --> 01:10:16,473
Jesus, is he alright?
What happened? What happened?

662
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:30,152
Okay. Okay.

663
01:10:30,884 --> 01:10:32,368
Here.

664
01:10:33,701 --> 01:10:35,187
Hey.

665
01:10:35,212 --> 01:10:37,415
I misjudged you.

666
01:10:42,547 --> 01:10:45,060
Hey, man. Hey.
You okay? How're you doing?

667
01:10:45,086 --> 01:10:46,648
Hey, buddy.

668
01:10:47,427 --> 01:10:49,624
- Benji.
- Yes, it's Benji.

669
01:10:49,649 --> 01:10:51,216
You did good.

670
01:10:51,217 --> 01:10:53,222
You take a moment, alright.
Just-Just take a moment.

671
01:10:53,247 --> 01:10:55,671
There's nothing a little sunshine
and fresh air won't fix you.

672
01:10:55,696 --> 01:10:58,607
- You'll be as right as rain.
- What are you doing here?

673
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:00,698
Look-look-look...

674
01:11:00,699 --> 01:11:02,235
We got it.

675
01:11:02,236 --> 01:11:04,239
I knew we'll get it.

676
01:11:05,831 --> 01:11:07,491
Listen. I don't want to
sound ungrateful, okay.

677
01:11:07,516 --> 01:11:09,459
I appreciate everything
you do for me, but...

678
01:11:09,484 --> 01:11:12,452
one of these days,
you're gonna take it too far.

679
01:11:13,727 --> 01:11:15,650
We got it.

680
01:11:15,675 --> 01:11:18,024
We're gonna nail that...

681
01:11:26,695 --> 01:11:29,417
Wait. Wait.

682
01:11:31,762 --> 01:11:33,212
I thought you said
you can find him?

683
01:11:33,237 --> 01:11:36,243
I said I could locate him.
You've to find him.

684
01:11:36,268 --> 01:11:37,761
Right.

685
01:11:55,993 --> 01:11:57,995
Where's Hunt?

686
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:05,368
He's dead.

687
01:12:05,393 --> 01:12:06,716
Oh. That really hurts!

688
01:12:06,741 --> 01:12:08,168
- Can you walk?
- Yes, I can.

689
01:12:08,193 --> 01:12:11,775
We have to get to her
before Lane does.

690
01:13:00,452 --> 01:13:03,052
Whoa-whoa-whoa...
Are you okay to drive?

691
01:13:03,077 --> 01:13:05,361
I mean. A minute ago
you were dead.

692
01:13:05,386 --> 01:13:07,555
What are you talking about?

693
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:10,043
This is not gonna end well.

694
01:13:19,926 --> 01:13:21,765
There she is.

695
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:34,377
Stairs, stairs, stairs!

696
01:13:34,556 --> 01:13:36,885
Stairs, stairs, stairs!

697
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:40,774
Ah! God damn it.

698
01:14:10,842 --> 01:14:12,540
Whoa.

699
01:14:21,009 --> 01:14:22,460
Hey?

700
01:14:24,275 --> 01:14:25,969
I found them.

701
01:14:26,893 --> 01:14:29,093
Come on, man.

702
01:14:31,268 --> 01:14:33,302
Shit.

703
01:14:33,706 --> 01:14:35,347
It's a high-speed chase.

704
01:14:35,372 --> 01:14:37,657
You just had to get
the 4 by 4, didn't you?

705
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:39,367
Hey, look. Don't blame me.
You chose the car.

706
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:41,279
- You just had to have it!
- Do you want me to drive?

707
01:14:41,304 --> 01:14:42,671
- Do you want me to drive?
- Look, it's a stick.

708
01:14:42,696 --> 01:14:45,724
Look at this. Look how slow
you're going. Speed it up.

709
01:14:50,071 --> 01:14:52,074
Who's this guy?

710
01:14:53,546 --> 01:14:55,547
Shit!

711
01:15:13,952 --> 01:15:16,210
Aww!

712
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:24,077
Go-go-go-Go!

713
01:15:26,534 --> 01:15:29,342
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

714
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:34,990
Ho!

715
01:15:35,616 --> 01:15:38,001
Whoa-whoa-whoa...

716
01:15:45,214 --> 01:15:47,217
Here they come!

717
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:49,247
What're we gonna do?

718
01:16:01,781 --> 01:16:03,619
Gun!

719
01:16:06,235 --> 01:16:07,789
Do you have your seat belts on?

720
01:16:07,814 --> 01:16:09,982
What? You're asking me that now?

721
01:16:17,542 --> 01:16:19,736
- Hang on!
- Ah!

722
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:21,900
Aww!

723
01:16:58,579 --> 01:17:00,365
Are you good?

724
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:02,792
Things...
got a little out of hand.

725
01:17:02,817 --> 01:17:05,219
Aw! Look out!

726
01:17:09,555 --> 01:17:12,530
Okay. We're good?

727
01:17:20,755 --> 01:17:23,156
Oh, hi boys. What did I miss?

728
01:17:28,072 --> 01:17:31,066
Woo. That look sharp.
Careful, careful.

729
01:21:13,066 --> 01:21:15,422
So, what do we do now?

730
01:21:17,348 --> 01:21:21,144
Please tell me, you made
a copy of that disk..

731
01:21:22,839 --> 01:21:25,483
Of course I made a copy.

732
01:21:32,872 --> 01:21:34,874
So where are we going?

733
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:00,036
It's a ledger.

734
01:22:00,061 --> 01:22:02,254
The Syndicate's entire infrastructure.

735
01:22:02,279 --> 01:22:05,591
Who they are, the politicians they control,
and where the money comes from.

736
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:08,257
It's everything you want to know.

737
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:12,431
What makes you think this
so-called ledger is authentic?

738
01:22:12,456 --> 01:22:15,075
Why would Lane want it so badly
if it wasn't authentic?

739
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,629
Why would he ever
let you have it if it was?

740
01:22:17,654 --> 01:22:20,957
Did you never stop to consider
he may want me to have it?

741
01:22:20,982 --> 01:22:22,526
Misinformation, manipulation.

742
01:22:22,551 --> 01:22:25,176
What he does exercise,
what he's trained to do.

743
01:22:25,201 --> 01:22:28,482
Lane lies to you,
you sell his lies to Hunt.

744
01:22:28,507 --> 01:22:30,179
Together, you both are compromised.

745
01:22:30,204 --> 01:22:32,590
That's his ultimate objective.

746
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:34,495
This may be authentic.

747
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:39,780
But there's only one person I trust
to verify that information. You.

748
01:22:41,255 --> 01:22:42,724
No.

749
01:22:44,032 --> 01:22:46,799
My orders were to deliver you
information regarding the Syndicate.

750
01:22:46,824 --> 01:22:49,414
Your orders were to
infiltrate the Syndicate

751
01:22:49,426 --> 01:22:52,084
that we may learn more
about them first hand.

752
01:22:52,109 --> 01:22:54,381
This isn't prove, it's a test,
like everything else.

753
01:22:54,406 --> 01:22:56,938
The only way to pass,
is to go back.

754
01:22:56,963 --> 01:22:58,419
I can't do that.

755
01:22:58,444 --> 01:23:01,153
I betrayed Lane's trust
too many times.

756
01:23:01,178 --> 01:23:03,489
And in every instance, you
did so on you own volition.

757
01:23:03,514 --> 01:23:06,253
He was going to tortured
and killed an American agent.

758
01:23:06,278 --> 01:23:09,771
And you should've let him, and
you would still have Lane's trust.

759
01:23:09,796 --> 01:23:11,898
This is the trade,
Hunt understands that.

760
01:23:11,923 --> 01:23:14,466
I wasn't going to let him die.
He is our ally.

761
01:23:14,491 --> 01:23:19,049
There are no allies in state craft,
Ilsa. Only common interest.

762
01:23:19,074 --> 01:23:22,771
As it stands, Ethan Hunt
is a man without a country.

763
01:23:22,796 --> 01:23:27,509
This makes killing him
decidedly less complicated.

764
01:23:28,672 --> 01:23:30,532
Are you ordering
me to kill Hunt?

765
01:23:30,557 --> 01:23:33,567
Good god, no.
Nothing so crude as that, no.

766
01:23:34,278 --> 01:23:36,453
Lane will order you.

767
01:23:36,478 --> 01:23:41,657
And to regain his trust,
you will do it.

768
01:23:42,144 --> 01:23:45,328
You sent me to do a job.

769
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:47,248
I did it.

770
01:23:47,404 --> 01:23:49,439
Now, you bring me in.

771
01:23:49,463 --> 01:23:53,676
Might I remind you, you're
without a country of your own.

772
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:56,972
The director of the CIA called me
inquiring about you personally.

773
01:23:56,997 --> 01:23:59,553
Of course to protect your cover,
I had to lie.

774
01:23:59,578 --> 01:24:01,057
So, as far as the
Americans are concern,

775
01:24:01,082 --> 01:24:04,935
you're a rogue assassin,
a target of opportunity.

776
01:24:05,111 --> 01:24:08,414
A precious few people
know about your true identity.

777
01:24:08,439 --> 01:24:13,791
It would be unfortunate
if we forgot.

778
01:24:14,126 --> 01:24:17,153
You see, there really
is no choice, Ilsa.

779
01:24:17,178 --> 01:24:19,475
You're going back.

780
01:24:26,537 --> 01:24:29,954
Glad to know
you're still with us.

781
01:24:37,777 --> 01:24:39,059
What? What's happening?

782
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:40,518
I can't open it.

783
01:24:40,519 --> 01:24:41,737
What do you mean
you can't open it?

784
01:24:41,762 --> 01:24:44,010
I mean I can't open it, ever.

785
01:24:44,035 --> 01:24:45,824
That's a red box.

786
01:24:45,849 --> 01:24:47,717
- A what?
- It's a red box.

787
01:24:47,742 --> 01:24:50,667
The British government uses it
to transport national secrets.

788
01:24:50,692 --> 01:24:51,742
Doesn't sound good.

789
01:24:51,767 --> 01:24:54,266
Meaning it's triple encrypted.
You don't get into that thing

790
01:24:54,291 --> 01:24:57,008
unless you have fingerprints,
retinal scan, and

791
01:24:57,020 --> 01:24:59,750
a voice phrase spoken by
a specific individual.

792
01:24:59,775 --> 01:25:02,182
The Prime Minister
of Great Britain himself.

793
01:25:02,207 --> 01:25:03,392
Yes, him.

794
01:25:03,417 --> 01:25:05,479
So, what you're saying is,
there is no ledger.

795
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:07,992
Which means we have no proof
that the Syndicate even exist.

796
01:25:08,017 --> 01:25:09,477
So, we're back to square one.

797
01:25:09,502 --> 01:25:12,069
Only now, we're all
wanted by the CIA.

798
01:25:12,094 --> 01:25:14,014
I'm so proud of us.

799
01:25:14,039 --> 01:25:16,842
What I don't understand
is why is there a red

800
01:25:16,854 --> 01:25:19,547
box sat in a private
data vault in Morocco.

801
01:25:19,572 --> 01:25:21,903
And why would Lane want it
if he can't open it?

802
01:25:21,928 --> 01:25:25,258
If Lane wants it, you can bet
that he has a plan to open it.

803
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:29,093
And we just help him steal it.

804
01:25:32,256 --> 01:25:34,319
He's going to take
the Prime Minister.

805
01:25:34,334 --> 01:25:36,121
Yes, he is.

806
01:25:36,310 --> 01:25:37,502
The question is how?

807
01:25:37,527 --> 01:25:39,108
Well, we have to warn
the British government.

808
01:25:39,133 --> 01:25:41,137
- Yeah, MI6.
- No, no, Brandt.

809
01:25:41,162 --> 01:25:42,863
Put down the phone.
Let's think about this.

810
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:45,367
We have a responsibility to
warn the British government,

811
01:25:45,392 --> 01:25:47,879
and not gamble with
the Prime Minister's life.

812
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:50,682
Ethan, just so you
can beat the guy

813
01:25:50,707 --> 01:25:53,952
that's beaten you at every turn.

814
01:25:55,429 --> 01:25:57,671
Is that what you think this is?

815
01:25:57,734 --> 01:25:59,314
Brandt?

816
01:26:01,581 --> 01:26:04,111
Is that what you think this is?

817
01:26:04,537 --> 01:26:05,834
I think right now,

818
01:26:05,859 --> 01:26:07,968
you're incapable of seeing
that there's another way.

819
01:26:07,993 --> 01:26:11,499
And sometimes Ethan is the only one
capable of seeing the only way.

820
01:26:11,524 --> 01:26:14,164
And if he's wrong,
then we have Vienna

821
01:26:14,189 --> 01:26:15,280
all over again.

822
01:26:15,305 --> 01:26:18,040
No, you don't know him.
If he wants something to happen,

823
01:26:18,065 --> 01:26:19,444
there's no preventing it.

824
01:26:19,469 --> 01:26:21,481
That's why we have to
warn the British.

825
01:26:21,506 --> 01:26:23,889
Maybe that's exactly
what he wants us to do.

826
01:26:23,914 --> 01:26:26,123
Are you listening to yourself?
We're going to warn the British.

827
01:26:26,148 --> 01:26:28,732
No. We're going to find Lane,
we're going to get him.

828
01:26:28,757 --> 01:26:31,351
Before he takes the Prime Minister.

829
01:26:36,033 --> 01:26:37,441
Okay.

830
01:26:37,466 --> 01:26:40,383
Alright, Ethan.
We're going to find Lane.

831
01:26:40,408 --> 01:26:42,316
But please tell me.

832
01:26:42,317 --> 01:26:44,651
How're we going to do that?

833
01:27:23,398 --> 01:27:25,066
All is forgiven.

834
01:27:25,091 --> 01:27:27,197
That isn't a ledger, is it?

835
01:27:27,222 --> 01:27:29,510
You didn't take
a look for yourself?

836
01:27:29,535 --> 01:27:30,961
Of course I did.

837
01:27:30,962 --> 01:27:32,723
But the file was encrypted.

838
01:27:32,724 --> 01:27:34,250
And why would I lie to you?

839
01:27:34,275 --> 01:27:36,573
So that I would lie to Hunt.

840
01:27:37,835 --> 01:27:41,320
But he wouldn't have stolen it
if he knew what it was.

841
01:27:41,966 --> 01:27:44,261
And she wouldn't have helped him.

842
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,723
What is actually on that disk?

843
01:27:47,748 --> 01:27:51,468
I'll be honest with you when
you start being honest with me.

844
01:27:52,221 --> 01:27:54,873
And you and I, we both know
why you come back.

845
01:27:54,898 --> 01:27:56,747
Don't we?

846
01:27:58,881 --> 01:28:01,915
You're still alive because
I believe in your potential.

847
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:04,450
But I'm growing impatient.

848
01:28:05,256 --> 01:28:08,399
Why do you continue to resist?

849
01:28:11,762 --> 01:28:13,793
Well, if we're being honest,

850
01:28:14,426 --> 01:28:15,880
You're a terrorist.

851
01:28:15,905 --> 01:28:19,768
If that were true then my goal
would be to spread fear, but my...

852
01:28:19,793 --> 01:28:23,798
method is... far more surgical.

853
01:28:24,971 --> 01:28:26,948
You kill innocent people.

854
01:28:26,973 --> 01:28:32,006
I helped my government killed many
innocent people and more, so much more.

855
01:28:32,617 --> 01:28:35,612
Killing to keep things as they were.

856
01:28:35,637 --> 01:28:39,506
And now I'm killing
to bring about change.

857
01:28:39,719 --> 01:28:42,411
I think Ethan Hunt would disagree.

858
01:28:42,436 --> 01:28:44,621
Ethan Hunt is a gambler.

859
01:28:44,646 --> 01:28:46,889
And one day
his luck will run out,

860
01:28:46,914 --> 01:28:50,611
And thousands of innocent people
will pay the price.

861
01:28:50,636 --> 01:28:53,750
Which one of us
will be the villain then?

862
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:59,654
Nothing here. It's empty.

863
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:17,069
I'm interested

864
01:29:17,094 --> 01:29:19,655
to see who you blame

865
01:29:20,635 --> 01:29:23,236
for what happens next.

866
01:30:09,953 --> 01:30:11,427
So, that's her?

867
01:30:11,428 --> 01:30:13,536
That's her.

868
01:30:16,255 --> 01:30:18,258
I have to say

869
01:30:19,174 --> 01:30:21,374
you sure can ride.

870
01:30:23,618 --> 01:30:26,352
- Ethan.
- You're just doing your job.

871
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:29,720
That's all I'm going to
say about it.

872
01:30:30,969 --> 01:30:32,783
Atlee said you'd understand.

873
01:30:32,808 --> 01:30:36,591
Atlee, your handler
in British Intelligence.

874
01:30:39,351 --> 01:30:41,678
And he didn't bring you in?

875
01:30:43,113 --> 01:30:45,737
Even after you
gave him the disk?

876
01:30:45,762 --> 01:30:48,877
You knew perfectly well
it was blank.

877
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:52,632
That's a lie. The disk she took from me
was an exact copy. I'm of it.

878
01:30:52,657 --> 01:30:55,744
Was it in your possession
the entire time?

879
01:31:05,714 --> 01:31:07,331
Oh.

880
01:31:07,384 --> 01:31:10,706
They don't care
if you live or die.

881
01:31:17,421 --> 01:31:20,503
But you knew I was
going to take it to him.

882
01:31:20,528 --> 01:31:22,064
I hope you would.

883
01:31:22,089 --> 01:31:24,801
I hope it would be
enough to get you out.

884
01:31:25,086 --> 01:31:28,166
Whoa-whoa-whoa. That means Lane
doesn't have the disk, only we do.

885
01:31:28,191 --> 01:31:31,275
I have a question.
If the disk was blank,

886
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:33,460
why is she still alive?

887
01:31:33,485 --> 01:31:35,375
Unless, of course,

888
01:31:35,376 --> 01:31:37,786
Lane wanted us to find her.

889
01:31:38,968 --> 01:31:41,465
So, who're you working for now?

890
01:31:41,759 --> 01:31:45,836
Lane, Atlee, your government,
my government, they're all the same.

891
01:31:46,110 --> 01:31:48,235
We only think we're
fighting for the right

892
01:31:48,247 --> 01:31:50,581
side because that's what
we choose to believe.

893
01:31:51,497 --> 01:31:53,484
So what does that leave us?

894
01:31:53,485 --> 01:31:56,269
The way I see it,
you have 3 choices.

895
01:31:56,298 --> 01:32:00,027
One, you hand me and
the disk over to the CIA.

896
01:32:00,052 --> 01:32:01,870
I'm proof that Syndicate exist.

897
01:32:01,895 --> 01:32:05,398
Lane becomes their problem,
and... your work is done.

898
01:32:05,423 --> 01:32:07,936
- My thoughts exactly.
- Works for me.

899
01:32:07,961 --> 01:32:10,035
But you know they're
not going to believe you.

900
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:12,875
And you all will be
trialed for treason.

901
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:14,379
Lane goes free.

902
01:32:14,404 --> 01:32:16,314
I'm afraid she's has a point.

903
01:32:16,315 --> 01:32:20,395
Two, you let me walk away
to an uncertain fate.

904
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:24,088
You use the disk
as bait to trap Lane.

905
01:32:24,383 --> 01:32:27,169
But some part of you suspect
you've met your match.

906
01:32:27,194 --> 01:32:29,890
And being a gambler, you'll probably
end up handing Lane that disk

907
01:32:29,915 --> 01:32:32,202
whether you want to or not.

908
01:32:32,227 --> 01:32:34,476
That is entirely possible.

909
01:32:34,501 --> 01:32:36,503
And option three?

910
01:32:36,568 --> 01:32:38,831
Come away with me.

911
01:32:39,759 --> 01:32:41,846
Right now.

912
01:32:44,245 --> 01:32:46,745
Oh boy.

913
01:32:49,724 --> 01:32:51,500
And what about Lane?

914
01:32:51,501 --> 01:32:53,652
Forget about Lane.

915
01:32:53,677 --> 01:32:56,143
There will always be another Lane.

916
01:32:56,168 --> 01:32:59,516
There will always be
people like us to face him.

917
01:32:59,891 --> 01:33:03,408
We've done our part
and we've been cast aside.

918
01:33:03,922 --> 01:33:06,533
We can be anyone.

919
01:33:06,558 --> 01:33:09,130
We can do anything.

920
01:33:10,483 --> 01:33:12,978
It's only a matter of going.

921
01:33:25,865 --> 01:33:29,162
Lane sent you to deliver
a message, didn't he?

922
01:33:29,493 --> 01:33:32,444
I saved you life twice.
I won't be able to do it again.

923
01:33:32,469 --> 01:33:34,623
What's the message?

924
01:33:47,076 --> 01:33:48,804
Benji.

925
01:34:00,858 --> 01:34:02,335
Parking garage

926
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:04,553
Luther, stay with her.

927
01:34:28,188 --> 01:34:29,426
She's gone.

928
01:34:29,451 --> 01:34:31,454
I lost her.

929
01:34:33,976 --> 01:34:36,358
She set us up, Ethan.

930
01:34:36,383 --> 01:34:38,247
No, she delivered a message.

931
01:34:38,272 --> 01:34:39,875
She set us up!

932
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:41,153
She knew this would happen.

933
01:34:41,178 --> 01:34:45,038
Only Lane knows
what's going to happen.

934
01:34:50,023 --> 01:34:51,859
I have a job for you, Ethan.

935
01:34:51,884 --> 01:34:54,643
And for the sake of your friend,
you will do it.

936
01:34:54,668 --> 01:34:55,804
I'm listening.

937
01:34:55,829 --> 01:34:58,755
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

938
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:02,391
Is to bring me the unlocked disk
by midnight today.

939
01:35:02,416 --> 01:35:05,040
Now say the words, please.

940
01:35:05,422 --> 01:35:07,424
I accept.

941
01:35:07,818 --> 01:35:09,597
Yes.

942
01:35:12,082 --> 01:35:14,083
I knew you would.

943
01:35:20,729 --> 01:35:25,786
He wants the disk, unlocked,
by midnight tonight

944
01:35:25,811 --> 01:35:31,333
Ethan, there's only one person
on earth who can unlock that disk.

945
01:35:31,594 --> 01:35:34,382
We have to take
the Prime Minister.

946
01:35:34,873 --> 01:35:37,806
Let's just think about
that for a minute.

947
01:35:38,856 --> 01:35:41,128
That's the only way
to get Benji back.

948
01:35:41,153 --> 01:35:44,675
Ethan, that's exactly what
Lane wants you to do.

949
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:48,346
Which is why it has to happen.

950
01:35:52,227 --> 01:35:54,737
This is how we beat Lane.

951
01:35:55,001 --> 01:35:57,286
This is how we make
everything right.

952
01:35:57,311 --> 01:36:01,583
Can you see? Can you see it?

953
01:36:14,884 --> 01:36:19,298
William Brandt, sir.
He says it's urgent.

954
01:36:23,299 --> 01:36:25,378
I had a feeling you'd come
to your senses, Brandt.

955
01:36:25,409 --> 01:36:27,913
I'm only calling you because
I've no other choice.

956
01:36:27,938 --> 01:36:29,798
I'm trying to prevent
a catastrophe.

957
01:36:29,823 --> 01:36:32,760
I can understand that.
Where are you?

958
01:36:33,886 --> 01:36:37,376
- London.
- Reroute us to London, now.

959
01:36:37,401 --> 01:36:40,144
- Where in London?
- I'll tell you when you land, not before.

960
01:36:40,169 --> 01:36:42,134
I'm not interested
in playing games, Brandt.

961
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:45,267
And I'm not interested in seeing
my friends get killed either.

962
01:36:45,292 --> 01:36:47,815
So if I'm going to betray them,
we're going to do this in my terms

963
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,786
and my terms only.
Do you understand?

964
01:36:49,811 --> 01:36:52,782
Keep your phone on,
instruction will follow.

965
01:36:58,309 --> 01:37:02,053
- Should have been gone by now.
- Yeah.

966
01:37:04,443 --> 01:37:07,113
- You okay?
- Yeah.

967
01:37:09,172 --> 01:37:13,484
We're suppose to take down the
Prime Minister of Great Britain tonight.

968
01:37:13,838 --> 01:37:15,662
So...

969
01:37:16,745 --> 01:37:18,454
Brandt.

970
01:37:21,210 --> 01:37:24,238
I cant' see another way.

971
01:37:26,137 --> 01:37:28,288
Neither can I.

972
01:37:30,248 --> 01:37:33,566
What we do, we have to do
for our friends, right?

973
01:38:18,114 --> 01:38:20,389
Get him ready, please.

974
01:38:44,985 --> 01:38:47,026
You're right to call me, Brandt.
Where is Hunt?

975
01:38:47,051 --> 01:38:49,002
He's on his way.
We don't have much time.

976
01:38:49,027 --> 01:38:51,776
- What does he intend to do?
- What matter is he's alive.

977
01:38:51,801 --> 01:38:56,126
And I need your reassurance
that it's going to stay that way.

978
01:39:10,989 --> 01:39:14,342
Have you informed the British Government
that Hunt has targeted the Prime Minister?

979
01:39:14,367 --> 01:39:19,559
I will help you capture him... alive.
That is the deal.

980
01:39:25,138 --> 01:39:27,763
You picked up some terrible habits
from your friend, Brandt.

981
01:39:27,788 --> 01:39:32,121
The worst of them being that you still
believe you can control any outcome.

982
01:39:32,146 --> 01:39:34,091
Stay with him.

983
01:39:37,666 --> 01:39:39,971
Chief Atlee. Chief Atlee.

984
01:39:39,996 --> 01:39:42,356
Director Hunley, how
delightful to see you here.

985
01:39:42,381 --> 01:39:46,322
Last time we spoke, you were
hunting rogue agents in Morocco.

986
01:39:46,347 --> 01:39:50,960
Chief Atlee, I have reason to believe that
the Prime Minister's life is in danger.

987
01:39:53,439 --> 01:39:55,534
I'm listening.

988
01:39:58,032 --> 01:40:01,900
Any advance on 22,000? Anyone?

989
01:40:01,925 --> 01:40:04,634
Going once. Going twice.

990
01:40:04,659 --> 01:40:07,530
Sold!
To our generous Chairwoman.

991
01:40:07,565 --> 01:40:10,509
Sir. Chief Atlee from
MI6 needs to see you.

992
01:40:10,534 --> 01:40:12,825
He says it's urgent.

993
01:40:13,432 --> 01:40:15,395
Excuse me.

994
01:40:25,486 --> 01:40:30,142
- What's this all about?
- It's a matter of national security, Sir.

995
01:40:36,681 --> 01:40:40,230
Under no circumstances
is anyone to enter.

996
01:40:40,242 --> 01:40:41,429
Yes sir.

997
01:40:42,517 --> 01:40:44,852
Help me to understand.

998
01:40:44,877 --> 01:40:47,640
Who is this man?
Why is he after me?

999
01:40:47,665 --> 01:40:52,761
I'm afraid, Prime Minister, Director Hunley
and I share responsibility for this.

1000
01:40:52,786 --> 01:40:55,228
Ethan Hunt was part of a
disgrace intelligence

1001
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:57,225
agency which is since
been dissolved.

1002
01:40:57,250 --> 01:41:02,568
And he's gone rogue, unfortunately intend
on dismantling an imaginary terror network.

1003
01:41:02,593 --> 01:41:04,660
Our new intelligence
suggest that he's been

1004
01:41:04,672 --> 01:41:06,797
manipulated by one of
your own former agent.

1005
01:41:06,822 --> 01:41:09,913
Ilsa Faust, Prime Minister.
She disappeared 2 years ago.

1006
01:41:09,938 --> 01:41:11,608
And if you don't mind I asking,

1007
01:41:11,633 --> 01:41:13,936
what do I have to do with
this phantom network?

1008
01:41:13,961 --> 01:41:16,895
Sir, this is William Brandt,
a former colleague of Hunt's.

1009
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:20,208
He came forward with first hand
knowledge of the plot against you.

1010
01:41:20,234 --> 01:41:24,822
Sir. Hunt is in possession of a virtual
red box that can only be open by you.

1011
01:41:24,847 --> 01:41:28,923
He believes it is the key
to bring down the Syndicate.

1012
01:41:30,043 --> 01:41:35,306
- The Syndicate, you say?
- Yes, Sir. That's what he calls it.

1013
01:41:35,829 --> 01:41:37,555
Atlee.

1014
01:41:37,580 --> 01:41:42,797
He couldn't possibly be talking
about that "Syndicate"?

1015
01:41:44,324 --> 01:41:48,395
'Cause you assured me that,
that "Syndicate" was merely an exercise?

1016
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:51,809
And it was, Prime Minister.
I can assure you.

1017
01:41:51,834 --> 01:41:55,010
And yet, here we have the Central
Intelligence Agency indicating otherwise.

1018
01:41:55,035 --> 01:41:58,664
- I don't understand.
- Prime Minister, your life is in danger.

1019
01:41:58,690 --> 01:42:02,105
- I think our first priority is to move you to a secure location.
- Sir.

1020
01:42:02,130 --> 01:42:06,433
Does the name Solomon Lane,
ring a bell?

1021
01:42:07,259 --> 01:42:13,887
Yes. Unfortunately, it does.

1022
01:42:15,173 --> 01:42:18,138
So, there actually is
a Syndicate?

1023
01:42:18,163 --> 01:42:22,322
It was a hypothetical brainchild
of Chief Atlee.

1024
01:42:22,356 --> 01:42:26,671
Recruit former agents from other nations.
Supply them with a new identity

1025
01:42:26,696 --> 01:42:31,227
and use them to surgically remove
our enemies, both at home and abroad.

1026
01:42:31,252 --> 01:42:34,167
It's operating budget was
to be hidden offshore

1027
01:42:34,179 --> 01:42:37,167
in a virtual red box which
I alone would control.

1028
01:42:37,192 --> 01:42:41,242
It would've made me judge, jury and
executioner with zero accountability.

1029
01:42:41,267 --> 01:42:43,911
I rejected the proposal unequivocally.

1030
01:42:43,936 --> 01:42:48,535
Furthermore, I was given every assurance
it never pass the planning stage.

1031
01:42:48,559 --> 01:42:51,424
Prime Minister,
there is no any Syndicate.

1032
01:42:51,449 --> 01:42:53,947
These people have been
duped by agent Faust.

1033
01:42:53,972 --> 01:42:57,543
Atlee.
Save it for the public inquiry.

1034
01:42:57,570 --> 01:42:59,044
Sir, I urge you not to
leave this room.

1035
01:42:59,069 --> 01:43:00,938
- Excuse me.
- Please.

1036
01:43:00,963 --> 01:43:03,440
Hunt is uniquely trained
and highly motivated.

1037
01:43:03,465 --> 01:43:06,712
A specialist without equal,
immune to any counter measures.

1038
01:43:06,737 --> 01:43:10,903
There is no secret he cannot extract.
No security he cannot breach.

1039
01:43:10,928 --> 01:43:13,466
No person he cannot become.

1040
01:43:13,491 --> 01:43:16,809
He has mostly likely anticipated
this very conversation

1041
01:43:16,834 --> 01:43:20,010
and is waiting to strike in
whatever direction we move.

1042
01:43:20,035 --> 01:43:24,085
Sir. Hunt is the living
manifestation of destiny.

1043
01:43:24,110 --> 01:43:28,148
And he has made you his mission.

1044
01:43:28,425 --> 01:43:30,422
Prime Minister.

1045
01:43:46,221 --> 01:43:47,689
Hunt.

1046
01:43:47,714 --> 01:43:50,907
Sir, please step away
from the Prime Minister.

1047
01:43:53,985 --> 01:43:56,229
Just relax, Sir.
Everything is going to be alright.

1048
01:43:56,254 --> 01:43:59,972
- Atlee shot me.
- Yes, he did, Sir.

1049
01:44:02,670 --> 01:44:08,281
Hunt, I hope you realize you set back US,
UK relations to the American revolution.

1050
01:44:08,306 --> 01:44:12,201
Desperate times,
desperate measures, sir.

1051
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:15,927
- I'm here.
- Standby to receive.

1052
01:44:15,952 --> 01:44:17,581
Ready.

1053
01:44:23,195 --> 01:44:25,786
The Prime Minister's office
ask me to meet him here.

1054
01:44:25,811 --> 01:44:27,368
This way, sir.

1055
01:44:27,393 --> 01:44:29,166
Scanning.

1056
01:44:32,356 --> 01:44:34,806
Retinal scan, confirm.

1057
01:44:37,395 --> 01:44:39,823
Some convenience, Sir.

1058
01:44:40,416 --> 01:44:43,503
You got a very warm hand.

1059
01:44:52,026 --> 01:44:54,465
Biometric, confirm.

1060
01:44:54,490 --> 01:44:58,360
- The prompt is "KIPLING".
- The prompt is "KIPLING".

1061
01:44:58,532 --> 01:45:02,643
Sir, I'm gonna need a pass phrase,
the prompt is "KIPLING".

1062
01:45:02,668 --> 01:45:04,322
Yes, of course.

1063
01:45:04,347 --> 01:45:09,187
" If you can keep your head when all
about you. Are losing theirs..."

1064
01:45:12,950 --> 01:45:17,326
"If you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you."

1065
01:45:21,044 --> 01:45:22,949
- You got it?
- I got it.

1066
01:45:22,974 --> 01:45:24,547
Oh man, do I got it.

1067
01:45:24,572 --> 01:45:28,771
- I'm here to see the Prime Minister.
- We were told not to let anybody in.

1068
01:45:28,796 --> 01:45:32,172
- By whom?
- By you, sir.

1069
01:45:35,289 --> 01:45:39,526
Hunley, what is this? Security!

1070
01:45:45,691 --> 01:45:49,722
Chief Atlee. Kind of you
to accepted our invitation.

1071
01:45:49,751 --> 01:45:51,057
Ah.

1072
01:45:58,668 --> 01:46:01,683
Do you know who I am?

1073
01:46:03,015 --> 01:46:05,115
We know you
created the Syndicate.

1074
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:07,974
But Lane went rogue and
turn it against you, didn't he?

1075
01:46:07,999 --> 01:46:10,464
And you've been desperately
trying to cover it up.

1076
01:46:10,489 --> 01:46:13,335
That's why you erased the disk
which she brought it to you.

1077
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:16,026
That's true.

1078
01:46:17,681 --> 01:46:22,366
Now, Director Hunley has some questions
for you regarding Ilsa Faust.

1079
01:46:22,391 --> 01:46:24,861
Namely, how you frame her.

1080
01:46:24,886 --> 01:46:28,895
That's also true.

1081
01:46:32,134 --> 01:46:33,585
It's the antidote.

1082
01:46:33,610 --> 01:46:36,272
When the Prime Minister found
out about the Syndicate.

1083
01:46:36,297 --> 01:46:39,249
- Atlee had attacked him.
- Yes, that's true.

1084
01:46:39,274 --> 01:46:42,616
And then you saved the
Prime Minister, sir.

1085
01:46:42,628 --> 01:46:43,746
Did he?

1086
01:46:43,886 --> 01:46:46,352
I'm very grateful.

1087
01:46:56,538 --> 01:46:57,992
Sir.

1088
01:47:00,282 --> 01:47:03,875
You're cutting it very close, Ethan

1089
01:47:04,456 --> 01:47:07,903
I have what you want.
Where do I go?

1090
01:47:24,341 --> 01:47:26,347
Ethan, wait.

1091
01:47:26,372 --> 01:47:28,613
If I'm not there in
15 minutes, he'll kill Benji.

1092
01:47:28,638 --> 01:47:30,487
Your mission is to bring
down the Syndicate.

1093
01:47:30,512 --> 01:47:34,785
If Lane gets his hands on that money,
we're unleashing a terrorist superpower.

1094
01:47:34,810 --> 01:47:37,660
He'll never take me alive.
I'll make sure of it.

1095
01:47:37,685 --> 01:47:41,146
What happens, Ethan,
if you can't make it back?

1096
01:47:41,292 --> 01:47:43,572
I'll make it back.

1097
01:47:44,328 --> 01:47:46,243
Just be ready.

1098
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:53,566
Greetings, Prime Minister.
If you are viewing this message,

1099
01:47:53,591 --> 01:47:56,481
it means that you have chosen
to activate the Syndicate.

1100
01:47:56,505 --> 01:48:01,873
This drive gives you access to 2.4 billion
pound sterling in untraceable currency.

1101
01:48:01,898 --> 01:48:06,754
That will allow the Syndicate
to operate undetected for decades.

1102
01:48:06,779 --> 01:48:12,231
Instructions to access
these funds are as follows.

1103
01:49:17,883 --> 01:49:20,829
This is the end, Mr. Hunt.

1104
01:49:29,524 --> 01:49:31,191
Carefully.

1105
01:49:33,905 --> 01:49:39,733
2 pounds Semtex,
500, 30 caliber ball bearings.

1106
01:49:39,758 --> 01:49:43,485
Your friend is sitting on a
highly sensitive - pressure trigger.

1107
01:49:43,510 --> 01:49:46,309
So, no sudden moves.

1108
01:49:53,879 --> 01:49:55,203
Your final test.

1109
01:49:55,228 --> 01:49:59,763
When Lane has what he wants,
I kill you and Benji.

1110
01:49:59,985 --> 01:50:04,317
If not, everyone dies.

1111
01:50:06,522 --> 01:50:10,769
No time to think, Ethan.
Have a seat, please.

1112
01:50:25,107 --> 01:50:28,877
Human nature,
my weapon of choice.

1113
01:50:28,902 --> 01:50:32,581
From the moment I killed the
young lady in the record shop,

1114
01:50:32,606 --> 01:50:36,012
I knew you would stop
at nothing to catch me.

1115
01:50:36,126 --> 01:50:38,806
I also knew Ilsa
wouldn't have a choice.

1116
01:50:38,831 --> 01:50:42,563
Whether she broke you that night
you met or let you go.

1117
01:50:42,588 --> 01:50:47,956
Whether you let her run in Morocco.
Whether she went to Atlee or not.

1118
01:50:47,987 --> 01:50:52,787
You were certain we would
end up where we are... right now.

1119
01:50:55,963 --> 01:50:57,862
Then again.

1120
01:50:58,772 --> 01:51:00,912
So was I.

1121
01:51:01,336 --> 01:51:02,562
I know you, Lane.

1122
01:51:02,587 --> 01:51:05,596
Somewhere along the line
you had a crisis of faith.

1123
01:51:05,621 --> 01:51:09,498
Human life didn't matter anymore,
or maybe it never really did.

1124
01:51:09,523 --> 01:51:12,653
Either way, you killed
too many innocent people

1125
01:51:12,665 --> 01:51:15,676
without ever asking who
is giving the orders.

1126
01:51:15,701 --> 01:51:17,075
Or why.

1127
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:19,290
You blame the system
for what you are.

1128
01:51:19,315 --> 01:51:21,667
Instead of yourself.

1129
01:51:21,692 --> 01:51:23,696
You wanted revenge.

1130
01:51:23,721 --> 01:51:25,682
But Rome wasn't
destroyed in a day.

1131
01:51:25,707 --> 01:51:29,546
You needed help, you
needed the money. A lot of it.

1132
01:51:29,578 --> 01:51:32,794
And you'll stop at
nothing to get it.

1133
01:51:32,819 --> 01:51:36,762
That's how I know I'm going
to put you in a box.

1134
01:51:37,945 --> 01:51:42,298
- Where is the disk?
- Where is the disk?

1135
01:51:42,323 --> 01:51:46,202
You like to play games.
I've a game for you.

1136
01:51:46,334 --> 01:51:51,001
I'll give you 50 million dollars

1137
01:51:51,621 --> 01:51:54,256
to let Benji go.

1138
01:52:09,773 --> 01:52:14,754
- Where is the disk?
- Where is the disk?

1139
01:52:14,779 --> 01:52:17,600
You're looking at it.
I am the disk.

1140
01:52:17,625 --> 01:52:21,250
I memorized it all 2.4 billion
in number accounts.

1141
01:52:21,275 --> 01:52:24,859
If that vest goes off, you get nothing.
Without this money, you are nothing.

1142
01:52:24,884 --> 01:52:28,668
Without me, you are nothing.

1143
01:52:32,825 --> 01:52:36,710
Right now, you're thinking it's bluff.
I'd never let my friends die.

1144
01:52:36,735 --> 01:52:40,017
I couldn't possibly
memorize the entire disk.

1145
01:52:40,042 --> 01:52:42,625
There's only one way to be sure.

1146
01:52:43,462 --> 01:52:45,610
Let Benji go.

1147
01:53:02,806 --> 01:53:04,718
Take him.

1148
01:53:07,915 --> 01:53:10,895
They come 1 step closer,
shoot me.

1149
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:13,865
Stop.

1150
01:53:16,722 --> 01:53:19,679
You remember I told you, one day
you were going to take things too far?

1151
01:53:19,704 --> 01:53:21,534
This is me speaking, by the way.
It's not him.

1152
01:53:21,559 --> 01:53:26,501
The only way this ends is
you and me, Lane, face to face.

1153
01:53:26,526 --> 01:53:29,536
Only this time I won't
be locked in a glass box.

1154
01:53:29,561 --> 01:53:30,879
You want your money.

1155
01:53:30,904 --> 01:53:34,321
The bone doctor gonna
beat it out of me.

1156
01:53:34,346 --> 01:53:37,885
Now let Benji go

1157
01:53:41,921 --> 01:53:44,970
1... 3... 9

1158
01:54:05,122 --> 01:54:06,425
Go.

1159
01:54:06,450 --> 01:54:09,489
- Ethan.
- Brandt has you waiting, go.

1160
01:54:17,430 --> 01:54:20,591
- What do I do?
- Kill the woman.

1161
01:54:21,686 --> 01:54:23,968
I need Hunt alive.

1162
01:55:11,108 --> 01:55:12,944
- Go!
- It's Benji, where am I going?

1163
01:55:12,969 --> 01:55:14,690
- They're coming.
- We're not ready.

1164
01:55:14,715 --> 01:55:16,695
Then get ready.

1165
01:55:42,463 --> 01:55:44,109
Which way?

1166
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:08,567
Face to face.
Just as you wish, Ethan.

1167
02:00:30,807 --> 02:00:33,101
It hurts, I know.

1168
02:00:34,581 --> 02:00:38,112
Gentlemen, this is Solomon Lane.

1169
02:00:38,532 --> 02:00:40,635
Mr. Lane.

1170
02:00:41,530 --> 02:00:44,392
Meet the IMF.

1171
02:02:03,042 --> 02:02:05,142
You're free now.

1172
02:02:07,388 --> 02:02:09,502
Where will you go?

1173
02:02:10,333 --> 02:02:12,364
I don't know.

1174
02:02:14,325 --> 02:02:16,661
I've done my part.

1175
02:02:16,686 --> 02:02:18,338
Yeah.

1176
02:02:23,413 --> 02:02:25,683
Ethan, we got to go.

1177
02:02:34,566 --> 02:02:36,909
You better hurry now.

1178
02:02:38,504 --> 02:02:40,531
Good luck.

1179
02:02:54,867 --> 02:02:57,365
You know how to find me.

1180
02:03:14,422 --> 02:03:16,331
Director Hunley.

1181
02:03:17,901 --> 02:03:20,988
- Director Hunley.
- Ah... Mr. Chairman.

1182
02:03:21,013 --> 02:03:25,913
6 months ago, you stood before this panel
and demanded that the IMF be dissolved.

1183
02:03:25,938 --> 02:03:27,579
That is correct, sir.

1184
02:03:27,604 --> 02:03:29,625
And how do you explain
your testimony today?

1185
02:03:29,650 --> 02:03:31,884
It's quite simple really.
We had reason to believe

1186
02:03:31,909 --> 02:03:35,441
that the Syndicate have infiltrated
our government at the highest level.

1187
02:03:35,466 --> 02:03:40,899
In order for our Mn to infiltrate that
organization, his cover had to be absolute.

1188
02:03:40,924 --> 02:03:45,338
The whole operation was known only
to myself and a handful of IMF agents.

1189
02:03:45,363 --> 02:03:50,509
So, the shuttering of the IMF was
all part of an elaborate scheme.

1190
02:03:50,534 --> 02:03:53,888
- To expose this so call Syndicate?
- That is correct, sir.

1191
02:03:53,913 --> 02:03:59,390
Which is why you're here today,
asking for the IMF to be reinstated.

1192
02:03:59,415 --> 02:04:01,701
That is correct, sir.

1193
02:04:03,584 --> 02:04:07,157
I'm not sure the Committee approves
of your methods, Director Hunley.

1194
02:04:07,182 --> 02:04:11,754
Desperate times,
desperate measures, Mr. Chairman.

1195
02:04:12,393 --> 02:04:14,231
And you, Mr. Brandt.

1196
02:04:14,256 --> 02:04:17,709
How can you justify
this deception?

1197
02:04:18,572 --> 02:04:21,971
I can neither confirm nor deny
details of any operation

1198
02:04:21,996 --> 02:04:24,676
without the Secretary's approval.

1199
02:04:32,075 --> 02:04:34,259
Welcome to the IMF.

1200
02:04:34,527 --> 02:04:36,849
Mr. Secretary

1201
02:04:36,873 --> 02:04:54,873
<font color="#ffff80">♪ <i><b>Hope it helped -> bozxphd</b></i> ♪</font>
