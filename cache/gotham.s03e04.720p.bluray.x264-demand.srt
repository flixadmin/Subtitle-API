synchronizes with your heartbeat.

Stand up on the back of the chair.

00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,432
So you could get him to do
anything you wanted?

6
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:13,714
I want you to find my sister.

My... My brother will find out I'm here,
and he'll come for me.

Nothing will stop him.

This is the brother that
took you to Strange to try and fix you?

ALICE: What? NO.

23
00:00:55,597 --> 00:01:00,148
Jervis kept me a prisoner most of my life,
and when I finally managed to escape,

24
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,275
I ran as far away from him as I could.

25
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,822
Mmm-hmm. And landed in Gotham.

26
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,779
It seemed like a good place to hide.

27
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:10,036
Until Strange found me
and locked me in Indian Hill.

28
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:13,540
I'll admit, not the best luck for you
or your future landlord.

29
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,458
That was an accident...

30
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,878
The infecting part
or the lighting him on fire part?

31
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,671
I'm not a monster!

32
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:25,511
But if you want to see one,
just wait until my brother comes for me.

33

You don 't know what he's capable of.

34

This isn't over.

35
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,181
For either of us.

36

It's perfect! (CHUCKLES)

Oh, my sister used to love
amusement parks.

38
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,320
The rides, the food,
the tents with amazing acts.

39
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,325
That's why I became a performer.

40
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,706

Yes.

I am a family man.

The day I lost her
was the saddest of my life.

The only thing that got me through,
that kept me sane,

45
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,259
was the hope of
one day being together again.

46
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:16,933
Reunited.

47
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:22,735
And if all goes well, that day is today.

48
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:34,113
Of course, a reunion like this
needs to be a private affair.

Yeah, absolutely. Bloody yes.

on his training.

- No.

335

No hospitals.

- Nothing, they're nothing.

You're not Bruce.

- You're not Bruce.

- Just... Just listen...
- What the hell are you?

I won't hurt you. Just let me...

341

Just let me explain.

342

campaign officials to buy the election?

My dear Ed, this is Gotham.
This is how things are done.

345
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,409
And in theory, I support that.

But, Oswald, do you see
how these people are cheering for you?

347
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:47,051
- Yes, they do seem very excited.
- You can win this on your own.

348
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,547
Why risk it? There is no upside.

349

I want this, Ed. I want this
like I've never wanted anything.

Hello, there.

People look at me differently now.

358

For the first time in my life,
I feel wanted.

359
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,335
Nice doing business with you.

360
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,965
And how do you feel now?

361
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,264
I feel like I've misjudged someone
who was supposed to be my friend.

362
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,758
I am your friend.

363

I can't be bought,
but I can be stolen with a glance.

364

I'm worthless to one,
but priceless to two.

365
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,597
- What am I?
- I don't care.

366
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,100
I do not need a stupid riddle right now.

367
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,527
I know what I want.

368
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,608
I want to be mayor.

Stay out of it, Ed. I'm warning you.

Most of the time,
once the trance is broken, that's it.

378
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,850
You should've been fine
the moment you stepped off the ledge.

379
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,480
Then why is it still happening?

380
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,943
Jervis has tapped into something
you're struggling with.

381
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,735
Something a part of you
would do anything not to face.

382
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,453
Then give me something to fight this
until I find him.

383
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,869
There's usually a trigger
that brings on the hypnotic state.

384
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,833
What's the last thing you remember?

385
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,498
He pulled out his watch.

386
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,335
- Asked if I could hear it ticking.
- That's it, then.

387
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,045
His watch.

388
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,344
Anything resembling the ticking
will trigger the impulse.

389
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,515
He's made you a prisoner in your own skin.

390
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,511
He did it to you.

391
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,846
When we were kids.

392
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,897
At first, he did it to control me.

393
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,862
Keep me with him.

394
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,742
But then he started
putting other thoughts in my head.

395
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,368
Thoughts, um...

396
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,198
Thoughts a brother should never have.

397
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:26,206
That's why I wanted to kill him.

398
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,672
I won't go back to him.

399

I went to his house thinking he might
have some answers about who I am.

He didn't.

I didn't look at him like anything.

what happened during the attack.

from the interrogation room with Alice.

You need to uncuff me.

I can't do that.

if something happened to you.

Yes, I moved on, Jim.

What choice did I have?

477
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:51,217
I went through
the most painful period of my life alone.

478
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,510
I cried myself to sleep every night.

479
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,726
And like an idiot,
I would wake up thinking,

480
00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:00,314
hoping, that the next day,
you would show up at my door.

481
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,398
But you never did.

when I needed someone.

He was there
as I tried to put myself back together.

484
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,498
But I'm the one who doesn't care?
