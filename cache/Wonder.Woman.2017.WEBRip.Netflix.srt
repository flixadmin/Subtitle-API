1
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,674
[Diana] I used to want to save the world.

2
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,470
This beautiful place.

3
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,348
But I knew so little then.

4
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,020
It is a land of magic and wonder.

5
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,565
Worth cherishing in every way.

6
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,694
But the closer you get,

7
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:14,532
the more you see the great darkness
simmering within.

8
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,498
And mankind? [chuckles]

9
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,168
Mankind is another story altogether.

10
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:32,425
What one does when faced with the truth
is more difficult than you think.

11
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,437
I learned this the hard way.

12
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,565
A long, long time ago.

13
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,444
And now,

14
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,949
I will never be the same.

15
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,624
Merci.

16
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,172

17
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,839
Hello, Diana.

18
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,757
-[Amazon] Hello, Diana.
-Hello.

19
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,718
-[Mnemosyne] Diana!

20

[grunting]

24
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,055
-It looks very good.
-Very good.

25
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,223
How is she doing?

26
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,390
She's good.

27
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,892
-Keep working with her.
-I will.

28
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,102
Naomi.

[young Diana grunting]

32
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,459
[Mnemosyne] Diana!

33
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,587
Diana, I see you.

34
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,971
Where are you going?
Slow down!

35
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:27,934
[grunts]

36
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,108
[chuckles] Hello, Mother.

37
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,110
How are you today?

38
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,030
[Hippolyta] Let's get you back to school
before another tutor quits.

39
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:44,701
[young Diana] But don't you think
it's time to start my training?

40
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,287
Antiope thinks I'm ready.

41
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,289
[Hippolyta] Does she?

42
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,625
I could begin showing her some things.

43
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,462
She should at least
be able to defend herself.

44
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,839
From whom?

45
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,966
In the event of an invasion.

46
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,469
[Hippolyta] Isn't that why I have
the greatest warrior in our history

47
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,972
leading an entire army, General?

48
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,934
I pray a day will never come
where she has to fight.

49
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:13,313
But you know,
a scorpion must sting,

50
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,898
-a wolf must hunt--
-She is a child.

51
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,192
The only child on the island.
Please let her be so.

52
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,360
[young Diana] But, Mother...

53
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,070
There will be no training.

54
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,246
[young Diana]
What if I promised to be careful?

55
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,166
It's time to sleep.

56
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,253
What if I didn't use a sword?

57
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,089
Fighting does not make you a hero.

58
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,009
Just a shield then. No sharp edges.

59
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:47,346
[sighs] Diana, you are the most
precious thing in the world to me.

60
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:52,226
I wished for you so much so,
I sculpted you from clay myself

61
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,937
and begged Zeus to give you life.

62
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,898
You've told me this story.

63
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,902
Which is why tonight
I will tell you a new one.

64
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,697
A story of our people,
and my days of battle.

65
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,865
Yes!

66
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,535
So you will finally understand
why war is nothing to hope for.

67
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,586
Long ago, when time was new

68
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:22,215
and all of history was still a dream,

69
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,717
the Gods ruled the Earth,

70
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,345
Zeus king among them.

71
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:33,267
Zeus created beings
over which the Gods would rule.

72
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,312
Beings born in his image,

73
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,149
fair and good,
strong and passionate.

74
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,987
He called his creation "man."
And mankind was good.

75
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:49,158
But Zeus's son
grew envious of mankind

76
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,578
and sought to corrupt
his father's creation.

77
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,083
This was Ares, the God of War.

78
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:03,464
Ares poisoned men's hearts
with jealousy and suspicion.

79
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,758
He turned them against one another

80
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,928
and war ravaged the Earth.

81
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:13,975
So, the Gods created us, the Amazons,

82
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,769
to influence men's hearts with love

83
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,439
and restore peace to the Earth.

84
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:25,445
And for a brief time, there was peace.

85
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,994
[Antiope] But it did not last.

86
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:43,337
Your mother, the Amazon Queen,
led a revolt

87
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,466
that freed us all from enslavement.

88
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,726
When Zeus led the Gods to our defense,

89
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,146
Ares killed them one by one,

90
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,483
until only Zeus himself remained.

91
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:09,197
[Hippolyta] Zeus used the last
of his power to stop Ares,

92
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:14,827
striking such a blow,
the God of War was forced to retreat.

93
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,038
But Zeus knew

94
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,501
that one day, Ares might return
to finish his mission.

95
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,337
An endless war,

96
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,548
where mankind would finally
destroy themselves,

97
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,510
and us with them.

98
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,262
[Antiope] So Zeus left us a weapon,

99
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,516
one powerful enough to kill a God.

100
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:41,687
[Hippolyta] With his dying breath,
Zeus created this island

101
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,106
to hide us from the outside world,

102
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,609
somewhere Ares could not find us.

103
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,366
And all has been quiet ever since.

104
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:05,253
We give thanks to the Gods
for giving us this paradise.

105
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,548
And the Godkiller?

106
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,303
The Godkiller?

107
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,223
The weapon that's strong enough
to kill a god.

108
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,559
Can I see it?

109
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,445
The Gods gave us many gifts.

110
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,864
One day, you'll know them all.

111
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,118
This great tower is where we keep them.

112
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,923
The Godkiller.

113
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,220
It's beautiful.

114
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:58,973
Who would wield it?

115
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,228
I pray it will never be called to arms.

116
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,940
But only the fiercest among us
even could.

117
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,318
And that is not you, Diana.

118
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,529
You see, you're safe,

119
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,824
and there is nothing
you should concern yourself with.

120
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,915
[metal clanging]

[both grunting]

122
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,214
You keep doubting yourself, Diana.

123
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,383
-No, I don't.
-Yes, you do.

124
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,427
No, I don't.

125
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,391
You are stronger than you believe.

126
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,810
You have greater powers than you know.

127
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,896
-But if you don't try hard--
-[Hippolyta] Diana!

128
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,492
Are you hurt?

129
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,285
No, Mother, I'm fine,

130
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,079
-I was just--
-Training.

131
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:07,124
It seems I'm not
the revered queen I should be.

132
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,543
Disobeyed, betrayed by my own sister...

133
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,046
No, Mother.
It was me, I asked her to--

134
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,422
Take her to the palace.

135
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,258
Off you go.

136
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,977
You left me no choice, Hippolyta.

137
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,399
You neglect your duty
if she cannot fight.

138
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,651
You speak of a time that may never come.

139
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,737
He might never return.

140
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,448
He could have died from his wounds.

141
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,576
Ares is alive.

142
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,996
You feel it, as I do, in your bones.

143
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:49,291
It is only a matter of time
before he returns.

144
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:57,174
The stronger she gets,
the sooner he'll find her.

145
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,094
Hippolyta, I love her as you do.

146
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,557
But this is the only way
to truly protect her.

147

[sighs]

148
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:19,029
You will train her harder than
any Amazon before her.

149
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,574
Five times harder,

150
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,784
ten times harder.

151
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,871
Until she is better than even you.

152
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,415
But she must never know the truth

153
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,333
about what she is

154
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,335
or how she came to be.

You expect the battle to be fair.

00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,896
You are bleeding.

168
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,859
[Diana] I'm sorry...
[Antiope] Wait, Diana, wait.

169
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,366
What have I done?

170
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,286
I'm sorry.

[man shouting indistinctly]

177
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,897
[man] Where did this fog come from?

178
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,320
There. Go forward!

[soldiers shouting in German]

180
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,548
[German soldier]
There he is! The pilot! I can see him.

00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,924
-He's there!

184
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,790
Wow.

185
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,211
You're a man.

186
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,005
[chuckles softly]

187
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,468
Yeah. I mean...

188
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,097
Do I not look like one?

189
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,852
Where are we?

190
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,938
Themyscira.

191
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,314
Therma-what?

192
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:28,899
Who are you?

193
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,902
[soldiers shouting in German]

194
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,910
I'm one of the good guys,
and those are the bad guys.

195
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,120
What?

196
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,996
The Germans. Come on,
we need to get out of here.

197
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,290
-The Germans?
-[Hippolyta] Diana!

198
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,668
Step away from her, now!

199
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,171
[Amazon] Ready your bows!

200
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,009
They have guns, right?

201
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,761
Fire!

202
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,472
Fire!

203
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,016
Come on!

No!

218
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,344
No!

219
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,643
[Diana] No.

220
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,814
-No, no. Antiope. Antiope.
-[groaning]

Antiope, hey. Hey, hey.

00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,445
Hey.

223
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:02,988
-Diana.
-Be still.

224
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,241
The time has come.

225
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,536
You... You must...

226
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,873
What? What, Antiope?

227
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,337
Godkiller.

228
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,922
-Diana, go...
-Go where?

229
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,133
-Go where?
-Go...

230
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,178
No, please, no. No. No!

231
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:28,305
No, no, no.

232
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,932
-No! [sobbing]
-Antiope!

233
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,685
No!

234
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,194
-You.
-[Diana] No.

235
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,155
No, Mother, no.

236
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,032
He fought at my side
against the invaders.

237
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,034
What man fights against his own people?

238
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,037
-These aren't my people.
-Then why do you wear their colors?

239
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,207
I can't tell you that.

240
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:56,374
You need to tell us now!

241
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,626
What is your name?

242
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,378
I can't tell you that either.

243
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,007
We should kill him now,
and be done with it.

244
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,175
If he dies,

245
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:10,514
we know nothing about who they are,
and why they came.

246
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,856
My, uh, [clears throat]

247
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:25,779
name is Captain Steve Trevor,
pilot, American Expeditionary Forces.

248
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:29,074
Serial number 8141921.

249
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,493
That's all I'm at liberty to... [groans]

250
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,624
Assigned to British Intelligence.

251
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,086
What the hell is this thing?

252
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,256
The Lasso of Hestia compels you
to reveal the truth.

253
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,299
But it's really hot.

254
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,469
It is pointless, and painful, to resist.

255
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,429
What is your mission?

256
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:55,392
Whoever you are,
you are in more danger than you think.

257
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,601
What is your mission?

258
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:00,939
I am a...

259
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,443
[clears throat]

260
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,653
I am a...

261
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,238
[straining]

262
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,324
I am a spy.

263
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,451
[panting]

264
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,122
I'm a spy. I'm a spy.

265
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,168
British Intelligence got word

266
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,795
that the leader of the German Army,
General Ludendorff,

267
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,841
would be visiting a secret military
installation in the Ottoman Empire.

268
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:31,178
I posed as one of their pilots,
and flew in with them.

269
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,848
According to our intel,
the Germans had no troops left,

270
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,642
no money, no munitions of any kind.

271
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,144
But our intel was wrong.

272
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,063
The Germans had the Turks
building bombs for them.

273
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,358
And not just bombs, new weapons.

274
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,110
Secret weapons.

275
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:53,325
Invented by Ludendorff's
chief psychopath, Dr. Isabel Maru.

276
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,204
The boys in the trenches
called her "Dr. Poison."

277
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,831
And for good reason.

278
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,133
[man gasping]

279
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,677
[groaning]

280
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,313
[grunts]

281
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:32,197
[Steve] From what I could tell,
if Dr. Maru was able to complete her work,

282
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,408
millions more would die.
The war would never end.

283
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,161
I was there to observe and report,
nothing more,

284
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,706
but I had to do something.

285
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,088
[Dr. Maru] I'm so close.

286
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:51,299
I know I can make the gas
penetrate the mask.

287
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,677
I just... I need more time.

288
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,595
Unfortunately, Doctor,
we do not have more time.

289
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,681
This work, this...

290
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,271
Get that man!

291
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,647
There!

292
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:06,856
[alarm blaring]

293
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,903
[men shouting indistinctly]

294
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,156
[grunts]

295
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,386
[gunfire]

296
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:03,079
But if I can get these notes back
to British Intelligence in time,

297
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,416
it could stop millions more from dying.

298
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,294
It could stop the war.

299
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,629
War? What war?

300
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,258
The war.

301
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,638
The war to end all wars.

302
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,725
Four years,

303
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,144
27 countries,

304
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,271
25 million dead,

305
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,815
soldiers and civilians.

306
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,859
Innocent people,

307
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,112
women and children slaughtered.

308
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,950
Their homes and their villages
looted and burned.

309
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,290
[groans] Weapons far deadlier than you can

310
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,209
[exhales]

311
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,711
ever imagine.

312
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,801
It's like nothing
I've ever seen.

313
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,970
It's like the world's going to end.

314
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,474
Should we let him go?

315
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,227
And risk him bringing
more men to our shores?

316
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,479
We cannot hold him forever, my queen.

317
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,731
Mother. Excuse me,

318
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:15,735
but after everything the man said,
this must be Ares.

319
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,153
What are you talking about, child?

320
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,323
Forgive me, Senator,
but the man called it "a war without end."

321
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,410
Millions of people already dead.

322
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,829
Like nothing he's ever seen.

323
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,415
Only Ares could do such a thing.

324
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,503
We cannot simply let him go.
We must go with him.

325
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,339
I will not deploy our army
and leave Themyscira defenseless

326
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,549
to go and fight their war.

327
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,592
It is not their war.

328
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,929
Zeus created man to be
just and wise, strong and passionate--

329
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,515
That was a story, Diana!

330
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,016
There is much you do not understand.

331
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,226
Men are easily corrupted.

332
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,187
Yes, but Ares is behind that corruption!

333
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:54,232
It is Ares who has
these Germans fighting.

334
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,403
And stopping the God of War
is our foreordinance.

335
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,030
As Amazons, this is our duty.

336
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:04,033
But you are not an Amazon
like the rest of us.

337
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,536
So you will do nothing.

338
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,204
As your queen, I forbid it.

339
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,594
[Epione] Strange.

340
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,431
Is it true you saved his life?

341
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:27,932
Who told you that?

342
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,100
He did.

343
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,455
[Steve grunts]

344
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,458
Whoa! I...

345
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,670
I didn't see you come in.

346
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,804
Would you say you're a

347
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,265
typical example of your sex?

348
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,559
I am

349
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,481
above average.

350
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,194
What's that?

351
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,614
It's a...

352
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,659
Oh! Um...

353
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,788
It's a watch. [clears throat]

354
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,164
A watch?

355
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,374
Yeah, it's a watch.

356
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,959
It tells time.

357
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,962
My father gave it to me.

358
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,173
It's been through hell and back
with him.

359
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,594
Now it's with me,
and good thing it's still ticking.

360
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,638
What for?

361
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,141
Because it tells time.

362
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,062
-When to eat, sleep, wake up, work.
-[Diana chuckles]

363
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,608
You let this little thing
tell you what to do?

364
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,235
Yeah.

365
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,201
Can I ask you some questions?

366
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,079
-Where are we?
-Themyscira.

367
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:16,749
No, I got that before.
But I mean, where are we?

368
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,335
What is this place?
Who are you people?

369
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,588
Why does the water do that?

370
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:24,257
How come you don't know what a watch is?
How come you speak English so well?

371
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,551
We speak hundreds of languages.

372
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,805
We are the bridge to
a greater understanding between all men.

373
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,058
Right.

374
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,732
You know, I didn't get a chance
to say this, uh, earlier,

375
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:46,446
but thank you for dragging me
out of the water.

376
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,282
Thank you

377
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,951
for what you did on the beach.

378
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,085
So,

379
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,838
you're here to let me go?

380
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,760
I tried, but it's not up to me.

381
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,095
I even asked them to send me with you.

382
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,058
Or anyone.

383
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,267
An Amazon.

384
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,102
The Amazons.

385
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,729
The Amazons?

386
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,607
It is our sacred duty
to defend the world.

387
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,109
And I wish to go.

388
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,031
But my mother will not allow it.

389
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,451
Well, [sighs]

390
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,955
-I can't say I blame her.
-[zipping]

391
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,164
The way this war is going,

392
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:41,250
I wouldn't want to
let anyone I care about near it.

393
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,294
Then why do you want to go back?

394
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,922
I don't think "want" is the word.

395
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,301
I guess I gotta try.

396
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,263
My father told me once,

397
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,766
he said, "If you see something wrong
happening in the world,

398
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,644
you can either do nothing,
or you can do something."

399
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,481
And I already tried "nothing."

400
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:16,995

Nice outfit.

Oh, thank you.

410
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:49,605
Now, I will show you
the way off the island

411
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,732
and you will take me to Ares.

412
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,568
Deal.

413
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,120
[Steve] I'm leaving in that?

414
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,538
[Diana] We are.

415
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,958
Yeah, we're leaving in that?

416
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,585
Do you not know how to sail?

417
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:11,836
Of course I know how to sail.

418
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,671
Why wouldn't I know how to sail?
It's just...

419
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,090
It's been a while.

[hooves thundering]

00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,038
I'm going, Mother.

422
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,875
I cannot stand by
while innocent lives are lost.

423
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:56,172
If no one else will defend the world
from Ares, then I must.

424
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,300
I have to go.

425
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,843
I know.

426
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,347
Or at least I know I cannot stop you.

427
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,812
There is so much...

428
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,065
So much you do not understand.

429
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,691
I understand enough.

430
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:19,403
That I'm willing to fight for those
who cannot fight for themselves.

431
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,616
Like you once did.

432
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,202
You know that if you choose to leave,

433
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,288
you may never return.

434
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,125
Who will I be if I stay?

435
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,971
This belonged to
the greatest warrior in our history,

436
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,140
our beloved Antiope.

437
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,434
Make sure you are worthy of it.

438
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,271
I will.

439
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,859
Be careful in the world of men, Diana.

440
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,780
They do not deserve you.

441
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,288
You have been my greatest love.

442
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,626
Today,

443
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,630
you are my greatest sorrow.

444
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:59,920
Should you have told her?

445
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:05,259
The more she knows,
the sooner he'll find her.

446
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,773
How long until we reach the war?

447
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,109
The war? Which part?

448
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,527
The Western Front in France

449
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,030
is 400 miles long
from the Alps to the North Sea.

450
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,658
Where the fighting
is the most intense, then.

451
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:32,703
If you take me there,
I'm sure I'll find Ares.

452
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,001
Ares? As in, the God of War?

453
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:43,255
The God of War is our responsibility.
Only an Amazon can defeat him.

454
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,716
With this.

455
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:46,967
[sighs]

456
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,386
And once I do,

457
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,554
the war will end.

458
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,226
[metal clangs]

459
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,560
[Steve clears throat]

460
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,772
Look, I appreciate your spirit,

461
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,483
but this war is...

462
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,860
It's a great big mess.

463
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,531
And there's not a whole lot
you and I can do about that.

464
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:11,283
I mean, we can get back to London,
and try to get to the men who can.

465
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,536
I'm the man who can!

466
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,496
And once I find and destroy Ares,

467
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,290
the German armies
will be freed from his influence

468
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:21,460
and they will be good men again,
and the world will be better.

469
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:26,924
Great.

470
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:28,968
You'll see.

471
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,472
What are you doing?

472
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,975
Oh, I thought maybe you'd want to

473
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,519
get some sleep.

474
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,650
And what about you?
Are you not sleeping?

475
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,444
Does the average man not sleep?

476
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,779
[stammering]

477
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,742
Yes, we sleep.
We just don't sleep with, uh...

478
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:54,910
You don't sleep with women?

479
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,997
No. I mean, I do sleep with...
I sleep with... [chuckles]

480
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,749
Yes, I do.

481
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,377
But, out of the, uh, [clears throat]

482
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,963
confines of marriage

483
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,548
it's just...

484
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,011
It's not polite to assume, you know?

485
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,224
"Marriage"?

486
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,310
Marriage. Do you not have that on...

487
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,937
You go before a judge

488
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:26,275
and you swear to love,
honor and cherish each other

489
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,568
until death do you part.

490
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,696
And do they?
Love each other till death?

491
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,615
Not very often, no.

492
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,200
Then why do they do it?

493
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,453
-I have no idea.
-[chuckles]

494
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,955
So, you cannot sleep with me
unless I marry you.

495
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,333
I will sleep with you, if you want.
I'll sleep right there.

496
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,584
There's plenty of room.

497
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,295
-Then, fine, if you don't mind...
-No, it's up to you.

498
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,881
I know it's up to me, I'm making
the choice. I will come sleep with you.

499
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,049
[chuckles] Okay.

500
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,094
[Steve] Yeah, just...

501
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,597
Okay.

502
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,182
[exhales]

503
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:16,242
You know, where I come from,
I'm not considered average.

504
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,203
You know, being a spy,

505
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,665
you have to show a certain amount of

506
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,918
vigor.

507
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:32,424
Have you never met a man before?
What about your father?

508
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,343
I had no father.

509
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,637
My mother sculpted me from clay

510
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,931
and I was brought to life by Zeus.

511
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,769
Well, that's neat.

512
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,774
Sorry.

513
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,778
Where I come from,

514
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,323
babies are made differently.

515
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,159
You refer to reproductive biology.

516
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,911
-Yes, yes.
-Yeah, I know.

517
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,247
I know all about that.

518
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,250
I mean, I refer to that,
and other things.

519
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,419
The pleasures of the flesh.

520
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,257
Do you know about that?

521
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,468
I've read
all 12 volumes of Clio's

522
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,220
Treatises on Bodily Pleasure.

523
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,099
-All 12, huh?
-Mmm-hmm.

524
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,188
Did you bring any of those with you?

525
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:29,982
You would not enjoy them.

526
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,483
I don't know. Maybe.

527
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,776
No, you wouldn't.

528
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,320
Why not?

529
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:37,615
They came to the conclusion that men
are essential for procreation,

530
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,617
but when it comes to pleasure,

531
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,910
[sighs] unnecessary.

532
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,579
No, no.

533
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,209
Good night.

534
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,669
Night.

535
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,174
[indistinct chatter in German]

536
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,808
How long until we are operational?

537
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,185
Two days, sir.

538
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,020
You have until tonight, Captain.

539
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:12,316
Sir, the men have had no food,
no sleep.

540
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,652
Do you think I have had
any food or rest, Captain?

541
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,737
Do you hear me making excuses?

542
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:17,905
No.

543
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,490
Your men are weak, complacent.

544
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,660
You've let them forget that
an attack can happen at any time,

545
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,244
from any quarter!

546
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:25,579
So, let's you and I remind them,

547
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,747
shall we?

548
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,347
-Doctor.
-[Dr. Maru] General.

549
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,515
Progress?

550
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:45,974
Not enough.

551
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,811
It is over, General.

552
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:50,854
Germany is giving up.

553
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:54,942
Von Hindenburg has recommended
the Kaiser sign the armistice.

554
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,152
We have run out of time.

555
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,573
As soon as the Kaiser
sees the newest weapon,

556
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,450
he will not sign the armistice.

557
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:04,701
But, without my book--

558
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,120
We will get your book!

559
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,705
It is you that I believe in. Not it.

560
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:13,168
I know that you can,
and will, succeed. Hmm.

561
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:18,340
It is what you were put on this earth
to do.

562
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:25,389
Something did come to me last night.

563
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,558
A different type of gas.

564
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,560
For you.

565
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,104
To restore your strength.

566
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,734
[grunting]

567
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,009
[sniffs]

568
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:04,553
I've got it. I've got it!

569
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:08,223
And if it's what I think,

570
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:11,226
it's going to be

571
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,271
terrible.

572
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,274
[ship horn blows]

573
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,793
[Steve] Morning!

574
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,838
We got lucky, we caught a ride.
We made some good time.

575
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,341
Welcome to jolly old London!

576
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,134
It's hideous.

577
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:46,053
Yeah, it's not for everybody.

578
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,271
[indistinct chatter]

579
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,486
[horn honking]

580
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:09,993
[officer 1] Morning, darling.
[officer 2] What a beauty.

581
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,161
[officer 3] Hello, beautiful!

582
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,830
Gentlemen, eyes to yourself.
Thank you so much.

583
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,751
Come on! Come on.

584
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:20,879
Why are they holding hands?

585
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,924
Uh, probably because
they're together.

586
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,179
No, no, no. We're not together.
I mean, in that way.

587
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,347
This way.

588
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,765
[sighs] To the war!

589
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,476
Well, technically, the war is that way.
But we gotta go this way first.

590
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,144
And where are we going?

591
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:38,063
We gotta get this notebook
to my superiors.

592
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,314
Hey, hey, hey!

593
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:42,609
No, no, no.
I let you go, you take me to Ares.

594
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,528
We made a deal, Steve Trevor.

595
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,071
And a deal is a promise.

596
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,073
And a promise is unbreakable.

597
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,909
Oh, boy. Damn it. All right.

598
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,996
You come with me first
to deliver this,

599
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:56,456
and then we'll get you a ticket,
uh... [clears throat]

600
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:57,791
to the war.

601
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,084
Deal?

602
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:01,712
-Let's go.
-Diana...

603
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:02,879
What are you doing?

604
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,007
You can't do that because
you're not wearing any clothes.

605
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:08,427
Let's go...
Let's go buy you some clothes.

606
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,387
What do these women wear into battle?

607
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,930
-They don't, uh...
-[baby crying]

608
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,724
[gasps] A baby!

609

-No, no, no. No babies.
-Oh... Oh...

610
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,186
No, please. No babies.

611
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,147
That one's not made out of clay.

612
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,565
Come on.

613
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,734
Diana! Please.

614
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:28,280
[elevator bell dings]

00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:41,460
Thank God! You're not dead! [giggles]

[grunting]

Hoorah and huzzah!

619
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,049
I did think you were dead
until I got your call, you know?

620
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,843
He's been gone for weeks.
Not a single word.

621
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,011
Very unlike him.

622
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,597
I'm introducing myself.
It's Etta Candy.

623
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,766
I'm Steve Trevor's secretary.

624
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:57,267
What is a secretary?

625
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,810
Ooh! Well, I do everything.

626
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:01,063
I go where he tells me to go,
and I do what he tells me to do.

627
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:04,107
Well, where I'm from,
that's called slavery.

628
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,400
[gasps] I really like her.

629
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,777
Fantastic. Ladies, after you.

630
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:08,111
Oh, I do, I like her.

631
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,197
[Etta] And it does rather feel like that,

632
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,907
except the pay is very good.

633
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,409
We've got our work cut out for us,
haven't we?

634
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:20,457
Is this what passes for armor
in your country?

635
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:21,958
[stammers]

636
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,293
"Armor." It's fashion.

637
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,961
Keeps our tummies in.

638
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,755
Why must you keep them in?

639
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,174
Only a woman with no tummy
would ask that question.

640
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:34,429
Conservative,
but not entirely un-fun.

641
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,057
Try it on, at least.

642
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,266
Very well.

643
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:41,144
-Ooh! Ah, ah, ah...
-No! No, no, no.

644
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,646
[Etta] Ooh! [laughs]

[exclaiming]

651
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,997
[Diana] How can a woman
possibly fight in this?

652
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,290
[Etta] Fight?

653
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,000
We use our principles.

654
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,919
I mean, that's how
we're going to get the vote.

655
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:09,840
Although, I am not opposed to
engaging in a bit of fisticuffs,

656
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:11,758
should the occasion arise.

657
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,344
Lovely.

658
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,679
Oop!

659
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,306
It's itchy. It's choking me.

660
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,768
Can't say I blame it. [chuckles]

661
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:23,186
Etta.

662
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,354
Where is she?

663
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,857
Oh, she's trying on
outfit number 226.

664
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,870
Miss Candy, the whole point
was to make her look less

665
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:41,204
distracting.

666
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,541
May I?

667
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,589
[Etta] Really? Specs?

668
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,883
And suddenly she's not the most
beautiful woman you've ever seen?

669
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,724
Better.

670
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:11,651
-[metal clangs]
-[Diana grunts]

671
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,236
Yeah, that's not going to work.

672
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,113
Please put the sword down, Diana.

673
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,281
Diana!

674
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:18,658
Let me try it by myself.

675
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:19,910
After you, sir. [sighs]

676
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,919
[Etta chuckles]

677
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:30,462
Etta...

678
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:33,215
Why don't I meet you
back at the office

679
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,425
and, meanwhile,
I'll take this for safekeeping.

680
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:36,593
Oh, no, I don't think so.

681
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,553
You gotta put the sword down, Diana.
Please.

682
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,930
-It doesn't go with the outfit.
-At all.

683
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:42,766
Put the sword down, first of all.

684
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:43,934
[gasps]

685
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:48,772
Promise me you will protect it
with your life.

686
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:51,066
[chuckles] Yes... No.

687
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,360
You can trust her. Just hand that over.

688
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,362
-Shield.
-And the shield to her.

689
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:56,530
There we go. Whoa!

690
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:57,697
You got it? Thanks, Etta.

691
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,783
This is easy. [chuckles]

692
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,536
Oh. There we go.

693
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,749
[indistinct chattering]

694
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,398
What is it?

695
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,652
Hopefully nothing. Come on.

696
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,372
-Steve, why are we hiding?
-Shh! Come on, come on.

697
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,592
[man] Captain Trevor.

698
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,512
I believe you have something that is
the property of General Ludendorff.

699
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,850
Ah, it's the, uh, bad-guy convention.

700
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,519
-[gun clicks]
-Give us Dr. Maru's notebook.

701
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:11,688
Where did I put that thing?

702
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,150
-[grunts]
-Stand back!

703
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,693
[grunts]

704
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,236
[gasping]

705
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:26,870
-Or maybe not.
-[gun clicks]

706
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,999
[Diana grunts]

707
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,051
[gun clicking]

708
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,054
[sighs] Tough luck. [grunts]

709
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:46,973
[groans]

710
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:52,395
Is there anything else
you want to show me?

711
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:54,940
Where do you think you're going?

712
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:58,944
-[man grunts]
-[gasps] Oh!

713
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:04,407
I'm sorry. But you are
clearly under his control.

714
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:07,243
-Diana...
-Let me help you get free.

715
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,995
Where will I find Ares?

716
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,041
[sighs]

717
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,588
-He's... He's dead.
-[Steve] Hmm.

718
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,632
Cyanide.

719
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:25,095
[indistinct clamoring]

720
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,184
Stay here. I'll be right back.

721
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:34,104
[Sir Patrick]
Gentlemen! Gentlemen, please!

722
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,940
The sad truth is, the majority of them

723
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:38,775
don't even know
what they're fighting for!

724
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:39,943
Let him speak!

725
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,278
Yes, thank you. Gentlemen...

726
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:46,866
Germany is an immensely proud nation.

727
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,953
They will never surrender.

728
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:53,039
Now, look.
The only way to end this war...

729
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:56,543
[whispers] Colonel,
I have to talk to you outside.

730
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,962
[Sir Patrick] ...and restore world peace

731
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,672
is to negotiate

732
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,092
[stammers] an armistice.

733
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:07,095
[man] There's a woman in here.
[Sir Patrick] Um...

734
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:08,722
[whispering] What's she doing in here?
Get her out.

735
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:11,850
Get her out.

736
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,560
Sorry. [chuckles]

737
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,021
Blind sister.
She got lost on the way to the bathroom.

738
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:18,148
I think it's this way.
Sorry, guys.

739
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:21,067
[Sir Patrick] Um...
Our only aim at this time

740
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:23,862
must be to achieve peace,

741
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,905
at any cost!

742
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,991
[all shouting]

743
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,661
Why do they not let him speak?
He's talking peace.

744
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,329
Not right now. Sorry.

745
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:35,623
[indistinct chattering]

746
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,920
Trevor, what the hell were you thinking,
bringing a woman into the Council Chamber?

747
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:43,006
The intel that I brought back
is time-sensitive.

748
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,632
This is one of Dr. Maru's notebooks.

749
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:45,800
Notebook or not--

750
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:46,968
We need to get it to cryptography

751
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,720
and I need an immediate audience
with the generals.

752
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,056
You do not just barge in here
and demand an audience with the Cabinet.

753
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:52,766
Sir, with all due respect,
what I saw in my last mission

754
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:53,975
could change the course of the war.

755
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,560
[Sir Patrick] Captain Trevor!

756
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:58,772
I heard we'd lost you
on one of your missions,

757
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:00,440
yet here you are,
back from the dead,

758
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,525
and I see you've
brought a friend with you.

759
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,069
Our deepest apologies
for the interruption, sir.

760
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,862
No, no, no. Nonsense.

761
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,739
Thanks to this young woman,

762
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:11,409
the room was finally quiet enough for me
to get at least a few words in.

763
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:13,453
Sir Patrick Morgan, at your service.

764
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,081
Diana, Princess of Themys--

765
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:18,083
"Prince." Diana Prince.

766
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:19,959
She is, uh...

767
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,127
And I...

768
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,337
Are...

769
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:23,505
Working together.

770
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,632
She actually helped me
bring this, uh, notebook back here.

771
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,051
That's from Dr. Maru's lab.

772
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,929
I think the information contained inside
will change the course of the war, sir.

773
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,931
My God.

774
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,934
-Dr. Poison, herself.
-[Steve] Yes.

775
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,079
[glass shatters]

776
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,916
[breathing heavily]

777
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,751
[clicking]

778
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,169
[gasps]

779
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,088
[Dr. Maru chuckles]

780
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,090
[Ludendorff] Yes.

781
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,217
[General Haig] Intriguing.

782
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:10,677
-Any further intelligence?
-[door closes]

783
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:13,888
[Colonel Darnell] Sadly not, sir.
Cryptography have had no luck.

784
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:15,974
It seems like it's a mixture
of two languages,

785
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:19,686
but, as yet, they've failed
to determine which two languages.

786
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,438
Ottoman and Sumerian.

787
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,359
Surely, someone else in this room
knew that.

788
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:27,610
Who is this woman?

789
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,487
[Steve] She's my, um,

790
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,197
secretary, sir.

791
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,033
And she can understand
Ottoman and Sumerian?

792
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,077
She's a very good secretary.

793
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,662
-See her out.
-[all laugh]

794
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,957
[Colonel Darnell]
Sir, if this woman can read it,

795
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,959
we should hear what she has to say.

796
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,794
Yes, very well.

797
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,469
[Diana] It's a formula

798
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:54,554
for a new kind of gas.

799
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:58,641
Mustard gas.
Hydrogen-based, instead of sulfur.

800
00:57:58,808 --> 00:57:59,893
[whispers] Hydrogen-based...

801
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:02,687
Gas masks would be useless
against hydrogen.

802
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:05,648
The book says they plan to
release the gas

803
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,192
at "the front"?

804
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:08,359
When?

805
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:09,652
It doesn't say.

806
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,446
Wait. "Front" of what?

807
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:12,614
Sir,

808
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,574
that is the evidence we need.

809
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,201
You have to find out
where they're making that gas.

810
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:17,494
You have to burn it to the ground.

811
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,703
Destroy it.

812
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,414
Ludendorff was last seen in Belgium.

813
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:25,668
We can't be seen sending troops
into German-occupied Belgium

814
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,588
as we are negotiating their surrender.

815
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,507
[Steve] Sir, I've seen that gas
with my own eyes.

816
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,426
If it is used,
it will kill everyone on both sides.

817
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:34,636
They will all die.

818
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:37,722
That is what soldiers do, Captain.

819
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,308
[Steve] Send me in
with some logistical support.

820
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:43,603
At least give me the chance to
take out Ludendorff's operation myself.

821
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:44,854
Are you insane?

822
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,357
I can't introduce rogue elements
this late in the game.

823
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,525
Sir, I can--

824
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:49,859
[Sir Patrick] Now, more than ever,

825
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:53,696
the armistice
is of paramount importance.

826
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:57,534
It must be negotiated, it must be signed,
and this is...

827
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,079
Well, it's the best way
of stopping the war.

828
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:03,248
Captain, you will do nothing.

829
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:05,416
And that is an order.

830
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,377
Yes, sir.

831
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:09,587
I understand, sir.

832
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,548
I don't!

833
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,383
Diana, I know this is confusing...

834
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,552
-It is not confusing! It's unthinkable!
-Who is this woman?

835
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:16,719
She's with me.
She's with us, sir.

836
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,012
I am not with you!

837
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:21,266
You would knowingly sacrifice
all those lives,

838
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:22,475
as if they mean less than yours!

839
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,518
Diana, let's talk
about this outside.

840
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:24,602
As if they mean nothing?

841
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:27,772
Where I come from, generals don't
hide in their offices like cowards.

842
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:30,066
-That's enough!
-They fight alongside their soldiers.

843
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,734
They die with them on the battlefield!

844
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,319
-That's enough!
-You should be ashamed.

845
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:35,321
-My apologies. Diana...
-You should be ashamed.

846
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:36,864
-Diana...
-All of you should be ashamed!

847
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,074
[door bangs shut]

848
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,909
Please slow down!

849
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,411
That's your leader?

850
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,746
How could he say that?
Believe that?

851
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,331
-And you!
-[shushing]

852
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,292
Was your duty
to simply give them a book?

853
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:48,459
No!

854
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:49,752
You didn't stand your ground!
You didn't fight!

855
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,421
Because there was no chance
of changing his mind!

856
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,257
This is Ares, and he's not going to
allow a negotiation

857
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:55,842
or a surrender!

858
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,595
The millions of people you talked about,
they will die!

859
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,263
We are going anyway!

860
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,392
You mean, you were lying?

861
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,769
I'm a spy! That's what I do!

862
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:07,979
How do I know
you're not lying to me right now?

863
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,153
I am taking you to the front.

864
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,864
We are probably going to die.

865
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,783
This is a terrible idea.

866
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:25,079
[breathing heavily]

867
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,457
We're going to need reinforcements.

868
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:30,960
[music playing in pub]

869
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:33,963
[man laughing]

870
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:35,798
[indistinct chatter]

871
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:39,302
[Diana] These are the reinforcements?

872
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,887
[Steve] Yup.

873
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,056
Are these even good men?

874
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,183
Hmm. Relatively.

875
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:50,146
Even in Africa, gentlemen,
we haven't seen such luxuries.

876
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,981
But the luxury that we have now...

877
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:54,651
It's like
we can't stop making money!

878
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:57,070
So, my uncle, the prince, and I--

879
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:59,447
Boy! Which prince is that?

880
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:02,075
I decide to extend the opportunity
for a few good soldiers--

881
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:03,701
[Steve] But, seriously, which prince?

882
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:07,497
Hey, Sultan Angora Mynx Cashmere,

883
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,332
could I talk to you for a minute?

884
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:11,876
[chuckles] Gentlemen,
excuse me one second.

885
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:13,628
"Bar." Well, a "pub."

886
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:17,048
You bugger. I have been greasing
those peacocks all night, and you...

887
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,842
Oh, my goodness gracious.

888
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,844
That's a work of art.

889
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,680
Sameer, Diana. Diana, Sameer.

890
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:26,015
Hi, Diana.
You can call me Sammy, please.

891
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:27,183
"Sammy."

892
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,560
Sameer, I wouldn't do that,
if I were you.

893
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,020
Sameer's a top undercover man.

894
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,564
He can talk the skin off a cat
in as many languages as you can.

895
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:36,693
[speaking Spanish]

896
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:42,865

01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:50,415
[speaking Greek]

898
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:53,501
Oh, you're done.

899
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:54,669
Where's Charlie?

900
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,295
-[indistinct shouting]
-[glass shatters]

901
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,547
[grunting]

902
01:01:58,589 --> 01:01:59,674
Le voilà.

903
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,551
-[grunting]
-[glass shatters]

904
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:05,138
At least this "Charlie"
is good with his fists.

905
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:07,306
That's not Charlie.

906
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:09,308
[patrons cheering]

907
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,146
[exhales]

908
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:14,355
[groans]

909
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,274
That's Charlie.

910
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:21,571
Steven!

911
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,574
May God put a flower
upon your head, son.

912
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,075
Good to see you.

913
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,620
[Diana] So, what were you fighting about?

914
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,499
I mistook his glass for mine.
It happens.

915
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:35,251
This man is no fighter.

916
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,295
Charlie is an expert marksman.

917
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:38,796
It means he shoots people.

918
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:40,590
From very far away.

919
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:42,425
[chuckles] They never know what hit them.

920
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:43,885
[laughing]

921
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,679
So, how do you know who you kill
if you can't see their face?

922
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:49,015
I don't.
Trust me, it's better that way.

923
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,558
You fight without honor.

924
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,769
Who gets paid for honor? Eh?

925
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,480
So, what's the job, boss?

926
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,107
Uh, two days, tops.

927
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,693
We need, uh, supplies
and passage to Belgium.

928
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:01,944
And what's the going rate?

929
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:03,154
Better be a good pay.

930
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,448
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

931
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,451
Um, I told you it was going to be quick.

932
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:12,455
And there's a lot
to be gained by this.

933
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,499
So, it's for a great cause...

934
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:15,917
Uh, freedom...

935
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,126
Hmm.

936
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:18,711
Friendship,

937
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,298
uh, ending the war, friendship--

938
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,800
-Okay, you have no money.
-No.

939
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:27,136
[speaking French]

940
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,725
[chuckles] What?

941
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:33,976
What is this?

942
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,645
We're going to drop her off
at the front.

943
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,438
-"Dropping her off"?
-Yeah.

944
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,316
[Charlie] Listen, sweetheart,
I'm not going to get myself killed

945
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:41,651
helping a wee lassie out of a ditch.

946
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,861
-Know what I mean?
-Here's the little thief now!

947
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:46,030
We don't need your kind around here.

948
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:47,698
[grunts]

949
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:50,827
[patrons gasp]

[indistinct chattering]

951
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,458
She did it!

952
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,920
I'm both frightened and aroused.

953
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,845
-Oh, here they are! Sorry I'm late.
-[Diana] Sir Patrick!

954
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:10,513
Yes, that's what
I was going to mention.

955
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:14,183
-Sir Patrick.
-[Sir Patrick] Oh, no, no, no.

956
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,519
Please, gentlemen, sit.
Miss Prince, sit.

957
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:22,942
I assume you're here
planning something

958
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:26,279
that's going to get you either
court-martialed or killed.

959
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:28,322
And I assume you're here to stop us.

960
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,074
No.

961
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,909
Not at all, in fact.

962
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:33,870
Well, look.

963
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:35,371
I was a younger man, once.

964
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:36,789
And, had I been in better health,

965
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,541
I'd like to think
that I might do the same.

966
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:39,750
[Etta] Hmm.

967
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:42,211
[Sir Patrick] It's a very,
very honorable thing you're doing.

968
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:43,379
Therefore,

969
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:45,923
I'm here to help.

970
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,967
Unofficially, of course.

971
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:50,303
What's your plan?

972
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,765
If there's another weapons facility,
find it and destroy it.

973
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:57,226
Along with Ludendorff and Maru.

974
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:01,230
In that case, to allay suspicion,

975
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:06,027
the charming Etta, here,
could, uh, run the mission from my office.

976
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:07,570
"Run"...

977
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:09,113
[whimpers]

978
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:10,823
Also,

979
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:14,243
there's enough here for a few days.

980
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:20,833
Thank you, sir.

981
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,585
You're very welcome.

982
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:25,171
Take great care, all of you,

983
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:26,339
and good luck.

984
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,717
[indistinct chattering]

985
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:38,684

This is not something you can cross.
It's not possible.

1148
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:50,050
So what? So, we do nothing?

1149
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:51,927
No, we are doing something.
We are.

1150
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:53,429
-We just...
-Steve.

1151

We can't save everyone in this war.

[Sameer] Steve, Steve...

This is not what we came here to do.

[both whispering indistinctly]

No,

1156
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:17,786
but it's what I'm going to do.

is she playing at?

Come on, Charlie. Shoot him!

Hey, it's okay.

1198
01:20:04,841 --> 01:20:05,842
[Steve] Huh.

1209

Please. So important.

Thank you very much.

1211
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:43,398
This has been such an honor for me,
taking your photograph.

1212
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:44,649
Thank you so much.

1213
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:53,366
[Diana] For all his talk of shooting,

1214
01:21:53,533 --> 01:21:55,076
he cannot shoot.

1215
01:21:58,204 --> 01:22:00,749
Not everyone gets to be
what they want to be all the time.

1216
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:03,710
Me, I am an actor.

1217
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:05,253
I love acting.

1218
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:07,088
I didn't want to be a soldier.

1219
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,758
But I'm the wrong color.

1220
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:13,053
Everyone is fighting their own battles,
Diana.

1221
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:15,931
Just as you are fighting yours.

1222
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:23,772
It's too much. I wish you well.

1223

Thank you, thank you.

1224

I'm on the... On the phone--

1225
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:33,615
Uh, it's "Veld." V-E-L-D.

1226
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:35,367
It's a tiny village.

1227
01:22:35,533 --> 01:22:37,285
It may not even be on the map.

1228
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:38,787
[Etta] Ooh! I found it! I found it!

1229
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:40,956
Did you find Ludendorff's operation?

1230
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:42,958
No, no, no. But I located him.

1231
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:45,585
And, oh, lucky you,
he's only a few miles away,

1232
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:47,587
at German High Command.

1233
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:49,631
[Steve] German High Command, huh?

1234
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:51,466
So, intel reports

1235
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:53,802
that Ludendorff is hosting a gala.

1236
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,303
A sort of "last hurrah"

1237
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,806
before the Germans sign the armistice.

1238
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:00,684
And the Kaiser himself
is going to be there.

1239
01:23:01,184 --> 01:23:03,728
As well as Dr. Maru.

1240
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:05,814
Actually, the gala could be
perfect cover.

1241
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,649
-[Sir Patrick] Captain Trevor.
-Yes, sir.

1242
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:10,443
You are, under no circumstances,
to go anywhere near

1243
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:12,654
that gala tomorrow night.
Do you hear me?

1244
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,823
You'd be jeopardizing
everything we've worked for.

1245
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:17,325
You cannot compromise the armistice.

1246
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:19,119
-Sir, there will be no armistice...
-Steve!

1247
01:23:19,285 --> 01:23:21,121
...once Ludendorff bombs
the entire front line.

1248
01:23:21,287 --> 01:23:22,288
Hold on one second, sir.

1249
01:23:22,455 --> 01:23:24,332
You shouldn't be bothered
about upsetting the peace accord.

1250
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:26,334
-Why not?
-Ares would never let...

1251
01:23:26,793 --> 01:23:27,794
What?

1252
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:29,337
What is it?

1253
01:23:29,879 --> 01:23:31,840
Of course. It makes complete sense.

1254
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:36,428
Ares developed a weapon,
the worst ever devised.

1255
01:23:36,594 --> 01:23:38,346
-Ares? You mean Ludendorff.
-No.

1256
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,306
I mean Ares.

1257
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,308
Ludendorff is Ares!

1258
01:23:43,935 --> 01:23:45,687
Sir, this is our last chance,

1259
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:47,605
our final chance
to find out where the gas is

1260
01:23:47,772 --> 01:23:49,566
and to learn how Ludendorff
plans on delivering it.

1261
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:51,484
No, no, no. I forbid it.

1262
01:23:51,651 --> 01:23:52,861
Do you hear me? I forbid it.

1263
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:54,863
Sir, I'm losing you! Sir?

1264

1266

How likely is he to respect my wishes?

1267
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:03,371
Not very likely, I'll be honest.

[Steve] Sammy. Sammy, no. No, no, no.

1271
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:13,423
Sammy, I have to work.

1272
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:14,716
I gotta rustle up a German uniform.

1273
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:16,217
I still have to plot the course
for tomorrow.

1274
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:18,011
That's easy, boss. Come on.

1275
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:19,554
There is nothing we can do
until tomorrow.

1276
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:20,722
You said it yourself, Steve.

1277
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:22,891
So... Madame, s'il vous plaît.

1278
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,059
Incroyable!

1279
01:24:24,851 --> 01:24:26,352
Magnifique!

1280
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:27,562
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1281

You did this.

1288
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:50,585
We did.

1289
01:24:55,548 --> 01:24:56,925
Do you have dancing on

1290
01:24:57,842 --> 01:24:59,094
Paradise Island?

1291
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:01,096
[laughing] Dancing, yeah. Of course.

1292
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:05,266
But these people are just swaying.

1293
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:09,521
Okay, if you're going to be fighting
the God of War,

1294
01:25:09,687 --> 01:25:12,607
I may as well teach you how to dance,
you poor thing.

1295
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:15,485
All right, probably without the gun.

1296
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:16,903
Madame.

1297
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:21,199
If you would.

1298
01:25:21,866 --> 01:25:22,867
Well...

1299
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:26,830
If I'm going to a gala,
I'll need to know how to dance.

1300
01:25:26,996 --> 01:25:28,706
-You're not going to the gala.
-Of course I am.

1301
01:25:28,873 --> 01:25:30,750
-No, you're not.
-Why wouldn't I?

1302
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:32,919
Well, for one,
you don't know how to dance.

1303
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:35,797
I would argue that
they don't know how to dance.

1304
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:37,298
Be polite, be polite.

1305
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:42,428
All right. So, give me your hand.

1306
01:25:42,595 --> 01:25:43,638
Like so.

1307
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:47,559

There's no more money.

We've been paid enough.

There is a whole island

that Ludendorff is Ares, the God of War?

will the war end? Don't be daft.

out of the woods on foot.

You're not going in.
It's too dangerous.

-Too dangerous?
-Yes, too dangerous.

And you're too distracting.

So, look, I'll go in there,

1467
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:40,127
but I am loyal to General Ludendorff.

1468
01:36:40,294 --> 01:36:41,295
Besides,

1469
01:36:41,879 --> 01:36:44,590
now I see your attention is

1470
01:36:45,299 --> 01:36:46,300
[chuckles]

1471
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:48,719
elsewhere.

1472
01:37:09,698 --> 01:37:11,158
[gasps]

1473
01:37:12,826 --> 01:37:14,703
Enjoying the party?

1474
01:37:16,705 --> 01:37:19,667
I confess, I'm not sure what it is
we're celebrating.

1475
01:37:19,833 --> 01:37:22,628
A German victory, of course.

1476
01:37:22,795 --> 01:37:23,796
Victory?

1477
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:26,173
When I hear peace could be so close.

1478
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:27,341
Peace?

1479
01:37:27,508 --> 01:37:29,677
There's only an armistice

1480
01:37:29,843 --> 01:37:31,845
in an endless war.

1481
01:37:32,012 --> 01:37:33,389
Thucydides.

1482
01:37:33,597 --> 01:37:35,516
Ah! You know your Ancient Greeks.

1483
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:37,518
They understood

1484
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:40,020
that war is a god.

1485
01:37:40,187 --> 01:37:41,897
A god that requires human sacrifice.

1486
01:37:42,064 --> 01:37:43,983
And in exchange,

1487
01:37:44,149 --> 01:37:45,859
war gives man purpose,

1488
01:37:46,485 --> 01:37:48,696
meaning, a chance to rise above

1489
01:37:48,862 --> 01:37:51,156
his petty, mortal, little self

1490
01:37:51,699 --> 01:37:53,033
and be courageous,

1491
01:37:53,784 --> 01:37:55,286
noble, better!

1492
01:37:56,287 --> 01:37:59,582
Only one of the many gods
believed in that.

1493
01:37:59,999 --> 01:38:02,167
-Mmm.
-And he was wrong.

1494
01:38:03,377 --> 01:38:05,296
You know nothing of the gods.

1495
01:38:05,462 --> 01:38:06,672
Herr General.

1496
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:11,135
Enjoy the fireworks.

1497
01:38:16,682 --> 01:38:17,725
What are you doing?

1498
01:38:17,891 --> 01:38:19,310
-Out of my way!
-Diana, look at me.

1499
01:38:19,476 --> 01:38:21,145
If you kill Ludendorff
before we find the gas,

1500
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,521
we won't be able to stop anything.

1501
01:38:22,688 --> 01:38:23,689
I will stop Ares!

1502
01:38:23,856 --> 01:38:24,940
What if you're wrong?

1503
01:38:26,567 --> 01:38:28,235
What if there is no Ares?

1504
01:38:30,070 --> 01:38:31,405
You don't believe me.

1505
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:33,657
I can't let you do this.

1506
01:38:34,241 --> 01:38:35,534
What I do is not up to you.

It's the gas.

[Sameer] Diana!

What did they fire?

1517
01:39:05,022 --> 01:39:06,023
The gas.

1518
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:07,733
-It was Ludendorff.
-I saw him. He was in the tower.

1519
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:10,069
-Wherever he goes, you follow.
-[horse whinnies]

01:39:10,611 --> 01:39:11,904
[Sameer] How will you find us?

1521
01:39:12,446 --> 01:39:13,697
I know how.

[exhales]

1525
01:40:35,946 --> 01:40:38,615
[Diana] They're dead.
They're all dead.

1526
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:41,076
I could have saved them.

1527
01:40:41,410 --> 01:40:43,787
I could have saved them
if it weren't for you.

1528
01:40:43,954 --> 01:40:45,873
You stopped me from killing Ares!

1529
01:40:46,457 --> 01:40:48,584
-No!
-Stay away from me!

1530
01:40:48,751 --> 01:40:50,085
I understand everything now.

1531
01:40:50,252 --> 01:40:52,087
It isn't just the Germans
that Ares has corrupted.

1532
01:40:52,254 --> 01:40:53,422
It's you, too.

1533
01:40:54,047 --> 01:40:55,174
All of you.

1534
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:57,676
I will find Ares

1535
01:40:57,843 --> 01:40:59,470
and I will kill him.

it's the Chief!

He followed Ludendorff.

Strange.

1549

Unfortunately, I have another matter

In the name of all

I hereby complete
the mission of the Amazons

I killed him, but nothing stopped.

You kill the God of War,
you stop the war.

Exactly what we have to do now.

We need to stop the gas. Come on.

They can stop fighting now.
Why are they still fighting?

Because, maybe it's them!

Maybe...

My mother was right.

"The world of men do not deserve you."

They don't deserve our help, Steve.

It's about what you believe.

You don't think I get it
after what I've seen out there?

You don't think
I wish I could tell you

1613
01:47:12,884 --> 01:47:14,302
that it was one bad guy to blame?

1614
01:47:15,178 --> 01:47:16,680
It's not!

We're all to blame.

01:47:20,976 --> 01:47:21,977
I am not.

1618
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,272
But maybe I am!

1619
01:47:29,276 --> 01:47:30,360
Please.

1620
01:47:30,527 --> 01:47:32,279
If you believe that
this war should stop,

1621
01:47:32,445 --> 01:47:34,239
if you want to stop it,

1622
01:47:34,406 --> 01:47:36,616
help me stop it right now.

1623
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:41,204
Because, if you don't,
they will kill thousands more.

Please, please come with me.

Sir Patrick.

You were right, Diana.
They don't deserve our help.

1639
01:49:01,368 --> 01:49:05,372
They only deserve destruction.

[sighs] The future.

1647
01:49:51,084 --> 01:49:53,253
I am not your enemy, Diana.

1648
01:49:55,130 --> 01:49:58,967
I am the only one who truly knows you.

1649
01:49:59,134 --> 01:50:03,555
And who truly knows them, as you now do.

1650
01:50:05,932 --> 01:50:09,769
They have always been,
and always will be

and capable of the greatest horrors.

1653
01:50:26,453 --> 01:50:27,954
All I ever wanted

1654
01:50:28,163 --> 01:50:33,126
was for the Gods to see how evil
my father's creation was.

But they refused.

I am Diana of Themyscira...

1657

Only a god can kill another god.

1667

Zeus left the child he had
with the Queen of the Amazons

as a weapon to use against me.

No. You liar.

I am not the God of War, Diana.

I am the God of Truth.

Mankind

1678

They ruined it, day by day.

And I, the only one
wise enough to see it,

1681
01:52:18,148 --> 01:52:20,900
was left too weak to stop them.

1682
01:52:21,609 --> 01:52:25,238
All these years,
I have struggled alone,

1687
01:52:40,628 --> 01:52:42,714
They start these wars on their own.

1688
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:47,594
All I do is orchestrate an armistice
I know they cannot keep,

1689
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:50,346
in the hope
they will destroy themselves.

1690

But it has never been enough.

1691

Until you.

1692
01:52:59,606 --> 01:53:03,860
When you first arrived,
I was going to crush you.

1693
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:07,614
But I knew that
if only you could see

1694
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:10,617
what the other gods could not,

1695
01:53:12,952 --> 01:53:17,540
then you would join me,
and with our powers combined,

1696
01:53:17,707 --> 01:53:21,711
we could finally end all the pain,
all the suffering,

1796
02:03:30,653 --> 02:03:32,071
What are you saying?

1797
02:03:32,488 --> 02:03:33,489
Steve,

1798
02:03:34,156 --> 02:03:36,450
whatever it is, I can do it.

1799
02:03:36,617 --> 02:03:37,618
No. No.

1800
02:03:37,785 --> 02:03:39,412
-Let me do it.
-No.

1801
02:03:39,578 --> 02:03:41,122
It has to be me.

1802
02:03:41,288 --> 02:03:43,082
It has to be me.

1803
02:03:43,249 --> 02:03:46,252
I can save today.
You could save the world.

1804
02:03:55,094 --> 02:03:57,721
I wish we had more time.

1805
02:03:58,264 --> 02:04:00,766
What? What are you saying?

1806
02:04:03,477 --> 02:04:04,603
I love you!

1807
02:04:16,657 --> 02:04:17,950
You're wrong about them.

1808
02:04:27,877 --> 02:04:29,628
They're everything you say,

1809
02:04:30,379 --> 02:04:32,131
but so much more.

1810
02:04:32,298 --> 02:04:33,674
Lies!

1811
02:04:59,909 --> 02:05:03,496
They do not deserve your protection!

1812
02:05:03,662 --> 02:05:04,663
[crackling]

1813
02:05:05,331 --> 02:05:06,499
It's not about deserve.

1814
02:05:11,337 --> 02:05:13,297
It's about what you believe.

1815
02:05:16,509 --> 02:05:18,010
And I believe in love.

1816
02:05:18,177 --> 02:05:22,515
Then I will destroy you!

1817
02:05:24,350 --> 02:05:25,351
[crackling]

1818
02:05:50,376 --> 02:05:52,044
Goodbye, brother.

1819
02:07:36,565 --> 02:07:37,566
[all cheering]

1820
02:09:24,339 --> 02:09:26,675
[Diana] I used to want to save the world.

1821
02:09:27,843 --> 02:09:31,597
To end war and bring peace to mankind.

1822
02:09:32,181 --> 02:09:36,018
But then I glimpsed the darkness
that lives within their light

1823
02:09:36,935 --> 02:09:39,271
and learned that inside
every one of them,

1824
02:09:39,855 --> 02:09:42,107
there will always be both.

1825
02:09:42,941 --> 02:09:45,861
A choice each must make
for themselves.

1826
02:09:46,028 --> 02:09:49,448
Something no hero will ever defeat.

1827
02:09:51,158 --> 02:09:52,159
And now I know

1828
02:09:53,118 --> 02:09:57,748
that only love can truly save the world.

1829
02:09:59,625 --> 02:10:01,293
So, I stay,

1830
02:10:01,460 --> 02:10:03,629
I fight, and I give,

1831
02:10:06,381 --> 02:10:08,383
for the world I know can be.

1832
02:10:13,138 --> 02:10:14,348
This is my mission now.

1833
02:10:17,726 --> 02:10:19,061
Forever.
