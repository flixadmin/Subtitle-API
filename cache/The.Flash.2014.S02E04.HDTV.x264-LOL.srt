1
00:00:00,532 --> 00:00:01,731
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,733 --> 00:00:05,549
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,584
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:08,586 --> 00:00:11,620
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:11,622 --> 00:00:15,225
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:15,227 --> 00:00:17,126
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

7
00:00:17,128 --> 00:00:20,496
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:20,498 --> 00:00:23,867
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:27,003
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:28,546
Previously on The Flash...

11
00:00:28,547 --> 00:00:30,060
Iris' mom is alive.

12
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:31,893
And you thought you could pay me

13
00:00:31,894 --> 00:00:33,781
to walk away from
my own daughter?

14
00:00:33,782 --> 00:00:35,384
Last time, you walked
away for free.

15
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:36,751
When you created the Singularity

16
00:00:36,753 --> 00:00:38,285
you also created a breach...

17
00:00:38,287 --> 00:00:40,187
a portal connecting
our two earths.

18
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:41,556
You really think he's just

19
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:42,957
bringing these guys
here to kill me?

20
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,726
Zoom is obsessed
with destroying me.

21
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:46,360
Now he wants to destroy you.

22
00:00:46,362 --> 00:00:50,398
I'm starting to perceive things...
horrible things.

23
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,367
We have to merge the inner
and outer event horizons

24
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:55,069
by separating the eye of it.

25
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:56,103
No!

26
00:00:58,474 --> 00:01:01,175
Ronnie died saving me,
and I'm so sorry.

27
00:01:01,177 --> 00:01:02,577
No, no, no, get Come here.

28
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,747
Professor Stein,
can you hear me?

29
00:01:07,882 --> 00:01:09,792
2 YEARS AGO

30
00:01:09,793 --> 00:01:11,493
Everyone secretly thinks

31
00:01:11,495 --> 00:01:14,180
they've figured out what
their life is gonna be like,

32
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:17,699
but what no one ever
considers is that life has

33
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:21,670
its own plans for you, whether
you like them or not.

34
00:01:21,672 --> 00:01:24,273
And so you're left
with a choice.

35
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:28,610
You can either embrace the
change and move forward,

36
00:01:28,612 --> 00:01:30,913
or fight it, and be left behind.

37
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:33,615
Dude! I knew you could do it.

38
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,220
That was some touchdown, man.
You won us the game!

39
00:01:38,222 --> 00:01:41,290
Hey, no, man. We
won us the game.

40
00:01:41,292 --> 00:01:42,763
Hey, that's not what the
cheerleaders were saying.

41
00:01:43,594 --> 00:01:44,927
Oh, yeah? For real? A'ight.

42
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:47,763
Jefferson, great game.

43
00:01:47,765 --> 00:01:49,298
Hey, thanks, coach.

44
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,566
I'm not the only
one that noticed.

45
00:01:51,568 --> 00:01:53,903
Lot of scouts in the
stands tonight,

46
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,604
and after that touchdown,

47
00:01:55,606 --> 00:01:57,973
they all pulled out
their cell phones.

48
00:01:57,975 --> 00:02:00,342
You're gonna get your
pick of colleges, son.

49
00:02:00,344 --> 00:02:01,443
You really think so?

50
00:02:01,445 --> 00:02:03,345
I know so.

51
00:02:03,347 --> 00:02:06,581
You get home and
celebrate with your mom.

52
00:02:18,595 --> 00:02:20,829
Everybody, run!

53
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:30,205
Hey, hey, come on,
man, I got you!

54
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:34,743
We gotta get inside the tunnel!

55
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:49,124
Hold him steady!

56
00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:50,392
He's dropping out.

57
00:02:50,394 --> 00:02:51,560
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

58
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:52,727
- PRESENT DAY
- Cisco, we're losing him!

59
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:54,029
Got it!

60
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,374
Thank God.

61
00:03:05,376 --> 00:03:06,775
He's getting worse.

62
00:03:06,777 --> 00:03:08,743
Look, I did what I
could to re-engineer

63
00:03:08,745 --> 00:03:10,245
Doctor Wells's
original stabilizer

64
00:03:10,247 --> 00:03:11,646
to quell the reaction,
but I don't know

65
00:03:11,648 --> 00:03:13,182
what he used as a power source.

66
00:03:13,184 --> 00:03:14,783
Best I could find was the
one from his wheelchair.

67
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:16,551
And how long will that last?

68
00:03:16,553 --> 00:03:18,354
Well, that's the problem,
is we had already used up

69
00:03:18,356 --> 00:03:20,489
most of its energy trying
to dampen the metas' powers

70
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,892
during our little rogue air trip
with Weather Wizard and company.

71
00:03:23,894 --> 00:03:25,594
I think we got a few days tops.

72
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:26,495
And he's stuck in bed?

73
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,997
Yeah, when he wakes up,

74
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,664
I'm gonna transfer the
stabilizer to this,

75
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,666
give him a power cane,
get him moving.

76
00:03:31,668 --> 00:03:33,702
We gotta figure out
a way to save him.

77
00:03:33,704 --> 00:03:36,671
I think I might know
how to do that.

78
00:03:36,673 --> 00:03:38,673
When the Particle
Accelerator exploded,

79
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:41,377
the dark matter that collided
with Professor Stein

80
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:43,645
fused with the Firestorm
matrix and altered

81
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:46,848
the normal molecular processes
that occurs within his body.

82
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,718
Those highly reactive
molecules needed

83
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,887
something to bond with
in order to stabilize.

84
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:53,188
And that's where Ronnie came in.

85
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,824
Yes, and now that
Ronnie is no longer

86
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:57,459
a part of Professor Stein...

87
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:59,094
Those molecules don't
have anything to bond to.

88
00:03:59,096 --> 00:04:00,662
And the longer he
goes without merging,

89
00:04:00,664 --> 00:04:03,198
the more unstable he becomes.

90
00:04:05,236 --> 00:04:08,103
All right, so, what do we do?

91
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:11,006
We find another... participant.

92
00:04:11,008 --> 00:04:13,108
Okay, cool, so, how
do we do that?

93
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,309
Are we just gonna
make a Tinder app

94
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:15,844
for potential meta-humans?

95
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:16,845
'Cause I'm pretty sure
merging with Stein

96
00:04:16,847 --> 00:04:18,313
and randomly
bursting into flames

97
00:04:18,315 --> 00:04:19,848
sounds like the biggest
"swipe left" of all time.

98
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,485
I mean, even if we could
find someone willing,

99
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:25,287
Stein can't just merge
with whoever he wants.

100
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:27,956
No he can't, but I have
done some research,

101
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,958
and found two
potential candidates

102
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,660
that might be
compatible with him.

103
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:33,762
They both were affected
by the dark matter,

104
00:04:33,764 --> 00:04:35,197
and they were both
admitted to the hospital

105
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,100
showing symptoms of gene
rearrangement mutation.

106
00:04:38,102 --> 00:04:39,968
And they both share
the same blood type

107
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,303
as Professor Stein and Ronnie.

108
00:04:41,305 --> 00:04:42,538
All right.

109
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,640
I mean, this is more
than organ donation.

110
00:04:45,642 --> 00:04:46,975
We'll need more
than tissue typing

111
00:04:46,977 --> 00:04:48,910
to see if their bodies
are compatible.

112
00:04:48,912 --> 00:04:51,080
If I can isolate
the genetic locus

113
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,482
of the two candidates
and cross-reference it

114
00:04:53,484 --> 00:04:55,517
with the mutations
in Professor Stein,

115
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,955
I might be able to find a
match and save his life.

116
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,359
What do you need to do that?

117
00:05:23,547 --> 00:05:26,848
All right, blood samples from
both potential candidates.

118
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,717
Damn, that was
fast even for you.

119
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:32,488
I may have skipped the
asking for permission part.

120
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,356
Let's see if we
can't find a match.

121
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:41,963
You were two in that picture.

122
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:45,667
You'd just got some shots. You
were so mad at the nurse.

123
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:47,302
You kept saying,
"She pinched me."

124
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:51,039
So we took you to the park
afterwards to cheer you up,

125
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,041
gave you your first
ice cream cone,

126
00:05:53,043 --> 00:05:55,877
which was a mistake, because all
we heard the next month was,

127
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:58,013
"Mint-choplat chip,
mint-choplat chip."

128
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,717
That's where the
obsession started.

129
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,288
Babe, you don't have to do this.

130
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,825
If you don't want to meet your
mother tomorrow, I get it.

131
00:06:10,827 --> 00:06:14,062
No, it's okay. I
want to meet her.

132
00:06:14,064 --> 00:06:17,732
I need to meet her.

133
00:06:17,734 --> 00:06:20,536
It's gonna be fine.

134
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,572
My brave baby girl.

135
00:06:23,574 --> 00:06:26,208
Take after you.

136
00:06:29,613 --> 00:06:30,812
Love you.

137
00:06:30,814 --> 00:06:32,947
Love you more.

138
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,453
Barry?

139
00:06:38,455 --> 00:06:40,422
Hey, I was just looking for you.

140
00:06:40,424 --> 00:06:42,157
I would've called, but I don't
have your number yet, so.

141
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,592
Oh, yeah...

142
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:45,460
No, no, no, I just
wanted to show you this.

143
00:06:45,462 --> 00:06:46,728
These were just found

144
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,996
in an alley off of
Eastwood Avenue.

145
00:06:47,998 --> 00:06:49,298
What are these, teeth?

146
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,699
Shark teeth.

147
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,434
And I have an
eyewitness that says

148
00:06:52,436 --> 00:06:57,105
he saw a shark walking on land...
a man-shark.

149
00:06:57,107 --> 00:06:58,607
- Man-shark?
- Yeah.

150
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:00,209
Sounds like a bad sci-fi movie.

151
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,876
Or awesome sci-fi movie.

152
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:03,778
Totally.

153
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,015
Are you for real? You
think there's actually,

154
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:08,450
like, a shark...

155
00:07:08,452 --> 00:07:11,420
Yeah, I mean, I know it
sounds really wacko...

156
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:12,588
But, I mean,

157
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,589
nothing seems
impossible now that

158
00:07:13,591 --> 00:07:15,090
we have meta-humans, right?

159
00:07:15,092 --> 00:07:16,458
And I thought it would
be fun, you know,

160
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,594
for us to work together
again on a case.

161
00:07:18,596 --> 00:07:20,028
Yeah, I mean, I really...

162
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,730
I'd love to work on
anything with you.

163
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,865
Um, it's just, you know,

164
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:27,202
meta-humans aren't
really my thing.

165
00:07:27,204 --> 00:07:29,971
Oh, okay, yeah, that's fine.
I can handle it.

166
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:32,507
No, you... look, how
about I just...

167
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:36,010
I'll run a test, see where
the teeth came from.

168
00:07:36,012 --> 00:07:37,078
That would be amazing.

169
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,146
- All right, cool.
- Thanks.

170
00:07:38,148 --> 00:07:39,147
Yeah, sure.

171
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:40,716
Detective Spivot.

172
00:07:40,718 --> 00:07:42,016
Detective.

173
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:44,185
How's your man-shark
case coming?

174
00:07:44,187 --> 00:07:45,621
It's good. I was just gonna go

175
00:07:45,623 --> 00:07:47,289
and canvas the area, see
what else I can dig up,

176
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,758
and Barry here agreed to
run some tests for me.

177
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,892
Really?

178
00:07:50,894 --> 00:07:53,295
So, progress. Thanks again.

179
00:07:55,366 --> 00:07:56,865
If I didn't know any better,

180
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:59,033
I'd say you were flirting
with my partner.

181
00:07:59,035 --> 00:08:00,669
What, Patty? No, I'm...

182
00:08:00,671 --> 00:08:02,103
What are you talking about?

183
00:08:02,105 --> 00:08:03,472
I'm not...

184
00:08:03,474 --> 00:08:07,576
What is it with you and
Iris and my partners?

185
00:08:07,578 --> 00:08:09,478
Hey, how is Iris, by the way?

186
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,012
Eh, she's pretty nervous

187
00:08:11,014 --> 00:08:12,080
about seeing her mother

188
00:08:12,082 --> 00:08:13,248
after all these years.

189
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,683
Yeah.

190
00:08:14,685 --> 00:08:16,351
Hey, you know what, I gotta go.

191
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:18,387
It's Cisco. It's about
Professor Stein.

192
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:19,788
Okay, go. I'll cover
you with Singh.

193
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,923
All right, thanks.

194
00:08:23,727 --> 00:08:26,027
Well, I must admit,
I never imagined

195
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:29,230
the Sphinx's riddle about a
man requiring three legs

196
00:08:29,232 --> 00:08:30,499
would ever apply to me,

197
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:33,067
but if this device
keeps me mobile,

198
00:08:33,069 --> 00:08:34,636
then I will gratefully oblige.

199
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:37,539
Hopefully, you won't
need it for much longer.

200
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,641
There was no agglutination
in the blood samples,

201
00:08:39,643 --> 00:08:41,510
and cross-matching was
negative for both,

202
00:08:41,512 --> 00:08:43,011
and it appears that
the dark matter

203
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:44,613
from the Particle
Accelerator explosion

204
00:08:44,615 --> 00:08:46,448
mutated their genes
in a very similar way

205
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,916
it did to yours.

206
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:49,951
I think they're both
potential matches.

207
00:08:49,953 --> 00:08:51,186
So who do we go with?

208
00:08:51,188 --> 00:08:53,388
Well, my first choice
is Henry Hewitt.

209
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,625
He graduated summa cum laude
from Hudson University

210
00:08:56,627 --> 00:08:58,259
with a double major
in Applied Physics

211
00:08:58,261 --> 00:08:59,494
and Bioengineering.

212
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:01,162
A Hudson boy, I
like him already.

213
00:09:01,164 --> 00:09:03,898
Now, what about this other
guy Jefferson Jackson?

214
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,335
High school quarterback,
4.0 student.

215
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,003
He's got the
physical attributes.

216
00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:12,073
And it looks like more of his
alleles match than Hewitt's.

217
00:09:12,075 --> 00:09:14,443
Doesn't that mean that
he's more compatible?

218
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:17,779
On paper, perhaps, but
Hewitt is a scientist.

219
00:09:17,781 --> 00:09:20,349
Clearly, he's trying to
make something of his life.

220
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,818
I think he'd be open to
something like this.

221
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,985
I think we should meet
with both of them

222
00:09:23,987 --> 00:09:25,086
before we make a decision.

223
00:09:25,088 --> 00:09:26,421
That's an excellent idea.

224
00:09:26,423 --> 00:09:27,989
I'll see if I can
get Hewitt here.

225
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:29,424
All right, in the meantime,

226
00:09:29,426 --> 00:09:30,625
we'll go meet with
Jefferson Jackson.

227
00:09:30,627 --> 00:09:32,260
And I will try to
find something else

228
00:09:32,262 --> 00:09:34,929
to help keep you stable.

229
00:09:57,571 --> 00:09:59,605
Are you sure this
is the right place?

230
00:09:59,607 --> 00:10:02,307
Yeah. Jefferson's a mechanic.

231
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,844
Could indicate a strong
technical aptitude.

232
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:07,145
That's a positive.

233
00:10:07,147 --> 00:10:09,347
Oh, prone to allergies.

234
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:11,583
That's definitely a negative,

235
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:13,952
not to mention his
taste in music.

236
00:10:13,954 --> 00:10:16,482
Would you prefer
Celine Dion instead?

237
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,824
I got the "Titanic"
soundtrack in the back there.

238
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:19,791
No, thank you.

239
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:21,292
Jefferson Jackson, right?

240
00:10:21,294 --> 00:10:22,561
People call me Jax.

241
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:24,396
Catchy.

242
00:10:24,398 --> 00:10:27,566
My name's Barry Allen, and
this is Martin Stein.

243
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:29,267
We're with the
Department of Safety.

244
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:31,803
It's a small, newly
formed agency.

245
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:35,007
Very new, we probably don't
even have a website yet, do we?

246
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,441
You need to see our licenses?

247
00:10:36,443 --> 00:10:37,809
I mean, we're all
up to code here.

248
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:39,878
No, no, nothing like that.

249
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,248
We are compiling data on
people who were affected

250
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,150
by the Particle Accelerator
explosion two years ago.

251
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:47,152
Look, man, I lost
enough time in my life

252
00:10:47,154 --> 00:10:48,987
'cause of that stupid
thing going wrong.

253
00:10:48,989 --> 00:10:51,122
Now, you don't got a car I
can fix, I can't help you.

254
00:10:51,124 --> 00:10:53,992
If you would consider coming
back to S.T.A.R. Labs with us,

255
00:10:53,994 --> 00:10:55,627
I believe we can help you.

256
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:57,095
Help me how?

257
00:10:57,097 --> 00:11:00,231
Well, we know what the
Particle Accelerator did...

258
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,534
Look, I already told you, I
don't talk about that night.

259
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:03,969
Why is that?

260
00:11:03,971 --> 00:11:05,403
Because that's when
everything changed.

261
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:06,672
I got hit hard.

262
00:11:06,674 --> 00:11:08,206
When I woke up, I was
in the hospital.

263
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,175
Busted up leg, torn ACL.

264
00:11:10,177 --> 00:11:12,544
The look on my mom's face,
I knew any dreams I had

265
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,512
of playing pro ball were over.

266
00:11:14,514 --> 00:11:15,714
I'm sorry to hear that.

267
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,515
Yeah, well...

268
00:11:17,517 --> 00:11:19,184
look, I gotta get back to work.

269
00:11:19,186 --> 00:11:21,519
Yeah...

270
00:11:21,521 --> 00:11:24,056
Here, it's just...

271
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,792
it's our number.

272
00:11:26,794 --> 00:11:28,627
Just think about it, okay?

273
00:11:43,477 --> 00:11:45,543
Thank you for putting
this together, Joseph.

274
00:11:45,545 --> 00:11:47,913
Iris's idea, not mine.

275
00:11:49,984 --> 00:11:51,016
Hey, baby.

276
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:52,884
Hi, Dad.

277
00:11:56,156 --> 00:12:00,892
Iris... this is Francine.

278
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,894
Hello.

279
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:06,865
Hi. Hello, Iris.

280
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:10,535
Can I get you a
coffee or something?

281
00:12:10,537 --> 00:12:14,205
Um, no, thanks.

282
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,676
Let's just sit.

283
00:12:17,678 --> 00:12:20,012
I can't get over what a
beautiful young woman

284
00:12:20,014 --> 00:12:21,446
you've become.

285
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:25,717
And a journalist? I'm
so proud of you.

286
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:28,153
Why are you here?

287
00:12:28,155 --> 00:12:32,057
Why now, after two decades?

288
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:34,026
I want to make this
right with you.

289
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:35,961
How about you start
by apologizing

290
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,529
for walking out on us?

291
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:42,233
I am sorry, so very, very sorry.

292
00:12:43,603 --> 00:12:46,071
There's so much you don't know.

293
00:12:46,073 --> 00:12:50,241
I'm sure that you've been
through a great deal,

294
00:12:50,243 --> 00:12:52,544
and I can appreciate you
feeling like this is

295
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:56,682
suddenly the right time for
you to want me in your life,

296
00:12:56,684 --> 00:12:58,750
but that doesn't mean that
it's the right time for me.

297
00:12:58,752 --> 00:12:59,751
Iris...

298
00:12:59,753 --> 00:13:01,519
No, Dad, it's okay.

299
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:03,321
I've thought about this a lot,

300
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:06,758
and it wasn't fair for me
to make you the bad guy.

301
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,861
So I want you to
hear this from me.

302
00:13:09,863 --> 00:13:12,330
I don't hate you, Francine.

303
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:15,100
I do wish you well,

304
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:19,304
but we have lived separate
lives for over 20 years.

305
00:13:19,306 --> 00:13:22,140
Let's keep it that way.

306
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,516
I've always thought

307
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:33,585
my destiny was for
greater things.

308
00:13:33,587 --> 00:13:35,120
And people, of course.

309
00:13:35,122 --> 00:13:36,387
Well, when it's all
said and done,

310
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:38,090
flying will be the
least impressive

311
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:39,991
of your new abilities.

312
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:44,362
Man finally achieves the
promise of the Atomic Age.

313
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:46,631
Caitlin, what's going on?

314
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:50,268
Hi, I'm glad you're back. This is Dr.
Henry Hewitt.

315
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,370
This is Barry Allen and
Professor Martin Stein.

316
00:13:52,372 --> 00:13:53,438
How do you do?

317
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,340
The illustrious Martin Stein.

318
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:57,175
I've read all your
papers back at Hudson,

319
00:13:57,177 --> 00:14:00,979
especially on transmutation.
Fascinating.

320
00:14:00,981 --> 00:14:02,848
- You're a legend.
- Oh, please.

321
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,950
I think you're overestimating
my contribution to the field.

322
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:06,517
- I... I appreciate your enthusiasm.
- Isn't he great?

323
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,120
He's got an ego the
size of Texas,

324
00:14:08,122 --> 00:14:10,622
but, yeah, he's all right.

325
00:14:10,624 --> 00:14:12,824
So, where's Jefferson Jackson?

326
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:14,559
We just need more time.

327
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:15,827
We don't have more time.

328
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:17,328
I couldn't find
another power source

329
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,030
for the cane and that
thing's running out.

330
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:20,866
Okay, then let's do the merge.
Hewitt's in.

331
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:21,900
What do you mean? You
told him the details

332
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,468
of the Firestorm Matrix?

333
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,737
Absolutely, becoming Firestorm
is a huge life change.

334
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,438
He needs to know what he's
getting himself into.

335
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,675
If I remember correctly, vector,
variance, hypotenuse...

336
00:14:30,677 --> 00:14:33,178
- Protonneutron, go H.U.!
- Yes!

337
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,046
Look at that, that's so cute.

338
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:37,215
We'll have two Professor
Steins if this works.

339
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:38,183
It's gonna work.

340
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:40,018
Yeah.

341
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,653
Okay.

342
00:14:41,655 --> 00:14:43,789
When I put this
splicer on your chest

343
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,556
you're gonna feel a rush.

344
00:14:45,558 --> 00:14:47,358
That's a molecular primer being
released into your body.

345
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,060
Then you can make
physical contact

346
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:51,029
with Professor Stein, and...

347
00:14:51,031 --> 00:14:53,531
Firestorm Matrix will take over.

348
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:54,532
Easy enough.

349
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:56,001
Ready?

350
00:14:56,003 --> 00:14:58,369
No time like the present.
Thank you, my dear.

351
00:14:58,371 --> 00:14:59,938
Okay.

352
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:18,723
Try again.

353
00:15:32,605 --> 00:15:35,406
This is unexpected.

354
00:15:35,408 --> 00:15:39,311
Something's supposed to
be happening, right?

355
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,378
Why isn't it working?

356
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,579
I don't know.

357
00:15:42,514 --> 00:15:43,614
Well,

358
00:15:43,616 --> 00:15:46,985
looks like you two aren't
compatible after all.

359
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,354
I'm just gonna...

360
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:51,789
So all this was for nothing?

361
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:55,493
Believe me, no one is more
disappointed than I am.

362
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:57,896
Yeah, don't be so
sure about that.

363
00:15:57,898 --> 00:16:00,631
Next time, try to get
your act together

364
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:03,835
before you get
someone's hopes up.

365
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:28,559
Move the show-and-tell
to next Tuesday,

366
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:29,995
remind me to call
Richard tomorrow

367
00:16:29,997 --> 00:16:31,629
about the shareholders
meeting, and where are we

368
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:33,331
with the replacement
for Doctor Snow?

369
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:39,070
Applied sciences.

370
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,181
Stop!

371
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:51,449
Don't move!

372
00:16:54,487 --> 00:16:56,654
Harrison?

373
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:02,734
Detective West, Thank
you for coming.

374
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:04,113
Doctor McGee, this
is my new partner,

375
00:17:04,115 --> 00:17:05,214
Detective Spivot.

376
00:17:05,216 --> 00:17:06,682
It's nice to meet you.

377
00:17:06,684 --> 00:17:08,784
I was saddened by Detective
Thawne's passing.

378
00:17:08,786 --> 00:17:10,987
Please extend my condolences
to your daughter.

379
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,655
Thank you. On the phone

380
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,290
you mentioned this was
a sensitive matter.

381
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:17,159
It is, and I called you directly

382
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,395
because I've always appreciated
your discretion in the past.

383
00:17:20,397 --> 00:17:22,531
Of course, can you tell
me what was stolen?

384
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:25,334
It's not so much what was
stolen, but who stole it.

385
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:28,303
The person who broke into
my facility last night

386
00:17:28,305 --> 00:17:30,039
was Harrison Wells.

387
00:17:31,643 --> 00:17:33,442
Harrison Wells is dead.

388
00:17:33,444 --> 00:17:35,410
I seem to recall
the circumstances

389
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:37,647
around his passing were
a bit inconclusive.

390
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:39,982
Is there any possibility
he could be alive?

391
00:17:39,984 --> 00:17:41,383
Zero possibility.

392
00:17:41,385 --> 00:17:43,152
I knew the man for
over 20 years.

393
00:17:43,154 --> 00:17:45,254
I know who I saw.

394
00:17:45,256 --> 00:17:48,357
The only thing distinctively
different was...

395
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,493
he's walking again.

396
00:17:51,495 --> 00:17:54,697
Like I said, I trust
your discretion.

397
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,632
You have full access
to the facility.

398
00:17:56,634 --> 00:17:59,835
Thank you again, Detective.

399
00:18:01,472 --> 00:18:06,408
First a shark-man, now
a dead man walking.

400
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,577
We need to call Barry,
get him in here first.

401
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:11,881
Barry can't hear
about any of this.

402
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,515
What... why?

403
00:18:13,517 --> 00:18:15,217
Because he's got a
lot on his plate.

404
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,618
He's got a friend who's
sick who he needs his help,

405
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,555
and Harrison Wells is the man
who murdered his mother.

406
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,523
Once he hears that...

407
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:22,591
Is he okay?

408
00:18:22,593 --> 00:18:24,259
He's fine, but...

409
00:18:24,261 --> 00:18:26,829
not a word to him
or anyone, okay?

410
00:18:26,831 --> 00:18:28,564
Okay.

411
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,934
Yeah, it's just, I'm not
really good at lying.

412
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:34,970
Well, you better learn, quick.

413
00:18:34,972 --> 00:18:38,140
Yeah, definitely.

414
00:18:38,455 --> 00:18:41,265
CENTRAL CITY POLICE

415
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,017
Spivot, go on ahead.

416
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:49,952
Sure.

417
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:52,354
This is the last time
you ever show up here.

418
00:18:52,356 --> 00:18:53,488
Do you understand?

419
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,724
I needed to talk to you again.

420
00:18:54,726 --> 00:18:57,392
How much clearer
do we need to be?

421
00:18:57,394 --> 00:18:59,394
Iris and I do not want
you in our lives.

422
00:18:59,396 --> 00:19:01,396
Leave, please.

423
00:19:01,398 --> 00:19:04,166
Go home, live your life.

424
00:19:04,168 --> 00:19:06,435
Joe, there's something else.

425
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,503
I wanted to tell you when
I first saw you, but...

426
00:19:08,505 --> 00:19:11,640
What is it?

427
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:17,613
Few months ago, I
started getting weak.

428
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:18,881
The doctors ran a
bunch of tests,

429
00:19:18,883 --> 00:19:21,316
they couldn't figure it out.

430
00:19:21,318 --> 00:19:24,153
But finally, they did.

431
00:19:24,155 --> 00:19:27,556
Said I have something
called MacGregor's.

432
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:33,062
Supposedly it's pretty
common among ex-addicts.

433
00:19:33,064 --> 00:19:38,100
Told me I had till the end
of the year if I'm lucky.

434
00:19:38,102 --> 00:19:40,803
Is... is that why you came back?

435
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:44,240
I just want my
daughter to know me...

436
00:19:44,242 --> 00:19:46,208
this me.

437
00:19:54,752 --> 00:19:57,086
I'm really glad you
decided to come.

438
00:19:57,088 --> 00:19:59,755
I thought S.T.A.R.
Labs had to shut down.

439
00:19:59,757 --> 00:20:01,123
It's under new management.

440
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:04,794
What kind of treadmill is that?

441
00:20:04,796 --> 00:20:06,028
Cosmic.

442
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:09,131
Cool.

443
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:11,000
So, let's get started.

444
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:13,102
You got some kind of "Billion
Dollar Man" technology

445
00:20:13,104 --> 00:20:14,703
that gonna fix my knee?

446
00:20:14,705 --> 00:20:17,572
Actually, Jax, this isn't
about fixing your knee.

447
00:20:17,574 --> 00:20:19,508
What are you talking about?

448
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,410
When the Particle
Accelerator exploded,

449
00:20:21,412 --> 00:20:23,946
the energy wave that
collided with you

450
00:20:23,948 --> 00:20:25,747
is known as "dark matter."

451
00:20:25,749 --> 00:20:28,083
And it didn't just
hurt your knee.

452
00:20:28,085 --> 00:20:31,887
It... it changed the molecular
structure of your body.

453
00:20:32,235 --> 00:20:33,622
Hold on, Grey.

454
00:20:33,624 --> 00:20:35,357
So you're saying I'm like
one of those meta-humans

455
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,926
I keep hearing
about on the news?

456
00:20:36,928 --> 00:20:40,229
Yes, I am. Please,
call me Professor.

457
00:20:40,231 --> 00:20:42,898
We think you have
potential capabilities.

458
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,200
What kind of capabilities?

459
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:46,836
The same as Professor Stein:

460
00:20:46,838 --> 00:20:50,572
the ability for your body to
process fission and fusion.

461
00:20:50,574 --> 00:20:52,607
And you can harness
excess energy

462
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:56,011
and turn it into these
massive nuclear blasts.

463
00:20:56,013 --> 00:20:59,281
And you can fly.
There's also that.

464
00:20:59,283 --> 00:21:01,050
So you're saying you
can do all this?

465
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:03,052
Only during times of convergence

466
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,221
with a willing partner.

467
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:08,090
Convergence? You and me?

468
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:09,191
Yes.

469
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,196
No, this is crazy.

470
00:21:14,198 --> 00:21:16,198
No, Jax, this is your chance

471
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,799
to right the wrong
that was done to you.

472
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:19,835
Yeah, sorry, you
got the wrong guy.

473
00:21:19,837 --> 00:21:21,337
I don't want nothing
to do with this.

474
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:22,471
Wait a second, we are
giving you the chance

475
00:21:22,473 --> 00:21:24,173
to be a superhero,

476
00:21:24,175 --> 00:21:25,640
and you're gonna say
no that quickly?

477
00:21:25,642 --> 00:21:27,176
Yeah, not my kind of thing.

478
00:21:27,178 --> 00:21:29,478
If the man isn't willing
to participate...

479
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,881
Look, I saw your
test scores, Jax.

480
00:21:31,883 --> 00:21:33,548
Your grades were good
enough to get into college,

481
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,752
but you didn't go. Why?

482
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,153
Is this the type of guy you are?

483
00:21:38,155 --> 00:21:39,688
One setback and you fold?
Well, then maybe

484
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,390
you're not the guy
for us anyway.

485
00:21:41,392 --> 00:21:42,358
Well, maybe I'm not.

486
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,459
Jack...

487
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:47,562
Maybe this just
wasn't meant to be.

488
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:53,936
Cait, come on, I mean,

489
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,704
Jax could be our last chance

490
00:21:55,706 --> 00:21:57,306
at saving Professor Stein.

491
00:21:57,308 --> 00:22:00,542
He said no to being a superhero.
Who does that?

492
00:22:00,544 --> 00:22:02,411
I mean, you didn't say no
when you had the chance.

493
00:22:02,413 --> 00:22:03,712
Cisco, would you?

494
00:22:03,714 --> 00:22:06,282
Chance to have superpowers?
Sign me up.

495
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:09,218
Look, we're asking Jax to
change his entire life,

496
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,186
to sacrifice what he does have.

497
00:22:11,188 --> 00:22:14,223
I mean, that's not a decision
that can be made lightly.

498
00:22:14,225 --> 00:22:16,158
It took me a long time

499
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,127
to figure out this
whole hero thing.

500
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:21,663
Exactly, which is why we need
someone who wants to do this.

501
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:24,466
Where are you going?

502
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:28,337
To get Hewitt back.
We have to try again.

503
00:22:34,778 --> 00:22:36,078
Human DNA?

504
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,580
Yup, definitely not a man-shark.

505
00:22:38,582 --> 00:22:40,049
Not even a land shark, Ma'am.

506
00:22:40,051 --> 00:22:41,650
Well, thanks for
testing it for me.

507
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,086
Yeah. What are you gonna do now?

508
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:46,221
I don't know, probably file it
under "never gonna happen."

509
00:22:46,223 --> 00:22:47,356
I have another case anyway.

510
00:22:47,358 --> 00:22:49,224
Oh, anything I can
help you with?

511
00:22:49,226 --> 00:22:52,428
No, no, no, no, Detective
said definitely n-not.

512
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,229
Is everything all good?

513
00:22:54,231 --> 00:22:55,331
Sure, why?

514
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,731
I don't know,

515
00:22:56,733 --> 00:22:57,766
you're just acting
kind of different.

516
00:22:57,768 --> 00:22:59,234
No! No.

517
00:22:59,236 --> 00:23:03,705
I'm the same old P.
Spivot, you know?

518
00:23:03,707 --> 00:23:06,741
What... actually, I have to
go, but thank you so much

519
00:23:06,743 --> 00:23:09,211
for testing this,
and I'll see you.

520
00:23:09,213 --> 00:23:11,480
Okay, I...

521
00:23:19,823 --> 00:23:22,624
Yo, Joe.

522
00:23:22,626 --> 00:23:24,726
Hey.

523
00:23:24,728 --> 00:23:27,629
You good? Everything all right?

524
00:23:27,631 --> 00:23:30,099
Yeah. No, I'm...

525
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:31,333
just had hell of a day.

526
00:23:31,335 --> 00:23:32,934
Yeah?

527
00:23:34,571 --> 00:23:37,939
Iris's mother,

528
00:23:37,941 --> 00:23:40,675
she told me she was dying.

529
00:23:40,677 --> 00:23:43,278
Yeah, and I know Francine.

530
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,847
She's telling the
truth about this.

531
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:47,983
Okay.

532
00:23:47,985 --> 00:23:49,751
Does Iris know?

533
00:23:49,753 --> 00:23:51,620
Not yet.

534
00:23:53,457 --> 00:23:55,757
Did... did you need something?

535
00:23:56,525 --> 00:23:59,328
No, no. I just...

536
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,531
Patty said you that you
don't want me on some case

537
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:03,798
that she's on with you.

538
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,300
No.

539
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:06,835
I was checking out a lead.

540
00:24:06,837 --> 00:24:08,504
I'll let you know.

541
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:10,605
All right, cool.

542
00:24:10,607 --> 00:24:13,142
What is up with you and
my partner, anyway?

543
00:24:13,144 --> 00:24:14,876
Come on, I...

544
00:24:14,878 --> 00:24:18,380
Bar, you can't take your
eyes off that girl.

545
00:24:18,382 --> 00:24:20,049
I don't know what you
want me to tell you.

546
00:24:20,051 --> 00:24:21,616
I mean, she's great, you know.

547
00:24:21,618 --> 00:24:24,186
She's adorable and funny

548
00:24:24,188 --> 00:24:26,321
and we have a lot
in common, but...

549
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:28,123
"But, um."

550
00:24:30,127 --> 00:24:32,894
I don't know. She's
not Iris, I guess.

551
00:24:32,896 --> 00:24:35,830
Right.

552
00:24:35,832 --> 00:24:38,800
You've known Iris
since you were ten.

553
00:24:38,802 --> 00:24:42,538
You've been in love
with her since forever.

554
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:48,310
I mean, you two are friends now,
but she was your first love.

555
00:24:48,312 --> 00:24:53,348
You're never gonna feel the
same about anybody else,

556
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:58,554
but you can't let that stop you
from exploring something new.

557
00:24:59,557 --> 00:25:01,690
Yeah.

558
00:25:03,594 --> 00:25:05,727
And in happier news,
remember Flash Day,

559
00:25:05,729 --> 00:25:07,463
the downtown
celebration to honor

560
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:09,631
Central City's one
and only superhero?

561
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,166
Well, just weeks...

562
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:14,603
Hewitt, you have those
nucleosome results?

563
00:25:14,605 --> 00:25:15,737
Tomorrow.

564
00:25:15,739 --> 00:25:17,872
I told you I needed
them tonight.

565
00:25:17,874 --> 00:25:20,709
And I'm telling you you'll
have them tomorrow.

566
00:25:20,711 --> 00:25:22,244
You know, I know you think

567
00:25:22,246 --> 00:25:24,313
you're smarter than
everyone here, Hewitt,

568
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:26,215
but I'm sick of your
not doing your job,

569
00:25:26,217 --> 00:25:27,816
your not showing up.

570
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:30,685
If I have any more trouble
from you, you're done here.

571
00:25:30,687 --> 00:25:32,053
What, you're gonna
take the test away

572
00:25:32,055 --> 00:25:33,722
and give it to another
lab rat of yours?

573
00:25:33,724 --> 00:25:35,824
You're gonna report
me to the board?

574
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,493
Or maybe you're
thinking of firing me?

575
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:39,027
I'd like to see you try!

576
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:41,563
Now get the hell out of my lab!

577
00:25:52,082 --> 00:25:53,348
What's being described as

578
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,882
a "spontaneous
energy malfunction"

579
00:25:54,884 --> 00:25:57,978
erupted last night at
Eikmeier Technologies.

580
00:25:57,979 --> 00:26:01,114
Wanted for questioning is
scientist Henry Hewitt.

581
00:26:01,116 --> 00:26:02,883
Hewitt's dormant abilities
must have been triggered

582
00:26:02,885 --> 00:26:04,484
when we attempted the merger.

583
00:26:04,486 --> 00:26:06,586
This could be catastrophic.

584
00:26:06,588 --> 00:26:07,987
If his powers are
anything like mine

585
00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:10,490
he requires a grounding
mechanism to

586
00:26:10,492 --> 00:26:13,293
stabilize his volatility.
Otherwise...

587
00:26:13,295 --> 00:26:15,161
Yeah, he's gonna pop his top,

588
00:26:15,163 --> 00:26:16,596
and he's got a long
history of violence,

589
00:26:16,598 --> 00:26:17,831
according to his police record.

590
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:19,065
Police record?

591
00:26:19,067 --> 00:26:20,233
I didn't find a police record.

592
00:26:20,235 --> 00:26:21,435
Yeah, of course
not, it was sealed,

593
00:26:21,437 --> 00:26:24,103
but guess what, ya
boy hacked in and...

594
00:26:24,105 --> 00:26:26,005
hold on, wait for it.

595
00:26:26,007 --> 00:26:28,542
One count battery, two
counts aggravated assault,

596
00:26:28,544 --> 00:26:30,310
court-ordered anger
management therapy.

597
00:26:30,312 --> 00:26:31,611
He seemed like such a nice guy.

598
00:26:31,613 --> 00:26:33,613
He even knew your
Hudson nerd song.

599
00:26:35,454 --> 00:26:37,484
You okay?

600
00:26:37,486 --> 00:26:39,853
It appears Mr.
Hewitt's stability

601
00:26:39,855 --> 00:26:42,456
isn't the only one in question.

602
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:44,023
I think I need to lie down.

603
00:26:44,025 --> 00:26:45,224
Yeah, I'll come with you.

604
00:26:45,226 --> 00:26:46,960
Thank you.

605
00:26:48,063 --> 00:26:50,697
Professor Stein
is getting worse.

606
00:26:50,699 --> 00:26:53,266
And Hewitt's like
this because of me.

607
00:26:53,268 --> 00:26:55,535
And now Jefferson Jackson
will never come back

608
00:26:55,537 --> 00:26:58,404
because of what I said.

609
00:26:58,406 --> 00:27:02,943
I just didn't believe that
he has what it takes.

610
00:27:02,945 --> 00:27:07,146
This isn't because you
didn't believe in him.

611
00:27:09,651 --> 00:27:12,586
Sometimes, great possibilities
are right in front of us,

612
00:27:12,588 --> 00:27:15,989
and we don't see them,
because we choose not to.

613
00:27:15,991 --> 00:27:21,795
I think that we need to be open
to exploring something new.

614
00:27:29,938 --> 00:27:33,540
She's dying?

615
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:35,775
A few months left.

616
00:27:35,777 --> 00:27:38,077
I just don't think I
can see her, Dad.

617
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,746
And that's fine.

618
00:27:39,748 --> 00:27:43,449
But you and me need to be
crystal clear about this, Iris.

619
00:27:43,451 --> 00:27:45,852
If you want to have a
relationship with Francine,

620
00:27:45,854 --> 00:27:48,221
it's okay with me. You
don't have to protect me.

621
00:27:48,223 --> 00:27:50,023
I'm a grown man and I've
dealt with these feelings

622
00:27:50,025 --> 00:27:53,192
a long time ago.

623
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,030
So you... you just believe her?

624
00:27:57,032 --> 00:27:58,798
She's done some bad
things in her life,

625
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,902
but she wouldn't lie about this.

626
00:28:01,904 --> 00:28:03,803
Dad, she shows up
out of nowhere,

627
00:28:03,805 --> 00:28:07,574
and only says that she's dying
after I told her to stay away.

628
00:28:07,576 --> 00:28:11,110
Look, she didn't come to
Central City to see me.

629
00:28:11,112 --> 00:28:12,879
She came because of you.

630
00:28:12,881 --> 00:28:14,480
I just wanted you
to know everything

631
00:28:14,482 --> 00:28:16,215
so you can make the best
decision for yourself.

632
00:28:16,217 --> 00:28:19,653
I mean, she is
still your mother.

633
00:28:19,655 --> 00:28:23,924
Either way, whatever you decide,
just know, I got your back.

634
00:28:25,761 --> 00:28:28,895
I know.

635
00:28:36,104 --> 00:28:37,804
Let me guess,

636
00:28:37,806 --> 00:28:39,439
you don't got car troubles.

637
00:28:39,441 --> 00:28:43,476
I came to apologize. I'm
sorry for what I said.

638
00:28:43,478 --> 00:28:45,779
It's fine. Apology accepted.

639
00:28:45,781 --> 00:28:47,346
Look, we could
really use your help

640
00:28:47,348 --> 00:28:48,782
to save Professor Stein.

641
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,316
That desperate?

642
00:28:50,318 --> 00:28:52,018
Yes.

643
00:28:52,671 --> 00:28:56,289
My husband, Ronnie,

644
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:58,925
he used to be Professor
Stein's other half.

645
00:28:58,927 --> 00:29:01,461
He actually helped build
the Particle Accelerator,

646
00:29:01,463 --> 00:29:07,567
and when it exploded, he
was affected by it too.

647
00:29:07,569 --> 00:29:10,336
Ironically, that's how
he got the chance

648
00:29:10,338 --> 00:29:16,109
to show the world what
he was truly capable of.

649
00:29:16,111 --> 00:29:18,244
And he died saving this city.

650
00:29:18,246 --> 00:29:21,681
Wait, he was the guy that
flew into the black hole?

651
00:29:21,683 --> 00:29:23,316
That was him?

652
00:29:23,318 --> 00:29:24,684
He was a hero.

653
00:29:24,686 --> 00:29:26,753
You can be one too.

654
00:29:26,755 --> 00:29:28,521
I never wanted to be a hero.

655
00:29:28,523 --> 00:29:30,156
What I wanted was
to go to college,

656
00:29:30,158 --> 00:29:31,858
but we couldn't afford it.

657
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,794
Football was my way in, until
that got taken from me.

658
00:29:34,796 --> 00:29:37,330
I know. Look, I know

659
00:29:37,332 --> 00:29:39,432
the Particle Accelerator
took something from you.

660
00:29:39,434 --> 00:29:42,535
but it also gave you
something in return,

661
00:29:42,537 --> 00:29:45,705
something even more spectacular,

662
00:29:45,707 --> 00:29:49,275
the opportunity to be
part of something bigger,

663
00:29:49,277 --> 00:29:52,211
to be part of a team that's
working to protect people

664
00:29:52,213 --> 00:29:54,147
from losing what you lost.

665
00:29:55,984 --> 00:29:58,718
I believe you were
meant to be a hero.

666
00:30:03,915 --> 00:30:06,626
Hold on.

667
00:30:06,628 --> 00:30:08,528
I've been looking for you, Dr.
Snow.

668
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:11,131
Hey, look, man, we're...

669
00:30:17,072 --> 00:30:19,405
You did this to me!

670
00:30:19,407 --> 00:30:22,508
But it's not what you
promised, is it?

671
00:30:23,879 --> 00:30:25,545
Is it?

672
00:30:29,017 --> 00:30:30,917
Come on!

673
00:30:36,091 --> 00:30:37,123
Where to?

674
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:39,025
S.T.A.R. Labs.

675
00:30:54,314 --> 00:30:55,480
Caitlin.

676
00:30:55,482 --> 00:30:57,815
- What's wrong?
- Come here.

677
00:30:57,817 --> 00:30:59,384
Oh, good, you're here.

678
00:30:59,386 --> 00:31:01,319
This thing, it ran out,
like, 30 minutes ago.

679
00:31:01,321 --> 00:31:04,088
His temperature is 142
degrees and rising fast.

680
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,290
He's going into rapid oxidation.

681
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:06,691
We need to find a coolant.

682
00:31:06,693 --> 00:31:09,561
I think it's too late for that.

683
00:31:09,563 --> 00:31:11,396
I'll do it.

684
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:13,198
I'll merge with him.

685
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,399
You said this is a
chance for me to be

686
00:31:14,401 --> 00:31:16,601
a part of something
bigger than myself,

687
00:31:16,603 --> 00:31:19,370
to help people.
That's what I want.

688
00:31:19,372 --> 00:31:20,905
You're sure?

689
00:31:20,907 --> 00:31:23,608
Once you merge, there's
no going back on this.

690
00:31:24,611 --> 00:31:26,010
And you said I could fly, right?

691
00:31:26,012 --> 00:31:27,912
- Damn right.
- Okay.

692
00:31:27,914 --> 00:31:29,447
So what do I do?

693
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:31,316
Okay, well, here's the
abridged version.

694
00:31:31,318 --> 00:31:33,150
Professor Stein?

695
00:31:33,152 --> 00:31:35,720
- Professor Stein?
- Clarissa, five more minutes.

696
00:31:35,722 --> 00:31:37,589
No, Professor, you
have to get up.

697
00:31:37,591 --> 00:31:38,623
Jax is here.

698
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:39,591
- Yeah.
- What?

699
00:31:39,593 --> 00:31:40,891
- Jax is here.
- What?

700
00:31:40,893 --> 00:31:42,093
- Here, grab onto me.
- Jax?

701
00:31:42,095 --> 00:31:43,027
Yeah.

702
00:31:45,732 --> 00:31:47,031
This is it.

703
00:31:56,909 --> 00:31:59,744
You came back,
Jefferson, thank you.

704
00:31:59,746 --> 00:32:01,412
Well, like my coach always said,

705
00:32:01,414 --> 00:32:04,382
"Out of yourself and
into the team."

706
00:32:04,384 --> 00:32:05,750
So, how's this work?

707
00:32:05,752 --> 00:32:07,685
Okay, all you're gonna
do is touch him.

708
00:32:07,687 --> 00:32:08,686
And then what happens?

709
00:32:08,688 --> 00:32:09,987
You become Firestorm.

710
00:32:09,989 --> 00:32:11,623
Okay.

711
00:32:27,807 --> 00:32:29,974
Jax?

712
00:32:32,145 --> 00:32:34,479
Is Professor Stein...

713
00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:35,846
How will I know?

714
00:32:35,848 --> 00:32:37,047
Hello, Jefferson.

715
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:38,283
Now you know.

716
00:32:38,285 --> 00:32:40,585
Oh, so I get Grey as my copilot.

717
00:32:40,587 --> 00:32:43,755
Did no one ever inform you
of that fringe benefit?

718
00:32:43,757 --> 00:32:46,391
So when do we get to take
this for a test spin?

719
00:32:49,162 --> 00:32:50,595
How about now?

720
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:52,229
It looks like
Hewitt's re-charging

721
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:53,964
at Central City High
School's football stadium.

722
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:57,502
Wait, that was where I got hurt.

723
00:33:14,788 --> 00:33:17,154
Cisco, cut the
power to the field

724
00:33:17,156 --> 00:33:18,523
so he can't draw anymore energy.

725
00:33:18,525 --> 00:33:20,090
I'm on it. Stand by.

726
00:33:31,938 --> 00:33:35,072
Hewitt! You need to stop!

727
00:33:35,074 --> 00:33:36,907
This is not who you are!

728
00:33:39,512 --> 00:33:43,681
Stein? You chose him over me?

729
00:33:43,683 --> 00:33:46,751
That's who I'm supposed to be!

730
00:33:46,753 --> 00:33:49,487
I deserve the Firestorm Matrix!

731
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:51,356
Move, now!

732
00:33:51,358 --> 00:33:54,959
Calm down, Jefferson, focus.

733
00:33:54,961 --> 00:33:58,596
Use your natural athleticism
to gain control.

734
00:34:02,101 --> 00:34:03,634
Hey, you okay?

735
00:34:03,636 --> 00:34:06,471
I was a quarterback. I
know how to take a hit.

736
00:34:06,473 --> 00:34:08,506
Hey, guys, cutting the
power didn't work.

737
00:34:08,508 --> 00:34:11,008
It's like the more we anger
him, the stronger he gets.

738
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,710
That's it, it's like
one of those...

739
00:34:12,712 --> 00:34:14,779
controlled fusion devices.

740
00:34:14,781 --> 00:34:15,813
Tokamak?

741
00:34:15,815 --> 00:34:17,081
Yes, exactly,

742
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:18,282
and the more powerful
they become,

743
00:34:18,284 --> 00:34:19,851
the more unstable they become.

744
00:34:19,853 --> 00:34:22,754
Barry, make him angry,
and he'll blow his fuse.

745
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:26,023
You up for a little game
of "catch me if you can?"

746
00:34:26,025 --> 00:34:28,292
Let's go for it.

747
00:34:28,294 --> 00:34:29,927
Okay.

748
00:34:37,103 --> 00:34:39,604
Hey, Hewitt, over here!

749
00:34:41,173 --> 00:34:43,474
Paging Dr. Hewitt.

750
00:34:47,547 --> 00:34:49,146
Man, you are not good at this.

751
00:34:50,316 --> 00:34:51,849
Do you need a hug, Doctor?

752
00:34:56,188 --> 00:34:58,856
Come on, Hewitt, give
me your best shot!

753
00:34:58,858 --> 00:34:59,957
Now.

754
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:06,764
Is that all you got, Hewitt?

755
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:08,265
Man, no wonder you
didn't make the cut

756
00:35:08,267 --> 00:35:09,300
if that's how you fight.

757
00:35:25,752 --> 00:35:27,819
Not bad for your
first go at this.

758
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:30,187
Well, I had a great coach
to help me through it.

759
00:35:30,189 --> 00:35:31,422
Isn't that right, Grey?

760
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:35,392
Despite my initial reservations,
we make a pretty fantastic team.

761
00:35:36,529 --> 00:35:39,530
Welcome aboard, Firestorm.

762
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,651
Hi.

763
00:35:57,389 --> 00:36:00,156
Thank you for coming.

764
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,859
You have no idea what
this means to me.

765
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:07,096
My dad told me you were sick.

766
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:10,333
You know, I wasn't sure
that I could believe you,

767
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:13,869
so I did some checking.

768
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,405
Turns out you're
telling the truth.

769
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:19,342
I would never lie to you
about something so big.

770
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,877
Really?

771
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,546
'Cause I was actually thinking
that I could give you

772
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:28,484
another chance after
hearing that news.

773
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:33,222
But you're still lying,
still keeping secrets.

774
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:37,560
I'm an investigative
reporter, Francine.

775
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:41,764
I uncover things that
people want to keep hidden,

776
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,666
like having a son.

777
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:45,168
Iris...

778
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,503
He was born eight months
after you left Central City.

779
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:48,671
Let me explain.

780
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,174
Who's the father, Francine?

781
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:54,677
Is it my dad?

782
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,981
Do I have a brother?

783
00:36:57,983 --> 00:37:01,884
Wait, you know, I don't even want...
I don't want to know.

784
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,119
I mean, I wouldn't
be able to tell

785
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:04,454
if you were telling the
truth or if it was

786
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:06,289
another one of
your lies, anyway.

787
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,160
I want you to leave.

788
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:14,697
You stay away from me, and you
stay away from my father.

789
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,333
If he finds out that he might
have a son that grew up

790
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:20,736
without even knowing
him, it would crush him.

791
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,438
Just...

792
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,774
Leave us alone.

793
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:28,478
Iris, I was...

794
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,218
And how is Mr. Hewitt?

795
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,620
Seems like that last burst
of energy has burnt him out.

796
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,389
Our Tokamak's gone dark.

797
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:40,689
Yeah, we're just
gonna keep him...

798
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:42,225
safe and sound in the pipeline

799
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:44,327
till he decides to keep
quiet about all this.

800
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:46,095
So you're gonna meet
up with Clarissa?

801
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,663
We're meeting in
Pittsburgh in three days.

802
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:48,998
Why Pittsburgh?

803
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,833
A colleague of mine
was monumental

804
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,902
in helping train Ronald and me.

805
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:55,171
She's graciously offered to
help the two of us as well.

806
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:56,539
How's she gonna help us?

807
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:58,508
Well, there were many
aspects of our abilities

808
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,576
that we never quite achieved.

809
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:04,813
Hopefully now, we can fully
realize that potential.

810
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:09,252
Oh, my dearest Dr. Snow.

811
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:18,261
Ronald may be lost to us, but
he will never be forgotten.

812
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:23,132
Speaking of...

813
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,801
this was Ronnie's.

814
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,671
He always used it to
find his way back home.

815
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,273
I want you to have it.

816
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:36,446
Thank you.

817
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:38,281
You know, this whole
thing is strange,

818
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:40,015
being 50% of someone.

819
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:42,651
Yeah, but you're 100% a hero.

820
00:38:45,223 --> 00:38:47,056
I went ahead and
recalibrated the splicer

821
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,958
so the merging should
be even smoother now.

822
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,259
Thank you.

823
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:54,063
If I may offer a bit
of parting advice.

824
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:57,333
Cisco, I know you're scared,

825
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:01,937
but this ability you have
is a gift, not a curse.

826
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:04,307
It's natural to be apprehensive
about the unknown,

827
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:05,908
but look at Jefferson.

828
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:11,880
He took a leap, and it changed
his life for the better.

829
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:14,850
The very thing that
makes you different

830
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,752
is what makes you special.

831
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,656
Tell your friends.

832
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,365
And now I believe it's time to
take this show on the road...

833
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,667
or to the sky, if I
am to be literal.

834
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,611
Are you ready, Jefferson?

835
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,029
All right.

836
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:02,798
- See you later.
- Yeah.

837
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,800
That was one hell
of a leap of faith

838
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:07,036
that kid took, merging
with Professor Stein.

839
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:08,604
Yeah, it was.

840
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:12,908
There's a lesson in there
somewhere for you.

841
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,545
Things aren't always
what they seem.

842
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:17,547
Our fears can play tricks on us,

843
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:19,848
making us afraid
to change course,

844
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,784
afraid to move on,

845
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,786
but usually, hidden
behind our fears

846
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,689
are second chances
waiting to be seized...

847
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:30,694
PROJECT: FIRESTORM

848
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:33,196
Second chances at life...

849
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,571
At glory...

850
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:48,311
At family...

851
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:55,618
At love.

852
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,254
And these opportunities don't
come around every day,

853
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:00,723
so when they do, we
have to be brave,

854
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:04,159
take a chance, and grab
them while we can.

855
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:09,798
Zoom wants you dead.

856
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:19,375
Oh, my God, it's real.

857
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:21,210
Hey! Put him down!

858
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:23,713
Put your hands...
your fins in the air!

859
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,963
Who the hell are you?
