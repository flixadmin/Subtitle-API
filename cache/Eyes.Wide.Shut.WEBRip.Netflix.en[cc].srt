ALICE:
Isn't it on the bedside table?

3
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,200
Now listen, we're running a little late.

ALICE:
I know.

5
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,537
How do I look?

6
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,205
Perfect.

7
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,124
Is my hair okay?

8
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,750
It's great.

9
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,044
You're not even looking at it.

10
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,714
It's beautiful.

11
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,841
You always look beautiful.

12
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,385
Did you give Roz the phone
and pager numbers?

13
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,054

Yeah, I put it on the fridge. Let's go.

I'm ready.

What's the babysitter's name?

18
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,121
Roz.

19
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,460
Okay, Roz, we're going now.

20
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,504

You look amazing, Mrs. Harford.

21

Thank you.
Helena, are you ready for bed?

22

Yes, Mommy. Can I stay up
and watch <i>The Nutcracker?</i>

23

ALICE: What time's it on?
-9:00.

24
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,848
-You can watch that.
-Can I stay up until you get home?

25
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:23,143
-No, darling.
BILL: It'll be a little late for that.

26

...and there's food in there,
so help yourself.

28

We shouldn't be later than 1:00.

-I'll hold our cab to take you home.
-Thanks, Dr. Harford.

Alice, look at you.
God, you're absolutely stunning!

37

I don't say that to all the women.

-Yes, he does.
-He does?

That osteopath you sent me to,
the guy that worked on my arm?

-You ought to see my serve now.
-He's the top man in New York.

I could have told you that,
looking at his bill.

Do you know anyone here?

BILL:
Not a soul.

46
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:52,315
Why do you think Ziegler invites us
to these things every year?

47
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:57,988
This is what you get
for making house calls.

48
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,293
You see that guy at the piano?

49
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,046
I went to medical school with him.

Really?

51
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,387
He plays pretty good for a doctor.

52
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,767
He's not a doctor. He dropped out.

Ladies and gentlemen,
I hope you're enjoying yourselves.

How the hell are you, buddy?

64
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,652
-How long has it been?
-I don't know. Ten years?

65
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,195
And a couple.

66
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,614
-Do you have time for a drink?
-Sure.

67

You haven't changed a bit.

Thanks, I think.
So how you doing?

00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,876
Not too bad, you know. Not too bad.

70
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,379
I see you've become a pianist.

Oh, yes, well, my friends call me that.

How about you?
You still in the doctor business?

You know what they say:
"Once a doctor, always a doctor."

74
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:52,351
Yes, or in my case:
"Never a doctor, never a doctor."

75
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,605
I never did understand
why you walked away.

Did you ever read the Latin poet Ovid
on <i>The Art of Love?</i>

91
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,892
Didn't he wind up all by himself...

92
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,853
...crying his eyes out...

93
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:02,816
...in some place
with a very bad climate?

94

But he also had a good time first.

A very good time.

who wouldn't mind if we danced.

...I'm looking for a job.

I have some friends in the art game.

00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,707

Don't you think
one of the charms of marriage...

114
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,170
...is that it makes deception
a necessity for both parties?

You don't remember me, do you?

125

You were very kind to me once.

126
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,514
Only once?
That sounds like a terrible oversight!

127
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,103
I was doing a photo session
in Rockefeller Plaza...

-Just about half of Fifth Avenue.

lose their virginity...

...and be free to do

...about all sorts of things.

163
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,090
What happened?

164
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,551
VICTOR:
Well, she was....

165
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:26,222
She was shooting up
and she had a bad reaction.

166
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,225
What did she take?

167
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,730
A speedball or a snowball
or whatever the hell they call it.

168
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,773
It's heroin and coke.

169
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,737
BILL:
Heroin and coke?

170
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,574
Anything else?

171
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,495
We had a couple of drinks,
some champagne. That was it.

172
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,664
How long has she been like this?

173
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:55,251
Maybe five minutes, six minutes,
something like that.

174
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,669
What's her name?

175
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,047
Mandy.

176
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,885
Mandy?

177
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,679
Mandy?

178
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,475
Can you hear me, Mandy?

179
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,438
Can you hear me?
Move your head if you can hear me.

180
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,026
Move your head if you can
hear me, Mandy. There you go.

181
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,819
You can hear me.

182
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:26,240
Can you open your eyes for me?
Mandy, can you do that?

183
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,286
Let me see you open your eyes.
There you go, come on.

184
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:33,498
Come on, look at me. Look at me.

185
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,542
Look at me. Look at me.

186
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,463
Look at me. Look at me, Mandy.

187
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,174
Good.

188
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,010
Good.

189
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,265
I love Victor's art collection,
don't you?

190
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,852
Yes.

191
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:57,063
It's wonderful.

192
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,567
Have you ever seen
his sculpture gallery?

193
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,737
No.

194
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,573
I haven't.

195
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:13,162
He has a wonderful collection
of Renaissance bronzes.

196
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,500
Do you like the period?

197
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,380
I do.

198
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,174
I adore it.

199
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,720
The sculpture gallery is upstairs.

200
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,182
Would you like to see it?

201
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,062
I can show it to you.

202
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,568
We won't be gone long.

203
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,785
Maybe...

204
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,583
...not just...

205
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,169
...now.

206
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:23,483
That was really one hell
of a scare you gave us, kiddo.

207
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,402
Sorry.

208
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,538
How are you feeling now, Mandy?

209
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:40,708
Better.

210
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:54,805
You are a very, very lucky girl.

211
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,308
You know that?

212
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,145
I know.

213
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,524
You're gonna be okay this time.

214
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:09,028
But you can't keep doing this.

215
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,280
You understand?

216
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:14,784
Yeah.

217
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,580
You're going to need some rehab.
You know that, don't you?

218
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,959
I know.

219
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,462
Okay.

220
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,423
Okay.

221
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,346
Well, Victor...

222
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,100
...I'll leave the rest to you.

223
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,061
Is it okay if I dress her
and get her out of here?

224
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,982
No, I'd keep her here
for another hour.

225
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,692
Another hour?

226
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,530
Then I'd have someone take her home.

227
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,242
Okay. Okay.

228
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,079
Good night, Mandy.

229
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,789
Listen....

230
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,251
I can't thank you enough for this.

231
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,212
-You saved my ass.
-I'm glad I was here.

232
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,881
Bill, I probably....

233
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:15,261
I know I don't have to mention this...

234
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,389
...but this is just between us.

235
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,141
Of course.

236
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:21,934
Thanks.

237
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:47,543
I think I've had
a little too much champagne.

238
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:54,258
I think I have to go
and find my husband now.

239
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:59,096
But I'm sure he'll be all right
on his own a little longer.

240
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,017
Yes...

241
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,062
...but will I?

242
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,439
Of course you will.

243
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,777
No.

244
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:17,406
I really have to go.
I have to go.

245
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,408
You don't, you know.

246
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,746
Yes, I do.

247
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,165
Alice?

248
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,920
I must see you again.

249
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,341
-That's impossible.
-Why?

250
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,594
Because...

251
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,432
...I'm married.

252
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,790
BILL:
Good morning, Lisa.

253
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,126
Good morning, doctor.
Your mail.

254
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,254
Good. Please ask Janelle
to bring me my coffee.

255
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,089
-Sure.
-Thank you.

256
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,634
-Good morning, Sarah.
-Good morning, doctor.

257
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,888
<i>"'Twas the night before Christmas,</i>
<i>when all through the house...</i>

258
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,974
<i>...not a creature was stirring,</i>
<i>not even a mouse."</i>

259
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,731
Okay. That's fine.
You can put your gown on.

260
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,154
Hold this for Mommy.

261
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,532
-Looking forward to Christmas?
-Yeah.

262
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,327
-Does this hurt?
-Yeah.

263
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:41,926
-Right there?
-Yeah.

264
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,814
Daddy's gonna like that.

265
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,233
Very good choice.

266
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,361
"--before me...

267
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:05,825
...when I jump into my bed."

268
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:11,997
We should call the Zieglers
and thank them for the party.

269
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,792
BILL:
I've taken care of that.

270
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,795
ALICE:
Good.

271
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:22,132
So how do you feel about wrapping
the rest of the presents?

272
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,011
Let's do that tomorrow.

273
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,184
Tell me something.

274
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:22,443
Those two girls...

275
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,906
...at the party last night....

276
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,747
Did you...

277
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,125
...by any chance...

278
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,836
...happen to...

279
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,299
...fuck them?

280
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,261
What?

281
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,850
What are you talking about?

282
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:02,524
I'm talking about the two girls...

283
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,695
...that you were so blatantly
hitting on.

284
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:11,449
I wasn't hitting on anybody.

285
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,497
Who were they?

286
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:23,461
They were just a couple of models.

287
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:32,054
And where did you disappear to
with them for so long?

288
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,223
Wait a minute.

289
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,809
Wait a minute.

290
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:42,606
I didn't disappear with anybody.

291
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:48,028
Ziegler wasn't feeling too well...

292
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,740
...and I got called upstairs
to see him.

293
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:58,496
Anyway, who was the guy
you were dancing with?

294
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,548
A friend of the Zieglers.

295
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,635
What did he want?

296
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,929
What did he want?

297
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,975
What did he want?

298
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,271
Sex...

299
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,275
...upstairs.

300
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,236
Then and there.

301
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,198
Is that all?

302
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,118
Yeah, that was all.

303
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:39,121
Just wanted to fuck my wife.

304
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:44,960
That's right.

305
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,588
Well, I guess that's understandable.

306
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,760
Understandable?

307
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,804
Because you are a very...

308
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:59,016
...very beautiful woman.

309
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,434
Whoa.

310
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:01,852
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

311
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,479
Wait.

312
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,151
Because I'm a beautiful woman...

313
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,655
...the only reason any man
ever wants to talk to me...

314
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:19,870
...is because he wants to fuck me.
Is that what you're saying?

315
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:27,336
Well, I don't think it's quite
that black and white...

316
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:34,343
...but I think we both know
what men are like.

317
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,347
So on that basis...

318
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:43,519
...I should conclude that you
wanted to fuck those two models.

319
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,482
There are exceptions.

320
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:54,029
And what makes you an exception?

321
00:26:56,782 --> 00:27:00,452
What makes me an exception is that...

322
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:04,123
...I happen to be in love with you.

323
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,792
And because we're married...

324
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,296
...and because I would never
lie to you...

325
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,549
...or hurt you.

326
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:25,269
Do you realize that
what you're saying...

327
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:28,897
...is that the only reason you
wouldn't fuck those models...

328
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,649
...is out of consideration for me?

329
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,903
Not because you really
wouldn't want to.

330
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,031
Let's just relax, Alice.

331
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,826
This pot is making you aggressive.

332
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:44,454
No! It's not the pot. It's you!

333
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:47,291
Why can't you ever give me
a straight fucking answer?

334
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,085
I was under the impression
that's what I was doing.

335
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:53,505
I don't even know
what we're arguing about here.

336
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,924
I'm not arguing.

337
00:27:56,633 --> 00:28:01,180
I'm just trying to find out
where you're coming from.

338
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:03,140
Where I'm coming from?

339
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:12,316
Let's say, for example,
you have some gorgeous woman...

340
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:16,653
...standing in your office naked...

341
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,531
...and you're feeling her fucking tits.

342
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,533
Now, what I want to know....

343
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:26,747
I want to know what you're thinking
about when you're squeezing them.

344
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,084
Alice, I happen to be a doctor.

345
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,879
It's all very impersonal...

346
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:37,674
...and you know
there's always a nurse present.

347
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:43,096
So when you're feeling tits, it's
nothing more than your professionalism?

348
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:44,348
Exactly.

349
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:49,102
Sex is the last thing on my mind
when I'm with a patient.

350
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:54,566
Now, when she is having
her little titties squeezed...

351
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,027
...do you think she ever
has fantasies...

352
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:01,531
...about what handsome Dr. Bill's
dickie might be like?

353
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:07,913
Come on, I can assure you
sex is the last thing...

354
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:12,376
...on this fucking hypothetical
woman patient's mind.

355
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,503
And what makes you so sure?

356
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:21,551
If for no better reason...

357
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:25,055
...because she's afraid of
what I might find.

358
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:30,727
So after you tell her that
everything's fine, what then?

359
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,188
What then?

360
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,817
I don't know, Alice....

361
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,653
What then?

362
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,534
Women don't....

363
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,205
They basically just don't
think like that.

364
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:56,044
Millions of years of evolution, right?

365
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,340
Men have to stick it in
every place they can...

366
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:03,760
...but for women, it is just about
security and commitment...

367
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,221
...and whatever the fuck else!

368
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:10,183
A little oversimplified, Alice.
But yes, something like that.

369
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:14,354
If you men only knew.

370
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:19,860
What I do know is you got stoned,
you tried to pick a fight...

371
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:23,196
...and now you're trying
to make me jealous.

372
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,574
But you're not the jealous type,
are you?

373
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:26,908
No, I'm not.

374
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,202
You've never been jealous about me,
have you?

375
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:30,454
No, I haven't.

376
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,123
And why haven't you ever
been jealous about me?

377
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:37,294
Well, I don't know, Alice.
Maybe because you're my wife.

378
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,880
Maybe because you're
the mother of my child...

379
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,883
...and I know you would never
be unfaithful to me.

380
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:47,387
You are very, very sure of yourself...

381
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:48,889
...aren't you?

382
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,599
No.

383
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,101
I'm sure of you.

384
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,199
Do you think that's funny?

385
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,918
All right. Fuck it.

386
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:22,506
Now we get
the fucking laughing fit, right?

387
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,435
Do you...?

388
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:41,274
Do you remember
last summer at Cape Cod?

389
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,446
Yes.

390
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:51,284
Do you remember one night
in the dining room...

391
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,662
...there was this young naval officer...

392
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:58,458
...and he was sitting near our table
with two other officers?

393
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,002
No.

394
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,843
The waiter brought him a message,
at which point he left.

395
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,720
Nothing rings a bell?

396
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,764
No.

397
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:18,687
Well...

398
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:24,693
...I first saw him
that morning in the lobby.

399
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,196
He was checking into the hotel...

400
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:31,908
...and he was following the bellboy
with his luggage...

401
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,578
...to the elevator.

402
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:43,503
He glanced at me as he walked past.
Just a glance.

403
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,506
Nothing more.

404
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:56,975
But I could hardly...

405
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,228
...move.

406
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:11,406
That afternoon...

407
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:17,746
...Helena went to the movies
with her friend...

408
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,627
...and you and I made love.

409
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:31,259
And we made plans about our future...

410
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:36,389
...and we talked about Helena.

411
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,768
And yet...

412
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:43,605
...at no time...

413
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:47,567
...was he ever...

414
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:52,531
...out of my mind.

415
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:02,916
And I thought if he wanted me...

416
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,295
...even if it was only...

417
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,674
...for one night...

418
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,682
...I was ready to give up everything.

419
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,810
You.

420
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,897
Helena.

421
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:32,237
My whole fucking future.

Everything.

423
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:47,043
And yet it was weird,
because at the same time...

424
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,964
...you were dearer to me than ever.

425
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,555
And at that moment, my love for you...

426
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,434
...was both...

427
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:09,941
...tender and sad.

428
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,538
I barely slept that night...

429
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:29,753
...and I woke up the next morning
in a panic.

430
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:35,884
I didn't know whether I was
afraid that he had left...

431
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,722
...or that he might still be there.

432
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:48,271
But by dinner...

433
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:54,778
...I realized he was gone...

434
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:03,411
...and I was...

435
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,414
...relieved.

It's so unreal.

Daddy had such a good day.

465

His mind was clear,
and he remembered so many things.

466
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,531
Then he had a little dinner...

467
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:12,160
...and he said he felt like
taking a nap.

468

I went into the kitchen and talked
to Rosa for half an hour at most...

01:36:59,731 --> 01:37:02,567
...hundreds of them, everywhere.

976
01:37:02,775 --> 01:37:05,320
Everyone was fucking.

977
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:12,702
And then I....

978
01:37:15,788 --> 01:37:18,291
I was fucking other men.

979
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,710
So many...

980
01:37:22,295 --> 01:37:25,131
...I don't know how many I was with.

981
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:33,139
And I knew you could see me
in the arms of all these men...

982
01:37:36,017 --> 01:37:38,895
...just fucking all these men.

983
01:37:43,358 --> 01:37:46,110
I wanted to make fun of you...

984
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:50,239
...to laugh in your face.

985
01:37:53,534 --> 01:37:58,498
And so I laughed as loud as I could.

986
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:15,765
That must have been
when you woke me up.

987
01:39:00,017 --> 01:39:01,477
Shit!

988
01:39:35,595 --> 01:39:37,763
-Hi.
-Hi.

989
01:39:38,556 --> 01:39:40,641
I'll just have a cup of coffee, please.

990
01:39:48,107 --> 01:39:49,358
Anything else?

991
01:39:50,651 --> 01:39:52,403
No, thank you.

992
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:00,620
Excuse me.

993
01:40:01,621 --> 01:40:04,790
Do you know when they get in
next door at the Sonata Café?

994
01:40:04,998 --> 01:40:08,419
I think there's usually someone
in the office around 2 or 3.

995
01:40:12,965 --> 01:40:17,470
I don't suppose, by any chance,
you know Nick Nightingale?

996
01:40:17,678 --> 01:40:20,640
He's playing piano
over there right now.

997
01:40:20,932 --> 01:40:22,433
Nick Nightingale?

998
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:25,436
Sure, he comes in here.

999
01:40:28,272 --> 01:40:31,024
Look, maybe you can help me...

1000
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:34,862
...because it's important that
I get in touch with him.

1001
01:40:36,072 --> 01:40:37,823
Do you know where he's staying?

1002
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:39,659
Well....

1003
01:40:41,494 --> 01:40:44,580
I don't know if he'd want me
to give out his address.

1004
01:40:44,789 --> 01:40:47,166
It's okay, I'm a doctor.

1005
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:49,919
I'm actually an old friend of his.

1006
01:40:51,504 --> 01:40:53,005
Well, doctor...

1007
01:40:55,508 --> 01:40:59,136
...he'll be playing there tonight.
Can't it wait until then?

1008
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:01,973
Listen.

1009
01:41:02,139 --> 01:41:04,057
To be perfectly honest...

1010
01:41:06,352 --> 01:41:08,104
...it's a medical matter.

1011
01:41:08,521 --> 01:41:12,817
Some tests. I know he'll want to
know about them as soon as possible.

1012
01:41:40,011 --> 01:41:41,053
Excuse me.

1013
01:41:42,722 --> 01:41:44,932
Hi! How can I help you?

1014
01:41:45,141 --> 01:41:48,894
Can you please ring
Mr. Nightingale's room for me?

1015
01:41:49,437 --> 01:41:53,065
I'm sorry, sir, Mr. Nightingale
has already checked out.

1016
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:55,651
-He checked out?
-Yes.

1017
01:41:58,904 --> 01:42:02,867
-Did he leave a forwarding address?
-No, I'm afraid not.

1018
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:05,995
When did he check out?

1019
01:42:07,496 --> 01:42:09,457
About 5:00 this morning.

1020
01:42:09,707 --> 01:42:11,042
5:00?

1021
01:42:12,752 --> 01:42:14,670
That's an early checkout, isn't it?

1022
01:42:14,879 --> 01:42:17,673
It is a little on the early side, yeah.

1023
01:42:18,883 --> 01:42:19,967
Look...

1024
01:42:21,761 --> 01:42:24,680
...did you notice anything...

1025
01:42:25,014 --> 01:42:26,474
...I don't know...

1026
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:30,186
...unusual about him when he left?

1027
01:42:32,188 --> 01:42:33,606
Unusual?

1028
01:42:35,191 --> 01:42:37,193
Hey, you're not Five-O, are you?

1029
01:42:38,736 --> 01:42:40,112
No, I'm an old friend of his.

1030
01:42:40,321 --> 01:42:41,447
Really?

1031
01:42:41,906 --> 01:42:43,407
I'm a doctor.

1032
01:42:46,702 --> 01:42:51,040
-Well, Bill...?
-Sure.

1033
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:56,337
It's funny you should
ask that question, Bill...

1034
01:42:56,587 --> 01:42:59,924
...because there was something
a little strange...

1035
01:43:00,132 --> 01:43:02,635
...about the way Mr. Nightingale left.

1036
01:43:02,968 --> 01:43:05,346
Really? What was that?

1037
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:07,723
Well....

1038
01:43:13,521 --> 01:43:18,067
He came in this morning,
about 4:30 a.m...

1039
01:43:18,651 --> 01:43:20,569
...with two men.

1040
01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:23,280
Big guys.

1041
01:43:23,823 --> 01:43:26,784
They were very well-dressed
and very well-spoken.

1042
01:43:26,992 --> 01:43:30,663
But they weren't the kind of people
you'd fool around with...

1043
01:43:30,955 --> 01:43:32,665
...if you know what I mean.

1044
01:43:35,459 --> 01:43:36,961
Anyways...

1045
01:43:38,254 --> 01:43:43,008
...I noticed Mr. Nightingale
had a bruise on his cheek.

1046
01:43:43,759 --> 01:43:48,681
To be perfectly honest, I also
thought he looked a little scared.

1047
01:43:49,682 --> 01:43:50,850
Scared?

1048
01:43:51,142 --> 01:43:52,727
Yes. Yes.

1049
01:43:53,602 --> 01:43:55,228
He said he wanted to check out.

1050
01:43:55,479 --> 01:43:59,358
And then he went upstairs to his room
with one of the men.

1051
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:03,529
The other guy stayed down in the lobby
and settled his bill.

1052
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:08,492
When they came back, Mr. Nightingale
tried to pass me an envelope.

1053
01:44:08,659 --> 01:44:10,369
But they saw it and took it...

1054
01:44:10,619 --> 01:44:13,497
...and said that any mail
or messages for him...

1055
01:44:13,748 --> 01:44:18,294
...would be collected by someone
properly authorized to do so.

1056
01:44:19,128 --> 01:44:21,630
And then they just
took him off in a car.

1057
01:44:22,923 --> 01:44:25,258
Do you have any idea where they went?

1058
01:44:25,676 --> 01:44:27,553
No, not a clue.

1059
01:44:32,641 --> 01:44:33,768
Well....

1060
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:37,270
Anyway....

1061
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:41,859
I certainly appreciate your help.

1062
01:44:42,067 --> 01:44:43,694
Anytime, Bill.

1063
01:44:43,903 --> 01:44:44,945
Bye.

1064
01:45:19,772 --> 01:45:22,358
MILICH:
Oh, the good doctor!

1065
01:45:22,566 --> 01:45:23,901
Mr. Milich.

1066
01:45:24,235 --> 01:45:29,198
-Was your outfit a success?
-Yes, it was. Thank you.

1067
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:31,075
Good, good.

1068
01:45:31,242 --> 01:45:36,247
Tuxedo. Cloak. Shoes.

1069
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:42,586
I think you forgot the mask.

1070
01:45:43,879 --> 01:45:45,381
It's not there?

1071
01:45:46,339 --> 01:45:48,884
Maybe you left it at the party?

1072
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:55,516
I don't think so.

1073
01:45:57,476 --> 01:46:01,021
I must have lost it.
Could you put it on the bill, please?

1074
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:02,273
Sure.

1075
01:46:06,527 --> 01:46:08,404
Here we are.

1076
01:46:09,947 --> 01:46:14,034
That was 150 for the rental,
200 you said for my trouble...

1077
01:46:14,243 --> 01:46:17,705
...25 for the mask. Sorry....

1078
01:46:20,457 --> 01:46:22,126
Three hundred seventy-five.

1079
01:46:24,753 --> 01:46:26,046
Yes, dear?

1080
01:46:26,379 --> 01:46:27,840
Come, come.

1081
01:46:29,133 --> 01:46:32,052
Would you like to say hello
to Dr. Harford?

1082
01:46:33,304 --> 01:46:35,806
-Hello.
-Hello.

1083
01:46:41,353 --> 01:46:44,189
Thank you, Mr. Milich.
I'll call you soon.

1084
01:46:45,149 --> 01:46:47,026
Goodbye, gentlemen.

1085
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:50,571
-Merry Christmas and happy New Year!
MAN: And you too.

1086
01:46:51,530 --> 01:46:53,782
MILICH:
Well, Dr. Harford...

1087
01:46:55,034 --> 01:46:56,660
...here is your receipt.

1088
01:46:57,953 --> 01:47:00,205
I'm tearing up your deposits...

1089
01:47:01,373 --> 01:47:03,709
...and thanks for the business.

1090
01:47:08,297 --> 01:47:11,592
Mr. Milich, last night...

1091
01:47:14,386 --> 01:47:16,805
...you were going to call the police.

1092
01:47:16,972 --> 01:47:22,435
Well, things change.
We have come to another arrangement.

1093
01:47:22,686 --> 01:47:27,608
And by the way, if the good doctor
should ever want anything again...

1094
01:47:28,233 --> 01:47:29,985
...anything at all...

1095
01:47:30,986 --> 01:47:33,530
...it needn't be a costume.

1096
01:47:55,636 --> 01:47:56,971
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

1097
01:48:01,016 --> 01:48:02,267
Come in.

1098
01:48:03,978 --> 01:48:06,730
-Tuna salad and black coffee.
BILL: Thanks.

1099
01:48:07,773 --> 01:48:10,818
Listen, how's my afternoon looking?

1100
01:48:11,026 --> 01:48:15,990
I think it's just Mrs. Akerly at 2:30
and Mrs. Kominski at 4.

1101
01:48:16,365 --> 01:48:20,577
Well, something's come up, and I'm
not going to be able to see them.

1102
01:48:20,828 --> 01:48:24,497
Please ask Dr. Miller if he can fit
them in. Otherwise, just apologize...

1103
01:48:24,748 --> 01:48:26,625
-...and make new appointments.
-Sure.

1104
01:48:27,084 --> 01:48:31,171
And please call the garage and have
them get my car out in half an hour.

1105
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:32,756
SECRETARY:
No problem.

1106
01:52:14,727 --> 01:52:15,812
ALICE:
Hi.

1107
01:52:16,063 --> 01:52:17,730
HELENA:
Hi, Daddy.

1108
01:52:18,731 --> 01:52:20,025
BILL:
Hi.

1109
01:52:22,486 --> 01:52:25,155
Any calls for me?

1110
01:52:25,364 --> 01:52:29,326
ALICE:
Dr. Sanders and Mrs. Shapiro.

1111
01:52:30,619 --> 01:52:33,080
BILL: Hey, gang.
-Hi, Daddy.

1112
01:52:33,997 --> 01:52:35,916
Look, I got all these right.

1113
01:52:36,124 --> 01:52:38,126
You got all of those right?

1114
01:52:38,669 --> 01:52:40,420
Every single one of them?

1115
01:52:40,796 --> 01:52:42,089
That's good.

1116
01:52:42,297 --> 01:52:43,882
You hungry?

1117
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:46,301
Sort of.

1118
01:52:46,510 --> 01:52:48,303
Want to eat at 7?

1119
01:52:48,512 --> 01:52:50,847
Seven? Listen, can we
make that earlier?

1120
01:52:51,056 --> 01:52:55,018
I have some appointments
at the office.

1121
01:52:55,227 --> 01:52:57,271
You have to go out again tonight?

1122
01:52:57,479 --> 01:52:58,522
I'm afraid so.

1123
01:52:58,689 --> 01:53:02,192
Daddy, am I gonna get
a puppy for Christmas?

1124
01:53:02,818 --> 01:53:05,279
We'll see about that, okay?

1125
01:53:07,864 --> 01:53:09,950
HELENA:
He could be a watchdog.

1126
01:53:10,158 --> 01:53:11,660
We'll see.

1127
01:53:11,868 --> 01:53:14,621
ALICE:
Come on, baby, let's finish this off.

1128
01:53:14,830 --> 01:53:18,458
All right, we have Joe.
And Joe has $2.50.

1129
01:53:18,667 --> 01:53:23,297
And Mike has $1.75.

1130
01:53:23,547 --> 01:53:27,175
Joe has how much more money than Mike?

1131
01:53:27,384 --> 01:53:29,720
HELENA:
$0.75?

1132
01:53:31,638 --> 01:53:35,058
ALICE: So is it gonna be
a subtraction or an addition?

1133

And it didn't take much to
figure out the rest.

1278
02:14:54,461 --> 02:14:56,338
It wasn't Nick's fault.

1279
02:14:58,090 --> 02:14:59,633
It was mine.

1280
02:15:00,092 --> 02:15:02,094
Of course it was Nick's fault.

1281
02:15:02,469 --> 02:15:05,973
If he hadn't mentioned it to you,
none of this would've happened.

I recommended that cocksucker
to those people...

02:15:09,101 --> 02:15:12,062
...and he's made me look like

02:15:30,873 --> 02:15:32,416
...absolutely...

02:15:33,375 --> 02:15:38,005
...no idea you were involved
in any way.

I know you didn't, Bill.

02:15:56,273 --> 02:15:58,317
Because I had you followed.

1295
02:16:04,239 --> 02:16:05,949
You had me followed?

1296
02:16:08,327 --> 02:16:10,663
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

1297
02:16:11,038 --> 02:16:12,956
All right? I owe you an apology.

1298
02:16:13,165 --> 02:16:15,918
This was for your own good, believe me.

1299
02:16:16,293 --> 02:16:20,297
I know what the desk clerk told you.
But what he didn't tell you is...

1300
02:16:20,547 --> 02:16:23,759
...all they did was
put Nick on a plane to Seattle.

1301
02:16:24,134 --> 02:16:27,930
By now he's probably back
with his family...

1302
02:16:28,472 --> 02:16:30,432
...banging Mrs. Nick.

1303
02:16:31,725 --> 02:16:34,978
The clerk said
he had a bruise on his face.

1304
02:16:37,064 --> 02:16:40,234
Okay, he had a bruise on his face.

1305
02:16:41,318 --> 02:16:44,279
That's a hell of a lot less
than he deserves.

1306
02:16:45,114 --> 02:16:49,243
I don't think you realize what
kind of trouble you were in last night.

1307
02:16:50,661 --> 02:16:52,788
Who do you think those people were?

1308
02:16:53,455 --> 02:16:55,582
Those were not just
ordinary people there.

1309
02:16:55,791 --> 02:16:59,128
If I told you their names--
I'm not gonna tell you their names...

1310
02:16:59,336 --> 02:17:03,090
...but if I did,
I don't think you'd sleep so well.

1311
02:17:06,719 --> 02:17:08,846
Was it the second password?

1312
02:17:10,222 --> 02:17:11,974
Is that what gave me away?

1313
02:17:14,101 --> 02:17:16,353
Yes, finally.

1314
02:17:18,480 --> 02:17:20,774
But not because you didn't know it.

1315
02:17:22,693 --> 02:17:25,612
It's because there was
no second password.

1316
02:17:26,822 --> 02:17:31,326
Of course it didn't help a whole lot
that those people arrive in limos...

1317
02:17:31,535 --> 02:17:34,037
...and you showed up in a taxi.

1318
02:17:34,288 --> 02:17:38,000
Or that they found the receipt from
the rental house in your coat...

1319
02:17:38,208 --> 02:17:41,336
...made out to you-know-who.

1320
02:17:50,721 --> 02:17:52,347
There was a....

1321
02:17:56,393 --> 02:17:58,103
There was a....

1322
02:17:59,062 --> 02:18:02,524
There was a woman there...

1323
02:18:08,322 --> 02:18:10,115
...who tried to warn me.

1324
02:18:15,788 --> 02:18:17,039
I know.

1325
02:18:22,795 --> 02:18:24,546
Do you know who she was?

1326
02:18:29,885 --> 02:18:31,053
Yes.

1327
02:18:38,560 --> 02:18:40,270
She was a hooker.

1328
02:18:49,822 --> 02:18:51,490
Sorry, but...

1329
02:18:52,658 --> 02:18:54,660
...that's what she was.

1330
02:18:59,081 --> 02:19:00,249
A hooker.

1331
02:19:09,883 --> 02:19:11,093
Bill...

1332
02:19:15,097 --> 02:19:17,599
...suppose I told you...

1333
02:19:19,226 --> 02:19:22,145
...that everything that
happened to you there...

1334
02:19:23,647 --> 02:19:27,776
...the threats, the girl's warnings...

1335
02:19:27,985 --> 02:19:30,737
...her last-minute intervention...

1336
02:19:30,946 --> 02:19:34,741
...suppose I said that all of that...

1337
02:19:36,118 --> 02:19:38,787
...was staged.

1338
02:19:40,914 --> 02:19:44,793
That it was a kind of charade.

1339
02:19:46,378 --> 02:19:48,338
That it was fake.

1340
02:19:52,926 --> 02:19:54,303
Fake?

1341
02:19:56,054 --> 02:19:58,640
Yes. Fake.

1342
02:20:10,152 --> 02:20:12,070
Why would they do that?

1343
02:20:12,905 --> 02:20:14,156
Why?

1344
02:20:15,449 --> 02:20:17,159
In plain words...

1345
02:20:18,035 --> 02:20:20,579
...to scare the living shit out of you.

1346
02:20:21,747 --> 02:20:25,167
To keep you quiet
about where you'd been...

1347
02:20:25,667 --> 02:20:27,377
...and what you'd seen.

1348
02:20:47,481 --> 02:20:49,066
Have you seen this?

1349
02:21:06,416 --> 02:21:08,418
Yes, I have.

1350
02:21:13,882 --> 02:21:17,010
I saw her body in the morgue.

1351
02:21:21,515 --> 02:21:22,975
Was she...?

1352
02:21:25,811 --> 02:21:29,022
Was she the woman at the party?

1353
02:21:36,863 --> 02:21:38,115
Yes.

1354
02:21:41,326 --> 02:21:42,786
She was.

1355
02:21:53,630 --> 02:21:54,965
Victor...

1356
02:21:57,050 --> 02:21:59,636
...the woman lying dead in the morgue...

1357
02:22:01,638 --> 02:22:03,515
...was the woman at the party.

1358
02:22:05,934 --> 02:22:07,102
Yes.

1359
02:22:12,190 --> 02:22:17,070
Well, Victor, maybe I'm
missing something here.

1360
02:22:17,946 --> 02:22:21,450
You called it a fake, a charade.

1361
02:22:23,076 --> 02:22:26,455
Do you mind telling me
what kind of fucking charade...

1362
02:22:26,705 --> 02:22:30,542
...ends with somebody turning up dead?

1363
02:22:36,465 --> 02:22:41,094
Okay, Bill, let's cut the bullshit.
All right?

1364
02:22:41,303 --> 02:22:44,097
You've been way out of your depth
for the last 24 hours.

1365
02:22:44,347 --> 02:22:47,809
You want to know what kind of charade?
I'll tell you exactly what kind.

1366
02:22:49,061 --> 02:22:52,731
That whole play-acted,
"take me" phony sacrifice...

1367
02:22:52,939 --> 02:22:57,527
...that you've been jerking off with
had nothing to do with her real death.

1368
02:22:57,736 --> 02:23:01,364
Nothing happened after you left
that hadn't happened to her before.

1369
02:23:01,573 --> 02:23:04,618
She got her brains fucked out. Period.

1370
02:23:06,036 --> 02:23:10,457
When they took her home,
she was just fine...

1371
02:23:11,083 --> 02:23:12,834
...and the rest is in the paper.

1372
02:23:13,001 --> 02:23:16,713
She was a junkie. She OD'd.
There was nothing suspicious.

1373
02:23:16,922 --> 02:23:21,134
Her door was locked from the inside.
The police are happy. End of story.

1374
02:23:22,511 --> 02:23:27,474
Come on. It was always gonna be
just a matter of time with her.

1375
02:23:27,849 --> 02:23:29,476
Remember, you told her so yourself.

1376
02:23:29,684 --> 02:23:33,563
You remember, the one with the
great tits who OD'd in my bathroom?

1377
02:23:50,455 --> 02:23:54,584
Listen, Bill, nobody killed anybody.

1378
02:23:55,001 --> 02:23:57,671
Someone died. It happens all the time.

1379
02:23:59,131 --> 02:24:01,466
But life goes on.

1380
02:24:01,883 --> 02:24:03,301
It always does...

1381
02:24:03,552 --> 02:24:05,011
...until it doesn't.

1382
02:24:06,638 --> 02:24:08,515
But you know that, don't you?

1383
02:27:33,178 --> 02:27:35,680
I'll tell you everything.

1384
02:27:41,102 --> 02:27:43,396
I'll tell you everything.

1385
02:28:35,240 --> 02:28:37,450
Helena's gonna be up soon.

1386
02:28:54,342 --> 02:28:58,680
She's expecting us to
take her Christmas shopping today.

1387
02:29:23,413 --> 02:29:24,497
That's nice.

1388
02:29:24,747 --> 02:29:27,333
I could put Sabrina in here.

1389
02:29:28,084 --> 02:29:30,503
It's really pretty.

1390
02:29:30,712 --> 02:29:32,714
It's old-fashioned.

1391
02:29:41,848 --> 02:29:43,099
He's big.

1392
02:29:43,308 --> 02:29:46,728
I hope Santa Claus gets me
one of these for Christmas.

1393
02:29:46,936 --> 02:29:48,229
You do?

1394
02:29:50,523 --> 02:29:52,734
Well, you're gonna
have to wait and see.

1395
02:29:58,740 --> 02:29:59,866
Alice?

1396
02:30:06,873 --> 02:30:08,917
What do you think we should do?

1397
02:30:14,088 --> 02:30:15,548
What do I think we should do?

1398
02:30:15,798 --> 02:30:17,091
HELENA:
Look, Mommy!

1399
02:30:26,434 --> 02:30:29,103
What do I think?
I don't know.

1400
02:30:31,272 --> 02:30:33,066
I mean, maybe....

1401
02:30:45,078 --> 02:30:48,581
Maybe I think...

1402
02:30:49,290 --> 02:30:51,626
...we should be grateful.

1403
02:30:57,632 --> 02:30:59,217
Grateful...

1404
02:30:59,801 --> 02:31:04,806
...that we've managed to
survive through all of our...

1405
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:07,350
...adventures...

1406
02:31:09,811 --> 02:31:12,146
...whether they were real...

1407
02:31:12,647 --> 02:31:14,899
...or only a dream.

1408
02:31:24,158 --> 02:31:27,996
Are you sure of that?

1409
02:31:31,916 --> 02:31:33,543
Am I sure?

1410
02:31:49,350 --> 02:31:51,102
Only as sure as I am...

1411
02:31:51,352 --> 02:31:55,189
...that the reality of one night...

1412
02:31:56,482 --> 02:31:59,360
...let alone that of a whole lifetime...

1413
02:32:01,863 --> 02:32:04,282
...can ever be the whole truth.

1414
02:32:11,039 --> 02:32:13,041
And no dream is ever...

1415
02:32:14,917 --> 02:32:16,711
...just a dream.

1416
02:32:25,178 --> 02:32:27,263
The important thing is...

1417
02:32:29,140 --> 02:32:30,892
...we're awake now...

1418
02:32:32,185 --> 02:32:34,520
...and hopefully...

1419
02:32:37,565 --> 02:32:39,776
...for a long time to come.

1420
02:32:43,446 --> 02:32:44,947
Forever.

1421
02:32:47,116 --> 02:32:48,576
Forever?

1422
02:32:50,912 --> 02:32:52,413
Forever.

1423
02:32:54,791 --> 02:32:58,419
Let's not use that word. You know?

1424
02:32:59,754 --> 02:33:01,714
It frightens me.

1425
02:33:11,974 --> 02:33:15,103
But I do love you...

1426
02:33:18,231 --> 02:33:19,941
...and you know...

1427
02:33:21,067 --> 02:33:23,236
...there is something very important...

1428
02:33:23,486 --> 02:33:26,197
...that we need
to do as soon as possible.

1429
02:33:27,532 --> 02:33:28,825
What's that?

1430
02:33:31,994 --> 02:33:33,454
Fuck.
