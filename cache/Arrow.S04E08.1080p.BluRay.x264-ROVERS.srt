1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,446
Previously on Arrow and Flash...

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,926
- Thanks, mister.
- Yeah.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,923
Barry said that you need our help.
Somebody very dangerous is after you.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,208
Give her to me
and I'll make your death fast.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,801
The man you're looking for
is Vandal Savage.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,286
An Immortal.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,485
Chay-Ara, it's me, Khufu.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,286
We're drawn to each other in each life,
and after we die, we reincarnate.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,686
Do you know who Vandal Savage is?

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,450
In every lifetime, he hunts us down.

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,126
<i>We think he's trying
to locate the Staff of Horus.</i>

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,800
I'm never gonna become
who I really am unless I let go.

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,880
No!

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,326
<i>Shay-Ara...</i>

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,364
Prince Khufu, my son,
what have you come to offer?

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,362
Father, we bring this tribute to the
protector of all we see and know, Horus.

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,801
Praise be upon him.

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,328
It is a fine offering, Khufu,
a feast worthy of a god.

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,087
And yet, Priestess Chay-Ara
does not seem to agree.

20
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,245
Your offering is lovely, my prince.
If not a bit naive.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,766
Naive?

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,725
To think that Horus would
be appeased by trifles.

23
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,564
The portents of his dissatisfaction
grow with each passing day.

24
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,367
The celestial rocks used to fall
once a generation.

25
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,443
Now they strike
with each phase of the moon.

26
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,003
I thought it was your job to keep
Horus in a good mood, Priestess.

27
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,122
Priestess Chay-Ara only speaks
out of concern for all.

28
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,122
Otherwise, she would remain
a bit more polite.

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,401
We have warned you, time and again,
of the sky rocks and the threat they pose

30
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,242
to the court of Ramesses the Wise.
Dark times are coming, my pharaoh.

31
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,883
Prayers and trifles will not
be enough to stop them.

32
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,570
Priestess!
You spoke with quite the tongue in there.

33
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,405
Did I over-act?

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,722
No. I love your tongue.

35
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,726
You Okay?

36
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,882
Yeah. I'm fine. I just have a headache.

37
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,801
Are you sure? Usually, that's a sign
of your memories returning.

38
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,921
Yeah, I'm sure.
I can't remember anything yet.

39
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,569
A bunch of superheroes in a farmhouse?

40
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,640
Feel like I've seen that
in a movie before.

41
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,251
We need a secure location.

42
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,401
What's wrong with S.T.A.R. Labs?

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,840
Well, I mean, absolutely nothing,

44
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,764
if you forget about
the revolving door you guys installed

45
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,610
so the bad guys can
come and go as they please.

46
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,768
Remind me again
what happened to your old lair?

47
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,961
Or the one before that?

48
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,771
Well, lair number one was
compromised by the police.

49
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,487
And I will stop helping.

50
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,127
Savage only let Barry
and I live because he felt Kendra

51
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,203
start to emerge as Hawkgirl
and went after her.

52
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,124
He can sense her and Carter's presence.

53
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,521
We don't need to make it easier
on him by staying in the city limits.

54
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,683
Bet you wish you stayed at
your mother's place now.

55
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,330
We need to find a way to neutralize
Savage's advantage. Barry, you're late.

56
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,444
Sorry. it turns out it's not easy
finding the ass-end of nowhere.

57
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,451
Yeah, for real. The roaming charges alone
are going to bankrupt me.

58
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,842
We're discussing how to take away
Savage's new-found power.

59
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,326
His magic stick thing.

60
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,801
Uh, Staff of Horus.

61
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,450
Well, it's protected by
some kind of energy field.

62
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,842
- I couldn't lay a finger on it.
- Maybe wear mittens next time.

63
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,008
What if we made some sort of
insulated gauntlets?

64
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,647
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The magnetic shielding could disrupt the...

65
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,643
- Staff's magnetic polarity.
- Yeah.

66
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,848
- Well, while the geek squad works...
<i>- Heard that,</i> honey.

67
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,804
While they work to get
the staff away from Savage,

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,048
we need to know everything
there is to know about him.

69
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,570
Well, I googled "reincarnated nutjobs"
and came up with nothing.

70
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,003
Uh, Kendra and I would be the reincarnated
nutjobs. Savage is merely immortal.

71
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,248
- Merely?
- Welcome to the new normal.

72
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,323
Anyone who's been around
for 4,000 years should leave a trail.

73
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,363
I'll check with A.R.G.U.S.
See if they have anything on him.

74
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,767
Uh, Laurel and I can check
police reports and stuff like that.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,243
Good. We need to find a way to
utilize your new ability.

76
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,488
- My ability?
- It might give us an advantage.

77
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,563
Yeah. Whatever you do,
don't let him train you.

78
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,764
I'm sorry, but when it rains, I can still
feel where you shot me with those arrows.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,331
I'll handle her training then.

80
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,369
- Yeah.
- Oliver.

81
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,410
I need to run something down.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

82
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,242
And what exactly are you running down?

83
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,441
Don't worry. It's nothing dangerous.

84
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,920
Well, are you okay?

85
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,444
Well, we're up against an immortal madman
armed with a magical staff,

86
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,205
so I do have a few things on my mind.

87
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,688
Yeah, but you were acting fine
with everything while we were home.

88
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,726
And now that we're here in Central City,
you've just been not you.

89
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,929
Well, maybe it's too bright
and sunny for me here.

90
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,882
There is something going on,
and I'm going to tell you all about it.

91
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,204
I would just like the chance to know
what I'm dealing with first.

92
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,801
Okay.

93
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,246
Okay.

94
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,246
Hey! You must be going
through a lot right now.

95
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,728
Yeah. You know, we should talk.

96
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,086
Never in the history of romance have those
words ever meant anything good.

97
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,244
I just mean we should probably talk
about everything that's happened.

98
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,647
That's happening.

99
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,884
You know what? I'm gonna suggest something
radical here and say let's not talk.

100
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,963
Look, you got a lot
on your plate right now,

101
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,447
and I just don't want to be that piece
of very nutritious broccoli

102
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,290
that you scrape off the plate
to give to the dog.

103
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,406
My point being, I don't think you can
afford to be distracted right now.

104
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,481
Let's go.

105
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,409
Yes. Let's.

106
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,610
Sorry, buddy. This is private.

107
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,970
- Private?
- Yep.

108
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,929
I'm just gonna go do some
push-ups over there.

109
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,606
Open it.

110
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,962
Why? What's inside?

111
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,080
Something we have to track down
in each of our incarnations.

112
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,601
Sometimes, I find it.

113
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,689
Sometimes, you find me
and we go look for it together.

114
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,285
Four thousand years, 206 lives, we've seen
about every combination there is.

115
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,961
I don't think I'm really...

116
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,964
Ready for this.
You say that in every lifetime.

117
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,161
Look, as you emerge, as your memories
come back to you, so will other things.

118
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,726
Skills. Languages.
Pieces of your prior lives.

119
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,406
There you go.

120
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,685
Oh, this is nuts.

121
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,247
It's okay. I'll help you through it.

122
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,881
Yeah, well, the last time you "helped" me,
I got pushed off a building.

123
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,521
Yes, and after that, you, uh,
you soared, if I remember correctly.

124
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,484
And that is because
anger, fear, adrenaline,

125
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,047
those are the things
that bring out the warrior within.

126
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,209
Well, according to Savage,
I'm a priestess.

127
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,486
The clergy were warriors. Warrior priests.

128
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,571
And that is the side that you
need to remember.

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,490
And if I can't?

130
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,564
Well, then we'll, uh,
both probably die. Again.

131
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,170
- SAMANTHAI Today?
- WILLIAMI Yeah.

132
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,880
- All right, let's not be late.
- Okay.

133
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,126
Thank you.

134
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,366
Oliver?

135
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,051
Hi.

136
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,130
Uh, hold on one second.
What are you doing here?

137
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,409
I'm so sorry to just drop by unannounced.

138
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,564
I came to town the other day,
and I saw, I saw you with your son.

139
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,241
William.

140
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,727
William? That's a nice name.

141
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,451
Oliver, what are you doing at my house?

142
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,081
I saw you and William together, and I...

143
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,204
It's difficult
not to wonder because...

144
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,566
He's what, nine? And, you know,
we had our thing 10 years ago.

145
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,285
- Okay, let me stop you right there.
- All right.

146
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,042
William isn't yours.
I told you, I lost our baby, Oliver.

147
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,561
Yes.

148
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,122
And I met William's father two months
after moving to Central City, so...

149
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,409
Mom, we're gonna miss the game!

150
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,443
- I'm sorry. I have to go.
- No, go.

151
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,006
Okay.

152
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,646
Oh!

153
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,126
Here you are.

154
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,160
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

155
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,731
Wish William good luck for me, all right?

156
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,320
I will.

157
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,251
Now is not a good time, Malcolm.

158
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,484
I've arranged a meeting with
Vandal Savage. You, me and the speedster.

159
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,450
What? Wait, why...

160
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,690
Because negotiation is the only
way out of this situation, Oliver.

161
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,448
Savage is going to decimate
Central City to get what he wants.

162
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,922
If your child were here,
you would understand.

163
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,607
<i>Suit up. I've already spoke with
fleet feet. He's on his way.</i>

164
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,489
Thank you for coming.
I know this is more than a little crazy.

165
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,724
Yeah. Well, your friend with
the creepy ring asked so nicely.

166
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,049
Please tell me we're not going to
negotiate with terrorists.

167
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,290
Or, you know, 4,000-year-old bad guys.

168
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,170
Just think of this more
as a fact-finding mission.

169
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,890
Maybe Savage slips up
and gives us something

170
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,360
that we can use to our advantage.

171
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,007
Thea said you were being
a little bit more humorous lately.

172
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,641
I'm sorry. How do you know
so much about Savage, anyway?

173
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,207
I don't know anything about him,
Mr. Allen. No one does.

174
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,165
That is why I'm afraid of him.

175
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,167
That's not the only reason to be
afraid of me. I assure you.

176
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,328
- Thank you for joining me.
- What do you want?

177
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,888
What all living things want. Not to die.

178
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,003
I thought that wasn't a problem for you.

179
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,602
Only if I take the life force from
Prince Khufu and Priestess Chay-Ara.

180
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,240
Kendra and Carter.

181
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,401
The three of us are locked in a vicious
circle played out over thousands of years.

182
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,771
None of your concern.

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,240
We've made it our concern.

184
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,730
Robin of Locksley.
I taught him how to use a bow.

185
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:18,247
He taught me how to not feel pain.
I'm the enemy you can't defeat.

186
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,771
The only way for you
and yours to live through this

187
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,042
is to render unto me what is mine.

188
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,487
Turn over Prince Khufu and
Priestess Chay-Ara within 24 hours,

189
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,964
or I will lay waste to this city,
killing everyone that you hold dear.

190
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,601
And after that, I will travel to
your home and do the same thing there.

191
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,042
All right, I'm just curious, did you
rehearse that speech in a mirror

192
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,282
this morning or is this all
just off the cuff?

193
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,723
Why would you risk the lives of
your friends and family for two strangers?

194
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,324
Two hundred and six times
I have killed them.

195
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,403
What hubris possesses you that makes you
think that you can prevent me

196
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,090
from doing so again?

197
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,162
Nothubfls.Hope.

198
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,243
I came to this meeting out of curiosity.
It is now sated.

199
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,163
Bring Khufu and Chay-Ara
to Jurgens Industrial in 24 hours

200
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,684
or I will see you dead and buried
under the bodies of your loved ones.

201
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,929
We're not giving up Kendra and Carter.

202
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,451
That's not your decision to make.

203
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,371
This is a cycle that has played out
for the last 4,000 years.

204
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,649
Savage may be immortal,
but he isn't a god.

205
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,446
- No. But he's the next best thing. Oliver.
- What?

206
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,964
You better be certain that
your stubbornness

207
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,531
does not get my daughter killed.

208
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,969
Because if that happens,
I will come for you,

209
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,881
and in a way that will make you beg
for the likes of Vandal Savage.

210
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,280
<i>Twenty-four hours.</i>

211
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,721
Until what?

212
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,203
Until we are supposed to hand you
and Carter over to Savage or...

213
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,006
- Savage lays waste to Central City.
- Yep.

214
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,851
We've been through this before.
1887, The Huang He flood,

215
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,520
Savage killed nearly two million people
to get to us. And he did.

216
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,564
We weren't helping you then. We are now.

217
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,484
We have 24 hours to come up
with a workable plan.

218
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,407
No, this is insane. My life isn't worth
millions of people's lives.

219
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,246
- Kendra... I'll talk to her.
- Yeah.

220
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,801
Hey, I got this.

221
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,331
I said I'll talk to her.

222
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,762
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't we just
toss him over to Vandal Savage?

223
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,001
- Where were you?
- Hey.

224
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,845
You missed the whole save the city
or turn my girlfriend over

225
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,485
to an immortal psychopath briefing.

226
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,441
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Um, dude,
I... Last night, I, um, I ghosted.

227
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,841
No.

228
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,729
- Yeah. I think I'm gonna...
- Don't say it.

229
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,730
- I think I'm going to time jump...
- I just told you not to say it!

230
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,365
I'm sorry. I don't know what else
I'm supposed to do.

231
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,006
Barry, the first rule of time travel is
you don't talk about time travel!

232
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,242
Because by having this conversation,
we're screwing history.

233
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,602
Look, I know that time travel
has consequences.

234
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,205
I mean, the last time you vibed...

235
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,126
Well, I'm not vibing anything right now.
Okay, urn, all right, look, don't panic.

236
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,408
A, you don't know that you
time-jumped for a bad reason.

237
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,285
It could have been a good one, right?
B, now that you know you time-jumped,

238
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,208
you might not do it, right? So, knowing
the future might change the present,

239
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,363
which might change the future.

240
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,040
What?

241
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,805
My head hurts.

242
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,247
Chay-Ara! Sorry. Kendra.
You shouldn't run off.

243
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,881
- We don't know if Savage is...
- Do we ever kill ourselves?

244
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,441
Excuse me?

245
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,042
In our prior lives. Savage has to kill us
in order to live forever.

246
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,647
Do we ever kill ourselves
in order to deny him that?

247
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,404
You know, in our past lives, I'm typically
the one that makes the plans.

248
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,490
And I'm starting to think
this is probably why.

249
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,082
Everyone in there is willing
to die to protect us.

250
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,568
You don't think that's
a little bit insane?

251
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,840
No. I think it's noble.
I think it's what makes them all heroes.

252
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,164
Yeah, well, heroes or not,
I'm not letting anyone die for me.

253
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,926
Then don't.

254
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,165
Be the person, the woman,
the warrior you were meant to be.

255
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,844
The one you always have been.

256
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,449
- Come at me.
- What?

257
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,524
Hit me or, or try to.

258
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,489
Yeah, well, as much as
I'd like to do that,

259
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,808
I'm really not in the mood right now.

260
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,810
Oh, really? Well, I'll just tell Savage
to come back when you are.

261
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,886
Again.

262
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,846
Again.

263
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,124
Good. Do you feel that? The rage?
That's the key, Kendra.

264
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,723
<i>It's the only way of finding
the warrior within.</i>

265
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,200
Hey.

266
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,964
Sorry to interrupt the weirdness.

267
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,164
Um, John, Laurel and Thea are back,
and they've got something.

268
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,486
Where are Oliver and Barry?

269
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,250
Oliver's back in secret-keeping mode,
apparently.

270
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,370
Barry, I don't know. Caitlin and Cisco
are working on the anti-Staff gauntlets.

271
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,925
What do you guys have?

272
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,040
Betamax. Aw. Where'd you get this?
Off of eBay?

273
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,321
Lyla hooked us up.

274
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,561
Yeah, well, it's gonna
take a while to play,

275
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,046
since we live in a digital world now.

276
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,041
The tape came from a conspiracy theory
group that's interested in Savage.

277
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,765
The Pentagon had a file
on Savage back in '86,

278
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,604
but it's all been heavily redacted.

279
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,046
Got it.

280
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,770
<i>Is this on? I hope so.
My name is Dr. Aldus Boardman.</i>

281
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,849
<i>I'm a professor at St. Roch University.
The date is April 8th, 1975.</i>

282
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,209
<i>I don't think anyone else knows this.
And those that do don't believe.</i>

283
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,046
<i>He's a myth. An urban legend.</i>

284
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,564
<i>He's been compared to Machiavelli and
Nostradamus. He's gone by many names.</i>

285
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,523
<i>But I know him as Vandal Savage,
and he will be the death of the world.</i>

286
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,290
<i>But I believe there is a way to stop him.</i>

287
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,207
<i>Savage is an immortal Egyptian priest.</i>

288
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,362
<i>His long life is the result
of an unearthly calamity.</i>

289
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,329
<i>I believe that any object associated
with this calamity should be able to</i>

290
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,562
<i>undo its effects and kill him.</i>

291
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,251
<i>And I suspect that our precious,
fragile world may one day depend upon us</i>

292
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,766
<i>doing so.</i>

293
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,484
Well, that's the understatement
of the year.

294
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,085
Or, you know, the last 4,000 years.

295
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,404
You have any idea what he meant
by these objects? This calamity?

296
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,768
No, I don't recall a calamity.

297
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,083
- The staff.
- The Staff of Horus?

298
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,563
Yes. I think the staff belonged
to Savage back in ancient Egypt.

299
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,560
You remember?

300
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,330
It's a hunch.

301
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,602
And if Professor Boardman's
guess is right,

302
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,848
that staff is how we kill Savage.

303
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,682
Okay, someone needs to inform
Oliver and Barry.

304
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,371
Okay. Here you go.
I gene-sequenced the hair strand

305
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,125
with the blood sample you gave me.

306
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,364
Still not sure what it has to do with
Damien Darhk, but the Y chromosomes match.

307
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,445
Are you okay?

308
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,520
Thanks for this. It's a big help.

309
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,000
Yeah. You're wel...

310
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,046
- Barry.
- Yeah?

311
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,884
Don't tell anyone about this.

312
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,523
All right.
I'd like to know what's going on here.

313
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,040
- Felicity...
- Yes, I tracked you down.

314
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,282
I find people for a living.
Actually, I don't get paid...

315
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,811
What was that?

316
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,681
What was what?

317
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,211
You just super-speeded
something into your pocket.

318
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,647
Oh. Um, no, nothing.

319
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,169
Um, well, actually, it's, um, it's
something Oliver wanted me to track down.

320
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,642
- It's about Damien Darhk, I think.
- I want to see it.

321
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,046
Why?

322
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,481
Because you don't want me to see it.

323
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,728
- I'm sorry. Oliver specifically asked me...
- Show me.

324
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,204
Okay. I don't know what the big deal is.
It's just a DNA test.

325
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,366
No, it's not.

326
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,369
Honey, why don't you finish that inside?

327
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,244
Mom, Flash hasn't saved the city yet.

328
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,845
Now, honey.

329
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,686
Can we talk?

330
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,082
Look, I don't know what you're trying
to accomplish here, Oliver.

331
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,685
I know, Samantha.

332
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,003
I know that William is my son.

333
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,089
- Okay.
- Why didn't you tell me?

334
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,048
Okay, just keep your voice down.
Your mother told me not to.

335
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,600
What?

336
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,089
She offered me a million dollars
to tell you that I miscarried.

337
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,370
My mother was a complicated person,
but she would never do that.

338
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,210
Wait here.

339
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,486
Here.

340
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,726
Inevercashedit

341
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,249
I didn't need her money to know
I didn't want her anywhere near my child.

342
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,891
Or me anywhere near him.

343
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,130
So, what? He can be just like his dad?

344
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,609
Punching out paparazzi and
getting young girls knocked up?

345
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,484
Samantha, I'm not that person anymore.

346
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,441
I know. I know you're running for mayor.
Your mother was killed.

347
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,722
Your friend Tommy.
You're a different person now,

348
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,282
but can you really tell me
that your life is any less crazy?

349
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,762
Can you honestly say
that William isn't better off

350
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,161
with your world kept away from his?

351
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,411
You know, you're right. I'm being selfish,
but I want an opportunity

352
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,081
to get to know my son.
And I think that a young boy deserves

353
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,322
the opportunity to get to know his father.

354
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,128
Look, he's happy. He's well-adjusted.
I don't want to run the risk of him

355
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,602
getting sucked into your orbit.
That can't happen.

356
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,131
Which means that he can't know that
you're his father. And nobody else can.

357
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,363
I don't care if that sounds harsh.
I'm his mother,

358
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,810
and I will do whatever
I feel I have to do to protect him.

359
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,049
Samantha, there is someone in my life now.
Please, don't make me keep this from her.

360
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,205
Oliver, you will if you want
a relationship with my son.

361
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,282
These are my conditions.
You've already asked the world of me.

362
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,647
I'm just asking for the same in return.

363
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,526
Everyone's waiting for you.

364
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,803
Sorry, just something
I had to take care of.

365
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,646
So I guess you're off
the secret-keeping wagon.

366
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,162
- That's not it.
- Then what is it?

367
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,202
I think Damien Darhk has
someone operating in Central City.

368
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,570
So I sent Barry to run down a lead.

369
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,810
This kind of lead?

370
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,011
He didn't know what he was giving me.

371
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,369
But I've run enough tests on your blood
to recognize your DNA sequence anywhere.

372
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,687
You don't know...

373
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,486
You had him run
a paternity test, didn't you?

374
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,330
- Look, Felicity...
- Stop!

375
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,524
I cannot hear another lie!

376
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,841
- It's more complicated than that.
- God, Oliver,

377
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,003
you are the only person on this planet

378
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,362
who considers the truth "complicated."

379
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,764
Just to be clear,
I don't care that you have a child,

380
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,731
I can't believe that you have a child
that you didn't tell me about.

381
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,849
I care that you lied to me just now.

382
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,606
Do you know that my whole world
just exploded?

383
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,524
And I think that I'm entitled to a minute
to process that by myself.

384
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,724
You somehow managed to go
to C.C.P.D. and track down Barry.

385
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,130
You didn't keep it to yourself.
You kept it from me.

386
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,725
When were you planning on telling me?

387
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,360
I don't know.

388
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,811
If you loved me, if you trusted me,
telling me this wouldn't be such a burden.

389
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:47,410
It would be a relief.
But you don't trust me.

390
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,644
You never will.

391
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,486
And how can I be with someone
who doesn't trust me?

392
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,446
Felicity...

393
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,004
Are you guys Okay?

394
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,605
Oliver? What happened?

395
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,320
Nothing. I'm fine.

396
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,847
Are you sure? I mean, you don't seem fine.
You seem out of it.

397
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,605
Is everyone inside?

398
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,406
Yeah.

399
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,969
We're coming up on Savage's deadline.

400
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,161
Where's Felicity?

401
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,771
- Are the gauntlets working?
- They're gonna have to be.

402
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,160
- We're out of time.
- I think they'll work.

403
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,762
<i>That staff's</i> gonna <i>go from
Can't Touch This</i> to <i>Invisible Touch.</i>

404
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,602
Savage doesn't know
Kendra has access to her full abilities,

405
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,331
which makes you our ace in the hole.
We're gonna put you up against Savage.

406
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,046
You attack with the element of surprise.
I will lay down cover fire.

407
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,327
Barry, you speed in and...

408
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,602
- Snatch the staff. I got it.
- Where do you need us?

409
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,809
This is me, Barry, Kendra and Carter.
We've got it.

410
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,047
- Ollie!
- No. We're not risking any more

411
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,123
lives tonight than we have to.

412
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,566
Suit up.

413
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,329
You brought them.
And dressed for the occasion, I see.

414
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,649
We're only doing this because
two lives aren't worth two cities.

415
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,890
Well, in that case, you are wiser
than I gave you credit for.

416
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:22,487
It's been a lifetime. Still wearing
those ridiculous outfits, I see.

417
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,842
You don't need to be here for this.

418
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:32,001
The culling has a tendency
to be unsightly.

419
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,609
<i>Your new friends betrayed you.</i>

420
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,330
Just do what you're going to do.

421
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,002
It's wonderful to see you again, my love.

422
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,089
I will never be your love.

423
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,370
I know.

424
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,886
Hmm.

425
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,684
That always makes this easier.

426
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,684
Chay-Ara, parting is such sweet sorrow.

427
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,086
Now, Kendra!

428
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,280
Carter!

429
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,564
I've got it!
The gauntlet's aren't working!

430
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,800
Let go, Barry!

431
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,240
No, I'm not leaving you.

432
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,086
You're fast enough to get away. Go!

433
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,966
Ollie, no.

434
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,808
Run, Barry, run.

435
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,488
Thank you for coming.
I know this is more than a little crazy.

436
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,684
I came to this meeting out of curiosity.
It is now sated.

437
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,607
Bring Khufu and Chay-Ara
to Jurgens Industrial in 24 hours

438
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,964
or I will see you dead and buried
under the bodies of your loved ones.

439
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,651
Barry, you all right?

440
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,650
We need to brief the team.
Come up with some type of counter attack.

441
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,005
It's not gonna work.

442
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,725
What?

443
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,361
Nothing, all right. Never mind.
I shouldn't have said anything. l...

444
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,806
Hey, what's going on?

445
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,367
Okay, look. This isn't going to make
any sense to you, but I...

446
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,803
All right, so I traveled back in time
from when we tried to take out Savage.

447
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,561
I mean, later, when we try
to take him down, in the future,

448
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,529
and it doesn't work.

449
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,047
You're right.
That doesn't make sense to me.

450
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,521
My world is stranger than yours.

451
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,688
Well, maybe we use that to our advantage.

452
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,368
You say that whatever we do
against Savage doesn't work?

453
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,483
- Yeah.
- Then we come up with a new plan.

454
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,370
No. No, no, no.
Okay, look, you can't.

455
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,524
When I mess with time,
it just... it doesn't end well.

456
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,246
But what you're telling is
that it already doesn't end well.

457
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,888
Barry, people in our line of work,
we don't get second chances.

458
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,326
We need to take this one.

459
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,006
All right. I hope you're right.

460
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,244
All right.
Let's start with what went wrong.

461
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,444
You did. When we go up against Savage,
your head's not in the game.

462
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,364
- You're not yourself.
- Why not?

463
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,291
- Oliver, I...
- Barry, why not?

464
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,763
Okay, are you planning on
giving me a hair sample

465
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,724
to run forensics on in the near future?

466
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,721
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

467
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,447
Well, I did. And you were
pretty shaken after the fact.

468
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,809
And then Felicity found out.
And you guys had a pretty big fight,

469
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,565
and it sounded like it was over
between you two.

470
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,086
What was the fight about?

471
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,251
I'm pretty sure you're
someone's father, Oliver.

472
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,886
So when we go up against Savage,
you're not focused.

473
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,287
And then Kendra can't access her powers

474
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,286
and then the tech they're developing to
counteract Savages staff does not work.

475
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,929
Everyone dies, Oliver.

476
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,240
This time, they won't.
This time, we do things differently.

477
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,281
How're they coming?

478
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,565
For my first pair of anti-Gandalf
magic staff gloves, pretty good, I think.

479
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,131
Yeah, just double and triple check, okay?

480
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,009
I'm a little worried
about them not working.

481
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,446
Based on what?

482
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,130
Call it a gut instinct.

483
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,645
Also, I need you to talk to Kendra.

484
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,801
Oh, I get it. You shoot arrows,
you give love tips.

485
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,491
It's like you're Cupid or something.

486
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,444
What Carter is doing with her
isn't working.

487
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,085
We need her power to fight Savage,

488
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,482
and we need her
to be able to use it reliably.

489
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,009
Carter's a jerk. But he's supposed to be
with her, 'cause destiny says

490
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,607
they're supposed to be together
and he's supposed to be her soulmate.

491
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,131
So I'm not even sure
what I could say...

492
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,607
You need to do something, Cisco.
We need to reach her.

493
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,167
Egyptian reincarnation is not
in my wheelhouse.

494
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,481
What Kendra is going through
is about accepting who she really is.

495
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,480
Who better to help her do that than a guy
who is clearly in love with her?

496
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,011
I don't know if we're at
the L-bomb stage yet.

497
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,806
I'll talk to her.

498
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,161
You don't think that's
a little bit insane?

499
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,971
No. I think it's noble.
I think it's what makes them all heroes.

500
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,523
Yeah, that's nice. I'm gonna talk
to Kendra for a minute, He-Man.

501
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,524
It's Hawkman. Thanks.

502
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,851
We should talk.

503
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,726
I thought you were the one that said
we should wait till this was all over.

504
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,686
Oh, this isn't that talk. This is the
trying-to-help-you-sprout-wings talk.

505
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,521
Yeah, well, according to Carter,
I'm a warrior priestess,

506
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,888
and rage is the key to
rediscovering myself.

507
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,889
Yeah, I'm not surprised
Mr. Aggro thinks that,

508
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,769
but I think he's got
this whole thing twisted.

509
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,362
Instead of focusing on the warrior,
focus on the priestess.

510
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,201
And the nurturer.

511
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,089
The good-hearted person inside.

512
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,051
How do you know I was so
goodhearted 4,000 years ago?

513
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,722
Because I know you, Kendra,
and some things don't change.

514
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,561
I think you're resisting what
Carter's trying to teach you

515
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,042
because it means remembering who you were,
and that is somebody else.

516
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,446
Somebody who loves him.

517
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,083
Ever since I emerged,

518
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,209
I've been remembering our first life.

519
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,561
In Egypt.

520
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,367
But I've been telling Carter I can't
remember anything because

521
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,727
I don't want to accept that I'm some
reincarnated Egyptian warrior priestess.

522
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,920
Okay. Yeah, that's pretty heavy.

523
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,449
But it's also pretty amazing.

524
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,084
I've been through this. You know I have.

525
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,764
And what you're going through
right now, this is a gift.

526
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,284
It's a miracle that most people
don't even get to experience.

527
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,483
Yeah, well, it feels like a nightmare.

528
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,321
Yeah, but that is a choice.
You can choose the other thing.

529
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,807
To remember who you are, or who you were.

530
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,289
Close your eyes. Just close your eyes.

531
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:10,567
Let yourself... Let yourself remember.

532
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,488
Hey, hey, hey, wait.
Stay a little longer?

533
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,648
I can't. Hath-Set and I need to make
another offering to Horus.

534
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,642
The augers have said more
sky rocks will be falling soon.

535
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,809
Well, I hear he covets you.

536
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,847
How fortunate I know the man
who can handle him.

537
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,209
Prince Khufu.
What a surprise to find you here,

538
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,164
in Chay-Ara's bed chamber.

539
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,322
Surely you must know that the clergy
is forbidden to lie with royalty.

540
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,281
Get out.

541
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,007
The penalty for such
a transgression is death.

542
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,891
I said get out.

543
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,889
I'm not afraid of your father.

544
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,529
Soon, the sky rocks will decimate
this kingdom and end his rule.

545
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,210
But first, I shall know Chay-Ara
as you have known her.

546
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,364
It Will be all right.

547
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,081
Behind you.

548
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,362
The sky rocks have come to do their work.

549
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:51,203
My hate will be everlasting.
My enmity will never die.

550
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:58,081
It will follow you from this life to the
next and to the next and to the next.

551
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,849
Horus, your children need you now.

552
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,409
We need your protection.
Shroud us in your wings.

553
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,609
I will wait for eternity.

554
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,771
Come back to me.

555
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,602
What? What happened?

556
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,927
I think I know how to beat Vandal Savage.

557
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,243
Oliver, you were right. I don't know
how you knew, but you were right.

558
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,647
The gauntlets won't work.
They're missing a critical element.

559
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,401
- How do you know?
- Because I remembered.

560
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,804
I remember how Savage killed us
the first time. Back in Egypt.

561
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,442
I've never been able
to remember our first death.

562
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,483
Well, these sky rocks, meteors,

563
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,451
they fell and they completely
destroyed the royal palace.

564
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,444
During the Middle Kingdom,
Egypt experienced a high level

565
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,926
of meteorite activity.

566
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,327
I know stuff.

567
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,841
Which is one of the many reasons
we love you so much,

568
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,282
but also doesn't seem
to help us stop Savage.

569
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,960
It's the calamity Professor Boardman
was referencing.

570
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,442
The meteors, they had a glow about them.

571
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,769
And Savage's staff had two gemstones
with the exact same glow.

572
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,645
Yeah, the gemstones might be made up
of the same element as the meteorite.

573
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,683
The Egyptians would use meteorite
in their craftsmanship.

574
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,644
And the minerals glow
in proximity to each other.

575
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,041
Like Sankara Stones.

576
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,329
<i>Oh, wait, the Indiana Jones reference</i> is
<i>the only thing</i> I <i>understood.</i>

577
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,847
Two pieces of the same meteorite,
like an Nth metal.

578
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,968
That is the key
to counteracting the staff.

579
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,686
Believe it or not, that isn't actually
the craziest thing I've heard today.

580
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,444
<i>There's a sample of
the meteorite from the Middle Kingdom</i>

581
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,365
at the Keystone City Museum
of Natural History.

582
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,966
Hopefully, I got the right one.

583
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,003
I could synthesize a compatible
isotope out of this,

584
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,161
and coat the gauntlets with it.

585
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,325
Okay, do it. Savage doesn't know
that Kendra's gained access

586
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,648
to all of her abilities.
That makes you our ace in the hole.

587
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,046
Where do you need us?

588
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,240
Suit up.

589
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,931
Ollie. Everyone's in position.

590
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,365
Are you sure about this?

591
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,682
About changing the future?

592
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,521
Barry, what can happen here
that is worse than what already did?

593
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,681
If I knew that, I wouldn't be so worried.

594
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,691
Let's do it.

595
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,728
It's wonderful to see you again, my love.

596
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,729
I will never be your love.

597
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,721
I know.

598
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,408
That always makes this easier.

599
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,044
Chay-Ara, parting is such sweet sorrow.

600
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,446
Now, Kendra!

601
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,608
(%SCREECHES)

602
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,931
Stand clear!

603
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,170
The gauntlets are working!

604
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,645
No, no, no.
Oliver, get yourself to safety!

605
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,291
We're not leaving each other!

606
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,921
Did we do it? Is he gone?

607
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,521
Yeah, looks like.

608
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,170
I knew you could do it.

609
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,482
I'm having the strangest dj vu.

610
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,768
You're not the only one.

611
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,891
So, how do you feel now
that Savage is pushing daisies?

612
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,168
Does this mean you guys
are the immortal ones now,

613
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,005
and he's the one who gets reincarnated?
'Cause that would suck.

614
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,641
I just sprouted wings a few days ago,

615
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,205
and I'm just trying
to wrap my head around that.

616
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,528
You know, he does raise
a good point, though.

617
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,530
Savage is gone for good now, right?

618
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,525
I don't know.
We've never defeated him before.

619
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,491
But we're free.

620
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,847
Ugh, get a room.

621
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,690
Finally have the rest of
your lives in front of you.

622
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,966
Have you thought about what
you're gonna do?

623
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,851
Carter says in our past lives
we used to help people.

624
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,208
After everything
you guys have done for me,

625
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,931
I think I should give that a try.

626
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,206
You make it sound like this try
is happening somewhere else.

627
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,011
In our prior incarnation,
we used to live in Saint Wilkin.

628
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,531
<i>You really liked it there.</i>

629
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,164
Could Cisco and I have a moment?

630
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,566
Of course.

631
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,484
Here we go.

632
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,888
Cisco, I'm really sorry.

633
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,761
You know what? It's fine. It's cool.
It's actually kind of a classic story.

634
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,884
Boy meets girl, boy gets girl,
girl sprouts wings and flies away

635
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,247
with her reincarnated soulmate.
The only part I don't get is,

636
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,568
you don't even really seem to like him.

637
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,287
It's kind of a complicated relationship.

638
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,086
Like most 4,000-year-old
relationships are, I guess.

639
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,408
A week ago, I was a barista.

640
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,683
And I really didn't have a plan
for what I was going to do with my life.

641
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,566
And now you do?

642
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,923
Well, at least I know I want to find out.

643
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,084
Okay. I made you something.

644
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,604
To remember me by, I guess.

645
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,562
I made it out of the Nth metal
that Barry got from the meteorite.

646
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,603
It's got a micro-GPS chip embedded in it.

647
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,890
So if you're ever in trouble,
I'll come find you.

648
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,565
What was that for?

649
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,291
For being you.

650
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,646
Thank you, Cisco.

651
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,123
Well, you did it, Barry.
Everyone's alive.

652
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,606
Our guardian angel.

653
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,440
That's what you told me I could be
when I told you about my powers.

654
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,967
Meant it then, and I know it now.

655
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,329
Hey, Oliver, um, we need to have
a difficult conversation, I think.

656
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,809
About my son?
God, it feels weird to say that.

657
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,761
Well, less about your son
and more about whether or not

658
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,450
you're gonna tell Felicity about him.

659
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,846
I don't think that's any of your business.

660
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,447
You know, yeah, you're right.
It's not really my business.

661
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,008
Except I told you, when I mess with time,
time messes back.

662
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,328
And we've already changed
how things turned out with Savage.

663
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,045
And I'm worried about temporal backlash.

664
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,011
Wait, do you think that the timeline
cares about what I tell my girlfriend?

665
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,321
What are you gonna tell her?

666
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,801
Well, you're right when you say
that the rules keep changing

667
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,005
and that the lives that we lead,
they make us feel powerless.

668
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,167
And it makes me wonder
if William wouldn't be better off

669
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,010
with my world kept separate from his.

670
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,801
Look, Oliver, take it from someone
who didn't get to grow up with his father.

671
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,129
I think the best thing for William
is for you to be a part of his life.

672
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,046
Thanks, Barry.

673
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,966
Yeah, man.

674
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,488
I'm not really a hugger.

675
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,684
Yeah. Tell me something I don't know.

676
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,565
But the thing is, lam fast enough
to just hug you without you knowing,

677
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,201
- so you might as well let me.
- Fine.

678
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,651
Thanks. That wasn't so bad, right?

679
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:47,326
These are my conditions, Oliver.
You've already asked me for the world.

680
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,568
I'm just asking for the same in return.

681
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,851
Okay.

682
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,370
I won't tell anyone.

683
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,846
Even Felicity.

684
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,164
Felicity. That's a nice name.

685
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,042
She is a nice person. She's the best.

686
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,009
William is in his room.

687
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,089
You're just a friend of Mommy's, okay?

688
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,084
- Hey, William.
- Hello.

689
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,965
You like the Flash?

690
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,246
Can I tell you a secret?

691
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,406
I've actually met the Flash.

692
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,725
What's he like? Is he cool?

693
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,289
Yeah. He's super cool.
He's one of the best guys that I know.

694
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,928
I'm Oliver. I'm a friend of your mom's.
We've known each other a long time.

695
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,610
Wanna play action figures?

696
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,160
Sure. Sure.

697
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,286
William, I'd love to come by
every once in a while to say hello.

698
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,331
Would that be all right with you?

699
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,442
That's Captain Cold. He's a bad guy.

700
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,410
Yes, he is. The Flash is gonna
have to be very fast to catch him.

701
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,280
He will. He's the fastest man alive.

702
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,966
- Oh!
- Got you.

703
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:29,651
Oh, what a mess.
Oh, we have to clean this place up.

704
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,966
Unless you're ready to tell me
what you said you'd tell me.

705
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,884
Felicity, um...

706
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:42,325
Oliver, we have a life together, right?

707
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,489
- We're a team.
- Ow.

708
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,327
If something is bothering you,
and I don't know about it,

709
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,407
I can't help you fix it.
I can't be a good teammate.

710
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,571
I love you.

711
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,483
And that makes me want to be
the best teammate ever.

712
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,160
Not in the Lance Armstrong
performance-enhancing drugs kind of way.

713
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,164
More like the more positive
sports analogy I would use

714
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,845
if I knew anything about sports.

715
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,490
What had you acting so strange
when we got to Central City?

716
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,684
It doesn't matter. It's over.

717
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,686
And I am back in Star City. With you.

718
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,691
- Mmm.
- Come here.

719
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,527
Your hate will be everlasting.
Your enmity will never die.

720
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,886
It will follow them from this life
into the next and the next.

721
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,690
You owe me one, buddy.

722
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,481
English - SDH
