00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:50,426
I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to
offer you a chance to explain your actions.

159
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,471
I wasn't aware that my actions
required any explanation.

160
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,932
You were given an order
to return to Zion.

161
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,935
- I did.
- You asked for one ship to remain behind.

162
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,771
I would have stayed,
but I needed to recharge my ship.

163
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,649
So you admit to a direct contravention
of your duty.

164

We need a presence inside the Matrix
to await contact from the Oracle.

or prophecies or messiahs!

167
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,786
I care about one thing: Stopping that
army from destroying this city.

168
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,789
To do that I need soldiers
to obey my orders.

169
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:24,544
With all due respect, commander,
there is only one way to save our city.

170
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,128
How?

171
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,090
- Neo.
- Goddamn it, Morpheus.

172
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,884
Not everyone believes what you believe.

173
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,136
My beliefs do not require them to.

174

There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's
talking. A lot of people are scared.

175
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,151
No one remembers the last time
so many ships were docked.

- Hey.

We're not allowed to say anything,
so stop asking.

Goddamn, it's good to be home.

179

I'm recommending that you
be removed from duty.

180
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,518
That is, of course,
your prerogative, commander.

181
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:26,564
If it were up to me, you wouldn't set foot
on a ship for the rest of your life.

182

Council's asked me to speak tonight
at the temple gathering.

187
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:49,545
The presence of the fleet and the
persistence of rumors must be addressed.

188
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,214
The people must be told
what is happening.

Of course, councillor.

concerning specific details.

- Quite right.

What about you, captain?
What would you advise?

194

The truth. No one will panic,
because there is nothing to fear.

- Consider what we have seen, councillor.

Consider that in the past six months...

198

...we have freed more minds
than in six years.

I do not believe it to be
a matter of hope, councillor.

Because of Morpheus.

how can I make a choice?

468
00:45:57,004 --> 00:46:01,050
Because you didn't come here to make
the choice. You've already made it.

469
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:05,846
You're here to try to understand
why you made it.

470
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:14,355
I thought you'd have figured that out
by now.

471
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:18,693
- Why are you here?
- Same reason.

472
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:21,696
I love candy.

473
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,699
But why help us?

474
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:28,369
We're all here to do
what we're all here to do.

475
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,998
I'm interested in one thing, Neo:
the future.

476
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:36,377
And believe me, I know, the only way
to get there is together.

477
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:42,133
- Are there other programs like you?
- Well, not like me, but...

478
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,969
Look. See those birds?

479
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:48,597
At some point, a program was written
to govern them.

480
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:54,603
A program was written to watch over the
trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.

481
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:57,732
There are programs running
all over the place.

482
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:02,361
The ones doing their job, doing what
they were meant to do, are invisible.

483
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:06,365
You'd never even know they were here.
But the other ones...

484
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:10,619
Well, you hear about them all the time.

485
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:14,081
- I've never heard of them.
- Of course you have.

486
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:19,170
Every time you've heard someone
say they saw a ghost or an angel...

487
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:23,924
...every story you've ever heard about
vampires, werewolves or aliens...

488
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,427
...is the system assimilating
some program...

489
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:31,265
...that's doing something
they're not supposed to be doing.

490
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:34,435
Programs hacking programs.

491
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:37,480
- Why?
- They have their reasons...

492
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:41,609
...but usually a program chooses exile
when it faces deletion.

493
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:45,946
- And why would a program be deleted?
- Maybe it breaks down.

494
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:50,659
Maybe a better program is created
to replace it. Happens all the time.

495
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:55,790
And when it does, a program
can either choose to hide here...

496
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,626
...or return to the source.

497
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:03,589
- The machine mainframe.
- Yes.

498
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:06,258
Where you must go.

499
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:10,638
Where the path of the One ends.
You've seen it...

500
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:14,642
...in your dreams, haven't you?

501

A door made of light?

502
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:23,442
What happens when you go through
the door?

503
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,572
I see Trinity...

504
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,909
...and something happens...

505
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,994
...something bad.

506
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:38,165
She starts to fall,
and then I wake up.

507
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:43,087
- Do you see her die?
- No.

508
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,924
You have the sight now, Neo.

509
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:50,094
You are looking at the world
without time.

510
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,680
Then why can't I see
what happens to her?

511
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:56,600
We can never see past the choices
we don't understand.

512
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,937
Are you saying I have to choose
whether Trinity lives or dies?

513
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,983
No, you've already made the choice.

514
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,694
Now you have to understand it.

515
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,696
No.

516
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:12,116
I can't do that. I won't.

517
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:15,202
- Well, you have to.
- Why?

518
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,873
Because you're the One.

519
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:24,044
What if I can't?

520
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,213
What happens if I fail?

521
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,800
Then Zion will fall.

522
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:42,146
Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.
You can save Zion...

523
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:45,649
...if you reach the source, but to do that
you need the Keymaker.

524
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:46,859
The Keymaker?

525
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:50,613
He disappeared. We didn't
know what happened to him until now.

526
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:54,533
He's being held prisoner
by a very dangerous program...

527
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,245
...one of the oldest of us.
He is called the Merovingian.

528
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:01,290
- And he won't let him go willingly.
- What does he want?

529
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:06,295
What do all men with power want?
More power.

- Yeah.

Our connection.

I don't fully understand how it happened.

547
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:24,915
Perhaps some part of you
imprinted onto me...

548
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,751
...something overwritten or copied.

549
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,629
It is, at this point, irrelevant.
What matters is...

550
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,882
...that whatever happened,
happened for a reason.

And what reason is that?

I killed you, Mr. Anderson.
I watched you die.

With a certain satisfaction,
I might add.

And then something happened,
something that I knew was impossible...

I couldn't. I was compelled to stay...

We're here because we are not free.

The Council is calling for two volunteers
to aid the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

Are there two among you
that would answer such a call?

Captain Soren of the <i>Vigilant</i>
will answer the Council's call.

Captain Soren?

- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, captain.

Is there another?

628
01:01:57,297 --> 01:02:01,009
- Captain, I think we should volunteer.
- What? You have gone crazy.

understand the reason.

634
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:26,076
Captain Niobe of the <i>Logos</i>
will answer the councillor's call.

635
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,495
- What?
- Thank you, Captain Niobe.

636
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:33,792
Commander Lock, you have your orders.
This Council is hereby adjourned.

637
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:41,091
- Niobe, what are you doing?
- What I can.

638
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:42,300
Why?

639
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,846
Because some things
never change, Jason...

What can you see, Neo?

642
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:09,703
It's strange.
The code is somehow different.

643
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,454
- Encrypted?
- Maybe.

Is that good for us or bad for us?

645
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:17,419
Well, it looks like every floor
is wired with explosives.

646
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,587
Bad for us.

- Yes, of course. Who has time?

Château Haut-Briond, 1959.
Magnificent wine.

I love French wine
like I love the French language.

I am a trafficker of information.
I know everything I can.

The question is,
do you know why you are here?

672
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,710
We are looking for the Keymaker.

673
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:27,882
Oh, yes, it is true.
The Keymaker, of course.

674

But this is not a reason,
this is not a why.

675
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:34,931
The Keymaker himself, his very nature,
is a means, it is not an end.

676
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:40,854
And so to look for him is to be
looking for a means to do...

- ...what?
- You know the answer to that question.

You think you do, but you do not.

You are here
because you were sent here.

You were told to come here,
and then you obeyed.

It is, of course, the way of all things.

- Cause and effect.
- Everything begins with choice.

No. Wrong.

689
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:21,728
Choice is an illusion created

I wrote it myself.

698
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:59,766
It starts so simply...

699
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:04,521
...each line of the program creating
a new effect, just like...

700

She does not understand why.

01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:23,790
Is it the wine? No.

706

What is it then? What is the reason?

707
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,295
And soon it does not matter.

708

Soon the why and the reason are gone...

709
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:38,972
...and all that matters is the feeling itself.

710
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:42,517
And this is the nature of the universe.

711
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:45,228
We struggle against it,
we fight to deny it...

712
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:47,981
...but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.

Beneath our poised appearance...

714
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:57,615
...the truth is, we are completely...

715
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:03,371
...out of control.

716
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:13,590
Causality. There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.

717
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:19,470
Our only hope, our only peace,
is to understand it, to understand the why.

"Why" is what separates us from them...

...you from me.

720

Without it, you are powerless.

...even if they were only aware
of the choice at a near unconscious level.

1089
01:54:00,542 --> 01:54:03,962
While this answer functioned,
it was fundamentally flawed...

1090
01:54:04,129 --> 01:54:08,133
...thus creating the otherwise
contradictory systemic anomaly...

1091
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:11,011
...that, if left unchecked,
might threaten the system.

1092
01:54:11,386 --> 01:54:15,515
Ergo, those that refused the program,
while a minority, if unchecked...

1093
01:54:15,682 --> 01:54:19,770
...would constitute
an escalating probability of disaster.

1094
01:54:19,936 --> 01:54:21,730
This is about Zion.

1095
01:54:22,189 --> 01:54:25,859
You are here because Zion
is about to be destroyed.

1096
01:54:26,026 --> 01:54:30,447
Its every living inhabitant terminated,
its entire existence eradicated.

1097
01:54:30,739 --> 01:54:31,782
Bullshit.

1098
01:54:31,948 --> 01:54:35,118
Denial is the most predictable
of all human responses.

1099
01:54:35,327 --> 01:54:41,792
But rest assured, this will be
the sixth time we have destroyed it...

1100
01:54:41,958 --> 01:54:45,962
...and we have become
exceedingly efficient at it.

1101
01:54:58,683 --> 01:54:59,976
The function of the One...

1102
01:55:00,143 --> 01:55:04,815
...is now to return to the source, allowing
a dissemination of the code you carry...

1103
01:55:04,981 --> 01:55:06,691
...reinserting the prime program.

1104
01:55:07,275 --> 01:55:11,279
After which you will be required to select
from the Matrix 23 individuals...

1105
01:55:11,446 --> 01:55:14,699
...sixteen female, seven male,
to rebuild Zion.

1106
01:55:14,866 --> 01:55:19,413
Failure to comply with this process
will result in a cataclysmic system crash...

1107
01:55:19,579 --> 01:55:21,915
...killing everyone connected
to the Matrix...

1108
01:55:22,082 --> 01:55:24,668
...which, coupled with the
extermination of Zion...

1109
01:55:24,835 --> 01:55:29,047
...will result in the extinction
of the entire human race.

1110
01:55:29,381 --> 01:55:33,468
You won't let it happen. You can't.
You need human beings to survive.

1111
01:55:34,261 --> 01:55:37,889
There are levels of survival
we are prepared to accept.

1112
01:55:38,056 --> 01:55:40,851
The relevant issue is
whether or not you are ready...

1113
01:55:41,017 --> 01:55:44,604
...to accept the responsibility for the death
of every human being in this world.

1114
01:55:51,069 --> 01:55:53,613
It is interesting reading your reactions.

1115
01:55:54,656 --> 01:55:58,493
Your five predecessors were, by design,
based on a similar predication...

1116
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:03,123
...a contingent affirmation that was meant
to create a profound attachment...

1117
01:56:03,290 --> 01:56:06,877
...to the rest of your species,
facilitating the function of the One.

1118
01:56:07,043 --> 01:56:09,379
While the others experience this
in a general way...

1119
01:56:09,546 --> 01:56:12,507
...your experience is far more specific...

1120
01:56:12,841 --> 01:56:15,719
...vis-à-vis love.

to save your life at the cost of her own.

No.

1124
01:56:27,105 --> 01:56:31,234
Which brings us at last to the moment
of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...

1125
01:56:31,401 --> 01:56:34,488
...is ultimately expressed
and the anomaly revealed...

1126
01:56:34,654 --> 01:56:38,658
...as both beginning and end.

1127
01:56:38,825 --> 01:56:40,494
There are two doors.

1128

The door to your right leads to the source
and the salvation of Zion.

1129

The door to your left leads back to the
Matrix, to her and the end of your species.

1130

the problem is choice.

specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.
