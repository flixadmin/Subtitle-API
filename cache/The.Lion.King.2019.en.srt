1
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,189
<i>From the day we arrive on the planet</i>

2
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:51,069
<i>And blinking, step into the sun</i>

3
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:57,325
<i>There's more to see than can ever be seen</i>

4
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:02,497
<i>More to do than can ever be done</i>

5
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:08,086
<i>There's far too much to take in here</i>

6
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:13,550
<i>More to find than can ever be found</i>

7
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,178
<i>But the sun rolling high</i>

8
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,223
<i>Through the sapphire sky</i>

9
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:25,061
<i>Keeps great and small on the endless round</i>

10
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:29,733
<i>It's the circle of life</i>

11
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:35,530
<i>And it moves us all</i>

12
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,369
<i>Through despair and hope</i>

13
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,498
<i>Through faith and love</i>

14
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:52,255
<i>Till we find our place</i>

15
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,426
<i>On the path unwinding</i>

16
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:04,225
<i>In the circle</i>

17
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,521
<i>The circle of life</i>

18
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,906
<i>It's the circle of life</i>

19
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,412
<i>And it moves us all</i>

20
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:12,502
<i>Through despair and hope</i>

21
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:18,048
<i>Through faith and love</i>

22
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,762
<i>Till we find our place</i>

23
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:29,978
<i>On the path unwinding</i>

24
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:36,526
<i>In the circle</i>

25
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:41,906
<i>The circle of life</i>

26
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,322
Life's not fair...

27
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,449
is it, my little friend?

28
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,369
While some are born to feast...

29
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,999
others spend their lives in the dark,
begging for scraps.

30
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,962
The way I see it...

31
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,216
you and I are exactly the same.

32
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,221
We both want to find a way out.

33
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,889
The king approaches!

34
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,474
This is not a drill.

35
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,268
His Majesty has requested an audience.

36
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:36,896
Upon his entrance,
you will rise and genuflect.

37
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,523
Zazu...

38
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,526
you've made me lose my lunch.

39
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,280
You will answer to Mufasa for missing
the ceremony this morning.

40
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,741
I answer to no one.

41
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,828
Scar? Scar. Scar.

42
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,039
No, no. Don't look at me like that.

43
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,583
Are you hungry, Zazu?

44
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,461
Perhaps we could have a bite together!

45
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,796
You can't eat me!

46
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:05,550
It is forbidden to eat
a member of the king's court!

47
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,802
No, please! Stop it!

48
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,846
Scar!

49
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,018
Well, look who's come down
to mingle with the commoners.

50
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,315
Sarabi and I didn't see you
at the presentation of Simba.

51
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,610
Was that today?

52
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,656
Must've slipped my mind.

53
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:34,954
Of course I meant no disrespect
towards His Majesty or Sarabi.

54
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:42,253
As you know, I have tremendous respect
for the queen.

55
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,257
As the king's brother,
you should've been first in line.

56
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,009
I was first in line.

57
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,345
Or don't you remember?

58
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:54,766
That is, until the precious prince arrived.

59
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,936
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.

60
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:01,815
No, Mufasa, perhaps you shouldn't
turn your back on me.

61
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,485
Is that a challenge?

62
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,989
I wouldn't dream of challenging you again.

63
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:11,991
A wise decision.

64
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,411
You are no match for His Royalness.

65
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,789
Well, as far as brains go,
I got the lion's share.

66
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:22,711
But when it comes to brute strength,
I'm afraid my big brother...

67
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,546
will always rule.

68
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,007
Not always, Scar.

69
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,427
One day, it'll be my son who rules.

70
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,721
Simba will be your king.

71
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,932
Then long live the king.

72
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,354
-What am I gonna do with him?
-Come on.

73
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,150
We both know he should've been
expelled from the Pride Lands long ago.

74
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,236
He's my brother, Zazu.
This is his home.

75
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:52,032
As long as I am king,
that will never change.

76
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,867
Well, there's one in every family, sire.

77
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,286
I had a cousin who thought
he was a woodpecker.

78
00:08:56,453 --> 00:09:00,457
He slammed his head into trees,
and our beaks aren't built for it.

79
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,460
He was concussed regularly.
You've gone.

80
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,670
Sire, coming back!

81
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,118
Simba.

82
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,913
Dad, you awake?

83
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,126
Dad, wake up!

84
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,253
Dad!

85
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,256
Dad, Dad, Dad!

86
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,134
Your son's awake.

87
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,470
Before sunrise, he's your son.

88
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,472
Come on, Dad, let's go.

89
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,308
You said I could patrol with you today.
And today has started.

90
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,269
You promised!
You up?

91
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,822
Let's do this!

92
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,201
-Let's do this.
-So, what's first?

93
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,454
Give orders for the hunt?
Chase away evil intruders?

94
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,209
Dad! You're going the wrong way!

95
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,428
Dad?

96
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:03,139
I'm not supposed to go up here.

97
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,933
Look, Simba.

98
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,896
Everything the light touches is our kingdom.

99
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,649
You rule all of that?

100
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,275
Yes.

101
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,820
But a king's time as ruler...

102
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,906
rises and falls like the sun.

103
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,658
One day, Simba...

104
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,828
the sun will set on my time here...

105
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,580
and will rise with you as the new king.

106
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:32,627
All of this will belong to me?

107
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:37,382
It belongs to no one,
but will be yours to protect.

108
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,509
A great responsibility.

109
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,012
Everything the light touches?

110
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,849
Those trees?
And the watering hole?

111
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,726
And that mountain?

112
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,186
And beyond those shadows?

113
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,355
You must not go there, Simba.

114
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,733
But I thought a king could do
whatever he wants.

115
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,151
Take any territory.

116
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:00,280
While others search for what they can take...

117
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,283
a true king searches for what he can give.

118
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:14,085
Everything you see exists together
in a delicate balance.

119
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:18,548
As king, you need to
understand that balance...

120
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,842
and respect all the creatures...

121
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,678
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope.

122
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:28,058
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?

123
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,811
Yes, Simba. But let me explain.

124
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:36,191
When we die, our bodies become the grass...

125
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:39,277
and the antelope eat the grass...

126
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:43,865
and so we are all connected
in the great circle of life.

127
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,576
-Sire!
-Morning, Zazu.

128
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,244
Do you have the morning report?

129
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,704
Yes, sire.

130
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,123
Ten flamingos are taking a stand.

131
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,708
Two giraffe were caught necking.

132
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,001
The buzz from the bees...

133
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,920
-is that the leopards are in a bit of a spot.
-Ready for some fun?

134
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,005
The birds are tweeting
at 4:00 in the morning.

135
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,757
I'm like, "Birds, we get it."

136
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,425
Stay low to the ground.

137
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,468
I got this.

138
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,513
Check the wind, the shadows...

139
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,516
and wait for the perfect moment to pounce.

140
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,893
The cheetahs stole the baboons' dinner,
and now the baboons are going ape.

141
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,145
Of course, as I say, cheetahs never prosper.

142
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,356
That's what I say. Do you get...
I'll say it again.

143
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,732
Cheetahs never...

144
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:23,613
Come on! It's the news!

145
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,451
That's very good!

146
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,454
Sire!

147
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,417
Sire! Hyenas in the Pride Lands.
They're on the hunt!

148
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,378
-Where's Sarabi?
-She's leading the charge.

149
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:39,879
Zazu, take Simba home.

150
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,715
Dad, let me come! I can help.

151
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:45,385
No, son. You stay with the other cubs.

152
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:47,887
I am not a cub.

153
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,641
Come on.

154
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,518
Let's go home.

155
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,573
Here we are.

156
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,243
Now you go along
and play with the other cubs.

157
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,166
Great.

158
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,132
If you wish to kill something...

159
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,259
you might want to stay downwind.

160
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,470
I know how to hunt, Uncle Scar.

161
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,723
Well, let's hope we're never
attacked by a beetle.

162
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,519
Go back to your den, Simba.
I don't babysit.

163
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,563
Babysit?
I'm gonna be the king of Pride Rock.

164
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,776
My dad showed me the whole kingdom.

165
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,986
Said I'm going to rule it all.

166
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,738
Is that so?

167
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:29,948
Think about it.

168
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:33,076
When I'm king,
I'll have to give you orders.

169
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,994
Tell you what to do.

170
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,996
How weird is that?

171
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,208
You've no idea.

172
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:45,005
So, your dad showed you the whole kingdom?

173
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,925
Did he show you the shadows
beyond the northern borders?

174
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:53,179
No. He said I can't go there.
Ever.

175
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:57,142
And he's absolutely right.

176
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,313
An elephant graveyard is no place
for a young prince.

177
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,066
An elephant graveyard?

178
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,404
Oh, dear. I've said too much.

179
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,448
Though I suppose you'd have
found out sooner or later...

180
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:14,367
you being king and all.

181
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,868
You've been there?

182
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:19,372
We've all been there.
And it's no place for a cub.

183
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,875
All those rotting bones...

184
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,127
and burning pools of oozing mud.

185
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,464
Rotting bones?
Oozing mud?

186
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,925
Promise me you'll stay away, Simba.

187
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,677
Now, you run along.

188
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:38,183
And remember...

189
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,562
it's our little secret...

190
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,815
Your Majesty.

191
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,408
Nala! Come on.
We have to go.

192
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,285
-Where?
-Watering hole.

193
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,454
Simba, she's having her bath.

194
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,456
And it's time for yours.

195
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:02,791
But, Mom...

196
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,793
I can do it myself.

197
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,211
Hold still.

198
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,046
You're messing up my mane!

199
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,090
Come on. Behind the ears.

200
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:12,008
Come on, Mom!

201
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,389
See? All clean. Can we go?

202
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:21,059
There's no hyenas.
You just chased them all off.

203
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:25,146
Just to the watering hole and no further.

204
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,358
And stay downwind.

205
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,402
And one more little thing.

206
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,362
Zazu will be going with you.

207
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:33,571
Zazu?

208
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:34,614
Zazu goes...

209
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,324
or you don't.

210
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:43,581
Come along. Keep up.
Let's move in a unit.

211
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,250
Okay, buddy system.

212
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,085
So, where are we really going?

213
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:48,253
How did you know?

214
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,421
You hate the water.

215
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:53,383
I heard about this place, Nala.
The most incredible, amazing...

216
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,260
Just tell me where.

217
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:58,221
An elephant graveyard.

218
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,515
How far is it?

219
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,517
Not far. Just to the shadows.

220
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,561
But don't worry,
everyone's been there.

221
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,062
We've never been that far before.

222
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,106
-What if we get lost?
-Relax, Nala.

223
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:11,735
I patrolled the entire kingdom this morning
with my dad.

224
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,361
There's nothing to worry about.

225
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:15,405
Well, there is one thing.

226
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,034
We have an imminent threat.
Something is approaching.

227
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,119
Wait, scratch that.
That's my own shadow.

228
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:23,163
How we getting rid of the dodo?

229
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,956
Trust me, I got this.

230
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,458
Follow me to freedom.

231
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,753
How lovely it is...

232
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,131
to see the future king
with his future queen.

233
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,050
I could just molt.

234
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,843
What do you mean, "future queen"?

235
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,846
Well, one day the two of you
will be betrothed.

236
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,807
Intended. Affianced.

237
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,018
Simba, you speak bird?

238
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,269
Married!

239
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,730
Come on. One day you will be married.

240
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:52,650
To each other.

241
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,072
-That's not gonna happen, Zazu.
-Never ever.

242
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,448
Nala and I are friends.

243
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,742
And besides, she's afraid of rhinos!

244
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,827
-And he's never eaten an impala.
-I've tried it once.

245
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,579
We are never getting married, Zazu.

246
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,498
A monarch who ignores tradition?

247
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:10,794
With an attitude like that, I'm afraid
you'll be a pretty pathetic king.

248
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,422
Well, I'm not letting anyone tell me
where to go, what to do...

249
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:15,799
and even who to marry.

250
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,801
There will never be a king like me.

251
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:21,137
Simba, you can't escape your destiny.

252
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:22,847
Just watch.

253
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,016
<i>I'm gonna be a mighty king</i>

254
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,060
<i>So enemies beware</i>

255
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:32,232
<i>Well, I've never seen a king of beasts
with quite so little hair</i>

256
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:37,153
<i>I'm gonna be the main event
Like no king was before</i>

257
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:41,950
<i>I'm brushing up on looking down
Working on my roar</i>

258
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:45,453
<i>Thus far a rather uninspiring thing</i>

259
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:50,375
<i>Oh, I just can't wait to be king</i>

260
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,669
You have rather a long way to go,
young master.

261
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:53,962
If you think...

262
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,296
<i>No one saying "do this"</i>

263
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:56,715
Now, when I said that...

264
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,133
<i>No one saying "be there"</i>

265
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,217
What I meant was...

266
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,302
<i>No one saying "stop that"</i>

267
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,013
<i>No one saying "see here"</i>

268
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,347
Now see here!

269
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:07,517
<i>Free to run around all day</i>

270
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,060
Well, that's definitely out.

271
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:12,689
<i>Free to do it all my way</i>

272
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:20,697
<i>I think it's time that you and I
arranged a heart-to-heart</i>

273
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:25,702
<i>Kings don't need advice
from little hornbills for a start</i>

274
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:30,540
<i>If this is where the monarchy is headed,
count me out</i>

275
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:33,168
<i>Out of service
Out of Africa</i>

276
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,503
<i>I wouldn't hang about</i>

277
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:39,299
<i>This child is getting wildly out of wing</i>

278
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,342
Simba!

279
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:44,596
<i>Oh, I just can't wait to be king</i>

280
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,690
Simba!

281
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,567
I can't see you, Simba.

282
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,486
You must be in my sight at all times.

283
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:00,862
I've lost him!

284
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,449
I know what you're doing!

285
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:06,659
Where are you going, Simba?

286
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,286
Come on!

287
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,457
You can't hide from me, Simba.

288
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:15,293
It is my sworn duty to keep you safe.

289
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,420
You listen to me right now.

290
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:23,051
I'm sorry to flutter about in your face,
have you seen...?

291
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:24,344
He's a little lion.

292
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,471
He's small,
but he's cute.

293
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:33,436
<i>Everybody look left</i>

294
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:35,772
<i>Everybody look right</i>

295
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:38,233
<i>Everywhere you look I'm</i>

296
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,151
<i>Standing in the spotlight</i>

297
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:41,152
Not yet.

298
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:44,906
<i>Let every creature go for broke and sing</i>

299
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:49,119
<i>Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing</i>

300
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,121
I see you down there!
I see you down there!

301
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:54,749
<i>It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling</i>

302
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:59,921
<i>Oh, I just can't wait to be king</i>

303
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:00,714
Simba!

304
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,093
<i>He just can't wait to be king</i>

305
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:08,304
<i>Oh, I just can't wait</i>

306
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,932
<i>Just can't wait</i>

307
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:15,603
<i>To be king</i>

308
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,480
I've lost him!

309
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:19,566
Mufasa's gonna have my feathers.

310
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,401
This is not good!

311
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,281
Simba, we really lost him.

312
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:27,782
I know what you're thinking.

313
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:29,242
"The future king is a genius."

314
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:30,660
You can't be serious.

315
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:33,163
You would've never gotten away
without your queen.

316
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:34,664
Aren't you forgetting something?

317
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,458
There is no queen.

318
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:37,625
You could say that again.

319
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,169
I'd rather marry an aardvark.

320
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:41,046
Good luck finding one that will say yes.

321
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:42,756
Good luck getting out of here
without a bruising.

322
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,758
Give it your best shot.

323
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:49,262
Pinned ya!

324
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:51,181
You owe me an apology.

325
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:52,807
Never!

326
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:03,693
Pinned ya.
Again.

327
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,070
Nala, stop!

328
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,196
What is that?

329
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:07,906
You're not gonna trick me, Simba.

330
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:10,283
I know that there's nothing...

331
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:15,497
This must be it.

332
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:17,957
Come on!

333
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:40,855
Simba, we're way beyond the Pride Lands.

334
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:43,358
We found it, Nala.
You know what this means?

335
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:44,901
It means we can go home.

336
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:48,238
It means they won't
treat us like cubs anymore.

337
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,664
Simba, get down!
It could be dangerous.

338
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:41,082
Danger?

339
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:43,543
I laugh in the face of danger.

340
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:48,757
Cool!

341
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:51,301
You hear that, Nala?

342
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:53,428
Simba, come on!

343
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,221
You've proved how brave you are.

344
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:59,017
Now the sun is going down,
I'm not just gonna sit here and...

345
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:22,707
Well, look at this.

346
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:26,878
We weren't expecting guests today.

347
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:29,381
Would you two cubs...

348
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:31,508
like to stay for dinner?

349
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:33,551
Yeah, stay for dinner.

350
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:36,012
'Cause you look like a midnight snack!

351
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,848
-Can you just give me a little bit of space?
-I'm helping.

352
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:40,558
We have talked about this before.

353
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:41,851
I come in alone.

354
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:44,270
I'm the lead distraction
so everyone can circle.

355
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,648
Okay, okay. Sorry.

356
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:48,441
Don't be sorry.
Just do it.

357
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:51,820
Now, this is a meal
I've waited my whole life for.

358
00:26:56,825 --> 00:27:01,579
What an unexpected treat,
to eat the son of a king.

359
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:04,332
Wait a second, the king?
As in you-know-who?

360
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:05,834
Who rules you-know-where?

361
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:08,503
Mufasa does not rule me!

362
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,548
You can't do anything to me!

363
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:13,550
'Cause I'm the future king!

364
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:18,179
He's telling me what to do.

365
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:20,890
His father's strength flickering inside.

366
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:23,268
I wonder...

367
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:25,979
how all that bravery will taste.

368
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:29,065
Let them go, Shenzi!

369
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:31,693
They made a mistake,
a horrible mistake!

370
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,780
But if you do this,
you will start a war with Mufasa!

371
00:27:35,947 --> 00:27:39,451
Hyenas and lions have been at war
since the beginning of time.

372
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:42,871
But Mufasa's bloodline will end here!

373
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:44,372
Run!

374
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:52,380
Don't let them get away!

375
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:05,727
Come on!

376
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:28,124
Did you hear that?

377
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,751
The future king!

378
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:31,378
Don't hurt me!

379
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,171
Do it again!

380
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:10,875
If you ever come near my son again...

381
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:14,045
No, Mufasa. Never.

382
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:15,880
Never again.

383
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:18,717
You've been warned, Shenzi.

384
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:30,311
I thought you were very brave.

385
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:06,973
Zazu?

386
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:11,144
Take Nala back to Pride Rock.

387
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,147
Yes, sire.

388
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:16,316
Don't be too hard on him, sire.

389
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:19,778
I remember a cub,
a certain headstrong cub...

390
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:21,821
who was always getting into scrapes.

391
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:25,742
And he achieved some prominence,
did he not, sire?

392
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:28,828
I have to teach my son a lesson.

393
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:36,336
Nala, come along.

394
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,386
Simba?

395
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:06,157
You deliberately disobeyed me.

396
00:31:06,324 --> 00:31:07,450
I know.

397
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:09,369
You could have been killed.

398
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:13,289
And what's worse,
you put Nala in danger.

399
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:15,875
Do you understand what's at stake?

400
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:20,463
You jeopardized the future of our pride.

401
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:23,717
I just wanted to show you
I could do it.

402
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:25,844
That I could be brave like you.

403
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:30,181
I'm only brave when I have to be,
when there's no other choice.

404
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:32,726
But you're not scared of anything.

405
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:34,728
I was today.

406
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:35,812
You were?

407
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:40,066
Yes. I thought I might lose you.

408
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:44,863
I guess even kings get scared, huh?

409
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:48,491
More than you could ever know.

410
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:50,493
-But guess what?
-What?

411
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,330
I think those hyenas were even scareder.

412
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:57,375
That's 'cause nobody messes with your dad.

413
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:58,710
Come here.

414
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:12,640
Dad?

415
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:15,518
-We're pals, right?
-Right.

416
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:17,937
And we'll always be together...

417
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:19,647
right?

418
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:25,487
Simba, let me tell you
something my father told me.

419
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:27,572
Look at the stars.

420
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:30,158
The great kings of the past...

421
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:33,328
look down on us from those stars.

422
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:35,747
-Really?
-Yes.

423
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:38,249
So whenever you feel alone...

424
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:41,211
just remember that those kings...

425
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:44,130
will always be up there to guide you.

426
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:46,883
And so will I.

427
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,135
But I can't see them, Dad.

428
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:51,471
Keep looking, son.

429
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:53,348
Keep looking.

430
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:30,468
Mufasa is strong.

431
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:32,554
Like, way stronger than us.

432
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:34,264
-Please give me some space.
-What?

433
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:36,141
You could lay anywhere in this cave.

434
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:38,435
-Where do you want me to...?
-I need some personal space.

435
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:40,353
-Okay?
-Okay.

436
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:44,024
Not to take anything away from you.
You were great.

437
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,233
But he is...

438
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:47,360
See, now I know you're
doing this on purpose.

439
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:50,155
Very brave, too.
Tough, good energy.

440
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:52,115
-Now you're just being spiteful.
-Good posture.

441
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:53,491
Next time I see Mufasa...

442
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:56,244
I'm gonna teach him a lesson
he will never forget.

443
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:58,538
Well, you're in luck!
He's right behind ya.

444
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:00,165
Mufasa?

445
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:16,097
That's not the king.

446
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:21,393
You fools have stripped your land
of every living thing.

447
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:24,563
And yet I send two little cubs your way...

448
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:26,232
and they come back alive.

449
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:29,152
I guess we'll have to eat you instead.

450
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,862
Why eat one meal...

451
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:35,199
when you can be feasting
the rest of your lives?

452
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:38,703
What could you possibly offer us?

453
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,498
A place where you can fill your bellies.

454
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:45,668
Where everything the light touches
is yours for the kill.

455
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:47,920
The Pride Lands are not yours to give.

456
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:50,465
The king controls those hunting grounds.

457
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,311
That's why we're going to kill him.

458
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:09,192
Mufasa has always shown
too much restraint...

459
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,486
when it comes to hunting.

460
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:14,197
When I am king...

461
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:16,533
the mighty will be free to
take whatever they want.

462
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:20,370
Because a hyena's belly is never full.

463
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:23,498
Mufasa's far too powerful to challenge.

464
00:35:23,665 --> 00:35:26,668
<i>Mufasa is yesterday's message</i>

465
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:30,755
<i>A clapped-out, distracted regime</i>

466
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:34,634
<i>Whose failings undoubtedly presage</i>

467
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,722
<i>The need for a dif'rent dream</i>

468
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:42,851
<i>Yes, leonine times are a-changing</i>

469
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:47,063
<i>Which means that hyenas must too</i>

470
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:52,027
<i>My vision is clear and wide-ranging</i>

471
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:55,030
<i>And even encompasses you</i>

472
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:59,826
<i>So prepare for the coup of the century</i>

473
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:03,872
<i>Prepare for the murkiest scam</i>

474
00:36:04,873 --> 00:36:06,666
<i>Meticulous planning</i>

475
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:08,752
<i>Tenacity spanning</i>

476
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:12,422
<i>Decades of denial
Is simply why I'll</i>

477
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:14,799
<i>Be king
Undisputed</i>

478
00:36:14,966 --> 00:36:16,885
<i>Respected
Saluted</i>

479
00:36:17,052 --> 00:36:20,055
<i>And seen for the wonder I am</i>

480
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:24,559
<i>Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared</i>

481
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:26,603
<i>Be prepared</i>

482
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:31,232
<i>-Be prepared
-Be prepared</i>

483
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:33,026
<i>Be prepared
Be prepared</i>

484
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:35,236
<i>-Be prepared
-Be prepared</i>

485
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:37,030
<i>Be prepared
Be prepared</i>

486
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:40,992
<i>Be prepared</i>

487
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:47,290
<i>Be prepared</i>

488
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:53,338
<i>Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared</i>

489
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:56,925
<i>Be prepared</i>

490
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:19,739
My dad was pretty upset with me.

491
00:37:19,906 --> 00:37:21,991
That's why we're here, Simba.

492
00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:25,036
I think I know a way for you
to make it up to him.

493
00:37:25,203 --> 00:37:28,581
A gift that will make him
forget it ever happened.

494
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:31,626
But he's the king.
What could I give him?

495
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:33,336
Your roar.

496
00:37:33,503 --> 00:37:34,504
My roar?

497
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:36,047
Yes!

498
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:38,633
Did you hear that?

499
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:43,638
This gorge is where all lions come
to find their roar.

500
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:44,806
All lions?

501
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:46,599
Even my dad?

502
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:49,936
Even Mufasa came here
when he was your age.

503
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:51,521
Refused to leave...

504
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:55,567
until his roar could be heard
above the rim.

505
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:57,777
All the way up there?

506
00:37:57,944 --> 00:37:59,821
That's when you know you've found it.

507
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:01,740
With a little practice...

508
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:04,743
you'll never be called a cub again.

509
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:07,078
Watch this.

510
00:38:09,247 --> 00:38:11,207
You'll get it, Simba.

511
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:13,543
Just takes time.

512
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,378
I'll check on you later.

513
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:18,923
Dad will be so proud, won't he?

514
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,718
It's a gift he'll never forget.

515
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:08,616
Mufasa! Quick!

516
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:10,493
Stampede in the gorge!

517
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,828
Simba's down there!

518
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:13,246
Simba?

519
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:15,415
I'll find him.

520
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:43,610
Zazu!

521
00:40:43,985 --> 00:40:46,446
Hold on!
Help is coming!

522
00:40:53,536 --> 00:40:55,914
There he is!
On that tree!

523
00:40:59,584 --> 00:41:01,795
I'm coming, Simba!
Hold on!

524
00:41:07,258 --> 00:41:09,886
I'll help them, Zazu!
You get the pride!

525
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:11,262
Go!

526
00:41:37,038 --> 00:41:38,081
Dad!

527
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,083
Simba!

528
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:42,544
Come to me, son.

529
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:44,212
Jump!

530
00:42:04,357 --> 00:42:05,817
Dad!

531
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:02,415
Scar!

532
00:43:05,293 --> 00:43:06,586
Help me.

533
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:17,931
Long live the king!

534
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:26,856
No!

535
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,584
Dad?

536
00:43:55,135 --> 00:44:24,122
Dad?

537
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:29,669
Dad?

538
00:44:41,306 --> 00:44:43,391
Come on, wake up.

539
00:44:49,564 --> 00:44:53,985
Help! Somebody help!

540
00:45:25,266 --> 00:45:26,893
Simba!

541
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:29,562
What have you done?

542
00:45:31,898 --> 00:45:33,316
It was a stampede.

543
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:34,859
He tried to save me.

544
00:45:35,026 --> 00:45:37,237
It was an accident.

545
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:40,323
-I didn't mean for it to...
-Of course you didn't.

546
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,910
No one ever means
for these things to happen.

547
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:45,787
But the king is dead...

548
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:47,580
and if it weren't for you...

549
00:45:49,207 --> 00:45:51,459
he'd still be alive.

550
00:45:51,626 --> 00:45:54,379
Your father had such hopes for you...

551
00:45:54,546 --> 00:45:57,716
gave you so many chances.

552
00:45:57,882 --> 00:45:59,843
And this is how you repay him.

553
00:46:00,468 --> 00:46:03,096
I didn't know. I didn't know.

554
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,140
What will your mother think?

555
00:46:05,306 --> 00:46:08,685
A son who causes his father's death.

556
00:46:08,852 --> 00:46:13,440
A boy who kills a king.

557
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,443
What am I gonna do?

558
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:18,778
Run.

559
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,157
Run away, Simba.

560
00:46:22,574 --> 00:46:26,036
Run away and never return!

561
00:46:38,173 --> 00:46:39,466
Kill him.

562
00:47:18,129 --> 00:47:21,132
Go down and make sure he's dead.

563
00:47:28,932 --> 00:47:30,266
Seriously?

564
00:47:30,725 --> 00:47:32,102
I'm sorry.

565
00:47:34,646 --> 00:47:37,065
-That's a good distance right there.
-Okay.

566
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:41,778
No little cub could survive that fall.

567
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:43,905
Listen, we're gonna tell her...

568
00:47:44,072 --> 00:47:47,033
we went down there
and we ate him.

569
00:47:47,492 --> 00:47:48,952
That's perfect,
'cause I am starving!

570
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,662
We're not gonna eat him.

571
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:51,996
Simba is dead.

572
00:47:52,163 --> 00:47:54,582
That's all she ever has to know.

573
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:57,836
Works for me.

574
00:48:52,182 --> 00:48:57,145
Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy.

575
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,315
The greatest leader
the pride has ever known.

576
00:49:00,982 --> 00:49:02,984
To lose a brother...

577
00:49:03,485 --> 00:49:08,114
such a deep, personal loss.

578
00:49:09,074 --> 00:49:12,827
And little Simba,
who had barely begun to live.

579
00:49:12,994 --> 00:49:16,539
A cub whose blood held our future.

580
00:49:16,706 --> 00:49:19,876
It's almost too much to endure.

581
00:49:20,919 --> 00:49:24,047
I only wish
I had gotten to the gorge in time...

582
00:49:24,214 --> 00:49:27,217
been there to save them.

583
00:49:28,468 --> 00:49:32,889
And so it is with a heavy heart...

584
00:49:33,515 --> 00:49:35,684
that I must assume the throne.

585
00:49:36,226 --> 00:49:38,937
Mufasa and Simba are gone...

586
00:49:39,104 --> 00:49:43,024
which means I am your king.

587
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:46,945
But I must admit...

588
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:49,864
I cannot bear this burden alone.

589
00:49:51,324 --> 00:49:53,535
And I will need some help...

590
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:57,831
to ensure the safety of the pride.

591
00:50:05,296 --> 00:50:08,341
Nala, stay close.

592
00:50:08,633 --> 00:50:12,679
And so, from the ashes of this tragedy...

593
00:50:12,846 --> 00:50:17,017
we shall welcome
the dawning of a new era.

594
00:50:17,475 --> 00:50:18,810
A great...

595
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:22,856
and glorious future!

596
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:35,201
Oh, dear.

597
00:52:20,724 --> 00:52:21,766
I missed 'em!

598
00:52:21,933 --> 00:52:23,643
I'm gonna get one of those vultures one day.

599
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:24,728
I'm gonna get one!

600
00:52:24,894 --> 00:52:26,479
I don't know why it's so important to you.

601
00:52:26,646 --> 00:52:28,857
I just feel like it would
make me feel better.

602
00:52:29,733 --> 00:52:31,026
Oh, no. It's a little lion!

603
00:52:31,192 --> 00:52:33,278
-That is not a lion.
-Well then, go check it out.

604
00:52:33,445 --> 00:52:35,238
-What is it?
-That is not a lion, it's a furry bird!

605
00:52:35,405 --> 00:52:36,698
It looks like a lion!

606
00:52:36,865 --> 00:52:39,576
That's not a lion.
Let me get a closer look. Excuse me.

607
00:52:40,035 --> 00:52:42,287
All right, let me see
what we're dealing with here.

608
00:52:42,454 --> 00:52:43,455
It's a lion!

609
00:52:43,621 --> 00:52:44,956
-Run for your life, Pumbaa!
-Wait! Hey, Timon.

610
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:47,834
Wait, Timon, wait! It's a little lion!

611
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:49,210
It gets bigger.

612
00:52:49,377 --> 00:52:51,212
Can we keep him?
Can we please keep him?

613
00:52:51,379 --> 00:52:53,256
Okay. I promise I'll walk him every day!

614
00:52:53,423 --> 00:52:54,716
If he makes a little mess, I'll clean it up.

615
00:52:54,883 --> 00:52:55,967
You'll be his little mess!

616
00:52:56,134 --> 00:52:58,178
He's gonna eat you and then
use my body as a toothpick!

617
00:52:58,345 --> 00:53:01,639
But one day, when he's big and strong,
he'll be on our side!

618
00:53:01,806 --> 00:53:04,142
I've got it.
What if he's on our side?

619
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:05,518
Hear me out!

620
00:53:05,685 --> 00:53:09,689
Having a ferocious lion around
might not be such a bad idea!

621
00:53:09,856 --> 00:53:11,149
Well then, can we keep him?

622
00:53:11,316 --> 00:53:12,567
Yes, of course we can keep him!

623
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:15,278
My God, who is the brains of this operation?

624
00:53:15,445 --> 00:53:17,238
<i>We're gonna name him Fred!</i>

625
00:53:17,405 --> 00:53:19,157
Who are you?

626
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:22,369
-We're the guys who saved your life.
-Yes.

627
00:53:22,535 --> 00:53:24,746
Risked everything.
Fought off angry vultures!

628
00:53:24,913 --> 00:53:26,539
Hordes of them. Flocks.

629
00:53:26,706 --> 00:53:28,041
I'm Pumbaa.

630
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:30,794
-This is Timon.
-Did I mention that we saved your life?

631
00:53:31,044 --> 00:53:33,004
It doesn't matter.

632
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:38,093
How bleak is that?
It doesn't even matter?

633
00:53:38,259 --> 00:53:40,428
Like I don't have enough
that I'm dealing with, right?

634
00:53:40,595 --> 00:53:42,013
Now his problems are my problems?

635
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,848
But we can help him.
We're in a position to help him.

636
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:48,353
So, how are you,
in as few words as possible?

637
00:53:48,812 --> 00:53:50,730
I did something terrible.

638
00:53:50,897 --> 00:53:52,732
I don't wanna talk about it.

639
00:53:52,899 --> 00:53:55,527
Look, kid, we've all made mistakes.

640
00:53:55,694 --> 00:53:58,321
There must be something we can do, right?

641
00:53:58,488 --> 00:54:00,490
Not unless you can change the past.

642
00:54:00,657 --> 00:54:02,033
Well, you know, that's a lot to ask...

643
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,035
-That's pretty hard. That's a biggie.
-...if I'm being honest.

644
00:54:04,202 --> 00:54:05,829
I mean, change the past?
It already happened.

645
00:54:05,995 --> 00:54:07,664
Yeah, so you can't change that.

646
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:09,124
But you know what you can change?

647
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:12,168
The future. That's our specialty.

648
00:54:12,335 --> 00:54:13,670
Kind of our thing.

649
00:54:13,837 --> 00:54:16,256
How can you change something
that hasn't happened?

650
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:20,051
Well, to change the future,
you gotta put your past behind you.

651
00:54:20,218 --> 00:54:21,136
Way behind.

652
00:54:21,302 --> 00:54:25,974
Look, kid, bad things happen
and you can't do anything about it, right?

653
00:54:26,141 --> 00:54:26,891
Right.

654
00:54:27,058 --> 00:54:29,644
Wrong!
When the world turns its back on you...

655
00:54:29,811 --> 00:54:31,604
you turn your back on the world!

656
00:54:32,188 --> 00:54:33,982
And only embrace what's next!

657
00:54:34,149 --> 00:54:36,026
And turn the "what" into "so what?"

658
00:54:36,192 --> 00:54:38,319
Well, that's not what I was taught.

659
00:54:38,486 --> 00:54:40,363
Well, then maybe you need a new lesson.

660
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:44,993
Repeat after me, kid.
<i>Hakuna matata</i>.

663
00:54:49,205 --> 00:54:51,416
Most people get a bigger reaction
when we say it the first...

664
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:54,461
-Okay, well anyway. <i>Hakuna matata.
</i>-Some people start clapping immediately.

665
00:54:54,627 --> 00:54:56,880
It means "no worries."
One and a...

666
00:54:57,047 --> 00:54:59,090
I do the counting here.

667
00:54:59,257 --> 00:55:01,092
-I wanna count!
-Why don't we count together?

668
00:55:01,259 --> 00:55:02,385
-Okay, that's a good idea.
-All right.

-Nothin'. What's-a-motto with you?

680
00:55:37,962 --> 00:55:39,089
-Nice.
-Boom!

681
00:55:39,255 --> 00:55:41,675
Those two words
will solve all your problems.

682
00:55:41,841 --> 00:55:44,260
Yeah. Take Pumbaa here.

683
00:55:44,552 --> 00:55:48,181
<i>Why, when he was a young warthog</i>

<i>When I was a young warthog</i>

685
00:55:53,311 --> 00:55:55,397
-How are you feeling?
-It's an emotional story.

686
00:55:55,563 --> 00:55:58,191
<i>He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal</i>

690

I was always here for you
and I resent that.

691
00:56:15,583 --> 00:56:18,086
<i>-And, oh, the shame
-Yes, he was ashamed</i>

692
00:56:18,253 --> 00:56:19,796

693

Welcome to our humble home.

00:57:02,756 --> 00:57:04,007
You live here?

709
00:57:04,174 --> 00:57:05,467
Well, we live wherever we want.

710
00:57:05,633 --> 00:57:06,926
We do as we please.

711
00:57:07,093 --> 00:57:08,136
It's beautiful.

712
00:57:08,303 --> 00:57:10,305
Yeah, it's really nice, huh?

713
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:13,767
Everyone, this is Simba.

714
00:57:13,975 --> 00:57:15,852
That, my friend, is a lion.

715
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:18,355
What about food?
Have you thought about feeding that thing?

716
00:57:18,521 --> 00:57:21,024
Yeah, I'm starved!
I could eat a whole zebra.

717
00:57:21,191 --> 00:57:22,192
Here we go.

718
00:57:22,567 --> 00:57:25,153
No, no, no, kid,
we're fresh out of zebra.

719
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,488
Any antelope?

720
00:57:26,654 --> 00:57:28,406
-Uh-oh.
-No, listen, kid...

721
00:57:28,573 --> 00:57:30,658
if you want to live with us,
you have to eat like us.

722
00:57:30,825 --> 00:57:33,703
And most importantly,
not eat us!

723
00:57:34,204 --> 00:57:37,290
This looks like a good spot
to rustle up some grub!

724
00:57:39,334 --> 00:57:40,335
-Yeah!
-It's perfect!

725
00:57:40,502 --> 00:57:41,711
Step aside, fellas!

726
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:43,171
What's that?

727
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:44,381
Too chewy.

728
00:57:44,547 --> 00:57:45,965
This one's got some nuttiness!

729
00:57:46,424 --> 00:57:48,593
Now that's what I call umami!

730
00:57:49,052 --> 00:57:52,180
-Slimy, yet satisfying.
-Extra crunchy.

731
00:57:52,347 --> 00:57:53,807
-They're local.
-Yeah. Are they?

732
00:57:53,973 --> 00:57:55,058
They're from right there.

733
00:57:55,225 --> 00:57:57,477
I'm telling ya, kid,
this is the great life.

734
00:57:57,644 --> 00:57:58,645

No responsibilities.

736
00:58:02,107 --> 00:58:04,984

-I love these.

-Well, kid?

But you are our queen!

790
01:01:33,902 --> 01:01:35,987
We should leave before it's too late!

791
01:01:36,154 --> 01:01:40,283
We must all stay together

Won't you join me, Sarabi?

801
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,157
There's plenty to go around.

802
01:02:21,449 --> 01:02:23,201
You're overhunting, Scar.

803
01:02:23,368 --> 01:02:25,412
I've simply perfected the kill.

804
01:02:26,329 --> 01:02:27,831
With the help of my army.

805
01:02:27,997 --> 01:02:30,166
You're killing everything.

Don't you see?
There is nobody to challenge me.

807

Long ago you chose Mufasa over me.

But now there is a new king.

811
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:46,975
So stop being so selfish.

812
01:02:47,392 --> 01:02:49,144
You are the selfish one.

813
01:02:49,310 --> 01:02:51,271
The other lions look to you.

814
01:02:51,438 --> 01:02:54,357
As long as you resist they will reject me.

815
01:02:55,233 --> 01:02:59,738
Take your place by my side,
and we will feast together.

816
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,241
I will never be your queen!

817
01:03:04,993 --> 01:03:06,661
Then from now on...

818
01:03:06,828 --> 01:03:10,957
the lions will eat after the hyenas.

819
01:03:11,207 --> 01:03:13,793
And they don't leave much behind.

820
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,803
Just what do you think
you are doing, young lady?

821
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:48,346
Go away, Zazu.

822
01:04:48,513 --> 01:04:50,223
I'm going to find help.

823
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:52,142
I will very much not go away.

824
01:04:52,308 --> 01:04:55,770
I am sworn to protect you and
must order you back to bed.

825
01:04:55,937 --> 01:04:58,606
I don't need protecting anymore.

826
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:51,659
Scar! Wonderful to see you.

827
01:05:52,452 --> 01:05:53,828
Sorry to drop in like this!

828
01:05:55,497 --> 01:06:00,460
Have I ever told you about my brother
who thought he was a woodpecker?

829
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:15,725
Nala...

830
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:41,126
I'm gonna get ya!

831
01:06:41,292 --> 01:06:43,003
I'm gonna get ya!
I got ya!

832
01:06:44,754 --> 01:06:46,548
Simba! It's you!

833
01:06:46,715 --> 01:06:49,551
Did you see that?
Man, that butterfly was right there!

834
01:06:49,718 --> 01:06:50,844
I almost had him.

835
01:06:51,177 --> 01:06:53,888
I thought it was a lion.
You know, the other kind of lion.

836
01:06:54,347 --> 01:06:55,682
You know, a real lion?

837
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:59,352
I mean, not that you're not a real lion.
But you know, the kind that eats...

838
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:00,729
I'm gonna go.

839
01:07:01,646 --> 01:07:03,273
Hey, where you going?

840
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,650
You wanna get some grubs?

841
01:07:08,528 --> 01:07:10,280
What's up with that guy?

842
01:07:10,447 --> 01:07:11,281
Simba...

843
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:13,742
How can I say this?

844
01:07:13,908 --> 01:07:15,660
-He's prey.
-Yeah.

845
01:07:15,827 --> 01:07:19,914
And he is never gonna want to
frolic with a carnivore.

846
01:07:20,081 --> 01:07:22,042
No. You two will never frolic.

847
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:23,877
Why not?

848
01:07:24,044 --> 01:07:28,256
You see, in nature
there's a delicate balance.

849
01:07:28,423 --> 01:07:30,300
Yeah. The circle of life. I know that.

850
01:07:30,467 --> 01:07:32,344
-No.
-No, no, no. I don't know...

851
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:34,012
-where you're getting "circle" from.
-No, yeah.

852
01:07:34,179 --> 01:07:36,431
-There's no circle of life. No, not at all.
-No, it's no circle.

853
01:07:36,598 --> 01:07:38,808
-In fact, it's the opposite.
-Yeah.

854
01:07:38,975 --> 01:07:40,101
-It's a line.
-Yeah.

855
01:07:40,268 --> 01:07:42,771
It's a meaningless line of indifference.

856
01:07:42,937 --> 01:07:45,357
And we're all just running
towards the end of the line.

857
01:07:45,523 --> 01:07:48,777
And then one day we'll reach the end,
and that'll be it.

858
01:07:48,943 --> 01:07:50,028
-That's it.
-Line over!

859
01:07:50,195 --> 01:07:51,946
-Nothing.
-Nada.

860
01:07:52,113 --> 01:07:53,281
And you can really just kinda...

861
01:07:53,448 --> 01:07:55,158
do your own thing and fend for yourself...

862
01:07:55,325 --> 01:07:57,118
'cause your line doesn't affect
anyone else's lines.

863
01:07:57,285 --> 01:07:59,496
You're alive and then you're not.
Like this guy.

864
01:08:01,081 --> 01:08:02,707
You sure it's not a circle?

865
01:08:03,249 --> 01:08:04,876
That we're all connected?

866
01:08:05,043 --> 01:08:07,295
A circle would mean we're all this.

867
01:08:07,462 --> 01:08:09,756
That would mean what I do affects him...

868
01:08:09,923 --> 01:08:12,967
-affects that thing, affects that thing.
-Yeah. No. That's not how it goes.

869
01:08:13,134 --> 01:08:16,054
Which would make doing whatever we wanted
not that cool.

870
01:08:16,221 --> 01:08:17,680
Let me simplify this for you.

871
01:08:17,846 --> 01:08:19,557
-Life is meaningless.
-Yes.

872
01:08:19,724 --> 01:08:21,559
That's why you just gotta
look out for yourself.

873
01:08:21,725 --> 01:08:23,103
That's why you do you, Simba.

874
01:08:23,269 --> 01:08:25,479
Yeah, Simba, for the first time...

875
01:08:25,647 --> 01:08:27,941
we're entrusting you to
make a plan for us today.

876
01:08:28,108 --> 01:08:30,734
This is important.
Think about all you've been taught.

877
01:08:30,902 --> 01:08:32,862
What do you wanna do?

878
01:08:33,904 --> 01:08:36,700
Absolutely nothing.

879
01:08:38,243 --> 01:08:39,868
Exactly!
He gets it!

880
01:08:40,036 --> 01:08:41,705
Jackpot!

881
01:08:41,871 --> 01:08:42,788
Out of my way! Out of my way!

882
01:08:42,956 --> 01:08:45,582
-Crunchy!
-All right! Time to eat!

883
01:08:58,345 --> 01:08:59,596
Hello!

884
01:09:00,557 --> 01:09:02,392
Nice one, Simba.

885
01:09:02,559 --> 01:09:05,185
Thanks.
Must've been the termites.

886
01:09:05,937 --> 01:09:07,188
Or the crickets.

887
01:09:08,606 --> 01:09:11,317
And you wonder why I prefer
to sleep underground.

888
01:09:11,984 --> 01:09:13,778
Hey, Timon.

889
01:09:13,944 --> 01:09:17,615
Do you ever look up there and wonder
what those sparkly dots are?

890
01:09:17,782 --> 01:09:21,493
Pumbaa. I don't wonder.
I know.

891
01:09:21,661 --> 01:09:23,662
Really? What are they?

892
01:09:23,997 --> 01:09:25,540
They're fireflies.

893
01:09:25,707 --> 01:09:29,711
Fireflies that got stuck
on that big, bluish-black thing.

894
01:09:31,004 --> 01:09:32,255
I guess that makes sense.

895
01:09:32,421 --> 01:09:36,551
I always thought they were balls of gas
burning billions of miles away.

896
01:09:36,718 --> 01:09:39,054
Pumbaa,
why is everything always gas with you?

897
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:40,638
I know.

898
01:09:41,055 --> 01:09:42,640
-What do you think, Simba?
-Yeah.

899
01:09:42,807 --> 01:09:45,018
I don't know.

900
01:09:46,102 --> 01:09:48,104
But somebody once told me...

901
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:50,482
the great kings of the past are up there...

902
01:09:50,648 --> 01:09:53,693
and they're all watching over us.

903
01:09:58,114 --> 01:10:01,618
That's a good one!
That's insane!

904
01:10:01,785 --> 01:10:03,620
That's insane!

905
01:10:04,788 --> 01:10:06,790
Royal dead guys watching over us!

906
01:10:06,956 --> 01:10:08,917
Well, I hope they don't
fall out of the sky!

907
01:10:09,084 --> 01:10:11,628
Hang on, Your Majesty!
Don't let go!

908
01:10:11,795 --> 01:10:13,129
That would be a mess.

909
01:10:13,296 --> 01:10:15,423
-Oh, man!
-I mean, Simba, think about it.

910
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:17,926
Why would a bunch of kings
be looking out for us?

911
01:10:18,093 --> 01:10:20,095
-We're outcasts.
-Royal warthogs!

912
01:10:20,261 --> 01:10:22,806
-I can't! I can't!
-I can't! I actually can't.

913
01:10:22,972 --> 01:10:26,601
-I can't.
-No, you can. I can't.

914
01:10:28,019 --> 01:10:30,730
Yeah. Yeah.

915
01:10:30,897 --> 01:10:32,899
Yeah.

916
01:10:33,066 --> 01:10:34,609
That's stupid.

917
01:10:34,776 --> 01:10:38,780
I'm gonna go get some grubs or something.

918
01:10:45,787 --> 01:10:48,331
-What did you say to him?
-I don't know.

919
01:10:48,498 --> 01:10:51,209
As you were saying it, I thought,
"This won't end well."

920
01:10:51,376 --> 01:10:53,628
-You just start laughing.
-You laughed too.

921
01:10:53,795 --> 01:10:56,798
I did not. I would never.

922
01:10:57,298 --> 01:10:59,300
Man, I blew it.

923
01:14:04,903 --> 01:14:06,529
Simba.

924
01:14:11,785 --> 01:14:15,413
Simba is alive!

925
01:14:40,271 --> 01:14:44,984

948
01:16:01,186 --> 01:16:03,146
Run for your life!

949
01:16:04,856 --> 01:16:05,857
Run, Pumbaa, run!

950
01:16:12,489 --> 01:16:13,448
Timon, help!

951
01:16:14,908 --> 01:16:16,242
Pumbaa!

952
01:16:18,036 --> 01:16:19,204
Pumbaa?

953
01:16:19,496 --> 01:16:20,914
I'm gonna die!

954
01:16:22,499 --> 01:16:24,125
I'm coming, Pumbaa!
Hang in there!

955
01:16:26,002 --> 01:16:27,879
Move! Move! Move!

956
01:16:38,682 --> 01:16:39,683
No!

957
01:16:40,725 --> 01:16:42,102
Oh, no! Oh, no!

958
01:16:42,644 --> 01:16:43,603
No!

959
01:17:02,288 --> 01:17:03,248
Nala?

960
01:17:04,624 --> 01:17:05,750
Simba?

961
01:17:06,376 --> 01:17:08,128
Is that really you?

962
01:17:08,294 --> 01:17:09,462
Yeah.

963
01:17:09,629 --> 01:17:11,464
It's me, Simba!

964
01:17:14,050 --> 01:17:15,885
-Nala, what're you doing? Oh, my...
-I don't believe it!

965
01:17:16,052 --> 01:17:17,303
Look at you!

966
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:18,430
Pumbaa...

967
01:17:18,513 --> 01:17:20,140
I don't think you're getting eaten.

968
01:17:20,473 --> 01:17:22,183
Where have you been?

969
01:17:22,350 --> 01:17:23,810
I thought you were dead!

970
01:17:24,769 --> 01:17:26,855
You thought he was dead.
I thought I was dead!

971
01:17:27,022 --> 01:17:29,024
I thought you were gonna eat me.

972
01:17:30,275 --> 01:17:31,151
What fun!

973
01:17:31,317 --> 01:17:34,446
I'm so sorry, before we move on,
how do you two know each other?

974
01:17:34,612 --> 01:17:35,697
Timon, Pumbaa...

975
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:37,782
I want you to meet my best friend, Nala.

976
01:17:37,949 --> 01:17:40,285
Best friend? Well, that hurts.

977
01:17:40,618 --> 01:17:42,037
Nala, you're gonna love it here!

978
01:17:42,203 --> 01:17:44,873
This place is amazing.
It's everything you could ever want.

979
01:17:45,373 --> 01:17:47,250
Simba, we need to leave.

980
01:17:47,417 --> 01:17:50,378
Scar has taken over with the hyenas.

981
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,590
You have to take your place as king.

982
01:17:53,757 --> 01:17:55,050
King? Simba?

983
01:17:55,383 --> 01:17:57,719
We kneel before you as loyal servants.

984
01:17:57,886 --> 01:17:59,846
Pumbaa, relax.
She's wrong.

985
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:02,307
-Lady, you've got your lions crossed.
-Nice.

986
01:18:02,474 --> 01:18:06,019
Seeing you again, you don't know
what this will mean to everyone.

987
01:18:06,186 --> 01:18:08,271
What this means to me.

988
01:18:08,521 --> 01:18:10,523
You have to come home.

989
01:18:10,732 --> 01:18:12,734
This is my home.

990
01:18:13,485 --> 01:18:14,778
Please stay.

991
01:18:14,944 --> 01:18:16,446
This place is incredible.

992
01:18:16,613 --> 01:18:18,239
I know you'll love it.

993
01:18:18,406 --> 01:18:19,783
I can't.

994
01:18:19,949 --> 01:18:21,242
Come on!

995
01:18:21,409 --> 01:18:23,203
At least let me show you around.

996
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:25,372
Where are you going?

997
01:18:31,628 --> 01:18:35,590
Simba, it's so beautiful.

998
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:38,635
<i>I can see what's happening</i>

999
01:18:38,802 --> 01:18:39,803
I can't. What?

1000
01:18:39,969 --> 01:18:41,680
<i>And they don't have a clue</i>

1001
01:18:41,846 --> 01:18:42,681
Who's "they"?

1002
01:18:42,847 --> 01:18:46,184
<i>They'll fall in love
And here's the bottom line</i>

1003
01:18:46,726 --> 01:18:48,561
<i>Our trio's down to two</i>

1004
01:18:48,728 --> 01:18:49,479
I get it.

1005
01:18:49,646 --> 01:18:51,481
<i>The sweet caress of twilight</i>

1006
01:18:51,648 --> 01:18:52,315
Yeah.

1007
01:18:52,482 --> 01:18:54,442
<i>There's magic ev'rywhere</i>

1008
01:18:54,651 --> 01:18:55,694
It's ev'rywhere.

1009
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:59,698
<i>And with all this romantic atmosphere</i>

1010
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:04,786
<i>Disaster's in the air</i>

1011
01:19:08,623 --> 01:19:13,628
<i>Can you feel the love tonight?</i>

1012
01:19:15,463 --> 01:19:19,718
<i>The peace the evening brings</i>

1013
01:19:20,927 --> 01:19:27,100
<i>The world for once in perfect harmony</i>

1014
01:19:27,267 --> 01:19:31,855
<i>With all its living things</i>

1015
01:19:33,565 --> 01:19:36,359
<i>So many things to tell her</i>

1016
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:42,490
<i>But how to make her see
The truth about my past?</i>

1017
01:19:42,657 --> 01:19:43,742
<i>Impossible</i>

1018
01:19:43,908 --> 01:19:45,827
<i>She'd turn away from me</i>

1019
01:19:46,369 --> 01:19:48,913
<i>He's holding back, he's hiding</i>

1020
01:19:49,414 --> 01:19:52,709
<i>But what, I can't decide</i>

1021
01:19:52,876 --> 01:19:55,920
<i>Why won't he be the king I know he is?</i>

1022
01:19:56,171 --> 01:19:59,924
<i>The king I see inside?</i>

1023
01:20:00,717 --> 01:20:05,680
<i>Can you feel the love tonight?</i>

1024
01:20:07,390 --> 01:20:11,978
<i>The peace the evening brings</i>

1025
01:20:13,313 --> 01:20:19,152
<i>The world for once in perfect harmony</i>

1026
01:20:19,527 --> 01:20:23,740
<i>With all its living things</i>

1027
01:20:26,201 --> 01:20:31,373
<i>Can you feel the love tonight?</i>

1028
01:20:33,124 --> 01:20:38,004
<i>You needn't look too far</i>

1029
01:20:39,589 --> 01:20:45,011
<i>Stealing through the night's uncertainties</i>

1030
01:20:45,178 --> 01:20:49,683
<i>Love is where they are</i>

1031
01:20:51,351 --> 01:20:57,315
<i>And if he falls in love tonight</i>

1032
01:20:58,817 --> 01:21:02,946
<i>It can be assumed</i>

1033
01:21:04,739 --> 01:21:09,994
<i>His carefree days with us are history</i>

1034
01:21:10,453 --> 01:21:17,210
<i>In short, our pal is doomed</i>

1035
01:21:31,099 --> 01:21:33,476
I told you.
Isn't it great here?

1036
01:21:33,643 --> 01:21:35,520
You know,
maybe it could be like this forever.

1037
01:21:35,687 --> 01:21:37,522
It's amazing.

1038
01:21:37,939 --> 01:21:41,151
But there's something I don't understand.

1039
01:21:41,317 --> 01:21:43,570
If you've been alive all this time...

1040
01:21:43,737 --> 01:21:45,655
why haven't you come home?

1041
01:21:45,822 --> 01:21:47,907
We've really needed you.

1042
01:21:48,074 --> 01:21:49,492
They're fine, all right?

1043
01:21:49,659 --> 01:21:50,994
Nobody needs me.

1044
01:21:51,161 --> 01:21:52,871
You're the king.

1045
01:21:53,038 --> 01:21:55,707
Nala, Scar is the king.

1046
01:21:55,874 --> 01:21:58,752
Simba, he's decimated the Pride Lands.

1047
01:21:58,918 --> 01:22:00,712
There's no food, no water...

1048
01:22:00,879 --> 01:22:02,797
There's nothing I can do.

1049
01:22:02,964 --> 01:22:04,507
What about your mother?

1050
01:22:04,674 --> 01:22:06,634
This is your responsibility.

1051
01:22:06,801 --> 01:22:08,178
You need to challenge Scar.

1052
01:22:08,345 --> 01:22:11,181
I can't go back. Ever.

1053
01:22:11,348 --> 01:22:12,557
Why?

1054
01:22:12,724 --> 01:22:14,476
Because of what happened at the gorge?

1055
01:22:14,642 --> 01:22:15,769
Scar told us that...

1056
01:22:15,935 --> 01:22:17,145
You wouldn't understand!

1057
01:22:17,312 --> 01:22:18,730
None of it matters. Okay?

1058
01:22:18,897 --> 01:22:20,231
<i>Hakuna matata.</i>

1059
01:22:20,398 --> 01:22:21,399
What?

1060
01:22:21,566 --> 01:22:23,318
It's something I learned out here, okay?

1061
01:22:23,485 --> 01:22:26,821
You see, sometimes bad things happen,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

1062
01:22:26,988 --> 01:22:28,448
So, why worry?

1063
01:22:28,698 --> 01:22:30,575
Why worry?

1064
01:22:30,742 --> 01:22:32,619
What happened to you?

1065
01:22:32,786 --> 01:22:35,080
You're not the Simba I remember.

1066
01:22:35,288 --> 01:22:37,957
And I never will be.
Are you satisfied?

1067
01:22:38,124 --> 01:22:39,834
No, I'm disappointed.

1068
01:22:40,001 --> 01:22:42,128
You know, now you're starting to
sound like my father.

1069
01:22:42,295 --> 01:22:44,964
Good. I'm glad one of us does.

1070
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:48,051
You have no idea what I've been through!

1071
01:22:48,218 --> 01:22:50,804
I came here looking for help.

1072
01:22:52,597 --> 01:22:55,016
I guess I made a mistake.

1073
01:22:56,101 --> 01:22:57,811
Goodbye, Simba.

1074
01:23:14,494 --> 01:23:15,912
"Disappointed"?

1075
01:23:16,621 --> 01:23:18,707
She wants me to go home?

1076
01:23:18,873 --> 01:23:20,834
I am home.

1077
01:23:21,418 --> 01:23:22,877
"Best friend"?

1078
01:23:23,044 --> 01:23:25,338
I don't need best friends.
I don't need anybody.

1079
01:23:25,922 --> 01:23:27,298
Never did.

1080
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,286
Go away.

1081
01:23:56,453 --> 01:23:58,997
Going away will not answer the question.

1082
01:23:59,164 --> 01:24:01,791
What question?
Who are you?

1083
01:24:02,208 --> 01:24:04,169
I know exactly who I am.

1084
01:24:04,336 --> 01:24:06,755
The question is, who are you?

1085
01:24:07,505 --> 01:24:11,217
I'm nobody. So leave me alone.
All right?

1086
01:24:11,593 --> 01:24:15,555
Everybody is somebody.
Even a nobody.

1087
01:24:15,930 --> 01:24:17,766
Yeah, I think you're confused.

1088
01:24:18,892 --> 01:24:20,435
I am confused?

1089
01:24:20,894 --> 01:24:23,438
You don't even know who you are.

1090
01:24:23,605 --> 01:24:25,565
And I suppose you do?

1091
01:24:27,567 --> 01:24:29,778
I held the son of Mufasa.

1092
01:24:32,155 --> 01:24:33,448
You knew my father?

1093
01:24:33,615 --> 01:24:34,532
Correction.

1094
01:24:34,699 --> 01:24:36,451
I know your father.

1095
01:24:36,618 --> 01:24:38,787
He died a long time ago.

1096
01:24:38,953 --> 01:24:40,497
He's alive!

1097
01:24:40,997 --> 01:24:42,707
And I can take you to him.

1098
01:24:43,249 --> 01:24:44,834
Follow me. I will show you!

1099
01:24:45,001 --> 01:24:45,752
Hey, hey, hey!

1100
01:24:45,919 --> 01:24:47,170
If you can keep up!

1101
01:24:47,879 --> 01:24:49,297
Wait!

1102
01:24:58,890 --> 01:25:00,433
Follow me!

1103
01:25:07,148 --> 01:25:09,609
Quickly, quickly!
Come through!

1104
01:25:13,613 --> 01:25:15,073
Hey! Slow down!

1105
01:25:17,659 --> 01:25:20,245
Hey, you better hurry.

1106
01:25:20,537 --> 01:25:23,164
Hold on. I'm coming, I'm coming.

1107
01:25:43,184 --> 01:25:44,519
Come.

1108
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:57,157
Your father is waiting.

1109
01:26:09,294 --> 01:26:11,129
Do you see him?

1110
01:26:12,422 --> 01:26:14,632
I don't see anything.

1111
01:26:16,634 --> 01:26:17,969
Look closer.

1112
01:26:23,266 --> 01:26:25,101
You see?

1113
01:26:26,311 --> 01:26:28,897
He lives in you.

1114
01:26:31,566 --> 01:26:33,276
<i>Simba.</i>

1115
01:26:39,407 --> 01:26:40,784
Dad?

1116
01:26:41,534 --> 01:26:43,203
<i>Simba.</i>

1117
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:48,166
<i>You must take your place
in the circle of life.</i>

1118
01:26:49,751 --> 01:26:50,669
I can't.

1119
01:26:50,835 --> 01:26:53,797
<i>You must remember who you are.</i>

1120
01:26:53,963 --> 01:26:56,341
<i>The one true king.</i>

1121
01:26:56,508 --> 01:26:57,592
I'm sorry.

1122
01:26:58,885 --> 01:27:00,804
I don't know how to be like you.

1123
01:27:01,388 --> 01:27:05,433
<i>As king, I was most proud of one thing.</i>

1124
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:08,144
<i>Having you as my son.</i>

1125
01:27:10,438 --> 01:27:12,565
That was a long time ago.

1126
01:27:12,941 --> 01:27:16,861
<i>No, Simba. That is forever.</i>

1127
01:27:19,989 --> 01:27:21,408
Please.

1128
01:27:21,574 --> 01:27:23,326
Don't leave me again.

1129
01:27:23,702 --> 01:27:25,745
<i>I never left you.</i>

1130
01:27:25,912 --> 01:27:28,039
<i>And never will.</i>

1131
01:27:29,499 --> 01:27:32,085
<i>Remember who you are.</i>

1132
01:27:34,462 --> 01:27:36,715
<i>Remember.</i>

1133
01:27:46,141 --> 01:27:48,852
And so, I ask again.

1134
01:27:49,019 --> 01:27:50,061
Who are you?

1135
01:27:52,564 --> 01:27:54,649
I am Simba.

1136
01:27:54,816 --> 01:27:57,068
Son of Mufasa.

1137
01:28:22,177 --> 01:28:26,181
<i>Yeah
Spirit</i>

1138
01:28:27,098 --> 01:28:30,685
<i>Watch the heavens open</i>

1139
01:28:32,687 --> 01:28:34,773
<i>Yeah</i>

1140
01:28:35,231 --> 01:28:38,360
<i>Spirit</i>

1141
01:28:38,943 --> 01:28:42,655
<i>Can you hear it calling?</i>

1142
01:28:44,199 --> 01:28:46,534
<i>Yeah</i>

1143
01:28:49,245 --> 01:28:50,288
Simba?

1144
01:28:50,455 --> 01:28:52,791
Come on!
What are you waiting for?

1145
01:28:52,999 --> 01:28:54,501
Let's go home!

1146
01:28:59,130 --> 01:29:02,425
<i>Spirit</i>

1147
01:29:03,093 --> 01:29:07,764
<i>Watch the heavens open, open</i>

1148
01:29:07,931 --> 01:29:10,684
<i>Yeah</i>

1149
01:29:11,559 --> 01:29:14,938
<i>Your destiny is coming close</i>

1150
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:18,233
<i>Stand up and fight</i>

1151
01:29:22,195 --> 01:29:28,159
<i>So, go in to a far-off land</i>

1152
01:29:28,326 --> 01:29:34,708
<i>And be one with the great I am</i>

1153
01:29:47,262 --> 01:29:49,556
I didn't wanna believe you.

1154
01:29:49,723 --> 01:29:51,808
So, what are you gonna do?

1155
01:29:51,975 --> 01:29:55,562
My father once told me to
protect everything the light touches.

1156
01:29:55,729 --> 01:29:58,440
If I don't fight for it, who will?

1157
01:29:59,858 --> 01:30:01,443
I will.

1158
01:30:01,609 --> 01:30:03,153
It's going to be dangerous.

1159
01:30:03,319 --> 01:30:04,654
Danger?

1160
01:30:05,363 --> 01:30:08,575
I laugh in the face of danger.

1161
01:30:11,244 --> 01:30:13,246
It can't be!

1162
01:30:14,456 --> 01:30:16,374
Hello, Zazu.

1163
01:30:16,666 --> 01:30:18,501
Your Majesty.

1164
01:30:19,044 --> 01:30:20,420
Welcome home.

1165
01:30:23,882 --> 01:30:26,301
-We're here!
-Everyone, calm down. We're here.

1166
01:30:26,468 --> 01:30:28,219
The backup has arrived!

1167
01:30:28,386 --> 01:30:29,929
What are you guys doing here?

1168
01:30:30,764 --> 01:30:33,266
-We were not worried!
-No, not worried.

1169
01:30:33,433 --> 01:30:35,018
-'Cause no worries.
-Nope. <i>Hakuna matata.</i>

1170
01:30:35,185 --> 01:30:38,605
-We were concerned, because...
-Because, you know...

1171
01:30:38,772 --> 01:30:40,065
You're our friend.

1172
01:30:40,273 --> 01:30:42,984
What about
the meaningless line of indifference?

1173
01:30:43,276 --> 01:30:44,527
Well, we were thinking...

1174
01:30:44,694 --> 01:30:46,738
-maybe it curves a little bit.
-That's a good point.

1175
01:30:46,905 --> 01:30:50,116
I mean, Simba, look, I'm happy
to admit when Pumbaa's wrong...

1176
01:30:50,283 --> 01:30:52,410
-and this is one of those instances.
-What? That wasn't my thing.

1177
01:30:52,577 --> 01:30:53,703
You told me about the line.

1178
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:54,829
Wait, hold on.

1179
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,832
Now, this is the place you're fighting for?

1180
01:30:57,999 --> 01:31:00,251
Yes, Timon.
This is my home.

1181
01:31:00,418 --> 01:31:02,587
Is it behind that terrifying rock?

1182
01:31:02,754 --> 01:31:04,631
Talk about your fixer-upper.

1183
01:31:04,798 --> 01:31:07,967
I like what you've done with it,
although a bit heavy on the carcass.

1184
01:31:08,134 --> 01:31:09,761
Hey, hey, look. A bird.

1185
01:31:09,928 --> 01:31:12,514
Timon, Pumbaa, this is Zazu.

1186
01:31:13,014 --> 01:31:14,891
Wow! It's a puffin.

1187
01:31:15,058 --> 01:31:16,393
Charming.

1188
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:20,563
Simba, we are with you until the end.

1189
01:31:20,730 --> 01:31:22,941
We are at your service, my liege!

1190
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,026
Follow me.

1191
01:31:39,332 --> 01:31:40,750
Hyenas everywhere.

1192
01:31:40,917 --> 01:31:43,586
I hope it's a quick death.
You know, just not a lot of chewing.

1193
01:31:43,753 --> 01:31:46,089
What's your plan for getting us
past the slobbering guards?

1194
01:31:46,631 --> 01:31:48,633
Live bait.

1195
01:31:52,971 --> 01:31:54,556
That's a great idea.

1196
01:31:54,723 --> 01:31:57,017
Those guys could never resist fresh meat.

1197
01:31:57,183 --> 01:32:00,186
So all we need to do
is find something that's, like, big...

1198
01:32:00,353 --> 01:32:02,397
and plump, and juicy.

1199
01:32:02,564 --> 01:32:04,691
Maybe like a gnu?

1200
01:32:06,067 --> 01:32:08,194
Why is everyone looking at me?

1201
01:32:13,950 --> 01:32:18,288
It is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure...

1202
01:32:18,455 --> 01:32:21,583
that we proudly present...

1203
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:23,335
your dinner.

1204
01:32:25,879 --> 01:32:29,674
<i>Be our guest</i>

1205
01:32:33,011 --> 01:32:35,513
It's working, Pumbaa!

1206
01:33:08,088 --> 01:33:10,674
My old friend.

1207
01:33:11,257 --> 01:33:13,385
Sarabi, why put yourself through this?

1208
01:33:13,718 --> 01:33:16,179
All you have to do is be my queen.

1209
01:33:16,346 --> 01:33:17,806
You're suffering for what?

1210
01:33:17,972 --> 01:33:19,808
The memory of a life you once knew?

1211
01:33:19,974 --> 01:33:21,976
A king you once loved?

1212
01:33:23,144 --> 01:33:26,523
I tried to make you understand
what a true king can be.

1213
01:33:26,690 --> 01:33:31,361
Scar, a true king's power
is his compassion.

1214
01:33:31,528 --> 01:33:33,613
I am ten times the king Mufasa was!

1215
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:36,366
You are nothing compared to Mufasa!

1216
01:33:47,711 --> 01:33:49,004
Mufasa?

1217
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:50,213
It can't be.

1218
01:33:50,547 --> 01:33:52,674
Get away from my mother.

1219
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:56,678
Simba.

1220
01:33:59,097 --> 01:34:01,099
You're alive?

1221
01:34:01,266 --> 01:34:03,601
How can that be?

1222
01:34:03,852 --> 01:34:05,895
I'm here, Mother.

1223
01:34:06,062 --> 01:34:07,063
I'm home.

1224
01:34:07,230 --> 01:34:08,648
Simba...

1225
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:11,109
I'm so happy to see you.

1226
01:34:11,276 --> 01:34:12,110
Alive.

1227
01:34:13,737 --> 01:34:17,615
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't rip you apart.

1228
01:34:17,782 --> 01:34:19,868
I can give you more than one.

1229
01:34:20,035 --> 01:34:21,161
You see...

1230
01:34:21,536 --> 01:34:23,413
they think I'm king.

1231
01:34:25,749 --> 01:34:27,584
Well, we don't.

1232
01:34:28,752 --> 01:34:30,795
Your reign is over, Scar.

1233
01:34:31,796 --> 01:34:34,341
Simba is the rightful king!

1234
01:34:34,507 --> 01:34:38,053
If you wanna get him,
you have to get through us.

1235
01:34:38,219 --> 01:34:40,263
Are you with me, lions?

1236
01:34:43,641 --> 01:34:47,437
The choice is yours, Scar.
Step down or fight.

1237
01:34:47,812 --> 01:34:50,523
Must this all end in violence?

1238
01:34:52,025 --> 01:34:55,445
I'd hate to be responsible for
the death of a family member.

1239
01:34:56,071 --> 01:34:58,907
To feel the shame of knowing...

1240
01:34:59,074 --> 01:35:01,409
I took the life of someone I love.

1241
01:35:01,868 --> 01:35:03,411
I put all that behind me.

1242
01:35:03,578 --> 01:35:06,790
But have they put it behind them?

1243
01:35:06,956 --> 01:35:09,751
Do your faithful subjects
know what you've done?

1244
01:35:09,918 --> 01:35:11,419
What is he talking about?

1245
01:35:11,586 --> 01:35:14,881
So you haven't told them
your little secret?

1246
01:35:15,215 --> 01:35:17,384
Well, Simba...

1247
01:35:17,926 --> 01:35:20,845
now's your chance to confess.

1248
01:35:21,262 --> 01:35:24,641
Tell them who's responsible
for Mufasa's death.

1249
01:35:32,857 --> 01:35:34,693
It was me.

1250
01:35:35,026 --> 01:35:36,861
It's not true.

1251
01:35:37,904 --> 01:35:39,864
Tell me it's not true.

1252
01:35:40,031 --> 01:35:41,741
It's true. I'm sorry.

1253
01:35:41,908 --> 01:35:43,702
He admits it.

1254
01:35:43,868 --> 01:35:44,869
Murderer!

1255
01:35:45,036 --> 01:35:46,913
No, no.
It was an accident.

1256
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:48,998
If it weren't for you
the king would be alive.

1257
01:35:49,165 --> 01:35:51,710
It's your fault he's dead!
Do you deny it?

1258
01:35:51,876 --> 01:35:52,836
I'm not a murderer.

1259
01:35:53,294 --> 01:35:55,714
We should believe a son
who takes the life of a father?

1260
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:58,299
We should believe a son
who takes the life of a king?

1261
01:35:58,675 --> 01:36:00,802
A son who abandons his mother?

1262
01:36:01,094 --> 01:36:02,470
No. I'm...

1263
01:36:02,637 --> 01:36:05,557
You're what? Say it!
Are you the king?

1264
01:36:05,724 --> 01:36:06,891
No. No, I'm...

1265
01:36:07,058 --> 01:36:08,309
-Are you the king?
-No, I'm...

1266
01:36:08,476 --> 01:36:10,145
-You're what? Say it!
-I'm...

1267
01:36:11,771 --> 01:36:12,814
I'm nothing.

1268
01:36:13,189 --> 01:36:14,649
Then bow to your king!

1269
01:36:17,527 --> 01:36:18,611
Simba!

1270
01:36:34,169 --> 01:36:36,296
This looks familiar.

1271
01:36:36,463 --> 01:36:40,759
Where have I seen this before?

1272
01:36:41,051 --> 01:36:43,887
Yes, I remember.

1273
01:36:44,804 --> 01:36:47,932
This is the way Mufasa looked
before he died.

1274
01:36:49,142 --> 01:36:51,061
I looked down...

1275
01:36:51,227 --> 01:36:53,855
saw the fear in his eyes.

1276
01:36:57,609 --> 01:37:00,779
And here's my little secret.

1277
01:37:00,945 --> 01:37:03,823
I killed Mufasa.

1278
01:37:10,455 --> 01:37:13,083
No!

1279
01:37:18,046 --> 01:37:19,005
My father!

1280
01:37:19,339 --> 01:37:20,256
Your own brother!

1281
01:37:20,423 --> 01:37:21,508
How could you?

1282
01:37:21,841 --> 01:37:23,385
First he kills Mufasa...

1283
01:37:23,885 --> 01:37:25,345
and now he wants to kill me!

1284
01:37:25,512 --> 01:37:26,763
You killed him!

1285
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:28,223
Tell them the truth!

1286
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:29,933
Don't believe his lies!

1287
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:31,309
Scar...

1288
01:37:31,476 --> 01:37:34,688
you told us you didn't get
to the gorge in time.

1289
01:37:35,105 --> 01:37:36,356
That's true!

1290
01:37:36,523 --> 01:37:39,693
Then how did you see
the look in Mufasa's eyes?

1291
01:37:41,528 --> 01:37:42,821
Murderer!

1292
01:37:43,488 --> 01:37:44,989
Kill them all!

1293
01:37:51,788 --> 01:37:53,331
Lions, attack!

1294
01:38:08,138 --> 01:38:09,389
Simba!

1295
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:18,440
-Pumbaa, I think we lost them.
-That was terrifying.

1296
01:38:19,816 --> 01:38:21,484
Do you hear a low growl?

1297
01:38:22,318 --> 01:38:24,904
Looks like we'll be having pig for dinner.

1298
01:38:25,071 --> 01:38:27,032
Plump and chubby.

1299
01:38:27,574 --> 01:38:28,783
Chubby?

1300
01:38:29,159 --> 01:38:31,119
Did he just call me chubby?

1301
01:38:31,286 --> 01:38:33,788
It sounded a lot like
he just said "chubby".

1302
01:38:33,955 --> 01:38:35,749
Which would be a mistake because...

1303
01:38:35,915 --> 01:38:38,293
I will not be made to feel
ashamed of who I am!

1304
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:39,169
Oh, boy.

1305
01:38:39,336 --> 01:38:41,171
I may run from hyenas...

1306
01:38:41,338 --> 01:38:43,465
but I will always fight a bully!

1307
01:38:51,973 --> 01:38:53,266
-You feel better, Pumbaa?
-I do.

1308
01:38:53,433 --> 01:38:55,560
-You got that out of your system?
-I did.

1309
01:39:10,116 --> 01:39:13,453
Now, this is a meal
I've waited my whole life for.

1310
01:39:14,287 --> 01:39:16,581
I've been waiting too.

1311
01:39:16,748 --> 01:39:18,708
And I'm not a cub anymore!

1312
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:26,007
For king and country!

1313
01:39:28,635 --> 01:39:29,678
It's the bird!

1314
01:39:29,844 --> 01:39:31,221
I got him! I got him!

1315
01:39:32,806 --> 01:39:34,099
Tally-ho!

1316
01:39:34,265 --> 01:39:35,266
No! He's got me!

1317
01:39:35,433 --> 01:39:36,643
He's got me!

1318
01:39:39,771 --> 01:39:41,189
Get that bird!

1319
01:39:46,152 --> 01:39:48,613
Please! Let's discuss this.

1320
01:40:20,854 --> 01:40:22,564
That never gets old!

1321
01:41:34,886 --> 01:41:36,096
It's over, Scar.

1322
01:41:40,141 --> 01:41:41,643
Have mercy.
I beg you.

1323
01:41:41,810 --> 01:41:43,228
Mercy?

1324
01:41:43,395 --> 01:41:44,688
After what you did?

1325
01:41:45,146 --> 01:41:46,940
It was the hyenas.

1326
01:41:47,107 --> 01:41:49,484
Those revolting scavengers
made me do it.

1327
01:41:49,651 --> 01:41:52,278
I was planning on killing them all.

1328
01:41:53,113 --> 01:41:54,614
You fooled the hyenas.

1329
01:41:55,532 --> 01:41:57,117
Just like you fooled me.

1330
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:01,413
Simba...

1331
01:42:01,579 --> 01:42:03,707
you wouldn't kill your only uncle.

1332
01:42:05,458 --> 01:42:06,584
No, Scar.

1333
01:42:08,336 --> 01:42:09,879
I'm not like you.

1334
01:42:10,755 --> 01:42:12,507
Simba...

1335
01:42:12,674 --> 01:42:14,968
you are truly noble.

1336
01:42:15,135 --> 01:42:16,845
And I will make it up to you.

1337
01:42:17,012 --> 01:42:19,889
Just tell me how I can prove myself.

1338
01:42:20,056 --> 01:42:22,642
Tell me what you want me to do.

1339
01:42:24,894 --> 01:42:26,187
Run.

1340
01:42:28,565 --> 01:42:30,692
Run away, Scar.

1341
01:42:31,234 --> 01:42:34,320
Run away and never return.

1342
01:42:35,905 --> 01:42:37,240
Yes.

1343
01:42:38,033 --> 01:42:40,035
Of course.

1344
01:42:40,744 --> 01:42:42,954
As you wish...

1345
01:42:43,121 --> 01:42:44,372
Your Majesty.

1346
01:42:57,093 --> 01:42:58,553
You can't win, Scar!

1347
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:00,180
This is my kingdom!

1348
01:43:00,347 --> 01:43:01,598
My destiny!

1349
01:43:54,818 --> 01:43:56,111
My friends.

1350
01:43:56,277 --> 01:44:00,240
It will take some time,
but together we will build our army.

1351
01:44:00,407 --> 01:44:01,783
"Friends", huh?

1352
01:44:02,283 --> 01:44:05,954
I thought you said we were
"revolting scavengers"?

1353
01:44:06,121 --> 01:44:09,040
Yeah. That you wanted to kill us?

1354
01:44:09,207 --> 01:44:10,166
No.

1355
01:44:10,333 --> 01:44:11,501
No, let me explain.

1356
01:44:12,168 --> 01:44:14,546
I was trying to fool him.

1357
01:44:14,713 --> 01:44:16,172
We will rule together!

1358
01:44:17,424 --> 01:44:20,510
There's only one true thing
you ever said, Scar.

1359
01:44:22,804 --> 01:44:24,848
"A hyena's belly...

1360
01:44:25,015 --> 01:44:26,933
"is never full."

1361
01:44:32,981 --> 01:44:34,065
No!

1362
01:45:27,118 --> 01:45:29,162
Your Majesty.

1363
01:46:23,091 --> 01:46:25,218
<i>Remember.</i>

1364
01:47:15,602 --> 01:47:19,898
<i>Till we find our place</i>

1365
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:24,736
<i>On the path unwinding</i>

1366
01:47:26,946 --> 01:47:30,367
<i>In the circle</i>

1367
01:47:31,910 --> 01:47:34,829
<i>The circle of life</i>

1368
01:47:37,624 --> 01:47:41,711
<i>Circle of life</i>
