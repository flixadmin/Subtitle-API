1
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,359
I got it, I got it.

2
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,552
You're like a bee at a damn picnic,
Marie.

3
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,914
- Morning.
- Hey, buddy.

4
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,759
- Ready to get your rocks on?
- See? I knew it.

5
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,475
"Mineral show" is just some sort of
guy code for "strip club."

6
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,955
Yeah. You got your singles?

7
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,518
- Got it?
- Yeah.

8
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,675
Don't let him get too crazy, okay?

9
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,350
Cram one more giant geode in here,
we'll be sleeping in the garage.

10
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,755
- Got it. I got it.
- I'm sorry.

11
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,479
Christ. Longest week ever.

12
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,110
Here's just hoping
we get something good.

13
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,597
Keep your fingers crossed.

14
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,635
Relax, buddy, this ain't no spy movie.

15
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,518
It's more like Rocky, you know?

16
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,278
Get the bad guy.

17
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,154
Yeah!

18
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,598
- But- But- What are you doing, buddy?
- Leaving.

19
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,389
You gotta go inside, order something
like last time. Avoid suspicion.

20
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,830
Besides, I want a vanilla shake.

21
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,035
We'll use the drive-through.

22
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,478
All right, baby,
let's see what we got.

23
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,236
What the hell? Look at this.

24
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,552
That's work. That's home.
That's work, that's home.

25
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,879
What, this guy...

26
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,196
...he goes two places every day,
all week?

27
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,558
It's unbelievable.

28
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,038
Chicken-slinging son of a bitch.

29
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,155
Hank, is it possible that maybe,
just maybe...

30
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,837
...he's not your guy?

31
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,998
A guy this clean has got to be dirty.

32
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,072
What's the play here, buddy?

33
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,754
How do I get this guy?

34
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,958
Yeah.

35
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,719
How?

36
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,919
Yes, hi.

37
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,796
I live on the 4900 block of Doswell Place
and I want to report...

38
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,952
...a very suspicious man
lurking in my neighbourhood.

39
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,792
He's sitting in a blue sedan...

40
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,118
...and he's been staring at
a particular house for a very long time.

41
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,833
Thank you. Thank you so much.

42
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,838
If you would, I would appreciate it.

43
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,834
All right.

44
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,474
I guess we'd better get started.

45
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,512
I already did.

46
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,193
Yeah?

47
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,478
Hey.

48
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,193
Got one of those for me?

49
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,000
- One of those what?
- Cigarette.

50
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,790
Look, it's still in there, all right?
I didn't get a chance yet.

51
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,080
Just give me one.

52
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,036
So, what have you been up to?

53
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,759
What?

54
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,795
You know, just a day in the life.
What do you do after work?

55
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,190
Go home. Watch TV.

56
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,839
What do you watch?

57
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,473
I don't know, stuff.

58
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,711
Well, like what?

59
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,949
Like Ice Road Truckers.

60
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,430
Ice Road Truckers.

61
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,114
What happens on that one?

62
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,315
Guys drive on ice.

63
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,393
I am gonna do it.

64
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,029
You gotta inhale, by the way.

65
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,269
What the hell, man? Don't you have
enough cancer already? Look.

66
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,917
I said...

67
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,954
...I'd do it. I'll do it.

68
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,876
Yeah, well...

69
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,911
...what does it matter?

70
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,475
We're both dead men anyway.

71
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,916
- Hi.
- Hi

72
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,350
Am I catching you at a bad time?

73
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,875
No. I have a few minutes.

74
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,275
So Mr.
I'm-Almost-Sixteen-Leave-Me-Alone...

75
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,109
...doesn't want a big birthday,
just wants to hang out with friends...

76
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,073
- ...which is fine by me. You?
- Fine by me.

77
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:27,513
Okay. So I figured a low-key family
dinner, no official party...

78
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,597
...and we bite the bullet...

79
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,319
...and buy him a car.

80
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,592
Used, I was thinking, would be best.

81
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,675
But no more than five years old.
Airbags, safety-rated, all that.

82
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,077
Do you have any thoughts
on what kind?

83
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,874
Or should I just go ahead and -

84
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,759
Yeah. You just go ahead.

85
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,552
Okay.

86
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,391
Listen, on another subject,
I just wanted to tell you...

87
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,517
...that business is good.

88
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,757
Really good.

89
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,995
So good that I'm thinking, maybe...

90
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,270
...you don't need to even work...

91
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,675
...your second job.

92
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,239
- You're turning a profit?
- We're coming close.

93
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,759
Give us another month or two and,
yeah, we'll be there.

94
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,675
All of this to say...

95
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,873
...maybe you could start thinking
about an exit strategy.

96
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,716
I'm working on it.

97
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,672
Okay.

98
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,317
- Hello?
- Hey, buddy. Wake you?

99
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,953
No, Hank. I'm up.

100
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,754
Good. What you doing?

101
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,359
I'm...

102
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,358
Hey, listen, I'll cut to it.
Another favour to ask.

103
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,558
I'm thinking about Gus Fring.
How he never goes anywhere.

104
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,833
One restaurant, home, back and forth?
I'm even more convinced it's bullshit...

105
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,429
...because he owns
13 other restaurants. Right?

106
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,598
So I start thinking
about this little empire of his.

107
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,475
Fourteen restaurants. Who supplies
them? What's the base of operations?

108
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,750
So I do a little digging, and bingo.

109
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,520
Pollos Hermanos
has a main distribution centre.

110
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,199
It's not far from town.

111
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,833
The place is huge. I mean...

112
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,518
...I'm looking at it online now.
It's a big warehouse...

113
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,275
...and rows
of these long, poultry buildings...

114
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,550
...or hatcheries,
whatever you call them.

115
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,072
Lots of space to hide illicit activity.
Sounds promising, right?

116
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,272
So, what do you say, buddy?
Got another field trip in you?

117
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,953
You know, Hank, I'm- I'm- I'm -

118
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,869
I mean, it sounds great, it really does.
But I'm -

119
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,674
You know, I won't lie.

120
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,917
You've caught me somewhat...

121
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,554
...indisposed.

122
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,674
What do you mean,
like taking-a-dump indisposed?

123
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,197
Yeah. That's embarrassing.

124
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,628
That's it.

125
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,675
You know, it's just upset stomach and,
you know, everything -

126
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,718
- Yeah.
- It's out of control.

127
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,710
And it's really explosive.
Bad Tex-Mex...

128
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,480
- ...at the mall.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it.

129
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,432
You don't have to paint a picture.

130
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,870
One guy in a diaper is enough
for this trip.

131
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,469
- Yeah, and I'm sorry, Hank.
- Hey, don't be.

132
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,992
I've been asking a lot of you lately.
I appreciate it. I'll find another ride.

133
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,431
- Another ride?
- Yeah.

134
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,240
I'm sure I can get someone else
to take me.

135
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,510
My trainer, Chuck.
Maybe I'll ask him.

136
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,713
Well, look, I'm -
This is probably just a 24-hour thing.

137
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,871
Maybe 48 hours at the most.

138
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:25,598
And do you think you can possibly
hold off for a day or two?

139
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,116
Jeez, buddy, I mean, I...

140
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,198
You know, I just -
I would just really...

141
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,597
...love to be the one
to be able to take you there.

142
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,315
And, I mean, I've just really...

143
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,990
...enjoyed, you know,
the time with you...

144
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,078
- ...and helping you and -
- Well, yeah.

145
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,272
Okay, sure.
If it means that much to you.

146
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,790
Just, you know, give me a call
when you're feeling up to it.

147
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,112
Thank you. I will. Okay.

148
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,719
Bye.

149
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,349
- Yeah.
- Mike, listen.

150
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,518
I just want to say first off,
don't be angry.

151
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,869
What is it, Walter?

152
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,590
My brother-in-law, my DE- He...

153
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,113
Soon, he will probably,
in the near future...

154
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,312
...take a ride out
to a certain distribution centre...

155
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,519
...to look around for things.

156
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,119
Just...

157
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,675
...look around for things. And, yeah.

158
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,549
Mike?

159
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,959
- Where's this all going?
- Elsewhere.

160
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,870
Thank you. Please give this
to your car-care professional.

161
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,996
So a hand wax for you today?

162
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,753
Okay, great.

163
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,512
Please give this
to your car-care professional.

164
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,917
And the black Explorer,
we could shampoo your floor mats...

165
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,793
...but deluxe detailing
is the best for your buck.

166
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,594
And SUV's are extra.

167
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,993
And please give this
to your car-care professional.

168
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,275
Thank you.

169
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,116
Please give this
to your car-care professional.

170
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,389
Hey, Sky.

171
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,517
Oh, my God. Ted.

172
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,909
What are you...?

173
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,633
Someone from the office...

174
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,628
...said you worked down here.
So I thought I'd come down and say hi.

175
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,829
Well...

176
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,038
...hello.

177
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,675
You look great.

178
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,759
No. No, I don't.
I probably just look crazed.

179
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,036
Not at all. You look happy.

180
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,595
Last time I saw you...

181
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,633
Hi, there.

182
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,592
I guess, Skyler...

183
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,834
...I'm gonna need to talk to you.

184
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:58,312
Ted, I really don't think
we have anything to talk about.

185
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,718
Actually, we do.

186
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,996
An audit?
Wait, an audit tomorrow?

187
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,432
- How long have you had this?
- A while.

188
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,791
I debated, you know, contacting you.

189
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,355
Contact me?
What about a lawyer, Ted?

190
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,352
Ted, this is...

191
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,391
This is the CID.

192
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,154
The criminal division.

193
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,235
My God,
you're facing a felony charge here.

194
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,830
A $100,000 fine
on top of the taxes you already owe...

195
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,600
- ...plus five years in prison.
- Yeah.

196
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,074
- It's bad.
- Yeah.

197
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,389
It most certainly is.

198
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,433
Look, here's the thing.
I was wondering, maybe...

199
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,911
...if you could help with this.

200
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,678
Help?

201
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,711
Help how?

202
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,151
Well, with your knowledge
of how the books...

203
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,830
...got the way they are,
maybe there's some way...

204
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,429
...you could undo what's in there.

205
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,274
You want me to uncook your books?

206
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,837
Maybe there's some method or some
accounting trick you could use -

207
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,793
Ted, it doesn't work like that.

208
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,951
The damage is already -

209
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,432
My name.

210
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,952
My signatures...

211
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,594
...are all over those books.

212
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,310
Skyler, I'm accountable, not you.

213
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,080
Let me explain
what's going to happen here, okay?

214
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,113
Once the CID
sees this is wilful tax fraud...

215
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,357
...they will build the strongest
possible case against you.

216
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,838
Once they start down that path, they
have an 80 percent conviction rate.

217
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,793
That's because they're allowed
to monitor your mail...

218
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,959
...and tap your phones,
and not just you, Ted...

219
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,232
...everyone involved in those books.

220
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,870
I can't have this in my life.

221
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,469
I cannot be audited.

222
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,076
Skyler, you're going to be fine, okay?
They're after me.

223
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,431
It's the captain they want,
not some cashier at a car wash.

224
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,794
No offence.

225
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,912
I'm sorry. I...

226
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,271
Look, I don't want you to worry, okay?

227
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,711
I'm going to figure out
a way through this, somehow. Okay?

228
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,269
Here.

229
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,159
So is he gonna kill him?

230
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,518
Is who gonna kill who?

231
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,392
Gus.

232
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,512
Is he gonna kill Mr. White's
brother-in-law?

233
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,995
I mean, he's the reason
for all of this here, right?

234
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,954
Because it's totally logical for him
to off the dude.

235
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,358
A- hole DEA agent
poking around your junk.

236
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,349
Who needs that, right?

237
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,159
Makes sense to get rid of him
for good.

238
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,956
But killing a cop...

239
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,957
...I don't know.

240
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,635
It could look suspicious...

241
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,277
...if the dude who's investigating you
suddenly up and dies.

242
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,191
Then there's- There's Mr. White...

243
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:08,068
...who would be even more apeshit
if he had family getting murdered.

244
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,679
He'd never cook for Gus again.

245
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,431
Guess there's a lot of angles
to consider.

246
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,675
If something were to happen to him,
would you have a problem with that?

247
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,875
Who really cares what I think?

248
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,231
Son of a bitch.

249
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,436
You get comfortable, kid.
We may be here a while.

250
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,679
Hey.

251
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,869
Get down!

252
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,231
Tell them...

253
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,916
...the answer is "yes."

254
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,759
- Should I even ask?
- I wouldn't.

255
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,349
So, what? Is this going to be
a regular thing now?

256
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,919
Meth cooking and corpse disposal?
Jesus.

257
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,675
Just grab us a spare barrel,
Walter.

258
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,233
What was it this time?

259
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,189
What did this poor bastard do
to piss off Gus?

260
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,436
Or did Gus need to send
another message?

261
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,835
Shut your mouth.

262
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,755
You shut your mouth
or I'll shut it for you.

263
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,034
I don't want you talking to me
or Jesse. Just get the barrel.

264
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,795
And if you ever plan on calling the cops
on one of my guys again...

265
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,954
...you go ahead and get two barrels.

266
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,114
Like...

267
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,477
...I guess I never thanked you for
what you did.

268
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,469
Thanks.

269
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,954
Next time don't stand there
like an idiot.

270
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,118
Move your feet.
Running and so forth.

271
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,712
But seriously, what-?

272
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,468
- What was the deal with Gus?
- The deal?

273
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,590
That Terminator shit.
Walking right into the bullets.

274
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,751
What the hell was he doing?

275
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,316
The cartel needs Gus.

276
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,239
His distribution network.
They're not looking to kill him.

277
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,758
But, what? The rest of us are like
open season?

278
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,191
Is he doing anything about that,
or do we keep hanging out...

279
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,755
- ...for target practise while he-?
- Kid.

280
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,795
Enough. You got questions,
ask him yourself.

281
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,154
And here again.

282
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,872
Unreported income.

283
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,320
That's more than a year straight so far.

284
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,952
You want to say something about this?
I'm having a hard time figuring it out.

285
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,116
I'd have to...

286
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,837
...have a look at the copies of
the receipts to refresh my memory.

287
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,828
Take all the time you need,
Mr. Beneke. That's why we're here.

288
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,278
Oh, I am so sorry I am late.

289
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,397
I got lost. Hey, Ted.

290
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,633
- Sky.
- This building is so confusing.

291
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,712
There are doors everywhere.

292
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,958
- Hi. You are...?
- Special Agent James Bekaris.

293
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,237
"Special. " Skyler White.

294
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,480
Ms. White,
you are the accountant of record...

295
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,069
...for many of these reports,
is that correct?

296
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,516
- Guilty as charged.
- Can you shed light...

297
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,790
...on this history
of missing revenue?

298
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,230
Missing? No, it's there.

299
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,472
No. Revenue most definitely
flowed through this company...

300
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,638
...but it's not all accounted for
in your reports.

301
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,557
Let's take a look.

302
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,590
Oh, well, you know...

303
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,918
...this account here,
that is Mr. Keller's account.

304
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,634
And Mr. Keller is an old friend
of Ted's dad.

305
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,070
He always sends
an electronic payment...

306
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,874
...which I hate,
because I'm a real-paper person.

307
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,628
Mr. Keller is
one of those environmental people.

308
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,910
Since there wasn't a physical cheque...

309
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,749
...I didn't enter it into the book.
But the money is there.

310
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,837
Ms. White, you've read Section 61
of the IRC?

311
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,838
I did not follow what you just said.

312
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,633
How gross income for a business is
defined, you're not allowed to do that.

313
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,990
- Well, I think I am.
- No, you're not.

314
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,239
Well, you know what they say about
opinions, right? Everyone's got one.

315
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,994
But seriously, I am.

316
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,670
It doesn't matter if it's an
electronic cheque or a paper cheque...

317
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,872
...income is income.
You're not allowed to not declare it.

318
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,753
When I input everything
into the Quicken...

319
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,919
...nothing flashed red,
so that's gotta mean it's okay, right?

320
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,435
Quicken.

321
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,273
You used Quicken to manage books
for a business this size.

322
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,552
I did. Do you guys use that here?
Because it is the best.

323
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,150
It's like having a calculator
on your computer. Amazing.

324
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,113
- Ms. White, how did you get this job?
- Ted hired me.

325
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,470
No, I mean your qualifications.

326
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,956
What are your qualifications?
Where did you get your training?

327
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,034
Well, I haven't had any training,
per se.

328
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,555
I've always been naturally good
with numbers.

329
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,036
Got a good instinct for them.
Right, Teddy?

330
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,669
Right.

331
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,193
This is all falling into place now.

332
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,234
Ms. White, I just have to ask.
You're not managing accounts...

333
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,876
- ...anywhere else, are you?
- Right now? No.

334
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,550
I'm a cashier at a car wash.

335
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,715
I'm not really clear about what
happened in there.

336
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,037
What happened was good news.
Ignorance of the law...

337
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,789
...doesn't equate to criminality.
It equates to ignorance.

338
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,150
Pay your back taxes,
pay the penalties...

339
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,874
...and move on from this.
Just put it behind you.

340
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,672
Pay with what?

341
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,235
I owe them $617,000. What am I-?

342
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,274
Look, just figure it out, all right?
And you've just dodged prison.

343
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,314
Sell your assets. Get rid of the BMW,
take out a second mortgage -

344
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,715
Second mortgage?
I have a lien on my house.

345
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,912
I don't have any assets.
There are no assets left to sell.

346
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,556
Ted, if you don't pay them,
they will reopen the investigation...

347
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,032
...and that little fiction I just spun up
there is gonna completely unravel.

348
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,958
You have to settle.

349
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,753
Wish I could.

350
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,234
Come in.

351
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,476
I hope you brought an appetite.

352
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,876
Yeah, I guess.

353
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,999
Mike mentioned you have
some questions.

354
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,789
Yeah.

355
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,476
We'll eat first, and then we'll talk.

356
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,279
Right on.

357
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,952
What am I doing here?

358
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,757
I know you have concerns.

359
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,357
What happened yesterday,
to my man at the farm...

360
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,391
...it was a terrible thing.

361
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,672
The dude getting his head
blown off? Yeah.

362
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,390
I've invited you into my home...

363
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,549
...prepared food
so we could sit and talk.

364
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,559
Discuss what's going on in
this business...

365
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,680
...our business, like men.

366
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,517
And I will explain everything
that is happening.

367
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,796
I will answer your questions.

368
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,439
But first...

369
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,835
...I need you
to answer one question for me.

370
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,350
Can you cook Walter's formula?

371
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,429
What?

372
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,232
Walter's formula.

373
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,554
Can you produce his product
without any help? Alone.

374
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,949
No.

375
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,189
Why?

376
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,992
You're asking me if I can cook
Mr. White's crystal?

377
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,632
Without him?

378
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,389
Me?

379
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,111
The junkie loser you were about to waste
and dump in the desert a month ago.

380
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,198
This your plan?

381
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,110
Invite me in your house,
make whatever this is...

382
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,837
...be my buddy...

383
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,114
...and make me feel important.

384
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:29,270
Then get me to keep cooking for you
after you kill Mr. White?

385
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,748
You wanna -
You wanna talk like men?

386
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,558
Let's talk like men. You kill Mr. White,
you're gonna have to kill me too.

387
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,315
That is not what I asked you.

388
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,671
You are here because circumstances
with the cartel are untenable.

389
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,191
And I need your help.

390
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,075
I need you to help prevent
an all-out war.

391
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,991
Now, if you would...

392
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,317
...answer the question.

393
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,195
Hey, you headed out?

394
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,399
Yeah.

395
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,718
Yo, Mr. White, hey. I really gotta
talk to you. I don't know if you're...

396
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,470
...with your family or whatever,
but this is important...

397
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,150
...so I'm hoping you could come over.

398
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,875
Thank God. Come on in.

399
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,591
- You-You want a beer or something?
- No.

400
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,549
- Should I sit down?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry, go ahead.

401
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,358
Okay, so...

402
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,839
Okay, so word has come down
that they -

403
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,793
They want me to go to Mexico.

404
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,872
There's some -
Some sort of war brewing...

405
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,550
- ...between Gus and the cartel.
- "Word has come down"?

406
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,275
The cartel has been -
Has been messing with Gus' operation.

407
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,040
Like jacking trucks to,
like, send a message.

408
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,078
And yesterday,
that dude we brought to the lab.

409
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,638
I mean, they shot him right in
front of me. Just blew his head open.

410
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,277
Some sniper nailed him from
like a mile away.

411
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,558
Anyway, they've been holding
them off.

412
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,069
But between the cartel
taking potshots...

413
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,955
...and your brother-in-law trying to throw
a net over the whole deal...

414
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,789
...it's like what you call
a rock-and-a-hard-place situation.

415
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,436
So, Gus is- Is gonna cave.

416
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,949
So the cartel wants half
of Gus' entire operation...

417
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,550
...and they want your formula.
And he's gonna give it to them.

418
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,590
Well, I-I gotta give it to them.
I mean, I'm supposed to go to Mexico...

419
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:33,277
...and teach a bunch of cartel chemists
how to cook a batch of blue.

420
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,390
You know,
and Gus doesn't trust you...

421
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,359
...so I gotta go.
I mean, you're the chemist, man...

422
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,950
...you know, not me.
I mean, let's say I go down to -

423
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,028
You know, go over there.
Go to the jungle or whatever...

424
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,589
...and they got like actual chemists...

425
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,712
...like cartel chemists asking me
chemistry stuff...

426
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,832
...that I don't know how to
answer because I'm not you.

427
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,158
And what if all the equipment
is in Mexican instead of English?

428
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,435
You know?
I don't know. I don't know.

429
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,949
I mean, if I mess this up...

430
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,589
...I'm dead, you know? All of us.

431
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,994
Mr. White, look, I need -
I need your help.

432
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,113
Okay, maybe you could -
Maybe you could coach me...

433
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,911
...or something, you know.
Or give me some notes.

434
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,073
Mr. White?

435
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,871
So you saw Gus?

436
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,639
What? No.

437
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,759
- You didn't see Gus.
- No.

438
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,395
Then who told you all of that?

439
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,588
It was passed down, like I said.

440
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,309
"Passed down. " By whom?

441
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,997
By... By Mike and them.

442
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,352
- I mean, they did. They -
- So "they" doesn't include Gus.

443
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,231
You haven't been with Gus. You haven't
seen Gus. You haven't spoken to Gus.

444
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,597
- Why are you-?
- You weren't at Gus' house last night.

445
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,875
What?

446
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,674
What the hell? Jesus.

447
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,839
Still here.

448
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,839
- It's still here.
- Jesus.

449
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,954
You look me in the eye
and you tell me...

450
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,072
...that you weren't at his house
last night.

451
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,033
I...

452
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,712
Look, I didn't have a chance,
all right?

453
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,635
Okay? I knew you would react
this way.

454
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,877
I knew you would freak out
and wouldn't believe me.

455
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,395
That's why I didn't say anything.

456
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,833
Look, there was just this one
big pot of stew.

457
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,793
He just made this one big pot
and we both ate from it.

458
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,434
What was I supposed to do,
poison myself?

459
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,559
Two hours, 18 minutes, and you couldn't
figure out a way to give it to him?

460
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,638
- He never left the room.
- You lying little shit!

461
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,274
You had one thing to do, one thing.

462
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,876
That is the only thing, I might add,
that would save our lives...

463
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,913
...and you were right there.
You were in his house...

464
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,793
...and you didn't have the guts
to do it.

465
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,913
Two hours and 18 minutes?

466
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,157
You never had any intention
of killing him, did you?

467
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,318
How did you know
I was at his house last night?

468
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,073
Were you following me?

469
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,711
This. This is how I knew.

470
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,632
- You bugged my car?
- 7:10 to 9:28 p.m.

471
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,634
Two hours and 18 minutes.
But you had no intentions, did you?

472
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,229
Not the slightest intention.

473
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,188
Everything that I have done for you.

474
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,835
You put a bug on my car?

475
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,509
I'm sorry,
after everything you've done for me?

476
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,631
What you've done for me?

477
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,956
You killed me, is what you've done!

478
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,552
You've signed my death warrant! Now
you want advice? I'll give you advice:

479
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,595
Go to Mexico and screw up like I know
you will. Wind up in a barrel somewhere!

480
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,872
You son of a -

481
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,632
Can you walk?

482
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,474
Yeah.

483
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,158
Then get the fuck out of here
and never come back.
