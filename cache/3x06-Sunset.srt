1
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,871
What can I do for you?

2
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,028
You know.

3
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,996
Sunset.

4
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,998
I told you before.

5
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,193
You will not kill Walter White.

6
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,356
Not until my business
with him has concluded.

7
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,951
We've waited long enough.

8
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,557
We won't wait any longer.

9
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,711
You'll have to.

10
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,509
The decision...

11
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,718
...is not yours to make.

12
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,395
Explain to me, why this man White?

13
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,637
He betrayed your cousin Tuco, yes.

14
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,510
But he's not the one
who murdered him.

15
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,598
Was there not another man...

16
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,035
...who pulled the trigger?

17
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,552
A DEA agent.

18
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,629
Bolsa says the DEA is off-limits.

19
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,833
North of the border is my territory.

20
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,633
My say.

21
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,917
As a show of respect...

22
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,113
...I say yes.

23
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,671
The agent's name is...

24
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,639
...Hank Schrader.

25
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,834
May his death satisfy you.
