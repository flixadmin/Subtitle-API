- Okay.

161
00:07:00,028 --> 00:07:01,725
So, Spoons, you're super safe
in the ducts,

162
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:03,248
but once you drop
into this room,

163
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,120
you're under surveillance--
audio and video.

164
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:06,600
Video, I got you, no problem.
Audio's a little trickier.

165
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:08,428
There's microphones
all over this ship,

166
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:10,995
so even if I were to loop
the audio in the armory,

167
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,171
the mics in the hallway
will still pick you up.

168
00:07:13,215 --> 00:07:14,738
You gotta stay silent.

169
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:16,827
Okay, but what happens
if I'm not?

170
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:18,655
Well, once you're past
the bulkhead,

171
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:20,222
she can open the airlock

172
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:22,050
and eject you
without harming our Gideon.

173
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:23,486
Okay, good, and one fart,

174
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,009
and I'm sucked
out of the temporal zone.

175
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:26,271
You're not gonna fart,
and when you come back

176
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:27,795
with the courier,
Astra, you're up.

177
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:29,231
Can't put the ship
back together,

178
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:30,624
but I sure as hell
can blow it apart.

179
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,452
Alrighty,
let's do this thing.

180
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,845
W-w-what can I do?

181
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:35,846
Listen up, everyone.

182
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,848
- Oh.
- Hi.

183
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:40,024
Gideon and I
have a brilliant new plan.

184
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:42,331
To demonstrate her commitment
to your safety, Computer Gideon

185
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:43,985
will show you a glimpse
into your futures

186
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:45,465
as proof that you
and the timeline

187
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:48,555
are in good hands.
- Oh, all right, Gideon.

188
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:50,644
We'll give it a shot.
Right, guys?

189
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:51,993
all: Yes.

190
00:07:52,036 --> 00:07:54,778
Great.
Meet me in the parlor, yes?

191
00:07:54,822 --> 00:07:57,172
- Okay.
- Be right there, bye.

192
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,914
Yes, this is perfect.

193
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:02,133
Then evil Gideon
will be distracted

194
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:04,005
while Spooner
charges the courier.

195
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:05,572

Z, looks like you're up.

196

197

all the time we can get.

198

I know I am.

199

Yeah, I'm something, Gary.
I'm something.

200
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:17,061
Okay, have a seat.

Mm-hmm.

This will create
a 15-second video loop,

219
