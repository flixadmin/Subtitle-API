1
00:00:03,298 --> 00:00:04,390
I know some things too.

2
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:08,091
Wait a minute. You know what happens
when a planet explodes.

3
00:00:08,303 --> 00:00:11,830
- Debris. Things floating in space.
- So?

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,942
So all we have to do is find out
where in heaven Krypton used to be.

5
00:00:16,144 --> 00:00:19,045
Then good ol' Gus contacts
the Vulcan satellite.

6
00:00:19,247 --> 00:00:21,374
OI' Gus has been doing some thinking.

7
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,448
That's why I keep you around.

8
00:00:23,918 --> 00:00:27,945
I've been thinking that I'm not making
enough money for this gig.

9
00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:31,989
Gus, if there's anything I hate...

10
00:00:32,727 --> 00:00:33,921
...it's greed.

11
00:00:34,128 --> 00:00:37,222
Greed? Mr. Ross, just a minute.

12
00:00:37,432 --> 00:00:39,297
Let me tell you something.

13
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:41,234
I can't ski!

14
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:15,961
<i>Once Gus contacts
the Vulcan satellite...</i>

15
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,104
<i>... he orders it to search
through space...</i>

16
00:01:18,306 --> 00:01:21,104
<i>... around where Krypton
went bye-bye.</i>

17
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:34,180
<i>Then the laser probe locks
onto a floating chunk of Kryptonite.</i>

18
00:01:34,389 --> 00:01:36,414
<i>The computer analyzes
the components...</i>

19
00:01:36,624 --> 00:01:39,923
<i>... and the boys at the lab
duplicate the stuff down here.</i>

20
00:01:40,495 --> 00:01:42,326
"Unknown"?

21
00:01:42,797 --> 00:01:44,355
"Unknown"?

22
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:03,710
What the hell,
he ain't gonna smoke it.

23
00:02:09,724 --> 00:02:12,215
Mr. White can't be responsible.

24
00:02:14,462 --> 00:02:15,656
Where is he?

25
00:02:15,863 --> 00:02:17,455
Please, Mr. Stokis.

26
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:19,594
He'll pay for this.

27
00:02:21,102 --> 00:02:22,626
Get out your wallet!

28
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:24,468
Good morning.

29
00:02:24,672 --> 00:02:26,902
Don't you "good morning" me.

30
00:02:28,343 --> 00:02:32,541
"Old, old relationships
suddenly seem very much the same.

31
00:02:32,847 --> 00:02:34,371
The prettiest girl in the school..."

32
00:02:36,217 --> 00:02:38,515
- is still the prettiest girl
in the school.

33
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:46,356
<i>- Hello?
- Hello. Oh, hi, Clark.</i>

34
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:51,123
Lana! Hi, I was just
thinking about you.

35
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:55,062
Listen, I have a problem with Ricky.

36
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:56,531
What happened to Ricky?

37
00:02:56,738 --> 00:03:00,230
It's Superman's autograph you got him.
He got carried away...

38
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:03,467
...and told the kids Superman was
coming on his birthday.

39
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:04,906
Okay, it was wrong...

40
00:03:05,113 --> 00:03:08,776
...but when Wednesday comes
and Superman doesn't show up...

41
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:13,413
Lana, in this case I think I can go
ahead and speak for Superman.

42
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:15,646
I mean, he and I are
pretty close.

43
00:03:15,857 --> 00:03:19,884
You can tell Ricky that Superman
will be there on Wednesday, all right?

44
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:25,065
Well, he's gonna get the best
home-cooked meal he's had...

45
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:26,593
...in a long time.

46
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:28,735
<i>Tell Superman we think
he's wonderful.</i>

47
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:29,766
All right.

48
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:32,063
<i>- But, Clark...
- Yeah?</i>

49
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,839
...you're the best.

50
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:41,246
And I'll take it to
the Supreme Court if I have to.

51
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:44,748
But it wasn't our fault.
It was an act of God.

52
00:03:44,952 --> 00:03:46,749
In a church?

53
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,467
Hey!

54
00:04:00,668 --> 00:04:02,636
Here's that compound you ordered.

55
00:04:02,837 --> 00:04:04,702
Can't imagine what you want with it.

56
00:04:04,906 --> 00:04:06,271
But you got it.

57
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,481
What the hell am I afraid for?
I'm from Earth.

58
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:23,384
I really wasn't expecting all this.

59
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:26,116
I guess they did get
a little carried away.

60
00:04:39,974 --> 00:04:43,205
Superman, we all know...

61
00:04:43,878 --> 00:04:46,608
...that you're not looking for
honors and awards.

62
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:51,043
But when we heard that you were
coming to see your pal Ricky...

63
00:04:51,252 --> 00:04:55,052
...we realized that this was
our chance to say thank you.

64
00:04:55,256 --> 00:04:57,622
First, for putting out
the Lake Camooga fire.

65
00:04:58,126 --> 00:05:01,357
And not least, for saving
little Ricky.

66
00:05:01,863 --> 00:05:04,525
So since you already have
the key to our hearts...

67
00:05:04,732 --> 00:05:06,859
...Superman...

68
00:05:07,068 --> 00:05:11,129
...may I present you
with the key to the city.

69
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:12,704
Thank you, sir.

70
00:05:16,777 --> 00:05:17,971
Thank you.

71
00:05:34,428 --> 00:05:36,123
As you were.

72
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,465
Now listen up.

73
00:05:40,935 --> 00:05:42,732
I just came in directly...

74
00:05:42,937 --> 00:05:45,132
...from the Pentagon...

75
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:49,435
...and you better believe there's
a damn good reason that I did.

76
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:52,742
Because God has given us...

77
00:05:52,947 --> 00:05:56,405
...one of the greatest gifts
in the world:

78
00:05:56,817 --> 00:05:58,546
Chemicals.

79
00:05:59,587 --> 00:06:04,183
Now you people, you like to go sit
in church on Sunday, don't you?

80
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:07,050
You like to sit and watch
the Super Bowl.

81
00:06:07,261 --> 00:06:08,250
Yeah.

82
00:06:08,462 --> 00:06:10,521
Sit on what?!

83
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:16,131
You sit on molded, plastic seats!

84
00:06:16,904 --> 00:06:20,499
Molded to your well-fed behinds.

85
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:26,275
Now, I don't have to tell you
that America leads the world...

86
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,811
...in high-grade plastics.

87
00:06:28,282 --> 00:06:29,749
We cannot afford...

88
00:06:29,951 --> 00:06:32,647
...a chemical-plastics gap.

89
00:06:33,888 --> 00:06:35,082
Now, listen to me.

90
00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:37,483
Do you want...

91
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:42,061
...our president of the United States
sitting down...

92
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,821
...to write a peace treaty...

93
00:06:45,032 --> 00:06:47,899
...and have his ballpoint pen
bust open...

94
00:06:48,102 --> 00:06:51,299
...and the ink run out all over
his nice, clean pants...

95
00:06:51,505 --> 00:06:53,336
...in front of the world leaders?

96
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,372
No. No.

97
00:06:55,876 --> 00:06:57,707
Now, we all know...

98
00:06:57,912 --> 00:07:02,212
...that last week, half of
this great nation of ours...

99
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,043
...almost bit the bullet...

100
00:07:04,652 --> 00:07:07,120
...if it wasn't for this man here.

101
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:13,659
And all I can say is,
thank the Lord for Superman.

102
00:07:19,634 --> 00:07:21,761
Superman, you saved our bacon...

103
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:24,267
...and I'd like to show our gratitude.

104
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:31,777
This is a small token of our
appreciation...

105
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:36,609
...to show to you for saving us
from a chemical plant disaster.

106
00:07:42,857 --> 00:07:44,552
Thank you very much, general.

107
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:47,256
This is very nice. Thank you.

108
00:07:58,739 --> 00:07:59,671
It's very nice.

109
00:08:07,081 --> 00:08:10,778
Unknown. How am I supposed to know
what "unknown" means?

110
00:08:10,985 --> 00:08:14,011
It means unknown. It means
nobody knows what it means.

111
00:08:14,221 --> 00:08:16,382
<i>- Hello, boss?
- Gus?</i>

112
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:19,724
<i>- Gus Gorman here.
- I know that. How did it go?</i>

113
00:08:20,461 --> 00:08:24,022
You know how they're always trying to
find the secret recipe...

114
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:26,028
...in that chicken in the bucket?

115
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:28,258
And nobody seems to know
the ingredient...

116
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:30,630
...because it's unknown, right?

117
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:35,571
In the Kryptonite there was an unknown
element and Superman didn't die.

118
00:08:36,477 --> 00:08:38,570
He didn't die.

119
00:08:39,246 --> 00:08:41,908
I ask you to kill Superman...

120
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:46,314
...and you're telling me you couldn't
even do that one simple thing.

121
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:51,717
Hello?

122
00:09:05,673 --> 00:09:08,198
He hasn't had an afternoon nap
for years.

123
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:12,072
This is the biggest day of his life.
I don't know how to thank you.

124
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,906
You did with that wonderful lunch.

125
00:09:14,115 --> 00:09:17,278
Oh, well, I do like to cook.

126
00:09:18,319 --> 00:09:20,310
- You'll take some coffee?
- Yes, please.

127
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:22,648
- Decaffeinated, of course.
- Right.

128
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:30,129
Hello? Yes.

129
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:33,197
What?

130
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:35,399
Oh, really?

131
00:09:35,603 --> 00:09:36,797
Yeah, he's here.

132
00:09:37,004 --> 00:09:38,995
I'll tell him. Okay, thanks.
Bye-bye.

133
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:42,109
That was my friend Betty.

134
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:45,801
There's an accident on the bridge.
A trailer crashed through the rail.

135
00:09:46,013 --> 00:09:49,073
It's hanging off the bridge
and the driver's in the cab.

136
00:09:49,617 --> 00:09:52,017
I'm sorry.
I hate to make you rush off.

137
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,982
Well, there's no rush.

138
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:55,586
But the bridge...

139
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,418
It's okay.
I always get there on time.

140
00:09:58,626 --> 00:10:00,287
Come on, let's relax a little.

141
00:10:14,141 --> 00:10:17,633
It's unusual, finding a good-looking
girl like you alone like this.

142
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:33,192
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't
do something about the bridge?

143
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:35,020
What bridge?

144
00:10:40,401 --> 00:10:41,493
You're right.

145
00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:47,468
I have to get going.

146
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,010
Get him out of there. Come on.

147
00:10:58,219 --> 00:10:59,846
Get him out quick!

148
00:11:00,054 --> 00:11:02,784
Get him away. That thing's gonna go.

149
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:19,095
Everybody okay?

150
00:11:20,407 --> 00:11:21,669
What can I do to help?

151
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:23,366
Not much of anything now.

152
00:11:23,577 --> 00:11:26,137
If only you'd gotten here
a minute sooner.

153
00:12:41,388 --> 00:12:44,050
"At a special session
of the General Assembly...

154
00:12:44,258 --> 00:12:47,489
...178 countries voted
to censure Superman...

155
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:50,129
...with only Colombia abstaining."

156
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:51,798
I can tell you one thing.

157
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:55,833
He wasn't so mean and nasty
the other day in Smallville.

158
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:58,470
In fact, he was so full of niceness...

159
00:12:58,672 --> 00:13:01,004
...I hated laying
that big chunk of...

160
00:13:02,743 --> 00:13:03,641
Kryptonite.

161
00:13:03,844 --> 00:13:08,144
Don't you see? That stuff we ran off
in the lab wasn't a failure after all.

162
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:11,284
Right after Gus gave it to him,
he started to turn into...

163
00:13:11,485 --> 00:13:13,578
...an ornery, evil, malicious,
selfish...

164
00:13:13,787 --> 00:13:15,687
- A normal person.
- Yes.

165
00:13:16,323 --> 00:13:19,850
And now that Superman is out
of the nice-guy business...

166
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,687
We can get to work on that oil.

167
00:13:45,486 --> 00:13:49,616
<i>And now, the supreme moment,
as the last runner...</i>

168
00:13:49,823 --> 00:13:53,725
<i>... the one given the great honor
of lighting the ceremonial flame...</i>

169
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:58,057
<i>... runs the last leg of a marathon
that began seven days ago...</i>

170
00:13:58,265 --> 00:14:02,998
<i>... as this torch has been passed
from athlete to athlete...</i>

171
00:14:03,203 --> 00:14:05,899
<i>... for 970 miles...</i>

172
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:07,903
<i>... across the country.</i>

173
00:14:49,116 --> 00:14:52,415
How can he say that pure categories
have no objective meaning...

174
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:55,417
...in transcendental logic?
What about synthetic unity?

175
00:14:58,325 --> 00:15:00,088
Hi, honey! Am I in your way?

176
00:15:00,294 --> 00:15:02,125
Stick around, you might
learn something.

177
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:03,193
Hi, Lorelei.

178
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,025
All the oil tankers in the world
are controlled by computers.

179
00:15:07,234 --> 00:15:10,101
They tell them where to go,
how much oil to pick up...

180
00:15:10,304 --> 00:15:11,999
...and where to deliver it.

181
00:15:12,272 --> 00:15:14,035
Don't they have captains
on these ships?

182
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:15,606
Yes, but they don't need to.

183
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:19,108
That's a throwback to some
sentimental, seafaring baloney.

184
00:15:19,313 --> 00:15:23,044
You will command the tankers to sail
toward a 50-mile area...

185
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,013
...in the middle of
the Atlantic Ocean.

186
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:26,880
And do what?

187
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:29,282
And do nothing.

188
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,685
Just sit there.

189
00:15:32,893 --> 00:15:35,794
How are all the people
gonna get their oil?

190
00:15:36,964 --> 00:15:39,330
You catch on fast, old buddy.

191
00:15:42,102 --> 00:15:45,265
Every oil pump in America is run by...

192
00:15:45,472 --> 00:15:48,202
- Computers. I know.
- Will you stop interrupting?!

193
00:15:48,408 --> 00:15:49,568
I'm sorry.

194
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,676
You will command the pumps
to stop pumping.

195
00:15:53,881 --> 00:15:57,817
Then I want you to program
one special command...

196
00:15:58,018 --> 00:16:00,077
...into all these systems.

197
00:16:00,287 --> 00:16:03,051
Tell them these orders
are irreversible.

198
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:07,023
So it would be impossible
for anybody to switch them back.

199
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:09,058
Can you do this for me, old buddy?

200
00:16:09,663 --> 00:16:11,494
Old pal?

201
00:16:18,872 --> 00:16:21,272
You know, you get your way
all the time.

202
00:16:22,476 --> 00:16:24,239
And it's not right.

203
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,773
I want to know when I get a taste.

204
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:39,521
I think you've already had
a taste of freedom, haven't you?

205
00:16:39,726 --> 00:16:42,251
Or would you prefer jail?

206
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:44,293
You can't run that jail number on me.

207
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:48,226
Because I know I mean more to you
out here doing things for you...

208
00:16:48,435 --> 00:16:51,097
...than sitting in jail
doing nothing for nobody.

209
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,872
I see.

210
00:16:54,074 --> 00:16:55,974
What do you want?

211
00:17:02,316 --> 00:17:04,784
What? A waste basket?

212
00:17:04,985 --> 00:17:07,078
No. These are plans.

213
00:17:07,988 --> 00:17:09,478
Blueprints.

214
00:17:10,057 --> 00:17:12,082
- For what?
- A computer.

215
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:15,090
- We've already got computers.
- No, not like this.

216
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:18,787
There's not a computer like this
in the whole world, anyplace.

217
00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:21,230
It doesn't exist.
You see...

218
00:17:21,568 --> 00:17:22,830
...we have to build it.

219
00:17:23,403 --> 00:17:24,427
What will it do?

220
00:17:24,805 --> 00:17:26,636
Anything I tell it.

221
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:29,334
What will it do for me?

222
00:17:29,543 --> 00:17:33,775
For you? It will do anything you
tell me to tell it to do for you.

223
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,778
Tell me.

224
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,989
First of all, if anyone attacks
this machine or anything...

225
00:17:47,194 --> 00:17:49,094
...the computer counterattacks it.

226
00:17:49,296 --> 00:17:52,288
It finds their witnesses
and wipes them out.

227
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:53,890
<i>Right, old buddy.</i>

228
00:17:54,101 --> 00:17:57,867
<i>You deal with my oil
and I'll build you your machine.</i>

229
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,202
<i>Okay, I'll do it.</i>

230
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,937
<i>But I'm not so sure about
this irreversible business.</i>

231
00:18:24,097 --> 00:18:26,759
They all kind of went...
What the hell?

232
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,638
That's it. The last tanker.

233
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:36,240
They're all mine now.
All mine.

234
00:18:38,512 --> 00:18:40,742
Not quite.

235
00:18:40,948 --> 00:18:43,416
What's that in
the upper-middle quadrant?

236
00:18:44,451 --> 00:18:45,918
It's a tanker.

237
00:18:48,055 --> 00:18:50,023
And it's going the wrong way.

238
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:01,927
Skipper?

239
00:19:02,135 --> 00:19:04,797
There it is again.
"Proceed immediately to...

240
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:08,031
...latitude 30 north,
longitude 45 west.

241
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,437
There await further orders."

242
00:19:11,645 --> 00:19:13,772
Hell, that's the middle
of the Atlantic.

243
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:16,882
I'm not taking my ship there
to "await further orders"...

244
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:18,642
...no matter what that says.

245
00:19:18,852 --> 00:19:22,447
We're supposed to go to Metropolis,
and we're going to Metropolis.

246
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:23,884
All right.

247
00:19:36,303 --> 00:19:37,600
That's where she is.

248
00:19:37,804 --> 00:19:39,863
Come on, get it up there.

249
00:19:41,308 --> 00:19:42,297
<i>Miss?</i>

250
00:19:43,243 --> 00:19:45,473
<i>Miss, can you hear me?</i>

251
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,341
<i>Listen, we are here to help you.</i>

252
00:19:48,548 --> 00:19:52,006
<i>Don't jump. I repeat, do not jump!</i>

253
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,019
Thought you'd never come.

254
00:19:55,889 --> 00:19:58,619
Don't expect me to save you.
I don't do that anymore.

255
00:19:58,825 --> 00:19:59,883
Don't worry.

256
00:20:00,093 --> 00:20:02,789
I'm long past saving.

257
00:20:09,903 --> 00:20:11,666
Don't let me keep you from anything.

258
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:13,897
I'm not in a rush.

259
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,748
What did you have in mind?

260
00:20:22,115 --> 00:20:23,639
Lots of things.

261
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,147
Oh, yeah?

262
00:20:28,255 --> 00:20:31,156
If you'll just do me
one little favor first.

263
00:20:31,358 --> 00:20:32,723
What's that?

264
00:20:35,495 --> 00:20:37,725
See, there's this little boat...

265
00:20:37,931 --> 00:20:41,594
...and it's not going where
it's supposed to go and...

266
00:21:18,271 --> 00:21:19,898
Stop all engines!

267
00:21:20,907 --> 00:21:22,602
Stop all engines!

268
00:22:15,962 --> 00:22:17,486
Hi.

269
00:22:33,046 --> 00:22:35,446
How about a little après-ski?

270
00:22:46,426 --> 00:22:47,825
Champagne?

271
00:23:11,585 --> 00:23:13,416
Take your turn like everybody else!

272
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,679
Stop it!

273
00:23:18,425 --> 00:23:20,450
He's coming over here, Martha.

274
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,429
Don't you do that!

275
00:23:35,308 --> 00:23:37,276
Hit him with your handbag!

276
00:23:40,847 --> 00:23:44,180
Help me! Please, help me.
Somebody's beating up my husband.

277
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,979
- I've gotta call the police.
- Jack, go with her, okay?

278
00:23:49,055 --> 00:23:51,546
The third one today,
and at night it's worse.

279
00:23:51,758 --> 00:23:53,555
Somebody's behind this.

280
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,557
You can't say there's no oil.

281
00:23:55,762 --> 00:23:58,060
You can't say someone's
not getting rich off this.

282
00:23:58,265 --> 00:24:00,096
Someone's always getting rich.

283
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,291
You know who suffers?
The small guy.

284
00:24:02,502 --> 00:24:05,733
<i>The east coast gets the brunt
of the spill.</i>

285
00:24:48,448 --> 00:24:50,973
No, I cannot go out with you tonight.

286
00:24:51,418 --> 00:24:52,942
I'm busy tomorrow night too.

287
00:24:53,153 --> 00:24:54,916
Oh, yeah? Doing what?

288
00:24:55,355 --> 00:24:57,186
I'll think of something. Look...

289
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:00,018
...I gotta go. Ricky needs me.

290
00:25:00,727 --> 00:25:03,855
Brad, please stop calling me.
I've told you!

291
00:25:04,064 --> 00:25:06,089
Well, you listen to me, huh?

292
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,267
You better start appreciating
ol' Brad.

293
00:25:08,702 --> 00:25:10,226
What else you got in Smallville?

294
00:25:16,176 --> 00:25:18,701
What else have I got in Smallville?

295
00:25:20,246 --> 00:25:22,237
I think I got the right answer.

296
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:24,315
So do I.

297
00:25:33,393 --> 00:25:37,090
Smallville Airport, what flights
do you have to Metropolis tomorrow?

298
00:25:42,736 --> 00:25:45,261
- Where do I put this?
- Over there.

299
00:25:46,973 --> 00:25:50,033
- Where do you want this?
- Load it up there.

300
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:29,207
Just leave him alone.

301
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,097
I can't get through.
Something's happening.

302
00:26:53,306 --> 00:26:55,103
Hey, look! Superman's drunk!

303
00:26:55,308 --> 00:26:57,469
I want to see what's happening here.

304
00:27:02,582 --> 00:27:04,709
- Thank you.
- It's a disgrace, that's what.

305
00:27:04,918 --> 00:27:07,716
Nobody's ever gonna trust
that creep again.

306
00:27:07,921 --> 00:27:09,354
He's washed up.

307
00:27:12,859 --> 00:27:15,555
What are you looking at? Huh?

308
00:27:15,962 --> 00:27:19,159
Excuse me. Superman?
It's me, Ricky.

309
00:27:19,365 --> 00:27:21,026
Ricky from Smallville.

310
00:27:21,267 --> 00:27:22,996
Tell them you won't hurt anybody!

311
00:27:23,203 --> 00:27:24,363
He's changed.

312
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:27,199
No! Maybe he's just sick.

313
00:27:27,407 --> 00:27:29,272
Superman, please get better!

314
00:27:29,476 --> 00:27:30,909
He's not listening to you.

315
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,910
Yes, he is. He can hear me.
He's got super-hearing.

316
00:27:35,114 --> 00:27:37,708
Superman, you're just in a slump!

317
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:39,646
You'll be great again!

318
00:27:39,853 --> 00:27:41,343
You can do it, Superman!

319
00:27:41,554 --> 00:27:44,523
<i>Superman, you can hear me, can't you?</i>

320
00:27:44,724 --> 00:27:47,284
<i>Superman, you're just in a slump.</i>

321
00:27:47,494 --> 00:27:51,055
<i>You'll be great again.
You can do it, Superman.</i>

322
00:28:14,487 --> 00:28:15,476
He's gone nuts!

323
00:28:17,423 --> 00:28:18,412
Come on!

324
00:29:45,378 --> 00:29:47,346
I can give as good as I get.

325
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:51,473
Yeah? All right, come on!
Come on!

326
00:29:51,684 --> 00:29:53,379
Come on! Come on!

327
00:30:18,878 --> 00:30:21,506
What's the matter, Kent?
Too warm for you, huh?

328
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,414
Come on, chicken! Come and get me.

329
00:30:26,619 --> 00:30:28,883
You've been on my nerves
a long time!

330
00:30:50,777 --> 00:30:52,870
You always wanted to fly, Kent.

331
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,307
Now's your chance.

332
00:35:48,407 --> 00:35:49,396
Skipper!

333
00:36:04,557 --> 00:36:06,957
God, would you look at that!

334
00:36:54,373 --> 00:36:57,001
<i>Miss Lorelei Ambrosia
isn't at home right now.</i>

335
00:36:57,209 --> 00:36:59,404
<i>But if you'd care
to leave a message...</i>

336
00:36:59,612 --> 00:37:01,944
<i>... why not deliver it to her...</i>

337
00:37:02,148 --> 00:37:02,978
<i>... in person?</i>

338
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:06,549
<i>So you've finally shown
your true colors.</i>

339
00:37:06,752 --> 00:37:11,018
<i>Well, if you're looking for us,
here's where you'll find us.</i>

340
00:37:11,223 --> 00:37:12,918
<i>Do drop in.</i>

341
00:37:19,532 --> 00:37:21,159
This is fun!

342
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,625
Fun? The fun's just starting.

343
00:37:24,236 --> 00:37:27,069
Wait till Superman finds us,
then you'll see some fun.

344
00:37:27,273 --> 00:37:29,639
Wait, you gonna mess with Superman?

345
00:37:29,942 --> 00:37:33,935
Let's go. I want to be ready for him
when he falls into our trap.

346
00:37:34,246 --> 00:37:38,080
I just don't see why you can't
balloon down like the rest of us.

347
00:37:38,284 --> 00:37:39,376
Well...

348
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,312
No way. Uh-uh.

349
00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:45,012
I just don't believe a man can fly.

350
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:04,199
Watch out, horsy!

351
00:38:13,953 --> 00:38:16,046
Don't, don't, don't.

352
00:38:16,255 --> 00:38:18,655
Just don't try to fly.

353
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:20,357
Don't try to fly!

354
00:38:33,606 --> 00:38:36,040
Will you get out of my way!

355
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,192
- Hurry! Hurry up!
- I am hurrying.

356
00:39:02,768 --> 00:39:05,066
- I can't see anything.
- Turn on the light.

357
00:39:05,271 --> 00:39:08,001
- Where's the light switch?
- Where do you usually find it?

358
00:39:08,207 --> 00:39:10,505
I don't know.
I guess I'll check the doorway.

359
00:39:10,709 --> 00:39:14,577
God, it's pitch-black in here.
Oh, that's better.

360
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:20,780
Wow, what a jukebox!

361
00:39:20,986 --> 00:39:22,920
I told you, didn't I?

362
00:39:23,122 --> 00:39:25,386
There. The ultimate computer!

363
00:39:32,565 --> 00:39:36,331
It does everything a computer can do
and 1000 things none of them can!

364
00:39:36,535 --> 00:39:37,934
Let's give it a dry run.

365
00:39:38,137 --> 00:39:40,071
Wait. We've gotta wait for Gus.

366
00:39:40,272 --> 00:39:41,569
Who needs Gus?

367
00:39:41,774 --> 00:39:45,107
- Only he can operate it.
- Like fish, he is!

368
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:48,542
I know enough about computers
to put a Ph.D. To shame.

369
00:39:48,747 --> 00:39:51,307
Come now, brother dear,
you didn't think...

370
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:54,179
...I'd let that little man
run the show, did you?

371
00:39:54,553 --> 00:39:56,578
Why don't peons tidy up
when they're done?

372
00:39:56,789 --> 00:39:59,587
Come on, Bubba, it's showtime.

373
00:40:03,028 --> 00:40:05,690
Engage those buttons to
activate the alpha circuit...

374
00:40:05,898 --> 00:40:07,263
...and lock the modular grid.

375
00:40:07,466 --> 00:40:12,369
You! Activate circuits
29 through W-7...

376
00:40:12,571 --> 00:40:16,632
...and start full-power coordinates
on exterior defensive systems.

377
00:40:16,842 --> 00:40:19,743
In other words, push this red button.

378
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:22,570
How did you know about that?

379
00:40:40,532 --> 00:40:41,521
He's here!

380
00:40:41,734 --> 00:40:43,793
Let's give him
something to worry about.

381
00:40:45,804 --> 00:40:47,271
Now, let's see...

382
00:40:47,706 --> 00:40:50,106
Tracking systems locked.

383
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:17,592
Let the games begin.

384
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:20,196
Don't tense up now, honey.

385
00:41:52,738 --> 00:41:55,605
Come on, Bubba,
you're wasting your rockets.

386
00:42:03,048 --> 00:42:05,141
Come on, Superman!

387
00:42:06,218 --> 00:42:08,083
Let him have it, Ross.

388
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,791
Bubba, keep firing.

389
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:19,623
Keep him occupied
while I get the MX ready.

390
00:42:46,892 --> 00:42:49,087
What the hell is going on?

391
00:42:57,169 --> 00:43:00,866
Keep your rockets coming. He won't
notice the missile till too late!

392
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:11,208
So much for your catlike reflexes.

393
00:43:21,693 --> 00:43:22,523
Oh, God!

394
00:43:33,238 --> 00:43:36,173
No more. Look, you sit.

395
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:38,172
Sit, sit!

396
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,006
Help!

397
00:43:43,749 --> 00:43:44,579
Hello!

398
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:46,914
Get to, jackass!

399
00:43:48,153 --> 00:43:49,450
That's him out of the way.

400
00:43:49,655 --> 00:43:53,751
Sis, how would you like to control
all the world's weapons systems?

401
00:43:54,626 --> 00:43:55,820
Baby!

402
00:43:56,028 --> 00:43:57,495
It's Daddy!

403
00:43:58,564 --> 00:44:00,759
Hey, what are you doing with my baby?

404
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,364
Gus, old buddy, genius.
Come up and join the fun.

405
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:19,842
He's still coming.
Arm the inner defenses.

406
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:25,779
All right, the game's over.

407
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:27,447
Hi, honey.

408
00:44:28,026 --> 00:44:29,186
I don't know you, lady.

409
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:32,458
But the other night...

410
00:44:35,067 --> 00:44:37,262
I'm sorry, but that wasn't me.

411
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:38,800
That guy's gone.

412
00:44:40,572 --> 00:44:42,039
And you're next, Webster.

413
00:44:43,175 --> 00:44:46,576
Never underestimate
the power of computers.

414
00:44:46,879 --> 00:44:48,210
How do you like it?

415
00:44:48,413 --> 00:44:50,938
I think it's typical
of people like you, Webster.

416
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:54,617
Instead of helping others,
you four just help yourselves.

417
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:55,980
Four...

418
00:44:56,188 --> 00:44:57,120
...of you?

419
00:44:57,322 --> 00:44:59,415
You mean, us? Four? Wait...

420
00:44:59,625 --> 00:45:01,286
Hey, man!

421
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:05,156
That's only his last name.
He likes to be called "Superman."

422
00:45:05,931 --> 00:45:08,559
See, I'm not with them, Superman.

423
00:45:09,167 --> 00:45:10,566
You could've fooled me.

424
00:45:18,911 --> 00:45:20,401
That's very good.

425
00:45:22,881 --> 00:45:26,373
Let's see how long
he can carry on without any air.

426
00:45:48,507 --> 00:45:50,475
He's still coming!
He's going to get me!

427
00:45:50,676 --> 00:45:51,768
Don't bet on it!

428
00:46:04,456 --> 00:46:05,821
You're hurting him.

429
00:46:09,928 --> 00:46:11,987
- That's Kryptonite!
- Yes.

430
00:46:12,197 --> 00:46:14,722
- This time we got it right!
- You're a genius.

431
00:46:15,267 --> 00:46:18,828
You've invented a machine
that can find anybody's weak spot.

432
00:46:19,371 --> 00:46:20,861
Congratulations, old buddy.

433
00:46:21,073 --> 00:46:24,304
You'll go down in history
as the man who killed Superman!

434
00:46:24,509 --> 00:46:25,737
I'm... No.

435
00:46:26,445 --> 00:46:27,742
Superman!

436
00:46:27,946 --> 00:46:28,810
No!

437
00:46:30,115 --> 00:46:32,310
- Where do you think you're going?
- Never mind.

438
00:46:32,517 --> 00:46:35,384
- Turn the power up.
- Don't you think he's had enough?

439
00:46:39,224 --> 00:46:40,521
Turn it up!

440
00:46:40,726 --> 00:46:42,819
Power! More power!

441
00:47:04,249 --> 00:47:06,945
Seventy-five. Current 7.75.

442
00:47:11,023 --> 00:47:15,790
There's a current level of 7
that is not supposed to be on bar...

443
00:47:15,994 --> 00:47:17,552
Oh, here it is!

444
00:47:44,322 --> 00:47:45,254
What's going on?

445
00:47:46,124 --> 00:47:47,955
I don't know. The power's gone.

446
00:47:48,427 --> 00:47:50,327
Gus must have pulled the plug out.

447
00:47:50,796 --> 00:47:52,263
It worked.

448
00:47:52,464 --> 00:47:54,796
It worked! I got it!

449
00:47:58,837 --> 00:48:00,304
What have you got?

450
00:48:02,808 --> 00:48:04,571
- Give me that screw.
- This screw?

451
00:48:04,776 --> 00:48:06,903
- That screw.
- Never!

452
00:48:36,408 --> 00:48:37,500
What?

453
00:48:40,345 --> 00:48:41,812
Holy!

454
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,541
No! Make it stop!

455
00:48:46,151 --> 00:48:47,618
I can't! It's out of control!

456
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:50,982
But how?
Where's it getting the power from?

457
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,754
It's feeding itself.

458
00:48:56,962 --> 00:48:58,224
It wants to live!

459
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,280
It's this thing here.
We'll go to the zoo.

460
00:49:23,488 --> 00:49:26,753
I'll do that tomorrow,
and then we'll go on to the...

461
00:49:27,859 --> 00:49:30,384
- What's happening?
- It's okay, Ricky.

462
00:49:30,662 --> 00:49:31,822
Put the lights on!

463
00:49:51,783 --> 00:49:53,808
Stop it! You're killing him!

464
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,985
Stop it!

465
00:50:09,434 --> 00:50:10,867
Hey. Put me down!

466
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:31,213
Don't leave us alone
in here! Superman!

467
00:50:35,727 --> 00:50:36,557
Oh, I get it.

468
00:50:36,761 --> 00:50:40,424
The coaxial energy shaft is engaging
the grid source factor. Right.

469
00:50:40,632 --> 00:50:42,463
We're through, pugface.
I'm splitting.

470
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:44,225
Hey, wait a minute!

471
00:50:46,771 --> 00:50:49,433
Girls. Girls, come out of there!

472
00:51:07,993 --> 00:51:09,119
Sis?

473
00:51:12,964 --> 00:51:14,261
Oh, my God.

474
00:51:21,873 --> 00:51:23,135
What is that?

475
00:51:38,556 --> 00:51:40,683
Sis, it's your Bubba!

476
00:52:18,797 --> 00:52:20,424
Help me. Help!

477
00:52:22,634 --> 00:52:23,931
Superman!

478
00:52:27,072 --> 00:52:28,061
Honey!

479
00:52:28,273 --> 00:52:32,141
Honey, I'm stuck here! Help!
What about me?

480
00:52:43,355 --> 00:52:44,344
Look out!

481
00:54:53,651 --> 00:54:54,845
Bubba?

482
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:42,928
Thank you, brother.

483
00:55:49,974 --> 00:55:51,669
Regular or premium?

484
00:55:51,876 --> 00:55:55,972
She hasn't had a drink in so long,
give her a tankful of the good stuff.

485
00:55:57,949 --> 00:55:58,881
How you doing?

486
00:55:59,083 --> 00:56:02,177
Please don't talk to me.
I'm having enough trouble hanging on.

487
00:56:02,387 --> 00:56:05,151
Okay, we'll go slow.
You're perfectly safe.

488
00:56:05,757 --> 00:56:07,156
I won't argue with you.

489
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:10,452
Any man who can trick my machine
can do anything.

490
00:56:10,662 --> 00:56:12,357
How did you beat my defenses?

491
00:56:12,564 --> 00:56:15,965
Those defenses are good as long as
it didn't know it's in trouble.

492
00:56:16,201 --> 00:56:19,693
This time it didn't see the danger.
I went in with plain old acid.

493
00:56:19,904 --> 00:56:23,533
It didn't know that when acid gets hot,
it'll eat through anything.

494
00:56:24,075 --> 00:56:25,667
Watch the trees.

495
00:56:26,244 --> 00:56:29,304
I guess it died of acid indigestion.

496
00:56:30,582 --> 00:56:33,142
But what's gonna happen
to Ross and the ladies?

497
00:56:33,351 --> 00:56:36,878
They'll have to see the police.
It's not your problem anymore.

498
00:56:38,423 --> 00:56:39,947
Are we in Metropolis yet?

499
00:56:40,158 --> 00:56:43,252
Nope. I'm just gonna make
a little stop. Right over there.

500
00:56:50,935 --> 00:56:52,596
We're on the ground, Gus.

501
00:56:53,638 --> 00:56:55,629
- You okay, Supe?
- I'm fine.

502
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,000
Excuse me.

503
00:57:01,379 --> 00:57:03,142
Can you guys spare one of these?

504
00:57:04,048 --> 00:57:06,744
- Sure, Superman.
- It is Superman, isn't it?

505
00:57:06,951 --> 00:57:08,942
Are you kidding? Is that?

506
00:57:09,153 --> 00:57:11,883
Didn't you see us fly out of the sky?

507
00:57:13,091 --> 00:57:17,653
We're the only two men who can fly.
"Is it Superman?"

508
00:57:17,862 --> 00:57:18,692
Just right.

509
00:57:20,231 --> 00:57:21,255
Okay, let's go.

510
00:57:21,466 --> 00:57:24,526
I was afraid you'd say that.
I thought I'd take the bus.

511
00:57:25,036 --> 00:57:28,369
Well, suit yourself.
Does your boss have a computer here?

512
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:31,641
Yeah, he got a little bitty one
about that big.

513
00:57:31,843 --> 00:57:35,472
You tell him he can do a lot worse
than to give Gus Gorman here a job.

514
00:57:37,715 --> 00:57:39,307
Wow, thank you, Supe.

515
00:57:39,751 --> 00:57:40,683
Take care.

516
00:57:42,587 --> 00:57:44,077
I'll see you around.

517
00:57:50,161 --> 00:57:51,253
So long.

518
00:57:54,299 --> 00:57:55,994
Take it easy, man.

519
00:57:57,368 --> 00:58:01,600
Well, you got good references,
so if you want that job...

520
00:58:05,643 --> 00:58:08,407
Nah, this is not for me.
I think I'll take that bus.

521
00:58:08,613 --> 00:58:10,513
Where's the bus station?

522
00:58:10,715 --> 00:58:13,309
Yeah, about 9, 10 miles
over there.

523
00:58:13,518 --> 00:58:16,043
Nine or 10 miles.

524
00:58:18,156 --> 00:58:20,215
Hey. You really flew with him?

525
00:58:20,425 --> 00:58:23,451
Superman?
Have you ever seen Superman before?

526
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:30,256
Oh, you don't know about me and him?
Me and Superman?

527
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,772
Yeah, we go way back together.

528
00:58:37,975 --> 00:58:40,637
We always, usually, sometimes, we...

529
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,843
Nine or 10 miles?

530
00:58:44,382 --> 00:58:46,316
I think I'll walk.

531
00:58:46,684 --> 00:58:48,083
Yeah, I'll walk.

532
00:58:54,926 --> 00:58:56,154
Clark.

533
00:58:56,494 --> 00:58:59,486
What a nice surprise! Come in.

534
00:58:59,697 --> 00:59:00,891
Hi, Mr. Kent.

535
00:59:01,466 --> 00:59:03,900
- Guess who Mom's having dinner with?
- Who?

536
00:59:04,102 --> 00:59:05,467
Superman!

537
00:59:06,037 --> 00:59:08,232
Yeah, that's what I came to tell you.

538
00:59:08,439 --> 00:59:10,339
Superman said to tell you he's sorry...

539
00:59:10,541 --> 00:59:14,102
...but he's run into a problem
and he can't make dinner with you.

540
00:59:14,312 --> 00:59:16,678
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.

541
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:19,714
Would you mind settling for me?

542
00:59:19,917 --> 00:59:21,179
Any day.

543
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,348
I'll get my things.

544
00:59:25,289 --> 00:59:28,781
Lana, I was talking
to Superman the other day.

545
00:59:28,993 --> 00:59:32,759
You know, he and I, we talk a lot.

546
00:59:33,264 --> 00:59:36,597
He felt badly about you having
to pawn your diamond ring.

547
00:59:39,704 --> 00:59:41,171
Well, he found...

548
00:59:42,407 --> 00:59:45,604
He found this one just lying around.

549
00:59:46,911 --> 00:59:49,345
He wanted you to have this.

550
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:58,154
Wow, a ring from Superman!

551
00:59:59,323 --> 01:00:01,450
- It's okay. I got it.
- Sorry.

552
01:00:03,561 --> 01:00:05,893
- Oh, Clark.
- It's okay.

553
01:00:06,097 --> 01:00:07,359
It fits.

554
01:00:07,899 --> 01:00:09,230
It looks really pretty.

555
01:00:09,434 --> 01:00:10,492
Thank you.

556
01:00:13,638 --> 01:00:14,696
Brad.

557
01:00:15,173 --> 01:00:16,197
Son of a bitch.

558
01:00:18,042 --> 01:00:19,976
Kent, I hate you.

559
01:00:20,912 --> 01:00:22,812
I've always hated you.

560
01:00:23,347 --> 01:00:25,144
- You know why?
- No.

561
01:00:25,349 --> 01:00:26,907
- Because you're nice.
- Not really.

562
01:00:27,118 --> 01:00:28,585
And nice guys finish last.

563
01:00:40,364 --> 01:00:41,991
Lois, I've got to hand it to you.

564
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,600
Who else could turn
a vacation into a story...

565
01:00:44,802 --> 01:00:47,771
...that'll blow the lid off
of corruption in the Caribbean?

566
01:00:47,972 --> 01:00:51,271
I knew I was onto something
when that taxi driver kidnapped me.

567
01:00:51,476 --> 01:00:53,467
Lois, you're terrific.

568
01:00:53,678 --> 01:00:57,512
I have to be.
Seems I've got some new competition.

569
01:00:58,983 --> 01:01:01,508
The story that you wrote
on the class reunion?

570
01:01:01,719 --> 01:01:03,516
- I thought it was terrific.
- Thanks.

571
01:01:03,721 --> 01:01:07,316
And fascinating. I liked the part
about the little girl back home.

572
01:01:07,525 --> 01:01:09,755
I'll take you to lunch
and you tell me about it.

573
01:01:10,628 --> 01:01:13,893
I'd love to, but I'm having lunch
with Mr. White's new secretary.

574
01:01:14,098 --> 01:01:15,087
- Hi, Lana.
- Hi, Clark.

575
01:01:15,299 --> 01:01:19,599
Lois, say hello to Lana Lang.
Smallville's newest gift to Metropolis.

576
01:01:19,804 --> 01:01:22,238
Glad to meet you.
I like your writing a lot.

577
01:01:22,607 --> 01:01:23,699
Thank you.

578
01:01:24,675 --> 01:01:26,006
I like your sparkler a lot.

579
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:29,145
Me too. I couldn't believe it
when Clark gave it to me.

580
01:01:30,615 --> 01:01:32,344
Clark gave it to you?

581
01:01:35,486 --> 01:01:36,851
Mr. White.

582
01:01:37,054 --> 01:01:40,182
Mr. White, look what I've got for you.

583
01:01:40,391 --> 01:01:43,292
People, I am in love
with this machine!

584
01:01:43,494 --> 01:01:48,090
Excuse me, but I have a couple
of errands to run before lunch.

585
01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:51,029
- Go ahead, Mr. White.
- Where's the handle?

586
01:01:51,235 --> 01:01:54,500
There is no handle.
You just push the button.

587
01:02:49,611 --> 01:02:52,447
Giorgio, por favore?

588
01:02:52,655 --> 01:02:54,699
Grazie.
