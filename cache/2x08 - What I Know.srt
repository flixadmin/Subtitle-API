1
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,470
Okay, this is insane.

2
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,640
-We need more Compound V!
—Absolutely.

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,050
We need more Supes!

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:22,230
More Supes! More Supes! More Supes!

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,310
Come with me.

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,690
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,690
I'm sleeping in a basement
beneath a pawn shop in East Flatbush.

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,150
I never wanted that for you.

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,610
We have
Ryan's best interests at heart.

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,280
- I want us to be a family.
- They flew me up and showed me!

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,410
This house, the neighbours are fake.
You're fake.

12
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,330
No! Ryan!

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,500
You have five minutes
to make your opening...

14
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,930
There's a supervillain
on your school campus.

15
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,850
You hear the calls of distress.

16
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,020
You witness a violent display
of superpowers.

17
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,190
What do you do?

18
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,850
I'm Sheriff Ed Flanagan,

19
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,940
and I'm here with Homelander
to talk about school safety.

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,440
On the first report
of an active supervillain,

21
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,780
a hero will immediately
rush to your campus.

22
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:20,080
But to stay alive in the moment,
remember, stay calm and follow the LAW.

23
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,040
Lock all doors and windows.

24
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,750
Arm yourselves.

25
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,460
Your teacher should have
an authorized firearm.

26
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,670
But use whatever you can.

27
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,180
And wait for a hero.

28
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,230
Unfortunately, the possibility that
you Will experience a supervillain attack

29
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,770
grows more likely every day.

30
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,820
By having an action plan,
you can increase your chances of survival.

31
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,360
And survival is all that matters.

32
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,200
- Coverage of the attack...
- Jody! Where's my flag pin?

33
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,490
How should I know?

34
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,870
Well, I can't go to this thing
without a flag pin.

35
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,870
Bob, before he makes any decisions,
just let me talk to him.

36
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,170
One, the president doesn't like you,
he used the word "standoffish."

37
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,260
And two, he's decided.

38
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,630
He's declaring a national emergency,
bypassing the FDA,

39
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,680
and authorizing Compound V for use
by law enforcement and first responders.

40
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,560
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- I wish I were.

41
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,810
Doses are going for 5 million a pop.

42
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,440
Pentagon's got a big order in,
and ICE is next in line.

43
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,320
You can't release V into the mainstream,
we're talking an avalanche of Supes.

44
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
It's suicide.

45
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,280
In one hour,
I will be standing at the memorial service

46
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,950
for the fallen heroes of the House attack,
with my flag pin!

47
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,620
Giving my thoughts and prayers
and pledging to keep America safe.

48
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,080
The best way to do that
is with Compound V.

49
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,830
We know. We there, remember?

50
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,920
Covered in my chief of staff's brains.
There was no terrorist, it was Vought.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,960
It's a fucking coup.

52
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,130
- A bunch of their guys died too.
- To cover their own tracks.

53
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,600
For the record, I agree with you.
And I hate this.

54
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,930
But you've got no proof.

55
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,850
Folks are scared.

56
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,150
If Vought took a shit
in the middle of Fifth Avenue,

57
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,900
they'd throw a ticker tape parade.

58
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,980
- Here's what we do have, Bob...
- Let me guess.

59
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,280
A tape of me fucking my kid's nanny
at her daughter's quinceañera?

60
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,410
Release it, please, I'm begging you.

61
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,990
A plumb gig at Fox
and this shithole in my rear-view?

62
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
Sounds dreamy.

63
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,210
Okay, what if we got hard proof?
A witness? Anything?

64
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,540
If you could get
Jesus Christ himself,

65
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,670
or maybe Homelander
in front of a camera, sure.

66
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,760
I really am sorry.

67
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,850
Improved by KID 

Resynced by KID 

Enjoy the movie(s) / show(s)

68
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,500
I'm nervous about driving
in the city.

69
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,590
You'll be okay. The plan again?

70
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:25,220
Okay, drive straight to Gen's in Sedona.
Cash for gasoline, no hotels.

71
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,600
- I don't wanna leave you here.
- I'll be fine.

72
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,650
The anxious boy? Really?
With the moist handshake?

73
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,190
- Mom! God.
- Okay. All right, okay.

74
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,270
Um.

75
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,070
You need a new one.

76
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,450
I—...

77
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,700
I'm not gonna wear it.

78
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,500
I don't care if you wear it.
I just want you to have it.

79
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,210
I love you.

80
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,000
I love you too.

81
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,130
You be safe.

82
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,510
- Okay.
- Bye.

83
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,470
Hey.

84
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,020
- What's going on?
- They've lost their minds.

85
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,560
The RPG releases
an electromagnetic pulse on impact.

86
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,190
Should cut through
Stormfront's plasma bolts.

87
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,230
- How sure are you?
- It's a guesstimate.

88
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,940
So that's Stormfront.

89
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,990
And thanks to Starlight, we know
that Noir needs any fucking tree nut.

90
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,070
How about A-Train?

91
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,570
Enough epinephrine
to blow up that motherfucker's heart.

92
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,540
- Hey, we can't just kill everyone.
- That is exactly what we're gonna do.

93
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,410
Listen, you heard Mallory,
she said all we need is another witness.

94
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,040
Wile E. Coyote.

95
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,090
Always chases Road Runner.

96
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,800
Always with an elaborate plan.
Always fails.

97
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,220
I always say, why do this, Coyote?

98
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,850
All you need is an AR-15
and "meep-meep," no more.

99
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,810
Exactly. See? We're just gonna shoot
Road Runner in the fucking head.

100
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,100
That won't stop Vought.
That won't stop Compound V.

101
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,900
If you kill these Supes,
Vought will just make a thousand more.

102
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,480
I'm gonna top those cunts too.

103
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,690
Great. So that's settled.

104
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,610
- We're just supervillains now?
- Vought attacked the country, Hughie.

105
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,910
Fuck them all.

106
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,120
What if I testify?

107
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,700
Escaped convicts
don't have a ton of credibility.

108
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,500
No, but maybe I know someone who does.

109
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,340
Give us the day.

110
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,550
Hughie.

111
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,130
See you later.

112
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,800
...officials are still trying to determine
the perpetrator of the Capitol attack.

113
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:37,430
The Department of Homeland Security
has issued a crimson terror alert.

114
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,900
In Washington, all government buildings...

115
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,520
- How's Noir?
- Unresponsive.

116
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,440
They don't think there's brain damage,
but it's hard to tell.

117
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,780
Noir's a vegetable.
Lamplighter's a charcoal briquette.

118
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,870
Starlight's in the breeze somewhere.
And you're, what, fine with it?

119
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,330
Yes, because none of that matters anymore.
Because of this.

120
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,710
So far, no terrorist group
has claimed responsibility...

121
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:04,000
- All right. So, you didn't do this.
- I wish I'd killed Vogelbaum.

122
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,920
- But, no, it wasn't me.
- Right.

123
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,800
And there's no supervillains
on American soil.

124
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,300
- None that we know of.
- Then that means...

125
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,850
It's Edgar.

126
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,020
Maybe. I mean, he is pretty smart,
especially for his kind.

127
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,270
...Compound V to members of the military
and law enforcement...

128
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,280
Hey, smile. This is good news.

129
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,280
Yes, there have been sacrifices,

130
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,160
but we are this close
to no more premieres or paparazzi.

131
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,660
Or screaming fans
or any of that dancing-monkey shit.

132
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,080
We have to make sure that
the right people get the doses,

133
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,130
but it is a whole new world.

134
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,300
What about the wrong people?

135
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,920
Couple of billion of them,
they're not just gonna sit there.

136
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,970
Don't worry, silly.
Frederick had a solution for everything.

137
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,610
Okay. There's something really important
that I've been meaning to ask you.

138
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,360
Last I checked, you're not 57 years old.

139
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,240
So, come on,
why is it always, always Billy Joel?

140
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,740
- I'm 57 on the inside.
- No, really. Please.

141
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,910
It was just the music
in my house growing up.

142
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,250
I did some somersaults
to "You May Be Right"

143
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,500
that were pretty thrilling to watch.

144
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,720
♪ Only the good die young
That's what I'm saying... ♪

145
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,140
Butcher is right, you know.

146
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,470
We've already tried
to take Vought down the right way.

147
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,720
This isn't gonna work.

148
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,600
This is not gonna stop Compound V
from getting out there.

149
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,900
So it's hopeless?
Just kill them all, let God sort them out?

150
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,980
I mean...

151
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,690
Then why are you even helping me?

152
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,410
Why did you save me at the Tower?

153
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,410
They were gonna hurt you.

154
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,660
You could've gotten yourself killed.

155
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,830
I mean, after the way that I treated you,
you had every reason to give up on me.

156
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,380
So why didn't you?

157
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,920
I just... would never.

158
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,680
That's why I'm helping.

159
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,900
You were stupid to text.

160
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,700
Everyone's looking for you.

161
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,860
Where's Elena?

162
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,990
This is the guy?

163
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,160
Um...

164
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,660
I'm... Hi. Hughie.

165
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,000
He's even more of a twink
than in the photo.

166
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,960
I could split that shit like dry firewood.

167
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,590
Big fan.

168
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,800
I need to ask you something.

169
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,390
It's a lot.

170
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,430
- I need you to testify.
- Testify?

171
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,850
On the record.

172
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,190
Against Vought, against Homelander,
Stormfront, everything.

173
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:19,110
-And why would I do that?
Because things are really bad, and...

174
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,330
you're our last chance.

175
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,450
Pass.

176
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,870
- Look, I get that it's dangerous.
- It's suicide.

177
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,130
- But that's not the reason.
- Well, then what is?

178
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,840
I'm tired.

179
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:38,050
We're all tired,
but they're hurting people.

180
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,720
Sooner or later,
they'll hurt someone you love.

181
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Am I talking to you?

182
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,680
Look...

183
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:55,110
I get that it's easier
to just disappear inside of yourself.

184
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,240
Trust me, it's all I want to do.

185
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,030
But we can't, Maeve.

186
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,490
We can't.

187
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,790
- This is a war now, and we...
- Shut the fuck up.

188
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,410
Christ, you...

189
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,830
Haven't I done enough for you?

190
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,210
Didn't I save your fucking life?

191
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,260
It doesn't matter what we do.
Nothing changes.

192
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,440
Nothing ever changes or gets better.

193
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,730
And I'm tired.

194
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,820
Just leave.

195
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,570
Go!

196
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,580
Take your fucking twink
and get the fuck out of here!

197
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,710
Okay.

198
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,000
Come on.

199
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,270
Monsieur Charcuterie, we need you. Now.

200
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,940
He said he lives under a pawn shop
in East Flatbush!

201
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,820
- He has to be here! Help me.
- Let her in.

202
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,200
Billy. They took him.

203
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,870
- They have Ryan.
- Who's got him?

204
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,830
I appreciate you
coming all this way, Stan.

205
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:39,090
Well, I can't exactly be seen
with you at the Tower now, can I?

206
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,920
- Fresca?
- No, thank you. Awful stuff.

207
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,300
So you had a chance
to look over our proposal?

208
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,390
He publicly confessed
to a sexual assault, Alastair.

209
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,690
And we've made a substantial investment
in the Deep's rehabilitation.

210
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,730
Our internal research bureau
shows an impressive Q rating.

211
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,070
He's an asset to Vought
in these troubled times.

212
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,820
What sort of commission
is the church getting these days?

213
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,700
Forty percent? 50?

214
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,370
Sounds like you're open to reinstatement.
That's fantastic.

215
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,870
What about A-Train?

216
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,500
You do need a Speedster
since Shockwave exploded.

217
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,090
Harder sell.
One has-been back is redemption.

218
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,880
Two is weakness.

219
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,050
Stormfront has problems with him.

220
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,640
And at the moment, I have to indulge her.

221
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,680
What's her problem with A-Train?

222
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,900
I understand that she was among
your grandfather's first followers,

223
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,400
back when the Collective was a start-up.

224
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,440
I can neither confirm or deny that.

225
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:50,990
Then your internal research bureau
knows exactly

226
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,580
what Stormfront's problem is with A—Train.

227
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,910
Deep is still a win.

228
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,130
- Shall I have Business Affairs reach out?
- Please do.

229
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,500
Let me walk you out.

230
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,310
Sons of bitches.

231
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,730
Okay, yeah.

232
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,610
Voilà.

233
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,610
Jambon buerre. Simple,
but it's the ingredients, you know?

234
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,410
- Thank you.
- Diet Coke with lime, right?

235
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,330
Yeah. Yeah.

236
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,700
We've heard a lot about you.

237
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,290
I'm sorry, I wish I could say the same.

238
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,250
- Are you all close with Billy?
- Yeah.

239
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,260
I mean, sure.

240
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,010
- Why the hesitation?
- Well...

241
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,930
let's just say he ain't really close
to a lot of people. You know?

242
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,140
- Well, except you, of course.
- I'm close to him.

243
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,940
I am.

244
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,270
- All right, lads, give her some air?
- Yeah.

245
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,150
So Ryan ain't on
any of their social media.

246
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,650
Which is good on one hand,
but it don't help us none.

247
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,780
- So you think he's in the Tower?
- Not sure.

248
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:17,080
You stay here. Rest up.
I'm gonna go do a little digging.

249
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,660
Hey, Billy.

250
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,500
I'm sorry. I have no right to ask you
to help me after what I said to you.

251
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,760
Look, don't you worry, all right?

252
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,140
I will find your son.

253
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,520
Thank you.

254
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,020
Fuck off, you lot.

255
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,530
What is it, Samantha?

256
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,780
Mr. Edgar,
normally I wouldn't put this through,

257
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,330
but the man says it's life or death,
and you know him.

258
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,960
- What's his name?
- William Butcher.

259
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,840
Hi, hi!

260
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,300
We've been having
a super fun time in here.

261
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,550
I've been Googling
the names of the cats in Cats.

262
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:14,090
- Can you believe Ryan has never seen Cats?
- What happened to your hair?

263
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,180
- Nothing.
- Hey, buddy.

264
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:21,390
Sorry we had to leave you all alone.
Dad's work can sometimes get pretty crazy.

265
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,980
He hasn't been alone. I've been here.
I got him all these dipping sauces.

266
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,150
You didn't wanna play
Vought Tournament of Heroes?

267
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,740
- I'm the main guy.
- I was working on my states.

268
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,700
States?

269
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,910
Yeah, I write down all 50 states
as fast as I can

270
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,950
in either alphabetical order
or geographical order.

271
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,710
- You're giving yourself homework?
- Mom says that learning is a gift, so...

272
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,920
That mom of yours, she sure does
have some cute little sayings.

273
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,510
Do you think maybe I could call her?

274
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,810
Hey, Ryan.

275
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,020
I get it.

276
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,110
I would feel lonely too,
if I was cooped up all day by myself

277
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,740
in this West Elm Death Star.

278
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,370
How about we take a field trip?

279
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,410
What do you say, Dad?

280
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,040
Welcome to Planet Vought.

281
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,000
Have a super day.

282
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:33,460
Let's give a warm hero's welcome
to Cashket who's turning five today.

283
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,630
Welcome to Planet Vought.

284
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,640
Would you like to try our new
Brave Maeve Rainbow Veggie Burger?

285
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,300
Holy Shit!

286
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,810
Here you go, maestro.

287
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,070
- Pretty cool?
- Yeah.

288
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:57,070
Hey, wait until you try
the Big Homey with bacon.

289
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,280
It's so good. And...
And the Mocha Noir Shake?

290
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:04,250
It's amazing.
It won't be lumpy like your mom's.

291
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,250
- Homelander?
- Hey.

292
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:10,420
- Can I get a selfie?
- Ask the boss.

293
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,210
Kidding. Of course you can.

294
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,220
Stormfront, I love you.
Can I get a selfie?

295
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,300
Sure. One at a time.

296
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,800
- Homelander! I'm a huge fan.
- Kids first.

297
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,310
Can I get a picture?

298
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,140
- All right.
- Homelander!

299
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,270
Hey.

300
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,360
Hey. You okay?

301
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,780
I want my mom.

302
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,830
Okay, I got you. I got you.

303
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:49,210
Thank you, everyone. Excuse me.
Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me.

304
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:52,170
Stay back, please.
Please, please, please. Just stay back.

305
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,000
Stay back. Thank you.

306
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,590
New bling?

307
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,260
Donna got it for me.

308
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,310
I'm pretty sure she got it at Duane Reade.

309
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:14,270
Gosh, moms.
The gift that keeps on giving. Forever.

310
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,400
Shit. I'm sorry.

311
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,950
No, it's fine.

312
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,830
No. No. I'm an asshole for bitching
about my mom when yours is...

313
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,040
My mom's not dead.

314
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,080
She's not? It's just
you never mentioned her, so...

315
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,250
She left when I was six.

316
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,840
Wow, shit.

317
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,550
I'm really sorry.

318
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,430
That's where Billy Joel comes from.

319
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,930
She and I, we used to have
these dance parties.

320
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,430
She was fun.

321
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,110
She made awesome
Seven costumes for Halloween.

322
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,570
And then one day,
she just left and never called again.

323
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,860
Not even a card.

324
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,200
You know, it was like some
silent alarm went off and she was, like,

325
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,120
"Well, fuck them, time to go."

326
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,120
No, I'm sure that that's not it.

327
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,630
What would you call it?

328
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,760
I guess that's why I always
just kind of hang in there,

329
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,380
no matter how bad it gets.

330
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,010
'Cause I don't want to be like her.

331
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,600
That's kind of clingy and pathetic,
isn't it?

332
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,900
No. No. It isn't.

333
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,980
At all.

334
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,650
What's up, shitbirds?

335
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,000
What the fuck? What the fuck?

336
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,170
- How did you find us?
- Please.

337
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,130
I can cover the boroughs in three hours.
I went looking, that's all.

338
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:00,210
- I'm surprised your heart can take it.
- My heart is just fine.

339
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,840
- Take a step closer and I'll show you.
- Hey, I saved your life, asshole.

340
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,340
Now you're coming after us?

341
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,270
We're even now, bitch.

342
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,860
Holy Shit!

343
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,400
Is this true?

344
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,490
Everything makes more sense now,
doesn't it?

345
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:26,240
- Where did you get this?
- I didn't get it, okay? I was never here.

346
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,910
You got that shit on your own. Yeah?

347
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,700
But why are you doing this?

348
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,540
'Cause I want back in, so I need her gone.

349
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,750
Fuck that Nazi bitch.

350
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,450
Would you ask Mario if he could whip up
some of those Gruyère puffs?

351
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,570
Would you like an order?
They're worth the cheat day.

352
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,080
I assume you got a man out there,
with a clean shot?

353
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,580
More than one.

354
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,210
Then I'll skip the fucking hors d'oeuvres,
if you don't mind,

355
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,000
and we'll just cut straight to it, yeah?

356
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,960
You mentioned on the phone
that you could help with Homelander's son.

357
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,260
I must say, I'm not sure what you mean.

358
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,550
That boy is your only possible
contingency against Homelander.

359
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,980
Now, that contingency don't work
if they're off playing Ward and the Beav.

360
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
I can fix that.

361
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,730
Thank you, Alvin.

362
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,820
Homelander's a friend.
Why would I betray him?

363
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,530
Because you're a ruthless bastard.

364
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,500
That's hurtful.

365
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,040
You turned a racist piece of shite
into America's sweetheart.

366
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,920
Now, what word would you use?

367
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,220
Stormfront's good at making people angry.

368
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:19,480
Angry people want Compound V.
Compound V raises our stock price.

369
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:24,820
I'd have preferred V remained a secret,
but we play with the cards we're dealt.

370
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,320
It's not ruthless, it's prices per share.
That's all.

371
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,030
Maybe you should
take a look in the mirror, mate.

372
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,080
'Cause that bitch should bother you.

373
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,040
Of course she does, but it's not about me.

374
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,500
I can't lash out
like some raging, entitled maniac.

375
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,340
That's a white man's luxury.

376
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,260
So it's just business then?

377
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:58,600
When, Mr. Butcher, in history
has it ever been about anything different?

378
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,360
And what makes you think
that you can control that racist bitch?

379
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,030
Look, I've got to get across town...

380
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,900
I can get the boy away from Homelander,
all right?

381
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,990
How?

382
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,410
That's my business.

383
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,870
When I got him, I'll call your people,

384
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,540
they zero in on this cell signal,
and come and scoop him up.

385
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,380
And then you do a better fucking job
hiding him this time, yeah?

386
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,510
You have my word.

387
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,390
I will get Rebecca and Ryan
somewhere safe.

388
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,810
No. Not Becca. Becca stays with me.

389
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:42,140
But that's the whole point,
that he's raised by his mother.

390
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,310
Find him a new fucking mum.
I'm taking my wife back.

391
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,690
That's the deal.

392
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,980
And what happens when Rebecca
shows up at my doorstep,

393
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,820
begging to be reunited with her boy?

394
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,740
You say it's the only way
you can guarantee

395
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,330
Ryan's protection from Homelander.

396
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,290
'Cause as you know,

397
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:09,380
a mother will do anything
to protect her son.

398
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,880
And you call me a ruthless bastard.

399
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,680
You tell me where he is...

400
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,260
and I'll do the rest.

401
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,530
- Where's Ryan?
- He's inside.

402
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,620
- He doesn't want to talk.
- So go in, anyway.

403
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,040
No, no, no. I've tried.
He wants to be left alone.

404
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,500
You are the strongest man in the world,
and you're scared of a little boy.

405
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,380
He's your blood.

406
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,300
Just talk to him.

407
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,550
Be the man I know you are.

408
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:01,930
New York. North Carolina.
North Dakota.

409
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,730
Ohio. Oklahoma. Oregon.

410
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,400
I'm sorry.

411
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,400
No, no, no. Buddy, don't you be sorry.
I should've known better.

412
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,830
There were just so many people.

413
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,290
Yeah, there was.

414
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,760
You know, I remember
the first time I was in a crowd.

415
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,350
Probably didn't bother you.

416
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,180
I was terrified.

417
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:48,980
All these people staring at me
and reaching out, trying to grab me,

418
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,730
and egging me on to use my powers.

419
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,980
I just... I felt like I was drowning.

420
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,690
Well, what did you do?

421
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,910
Well, I took off.

422
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,330
I flew away.

423
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:08,540
They found me 80 miles down the I-9,
crying my little eyes out.

424
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,210
You cry?

425
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,090
Yes.

426
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:27,140
But I'm a man, so not in a long while.

427
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,270
But who knows? Maybe...

428
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,770
maybe next time, you'll fly away.

429
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,610
Maybe with me?

430
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:45,280
Look, I know you want me to be like you,

431
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,950
but, Dad, I'm not.

432
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,960
Son...

433
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,710
I didn't just wake up one day
and fly out the door.

434
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,590
That's not how it works. I had to learn.

435
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,970
Only I didn't have anyone to teach me
'cause the doctors that, um...

436
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,850
The people that raised me,
were scared of me,

437
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,440
so they kept their distance.

438
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,110
And I had to figure it all out
by myself, see?

439
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,860
Well, you don't have to
go through any of that.

440
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,860
I'll teach you.

441
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,740
Really?

442
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,870
I love you.

443
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,020
Hey, did you find anything?

444
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,190
They got him in a cabin up in Rochester.

445
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,730
- What?
- I mean...

446
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,320
Becca. She's great.

447
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,780
We talked earlier, and she's really great.
You're really... You're great.

448
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,110
Easy, tiger.

449
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,030
How'd you get on?
I guess you got fuck all?

450
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:09,240
No witnesses.
But we definitely found fuck all.

451
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,950
I'm not sure
I'm using that term properly, but...

452
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,910
Here.

453
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,080
Fuck me.

454
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,960
This is a jackpot.

455
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,760
Well done, you two.

456
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,880
This'll do nicely.

457
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,510
All right, listen up, you lot.

458
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,310
Getting the kid back ain't your fight.
I ain't gonna ask you to come along.

459
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:33,850
Lick my big Black balls, Butcher.
Sorry, Becca.

460
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:39,060
You done asked us to lie, spy,
do all kinds of fucked up shit for you.

461
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,530
Now we finally get a chance
to do something good,

462
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,360
and you think we'll take a pass on that?

463
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,490
We're in.

464
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,530
Of course we're in.

465
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,490
All right.

466
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,540
Let's get a shift on.

467
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:26,280
What?
You remember the range at Fort Bragg?

468
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,610
I was a better shot than you.

469
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,870
Well, you had a bloody good teacher,
didn't you?

470
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,500
I like your friends. Especially Hughie.

471
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,210
He's... He's good for you.

472
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,790
Look, Becca, you ain't coming with us.

473
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,960
No, bullshit. Ryan doesn't know you,
he'll never come to you.

474
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,090
It's too dangerous,
I ain't gonna lose you again.

475
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,010
He's my son and I'm coming.

476
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,440
I need you to promise me something.

477
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,320
I need you to promise me
that you will save him no matter what

478
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,860
and you will get him back to me.

479
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,490
- Yeah. Of course.
- You realise this isn't just about me.

480
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,740
He can't grow up like Homelander.

481
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:19,040
You have to think of all of the people
out there that he would...

482
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,170
Swear to me, then.

483
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,920
Swear to me on your brother's soul.

484
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,810
I swear to you.

485
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,970
I swear to you on Lenny's soul.

486
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,770
- Okay. Okay.
- All right.

487
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,350
I can use your help loading the car.

488
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,070
What if it happens again?

489
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,450
When I see Stormfront...

490
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:32,450
Stormfront...

491
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,120
...what if I freeze?

492
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,160
"Freeze," yes?

493
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,580
Sorry, I'm still learning.

494
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,670
Look...

495
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,670
If there's one thing I know,

496
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,130
it's that you can take care of yourself.

497
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,760
So when the time comes...

498
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,310
you'll know what to do.

499
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,350
Let's go.

500
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,860
Keep going. You got it.

501
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,160
That's it, don't give up.

502
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,740
That's it, that's it. Keep going.

503
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,200
Little more, little more, you got it.

504
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,000
Hey, that's okay.
You'll get it, you'll get it.

505
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,090
Um...

506
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:35,510
I know what. Imagine...

507
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,100
Well, sometimes, it helps
to imagine someone you hate. Okay?

508
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,850
So try that.

509
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:47,440
But at home, when I say "hate,"
I have to put a quarter in the swear jar.

510
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,940
Well, there's no swear jar here,
so you can hate away.

511
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,650
But I don't really hate anyone.

512
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:58,030
Well, that is very sweet, Ryan.

513
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:01,120
But it's not something we can afford.

514
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,950
We're under attack.

515
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,040
We are?

516
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,210
Bad guys want to hurt us
just because of what we look like.

517
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,380
They want to wipe us from this Earth
just because of the color of our skin.

518
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:16,970
Really?

519
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,800
It's called White Genocide.

520
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:24,470
We're gonna need people like you
to protect our kind.

521
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,440
All right. So let's try again.

522
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,900
Go for it. Imagine...

523
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,650
You gotta be fucking kidding me!

524
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,480
What?

525
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,110
What?

526
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,040
Are you sure this'll work?

527
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,500
Don't worry, it will work.

528
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,960
This is nothing compared
to the raves I used to set up in Algiers.

529
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,800
Do you dance?

530
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,090
Of course I dance.

531
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,970
What is the point of life without dancing?

532
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,100
She's on the move.

533
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,650
I see her, Frenchie.
We gotta go now. You close?

534
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:13,650
One moment, mon ami.

535
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:17,030
- Holy shit. It just broke.
- News from Vought Tower,

536
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:21,030
concerning Stormfront
and alleged Nazi ties.

537
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,620
Stormfront may be 100 years old.

538
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,370
What's even more incredible,

539
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:30,080
we have authenticated photos
showing Stormfront with Nazi High Command,

540
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,460
including Goebbels and Göring.

541
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:37,340
Based on the photos, it is now believed
that she was the wife of Frederick Vought,

542
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,470
who was, of course,
the founder of Vought International.

543
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:44,510
Already, an intense international outcry
has emerged under...

544
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,560
I can't believe I actually
have to say this, this day and age,

545
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,100
but Nazis are bad.

546
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,730
It's catchy.

547
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,990
- You ready?
- Oui.

548
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,050
But the question now is,

549
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:21,260
how can we possibly
let Vought release Compound V

550
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:24,300
in light of this
unprecedented malfeasance?

551
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,390
- What's malfeasance?
- A Nazi in Seven Tower?

552
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,560
- Was she part of the attack?
- It's a... Never mind.

553
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,770
[{high-pitched buzzing]

554
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,600
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

555
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:34,730
Stay here.

556
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:41,780
Now!

557
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,460
Ryan! Hey!

558
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,130
Hey. Hey.

559
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,880
Hey, bud. Hey.

560
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,050
- Mom?
- It's me.

561
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,350
- Mom, Mom, Mom!
- Come here.

562
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,470
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean anything I said.

563
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,100
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean any of it.
- It's okay.

564
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,940
- Got to go.
- I love you so much.

565
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,190
You're okay.
We're gonna go, okay? Come on.

566
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,360
Who's that?

567
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,900
That's my husband.

568
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,110
It's all right. Come on.

569
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,530
I got you.

570
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,160
Come on, to the car. This way.

571
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,930
What the fuck?

572
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,350
What the hell are they doing back?

573
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:59,150
Butcher, this wasn't the plan.

574
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,070
What's going on?

575
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,150
What's wrong?

576
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,320
Take my car.

577
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,280
Get them both to Mallory.
Get them both safe.

578
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,990
- No, no, that's not part of the plan.
- The plan just changed.

579
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,080
M.M., you're the only one
I trust with her.

580
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,120
Hey. What's happening? No.

581
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,540
M.M.'s gonna take you
to a woman with the CIA.

582
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,250
What? No, you have to come with us.

583
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,670
I cut a deal with Stan Edgar.

584
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,260
What?

585
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:27,590
I cut a deal that when I got Ryan,
that I would call Vought.

586
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,140
They were gonna come and take him away,
and you'd never fucking see him again.

587
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,810
What?

588
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,650
But, fuck me, I couldn't do it.

589
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,990
Bedroom's clear.

590
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,150
- Kitchen's clear.
- All rooms secure.

591
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,070
Butcher? You here?

592
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,340
Did I hear you say "Butcher"?

593
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,220
- What's going on?
- Do you have the boy?

594
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,570
Where is my son?

595
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,370
Where is my son?!

596
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,830
I'm not leaving here without you,
I don't care.

597
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,500
I was gonna sell you out.

598
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,580
I fucking well might do it again.

599
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,960
You didn't, though.
You didn't and you won't.

600
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,500
You can't have a cunt like me
around that kid.

601
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,300
I don't wanna pass my shit on to him.

602
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,380
Don't say that. You have to come with us.

603
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,760
You raise him right.

604
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,180
Raise him right,
and I'll make sure they never find you.

605
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,020
Don't you say that! Stop it.
Stop, you have to come with us.

606
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,640
Becca, we are out of time.

607
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,020
Please...

608
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,310
you gotta let me do this.

609
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:07,360
You got to let me
do this one fucking thing.

610
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,010
Becca!

611
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,770
There you are, you slippery little bitch.

612
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:25,690
I'm assuming it's you
who sent all those lies to the press.

613
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:26,980
They're not lies.

614
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,400
The pictures are clearly deepfakes,
and you're a lying slut.

615
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,910
Here we go, yeah?

616
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,500
People love what I have to say.

617
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,040
They believe in it.

618
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:49,920
They just don't like the word "Nazi,"
that's all.

619
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,920
Are you all right?

620
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,880
- You all right? Yeah?
- Ryan. Ryan, Ryan.

621
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,550
Ryan! Ryan!

622
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,220
Ryan? Come here.

623
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,310
Are you okay?

624
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,270
Go! We'll hold her off.

625
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,020
You're okay.

626
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,400
What about the truth?

627
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,400
What truth?

628
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,200
What is the truth?

629
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,470
And what are you laughing at?

630
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:45,350
She says the truth is,

631
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:48,640
she's gonna stick her boot
up your Nazi kitty.

632
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,910
- Annie!
- Come on, the RPG!

633
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,710
It's in the car! It's our only chance!

634
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,510

Die, you bitch!

644
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,640
Girls do get it done.

645
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:48,470
Fucking bitch!

646
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:04,610
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

647
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,560
Come here, Ryan.

648
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:38,730
Not on your life.

649
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:45,910
You're not like her, Ryan.
You belong with us.

650
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,910
Stay the fuck away from my son.

651
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:49,160
We love you, Ryan.

652
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:56,330
You fucking bitch.

653
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,500
Stop! Stop it!

654
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,880
Stop, please! Stop it!

655
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,590
Stop, you're hurting her! Just let her go!

656
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,140
Stop, you're hurting her! Just let her go!

657
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,640
Let her go!

658
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:12,640
Stop!

659
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,390
Look at me.

660
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,770
I like to see the light go out.

661
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:17,850
Stop!

662
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,030
I'm sorry.

663
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:11,660
I'm sorry, Mom.

664
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:18,210
No. No.

665
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,290
No. No, no.

666
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:23,880
- Hold on.
- Please.

667
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:25,960
Mom, I'm sorry.

668
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,090
Help us!

669
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:31,510
Somebody help us!

670
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:37,430
It's not his fault.

671
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,520
It's not his fault.

672
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,350
You make sure he knows that.

673
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,020
Yeah?

674
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,280
He's good. He's good.

675
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,650
He's good.

676
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,870
You promise me you keep him safe.

677
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,700
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

678
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:48,130
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

679
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:49,210
Mommy.

680
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:50,840
Mom...

681
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:52,930
Mom, please.

682
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,570
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

683
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:46,350
Ryan?

684
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,440
Did you do this?

685
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:52,440
I didn't mean to.

686
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,820
Let's go.

687
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:05,540
Come here.

688
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,840
Come.

689
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,880
Ryan.

690
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:19,430
Ryan.

691
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,050
Come here.

692
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:32,150
No.

693
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,080
He's mine.

694
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:52,920
What, are you gonna blow yourself up...

695
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:57,630
to save the little shit
who fucking murdered your wife?

696
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,390
I promised.

697
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:07,640
Have it your way.

698
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:08,730
Stop.

699
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:15,190
What are you doing here?

700
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:20,820
You're gonna let them go.

701
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:24,620
And if I don't?

702
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,290
Please!
—Don't die with them.

703
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:31,540
Let them go.

704
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,840
You're gonna stop hunting Starlight.

705
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,010
You're gonna leave me and Elena alone.

706
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:39,260
Take my daughter!

707
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,930
Or I release this.

708
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,890
If you do that...

709
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:50,690
I'll destroy everything and everyone.

710
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:56,030
Great, as long as everyone sees
what a fucking monster you are.

711
00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:01,990
As long as no one ever loves you again.

712
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:12,170
Homelander! Homelander! Homelander!

713
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:16,170
Homelander! Homelander! Homelander!

714
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,670
We believe that Stormfront

715
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,380
was the sole perpetrator
of the attack on Washington.

716
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,760
In the light of Stormfront's atrocities,

717
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:11,480
the release of Compound V
has been placed on indefinite hold.

718
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:13,940
Homelander.

719
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:15,940
Mr. Edgar, a follow-up question.

720
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,440
Are there any more
Compound V terrorists out there?

721
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:23,820
Thanks to the heroism
of Queen Maeve and Starlight,

722
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,120
Stormfront has been neutralized

723
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:29,280
and is being held
in an undisclosed location.

724
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:32,870
I would personally like
to apologize to Starlight,

725
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,750
who was wrongfully accused
of sabotage and conspiracy.

726
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:38,340
Welcome back to the team.

727
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,920
And I know that you and Maeve
are two of the best,

728
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:45,130
most loyal friends that I could ever have.

729
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:48,760
We are your heroes.

730
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:51,350
We are here to serve and protect you.

731
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:55,480
Stormfront's violation
of that special relationship,

732
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:59,270
of that trust, is unacceptable.

733
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:01,530
And she will be punished.

734
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,650
Justice will be served...

735
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:17,670
Justice will be served.
She will be punished.

736
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:23,710
As the leader of The Seven,
I give you my word, no one will ever...

737
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:29,260
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.

738
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,050
Always happy to see you, sir.

739
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,270
I'm afraid we had an incident
at the Archives.

740
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:38,400
Someone broke in
and stole PDR on Stormfront.

741
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,270
PDR?

742
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,940
Private data reserve.

743
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,490
No one saw the thief come or go.

744
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:49,360
Isn't that right... A-Train?

745
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:52,910
That was you? Dude!

746
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,290
I didn't know, sir. Fuck him.
I would never go behind your back.

747
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:58,620
Please, just let me explain.

748
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:00,500
I think it showed initiative.

749
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,340
Stormfront's been critical of the church,

750
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:07,300
and Vought needs to take
a firm anti-Nazi stance right now.

751
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,380
Wait.

752
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,550
Does that mean...?

753
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,350
I just spoke to Stan Edgar.

754
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:12,810
You're back in.

755
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:14,890
- Fuck, yeah!
- What? Yeah!

756
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:17,230
Yeah! A-Train is back, baby!

757
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:18,940
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

758
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,440
All right.

759
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:22,520
- Finally.
- Yeah.

760
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:25,400
I'm back too, right? Right?

761
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,360
I'm anti-Nazi.

762
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,240
I'm sorry, Deep,
but they only had one slot.

763
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,370
One hero is redemption, two is weakness.

764
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:34,280
So they took him?

765
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:36,160
Fuck, yes, they did!

766
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:37,910
Well, Shit!

767
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Peace out, bitch! Ha, ha!

768
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:45,130
You have to be patient, Deep.

769
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:47,550
We'll get you into a few more courses,
up to Level 7.

770
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:49,130
I don't wanna pay for more courses!

771
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,630
Deep, please calm down.

772
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,430
I signed over my bank account to you.

773
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:54,720
I filled out all those
fucking children's workbooks,

774
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:58,270
I married some weirdo
who gives terrible blowjobs.

775
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,520
I did everything you asked,

776
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,520
and when I found out that we're all just
fucking space spores, I didn't laugh.

777
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:06,320
I did everything you asked.

778
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,650
Because you said you'd get me back
in The Seven, you fucking promised.

779
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:13,370
I'm sorry, Deep, but you are acting
like a toxic personality.

780
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:15,030
I think you should leave.

781
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:21,910
Fuck Fresca.

782
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,380
- Look at you.
- I know.

783
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:33,930
I know.

784
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:37,890
But if Billy Butcher
can do the right thing,

785
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:42,140
then there's got to be
some kind of higher power.

786
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:45,690
You know?

787
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:50,190
Are you sure it's safe for you
to go back into the Tower?

788
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,280
No.

789
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,740
No, I'm not...

790
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:59,080
but if you jump ship
and you let the assholes steer...

791
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,040
then you're part of the problem.

792
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
And...

793
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:09,670
someone taught me something
about hanging in there.

794
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:26,940
I've been thinking about that lately,
the hanging in there.

795
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,360
And I think maybe I am too clingy.

796
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,900
No, you're not.

797
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:36,700
Sticking with people
just because I'm terrified of losing them?

798
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:40,540
I... I can't do that anymore.

799
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:47,420
I think it's time I go off,
stand on my own two feet for once.

800
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:52,800
Right. Um...

801
00:57:57,930 --> 00:58:00,180
Yeah, no worries. We'll, um...

802
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:04,600
We'll just be friends, then.

803
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,020
God, no. No, no, no,
I'm still gonna cling onto you.

804
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,560
I'm not fucking crazy.

805
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:34,670
So if you weren't talking about me,
who were you talking about?

806
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,760
I'm scared.

807
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:00,610
This here...

808
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,160
belonged to your mum.

809
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,580
This is St. Christopher.

810
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,370
She gave it to me a long time ago...

811
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:13,880
and told me... it would keep me safe.

812
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:16,340
And it has.

813
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,920
Mostly.

814
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:29,850
Now your mum...

815
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,190
is gonna help keep you safe.

816
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:43,070
Come on.

817
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,880
Now, remember what I told you.

818
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:57,210
Don't be a cunt.

819
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,030
William, I'm so sorry.

820
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,070
Vought's gonna want him back.

821
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,700
Let me handle Vought.

822
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,950
You think he'll turn into his father?

823
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,670
Becca didn't think so.

824
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:38,760
I pray she's right.

825
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:42,880
All the charges against you and the boys
have been dropped,

826
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:44,850
even for the crimes you did commit.

827
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:46,260
You're a free man.

828
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:50,020
And the White House
is opening an Office of Supe Affairs.

829
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,690
Victoria Neuman is the new czar.

830
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:55,810
She's sneaking me
some off-the-books funding

831
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:58,440
for a team that can
keep tabs on the Supes.

832
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:00,780

Congratulations on the appointment,
congresswoman.

853
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,930
It's about time
we had an Office of Supe Affairs.

854
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:57,270
Well, I know it was your intel
that took Stormfront down, so thank you.

855
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:59,520
Yeah, and that's just the start.

856
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:03,320
We have enough dirt to ruin a dozen Supes.

857
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,360
It'd be a death blow for Stan Edgar.

858
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,610
That is, of course,

859
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:12,160
if you're open to, expediting
the church's tax-exempt status.

860
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,620
Small price to pay.

861

-Call my office, set up a meeting?
—You are one of the good ones, Vic.

862
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:20,670
See you soon.

863
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:22,330
See you.

864
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:09,260
- Here's the research you asked for.
- Thank you.

865
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:11,590
- And your 2:00 is waiting.
- Thank you.

866
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,800
Hugh Campbell.

867
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:19,680
I don't know how to repay you
for what you did.

868
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,520
You know, I can think of a way.

869
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,570
You can... give me a job.

870
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:29,030
You serious?

871
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:31,320
What about your team?

872
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,120
Don't get me wrong,
I still want to fight Vought. I just...

873
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:38,450
I want to do it the right way,
not covered in quite as many guts.

874
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:44,040
Look, the truth is,
I never totally fit in with the guys.

875
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,130
And...

876
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,010
I think it's time
I stand on my own two feet.

877
