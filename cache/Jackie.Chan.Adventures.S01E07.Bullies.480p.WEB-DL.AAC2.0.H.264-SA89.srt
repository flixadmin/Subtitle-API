00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,142
Cough up some cash, twerp.

00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:12,644
B-but today's fishsticks.

I need the protein.

Aah!

Can't eat if you
don't got a face.

6

Be afraid.

Hey, maynard.

Let go of him.

10

Beat it, shrimp.

11
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,132
Shrimp?

12
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:34,733
Let it go, Jade.

13
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:37,569
Unh.

14

15

Hey, there's enough here

16
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:44,643
for fishsticks and pie. Aah.

17
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:45,711
Ooh.
Ooh.

18
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,380
That's gotta sting.

19
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,916
My mom always told me
not to hit girls,

20

21

I'll make an exception.

Gulp.

23
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,772
Fair warning, maynard:

24

I am trained in
- the ancient art of butt whup.

-Yeah, right.
-Zip it, drew.

Grr...

Uh...Ms. Hardman,

I can explain.

40
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,675
Perhaps it's time
I had a chat with
your guardian, young lady.

41
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,410
Uh...Uncle Jackie's...

Heh. Enter the dragon...

where is the dragon talisman?

My men are on it, shendu.

59
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:51,797
Your men could not find
their own shadows,

60
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,365
and your incompetence

61
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:56,168
continues to stupefy me.

62
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,871
Oh? I'll stupefy you!

63
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:03,775
Temper, valmont.

64
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:10,115
The arrogance of that
oversized lawn ornament.

65
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,851
Valmont, check it out.

66
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,723
You actually did your job?

67
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:19,925
Imagine.

68
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,226
You're not stoked?

69
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:24,363
I'm absolutely giddy.

70
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,134

00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,802
Whoa.

Puff the magic dragon.

Whoa.
Whoa.

74
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,417
And that's when
valmont's men

75
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,852
escaped with
the talisman.

76
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:48,120
You didn't follow them?

77
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,321
They could've led us
to valmont himself.

78
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:52,324
Ach...I was a little
preoccupied.

79
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:56,561
Captain black, the dark hand
has the dragon talisman.

80
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:59,464
If they discover the magic
it possesses...

81
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:03,135
Uh, I said the "m" word,
didn't I?

82
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,771
Jackie! I missed you
so much.

83
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:07,873
You look like
you had a rough day.

84
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:11,476
Can I get you a cup of tea,
maybe some cookies?

85
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,778
New shoes?

86
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,980
Jade, what did you do?

87
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,748
Jade is in trouble
at school.

88
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,585
Cup of tea sounds good,
thank you. One more thing--

89
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,554
your place is too big.

90
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:26,692
I have to walk very far
to find a bathroom!

91

Uncle, what are you
doing here?

92
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:31,697
Landlord made me
leave the shop for 3 days.

93
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,199
Says it must
be sprayed for bugs.

94
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:38,103
This is how
I spray for bugs.

95
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:41,707
Yes, siree, it's a real
family affair

96
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,275
here at section 13.

97
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:46,511
Jade, what kind
of trouble at school?

98
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:50,315
Ms. hardman
just wants you to come to
a parent-teacher conference.

99
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,384
No biggie. Heh heh.

under siege.

Jade, you are not
a secret agent,

107
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,610
and we have
a previous engagement.

108

It's laundry money.

bye-bye, captain black.

the first time we've had
a problem with Jade.

self-defense.

a secret weapon.

Well, you obviously
don't provide Jade

132
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,781
with enough
discipline, Mr. chan.

that the greatest

that means
watching your temper.

00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,275
Hyah!

171
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,843
Don't hurt me.

172
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:15,280
You're not looking
for revenge?

173
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,448
I want you to teach me

174
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,084
the ancient art
of butt whup.

175
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:21,786
T'ch, so you can
be a better bully?

176
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,887
Dream on, maynard.

177
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,290
The martial arts
are...Uh...About

178
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,359
finding
the strength within

179
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,260
to discipline
oneself.

180
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,428
That-that's me.

181
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,933
I lack discipline,
really.

182
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:44,175
Free your mind
of all thoughts.

183
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,678
Aiyaaa, there is
no privacy here.

184
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,984
I put my bao
in the refrigerator,
and somebody ate it.

185
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,121
Focus only
on your breathing.

186
00:10:56,123 --> 00:11:00,091
Your breathing
is slow...Deep.

187
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,359
One more thing:

188
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:05,263
How is your friend
captain black doing?

189
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:09,000
Grrr...Hyah!

190

[Alarm sounds]

194
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:23,381
A big rig was just
blown to bits

195
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,582
by a well-dressed
gentleman.

196
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:25,784
Where?

197
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:28,153
Route 64, outside
corydon, Indiana.

198
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:32,223
Speeding distance from
fort Knox, Kentucky...

199
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:34,959
And the U.S. gold reserve.

200
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,062
Mobilize.

201
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:38,363
I'm going with you.

202
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,566
Uh, Jackie, you're not
a secret agent.

203
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:45,003
You're an archeologist,
right?

204
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,572
I know that, Jade.

205
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:52,544
I'm just going to
retrieve a talisman.

206
00:11:55,781 --> 00:12:00,051
His anger clouds
his judgment.

207
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,754
I noticed.

[Muffled explosion]

209
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,929
What was that?

210
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,978
This is
a restricted area.

211
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,146
Official business.

212
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,014
I need to speak to
your commanding officer.

213
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,783
And you would be with?

214
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,251
Section 13.

215
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,886
Who?

216
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,590
The grass is always greener

217
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:41,392
on the sunnyside
of the gopher hole.

218
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,147
Was that always there?

219
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,117
I don't know.

220
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,370
Faster, tohru.

[Grunts]

223
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,153
A shame captain black

224
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,088
won't be visiting today.

225
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:48,660
I understand he had
a doctor's appointment.

226
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:52,530
Yeah, doctor's appointment,
I get it.

227
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:56,467
Grr...Aah!

Finally we meet.

Captain black was lucky.

00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,038
But my aim has improved
with practice.

Uh, you want
the other talismans,

don't you, valmont?

Continue.

00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:50,889
I will make you a deal.

Show you where
section 13 is.

doing here?

Making sure you do not
lose your temper

270
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,876
and do something
foolish.

Valmont!

Something is amiss.

gonna take him down?

I was wondering--

288
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,071
what is one of these worth?

289
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:57,175
An all-expenses-paid trip
to Melvin world?

290
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,077
You'll pay for that.

291
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,344
What about these?

292
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:01,779
A new Ferrari?

Chan.

294
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,483
A Summer home? Your own
private island to build it on?

295
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:09,020
A robot Butler for that home?

296
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:14,759
Rraahhhrr...

297
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,233

298
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,371

00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:36,247
A little help.

Uh, boss, visitors.

303
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,661
That was bad, right?

304
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,076
Heh. Take it easy, boss.

305
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:07,345
The doctor says you can
leave in a few days,

306
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,513
if you rest.

307
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:10,515
Sir, good to see you
up and at 'em.

recovered the bullion
from the river bottom.

309
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,652
Valmont?

310
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,054
Which means
that dark hand

311
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:19,757
still possesses
the magic talisman.

312

Jackie,
the "m" word.

313
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:23,227
But you saw it.

The dragon power
injured you.

your forgiveness.

You may earn it, valmont.

at the north pole.

322

324
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:52,723
Free your mind
of all thoughts.

325
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,725
Focus only
on your breathing.

Gimme the basketball,
chump.

double-dribble breath.

that the greatest victory
is the battle not fought?

I make
such a good Jackie.

Jade: Hey, Jackie, what did
you wanna be
when you were young?

332
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:25,022
When I was kid?

333
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:28,192
When I was kid,
I wanted to a rich man.

334
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:30,494
And then I wanted
to be a hero.

335
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,129
Fireman. Policeman.

336
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:34,498
Sometimes I wanted
to be a president.

All kinds of things

I know in the real life
I cannot be.

339
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:41,906
So that's why now I really
like to be a movie star.

340
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:46,744
Why? Because I can do
whatever I like to do
in the movie...

341
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,246
Just by being myself.

342
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:49,647
Yes.
