it was okay to come back here.

649
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,971
I didn't mean to disturb you.

650
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,884
No, no. It's okay. Something wrong?

651
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,168
No. I was in the area.

652
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,409
And, uh, my sorceress
wants her doll back.

653
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,449
Right. Yeah.

654
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,043
Is that why you're here?

655
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,570
Yes.

656
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,166
No.

657
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,971
She does want her doll back...

658
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,407
but not entirely. No.

659
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,681
You live here?

660
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,203
I'm sort of between places right now.

661
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,527
I don't know why I'm here.

662
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,011
Sorry.

663
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,889
A whim.

664
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,527
Wait.

665
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,323
MAN:
Hey, Gordon, did you hear?

666
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,683
There's been a big shootout
at Fish Mooney's place.

667
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,522
