00:00:16,603 --> 00:00:18,403
His heart rate is dropping fast.
Where are we?

6
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:19,773
We are finishing a sequence now.

7
00:00:19,857 --> 00:00:21,400

Princess, you should go be by his side.

15
00:00:40,836 --> 00:00:43,255
I have to think.
Everyone, get out.

16
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:45,674
Get out!

17
00:00:51,889 --> 00:00:53,056

18
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,558
29.1%.

19

00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:42,064
Your brother

It is an honor for me...

00:06:37,192 --> 00:06:39,861
to invite her majesty, Queen Ramonda,

42
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:41,363
daughter of Lumumba,

43
00:06:41,446 --> 00:06:43,406
sovereign ruler
of the kingdom of Wakanda.

44
00:06:56,962 --> 00:06:58,588
US Secretary of State:
Mr. Chairperson,

45
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:04,177
I believe I speak for
all the member states here

46
00:07:04,261 --> 00:07:07,055
when I say that
I am deeply disappointed

47
00:07:07,138 --> 00:07:09,224
in Wakanda's failure

48
00:07:09,307 --> 00:07:13,770
to stand by promises to
participate in global efforts

49
00:07:13,853 --> 00:07:15,939
to tackle international challenges,

50
00:07:16,022 --> 00:07:17,524
to share resources,

51
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:19,818
and full cooperation

52
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:21,361
concerning vibranium.

53
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:40,672
I now give the floor

54
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:42,674
to Her Majesty, Queen Ramonda.

55
00:07:49,848 --> 00:07:52,642
It has always been our policy

56
00:07:52,726 --> 00:07:57,731
to never trade vibranium
under any circumstance.

57
00:07:57,814 --> 00:08:02,110
Not because of the dangerous
potential of vibranium,

58
00:08:02,986 --> 00:08:07,782
but because of the dangerous
potential of you.

59
00:08:48,198 --> 00:08:52,077
You perform civility here.

60
00:08:53,078 --> 00:08:55,163
But we know what you whisper

61
00:08:55,789 --> 00:08:57,540
in your halls of leadership

62
00:08:57,624 --> 00:09:00,502
and in your military facilities.

63
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:07,634
"The King is dead."

64
00:09:09,427 --> 00:09:12,389
"The Black Panther is gone."

65
00:09:14,349 --> 00:09:17,560
"They have lost their protector."

66
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:26,695
"Now is our time..."

67
00:09:28,196 --> 00:09:29,322
"To strike."

68
00:09:56,516 --> 00:09:58,393
Aneka, where is your spear?

69
00:09:58,476 --> 00:09:59,978
SHURI gave me these to try.

70
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:04,607
You know, I like them better.

71
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:06,371
Our foremothers gave us the spear...

72
00:10:06,443 --> 00:10:09,112
because it is precise, elegant...

73
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,823
and deadly.

74
00:10:14,784 --> 00:10:17,120
It will not change under my watch.

75
00:10:19,038 --> 00:10:20,498
Yes, General.

76
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,917
I told you not to bring them.

77
00:10:25,754 --> 00:10:27,922
Last night there was another attack

78
00:10:28,006 --> 00:10:30,508
on one of our outreach facilities.

79
00:10:31,426 --> 00:10:35,263
Proof of the involvement
of a member state

80
00:10:35,346 --> 00:10:39,350
is being uploaded to your
mobile devices as we speak.

81
00:10:40,643 --> 00:10:43,354
And as for the identity
of the attackers...

82
00:11:03,124 --> 00:11:06,586
Let our gracious
response to this incursion

83
00:11:07,587 --> 00:11:09,088
be an olive branch.

84
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,052
Further attempts on our resources

85
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:17,430
will be considered an act of aggression

86
00:11:17,514 --> 00:11:21,142
and met with a much steeper response.

87
00:11:22,977 --> 00:11:25,313
We mourn the loss of our king.

88
00:11:26,314 --> 00:11:28,733
But do not think for a second

89
00:11:28,817 --> 00:11:31,110
that Wakanda has lost her ability

90
00:11:31,194 --> 00:11:33,738
to protect our resources.

91
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:38,034
We are aware
of the ongoing efforts by some

92
00:11:38,117 --> 00:11:41,287
to find vibranium outside of Wakanda,

93
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:45,625
and wish you the best of luck.

94
00:11:50,171 --> 00:11:52,507

00:11:59,264 --> 00:12:00,265

Hey!

99
00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:05,979
I thought you retired!

100
00:12:06,062 --> 00:12:07,188
I thought I had too.

101
00:12:07,272 --> 00:12:09,482
They said that machine
had a one in a billion chance

102
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:10,733
of finding vibranium.

103
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:11,901
Oh, less than that.

104
00:12:33,715 --> 00:12:34,883
Here we go.

105

<i>We've touched down.</i>

00:13:13,171 --> 00:13:14,797
you are near the site right there.

114
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:18,176
<i>Yeah, it's astonishing.</i>

115
00:13:20,178 --> 00:13:21,512
<i>The drill seemed to make contact</i>

116

<i>I've never seen a drill bit

119
00:13:32,065 --> 00:13:33,274
I'll be.

120
00:13:33,942 --> 00:13:35,485
vibranium in the ocean.

121
00:13:35,568 --> 00:13:37,528
Let's go ahead and get
the detector out of there,

122
00:13:37,612 --> 00:13:39,364

131
00:14:36,504 --> 00:14:38,631

<i>No. He's gone.</i>

Can you clarify?
What do you mean by, "He's gone"?

139
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:05,908
Salazar, do you copy?

140
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:08,786

Hey, Smitty, earplugs.

148

We are under attack.

149
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:14,685
You need to send in
a strike team immediately.

150
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:17,897
Copy. Mayday, mayday,
this is Rotor 625.

We are requesting
assistance immediately.

Henderson!

157
00:16:45,174 --> 00:16:46,634
Let's go.

158
00:16:48,845 --> 00:16:49,846
What's going on?

159
00:16:50,513 --> 00:16:51,639
Get off the edge.

160
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:31,345
Go, go, go, 90!

161
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:39,562
Now!
Go!

162
00:17:39,645 --> 00:17:41,689
Spin!
Spin them off!

163
00:17:42,565 --> 00:17:44,192
Okay.
They're gone!

164
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:46,402
Oh, my God!

165
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:06,047
Just get us out.

166
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,590
We're good.

167
00:18:07,673 --> 00:18:09,008
We're good.

168
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:10,218
Where is the strike team?

169
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:12,595
It wasn't the Wakandans.
They... They were blue.

170
00:18:12,678 --> 00:18:13,763
Everyone is dead...

171
00:18:16,015 --> 00:18:17,391
Shit.
What is going on?

172
00:18:17,475 --> 00:18:19,310
We're getting pulled backwards.

173
00:18:20,436 --> 00:18:21,896
Oh, my God.

174
00:18:26,525 --> 00:18:28,819
Oh, God! Hang on!

175
00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:05,749
<i>Queen Ramonda
of the nation of Wakanda</i>

176
00:19:05,773 --> 00:19:07,900
<i>gave an electrifying speech
at the UN yesterday,</i>

177
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:09,443
<i>while members of her military</i>

178
00:19:09,527 --> 00:19:11,195
<i>escorted captive mercenaries</i>

179
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:12,738
<i>onto the floor of the UN.</i>

180
00:19:12,822 --> 00:19:14,657
<i>A year has passed
since Queen Ramonda</i>

181
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,784
<i>was reinstated as ruler of Wakanda</i>

182
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:18,369
<i>after King T'Challa's sudden death</i>

183
00:19:18,452 --> 00:19:20,413
<i>from an undisclosed illness last year.</i>

184
00:19:20,496 --> 00:19:22,748
<i>All eyes are on the tiny,
powerful nation,</i>

185
00:19:22,832 --> 00:19:25,418
<i>as it finds itself
increasingly isolated...</i>

186
00:19:27,837 --> 00:19:29,672
Approaching the river border.

187
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:37,680
We are home.

188
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:28,939
<i>Princess.</i>

189
00:20:29,023 --> 00:20:30,066
Just a moment.

190
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:31,484
I'm in the middle of something.

191
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:33,194
<i>I understand, Princess, however...</i>

192
00:20:33,277 --> 00:20:34,987
You're disrupting my train of thought.

193
00:20:38,407 --> 00:20:39,408
SHURI.

194
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:40,951
Mother.

195
00:20:41,035 --> 00:20:42,179
<i>I was trying to tell you.</i>

196
00:20:42,203 --> 00:20:44,205
<i>The Queen is here.</i>

197
00:20:44,288 --> 00:20:46,415
- Thank you.
- That thing unnerves me.

198
00:20:46,499 --> 00:20:47,750
I think that one day

199
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,127
artificial intelligence
is going to kill us all.

200
00:20:50,211 --> 00:20:53,047
My Al isn't like the movies, Mother.

201
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,840
It does exactly what I tell it to do.

202
00:20:54,924 --> 00:20:57,510
Yeah, if only children were the same.

203
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:01,430
Everyone seems to be working diligently.

204
00:21:02,098 --> 00:21:05,643
Yes.
Rapid emergency response task.

205
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,436
There could be any number of

206
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,188
unknown threats on the horizon,

207
00:21:09,271 --> 00:21:10,940
and they're creating solutions.

208
00:21:11,941 --> 00:21:13,984
Oh, what is this?

209
00:21:14,068 --> 00:21:15,778
Exo Suits for our army.

210
00:21:15,861 --> 00:21:18,364
It grants the user
super-human strength,

211
00:21:18,447 --> 00:21:20,616
speed, and durability.

212
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:23,119
But, as always, OKOYE had notes.

213
00:21:23,202 --> 00:21:24,453
What were her notes?

214
00:21:24,537 --> 00:21:25,913
She hates them.

215
00:21:25,996 --> 00:21:26,997
Oh.

216
00:21:31,335 --> 00:21:33,629
What about recreating
the Heart-Shaped Herb?

217
00:21:33,712 --> 00:21:35,923
Have you made any progress on that?

218
00:21:36,006 --> 00:21:37,216
<i>Excuse me, Princess.</i>

219
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:40,511
<i>Nakia, daughter of Yaa,
is trying to reach you again.</i>

220
00:21:40,594 --> 00:21:41,595
<i>Maybe you should...</i>

221
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,431
Maybe you should
continue your calculations

222
00:21:43,514 --> 00:21:44,682
as I instructed.

223
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:46,267
<i>As you wish, Princess.</i>

224
00:21:47,768 --> 00:21:49,311
We do not need the Herb, Mother.

225
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:52,356
We need new technology.

226
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,691
What of the Black Panther?

227
00:21:56,902 --> 00:22:00,573
The mantle has unified
our nation for centuries.

228
00:22:00,656 --> 00:22:02,825
The Black Panther is a relic, Mother.

229
00:22:02,908 --> 00:22:05,411
I wasn't trying to save
the mantle with the Herb,

230
00:22:05,494 --> 00:22:07,663
I was trying to save my brother.

231
00:22:10,124 --> 00:22:11,125
Oh, SHURI.

232
00:22:24,847 --> 00:22:26,640
Do you know what day it is?

233
00:22:26,724 --> 00:22:27,725
Tuesday.

234
00:22:29,018 --> 00:22:30,519
The date, child.

235
00:22:36,775 --> 00:22:38,027
Brother's passing.

236
00:22:38,694 --> 00:22:39,987
One year ago today.

237
00:22:50,122 --> 00:22:51,207
Have you planned anything?

238
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:55,211
Yes. It involves you taking
your mother for a drive.

239
00:22:55,794 --> 00:22:57,213
- Right now?
- Right now.

240
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,507
And you can leave
your Kimoyo Beads here.

241
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,716
- Mother.
- No, no.

242
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,635
You won't need them where we are going.

243
00:23:04,345 --> 00:23:05,387
Hmm?

244
00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:10,351
And the other two.
Yes.

245
00:23:34,124 --> 00:23:37,962
You need to sit here with me.
And with yourself.

246
00:23:38,045 --> 00:23:40,631
It is the only way
you are going to heal

247
00:23:40,714 --> 00:23:43,050
from the wound caused
by T'Challa's death.

248
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:44,426
I'm fine, Mother.

249
00:23:45,844 --> 00:23:47,805
You don't have to worry about me.

250
00:23:49,056 --> 00:23:52,685
He's gone,
but I'm moving forward.

251
00:23:52,768 --> 00:23:54,603
T'Challa is dead,

252
00:23:54,687 --> 00:23:57,565
but that doesn't mean he is gone.

253
00:23:58,065 --> 00:24:00,943
When that illness
took your brother from us,

254
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:05,614
I had to lead a wounded nation
and a broken world.

255
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:08,492
But I still took time in the bush.

256
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:11,912
I wandered until I found water.

257
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,455
And I sat.

258
00:24:15,082 --> 00:24:16,750
Then I did this ritual

259
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:19,295
that I am about to show you now.

260
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,093
I found your brother in the breeze,

261
00:24:27,386 --> 00:24:30,764
pushing me gently, but firm.

262
00:24:31,765 --> 00:24:33,934
Like his hand on my shoulder.

263
00:24:36,437 --> 00:24:37,771
It took some time,

264
00:24:39,148 --> 00:24:41,108
but he was there.

265
00:24:47,323 --> 00:24:48,741
He wasn't there, Mother.

266
00:24:50,534 --> 00:24:51,994
The presence that you felt

267
00:24:52,077 --> 00:24:53,996
was just a construct of your mind.

268
00:24:56,206 --> 00:24:59,960
Brought on so you could feel
some comfort or joy.

269
00:25:00,502 --> 00:25:02,087
That's all.

270
00:25:03,672 --> 00:25:04,840
Hmm.

271
00:25:08,969 --> 00:25:11,847
What construct does your mind create

272
00:25:12,014 --> 00:25:13,974
when you think of your brother?

273
00:25:14,933 --> 00:25:16,894
Does it offer you comfort?

274
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,647
Or torment?

275
00:25:33,327 --> 00:25:34,411
Come, child.

276
00:25:46,173 --> 00:25:47,174
How did you get this?

277
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:48,467
What does it matter?

278
00:25:49,301 --> 00:25:51,095
What does this have to do
with your ritual?

279
00:25:52,262 --> 00:25:54,598
Burning of the funeral garments

280
00:25:54,765 --> 00:25:57,017
marks the end of the mourning period

281
00:25:57,184 --> 00:26:00,104
and the beginning of a new relationship

282
00:26:00,187 --> 00:26:02,439
with our loved ones
that have passed on...

283
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,525
I'm not doing this, Mother.

284
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:07,236
If I sit

285
00:26:07,403 --> 00:26:09,947
and think about my brother for too long,

286
00:26:11,448 --> 00:26:14,243
it won't be these clothes I'll burn.

287
00:26:15,494 --> 00:26:17,037
It will be the world...

288
00:26:18,455 --> 00:26:19,998
and everyone in it.

289
00:26:20,332 --> 00:26:22,334
SHURI...

290
00:26:26,797 --> 00:26:29,717
SHURI, there's something
that I need to tell you

291
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,510
about your brother.

292
00:26:36,056 --> 00:26:37,057
Mother, wait!

293
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:39,601
What are you doing?

294
00:27:04,376 --> 00:27:06,295
This better not be
a part of your ritual.

295
00:27:06,378 --> 00:27:07,713
It isn't.

296
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:11,008
Stop! Right there!

297
00:27:11,675 --> 00:27:14,511
Who are you?
And how did you get in here?

298
00:27:16,054 --> 00:27:17,556
This place is amazing.

299
00:27:18,474 --> 00:27:20,559
The air is pristine.

300
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:23,020
And the water...

301
00:27:24,563 --> 00:27:26,690
My mother told stories
about a place like this.

302
00:27:27,024 --> 00:27:30,194
A protected land with people
that never have to leave.

303
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,696
That never have to change
who they were.

304
00:27:34,281 --> 00:27:35,365
What reason do you have

305
00:27:35,449 --> 00:27:37,242
to reveal your secret to the world?

306
00:27:37,326 --> 00:27:40,287
I am not a woman
who enjoys repeating herself.

307
00:27:40,454 --> 00:27:42,331
Who are you?

308
00:27:42,498 --> 00:27:43,707
I have many names.

309
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:47,419
My people call me K'uk'ulkan...

310
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:52,049
but my enemies call me Namor.

311
00:27:53,842 --> 00:27:56,386
The American military detected vibranium

312
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,055
under my nation's domain.

313
00:27:59,056 --> 00:28:02,601
I was able to stop them from minin' it,

314
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,812
but we need Wakanda's help

315
00:28:04,895 --> 00:28:06,647
to prevent it from happenin' again.

316
00:28:07,773 --> 00:28:10,734
They use a machine designed
by an American scientist.

317
00:28:10,901 --> 00:28:13,403
vibranium only exists here.

318
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,905
In Wakanda.

319
00:28:15,072 --> 00:28:16,448
Mother, he's covered in it.

320
00:28:20,327 --> 00:28:24,081
Your son exposed the power
of vibranium to the world.

321
00:28:24,623 --> 00:28:26,959
In response,
other nations have begun

322
00:28:27,042 --> 00:28:28,460
searching the planet for it.

323
00:28:28,627 --> 00:28:32,047
His choice has compromised us.

324
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,217
I think Wakanda
could find the scientist

325
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,593
and bring them to me?

326
00:28:37,344 --> 00:28:41,348
It is only fair that Wakanda
helps to resolve our dilemma.

327
00:28:41,515 --> 00:28:43,976
You do not sneak into my country

328
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:46,770
and tell me what is fair.

329
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:51,316
I have more soldiers than
this land has blades of grass.

330
00:28:52,109 --> 00:28:54,820
And they have incomparable strength.

331
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,448
I would hate to come back
under different circumstances.

332
00:29:04,454 --> 00:29:06,915
When you have the scientist,
blow into this,

333
00:29:07,082 --> 00:29:08,417
place it in the ocean.

334
00:29:08,876 --> 00:29:10,878
I'll be there shortly afterwards.

335
00:29:14,423 --> 00:29:15,632
For your own sake,

336
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:18,051
don't mention anything about me

337
00:29:18,135 --> 00:29:19,928
to anyone outside of Wakanda.

338
00:29:28,645 --> 00:29:30,564
Did you see the wings on his ankles?

339
00:29:46,955 --> 00:29:48,165
HOW did he do that?

340
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:50,542
We must convene the Council.

341
00:29:52,628 --> 00:29:54,171
Heaven Scrapers had no evidence

342
00:29:54,254 --> 00:29:55,964
of any activity at all.

343
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:02,888
Oh, the river border
has been breached, huh?

344
00:30:02,971 --> 00:30:04,431
If my soldiers were present,

345
00:30:04,848 --> 00:30:07,059
this "fish man"

346
00:30:07,225 --> 00:30:09,061
would be bound before us
as we speak.

347
00:30:09,144 --> 00:30:11,396
If your muscle brains were present,

348
00:30:11,563 --> 00:30:12,856
they would still be there

349
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,733
choking on their fuzzy adornments.

350
00:30:14,816 --> 00:30:16,068
You bald-headed demon...

351
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:18,028
Show some respect, you two.

352
00:30:18,111 --> 00:30:19,196
Respect?

353
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,782
These men should be
ashamed to show their faces!

354
00:30:21,865 --> 00:30:22,950
Watch your tone, Jabari!

355
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,923
As I was saying,

356
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,884
there was no aerial
surveillance footage of him.

357
00:30:40,968 --> 00:30:42,302
And nothing on the radar as well.

358
00:30:42,469 --> 00:30:45,931
So, he swam underwater
for 100 kilometers.

359
00:30:46,098 --> 00:30:47,599
He was not alone.

360
00:30:47,683 --> 00:30:49,977
And claims to command a massive army.

361
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:54,356
He wants us to deliver
one American scientist?

362
00:30:54,439 --> 00:30:55,482
So he can kill them?

363
00:30:55,565 --> 00:30:56,650
Do it.

364
00:30:58,944 --> 00:31:00,737
We never had to face an enemy

365
00:31:00,821 --> 00:31:02,572
with access to vibranium before.

366
00:31:03,532 --> 00:31:05,534
And we have no Black Panther
to protect us.

367
00:31:05,617 --> 00:31:07,244
That is because this wise Council

368
00:31:07,327 --> 00:31:09,913
allowed Killmonger to take the throne

369
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
and burn up all of your
precious Heart-Shaped Herb.

370
00:31:12,124 --> 00:31:14,626
M'BAKU, what would you have us do?

371
00:31:14,793 --> 00:31:17,170
We should find the fish man
and kill him.

372
00:31:17,963 --> 00:31:21,925
If we do
what he is asking for now,

373
00:31:22,092 --> 00:31:24,511
what is to stop him from coming back

374
00:31:24,594 --> 00:31:26,388
and asking for more?

375
00:31:35,814 --> 00:31:36,857
As you were.

376
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:42,696
Is it just me, or does this
keep getting uglier?

377
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,031
It's you.

378
00:31:44,823 --> 00:31:46,742
- So, does it work?
- Yes.

379
00:31:46,908 --> 00:31:48,326
This thing can detect

380
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,620
the altered frequency of vibranium

381
00:31:50,787 --> 00:31:53,915
through water, stones,
even heavy metals.

382
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:55,792
Whoever built this is brilliant.

383
00:31:56,126 --> 00:31:57,544
Come, look.

384
00:31:58,128 --> 00:32:00,797
Some are custom parts
and others look like

385
00:32:00,964 --> 00:32:02,716
they gathered it from a junkyard.

386
00:32:02,883 --> 00:32:05,135
I am still struggling to believe

387
00:32:05,218 --> 00:32:08,180
that vibranium exists
outside of Wakanda.

388
00:32:08,346 --> 00:32:10,599
Perhaps there was
more than one meteorite.

389
00:32:10,766 --> 00:32:12,476
Our planet is covered of mostly water,

390
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,643
so it's reasonable

391
00:32:13,727 --> 00:32:15,771
that the other one just landed there.

392
00:32:15,937 --> 00:32:18,023
This changes everything that we know.

393
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,651
The Great Mound.
All of the legends and fables.

394
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,237
Those stories are seared in my mind.

395
00:32:24,404 --> 00:32:26,198
That sounds very painful.

396
00:32:28,492 --> 00:32:30,494
So we have to find
this scientist after all.

397
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,830
- I do have an idea.
- Mm.

398
00:32:34,623 --> 00:32:35,957
I'm going to need the princess.

399
00:32:36,124 --> 00:32:38,126
Out of the question.

400
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,420
She is in no state to be in the field.

401
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:45,342
it may do her some good to get out.

402
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:48,470
It might just be exactly
what she needs.

403
00:32:49,012 --> 00:32:51,973
Besides, I can do
this American operation

404
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:53,141
with my eyes closed.

405
00:32:53,225 --> 00:32:56,436
It's not the Americans
that I'm worried about.

406
00:32:56,603 --> 00:32:58,021
This Namor,

407
00:32:58,438 --> 00:33:00,440
he snuck past our defenses.

408
00:33:00,524 --> 00:33:02,526
That will never happen again.

409
00:33:02,609 --> 00:33:04,194
He was not alone.

410
00:33:04,945 --> 00:33:06,113
She'll be with me.

411
00:33:07,364 --> 00:33:08,365
So,

412
00:33:09,324 --> 00:33:10,408
when are we leavin'

413
00:33:10,492 --> 00:33:12,661
so I can see my favorite colonizer?

414
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:24,607
Can't <i>stop.</i>

415
00:33:24,631 --> 00:33:26,391
<i>Addicted to the shindig.</i>

416
00:33:26,466 --> 00:33:28,760
<i>Chop Top,
he says I'm gonna win big...</i>

417
00:33:30,846 --> 00:33:31,847
Whoa.

418
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:34,099
<i>Distant cousin to the reservation.</i>

419
00:33:34,182 --> 00:33:36,852
<i>Defunkt the pistol that you pay for.</i>

420
00:33:36,935 --> 00:33:39,271
<i>This punk, the feeling
that you stay for...</i>

421
00:33:41,481 --> 00:33:42,816
Come on.

422
00:33:44,818 --> 00:33:46,278
Yeah, I got it.

423
00:33:47,195 --> 00:33:48,572
I got it.

424
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,075
Will you slow down?

425
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,333
You didn't think to call?

426
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,877
Now, why would I have your number?

427
00:34:04,462 --> 00:34:05,755
We are looking for the scientist

428
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:07,632
who built the vibranium detector.

429
00:34:08,049 --> 00:34:09,449
So it was you guys in the Atlantic?

430
00:34:10,385 --> 00:34:12,053
Come on.
Mining ship.

431
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,471
Lot of casualties.

432
00:34:14,181 --> 00:34:15,182
What happened?

433
00:34:15,348 --> 00:34:16,391
Seriously?

434
00:34:18,393 --> 00:34:21,271
It was a joint operation.
Us and the SEALs.

435
00:34:21,438 --> 00:34:24,399
Thirty of their top guys,
two of our best officers,

436
00:34:24,566 --> 00:34:25,567
friends of mine.

437
00:34:26,026 --> 00:34:27,027
Gone.

438
00:34:27,194 --> 00:34:28,236
Just like that.

439
00:34:28,695 --> 00:34:29,696
You throw in the fact

440
00:34:29,779 --> 00:34:30,840
that they were tracking vibranium...

441
00:34:30,864 --> 00:34:33,533
I can assure you Wakanda
had nothing to do with this.

442
00:34:34,451 --> 00:34:35,535
So who was it?

443
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,000
God, look, the way that
this is supposed to work

444
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,208
is that I give you information
and you reciprocate.

445
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:43,960
For our own safety,
we cannot tell you.

446
00:34:44,127 --> 00:34:46,213
It's imperative that
we get to the scientist

447
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:47,881
before anything else happens.

448
00:34:48,715 --> 00:34:50,467
You owe me, Ross.

449
00:34:50,634 --> 00:34:52,135
You owe my brother.

450
00:34:55,972 --> 00:34:56,973
Okay, look.

451
00:34:57,766 --> 00:35:00,018
There are agents who have
been sentenced to death

452
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:02,270
for less than I'm about to give you now.

453
00:35:02,437 --> 00:35:03,688
And we got a new director.

454
00:35:04,356 --> 00:35:05,732
She's watching me like a hawk.

455
00:35:05,899 --> 00:35:08,485
We will be very, very careful.

456
00:35:08,652 --> 00:35:10,737
Not just careful,
you gotta be fast.

457
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,405
The US needs another machine

458
00:35:12,489 --> 00:35:14,133
and this kid is
the only person in the world

459
00:35:14,157 --> 00:35:15,408
who knows how to build one.

460
00:35:15,492 --> 00:35:16,534
So they're comin' for her.

461
00:35:16,618 --> 00:35:17,618
A kid?

462
00:35:27,712 --> 00:35:29,714
- Hey.
- You forgot to Venmo me.

463
00:35:29,798 --> 00:35:33,051
Ah, it slipped my mind.
It's eight hundred, right?

464
00:35:33,134 --> 00:35:34,886
Eight hundred was yesterday's price.

465
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,137
It's a band today.

466
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:37,931
That's predatory. I...

467
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,892
I built the whole robotic hand.

468
00:35:40,976 --> 00:35:43,520
You just corrected the grip algorithm.

469
00:35:43,687 --> 00:35:45,063
And what grade did you get?

470
00:35:50,777 --> 00:35:52,529
Thanks.

471
00:35:55,532 --> 00:35:56,759
Ls that an iPhone I see?

472
00:35:56,783 --> 00:35:57,784
Primitive.

473
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:03,164
We have located the scientist.

474
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:05,000
She is in the American equivalent

475
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:06,835
of a Wakandan village school.

476
00:36:06,918 --> 00:36:08,128
<i>A school?</i>

477
00:36:08,628 --> 00:36:11,047
<i>Please tell me
it is a professor.</i>

478
00:36:11,131 --> 00:36:13,008
It's a student, Mother.

479
00:36:13,174 --> 00:36:14,592
We can't give her to Namor.

480
00:36:15,427 --> 00:36:18,096
<i>Bring this student
back to Wakanda.</i>

481
00:36:23,643 --> 00:36:25,003
I've got it from here.

482
00:36:25,353 --> 00:36:27,147
Wait.
Maybe I should speak with her.

483
00:36:27,314 --> 00:36:28,606
It will be more discreet.

484
00:36:29,899 --> 00:36:31,026
I can be discreet.

485
00:36:34,779 --> 00:36:35,780
What?

486
00:36:36,197 --> 00:36:37,365
- Nothing.
- Is it the makeup?

487
00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:38,450
No.

488
00:36:38,533 --> 00:36:39,719
It's the wrong shade, isn't it?

489
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:40,827
It's the right shade.

490
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,495
Fenty 440.
You look good.

491
00:36:44,122 --> 00:36:46,082
I can blend in as a student.

492
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:48,209
I can do this.

493
00:36:52,047 --> 00:36:53,548
- You get five minutes.
- Yes!

494
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:06,811
YO!

495
00:37:06,978 --> 00:37:08,063
Riri Williams?

496
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:13,026
Yo, I don't do drop-bys no more.

497
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:14,229
You gotta go to the website.

498
00:37:15,653 --> 00:37:17,572
It's an encrypted file.

499
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:18,907
I wanted to airdrop it.

500
00:37:19,407 --> 00:37:21,242
You the...

501
00:37:22,786 --> 00:37:23,787
Whew.

502
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,455
You're Princess SHURI.

503
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,625
What the hell are you doing here?

504
00:37:28,792 --> 00:37:30,418
Oh, shit,
am I getting recruited?

505
00:37:32,212 --> 00:37:33,213
No.

506
00:37:33,755 --> 00:37:35,548
I'm here about the vibranium detector

507
00:37:35,632 --> 00:37:37,133
that you built for the CIA.

508
00:37:38,635 --> 00:37:40,804
I ain't built no detector
for no CIA.

509
00:37:40,887 --> 00:37:42,555
I made that for my metallurgy class.

510
00:37:42,722 --> 00:37:44,724
- A school project?
- Yeah.

511
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,893
My professor said
I'd never be able to do it.

512
00:37:48,436 --> 00:37:50,563
To be young, gifted,
and Black though, right?

513
00:37:53,691 --> 00:37:55,860
Y'all probably don't say that in Wakanda.

514
00:37:58,154 --> 00:37:59,197
How old are you?

515
00:38:00,156 --> 00:38:01,449
Nineteen.

516
00:38:01,908 --> 00:38:03,118
Brilliance at a young age

517
00:38:03,201 --> 00:38:05,745
is not always accepted by the elders.

518
00:38:07,163 --> 00:38:08,748
How long did it take you?

519
00:38:08,915 --> 00:38:09,999
Couple months.

520
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,835
- Couple months?
- The hardest part was

521
00:38:11,918 --> 00:38:13,758
finding big enough
Mylar sheets to cover the...

522
00:38:15,505 --> 00:38:17,048
Wait, did I piss off Wakanda?

523
00:38:17,132 --> 00:38:18,216
Not just us.

524
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,301
This place is no longer safe
for you.

525
00:38:21,094 --> 00:38:23,596
Gather your things
and come with me. Right now.

526
00:38:24,472 --> 00:38:27,475
I got Differential Equations
class in, like, 15 minutes.

527
00:38:29,978 --> 00:38:30,979
Okay.

528
00:38:32,063 --> 00:38:33,273
Okay.

529
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,650
You wait right here.

530
00:38:36,484 --> 00:38:39,154
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'm just gonna...

531
00:38:39,571 --> 00:38:40,572
Ooh!

532
00:38:42,615 --> 00:38:44,242
I had it under control.

533
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,662
I said five minutes.
I gave you six.

534
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:49,497
Get out.
Get out of my dorm.

535
00:38:50,165 --> 00:38:51,332
Get out!

536
00:38:51,499 --> 00:38:52,500
Hey.

537
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:55,503
I'm warning you!
Do not take another step

538
00:38:55,587 --> 00:38:56,588
- toward me!
- Oh!

539
00:38:56,671 --> 00:38:57,898
See how they teach the children

540
00:38:57,922 --> 00:38:59,215
to treat their guests?
Mmm!

541
00:39:03,136 --> 00:39:04,220
on...

542
00:39:04,304 --> 00:39:05,638
You brought a spear in here?

543
00:39:05,722 --> 00:39:08,099
You brought a spear in here.

544
00:39:08,808 --> 00:39:09,934
I like her.

545
00:39:10,435 --> 00:39:11,603
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey-

546
00:39:11,686 --> 00:39:13,247
- Put it down, put it...
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

547
00:39:13,271 --> 00:39:14,856
You'll hurt yourself.
Come on.

548
00:39:14,939 --> 00:39:16,608
It's all right, Princess.

549
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:18,026
Small, small girl.

550
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:22,030
I am going to give you two options.

551
00:39:22,197 --> 00:39:24,365
You can come to Wakanda,

552
00:39:24,532 --> 00:39:26,826
conscious or unconscious.

553
00:39:27,619 --> 00:39:30,371
You need to be conscious
of the way that you look.

554
00:39:30,538 --> 00:39:32,499
Walking round here,
all that ash on your head.

555
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:36,461
- Oh, it's funny?
- No, it's not.

556
00:39:36,669 --> 00:39:39,005
- Mm-hmm. I told you!
- You look good.

557
00:39:39,172 --> 00:39:40,840
Calm down.
We'll leave, okay?

558
00:39:41,299 --> 00:39:42,675
And she can deal

559
00:39:42,759 --> 00:39:45,428
with that merman
with the winged ankles

560
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:48,515
who wants to kill her all by herself.

561
00:39:48,681 --> 00:39:50,808
- You got this.
- Mm, with your heater.

562
00:39:50,892 --> 00:39:52,332
Come on. Let's go.

563
00:39:53,061 --> 00:39:54,061
What?

564
00:40:01,152 --> 00:40:02,904
What exactly is this place?

565
00:40:03,613 --> 00:40:05,733
I fixed a few trucks
for the head of sanitation.

566
00:40:06,407 --> 00:40:10,203
He lets me work out
of this garage in exchange.

567
00:40:10,703 --> 00:40:12,288
I just have to grab my work laptop.

568
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:17,794
Please don't touch anything.

569
00:40:17,961 --> 00:40:20,088
You don't have to worry about that.

570
00:40:20,255 --> 00:40:21,673
It may not look like much,

571
00:40:21,756 --> 00:40:23,758
but it's my life's work in here.

572
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:24,842
Mm-hmm.

573
00:40:24,926 --> 00:40:28,346
So, the design for the machine
is on that laptop?

574
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:29,514
Yeah.

575
00:40:29,597 --> 00:40:32,559
And you just leave it
on a desk in a car garage?

576
00:40:32,725 --> 00:40:35,687
I got 2065-byte encryption
on that thing.

577
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:38,982
That's impressive.
Ever locked yourself out?

578
00:40:39,148 --> 00:40:41,067
Took me the whole
semester to get back in.

579
00:40:41,234 --> 00:40:43,278
Had to build a functional quantum computer

580
00:40:43,444 --> 00:40:45,363
just to crack my own encryption.

581
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,907
What is it you're building here?
Is it Stark Tech?

582
00:40:47,991 --> 00:40:49,409
I said don't touch anything.

583
00:40:49,492 --> 00:40:51,202
<i>Princess, American law enforcement</i>

584

585
00:40:52,745 --> 00:40:54,205
- Shit.
- Who was that?

586
00:40:54,622 --> 00:40:55,623
My AI.

587
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,710
They are surrounding us.

588
00:41:02,714 --> 00:41:05,341
I thought you said a merman
was after me.

589
00:41:05,508 --> 00:41:06,551
That's the feds.

590
00:41:19,939 --> 00:41:22,442
Oh, I do not need this shit right now!

591
00:41:22,525 --> 00:41:24,736
I swear to God,
I was doing so well!

592
00:41:24,902 --> 00:41:27,530
Goin' to class on time.
I must be dumb as hell.

593
00:41:27,614 --> 00:41:30,241
Real dumb thinking that
the Princess of Wakanda

594
00:41:30,325 --> 00:41:31,993
is gonna show up at my doorstep

595
00:41:32,076 --> 00:41:33,703
and then shit about to pop off.

596
00:41:33,786 --> 00:41:34,787
I think

597
00:41:34,871 --> 00:41:37,540
that I'm actually gonna take
my chances with this merman,

598
00:41:37,624 --> 00:41:41,336
because at least he never
brought the FBI to my garage!

599
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:44,922
Hey. Namor sank an entire ship
of CIA operatives...

Listen, we need to work
together to get out of here.

607
00:41:55,266 --> 00:41:57,685
General, they've got us surrounded.

608
00:41:57,852 --> 00:41:59,437
Maybe we should just split up.

609
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,022
Out of the question.

610
00:42:01,189 --> 00:42:02,315
Does this vehicle work?

611
00:42:03,733 --> 00:42:04,901
No.

612
00:42:05,902 --> 00:42:09,197
Everything in this lab works.
Including this bike.

613
00:42:09,364 --> 00:42:11,199
Don't even think about it.

614
00:42:11,282 --> 00:42:13,368
Besides, there are three of us.

615
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:15,995
Two of y'all.
I'm takin' this.

616
00:42:16,371 --> 00:42:17,622
Whoo!

617
00:42:17,705 --> 00:42:18,956
I knew it.

618
00:42:19,123 --> 00:42:21,542
Don't tell me that
you built this in two months.

619
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:24,671
I spent years on this.
On and off.

620
00:42:24,754 --> 00:42:27,632
Nice. Have you flown it yet?

621
00:42:27,799 --> 00:42:28,925
That thing can fly?

622
00:42:29,008 --> 00:42:30,968
There's an entire YouTube channel

623
00:42:31,052 --> 00:42:32,845
dedicated to sightings of me.

624
00:42:32,929 --> 00:42:34,013

00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,487

<i>You will not

Keys are on the seat.

636
00:42:52,115 --> 00:42:53,717
Once we get to
the other side of the bridge,

637
00:42:53,741 --> 00:42:55,052
we can lose them in Boston traffic.

00:43:54,635 --> 00:43:55,636
<i>I keep a pole.</i>

662
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,014
<i>Who want the smoke
Who want the fade.</i>

663
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,058
<i>- GRIOT...
- Yes, General?</i>

664
00:44:01,142 --> 00:44:03,019
...take me to the princess

665
00:44:03,186 --> 00:44:05,855
or I will drive my spear
so deep into your CPU,

666
00:44:06,022 --> 00:44:07,315
you will not be able to process

667
00:44:07,398 --> 00:44:09,192
basic input for a millennia.

668
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:10,638
<i>Just one moment, General.</i>

669
00:44:10,777 --> 00:44:12,153
OKOYE, I'm on my way to you.

670
00:44:12,236 --> 00:44:14,238
<i>Bounce, crouch or get slouched.</i>

671
00:44:14,322 --> 00:44:15,615
<i>My whole hood devout</i>

672
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:19,265
<i>My mama taught me
not to be a harlot.</i>

673
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,370
<i>My granny help me
take the wise route.</i>

674
00:44:21,454 --> 00:44:23,206
<i>Although I'm itty bitty
sitting pretty</i>

675
00:44:23,289 --> 00:44:26,417
GRIOT, give me control
of this vehicle right now!

676
00:44:26,584 --> 00:44:28,628
<i>I am clearing you a path.</i>

677
00:44:33,424 --> 00:44:34,759
<i>She's all yours, General.</i>

678
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:36,719
<i>Manual drive engaged.</i>

679
00:44:47,313 --> 00:44:49,482
<i>Look, I know you on my bumper</i>

680
00:44:49,565 --> 00:44:51,359
<i>I know you want my thunder.</i>

681
00:44:51,442 --> 00:44:53,361
<i>Why the laws wanna take us under.</i>

682
00:44:53,444 --> 00:44:54,904
We need to find an extraction point.

683
00:44:55,071 --> 00:44:56,572
There's one across the river.

684
00:44:56,656 --> 00:44:58,282
<i>I know you want my thunder.</i>

685
00:44:58,366 --> 00:45:00,117
<i>Why the laws wanna take us under.</i>

686
00:45:00,201 --> 00:45:02,078
<i>Why the hell am I in this jungle.</i>

687
00:45:02,787 --> 00:45:04,288
Hey, yo, they cuttin' off the bridge.

688
00:45:08,543 --> 00:45:10,670
<i>Princess, there is a surveillance drone</i>

689
00:45:10,753 --> 00:45:12,547
- <i>locked onto you.
- How</i> high?

690
00:45:12,713 --> 00:45:14,048
<i>Thirty-thousand feet.</i>

691
00:45:14,674 --> 00:45:16,554
<i>We don't cry 'bout
how they try take us all out.</i>

692
00:45:16,968 --> 00:45:18,469
- <i>Look
- They want the drip.</i>

693
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:19,971
<i>They want my soul.</i>

694
00:45:20,054 --> 00:45:21,055
Hang on.

695
00:45:21,764 --> 00:45:22,765
I got it.

696
00:45:26,435 --> 00:45:27,436
Come on, Riri.

697
00:45:27,854 --> 00:45:30,106
You gotta find
these differential equations.

698
00:45:30,273 --> 00:45:32,066
Once the relative velocity evens out...

699
00:45:32,149 --> 00:45:34,109
Riri, I'm not sure
you can reach that drone

700
00:45:34,193 --> 00:45:35,194
without an oxygen mask.

701
00:45:37,822 --> 00:45:40,491
<i>Oxygen level is now 55%.</i>

702
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:43,578
Twenty-eight thousand feet.

703
00:45:44,704 --> 00:45:47,290
<i>Oxygen level is now 30%.</i>

704
00:45:50,418 --> 00:45:51,854
Maximum acceleration.
I just need to adjust

705
00:45:51,878 --> 00:45:53,421
my Euler angles and that should...

706
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:55,571
that should drop it right on the...

707
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:03,764
<i>Oxygen, 0%.</i>

708
00:46:07,143 --> 00:46:09,103
<i>The drone is no longer tracking you.</i>

709
00:46:10,021 --> 00:46:12,023
<i>Altitude, 500 feet and falling.</i>

710
00:46:12,106 --> 00:46:13,546
<i>Riri! Are you okay?</i>

711
00:46:14,692 --> 00:46:15,735
- <i>Riri!
- Yeah.</i>

712
00:46:19,322 --> 00:46:20,406
I'm <i>good.</i>

713
00:46:21,324 --> 00:46:22,604
- Incoming!
- Get out of the way!

714
00:46:23,784 --> 00:46:24,887
- Shit!
- And no worries.

715
00:46:24,911 --> 00:46:26,913
<i>I got a special delivery
for y'all in three,</i>

716
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:28,497
<i>two, one...</i>

717
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:31,125
Nice one, Riri!

718
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:32,543
<i>We got the glow We got the soul.</i>

719
00:46:32,627 --> 00:46:33,836
<i>We got the wave.</i>

720
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,379
Whoo!

721
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:41,427
Riri!

722
00:47:08,454 --> 00:47:11,540
What just happened?
SHURI!

723
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:13,084
SHURI!

724
00:47:29,183 --> 00:47:31,435
<i>The Princess's vitals
are stable, General.</i>

725
00:47:31,602 --> 00:47:34,188
<i>She should regain
consciousness momentarily.</i>

726
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:10,725
Take another step closer

727
00:48:11,517 --> 00:48:13,019
and I will kill you all.

728
00:48:13,728 --> 00:48:15,288
Drop your weapons!

729
00:48:23,529 --> 00:48:24,729
Hey, is she blue?

730
00:48:29,535 --> 00:48:30,735
Drop your weapon!

731
00:50:44,628 --> 00:50:45,713
OKOYE!

732
00:50:47,214 --> 00:50:48,215
Wait!

733
00:50:48,299 --> 00:50:49,675
<i>Activating interpretation.</i>

734
00:50:49,758 --> 00:50:50,986
I'm SHURI.

735
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:52,303
Princess of Wakanda.

736
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:54,555
I demand that you take me to Namor.

737
00:50:54,722 --> 00:50:56,807
Do not bring harm to this girl.

738
00:50:59,518 --> 00:51:01,604
<i>Do we take them both alive?</i>

739
00:51:01,896 --> 00:51:04,190
Yes, <i>Attuma.</i>

740
00:51:20,497 --> 00:51:21,624
<i>Breathe.</i>

741
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:31,550
SHURI!

742
00:51:49,985 --> 00:51:52,655
Ross, from the Agency.
You got any witnesses?

743
00:51:52,821 --> 00:51:55,032
None. But we think it was the Wakandans.

744
00:51:55,407 --> 00:51:56,408
Excuse me?

745
00:51:56,492 --> 00:51:57,677
Our field office got a tip from Langley

746
00:51:57,701 --> 00:51:58,702
that they were coming.

747
00:51:58,869 --> 00:52:00,663
Right.
Who made that call?

748
00:52:01,705 --> 00:52:03,305
- She did.
- Director de Fontaine.

749
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:06,877
Director de Fontaine.

750
00:52:06,961 --> 00:52:07,962
Really?

751
00:52:08,045 --> 00:52:09,046
Well...

752
00:52:10,047 --> 00:52:11,924
Uh, Agent thinks it was the Wakandans.

753
00:52:12,466 --> 00:52:13,968
Yeah, we've been on every one of them

754
00:52:14,051 --> 00:52:15,111
since they took out our ship.

755
00:52:15,135 --> 00:52:16,553
That's why I wanted you here.

756
00:52:17,638 --> 00:52:18,722
You're lookin' good.

757
00:52:18,806 --> 00:52:20,391
Oh. Well, I try.

758
00:52:20,557 --> 00:52:22,059
You put that home gym in?

759
00:52:22,142 --> 00:52:23,143
Yeah. Last year.

760
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:26,021
Maybe I'll drop by sometime
and jump on your Peloton.

761
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:27,773
Howdy.

762
00:52:27,856 --> 00:52:29,668
- I'm special agent in charge.
- Oh, good for you.

763
00:52:29,692 --> 00:52:31,860
You wanna walk me through
the evidence here, or what?

764
00:52:32,027 --> 00:52:34,196
- Yeah. Okay. After you.
- Yeah. Okay.

765
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,760
- All right.
- So, what happened here?

766
00:52:36,115 --> 00:52:37,700
Um, we think it was a car crash,

767
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:39,618
but we're having trouble
finding the cars.

768
00:52:39,702 --> 00:52:40,804
What do you mean?

769
00:52:40,828 --> 00:52:42,180
It was just like this
when you found it?

770
00:52:42,204 --> 00:52:43,890
Yes.
We think someone involved

771
00:52:43,914 --> 00:52:44,915
got rid of the vehicles.

772
00:52:44,999 --> 00:52:46,226
Got rid of them how?

773
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,852
They dumped them into the river.

774
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:49,116
You're kidding me.

775
00:52:50,129 --> 00:52:51,714
It's got an MIT sticker on it.

776
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,258
I want that transferred
to the NSA immediately.

777
00:52:54,425 --> 00:52:56,510
Hey, Ross?
You got a full tank of gas?

778
00:52:56,677 --> 00:52:58,345
Can you give me a ride
back to Langley?

779
00:52:58,429 --> 00:53:00,639
It's an eight-hour drive.

780
00:53:00,723 --> 00:53:02,242
Yeah.
We can talk about the case.

781
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:04,643
Actually, wouldn't mind...

782
00:53:04,727 --> 00:53:06,895
Apologizing to you
for a couple of things I said

783
00:53:06,979 --> 00:53:08,022
during our marriage.

784
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,651
They were blue.

785
00:53:13,694 --> 00:53:15,529
And they had superhuman strength.

786
00:53:16,447 --> 00:53:19,283
And they came from the water
on the backs of whales.

787
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:21,827
I struck down three of them

788
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:23,430
with blows that should've killed them,

789
00:53:23,454 --> 00:53:25,164
but they rose again.

790
00:53:25,331 --> 00:53:28,584
I wish to leave immediately
to retrieve our princess.

791
00:53:40,387 --> 00:53:41,597
OKOYE,

792
00:53:41,972 --> 00:53:44,391
you will be stripped of your rank

793
00:53:44,475 --> 00:53:46,477
as General of Wakanda's armies

794
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,521
and your status as Dora Milaje.

795
00:53:57,821 --> 00:53:58,864
You may.

796
00:54:02,826 --> 00:54:04,286
I have given everything.

797
00:54:05,245 --> 00:54:09,041
Let me die saving my country
and that throne.

798
00:54:11,377 --> 00:54:13,170
Allow me to make this right.

799
00:54:13,253 --> 00:54:14,546
"Make it right"?

800
00:54:16,173 --> 00:54:19,301
I do not know if my daughter
is alive or dead.

801
00:54:19,468 --> 00:54:22,721
Perhaps we are being too hasty.

802
00:54:22,805 --> 00:54:24,139
Mmm.

803
00:54:24,807 --> 00:54:29,186
She raised a spear against
her own husband for Wakanda.

804
00:54:29,353 --> 00:54:31,897
Where is her treacherous husband now

805
00:54:32,064 --> 00:54:36,360
but in a place where she can
visit if she wished? Mine...

806
00:54:37,653 --> 00:54:39,530
is with the ancestors.

807
00:54:39,613 --> 00:54:44,410
I am Queen of the most
powerful nation in the world,

808
00:54:44,576 --> 00:54:47,788
and my entire family is gone!

809
00:54:48,622 --> 00:54:51,417
Have I not given everything?

810
00:55:00,592 --> 00:55:02,511
On your feet, General.

811
00:55:08,684 --> 00:55:10,894
I stood by you

812
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:14,690
after Killmonger took the throne,

813
00:55:14,857 --> 00:55:18,444
and you and the elders
in this room stood by him

814
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:22,239
while I ran begging
to the Jabari for protection.

815
00:55:23,615 --> 00:55:25,033
And I warned you

816
00:55:25,117 --> 00:55:27,995
about taking my daughter
on this mission,

817
00:55:28,162 --> 00:55:30,080
and you lost her.

818
00:55:30,831 --> 00:55:32,332
So, today,

819
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:35,419
lam done.

820
00:56:21,507 --> 00:56:24,051
Are you here, GRIOT?

821
00:56:25,385 --> 00:56:26,637
Yes, my Queen.

822
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:31,058
Were you with SHURI
when she was abducted?

823
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:32,518
<i>I was.</i>

824
00:56:32,684 --> 00:56:35,437
Are you able to track
her Kimoyo Beads?

825
00:56:35,604 --> 00:56:38,023
Ballistics found
slugs all over Cambridge.

826
00:56:38,106 --> 00:56:40,192
Those Wakandans really
took a tour of the city.

827
00:56:40,275 --> 00:56:41,276
Hmm.

828
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,160
I can't see how
they figured out who built it.

829
00:56:43,195 --> 00:56:45,614
That information is highly classified.

830
00:56:48,867 --> 00:56:49,868
What is that?

831
00:56:49,952 --> 00:56:51,370
- That's a new ringtone?
- Oh, shit.

832
00:56:52,704 --> 00:56:54,790
Uh, Director, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to take this.

833
00:56:54,873 --> 00:56:56,083
It's enough with the titles.

834
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:57,334
Just take it.
I don't care.

835
00:56:57,417 --> 00:56:58,627
Hey, honey sweetheart.

836
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:00,337
Ooh.

837
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,965
Uh, no, I'm...
I'm with my boss. Now.

838
00:57:03,674 --> 00:57:05,050
Actually, she's leaving.

839
00:57:05,217 --> 00:57:06,218
All right.

840
00:57:06,385 --> 00:57:08,845
I'm gonna work from home,
and then have a shower.

841
00:57:16,228 --> 00:57:17,729
Everett Ross.

842
00:57:17,896 --> 00:57:19,022
Queen Ramonda?

843
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:21,149
What are you doing
with Shuri's Kimoyo Beads?

844
00:57:21,233 --> 00:57:23,193
I didn't know they were hers.
All right?

845
00:57:23,277 --> 00:57:25,529
I just found them
at a pretty ugly crime scene.

846
00:57:26,572 --> 00:57:27,698
Do you have the student?

847
00:57:28,574 --> 00:57:31,535
SHURI was trying to save her
when they were both taken.

848
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:33,912
What?
Taken by who?

849
00:57:35,497 --> 00:57:37,541
My agency assumes it was you.

850
00:57:37,624 --> 00:57:39,668
And I'm worried
they might be onto the fact

851
00:57:39,751 --> 00:57:42,004
that I pointed SHURI and OKOYE
in the right direction.

852
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:43,880
Look, if they're in danger,
I wanna help.

853
00:57:43,964 --> 00:57:45,882
But I can't if I don't know
what's going on.

854
00:57:46,049 --> 00:57:48,760
I am afraid there is
a new world power at play.

855
00:57:49,177 --> 00:57:51,138
A country that's already on our radar?

856
00:57:51,221 --> 00:57:52,222
Or you mean someone else?

857
00:57:52,306 --> 00:57:54,308
<i>That is all I can say for now.</i>

858
00:57:54,474 --> 00:57:55,475
Please,

859
00:57:55,892 --> 00:57:58,562
alert me if your government
decides to act

860
00:57:58,645 --> 00:58:00,230
on their suspicions.

861
00:58:00,314 --> 00:58:01,481
Yeah.
Sure.

862
00:58:02,065 --> 00:58:06,069
Uh, look, if there's anything
I can do to help, let me know.

863
00:58:06,236 --> 00:58:08,030
I owe SHURI my life.

864
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:12,701
GRIOT, did SHURI have
her earrings with her?

865
00:58:12,868 --> 00:58:15,412
<i>I lost track of them
in the North Atlantic,</i>

866
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:18,749
<i>but the people who took her
spoke Yucatec Mayan.</i>

867
00:59:07,005 --> 00:59:08,882
- Hmm?
<i>- Oui,</i> Miss Nakia.

868
00:59:19,351 --> 00:59:20,602
Queen Mother.

869
00:59:22,437 --> 00:59:24,731
Everything is a lesson here
for the children.

870
00:59:24,898 --> 00:59:27,901
They painted the walls,
they feed the fish,

871
00:59:28,068 --> 00:59:30,362
and they grow everything we eat here.

872
00:59:30,529 --> 00:59:33,156
I recognize some of the concepts here.

873
00:59:33,323 --> 00:59:35,283
But you are using different material.

874
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:38,787
Yes, we use strictly what
we can find here in Haiti.

875
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:44,126
You were missed at T'Challa's funeral.

876
00:59:47,254 --> 00:59:48,255
Oh...

877
00:59:55,887 --> 00:59:57,097
Queen Mother.

878
00:59:57,264 --> 01:00:00,225
It's been six years
since you left us.

879
01:00:00,392 --> 01:00:03,562
I thought you would at least
come back for the ceremony.

880
01:00:06,314 --> 01:00:07,816
I was afraid

881
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:12,487
of how final the funeral would be.

882
01:00:12,571 --> 01:00:15,615
Nakia, daughter of Yaa,

883
01:00:16,908 --> 01:00:20,787
wherever you go,
you are still Wakandan,

884
01:00:20,954 --> 01:00:24,583
and you know death is not the end.

885
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:37,471
How is everyone at home?

886
01:00:37,637 --> 01:00:39,973
SHURI has been taken.

887
01:00:40,682 --> 01:00:41,683
What?

888
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:45,103
You have infiltrated
many nations before.

889
01:00:47,522 --> 01:00:48,916
I was a different person then.

890
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:51,985
I need someone who can find
where she is being held,

891
01:00:52,152 --> 01:00:55,197
and rescue her,
without being seen.

892
01:00:55,572 --> 01:00:58,408
Who on earth would risk war with Wakanda?

893
01:01:00,786 --> 01:01:01,870
Oh, my God.

894
01:01:01,953 --> 01:01:03,246
Okay, breathe. Breathe.

895
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:04,790
Oh, don't tell me to breathe.

896
01:01:04,956 --> 01:01:05,957
Where the hell are we?

897
01:01:06,124 --> 01:01:08,251
We're in a cave.
I'm not sure where.

898
01:01:08,335 --> 01:01:09,336
Oh, my God!

899
01:01:09,878 --> 01:01:11,463
What is that?

900
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:14,382
Glow worms.
Their larva gives off light.

901
01:01:14,466 --> 01:01:16,384
Just calm down.

902
01:01:16,802 --> 01:01:18,678
Okay, is there, like,
a new Black Panther

903
01:01:18,762 --> 01:01:20,072
that you can call to come and get us?

904
01:01:20,096 --> 01:01:21,097
No.

905
01:01:21,181 --> 01:01:22,182
Why not?

906
01:01:22,265 --> 01:01:24,059
Because it doesn't
work like that anymore.

907
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:26,394
The Black Panther is gone.

908
01:01:27,062 --> 01:01:28,206
So y'all stopped having Black Panthers

909
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:29,231
when I get kidnapped?

910
01:01:42,327 --> 01:01:44,496
Do you understand her?

911
01:01:44,663 --> 01:01:46,164
Not completely.

912
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:49,459
Nuh-uh.

913
01:01:49,626 --> 01:01:51,962
That is some super villain shit right there.

914
01:01:52,128 --> 01:01:53,463
That's in every movie.

915
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:54,881
Princess Leia.

916
01:01:55,048 --> 01:01:56,328
Belle <i>from Beauty and the Beast.</i>

917
01:01:56,383 --> 01:01:59,010
That white chick from Indiana Jones.

918
01:01:59,094 --> 01:02:00,220
It's fine.

919
01:02:00,303 --> 01:02:02,848
You should see what I have
to wear at Warrior Falls.

920
01:02:11,273 --> 01:02:12,691
Wait.

921
01:02:12,774 --> 01:02:15,235
You're not leaving me in here, are you?

922
01:02:15,318 --> 01:02:16,778
I'm coming back.

923
01:02:17,445 --> 01:02:18,655
I'm coming back.

924
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:20,740
Stay calm.

925
01:04:29,786 --> 01:04:31,413
Princess.

926
01:04:31,579 --> 01:04:32,580
Welcome.

927
01:04:34,541 --> 01:04:37,002
Please, feel free.

928
01:04:44,259 --> 01:04:45,552
This is beautiful.

929
01:04:46,386 --> 01:04:48,138
That was my mother's.

930
01:04:58,189 --> 01:05:00,734
These are all Mesoamerican artifacts.

931
01:05:02,193 --> 01:05:04,070
Most likely 16th century.

932
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,490
Have you been alive since then?

933
01:05:09,451 --> 01:05:10,994
Your mother was human.

934
01:05:12,454 --> 01:05:13,455
She was.

935
01:05:13,621 --> 01:05:15,832
Then she became something else.

936
01:05:15,999 --> 01:05:18,043
- How?
- "HOW?"

937
01:05:18,626 --> 01:05:21,087
"How" is never as important as "why."

938
01:05:32,348 --> 01:05:33,808
<i>My mother and her village</i>

939
01:05:33,892 --> 01:05:35,477
<i>were driven from their farms</i>

940
01:05:35,643 --> 01:05:39,397
by Spanish conquistadors
who brought the smallpox,

941
01:05:39,564 --> 01:05:42,442
a hateful language,
and dogma from another world.

942
01:05:44,235 --> 01:05:45,945
Facing starvation,

943
01:05:46,112 --> 01:05:47,947
war, and disease,

944
01:05:48,406 --> 01:05:50,200
my people turned to Chaac...

945
01:05:51,868 --> 01:05:53,745
our god of rain and abundance.

946
01:05:55,955 --> 01:05:58,792
<i>Chaac gave our shaman a vision...</i>

947
01:05:58,875 --> 01:06:01,544
<i>...a way to save his people.</i>

948
01:06:05,548 --> 01:06:09,928
<i>Chaac led him to a plant
sprouting from a blue rock.</i>

949
01:06:23,399 --> 01:06:25,610
<i>My mother was pregnant with me
at the time,</i>

950
01:06:25,777 --> 01:06:28,029
and she did not want to
ingest the plant

951
01:06:28,196 --> 01:06:30,406
for fear of what it may do to me.

952
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:34,452
But the Shaman was convincing.

953
01:07:06,317 --> 01:07:08,153
<i>They all fell sick.</i>

954
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,156
<i>And their lives,</i>

955
01:07:11,322 --> 01:07:13,449
<i>their existence there,</i>

956
01:07:13,616 --> 01:07:14,909
<i>ended.</i>

957
01:07:26,796 --> 01:07:29,048
<i>The plant took away
their ability to breathe air</i>

958
01:07:29,215 --> 01:07:33,011
but enabled them
to draw oxygen from the sea.

959
01:07:36,347 --> 01:07:38,099
<i>They settled in the ocean,</i>

960
01:07:38,766 --> 01:07:41,895
away from war and diseases.

961
01:08:11,049 --> 01:08:13,218
My mother
gave birth to me there

962
01:08:13,509 --> 01:08:16,763
<i>and I became the firstborn son of Talokan.</i>

963
01:08:17,222 --> 01:08:19,307
<i>The plant gave me wings
on my ankles</i>

964
01:08:19,474 --> 01:08:21,893
<i>and ears that pointed to the clouds.</i>

965
01:08:22,352 --> 01:08:23,603
I was a mutant.

966
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:27,774
I could swim in the sky
and age slower.

967
01:08:27,941 --> 01:08:30,443
Breathe the air
our ancestors breathed.

968
01:08:31,694 --> 01:08:33,279
<i>As she grew older,</i>

969
01:08:34,614 --> 01:08:38,201
<i>my mother mourned the life
on land that she once knew...</i>

970
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:41,871
and died with a broken heart.

971
01:08:44,624 --> 01:08:46,251
She made me promise

972
01:08:46,334 --> 01:08:48,586
to bury her in the soil of her homeland.

973
01:08:53,716 --> 01:08:56,636
Nothing could prepare me
for what I found there.

974
01:09:06,271 --> 01:09:07,272
Huh?

975
01:09:42,974 --> 01:09:44,976
A Spanish man
of faith cursed me.

976
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:47,020
As he died by my hand,

977
01:09:47,186 --> 01:09:48,229
<i>he called me...</i>

978
01:09:53,651 --> 01:09:55,862
The child without love.

979
01:09:56,404 --> 01:09:57,864
And I took my name from there.

980
01:10:03,244 --> 01:10:04,954
<i>"Namor."</i>

981
01:10:05,121 --> 01:10:07,957
<i>Because I have no love
for the surface world.</i>

982
01:10:09,959 --> 01:10:12,045
Why are you telling me all of this?

983
01:10:13,463 --> 01:10:16,591
So that you can understand why
I have to kill the scientist.

984
01:10:16,758 --> 01:10:18,343
What if we took her to Wakanda?

985
01:10:19,719 --> 01:10:20,928
Let us go.

986
01:10:21,888 --> 01:10:23,348
I give you my word.

987
01:10:23,514 --> 01:10:24,974
She will remain in my country.

988
01:10:25,183 --> 01:10:26,642
I cannot risk that, Princess.

989
01:10:26,809 --> 01:10:28,436
Then keep me instead.

990
01:10:30,396 --> 01:10:32,023
I'd love to see your nation.

991
01:10:33,358 --> 01:10:35,985
Well, you can't go down there in that.

992
01:10:38,029 --> 01:10:41,491
Hypothermia will grip you
almost instantaneously.

993
01:10:41,657 --> 01:10:43,910
Your blood will become toxic

994
01:10:43,993 --> 01:10:45,411
and the pressure of the ocean

995
01:10:45,495 --> 01:10:47,914
will break every bone in your body.

996
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,520
Or you can wear a suit.

997
01:10:52,668 --> 01:10:54,420
We have some of them.
Come on.

998
01:10:57,507 --> 01:10:58,508
Stay close.

999
01:12:02,864 --> 01:12:04,532
<i>Hey! Namor, wait!</i>

1000
01:12:49,577 --> 01:12:50,703
<i>Whoa!</i>

1001
01:14:08,114 --> 01:14:09,574
<i>Hello.</i>

1002
01:14:38,144 --> 01:14:39,270
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

1003
01:14:41,105 --> 01:14:42,440
<i>It's made of vibranium.</i>

1004
01:14:42,607 --> 01:14:43,608
Yes.

1005
01:14:43,691 --> 01:14:45,276
In the depths of the ocean,

1006
01:14:45,693 --> 01:14:47,945
I brought the sun to my people.

1007
01:14:50,031 --> 01:14:51,157
I know you wished me

1008
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:53,492
to spare the life of the scientist.

1009
01:14:53,868 --> 01:14:56,120
But now you see
what I have to protect.

1010
01:15:20,936 --> 01:15:23,022
<i><i>Nakia, your hunch was correct.</i>

1011
01:15:23,189 --> 01:15:26,192
<i>I have picked up a location
on Shuri's Kimoyo earrings.</i>

1012
01:15:59,558 --> 01:16:02,186
<i>The signal is coming
from an underwater cavern</i>

1013
01:16:02,353 --> 01:16:05,815
<i>approximately 140 meters
below the surface.</i>

1014
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,734
Queen Mother,
I've found her signal.

1015
01:16:08,901 --> 01:16:11,028
It's coming from an underwater cave.

1016
01:16:12,029 --> 01:16:13,030
If she's down there,

1017
01:16:13,114 --> 01:16:14,740
I'm sure I'll encounter resistance.

1018
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,618
<i>How would you like me to proceed?</i>

1019
01:16:18,536 --> 01:16:22,915
Retrieve the princess
by any means necessary.

1020
01:16:23,082 --> 01:16:26,293
I will attempt to draw Namor out.

1021
01:17:01,203 --> 01:17:02,872
You are the first person
from the surface

1022
01:17:02,955 --> 01:17:04,457
to come to Talokan.

1023
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:07,501
Please take this as a token
of our gratitude.

1024
01:17:14,675 --> 01:17:17,261
It was made with the plant
that saved Talokan.

1025
01:17:20,055 --> 01:17:21,432
You are young, Princess.

1026
01:17:22,308 --> 01:17:25,227
When you age as I do,
you realize

1027
01:17:25,394 --> 01:17:28,147
we all lose everyone we love.

1028
01:17:28,314 --> 01:17:29,899
But when I lost my brother,

1029
01:17:30,065 --> 01:17:31,692
it just felt different.

1030
01:17:31,859 --> 01:17:33,527
He suffered in silence.

1031
01:17:34,111 --> 01:17:37,114
When he finally asked me
to help him, I couldn't.

1032
01:17:38,199 --> 01:17:39,909
How does that make sense

1033
01:17:40,868 --> 01:17:44,538
that the ancestors would
give me gifts and skills

1034
01:17:44,705 --> 01:17:47,458
to help me save my brother,
and I couldn't?

1035
01:17:48,959 --> 01:17:49,960
<i>Why'?</i>

1036
01:17:52,421 --> 01:17:54,924
I don't have an answer
for that question.

1037
01:17:57,051 --> 01:17:59,595
My ancestors would often say,

1038
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:03,390
"Only the most broken people
can be great leaders."

1039
01:18:07,144 --> 01:18:09,313
I admire
what you have built here.

1040
01:18:11,607 --> 01:18:14,068
And how you've protected your people.

1041
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:17,905
But as princess of Wakanda,

1042
01:18:18,072 --> 01:18:20,533
I will not stand for you
killing that young woman.

1043
01:18:22,243 --> 01:18:25,329
My nation will not rest
until I'm returned.

1044
01:18:26,747 --> 01:18:28,874
I'm not leaving without her.

1045
01:18:29,625 --> 01:18:33,337
We need to find a peaceful way
to resolve this.

1046
01:18:37,007 --> 01:18:38,717
It is no longer about the scientist.

1047
01:18:40,803 --> 01:18:42,429
For centuries,
the surface nations

1048
01:18:42,513 --> 01:18:45,307
have conquered and enslaved
people like us.

1049
01:18:45,975 --> 01:18:47,434
Over resources.

1050
01:18:48,853 --> 01:18:51,105
Since the day
I buried my mother,

1051
01:18:51,272 --> 01:18:52,898
I have prepared my people

1052
01:18:52,982 --> 01:18:55,109
for the time they will come for us.

1053
01:18:55,276 --> 01:18:59,488
And that machine is the sign
that the time is now.

1054
01:19:01,365 --> 01:19:06,704
I need to know if Wakanda
is an ally or an enemy.

1055
01:19:07,121 --> 01:19:08,998
There is no in-between.

1056
01:19:11,125 --> 01:19:14,837
So you plan to wage war
on the entire world,

1057
01:19:15,421 --> 01:19:17,756
and you want Wakanda to help you?

1058
01:19:18,674 --> 01:19:19,842
That's madness.

1059
01:19:20,009 --> 01:19:23,012
There isn't a nation
that wouldn't plunder Wakanda

1060
01:19:23,095 --> 01:19:24,638
if given a chance.

1061
01:19:25,973 --> 01:19:27,892
If we make an alliance,

1062
01:19:28,058 --> 01:19:30,769
we can protect each other
by striking them first.

1063
01:19:31,312 --> 01:19:35,566
Then, when the threat of these
nations has been eliminated,

1064
01:19:35,733 --> 01:19:38,360
the scientist will be returned to Wakanda.

1065
01:19:38,777 --> 01:19:41,572
And if Wakanda does not accept, what then?

1066
01:19:42,656 --> 01:19:44,617
The scientist will die.

1067
01:19:45,618 --> 01:19:48,537
And Wakanda will be
the first nation to fall.

1068
01:19:48,787 --> 01:19:50,331
An attack on my people?

1069
01:19:50,664 --> 01:19:52,124
Yes.

1070
01:19:52,291 --> 01:19:54,668
And I want you to listen to me.

1071
01:19:54,835 --> 01:19:57,796
Wakanda cannot win a war with Talokan.

1072
01:20:09,642 --> 01:20:11,852
I heard you that night,

1073
01:20:11,936 --> 01:20:13,938
with your mother at the river.

1074
01:20:15,230 --> 01:20:17,983
You said you wanted to burn the world.

1075
01:20:24,156 --> 01:20:25,658
Let us burn it together.

1076
01:20:34,291 --> 01:20:35,518
US Secretary of State:
Queen Ramonda

1077
01:20:35,542 --> 01:20:37,211
won't sell us any vibranium.

1078
01:20:37,962 --> 01:20:39,505
And now they abducted a young woman

1079
01:20:39,588 --> 01:20:40,839
who built the machine.

1080
01:20:41,006 --> 01:20:42,299
Yeah, with all due respect,

1081
01:20:42,383 --> 01:20:44,009
Riri Williams is a child prodigy

1082
01:20:44,093 --> 01:20:46,303
who was running circles around
all of her professors.

1083
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:47,930
The Wakandans were recruiting her

1084
01:20:48,013 --> 01:20:49,373
as part of their outreach program.

1085
01:20:49,515 --> 01:20:50,933
Nothing more.
And then,

1086
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:53,477
you guys send in a SWAT team
under cover of night

1087
01:20:53,644 --> 01:20:55,646
to arrest the Crown Princess

1088
01:20:55,729 --> 01:20:57,064
of an international superpower.

1089
01:21:00,234 --> 01:21:01,954
The President wants
to take offensive action

1090
01:21:01,986 --> 01:21:03,028
against Wakanda.

1091
01:21:04,446 --> 01:21:06,323
What type of offensive action?

1092
01:21:07,032 --> 01:21:08,575
Destabilization.

1093
01:21:09,743 --> 01:21:13,080
Well, Special Officer Ross is our expert.

1094
01:21:13,247 --> 01:21:15,457
So, Ross, what do you think?

1095
01:21:15,624 --> 01:21:17,126
My sources are telling me

1096
01:21:17,209 --> 01:21:18,649
that there's someone else out there.

1097
01:21:19,336 --> 01:21:21,256
- Another nation?
- Could be. I don't know.

1098
01:21:21,338 --> 01:21:22,399
You've gotta give me enough time

1099
01:21:22,423 --> 01:21:23,566
to investigate this properly,

1100
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:25,718
otherwise we're gonna
find ourselves at war

1101
01:21:25,884 --> 01:21:27,720
with a country whose military capacity

1102
01:21:27,803 --> 01:21:29,763
we can't even comprehend.

1103
01:21:31,348 --> 01:21:32,349
Director?

1104
01:21:32,808 --> 01:21:35,060
I think he's the expert.

1105
01:21:35,144 --> 01:21:38,147
I think it would be a mistake
to attack Wakanda.

1106
01:21:44,945 --> 01:21:45,946
<i>Yes?</i>

1107
01:21:46,030 --> 01:21:47,030
We have a problem.

1108
01:22:08,594 --> 01:22:10,929
Is my daughter alive?

1109
01:22:11,096 --> 01:22:13,057
The princess is alive and well.

1110
01:22:13,766 --> 01:22:16,602
She requested to be taken to Talokan.

1111
01:22:16,769 --> 01:22:19,146
She will remain there
for the time being.

1112
01:22:22,775 --> 01:22:26,028
What can I offer you in exchange?

1113
01:22:26,445 --> 01:22:27,446
Nothing.

1114
01:22:27,905 --> 01:22:29,615
I beg to differ.

1115
01:22:29,782 --> 01:22:33,452
The Americans are preparing
to blame Wakanda

1116
01:22:33,535 --> 01:22:36,080
for your attack on their mining ship.

1117
01:22:36,246 --> 01:22:39,208
Return my daughter and the scientist

1118
01:22:39,374 --> 01:22:42,961
or I will inform them
of your existence.

1119
01:22:49,676 --> 01:22:51,804
If you tell the Americans about us,

1120
01:22:53,305 --> 01:22:55,474
if you try to find us,

1121
01:22:56,558 --> 01:23:00,354
or if I discover a single
Wakandan ship in the ocean,

1122
01:23:01,146 --> 01:23:02,606
I will kill the princess.

1123
01:23:04,149 --> 01:23:05,943
I will come to Wakanda

1124
01:23:06,110 --> 01:23:08,070
and I will kill you.

1125
01:23:17,412 --> 01:23:18,455
So, what happened?

1126
01:23:20,332 --> 01:23:23,335
He wants to go to war
with the surface world,

1127
01:23:23,502 --> 01:23:25,295
and asked me to help him.

1128
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,218
I need to think.

1129
01:23:32,094 --> 01:23:34,054
We ain't never gettin' out of here.

1130
01:23:43,105 --> 01:23:44,106
Ey!

1131
01:24:07,504 --> 01:24:08,505
SHURI...

1132
01:24:15,637 --> 01:24:16,763
Are you okay?

1133
01:24:17,556 --> 01:24:18,932
Are you okay?

1134
01:24:19,183 --> 01:24:20,463
- Give me your Beads!
- Let's go.

1135
01:24:20,601 --> 01:24:21,977
Give me your Beads.
I can save her.

1136
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:23,061
We have to go.

1137
01:24:23,228 --> 01:24:24,414
SHURI, I don't know who this lady is,

1138
01:24:24,438 --> 01:24:25,598
but we need to listen to her.

1139
01:24:25,689 --> 01:24:27,000
Listen, I hit her with a sonic round.

1140
01:24:27,024 --> 01:24:29,276
It is lethal from this distance.
There is no chance.

1141
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:31,236
You don't understand.
This will mean war.

1142
01:24:31,403 --> 01:24:33,739
- We have to go.
- Wait!

1143
01:25:17,366 --> 01:25:18,367
Did they hurt you?

1144
01:25:18,450 --> 01:25:20,077
No.
No.

1145
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:22,829
Thank you.

1146
01:25:26,333 --> 01:25:27,602
- GRIOT.
<i>- Yes,</i> my Queen.

1147
01:25:27,626 --> 01:25:29,670
Return us to Wakanda at once.

1148
01:28:26,596 --> 01:28:29,015
Princess,
it is good to have you back.

1149
01:28:29,558 --> 01:28:31,351
The city has been on edge
since you left.

1150
01:28:32,269 --> 01:28:33,270
Go.

1151
01:28:33,437 --> 01:28:36,022
Fortify the sonic barriers
for all waterways.

1152
01:28:36,189 --> 01:28:37,190
Princess?

1153
01:28:38,108 --> 01:28:39,109
Neka.

1154
01:28:41,069 --> 01:28:43,447
Thank the ancestors.
Hmm?

1155
01:28:43,780 --> 01:28:46,992
I just wanted to return these.

1156
01:28:48,201 --> 01:28:50,370
No.
Keep them.

1157
01:28:50,537 --> 01:28:52,038
Might need them soon.

1158
01:28:52,956 --> 01:28:54,958
Did you get that from down there?

1159
01:28:57,919 --> 01:29:01,298
Is it true you saw an underwater empire?

1160
01:29:02,549 --> 01:29:04,301
- Yes.
- Hmm.

1161
01:29:04,968 --> 01:29:06,553
It is beautiful.

1162
01:29:07,804 --> 01:29:10,432
But these people are dangerous, Aneka.

1163
01:29:10,932 --> 01:29:11,975
Mm.

1164
01:29:30,619 --> 01:29:33,413
So, Miss Riri Williams,

1165
01:29:34,164 --> 01:29:36,333
what do you think of Wakanda?

1166
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:38,502
The stories just don't do
this place justice.

1167
01:29:41,630 --> 01:29:42,672
It's great.

1168
01:29:42,839 --> 01:29:44,591
But I really would like to go home.

1169
01:29:46,051 --> 01:29:47,636
You will need to be patient.

1170
01:29:47,802 --> 01:29:49,846
Can I at least call my mom?

1171
01:29:56,269 --> 01:29:57,747
The Princess has been brought home

1172
01:29:57,771 --> 01:29:59,564
by the War Dog Nakia.

1173
01:29:59,731 --> 01:30:01,107
Glory to Hanuman.

1174
01:30:01,191 --> 01:30:02,651
Glory to Hanuman.

1175
01:30:02,734 --> 01:30:07,280
Mmm.
The spy saves Wakanda once again.

1176
01:30:07,864 --> 01:30:09,324
The Queen will reward her

1177
01:30:09,491 --> 01:30:11,993
with lifetime banishment.
I'm sure of it.

1178
01:30:14,454 --> 01:30:15,914
OKOYE.

1179
01:30:21,545 --> 01:30:23,145
<i>After Thanos' attack,</i>

1180
01:30:23,255 --> 01:30:25,382
when you left without saying a word,

1181
01:30:26,007 --> 01:30:27,175
it hurt.

1182
01:30:31,137 --> 01:30:34,558
I regret not being there
with all of you.

1183
01:30:36,059 --> 01:30:37,352
It was not easy.

1184
01:30:38,144 --> 01:30:39,145
He was...

1185
01:30:39,813 --> 01:30:43,650
King and Black Panther to everyone.

1186
01:30:44,317 --> 01:30:46,486
But 110 me...

1187
01:30:52,242 --> 01:30:53,952
He was everything.

1188
01:30:55,829 --> 01:30:57,789
My T'Challa.

1189
01:30:59,124 --> 01:31:02,085
When he was taken away
from me, just like that, I...

1190
01:31:02,836 --> 01:31:04,713
I had to step away

1191
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:07,257
and let myself break.

1192
01:31:09,926 --> 01:31:11,136
I couldn't just...

1193
01:31:12,095 --> 01:31:15,473
keep going as if nothing
had happened, you know.

1194
01:31:16,308 --> 01:31:18,268
Mm-hmm.

1195
01:31:33,283 --> 01:31:34,284
We are under attack.

1196
01:31:42,167 --> 01:31:43,251
Here.

1197
01:31:51,926 --> 01:31:53,654
Are you okay?
Are you all right?

1198
01:31:53,678 --> 01:31:55,555
GRIOT, activate the Sunbird.

1199
01:31:55,722 --> 01:31:56,890
SHURI, where are you?

1200
01:31:57,057 --> 01:31:58,516
Making my way to the city right now.

1201
01:31:58,683 --> 01:32:00,143
Stand down!
That is an order!

1202
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:02,604
Mother, I'm with Aneka.
We can provide air support.

1203
01:32:02,771 --> 01:32:04,206
<i>Aneka,
do not let her leave the lab.</i>

1204
01:32:04,230 --> 01:32:05,374
Mother, you're...
you're breaking up.

1205
01:32:05,398 --> 01:32:06,459
- We can't hear you.
- SHURI!

1206
01:32:06,483 --> 01:32:07,484
Love you. Bye!

1207
01:32:09,819 --> 01:32:11,019
You just hung up on the Queen.

1208
01:32:11,071 --> 01:32:12,072
<i>Husk hung up on my mom.</i>

1209
01:32:12,238 --> 01:32:13,823
There's a difference.
Come. Let's go!

1210
01:32:46,064 --> 01:32:48,149
Invaders!

1211
01:32:53,738 --> 01:32:56,950
Mama! Mama!

1212
01:33:05,375 --> 01:33:06,435
<i>EMTs are suffering</i>

1213
01:33:06,459 --> 01:33:08,253
<i>a form of sonic hypnosis.</i>

1214
01:33:12,257 --> 01:33:14,092
General, <i>plug</i> your ears.

1215
01:33:14,259 --> 01:33:15,343
Yes, my Queen.

1216
01:34:01,765 --> 01:34:03,892
- Can I help?
- Come, quickly.

1217
01:34:14,486 --> 01:34:15,629
Cross your arms...

1218
01:34:21,326 --> 01:34:22,327
Nakia.

1219
01:34:36,716 --> 01:34:38,009
The fish man.

1220
01:35:13,127 --> 01:35:14,128
<i>Phambili!</i>

1221
01:36:26,367 --> 01:36:27,469
Shit, he's too fast.

1222
01:36:27,493 --> 01:36:28,693
He's even faster in the water.

1223
01:36:54,395 --> 01:36:55,956
- Activating system override.
- No.

1224
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:57,041
Wait! I'll fix it.

1225
01:36:57,065 --> 01:36:58,985
Can't leave you here, SHURI!

1226
01:37:15,458 --> 01:37:16,459
Do you see her?

1227
01:37:16,542 --> 01:37:17,919
Yes.
Right there.

1228
01:37:31,432 --> 01:37:33,101
Go, child.

1229
01:37:33,893 --> 01:37:35,436
Wait, what?
And leave you here?

1230
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:36,521
Run!

1231
01:37:51,202 --> 01:37:52,662
OKOYE, move now!

1232
01:39:00,396 --> 01:39:01,481
She did this.

1233
01:39:05,526 --> 01:39:06,694
In one week's time,

1234
01:39:06,778 --> 01:39:09,447
I will return with my entire army

1235
01:39:09,614 --> 01:39:12,867
and you will join us
against the surface world,

1236
01:39:13,034 --> 01:39:15,995
or I will wash Wakanda
from the face of the Earth.

1237
01:39:18,956 --> 01:39:19,957
Mother.

1238
01:39:20,416 --> 01:39:22,126
- Keep her back!
- Mother!

1239
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:25,171
- Mama! Mama!
- Bury your dead.

1240
01:39:25,922 --> 01:39:27,465
Mourn your losses.

1241
01:39:30,802 --> 01:39:32,386
You are queen now.

1242
01:39:32,637 --> 01:39:33,638
Mother!

1243
01:39:34,347 --> 01:39:35,348
No!

1244
01:39:38,518 --> 01:39:40,061
Get off of me!
Mother!

1245
01:39:40,812 --> 01:39:42,688
Mama!

1246
01:39:49,529 --> 01:39:51,572
Mama!

1247
01:39:51,656 --> 01:39:53,074
Mama!

1248
01:39:53,658 --> 01:39:54,826
Mother!

1249
01:40:02,375 --> 01:40:03,709
Help me!

1250
01:40:03,876 --> 01:40:05,169
Mama!

1251
01:40:12,677 --> 01:40:14,804
Mama!

1252
01:40:55,511 --> 01:41:00,683
Jabariland offers you
their comfort for your loss.

1253
01:41:07,315 --> 01:41:08,983
You must mourn her

1254
01:41:09,150 --> 01:41:13,070
in accordance to the rituals
of your ancestors.

1255
01:41:15,031 --> 01:41:16,866
Do not bury yourself in your technology.

1256
01:41:17,033 --> 01:41:18,284
Why are you here?

1257
01:41:20,161 --> 01:41:21,871
I promised your brother

1258
01:41:22,038 --> 01:41:24,332
that I would provide you with counsel

1259
01:41:24,498 --> 01:41:25,917
and protection.

1260
01:41:28,377 --> 01:41:30,588
But I am in need of your advice today.

1261
01:41:34,425 --> 01:41:36,177
Your tribal elders have approached me

1262
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:38,054
with a proposition.

1263
01:41:39,472 --> 01:41:42,725
They wish to evacuate the city
and set up camp

1264
01:41:42,892 --> 01:41:44,393
in Jabariland.

1265
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:47,730
So, now you are keen
to hear from a child

1266
01:41:48,397 --> 01:41:50,066
who scoffs at tradition?

1267
01:41:51,067 --> 01:41:52,109
Mm.

1268
01:41:54,278 --> 01:41:55,279
The world...

1269
01:41:57,198 --> 01:41:59,867
The world has taken too much from you

1270
01:42:00,618 --> 01:42:03,871
for you to still be considered a child.

1271
01:42:06,999 --> 01:42:08,918
It is in my people's interest
to know

1272
01:42:09,001 --> 01:42:11,462
which way your mind is leaning.

1273
01:42:13,339 --> 01:42:15,049
The elders are desperate.

1274
01:42:16,676 --> 01:42:18,594
The city is vulnerable.

1275
01:42:20,805 --> 01:42:22,974
If you are to provide for them,

1276
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:26,352
they will be in great debt to you.

1277
01:42:28,437 --> 01:42:30,147
And what of your heart?

1278
01:42:31,274 --> 01:42:32,275
Hmm?

1279
01:42:33,693 --> 01:42:35,695
Which way is your heart leaning?

1280
01:42:37,571 --> 01:42:40,533
I just buried the last person
who truly knew me.

1281
01:42:44,036 --> 01:42:45,705
My heart was buried with her.

1282
01:43:21,824 --> 01:43:23,701
Oh, man.

1283
01:43:24,577 --> 01:43:26,495
Yeah, your olive oil's about to go bad.

1284
01:43:26,662 --> 01:43:27,806
What... What are you doing here?

1285
01:43:27,830 --> 01:43:30,499
I'm hungry. And...

1286
01:43:30,916 --> 01:43:32,918
<i>Tragedy strikes
the international community.</i>

1287
01:43:33,002 --> 01:43:34,170
<i>Sources can now confirm</i>

1288
01:43:34,253 --> 01:43:37,214
<i>that Queen Ramonda,
daughter of Lumumba, has died.</i>

1289
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:39,425
<i>Western allies say
that civil conflict</i>

1290
01:43:39,508 --> 01:43:41,552
<i>was the likely cause
of the Queen's...</i>

1291
01:43:44,096 --> 01:43:45,097
So...

1292
01:43:45,473 --> 01:43:46,807
You have any comment?

1293
01:43:48,976 --> 01:43:52,146
I wonder what else your
friends are keeping from you.

1294
01:43:52,355 --> 01:43:53,981
What are you talking about?

1295
01:43:54,148 --> 01:43:57,651
I have no unsanctioned contact
with the kingdom of Wakanda.

1296
01:44:00,071 --> 01:44:02,239
What about the Beads?

1297
01:44:02,531 --> 01:44:04,533
What?

1298
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:05,701
The Beads.

1299
01:44:05,868 --> 01:44:06,994
I had them bugged

1300
01:44:07,161 --> 01:44:08,829
before you ever even got there.

1301
01:44:08,996 --> 01:44:12,833
I've been privy to every
conversation you've had,

1302
01:44:12,917 --> 01:44:15,586
including that treasonous call
with the Queen.

1303
01:44:15,753 --> 01:44:17,129
May she rest in peace.

1304
01:44:17,546 --> 01:44:18,839
But it's good.

1305
01:44:19,006 --> 01:44:20,049
Well, for us.

1306
01:44:20,216 --> 01:44:22,927
All right. You know what?
The Wakandans saved my life.

1307
01:44:23,427 --> 01:44:25,054
- They're a good people.
- Mm-hmm.

1308
01:44:25,137 --> 01:44:27,181
You ever thought for a second

1309
01:44:27,348 --> 01:44:28,974
what they could be doing?

1310
01:44:29,141 --> 01:44:30,559
Ever thought what we would be doing

1311
01:44:30,643 --> 01:44:33,854
if the US was the only country
in the world with vibranium?

1312
01:44:34,105 --> 01:44:38,401
Oh, I actually dream about that.

1313
01:44:41,237 --> 01:44:42,905
Val. Val, please.

1314
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:44,907
It's Director de Fontaine.

1315
01:44:47,785 --> 01:44:50,955
Your mother protected me
like I was one of her own.

1316
01:44:52,248 --> 01:44:54,708
The least that I could do
is try to return the favor.

1317
01:44:57,044 --> 01:44:59,422
We need to find a way to weaken Namor.

1318
01:44:59,588 --> 01:45:01,757
Even weakened,
he's still gonna be a problem.

1319
01:45:01,924 --> 01:45:05,344
The Black Panther has never
failed to protect Wakanda.

1320
01:45:06,095 --> 01:45:08,097
I thought the Black Panther was gone.

1321
01:45:17,815 --> 01:45:19,150
My brother is dead.

1322
01:45:20,901 --> 01:45:23,487
But it doesn't mean
the Black Panther is gone.

1323
01:45:41,255 --> 01:45:42,798
GRIOT?

1324
01:45:42,965 --> 01:45:45,593
Let's start by running
a comparative analysis

1325
01:45:45,759 --> 01:45:47,553
between our attempts at creating

1326
01:45:47,636 --> 01:45:49,346
a synthetic Heart-Shaped Herb...

1327
01:45:52,057 --> 01:45:54,018
and the fibers from this bracelet.

1328
01:45:54,602 --> 01:45:55,895
<i>Yes, Princess.</i>

1329
01:45:59,190 --> 01:46:01,942
Since this was grown
from vibranium-rich soil,

1330
01:46:03,194 --> 01:46:05,446
they may share
some base-level similarities

1331
01:46:05,529 --> 01:46:06,655
that we can exploit.

1332
01:46:06,822 --> 01:46:08,115
<i>As you wish, Princess.</i>

1333
01:46:12,411 --> 01:46:14,830
Please upload my brother's DNA also.

1334
01:46:14,997 --> 01:46:16,123
<i>Uploading now.</i>

1335
01:46:32,723 --> 01:46:34,850
<i>Who do I turn to.</i>

1336
01:46:35,476 --> 01:46:37,102
<i>When I need saving</i>

1337
01:46:37,770 --> 01:46:39,939
<i>'Cause you move mountain.</i>

1338
01:46:40,523 --> 01:46:42,358
<i>I can't do the same.</i>

1339
01:46:43,192 --> 01:46:44,693
<i>And did you think about.</i>

1340
01:46:46,403 --> 01:46:47,613
<i>When you left us.</i>

1341
01:46:47,696 --> 01:46:49,031
Why doesn't he look like them?

1342
01:46:49,198 --> 01:46:51,408
His physiology is completely different.

1343
01:46:51,575 --> 01:46:54,245
None of them fly
or have pointed ears like him.

1344
01:46:54,745 --> 01:46:55,805
The women that were guarding us,

1345
01:46:55,829 --> 01:46:56,890
they had water over their mouths

1346
01:46:56,914 --> 01:46:58,624
and on their necks.

1347
01:46:58,707 --> 01:46:59,708
He didn't have that.

1348
01:46:59,875 --> 01:47:02,294
Several organisms don't need gills

1349
01:47:02,378 --> 01:47:05,297
to extract oxygen
from the water, so...

1350
01:47:05,464 --> 01:47:07,007
It's like a jellyfish.

1351
01:47:07,174 --> 01:47:10,970
He just absorbs the oxygen
from his skin.

1352
01:47:12,304 --> 01:47:13,305
It's a process called

1353
01:47:13,389 --> 01:47:14,598
- diffusion.
- Diffusion.

1354
01:47:16,892 --> 01:47:21,397
<i>Memories, oh, carry me go.</i>

1355
01:47:22,231 --> 01:47:25,859
<i>Carry me go, oh, nowhere.</i>

1356
01:47:26,318 --> 01:47:29,863
<i>Sick and tired of it all
Take me far-away.</i>

1357
01:47:29,947 --> 01:47:32,241
<i>Mr Dj Gbemi trabaye.</i>

1358
01:47:32,324 --> 01:47:34,994
<i>Now I no fit trust anybody.</i>

1359
01:47:35,077 --> 01:47:36,829
<i>Na e make I no fit shout.</i>

1360
01:47:36,912 --> 01:47:38,831
<i>My body don dey tire eh.</i>

1361
01:47:38,914 --> 01:47:41,709
Every day that passes
without selecting the ruler

1362
01:47:41,875 --> 01:47:43,252
is a day wasted.

1363
01:47:43,419 --> 01:47:45,004
We must deal with Namor

1364
01:47:45,087 --> 01:47:46,839
before he brings
his warriors back here.

1365
01:47:47,006 --> 01:47:49,675
And how are we to deal with
a man with that much power?

1366
01:47:50,551 --> 01:47:52,351
In that attack,
before he took out your plane,

1367
01:47:52,428 --> 01:47:53,679
he jumped back into the water.

1368
01:47:53,846 --> 01:47:55,598
What if that's what makes him strong?

1369
01:47:55,764 --> 01:47:57,683
He's breathing air and getting oxygen

1370
01:47:57,766 --> 01:47:59,310
from the water on his skin.

1371
01:47:59,476 --> 01:48:01,520
If we could find a way
to dry his ass out,

1372
01:48:01,604 --> 01:48:02,730
he won't be as strong.

1373
01:48:03,063 --> 01:48:04,315
Yo, that's it.

1374
01:48:04,398 --> 01:48:07,610
GRIOT. We need to convert
the Royal Talon Fighter

1375
01:48:07,693 --> 01:48:09,236
into a pervaporation chamber.

1376
01:48:09,403 --> 01:48:10,487
Is that even possible?

1377
01:48:10,654 --> 01:48:11,822
Yes.

1378
01:48:13,324 --> 01:48:15,242
You're going to help us trap him.

1379
01:48:16,076 --> 01:48:18,078
Please show Miss Williams
where she's working.

1380
01:48:18,245 --> 01:48:19,788
Right this way.

1381
01:48:23,626 --> 01:48:24,627
<i>How old were you</i>

1382
01:48:24,710 --> 01:48:26,128
<i>when you built your first machine?</i>

1383
01:48:26,295 --> 01:48:27,379
Three.

1384
01:48:27,546 --> 01:48:31,008
<i>My stepdad was a car mechanic.
He wanted to build airplanes.</i>

1385
01:48:31,175 --> 01:48:33,636
<i>He gave me these tools
and let me just work it out.</i>

1386
01:48:37,556 --> 01:48:39,850
<i>So who taught you
how to do all that you do?</i>

1387
01:48:40,184 --> 01:48:41,435
<i>My big brother.</i>

1388
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:47,816
I was the tip of
the spear of Wakanda's army.

1389
01:48:47,983 --> 01:48:50,402
This is not me.

1390
01:48:50,903 --> 01:48:53,072
Besides, I'm a civilian now.

1391
01:48:54,156 --> 01:48:55,532
I turned in my weapon.

1392
01:48:56,158 --> 01:48:57,826
I built you a new spear as well.

1393
01:48:59,703 --> 01:49:00,704
A new one?

1394
01:49:00,871 --> 01:49:01,914
Yes.

1395
01:49:03,248 --> 01:49:05,626
What is this contraption's name anyway?

1396
01:49:05,793 --> 01:49:07,252
The Midnight Angel.

1397
01:49:07,419 --> 01:49:08,879
Midnight Angel?

1398
01:49:11,799 --> 01:49:14,009
This will even
the odds against them.

1399
01:49:14,176 --> 01:49:16,637
Sister, I need you to
be ready when I call you.

1400
01:49:18,472 --> 01:49:19,682
Please.

1401
01:49:19,765 --> 01:49:22,309
<i>My body don dey tire eh.</i>

1402
01:49:22,393 --> 01:49:24,186
<i>Make me mara eh</i>

1403
01:49:24,269 --> 01:49:25,479
SHURI.

1404
01:49:26,146 --> 01:49:27,314
Yes.

1405
01:49:28,941 --> 01:49:30,526
How many of these did you make?

1406
01:49:32,653 --> 01:49:34,613
I looked for you
at the Jabari outpost.

1407
01:49:34,780 --> 01:49:36,448
I won't be forced out of my home.

1408
01:49:36,615 --> 01:49:39,159
You have such a rebellious spirit.

1409
01:49:39,243 --> 01:49:40,703
Why did you join the Dora?

1410
01:49:41,745 --> 01:49:42,913
Why do you care?

1411
01:49:43,205 --> 01:49:45,958
<i>As far as I can see
Na the memories.</i>

1412
01:49:46,041 --> 01:49:48,585
<i>Wey Dey carry me From reality.</i>

1413
01:49:48,669 --> 01:49:50,087
<i>E no require visa</i>

1414
01:49:50,170 --> 01:49:52,673
I still have a lot of fight left in me.

1415
01:49:53,173 --> 01:49:56,301
Tell me, Aneka,
daughter of Kyana,

1416
01:49:56,969 --> 01:49:59,179
do you still have
some fight left in you?

1417
01:49:59,346 --> 01:50:01,765
What do you have in mind?

1418
01:50:02,474 --> 01:50:05,310
<i>My body don dey tire eh</i>

1419
01:50:13,694 --> 01:50:15,738
<i>My body don dey tire eh.</i>

1420
01:50:15,821 --> 01:50:18,323
<i>Make me mara eh.</i>

1421
01:50:18,407 --> 01:50:20,909
<i>When my whole world
is set on fire.</i>

1422
01:50:20,993 --> 01:50:23,787
<i>Don't leave me alone.</i>

1423
01:50:26,415 --> 01:50:27,416
GRIOT,

1424
01:50:28,959 --> 01:50:30,419
what's the confidence rate?

1425
01:50:31,044 --> 01:50:33,338
<i>98.7%, Princess.</i>

1426
01:50:33,714 --> 01:50:36,383
<i>Would you like me to print
the Heart-Shaped Herb?</i>

1427
01:50:43,682 --> 01:50:45,976
Thought you'd be back in Haiti by now.

1428
01:50:47,102 --> 01:50:48,645
I'm still Wakandan, you know.

1429
01:50:52,691 --> 01:50:53,692
So...

1430
01:50:54,985 --> 01:50:57,946
this is what you've been up to.

1431
01:50:58,739 --> 01:50:59,907
Yes.

1432
01:51:00,073 --> 01:51:01,992
What you have here, now,

1433
01:51:03,243 --> 01:51:07,456
is a chance to restore
Wakanda's protector.

1434
01:51:07,539 --> 01:51:12,961
It would be the greatest gift

1435
01:51:13,420 --> 01:51:15,756
since Bashenga's discovery.

1436
01:51:20,886 --> 01:51:23,138
We'll soon find out. Come.

1437
01:51:26,266 --> 01:51:27,726
- GRIOT?
<i>- Yes, Princess.</i>

1438
01:51:27,810 --> 01:51:28,894
Print it.

1439
01:51:33,065 --> 01:51:34,775
How will we know if it works?

1440
01:51:35,567 --> 01:51:36,819
If it glows.

1441
01:51:51,875 --> 01:51:53,019
I mean, shouldn't we be

1442
01:51:53,043 --> 01:51:54,336
burning incense or something?

1443
01:51:54,962 --> 01:51:56,046
Only Bast knows

1444
01:51:56,129 --> 01:51:58,131
how the ancestors
will make it to this lab.

1445
01:52:08,475 --> 01:52:10,310
Are you sure you don't want me
to bury you?

1446
01:52:10,477 --> 01:52:11,478
No.

1447
01:52:12,062 --> 01:52:14,106
Need you to have access to my chest,

1448
01:52:14,273 --> 01:52:16,316
just in case I go through cardiac arrest.

1449
01:52:16,900 --> 01:52:18,443
"Cardiac arrest"?

1450
01:52:19,528 --> 01:52:20,571
She's joking,

1451
01:52:21,113 --> 01:52:22,364
right?

1452
01:52:23,532 --> 01:52:25,367
Right?

1453
01:52:30,330 --> 01:52:34,167
Allow this Heart-Shaped Herb

1454
01:52:34,543 --> 01:52:37,588
to give you the strength
of the Black Panther

1455
01:52:38,005 --> 01:52:40,424
and take you to the Ancestral Plane.

1456
01:53:59,711 --> 01:54:00,712
Mother?

1457
01:54:14,059 --> 01:54:15,310
N'Jadaka.

1458
01:54:15,894 --> 01:54:17,062
Lil' cousin.

1459
01:54:17,437 --> 01:54:18,438
How?

1460
01:54:18,522 --> 01:54:21,358
How is never as important as why, right?

1461
01:54:23,151 --> 01:54:24,403
You chose me.

1462
01:54:24,569 --> 01:54:27,447
Impossible.
I would never choose you.

1463
01:54:27,614 --> 01:54:29,282
Why did you take the Herb?

1464
01:54:30,283 --> 01:54:32,244
- To see my family.
- No, that's bullshit.

1465
01:54:33,203 --> 01:54:35,122
You didn't believe
the Ancestral Plane was real,

1466
01:54:35,205 --> 01:54:36,206
did you?

1467
01:54:39,334 --> 01:54:40,335
No.

1468
01:54:41,086 --> 01:54:42,337
So, why did you take it, then?

1469
01:54:44,047 --> 01:54:45,424
You don't have to lie to me.

1470
01:54:46,258 --> 01:54:47,759
So I can be strong.

1471
01:54:48,135 --> 01:54:49,636
Strong to do what?

1472
01:54:52,514 --> 01:54:53,515
See?

1473
01:54:55,058 --> 01:54:57,019
We're more alike than you think.

1474
01:54:58,937 --> 01:55:00,897
I took it to avenge my ancestors too.

1475
01:55:01,064 --> 01:55:02,232
I'm nothing like you.

1476
01:55:03,692 --> 01:55:05,444
You took it for yourself,

1477
01:55:05,610 --> 01:55:07,154
then destroyed the rest.

1478
01:55:08,655 --> 01:55:09,865
Unworthy king,

1479
01:55:10,699 --> 01:55:12,200
afraid of being replaced.

1480
01:55:13,285 --> 01:55:14,286
Just a coward.

1481
01:55:14,453 --> 01:55:15,454
No.

1482
01:55:15,537 --> 01:55:16,580
I had the courage to do

1483
01:55:16,663 --> 01:55:18,206
what was necessary to change Wakanda.

1484
01:55:19,624 --> 01:55:21,126
How many people like your scientist

1485
01:55:21,209 --> 01:55:23,587
did Wakanda protect
before I took the throne?

1486
01:55:24,629 --> 01:55:25,630
Cowards.

1487
01:55:25,797 --> 01:55:28,050
That was the Panthers
that came before me,

1488
01:55:29,134 --> 01:55:30,135
and before T'Challa.

1489
01:55:30,218 --> 01:55:32,054
Don't mention my brother.

1490
01:55:32,387 --> 01:55:34,056
You're the reason why he's dead.

1491
01:55:34,556 --> 01:55:37,809
You burnt the Herb,
left us with no protector.

1492
01:55:37,976 --> 01:55:40,228
Then Namor struck
and killed my mother.

1493
01:55:40,395 --> 01:55:42,230
Their blood is on your hands.

1494
01:55:43,398 --> 01:55:44,733
That ain't on me.

1495
01:55:45,275 --> 01:55:46,651
And don't you dare

1496
01:55:46,818 --> 01:55:48,653
take that away from your mother.

1497
01:55:48,820 --> 01:55:50,405
She sacrificed her life to protect

1498
01:55:50,489 --> 01:55:52,324
a young girl from the lost tribe.

1499
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:56,369
Your father, he was a hypocrite.

1500
01:55:57,871 --> 01:55:59,623
He would've killed that girl.

1501
01:56:00,332 --> 01:56:02,250
Shit, he killed his own brother.

1502
01:56:03,835 --> 01:56:06,505
T'Challa was too noble.

1503
01:56:08,673 --> 01:56:11,009
He let the man
who murdered your father live.

1504
01:56:13,136 --> 01:56:14,805
And here you stand.

1505
01:56:20,477 --> 01:56:22,604
Are you gonna be noble
like your brother

1506
01:56:22,771 --> 01:56:24,856
or take care of business...

1507
01:56:25,565 --> 01:56:26,691
like me?

1508
01:56:29,528 --> 01:56:30,529
Are you okay?

1509
01:56:36,409 --> 01:56:37,569
Who did you see?

1510
01:56:42,999 --> 01:56:44,000
No one.

1511
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:50,298
I failed.

1512
01:56:50,465 --> 01:56:52,592
- It didn't work.
- Hey, SHURI.

1513
01:56:55,720 --> 01:56:58,098
- They abandoned me.
- They would never do that.

1514
01:56:58,181 --> 01:56:59,724
I did everything
I was supposed to do.

1515
01:56:59,808 --> 01:57:01,643
- I re-created the Herb.
- Okay.

1516
01:57:01,726 --> 01:57:03,770
I just did your stupid ritual,
and for what?

1517
01:57:03,937 --> 01:57:05,480
- Relax.
- Why didn't they come for me?

1518
01:57:05,564 --> 01:57:06,690
Just relax.

1519
01:57:13,780 --> 01:57:15,073
Shit.

1520
01:57:19,411 --> 01:57:20,745
Can I get some of that too?

1521
01:57:28,170 --> 01:57:29,212
I think...

1522
01:57:30,755 --> 01:57:32,215
you're going to need a suit.

1523
01:58:03,830 --> 01:58:05,892
There are more
people coming from the city.

1524
01:58:05,916 --> 01:58:07,542
They need more space.

1525
01:58:07,709 --> 01:58:08,710
So what?

1526
01:58:09,586 --> 01:58:11,838
You are visitors.

1527
01:58:12,005 --> 01:58:15,217
It is a wonder how anything
gets done with you people.

1528
01:58:40,367 --> 01:58:42,661
The princess!

1529
01:59:16,194 --> 01:59:17,487
She has done it!

1530
01:59:18,196 --> 01:59:21,199
The Black Panther lives!

1531
01:59:39,050 --> 01:59:41,469
Namor believes Wakanda is on her knees.

1532
01:59:43,930 --> 01:59:45,390
Our Queen murdered.

1533
01:59:47,892 --> 01:59:49,436
Our capital destroyed.

1534
01:59:51,104 --> 01:59:52,939
He believes we have no protector.

1535
01:59:54,941 --> 01:59:55,942
But now...

1536
01:59:57,736 --> 01:59:59,738
now is our time to strike.

1537
01:59:59,904 --> 02:00:03,491
How, when we don't
even know how to find him?

1538
02:00:04,075 --> 02:00:05,785
We'll bring Namor to us.

1539
02:00:05,952 --> 02:00:07,495
- Here, again?
- No.

1540
02:00:07,662 --> 02:00:09,998
A distant location at sea.

1541
02:00:10,165 --> 02:00:11,583
All right.

1542
02:00:11,666 --> 02:00:13,126
Let's say this does work.

1543
02:00:14,419 --> 02:00:17,172
Hmm.
Assuming we can kill this man

1544
02:00:17,339 --> 02:00:20,383
who can fly and is potentially
as strong as the Hulk...

1545
02:00:23,136 --> 02:00:25,555
is murdering him the right solution?

1546
02:00:26,014 --> 02:00:27,974
You were calling for his head

1547
02:00:28,141 --> 02:00:30,477
when his only crime was intimidation.

1548
02:00:30,643 --> 02:00:32,437
What has changed, Lord M'BAKU?

1549
02:00:32,604 --> 02:00:33,813
His soldiers

1550
02:00:33,980 --> 02:00:35,690
did not call him General or King.

1551
02:00:35,774 --> 02:00:38,443
They called him K'uk'ulkan.

1552
02:00:38,610 --> 02:00:39,819
What is that?

1553
02:00:39,986 --> 02:00:42,113
The feather serpent god.

1554
02:00:42,697 --> 02:00:43,698
What?

1555
02:00:43,782 --> 02:00:45,822
Do you think because we are
living in the mountains,

1556
02:00:45,950 --> 02:00:47,827
we do not have access to books?

1557
02:00:48,078 --> 02:00:49,579
Elders,

1558
02:00:49,996 --> 02:00:51,373
with your permission,

1559
02:00:51,539 --> 02:00:55,251
I would like to talk
with Lord M'BAKU alone.

1560
02:01:05,387 --> 02:01:06,721
Namor's not finished.

1561
02:01:08,139 --> 02:01:11,226
He promised to destroy
the surface world.

1562
02:01:11,393 --> 02:01:13,728
Now is our opportunity to take him.

1563
02:01:13,895 --> 02:01:16,147
- What are you afraid of?
- War.

1564
02:01:16,564 --> 02:01:19,901
If Namor is indeed a god to his people,

1565
02:01:20,068 --> 02:01:22,695
killing him will risk eternal war.

1566
02:01:22,779 --> 02:01:23,947
And so what?

1567
02:01:24,489 --> 02:01:26,825
Was my mother's life
not worth eternal war?

1568
02:01:26,991 --> 02:01:28,368
Of course it was.

1569
02:01:29,369 --> 02:01:33,456
Of course she was.

1570
02:01:35,458 --> 02:01:38,670
But it is not what she would
have wanted for you.

1571
02:01:39,921 --> 02:01:40,922
Hmm?

1572
02:01:44,134 --> 02:01:45,844
And it is not what I want...

1573
02:01:48,471 --> 02:01:50,223
for my people.

1574
02:02:00,567 --> 02:02:03,611
You speak of my mother
as if she's still here.

1575
02:02:04,529 --> 02:02:06,531
Of what she would've wanted for me.

1576
02:02:07,615 --> 02:02:09,909
Her hopes and her dreams.

1577
02:02:13,079 --> 02:02:14,581
But she's dead.

1578
02:02:15,623 --> 02:02:16,624
She's gone!

1579
02:02:18,334 --> 02:02:22,213
Namor drowned her,
right in front of me!

1580
02:02:23,631 --> 02:02:24,924
So, her dreams,

1581
02:02:25,091 --> 02:02:28,178
her goals, her hopes for me...

1582
02:02:31,514 --> 02:02:32,765
it doesn't exist.

1583
02:02:35,477 --> 02:02:37,020
It doesn't matter anymore.

1584
02:02:39,105 --> 02:02:41,983
What matters is what I want,

1585
02:02:42,150 --> 02:02:44,861
and what I want is Namor dead!

1586
02:02:48,865 --> 02:02:50,533
And you're going to help me get it.

1587
02:03:06,799 --> 02:03:08,426
We leave in the morning.

1588
02:03:34,244 --> 02:03:35,245
Hi.

1589
02:03:35,411 --> 02:03:36,412
Good morning.

1590
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:40,250
If we survive this,

1591
02:03:41,918 --> 02:03:45,129
I want you to know you have
a home with me in Haiti.

1592
02:03:47,966 --> 02:03:50,301
Here.
Take my hands.

1593
02:03:58,977 --> 02:04:01,479
SHURI, I want you
to be honest with me.

1594
02:04:01,646 --> 02:04:04,691
Who did you see
when you took the Herb?

1595
02:04:09,862 --> 02:04:11,573
If you go to war for vengeance,

1596
02:04:11,656 --> 02:04:14,158
it will not fill the hole
left from her loss.

1597
02:04:14,742 --> 02:04:16,619
It will only grow larger,

1598
02:04:16,786 --> 02:04:18,246
and it will consume you.

1599
02:04:20,498 --> 02:04:21,874
It already has.

1600
02:05:51,255 --> 02:05:52,548
For the Queen.

1601
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:27,458
<i>Phambili!</i>

1602
02:07:06,622 --> 02:07:08,502
<i>Riri,
how's it going up there?</i>

1603
02:07:08,875 --> 02:07:10,155
Hey, Mr. GRIOT.

1604
02:07:10,209 --> 02:07:11,809
I could really use
that backup right now.

1605
02:07:11,836 --> 02:07:13,796
<i>I thought you'd never ask.</i>

1606
02:07:19,594 --> 02:07:20,595
<i>Shit.</i>

1607
02:07:25,057 --> 02:07:26,434
<i>Shit, he's fast.</i>

1608
02:07:27,101 --> 02:07:28,311
<i>But I'm faster.</i>

1609
02:07:33,941 --> 02:07:35,526
Whoo!

1610
02:07:48,289 --> 02:07:49,332
<i>Got you.</i>

1611
02:07:55,671 --> 02:07:57,006
<i>It's on you now, SHURI.</i>

1612
02:08:06,182 --> 02:08:07,558
- Princess.
- No.

1613
02:08:08,059 --> 02:08:11,562
I am the Black Panther,
and I'm here for retribution!

1614
02:08:12,230 --> 02:08:15,233
<i>pervaporation cells activated.</i>

1615
02:08:24,659 --> 02:08:25,660
What's wrong?

1616
02:08:26,410 --> 02:08:27,703
You need a glass of water?

1617
02:08:31,707 --> 02:08:33,417
- Yo, we got him.
- Good!

1618
02:08:33,501 --> 02:08:34,794
Namor has been captured.

1619
02:08:40,925 --> 02:08:42,426
Back to Wakanda!

1620
02:08:48,140 --> 02:08:49,141
Move out!

1621
02:09:14,208 --> 02:09:16,127
What is going on?

1622
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:18,087
The sonic emitter has been destroyed.

1623
02:09:40,318 --> 02:09:41,819
That can't be good.

1624
02:10:13,935 --> 02:10:16,103
<i>Panther, the
Sea Leopard has lost power,</i>

1625
02:10:16,187 --> 02:10:18,230
<i>and they are experiencing
significant casualties.</i>

1626
02:10:19,774 --> 02:10:20,775
OKOYE.

1627
02:10:20,942 --> 02:10:22,193
<i>Panther.</i>

1628
02:10:22,318 --> 02:10:23,319
<i>Phambili!</i>

1629
02:10:23,402 --> 02:10:24,403
Aneka.

1630
02:10:25,655 --> 02:10:26,656
OKOYE!

1631
02:10:26,739 --> 02:10:28,115
It is time.

1632
02:10:32,703 --> 02:10:34,223
Phambili!

1633
02:10:39,001 --> 02:10:40,044
For Wakanda!

1634
02:10:40,753 --> 02:10:41,963
Wakanda!

1635
02:10:50,304 --> 02:10:51,847
GRIOT, what's the damage?

1636
02:10:51,931 --> 02:10:52,932
<i>Catastrophic.</i>

1637
02:10:53,015 --> 02:10:54,415
<i>His spear is made of raw vibranium.</i>

1638
02:10:54,475 --> 02:10:55,915
<i>The ship could explode
at any second.</i>

1639
02:10:55,977 --> 02:10:56,978
Get us to the desert.

1640
02:11:15,788 --> 02:11:17,081
No!

1641
02:12:14,513 --> 02:12:15,574
I got you, sis.

1642
02:12:15,598 --> 02:12:16,682
<i>Hold on.</i>

1643
02:14:00,870 --> 02:14:02,079
<i>Get</i> Off me!

1644
02:14:14,133 --> 02:14:15,342
<i>All right, come here.</i>

1645
02:14:45,956 --> 02:14:47,756
May the ancestors save us

1646
02:14:47,791 --> 02:14:49,418
if the princess does not hurry.

1647
02:14:49,501 --> 02:14:51,212
We may be going to join them.

1648
02:14:52,129 --> 02:14:53,214
If so, hey,

1649
02:14:53,380 --> 02:14:55,633
let us take as many of them
with us as we can.

1650
02:15:25,746 --> 02:15:27,164
It could've been different.

1651
02:15:49,853 --> 02:15:51,206
Are you gonna <i>be noble</i>

1652
02:15:51,230 --> 02:15:52,231
<i>like your brother</i>

1653
02:15:52,314 --> 02:15:53,649
<i>or take care of business</i>

1654
02:15:53,816 --> 02:15:54,858
like me?

1655
02:15:55,025 --> 02:15:56,568
I'm not my brother.

1656
02:15:57,987 --> 02:15:59,989
Namor will beg me for mercy

1657
02:16:00,656 --> 02:16:03,200
as I stand and watch as he dies.

1658
02:16:46,660 --> 02:16:48,620
Wakanda forever!

1659
02:18:37,020 --> 02:18:38,522
SHURI.

1660
02:18:40,065 --> 02:18:41,066
Mama.

1661
02:18:44,027 --> 02:18:45,320
Show him

1662
02:18:45,696 --> 02:18:47,239
who you are.

1663
02:18:54,079 --> 02:18:55,080
Yield,

1664
02:18:56,290 --> 02:18:58,625
and Wakanda will protect your oceans.

1665
02:18:58,792 --> 02:19:01,044
We will protect your secrets.

1666
02:19:01,211 --> 02:19:02,212
Yield,

1667
02:19:03,464 --> 02:19:05,174
and your people will live.

1668
02:19:09,261 --> 02:19:11,597
Vengeance has consumed us.

1669
02:19:12,055 --> 02:19:14,683
We cannot let it consume our people.

1670
02:20:10,697 --> 02:20:12,574
Wakanda forever!

1671
02:20:13,033 --> 02:20:14,618
Wakanda forever!

1672
02:20:38,850 --> 02:20:40,477
<i>Oou Ie Ie oou Ie Ie oou le le.</i>

1673
02:20:43,855 --> 02:20:46,066
Oou le <i>le</i>

1674
02:20:50,028 --> 02:20:52,656
<i>Oou le le oou le le oou le le.</i>

1675
02:20:52,739 --> 02:20:57,160
<i>Oou oou

1676
02:20:57,244 --> 02:20:58,912
<i>Well, I pray that the universe.</i>

1677
02:20:58,996 --> 02:21:00,497
Thank you, my love.

1678
02:21:02,207 --> 02:21:04,876
<i>Gives you way more than you deserve.</i>

1679
02:21:06,962 --> 02:21:09,548
<i>When the tears fall
like shooting stars.</i>

1680
02:21:09,965 --> 02:21:11,800
<i>Remember who you are.</i>

1681
02:21:12,509 --> 02:21:16,346
<i>Just look up to the sky You'll see.</i>

1682
02:21:16,430 --> 02:21:19,224
<i>Well, I pray that the universe.</i>

1683
02:21:21,393 --> 02:21:24,229
<i>Gives you way more than you deserve</i>

1684
02:21:24,313 --> 02:21:25,480
YO.

1685
02:21:28,984 --> 02:21:31,111
All set to head home?

1686
02:21:31,194 --> 02:21:32,338
As long as you're sure the police

1687
02:21:32,362 --> 02:21:33,882
won't be waiting for me
at the airport.

1688
02:21:33,989 --> 02:21:35,616
Don't worry.
Took care of that.

1689
02:21:35,782 --> 02:21:37,075
But you might want to slow down

1690
02:21:37,159 --> 02:21:39,411
on your homework-for-hire business.

1691
02:21:39,494 --> 02:21:41,872
Get caught slipping,
I can't help you with that.

1692
02:21:43,165 --> 02:21:45,143
They said you wanted
to talk to me about something?

1693
02:21:45,167 --> 02:21:46,168
Yes.

1694
02:21:46,501 --> 02:21:49,713
Your suit.
It's a great design,

1695
02:21:50,255 --> 02:21:51,535
but can't let you leave with it.

1696
02:21:51,673 --> 02:21:52,883
It's all good.

1697
02:21:52,966 --> 02:21:54,259
Figured the least I could do

1698
02:21:54,343 --> 02:21:56,011
is help Wakanda clean up my mess.

1699
02:21:57,262 --> 02:21:58,764
I have one more thing to show you.

1700
02:21:59,181 --> 02:22:00,182
Come.

1701
02:22:04,186 --> 02:22:07,272
Took me a while to find
all the parts from the river,

1702
02:22:07,439 --> 02:22:08,815
but it was worth it.

1703
02:22:09,483 --> 02:22:10,484
How did you...

1704
02:22:11,818 --> 02:22:13,362
It's my dad's car.

1705
02:22:14,613 --> 02:22:16,323
We used to work on it before...

1706
02:22:16,406 --> 02:22:18,992
<i>Oou le le oou le le oou le le</i>

1707
02:22:19,076 --> 02:22:21,161
<i>I'm coming back for you.</i>

1708
02:22:22,287 --> 02:22:24,164
- You sure this is her?
- Every part.

1709
02:22:24,331 --> 02:22:25,791
Have it shipped to Boston.

1710
02:22:25,957 --> 02:22:27,250
Be there before you arrive.

1711
02:22:32,798 --> 02:22:33,799
Bring it in, man.

1712
02:22:37,386 --> 02:22:41,682
<i>Panther, Miss Williams'
transport has arrived.</i>

1713
02:22:42,307 --> 02:22:43,850
Look after yourself.

1714
02:22:44,184 --> 02:22:46,603
Sure you're not trying
to slide to Chicago?

1715
02:22:46,770 --> 02:22:47,854
Catch a Bulls game?

1716
02:22:49,106 --> 02:22:50,649
Sounds fun,

1717
02:22:50,732 --> 02:22:53,568
but I have something
I need to take care of.

1718
02:23:18,301 --> 02:23:20,762
And now I present to you.

1719
02:23:20,929 --> 02:23:22,097
Princess SHURI,

1720
02:23:22,264 --> 02:23:23,557
the Black Panther!

1721
02:23:42,033 --> 02:23:44,870
The Black Panther sends her regards,

1722
02:23:45,662 --> 02:23:47,664
but she will not be joining us today.

1723
02:23:48,790 --> 02:23:50,751
I, M'BAKU,

1724
02:23:50,917 --> 02:23:53,462
leader of the Jabari Tribe,

1725
02:23:53,628 --> 02:23:55,088
son of Wakanda,

1726
02:23:56,590 --> 02:23:58,341
wish to challenge

1727
02:23:59,426 --> 02:24:00,594
for the throne.

1728
02:25:32,394 --> 02:25:33,788
What the hell is this?

1729
02:25:33,812 --> 02:25:36,231
Can we turn around?

1730
02:25:36,648 --> 02:25:38,608
I don't know, man.
We'll lose an hour.

1731
02:25:40,026 --> 02:25:41,444
Why don't you go check it out?

1732
02:25:41,528 --> 02:25:42,821
Okay.

1733
02:25:45,615 --> 02:25:46,908
Yeah, this is Shauver.

1734
02:25:47,325 --> 02:25:49,327
Yeah, looks like we got
a tree blocking our way.

1735
02:25:49,494 --> 02:25:51,204
How do you want us to proceed?

1736
02:25:51,288 --> 02:25:52,747
What the...

1737
02:26:03,383 --> 02:26:04,676
Ah!

1738
02:26:04,759 --> 02:26:07,095
A colonizer in chains.

1739
02:26:07,762 --> 02:26:09,806
Now I have seen everything.

1740
02:26:09,890 --> 02:26:11,016
Funny.

1741
02:26:35,749 --> 02:26:36,750
<i>Merci.</i>

1742
02:26:46,676 --> 02:26:47,677
Hey.

1743
02:26:52,349 --> 02:26:53,767
It's good to see you.

1744
02:26:54,517 --> 02:26:55,727
Everything is ready.

1745
02:26:55,894 --> 02:26:57,270
Just give me one moment, eh?

1746
02:26:57,437 --> 02:26:58,772
Actually,

1747
02:26:58,939 --> 02:27:00,815
I think I should do it on my own.

1748
02:27:02,025 --> 02:27:03,401
Of course.

1749
02:31:38,426 --> 02:31:39,427
SHURI,

1750
02:31:40,762 --> 02:31:42,472
can we join you now?

1751
02:31:45,558 --> 02:31:48,603
This is my son, Toussaint.

1752
02:31:49,771 --> 02:31:50,772
Toussaint,

1753
02:31:51,439 --> 02:31:54,567
this is your aunty, SHURI.

1754
02:31:55,985 --> 02:31:56,986
Hi.

1755
02:32:17,924 --> 02:32:20,593
We agreed it was better
for him to grow up here.

1756
02:32:20,760 --> 02:32:23,846
Away from the pressure of the throne.

1757
02:32:25,223 --> 02:32:26,432
Your father,

1758
02:32:27,058 --> 02:32:28,810
your <i>baba,</i>

1759
02:32:28,977 --> 02:32:31,646
prepared us for his death,
didn't he?

1760
02:32:36,317 --> 02:32:38,361
But he didn't want us
to go to the funeral

1761
02:32:39,195 --> 02:32:42,115
because he felt the time
was not yet right.

1762
02:32:42,824 --> 02:32:45,618
So we had our own ceremony
for him here.

1763
02:32:47,370 --> 02:32:48,955
Did my mother meet him?

1764
02:32:49,038 --> 02:32:50,039
She did.

1765
02:32:59,632 --> 02:33:00,758
It's nice to meet you.

1766
02:33:00,842 --> 02:33:02,135
Nice to meet you.

1767
02:33:02,302 --> 02:33:03,845
Toussaint is a beautiful name.

1768
02:33:04,345 --> 02:33:06,472
It holds a great history.

1769
02:33:06,639 --> 02:33:09,934
Thanks. Yours is cool, too,
I guess.

1770
02:33:13,229 --> 02:33:15,398
My mom says you are good
at keeping secrets.

1771
02:33:15,481 --> 02:33:16,482
Is that true?

1772
02:33:17,734 --> 02:33:20,528
Yes, I can keep a good secret.

1773
02:33:23,531 --> 02:33:25,825
Toussaint is my Haitian name.

1774
02:33:30,872 --> 02:33:33,082
My name is Prince T'Challa,

1775
02:33:33,166 --> 02:33:35,084
son of King T'Challa.
