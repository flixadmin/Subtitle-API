00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:19,262
"The Tsunami colony in Chennai's Ennore
region was impacted around 11.30 PM..."

3
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:22,387
"...last night, by an asteroid."

4
00:05:22,512 --> 00:05:27,387
"At least fourteen people were killed..."

5
00:05:27,512 --> 00:05:33,012
"...and more than 35 people admitted
to the hospital with serious injuries."

6
00:05:33,137 --> 00:05:36,262
"A team of meteorologists surveyed
the impact zone..."

7
00:05:36,387 --> 00:05:39,304
"...and have sent samples of the asteroid
to the research center."

8
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:42,678
"Only after thorough analysis,
can more be known about this asteroid."

9
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,596
Munnar, Kerala.

10
00:05:58,429 --> 00:06:01,845
The information which I'm about to share
does not leave this room.

11
00:06:02,887 --> 00:06:07,554
You are all aware of the asteroid
which struck Chennai two days ago.

12
00:06:07,678 --> 00:06:09,179
As per our calculations...

13
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:12,387
...we will be struck by another asteroid
in seven days.

14
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,053
It will slam into the Bay of Bengal,
50 kilometers away from Chennai.

15
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,262
The asteroid which struck two days ago,
measures eight square feet.

16
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:28,470
This one, measures 60 square kilometers.

17
00:06:29,512 --> 00:06:31,304
Larger than the city of Chennai.

18
00:06:31,429 --> 00:06:33,470
If it strikes the Bay of Bengal...

19
00:06:33,596 --> 00:06:38,887
...Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Sri Lanka
would witness a devastating tsunami.

20
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:45,304
The resulting tremors would bring down
many buildings.

21
00:06:46,596 --> 00:06:49,845
It will change India's very topography.

22
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,970
I suggest we evacuate everyone
and move them to a neighboring state.

23
00:06:56,095 --> 00:06:59,512
Moving a population of 80 million
would take a month...

24
00:06:59,637 --> 00:07:03,720
...even if we deploy our rail, road
or air services.

25
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:07,179
It would take a week to source
the fuel for this mission.

26
00:07:07,304 --> 00:07:10,220
Not only that.
If this news reaches the public...

27
00:07:10,345 --> 00:07:12,970
...imagine the problems
that would stem from mass panic.

28
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:16,012
How many lives would be lost?

29
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,887
It would be devastating.

30
00:07:20,012 --> 00:07:22,012
Forty million people will lose their lives.

31
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:29,220
Do you want us to be mute spectators
while people die?

32
00:07:29,345 --> 00:07:31,220
We're not here to sit and watch.

33
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:40,928
We will not tolerate any attack
on India.

34
00:07:43,554 --> 00:07:45,596
Here is the surface map of the asteroid.

35
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:51,429
The rear of the asteroid
has a crater.

36
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:57,887
It seems like a well and runs deep
into the center of the asteroid.

37
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,429
This is its weakest point.

38
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:05,137
A nuclear blast in the crater...

39
00:08:05,262 --> 00:08:08,678
...would blow it in two
and deflect it away from Earth.

40
00:08:08,803 --> 00:08:10,137
This is the safety line.

41
00:08:10,262 --> 00:08:14,387
We need to blast the asteroid
before it crosses the safety line...

42
00:08:14,512 --> 00:08:16,928
...to deflect it away from earth.

43
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:25,720
There is no use blasting the asteroid
once it crosses the safety line.

44
00:08:28,512 --> 00:08:31,387
We have six days before it crosses
the safety line.

45
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:38,304
Is it possible for us to launch a rocket,
within six days, without raising suspicion?

46
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,429
Possible, Chief!

47
00:08:39,554 --> 00:08:43,512
We can announce it to the public
as a satellite maintenance program.

48
00:08:43,637 --> 00:08:46,345
News about rocket launches
is pretty common these days.

49
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:50,845
The blast calculations are precise.

50
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,137
But there is one problem!

51
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:57,387
We don't have such a powerful missile.

52
00:08:57,512 --> 00:08:59,095
Nor does any country.

53
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,637
All the countries signed a peace treaty
last year at the United Nations.

54
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:09,720
Per the treaty, production of nukes
more than 20 kilotons is prohibited.

55
00:09:09,845 --> 00:09:13,053
We will need a 200 kiloton nuke
to blast this asteroid.

56
00:09:19,637 --> 00:09:22,678
I need permission
to speak off the record, sir .

57
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:28,095
A few countries have sourced nukes
from black markets owing to war.

58
00:09:29,137 --> 00:09:32,637
Given our situation,
can we consider that alternative?

59
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:35,887
Do we need to source it from the
black markets? Like terrorists?

60
00:09:36,012 --> 00:09:37,637
I need some time to think about this.

61
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:52,845
Istanbul, Turkey.

62
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,012
Please trace this identification number.

63
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,095
If you have really placed this call
through this ID...

64
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,387
...I will have to close my business
and go under the radar.

65
00:10:10,512 --> 00:10:12,429
We called to talk business.

66
00:10:14,845 --> 00:10:16,345
Give me the list.

67
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,095
Just one item.

68
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,262
200 kiloton nuclear missile.

69
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:21,887
Do you know what you are asking for?

70
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:24,887
Do you know who you are speaking to?

71
00:10:25,012 --> 00:10:27,637
With a 200 kiloton nuke,
we can wipe out an entire country.

72
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,137
No black market will have it.

73
00:10:30,678 --> 00:10:32,137
Then we don't need you at all.

74
00:10:33,137 --> 00:10:37,012
Cut the call, shut down your network
and pack up.

75
00:10:38,678 --> 00:10:41,761
There is one place
where you can source it from.

76
00:10:43,053 --> 00:10:46,304
This country has kept a 200 kiloton missile
under wraps.

77
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:52,220
How do we verify
if the information is true?

78
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:54,761
I will send you all the details.

79
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,970
You will know once you see it.

80
00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:10,262
Can we seek help from them
through the Indian embassy?

81
00:11:10,387 --> 00:11:12,095
No.

82
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,596
That would go against the treaty.
They won't go on record and admit it.

83
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,512
Other countries will impose sanctions
on them if the truth comes out.

84
00:11:20,637 --> 00:11:23,720
If we can't speak to them,
what are our alternatives, Chief?

85
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:26,095
There is only one way.

86
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,512
Now, allow me to speak off the record.

87
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:35,053
This is a secret mission.

88
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:41,220
The report will be sent only to the Home,
Defence Depts. and the Prime Minister.

89
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:44,596
We need to steal the missile.

90
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,720
Stealing the weapons of another country,
could lead to war.

91
00:11:56,387 --> 00:11:57,387
No.

92
00:11:57,928 --> 00:11:59,970
Their possession of the weapon
is illegal.

93
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,345
They won’t be even able to report
it missing.

94
00:12:04,761 --> 00:12:07,761
Stealing the missile is no easy task.

95
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:09,887
Because the missile isn't in their country.

96
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:15,928
It's been strategically placed to attack
any corner of the world.

97
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:18,179
In space!

98
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:29,928
It is under the guise
of a research centre.

99
00:12:32,387 --> 00:12:34,095
But it is a military base.

100
00:12:36,596 --> 00:12:39,470
Knowing that wars of the future
are to be waged in space...

101
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:41,554
...they have taken this drastic step.

102
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,470
The missile is housed in a secured vault.

103
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:52,179
It is impossible to breach the alarm system
and gain entry.

104
00:12:56,387 --> 00:13:01,053
Even if one does gain entry,
an army of soldiers will block the exit.

105
00:13:02,928 --> 00:13:07,928
Our team isn't equipped
to crack such vaults and gain entry.

106
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:11,095
We can't rely on our team alone
to gain entry into the vault.

107
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,053
We need an expert.

108
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:18,928
To help us break the vault...

109
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:20,845
...we are going to employ a thief.

110
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,345
How can we trust an outsider
while handling such a sensitive issue?

111
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,678
A thief, no less!

112
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,304
Let me ask you a question.

113
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:38,845
To save 40 million lives,
I'm passing an order, to steal the missile.

114
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:41,470
Does anybody have any objection?

115
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:47,803
We will execute your order
without any questions.

116
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:10,887
Get me the most talented thief out there!

117
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,887
"Tik. Tik. Tik."

118
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:32,845
Chennai, Tamil Nadu.

119
00:15:42,512 --> 00:15:46,470
Oblivious to what's happening up there,
they are fighting over frivolous issues.

120
00:15:46,596 --> 00:15:48,345
Based on the five cases we saw...

121
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,928
...I am sure
they will be reduced to ashes in a week.

122
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:54,512
There's no thief on Earth,
that matches our Chief's expectations.

123
00:15:56,678 --> 00:15:59,262
His name is Vasu.
A very dangerous man.

124
00:15:59,387 --> 00:16:02,429
That is why we have jailed him
in isolation.

125
00:16:02,554 --> 00:16:03,554
Great!

126
00:16:03,678 --> 00:16:06,554
Is he that dangerous?
-He is an expert magician!

127
00:16:07,596 --> 00:16:10,554
Once he managed to get out of the cell!

128
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,928
The doors were locked. Bars weren't bent.
But he was outside the cell.

129
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,137
Why do you all want to meet Vasu?

130
00:16:18,262 --> 00:16:19,761
To save the country!

131
00:17:13,637 --> 00:17:15,429
He has the nerves to insult the Chief!

132
00:17:15,554 --> 00:17:18,179
It's a one side mirror.
He can't see us.

133
00:17:23,512 --> 00:17:24,554
Vasudevan.

134
00:17:25,554 --> 00:17:28,345
You need to be careful
while dealing with Vasu.

135
00:17:31,387 --> 00:17:33,596
He can practically break in to any place.

136
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,596
He can escape from any situation.

137
00:17:36,596 --> 00:17:41,304
Initially, he used his skills to help a few
and perform some magic shows.

138
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:45,387
Later, he started targeting people
who had amassed wealth illegally.

139
00:17:49,637 --> 00:17:55,637
We are all aware of the recent twin murder
involving a minister's son.

140
00:17:55,761 --> 00:18:00,596
But they tried to frame the son
of this old man who works at their house.

141
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,220
The weapon used was hidden away
in the police evidence room.

142
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,470
Six months ago.

143
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:12,053
It conked out this morning!

144
00:18:18,387 --> 00:18:21,512
They stopped producing these,
even before I was born!

145
00:18:21,637 --> 00:18:23,095
Do you still use these things?

146
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,429
Get it replaced!

147
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:32,429
Poker!

148
00:18:32,554 --> 00:18:34,179
Dude, we are in!

149
00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:09,845
She was the one who beat me up, sir!

150
00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:17,761
Which station?
-Ayanavaram!

151
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,387
Please sign here.

152
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,053
You may go!

153
00:19:59,512 --> 00:20:01,845
Why did you allow a cop
from another station inside?

154
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:02,970
Sir, the thing is...

155
00:20:03,095 --> 00:20:05,095
Did you verify in the system?
-Yes, sir!

156
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,304
No one must exit the station!
-Yes, sir!

157
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:25,137
Close the gates!
Don't let anyone out!

158
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,012
We shouldn't let him escape.

159
00:21:15,137 --> 00:21:16,137
Search him!

160
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
Check his pockets.

161
00:21:29,345 --> 00:21:30,429
Search him thoroughly!

162
00:21:58,596 --> 00:22:02,345
All done, sir. He doesn't have a gun.
-What? Where is it then?

163
00:22:11,512 --> 00:22:12,512
Here, sir!

164
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:17,137
I searched him thoroughly.
-Keep him here until we find the gun.

165
00:22:29,387 --> 00:22:31,345
The gun has been produced
in court, sir!

166
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,729
You shouldn't have played
with police.

167
00:22:45,543 --> 00:22:50,334
The evidence in this box is against
a gang, that deal with illegal explosives.

168
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:52,585
For coming in and burning them...

169
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:56,084
...you can be jailed without trial
under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

170
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,126
For how many years?
-At least five.

171
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:10,918
You went to save my son...

172
00:23:11,043 --> 00:23:13,334
...but now, you're separated from yours!

173
00:23:15,209 --> 00:23:18,585
Compared to doing nothing
while being aware of your bad situation...

174
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,418
...this isn't that big a sentence.

175
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:25,459
Dad...

176
00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:32,918
His only weakness...

177
00:23:33,585 --> 00:23:35,043
...is his son, Ravi.

178
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:39,876
You can control him
only by exploiting this.

179
00:23:45,084 --> 00:23:47,668
'O scamp!'

180
00:23:50,459 --> 00:23:52,835
'My dear scamp!'

181
00:23:55,876 --> 00:23:58,418
'O scamp!'

182
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:03,751
'My dear scamp!'

183
00:24:18,126 --> 00:24:23,084
'I grew shorter, because of you.
I drew in the sand, because of you.'

184
00:24:23,209 --> 00:24:26,710
'I melted in the sea, because of you!'

185
00:24:28,793 --> 00:24:34,043
'I spread as wings, because of you.
I flew on ground, because of you.'

186
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:37,585
'My life filled with hue,
because of you!'

187
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:44,459
'A crayon broken into two
for me and you.'

188
00:24:44,585 --> 00:24:49,668
'A packet of chips,
together we tore and chomped away.'

189
00:24:49,793 --> 00:24:51,751
'Chomped away to oblivion!'

190
00:24:51,876 --> 00:24:53,293
'O scamp!'

191
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,084
'You are my whole world!'

192
00:24:57,209 --> 00:24:59,126
'My dear scamp!'

193
00:25:00,126 --> 00:25:02,376
'You are my life!'

194
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,459
'O scamp!'

195
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:07,793
'You are my whole world!'

196
00:25:07,918 --> 00:25:09,626
'My dear scamp!'

197
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,084
'You are my life!'

198
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:51,293
'Across the stars in the skies,
all I see are your eyes.'

199
00:25:51,418 --> 00:25:55,710
'I will bring the moon to your feet!'

200
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:01,960
'Should a thousand victories come by,
I shall accept with a smile.'

201
00:26:02,084 --> 00:26:05,376
'Only to you, will I ever lose!'

202
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:11,751
'When it's time to celebrate,
beautiful, the world does seem!'

203
00:26:11,876 --> 00:26:17,084
'When it's time for homework,
blood pressure soars extreme!'

204
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:22,084
'Don't I know from where springs
your naughty gene?'

205
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:28,002
'O scamp!'

206
00:26:28,126 --> 00:26:30,376
'You are my whole world!'

207
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:33,293
'My dear scamp!'

208
00:26:33,418 --> 00:26:35,751
'You are my life!'

209
00:26:35,876 --> 00:26:38,668
'O scamp!'

210
00:26:38,793 --> 00:26:40,960
'You are my whole world!'

211
00:26:41,084 --> 00:26:44,043
'My dear scamp!'

212
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:46,376
'You are my life!'

213
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:52,585
'I speak gibberish, because of you.'
'I dream in cartoons, because of you.'

214
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,334
'I became a loony, because of you!'

215
00:26:58,126 --> 00:27:00,668
'I lived one amongst the ants,
a days few.

216
00:27:00,793 --> 00:27:03,251
'I lived as a dog and a cat,
a days few.'

217
00:27:03,376 --> 00:27:06,334
'I turned a human,
because of you!'

218
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:12,002
'As a wonder,
you came into my life...'

219
00:27:12,126 --> 00:27:14,002
'...and warmed my heart.'

220
00:27:14,126 --> 00:27:17,418
'You bestowed on me,
the title of a "father"...'

221
00:27:17,543 --> 00:27:19,126
'...and made me raise my head high!'

222
00:27:19,251 --> 00:27:21,167
'Raise my head high!'

223
00:27:21,293 --> 00:27:23,918
'O scamp!'

224
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:26,334
'You are my whole world!'

225
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:29,251
'My dear scamp!'

226
00:27:29,376 --> 00:27:31,668
'You are my life!'

227
00:27:31,793 --> 00:27:34,668
'O scamp!'

228
00:27:34,793 --> 00:27:36,960
'You are my lifeblood!'

229
00:27:37,084 --> 00:27:40,002
'My dear scamp!'

230
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:42,293
'You are my dawn!'

231
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,626
He is Vasu's son.
You can go see Vasu first.

232
00:28:11,668 --> 00:28:13,209
Let the kid go ahead.
-Yes, sir.

233
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,751
Your son is here to see you.

234
00:28:23,876 --> 00:28:25,002
I'll send him in.

235
00:28:25,126 --> 00:28:26,459
In here?

236
00:28:26,585 --> 00:28:28,293
We usually meet in the visiting area.

237
00:28:28,418 --> 00:28:31,418
If you want to see him here, do it.
If not, I'll send him away.

238
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,626
He'd be anticipating this.
I'll see him here.

239
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:35,793
Can you take off these cuffs, please?

240
00:28:35,918 --> 00:28:37,334
Let him not see me with these.

241
00:28:38,002 --> 00:28:41,167
When you come in here,
forget about your dignity!

242
00:28:41,293 --> 00:28:44,626
This is how you will see him.
If you don't want to, I'll send him away!

243
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:54,126
How did you take them off?

244
00:28:54,251 --> 00:28:55,334
Hey!
Release me!

245
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,459
Let the Chief see
what kind of person he is.

246
00:28:58,585 --> 00:29:01,418
Someone might see this!
I'll be ruined on my first day here!

247
00:29:01,543 --> 00:29:03,251
I beg of you!
Let me loose!

248
00:29:03,376 --> 00:29:06,668
Isn't it a rule to not have inmates
in cuffs during visiting hours?

249
00:29:06,793 --> 00:29:09,543
Rather than doing that,
why this needless mockery?

250
00:29:09,668 --> 00:29:11,668
Want to see your son?
Do so without cuffs!

251
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:13,418
I'll even give you the keys. Take it!

252
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:24,043
He has no discipline!

253
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:25,793
He behaves like a rogue!

254
00:29:27,293 --> 00:29:28,293
Dad!

255
00:29:31,626 --> 00:29:32,710
Ravi!

256
00:29:32,835 --> 00:29:33,835
Dad!

257
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,043
What is it?

258
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:38,293
Look in your pocket!

259
00:29:49,376 --> 00:29:51,376
Having a hard time
staying in this room, dad?

260
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:54,876
Who told you that
your father's just stuck in here?

261
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,543
Abracadabra!

262
00:30:00,459 --> 00:30:02,418
All the cops
are your dad's friends!

263
00:30:02,543 --> 00:30:04,793
Then tell them to send you home!

264
00:30:04,918 --> 00:30:06,876
I'll be home in a few days.

265
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:08,626
Look in your pocket, dad.

266
00:30:11,334 --> 00:30:13,501
Playing my game with me, eh?
-Yeah!

267
00:30:16,126 --> 00:30:17,251
Dad...

268
00:30:17,376 --> 00:30:20,043
Visiting time's up.
That's enough sweet talk for now.

269
00:30:20,835 --> 00:30:22,002
Come along!
-Dad!

270
00:30:22,126 --> 00:30:23,543
A little more time, please...

271
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:27,167
Dad!

272
00:30:28,084 --> 00:30:29,209
Don't be afraid!

273
00:30:48,793 --> 00:30:50,793
He can't follow a single rule, Chief!

274
00:30:51,835 --> 00:30:53,835
But he's a good man.

275
00:31:03,918 --> 00:31:05,626
I have your release order
in my hands.

276
00:31:06,043 --> 00:31:09,793
With the special powers of the Indian Army,
your criminal record is cleared.

277
00:31:10,543 --> 00:31:12,376
Please step outside.
-Yes, sir.

278
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:19,334
Per this order, if you wish to be released,
you must do what we say.

279
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,668
You must steal something
from a high security vault.

280
00:31:28,543 --> 00:31:31,960
I'm ready to do anything,
if I can be with my son again.

281
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:37,084
If I have my team,
I can break into any vault.

282
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,251
Ritchie Street, Chennai.

283
00:31:52,918 --> 00:31:54,334
Third empire's decision, man!

284
00:31:58,459 --> 00:31:59,626
Confirmed not-out!

285
00:32:00,626 --> 00:32:01,626
Let's see.

286
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,251
Saw the third umpire's decision, yes?
March back to the dressing room!

287
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,751
Damn it, Billy!

288
00:32:45,293 --> 00:32:47,376
What did you do?
The army's here for you!

289
00:32:47,501 --> 00:32:48,668
Army?
Hey!

290
00:32:48,793 --> 00:32:50,835
How did they hear about this so fast?
-Army?

291
00:33:00,209 --> 00:33:01,209
Hey Venkat!

292
00:33:10,918 --> 00:33:13,585
Let go of me, sir!
They declared it not-out, didn't they?

293
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,793
Where is your partner?

294
00:33:27,459 --> 00:33:28,459
Bloody prick!

295
00:33:32,918 --> 00:33:36,626
They wrongly declared Chief Dhoni out
by LBW, last time. That's why I did it.

296
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:05,793
Under the POTA act,
I think they'll make us hang by the neck.

297
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,334
Hey!
What are you saying, man?

298
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:17,002
What is this, bro?
The army guys caught you, too?

299
00:34:18,002 --> 00:34:19,710
I made them bring you here.

300
00:34:19,835 --> 00:34:20,960
You?

301
00:34:21,084 --> 00:34:24,126
Are we getting the President's Award
as a reward for our service?

302
00:34:24,251 --> 00:34:25,710
Why do you think they called us?

303
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,418
To steal some object,
they released me from prison.

304
00:34:30,543 --> 00:34:31,543
What object?

305
00:34:32,251 --> 00:34:34,043
Steal what?
-What is this?

306
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:35,918
It's like the mirror from "Bigg Boss".

307
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:50,543
You've been released under the provisions
of Armed Forces Special Power Act, 1958.

308
00:34:51,543 --> 00:34:53,251
So even the military needs our help!

309
00:34:54,002 --> 00:34:56,668
How did they get that tablet?
-I don't know, Colonel.

310
00:34:56,793 --> 00:34:58,501
We thoroughly searched them.

311
00:34:58,626 --> 00:35:00,459
Did you ask for 50% share
of the loot?

312
00:35:00,585 --> 00:35:04,334
When that military girl stated her terms,
all I thought of, was to get out of jail.

313
00:35:04,459 --> 00:35:06,043
A military girl?

314
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:08,793
What's she like?
-Not hot, but above average.

315
00:35:11,167 --> 00:35:12,668
If anyone's a threat, it's them!

316
00:35:12,793 --> 00:35:14,585
It's okay even if I don't get a share.

317
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,501
But at 7 PM, my hands start trembling!

318
00:35:16,626 --> 00:35:19,002
Can I get some free rum
from the military?

319
00:35:19,126 --> 00:35:20,543
Hey!

320
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:21,918
What the hell, man?

321
00:35:22,043 --> 00:35:24,543
That... is guaranteed.
-Totally!

322
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,418
We're supposed to rely on these clowns?

323
00:35:33,002 --> 00:35:36,209
I'm sorry, Chief.
But I think we're better off without them.

324
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:37,710
Let's avoid this, Chief.

325
00:35:39,334 --> 00:35:40,376
We'll give them a test.

326
00:35:41,418 --> 00:35:42,793
And then take a decision.

327
00:35:42,918 --> 00:35:44,376
Give them a very hard test.

328
00:35:44,501 --> 00:35:47,002
If not, they might come along
and ruin this mission.

329
00:35:47,126 --> 00:35:50,002
Even in such a big mirror,
I can't see you completely!

330
00:35:51,043 --> 00:35:52,043
What a figure!

331
00:35:59,543 --> 00:36:02,334
Thought he'd give them a test,
but he's giving us one!

332
00:36:02,459 --> 00:36:04,293
We shouldn't lose in front of them!

333
00:36:06,418 --> 00:36:09,585
This vault is made of
the world's strongest titanium.

334
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,209
Your task is to open it.

335
00:36:12,334 --> 00:36:14,376
For that, you can use
any of this equipment.

336
00:36:18,084 --> 00:36:20,002
But, your time to finish it...

337
00:36:20,876 --> 00:36:22,002
...is just two minutes.

338
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,126
You have one more minute.

339
00:37:02,126 --> 00:37:03,459
Get those explosive sticks!

340
00:37:10,126 --> 00:37:12,334
What is this?
Decoration for "Ayudha Pooja"?

341
00:37:12,459 --> 00:37:13,501
Don't ridicule them.

342
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:37,043
You have the same rules and regulations.

343
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:38,960
You can use
any of this equipment.

344
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,918
Go on, man.
They're getting pissed off!

345
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,876
We should've used more powerful sticks.

346
00:38:26,002 --> 00:38:27,585
Two of them...
-That's what I took.

347
00:39:00,002 --> 00:39:01,501
Now do you get it?

348
00:39:01,626 --> 00:39:03,167
Now do you get why we need him?

349
00:39:03,293 --> 00:39:05,876
Give them the necessary training.
-Yes, Chief!

350
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:30,751
It has crossed Triplicane!

351
00:39:30,876 --> 00:39:34,626
Washermanpet. Chinthatharipet.
Ritchie Street. Our hood is finished?

352
00:39:35,793 --> 00:39:37,043
Worried about our "hood"?

353
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,751
It's crossing Villupuram, man!

354
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,418
You make it sound like a bus route!

355
00:39:41,876 --> 00:39:44,209
My uncle lives in Thanjavur.
No sea there, right?

356
00:39:44,334 --> 00:39:45,334
Quiet!

357
00:39:47,002 --> 00:39:48,876
You talked about stealing some object.

358
00:39:49,002 --> 00:39:50,418
Won't you tell us what it is?

359
00:39:51,293 --> 00:39:53,793
I'm learning about this for the first time,
right now!

360
00:39:54,876 --> 00:39:56,209
In space...

361
00:39:56,334 --> 00:39:58,585
...there is no gravitational energy.

362
00:39:59,668 --> 00:40:00,876
There is no air.

363
00:40:01,002 --> 00:40:03,501
The faintest sound cannot travel.
You can't hear it.

364
00:40:04,501 --> 00:40:08,668
If you leave the spaceship
without wearing this suit...

365
00:40:08,793 --> 00:40:10,543
...your bodies will explode.

366
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:13,960
If you remove these gloves
or helmet...

367
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,876
...or even a small scratch
appears on it...

368
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:18,918
...instant death.

369
00:40:24,793 --> 00:40:26,876
Why does it say "Made in India"?

370
00:40:27,002 --> 00:40:30,334
In this mission, every bit of technology
is Indian made.

371
00:40:30,459 --> 00:40:32,002
So everything is indigenous?

372
00:40:32,126 --> 00:40:34,793
Hollywood has the best space stuff.
Our stuff won't fly.

373
00:40:34,918 --> 00:40:36,626
This is a mission of the Indian Army!

374
00:40:36,751 --> 00:40:38,334
Least from now, try to be patriotic!

375
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:39,543
Patriotism, huh?

376
00:40:39,668 --> 00:40:41,668
How many of you use Indian made phones?

377
00:40:46,501 --> 00:40:48,960
Even for inexpensive phones,
we trust nothing local.

378
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,501
And you want us to stake our lives?

379
00:40:51,626 --> 00:40:53,543
If you have any serious questions,
ask me!

380
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:55,251
If not, go and pig out!

381
00:40:55,376 --> 00:40:56,626
One small doubt.

382
00:40:56,751 --> 00:40:59,918
While wearing this outfit,
what do we do if we want to pee?

383
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:02,960
He asked me to ask you!
-As if you never pee!

384
00:41:05,876 --> 00:41:06,876
In a diaper?

385
00:41:08,251 --> 00:41:11,543
You'll definitely be needing this,
for the place you're going next.

386
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,710
Hey! She's flying!

387
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:47,043
In a zero gravity environment,
your breathing must be controlled!

388
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:49,918
If you breathe fast,
whatever's in your body will get out!

389
00:41:50,043 --> 00:41:52,585
We don't puke even after downing
a full shot of whiskey!

390
00:41:54,418 --> 00:41:55,793
Don't embarrass me like this!

391
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:05,209
I'm scared of heights!

392
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:10,167
Can this fan handle my weight?

393
00:42:12,002 --> 00:42:13,002
Hold me!

394
00:42:13,626 --> 00:42:15,334
Don't be scared!
You okay?

395
00:42:16,043 --> 00:42:17,167
Don't you dare!

396
00:42:19,418 --> 00:42:20,543
What's wrong?

397
00:42:20,668 --> 00:42:22,960
It's okay. Just hold it in.

398
00:42:23,084 --> 00:42:24,334
Hold it in!

399
00:42:28,002 --> 00:42:29,002
Go over there!

400
00:42:46,084 --> 00:42:48,293
My goodness.
I'm sorry, buddy!

401
00:42:48,418 --> 00:42:50,418
Had a heavy lunch.
-Never mind.

402
00:42:50,543 --> 00:42:52,167
Next time, we'll fly like a phoenix!

403
00:42:52,293 --> 00:42:53,626
Are you okay, Vasu?

404
00:43:02,293 --> 00:43:06,626
This is the exact design model,
of the missile that you have to steal.

405
00:43:08,876 --> 00:43:12,418
All crew members must be aware
of how to load the missile.

406
00:43:21,835 --> 00:43:24,960
The missile will travel
to the precise spot...

407
00:43:25,084 --> 00:43:27,710
...of the location co-ordinates
that we input into it.

408
00:43:28,876 --> 00:43:32,626
In space, rather than using
North, South, East and West...

409
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:35,835
...we feed in co-ordinates titled
"X", "Y", and "Z".

410
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,793
Using these three axes,
we can travel anywhere in space.

411
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:44,002
What I told you, is very important.
Please make note of it.

412
00:43:46,418 --> 00:43:48,376
How attentive the both of you are!

413
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:49,918
Look at him!

414
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:56,293
Sorry, sir.
Swathi got away.

415
00:44:57,293 --> 00:45:00,501
It's alright.
Execute our plan!

416
00:45:00,626 --> 00:45:01,960
There is another way.

417
00:45:08,126 --> 00:45:10,376
Swathi's pissed off
and she's got a gun!

418
00:45:10,501 --> 00:45:11,501
With a gun?

419
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,418
You're right!
It wasn't me!

420
00:45:28,334 --> 00:45:29,334
Still don't get it?

421
00:45:39,293 --> 00:45:41,126
Hey!
It says we shouldn't go in here.

422
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,084
She came with a gun for this?

423
00:46:00,251 --> 00:46:01,251
All an act, huh?

424
00:46:03,084 --> 00:46:04,084
For what?

425
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:07,167
Come. Let's eat.

426
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:11,167
Someone tried to kill me
from there.

427
00:46:12,293 --> 00:46:15,251
Despite so much security,
how can anyone get in?

428
00:46:15,376 --> 00:46:16,918
Definitely wasn't an outsider!

429
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:21,002
I'm against having a criminal like you
in a mission like this!

430
00:46:22,626 --> 00:46:24,876
But now, your team
is the only one I can trust.

431
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:29,543
We need to stand up to anyone
trying to impede this mission!

432
00:46:44,585 --> 00:46:48,376
'Are those the drops of time,
that ring through your ears?'

433
00:46:50,459 --> 00:46:54,126
'Are those quivers
the beat of your heart?'

434
00:46:54,251 --> 00:46:58,002
'Can anything that a man does
to end the root of suffering...'

435
00:46:58,126 --> 00:47:00,002
'...be considered a sin?'

436
00:47:00,126 --> 00:47:03,918
'If clouds do not steal water
from the sea...'

437
00:47:04,043 --> 00:47:05,835
'...can there ever be any rain?'

438
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,835
'Can anything that a man does
to end the root of suffering...'

439
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,751
'...be considered a sin?'

440
00:47:11,876 --> 00:47:15,668
'If clouds do not steal water
from the sea...'

441
00:47:15,793 --> 00:47:17,626
'...can there ever be any rain?'

442
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:20,501
'Destiny, small.
Determination, huge.'

443
00:47:20,626 --> 00:47:23,376
'Obstacles, small.
Answers, huge.'

444
00:47:23,501 --> 00:47:26,376
'Pain, small.
Path, huge.'

445
00:47:26,501 --> 00:47:29,251
'The material, small.
The spiritual, huge!'

446
00:47:31,418 --> 00:47:35,084
'Are those the drops of time,
that ring through your ears?'

447
00:47:37,293 --> 00:47:40,876
'Are these quivers
the beat of your heart?'

448
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:46,918
'Are those the drops of time,
that ring through your ears?'

449
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,626
'Are these quivers
the beat of your heart?'

450
00:47:52,751 --> 00:47:55,793
'From when the war begins,
whatever may happen...'

451
00:47:55,918 --> 00:47:58,585
'...we need to be stubborn.
Just like children!'

452
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:01,543
'Look at the night sky!
And the shining stars!'

453
00:48:01,668 --> 00:48:04,376
'Let's head over there!
To this celestial garden!'

454
00:48:04,501 --> 00:48:07,334
'Dreams become realities,
with progress made every day!'

455
00:48:07,459 --> 00:48:10,209
'From India to space,
we are astronomical!'

456
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:13,084
'Running hard to reach our destination,
is our ambition!'

457
00:48:13,209 --> 00:48:16,209
'We swear upon our lives,
that we will return with success!'

458
00:48:16,334 --> 00:48:19,418
'While many wars lie ahead of us...'

459
00:48:19,543 --> 00:48:22,251
'...can a puny asteroid deter us?'

460
00:48:22,376 --> 00:48:27,209
'Obliterate it! Shut the doors!
And then, we wage war!'

461
00:48:28,209 --> 00:48:31,126
'When conflicts over language, religion
and ethnicity abound...'

462
00:48:31,251 --> 00:48:34,043
'...will a falling sky
be the architect of our destruction?'

463
00:48:34,167 --> 00:48:36,501
'Halt it! End its journey!'

464
00:48:36,626 --> 00:48:39,501
'Only then,
shall we destroy ourselves!'

465
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:41,084
'Foam?
-Small!'

466
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,334
'Shore?
-Huge!'

467
00:48:42,459 --> 00:48:43,835
'Footprint?
-Small!'

468
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,501
'Place?
-Huge!'

469
00:48:45,626 --> 00:48:46,835
'A falling...
-Heart!'

470
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,251
'When it rises...'

471
00:48:48,376 --> 00:48:49,793
'Distress?
-Small!'

472

the beat of your heart?'

475

'When dangerous forms
attack the Earth...'

476

we will!'

477

00:50:42,418 --> 00:50:46,668
"...in the 'Dhruva-1' spacecraft, from the
Sriharikota Space Research Centre."

501
00:50:47,418 --> 00:50:49,960
Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh.

502
00:52:39,014 --> 00:52:41,471
I have never even taken a flight abroad.

503
00:53:05,306 --> 00:53:06,597
Are you able to hear me?

504
00:53:14,555 --> 00:53:16,264
Who is this?

505
00:53:16,388 --> 00:53:19,055
How are you able to speak in this channel?

506
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:22,180
Your son Ravi, is with me.

507
00:53:23,306 --> 00:53:24,306
What are you saying?

508
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:25,430
Grandpa!

509
00:53:33,513 --> 00:53:38,180
Don't shout!
No one outside this channel can hear us.

510
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:44,347
Your son wants to talk to you.

511
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,805
I'm really scared, dad!

512
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:51,347
Did you hear that?

513
00:53:51,471 --> 00:53:53,930
Who the hell are you?
What do you want?

514
00:53:59,889 --> 00:54:03,430
I need that missile!

515
00:54:07,847 --> 00:54:10,388
If I give you the missile,
40 million lives will be lost!

516
00:54:20,097 --> 00:54:25,430
Do you want to be a hero
and sacrifice your son?

517
00:54:44,722 --> 00:54:46,264
There is no doubt!

518
00:54:50,722 --> 00:54:52,222
My son is important to me!

519
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:56,347
I will steal it and give it to you.

520
00:57:16,597 --> 00:57:20,430
We have ten hours before we cross
the asteroid safety line.

521
00:57:20,555 --> 00:57:23,889
Dhruva-1 can reach
the target space station in two hours.

522
00:59:12,388 --> 00:59:13,930
Don't bloody puke!

523
00:59:23,055 --> 00:59:25,055
Here is the cabin uniform.
Get changed.

524
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:27,097
After we enter
their space station...

525
00:59:28,139 --> 00:59:30,014
...it's up to you from there.

526
00:59:30,139 --> 00:59:32,222
That's all I'm thinking about, Captain.

527
00:59:40,763 --> 00:59:45,306
What are you doing over there?
-Sir, I'm so disoriented.

528
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:46,972
Here! Get changed!

529
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:19,972
Every problem appears small from here.

530
01:00:22,722 --> 01:00:27,264
No father in the world,
would be this far apart from his son.

531
01:01:12,805 --> 01:01:15,347
I would rather use a diaper
than use this.

532
01:01:16,388 --> 01:01:18,471
Alright then!
Let me get down to task!

533
01:01:37,055 --> 01:01:38,972
That was the last bottle of liquor!

534
01:02:41,014 --> 01:02:42,347
Swathi!
Vasu is unconscious!

535
01:02:50,722 --> 01:02:52,722
Few people may faint
due to lack of gravity.

536
01:02:52,847 --> 01:02:54,889
Think there's high blood flow
to the brain.

537
01:02:55,014 --> 01:02:56,388
Let's take him to the sick bay.

538
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:15,471
Press this pack of glucose.

539
01:03:22,555 --> 01:03:25,722
You fainted due to excess blood flow
to your brain.

540
01:03:27,597 --> 01:03:28,847
Please take rest.

541
01:03:42,597 --> 01:03:43,763
Turn off your headphone.

542
01:03:50,805 --> 01:03:51,972
What are you doing, Vasu?

543
01:03:56,889 --> 01:03:58,055
Where are you going?

544
01:03:58,180 --> 01:03:59,722
Dude!
Good Morning!

545
01:04:02,555 --> 01:04:03,722
Where are you both going?

546
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:15,097
What are you doing in here?
-I'm going to cut the red and blue wires.

547
01:04:15,222 --> 01:04:16,430
Cut the wires?

548
01:04:18,638 --> 01:04:21,222
Once I do, the ship will lose
liquid hydrogen.

549
01:04:21,347 --> 01:04:23,471
And then?

550
01:04:23,597 --> 01:04:25,805
It is like fuel for the spacecraft.

551
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:27,763
We are going to empty the tank.

552
01:04:27,889 --> 01:04:30,930
Why are you doing it then?
-Just go and sit!

553
01:04:31,055 --> 01:04:34,139
Listen to me! It might go wrong.
-Do what I say! Now go!

554
01:04:34,264 --> 01:04:36,847
I'm talking to you!
Why are you doing this?

555
01:04:36,972 --> 01:04:38,388
Ravi has been kidnapped!

556
01:04:39,847 --> 01:04:41,222
By whom?

557
01:04:41,347 --> 01:04:46,222
I don't know who is behind it.
But he is no ordinary man!

558
01:04:48,722 --> 01:04:51,180
If I don't listen to him,
he will kill Ravi.

559
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:57,264
Vasu, act like you are unconscious.

560
01:04:57,388 --> 01:05:00,930
They will take you to the sick bay
at the lower deck.

561
01:05:01,055 --> 01:05:05,597
Go there and do what I say
without asking any questions.

562
01:05:08,388 --> 01:05:09,555
I don't have a choice.

563
01:05:25,222 --> 01:05:27,471
Swathi, the fuel level
seems to be dropping down.

564
01:05:37,306 --> 01:05:38,471
The fuel tank is leaking!

565
01:05:50,097 --> 01:05:51,597
The controls aren't functioning!

566
01:05:57,388 --> 01:05:59,680
Chief, the fuel level is dropping down!

567
01:06:08,722 --> 01:06:10,347
The ship isn't in our control!

568
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,097
We are being pulled by some force!

569
01:08:41,271 --> 01:08:42,938
Can you hear me?
Please respond.

570
01:08:43,064 --> 01:08:44,146
Are you okay, Captain?

571
01:08:48,355 --> 01:08:49,480
Please respond.

572
01:08:49,605 --> 01:08:50,605
Chief!

573
01:08:57,188 --> 01:08:58,188
We are okay.

574
01:09:01,146 --> 01:09:03,730
Sorry, Chief.
Don't know where we went wrong.

575
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:05,730
It's okay, Captain.

576
01:09:06,438 --> 01:09:08,647
There's no time for
"Sorry" or "Thank you".

577
01:09:08,772 --> 01:09:10,229
Let's think of what to do next.

578
01:09:22,229 --> 01:09:24,064
Have you thought this through?

579
01:09:24,188 --> 01:09:26,480
Forty million lives are at stake.

580
01:09:26,605 --> 01:09:28,521
There are four teams here.

581
01:09:28,647 --> 01:09:30,563
Each team seems to have its own motive.

582
01:09:31,355 --> 01:09:34,688
The army wants to steal the missile
and stop the asteroid.

583
01:09:35,355 --> 01:09:38,229
The missile's owner doesn't want
to lose it at any cost.

584
01:09:38,355 --> 01:09:40,855
For the one who blackmails,
no matter what happens...

585
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:43,022
...to our country,
he needs the missile.

586
01:09:43,146 --> 01:09:44,563
The fourth team, is us.

587
01:09:47,605 --> 01:09:48,855
We should win!

588
01:10:00,355 --> 01:10:03,355
Chief, this is Dhruva-1,
reporting from the surface of the moon.

589
01:10:06,105 --> 01:10:08,396
The outer doors are open
to check the fuel leak.

590
01:10:09,897 --> 01:10:11,271
In this historic moment...

591
01:10:11,396 --> 01:10:14,146
...I'm proud to step on the moon.

592
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:16,521
As the first Indian to step on the moon.

593
01:10:16,647 --> 01:10:20,563
The first Indian to step on the moon...

594
01:10:20,688 --> 01:10:23,022
...is Captain D. Raghuram.

595
01:10:32,188 --> 01:10:33,188
Vasu!

596
01:10:48,313 --> 01:10:49,313
No.

597
01:10:50,897 --> 01:10:52,480
It is M. Vasu.

598
01:10:56,064 --> 01:10:58,355
Whoever it is,
it is great for our country, isn't it?

599
01:10:58,938 --> 01:11:00,355
He pushed me, Captain!

600
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,271
Everyone knows Neil Armstrong.

601
01:11:02,396 --> 01:11:04,688
The second and third person
to step on the moon...

602
01:11:04,813 --> 01:11:06,563
...are forgotten even by Google!

603
01:11:56,105 --> 01:11:58,855
Chief, the fuel wire has been cut.

604
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:00,355
That's impossible!

605
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,855
We don't know how it happened.

606
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:04,688
With the fuel we have,
we can run the engines only for an hour.

607
01:12:04,813 --> 01:12:07,396
The fuel will reach you
in another six hours, Captain.

608
01:12:07,521 --> 01:12:10,022
By then, the asteroid would be closer
to the safety line!

609
01:12:11,355 --> 01:12:12,772
The time will not be sufficient.

610
01:12:17,688 --> 01:12:21,146
I don't understand why
he made me open the fuel tank.

611
01:12:22,146 --> 01:12:25,897
If the asteroid crosses the safety line,
while we're waiting...

612
01:12:26,022 --> 01:12:28,605
...then there is no point
in getting the missile.

613
01:12:30,313 --> 01:12:32,105
However you see it,
nothing can be done.

614
01:12:32,229 --> 01:12:33,438
We have to wait here.

615
01:12:33,563 --> 01:12:36,313
As if there's a fuel station nearby
to go and fill the tank!

616
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:39,396
Yes, there is.

617
01:12:54,355 --> 01:12:57,188
Dhruva-2 is ready to be launched
immediately, with fuel.

618
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:59,271
Let's not take any more chances.

619
01:13:01,647 --> 01:13:03,188
What happened, Vasu?

620
01:13:03,313 --> 01:13:06,938
Why don't we request fuel
from the target space station?

621
01:13:08,563 --> 01:13:09,980
Are you mad?

622
01:13:10,105 --> 01:13:11,521
Will you ask them for it?

623
01:13:11,647 --> 01:13:14,772
No, Captain.
It might actually work.

624
01:13:14,897 --> 01:13:18,980
To them, we are just Indian astronauts
who have come for satellite maintenance.

625
01:13:25,396 --> 01:13:27,313
This is Dhruva-1, Indian spacecraft.

626
01:13:27,438 --> 01:13:29,980
We're here for satellite maintenance
and we've lost fuel.

627
01:13:30,105 --> 01:13:31,938
Requesting help for refueling.

628
01:13:32,064 --> 01:13:33,647
I'm sending in our co-ordinates.

629
01:13:37,688 --> 01:13:39,146
I'll put this message on a loop.

630
01:13:39,271 --> 01:13:41,064
Let's see if we get a reply.
-Go ahead.

631
01:13:50,897 --> 01:13:52,355
Oh God!

632
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,730
Don't know whether
God is above or below us.

633
01:14:08,396 --> 01:14:11,563
We have an entry point
into their space station.

634
01:14:14,772 --> 01:14:16,813
Dhruva-1 attempting unorthodox take off.

635
01:14:18,313 --> 01:14:20,105
Liquid hydrogen is dangerously low.

636
01:14:28,772 --> 01:14:30,313
Dhruva-1 taking off, Chief.

637
01:15:02,313 --> 01:15:04,730
Chief,
Dhruva-1's estimated time of arrival...

638
01:15:04,855 --> 01:15:06,980
...at the target space station
is 45 minutes.

639
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:33,772
I don't know why
a petty criminal from North Madras...

640
01:15:33,897 --> 01:15:36,064
...did such a thing.

641
01:15:36,188 --> 01:15:37,730
But I definitely know...

642
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,813
...that someone from our department...

643
01:15:39,938 --> 01:15:41,688
...is behind all this.

644
01:15:44,355 --> 01:15:46,605
But I don't know who it is.

645
01:15:49,521 --> 01:15:52,313
Shall we inform our department
about this?

646
01:15:52,438 --> 01:15:54,229
No need to disturb them now.

647
01:15:54,355 --> 01:15:56,855
For now, just closely observe
the three of them.

648
01:16:07,188 --> 01:16:10,438
Yakub Bhai, I'll get the missile
in another two days.

649
01:16:10,563 --> 01:16:12,730
Six buyers are waiting for this.

650
01:16:13,813 --> 01:16:17,855
But if it goes to certain buyers,
things will get dangerous.

651
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:20,980
I don't care who buys it
and for what reasons.

652
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:24,271
The expense for this thing...

653
01:16:24,396 --> 01:16:25,938
The loss of lives it brings...

654
01:16:26,064 --> 01:16:28,313
Knowing all this, I'm giving this to you.

655
01:16:28,438 --> 01:16:30,605
Whoever accepts the price I've quoted...

656
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:32,146
...finish the deal with them.

657
01:16:43,855 --> 01:16:45,772
This boy is not eating at all.

658
01:16:46,772 --> 01:16:48,688
He won't die
if he doesn't eat for two days.

659
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:25,064
Dhruva-1 requesting to dock.

660
01:23:22,105 --> 01:23:24,938
You thought you could fight like a thug
and escape from here?

661
01:23:25,064 --> 01:23:27,355
Don't you need a plan
before attempting anything?

662
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:55,349
Don't forget to get me a spicy
Chicken rice and chilly manchurian

663
01:24:56,535 --> 01:24:57,826
Why were you so late?

664
01:24:57,951 --> 01:25:00,076
I was scared that I'd be doomed
in that box.

665
01:25:01,784 --> 01:25:03,451
Did you finish the job?

666
01:25:03,576 --> 01:25:07,076
Yeah, I placed the bug perfectly
in the mainframe system.

667
01:25:07,201 --> 01:25:10,034
You both didn't notice
that I wasn't here, right?

668
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:12,618
I'm your Captain.
Tell me before doing anything.

669
01:25:12,743 --> 01:25:15,618
You sound like the 'Captain'
who lost his deposit.

670
01:25:32,326 --> 01:25:33,826
We are in, dude.
-Good.

671
01:25:37,285 --> 01:25:38,535
To open this vault...

672
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:41,535
...we need Captain Lee's fingerprints
and his retinal scan.

673
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:45,034
Even with that,
if the missile is moved by an inch...

674
01:25:45,159 --> 01:25:47,201
...the alarm will go on.

675
01:25:47,326 --> 01:25:50,410
We have no way to bypass
this alarm system.

676
01:25:50,535 --> 01:25:51,535
That's the problem.

677
01:30:21,743 --> 01:30:22,743
I don't know, bro.

678
01:30:27,993 --> 01:30:30,493
You locked us in the room, didn't you?

679
01:30:30,618 --> 01:30:32,743
Then how can we get out from here?

680
01:30:40,576 --> 01:30:41,784
Alright then.

681
01:30:41,909 --> 01:30:42,951
Kill me!

682
01:30:45,784 --> 01:30:47,201
Vasu!
-Hey dude.

683
01:31:10,201 --> 01:31:13,618
Even if I ask you to say it,
please don't do it, Vasu.

684
01:31:44,784 --> 01:31:46,034
I'll tell you!

685
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:47,451
Don't, Vasu!

686
01:31:59,951 --> 01:32:00,951
In the Indian ship!

687
01:32:19,702 --> 01:32:21,243
I'll return the missile.

688
01:32:21,368 --> 01:32:22,993
Ask him to release all of us.

689
01:32:23,118 --> 01:32:25,493
He will give you the missile
if you release all of us.

690
01:34:00,867 --> 01:34:02,993
Flat nose punk!
You didn't expect this, right?

691
01:35:10,993 --> 01:35:15,326
No one enter the shuttle.
If you do, you won't make it back home.

692
01:35:20,535 --> 01:35:21,867
Tell them to note this down.

693
01:35:23,702 --> 01:35:26,702
89.8067 degrees North...

694
01:35:26,826 --> 01:35:30,326
...and 221.5285 degrees...
Vasu!

695
01:35:32,993 --> 01:35:39,034
89.8067 degrees North.
And 221.5285 degrees East.

696
01:35:45,451 --> 01:35:49,326
Take a step forward to the Indian ship,
you will not return to your country.

697
01:38:27,368 --> 01:38:28,826
Are they really spooked?

698
01:38:30,243 --> 01:38:32,034
Yes. They all are terrified.

699
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:34,493
I am pretty scared out here, too.

700
01:38:34,618 --> 01:38:38,618
Be careful.
If you slip, you have to keep going.

701
01:38:38,743 --> 01:38:40,576
There is no limit to the universe, dude.

702
01:38:40,702 --> 01:38:42,784
Hey! Don't scare me!

703
01:40:00,159 --> 01:40:02,993
You thought you could fight like a thug
and escape from here?

704
01:40:03,118 --> 01:40:05,535
Don't you need a plan
before attempting anything?

705
01:40:49,493 --> 01:40:50,993
Listen carefully!

706
01:40:51,118 --> 01:40:54,285
Escape to our ship
before their confusions clear.

707
01:41:47,451 --> 01:41:49,576
Come on!

708
01:41:53,618 --> 01:41:54,618
Captain! Behind you!

709
01:41:55,993 --> 01:41:57,451
Come soon and close it!

710
01:42:09,368 --> 01:42:10,368
Undocking Dhruva-1.

711
01:42:21,076 --> 01:42:22,743
Vasu hasn't come yet, Captain.

712
01:42:22,867 --> 01:42:24,201
We do not have any time!

713
01:42:24,326 --> 01:42:27,159
With the fuel we have,
we can run the engine for fifteen minutes.

714
01:42:32,493 --> 01:42:34,535
Come on, Vasu!
-Come on, dude!

715
01:42:38,326 --> 01:42:39,326
Hey!
-Come soon!

716
01:42:57,285 --> 01:42:58,743
His oxygen tank is leaking!

717
01:43:15,034 --> 01:43:16,034
Hey Vasu!

718
01:43:47,285 --> 01:43:49,451
Yes!
Thank God.

719
01:44:46,201 --> 01:44:47,285
Dad!

720
01:45:09,993 --> 01:45:10,993
He has made it!

721
01:45:17,285 --> 01:45:18,285
Running Engine A.

722
01:45:19,826 --> 01:45:20,867
Running Engine B.

723
01:46:07,154 --> 01:46:09,112
He needs an injection of adrenalin.
Hurry!

724
01:46:54,012 --> 01:46:55,012
Buddy!

725
01:47:23,929 --> 01:47:25,970
We've got the missile!

726
01:47:26,095 --> 01:47:27,679
The Chief will be glad
to hear this!

727
01:47:45,638 --> 01:47:49,970
Almost time for you
to hand over the missile to me.

728
01:47:50,095 --> 01:47:52,638
From here,
how can I give this missile to you?

729
01:47:52,762 --> 01:47:53,762
Dhruva-2!

730
01:47:53,887 --> 01:47:57,596
That's why I made you empty the fuel tank.

731
01:47:57,720 --> 01:47:59,554
What about my son?

732
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:02,638
The minute you hand over
the missile to Dhruva-2...

733
01:48:02,762 --> 01:48:08,471
...your son will be safe with his grandpa
at the Army guest house in Munnar.

734
01:48:19,512 --> 01:48:20,929
Dhruva-2 is ready for docking.

735
01:49:16,803 --> 01:49:18,054
I have done what you asked.

736
01:49:30,929 --> 01:49:32,304
In another ten minutes...

737
01:49:32,429 --> 01:49:34,679
...your son will be safe
at the Army guest house.

738
01:49:35,970 --> 01:49:39,596
Do you know why I chose you
for this mission?

739
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:41,429
Your love for your son.

740
01:49:45,304 --> 01:49:49,929
Neither you nor I are responsible
for those 40 million deaths.

741
01:49:50,054 --> 01:49:51,762
It was purely an act of nature.

742
01:49:51,887 --> 01:49:53,679
We couldn't stop it.
Simple as that.

743
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:02,054
We have visual contact
with the asteroid's crater.

744
01:51:17,012 --> 01:51:20,095
Ten minutes left
to cross the safety line.

745
01:51:20,221 --> 01:51:22,638
Load the missile now, Swathi.
-Yes, Captain!

746
01:51:42,762 --> 01:51:43,845
The missile is missing!

747
01:51:48,596 --> 01:51:50,596
Only eight minutes
to cross the safety line!

748
01:51:54,262 --> 01:51:55,762
Is the missile ready for launch?

749
01:52:00,387 --> 01:52:01,887
What are you saying, Captain?

750
01:52:22,346 --> 01:52:23,638
Vasu's responsible for this.

751
01:52:28,012 --> 01:52:30,221
Look at the images
I'm sending over right now.

752
01:52:30,346 --> 01:52:31,471
He cut the fuel wire!

753
01:52:39,221 --> 01:52:41,929
He hid in plain sight
and betrayed our mission.

754
01:52:43,346 --> 01:52:45,512
He lies and cheats for a living.

755
01:52:45,638 --> 01:52:47,679
What else could we expect from him?

756
01:52:47,803 --> 01:52:50,429
Even if he is bad,
how could the missile leave the ship?

757
01:53:07,596 --> 01:53:09,803
Only one minute away
from the safety line.

758
01:53:11,887 --> 01:53:13,346
We came so close
to stopping it!

759
01:53:52,095 --> 01:53:53,512
It has crossed the safety line.

760
01:53:57,970 --> 01:53:59,387
The lives of 40 million people!

761
01:54:10,179 --> 01:54:12,095
Some of our families...

762
01:54:12,221 --> 01:54:13,471
...are in the target areas.

763
01:54:14,762 --> 01:54:16,554
We won't share details of the mission.

764
01:54:16,679 --> 01:54:19,346
Can you permit us
to speak to them one last time?

765
01:54:39,596 --> 01:54:42,596
Your son has been released, Vasu.

766
01:55:37,638 --> 01:55:39,638
Apologies for the delay
in telling you this.

767
01:55:39,762 --> 01:55:41,638
Missile is locked
and ready to launch!

768
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:47,012
The asteroid hasn't crossed
the safety line. We have two minutes!

769
01:56:11,221 --> 01:56:12,887
In another ten minutes...

770
01:56:13,012 --> 01:56:16,471
...your son will be safe
at the Army guest house.

771
01:56:16,596 --> 01:56:18,095
Thank you, Vasu.

772
01:56:18,221 --> 01:56:20,095
If he's talking through this channel...

773
01:56:20,221 --> 01:56:22,929
...no one else must know of our plan,
until this is over.

774
01:56:31,429 --> 01:56:35,720
This is the exact design model,
of the missile that you have to steal.

775
01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:39,262
In space, one cannot tell the difference
in weight...

776
01:56:39,387 --> 01:56:42,471
...between a duplicate and the original.

777
01:56:46,095 --> 01:56:48,179
Load the missile now, Swathi.
-Yes, Captain!

778
01:58:52,887 --> 01:58:55,054
The suspense would've killed
the folks below!

779
02:02:41,887 --> 02:02:42,887
Dad!

780
02:02:58,387 --> 02:03:00,387
Look in your pocket!

781
02:04:14,803 --> 02:04:17,304
On our team's behalf,
here's a medal for you.

782
02:04:18,970 --> 02:04:19,970
Look in your pocket.

783
02:04:40,762 --> 02:04:42,262
After all, he is my son!

784
02:04:42,262 --> 02:04:47,810
