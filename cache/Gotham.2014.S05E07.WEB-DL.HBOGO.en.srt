1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,200
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,800
You're the brother I never had.

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,960
We will create a legacy in this city.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,600
Gotham falls, we rise together.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,520
Poor Jim. All alone again.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,800
- I told you to leave.
- I heard you.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,400
So many things I wish I could change.
Things I have done.

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,680
We're here now.

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,160
We'll try to put the pieces
back together again.

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,800
Jim, I'm pregnant.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,480
- This isn't you.
- We are not the same.

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,440
That night when your parents
were murdered,

13
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,960
I didn't do anything
because I didn't care.

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,680
Everyone, let's dig a little deeper.

15
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,760
'Cause that's the only way

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,040
you're all making it out
of this hole.

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,080
Deep enough?

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,360
You're leaving Gotham.

19
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,560
There's nothing left for me here
anymore.

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,480
- I've done all I can.
- I want in.

21
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,800
I love family reunions.

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,600
Don't you?

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,640
- Go!
- Go!

24
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,080
Go!

25
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,160
Hurry!

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,960
- Which way?
- Wait.

27
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,040
{\an5}General, you were the ones
who let Walker operate,

28
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,240
{\an5}right under your noses.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,920
{\an5}Now you're telling me
she evaded capture?

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
{\an5}<i>I understand your frustration.</i>

31
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,120
{\an5}Have you at least determined
why she did what she did?

32
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,240
<i>Not yet.</i>

33
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,440
{\an5}Look, bottom line, Walker
and Dorrance are out of the picture.

34
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,760
What else is standing in the way
of reunification?

35
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,120
{\an5}<i>Nothing. I'm recommending
we begin the process immediately.</i>

36
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,680
There have been a lot of promises
from across the river.

37
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,880
{\an5}<i>But unlike Walker or whoever she is,
I have the authority to take action.</i>

38
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,960
{\an5}<i>Unless something happens
to destabilize Gotham again,</i>

39
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,440
{\an5}<i>this nightmare is about to end.</i>

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,920
Think he's for real?

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,360
{\an5}I'll believe it when it happens.

42
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,600
{\an5}I take it your search party
didn't find Alfred.

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,800
{\an5}Neither hide nor hair.

44
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,760
{\an5}Pennyworth vanished five days ago.
It ain't looking good.

45
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
{\an5}How's Bruce?

46
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,640
{\an5}He's been pulling double shifts
on the search parties.

47
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
{\an5}Kid's dead on his feet.

48
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,720
I want to search this area next.

49
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,160
{\an5}There are whole blocks
of abandoned buildings.

50
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
I'll get a squad right on it.

51
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,400
{\an5}Just give me five minutes,
I'll be ready.

52
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,440
{\an5}- You're not going out.
- No, Jim!

53
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,440
{\an5}You need your rest.
I'm not cutting you out.

54
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,200
{\an5}But I need you sharp,
not a liability.

55
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,880
{\an5}I just don't understand
what could've happened.

56
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,640
{\an5}Neither do I.

57
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,680
{\an5}But I know that Alfred Pennyworth
can take care of himself.

58
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,080
{\an5}I'll send for you if I hear anything.

59
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,520
{\an5}- Kid's tough.
- Yeah.

60
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,840
{\an5}In other goodish news, Harper
radioed, squad found something.

61
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,920
{\an5}What?

62
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
It's weird.

63
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,240
Four men.

64
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,880
Looks like they breathed
in some sort of chemical agent.

65
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
I'm thinking airborne.

66
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,240
And the Z's on their bodies?

67
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,160
Carved into them before
the time of death.

68
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,480
Check out the mustache.

69
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,840
Fake.

70
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,200
It seems that they escaped from here.

71
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,200
- A film set?
- I said it was weird.

72
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,880
The Z's on their chests,
think it could be Zsasz?

73
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,320
No, chemicals aren't really his M.O..

74
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,600
Plus, I never figured Zsasz
for much of a cinephile.

75
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,640
But whoever it is,
if they have more of these chemicals,

76
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,240
- and the will to use them.
- It's, It's bye-bye reunification.

77
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,560
We gotta stop him before news
reaches the mainland.

78
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
The Chessmen.

79
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,920
It's a gang that operates
out of the Narrows.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,160
What the hell is a Narrows gang
doing way up here?

81
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,160
I think we both know
someone we can ask.

82
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,960
Can you check on the fever
in bed twelve?

83
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
What's up, Doc?

84
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,680
Heard you were working here.
Interesting.

85
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,320
It's what I do, help people.

86
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,720
Speaking of which, I've got patients.

87
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,280
Oh, you wouldn't kick Jim's baby
momma to the curb now, would you?

88
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,240
Whatever happened between you
and Jim, it's none of my concern.

89
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,800
- So, if you're here to gloat...
- I'm here for medical assistance.

90
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
For my little nugget.

91
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,000
- What do you say? Be my OB?
- You can't be serious.

92
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,640
I know you we've had our differences.

93
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,920
You tried to kill me, Barbara.

94
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
Twice.

95
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,480
That was years ago.

96
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,480
- There are other doctors here.
- Not as good as you.

97
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,680
Look, whatever you think of me,
my child is innocent,

98
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,040
and I want the best for it.

99
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,320
And in this place that means you.

100
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,920
- Does Jim know you're here?
- This is none of his business.

101
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Lee?

102
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Jim.

103
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,320
- Barbara.
- You're interrupting.

104
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,800
Doctor patient. Blow.

105
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,720
- I'm sorry, you're her doctor?
- No.

106
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,400
I don't know. Maybe.

107
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
What are you doing here?

108
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,680
Some bodies turned up.

109
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,400
There might have been Narrows
connection.

110
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,960
- I wouldn't have come but...
- It's important. Right.

111
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,600
You two need to talk.

112
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,680
- I'll be outside.
- I'd rather not.

113
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,520
If you want me to be your doctor,
you will talk to the baby's father.

114
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,920
Your first appointment is next week.

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,920
The nurse will give you
all your vitamins when you leave.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Deal?

117
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,320
Is she really the only one
you could find?

118
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,640
She's the best doctor
in this hellhole of a city.

119
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,120
- Not everything is about Jim Gordon.
- Pretty sure this one is.

120
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,680
Because we slept together, yeah.

121
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,640
I only told you because
I felt you had a right to know.

122
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,320
But your involvement in this ended

123
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,840
the moment you put your pants
back on.

124
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
Or what?

125
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,600
You don't think
I'm fit to be a mother?

126
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
What do you think?

127
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
Barbara.

128
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
Who are you?

129
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,400
- Well, look who decided to join us.
- Hello, Champ.

130
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
Master Bruce!

131
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,880
- Alfred. How did you...
- Look at the state of you.

132
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,280
What have I told you about
rolling around in the muck?

133
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,320
Alfred, what's going on?
Who are these people?

134
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,720
Whatever do you mean, Bruce?

135
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,160
We're your parents.

136
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,840
Right.
Well, let's get you spruced up.

137
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,920
After all, we have a guest.

138
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,920
Welcome home, Bruce.

139
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,440
Jeremiah.

140
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
You're alive.

141
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,840
Well, you didn't think Selina
could kill me so easily, did you?

142
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,400
I just had to put you off my scent
until I could finalize my project.

143
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,480
Manners, Master Bruce!

144
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,600
Let's not be rude to our guest.

145
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,720
Especially, when I come
bearing gifts.

146
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,200
Oh, Mr. Jeremiah. A cake!

147
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,920
How exceedingly kind of you.

148
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,040
Is it Italian meringue?

149
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,760
- Sure.
- Oh.

150
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,000
Now, now, Bruce.

151
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,440
You come any closer,
and I blow up Wayne Manor

152
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,040
with all of us inside of it.

153
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,680
I have a dozen more of these,

154
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,760
Italian meringues,
sprinkled all throughout the house.

155
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,240
What did you do to Alfred?

156
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,680
And who are these people?

157
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,360
Ah, glad you asked.
Hmm, come. Come, come.

158
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,880
Mommy and Daddy dearest...

159
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,280
Were just an innocent couple
I kidnapped

160
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,200
based on bone structure and...

161
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
build.

162
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,600
Just a touch of plastic surgery
and <i>voilà</i>, Waynes.

163
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,120
Alfred, I nabbed in the Green Zone.

164
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,200
They're hypnotized.

165
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,120
Well, I'm afraid there's no room
for improv in our script.

166
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,080
Today is a very important day, Bruce.

167
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,920
Just look at the way they're dressed.

168
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,920
It's the night my parents
were killed.

169
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,160
And I'm giving you the chance
to experience it all over again.

170
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,040
Why?

171
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,120
Isn't it obvious?

172
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
Bruce...

173
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,920
this, this was the most
important day of your life.

174
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,440
And I didn't get to be a part of it.

175
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,680
Well, we need to rectify that.

176
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,000
Alfred, it's time for dinner.

177
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,480
Chop-chop!
We're on a very tight schedule.

178
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
Of course, Mr. Jeremiah.

179
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,360
That's zero for three.

180
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,240
Yes.

181
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,200
Seems the government was quite
thorough when they mined the river.

182
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,400
You didn't have a plan
to get off this rock

183
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,040
before you stole everyone's crap?

184
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,960
I was working on a plan.

185
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,880
The river is mined.

186
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,960
Everything that flies out
gets blown from the sky.

187
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
What?

188
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,080
Jeremiah was digging a tunnel
under the river.

189
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
A tunnel?

190
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,760
- Really?
- Do you have any better ideas?

191
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,560
Didn't think so.

192
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
It's in the Dark Zone.

193
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,000
We should wait until night
to check it out.

194
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,200
Well, I was running out of guinea
pigs anyway.

195
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,440
Oh, look, he's swimming ashore.

196
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,760
Are you sure you should be
out in the Narrows alone?

197
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,560
When the bridges fell,
this place descended into chaos.

198
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,360
Figure our best bet of getting out
in one piece

199
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,520
is to keep a low profile.

200
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,920
So, all the work I did to make
the Narrows better was for nothing.

201
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,600
It's the Leopards.
Rivals of the Chessmen.

202
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,360
The freak is dead.

203
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,600
- About this Barbara thing...
- Jim, just don't.

204
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,280
No, it's important to me
that you understand.

205
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,480
Okay. So, what're you gonna do?

206
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,360
I don't know but it's my child, too.

207
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,960
Barbara seems to have a difference
in opinion.

208
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,480
But hey, people change.

209
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,760
- You don't know her like I do.
- You can say that again.

210
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
Look.

211
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,720
We're clear.

212
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,280
The Chessmen moved around.

213
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,080
They used these as signals
for their members.

214
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,120
The rook's a compass needle.

215
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,760
North-northeast. Let's go.

216
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,120
Alfred told me such great tidbits
about your childhood.

217
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,560
How you used to eat here

218
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,520
in the kitchen when it was just you
and the family.

219
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,800
My, how homey and intimate.

220
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,400
The grilled cheese and Branston
pickle sandwich, Mr. Jeremiah.

221
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,600
Master Bruce's favorite.

222
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,160
My influence though Thomas did
add a dash of aioli for extra flair.

223
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,760
Oh, come on, Bruce.

224
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,400
That's a weird favorite food
for a twelve year old.

225
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
I'm playing your game.

226
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,160
Now, let Alfred and these people go.
They're innocent.

227
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
I'm sorry, Bruce.

228
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,240
It's just, it's very important to me

229
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,480
that I get every detail
exactly right.

230
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,600
Speaking of which, the final touch.

231
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,560
What was it like...

232
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,040
losing your parents that night?

233
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,000
I lost my family too, Bruce.

234
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,960
The wound still hasn't healed.
I think about it often.

235
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,040
None of this is real.

236
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,720
You're trying to manipulate me.

237
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,240
It will never be real.

238
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,280
But you are thinking about
that night.

239
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,880
And that's all I need.

240
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,400
I just wanna be connected to you.

241
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,240
I offered for you
to be my best friend!

242
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,160
But I realized
if we can't be friends,

243
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,600
then we can be connected
in other ways.

244
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,440
How?

245
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,280
You'll see.

246
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,560
In time.

247
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,080
I'm sorry to cut the night short,

248
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,920
but your parents and I
have a very important date.

249
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,720
- Jeremiah!
- With destiny.

250
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,880
Jeremiah!

251
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,600
You might want to find
your faithful butler and leave.

252
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,960
Quickly.

253
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
Alfred!

254
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,360
The signs lead this way.

255
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,000
Look at the smoke.

256
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,360
Someone restarted production.

257
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
Oh, my God, Jim.

258
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Look at all of this.

259
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
Come on.

260
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,680
Who's in charge here?

261
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,360
Tick tock, the chemical stock
shall give our Gotham an aftershock.

262
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,320
Tick tock, the chemical stock
shall give our Gotham an aftershock.

263
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,640
- Tick tock.
- Tick tock.

264
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,680
The chemical stock
shall give our Gotham an aftershock.

265
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,840
- They've been hypnotized.
- It was Tetch.

266
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,280
Tick tock, the chemical stock
shall give our Gotham an aftershock.

267
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,400
My, my, what a thrill.

268
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,920
Jim Gordon and the woman
he told me to kill.

269
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,240
Brings back memories.

270
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,680
That tea party, so long ago.

271
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,160
But now, to order these men
to attack my foe!

272
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,120
All for one, and one for all.
Isn't this a grand old ball!

273
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,640
Yoo-hoo!

274
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,720
- Jim!
- Ain't this some

275
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,040
game.

276
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
Give it to me again?

277
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,640
Penguin has been stealing everything
in the City that's not nailed down

278
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,120
and now he needs a way
of getting it off the island.

279
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,520
- And you're helping him.
- Well, that's what he thinks.

280
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,720
Barbara, Tabitha was my friend, too.

281
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,920
If anything, I wanna gut the twerp
and take his loot.

282
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Except you don't actually
have a way out of Gotham.

283
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,640
I'll find one tonight.

284
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,600
I'll still need your help
moving the stuff.

285
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,960
We can get out of here together.

286
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,560
Away from Jim Gordon.

287
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,560
Rich as Midas.

288
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,600
Penguin dead in a ditch.

289
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,280
Well, aren't we just
two single ladies and a baby,

290
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,240
about to kill
our sworn enemy together.

291
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,080
What?

292
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,400
It's just you're pregnant.

293
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,560
Don't even start.

294
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,520
Alfred!

295
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,360
Alfred!

296
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,680
Alfred, we need to get out of here.

297
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,520
Ah, Master Bruce, I was just taking
a quiet moment to tidy up.

298
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,000
We need to go. The bombs.

299
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,480
- What bombs?
- These bombs!

300
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,840
No need for rough housing, sir.

301
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
There has to be a way.

302
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,240
Alfred, you'd do anything to protect
me, right?

303
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,560
Absolutely, sir.

304
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,240
There's a gas leak. In the kitchen.

305
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,440
It's only a matter of time
before this whole place goes up.

306
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,880
A gas leak?

307
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,120
Where're your parents?
Where's our guest?

308
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,280
I've already warned them.
I know a way out. Come on!

309
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
Alfred!

310
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Alfred.

311
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,080
- Oh, bloody hell.
- Don't move.

312
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
Do you...

313
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,720
Oh, yeah. I remember everything.

314
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,960
Clear as day.

315
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,400
Let me tell you if ever I see that
Jervis Tetch character again,

316
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,520
I'll stick that watch so far up his,
his nose.

317
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,160
How about you?

318
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,200
Are you all right?

319
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,920
Yeah, I'm all right.

320
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,640
The Manor.

321
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,480
Don't you worry about that now, son.

322
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,880
Come on, help me up.

323
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,240
Oh, your leg's hurt.

324
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,880
Yeah, it's all right.
It's not broken.

325
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,960
I thought I lost you.

326
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,280
Me?

327
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,160
Never, Master Bruce.

328
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,720
Go on.

329
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,080
You know where he's gonna be at.

330
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Go.

331
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,800
If you're here,
Jeremiah must still alive.

332
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,320
And if you're here, I'm guessing
you found our test subjects,

333
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,480
all boiled and bubbled.

334
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,240
What's he planning?

335
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
It's a surprise, don't you know?

336
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,880
A real killer.

337
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,960
Shall I hypnotize our friends here,

338
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,880
and have them slit each other's
necks?

339
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,920
Nix.

340
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,360
Better check with the boss.

341
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,000
He might have other ideas.

342
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,640
I'm sorry I got you involved in this.

343
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,280
Don't be. I knew
what I was getting myself into.

344
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,360
I know but, Lee...

345
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,480
Jim, whatever you wanna tell me,
save it till we're out of here.

346
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,560
Fair enough.

347
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,840
We need to find out
what Valeska's planning.

348
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,560
Hey, Tetch.

349
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,040
You know, it's funny.

350
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,600
I never figured you
for Jeremiah's errand boy.

351
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
Oh, Captain.

352
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
No errands do I run.

353
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,880
This is simply a way for me
to have some fun.

354
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,200
Tell yourself that.

355
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,240
What are you, when you would take
away your games and your rhymes?

356
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,680
Nothing but a second-rater
with that really silly hat.

357
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,560
Shut up.

358
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,280
Beautiful.

359
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,000
Lee Thompkins,
you do intrigue me so.

360
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,000
First, you were a doctor.

361
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,840
Then, the Narrows Queen.

362
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,640
Tell me, please do.

363
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,960
Are you running from your past,
when you become someone new?

364
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,440
When I found Jeremiah,

365
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,200
he had a bunch of crazies
digging this tunnel for him.

366
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,120
Well, that certainly fills me
with confidence.

367
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,600
You hear that?

368
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,680
- Alfred?
- Selina?

369
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
What are you doing here?

370
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,880
And with that?

371
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,840
I should ask you the same thing.
What's down that tunnel?

372
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,920
Well, it was Wayne Manor
till Jeremiah blew it up.

373
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,480
He sealed the only way out of Gotham.

374
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,680
No, Jeremiah is not alive.
I... I saw him die, right here.

375
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,760
Yeah, well, you're wrong.

376
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
We all were.

377
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,520
And now he's embarked
on some mad cap scheme,

378
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,040
where he's reenacting the night
Bruce's parents were killed.

379
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,400
- Where's Bruce?
- He's gone after Jeremiah.

380
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
He could use your help.

381
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,720
- Wait...
- Don't.

382
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,600
You think, that because
I did not kill Jeremiah

383
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,160
does not mean that I won't kill you.

384
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,160
- Selina.
- You killed my friend, Tabitha.

385
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,640
- You deserve to die.
- Selina.

386
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
Just put the knife down.

387
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,120
Bruce needs you.

388
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,720
I suppose I should thank you.

389
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,360
Or you could help me
to the Green Zone.

390
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,520
Of course. It's that way.

391
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,840
Jeremiah!

392
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,680
Show yourself!

393
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,160
<i>Olle!</i>

394
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,080
<i>Hola, Bruce.</i>

395
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,480
<i>Well, here we are.</i>

396
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,960
<i>The theater where your Mummy
and Daddy took you to see</i>

397
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,120
<i>The Mark of Zorro.</i>

398
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,360
<i>I had heard you were obsessed
with this man as a child.</i>

399
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,000
<i>I wonder what it was
that intrigued you so.</i>

400
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,760
<i>Was it the fact that he struck
fear into the heart of his enemy?</i>

401
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,760
<i>En guarde!</i>

402
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,000
<i>Take that, villain!</i>

403
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,640
<i>Vagabond!</i>

404
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,560
<i>You know what?</i>

405
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,680
<i>Perhaps, the movie
was a bit too effective.</i>

406
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,760
<i>Isn't this the part
where you became frightened?</i>

407
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,360
<i>When you asked your parents to leave?</i>

408
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,520
<i>I wonder what would've happened
if you hadn't done that.</i>

409
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,120
<i>If you had conquered your fear.</i>

410
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,920
<i>Maybe your parents
would still be alive.</i>

411
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,920
<i>Well, on to the last and final stop
down memory lane.</i>

412
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Stop!

413
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,640
Stop!

414
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,160
That's far enough, Bruce.

415
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,520
Jeremiah,

416
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,840
you don't have to do this!

417
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,760
But I, I do.

418
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,280
You see, I came to this realization,

419
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,480
I realized that no matter
what I did to bond us,

420
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,720
some random gunman in an alley

421
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,200
would be the man
who you were tied to the most.

422
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,200
The man you saw
when you closed your eyes.

423
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,240
I want to be the star of the show.

424
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,040
So, if I can't have you
as a brother bonded by love,

425
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,320
then we'll just have to be
bonded by hatred.

426
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,440
And you think killing two people that
look like my parents will do that?

427
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,160
It won't.

428
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,160
Then it's a good thing
I already put a bullet

429
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,320
in both of their fraudulent skulls.

430
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,600
Oh, you're confused.

431
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,280
You're wondering if I already shot
them, then who is this lovely couple.

432
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,920
Thomas, Martha.

433
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,960
Why don't you turn around?

434
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,800
Jim!

435
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,640
I know.

436
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,960
See, over the course
of our little adventure,

437
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,160
fate brought to me
James Gordon and Leslie Thompkins.

438
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,480
and I thought to myself...

439
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,840
why not?

440
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,400
Why not kill the man who you think
of as your second father figure?

441
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,960
And your dear, dear,
dear friend, Lee Thompkins.

442
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
And when I do,

443
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,120
finally you and I
will be bound together.

444
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,200
'Cause you see...

445
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,520
Reunification with the mainland
hangs on by a thread.

446
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,040
Those fireworks go off, and toxic
chemicals rain down onto the city,

447
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,800
and the government cuts
us adrift for good.

448
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,760
Jeremiah,

449
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,320
don't.

450
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,480
<i>le pièce de résistance.</i>

451
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,920
One last thing,

452
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,080
I had Jervis Tetch hypnotize them

453
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,320
so that they'll wake up
the moment these

454
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,760
beautiful pearls hit the ground.

455
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,160
I want you to see them realize
what I've done to them

456
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,600
as the life drains from their bodies.

457
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,160
Never forget,
this is all for you, Bruce.

458
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,440
No!

459
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,680
Selina, the pearls!

460
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,280
Ecco! Now!

461
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,280
We need to stop the fireworks.
They're gonna...

462
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,480
I know. You go after Jeremiah
and Ecco! I'll take the truck!

463
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,560
There's no way to stop them all.

464
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,560
Get to Harvey.

465
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,080
Warn the people in the Green Zone
to get to cover.

466
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,840
What are you...

467
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
Jim!

468
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,360
Jeremiah!

469
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,320
Face me!

470
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,240
Here, Bruce!

471
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,920
Jeremiah!

472
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,760
This ends, tonight.

473
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,160
No.

474
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,720
No, Bruce. Now, it begins.

475
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,160
Yes.

476
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,120
You feel it,
the connection between us?

477
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,480
You do.

478
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,640
Don't you?

479
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,040
Oh, Bruce, you feel it?

480
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,280
Tell me you feel this.

481
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,480
You mean nothing to me.

482
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,880
Why don't you understand?

483
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,960
You need me!

484
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,720
I'm the answer
to your life's question.

485
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,960
Without me, you're just a joke...

486
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,040
without a punch line.

487
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,520
After all this time,

488
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,160
you've come to me for help?

489
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,800
After allowing Strange
to put a chip into my brain?

490
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,440
Attempting to sell me out to Gordon?

491
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,520
And after naming..

492
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,160
a dog after me?

493
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,040
First of all,
I am very fond of that dog.

494
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:16,680
Secondly, I had Hugo Strange
save your life.

495
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,120
Thirdly, do you really think
I didn't have plans

496
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,280
to save you from Jim Gordon?

497
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,360
You always have an answer
for everything, don't you Oswald?

498
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,200
We have been through
all of this before.

499
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,840
I've tried to kill you,
you've tried to kill me.

500
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,480
But here we are, in this room.
Together.

501
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,360
It means fate has different plans
for us.

502
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,120
What are these plans?

503
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,040
Haven't you realized
what Gotham is yet?

504
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,880
It is no longer a city.

505
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,240
It is a prison.

506
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,760
And I think it's time we escaped.

507
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,640
You heard the news?

508
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,360
Everybody is talking about it.

509
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,680
Reunification isn't happening.

510
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,400
Word of the chemical spill
reached the mainland.

511
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,920
No action until the government
can determine if Gotham is safe.

512
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,240
I figure at least a couple of months.

513
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,200
You don't sound surprised.

514
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,440
Guess I'm not.

515
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,600
Could've been much worse.

516
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,360
You stopped that.

517
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,240
Every time I think
we're turning things around,

518
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,400
I look up, right back
where we started.

519
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,720
What were you about to say to me,
when, Tetch had us?

520
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,040
I don't know.

521
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,840
I guess I, would've said...

522
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,240
would've said the last time
we saw each other...

523
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,000
I wish I could go back.

524
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,520
Do things differently.

525
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,920
Better.

526
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,920
- That feels like a long time ago.
- Nothing's changed.

527
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,520
But it has, Jim.

528
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,040
- That was a mistake.
- Mistake?

529
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,320
Put yourself in my shoes.

530
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,080
After everything you said,
suddenly you're having a baby

531
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,920
with Barbara, of all people.

532
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,360
But it's not just that.

533
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,480
You talk about doing things
differently and I keep thinking...

534
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,160
what if we hadn't lost ours.

535
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,800
What're you doing here, Lee?

536
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,880
I don't know.

537
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,400
I know you've taken on so much and...

538
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,040
and I want to be understanding.
But...

539
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,360
You let me down, Jim.

540
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,640
I'm sorry.

541
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,800
What does that mean?

542
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,320
For us?

543
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,080
I don't know.

544
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,320
You can't change the past so,
I guess we just have to live with it.

545
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,480
No, please.

546
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,960
I can't believe he's still alive.

547
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,640
They've been doing scans,
and he has no brain activity.

548
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,640
He's no longer a threat.

549
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,960
To either of us.

550
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,760
Thank you for coming to help me.

551
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,840
The night your parents were killed.
I should have done something.

552
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,920
Selina, you've done enough.

553
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,080
It's not much but it's home.

554
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,840
I've been looking
through your treasure trove.

555
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,280
You've been a very naughty boy.

556
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,400
Barbara? How did you...

557
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,640
- Selina.
- Hmm.

558
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,880
She and I were gonna go
murder-halvsies

559
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,520
to get you back for Tabitha.

560
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,520
But it seems I will have to do
the dirty work myself.

561
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,800
- As usual.
- Oh, my God!

562
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,440
You're pregnant!

563
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,800
How could you possibly know that?

564
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,760
Look at you! She's glowing.

565
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,880
You're glowing!

566
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,280
How very observant of you.

567
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,040
- <i>Adieu</i>, Oswald.
- Wait!

568
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,440
Come with us!

569
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,800
- What?
- Yes,

570
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,000
I killed Tabitha.

571
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,440
You are angry. You want revenge.

572
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:01,560
But do you really wanna raise
your child in a toxic waste war zone?

573
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,360
Come with us.

574
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,600
Are you telling me you found a way
out of Gotham?

575
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Ed did.

576
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,920
- It's a submarine.
- A submarine?

577
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,520
It can track mines in the river
using sonar.

578
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,920
So, where's this submarine?

579
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,200
- We have to build it.
- Yeah, I'm gonna shoot you.

580
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,560
God!

581
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
What is happening to me?

582
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,120
- Perhaps...
- Shut up!

583
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,680
That was a rhetorical question.

584
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,840
Fine.

585
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,120
I won't shoot you.
For the sake of my child.

586
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,760
But I will never forgive you.

587
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,480
Of course.

588
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,720
I understand.

589
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,200
Call me when it's done.

590
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,920
- So, who's the lucky father?
- Shut up!
