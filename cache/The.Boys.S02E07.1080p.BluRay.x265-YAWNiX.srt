1
00:00:02,796 --> 00:00:04,256
Holy shit!

2
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:08,177
We are going to hold hearings
on Vought and Compound V.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,679
I'm the world's greatest superhero.

4
00:00:10,762 --> 00:00:12,890
You're my greatest failure.

5
00:00:12,973 --> 00:00:15,559
I do like you.
You got spunk.

6
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:17,394
You'll be a big help to me.

7
00:00:17,477 --> 00:00:19,521
What the hell does that mean?

8
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:22,734
That's Lamplighter.

9
00:00:22,816 --> 00:00:25,444
These people are test subjects.
Trying to stabilise the V.

10
00:00:26,987 --> 00:00:28,614
Anytime, you get a solid Supe.

11
00:00:28,697 --> 00:00:32,492
- Why would Vought do that?
- We are in a war for the culture.

12
00:00:32,576 --> 00:00:34,077
But we can fight back

13
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:36,830
with an army of supermen, millions strong.

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,584
Everyone I have ever loved
is in the ground.

15
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:43,253
And then I found you.

16
00:00:43,337 --> 00:00:44,671
We found each other.

17
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:55,974
<i>Thirty percent
of the public is hardcore aware now,</i>

18
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:58,060
<i>and know how the system works.</i>

19
00:00:58,143 --> 00:01:00,354
<i>And we don't do anything about it.</i>

20
00:01:00,437 --> 00:01:04,358
<i>And that's why superterrorists
continue to invade America.</i>

21
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:07,486
<i>Illegal immigrants
pour into this country every day.</i>

22
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:09,571
<i>Any one of them
could be a superterrorist.</i>

23
00:01:09,655 --> 00:01:11,907
<i>Many are calling for more superheroes,</i>

24
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,618
<i>in order to counter
the superterrorist threat</i>

25
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:16,245
<i>and protect Americans.</i>

26
00:01:16,328 --> 00:01:18,747
- I gotta go. I'm late for class.
- Thanks.

27
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,291
- Have a good day, hon.
<i>- All of us need to stand up.</i>

28
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:24,878
<i>I'm sick of waiting
for some executive to finish racquet...</i>

29
00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:28,590
<i>We are going to hold hearings
on Vought and Compound V.</i>

30
00:01:28,674 --> 00:01:30,008
That's $1.45.

31
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:33,470
<i>I'm gonna tell you something I shouldn't.</i>

32
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:36,223
<i>Something the government
doesn't want you...</i>

33
00:01:37,057 --> 00:01:39,434
<i>And they want more superterrorists.</i>

34
00:01:39,518 --> 00:01:42,271
<i>People are pointing out,
the rush to judgement by the left...</i>

35
00:01:42,354 --> 00:01:44,874
<i>- Victoria Neuman's accusation...
- No offence...</i>

36
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:45,899
Have a good day, hon.

37
00:01:45,983 --> 00:01:49,194
<i>Why does it matter
what some supervillain-loving snowflake...</i>

38
00:01:49,278 --> 00:01:52,114
<i>Every minute we waste,</i>

39
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:54,866
<i>one superterrorist
has already gotten through.</i>

40
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,160
<i>- More will come.</i>
- $12.45.

41
00:01:57,244 --> 00:01:59,162
<i>And, I mean, for all we know,</i>

42
00:02:00,455 --> 00:02:02,708
<i>these maniacs
could've already flown over our borders.</i>

43
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,252
<i>- And be standing next to you.</i>
- You all right, pal?

44
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:07,587
<i>- Waiting for the chance to kill.</i>
- Yeah.

45
00:02:07,671 --> 00:02:11,508
<i>Keep America safe again.
I am so glad that I was there this time.</i>

46
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,347
<i>- I am counting on you.</i>
- Have a good day, hon.

47
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:19,558
<i>- Every minute we wait...
- No, it's up to us.</i>

48
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:22,060
<i>We have to make our voices heard...</i>

49
00:02:30,235 --> 00:02:33,572
<i>I am counting on you to show us the way.</i>

50
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:35,532
<i>Don't let me down.</i>

51
00:02:35,615 --> 00:02:36,700
Hey.

52
00:02:42,873 --> 00:02:44,207
I saw the light in your eyes.

53
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,207
Take the money.

54
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,502
You one of them?
Fucking supervillain?

55
00:02:47,586 --> 00:02:49,212
- What?
- Are you bullet-proof?

56
00:02:49,296 --> 00:02:50,297
No, please.

57
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,007
I have a family. Please.

58
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:05,103
<i>♪ What a wonderful world ♪</i>

59
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:10,484
<i>♪ What a wonderful world ♪</i>

60
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:16,865
Look, I told you. Stormfront
gave the orders. I just executed them.

61
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:17,948
It was, um...

62
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:20,117
It wasn't easy.

63
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:22,204
We can all agree
that you're the real victim here.

64
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:26,291
Let's cut the shit.
Go over it again from the start.

65
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,961
<i>I just left The Seven.
Mr Edgar invited me to his club.</i>

66
00:03:30,045 --> 00:03:33,006
Put away that petulant look
before you hurt someone with it.

67
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,927
I should be chuffed we're pissing away
the best asset we ever got.

68
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,637
- Your plan would be?
- Same as always.

69
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,722
Squeeze the cunt
till he gives up the next cunt.

70
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:42,099
Kill the fuck when we're done.

71
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:45,310
I've no doubt you'd be happy
with that unending cycle of brutality.

72
00:03:46,603 --> 00:03:48,688
How can you
not want blood for what he done?

73
00:03:48,772 --> 00:03:51,400
He's willing to speak
against Vought at the hearing.

74
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:53,693
We've never had Congress on our side.

75
00:03:53,777 --> 00:03:55,112
Congress? Please.

76
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:57,572
What a bunch of corrupt cunts they are.

77
00:03:57,656 --> 00:04:00,325
You're not the first person
to call me a cunt, Mr Butcher.

78
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:02,786
I'm starting to think
it's a badge of honour.

79
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:04,746
Term of endearment where I'm from.

80
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,830
Hmm.

81
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:07,707
Well?

82
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,876
Opposition will have a field day with him.

83
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,169
Disgruntled ex-Supe.

84
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:14,506
I'm sure he's fucked
half the Sacred Heart cheerleaders.

85
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:17,259
But, yeah, he'll be a good witness.
It's not enough, though.

86
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:20,887
Not enough? If torturing and burning
a bunch of mentals on Vought's say-so

87
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:23,807
ain't enough for you,
then what are you good for?

88
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,933
A strongly worded tweet?

89
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:26,810
You're a wanted felon. We don't need you.

90
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:28,270
Yes, we do, Lisa.

91
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:30,647
Mr Butcher has fought Vought
harder than we have.

92
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,232
But I would like a turn,

93
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:35,068
if we can trust each other.

94
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:37,279
I think we can.

95
00:04:37,362 --> 00:04:38,864
- Trust each other.
- Hold still.

96
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:40,323
What do you need?

97
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:44,578
We know what they were doing
at Sage Grove, but we don't know why.

98
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:46,746
Why test Compound V on patients?

99
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,207
What do they want?
I need the full picture.

100
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:52,711
If we take a shot at the king,
we can't fucking miss.

101
00:04:53,295 --> 00:04:56,882
We know someone
who might know the full picture.

102
00:04:56,965 --> 00:04:58,550
Well, that's fucking rich.

103
00:04:58,633 --> 00:04:59,633
Who is it?

104
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:03,221
Like you said,
we're gonna have to trust each other.

105
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:09,311
Would you like a coffee?

106
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:10,896
Um, no, thanks.

107
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:14,608
How about a white chocolate unicorn frap?
They're really good.

108
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:16,318
- No.
- I'll get one to share.

109
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:19,404
Mom, I don't want
a fucking unicorn frappé.

110
00:05:19,488 --> 00:05:21,239
Okay, sorry.

111
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:25,535
Just nervous.

112
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:28,997
When did you get to town?

113
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:32,167
I never left.

114
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:35,170
I'm staying at the Days Inn in Newark.

115
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:37,589
I'm not leaving until we talk this out.

116
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:39,925
I know what I've done to you.

117
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,260
Believe me, I know.

118
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:44,346
Mom, it's not just you.

119
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:45,429
It's...

120
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:49,392
Do you remember that...

121
00:05:51,353 --> 00:05:53,522
cross you gave me for confirmation?

122
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:58,068
Before every save that I went on,
I would touch it.

123
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:02,989
Like a football player
leaving a locker room.

124
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:06,785
I thought that God
was sending me on a mission.

125
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:10,038
I feel so stupid.

126
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:14,459
I gave my whole life to nothing.

127
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,170
- That's not true.
- Mom.

128
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:19,673
The good guys don't win.

129
00:06:20,257 --> 00:06:22,717
The bad guys don't get punished.

130
00:06:22,801 --> 00:06:26,304
What we do means nothing,
it's just all for money, and...

131
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:31,643
I'm in the middle of all of it.

132
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:33,770
Alone.

133
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:36,147
Honey, you're not alone.

134
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:37,231
You're not.

135
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,986
Let's go away. You and me.

136
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:43,780
Let's get away from all of this.
Get away from Vought.

137
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:45,490
Escape for a while.

138
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,784
I cleared it already.

139
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:50,954
You cleared what?

140
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:52,664
With Ashley at Vought.

141
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:54,040
You called them?

142
00:06:54,124 --> 00:06:55,625
About an hour ago. Why?

143
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:56,876
They could be looking...

144
00:07:00,255 --> 00:07:01,255
Mom!

145
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:12,684
Colonel, you think
the congresswoman is in danger?

146
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:14,311
She has her security detail.

147
00:07:14,394 --> 00:07:16,855
Which will be useless if a Supe drops in.

148
00:07:18,398 --> 00:07:20,108
She's our best chance to nail Vought,

149
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:22,819
but only
if you keep her alive until the hearing.

150
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:26,947
And Serge?

151
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:30,910
No abandoning your post this time.

152
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:40,294
Hey.

153
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:43,256
I'm all right. I'm coming with you.

154
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,342
You're in no shape to go anywhere.

155
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,887
Besides, we got
a very important job for you.

156
00:07:49,429 --> 00:07:52,557
We need you
to look after our star witness.

157
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:55,685
Hey, you guys wanna watch
<i>Deep Does It in the Blowhole?</i>

158
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:56,853
<i>Ready to get wet?</i>

159
00:07:56,936 --> 00:07:59,356
- I don't wanna watch that film.
<i>- Yeah, you are.</i>

160
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,274
It's a classic. You'll love it.

161
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:04,277
Butcher, let's go.

162
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:09,073
Hello, Mum.

163
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:12,494
<i>Hey, Billy,
you ain't been picking up.</i>

164
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:14,537
We're in a meeting.

165
00:08:15,205 --> 00:08:16,581
<i>I'm in New York.</i>

166
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:22,379
Look, I told Judy
to tell you not to fucking come.

167
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:25,423
<i>- Language.</i>
- It's a bleeding expensive plane ticket.

168
00:08:25,507 --> 00:08:27,676
- I ain't got time to just...
<i>- Billy.</i>

169
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,260
<i>He's dead.</i>

170
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:30,762
<i>Your father's dead.</i>

171
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:35,432
<i>You there?</i>

172
00:08:35,475 --> 00:08:36,893
When did that happen?

173
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:38,353
<i>Can I see you, please?</i>

174
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:41,272
<i>I need to see you right now.</i>

175
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:05,046
Let me out!

176
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:07,799
Come on.

177
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:19,436
Please, let me out.

178
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,146
Please, let me out.

179
00:09:21,813 --> 00:09:22,813
Please.

180
00:09:22,856 --> 00:09:25,900
<i>Come on, man, stop. It's not cool.</i>

181
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:30,530
<i>Guess you should've made
your wife cum, snowflake cuck.</i>

182
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:35,869
You don't need the discs.

183
00:09:35,952 --> 00:09:38,872
- You can download...
- What do you wanna watch next?

184
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:42,000
<i>Translucent the Invisible Cock.</i>

185
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,294
<i>Queen Maeve Pleasure Slave.</i>

186
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:46,254
<i>Big Black Noir.</i>

187
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:48,173
Oh, <i>Starlight Pulls an A-Train.</i>

188
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:50,592
I'm good, I'm good, thank you.

189
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:54,179
Okay. Different strokes, man.

190
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:55,972
Don't say that in this context.

191
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:57,932
<i>I should just get up and leave.</i>

192
00:09:58,016 --> 00:10:01,019
<i>But you like watching
Homebanger fuck me, don't you?</i>

193
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:02,979
Look, this isn't healthy, man.

194
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:05,982
You can't watch porn while the sun's out.

195
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:09,652
If I get up at that hearing, I'm dead.
What difference does it make?

196
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:12,529
Okay.

197
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,366
Drop the remote,
or I'll burn your face off.

198
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,502
<i>Fuck your wife like she deserves, cuck.</i>

199
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:28,171
You know I was a prodigy?

200
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:31,090
A fucking prodigy.

201
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:35,386
I lit my first fire at 4,
burned my whole house down.

202
00:10:36,638 --> 00:10:37,639
My dad,

203
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:40,517
he was so proud.

204
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,143
"My son's a Supe."

205
00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:47,857
I was gonna do great things.

206
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:49,817
I almost did.

207
00:10:50,527 --> 00:10:51,569
Now look at me.

208
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,282
I'm like the cuck in the porn,
sitting on the sidelines,

209
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:58,743
while the heroes are out there,
doing the fucking.

210
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:05,375
Know why they left me to babysit you?

211
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:08,878
Because you're useless?

212
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:14,217
My mom, she, uh...

213
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,220
Never mind.

214
00:11:20,932 --> 00:11:23,268
After she was gone,

215
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:27,897
I watched my dad
do nothing his whole life.

216
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:33,820
But, me, I thought
I'd finally found something.

217
00:11:33,903 --> 00:11:36,573
I thought I found what I was meant to do.

218
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,412
But it turns out,
I'm shit at that as well.

219
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:44,455
You're not the cuck.

220
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,668
I'm the cuck.

221
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:50,753
Actually, you're worse.

222
00:11:52,255 --> 00:11:53,464
You're the cuck-fluffer.

223
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:00,930
Hey.

224
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,640
What's up?

225
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:06,853
How are you doing out there?
Good to see you.

226
00:12:09,856 --> 00:12:10,899
All right.

227
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,484
Hey, do me a favour.

228
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:15,653
Who's the real heroes?

229
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:17,655
You are.

230
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:19,908
Heck, yeah. I want to be clear.

231
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:23,369
No one condones the tragic shooting
at the convenience store.

232
00:12:23,453 --> 00:12:26,414
Our thoughts and prayers go out
to Kuldeep Singh's family.

233
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:29,667
We are making a donation
to Samaritan's Embrace in his name.

234
00:12:29,751 --> 00:12:31,085
Absolutely.

235
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:32,712
Thoughts and prayers.

236
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:36,591
But that doesn't change facts.

237
00:12:36,674 --> 00:12:39,844
This used to be a beautiful country.

238
00:12:39,928 --> 00:12:41,262
- Remember?
- Yeah.

239
00:12:41,346 --> 00:12:45,266
One nation under God, remember?

240
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,561
Right before these godless,
inhuman supervillains

241
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:51,105
started pouring across our borders,

242
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:53,566
and dragging us down into their mud.

243
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:59,072
What do SJWs,
like Victoria Neuman, want us to do?

244
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:02,116
Just let them in,
and give them a cup of iced tea?

245
00:13:03,034 --> 00:13:05,870
- Then punish us for trying to stop them.
- Right.

246
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:07,872
Has there been anyone in history

247
00:13:07,956 --> 00:13:11,084
more persecuted
just for trying to protect their own?

248
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:12,460
- No!
- That's right!

249
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:14,087
We are at war.

250
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,089
- Yeah!
- We need more Compound V.

251
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:19,175
- Absolutely.
- We need more Supes.

252
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:21,678
<i>- More Supes.</i>
- We need more superheroes.

253
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:23,054
<i>More Supes...</i>

254
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:27,809
Now, I've always been honest with you,
you know that.

255
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:29,268
I gotta be honest with you now.

256
00:13:29,352 --> 00:13:34,357
Brings me no pleasure to tell you this,
but we also had a mole in The Seven.

257
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,193
That's right. One of our own.

258
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:39,236
Starlight.

259
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:42,448
I know, I know. It's okay.

260
00:13:42,532 --> 00:13:45,660
She's been apprehended
and she can't hurt anyone else.

261
00:13:46,953 --> 00:13:48,538
I can't believe this.

262
00:13:48,621 --> 00:13:52,792
<i>Put them in. All of them.
I want all of them in at the same time.</i>

263
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,043
Okay, this is insane.

264
00:13:54,127 --> 00:13:55,169
- Hey.
- No.

265
00:13:55,837 --> 00:13:56,963
<i>Fuck, yeah.</i>

266
00:13:57,046 --> 00:13:59,465
<i>Starlight has been conspiring
with the people</i>

267
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:02,427
<i>who murdered,
in cold blood, my brother.</i>

268
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,346
<i>- Your hero, Translucent.</i>
- Oh, my God, fuck.

269
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,765
- <i>If you're just tuning in...</i>
- Okay.

270
00:14:10,018 --> 00:14:11,728
I bet you she's in 42D.

271
00:14:11,811 --> 00:14:13,688
<i>You have reached the voicemail...</i>

272
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:14,772
Butcher, where are you?

273
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:17,316
- If she's still alive.
- Wait, what's 42D?

274
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,987
At the Tower. Supe-proof, mostly.
Steel walls, 6 feet thick.

275
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:21,988
How do I get in?

276
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:23,531
Into the Tower? You don't.

277
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:25,825
Sorry, man, but she's probably dead.

278
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:28,036
There's gotta be something.
A secret entrance?

279
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:30,955
Maybe one or two.
But forget it, man, it's crazy.

280
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,081
Show me. Come with me.

281
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:33,583
You're still fucked up.

282
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,878
- Exactly why I need your help.
- Get your friends.

283
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:39,422
Butcher isn't picking up.
The others are across the state.

284
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:40,882
We gotta go. Now.

285
00:14:42,842 --> 00:14:45,261
Listen, Vought screwed you over, right?

286
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:47,555
They're trying
to do the same thing to her.

287
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:50,308
This shit is over for me.

288
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:52,560
My whole life is over, okay?

289
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:56,522
This is your last chance
to be a hero again.

290
00:14:56,606 --> 00:14:58,608
Come on, do you wanna be the cuck,

291
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:02,153
or do you wanna be
the guy who fucks the wife?

292
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:11,788
Okay, yeah, yeah.

293
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:15,249
Let's go fuck the wife.
Consensually. Come on, come on.

294
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:28,011
Hello, Mum.

295
00:15:35,895 --> 00:15:36,896
You come with me.

296
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:44,320
Now don't hate me.

297
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:45,863
Why would I hate you?

298
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:56,999
I'm sorry. It was my idea.

299
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,210
But you wouldn't come any other way.

300
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,838
No, no, no, don't.
He hasn't got much time.

301
00:16:01,921 --> 00:16:04,465
Not my problem, it's yours,
because you stayed with the cunt.

302
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:06,968
Have I ever asked you for anything, ever?

303
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:21,648
William.

304
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:29,365
What, no hug?

305
00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:31,284
You step one inch closer,

306
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:34,036
and I'll kill you quicker
than that fucking ass cancer.

307
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,288
I'll bet you would.

308
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:39,959
I seen on the news,
you topped that Stillwell slag.

309
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:43,421
It weren't me,
but thanks for your support.

310
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:45,965
Hey, please, please.

311
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:48,092
I just wanna talk.

312
00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:56,350
Two minutes.

313
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:00,687
Ooh.

314
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:05,109
Been following the Ashes?

315
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:08,029
You wanna talk about fucking cricket?

316
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:10,656
You remember the '83 World Cup?

317
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:12,950
I took you to every match.

318
00:17:13,576 --> 00:17:15,870
Leeds, Old Trafford.

319
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:17,038
You loved it.

320
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:19,540
Did you know why I loved it?

321
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,252
You'd get on the piss
with your loser mates.

322
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:26,505
I could fuck off for hours,
and you'd never know.

323
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,090
Let's not do this, then.

324
00:17:28,174 --> 00:17:29,592
Yeah, let's not.

325
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:32,053
I know I was no perfect father.

326
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:35,514
I know I never got a chance
to say goodbye to Lenny.

327
00:17:35,598 --> 00:17:36,849
I don't want that with you.

328
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:39,352
Didn't have a chance
to say goodbye to Lenny?

329
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:41,646
You're the reason he's dead.

330
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:45,483
Let me tell you something, William.
It's a shit world out there.

331
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:48,319
You can't rely on no one but yourself.

332
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:50,863
You either sink, or you swim.

333
00:17:50,947 --> 00:17:54,242
And in Lenny's case, he chose to sink.

334
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:57,954
You don't have the fucking right
to mention his name.

335
00:17:58,037 --> 00:18:00,164
I fucking loved Lenny.

336
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:05,753
But he wasn't hard like you.
That's why you're here, and he's dead.

337
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:08,839
You beat the fucking shit
out of the both of us.

338
00:18:08,923 --> 00:18:11,384
Maybe I pushed you a bit hard.

339
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:13,135
But look at you.

340
00:18:13,219 --> 00:18:15,638
- Get off.
- You afraid of anything? No?

341
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,516
Are you
the strongest bastard you know?

342
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,599
Yeah.

343
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:24,981
Tougher than I ever was.

344
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:30,569
Oh, you're welcome, asshole.

345
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:40,871
Lenny stuck that gun in his mouth
when you couldn't hack it anymore,

346
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:44,625
and you pissed off
to join the SAS, like a right cunt.

347
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:48,087
You're the one who abandoned him, not me.

348
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:56,637
You're a fucking monster.

349
00:18:56,721 --> 00:18:59,056
- It takes one to know one.
- Billy, for Christ's sake.

350
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,725
Pack it in. Pack it in.

351
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:02,351
Stop.

352
00:19:02,435 --> 00:19:05,062
Jesus Christ.

353
00:19:05,146 --> 00:19:06,272
What have you done?

354
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:08,773
See?

355
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:11,736
Lenny could never have done that.

356
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:14,697
Christ, Billy.

357
00:19:16,699 --> 00:19:17,783
Jesus.

358
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,750
- Sorry, we gotta go.
- All right, guys.

359
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,585
Thanks very much.
Take care. God bless.

360
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:28,586
God bless.

361
00:19:28,587 --> 00:19:30,379
- It's a mistake.
- What is?

362
00:19:30,463 --> 00:19:32,465
Keeping fucking Starlight alive.

363
00:19:33,174 --> 00:19:34,174
Yep.

364
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,932
I underestimated her before.
I will not do it again.

365
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:44,018
"Starlight is a Traitor"
is trending number one.

366
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:46,562
We've got a million tweets
in support of Compound V.

367
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:48,814
A common enemy rallies the base.

368
00:19:48,898 --> 00:19:50,483
Just trust me.

369
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:51,776
All right.

370
00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:54,987
And if I can
get my hands on Hugh Campbell,

371
00:19:55,071 --> 00:19:57,782
maybe pull his spine
out the back of his neck.

372
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:00,910
You okay?

373
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:02,661
Yeah, I just, um...

374
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:04,789
Your daughter?

375
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,082
Yeah.

376
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:11,087
Eighty years ago,
she looked exactly like that.

377
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,423
Sometimes it feels like yesterday.

378
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,391
I got something I want to show you.

379
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,145
Want to finish up the backyard?

380
00:20:28,229 --> 00:20:30,689
Okay, I'm gonna put this person...

381
00:20:33,651 --> 00:20:34,985
Hey, guys.

382
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:37,321
Hello.

383
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:40,491
This is Stormfront.
Stormfront, this is Rebecca.

384
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,662
Very nice to meet you.

385
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:47,039
And this, my son.

386
00:20:47,123 --> 00:20:49,041
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

387
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:51,793
Listen, um...

388
00:20:53,421 --> 00:20:56,715
I know last time, I screwed up bigtime.

389
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,467
And I just want you to know,

390
00:20:58,551 --> 00:21:01,387
I'm never gonna
push you that hard again, okay?

391
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:07,643
All right, Ryan,
I'd love you to meet my girlfriend.

392
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:09,145
Stormfront.

393
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:11,730
- Wow, he looks just like you.
- You think?

394
00:21:11,814 --> 00:21:13,983
Are you serious? Those eyes.

395
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:15,317
Hey, Ryan.

396
00:21:15,401 --> 00:21:17,486
Your daddy told me all about you.

397
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,989
- You have superpowers, huh?
- Mm-hm.

398
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:23,742
That makes you very, very special.

399
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:28,873
You are the first natural-born superhero.

400
00:21:29,457 --> 00:21:30,457
Can we not?

401
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:33,043
That's right. Um...

402
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:34,879
Ryan does have powers,

403
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:38,299
but his mom doesn't like
to talk about them, or use them.

404
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:40,384
Can you also let me know
before you just pop by?

405
00:21:40,468 --> 00:21:43,012
He's Ryan's father.
He has a right to see his son.

406
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:45,014
That's very true, but look.

407
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:47,391
We all just have
Ryan's best interests at heart, right?

408
00:21:47,475 --> 00:21:48,391
Yes, we do.

409
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:50,478
I'm sorry I haven't been here enough.

410
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:54,273
Ryan, I'd really like you
to get to know Stormfront.

411
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:56,275
I would.
She's someone I care about very much.

412
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,736
And I think you will too.

413
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:02,781
So I think we'll be around more.

414
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:03,866
A lot more.

415
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:07,077
I want us to be a family.

416
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:14,667
Hey.

417
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:16,795
Empire Wok.

418
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,673
Hi.

419
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:25,012
That was a fraught "hi."

420
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:29,683
I'm going to my sister's for a while.

421
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:35,481
I have a plan.

422
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:37,525
You don't need
to be scared of Homelander...

423
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:38,901
That little girl.

424
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:40,194
On the plane.

425
00:22:42,655 --> 00:22:45,783
What she must have gone through
in those last few moments.

426
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,826
I lie awake every night
thinking about that.

427
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:48,911
Me too.

428
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:50,079
Then I start snowballing,

429
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:52,456
and wondering,
how many other people have you killed?

430
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,333
- What else have you done?
- I had no choice.

431
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:58,087
I'm not blaming you.
I'm not. It is not your fault.

432
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,589
Will you just...?
Will you sit down?

433
00:23:00,673 --> 00:23:01,631
It's not fair.

434
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:05,844
- Will you sit down?
- I wish I were as strong as you.

435
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:07,137
But I'm not.

436
00:23:08,973 --> 00:23:10,558
I just need time.

437
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:22,319
Over and over...

438
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:27,199
you said you wanted to see the real me.

439
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:30,703
This is the real me.

440
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:34,038
I know.

441
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:36,750
I'm sorry.

442
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:50,972
<i>Yes?</i>

443
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:52,850
I'm here to see Jonah.

444
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:55,519
<i>He's not taking any visitors.</i>

445
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:59,315
Tell him it's Grace Mallory.

446
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,035
Goddamn.

447
00:24:11,994 --> 00:24:13,412
We're on the wrong team.

448
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:17,541
Moral compromise
does have its privileges.

449
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:20,919
Grace, I thought you retired.

450
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:23,589
Dr Vogelbaum. I thought you were taller.

451
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:27,801
Sonia, can you get some tea?

452
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:30,137
Thank you,
but we won't be staying long enough.

453
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,849
Ah, yes,
there's that Waspy patrician tone.

454
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:34,849
All business.

455
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,644
What do you know about Sage Grove Centre?

456
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:38,395
Never heard of it. Should I have?

457
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:40,606
Considering Vought's
been doing illegal tests there

458
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:43,651
since you were the CSO,
and they're still doing them to this day.

459
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:45,527
- Seems like you should've.
- Horrible.

460
00:24:45,611 --> 00:24:48,864
Maybe it was
Sonnenshine's project over in R & D.

461
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:51,075
Prick always had a real God complex.

462
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:53,035
Do you recall the deal we made?

463
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:57,498
In exchange for me graciously dropping
certain involuntary manslaughter charges?

464
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:59,124
I recall it was a long time ago.

465
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,710
Doesn't expire
until the statute of limitations does.

466
00:25:01,794 --> 00:25:03,754
Then I guess I'm turning myself in.

467
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:07,549
We don't have to do this dance anymore.

468
00:25:09,468 --> 00:25:10,468
We're both out.

469
00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:14,431
Just a couple of retirees,
shooting the shit on the back nine.

470
00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:16,725
We both know Vought fucked you.

471
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:18,644
Probably put you in that chair.

472
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:21,855
Help us fuck them back.

473
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:23,982
Testify to Congress.

474
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,570
That's my daughter.

475
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:31,699
She took time off from her practise

476
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:33,826
to help a bitter old invalid.

477
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:35,160
I'm sorry to say this, Grace,

478
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:38,831
but you're the very last person
who should be asking me for help.

479
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:40,124
After what you lost?

480
00:25:43,127 --> 00:25:44,503
Do what you like to me.

481
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:48,424
But some things
are more important than the right thing.

482
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:52,761
He's right, of course.

483
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:54,888
You should listen to him.

484
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:58,434
- Ma'am?
- Go back to your wife and daughter.

485
00:25:58,517 --> 00:26:01,270
Nah, I'd just be putting them
in more danger.

486
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:05,524
Ah, yes, the self-martyring bullshit
of the special ops soldier.

487
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,195
I'll get you all on a flight to Nicaragua.
No one sees you again.

488
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,866
When this is done,
I'll take you up on that.

489
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:18,036
But that's the point, Marvin.
It's never done. You just let go.

490
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,873
No justice for your father,
no revenge against Vought.

491
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:24,460
You get nothing, except your family.

492
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:27,546
Go, and never come back.

493
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,715
I wish I had.

494
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:40,267
<i>An angry scene today outside of
Congresswoman Victoria Neuman's residence</i>

M.M.

499
00:26:58,243 --> 00:26:59,243
Yeah, good.

500
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,997
How'd it go with Vogelbaum?

501
00:27:06,877 --> 00:27:08,253
I'll take care of it.

<i>Send her back.
Send her back. Send her back...</i>

Life has always been hard,

504
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:26,688
but I don't remember it
being quite this crude.

505
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:28,440
I get it.

506
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:30,818
What she's doing with her daughter.

507
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:34,696
My papa, when he lost his mind,

508
00:27:35,823 --> 00:27:38,492
my mama,
she kept me cooking with her.

509
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:42,579
Cassoulet, <i>confit de canard,</i>
all the mother sauces.

510
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:49,878
Cooking, it has this way
of giving port in a storm.

511
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:53,047
Did your...?

512
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:56,343
Your mama, she cook?

513
00:27:58,595 --> 00:27:59,596
You know,

514
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:04,184
Irvin Yalom once said, you die twice.

515
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:06,603
Once when you stop breathing,

516
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:11,608
and again when somebody
utters your name for the last time.

517
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:15,279
I'd like to hear about your family,

518
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:17,823
keep them alive a bit longer.

519
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:22,369
If you'd ever like to teach me.

520
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:31,962
Point is taken. Never mind.

521
00:28:48,312 --> 00:28:49,312

00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:14,838
- How's it going?
- Good.

530
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:16,798
Look, I brought you something.

531
00:29:16,882 --> 00:29:19,968
Just to make up
for all the shit I used to do to you.

532
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:24,723
- He knows my name.
- Yeah, okay.

Hey, meet my new bride, Cassandra.
A-Train.

- Nice to meet you too.

00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:32,940
- Thanks, man. It means a lot.
- Yeah, of course.

536
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:33,941
A lot.

537
00:29:33,942 --> 00:29:35,150
- Yeah, man.
- A lot.

538
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:37,611
Sweet.

539
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:39,571
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

540
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:41,198
- Glad you came.
- Happy birthday.

541
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:42,282
Happy birthday.

542
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:44,868
- Happy birthday. Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.

543
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:46,244
So great news.

544
00:29:46,328 --> 00:29:49,623
I've got a meeting
with Stan Edgar next week.

545
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:51,541
- Seriously?
- With Congress up their ass?

546
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:53,251
And all the shit with Starlight?

547
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:56,463
Vought needs trusted,
proven commodities right now.

548
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:58,382
- They need you two.
- Yeah.

549
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:00,300
Still got a few deal points
to talk through,

550
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:03,887
but let's just say,
they should be getting your rooms ready.

551
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:05,514
- For real?
- Honey, this is amazing.

552
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:07,140
Thank you so much.

553
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:08,308
- You're welcome.
- Awesome.

554
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:12,604
By the way, what do you guys think
of Eagle the Archer?

555
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:13,814
He's like a brother to me.

556
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:16,108
He was there for me
when I was at rock bottom.

557
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:18,110
The most kind, loving person...

558
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:20,153
He's a toxic personality,

559
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:24,116
and no church members are
to have any contact with him whatsoever.

560
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:29,496
Right, yeah, no, now that you mention it,
he did seem pretty toxic, yeah.

561
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:31,248
What did he do?

562
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:34,543
Well, he claims
the programme had failed him.

563
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:36,962
But, actually, he failed the programme.

564
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:39,047
- He doesn't exist, understand?
- Of course.

565
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:40,131
Ah.

566
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:41,507
Oh, come on.

567
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,385
I think they're gonna do the limbo.

568
00:30:44,136 --> 00:30:45,262
- Come on.
- Oh, yeah?

569
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:48,473

Me and Mr Marathon used
to sneak college girls in this way.

572
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:02,029
College girls? Really?

573
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:04,114
They were applying. Yeah.

574
00:31:04,197 --> 00:31:05,907
That does not make it better.

575
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:17,294
All right, moment of truth.

576
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:21,339
I'm either still in the system,
or we'll be swarmed by guards with AKs.

577
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:22,423
Wait, what?

578
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:30,223
And boom, bitches.

579
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:32,225
All right, let's go.

580
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:38,189
Maeve?

581
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,901
Hello?

582
00:31:44,613 --> 00:31:46,907
What the fuck is this?

583
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,743
This is not lesbian.
This is not on-brand.

584
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:53,205
We need you ready for Congress,
with Elena sitting proudly behind you.

585
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:54,288
She's gone.

586
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:56,667
- What do you mean, she's gone?
- Elena's gone.

587
00:31:58,126 --> 00:31:59,461
Okay, okay.

588
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:02,672
Elena will be back.

589
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:06,426
She will be back in your arms,
and you will be totally fine.

590
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,387
You're America's second-favourite
lesbian couple after all.

591
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:12,724
You know what?
Let's just take a deep breath, okay?

592
00:32:12,808 --> 00:32:16,269
Let's just take a deep breath here, okay?

593
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:20,899
We curated a coming-out story
that America loves.

594
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:22,984
- It would be really good...
- Ashley.

595
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:29,074
For once in your life,
be a fucking human being.

596
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:34,579
I'm really sorry, Maeve.

597
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:49,344
Michael, that's holding.

598
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:53,056
We're in the middle
of practise, Leigh Anne.

599
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,559
Ooh! You can thank me later, Burt.

600
00:32:56,143 --> 00:32:57,936
This team is your family.

601
00:32:58,019 --> 00:32:59,729
Tony here is your quarterback.

602
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:01,773
You protect his blind side, okay?

603
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:04,025
When you look at him, you think of me.

604
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:06,486
How you have my back. How you have his.

605
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,696
<i>Okay?</i>

606
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:09,364
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

607
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:11,199
Wow.

608
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:16,663
That... That's really something, Ryan.

609
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:19,374
I've done <i>The Blind Side,
Dances With Wolves,</i>

610
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:20,876
<i>Terms of Endearment.</i>

611
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:22,586
All my mom's favourites.

612
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:26,047
So are you into any things that,
you know, kids are into?

613
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:29,467
- Yeah.
- Like <i>NBA 2K.</i>

614
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:30,719
PewDiePie?

615
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,054
What's that?

616
00:33:34,222 --> 00:33:36,558
Or what about one of your dad's movies?

617
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:38,351
You're in movies?

618
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:41,688
I'm in a bunch of movies, man. Let's see.

619
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:45,025
There's <i>Homelander: Origins.
Homelander: Rise of a Hero.</i>

620
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:47,569
<i>Homelander: Darkest Day.
Homelander: Brightest Night.</i>

621
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:49,112
Oh, your dad is so good

622
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:51,573
- in <i>Homelander: Brightest Night.</i>
- Thank you.

623
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:55,410
- Mom, can I see them?
- When you're old enough, we can talk.

624
00:33:55,493 --> 00:33:58,288
Ah, they're PG. He can see them now.
You're old enough.

625
00:33:58,371 --> 00:33:59,831
You're absolutely old enough.

626
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:02,626
For sleepovers, and baseball games,

627
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,336
and visits to Vought Land.

628
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:05,629
Yeah.

629
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:09,216
Did you know that
your dad has his own roller coaster?

630
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:12,135
- Mm-hm.
- Wanna ride your dad's roller coaster?

631
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,803
- Can I, Mom?
- We can talk about it.

632
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:14,971
Whenever you want.

633
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:19,184
I need to speak with you.

634
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:21,394
- We're having a good time here, right?
- Outside.

635
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:24,146
Now.

636
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:31,905
That's a great idea. You two, stay here.

637
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:34,157
- Get to know each other better.
- Okay.

638
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:38,745
I'll show you <i>Dances With Wolves.</i>

639
00:34:38,828 --> 00:34:40,997
- I know what you're doing.
- Nope, you don't.

640
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:43,208
- Yes, I do. I can see...
- No, you do not.

641
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:46,544
You could not possibly understand.

642
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:48,672
I was raised the same way as him.

643
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:51,633
That kid
doesn't know anything about anything.

644
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:54,636
When he sees the outside world,
he's going to panic.

645
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,054
That's gonna fuck him up.

646
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:01,142
I do not want my son to have
to go through what I went through.

647
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,564
His life is different.

648
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,526
He has a mother.

649
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:12,487
I know that
that means something to you.

650
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,822
If you take him away from me,

651
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:17,117
this world will feel
so confusing and frightening.

652
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,785
Yes, but, Rebecca,

653
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:21,913
you are lying to him.

654
00:35:21,997 --> 00:35:23,915
Because I love him.

655
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:28,336
I know a part of you loves him too,
and you want what's best for him.

656
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:32,090
But what's best for him is
to be here with me, with his mother.

657
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:38,054
Look, we have this opportunity
to give him a childhood you never had.

658
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:40,307
We can do that if he's here with me.

659
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,602
Please. I'm begging you, please.

660
00:35:53,111 --> 00:35:54,111
Yeah.

661
00:35:57,324 --> 00:36:00,327
<i>I'm sorry, he's very tired.</i>

662
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:03,788
I understand
he's had a few surprise visitors today.

663
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:05,999
But you tell him he's got one more.

664
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,918
The name's William Butcher.

665
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:24,351
Mr Butcher, I can't apologise enough
for what I've done.

666
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:26,311
But I can't give you the information...

667
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:34,069
But I can't give you the information
you or Grace came for either.

668
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:45,789
What was he like?

669
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:47,956
Who?

670
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,419
Homelander. Growing up as a lad.
What was he like?

671
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:57,467
I'm sure you
don't want to talk about this...

672
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,969
There is nothing I wanna talk about more.

673
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:02,847
And who knows better than you?

674
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:09,979
When he was a little boy,
5 or 6, he was quite sweet.

675
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:12,649
He'd cuddle up to me.

676
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,405
He loved stories about
Davy Crockett, Teddy Roosevelt.

677
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:24,035
Loved the idea of the woods,
the forest, manifest destiny.

678
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:28,998
But I needed him
to be the strongest man in the world.

679
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:31,835
So I went to work on him.

680
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:34,629
He didn't even want it.

681
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:38,633
It was for me.

682
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:43,680
Mm-hm.

683
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,684
And that wasn't your only sin...

684
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:51,229
was it?

685
00:37:53,523 --> 00:37:57,277
It wasn't Homelander
who hid my wife away all them years.

686
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:00,029
It ever occur to you...

687
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:05,243
the pain you cause sorry bastards like me?

688
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:09,414
At the time,
it was barely a blip on my radar.

689
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,794
Tell me, doctor.

690
00:38:16,796 --> 00:38:19,382
What's your radar telling you now?

691
00:38:20,049 --> 00:38:22,385
Do what you want to me,
but I can't help you.

692
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:24,345
My family would be in...

693
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:26,848
Your family's already in trouble.

694
00:38:27,932 --> 00:38:31,853
Because I'm about to go into
that room next door, to your daughter,

695
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:34,481
and I'm gonna bash her brains out.

696
00:38:35,106 --> 00:38:37,358
And then I'm gonna find your two sons,

697
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:40,612
and their wives, and their little kiddies.

698
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:46,367
Your whole fucking family dies today.

699
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:49,369
Or...

700
00:38:50,872 --> 00:38:52,123
you help me.

701
00:38:59,714 --> 00:39:01,841
What's it gonna be, doc?

702
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,260
How...?

703
00:39:06,095 --> 00:39:08,097
How can you be so...?

704
00:39:12,977 --> 00:39:14,354
Oh, look at this.

705
00:39:15,605 --> 00:39:16,605
Thank you.

706
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:20,777
Do you know,

707
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:25,865
I can't remember the last time
I had a good cup of chai?

708
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:30,411
You're a doll.

709
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:47,136
Starting to bleed through.

710
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:49,013
Ah, shit.

711
00:39:49,097 --> 00:39:50,723
This is it, 42D.

712
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:52,016
She's gonna be there?

713
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:17,917
Wait, wait, wait.

714
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:23,548
This is the conference room.
She's not here.

715
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:28,469
They moved my statue?

716
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:30,679
What?

717
00:40:36,603 --> 00:40:39,564
- I wanted to do it in front of my statue.
- Do what?

718
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:52,577
I just wanted to make my dad proud.

719
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:01,210
Oh, no, no. What the fuck?

720
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:03,379
What the fuck?

721
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:08,051
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

722
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:11,137
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

723
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:18,478
<i>Please, evacuate
to the main floor immediately.</i>

724
00:41:23,691 --> 00:41:27,278
<i>Please, evacuate
to the main floor immediately.</i>

725
00:41:38,456 --> 00:41:39,456
Mom?

726
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:50,592
Fuck you, man.

727
00:41:50,593 --> 00:41:52,721
<i>Please, evacuate
to the main floor immediately.</i>

728
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:56,057
Shit, I need his hand.

729
00:41:59,143 --> 00:42:02,605
<i>Please, evacuate
to the main floor immediately.</i>

730
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:12,740
<i>Please, evacuate
to the main floor immediately...</i>

731
00:42:18,663 --> 00:42:21,249
Come on, come on, come on.

732
00:44:01,766 --> 00:44:03,518
Was that an Almond Joy?

733
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:06,062
He has a tree nut allergy.

734
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:24,789
Come with me.

735
00:44:24,872 --> 00:44:27,542
<i>...to the main floor immediately.</i>

736
00:44:34,048 --> 00:44:36,717
Help! Is anybody there?

737
00:44:37,385 --> 00:44:38,427
Help!

738
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:46,810
Where's Annie?

739
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,398
Aren't you
that sweaty young man from Believe?

740
00:44:50,481 --> 00:44:51,732
Hi, Mrs January.

741
00:44:51,816 --> 00:44:53,734
Is that a human hand?

742
00:44:54,652 --> 00:44:56,237
Yes, it is. Come on. We gotta go.

743
00:45:06,122 --> 00:45:07,122
Hughie?

744
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,918
Annie, Annie, Annie.

745
00:45:11,002 --> 00:45:12,837
- Oh, Mom. Thank God.
- Annie.

746
00:45:19,176 --> 00:45:20,219
Hey.

747
00:45:22,555 --> 00:45:23,848
What are you doing here?

748
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,860
How are we gonna get out of here?

749
00:45:37,278 --> 00:45:38,278
I know a way.

750
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,955
All right, dinner's ready.

751
00:45:49,457 --> 00:45:50,457
Assholes.

752
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:54,045
Hey, bud. You ready for dinner?

753
00:45:57,506 --> 00:45:58,507
What's wrong?

754
00:46:01,135 --> 00:46:02,135
You're a liar.

755
00:46:02,178 --> 00:46:04,263
- You lied to me.
- What do you mean?

756
00:46:04,347 --> 00:46:06,474
They flew me up and showed me.
This house is fake.

757
00:46:06,557 --> 00:46:08,225
The neighbours are fake. You're fake.

758
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:10,061
Boy deserves to know the truth.

759
00:46:11,395 --> 00:46:14,190
Hey, listen to me.
We can talk about this, okay?

760
00:46:14,273 --> 00:46:16,567
You must feel confused.
There are reasons...

761
00:46:16,651 --> 00:46:19,028
No, just don't touch me. I hate you.

762
00:46:20,321 --> 00:46:22,865
I think he just needs a little space.

763
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:24,075
Come here, son.

764
00:46:24,158 --> 00:46:26,410
No. No.

765
00:46:26,494 --> 00:46:28,829
All right, he needs his mother.

766
00:46:28,913 --> 00:46:30,915
Don't worry, he'll still have a mother.

767
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:34,210
Hey, Ryan. Ryan!

768
00:46:35,795 --> 00:46:36,711
Hey, Ryan, no.

769
00:46:36,712 --> 00:46:37,964
Ryan, no!

770
00:46:41,175 --> 00:46:44,845
Oh, my God, no, please.

771
00:46:45,429 --> 00:46:48,099
Kid, you are fucking unbelievable.

772
00:46:48,182 --> 00:46:50,518
All you had to do was watch porn.

773
00:46:50,601 --> 00:46:52,395
I didn't know he'd set himself on fire.

774
00:46:52,478 --> 00:46:54,313
- Hey.
- What are we gonna do now?

775
00:46:54,397 --> 00:46:56,315
Butcher? It's me.

776
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:01,028
No, I'm afraid Hugh let our star witness
burn himself to death.

777
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:02,863
Thank you.

778
00:47:02,947 --> 00:47:04,115
Well, I don't know.

779
00:47:05,449 --> 00:47:09,203
- What do you mean, no worries?
- I mean, I got it sorted.

780
00:47:25,428 --> 00:47:27,388
You gonna stitch me up again?

781
00:47:27,471 --> 00:47:29,015
He's at the airport.

782
00:47:29,974 --> 00:47:30,975
I promise.

783
00:47:31,851 --> 00:47:34,061
You got a right bloody nerve, you do.

784
00:47:34,979 --> 00:47:37,148
I didn't mean for it to go so bad.

785
00:47:37,231 --> 00:47:38,232
I'm sorry.

786
00:47:39,316 --> 00:47:41,027
You won't have to see him again.

787
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:44,739
He ain't got much longer.
Couple of months.

788
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,076
Tell me when it happens.

789
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,703
I'll piss on his coffin.

790
00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:52,580
I didn't do it for him.

791
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:56,751
He's a cunt.

792
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:06,719
I just thought,
when you saw how helpless he is now,

793
00:48:08,429 --> 00:48:09,429
you'd let it go.

794
00:48:11,974 --> 00:48:15,936
He wouldn't have this hold over you,
and you wouldn't become like...

795
00:48:21,734 --> 00:48:22,734
Yeah, well...

796
00:48:25,071 --> 00:48:26,071
Billy.

797
00:48:52,306 --> 00:48:54,642
<i>I told him,
I wasn't gonna cut my mom out of my life.</i>

798
00:48:54,725 --> 00:48:55,726
<i>That's it.</i>

799
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:58,771
<i>And then the Church
and their "Internal Research Bureau"</i>

800
00:48:58,854 --> 00:49:00,231
<i>leaked all this **** on me.</i>

801
00:49:00,314 --> 00:49:03,109
<i>Eagle contends
the Church released a home video,</i>

802
00:49:03,192 --> 00:49:07,113
<i>where his partner was dressed as a deer</i>

803
00:49:07,196 --> 00:49:09,490
<i>that Eagle hunted and mounted.</i>

804
00:49:09,573 --> 00:49:10,825
What?

805
00:49:10,908 --> 00:49:13,119
<i>Church Spokeswoman Carol Mannheim
had this to say:</i>

806
00:49:13,202 --> 00:49:17,331
<i>He's been spreading slanderous
and defamatory rumours about our religion</i>

807
00:49:17,414 --> 00:49:19,125
<i>in a desperate attempt to stay relevant.</i>

808
00:49:19,834 --> 00:49:22,211
Yeah, fuck him.

809
00:49:22,294 --> 00:49:23,629
Thought he was your friend.

810
00:49:24,296 --> 00:49:26,757
Can we change the channel?
The hearing's almost on.

811
00:49:26,841 --> 00:49:28,134
Thanks.

812
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,723
...internal investigations,
but we also hired...

813
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:37,768
Would everyone please take their seat?

814
00:49:38,686 --> 00:49:41,522
- Starlight?
- Nothing. She's off the grid.

815
00:49:41,605 --> 00:49:43,399
- Well, fucking find her.
- Okay.

816
00:49:45,234 --> 00:49:48,028
This bipartisan committee
is called to order.

817
00:49:48,112 --> 00:49:50,698
<i>Investigating Vought International,</i>

818
00:49:50,781 --> 00:49:54,702
<i>and its production
and distribution of Compound V.</i>

819
00:49:54,785 --> 00:49:57,955
<i>- I hereby present to the committee...</i>
- Okay, this is it.

820
00:49:58,038 --> 00:49:59,415
<i>Mr Chairman, if I may?</i>

821
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:04,712
The testimony we'll hear today
will prove that Vought is guilty

822
00:50:04,795 --> 00:50:07,506
of corporate malfeasance
and multiple felonies.

823
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:11,760
And it'll come from someone
that has witnessed these crimes directly.

824
00:50:11,844 --> 00:50:15,389
The chair calls former CSO of Vought,

825
00:50:16,056 --> 00:50:18,267
Dr Jonah Vogelbaum.

826
00:50:22,521 --> 00:50:24,607
Okay, okay, quiet, everybody.

827
00:50:27,776 --> 00:50:28,777
Quiet.

828
00:50:36,911 --> 00:50:38,996
Gotcha, cunt.

829
00:50:40,247 --> 00:50:43,334
<i>Dr Vogelbaum,
thank you forjoining us today.</i>

830
00:50:43,417 --> 00:50:44,752
Raise your right hand.

831
00:50:45,419 --> 00:50:48,130
You swear that your testimony today
will be the truth,

832
00:50:48,214 --> 00:50:50,007
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

833
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,801
- I do.
- Thank you. You have five minutes...

834
00:50:55,137 --> 00:50:56,137
- Oh, God.
- Oh!

835
00:51:07,983 --> 00:51:09,193
Do something. What the fuck?

836
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,205
Oh, shit.

837
00:51:53,445 --> 00:51:55,072
