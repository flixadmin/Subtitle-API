&nbsp

00:00:02,391 --> 00:00:05,485
Despite your feeble efforts
to change the future,

4
00:00:05,495 --> 00:00:05,510
&nbsp

5
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,918
you can't.

6
00:00:06,928 --> 00:00:06,943
&nbsp

7
00:00:06,953 --> 00:00:09,501
Everything's the same.
The future has not changed.

8
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:09,527
&nbsp

9
00:00:09,537 --> 00:00:11,774
If the answers that
we need to stop Savitar

10
00:00:11,784 --> 00:00:11,799
&nbsp

11
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:13,365
and save you are in the future,

12
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:13,367
&nbsp

13
00:00:13,377 --> 00:00:14,664
then that's where I need to go.

14
00:00:14,674 --> 00:00:14,689
&nbsp

15
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:15,868
Caitlin. Somebody help!

16
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:17,197
&nbsp

17
00:00:17,207 --> 00:00:18,578
She's gone.

18
00:00:18,588 --> 00:00:18,603
&nbsp

19
00:00:18,613 --> 00:00:20,986
- Stop. That's not what she want...
- I don't care.

20
00:00:20,996 --> 00:00:36,958
&nbsp

21
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:38,591
2024.

22
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:38,593
&nbsp

23
00:00:38,603 --> 00:00:41,427
According to the future
article in the time vault,

24
00:00:41,437 --> 00:00:41,429
&nbsp

25
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:42,661
I'm still in Central City.

26
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:42,663
&nbsp

27
00:00:42,673 --> 00:00:44,296
There's no mention of Savitar.

28
00:00:44,306 --> 00:00:44,298
&nbsp

29
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:47,900
I'd probably trapped him
in the Speed Force by then.

30
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:47,902
&nbsp

31
00:00:47,912 --> 00:00:49,835
That's the time I need to travel to.

32
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:49,837
&nbsp

33
00:00:49,847 --> 00:00:51,904
2024.

34
00:00:51,914 --> 00:00:51,906
&nbsp

35
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:55,341
If I trapped him, I must've
figured out who he was, right?

36
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:55,343
&nbsp

37
00:00:55,353 --> 00:00:57,044
Iris?

38
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:57,922
&nbsp

39
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,755
What are you doing?

40
00:00:59,765 --> 00:00:59,780
&nbsp

41
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,481
Um, sorry, I was just thinking.

42
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:02,483
&nbsp

43
00:01:02,493 --> 00:01:03,849
About what?

44
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:03,851
&nbsp

45
00:01:03,861 --> 00:01:06,051
Same as you. The future.

46
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:07,688
&nbsp

47
00:01:07,698 --> 00:01:09,555
And my dad.

48
00:01:09,565 --> 00:01:11,237
&nbsp

49
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:13,292
What about him?

50
00:01:13,302 --> 00:01:15,897
&nbsp

51
00:01:15,907 --> 00:01:18,797
I need you to make me a promise, okay?

52
00:01:18,807 --> 00:01:21,169
&nbsp

53
00:01:21,179 --> 00:01:25,104
If things don't go our way...

54
00:01:25,114 --> 00:01:25,106
&nbsp

55
00:01:25,116 --> 00:01:27,431
- if Savitar kills me...
- He won't.

56
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:27,456
&nbsp

57
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:28,507
- if he does...
- He won't.

58
00:01:28,517 --> 00:01:28,509
&nbsp

59
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,909
if he does, Barry,

60
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:31,143
&nbsp

61
00:01:31,153 --> 00:01:34,413
promise me that you
will be there for my dad.

62
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:34,415
&nbsp

63
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:37,082
Don't let him push Cecile away.

64
00:01:37,092 --> 00:01:37,084
&nbsp

65
00:01:37,094 --> 00:01:39,518
Don't let him spiral out of control.

66
00:01:39,528 --> 00:01:39,520
&nbsp

67
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,987
Make sure that him and Wally...

68
00:01:41,997 --> 00:01:41,989
&nbsp

69
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:43,789
Stop, okay? We're not
gonna talk about this.

70
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:43,791
&nbsp

71
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:45,891
You're not gonna die.
I told you, I have a plan.

72
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:45,893
&nbsp

73
00:01:45,903 --> 00:01:48,144
Barry, I need you to promise me, okay?

74
00:01:48,154 --> 00:01:48,169
&nbsp

75
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:49,635
I'm serious.

76
00:01:49,645 --> 00:01:50,965
&nbsp

77
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:52,691
Promise me...

78
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:53,262
&nbsp

79
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:56,068
that you're gonna make
sure that my dad is okay.

80
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:01,375
&nbsp

81
00:02:01,385 --> 00:02:03,242
I promise.

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,854
We, uh... we should go.

00:02:14,864 --> 00:02:14,879
&nbsp

87
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:16,401
- You think?
- Yeah.

88
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:36,068
&nbsp

89
00:02:36,078 --> 00:02:39,655
Oh, probably should've
made that out of carbyne.

&nbsp

91
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,668
Rookie mistake.

&nbsp

93
00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:46,858
You do not want to hurt me, Caitlin.

94
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:46,883
&nbsp

95
00:02:46,893 --> 00:02:48,087
You know, you probably should've spent

96
00:02:48,097 --> 00:02:48,089
&nbsp

97
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:51,223
a little more time finding
a cure for what ails me.

&nbsp

159
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:51,777
Expose her meta-human

177
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,629
I'm gonna run to the future.

178
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:15,970
&nbsp

179
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,870
Wait, what?

180
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:17,872
&nbsp

181
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:20,004
- You want to do this now?
- Mm-hmm.

182
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:20,029
&nbsp

183
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:21,909
Barry, Caitlin is still out there.

184
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:21,934
&nbsp

185
00:05:21,944 --> 00:05:23,409
I know, but we're running out of time.

186
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:23,411
&nbsp

187
00:05:23,421 --> 00:05:26,011
If I can find my future self,
I can find out who Savitar is...

188
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:26,013
&nbsp

189
00:05:26,023 --> 00:05:27,279
how we defeated him.

190
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:27,281
&nbsp

191
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,647
Besides, I can run to the future

192
00:05:28,657 --> 00:05:28,649
&nbsp

193
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:31,216
and be back like I never even left.

194
00:05:31,226 --> 00:05:31,218
&nbsp

195
00:05:31,228 --> 00:05:33,184
All right, what do you need us to do?

196
00:05:33,194 --> 00:05:33,209
&nbsp

197
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:35,454
Just keep everybody else
away from the pipeline.

198
00:05:35,464 --> 00:05:35,456
&nbsp

199
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:38,190
Barry, last time you went to
the future, it was by accident.

200
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,192
&nbsp

201
00:05:38,202 --> 00:05:39,458
How are you supposed to get there now?

202
00:05:39,468 --> 00:05:39,460
&nbsp

203
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,959
With your help.

204
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:40,961
&nbsp

205
00:05:40,971 --> 00:05:42,828
You sure this is gonna work?

206
00:05:42,838 --> 00:05:42,830
&nbsp

207
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,363
I calculated the force
from the explosion

208
00:05:44,373 --> 00:05:44,365
&nbsp

209
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,198
that propelled me to
the future last time.

210
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:46,200
&nbsp

211
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,684
At your fastest speed, you can
create three times that force.

212
00:05:49,694 --> 00:05:49,709
&nbsp

213
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:52,004
It's more than enough to
get me where I want to go.

214
00:05:52,014 --> 00:05:52,006
&nbsp

215
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:53,207
All right.

216
00:05:53,217 --> 00:05:53,232
&nbsp

217
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:55,325
Just run as fast as you can.

218
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:55,350
&nbsp

219
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,684
I'll try to keep up.

220
00:05:56,694 --> 00:05:59,346
&nbsp

221
00:05:59,356 --> 00:06:01,018
Good luck, man.

222
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:42,690
&nbsp

223
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,445
2024.

224
00:06:44,455 --> 00:06:45,459
&nbsp

225
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:47,192
I made it.

226
00:06:47,202 --> 00:06:47,194
&nbsp

227
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:49,719
What is it, throwback Thursday?

228
00:06:49,729 --> 00:07:07,281
&nbsp

229
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:10,382
Haven't seen that outfit
in a while, have we, honey?

230
00:07:10,392 --> 00:07:18,158
&nbsp

231
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:20,862
Haven't seen him in a while, either.

232
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:24,899
&nbsp

233
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:26,993
Guess we get to...

234
00:07:27,003 --> 00:07:27,018
&nbsp

235
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:29,018
relive the past.

236
00:07:29,028 --> 00:07:29,043
&nbsp

237
00:07:29,053 --> 00:07:31,677
Kick his ass like we used to.

238
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:36,416
&nbsp

239
00:07:36,426 --> 00:07:38,466
You've been gone for a while, so...

240
00:07:38,476 --> 00:07:38,490
&nbsp

241
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,920
let me remind you...

242
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:40,945
&nbsp

243
00:07:40,955 --> 00:07:42,499
this is my town.

244
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:42,524
&nbsp

245
00:07:42,534 --> 00:07:44,558
Our town, baby.

246
00:07:44,568 --> 00:07:44,583
&nbsp

247
00:07:44,593 --> 00:07:45,815
That's right.

248
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:45,840
&nbsp

249
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,896
Our town. My mistake.

250
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:47,921
&nbsp

251
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:49,460
Not anymore.

252
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:49,462
&nbsp

253
00:07:49,472 --> 00:07:51,328
What was that?

254
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:51,330
&nbsp

255
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,171
Did you say something, Flash?

256
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,336
&nbsp

257
00:07:54,346 --> 00:07:56,470
You're in for a world of pain.

258
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,540
&nbsp

259
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,265
You better run, Flash.

260
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:03,290
&nbsp

261
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,147
Next time, we're gonna
put him in something

262
00:08:07,157 --> 00:08:07,149
&nbsp

263
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:09,149
he can't get out of.

264
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:50,025
&nbsp

265
00:08:50,035 --> 00:08:51,675
I knew it was you.

266
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:52,550
&nbsp

267
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,060
Cisco.

268
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,917
&nbsp

269
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:58,765
Barry Allen.

270
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:03,475
&nbsp

271
00:09:03,485 --> 00:09:05,936
How did you know I was here?

272
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:06,408
&nbsp

273
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:08,041
I had a feeling.

274
00:09:08,051 --> 00:09:08,043
&nbsp

275
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:11,611
A feeling I have not
felt in a long time.

276
00:09:11,621 --> 00:09:11,613
&nbsp

277
00:09:11,623 --> 00:09:14,080
And so I hacked into
the security cameras,

278
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:14,082
&nbsp

279
00:09:14,092 --> 00:09:16,449
and I saw you fighting
Top and Mirror Master

280
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:16,451
&nbsp

281
00:09:16,461 --> 00:09:18,151
in your O.G. suit

282
00:09:18,161 --> 00:09:18,153
&nbsp

283
00:09:18,163 --> 00:09:19,753
with the white emblem...

284
00:09:19,763 --> 00:09:19,755
&nbsp

285
00:09:19,765 --> 00:09:22,022
2017 edition, of course.

286
00:09:22,032 --> 00:09:24,999
&nbsp

287
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:26,881
Being here...

288
00:09:26,891 --> 00:09:27,331
&nbsp

289
00:09:27,341 --> 00:09:29,064
this is no accident, is it?

290
00:09:29,074 --> 00:09:32,006
&nbsp

291
00:09:32,016 --> 00:09:34,134
I came here for some information.

292
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:34,136
&nbsp

293
00:09:34,146 --> 00:09:36,529
And then I'm... I'm going back.

294
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:36,725
&nbsp

295
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:38,967
What's the information?

296
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:41,812
&nbsp

297
00:09:41,822 --> 00:09:43,109
Oh.

298
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:43,111
&nbsp

299
00:09:43,121 --> 00:09:44,578
Time travel.

300
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:44,580
&nbsp

301
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,246
Yeah, yeah.

302
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:46,248
&nbsp

303
00:09:46,258 --> 00:09:48,415
You say something, you might
mess something up, right?

304
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:48,417
&nbsp

305
00:09:48,427 --> 00:09:50,584
Don't worry, my powers
of deduction have improved

306
00:09:50,594 --> 00:09:50,586
&nbsp

307
00:09:50,596 --> 00:09:52,177
since 2017.

308
00:09:52,187 --> 00:09:52,202
&nbsp

309
00:09:52,212 --> 00:09:53,901
2017...

310
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:58,927
&nbsp

311
00:09:58,937 --> 00:10:00,293
Savitar.

312
00:10:00,303 --> 00:10:02,598
&nbsp

313
00:10:02,608 --> 00:10:04,739
I need to talk to me.

314
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:05,504
&nbsp

315
00:10:05,514 --> 00:10:07,067
Do you know where he is?

316
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:12,374
&nbsp

317
00:10:12,384 --> 00:10:15,709
So H.R. stopped the
S.T.A.R. Labs museum?

318
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:15,711
&nbsp

319
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:19,179
H.R. went on to other things.

320
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:19,181
&nbsp

321
00:10:19,191 --> 00:10:20,614
What about Caitlin?

322
00:10:20,624 --> 00:10:20,616
&nbsp

323
00:10:20,626 --> 00:10:22,182
Once she became Killer Frost,

324
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:22,184
&nbsp

325
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:23,950
she never stepped in
this building again.

326
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,136
&nbsp

327
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:27,854
So I shut down this place?

328
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:27,856
&nbsp

329
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:29,501
My friend, you shut everything down.

330
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:29,526
&nbsp

331
00:10:29,536 --> 00:10:30,991
S.T.A.R. Labs, Team Flash...

332
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:30,993
&nbsp

333
00:10:31,003 --> 00:10:32,425
you didn't want us around.

334
00:10:32,435 --> 00:10:32,427
&nbsp

335
00:10:32,437 --> 00:10:34,361
- So you pushed us away.
- Why?

336
00:10:34,371 --> 00:10:34,363
&nbsp

337
00:10:34,373 --> 00:10:36,663
You said it was because
of what we represented.

338
00:10:36,673 --> 00:10:36,665
&nbsp

339
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:39,265
That we were a constant
reminder to you of what you lost.

340
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:39,267
&nbsp

341
00:10:39,277 --> 00:10:42,746
But you weren't the only
one who lost something.

342
00:10:42,756 --> 00:10:48,828
&nbsp

343
00:10:48,838 --> 00:10:50,661
Are you sure he's here?

344
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:50,812
&nbsp

345
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:53,338
He never leaves this place.

346
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:54,221
&nbsp

347
00:10:54,231 --> 00:10:56,716
Well, what are you doing?
Aren't you gonna come with me?

348
00:10:56,726 --> 00:10:56,718
&nbsp

349
00:10:56,728 --> 00:10:59,180
Man, I shouldn't even be here.

350
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,205
&nbsp

351
00:10:59,215 --> 00:11:01,421
Look, just get what you need,

352
00:11:01,431 --> 00:11:01,423
&nbsp

353
00:11:01,433 --> 00:11:03,430
but don't leave without saying good-bye.

354
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,126
&nbsp

355
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:05,774
All right.

356
00:11:05,784 --> 00:11:50,972
&nbsp

357
00:11:50,982 --> 00:11:53,073
Why are you here?

358
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:57,179
&nbsp

359
00:11:57,189 --> 00:11:59,104
I need your help.

360
00:11:59,114 --> 00:12:10,882
&nbsp

361
00:12:10,892 --> 00:12:13,560
You're from before she dies, aren't you?

362
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:17,110
&nbsp

363
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,093
You can't save her.

364
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:20,435
&nbsp

365
00:12:20,445 --> 00:12:22,725
Yes, I can. And I'm going to.

366
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:22,750
&nbsp

367
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,237
No, you can't. Go home.

368
00:12:24,247 --> 00:12:24,239
&nbsp

369
00:12:24,249 --> 00:12:26,005
Just tell me who's in the suit.

370
00:12:26,015 --> 00:12:26,007
&nbsp

371
00:12:26,017 --> 00:12:27,674
All right? That's all I need.

372
00:12:27,684 --> 00:12:27,676
&nbsp

373
00:12:27,686 --> 00:12:29,576
You tell me that, we'll
be able to track him down.

374
00:12:29,586 --> 00:12:29,601
&nbsp

375
00:12:29,611 --> 00:12:31,187
We'll learn his weakness.

376
00:12:31,197 --> 00:12:31,212
&nbsp

377
00:12:31,222 --> 00:12:34,009
We'll stop him before he even tries.

378
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:34,034
&nbsp

379
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,382
Just tell me who Savitar is.

380
00:12:36,392 --> 00:12:38,720
&nbsp

381
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,386
I can't.

382
00:12:40,396 --> 00:12:40,388
&nbsp

383
00:12:40,398 --> 00:12:42,109
What are you... why?

384
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:46,595
&nbsp

385
00:12:46,605 --> 00:12:48,795
Because I don't know the answer.

386
00:12:48,805 --> 00:12:51,199
&nbsp

387
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:54,000
Sorry you ran all this way for nothing.

388
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:54,002
&nbsp

389
00:12:54,012 --> 00:12:56,329
You want some advice, go home.

390
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:56,354
&nbsp

391
00:12:56,364 --> 00:12:58,236
Spend as much time with Iris as you can.

392
00:12:58,246 --> 00:12:58,261
&nbsp

393
00:12:58,271 --> 00:13:00,203
Because pretty soon...

394
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,476
&nbsp

395
00:13:01,486 --> 00:13:03,851
you'll never see her again.

396
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:13,981
&nbsp

397
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:15,547
You sure you can't stay?

398
00:13:15,557 --> 00:13:15,572
&nbsp

399
00:13:15,582 --> 00:13:17,423
I'm not gonna get what I came for.

400
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:17,425
&nbsp

401
00:13:17,435 --> 00:13:18,992
- Look, we could really use you.
- Cisco...

402
00:13:19,002 --> 00:13:18,994
&nbsp

403
00:13:19,004 --> 00:13:20,593
I mean it. Mirror Master and Top

404
00:13:20,603 --> 00:13:20,595
&nbsp

405
00:13:20,605 --> 00:13:22,996
are not the only villains in the city.

406
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:22,998
&nbsp

407
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:24,998
Barry, we don't have a Flash here.

408
00:13:25,008 --> 00:13:25,000
&nbsp

409
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,446
- Not anymore, okay?
- Well, Cisco...

410
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:27,803
&nbsp

411
00:13:27,813 --> 00:13:29,469
I can't.

412
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:29,471
&nbsp

413
00:13:29,481 --> 00:13:31,437
I'm sorry.

414
00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:31,439
&nbsp

415
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:34,207
Look, it's good to see you in any time.

416
00:13:34,217 --> 00:13:34,209
&nbsp

417
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:35,508
All right?

418
00:13:35,518 --> 00:13:37,250
&nbsp

419
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,819
Yeah.

420
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:38,844
&nbsp

421
00:13:38,854 --> 00:13:40,257
You too.

422
00:13:40,267 --> 00:14:06,585
&nbsp

423
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,042
You okay? What's wrong?

424
00:14:09,052 --> 00:14:09,044
&nbsp

425
00:14:09,054 --> 00:14:10,755
I don't know.

426
00:14:10,765 --> 00:14:10,780
&nbsp

427
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,819
A portal won't open. I can't get back.

428
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:14,062
&nbsp

429
00:14:14,072 --> 00:14:16,216
I can't get back to the past.

430
00:14:16,226 --> 00:14:20,236
&nbsp

431
00:14:20,246 --> 00:14:22,937
- What's happening, Cisco?
- I don't know.

432
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:22,940
&nbsp

433
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,533
Why can't I open a portal?
Wasn't I running fast enough?

434
00:14:25,543 --> 00:14:25,558
&nbsp

435
00:14:25,568 --> 00:14:27,969
Well, I'm not sure. We don't
have the telemetry for the suit.

436
00:14:27,979 --> 00:14:27,994
&nbsp

437
00:14:28,004 --> 00:14:30,408
Okay, well... we got to figure
this out. I have to get back.

438
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:30,432
&nbsp

439
00:14:30,442 --> 00:14:31,961
We're gonna get you
back home. Not to worry.

440
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:31,963
&nbsp

441
00:14:31,973 --> 00:14:34,230
Look, good news... good
news, you can always go back

442
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,255
&nbsp

443
00:14:34,265 --> 00:14:36,531
to the exact time in which you left,

444
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:36,556
&nbsp

445
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:38,882
no matter how long you stay here.

446
00:14:38,892 --> 00:14:40,456
&nbsp

447
00:14:40,466 --> 00:14:42,197
Yeah.

448
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:43,857
&nbsp

449
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:45,968
Maybe it was Scudder or Dillon.

450
00:14:45,978 --> 00:14:45,993
&nbsp

451
00:14:46,003 --> 00:14:48,694
They seemed a little different
than the last time I fought them.

452
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:50,454
&nbsp

453
00:14:50,464 --> 00:14:51,923
I mean, look around you.

454
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:51,948
&nbsp

455
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,571
Everything's different.

456
00:14:53,581 --> 00:14:55,169
&nbsp

457
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:56,550
Except you.

458
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:56,575
&nbsp

459
00:14:56,585 --> 00:15:00,042
Maybe this means we can
get the team back together.

460
00:15:00,052 --> 00:15:00,067
&nbsp

461
00:15:00,077 --> 00:15:03,008
- Why haven't you done that?
- I've tried.

462
00:15:03,018 --> 00:15:03,010
&nbsp

463
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,177
Believe me, I've tried.

464
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:07,926
&nbsp

465
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:11,550
But you see, Caitlin's not the
only thing Killer Frost took.

466
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:18,527
&nbsp

467
00:15:18,537 --> 00:15:21,728
Aah!

468
00:15:21,738 --> 00:15:26,600
&nbsp

469
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,922
No hands, no vibes.

470
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:30,070
&nbsp

471
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,242
And without my powers...

472
00:15:32,252 --> 00:15:33,240
&nbsp

473
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,717
without you...

474
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:38,330
&nbsp

475
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,413
What... what about everybody else?

476
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:41,415
&nbsp

477
00:15:41,425 --> 00:15:42,948
Julian, Wally?

478
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:42,950
&nbsp

479
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,273
Joe?

480
00:15:44,283 --> 00:15:59,256
&nbsp

481
00:15:59,266 --> 00:16:01,433
It's been a while, gentlemen.

482
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:01,435
&nbsp

483
00:16:01,445 --> 00:16:03,635
Especially you, Flash.

484
00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:04,805
&nbsp

485
00:16:04,815 --> 00:16:06,505
More than you know.

486
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:09,130
&nbsp

487
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,429
Allen?

488
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:10,454
&nbsp

489
00:16:10,464 --> 00:16:12,144
Yeah, it's me, Julian.

490
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:12,146
&nbsp

491
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:13,884
From the past.

492
00:16:13,894 --> 00:16:13,909
&nbsp

493
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,767
2017.

494
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:16,431
&nbsp

495
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:18,439
2017.

496
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:19,487
&nbsp

497
00:16:19,497 --> 00:16:21,257
The year it all began.

498
00:16:21,267 --> 00:16:22,656
&nbsp

499
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,109
I'll assume you're here for
some answers then, are you?

500
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:25,134
&nbsp

501
00:16:25,144 --> 00:16:26,781
Something like that.

502
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:27,628
&nbsp

503
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:29,728
Well, you brought him
to the wrong place, mate.

504
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:29,730
&nbsp

505
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,730
I just wanted him to understand.

506
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:31,732
&nbsp

507
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,265
Julian...

508
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:33,762
&nbsp

509
00:16:33,772 --> 00:16:35,500
can I see her?

510
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,338
&nbsp

511
00:16:37,348 --> 00:16:40,132
I tried to find her
something more humane, but...

512
00:16:40,142 --> 00:16:40,157
&nbsp

513
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,289
this is the best I could do.

514
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:42,995
&nbsp

515
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:44,500
Caitlin?

516
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,132
&nbsp

517
00:16:45,142 --> 00:16:46,734
It's me.

518
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:48,742
&nbsp

519
00:16:48,752 --> 00:16:51,216
Barry Allen...

520
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:51,218
&nbsp

521
00:16:51,228 --> 00:16:53,586
- I'm...
- From the past.

522
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:53,611
&nbsp

523
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:55,121
I can tell.

524
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:55,146
&nbsp

525
00:16:55,156 --> 00:16:57,299
There's no hate in your eyes...

526
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:57,324
&nbsp

527
00:16:57,334 --> 00:16:59,007
yet.

528
00:16:59,017 --> 00:16:59,627
&nbsp

529
00:16:59,637 --> 00:17:02,895
So to what do we owe the
pleasure of your visit?

530
00:17:02,905 --> 00:17:02,897
&nbsp

531
00:17:02,907 --> 00:17:06,437
Come to see how things
turn out for Team Flash?

532
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:08,087
&nbsp

533
00:17:08,097 --> 00:17:10,734
I wanted to see what
happened to my friend.

534
00:17:10,744 --> 00:17:11,372
&nbsp

535
00:17:11,382 --> 00:17:14,540
I am not your friend, Flash.

536
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:14,542
&nbsp

537
00:17:14,552 --> 00:17:17,075
I'm so sorry I did this to you.

538
00:17:17,085 --> 00:17:17,077
&nbsp

539
00:17:17,087 --> 00:17:18,510
I should have saved you.

540
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:18,512
&nbsp

541
00:17:18,522 --> 00:17:21,526
I'm glad that you did this to me.

542
00:17:21,536 --> 00:17:21,551
&nbsp

543
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:23,315
Caitlin wasn't.

544
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:23,984
&nbsp

545
00:17:23,994 --> 00:17:25,605
I failed her.

546
00:17:25,615 --> 00:17:25,630
&nbsp

547
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,298
But I won't when I go
back. I'm gonna find you.

548
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:28,323
&nbsp

549
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,156
And I'm gonna help you.

550
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:30,535
&nbsp

551
00:17:30,545 --> 00:17:33,581
You're no match for the God of Speed.

552
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:35,262
&nbsp

553
00:17:35,272 --> 00:17:36,562
Oh.

554
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:39,256
&nbsp

555
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,858
You didn't tell him, did you?

556
00:17:41,868 --> 00:17:43,209
&nbsp

557
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:47,998
Well, secrets always were
our thing, weren't they?

558
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:48,023
&nbsp

559
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,428
When I became Killer Frost,

560
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:50,453
&nbsp

561
00:17:50,463 --> 00:17:54,212
Savitar appeared to me
and showed me the way.

562
00:17:54,222 --> 00:17:55,549
&nbsp

563
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:58,219
We made one hell of a team.

564
00:17:58,229 --> 00:17:58,852
&nbsp

565
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:00,385
Why would you help him?

566
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:00,387
&nbsp

567
00:18:00,397 --> 00:18:03,855
Because he gave me the
thing that you couldn't:

568
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:03,857
&nbsp

569
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:05,757
the cure to my illness,

570
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:05,759
&nbsp

571
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:08,627
embracing who I really am.

572
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:13,901
&nbsp

573
00:18:13,911 --> 00:18:15,801
You know who he is.

574
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:18,906
&nbsp

575
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,405
Who is he?

576
00:18:20,415 --> 00:18:24,513
&nbsp

577
00:18:24,523 --> 00:18:26,612
Tell me who he is.

578
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:29,380
&nbsp

579
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,480
I'll never tell.

580
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,050
&nbsp

581
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,922
You are gonna be so
surprised when you find out.

582
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:39,026
&nbsp

583
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:43,586
You know, I think your protégé
went toe-to-toe with Savitar.

584
00:18:43,596 --> 00:18:43,617
&nbsp

585
00:18:43,627 --> 00:18:45,725
Maybe he can help you out.

586
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:49,329
&nbsp

587
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:50,898
I need to see Wally.

588
00:18:50,908 --> 00:18:51,523
&nbsp

589
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:53,238
Hello?

590
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:53,240
&nbsp

591
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,308
Hi, um, I'm looking for Wally West?

592
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:56,310
&nbsp

593
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,144
I recognize you from Joe's photos.

594
00:18:59,154 --> 00:18:59,146
&nbsp

595
00:18:59,156 --> 00:19:01,680
- You're Barry, right?
- Bar... Barry, yeah.

596
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:01,682
&nbsp

597
00:19:01,692 --> 00:19:04,449
- Uh, this is Cisco.
- Hey, Beth.

598
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:04,451
&nbsp

599
00:19:04,461 --> 00:19:06,585
Hey, Cisco. I'm Beth.

600
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:06,587
&nbsp

601
00:19:06,597 --> 00:19:07,986
Come on in.

602
00:19:07,996 --> 00:19:12,771
&nbsp

603
00:19:12,781 --> 00:19:14,893
I'll be upstairs if you need anything.

604
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:14,895
&nbsp

605
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:16,828
And stay as long as you like.

606
00:19:16,838 --> 00:19:16,830
&nbsp

607
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,997
We don't get very many visitors.

608
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:37,210
&nbsp

609
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,944
Hey, buddy.

610
00:19:38,954 --> 00:19:39,319
&nbsp

611
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:41,219
I brought a friend.

612
00:19:41,229 --> 00:19:45,212
&nbsp

613
00:19:45,222 --> 00:19:47,055
Wally?

614
00:19:47,065 --> 00:19:48,713
&nbsp

615
00:19:48,723 --> 00:19:50,552
Hey, it's me.

616
00:19:50,562 --> 00:19:50,798
&nbsp

617
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:52,698
It's Barry.

618
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:57,659
&nbsp

619
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:59,310
Hey.

620
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,378
&nbsp

621
00:20:04,388 --> 00:20:06,278
Can you hear me?

622
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:11,730
&nbsp

623
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,196
What happened to him?

624
00:20:13,206 --> 00:20:13,221
&nbsp

625
00:20:13,231 --> 00:20:16,222
Iris died, and that...

626
00:20:16,232 --> 00:20:16,261
&nbsp

627
00:20:16,271 --> 00:20:19,291
sent him into this rage.

628
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:19,293
&nbsp

629
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:23,558
And, uh, he went after
Savitar by himself one night.

630
00:20:23,568 --> 00:20:23,887
&nbsp

631
00:20:23,897 --> 00:20:26,455
Joe found him the next day

632
00:20:26,465 --> 00:20:26,480
&nbsp

633
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,644
with a shattered spine.

634
00:20:28,654 --> 00:20:29,503
&nbsp

635
00:20:29,513 --> 00:20:31,069
No one knows what he saw that night,

636
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:31,071
&nbsp

637
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:33,277
but whatever it was...

638
00:20:33,287 --> 00:20:33,897
&nbsp

639
00:20:33,907 --> 00:20:36,365
he's been like this ever since.

640
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:36,648
&nbsp

641
00:20:36,658 --> 00:20:38,464
I'm so sorry.

642
00:20:38,474 --> 00:20:42,855
&nbsp

643
00:20:42,865 --> 00:20:44,888
Listen, Barry, you and Joe...

644
00:20:44,898 --> 00:20:44,913
&nbsp

645
00:20:44,923 --> 00:20:46,513
Where is he?

646
00:20:46,523 --> 00:20:46,929
&nbsp

647
00:20:46,939 --> 00:20:48,386
Well, he's not here,

648
00:20:48,396 --> 00:20:48,388
&nbsp

649
00:20:48,398 --> 00:20:52,015
which means there's only
one other place he can be.

650
00:20:52,025 --> 00:21:07,274
&nbsp

651
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:09,174
Hey, Joe.

652
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:13,475
&nbsp

653
00:21:13,485 --> 00:21:15,513
Why are you here, Barry?

654
00:21:15,523 --> 00:21:18,293
&nbsp

655
00:21:18,303 --> 00:21:20,435
I just wanted to see you.

656
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:20,460
&nbsp

657
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,654
Just wanted to see how you were doing.

658
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:25,276
&nbsp

659
00:21:25,286 --> 00:21:27,482
Now you want to know?

660
00:21:27,492 --> 00:21:27,887
&nbsp

661
00:21:27,897 --> 00:21:30,254
After all this time, now?

662
00:21:30,264 --> 00:21:32,617
&nbsp

663
00:21:32,627 --> 00:21:34,484
Uh, Joe, um...

664
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:34,509
&nbsp

665
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:36,607
I'm doing my best.

666
00:21:36,617 --> 00:21:42,658
&nbsp

667
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,858
What happened to us?

668
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:47,997
&nbsp

669
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:51,196
My daughter's life was taken.

670
00:21:51,206 --> 00:21:51,728
&nbsp

671
00:21:51,738 --> 00:21:53,525
My son's.

672
00:21:53,535 --> 00:21:54,070
&nbsp

673
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,209
And then you left me, Barry.

674
00:21:56,219 --> 00:21:57,139
&nbsp

675
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,840
The last piece of who I was...

676
00:21:59,850 --> 00:21:59,842
&nbsp

677
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:01,646
left.

678
00:22:01,656 --> 00:22:02,044
&nbsp

679
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,184
Turned his back and ran away.

680
00:22:04,194 --> 00:22:07,580
&nbsp

681
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,480
I wasn't there for you?

682
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,991
&nbsp

683
00:22:13,001 --> 00:22:15,956
Why start now?

684
00:22:15,966 --> 00:22:20,663
&nbsp

685
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,063
I'm gonna need you to leave, Barry.

686
00:22:23,073 --> 00:22:25,568
&nbsp

687
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:27,271
Please.

688
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:57,582
&nbsp

689
00:22:57,592 --> 00:22:59,259
You promised.

690
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:00,299
&nbsp

691
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:04,073
You promised her that you
would be there for Joe.

692
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:04,573
&nbsp

693
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,140
You don't understand.

694
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:06,142
&nbsp

695
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:08,742
I don't understand what?
That you abandoned him?

696
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:08,744
&nbsp

697
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,911
That you abandoned
him and everybody else?

698
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:10,913
&nbsp

699
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:13,674
- You made a promise!
- That I couldn't keep!

700
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:13,699
&nbsp

701
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:15,415
Not after everything I lost.

702
00:23:15,425 --> 00:23:15,417
&nbsp

703
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:16,917
I was just as broken as Joe was!

704
00:23:16,927 --> 00:23:16,919
&nbsp

705
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,899
- I don't care.
- You will!

706
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:20,348
&nbsp

707
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:21,789
You will.

708
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:24,226
&nbsp

709
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,260
You want answers, Barry?

710
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:26,262
&nbsp

711
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:27,985
How's this?

712
00:23:27,995 --> 00:23:28,010
&nbsp

713
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,743
You will go back.

714
00:23:29,753 --> 00:23:29,768
&nbsp

715
00:23:29,778 --> 00:23:32,499
You will do everything that
you can think of to save her.

716
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:32,501
&nbsp

717
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,301
You're even gonna create
time remnants of yourself,

718
00:23:34,311 --> 00:23:34,303
&nbsp

719
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:36,370
but he's gonna kill them all, mostly.

720
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:36,372
&nbsp

721
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:39,772
And then on the night of May 23rd,

722
00:23:39,782 --> 00:23:40,334
&nbsp

723
00:23:40,344 --> 00:23:42,910
Iris West will die in your arms.

724
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:42,912
&nbsp

725
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,378
- No.
- And in that moment

726
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:44,380
&nbsp

727
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,114
that she takes her last breath,

728
00:23:47,124 --> 00:23:47,116
&nbsp

729
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,975
it'll feel like an eternity.

730
00:23:49,985 --> 00:23:50,753
&nbsp

731
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,295
And it will break you.

732
00:23:53,305 --> 00:23:54,256
&nbsp

733
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,790
She's the love of your life, Barry.

734
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:01,664
&nbsp

735
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:04,164
She was the love of my life.

736
00:24:04,174 --> 00:24:11,106
&nbsp

737
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,474
There'll be nothing left
at all but stopping Savitar.

738
00:24:14,484 --> 00:24:16,955
&nbsp

739
00:24:16,965 --> 00:24:19,279
So no, you won't be there for Joe.

740
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:19,281
&nbsp

741
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,892
You won't be there when
Caitlin becomes Killer Frost.

742
00:24:22,902 --> 00:24:23,307
&nbsp

743
00:24:23,317 --> 00:24:26,463
When Savitar destroys Wally.

744
00:24:26,473 --> 00:24:27,007
&nbsp

745
00:24:27,017 --> 00:24:29,580
You won't be there for any of them.

746
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:29,721
&nbsp

747
00:24:29,731 --> 00:24:32,559
But then one day, you'll stop him.

748
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:32,561
&nbsp

749
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:35,510
You'll lock him in the
Speed Force forever.

750
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,999
&nbsp

751
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,010
But at that point...

752
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:39,368
&nbsp

753
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,228
he already won.

754
00:24:41,238 --> 00:24:42,322
&nbsp

755
00:24:42,332 --> 00:24:45,706
Because everything that
you've ever loved is gone.

756
00:24:45,716 --> 00:24:45,708
&nbsp

757
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,608
Including you.

758
00:24:47,618 --> 00:24:50,800
&nbsp

759
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,049
Go home, Barry.

760
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:53,515
&nbsp

761
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,749
There's nothing for you here.

762
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:08,081
&nbsp

763
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:09,747
Cisco.

764
00:25:09,757 --> 00:25:09,749
&nbsp

765
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:11,082
Did you figure out
what's keeping me here?

766
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:11,084
&nbsp

767
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,851
I need to go home.

768
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:12,853
&nbsp

769
00:25:12,863 --> 00:25:14,185
What?

770
00:25:14,195 --> 00:25:14,187
&nbsp

771
00:25:14,197 --> 00:25:15,687
You're leaving? Now?

772
00:25:15,697 --> 00:25:15,689
&nbsp

773
00:25:15,699 --> 00:25:17,355
He's... he's...

774
00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:17,357
&nbsp

775
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:19,457
he's not gonna help
me, man. He's broken.

776
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:19,482
&nbsp

777
00:25:19,492 --> 00:25:20,851
And if Caitlin's working with Savitar,

778
00:25:20,861 --> 00:25:20,876
&nbsp

779
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,743
I need to get back. I need...

780
00:25:22,753 --> 00:25:22,768
&nbsp

781
00:25:22,778 --> 00:25:24,229
before she's lost to us forever.

782
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:24,231
&nbsp

783
00:25:24,241 --> 00:25:25,601
What about everyone else?

784
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:25,626
&nbsp

785
00:25:25,636 --> 00:25:28,313
- Don't you want to help them?
- I can't help them.

786
00:25:28,323 --> 00:25:29,634
&nbsp

787
00:25:29,644 --> 00:25:31,703
I should've known.

788
00:25:31,713 --> 00:25:31,705
&nbsp

789
00:25:31,715 --> 00:25:33,905
No matter what I do,

790
00:25:33,915 --> 00:25:33,907
&nbsp

791
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:36,774
you're gonna abandon
the ones close to you.

792
00:25:36,784 --> 00:25:37,210
&nbsp

793
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,576
Cisco, it's not like that.

794
00:25:38,586 --> 00:25:38,578
&nbsp

795
00:25:38,588 --> 00:25:40,879
I just... I can't stay here.

796
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:44,718
&nbsp

797
00:25:44,728 --> 00:25:46,931
But you want me to.

798
00:25:46,941 --> 00:25:47,478
&nbsp

799
00:25:47,488 --> 00:25:49,640
To get the team back together.

800
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,931
&nbsp

801
00:25:52,941 --> 00:25:55,560
It wasn't Mirror Master or
Top that did something to me.

802
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:55,562
&nbsp

803
00:25:55,572 --> 00:25:58,129
It was you, wasn't it?

804
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,066
&nbsp

805
00:26:00,076 --> 00:26:01,993
Yeah.

806
00:26:02,003 --> 00:26:02,502
&nbsp

807
00:26:02,512 --> 00:26:04,359
What did you do?

808
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:10,407
&nbsp

809
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:13,719
You know the resonance field
you create when you run?

810
00:26:13,729 --> 00:26:14,786
&nbsp

811
00:26:14,796 --> 00:26:16,886
This disrupts that.

812
00:26:16,896 --> 00:26:20,720
&nbsp

813
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,287
I might not be able to use my powers,

814
00:26:22,297 --> 00:26:22,289
&nbsp

815
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:24,828
but I still know something about tech.

816
00:26:24,838 --> 00:26:26,693
&nbsp

817
00:26:26,703 --> 00:26:28,626
Why would you keep me here?

818
00:26:28,636 --> 00:26:28,628
&nbsp

819
00:26:28,638 --> 00:26:30,727
'Cause I miss my friend.

820
00:26:30,737 --> 00:26:31,164
&nbsp

821
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:32,597
Cis...

822
00:26:32,607 --> 00:26:32,599
&nbsp

823
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:34,891
If you want to go,
I'm not gonna stop you.

824
00:26:34,901 --> 00:26:35,302
&nbsp

825
00:26:35,312 --> 00:26:36,734
I don't know why I expected you

826
00:26:36,744 --> 00:26:36,736
&nbsp

827
00:26:36,746 --> 00:26:39,470
to be the same Barry Allen I remember.

828
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:39,673
&nbsp

829
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:42,227
That guy still had
some fight left in him.

830
00:26:42,237 --> 00:27:23,883
&nbsp

831
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,416
You were right.

832
00:27:25,426 --> 00:27:25,418
&nbsp

833
00:27:25,428 --> 00:27:27,685
This isn't the future that I wanted.

834
00:27:27,695 --> 00:27:27,687
&nbsp

835
00:27:27,697 --> 00:27:30,853
I can't go back knowing
I let it stay like this.

836
00:27:30,863 --> 00:27:31,540
&nbsp

837
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,954
You want to help me try to fix it?

838
00:27:33,964 --> 00:27:34,794
&nbsp

839
00:27:34,804 --> 00:27:36,937
I thought you'd never ask.

840
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:36,962
&nbsp

841
00:27:36,972 --> 00:27:39,376
Well, let's get the team back together.

842
00:27:39,386 --> 00:27:39,401
&nbsp

843
00:27:39,411 --> 00:27:40,767
Even H.R.

&nbsp

845
00:27:40,802 --> 00:27:43,234
Continuing with the H.R. Romance Series,

846
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:43,236
&nbsp

847

"She, uh..."

874
00:28:21,716 --> 00:28:22,842
&nbsp

875
00:28:22,852 --> 00:28:26,711
"Florence was, um..."

876
00:28:26,721 --> 00:28:26,713
&nbsp

877
00:28:26,723 --> 00:28:28,579
And the mountaintop.
Back to the mountaintop.

878
00:28:28,589 --> 00:28:30,110
&nbsp

879
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,482
"I have to have you..."

880
00:28:31,492 --> 00:28:36,022
&nbsp

881
00:28:36,032 --> 00:28:38,022
Okay, you know what?

882
00:28:38,032 --> 00:28:38,047
&nbsp

883
00:28:38,057 --> 00:28:40,522
We, uh, we should threesome...

884
00:28:40,532 --> 00:28:40,560
&nbsp

885
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,943
do someone... something else.

886
00:28:42,953 --> 00:28:42,968
&nbsp

887
00:28:42,978 --> 00:28:44,241
I think...

888
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:57,077
&nbsp

889
00:28:57,087 --> 00:28:58,810
Julian, H.R.

890
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:58,812
&nbsp

891
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:00,645
What the hell is going on?

892
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:00,647
&nbsp

893
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:03,448
I would like to know
the very same thing.

894
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:03,450
&nbsp

895
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,983
I was about to check one
of the most important boxes

896
00:29:05,993 --> 00:29:05,985
&nbsp

897
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,452
a man can check in his life.

898
00:29:07,462 --> 00:29:07,454
&nbsp

899
00:29:07,464 --> 00:29:09,053
And who... who brought us here?

900
00:29:09,063 --> 00:29:09,055
&nbsp

901
00:29:09,065 --> 00:29:10,555
I brought you all here.

902
00:29:10,565 --> 00:29:10,557
&nbsp

903
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:11,923
Oh, it's you again.

904
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:11,925
&nbsp

905
00:29:11,935 --> 00:29:13,458
Bar?

906
00:29:13,468 --> 00:29:13,460
&nbsp

907
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,661
You... you look...

908
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:15,686
&nbsp

909
00:29:15,696 --> 00:29:17,219
Young?

910
00:29:17,229 --> 00:29:17,244
&nbsp

911
00:29:17,254 --> 00:29:18,830
He's from the past, Detective.

912
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:18,832
&nbsp

913
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,932
2017, to be precise.

914
00:29:20,942 --> 00:29:20,934
&nbsp

915
00:29:20,944 --> 00:29:23,067
I knew something felt
weird in the cemetery.

916
00:29:23,077 --> 00:29:23,069
&nbsp

917
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:25,950
You hadn't visited Iris in years.

918
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:25,975
&nbsp

919
00:29:25,985 --> 00:29:28,200
Yeah, that's what I've heard.

920
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,145
&nbsp

921
00:29:30,155 --> 00:29:32,610
Cisco told me, or showed me,

922
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:32,612
&nbsp

923
00:29:32,622 --> 00:29:35,985
that you all haven't been
a team in a long time.

924
00:29:35,995 --> 00:29:36,010
&nbsp

925
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,449
And I know that I'm the reason for that.

926
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:38,451
&nbsp

927
00:29:38,461 --> 00:29:41,285
Iris's death shouldn't have
driven me away from you all.

928
00:29:41,295 --> 00:29:41,287
&nbsp

929
00:29:41,297 --> 00:29:44,188
I mean... I mean, it
should've driven me closer.

930
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:44,190
&nbsp

931
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,801
This isn't what she would want.

932
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:47,193
&nbsp

933
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:49,746
But I'm here now to tell you that...

934
00:29:49,756 --> 00:29:49,926
&nbsp

935
00:29:49,936 --> 00:29:52,397
no matter what happens in the past,

936
00:29:52,407 --> 00:29:52,399
&nbsp

937
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:54,766
I will not abandon you.

938
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:58,271
&nbsp

939
00:29:58,281 --> 00:30:01,186
- What's that?
- It's a meta-human app.

940
00:30:01,196 --> 00:30:01,211
&nbsp

941
00:30:01,221 --> 00:30:03,959
Mirror Master and Top are at it again.

942
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:04,670
&nbsp

943
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,711
Let's get 'em.

944
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:06,713
&nbsp

945
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:08,613
Us, as in Team Flash?

946
00:30:08,623 --> 00:30:08,615
&nbsp

947
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:11,577
Guys, we have a chance to put some hope

948
00:30:11,587 --> 00:30:11,602
&nbsp

949
00:30:11,612 --> 00:30:13,718
back into our lives.

950
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:13,720
&nbsp

951
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,219
And I...

952
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:17,056
&nbsp

953
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,056
I really need it right now.

954
00:30:19,066 --> 00:30:19,058
&nbsp

955
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:20,872
I think you do, too.

956
00:30:20,882 --> 00:30:23,625
&nbsp

957
00:30:23,635 --> 00:30:25,363
So what do you say?

958
00:30:25,373 --> 00:30:25,365
&nbsp

959
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:28,499
You ready for Team Flash to
take down the bad guys again?

960
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:33,139
&nbsp

961
00:30:33,149 --> 00:30:34,849
Team Flash.

962
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:38,978
&nbsp

963
00:30:38,988 --> 00:30:40,788
Team Flash.

964
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:42,194
&nbsp

965
00:30:42,204 --> 00:30:43,281
On three.

966
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:43,283
&nbsp

967
00:30:43,293 --> 00:30:44,983
One, two...

968
00:30:44,993 --> 00:30:49,047
&nbsp

969
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:50,388
Thank you.

970
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:57,263
&nbsp

971
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:59,263
Baby, you're a rock star.

972
00:30:59,273 --> 00:30:59,265
&nbsp

973
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:01,132
Just like to shine for my man.

974
00:31:01,142 --> 00:31:03,592
&nbsp

975
00:31:03,602 --> 00:31:05,369
Yeah, I don't know.

976
00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:05,371
&nbsp

977
00:31:05,381 --> 00:31:08,206
It looks a little tacky from over here.

978
00:31:08,216 --> 00:31:08,208
&nbsp

979
00:31:08,218 --> 00:31:11,275
But I am old-fashioned.

980
00:31:11,285 --> 00:31:13,716
&nbsp

981
00:31:13,726 --> 00:31:16,091
We told you to stay away, Flash.

982
00:31:16,101 --> 00:31:16,742
&nbsp

983
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:18,818
Yeah, well, I try not
to listen to criminals.

984
00:31:18,828 --> 00:31:18,842
&nbsp

985
00:31:18,852 --> 00:31:21,342
Or stupid people.

986
00:31:21,352 --> 00:31:21,368
&nbsp

987
00:31:21,378 --> 00:31:23,168
You guys hearing me all right?

988
00:31:23,178 --> 00:31:24,246
&nbsp

989
00:31:24,256 --> 00:31:26,680
Yeah, Bar, I can hear
you loud and clear.

990
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,105
&nbsp

991
00:31:29,115 --> 00:31:31,128
Man, it's good to be back.

992
00:31:31,138 --> 00:31:33,111
&nbsp

993
00:31:33,121 --> 00:31:34,848
Well, that's... what the...?

994
00:31:34,858 --> 00:31:36,358
&nbsp

995
00:31:36,368 --> 00:31:37,825
Wh... what are you doing?

996
00:31:37,835 --> 00:31:37,827
&nbsp

997
00:31:37,837 --> 00:31:40,360
- Just... I had a...
- What are you looking for?

998
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:40,362
&nbsp

999
00:31:40,372 --> 00:31:42,095
I just... I found... oh.

1000
00:31:42,105 --> 00:31:43,666
&nbsp

1001
00:31:43,676 --> 00:31:45,519
Now I'm ready.

1002
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:46,105
&nbsp

1003
00:31:46,115 --> 00:31:48,302
Should've done as you were told.

1004
00:31:48,312 --> 00:31:48,304
&nbsp

1005
00:31:48,314 --> 00:31:50,938
Flash, it's two versus one.

1006
00:31:50,948 --> 00:31:50,940
&nbsp

1007
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,406
Odds aren't in your favor.

1008
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:52,408
&nbsp

1009
00:31:52,418 --> 00:31:54,308
I'll take that bet.

1010
00:31:54,318 --> 00:31:56,045
&nbsp

1011
00:31:56,055 --> 00:31:58,574
Give him a little ride.

1012
00:31:58,584 --> 00:31:59,090
&nbsp

1013
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,877
With pleasure.

1014
00:32:00,887 --> 00:32:22,850
&nbsp

1015
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,645
Okay, that's new.

1016
00:32:24,655 --> 00:32:33,599
&nbsp

1017
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:34,949
He can't move.

1018
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:34,974
&nbsp

1019
00:32:34,984 --> 00:32:36,473
They're using their
powers at the same time.

1020
00:32:36,483 --> 00:32:36,498
&nbsp

1021
00:32:36,508 --> 00:32:38,385
- What are we gonna do?
- Can't he phase or something?

1022
00:32:38,395 --> 00:32:38,387
&nbsp

1023
00:32:38,397 --> 00:32:40,324
- That doesn't work on these guys.
- Well, what will?

1024
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:40,349
&nbsp

1025
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,989
Give me that thing in your hands.

1026
00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:41,991
&nbsp

1027
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,457
The other thing.

1028
00:32:43,467 --> 00:32:43,459
&nbsp

1029
00:32:43,469 --> 00:32:45,125
That makes more sense.

1030
00:32:45,135 --> 00:32:45,150
&nbsp

1031
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,996
I can rejigger this to
mimic the resonance fields

1032
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:47,021
&nbsp

1033
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:48,153
from Scudder's portals,

1034
00:32:48,163 --> 00:32:48,178
&nbsp

1035
00:32:48,188 --> 00:32:49,653
make it so Barry can
manipulate the mirrors.

1036
00:32:49,663 --> 00:32:49,678
&nbsp

1037
00:32:49,688 --> 00:32:51,137
- But what about Top?
- This will also restore

1038
00:32:51,147 --> 00:32:51,162
&nbsp

1039
00:32:51,172 --> 00:32:52,848
whatever rarefaction
effect she's causing.

1040
00:32:52,858 --> 00:32:52,888
&nbsp

1041
00:32:52,898 --> 00:32:54,510
Yes, that's good. That's brilliant.

1042
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:54,535
&nbsp

1043
00:32:54,545 --> 00:32:55,746
But without opening another breach,

1044
00:32:55,756 --> 00:32:55,771
&nbsp

1045
00:32:55,781 --> 00:32:58,138
how can we possibly get
it into his hands in time?

1046
00:32:58,148 --> 00:33:00,224
&nbsp

1047
00:33:00,234 --> 00:33:02,184
I'll take it to him.

1048
00:33:02,194 --> 00:33:03,947
&nbsp

1049
00:33:03,957 --> 00:33:06,220
I saw what you were
doing from the time vault.

1050
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:06,245
&nbsp

1051
00:33:06,255 --> 00:33:07,988
You need help.

1052
00:33:07,998 --> 00:33:08,523
&nbsp

1053
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:10,023
Give it to me.

1054
00:33:10,033 --> 00:33:15,651
&nbsp

1055
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,107
Go.

1056
00:33:17,117 --> 00:33:31,742
&nbsp

1057
00:33:31,752 --> 00:33:34,345
Thought it was about
time I did something.

1058
00:33:34,355 --> 00:33:40,628
&nbsp

1059
00:33:40,638 --> 00:33:42,156
Cisco made it.

1060
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:42,157
&nbsp

1061
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:44,357
Now her powers won't affect us.

1062
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:44,359
&nbsp

1063
00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:46,292
We can go anywhere he does.

1064
00:33:46,302 --> 00:33:49,831
&nbsp

1065
00:33:49,841 --> 00:33:53,392
The odds seem pretty even now, huh?

1066
00:33:53,402 --> 00:33:53,635
&nbsp

1067
00:33:53,645 --> 00:33:55,034
Go.

1068
00:33:55,044 --> 00:33:55,036
&nbsp

1069
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:56,447
Go.

1070
00:33:56,457 --> 00:33:59,970
&nbsp

1071
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,474
You mind?

1072
00:34:01,484 --> 00:34:01,476
&nbsp

1073
00:34:01,486 --> 00:34:03,094
Be my guest.

1074
00:34:03,104 --> 00:34:27,412
&nbsp

1075
00:34:27,422 --> 00:34:28,729
Gotcha.

1076
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:40,066
&nbsp

1077
00:34:40,076 --> 00:34:43,315
In a bizarre twist, and
the first sighting in years,

1078
00:34:43,325 --> 00:34:43,341
&nbsp

1079
00:34:43,351 --> 00:34:46,721
eyewitnesses claim not one
but two Scarlet Speedsters

1080
00:34:46,731 --> 00:34:46,746
&nbsp

1081
00:34:46,756 --> 00:34:49,676
were responsible for
apprehending Sam Scudder

1082
00:34:49,686 --> 00:34:49,701
&nbsp

1083
00:34:49,711 --> 00:34:51,426
and Rosalind Dillon,

1084
00:34:51,436 --> 00:34:51,442
&nbsp

1085
00:34:51,452 --> 00:34:53,581
AKA Mirror Master and Top.

1086
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:53,606
&nbsp

1087
00:34:53,616 --> 00:34:56,044
I'm sure I speak for all
residents of Central City

1088
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:56,046
&nbsp

1089
00:34:56,056 --> 00:34:57,620
when I say this:

1090
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:57,645
&nbsp

1091
00:34:57,655 --> 00:34:59,745
Flash, if you're watching,

1092
00:34:59,755 --> 00:34:59,747
&nbsp

1093
00:34:59,757 --> 00:35:01,770
it's good to see you again.

1094
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,598
&nbsp

1095
00:35:04,608 --> 00:35:06,224
Ladies and gentlemen,

1096
00:35:06,234 --> 00:35:06,249
&nbsp

1097
00:35:06,259 --> 00:35:08,399
- Team Flash, back at it again.
- Yeah!

1098
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:08,423
&nbsp

1099
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:09,629
Yeah.

1100
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:09,654
&nbsp

1101
00:35:09,664 --> 00:35:11,924
Yeah, I think this was
a good first step, Cisco,

1102
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:11,926
&nbsp

1103
00:35:11,936 --> 00:35:14,260
but yeah, we have a ways to go.

1104
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:14,262
&nbsp

1105
00:35:14,272 --> 00:35:16,406
Especially me.

1106
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:16,431
&nbsp

1107
00:35:16,441 --> 00:35:18,302
I heard what you said.

1108
00:35:18,312 --> 00:35:18,327
&nbsp

1109
00:35:18,337 --> 00:35:19,893
And you were right.

1110
00:35:19,903 --> 00:35:19,918
&nbsp

1111
00:35:19,928 --> 00:35:21,767
Iris wouldn't have wanted this.

1112
00:35:21,777 --> 00:35:21,769
&nbsp

1113
00:35:21,779 --> 00:35:24,754
She would have wanted
us to stay a family.

1114
00:35:24,764 --> 00:35:25,974
&nbsp

1115
00:35:25,984 --> 00:35:28,140
I broke that promise to her...

1116
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:28,142
&nbsp

1117
00:35:28,152 --> 00:35:29,909
to all of you.

1118
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:30,397
&nbsp

1119
00:35:30,407 --> 00:35:32,678
You made me realize, even
though Savitar's gone,

1120
00:35:32,688 --> 00:35:32,680
&nbsp

1121
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:35,686
I've... I've still been letting him win.

1122
00:35:35,696 --> 00:35:35,917
&nbsp

1123
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:38,284
I was wrong to do that.

1124
00:35:38,294 --> 00:35:38,286
&nbsp

1125
00:35:38,296 --> 00:35:40,780
If you're all willing to...

1126
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:41,322
&nbsp

1127
00:35:41,332 --> 00:35:43,897
try to be a family again...

1128
00:35:43,907 --> 00:35:44,446
&nbsp

1129
00:35:44,456 --> 00:35:46,412
I think I can, too.

1130
00:35:46,422 --> 00:35:50,965
&nbsp

1131
00:35:50,975 --> 00:35:52,431
I don't know which...

1132
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:52,433
&nbsp

1133
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:54,694
which one of you to hug first.

1134
00:35:54,704 --> 00:35:54,719
&nbsp

1135
00:35:54,729 --> 00:35:56,171
Him.

1136
00:35:56,181 --> 00:36:03,878
&nbsp

1137
00:36:03,888 --> 00:36:07,580
Well, I don't know
about you, but... I'm in.

1138
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:07,582
&nbsp

1139
00:36:07,592 --> 00:36:09,220
H.R.? What do you say?

1140
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:09,245
&nbsp

1141
00:36:09,255 --> 00:36:11,571
Yeah, I got a lot of coffee
tastings and some book readings...

1142
00:36:11,581 --> 00:36:11,596
&nbsp

1143
00:36:11,606 --> 00:36:14,186
lot of women left to
charm, but I... I'm in.

1144
00:36:14,196 --> 00:36:14,188
&nbsp

1145
00:36:14,198 --> 00:36:15,588
You know what?

1146
00:36:15,598 --> 00:36:15,590
&nbsp

1147
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,823
Free coffees for the
gang at H.R. Jitters.

1148
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:17,825
&nbsp

1149
00:36:17,835 --> 00:36:20,446
Maybe 10% off. On me, let's go.

1150
00:36:20,456 --> 00:36:26,212
&nbsp

1151
00:36:26,222 --> 00:36:27,867
Thank you.

1152
00:36:27,877 --> 00:36:40,646
&nbsp

1153
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:43,927
- Thank you.
- I know how hard this must be.

1154
00:36:43,937 --> 00:36:44,140
&nbsp

1155
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,619
No, you don't. Not yet.

1156
00:36:46,629 --> 00:36:46,621
&nbsp

1157
00:36:46,631 --> 00:36:48,254
That's the problem.

1158
00:36:48,264 --> 00:36:48,256
&nbsp

1159
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:51,323
And neither of us can
change what's gonna happen.

1160
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:51,325
&nbsp

1161
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:53,893
I wish I could help
you, believe me, I do.

1162
00:36:53,903 --> 00:36:53,895
&nbsp

1163
00:36:53,905 --> 00:36:57,028
But you trapped Savitar
in the Speed Force.

1164
00:36:57,038 --> 00:36:57,053
&nbsp

1165
00:36:57,063 --> 00:36:59,420
Just tell me how you did it.

1166
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,536
&nbsp

1167
00:37:01,546 --> 00:37:02,768
I had help.

1168
00:37:02,778 --> 00:37:02,770
&nbsp

1169
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,737
- Help from who?
- A physicist.

1170
00:37:04,747 --> 00:37:04,739
&nbsp

1171
00:37:04,749 --> 00:37:06,550
Her name's Tracy Brand.

1172
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:06,575
&nbsp

1173
00:37:06,585 --> 00:37:08,708
She made the Speed Force trap for me.

1174
00:37:08,718 --> 00:37:08,710
&nbsp

1175
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,364
Why wouldn't you tell me this before?

1176
00:37:10,374 --> 00:37:10,389
&nbsp

1177
00:37:10,399 --> 00:37:12,556
Because she didn't
figure out the technology

1178
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:12,581
&nbsp

1179
00:37:12,591 --> 00:37:14,548
until four years ago.

1180
00:37:14,558 --> 00:37:16,251
&nbsp

1181
00:37:16,261 --> 00:37:18,250
Four years after Iris died.

1182
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:18,252
&nbsp

1183
00:37:18,262 --> 00:37:19,727
Mm-hmm.

1184
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:25,860
&nbsp

1185
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,348
Hang on.

1186
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:40,259
&nbsp

1187
00:37:40,269 --> 00:37:42,243
I don't know where she is.

1188
00:37:42,253 --> 00:37:42,744
&nbsp

1189
00:37:42,754 --> 00:37:44,710
And I don't understand
anything that's on here.

1190
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:44,712
&nbsp

1191
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:47,484
But that's got all
her information on it.

1192
00:37:47,494 --> 00:37:47,509
&nbsp

1193
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:50,719
Maybe when you go back,
you can find her and...

1194
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:50,744
&nbsp

1195
00:37:50,754 --> 00:37:53,352
I don't know, she can
decipher it for you.

1196
00:37:53,362 --> 00:37:53,354
&nbsp

1197
00:37:53,364 --> 00:37:54,620
I hope so.

1198
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,723
&nbsp

1199
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:57,313
But if not...

1200
00:37:57,323 --> 00:38:00,661
&nbsp

1201
00:38:00,671 --> 00:38:03,860
just make some good memories with Iris.

1202
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,485
&nbsp

1203
00:38:04,495 --> 00:38:07,204
Hold onto 'em as tight as you can.

1204
00:38:07,214 --> 00:38:09,087
&nbsp

1205
00:38:09,097 --> 00:38:10,469
Good luck.

1206
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:15,969
&nbsp

1207
00:38:15,979 --> 00:38:18,579
Weird, it feels just
like "Back to the Future."

1208
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:18,604
&nbsp

1209
00:38:18,614 --> 00:38:21,013
Which would make me Doc Brown.

1210
00:38:21,023 --> 00:38:21,015
&nbsp

1211
00:38:21,025 --> 00:38:22,727
You're not gonna give me
some kind of letter, are you?

1212
00:38:22,737 --> 00:38:24,682
&nbsp

1213
00:38:24,692 --> 00:38:26,109
No, I will not.

1214
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:31,492
&nbsp

1215
00:38:31,502 --> 00:38:33,859
I'm gonna do something to fix that.

1216
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:36,119
&nbsp

1217
00:38:36,129 --> 00:38:39,477
You're too good of a
superhero to lose those powers.

1218
00:38:39,487 --> 00:38:46,159
&nbsp

1219
00:38:46,169 --> 00:38:47,606
Hey.

1220
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:47,608
&nbsp

1221
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:50,063
You know you're my BFF, right?

1222
00:38:50,073 --> 00:38:50,597
&nbsp

1223
00:38:50,607 --> 00:38:51,888
You too, man.

1224
00:38:51,898 --> 00:38:57,351
&nbsp

1225
00:38:57,361 --> 00:39:00,019
Whoa. Wait, did you...

1226
00:39:00,029 --> 00:39:00,021
&nbsp

1227
00:39:00,031 --> 00:39:01,854
Did it not work? Do
we need to try again?

1228
00:39:01,864 --> 00:39:01,856
&nbsp

1229
00:39:01,866 --> 00:39:04,126
No, I went. I'm back.

1230
00:39:04,136 --> 00:39:04,151
&nbsp

1231
00:39:04,161 --> 00:39:06,351
You're back?

1232
00:39:06,361 --> 00:39:06,961
&nbsp

1233
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:09,024
I went to the future.

1234
00:39:09,034 --> 00:39:09,439
&nbsp

1235
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:10,940
How far?

1236
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:10,965
&nbsp

1237
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:12,649
Eight years from now.

1238
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:12,674
&nbsp

1239
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:16,180
I needed to talk to myself
and find out who Savitar was.

1240
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:16,205
&nbsp

1241
00:39:16,215 --> 00:39:17,469
Did you?

1242
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:17,471
&nbsp

1243
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:18,969
No.

1244
00:39:18,979 --> 00:39:18,994
&nbsp

1245
00:39:19,004 --> 00:39:20,835
But I got a lead. Something we can use.

1246
00:39:20,845 --> 00:39:20,860
&nbsp

1247
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,308
Something that'll help us stop him.

1248
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:22,310
&nbsp

1249
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,079
Barry, did you learn
anything about Caitlin?

1250
00:39:25,089 --> 00:39:26,113
&nbsp

1251
00:39:26,123 --> 00:39:28,774
She aligned herself with Savitar.

1252
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:29,829
&nbsp

1253
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,712
Why would she do that?

1254
00:39:31,722 --> 00:39:32,353
&nbsp

1255
00:39:32,363 --> 00:39:33,719
I don't know.

1256
00:39:33,729 --> 00:39:33,721
&nbsp

1257
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:36,822
But we need to find her,
before she's lost to us forever.

1258
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:36,824
&nbsp

1259
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:38,490
All right, I'll get to CCPD.

1260
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:38,492
&nbsp

1261
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:40,594
Yeah, and we'll, uh...

1262
00:39:40,604 --> 00:39:40,619
&nbsp

1263
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:41,971
we'll dive in here, right?

1264
00:39:41,981 --> 00:39:41,996
&nbsp

1265
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:44,129
Right, team? Team Flash.

1266
00:39:44,139 --> 00:39:44,524
&nbsp

1267
00:39:44,534 --> 00:39:46,024
On three.

1268
00:39:46,034 --> 00:39:48,636
&nbsp

1269
00:39:48,646 --> 00:39:50,962
Okay. Okay.

1270
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:50,987
&nbsp

1271
00:39:50,997 --> 00:39:52,687
Joe.

1272
00:39:52,697 --> 00:39:57,482
&nbsp

1273
00:39:57,492 --> 00:39:58,748
I love you.

1274
00:39:58,758 --> 00:40:00,698
&nbsp

1275
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:02,390
I love you, too.

1276
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,852
&nbsp

1277
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:06,685
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1278
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:06,687
&nbsp

1279
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:08,243
I just...

1280
00:40:08,253 --> 00:40:08,656
&nbsp

1281
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:11,056
I just want you to know
that no matter what happens,

1282
00:40:11,066 --> 00:40:11,058
&nbsp

1283
00:40:11,068 --> 00:40:13,766
I'm always gonna be there for you.

1284
00:40:13,776 --> 00:40:14,884
&nbsp

1285
00:40:14,894 --> 00:40:16,829
I know that, Bar.

1286
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:16,831
&nbsp

1287
00:40:16,841 --> 00:40:18,264
I know.

1288
00:40:18,274 --> 00:40:18,266
&nbsp

1289
00:40:18,276 --> 00:40:19,798
Thank you.

1290
00:40:19,808 --> 00:40:30,177
&nbsp

1291
00:40:30,187 --> 00:40:32,294
What was that about?

1292
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,435
&nbsp

1293
00:40:33,445 --> 00:40:36,325
I'm just keeping that
promise I made to you.

1294
00:40:36,335 --> 00:40:55,687
&nbsp

1295
00:40:55,697 --> 00:40:58,638
I've been waiting for you.

1296
00:40:58,648 --> 00:40:58,639
&nbsp

1297
00:40:58,649 --> 00:41:00,787
Fear not, my child.

1298
00:41:00,797 --> 00:41:00,812
&nbsp

1299
00:41:00,822 --> 00:41:04,481
I have come only to
offer you what you desire.

1300
00:41:04,491 --> 00:41:04,506
&nbsp

1301
00:41:04,516 --> 00:41:06,012
And what's that?

1302
00:41:06,022 --> 00:41:06,013
&nbsp

1303
00:41:06,023 --> 00:41:08,279
Salvation.

1304
00:41:08,289 --> 00:41:08,829
&nbsp

1305
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:10,490
You want to cure me?

1306
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:10,515
&nbsp

1307
00:41:10,525 --> 00:41:12,615
Turn me back into Caitlin Snow?

1308
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:12,640
&nbsp

1309
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,963
No.

1310
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:13,988
&nbsp

1311
00:41:13,998 --> 00:41:16,622
I want to make sure Caitlin...

1312
00:41:16,632 --> 00:41:16,624
&nbsp

1313
00:41:16,634 --> 00:41:19,044
never returns.

1314
00:41:19,054 --> 00:41:19,460
&nbsp

1315
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,794
Why should I trust you?

1316
00:41:21,804 --> 00:41:46,287
&nbsp

1317
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:48,152
What do you need me to do?

1318
00:41:48,162 --> 00:41:48,772
