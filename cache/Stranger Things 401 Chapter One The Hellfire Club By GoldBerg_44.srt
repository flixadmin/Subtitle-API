I think I can
speak for all of us when I say

292
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,400
it's been a tough year for Hawkins.

293

So much loss.

<font color="#ff00ff">[EMOTIONAL MUSIC PLAYING]</font>

295

"How much loss can one community take?"

296
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,620

we need something to believe in.

So, last night,

298
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,380
when we were down by ten points at half
to Christian Academy,

299
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,960
I looked at my team,

300
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,970
and I said,

301
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,380
"Think of Jack."

"Think of Billy."

305
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:37,060
"Think about our heroic police chief,
Jim Hopper."

306
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,610
"Think about every one of our friends
who perished in that fire."

307
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,110
"What did they die for?"

308
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,450
"For us to lose
to some... some crap school?"

309
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,530
- "No."
- <font color="#138ce9">CROWD:</font> No!

310

Just talk to Eddie.

325
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,380

330
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,310

- Please, arrive at the point.

If I get in good with these guys,

334
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,900
I'll be in the popular crowd,
and then you guys will be too.

335
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,660
Has it ever occurred to you
that we don't want to be popular?

You wanna be stuck with the nerds

to go to some fancy-schmancy college,
AKA money pit, together?

746
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,950
And yet he's so nervous
about this acceptance letter,

747
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:20,450
he doesn't have time to visit
the most desired girl in Hawkins?

You've been a good boy, man.

753
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,300
And I think it's way past due you give
that right hand of yours a vacation

754
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,510
and get you
some well-deserved hanky-panky.

755
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:39,840
Okay, first of all, Fred, I'm going to try
to forget that you said any of that.

- You don't understand Nancy.

He's not like you.
He's caring and compassionate and...

759
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:51,400
...incredibly ambitious. She's never done
a single thing halfway in her life.

760

He's so protective
over the people that he loves.

761
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:56,780
If she takes on
the editor of the school paper,

762
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,570
she's gonna make that
the best paper that ever existed.

763
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,620
And he'll never back down
from what's right, what's moral.

764
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,370
No matter the pressure,
no matter the personal cost...

- That's why I love her.
- That's why I love him.
