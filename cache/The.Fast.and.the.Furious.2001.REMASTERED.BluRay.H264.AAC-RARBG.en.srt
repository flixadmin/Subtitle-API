1
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,396
Just packed up a real money load,
and it's coming your way.

2
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,648
Look for "Rodgers"
on the side of the truck.

3
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,025
Don't forget my share of the deal.

4
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,117
Shit!

5
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:40,827
Tuna on white, no crust, right?

6
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,537
I don't know. How is it?

7
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,039
Everyday, for the last three weeks...

8
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:47,042
you've been coming in here,
been asking how the tuna is.

9
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,795
Now, it was crappy yesterday.
It was crappy the day before.

10
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,174
And guess what? It hasn't changed.

11
00:04:54,257 --> 00:04:56,218
- I'll have the tuna.
- No crust?

12
00:04:56,301 --> 00:04:57,969
No crust.

13
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,078
Thank you.

14
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:12,087
Talk to me, Jesse.
This ain't working, brother.

15
00:06:12,212 --> 00:06:15,173
It's your fuel map.
It's got a nasty hole.

16
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:16,925
That's why you're unloading in third.

17
00:06:17,008 --> 00:06:18,218
I told you it was third.

18
00:06:18,301 --> 00:06:20,929
I lengthen the injector pulse
a millisecond.

19
00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:24,182
Just tune the NOS timer,
you'll run nines.

20
00:06:31,356 --> 00:06:33,734
What's up with this fool?
What is he, sandwich-crazy?

21
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:35,819
No. He ain't here for the food, dog.

22
00:06:35,903 --> 00:06:38,447
Chill out. He's just slinging parts
for Harry, man.

23
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,907
I know what he's slinging.

24
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,117
He's trying to
get in Mia's pants, dog.

25
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,411
- What's up, guys?
- How you doing, Mia?

26
00:06:44,495 --> 00:06:47,081
- How you living, girl?
- Hey!

27
00:06:47,164 --> 00:06:50,292
Hey, Dom.
You want something to drink?

28
00:07:01,137 --> 00:07:04,640
- He's beautiful.
- I like his haircut.

29
00:07:04,932 --> 00:07:06,225
Vince!

30
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:08,102
Vince!

31
00:07:08,853 --> 00:07:11,397
- What?
- Can I get you anything?

32
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,400
You look good.

33
00:07:17,946 --> 00:07:19,405
Thanks a lot, Mia.

34
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:21,658
- See you tomorrow.
- Sure.

35
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:26,538
- Tomorrow?
- I love this part.

36
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:28,498
Yo!

37
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,584
Try Fatburger from now on.

38
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:34,963
You get yourself a Double Cheese
with fries for $2.95, faggot.

39
00:07:35,046 --> 00:07:36,798
- I like the tuna here.
- Bullshit. Asshole.

40
00:07:36,882 --> 00:07:38,550
No one likes the tuna here.

41
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:40,343
Yeah, well, I do.

42
00:07:52,564 --> 00:07:56,318
Jesus Christ, Dom! Would you get out
there please? I'm sick of this shit.

43
00:07:56,401 --> 00:07:59,363
I'm not kidding, Dom. Get out there!

44
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:05,411
- What did you put in that sandwich?
- That's really funny.

45
00:08:05,494 --> 00:08:08,163
- Dom!
- All right.

46
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,391
Hey, man. He was in my face.

47
00:08:27,475 --> 00:08:29,227
I'm in your face.

48
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:34,273
Relax! Don't push it!
You embarrass me!

49
00:08:36,234 --> 00:08:38,069
Get over there!

50
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:40,905
Jesse, give me the wallet.

51
00:08:43,741 --> 00:08:47,078
Brian Earl Spilner.
Sounds like a serial killer name.

52
00:08:47,162 --> 00:08:49,038
- Is that what you are?
- No, man.

53
00:08:49,122 --> 00:08:51,416
Don't come around here again.

54
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:55,670
Hey, man. You know, this is bullshit.

55
00:08:56,421 --> 00:08:58,089
You work for Harry, right?

56
00:08:58,173 --> 00:08:59,549
Yeah. I just started.

57
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:01,510
You were just fired.

58
00:09:14,106 --> 00:09:17,609
Hey, Dominic. I appreciate
what you did, in a big way.

59
00:09:17,693 --> 00:09:19,820
Dominic, I owe you.

60
00:09:21,155 --> 00:09:23,991
Brian, you're messing
with my business.

61
00:09:24,074 --> 00:09:25,784
When Dominic drives, he's golden.

62
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:28,078
Kids pour in here.
They want everything he has.

63
00:09:28,162 --> 00:09:30,998
Every performance part.
They pay cash!

64
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:32,416
What did Dominic say?

65
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:33,959
You don't want to know.

66
00:09:34,043 --> 00:09:37,296
- What did Dominic say?
- He wants you out of here.

67
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:39,590
- He wants me out of here?
- Yes.

68
00:09:39,673 --> 00:09:40,966
And what did you say to Dom?

69
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,052
What do you think I said?

70
00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:46,097
I told him,
"Good help is hard to find."

71
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:50,560
Relax.

72
00:09:53,563 --> 00:09:55,231
I need NOS.

73
00:09:55,398 --> 00:09:57,692
- I need NOS.
- No.

74
00:09:57,775 --> 00:10:00,570
My car topped out
at 140 miles per hour, this morning.

75
00:10:00,653 --> 00:10:02,739
Amateurs don't use nitrous oxide.

76
00:10:02,822 --> 00:10:05,783
I've seen how you drive.
You've a heavy foot.

77
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:07,410
You'll blow yourself to pieces.

78
00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:08,912
I need one of these.

79
00:10:09,162 --> 00:10:12,999
One of the big ones.
Actually, let's make it two.

80
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:16,169
And, Harry, I need it by tonight.

81
00:11:27,158 --> 00:11:30,870
Well, hold up, hold up.
Look at this snowman right here, man.

82
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,000
Sweet ride.

83
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:38,586
What you running under there, man?

84
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:42,090
You gonna make me
find out the hard way?

85
00:11:42,173 --> 00:11:43,967
- Hell, yeah.
- You brave.

86
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,636
You brave. They call me Hector.

87
00:11:46,803 --> 00:11:49,556
I got a last name, too,
but I can't pronounce it, so...

88
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:52,225
- Brian Spilner.
- Typical white-boy name.

89
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:53,977
You know what I'm saying?

90
00:11:56,563 --> 00:11:57,898
See that over there?

91
00:11:57,981 --> 00:12:01,693
That's mine. My baby but
I ain't cutting her loose tonight.

92
00:12:01,777 --> 00:12:03,695
- Why not?
- Because I'm going legit, homey.

93
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:06,615
Trying to get on the NIRA circuit.
Heard about that?

94
00:12:06,698 --> 00:12:09,493
- Hell, yeah.
- So, what's up with you, man?

95
00:12:09,576 --> 00:12:11,161
I'm just waiting for Toretto.

96
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:14,873
Shit. Better get in line. This yours?

97
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:17,585
- I'm standing next to it.
- That's funny.

98
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:20,504
You know,
Edwin happens to know a few things.

99
00:12:20,588 --> 00:12:24,967
And one of the things Edwin knows is:
It's not how you stand by your car...

100
00:12:25,051 --> 00:12:28,346
it's how you race your car.
You better learn that.

101
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:37,146
Oh, shit. Here they come. It's on.

102
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:54,956
- Dom.
- Marvin.

103
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:59,669
- Hey, Dom. How you doing?
- Hey, Camille. You been doing yoga?

104
00:13:03,757 --> 00:13:07,052
You did? Of course you did. Monica.

105
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:12,099
I smell skanks.

106
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:16,061
Why don't you girls pack it up before
I leave tread marks on your face?

107
00:13:16,144 --> 00:13:17,396
Okay.

108
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:20,440
- Letty, I was just talking.
- Yeah. Whatever.

109
00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:22,276
Okay, Hector.

110
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:24,528
Yeah? What's up, man?

111
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,864
- Yo. What's up?
- Edwin.

112
00:13:26,947 --> 00:13:29,533
- How we doing this tonight?
- One race.

113
00:13:29,616 --> 00:13:31,201
Two G buy-in.

114
00:13:31,285 --> 00:13:34,204
Winner takes all. Hector,
you're going to hold the cash.

115
00:13:34,288 --> 00:13:35,456
Why Hector?

116
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:38,292
He's too slow to
make away with the money.

117
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,713
- Okay. Good luck, guys.
- Hey, wait. Hold up.

118
00:13:42,797 --> 00:13:44,882
I don't have any cash.

119
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:47,176
But I do have the pink slip
to my car.

120
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:51,222
You just can't climb in the ring
with Ali, 'cause you think you box.

121
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:53,182
He knows I can box.

122
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,393
Check it out. It's like this.

123
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:59,021
I lose, the winner takes my car.
Clean and clear.

124
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:03,067
But if I win, I take the cash,
and I take the respect.

125
00:14:03,151 --> 00:14:04,777
Respect.

126
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:08,823
To some people,
that's more important.

127
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,785
That your car?

128
00:14:15,997 --> 00:14:17,624
I see a cool air intake.

129
00:14:17,707 --> 00:14:21,127
It's got a NOS fogger system
and a T-4 turbo, Dominic.

130
00:14:21,211 --> 00:14:26,383
I see an AIC controller.
It has direct port nitrous injection.

131
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:29,594
Yeah. And a stand-alone
fuel management system.

132
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:33,348
Not a bad way to spend
ten thousand dollars.

133
00:14:35,267 --> 00:14:37,018
You see that shit?

134
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:40,897
He's got enough NOS in there
to blow himself up. Period.

135
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:43,650
So, what do you say? Am I worthy?

136
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:45,569
We don't know yet.

137
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:48,238
But you're in. Let's go.

138
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:50,157
- All right.
- Let's go!

139
00:15:54,264 --> 00:15:56,600
What the hell is going on
around here?

140
00:15:56,683 --> 00:15:58,602
Street's closed, pizza boy.

141
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:00,354
Find another way home.

142
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:02,064
God damn street racers.

143
00:16:02,147 --> 00:16:07,110
<i>Log on, 22. Code 3. Tension is high.
They've blocked the street.</i>

144
00:16:52,824 --> 00:16:54,492
Edwin.

145
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,414
This is yours,
whether you win or lose.

146
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:03,001
But if you win, you get her, too.

147
00:17:11,676 --> 00:17:13,511
You're going to win.

148
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:16,431
I'm going to win.

149
00:18:00,643 --> 00:18:03,604
<i>We had a reported homicide.
187, at Barabian Liquors.</i>

150
00:18:03,688 --> 00:18:06,482
I've got a 187 in Glendale.
Cops are all over it.

151
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:08,693
We're good to roll.
I repeat, good to roll.

152
00:18:08,776 --> 00:18:10,236
- All right.
- Let's race!

153
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,863
Right.

154
00:18:20,914 --> 00:18:22,415
Go!

155
00:18:35,887 --> 00:18:37,305
Hell, yeah!

156
00:18:52,946 --> 00:18:54,698
Damn, that guy's fast.

157
00:19:02,748 --> 00:19:05,960
Let's go! <i>Mcnage</i>!

158
00:19:32,153 --> 00:19:36,032
No! Monica!

159
00:19:50,547 --> 00:19:52,132
Shut up!

160
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,648
Well done, baby!

161
00:20:57,615 --> 00:20:59,200
Come on. Back up.

162
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,871
Here's what you won, right here.
There you go.

163
00:21:03,955 --> 00:21:06,708
You were racing a bunch
of skateboards. Know what I mean?

164
00:21:08,126 --> 00:21:11,755
My sister holds the money. Count it.

165
00:21:13,882 --> 00:21:15,800
And you're my trophy.

166
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:21,598
- Hey, Monica. What's up, baby?
- What's your problem, nigger?

167
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:23,183
You didn't win.

168
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:27,270
Fuck you then!

169
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,743
Was that fun?

170
00:21:41,994 --> 00:21:44,246
Got a problem there, buddy?

171
00:21:50,294 --> 00:21:52,046
What are you smiling about?

172
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:54,048
Dude. I almost had you.

173
00:21:56,592 --> 00:21:58,719
You almost had me?

174
00:21:58,844 --> 00:22:02,598
You never had me.
You never had your car.

175
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:08,521
Granny-shifting. Not double
clutching like you should.

176
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:13,067
You're lucky that hundred-shot of NOS
didn't blow the welds on the intake.

177
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:15,987
Almost had me?

178
00:22:17,321 --> 00:22:19,532
You tell him, Dominic.
Get out of here.

179
00:22:19,907 --> 00:22:23,036
Now, me and the mad scientist
got to rip apart the block...

180
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:26,331
and replace the piston rings
you fried.

181
00:22:33,379 --> 00:22:35,882
Ask any racer. Any real racer.

182
00:22:36,132 --> 00:22:39,678
It don't matter if you win
by an inch or a mile.

183
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:40,929
Winning's winning.

184
00:22:41,054 --> 00:22:43,390
Yeah!

185
00:22:47,894 --> 00:22:50,939
<i>All available units, we have reported
street-racing along Hawthorne...</i>

186
00:22:51,022 --> 00:22:53,316
Oh, shit! We got cops...

187
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,943
Go!

188
00:23:06,163 --> 00:23:08,582
Cops! Get in the car! Go!

189
00:24:32,251 --> 00:24:35,045
Toretto, stop right there!

190
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:37,840
Toretto!

191
00:24:52,188 --> 00:24:53,898
Get in!

192
00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:43,615
You're the last person in the world
I expected to show up.

193
00:25:44,616 --> 00:25:48,495
Well I thought if I got in your good
graces, you might let me keep my car.

194
00:25:48,704 --> 00:25:52,416
You are in my good graces,
but you ain't keeping your car.

195
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,878
You drive like you've done this
before. What are you, a wheelman?

196
00:25:55,961 --> 00:25:57,504
No.

197
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,590
You boost cars?

198
00:26:00,841 --> 00:26:03,260
- No. Never.
- Ever done time?

199
00:26:03,344 --> 00:26:06,055
Couple of overnighters. No big deal.

200
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:10,059
What about the two years
in juvie for boosting cars?

201
00:26:12,436 --> 00:26:14,438
Tucson, right?

202
00:26:14,855 --> 00:26:18,734
I had Jesse run a profile on you,
Brian Earl Spilner.

203
00:26:19,318 --> 00:26:23,030
He'll find anything on the Web.
Anything about anybody.

204
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,158
So, why bullshit?

205
00:26:26,325 --> 00:26:28,328
So, what about you?

206
00:26:30,204 --> 00:26:32,498
Two years in Lompoc.

207
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:37,128
I'll die before I go back.

208
00:26:42,842 --> 00:26:45,387
- Oh, great.
- What?

209
00:26:47,722 --> 00:26:50,433
It's going to be a long-ass night.
That's what.

210
00:26:54,229 --> 00:26:55,897
Follow us.

211
00:27:46,407 --> 00:27:48,826
I thought we had an agreement.

212
00:27:48,951 --> 00:27:51,663
You stay away. I stay away.

213
00:27:52,205 --> 00:27:53,790
Everybody stays happy.

214
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:56,125
We got lost.
What do you want me to tell you?

215
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:57,794
Who's "we"?

216
00:27:58,169 --> 00:27:59,420
My new mechanic.

217
00:27:59,504 --> 00:28:01,256
Brian, meet Johnny Tran.

218
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:04,384
The guy in the snakeskin pants.
That's his cousin. Lance.

219
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:08,013
So, when are you gonna give me a shot
at that Honda 2000 of yours?

220
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:09,431
This your ride?

221
00:28:09,514 --> 00:28:11,141
It was. It's his now.

222
00:28:11,224 --> 00:28:13,727
No, it's not.
I haven't taken delivery.

223
00:28:15,854 --> 00:28:17,814
Then, it's nobody's car.

224
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:20,692
But somebody put in the wrench time.

225
00:28:22,611 --> 00:28:24,488
What do you think, Lance?

226
00:28:25,113 --> 00:28:26,823
It's an amazing machine.

227
00:28:26,907 --> 00:28:28,659
Yes, indeed.

228
00:28:30,536 --> 00:28:32,120
Let's go.

229
00:28:34,331 --> 00:28:36,792
I'll see you
in the desert next month.

230
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:38,752
Be ready to have
your ass handed to you.

231
00:28:38,836 --> 00:28:40,754
You're gonna need more than
that crotch rocket.

232
00:28:40,879 --> 00:28:42,965
I got something for you.

233
00:28:56,645 --> 00:28:58,314
What the hell was that all about?

234
00:28:58,439 --> 00:29:01,817
Long story. I'll tell you later.
Let's get out of here.

235
00:29:29,095 --> 00:29:30,722
NOS!

236
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:44,903
So, what the hell was that all about?

237
00:29:45,112 --> 00:29:46,697
It's a long story.

238
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,658
Well, we got a twenty-mile hike.
Humor me.

239
00:29:49,866 --> 00:29:52,619
A business deal that went sour.

240
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:56,331
Plus, I made the mistake
of sleeping with his sister.

241
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:23,776
Take care.

242
00:30:28,489 --> 00:30:30,241
Yo, Spilner.

243
00:30:31,534 --> 00:30:34,287
- You want a beer?
- Yeah, sure.

244
00:30:34,412 --> 00:30:36,331
Oh, shit.

245
00:31:00,021 --> 00:31:03,108
We were all there, right?
Falling behind.

246
00:31:03,191 --> 00:31:05,986
- With all that nitrous.
- Yeah.

247
00:31:12,576 --> 00:31:16,163
Yo, Dom. Hey man! We're just about
to go looking for you, brother.

248
00:31:21,877 --> 00:31:23,128
Where were you?

249
00:31:23,212 --> 00:31:24,505
There were mass cops there.

250
00:31:24,588 --> 00:31:27,424
They came in from every direction.
It was orchestrated.

251
00:31:27,508 --> 00:31:30,594
- This your beer?
- Yeah, that's my beer.

252
00:31:33,055 --> 00:31:35,891
Yo, Einstein. Take it upstairs.

253
00:31:35,975 --> 00:31:38,769
You can't detail a car
with the cover on.

254
00:31:39,478 --> 00:31:41,188
Can't even get that right.

255
00:31:41,272 --> 00:31:42,982
You all right?

256
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:45,901
Am I all right?

257
00:31:45,985 --> 00:31:48,321
It was just a question.

258
00:31:51,157 --> 00:31:52,492
Yo, Dom.

259
00:31:52,784 --> 00:31:54,285
Why did you bring the buster here?

260
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,954
'Cause he kept me out of handcuffs!

261
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,751
He didn't just run back to the fort!
The buster brought me back.

262
00:32:06,756 --> 00:32:11,052
You can have any brew you want,
as long as it's a Corona.

263
00:32:11,136 --> 00:32:14,639
- Thanks, man.
- That's Vince's. So, enjoy it.

264
00:32:15,807 --> 00:32:17,142
You.

265
00:32:24,191 --> 00:32:26,026
Hey, bro. You got a bathroom?

266
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:28,904
Upstairs. First door on the right.

267
00:32:44,503 --> 00:32:47,923
He's got no call being up in here.
You don't know that fool for shit.

268
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,383
Yeah, he's right, Dom.

269
00:32:49,466 --> 00:32:51,760
There was a time
when I didn't know you.

270
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,430
That was in the third grade!

271
00:32:56,765 --> 00:32:58,851
Yeah. So, what girls are here?

272
00:32:58,934 --> 00:33:01,062
- You name it. You want mine?
- You need to shut the f...

273
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,605
You want two?

274
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,733
- You don't have anything?
- You look a bit tired.

275
00:33:05,816 --> 00:33:08,444
I think you should go upstairs
and give me a massage.

276
00:33:08,527 --> 00:33:12,782
- Look at all our guests.
- How about you give me a massage?

277
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,120
Crazy lady.

278
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,084
Yo!

279
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,755
You know you owe me
a ten-second car, right?

280
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,425
Ouch!

281
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,678
Oh, shit.

282
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,560
Did you wipe the seat?

283
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:48,318
Jesus Christ! Would you
cut this shit already? Come on!

284
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,321
Come on. Let's go get me a drink.

285
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,283
Come on, man.
We were just about to get along.

286
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:04,460
- So, what do you want?
- Anything, as long as it's cold.

287
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,297
You know, my brother likes you.

288
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:09,757
He usually doesn't like anybody.

289
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,675
He's a complicated guy.

290
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,928
Yeah? What about you?

291
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:19,350
- I'm simpler.
- You're a shitty liar.

292
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,937
Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

293
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:27,149
- But there's a problem.
- What's that?

294
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:29,610
You need to get some sleep.

295
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:34,323
And you definitely,
definitely need a shower.

296
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,368
Come on. I'll take you home.

297
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:02,268
Show me your hands.
Very good. Now open the door.

298
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:05,855
Put your hands on your head.
Behind your head.

299
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:09,484
Face the front of the vehicle,
walk backwards towards the rear.

300
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:11,945
Take two steps to your right.

301
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:14,030
Stop right there.

302
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,492
What did I do?

303
00:35:17,576 --> 00:35:20,704
Shut up. He's clean, Sarge.

304
00:35:30,798 --> 00:35:33,425
Damn! Muse,
will you take these things off?

305
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:34,927
Shit. You put them on so tight.

306
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,637
I like realism.

307
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:39,181
You never know who's watching, Brian.

308
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:45,396
Nice crib, Sergeant.

309
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:47,314
It's a lot nicer than
the last place you confiscated.

310
00:35:47,398 --> 00:35:49,650
Ain't it? Eddie Fisher
built this house...

311
00:35:49,734 --> 00:35:51,569
for Elizabeth Taylor in the '50s.

312
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:54,488
You see, even the cops
are Hollywood in Hollywood.

313
00:35:58,451 --> 00:36:01,746
Okay, here he is,
fresh from Toretto's hot rod heaven.

314
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:04,332
That was an eighty thousand
dollar vehicle, Officer.

315
00:36:04,415 --> 00:36:06,459
- You told him what happened?
- He knows what happened.

316
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:08,503
You know what? Why don't you
send the bill to Johnny Tran.

317
00:36:08,586 --> 00:36:10,505
- Brian...
- The kid's giving me attitude?

318
00:36:10,588 --> 00:36:13,424
It doesn't speak well
for police-FBI relations, Tanner.

319
00:36:13,508 --> 00:36:14,717
Come on, what it is?
I walk in the door...

320
00:36:14,801 --> 00:36:16,803
- All right...
- and the guy's already...

321
00:36:16,886 --> 00:36:19,347
We'll talk, okay?
Let's talk about it.

322
00:36:19,472 --> 00:36:22,642
Muse, why don't you make us
four iced cappuccinos, please?

323
00:36:22,726 --> 00:36:25,395
- Come on.
- Regular or decaf, Sarge?

324
00:36:26,855 --> 00:36:28,315
Decaf, I think.

325
00:36:28,607 --> 00:36:31,443
Four hijackings in two months,
and we don't have anything.

326
00:36:31,526 --> 00:36:34,196
DVD players and digital cameras alone
worth a million two...

327
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:37,199
which brings the grand total
to six million plus.

328
00:36:37,282 --> 00:36:40,786
We're in the political
crosshairs now, Brian.

329
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:42,788
That's why you're undercover.

330
00:36:43,038 --> 00:36:45,207
You want that
detective badge fast, kid.

331
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,000
And you want to know something?

332
00:36:47,084 --> 00:36:50,879
The FBI can help,
if you come through for us.

333
00:36:51,171 --> 00:36:53,006
What does the truckdriver say?

334
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,299
He gave us the same M.O.

335
00:36:54,383 --> 00:36:56,468
Three Honda Civics,
precision driving...

336
00:36:56,552 --> 00:36:59,722
the same green neon glow
from under the chassis.

337
00:36:59,805 --> 00:37:02,558
Lab says the skidmarks
came back the same...

338
00:37:02,641 --> 00:37:04,435
Mashamoto ZX tires.

339
00:37:04,518 --> 00:37:07,313
So, we know it's somebody
in the street-racing world.

340
00:37:07,396 --> 00:37:08,731
If we don't make this case soon...

341
00:37:08,814 --> 00:37:11,567
the truckers will take matters
into their own hands.

342
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,736
I tell them we're close.

343
00:37:14,737 --> 00:37:16,447
Are you gonna make me a liar?

344
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,157
Look, what do we know?

345
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:20,993
We know this world
revolves around Toretto, right?

346
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,830
I'm not saying that he's the one
that's popping these trucks...

347
00:37:23,913 --> 00:37:26,833
but I can guarantee the both of you
he knows who is.

348
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:28,251
It's just a matter of
time until I win...

349
00:37:28,334 --> 00:37:33,089
You want time, buy the magazine.
We don't have time.

350
00:37:34,048 --> 00:37:36,676
Just get me something I can use.

351
00:37:38,052 --> 00:37:39,512
Is Harry cooperating?

352
00:37:39,596 --> 00:37:41,431
Like a guy that's gonna do
three to five...

353
00:37:41,514 --> 00:37:43,433
for receiving stolen property
if he doesn't.

354
00:37:43,516 --> 00:37:45,185
What kind of vibe
is he getting from Toretto?

355
00:37:45,268 --> 00:37:48,647
He's scared of him but he doesn't
think he's jacking trucks either.

356
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:51,149
- He's too controlled for that.
- Wait.

357
00:37:51,233 --> 00:37:54,236
Not that I want to contradict
Harry's fine judge of character...

358
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:58,240
but Toretto did hard time
for nearly beating a guy to death.

359
00:37:58,323 --> 00:38:01,159
He's got nitrous oxide in his blood
and a gas tank for a brain.

360
00:38:01,243 --> 00:38:03,453
Do not turn your back on him.

361
00:38:03,578 --> 00:38:06,957
Tanner, I'm gonna need another car.

362
00:38:10,335 --> 00:38:12,963
- What about parts and service?
- Hold off on it.

363
00:38:13,046 --> 00:38:15,382
Dom, I don't know what to do with it.

364
00:38:18,844 --> 00:38:23,307
All right, what the hell is this?
What do you got there?

365
00:38:24,308 --> 00:38:25,726
This is your car.

366
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:27,019
My car?

367
00:38:27,311 --> 00:38:30,314
I said a ten-second car,
not a ten-minute car.

368
00:38:30,398 --> 00:38:34,652
You could push this across
the finish line, or tow it.

369
00:38:35,569 --> 00:38:38,197
You couldn't even tow that
across the finish line.

370
00:38:39,365 --> 00:38:40,616
No faith.

371
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,785
I have faith in you,
but this isn't a junkyard.

372
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:45,538
- This is a garage.
- Pop the hood.

373
00:38:45,621 --> 00:38:48,041
- Pop the hood?
- Pop the hood.

374
00:38:49,959 --> 00:38:53,588
- 2JZ engine. No shit.
- And what did I tell you?

375
00:38:53,671 --> 00:38:56,424
- I retract my previous statement.
- You know what?

376
00:38:56,507 --> 00:39:01,179
This will decimate all after
you put about fifteen grand in it.

377
00:39:01,262 --> 00:39:05,308
Or more, if we have to
overnight parts from Japan.

378
00:39:05,392 --> 00:39:08,228
- We'll put it on my tab at Harry's.
- Yes!

379
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,649
I gotta get you racing again so
I can make some money off your ass.

380
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:15,610
There's a show down in the desert
called Race Wars.

381
00:39:15,694 --> 00:39:17,779
That's where you'll do it.

382
00:39:18,321 --> 00:39:20,407
I'll tell you what.
When you're not working at Harry's...

383
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:21,783
you're working here.

384
00:39:21,867 --> 00:39:25,954
If you can't find the right tool
in this garage, Mr. Arizona...

385
00:39:26,038 --> 00:39:28,457
you don't belong near a car.

386
00:39:32,044 --> 00:39:33,879
He owns you now.

387
00:39:58,612 --> 00:40:02,909
Tell me what you think about this.
Koni adjustables.

388
00:40:03,117 --> 00:40:05,495
Gonna save us about two pounds.

389
00:40:05,578 --> 00:40:08,998
And they're gonna give us
better traction for the hole shot.

390
00:40:09,082 --> 00:40:10,750
All right?

391
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,169
This is your basic layout of the car.

392
00:40:13,252 --> 00:40:17,674
And that's pretty much what it could
look like when it's finished.

393
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,592
Red, green.

394
00:40:19,759 --> 00:40:21,970
You should be going
to MIT or something.

395
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:23,847
Yeah, right.

396
00:40:23,972 --> 00:40:26,015
No, I got that...

397
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:27,684
What's it called?

398
00:40:27,976 --> 00:40:30,186
That attention disorder...

399
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:34,941
- ADD?
- Yes, that shit. Yeah.

400
00:40:35,108 --> 00:40:39,571
You know, I was good in algebra
and like math and shit.

401
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:42,199
Everything else I failed.

402
00:40:42,324 --> 00:40:44,242
Dropped out of school.

403
00:40:44,451 --> 00:40:51,750
I dunno. It's just something about
engines that calms me down, you know.

404
00:41:11,645 --> 00:41:14,565
- I'm outta here.
- Come on, dog.

405
00:41:14,899 --> 00:41:16,025
- Yo, Dom.
- Vince...

406
00:41:16,108 --> 00:41:17,526
get over here and give us a hand.

407
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:20,696
Looks like you got
all the help you need, brother.

408
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:37,797
- Mia! The chicken's dry.
- All right. I'm coming out already.

409
00:41:41,926 --> 00:41:44,679
Here you go.

410
00:41:46,014 --> 00:41:47,724
Hey, hold up.

411
00:41:47,932 --> 00:41:49,934
Because you're the first
out of everybody here...

412
00:41:50,018 --> 00:41:54,105
to reach in to get the chicken,
you say grace.

413
00:41:56,191 --> 00:41:57,817
Come on.

414
00:41:59,236 --> 00:42:01,071
Dear heavenly...

415
00:42:01,154 --> 00:42:02,906
Spirit.

416
00:42:03,281 --> 00:42:05,367
Spirit. Thank you.

417
00:42:05,826 --> 00:42:11,832
Thank you for providing us with
a direct port nitrous injection...

418
00:42:11,957 --> 00:42:15,836
four core intercoolers
and ball-bearing turbos...

419
00:42:15,919 --> 00:42:19,131
and titanium valve springs.

420
00:42:19,214 --> 00:42:21,383
- Thank you.
- Amen.

421
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,844
- Not bad.
- Amen.

422
00:42:23,927 --> 00:42:26,972
He was praying to the car gods, man.

423
00:42:27,973 --> 00:42:30,643
- He's not the best.
- What do you want?

424
00:42:31,143 --> 00:42:32,686
- Practice.
- Thank you, girl.

425
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:34,355
Look who it is.

426
00:42:34,438 --> 00:42:36,732
Old Coyotes 'R' Us.

427
00:42:36,816 --> 00:42:39,276
I thought you weren't hungry,
pumpkin.

428
00:42:39,527 --> 00:42:40,736
You know, I gotta eat.

429
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,363
He's always hungry.

430
00:42:42,655 --> 00:42:44,573
All right, sit down.

431
00:42:51,789 --> 00:42:53,833
How you doing, Mia?

432
00:42:57,003 --> 00:42:58,963
Here you go, pal.

433
00:43:05,762 --> 00:43:08,014
- Jesse, hand me that chicken.
- Let's eat some grub, man.

434
00:43:08,097 --> 00:43:09,557
Want some of that chicken?

435
00:43:09,682 --> 00:43:11,893
What, you rent a
movie or something?

436
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,193
Need a hand with anything else?

437
00:43:20,277 --> 00:43:23,989
No, I'm good. You can go
join the boys and watch the movie.

438
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:26,324
Never see the cook doesn't clean
where I come from.

439
00:43:26,408 --> 00:43:28,160
I'd like to go there.

440
00:43:32,998 --> 00:43:34,583
I think we should go out sometime.

441
00:43:34,666 --> 00:43:37,461
No, I don't date
my brother's friends.

442
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,379
Well, that sucks.

443
00:43:39,463 --> 00:43:41,048
I guess I'll have to
kick his ass then.

444
00:43:41,173 --> 00:43:42,925
I'd love to see that one.

445
00:43:43,008 --> 00:43:46,970
No, I'd pay to see that one,
actually.

446
00:44:00,109 --> 00:44:01,819
Wash my car when you get done.

447
00:44:01,902 --> 00:44:06,532
- What was that?
- No, Mia. I'm talking to the punk.

448
00:44:06,824 --> 00:44:08,701
Wear your favorite dress,
'cause when you're done...

449
00:44:08,784 --> 00:44:12,038
I'm putting you on the street
where you belong, cutie.

450
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:17,376
Is this thing broken?

451
00:44:17,502 --> 00:44:19,837
- What's wrong with this thing?
- V...

452
00:44:20,588 --> 00:44:24,634
V, What was that Cuban restaurant
you wanted to take me to?

453
00:44:24,717 --> 00:44:27,887
- The one with the picadillo and...
- With red candles...

454
00:44:27,971 --> 00:44:30,557
- wooden tables, yeah.
- plantain, food all over the place.

455
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,559
- What it's called?
- Cha.

456
00:44:32,642 --> 00:44:34,936
- Yeah, that's it.
- Yeah.

457
00:44:35,812 --> 00:44:37,480
Well, you can take me there.

458
00:44:37,772 --> 00:44:40,483
Friday night at 10.00.
Is that good for you?

459
00:44:41,109 --> 00:44:43,695
- Yeah, it's perfect.
- Good.

460
00:44:49,659 --> 00:44:51,036
There's no popcorn.

461
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,039
Make your own god damn popcorn!

462
00:45:07,469 --> 00:45:10,389
All right. Now that's valet parking.

463
00:45:14,268 --> 00:45:16,353
- Harry. What's up, dog?
- Nice to see you.

464
00:45:16,437 --> 00:45:18,063
Excellent, brother. Come on in, man.

465
00:45:18,147 --> 00:45:21,901
- Check it. It's yours.
- Damn. What do we got here?

466
00:45:22,693 --> 00:45:24,737
- Hired some new help?
- Don't even think about it.

467
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:27,573
- What's up?
- What's up, Brian? How you feeling?

468
00:45:27,657 --> 00:45:29,951
Pretty good. So what's up?
What do you need?

469
00:45:30,034 --> 00:45:32,453
What's up, man?
I need you to hook me up.

470
00:45:32,537 --> 00:45:34,956
Three of everything. I made a list.

471
00:45:35,873 --> 00:45:37,917
Why don't you look that over?

472
00:45:38,126 --> 00:45:39,460
When do you need this stuff by?

473
00:45:39,544 --> 00:45:41,629
Tomorrow, today, now.

474
00:45:41,754 --> 00:45:43,923
- Right.
- White boys work fast, don't they?

475
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:46,342
[Spanish]

476
00:45:47,302 --> 00:45:48,928
That's right.

477
00:45:51,472 --> 00:45:53,224
You said you need three
of all this stuff?

478
00:45:53,308 --> 00:45:55,477
Yeah, three of everything.

479
00:45:55,727 --> 00:45:58,772
What do you think about that?
Check this out.

480
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,487
He moans like a cop.

481
00:48:17,371 --> 00:48:18,956
Brian, this is one of those times...

482
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,043
you need to be very clear
about what you say.

483
00:48:22,335 --> 00:48:24,128
Nod if you understand me.

484
00:48:24,378 --> 00:48:25,963
Nod!

485
00:48:27,548 --> 00:48:29,050
Sit up.

486
00:48:35,223 --> 00:48:37,851
Tell me what the hell
you're doing down here.

487
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,979
Shit. What I'm doing?

488
00:48:43,148 --> 00:48:44,858
Dom.

489
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:49,070
I owe you a ten-second car.

490
00:48:50,447 --> 00:48:55,285
And what this is about,
this is about Race Wars.

491
00:48:57,245 --> 00:49:01,583
I just went in there,
and Hector is gonna be running...

492
00:49:01,667 --> 00:49:04,169
three Honda Civics
with Spoon engines.

493
00:49:04,252 --> 00:49:07,089
And on top of that,
he just came into Harry's...

494
00:49:07,214 --> 00:49:12,678
and he ordered three T66 turbos,
with NOS...

495
00:49:13,095 --> 00:49:15,639
and a MoTeC system exhaust.

496
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,603
So, what are you saying?

497
00:49:21,604 --> 00:49:24,356
You're gonna go around and
check everybody's shit out...

498
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,734
one garage after another?

499
00:49:29,028 --> 00:49:30,446
Yeah.

500
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:35,534
Because, Dom, you know...

501
00:49:35,993 --> 00:49:38,079
I can't lose again.

502
00:49:39,163 --> 00:49:40,998
He's a cop.

503
00:49:42,917 --> 00:49:44,585
He's a cop!

504
00:49:47,422 --> 00:49:49,048
You a cop?

505
00:49:55,179 --> 00:49:57,348
Let's go for a little ride.

506
00:50:00,059 --> 00:50:01,728
Walk!

507
00:50:21,081 --> 00:50:23,000
Okay. You stand watch.

508
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,949
Yo, Dominic.

509
00:50:56,701 --> 00:50:58,536
There's no engines.

510
00:50:59,662 --> 00:51:02,456
What are they planning on
racing with, hopes and dreams?

511
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:04,959
I don't know,
but I know they're sneaky as shit...

512
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:07,587
and they've got enough money
to buy anything.

513
00:51:13,051 --> 00:51:14,510
What, Jess?

514
00:51:22,352 --> 00:51:24,729
Dom, we got a wolf pack.

515
00:51:24,813 --> 00:51:28,608
<i>It's Johnny Tran,
and he's coming your way really fast.</i>

516
00:51:28,692 --> 00:51:31,945
All right, we got company. Spilner.

517
00:51:57,387 --> 00:51:59,973
Come on. Move!

518
00:52:00,057 --> 00:52:02,351
Let me ask you a question, Ted.

519
00:52:03,602 --> 00:52:06,146
Do you see anything wrong here?

520
00:52:06,397 --> 00:52:08,065
No.

521
00:52:10,776 --> 00:52:13,112
- We got no engines, do we?
- No.

522
00:52:13,195 --> 00:52:14,530
- Do we?
- No.

523
00:52:14,613 --> 00:52:16,449
- Do we?
- No.

524
00:52:17,533 --> 00:52:20,161
A couple of Nissan SR20 motors
will pull a premium...

525
00:52:20,244 --> 00:52:23,497
- one week before Race Wars?
- Yeah, probably.

526
00:52:23,623 --> 00:52:27,460
You're a smart fence, Ted.
Maybe too smart.

527
00:52:28,252 --> 00:52:30,588
What are you feeling, Lance?

528
00:52:31,672 --> 00:52:33,466
Forty-weight?

529
00:52:33,758 --> 00:52:35,551
Fifty-weight?

530
00:52:35,635 --> 00:52:38,680
A forty-weight sounds nice.

531
00:52:53,445 --> 00:52:54,988
Where are they, Ted?

532
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:57,032
- Where are they?
- Enough!

533
00:52:57,115 --> 00:53:00,035
- Where are they?
- They're in a warehouse.

534
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,662
They're in a warehouse, man!

535
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:19,596
Ted.

536
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,682
Kiss my shoes?

537
00:53:33,611 --> 00:53:35,821
Let's go get our engines.

538
00:53:36,572 --> 00:53:39,283
My superiors are flying in from D.C.
day after tomorrow.

539
00:53:39,367 --> 00:53:40,701
I want something to show.

540
00:53:40,826 --> 00:53:43,371
Now we've got a fence
with a lube hose in his mouth...

541
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:44,580
automatic weapons...

542
00:53:44,664 --> 00:53:47,208
a jacket full of priors on every
one of these Asian punks...

543
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:50,586
a garage full of DVD players
and generally psychotic behavior.

544
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:52,922
Tell me why we shouldn't move on
Johnny Tran right now...

545
00:53:53,005 --> 00:53:54,215
and see where we are
when the dust settles.

546
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:55,842
Because all we have is behavior.

547
00:53:55,925 --> 00:53:59,137
Let me get hard evidence,
because what we have now is just...

548
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,139
What we have is probable cause.

549
00:54:01,222 --> 00:54:05,101
Truckers arming themselves for some
good old-fashioned vigilante mayhem.

550
00:54:05,185 --> 00:54:07,020
Tell us about Hector, Brian.

551
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:09,439
Latinos with spear guns.
Give me a break.

552
00:54:09,522 --> 00:54:13,276
Hector's still working on the engines
but the tires don't match.

553
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,778
Will somebody just
give me a cigarette?

554
00:54:14,861 --> 00:54:17,072
- Get him a cigarette.
- Don't give him a cigarette.

555
00:54:17,364 --> 00:54:18,782
- I thought you quit.
- Yeah, I did quit.

556
00:54:18,865 --> 00:54:19,950
Just give me a cigarette.

557
00:54:20,033 --> 00:54:22,118
- Get him a cigarette.
- No!

558
00:54:24,162 --> 00:54:25,831
Tell me about Toretto.

559
00:54:25,997 --> 00:54:28,750
I told you,
I think he's too controlled for this.

560
00:54:28,875 --> 00:54:30,877
On what? Going suicidal
on semi-trucks?

561
00:54:30,961 --> 00:54:33,755
No way. Maybe his buddy Vince.
But he's too stupid to pull it off.

562
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,717
I think the kid sister
is blurring your vision.

563
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,343
- What did you say?
- I don't blame you.

564
00:54:38,427 --> 00:54:41,430
I'd get off on
her surveillance photos, too, buddy.

565
00:54:43,974 --> 00:54:45,642
Knock it off!

566
00:54:46,435 --> 00:54:48,854
What? Are you going
native on me, Brian?

567
00:54:53,567 --> 00:54:55,903
Have you read Toretto's file lately?

568
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:58,489
- Yeah. I memorized that file.
- Read it again.

569
00:54:58,572 --> 00:55:00,991
No, better still,
take a look at these.

570
00:55:02,827 --> 00:55:06,163
Remember I told you about the guy
he nearly beat to death?

571
00:55:06,497 --> 00:55:10,167
Toretto did this with
a three-quarter-inch torque wrench.

572
00:55:10,293 --> 00:55:12,920
He's a model of self-control.

573
00:55:15,131 --> 00:55:17,383
I need a few more days.

574
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:21,971
I need a few more days.

575
00:55:23,765 --> 00:55:26,684
Got a TR7 here,
with a ball-bearing upgrade.

576
00:55:26,768 --> 00:55:30,814
What it's going to do is,
it's going to spool up really quick.

577
00:55:30,897 --> 00:55:32,774
I got this set up for
twenty-four psi.

578
00:55:32,857 --> 00:55:34,359
Got it.

579
00:55:36,736 --> 00:55:39,364
You got big plans tonight?

580
00:55:40,865 --> 00:55:42,951
Yeah. We're going out to dinner.

581
00:55:44,619 --> 00:55:47,164
You break her heart,
I'll break your neck.

582
00:55:47,664 --> 00:55:49,458
That's not gonna happen.

583
00:55:54,379 --> 00:55:56,548
I want to show you something.

584
00:56:06,266 --> 00:56:07,810
Wow!

585
00:56:10,521 --> 00:56:12,523
Me and my dad built her.

586
00:56:13,023 --> 00:56:16,318
Nine hundred horses
of Detroit muscle.

587
00:56:16,777 --> 00:56:18,571
It's a beast.

588
00:56:18,654 --> 00:56:20,281
You know what she ran in Palmdale?

589
00:56:20,364 --> 00:56:21,532
No. What did she run?

590
00:56:21,615 --> 00:56:23,659
Nine seconds flat.

591
00:56:24,577 --> 00:56:27,121
- God.
- My dad was driving.

592
00:56:27,204 --> 00:56:31,834
So much torque, the chassis
twisted coming off the line.

593
00:56:32,543 --> 00:56:34,837
Barely kept her on the track.

594
00:56:35,213 --> 00:56:36,839
So, what's your best time?

595
00:56:36,923 --> 00:56:38,216
I've never driven her.

596
00:56:38,299 --> 00:56:39,801
Why not?

597
00:56:42,095 --> 00:56:44,514
It scares the shit out of me.

598
00:56:46,516 --> 00:56:48,351
That's my dad.

599
00:56:49,394 --> 00:56:52,230
He was coming up
in the pro stock-car circuit.

600
00:56:52,313 --> 00:56:54,357
Last race of the season.

601
00:56:55,066 --> 00:57:00,071
A guy named Kenny Linder came up
from inside, in the final turn.

602
00:57:00,155 --> 00:57:04,451
He clipped his bumper
and put him into the wall at 120.

603
00:57:06,912 --> 00:57:10,165
I watched my dad burn to death.

604
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:14,586
I remembered hearing him scream.

605
00:57:17,255 --> 00:57:19,258
But the people that were there
said that...

606
00:57:19,341 --> 00:57:22,386
he had died before the tanks blew.

607
00:57:27,933 --> 00:57:30,769
They said it was me
who was screaming.

608
00:57:33,897 --> 00:57:37,276
I saw Linder about a week later.

609
00:57:37,568 --> 00:57:39,945
I had a wrench...

610
00:57:40,571 --> 00:57:43,324
and I hit him and
I didn't intend to keep hitting him.

611
00:57:43,407 --> 00:57:46,744
But by the time I was done,
I couldn't lift my arm.

612
00:57:51,499 --> 00:57:54,835
He's a janitor at a high school.

613
00:57:55,044 --> 00:57:57,964
He has to take the bus
to work every day.

614
00:57:58,714 --> 00:58:02,301
And they banned me
from the tracks for life.

615
00:58:07,098 --> 00:58:10,393
I live my life
a quarter-mile at a time.

616
00:58:11,394 --> 00:58:14,314
Nothing else matters.
Not the mortgage, not the store...

617
00:58:14,397 --> 00:58:17,859
not my team and all their bullshit.

618
00:58:18,485 --> 00:58:21,738
For those ten seconds or less...

619
00:58:22,447 --> 00:58:24,199
I'm free.

620
00:58:44,595 --> 00:58:47,973
So, how is it, anyways,
that the gang came to be?

621
00:58:48,056 --> 00:58:49,141
- What?
- The gang.

622
00:58:49,224 --> 00:58:51,727
The gang? No, they don't call
themselves a gang.

623
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:54,104
- What do they call themselves?
- They're a team.

624
00:58:54,188 --> 00:58:55,522
They call themselves a team.

625
00:58:55,606 --> 00:58:58,609
All right. So how is it
the team come to be?

626
00:58:58,692 --> 00:59:01,445
Well, that's a whole lot of history.

627
00:59:02,321 --> 00:59:03,572
I've got time.

628
00:59:03,697 --> 00:59:06,951
Okay. Vince grew up with my brother.

629
00:59:07,201 --> 00:59:10,538
Actually, he didn't ever
actually grow up, as you can tell.

630
00:59:10,621 --> 00:59:12,373
But they were friends as kids.

631
00:59:12,456 --> 00:59:15,126
And Letty,
she just lived down the street.

632
00:59:15,209 --> 00:59:18,379
Always into cars, though. Ever since
she was, like, ten years old.

633
00:59:18,462 --> 00:59:22,759
So, naturally, you know,
my brother always had her attention.

634
00:59:22,842 --> 00:59:24,469
And then she turned sixteen...

635
00:59:24,552 --> 00:59:26,637
And then she had Dom's attention.

636
00:59:26,721 --> 00:59:30,350
Yeah. It's funny
how that works, isn't it?

637
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:31,976
Yeah.

638
00:59:35,104 --> 00:59:37,565
How does Jesse
fit into the whole thing?

639
00:59:37,649 --> 00:59:40,318
Jesse? Well, Jesse and Leon
just sort of...

640
00:59:40,402 --> 00:59:43,279
showed up one night
and never, ever left.

641
00:59:43,405 --> 00:59:47,117
It's just the way my brother is,
you know. Dom's like...

642
00:59:48,201 --> 00:59:51,037
He's like gravity.

643
00:59:51,288 --> 00:59:54,124
Everything just gets pulled to him.

644
00:59:55,167 --> 00:59:56,918
Even you.

645
00:59:58,837 --> 01:00:00,088
No.

646
01:00:00,213 --> 01:00:01,923
No.

647
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:04,635
The only thing
that pulled me in was you.

648
01:00:04,885 --> 01:00:07,554
Being friends with your brother
is just a bonus.

649
01:00:10,557 --> 01:00:12,726
That's good.

650
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:18,023
That's good. It's nice to come first
every once in a while.

651
01:00:21,277 --> 01:00:23,153
Want to go for a drive?

652
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:03,153
- Yeah?
<i>- The hijackers have hit again.</i>

653
01:01:03,236 --> 01:01:04,529
<i>Bilkins' made his decision.</i>

654
01:01:04,612 --> 01:01:08,325
<i>We're gonna move on Johnny Tran
and his guys at 1700 hour.</i>

655
01:01:08,408 --> 01:01:10,201
<i>Unless you say otherwise.</i>

656
01:01:10,327 --> 01:01:12,537
<i>If you agree, just say yes.</i>

657
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:15,248
- Yeah.
- Who is that?

658
01:01:16,875 --> 01:01:19,044
It's just a wrong number.

659
01:04:11,053 --> 01:04:13,305
Yes, sir. Yeah, I know, but...

660
01:04:13,472 --> 01:04:16,183
Yeah. Yes, sir.

661
01:04:16,266 --> 01:04:18,352
Yeah. I got it.

662
01:04:22,272 --> 01:04:24,191
The DVD players
were purchased legally.

663
01:04:24,274 --> 01:04:25,651
All we've got on Tran and company...

664
01:04:25,734 --> 01:04:27,444
are a couple of low-rent
weapons charges...

665
01:04:27,528 --> 01:04:29,822
and some outstanding
speeding tickets.

666
01:04:29,947 --> 01:04:31,740
- So, they're out.
- Yeah.

667
01:04:31,824 --> 01:04:33,826
Father bailed them out.

668
01:04:34,535 --> 01:04:38,289
Is this the kind of intelligence
I can expect from you, O'Conner?

669
01:04:43,127 --> 01:04:44,378
You're gonna put this on me?

670
01:04:44,462 --> 01:04:46,297
I can put it on
whoever I want to, kid.

671
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:49,258
- Perks of the job.
- No, you can't put this on me...

672
01:04:49,342 --> 01:04:51,093
No, wait a minute. Let me tell you.

673
01:04:51,177 --> 01:04:53,221
I don't care if you have to
put a gun at someone's head...

674
01:04:53,304 --> 01:04:55,348
and blow your cover to smithereens.

675
01:04:55,431 --> 01:04:57,975
You've got thirty-six hours
to crack this bastard...

676
01:04:58,059 --> 01:05:01,145
or you might want to be
thinking about another career.

677
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:16,036
It's Toretto, Brian.
It always has been Toretto.

678
01:05:16,995 --> 01:05:18,997
Tran and Hector are...

679
01:05:19,289 --> 01:05:21,416
They're just fumes.

680
01:05:24,336 --> 01:05:27,130
I know you've been lying to me.
My question is this...

681
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:31,301
have you been lying to yourself
because you can't see past Mia?

682
01:05:33,428 --> 01:05:35,764
He won't go back to prison.

683
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:39,643
Well, that's a choice
he's going to have to make.

684
01:05:43,355 --> 01:05:46,316
There's all kinds of family, Brian.

685
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:50,237
And that's a choice
you're gonna have to make.

686
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,550
You ready for this jumpy?

687
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:39,704
Nice car.
What's the retail on one of those?

688
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:43,208
More than you can afford,
pal. Ferrari.

689
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,549
Smoke him.

690
01:07:45,063 --> 01:07:47,190
So, what's wrong, Brian?

691
01:07:47,857 --> 01:07:49,901
Nothing, man, I'm fine.

692
01:07:50,026 --> 01:07:53,655
Come on. Obviously something's off.

693
01:07:53,863 --> 01:07:57,992
Look, I have my good days and I have
my bad days just like anybody else.

694
01:07:58,243 --> 01:08:01,955
Brian, don't lose that cool of yours.
That's your meal ticket.

695
01:08:03,665 --> 01:08:06,585
My meal ticket?
I can't pay for my own shrimp?

696
01:08:06,668 --> 01:08:08,253
I got the shrimp.

697
01:08:08,628 --> 01:08:11,256
No, that's one thing about me
you don't understand.

698
01:08:11,339 --> 01:08:15,385
I don't take handouts. I don't take
handouts. I earn my way, every step.

699
01:08:15,927 --> 01:08:18,221
I just gonna make little something
extra on the side, like you.

700
01:08:18,305 --> 01:08:20,098
What do you mean, like me?

701
01:08:20,557 --> 01:08:23,393
- What's that supposed to mean?
- That's what I mean.

702
01:08:23,602 --> 01:08:26,313
- What does that mean, like me?
- Don't try...

703
01:08:26,563 --> 01:08:28,649
I'm not stupid, all right?

704
01:08:28,816 --> 01:08:31,151
I know that there's no way in hell
you paid for all that shit...

705
01:08:31,235 --> 01:08:32,861
you got under the hood...

706
01:08:32,945 --> 01:08:36,365
There's no way you paid for what's
under the hood of those cars...

707
01:08:36,448 --> 01:08:39,702
by doing tune-ups and
selling groceries.

708
01:08:40,077 --> 01:08:43,414
Now, whatever it is you're in on,
I want in on it, too.

709
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:08,564
- Well, what is this?
- Read it.

710
01:09:08,773 --> 01:09:11,401
- What is this for?
- It's directions.

711
01:09:13,278 --> 01:09:15,113
To Race Wars.

712
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:17,365
We'll see how you go.

713
01:09:18,366 --> 01:09:20,118
Then we'll talk.

714
01:10:06,165 --> 01:10:07,708
- How's it going, bro?
- What's up, man?

715
01:10:07,792 --> 01:10:11,087
- Welcome to Race Wars.
- Great. Thanks a lot.

716
01:10:33,735 --> 01:10:35,904
Baby. Hey, baby.

717
01:10:36,988 --> 01:10:38,698
You should be watching from the side.

718
01:10:38,782 --> 01:10:40,784
I wouldn't want to get exhaust
on that pretty face.

719
01:10:40,867 --> 01:10:42,786
How about you put your money
where your mouth is.

720
01:10:42,869 --> 01:10:45,163
How about I'll race you
for that sweet little ass.

721
01:10:45,246 --> 01:10:47,791
You want ass, why don't you
hit Hollywood Boulevard?

722
01:10:47,874 --> 01:10:51,086
You want an adrenaline rush,
it'll be two large.

723
01:10:51,169 --> 01:10:54,464
Right here. Right now.
What's it gonna be?

724
01:10:56,591 --> 01:10:58,176
You got it.

725
01:11:18,072 --> 01:11:20,449
Another one bites the dust.

726
01:11:23,369 --> 01:11:26,038
Come on. What you got?

727
01:11:26,247 --> 01:11:28,040
See ya.

728
01:12:03,993 --> 01:12:06,788
- Brian, what's up?
- Hey, what's up, Jesse?

729
01:12:07,038 --> 01:12:08,290
What's in your hand?

730
01:12:08,373 --> 01:12:11,001
Throwing down the pink slip,
just like you.

731
01:12:11,209 --> 01:12:13,587
- The pink slip to what? The Jetta?
- Yeah.

732
01:12:13,837 --> 01:12:15,422
You can't bet your dad's car.

733
01:12:15,505 --> 01:12:17,841
It's all right. I ain't losing.

734
01:12:17,924 --> 01:12:21,511
This fool is running a Honda 2000.
I'll win.

735
01:12:21,595 --> 01:12:25,849
That way, me and my dad can roll when
he gets out of prison. It's all good.

736
01:12:25,933 --> 01:12:28,143
They're gonna throw him right back
in prison after he kills you.

737
01:12:28,227 --> 01:12:29,811
Shit. I'm up.

738
01:12:37,611 --> 01:12:39,113
You visualize the win.

739
01:12:39,196 --> 01:12:41,198
All right, visualize the win, Jesse.

740
01:12:41,281 --> 01:12:43,117
I'm serious.
You got to listen to me, man.

741
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,077
Who are you racing?

742
01:12:49,248 --> 01:12:51,417
Jesse, don't do it.

743
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,879
I bet he's got more than a hundred
grand under the hood of that car.

744
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:20,280
Too soon, junior.

745
01:13:23,283 --> 01:13:24,617
No!

746
01:13:27,287 --> 01:13:29,039
Shit!

747
01:13:29,205 --> 01:13:30,874
Oh, God!

748
01:13:40,967 --> 01:13:43,637
Yo! Heads up, bro.
We got problems.

749
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,806
- What?
- Jesse.

750
01:13:47,182 --> 01:13:48,976
Where's Jesse going?

751
01:13:49,101 --> 01:13:53,063
- He just raced Tran for slips.
- Oh, shit.

752
01:14:04,366 --> 01:14:05,868
Where's he going?

753
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:07,620
He went to the car wash.

754
01:14:07,703 --> 01:14:09,955
Whatever. Go fetch my car.

755
01:14:10,247 --> 01:14:12,374
Go fetch your car?

756
01:14:13,083 --> 01:14:14,460
We're not on your block anymore.

757
01:14:14,543 --> 01:14:17,129
You better watch
who you talk to like that.

758
01:14:17,713 --> 01:14:19,090
Toretto!

759
01:14:19,173 --> 01:14:20,800
Toretto!

760
01:14:22,134 --> 01:14:24,804
SWAT came into my house...

761
01:14:24,971 --> 01:14:29,642
disrespected my whole family,
because somebody narc'd me out.

762
01:14:29,934 --> 01:14:32,812
And you know what? It was you!

763
01:14:56,753 --> 01:14:59,798
Get off of him, man. Get off of him!

764
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:09,349
Come on! Chill out, man!

765
01:15:09,433 --> 01:15:11,935
- Come on, chill out, man.!
- I never narc'd on nobody!

766
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:14,897
I never narc'd on nobody!

767
01:15:49,348 --> 01:15:50,933
Mia.

768
01:15:53,478 --> 01:15:54,896
Mia.

769
01:15:56,981 --> 01:15:58,900
Each time, I've not
said a word, have I?

770
01:15:58,983 --> 01:16:01,778
I've respected you
and I haven't said shit.

771
01:16:01,861 --> 01:16:04,155
Now I am asking you not to go.

772
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:06,574
- I'm doing this for both of us.
- Don't give me that crap.

773
01:16:06,658 --> 01:16:07,992
You're doing this for you.

774
01:16:08,076 --> 01:16:12,664
Why are you insisting on doing this?
Dom, please, just don't.

775
01:16:24,342 --> 01:16:26,928
- Mia, what's going on?
- What?

776
01:16:27,012 --> 01:16:29,514
- You know what I'm talking about.
- No, I don't, Brian.

777
01:16:29,598 --> 01:16:32,726
I assume you always have tears in
your eyes when Dom drives away?

778
01:16:32,809 --> 01:16:34,353
What's the matter with you?

779
01:16:34,436 --> 01:16:36,813
Come on! What's your brother racing
off in the middle of the night for?

780
01:16:36,897 --> 01:16:38,023
I'm talking about the trucks.

781
01:16:38,106 --> 01:16:40,234
- You know about the trucks?
- No, Brian! What trucks?

782
01:16:40,317 --> 01:16:42,319
Jesus Christ. What?

783
01:16:42,569 --> 01:16:44,738
- What?
- Listen to me.

784
01:16:45,656 --> 01:16:47,408
Mia, I'm a cop.

785
01:16:47,992 --> 01:16:51,120
What are you talking about, Brian?
What is this?

786
01:16:51,203 --> 01:16:54,540
Ever since the first time I met you,
I've been undercover.

787
01:16:55,958 --> 01:16:57,668
I'm a cop.

788
01:17:01,922 --> 01:17:04,050
Oh, you bastard.

789
01:17:06,761 --> 01:17:08,721
You bastard.

790
01:17:10,348 --> 01:17:12,183
- Mia.
- Get off of me, Brian!

791
01:17:12,266 --> 01:17:14,519
Mia! Listen to me!

792
01:17:15,228 --> 01:17:17,814
Everything I ever said
I felt about you was real.

793
01:17:17,897 --> 01:17:20,316
I swear to God.
You have to believe me, Mia.

794
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,527
But right now,
this isn't about you and me.

795
01:17:22,610 --> 01:17:24,404
Your brother's out there,
he's about to pull a job.

796
01:17:24,487 --> 01:17:25,822
We're running out of time.

797
01:17:25,905 --> 01:17:28,116
Those truckers, they are not
laying down anymore, you know?

798
01:17:28,199 --> 01:17:29,409
Maybe they'll make it
through tonight...

799
01:17:29,492 --> 01:17:31,161
but every single
law enforcement agency...

800
01:17:31,244 --> 01:17:33,288
in California is coming down on them.

801
01:17:33,455 --> 01:17:34,998
If you don't want anything
to happen to your brother...

802
01:17:35,081 --> 01:17:36,666
to Letty, to Leon, to Vince...

803
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:40,086
you have to get in that car with me
right now, you have to help me.

804
01:17:41,129 --> 01:17:45,008
Mia, you are the only person
that can help me right now.

805
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:47,010
Please, Mia.

806
01:17:47,302 --> 01:17:49,137
Please help me.

807
01:18:00,357 --> 01:18:03,235
Civics are stashed somewhere
outside of Thermal.

808
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:06,780
And they wouldn't double back and
Highway 10 is way too well patrolled.

809
01:18:06,864 --> 01:18:09,992
- So, what does that leave us with?
- Leave us to all this.

810
01:18:18,709 --> 01:18:21,587
<i>- Nextel.</i>
- This is Officer Brian O'Conner.

811
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:26,217
Serial number 34762.
I need a cell phone trace.

812
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:29,720
<i>- Okay. What's the cell number?</i>
- Mia, what is the cell phone number?

813
01:18:31,556 --> 01:18:34,851
Come on, Mia. She needs
Dom's cell phone number now.

814
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:43,151
323-555-6439.

815
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:47,030
Thank you. Yeah, you get that?

816
01:19:12,556 --> 01:19:16,810
All right, we're one man short.
Letty, I need you on the left side.

817
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:20,731
Your sister's right about this one.

818
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:22,149
This don't feel good.

819
01:19:22,232 --> 01:19:23,901
Don't do that.

820
01:19:25,068 --> 01:19:26,987
- Something's wrong.
- Stop.

821
01:19:27,070 --> 01:19:29,531
We shouldn't be doing this
without Jesse.

822
01:19:30,491 --> 01:19:33,327
Look, this is the mother lode.
We've been on this for three months.

823
01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:35,955
After this, it's a long vacation
for everyone.

824
01:19:36,038 --> 01:19:38,624
- Let's go.
- I hope so.

825
01:19:41,502 --> 01:19:44,964
Listen, the other night
I had a dream...

826
01:19:45,047 --> 01:19:48,050
that you and I were
on the beach in Mexico.

827
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:50,594
- Really?
- Really.

828
01:19:53,431 --> 01:19:55,766
Come on. Let's make this happen.

829
01:19:58,811 --> 01:20:01,481
Leon, keep on those scanners.

830
01:20:01,564 --> 01:20:03,107
Copy that.

831
01:20:06,486 --> 01:20:09,030
All right, let's go.

832
01:20:19,374 --> 01:20:22,335
<i>Okay, we traced the number
to the northbound 86.</i>

833
01:20:22,419 --> 01:20:27,173
<i>Mile 114, outside Coachella.
We'll keep the trace open, Officer.</i>

834
01:20:27,257 --> 01:20:29,009
Let me see this.

835
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:36,016
All right, I think we're about
forty miles away.

836
01:20:36,266 --> 01:20:38,018
What are you gonna do?

837
01:20:39,061 --> 01:20:40,896
What are you gonna do?

838
01:21:13,471 --> 01:21:15,890
Okay! Go time!

839
01:21:30,947 --> 01:21:33,491
We're all good, man.
I got nothing on the scanners.

840
01:21:33,575 --> 01:21:35,159
Keep going.

841
01:21:49,382 --> 01:21:50,842
Vince!

842
01:21:51,301 --> 01:21:53,512
Vince, don't! Get back in!

843
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:56,598
Vince!

844
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:03,605
He's got a damn shotgun! Leon!

845
01:22:03,689 --> 01:22:06,316
Back off! Get him off of there!

846
01:22:08,443 --> 01:22:10,112
Oh, shit!

847
01:22:20,873 --> 01:22:24,710
Get off me this thing! Pull up!

848
01:22:24,793 --> 01:22:28,422
Unhook yourself. Do it!

849
01:22:28,506 --> 01:22:30,383
- Do it!
- I can't get...

850
01:22:30,466 --> 01:22:32,176
You can do it!

851
01:22:33,052 --> 01:22:34,804
Come on, Vince!

852
01:22:41,853 --> 01:22:44,897
Dom! I'm pulling up to distract him!

853
01:22:52,113 --> 01:22:53,865
Come on, boy!

854
01:22:54,574 --> 01:22:57,035
Shot doesn't get better than this.

855
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:03,374
Son of a bitch!

856
01:23:07,712 --> 01:23:10,173
Take me off here,
or I'll have to unhook the wire!

857
01:23:10,257 --> 01:23:14,928
Try it again. One, two, three!

858
01:23:26,690 --> 01:23:28,609
Unhook yourself!

859
01:23:29,818 --> 01:23:31,987
I can't get my arm free!

860
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:34,156
- Vince, grab my hand!
- My arm!

861
01:23:34,239 --> 01:23:36,366
Listen, give me your hand.

862
01:23:36,742 --> 01:23:39,244
I'm gonna pull you off the rig!

863
01:23:41,789 --> 01:23:43,499
Vince!

864
01:23:49,255 --> 01:23:50,923
Dominic!

865
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:57,013
- Dominic!
- Shit!

866
01:24:00,433 --> 01:24:02,894
- Dominic!
- Hang on!

867
01:24:03,102 --> 01:24:06,397
Dom! Move out of the way.
I'm coming to get him.

868
01:24:31,214 --> 01:24:32,841
Letty!

869
01:24:33,425 --> 01:24:34,551
- Leon!
- Yo!

870
01:24:34,634 --> 01:24:35,760
Pull back for Letty.

871
01:24:35,844 --> 01:24:38,597
<i>- Get her out of there!</i>
- I'm on it! Go!

872
01:24:47,522 --> 01:24:50,234
I've got her!
You get Vince off that truck.

873
01:24:55,572 --> 01:24:57,908
Letty! Come on, baby.

874
01:24:58,117 --> 01:24:59,993
Letty! You okay?

875
01:25:00,077 --> 01:25:02,579
Oh, shit. Come on, girl, you all right?

876
01:25:02,663 --> 01:25:06,458
Come on, let me look at you.
Come on. We got to go. Let's go.

877
01:25:20,097 --> 01:25:21,599
Vince!

878
01:25:26,062 --> 01:25:27,438
Dominic!

879
01:25:49,878 --> 01:25:51,004
Take the wheel.

880
01:25:51,087 --> 01:25:52,422
- What do you mean take the wheel?
- Take the wheel.

881
01:25:52,505 --> 01:25:54,132
Put your foot on the gas!

882
01:25:54,633 --> 01:25:56,509
I'm gonna get him.
Put your foot on the gas!

883
01:25:56,593 --> 01:25:58,345
Okay!

884
01:26:01,181 --> 01:26:03,183
Come on. Keep it steady.

885
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,102
I got it!

886
01:26:06,186 --> 01:26:08,105
All right, hold on, Vince.

887
01:26:09,231 --> 01:26:11,817
He's having a hard time holding on.
Get me a little closer.

888
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:13,485
All right.

889
01:26:13,902 --> 01:26:16,405
- Closer.
- I'm moving in.

890
01:26:16,488 --> 01:26:18,365
Hold it right there!

891
01:26:19,324 --> 01:26:21,034
Go!

892
01:26:22,494 --> 01:26:24,788
Vince! You got to
hang in here with me right now!

893
01:26:24,872 --> 01:26:26,707
We'll get you off. Give me your arm!

894
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:29,627
Vince, look at me! Don't let go!

895
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:36,050
Come on, Vince!
Throw this arm around me!

896
01:26:36,967 --> 01:26:38,928
Vince, don't let go!

897
01:26:43,015 --> 01:26:45,226
Come on, Mia. Get closer!

898
01:26:50,481 --> 01:26:52,275
Mia, get closer! Come on.

899
01:26:52,358 --> 01:26:54,235
Come on, Vince. Here we go!

900
01:27:21,012 --> 01:27:22,430
V!

901
01:27:22,514 --> 01:27:24,099
Shit.

902
01:27:27,853 --> 01:27:31,565
It's gonna be okay, Letty.
I love you.

903
01:27:34,359 --> 01:27:35,861
- Watch her.
- I got her.

904
01:27:36,904 --> 01:27:39,490
Come on, Vince!
Hang in there! Come on!

905
01:27:43,744 --> 01:27:46,664
If we don't get him to an ambulance
in ten minutes, he's dead.

906
01:27:46,747 --> 01:27:48,082
- Hold the pressure. Just like that.
- I got it.

907
01:27:48,165 --> 01:27:50,793
- Don't let go. Hold his arm up.
- Vince!

908
01:27:55,506 --> 01:27:59,051
Yeah. This is Officer Brian O'Conner.

909
01:27:59,301 --> 01:28:01,178
I'm off-duty MAPD.

910
01:28:01,429 --> 01:28:03,973
I need a life flight
roll out right away.

911
01:28:04,932 --> 01:28:09,520
My twenty is Highway 86,
mile marker 147.

912
01:28:09,687 --> 01:28:13,065
I got one trauma victim,
about twenty-four years of age.

913
01:28:13,149 --> 01:28:15,485
Six-foot, maybe two hundred pounds.

914
01:28:15,568 --> 01:28:19,364
He's got a deep laceration to
his right arm with arterial bleeding.

915
01:28:19,447 --> 01:28:24,160
And he's got a shotgun wound
close range to his left flank.

916
01:28:24,285 --> 01:28:27,914
Yeah, he's going into shock!

917
01:30:07,724 --> 01:30:10,227
Dom, put the gun down now!

918
01:30:12,229 --> 01:30:14,064
- Move your car.
- No bullshit!

919
01:30:14,147 --> 01:30:16,608
Put it down now! No more running!

920
01:30:16,733 --> 01:30:18,568
I'm not running!

921
01:30:21,363 --> 01:30:23,824
- Where's Leon and Letty?
- They're long gone!

922
01:30:23,907 --> 01:30:26,910
Then it's over. I didn't call
the police, but don't push me!

923
01:30:26,994 --> 01:30:29,955
- Put the gun down. I swear to God!
- You are the cop!

924
01:30:30,039 --> 01:30:32,041
You're a cop!

925
01:30:33,042 --> 01:30:36,420
Brian, I got to find Jesse
before they do.

926
01:30:36,503 --> 01:30:39,340
- I'm all the kid's got.
- I'll call in the plates.

927
01:30:39,423 --> 01:30:42,676
PD will pick him up way before
Johnny even gets near him.

928
01:30:43,302 --> 01:30:46,889
- Move your car.
- Dom, stop it! It's over. Please.

929
01:30:46,972 --> 01:30:48,849
Mia, stay out of it!

930
01:30:49,141 --> 01:30:50,559
Move the...

931
01:30:54,146 --> 01:30:57,525
Dominic, I am so sorry.

932
01:30:57,733 --> 01:31:00,027
I don't know what I'm doing, Dom.

933
01:31:00,111 --> 01:31:04,282
I'm so scared right now.
I don't know what's going on.

934
01:31:04,407 --> 01:31:07,160
Jess! What were you thinking, man?

935
01:31:07,243 --> 01:31:09,829
I don't know! I panicked! I'm sorry.

936
01:31:10,121 --> 01:31:11,331
I'm scared!

937
01:31:11,414 --> 01:31:14,876
I don't know what I'm doing!
Will you please help me?

938
01:31:19,506 --> 01:31:20,965
Dom!

939
01:31:36,982 --> 01:31:38,442
Jesse!

940
01:31:39,776 --> 01:31:40,986
Jesse!

941
01:31:41,236 --> 01:31:43,071
No, Jesse!

942
01:31:57,378 --> 01:31:59,296
No, Dom, no!

943
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:57,395
Call 911. You call 911!

944
01:35:32,180 --> 01:35:35,267
I used to drag here
back in high school.

945
01:35:35,642 --> 01:35:37,227
That railroad crossing up there...

946
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:40,188
is exactly a quarter mile
away from here.

947
01:35:40,939 --> 01:35:43,859
On green, I'm going for it.

948
01:38:07,672 --> 01:38:09,299
Dom!

949
01:38:18,099 --> 01:38:20,727
That's not what I had in mind.

950
01:39:06,983 --> 01:39:08,943
You know what you're doing?

951
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,529
I owe you a ten-second car.
