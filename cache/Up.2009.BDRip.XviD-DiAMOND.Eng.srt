00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:48,027
Movie Fan News presents:

2
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:51,059
Spotlight on "Adventure".

3
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:56,514
What you are now witnessing is footage
never before seen by civilized humanity,

4
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:58,123
a lost world in South America,

5
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,275
lurking in the shadow of
Majestic Paradise Falls

6
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,442
it's full of plants and
animals undiscovered by science.

7
00:01:03,477 --> 00:01:06,575
Who would dare set foot on
this inhospitable summit?

8
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,852
Why, our subject
today, Charles Muntz.

9
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:15,032
The beloved explorer lands his dirigible,
"The Spirit of Adventure", into Hampshire,

10
00:01:15,483 --> 00:01:17,777
completing a year
long expedition to the lost world.

11
00:01:18,987 --> 00:01:21,788
This mighty aircraft was
designed by Charles Muntz himself

12
00:01:21,823 --> 00:01:25,952
and is longer than 22 throw edition
petty wagons placed end to end.

13
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:28,309
And here comes
the adventurer now.

14
00:01:28,444 --> 00:01:30,797
Never-apart from
his faithful dogs,

15
00:01:30,832 --> 00:01:33,301
Muntz conceived the craft
for the canine comfort.

16
00:01:33,443 --> 00:01:35,677
It's a veritable
flouting palace in the sky

17
00:01:35,712 --> 00:01:38,923
complete with doggy baths
and mechanical canine walker.

18
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:44,826
And Jiminy Cricket! To the locals he's
considered a business and hero! And how!

19
00:01:45,131 --> 00:01:47,025
Adventure is out there!

20
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,693
But what has Muntz
brought back this time?

21
00:01:51,728 --> 00:01:56,416
Gentlemen, I give you the
Monster of Paradise Falls!

22
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,650
And gully, what a
swell monster this is!

23
00:02:01,485 --> 00:02:04,414
But what's this?
Scientists cry "Foul!"

24
00:02:04,449 --> 00:02:08,203
The National Explorers Society accuses
Muntz of fabricating the skeleton.

25
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:09,294
No!

26
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:13,042
The organization strips
Muntz of his membership.

27
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:18,483
Humiliated, Muntz vows to
return to Paradise Falls

28
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:21,132
and promises to capture
the beast... alive.

29
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:24,010
I promise to capture
the beast alive!

30
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,474
And I will not come
back until I do!

31
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,893
And so, the explorer's
off to clear his name.

32
00:02:31,928 --> 00:02:33,943
Bon voyage, Charles Muntz!

33
00:02:33,978 --> 00:02:38,691
And good luck capturing the
Monster of Paradise Falls!

34
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,465
SPIRIT OF ADVENTURE

35
00:02:45,907 --> 00:02:49,619
Here's Charles Muntz,
piloting his famous dirigible.

36
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:56,167
He hurdles Pikes Peak.

37
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:59,649
He hurdles the Grand Canyon.

38
00:02:59,684 --> 00:03:02,722
He hurdles Mount Everest!

39
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:06,761
He goes around Mount Everest!

40
00:03:06,803 --> 00:03:10,118
Is there nothing
he cannot do? UP

41
00:03:10,153 --> 00:03:13,434
Yes, as Muntz himself said,

42
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:15,182
"Adventure... "

43
00:03:15,217 --> 00:03:16,896
"is out there!"!

44
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,322
Look out! Mount Rushmore!

45
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:24,529
Let's get "The Spirit of
Adventure" over Mount Rushmore!

46
00:03:25,363 --> 00:03:26,948
Come on, make an effort!
How are my dogs doing?

47
00:03:27,615 --> 00:03:29,701
SPIRIT OF ADVENTURE

48
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:36,499
All engines ahead, let's
take her up to 26000 feet!

49
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:39,001
Rudder 18 degrees
towards South!

50
00:03:39,036 --> 00:03:40,843
It's a beautiful day.

51
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:43,131
The wind blows from
the east at 10 knots.

52
00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:45,390
Visibility... unlimited.

53
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,760
Enter the weather
in the log book!

54
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,030
There is something down there.
I will bring it back for the science!

55
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,241
Oh... It's a puppy!

56
00:03:54,976 --> 00:03:58,855
MUNTZ ALOFT: BREAKS
43,976 FEET ALTITUDE RECORD

57
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,314
What are you doing?

58
00:04:00,624 --> 00:04:03,101
Don't you know this
is an exclusive club?

59
00:04:03,436 --> 00:04:05,410
Only explorers get in here,

60
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:09,407
not just any kid off the street
with a helmet and a pair of goggles!

61
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:12,979
- You think you got what it takes? Do you?
- I...

62
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,622
All right, you're
in! Welcome aboard!

63
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,959
What's wrong? Can't you talk?

64
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,672
Hey, I don't bite.

65
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,562
You and me, we are in a club now!
GRAPE SODA

66
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:39,670
I saw where your balloon went.
Come on, let's go get it!

67
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,260
My name is Ellie.

68
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:47,490
There it is!

69
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:55,328
Well... go ahead.

70
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:59,567
Go on.

71
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,832
Hey, kid!

72
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:25,476
I thought you might need
a little cheering up.

73
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:28,447
I got something to show you!

74
00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:32,580
I am about to let
you see something

75
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:35,159
I have never shown to
another human being.

76
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:38,361
Ever... in my life!

77
00:05:38,996 --> 00:05:42,375
You have to swear you
will not tell anyone!

78
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:45,911
Cross your heart! Do it!

79
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:51,807
My adventure book!

80
00:05:51,842 --> 00:05:53,970
You know him.
C.MUNTZ, MAN OF THE YEAR.

81
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,896
Charles Muntz, explorer.

82
00:05:57,931 --> 00:06:01,226
When I get big, I'm
going where he's going.

83
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,019
South America.

84
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:06,648
It's like America, but South.

85
00:06:06,683 --> 00:06:09,443
Wander where I'm gonna live?

86
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:11,994
Paradise Falls.

87
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:14,746
A land lost in time.

88
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:18,911
I ripped this right
out of a library book!

89
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:21,159
I'm gonna move my
club house there!

90
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:23,373
And park up right
next to the falls.

91
00:06:23,408 --> 00:06:26,084
Who knows what lives up there!

92
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:28,552
And once I get there...

93
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:32,424
I'm gonna save all these pages for
all the adventures I'm gonna have.

94
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:38,305
Only... I just don't know how
I'm gonna get to Paradise Falls.

95
00:06:44,662 --> 00:06:47,219
That's it! You can take
us there in a blimp!

96
00:06:48,454 --> 00:06:51,276
Swear you'll take us
there! Cross your heart!

97
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,520
Cross it! Cross your heart!

98
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:56,365
Good, you promised.
No backing out!

99
00:06:57,141 --> 00:06:59,043
Well, see you tomorrow, kid. Bye!

100
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:03,206
Adventure is out there!

101
00:07:04,748 --> 00:07:08,043
You know, you don't
talk very much.

102
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:11,380
I like you.

103
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:45,489
Quite a sight, hey, Ellie?

104
00:13:48,317 --> 00:13:49,961
He... mail is here.

105
00:14:03,056 --> 00:14:08,186
SHADY OAKS,
Retirement Village, oh, brother!

106
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,549
Hey, good morning,
Mr. Fredricksen.

107
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:20,242
Need any help there?

108
00:14:20,377 --> 00:14:26,000
No... Yes... Tell your boss over there
that you boys are ruining our house.

109
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:27,823
Well, just to let you know,

110
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:31,387
my boss will be happy to take
this whole place off your hand...

111
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:33,105
...and would double
his last offer.

112
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,141
What do you say to that?

113
00:14:36,824 --> 00:14:39,025
I'll take that as a no, then.

114
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,322
I believe I made my position
to your boss quite clear.

115
00:14:42,657 --> 00:14:45,208
You poured prune
juice in his gas tank.

116
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:47,293
Yeah, that was good!

117
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:49,003
Here, let me talk to him.

118
00:14:50,713 --> 00:14:54,300
You, in the suit. Yes, you!

119
00:14:54,335 --> 00:14:56,844
Take a bath, hippie!

120
00:14:57,595 --> 00:14:59,062
I am not with him!

121
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:02,308
This is serious! He's
out to get your house!

122
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,686
Tell your boss he
can have our house.

123
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:06,569
Really?

124
00:15:06,604 --> 00:15:08,147
When I'm dead!

125
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:11,859
I'll take that as a "maybe".

126
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:17,198
Order now: you get the camera, you
get the printer, 4X optical zoom.

127
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,659
Schneider Lens.

128
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,076
Photo print...

129
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:22,453
SD card.

130
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:26,349
Good afternoon.

131
00:15:26,584 --> 00:15:27,874
My name is Russell

132
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:31,921
and I am a wilderness
explorer in tribe 54,

133
00:15:31,956 --> 00:15:33,387
squad lodge 12.

134
00:15:33,422 --> 00:15:36,509
Are you in need of any
assistance today, Sir?

135
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:37,475
No.

136
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:40,054
I could... help you
cross the street.

137
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:41,000
No.

138
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,141
I could help you
cross your... yard?

139
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,000
No.

140
00:15:45,017 --> 00:15:48,137
I could help you
cross your... porch.

141
00:15:48,172 --> 00:15:49,000
No.

142
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,932
Well, I gotta help
you cross something.

143
00:15:50,967 --> 00:15:53,276
No, I'm doing fine.

144
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:01,457
Good afternoon.

145
00:16:01,492 --> 00:16:03,292
- My name is Russell.
- Kid...

146
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,389
And I am a wilderness
explorer in tribe 54.

147
00:16:06,524 --> 00:16:07,547
Slow down...

148
00:16:07,782 --> 00:16:09,423
- ... squad lodge 12.
- Kid!

149
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,295
- Are you in need of any assistance?
- Thank you, but I don't need any help!

150
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:16,000
Aouch.

151
00:16:20,303 --> 00:16:22,103
Proceed.

152
00:16:22,138 --> 00:16:23,451
Good afternoon.

153
00:16:23,486 --> 00:16:24,765
Skip to the end!

154
00:16:26,475 --> 00:16:30,062
See these? These are my
wilderness explorer badges.

155
00:16:30,104 --> 00:16:32,196
You may notice one is missing.

156
00:16:32,231 --> 00:16:34,615
It's my "Assisting
the elderly badge".

157
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:39,864
If I get it, I'll become a
senior wilderness explorer!

158
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,659
The wilderness must be explored!

159
00:16:45,603 --> 00:16:46,886
It's gonna be great!

160
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:50,082
There is a big ceremony
and all the dads come and...

161
00:16:50,117 --> 00:16:51,834
we pin on our badges...

162
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:54,795
- So you wanna assist an old person.
- Yeah!

163
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,715
Then I'll be a senior
wilderness explorer!

164
00:16:59,175 --> 00:17:02,261
- Have you ever heard of a "snipe"?
- "Snipe"?

165
00:17:02,296 --> 00:17:03,936
A bird. Big eyes.

166
00:17:03,971 --> 00:17:06,107
Every night it
sneaks into my yard

167
00:17:06,342 --> 00:17:08,542
and gobbles my poor azaleas.

168
00:17:08,677 --> 00:17:10,403
I'm elderly and infirm.

169
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:11,978
I can't catch it.

170
00:17:12,113 --> 00:17:15,191
- If only someone could help me...
- Me, me, I'll do it!

171
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:17,526
I don't know, it's awfully crafty.

172
00:17:17,568 --> 00:17:20,179
You'd have to clap your hands three
times to lure it in.

173
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,971
I'll find her, Mr. Fredricksen!

174
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:24,492
I think its burrow
is two blocks down...

175
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:26,035
Two blocks down. Got it!

176
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,463
Snipe! Here, snipie, snipie...

177
00:17:30,998 --> 00:17:32,917
Bring it back here
when you find it!

178
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:34,460
Snipe!

179
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:40,174
...and stop... Stop... Stop!

180
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,510
Hey!

181
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:46,764
Hey, you! What do you think
you're doing?

182
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,837
I am so sorry, Sir.

183
00:17:47,872 --> 00:17:48,875
Don't touch that!

184
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,545
No, no, no, let me take
care of that for you.

185
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,019
Get away from our mailbox!

186
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:54,098
- Sir...
- I don't want you to touch that!

187
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,032
It looks bad.

188
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:34,305
COURT SUMMONS

189
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,148
Sorry, Mr. Fredricksen.

190
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:47,060
You don't seem like
a public menace to me.

191
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:48,876
Take this.

192
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:52,031
The guys from "Shady Oaks" will be
by to pick you up in the morning, ok?

193
00:19:07,088 --> 00:19:09,090
What do I do now, Ellie?

194
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:40,521
Good morning, gentlemen.

195
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:42,266
Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen.

196
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,559
You're ready to go?

197
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:47,069
Ready as I'll ever be.

198
00:20:47,104 --> 00:20:49,127
Would you do me the
favour and take this?

199
00:20:49,162 --> 00:20:51,115
I'll meet you in the
van in just a minute.

200
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:55,905
I... wanna say one last
goodbye to the old place.

201
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,832
Sure. Take all the
time you need, Sir.

202
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:05,414
That's typical. He's probably going
to the bathroom for the 80th time.

203
00:21:05,449 --> 00:21:10,419
You'd think he'd take
better care of his house.

204
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,593
So long, boys!

205
00:21:52,628 --> 00:21:57,758
I'll send you a postcard
from Paradise Falls!

206
00:22:49,178 --> 00:22:51,417
SOUTH AMERICA

207
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,222
We are on our way, Ellie.

208
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,605
Hi, Mr. Fredricksen.

209
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,169
It's me, Russell.

210
00:24:39,569 --> 00:24:41,661
What are you doing
out here, kid?

211
00:24:41,696 --> 00:24:45,325
I found the snipe and I
followed it under your porch.

212
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,876
But this snipe had a long tail

213
00:24:47,911 --> 00:24:50,789
and looked more like a large mouse.

214
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,463
Please, let me in.

215
00:24:58,505 --> 00:25:01,675
No.

216
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:08,054
Aw, all right. You can come... in.

217
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,777
I've never been in a
floating house before.

218
00:25:22,237 --> 00:25:24,698
Goggles...
Look at this stuff!

219
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:26,581
Are you going on a trip?

220
00:25:26,616 --> 00:25:30,085
"Paradise Falls, a
land lost in time".

221
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,247
Are you going to South
America, Mr. Fredricksen?

222
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:34,333
Don't touch that!
You'll soil it.

223
00:25:34,468 --> 00:25:36,584
You know, most
people take a plane.

224
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:37,801
But you're smart,

225
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,879
because you have your
TV, clocks and stuff.

226
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:42,173
Ooo, is this how
you steer your house?

227
00:25:42,966 --> 00:25:46,636
Does it really work?

228
00:25:46,928 --> 00:25:51,433
This makes it turn right
and that way is left.

229
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:54,234
Hey, look! Buildings!

230
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:58,148
That building's so close,
I can almost touch it!

231
00:25:59,566 --> 00:26:02,742
Wow, this is great!

232
00:26:02,777 --> 00:26:04,828
You should try this,
Mr. Fredricksen.

233
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,991
Look, there's a bus that could
take me home two blocks away!

234
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:10,910
Hey, I can see your
house from here!

235
00:26:11,953 --> 00:26:13,788
Don't jerk around
so much, kid!

236
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:17,507
Well, that's not gonna work.

237
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:20,920
I know that cloud,
it's a "cumulonimbus".

238
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:24,174
Did you know that
a cumulonimbus...

239
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,512
Aaa, I stayed up all night
blowing up balloons... for what?

240
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:31,473
That's nice, kid.

241
00:26:38,104 --> 00:26:41,357
What are you doing over there?

242
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:44,527
Look!

243
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:56,456
See? Cumulonimbus.

244
00:27:31,866 --> 00:27:33,243
My bag!

245
00:27:38,065 --> 00:27:39,107
Got you!

246
00:28:15,952 --> 00:28:18,705
Uuu, I thought you were dead.

247
00:28:21,624 --> 00:28:22,674
What happened?

248
00:28:22,709 --> 00:28:25,962
I steered us. I did
it! I steered the house.

249
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,428
You steered us?

250
00:28:27,463 --> 00:28:30,133
After you tied your stuff
down, you took a nap.

251
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:33,428
So I went ahead and
steered us down here.

252
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:37,140
Yeah, sure.

253
00:28:46,482 --> 00:28:49,158
I can't tell where we are.

254
00:28:49,193 --> 00:28:50,952
O, we're in South
America all right.

255
00:28:50,987 --> 00:28:54,824
It was a singe. I used my
wilderness explorer GPS.

256
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:55,999
GP... what?

257
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,500
My dad gave it to me.

258
00:28:57,535 --> 00:29:02,081
It shows exactly where
we are on the planet.

259
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:06,836
With this baby
we'll never be lost!

260
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,477
We'll get you down,
find a bus stop,

261
00:29:14,512 --> 00:29:17,607
and you'll just tell the man you
want to get back to your mother.

262
00:29:17,642 --> 00:29:21,836
Sure, but I don't think they
have buses in Paradise Falls.

263
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,571
There, that ought to do it.

264
00:29:26,606 --> 00:29:28,684
There, I'll give you some
change for the bus fare.

265
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:30,953
No, I'll just use
my city bus pass.

266
00:29:32,495 --> 00:29:37,010
It's just gonna be like a billion
passes to get back to my house.

267
00:29:43,664 --> 00:29:45,808
Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?

268
00:29:46,043 --> 00:29:47,948
Well, we're up pretty high.

269
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:50,254
It'll take hours to get down.

270
00:29:52,548 --> 00:29:54,759
I think that was a
building or something.

271
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:58,436
What was that,
Mr. Fredricksen?

272
00:29:58,471 --> 00:30:01,266
We can't be close
to the ground yet.

273
00:30:10,233 --> 00:30:12,109
Wait, no, no!

274
00:30:13,694 --> 00:30:15,154
Wait, wait!

275
00:30:18,825 --> 00:30:22,286
Hang on!

276
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:36,592
Pull back!

277
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:52,823
Where... where are we?

278
00:30:52,858 --> 00:30:57,071
This doesn't look like the city
or the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.

279
00:30:59,422 --> 00:31:03,119
Don't worry, Ellie. I've got it.

280
00:31:26,775 --> 00:31:29,447
There it is!

281
00:31:56,856 --> 00:32:00,593
Ellie, it's so beautiful!

282
00:32:01,328 --> 00:32:02,893
We made it!

283
00:32:02,928 --> 00:32:06,640
We made it! Russell, we
can float right over there.

284
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,607
Climb up, climb up!

285
00:32:08,642 --> 00:32:09,775
Do you mean... assist you?

286
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,896
- Yeah, whatever.
- Ok, I'll climb up!

287
00:32:18,277 --> 00:32:19,361
- Watch it!
- Sorry.

288
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:31,040
Now... when you get up there,
go ahead and hoist me up.

289
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:33,959
Got it?

290
00:32:37,713 --> 00:32:39,423
Are you on the porch yet?

291
00:32:46,305 --> 00:32:47,772
What? That's it?

292
00:32:47,807 --> 00:32:53,479
I came all this way here to get stuck
on the wrong end of this rock pile?

293
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:57,817
Ah... great.

294
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:03,072
Hey, if I could assist
you over there...

295
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:06,116
would you sign
up for my badge?

296
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,583
What are you talking about?

297
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,787
We could walk your
house to the fall.

298
00:33:10,087 --> 00:33:11,789
- Walk it?
- Yeah.

299
00:33:11,831 --> 00:33:15,584
After all we weigh it down, we
could walk it right over there.

300
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,795
Like a parade balloon.

301
00:33:21,841 --> 00:33:25,135
Now, we'll walk to the
falls quickly and quietly,

302
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,394
with no rap music
or flash dancing.

303
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:32,101
We have three days at best till the
helium leaks out of those balloons.

304
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:35,271
And if we are not at the
falls when that happens...

305
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:37,565
we're not getting
to the falls.

306
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,855
There... I found sand!

307
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:42,076
Don't you worry, Ellie.

308
00:33:42,111 --> 00:33:44,363
We'll get our
house over there.

309
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:50,828
It is fun already, isn't it?

310
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:52,705
By the time we get there,

311
00:33:52,746 --> 00:33:56,333
You're gonna feel so
assisted... Oh, Mr. Fredricksen,

312
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,623
if we happen to get separated,

313
00:33:58,658 --> 00:34:00,879
use the wilderness
explorer call.

314
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:07,136
Wait, why are we going
to Paradise Falls, again?

315
00:34:07,177 --> 00:34:08,769
Hey, let's play a game.

316
00:34:08,804 --> 00:34:12,474
It's called: "See who
can be quiet the longest".

317
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,810
Cool! My mom loves that game!

318
00:35:17,706 --> 00:35:21,126
Darn thing...

319
00:35:21,168 --> 00:35:23,337
Come on, Russell, hurry it up.

320
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:25,294
Ah, I'm tired.

321
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:27,461
My knee hurts.

322
00:35:27,496 --> 00:35:29,593
Which knee?

323
00:35:29,635 --> 00:35:33,931
My elbow hurts and I have
to go to the bathroom.

324
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:36,517
I asked you about
that five minutes ago.

325
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:40,163
I didn't have to go then!

326
00:35:40,198 --> 00:35:43,774
I don't wanna walk anymore...

327
00:35:43,816 --> 00:35:46,825
Please, stop...

328
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:49,488
Russell, if you don't hurry
up, the tigers will eat you.

329
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:52,241
There are no tigers
in South America.

330
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:56,411
Zoology.

331
00:35:56,453 --> 00:35:59,623
Ah, for the love of Pete... Go on
into the bushes and do your business.

332
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:03,293
Ok. Here! Hold my stuff!

333
00:36:03,418 --> 00:36:06,130
I've always
wanted to try this.

334
00:36:09,424 --> 00:36:14,847
Mr. Fredricksen, am I suppose
to dig the hole before or after?

335
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:18,142
That's none of my concern.

336
00:36:18,183 --> 00:36:21,228
Oh, it's "before"!

337
00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:30,362
Tracks?

338
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,288
Snipe.

339
00:36:33,323 --> 00:36:36,166
Here, snipe.

340
00:36:36,201 --> 00:36:38,328
Come on out, snipe.

341
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,747
Snipe!

342
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:03,604
Got you. Don't be
afraid, little snipe.

343
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,404
I am a wilderness explorer,

344
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:08,400
so I'm a friend
to all of nature.

345
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:13,155
Want some more?

346
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,532
Hi, boy. Don't eat it all.

347
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,409
Come on out.

348
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:21,878
Come on. Come on...

349
00:37:21,913 --> 00:37:24,457
Don't be afraid, little snipe.

350
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,002
Nice snipe. Good little snipe.

351
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:31,465
Nice... giant snipe!

352
00:37:36,518 --> 00:37:37,904
I found the snipe.

353
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:39,539
Oh, did you?

354
00:37:39,974 --> 00:37:42,267
- Are they tall?
- Oh, yes. They're very tall.

355
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:43,852
Do they have a lot of colors?

356
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,360
They do, indeed.

357
00:37:45,395 --> 00:37:47,898
- Do they like chocolate?
- Oh, yeah...

358
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:51,193
Chocolate?

359
00:37:51,234 --> 00:37:53,445
What is that thing?

360
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,637
It's a snipe.

361
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:56,658
There no such
thing as a snipe!

362
00:37:57,093 --> 00:37:59,619
But you said...

363
00:38:01,161 --> 00:38:03,872
Go on, get out of here! Go!

364
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:15,891
Careful, Russell.

365
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:19,471
Look, Mr. Fredricksen,
he likes me.

366
00:38:19,513 --> 00:38:23,016
- Russell!
- No, stop! That tickles!

367
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,727
Get out of here!
Go on! Get!

368
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:36,425
No, no, no. Kevin, it's ok.

369
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,664
Mr. Fredricksen is nice.

370
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:41,644
- Kevin?
- Yes, that's the name I just gave him.

371
00:38:43,011 --> 00:38:44,500
Bit it, boo, scram!

372
00:38:45,635 --> 00:38:46,790
Hey, that's mine!

373
00:38:51,086 --> 00:38:53,755
Aah... Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!

374
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,007
Go on, bit it!

375
00:39:01,763 --> 00:39:02,947
Can we keep him? Please?

376
00:39:03,182 --> 00:39:06,610
I'll get the food for him, I'll walk
him, I'll change his newspapers...

377
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:07,712
No.

378
00:39:08,895 --> 00:39:11,571
An explorer is a friend to all,

379
00:39:11,606 --> 00:39:13,650
be it a plant, a fish or a tiny mole.

380
00:39:13,692 --> 00:39:15,269
That doesn't even rhyme.

381
00:39:15,304 --> 00:39:16,629
Yeah, it does.

382
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:19,313
- Hey, look, Kevin.
- What?

383
00:39:19,948 --> 00:39:23,609
Hey, get down from there!
You're not allowed up there!

384
00:39:25,778 --> 00:39:27,633
You come down here right now!

385
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,671
Can you believe this, Ellie?

386
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:35,980
Ellie?

387
00:39:37,215 --> 00:39:39,634
Hey, Ellie, can
I keep the bird?

388
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:42,220
Aha... aha

389
00:39:43,362 --> 00:39:44,980
She said for you to let me.

390
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:47,392
But I told him
no. I told you no.

391
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,769
N - O!

392
00:40:00,071 --> 00:40:02,741
I see you, back there.

393
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:08,079
Go on, get out of here! Shoo! Go
annoy someone else for a while.

394
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,916
Hey, are you ok over there?

395
00:40:13,084 --> 00:40:16,463
Hello?

396
00:40:21,142 --> 00:40:24,319
Oh, hello, Sir.
Thank Goodness.

397
00:40:24,354 --> 00:40:27,273
It's nice to know
someone else is up here.

398
00:40:27,308 --> 00:40:29,025
I can smell you.

399
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,284
What?

400
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:33,034
You can... smell us?

401
00:40:34,169 --> 00:40:35,850
I can smell you.

402
00:40:44,082 --> 00:40:47,293
- Hey!
- You were talking to a rock.

403
00:40:47,328 --> 00:40:50,505
Hey, that one
looks like a turtle.

404
00:40:50,546 --> 00:40:52,882
Look at that one! That
one looks like a dog!

405
00:40:53,758 --> 00:40:56,643
- Ah, it is a dog.
- What?

406
00:40:56,678 --> 00:41:00,598
We're not allowed to have
dogs in my apartment.

407
00:41:02,165 --> 00:41:04,289
Hey, I like dogs!

408
00:41:04,324 --> 00:41:05,879
We have your dog!

409
00:41:07,814 --> 00:41:09,482
- I wonder whom he belongs to.
- Sit, boy.

410
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,275
Hey, look, he's trained!

411
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,325
Shake.

412
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,216
Aha. Speak.

413
00:41:14,251 --> 00:41:16,072
Hi, there.

414
00:41:16,572 --> 00:41:18,950
Did that dog just
say "Hi, there"?

415
00:41:18,985 --> 00:41:20,868
Oh, yes!

416
00:41:20,994 --> 00:41:24,288
My name is Dug. I just
met you and I love you.

417
00:41:24,497 --> 00:41:27,173
My master made me this collar.

418
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:29,928
He is a good and smart master
and he made me this collar

419
00:41:30,263 --> 00:41:33,190
so that I may talk. Squirrel!

420
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:35,717
My master is good and smart.

421
00:41:35,752 --> 00:41:36,816
It's not possible.

422
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:38,732
Oh yes... It is... because my
master is smart.

423
00:41:39,067 --> 00:41:41,013
Hey, cool! What
do these do, boy?

424
00:41:41,048 --> 00:41:46,973
Would you cut... I'd use that collar... I
would be happy if you stopped.

425
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,262
Russell, don't touch that.

426
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,122
It could be...
radioactive or something.

427
00:41:51,357 --> 00:41:53,693
I am a great tracker. My master
sent me on a special mission.

428
00:41:53,728 --> 00:41:56,202
All by myself. Have
you seen a bird?

429
00:41:56,237 --> 00:41:58,593
I want to find one and
I've been on a scent.

430
00:41:58,628 --> 00:42:00,950
I'm a great tracker.
Did I mention that?

431
00:42:02,785 --> 00:42:06,864
Hey, that is a bird. I have never seen
one up close. But this is the bird.

432
00:42:07,007 --> 00:42:09,401
May I take your bird up
to camp as my prisoner?

433
00:42:09,636 --> 00:42:13,351
Yes, yes, take it. And on the way,
learn how to bark like a real dog.

434
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:17,097
I can bark... And here's howling.

435
00:42:20,344 --> 00:42:23,723
Can we keep him, please?
Please, please, please?

436
00:42:23,758 --> 00:42:27,101
- No.
- But it's a talking dog!

437
00:42:27,268 --> 00:42:29,228
It's just a weird
trick or something.

438
00:42:29,263 --> 00:42:31,397
Let's get to the fall.

439
00:42:31,439 --> 00:42:35,327
Please, be my prisoner! Oh,
please oh, please, be my prisoner!

440
00:42:37,246 --> 00:42:40,531
Oh, here it is! I picked
up the bird's scent!

441
00:42:40,566 --> 00:42:42,617
Wait a minute, wait a
minute. What is this?

442
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,126
Chocolate. I smell chocolate.

443
00:42:45,561 --> 00:42:48,106
I'm getting prunes
and ginger cream.

444
00:42:48,241 --> 00:42:49,505
Who are they?

445
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,175
Oh, man, the master
will not be pleased.

446
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:56,047
We'd better tell him someone
took the bird, right, Alfa?

447
00:42:56,914 --> 00:43:00,414
No. Soon enough the bird
will be ours again.

448
00:43:01,003 --> 00:43:05,618
Find the scent, my compadres, and you too,
shall have much rewarding from the master

449
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,481
for the toil that you did.

450
00:43:07,616 --> 00:43:11,779
Hey, Alfa, I think there's
something wrong with your collar.

451
00:43:12,014 --> 00:43:13,147
You must have broken it.

452
00:43:13,282 --> 00:43:15,411
Yeah. Your voice sounds funny.

453
00:43:19,153 --> 00:43:20,279
Beta, Delta!

454
00:43:20,321 --> 00:43:23,424
Perhaps you deSire... Squirrel!

455
00:43:24,659 --> 00:43:28,261
Perhaps you deSire to challenge the right
that I have been assigned

456
00:43:28,396 --> 00:43:29,664
by my strength and cunning.

457
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:31,164
No, no. No.

458
00:43:31,299 --> 00:43:34,298
But maybe Dug would.
You might wanna ask him.

459
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,416
I wonder if he's found the bird
on his "very special mission".

460
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:42,450
Do not mention Dug to me at this time.

461
00:43:42,585 --> 00:43:47,147
His fool's errand will keep him most
occupied, most occupied, indeed.

462
00:43:48,808 --> 00:43:51,400
Do you not agree with that
which I'm saying to you now?

463
00:43:51,435 --> 00:43:56,357
Sure. But the second the master finds
out that you sent Dug out by himself,

464
00:43:56,392 --> 00:43:59,568
none of us will get a treat.

465
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,721
You're unwise, my trusted lieutenant.

466
00:44:03,456 --> 00:44:06,062
This is Alfa. Calling
Dug. Come in, Dug.

467
00:44:06,097 --> 00:44:08,668
Hi, Alfa. Your
voice sounds funny.

468
00:44:08,703 --> 00:44:10,211
I know, I know!

469
00:44:10,246 --> 00:44:12,080
Have you seen the bird?

470
00:44:12,315 --> 00:44:15,042
Oh, yes. The bird
is my prisoner now.

471
00:44:15,077 --> 00:44:17,294
Yeah, right.

472
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:20,179
Impossible. Where are you?

473
00:44:20,214 --> 00:44:25,642
I am here with the bird and I will bring it
back, and then you like me. Oh, gotta go.

474
00:44:25,677 --> 00:44:26,894
Dug, who are you talking to?

475
00:44:26,929 --> 00:44:28,952
- Wait, wait!
- What is Dug doing?

476
00:44:28,987 --> 00:44:30,975
Why is he with
the small mailman?

477
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:33,098
Where are they?

478
00:44:35,433 --> 00:44:37,003
There he is. Come on!

479
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:44,613
Please, oh, please,
be my prisoner.

480
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:45,964
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!

481
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:48,176
That man over there
says I can take the bird.

482
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:50,953
And I love that man there
like he is my master.

483
00:44:50,995 --> 00:44:52,129
I am not your master!

484
00:44:52,364 --> 00:44:53,980
I am warning you once again, bird!

485
00:44:54,115 --> 00:44:56,576
- Hey, quit it!
- I am jumping on you now, bird!

486
00:44:56,709 --> 00:44:59,128
At this rate we will
never get to the falls!

487
00:45:06,385 --> 00:45:09,103
I am nobody's master, got it?

488
00:45:09,138 --> 00:45:11,432
I don't want you here
and I don't want you here!

489
00:45:11,467 --> 00:45:13,166
I'm stuck with you!

490
00:45:13,601 --> 00:45:16,145
If you two don't clear out of here
by the time I count to three...

491
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,815
A ball! Oh, boy, oh, boy, a ball!

492
00:45:19,156 --> 00:45:22,459
Ball? You want a ball?

493
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:26,155
Yes, I do! I ever so want the ball!

494
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,000
Go get it!

495
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,200
Oh, boy, I will get it and then
bring it back!

496
00:45:29,235 --> 00:45:32,077
Quick, Russell, give
me some chocolate.

497
00:45:32,112 --> 00:45:33,621
- Why?
- Just give to me!

498
00:45:33,656 --> 00:45:35,498
Bird! Bird!

499
00:45:37,223 --> 00:45:38,951
Come on, Russell.

500
00:45:39,084 --> 00:45:42,254
Wait! Wait, Mr. Fredricksen!

501
00:45:46,634 --> 00:45:48,928
What are you doing?

502
00:45:53,015 --> 00:45:56,268
Hey, we're pretty far now.

503
00:45:56,303 --> 00:45:58,270
Kevin's gonna miss.

504
00:46:03,025 --> 00:46:06,654
I think that did the trick.

505
00:46:06,862 --> 00:46:09,323
Hi, master.

506
00:46:09,365 --> 00:46:11,784
Afternoon.

507
00:46:35,724 --> 00:46:40,020
Well, thanks for keeping
us dry, anyway, Ellie.

508
00:46:40,055 --> 00:46:42,606
Which one is the front?

509
00:46:42,648 --> 00:46:45,282
Well, boy...

510
00:46:45,317 --> 00:46:49,863
Is this step
three or step five?

511
00:46:49,947 --> 00:46:52,116
There.

512
00:46:55,286 --> 00:46:59,665
All done. That's for you.

513
00:47:04,878 --> 00:47:07,721
Well, tents are hard.

514
00:47:07,756 --> 00:47:10,634
Wait, aren't you
super wilderness guy

515
00:47:10,669 --> 00:47:13,220
with the GPS and the badges?

516
00:47:13,255 --> 00:47:15,014
Yeah, but...

517
00:47:15,264 --> 00:47:18,273
Can I tell you a secret?

518
00:47:18,308 --> 00:47:21,318
- No.
- All right. Here it goes.

519
00:47:21,353 --> 00:47:24,898
I never actually built a
tent before. There! I said it.

520
00:47:25,065 --> 00:47:27,985
You've been camping
before, haven't you?

521
00:47:28,235 --> 00:47:31,078
Well, never outside...

522
00:47:31,113 --> 00:47:34,575
Well, why didn't you ask
your dad how to build a tent?

523
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:37,745
I don't think he wants
to talk about this stuff.

524
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,706
Try him sometime, maybe
he'll surprise you.

525
00:47:40,741 --> 00:47:43,167
He's away a lot, I
don't see him much.

526
00:47:43,202 --> 00:47:44,842
He's gotta be home sometime.

527
00:47:44,877 --> 00:47:49,179
I call, but Phyllis told
me I bug him too much.

528
00:47:49,214 --> 00:47:52,342
Phyllis? You call your own
mother by her first name?

529
00:47:52,426 --> 00:47:56,096
- Phyllis isn't my mom.
- Oh!

530
00:48:05,397 --> 00:48:09,193
But he promised he'd come
to my Explorers Ceremony

531
00:48:09,228 --> 00:48:11,987
to pin on my "Assisting
the elderly badge".

532
00:48:12,446 --> 00:48:16,450
So he can show me how
about the tent then, right?

533
00:48:22,247 --> 00:48:25,758
Hey, why don't
you get some sleep?

534
00:48:25,793 --> 00:48:29,713
We don't want to wake the
travelling flea circus.

535
00:48:31,715 --> 00:48:34,843
Dle Fredricksen, Dug says he
wants to take Kevin prisoner.

536
00:48:34,885 --> 00:48:38,722
We have to protect him.

537
00:48:41,725 --> 00:48:44,373
Can Kevin go with us?

538
00:48:44,408 --> 00:48:46,987
All right, he can come.

539
00:48:47,022 --> 00:48:49,358
Promise you won't leave him?

540
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:50,532
Yeah.

541
00:48:50,567 --> 00:48:52,213
Cross your heart?

542
00:49:00,725 --> 00:49:03,205
Cross my heart.

543
00:49:08,085 --> 00:49:11,255
What have I got myself into, Ellie?

544
00:49:32,568 --> 00:49:35,279
Good morning, sweetheart.

545
00:49:37,097 --> 00:49:39,491
We'd better get moving.

546
00:49:41,785 --> 00:49:44,782
The bird's gone. Maybe
Russell won't notice.

547
00:49:45,417 --> 00:49:47,208
All right, everybody up!

548
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:50,460
Where's Kevin?
He's wondered off!

549
00:49:50,794 --> 00:49:53,296
- Dug, find Kevin!
- Find the bird, find the bird!

550
00:49:54,963 --> 00:49:55,847
Point!

551
00:49:55,882 --> 00:49:57,843
Oh, look! There he is...

552
00:50:00,419 --> 00:50:01,353
Point!

553
00:50:01,488 --> 00:50:05,074
Hey, that's my roof!
Get off my roof!

554
00:50:05,209 --> 00:50:07,227
Yeah, get off of his WROOF!

555
00:50:12,006 --> 00:50:13,824
What is he doing?

556
00:50:13,859 --> 00:50:16,069
The bird is calling
to her babies.

557
00:50:17,404 --> 00:50:19,496
Her babies!

558
00:50:19,831 --> 00:50:21,843
Kevin is a... girl?

559
00:50:23,869 --> 00:50:26,580
Her house is over there,
on those twisty rocks.

560
00:50:26,872 --> 00:50:31,043
She's been gathering food for her
babies and must get back to them.

561
00:50:31,078 --> 00:50:34,129
Wait, Kevin is just leaving.

562
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:39,224
But you promised
to protect her.

563
00:50:39,259 --> 00:50:42,429
Her babies need her. We gotta
make sure they're together.

564
00:50:42,464 --> 00:50:45,474
Sorry, Russell. We've
lost enough time already.

565
00:50:47,416 --> 00:50:48,602
Yeah...

566
00:50:55,108 --> 00:50:58,577
It was her favorite chocolate.

567
00:50:58,612 --> 00:51:03,617
Because you sent her
away, there's more for you.

568
00:51:05,494 --> 00:51:08,413
Kevin?

569
00:51:26,473 --> 00:51:28,934
Where's the bird? You
said you had the bird!

570
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:31,120
Oh, yes, oh, yes.
If I had said that,

571
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:33,271
I can see how you
would think that.

572
00:51:33,306 --> 00:51:34,397
Where is it?

573
00:51:34,439 --> 00:51:40,455
Oh, tomorrow. Come back tomorrow and
then I will again have the bird. Yes.

574
00:51:41,988 --> 00:51:45,783
You lost it. why do I not
have a surprised feeling?

575
00:51:45,818 --> 00:51:49,638
Well, at least you now have led us
to the small mailman

576
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:52,558
and to the one that smells as prunes.

577
00:51:53,542 --> 00:51:56,336
The master will be most
pleased we have found them.

578
00:51:56,371 --> 00:51:58,004
He will ask them
many questions. Come.

579
00:51:58,039 --> 00:52:00,841
Wait! We're not
going with you.

580
00:52:00,876 --> 00:52:02,467
We're going to the fall.

581
00:52:04,469 --> 00:52:06,721
Get away from me!

582
00:53:05,572 --> 00:53:06,823
Down!

583
00:53:15,248 --> 00:53:17,959
You came here... in that?

584
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:19,377
Yeah.

585
00:53:20,253 --> 00:53:24,215
In a house? A floating house?

586
00:53:31,681 --> 00:53:35,560
That is the darnest
thing I've ever seen!

587
00:53:35,595 --> 00:53:38,570
You're not after
my bird, are you?

588
00:53:38,605 --> 00:53:42,984
But if you need to borrow a cup
of sugar, I'd be happy to oblige!

589
00:53:47,155 --> 00:53:49,657
Well, this is all
a misunderstanding.

590
00:53:49,692 --> 00:53:51,708
My dogs made a mistake.

591
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:54,746
Wait. Are you Charles Muntz?

592
00:53:54,781 --> 00:53:57,672
Well... yes.

593
00:53:57,707 --> 00:53:59,813
THE Charles Muntz?

594
00:53:59,848 --> 00:54:01,920
Adventure's out there!

595
00:54:01,955 --> 00:54:03,678
It's really him!

596
00:54:03,713 --> 00:54:05,924
That's Charles Muntz!

597
00:54:05,959 --> 00:54:07,057
It is?

598
00:54:07,092 --> 00:54:08,885
Who's Charles Muntz?

599
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:09,934
Him!

600
00:54:09,969 --> 00:54:14,057
Carl Fredricksen. My wife and
I, we were your biggest fans.

601
00:54:14,092 --> 00:54:18,353
Oh, well, you're a
man of good taste.

602
00:54:18,603 --> 00:54:21,606
Now you must be tired. Hungry?

603
00:54:21,856 --> 00:54:25,568
Attention, everyone! These
people are no longer intruders.

604
00:54:25,603 --> 00:54:27,362
They are our guests.

605
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:29,245
Yeah!

606
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,743
All right! I like
you temporarily.

607
00:54:34,536 --> 00:54:37,837
I will not bite you.

608
00:54:37,872 --> 00:54:40,792
The small mailman
smells like chocolate!

609
00:54:40,827 --> 00:54:43,134
I'm sorry about the dogs,

610
00:54:43,169 --> 00:54:45,678
I hope they weren't
too... rough on you.

611
00:54:45,713 --> 00:54:50,969
Go ahead and pull your
airship right next to mine.

612
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:58,852
We are not actually going inside
the "Spirit of Adventure" itself?

613
00:54:58,887 --> 00:55:01,980
Oh, would you like to?

614
00:55:02,015 --> 00:55:04,566
Would I?

615
00:55:05,741 --> 00:55:07,547
Wait up, Mr. Muntz!

616
00:55:08,482 --> 00:55:10,119
Jiminy Cricket!

617
00:55:10,154 --> 00:55:12,288
- Not you!
- What do we do with Dug?

618
00:55:12,323 --> 00:55:15,869
He lost the bird. Put him
in "the cone of shame".

619
00:55:21,205 --> 00:55:23,585
I do not like "the
cone of shame".

620
00:55:25,044 --> 00:55:27,922
Most of the collection is housed
in the world's top museums:

621
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:30,306
New York, Münich, London.

622
00:55:30,341 --> 00:55:32,969
Of course, I kept
the best for myself.

623
00:55:33,004 --> 00:55:35,760
Did you ever. Look at that!

624
00:55:35,795 --> 00:55:38,481
Oh, yes. The Arseloterium.

625
00:55:38,516 --> 00:55:41,352
The beast charged while
I was brushing my teeth.

626
00:55:41,387 --> 00:55:42,562
I used my shaving
kit to bring it down.

627
00:55:42,687 --> 00:55:46,197
Oh, yeah, now, surprise me.

628
00:55:46,232 --> 00:55:49,768
The only way to get it out of Ethiopia at
the time was to have it declared

629
00:55:49,803 --> 00:55:50,862
technical weapon.

630
00:55:52,864 --> 00:55:55,533
Oh, my Gosh! The giant
Somalian Labradodis!

631
00:55:55,568 --> 00:55:57,990
Oh, you recognize
it? I'm impressed!

632
00:55:58,025 --> 00:56:00,413
There's an interesting
story there.

633
00:56:00,448 --> 00:56:02,745
Excellent choice.

634
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:05,043
I found it on safari,

635
00:56:05,078 --> 00:56:06,676
with Roosevelt.

636
00:56:06,711 --> 00:56:10,590
He and I fell into a habit of
playing Gin Rummy in the evenings

637
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:12,859
and did he cheat!

638
00:56:12,894 --> 00:56:15,094
He was horrible.

639
00:56:17,472 --> 00:56:18,973
Master, dinner is ready.

640
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:20,440
Oh, dear, broken translator.

641
00:56:20,475 --> 00:56:24,312
I think it's that
loose wire again.

642
00:56:24,437 --> 00:56:26,481
- There you go, big fellow.
- Thank you, master.

643
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:29,859
I liked his other voice.

644
00:56:29,942 --> 00:56:32,028
Well, dinner is served.

645
00:56:32,063 --> 00:56:33,571
Right this way.

646
00:56:33,738 --> 00:56:37,582
So, how are
things States side?

647
00:56:37,617 --> 00:56:40,703
Almost tempted to
go back a few times.

648
00:56:41,496 --> 00:56:44,227
But I have
unfinished work here.

649
00:56:44,262 --> 00:56:46,924
Please! I hope you're hungry.

650
00:56:46,959 --> 00:56:51,464
Because Epsilon is the
finest chef I've ever had.

651
00:56:57,053 --> 00:56:59,263
Epsilon, you've done it again!

652
00:56:59,298 --> 00:57:00,306
Yeah!

653
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:03,941
Hey! Hey!

654
00:57:03,976 --> 00:57:07,563
My Ellie would have
loved all these.

655
00:57:07,605 --> 00:57:10,045
You know, because of
you she had this dream

656
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,679
to come down here
and live by the fall.

657
00:57:12,714 --> 00:57:15,244
I'm honored. And
now you've made it.

658
00:57:15,279 --> 00:57:18,032
You sure we're not a
bother? I'd hate to impose.

659
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:20,368
No, no, it's a
pleasure to have guests.

660
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:22,036
A real treat.

661
00:57:22,671 --> 00:57:23,794
Treat?

662
00:57:24,229 --> 00:57:26,140
Where's my treat?
I want my treat!

663
00:57:27,623 --> 00:57:28,216
Hey!

664
00:57:28,251 --> 00:57:29,710
I shouldn't have
used that word.

665
00:57:29,745 --> 00:57:32,053
Having guests is a delight!

666
00:57:32,888 --> 00:57:36,884
More often I get thieves trying
to steal what is rightfully mine.

667
00:57:36,919 --> 00:57:38,094
No...

668
00:57:40,429 --> 00:57:43,307
They called me
a fraud, those...

669
00:57:45,492 --> 00:57:49,271
But once I bring back this
creature, my name will be cleared.

670
00:57:50,413 --> 00:57:52,191
Beautiful, isn't it?

671
00:57:54,902 --> 00:57:57,238
Oh, I've spent a
lifetime tracking it.

672
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:01,909
Sometimes, years go by

673
00:58:01,944 --> 00:58:03,793
between seeings.

674
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:09,405
I've tried to smoke it out of
that death land where it lives.

675
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:11,847
Can't go in after it.

676
00:58:11,882 --> 00:58:14,802
Once in, there's no way out.

677
00:58:14,837 --> 00:58:18,103
I lost so many dogs.

678
00:58:19,238 --> 00:58:24,019
Here they come those bandits and
think the bird is theirs to take!

679
00:58:24,498 --> 00:58:30,218
They'll soon find that this mountain
is a very dangerous place.

680
00:58:32,527 --> 00:58:35,388
Hey, that looks like Kevin!

681
00:58:36,823 --> 00:58:39,826
- Kevin?
- Yeah, that's my new giant pet bird!

682
00:58:39,861 --> 00:58:41,745
I trained it to follow us.

683
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:44,087
Follow you?

684
00:58:44,122 --> 00:58:45,345
Impossible. How?

685
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,196
She likes chocolate.

686
00:58:47,631 --> 00:58:48,577
- Chocolate?

687
00:58:48,712 --> 00:58:52,288
- Yeah. I gave her some of my chocolate.
She goes gaga for it.

688
00:58:52,523 --> 00:58:53,800
But it ran off.

689
00:58:53,935 --> 00:58:54,977
Let's go now.

690
00:59:01,797 --> 00:59:03,649
You know, Carl...

691
00:59:03,984 --> 00:59:09,371
these people who pass through here,
they all tell pretty good stories

692
00:59:12,109 --> 00:59:14,778
A surveyor making a map...

693
00:59:15,595 --> 00:59:19,157
A botanist cataloguing plants...

694
00:59:21,142 --> 00:59:26,957
An old man taking his
house to Paradise Falls.

695
00:59:33,879 --> 00:59:38,093
That's the best one yet. I can't
wait to hear how it ends.

696
00:59:46,901 --> 00:59:50,647
Well, it's been a wonderful
evening, but we'd better be going.

697
00:59:50,682 --> 00:59:52,656
You're not leaving.

698
00:59:52,691 --> 00:59:56,153
We don't want to take
advantage of your hospitality.

699
00:59:56,188 --> 00:59:57,411
Come on, Russell.

700
00:59:57,446 --> 00:59:59,448
But we haven't even
had dessert yet.

701
00:59:59,483 --> 01:00:00,917
Oh, the boy is right.

702
01:00:01,259 --> 01:00:03,150
You haven't had dessert.

703
01:00:03,285 --> 01:00:07,330
Epsilon here makes a
delicious cherries jubilee.

704
01:00:08,707 --> 01:00:11,605
You really must stay! I insist!

705
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,504
We have so much
more to talk about!

706
01:00:18,884 --> 01:00:20,135
Kevin?

707
01:00:27,717 --> 01:00:28,970
It's near.

708
01:00:30,562 --> 01:00:32,731
Get them!

709
01:00:34,399 --> 01:00:36,839
- Hurry!
- Kevin!

710
01:00:36,874 --> 01:00:39,279
Dogs! Hurry!

711
01:00:41,613 --> 01:00:44,366
Master! Over here!

712
01:00:59,216 --> 01:01:02,135
Go on, master!

713
01:01:24,923 --> 01:01:25,951
Left!

714
01:01:31,081 --> 01:01:32,207
Russell!

715
01:01:37,587 --> 01:01:38,630
Get back!

716
01:01:41,967 --> 01:01:45,262
Go on, master! I will stop the dogs!

717
01:01:46,221 --> 01:01:48,181
Stop, you, dogs!

718
01:02:15,792 --> 01:02:19,004
Help!

719
01:02:26,052 --> 01:02:28,388
Give me your hand!

720
01:02:39,065 --> 01:02:43,737
Hang on to Kevin!

721
01:03:12,307 --> 01:03:16,019
Kevin!

722
01:03:37,582 --> 01:03:39,876
No, no, no. Kevin...

723
01:03:40,001 --> 01:03:41,718
Stay down.

724
01:03:41,753 --> 01:03:44,380
She's hurt real bad.

725
01:03:44,422 --> 01:03:46,883
Can't we help her get home?

726
01:03:57,352 --> 01:04:01,064
All right. But we gotta hurry.

727
01:04:06,569 --> 01:04:09,204
- You lost them?
- No, it was Dug.

728
01:04:09,239 --> 01:04:14,828
Yeah, he's with them.
he helped them escape!

729
01:04:14,863 --> 01:04:17,747
Wait. Wait a minute.

730
01:04:17,789 --> 01:04:18,915
Dug.

731
01:04:24,879 --> 01:04:28,132
- See anything?
- No, my pack is not following us.

732
01:04:28,167 --> 01:04:29,843
Boy, they are dumb!

733
01:04:29,878 --> 01:04:32,769
This is crazy.

734
01:04:32,804 --> 01:04:35,473
I finally meet my childhood
hero and he's trying to kill us.

735
01:04:35,508 --> 01:04:36,933
- What a joke.
- Hey, I know a joke!

736
01:04:37,141 --> 01:04:38,817
A squirrel walks up
up to a tree and says:

737
01:04:38,852 --> 01:04:42,480
"I forgot to store acorns
for winter and now I am dead".

738
01:04:42,856 --> 01:04:45,316
It is funny because
the squirrel gets dead.

739
01:04:46,359 --> 01:04:48,966
Careful, Russell.

740
01:04:49,001 --> 01:04:51,573
You ok, Kevin?

741
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:58,837
You know what,
Mr. Fredricksen?

742
01:04:58,872 --> 01:05:02,041
The wilderness isn't
quite what I expected.

743
01:05:02,076 --> 01:05:04,002
Yeah? How so?

744
01:05:04,168 --> 01:05:06,553
It's kind of... wild.

745
01:05:06,588 --> 01:05:09,799
I mean, it's not how they
made it sound in my book.

746
01:05:09,834 --> 01:05:12,100
Get used to that, kid.

747
01:05:12,135 --> 01:05:14,366
My dad made it sound so easy.

748
01:05:14,401 --> 01:05:16,563
He is really good at camping,

749
01:05:16,598 --> 01:05:19,726
and how to make fire
from rocks and stuff...

750
01:05:19,761 --> 01:05:23,184
He used to come to all
my squad lodge meetings.

751
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:26,435
And afterwards, we go
get ice-cream that fattens.

752
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:29,652
I always get chocolate
and he gets butter brickle.

753
01:05:29,687 --> 01:05:32,662
Then we sit on this
one curve, right outside

754
01:05:32,697 --> 01:05:36,409
and I'll count all the blue cars
and he counts all the red ones

755
01:05:36,444 --> 01:05:42,332
and whoever gets
the most wins.

756
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:46,940
I like that curve.

757
01:05:46,975 --> 01:05:50,430
It might sound boring,

758
01:05:50,465 --> 01:05:54,469
but I think the boring stuff is
the stuff I remember the most.

759
01:06:02,185 --> 01:06:05,813
Look, there it is!

760
01:06:06,272 --> 01:06:09,359
Hold on, Russell, stand still.

761
01:06:18,868 --> 01:06:22,538
Look at that bird go! Wait
up, you overgrown chicken!

762
01:06:23,998 --> 01:06:26,959
That's it! Go, Kevin!
Go find your babies!

763
01:06:31,798 --> 01:06:34,926
Run, Kevin, run!

764
01:06:35,593 --> 01:06:37,845
Oh, no!

765
01:06:41,974 --> 01:06:45,728
Russell, dã-mi cuþitul tãu!

766
01:06:46,187 --> 01:06:49,148
Get away from my bird!

767
01:07:14,423 --> 01:07:16,509
No!

768
01:07:22,515 --> 01:07:24,851
No!

769
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:34,110
Careful, I want it in good
shape for my retirement.

770
01:07:35,403 --> 01:07:37,572
Let it go!

771
01:07:37,613 --> 01:07:39,490
Stop!

772
01:07:42,827 --> 01:07:45,371
Kevin!

773
01:07:57,884 --> 01:08:01,345
You gave away Kevin.

774
01:08:01,387 --> 01:08:05,683
You just... gave her away.

775
01:08:05,725 --> 01:08:09,312
This is none of my concern.

776
01:08:09,347 --> 01:08:12,899
I didn't ask for any of these!

777
01:08:15,526 --> 01:08:18,299
Master, it's all right.

778
01:08:18,334 --> 01:08:21,038
I am not your master!

779
01:08:21,073 --> 01:08:24,368
If you hadn't shown up, none
of these would have happened.

780
01:08:24,403 --> 01:08:27,121
Bad dog, bad dog!

781
01:08:35,379 --> 01:08:37,805
Whether you assist me or not,

782
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:41,427
I am going to Paradise
Falls, if it kills me!

783
01:09:53,958 --> 01:09:55,918
Here

784
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,212
I don't want this anymore.

785
01:13:38,015 --> 01:13:39,026
Russell?

786
01:13:42,269 --> 01:13:46,690
- Russell!
- I'm gonna help Kevin

787
01:13:46,725 --> 01:13:49,585
even if you won't!

788
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:52,446
No, Russell, no!

789
01:15:04,768 --> 01:15:06,019
Russell?

790
01:15:09,523 --> 01:15:12,484
I was hiding under your
porch because I love you.

791
01:15:12,519 --> 01:15:14,117
Can I stay?

792
01:15:14,152 --> 01:15:16,405
Can you stay? Well,
you're my dog, aren't you?

793
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,007
And I'm your master.

794
01:15:18,042 --> 01:15:19,539
You're my master?

795
01:15:19,574 --> 01:15:22,327
- Oh, boy!
- Good boy, Dug!

796
01:15:22,362 --> 01:15:24,329
You're a good boy!

797
01:15:50,021 --> 01:15:51,064
Yes!

798
01:15:52,941 --> 01:15:55,110
Don't worry, Kevin,
I'll save you.

799
01:16:03,952 --> 01:16:06,002
And they wouldn't believe me.

800
01:16:06,037 --> 01:16:08,957
Just wait till they
get a look at you!

801
01:16:08,992 --> 01:16:09,840
Master.

802
01:16:09,875 --> 01:16:12,961
The small mailman
has returned.

803
01:16:12,996 --> 01:16:14,838
What?

804
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,590
Let me go!

805
01:16:16,631 --> 01:16:19,426
Where is your elderly friend?

806
01:16:19,509 --> 01:16:23,520
He's not my friend anymore.

807
01:16:23,555 --> 01:16:27,309
If you're here, Fredricksen
can't be far behind.

808
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:30,687
Where are you keeping Kevin?

809
01:16:30,812 --> 01:16:33,280
Let me go!

810
01:16:33,315 --> 01:16:35,532
Scream all you
want, small mailman.

811
01:16:35,567 --> 01:16:37,868
None of your mailmen
friends can hear you.

812
01:16:37,903 --> 01:16:43,909
I will unleash all my
wilderness explorer training!

813
01:16:44,826 --> 01:16:47,579
Alfa, Fredricksen
is coming back!

814
01:16:47,614 --> 01:16:49,921
Guard that bird.

815
01:16:49,956 --> 01:16:52,167
If you see the old man,
you know what to do.

816
01:16:52,209 --> 01:16:54,377
Where are you going? I'm
not finished with you!

817
01:16:54,412 --> 01:16:56,004
Nice talking with you.

818
01:17:01,635 --> 01:17:04,804
Where are you, Fredricksen?

819
01:17:18,944 --> 01:17:21,342
Help!

820
01:17:21,377 --> 01:17:23,740
Russell!

821
01:17:36,294 --> 01:17:40,006
- Dle Fredricksen!
- Dug, bring her over!

822
01:17:40,090 --> 01:17:43,259
You came back for
Kevin! Let's go get her!

823
01:17:43,294 --> 01:17:45,477
I'm getting Kevin.
You stay here.

824
01:17:45,512 --> 01:17:49,015
- But I wanna help!
- I don't want your help.

825
01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:51,935
I want you safe.

826
01:17:57,273 --> 01:17:59,067
How do we get pass these dogs?

827
01:17:59,102 --> 01:18:01,444
Point!

828
01:18:11,663 --> 01:18:12,706
Kevin!

829
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,132
Don't worry, Kevin.
We are on our way.

830
01:18:16,167 --> 01:18:19,713
No one should be entering
through these doors.

831
01:18:19,748 --> 01:18:23,133
Guard well that
bird, my minions.

832
01:18:23,168 --> 01:18:26,553
What do we do now, Dug?

833
01:18:37,063 --> 01:18:40,567
Who wants the ball?

834
01:18:40,602 --> 01:18:42,736
Me, me, me!

835
01:18:45,947 --> 01:18:47,699
Go get it!

836
01:18:49,868 --> 01:18:54,289
I got it!

837
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:00,920
I'm sorry, Kevin. Let's
get you out of here.

838
01:19:01,671 --> 01:19:03,381
- Master, he's gone.
- What's going on?

839
01:19:04,132 --> 01:19:05,884
- He's got the bird!
- He ran off!

840
01:19:05,919 --> 01:19:07,844
Calm down! One at the time!

841
01:19:11,806 --> 01:19:14,934
I want to... help!

842
01:19:28,406 --> 01:19:32,038
Does anybody know
where they are?

843
01:19:47,564 --> 01:19:49,753
Raid leaders! Bring
down that house!

844
01:19:53,806 --> 01:19:57,233
Raid leader! Checking in!

845
01:19:57,268 --> 01:20:01,981
- Raid 2, checking in.
- Raid 3, checking in.

846
01:20:04,523 --> 01:20:05,801
Target sighted.

847
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:15,036
Come on, Kevin.

848
01:20:31,274 --> 01:20:32,161
Hi.

849
01:20:58,594 --> 01:21:00,364
Any last words, Fredricksen?

850
01:21:00,499 --> 01:21:02,250
Come on, spit it out!

851
01:21:06,946 --> 01:21:07,303
Enough!

852
01:21:07,338 --> 01:21:10,883
You cannot leave
this place... alive!

853
01:21:10,918 --> 01:21:14,470
You're dead!

854
01:21:39,402 --> 01:21:41,205
Come on, Kevin.

855
01:21:59,223 --> 01:22:02,518
I'll have plenty of enjoyment
for what I'm about to do to you.

856
01:22:08,733 --> 01:22:12,195
He wears the cone of shame!

857
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:16,407
Not just continue
sitting! Attack!

858
01:22:19,368 --> 01:22:22,413
No! No! Stop your laughing!

859
01:22:22,448 --> 01:22:25,625
Listen, you, dog, sit!

860
01:22:25,666 --> 01:22:28,426
Yes, Alfa.

861
01:22:28,461 --> 01:22:32,673
Alfa? I am not
Alfa, he is... Oh!

862
01:22:32,715 --> 01:22:35,635
I can't do it.

863
01:22:37,553 --> 01:22:41,766
Russell...

864
01:22:42,975 --> 01:22:45,394
You leave Mr.
Fredricksen alone!

865
01:23:02,411 --> 01:23:05,373
- Hey! Squirrel!
- Squirrel? Where?

866
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:14,242
I hate squirrels!

867
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:36,404
- Dug!
- Master!

868
01:23:38,412 --> 01:23:39,782
Russell, over here!

869
01:23:40,717 --> 01:23:42,160
Let's go!

870
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:47,529
Mr. Fredricksen!

871
01:23:49,264 --> 01:23:50,328
Come on, Kevin.

872
01:24:06,715 --> 01:24:08,269
No!

873
01:24:20,931 --> 01:24:23,250
Russell, get out of there!

874
01:24:25,995 --> 01:24:28,706
Leave them alone!

875
01:24:42,511 --> 01:24:46,432
Russell, hang on to Kevin!
Don't let go! Grab on to him!

876
01:24:48,893 --> 01:24:52,063
Kevin! Chocolate!

877
01:25:13,574 --> 01:25:16,128
That was cool!

878
01:25:16,837 --> 01:25:20,216
Don't jerk around
so much, kid.

879
01:25:20,257 --> 01:25:22,718
Easy, Russell.

880
01:25:23,677 --> 01:25:26,055
Oh, I am ready
to not be up high.

881
01:25:49,411 --> 01:25:52,289
Sorry about your
house, Mr. Fredricksen.

882
01:25:53,999 --> 01:25:57,753
You know... It's just a house.

883
01:26:04,802 --> 01:26:07,930
Look at you! You're so soft!

884
01:26:11,183 --> 01:26:14,353
I wish I could keep one.

885
01:26:17,064 --> 01:26:20,109
Where is my cane?
I just had it here.

886
01:26:28,367 --> 01:26:31,579
You know what? Keep them. A
little gift from me to you.

887
01:26:31,614 --> 01:26:34,540
Bye, Kevin!

888
01:26:43,007 --> 01:26:46,176
- Ready?
- Ready.

889
01:26:57,438 --> 01:27:01,025
By receiving these badges,
the following explorers

890
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:04,111
will graduate to
Senior Explorers.

891
01:27:04,153 --> 01:27:06,488
For Extreme
Mountaineering Lore.

892
01:27:06,523 --> 01:27:07,788
Congratulations, Jimmy.

893
01:27:07,823 --> 01:27:10,909
For Wild Animal
Defensive Arts,

894
01:27:10,944 --> 01:27:13,471
Congratulations, Brendan.

895
01:27:13,506 --> 01:27:15,998
For Assisting the Elderly...

896
01:27:16,665 --> 01:27:19,918
Russell.
Is there someone...

897
01:27:22,129 --> 01:27:26,967
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Old man coming through.

898
01:27:27,009 --> 01:27:30,561
I'm here for him.

899
01:27:30,596 --> 01:27:34,391
Congratulations, Russell. Sir.

900
01:27:34,433 --> 01:27:38,152
Russell, for
assisting the elderly

901
01:27:38,187 --> 01:27:43,067
and for performing above
and beyond the call of duty,

902
01:27:43,150 --> 01:27:48,864
I would like to award you the
highest honor I can bestow.

903
01:27:48,947 --> 01:27:53,577
"The Ellie badge".

904
01:28:01,585 --> 01:28:05,798
I think that covers everybody.
so let's give a big explorer call

905
01:28:05,833 --> 01:28:09,176
to our brand new Senior
Wilderness Explorers!

906
01:28:09,211 --> 01:28:12,721
Ready everybody?

907
01:28:19,812 --> 01:28:23,211
- Blue one.
- Red one.

908
01:28:23,246 --> 01:28:25,510
- Blue one.
- Gray one.

909
01:28:25,711 --> 01:28:27,052
- Red one.
- That's a bike.

910
01:28:27,087 --> 01:28:31,583
- It's red, isn't it?
- Mr. Fredricksen, you're cheating!

911
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:35,179
- No, I'm not. Red one.
- That's a fire hydrant.

912
01:28:37,114 --> 01:28:40,495
Maybe I need a few lessons.

913
01:28:40,530 --> 01:28:43,877
