It's just that Indonesia doesn't have
the typical Spanish discos, you know?

But dancing? Yeah.

They definitely have those in Indonesia.
You can't say they don't, you know...

In all that time,
didn't you have any doubts?

Never.

I look beside me and see Stockholm,

This way I can stop you
from making a fool of yourself.

People who try to steal 2.4 billion euros

So stop saying that you can.

441

You get shot when you don't think.

442

When you go into a bank barefaced
and you do...

the first thing that comes to mind.

444
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:10,041

[whispers] I'm already free.

450

You're not going to leave,

455
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,983
because you have nothing
or no one waiting for you out there.

456
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:45,750
You don't do it, because your life ended
in your last robbery.

457
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,541
I'm offering you resurrection.

458

Although, if you want,

460
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,791
you can continue to obsess
over the memories of the first one.

What do you think you know about my life?

Or about what I've done to get freedom?

463
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,541
I'll learn the only thing
I need to know about you right now:

464
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,375
Whether you're brave enough

465
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:09,875
to be born again.

466
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,750
To live again. To find another love.
A family. It's a "yes" or a "no,"
