1
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,678
Been a while since I was up here
in front of you.

2
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,847
Maybe I'll do us all a favour
and just stick to the cards.

3
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,603
There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred

4
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,105
on the freeway and the rooftop...

5
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,233
Sorry, Mr Stark, do you
honestly expect us to believe that

6
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:28,903
that was a bodyguard
in a suit that conveniently appeared,

7
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,698
despite the fact
that you sorely despise bodyguards?

8
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:32,907
Yes.

9
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:37,662
And this mysterious bodyguard
was somehow equipped

10
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:41,165
with an undisclosed
Stark high-tech powered battle...

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,209
I know that it's confusing.

12
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,838
It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely

13
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:50,133
to make wild accusations,
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

14
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:56,431
I mean, let's face it,
I'm not the heroic type.

15
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,725
A laundry list of character defects,

16
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,644
all the mistakes I've made,
largely public.

17
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,354
The truth is

18
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,278
I am Iron Man.

19
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,248
Ivan.

20
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,977
Vanya.

21
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:08,224
270 at 30 knots.
Holding steady at 15,000 feet.

22
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,089
You are clear for exfiltration
over the drop zone.

23
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:10,137
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

24
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,556
It's good to be back.

25
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,227
- You missed me?
- Blow something up!

26
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:20,481
I missed you, too.
Blow something up? I already did that.

27
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,817
I'm not saying that the world is enjoying

28
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:28,072
its longest period of uninterrupted peace
in years because of me.

29
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:36,789
I'm not saying
that from the ashes of captivity,

30
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:41,919
never has a greater phoenix metaphor
been personified in human history.

31
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:50,928
I'm not saying that Uncle Sam
can kick back on a lawn chair,

32
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,638
sipping on an iced tea

33
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,766
because I haven't come across anyone
who's man enough

34
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,727
to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.

35
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,358
I love you, Tony!

36
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,569
Please, it's not about me.

37
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,738
It's not about you.

38
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,994
It's not even about us. It's about legacy.

39
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,831
It's about what we choose
to leave behind for future generations.

40
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:23,043
And that's why for the next year
and for the first time since 1974,

41
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,546
the best and brightest men and women

42
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,590
of nations and corporations
the world over

43
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:31,176
will pool their resources,
share their collective vision,

44
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,305
to leave behind a brighter future.

45
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,140
It's not about us.

46
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,185
Therefore, what I'm saying,
if I'm saying anything,

47
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,813
is welcome back to the Stark Expo.

48
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,236
And now,
making a special guest appearance

49
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,739
from the great beyond
to tell you what it's all about,

50
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,325
please welcome my father, Howard.

51
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,622
Everything is achievable
through technology.

52
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,999
Better living, robust health,

53
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,046
and for the first time in human history,
the possibility of world peace.

54
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,048
So, from all of us here
at Stark lndustries,

55
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:13,927
I would like to personally introduce you
to the City of the Future.

56
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:17,765
Technology holds infinite possibilities
for mankind,

57
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,684
and will one day rid
society of all its ills.

58
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,355
Soon, technology will affect the way
you live your life every day.

59
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,023
No more tedious work,

60
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:30,736
leaving more time for leisure activities
and enjoying the sweet life.

61
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,572
The Stark Expo. Welcome.

62
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,664
We are coming to you live
from the kickoff of the Stark Expo,

63
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,625
where Tony Stark
has just walked offstage.

64
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,293
Don't worry
if you can't make it down here tonight

65
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,796
because this Expo goes on
all year long.

66
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,881
And I'm gonna be here
checking out all the attractions

67
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,510
and the pavilions and the inventions
from all around the world.

68
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,458
Make sure you join me...

69
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,054
All right, it's a zoo
out there, watch out.

70
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,973
- Open up, let's go.
- Hey! Nice to see you.

71
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,601
- All right. Thank you. I remember you.
- Tony, Tony...

72
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,228
Hey, hey...

73
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,772
- Call me.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.

74
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,316
Hello. It would be a pleasure.

75
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,901
- Okay.
- See you, buddy.

76
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,069
This is Larry.

77
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,238
Hey, the oracle of Oracle.
What a pleasure.

78
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,823
- Nice to see you.
- Call me. Call me.

79
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,700
- Larry King.
- Larry!

80
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,536
Yes, my people, my people.

81
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,162
Come on, Tony. There we go.

82
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,123
- Very mellow.
- That wasn't so bad.

83
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,499
No, it was perfect.

84
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,084
Look what we got here, the new model.

85
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,877
- Hey, does she come with the car?
- I certainly hope so.

86
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,045
- Hi.
- Hi.

87
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,296
- And you are?
- Marshal.

88
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,298
- Irish. I like it.
- Pleased to meet you, Tony.

89
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,551
I'm on the wheel. Do you mind?
Where you from?

90
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:36,885
- Bedford.
- What are you doing here?

91
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,722
- Looking for you.
- Yeah? You found me.

92
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,268
- What are you up to later?
- Serving subpoenas.

93
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,896
He doesn't like to be handed things.

94
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,565
- Yeah, I have a peeve.
- I got it.

95
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:50,774
You are hereby ordered

96
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,110
to appear before
the Senate Armed Services Committee

97
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,862
tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.

98
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,530
- Can I see a badge?
- You wanna see the badge?

99
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,907
He likes the badge.

100
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,076
- You still like it?
- Yep.

101
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,582
- How far are we from D.C.?
- D.C.? 250 miles.

102
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:15,215
Mr Stark, could we pick up now
where we left off? Mr Stark. Please.

103
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,900
- Yes, dear?
- Can I have your attention?

104
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,051
Absolutely.

105
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,096
Do you or do you not possess
a specialised weapon?

106
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,474
- I do not. I do not.
- You do not?

107
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,059
Well, it depends
on how you define the word "weapon."

108
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,812
- The Iron Man weapon.
- My device does not fit that description.

109
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,606
Well... How would you describe it?

110
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,734
I would describe it by defining it
as what it is, Senator.

111
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:37,613
- As?
- It's a high-tech prosthesis.

112
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:38,739
That is... That is...

113
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,116
That's actually the most apt description
Ican make of it.

114
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,076
It's a weapon. It's a weapon, Mr Stark.

115
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,281
Please, if your priority was actually
the well-being of the American citizen...

116
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,208
My priority is to get the Iron Man
weapon turned over to the people

117
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,669
- of the United States of America.
- Well, you can forget it.

118
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:57,007
I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one.

119
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,551
To turn over the Iron Man suit
would be to turn over myself,

120
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,638
which is tantamount
to indentured servitude or prostitution,

121
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,389
depending on what state you're in.

122
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,434
- You can't have it.
- Look, I'm no expert...

123
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,313
ln prostitution? Of course not.
You're a senator. Come on.

124
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,733
I'm no expert in weapons.

125
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,652
We have somebody here
who is an expert on weapons.

126
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:21,490
I'd now like to call Justin Hammer,
our current primary weapons contractor.

127
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,994
Let the record reflect that I observed
Mr Hammer entering the chamber,

128
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,412
and I am wondering

129
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:31,291
if and when any actual expert
will also be in attendance.

130
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:39,508
Absolutely. I'm no expert.
I defer to you, Anthony.

131
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,593
You're the wonder boy.

132
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,804
Senator, if I may.

133
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:48,350
I may well not be an expert,
but you know who was the expert?

134
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,061
Your dad. Howard Stark.

135
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:55,566
Really a father to us all,
and to the military-industrial age.

136
00:12:56,192 --> 00:13:00,696
Let's just be clear.
He was no flower child. He was a lion.

137
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,198
We all know why we're here.
In the last six months,

138
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:07,411
Anthony Stark has created a sword
with untold possibilities.

139
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,330
And yet he insists it's a shield.

140
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:15,043
He asks us to trust him
as we cower behind it.

141
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,380
I wish I were comforted, Anthony,
I really do.

142
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,592
I'd love to leave my door unlocked
when I leave the house,

143
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,135
but this ain't Canada.

144
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,887
You know, we live in a world
of grave threats,

145
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:28,724
threats that Mr Stark
will not always be able to foresee.

146
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,226
Thank you.

147
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,062
God bless Iron Man. God bless America.

148
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,274
That is well said, Mr Hammer.

149
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,318
The committee would now like to invite

150
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:42,529
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes
to the chamber.

151
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,114
Rhodey? What?

152
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,707
Hey, buddy.
I didn't expect to see you here.

153
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,418
Look, it's me, I'm here.
Deal with it. Let's move on.

154
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,586
I just...

155
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,152
- Drop it.
- All right, I'll drop it.

156
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,674
I have before me a complete report
on the Iron Man weapon,

157
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,427
compiled by Colonel Rhodes.
And, Colonel, for the record,

158
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,639
can you please read page 57,
paragraph four?

159
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,016
You're requesting
that I read specific selections

160
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,392
- from my report, Senator?
- Yes, sir.

161
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,394
It was my understanding
that I was going to be testifying

162
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,647
in a much more comprehensive
and detailed manner.

163
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,357
I understand.
A lot of things have changed today.

164
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:19,733
- So if you could just read...
- You do understand

165
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,297
that reading a single paragraph
out of context does not reflect

166
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,614
- the summary of my final...
- Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.

167
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,075
Very well.

168
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,288
"As he does not operate within
any definable branch of government,"

169
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:39,378
"Iron Man presents a potential threat
to the security of both the nation"

170
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,879
"and to her interests."

171
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,839
I did, however, go on to summarise

172
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,634
that the benefits of Iron Man
far outweigh the liabilities.

173
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,886
- And that it would be in our interest...
- That's enough, Colonel.

174
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:49,137
- To fold Mr Stark...
- That's enough.

175
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,764
Into the existing
chain of command, Senator.

176
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,226
I'm not a joiner, but I'll consider
Secretary of Defense, if you ask nice.

177
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,979
We can amend the hours a little bit.

178
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,398
I'd like to go on and show, if I may,

179
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,650
the imagery
that's connected to your report.

180
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:04,611
I believe it is somewhat premature
to reveal these images

181
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,488
- to the general public at this time.
- With all due respect,

182
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,781
Colonel, I understand.

183
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,952
And if you could just narrate those
for us, we'd be very grateful.

184
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,996
Let's have the images.

185
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,667
Intelligence suggests
that the devices seen in these photos

186
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,628
are, in fact, attempts
at making manned copies

187
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,171
of Mr Stark's suit.

188
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:28,301
This has been corroborated by our allies
and local intelligence on the ground,

189
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:33,515
indicating that these suits are quite
possibly, at this moment, operational.

190
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,602
Hold on one second, buddy.
Let me see something here.

191
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,189
Boy, I'm good.
I commandeered your screens.

192
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,693
I need them.
Time for a little transparency.

193
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,695
- Now, let's see what's really going on.
- What is he doing?

194
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,032
If you will direct your attention
to said screens...

195
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,700
I believe that's North Korea.

196
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,794
Can you turn that off? Take it off.

197
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,046
Iran.

198
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,553
No grave immediate threat here.
Is that Justin Hammer?

199
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,097
How did Hammer get in the game?

200
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,808
Justin, you're on TV. Focus up.

201
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,396
Okay, give me a left twist.
Left's good. Turn to the right.

202
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:26,526
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

203
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:27,778
Wow.

204
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:32,532
Yeah, I'd say most countries,
five, 10 years away.

205
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:33,909
Hammer Industries, 20.

206
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,620
I'd like to point out
that that test pilot survived.

207
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,246
I think we're done,
is the point that he's making.

208
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,541
- I don't think there's any reason...
- The point is, you're welcome, I guess.

209
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,461
- For what?
- Because I'm your nuclear deterrent.

210
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,088
It's working.
We're safe. America is secure.

211
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,090
You want my property?
You can't have it.

212
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,592
But I did you a big favour.

213
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,262
I've successfully privatized world peace.

214
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,643
What more do you want? For now!

215
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,313
I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.

216
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,775
You, Mr Stark... you, buddy.

217
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,985
We're adjourned.
We're adjourned for today.

218
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,363
- Okay.
- You've been a delight.

219
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,454
My bond is with the people.

220
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:24,793
And I will serve this great nation
at the pleasure of myself.

221
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,461
If there's one thing I've proven

222
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,881
it's that you can count on me
to pleasure myself.

223
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,085
Wake up. Daddy's home.

224
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,753
Welcome home, sir.

225
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,714
Congratulations on
the opening ceremonies.

226
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,842
They were such a success,
as was your Senate hearing.

227
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,677
And may I say how refreshing it is

228
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,514
to finally see you in a video
with your clothing on, sir.

229
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,559
You!

230
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,353
I swear to God I'll dismantle you.
I'll soak your motherboard.

231
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,023
I'll turn you into a wine rack.

232
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,775
How many ounces a day
of this gobbledegook

233
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,943
am I supposed to drink?

234
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:36,031
We are up to 80 ounces a day
to counteract the symptoms, sir.

235
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,950
Check palladium levels.

236
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,204
Blood toxicity, 24%.

237
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,042
It appears that the continued use
of the Iron Man suit

238
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,544
is accelerating your condition.

239
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,423
Another core has been depleted.

240
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,470
God, they're running out quick.

241
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,222
I have run simulations
on every known element,

242
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,350
and none can serve
as a viable replacement

243
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,435
for the palladium core.

244
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,732
You are running out of both time
and options.

245
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:17,155
Unfortunately, the device
that's keeping you alive

246
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,074
is also killing you.

247
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,993
Miss Potts is approaching.

248
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,996
- I recommend that you inform her...
- Mute.

249
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,668
Is this a joke?

250
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,754
- What are you thinking?
- What?

251
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,131
- What are you thinking?
- Hey, I'm thinking I'm busy.

252
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,550
And you're angry about something.

253
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,010
Do you have the sniffles?
I don't wanna get sick.

254
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,512
- Did you just donate...
- Keep your business.

255
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:44,140
Our entire modern art collection
to the...

256
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,850
- Boy Scouts ofAmerica.
- Boy Scouts ofAmerica?

257
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,727
Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation.

258
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:51,189
I didn't physically check the crates
but, basically, yes.

259
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,441
And it's not "our" collection,
it's my collection. No offence.

260
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,568
No, you know what?
I think I'm actually entitled

261
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,237
to say "our" collection

262
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,532
considering the time that I put in,
over 10 years,

263
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,450
- curating that.
- It was a tax write-off. I needed that.

264
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,620
You know,
there's only about 8,011things

265
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,664
that I really need to talk to you about.

266
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,207
Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out.

267
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,750
The Bridgeport's
already machining that part.

268
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,211
The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.

269
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,547
I need you to wear a surgical mask
until you're feeling better.

270
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,791
- Is that okay?
- That's rude.

271
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,258
There's nothing more important to me
than the Expo.

272
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,676
It's my primary point of concern.

273
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,929
- I don't know why you're...
- The Expo is your ego gone crazy.

274
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,806
Wow. Look at that.

275
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,393
That's modern art. That's going up.

276
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,229
- You've got to be kidding.
- I'm gonna put this up right now.

277
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,523
- This is vital.
- Stark is in complete disarray.

278
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,007
- You understand that?
- No. Our stocks have never been higher.

279
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:38,361
- Yes, from a managerial standpoint.
- You are... Well, if it's messy,

280
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:39,946
- then let's double back.
- Let me give you an example.

281
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:41,614
- Let's move on to another subject.
- No, no, no, no.

282
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,408
You are not taking down
the Barnett Newman

283
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,993
- and hanging that up!
- I'm not taking it down.

284
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,357
I'm just replacing it with this.

285
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,787
- Let's see what I can get going here.
- Okay, fine.

286
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,999
My point is,
we have already awarded contracts

287
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,751
- to the wind farm people.
- Yeah. Don't say "wind farm."

288
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,919
- I'm already feeling gassy.
- And to the plastic plantation tree,

289
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,130
which was your idea, by the way.
Those people are on payroll...

290
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,007
- Everything was my idea.
- And you won't make a decision.

291
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,800
I don't care
about the liberal agenda any more.

292
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,261
It's boring. Boring.
I'm giving you a boring alert.

293
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,638
- You do it.
- I do what?

294
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,682
Excellent idea. I just figured this out.
You run the company.

295
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,560
- Yeah, I'm trying to run the company.
- Pepper, I need you to run the company.

296
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,062
- Well, stop trying to do it and do it.
- You will not

297
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,813
- give me the information...
- I'm not asking you to try...

298
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,023
- in order to...
- I'm asking you

299
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,316
to physically do it. I need you to do it.

300
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,151
- I am trying to do it.
- Pepper, you're not listening to me!

301
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,153
- No, you are not listening to me.
- I'm trying to make you CEO.

302
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,113
Why won't you let me?

303
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,658
- Have you been drinking?
- Chlorophyll.

304
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:31,831
I hereby irrevocably appoint you
chairman and CEO of Stark Industries,

305
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,833
effective immediately.

306
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,921
Yeah, done deal. Okay?

307
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,966
I've actually given this
a fair amount of thought,

308
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:45,970
believe it or not.
Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak,

309
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:49,933
trying to figure out
who a worthy successor would be.

310
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,810
And then I realised

311
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,898
it's you. It's always been you.

312
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,026
I thought there'd be a legal issue,

313
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,571
but actually I'm capable
of appointing my successor.

314
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,282
My successor being you.

315
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,120
Congratulations?

316
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,456
- Take it, just take it.
- I don't know what to think.

317
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,333
Don't think. Drink.

318
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,507
There you go.

319
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:05,508
The notary's here! Can you please
come sign the transfer paperwork?

320
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,802
I'm on happy time.

321
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,338
- Sorry.
- What the hell was that?

322
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,770
It's called mixed martial arts.
It's been around for three weeks.

323
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,015
It's called dirty boxing.
There's nothing new about it.

324
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,483
All right, put them up. Come on.

325
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:30,033
I promise you this is the only time
I will ask you to sign over your company.

326
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,620
I need you to initial each box.

327
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:36,956
Lesson one. Never take your eye off...

328
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,460
That's it. I'm done.

329
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,962
- What's your name, lady?
- Rushman. Natalie Rushman.

330
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:44,631
Front and centre. Come into the church.

331
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:48,509
- No. You're seriously not gonna ask...
- If it pleases the court, which it does.

332
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,930
- It's no problem.
- I'm sorry. He's very eccentric.

333
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:06,653
What?

334
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,201
- Can you give her a lesson?
- No problem.

335
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,286
- Pepper.
- What?

336
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,790
- Who is she?
- She is from legal.

337
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,961
And she is potentially a very expensive
sexual harassment lawsuit

338
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,213
- if you keep ogling her like that.
- I need a new assistant, boss.

339
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,091
Yes, and I've got
three excellent potential candidates.

340
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,777
They're lined up and ready to meet you.

341
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,679
I don't have time to meet.
I need someone now. I feel like it's her.

342
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:33,846
No, it's not.

343
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:35,723
- You ever boxed before?
- I have, yes.

344
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:39,769
What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot
Camp? Crunch? Something like that?

345
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:43,606
- How do I spell your name, Natalie?
- R-U-S-H-M-A-N.

346
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:48,111
- What, are you gonna google her now?
- I thought I was ogling her.

347
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:51,864
- Wow. Very, very impressive individual.
- You're so predictable, you know that?

348
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:54,117
She's fluent in French, Italian,
Russian, Latin.

349
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,077
- Who speaks Latin?
- No one speaks Latin.

350
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,454
- No one speaks Latin?
- It's a dead language.

351
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,331
You can read Latin
or you can write Latin,

352
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,000
- but you can't speak Latin...
- Did you model in Tokyo?

353
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,835
- 'Cause she modeled in Tokyo.
- Well...

354
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,295
I need her.
She's got everything that I need.

355
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:09,007
Rule number one,
never take your eye off your opponent.

356
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,634
Oh, my God!

357
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,639
- Happy!
- That's what I'm talking about.

358
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,057
- I just slipped.
- You did?

359
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,476
- Yeah.
- Looks like a TKO to me.

360
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:25,023
Just... I need your impression.

361
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,817
You have a quiet reserve.
I don't know, you have an old soul.

362
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,403
- I meant your fingerprint.
- Right.

363
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,784
- So, how are we doing?
- Great. Just wrapping up. Hey.

364
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:41,247
- You're the boss.
- Will that be all, Mr Stark?

365
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,291
- No.
- Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman.

366
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,209
Thank you very much.

367
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,881
- I want one.
- No.

368
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:26,167
You know, it's Europe.
Whatever happens the next 20 minutes,

369
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,502
- just go with it.
- Go with it? Go with what?

370
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,128
- Mr Stark?
- Hey.

371
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,421
Hello. How was your flight?

372
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,006
It was excellent.
Boy, it's nice to see you.

373
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:36,260
We have one photographer
from the ACM, if you don't mind. Okay?

374
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,429
- When did this happen?
- What? You made me do it.

375
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:41,057
- I made you do what?
- You quit. Smile. Look right there.

376
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,266
Stop acting constipated.

377
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:43,810
- Don't flare your nostrils.
- You are so predictable.

378
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:44,936
- That's the amazing thing.
- Right this way.

379
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,729
- You look fantastic.
- Why, thank you very much.

380
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,694
But that's unprofessional.
What's on the docket?

381
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,650
You have a 9:30 dinner.

382
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,534
- Perfect. I'll be there at 11:00.
- Absolutely.

383
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,404
- Is this us?
- It can be.

384
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,155
- Great. Make it us.
- Okay.

385
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,699
- Mr Musk. How are you?
- Hi, Pepper.

386
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,660
- Congratulations on the promotion.
- Thank you very much.

387
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,995
Elon, how's it going?
Those Merlin engines are fantastic.

388
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,081
Thank you. Yeah, I've got an idea
for an electric jet.

389
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,249
- You do?
- Yeah.

390
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,376
Then we'll make it work.

391
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,211
- You want a massage?
- Oh, God. No,

392
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,754
- I don't want a massage.
- I'll have Natalie make an...

393
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,256
- I don't want Natalie to do...
- Don't want you tense.

394
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,507
By the way, I didn't mean
to spring this on you.

395
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,716
Thank you very much.

396
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,760
- Green is not your best colour.
- Oh, please.

397
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,387
Anthony! Is that you?

398
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,763
- My least favourite person on Earth.
- Hey, pal.

399
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,140
- Justin Hammer.
- How you doing?

400
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,017
You're not the only rich guy here
with a fancy car.

401
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:27,520
You know Christine Everhart
from Vanity Fair.

402
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,804
- You guys know each other?
- Hi.

403
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,064
- Yes.
- Yes.

404
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,315
- Yes, roughly.
- We do.

405
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,445
BTW, big story.
The new CEO of Stark Industries.

406
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:36,849
- I know. I know.
- Congratulations.

407
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:40,366
My editor will kill me if I don't grab
a quote for our Powerful Women issue.

408
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:41,617
- Can I?
- Sure.

409
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:44,203
She's actually doing a big spread on me
for Vanity Fair.

410
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,205
I thought I'd throw her a bone, you know.

411
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,373
- Right.
- Right?

412
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:50,835
Well, she did quite a spread
on Tony last year.

413
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,253
And she wrote a story as well.

414
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,380
- It was very impressive.
- That was good.

415
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,507
- Very well done.
- Thank you.

416
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,072
- I'm gonna go wash.
- Don't leave me.

417
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,594
- Hey, buddy. How you doing?
- I'm all right.

418
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,970
- Looking gorgeous.
- Please, this is tough.

419
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,012
Can I ask you... Is
this the first time...

420
00:28:03,024 --> 00:28:03,681
Fromage.

421
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,266
- Say, "Brie."
- that you guys have seen each other?

422
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,602
God, that's so awful.

423
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,062
Listen, is it the first time you've seen
each other since the Senate?

424
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,814
Since he got his contract revoked...

425
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,180
- Actually, it's on hold.
- When you were attempting to...

426
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,194
That's not what I heard.
What's the difference between "hold"

427
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,112
- and "cancelled"? The truth?
- Yes, what is?

428
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,573
No. The truth is...
Why don't we put that away?

429
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:24,660
The truth is, I'm actually hoping
to present something at your Expo.

430
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:27,121
Well, if you invent something
that works,

431
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,623
I'll make sure I get you a slot.

432
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,917
- Mr Stark, your corner table is ready.
- Yes?

433
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,211
I actually have a slot this year.
Yes, I do.

434
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:36,464
- Hammer needs a slot, Christine.
- We kid, yeah.

435
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,508
We kid. We're kidders.

436
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,907
Got any other bad ideas?

437
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,287
Tony!

438
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:16,420
Tony and I... Tony... I love Tony Stark.
Tony loves me. We're not competitors.

439
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,965
Him being out of the picture
created tremendous opportunities

440
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,551
for Hammer Industries, you know?

441
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:24,971
- Everything that Tony and I do...
- Well, what's the use of having...

442
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,932
- is a healthy...
- and owning a race car...

443
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,977
- competition.
- If you don't drive it?

444
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,563
Is he driving?

445
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,530
Natalie. Natalie!

446
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,657
- Yes, Miss Potts?
- Did you know about this?

447
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,951
This is the first that I have known of it.

448
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,786
This... This cannot happen.

449
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,538
Absolutely. I understand.
How can I help you?

450
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,872
- Where's Happy?
- He's waiting outside.

451
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,833
- Okay, get him. I need Happy.
- Right away.

452
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:56,711
Tony's... You know, he...

453
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,671
We're not competitive.
You know what I mean?

454
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,839
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,

455
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,883
- can you excuse me just one second?
- Just read me what you wrote.

456
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,176
- I will. I will, after.
- Just read it back to me.

457
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:05,511
But I have to make one quick phone call.

458
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:06,679
- Where are you going?
- This is great.

459
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,139
- I've got some caviar coming.
- This is great stuff.

460
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,724
- I'll be right back.
- Look!

461
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,309
That's Stark.

462
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,553
Go, go!

463
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,433
Hang on.

464
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,212
- Give me the case.
- Here. Take it.

465
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:27,880
- Where's the key?
- It's in my pocket.

466
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,131
Car!

467
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,196
Oh, my God!

468
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,330
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

469
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,333
- Were you heading for me or him?
- I was trying to scare him.

470
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,419
- 'Cause I can't tell!
- Are you out of your mind?

471
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,462
- Better security.
- Get in the car right now!

472
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,298
I was attacked! We need better security.

473
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,633
- Get in the car!
- You're CEO. Better security measures.

474
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,468
God, it's embarrassing.

475
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:59,555
First vacation in two years.

476
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,644
Oh, my God!

477
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,981
- I got him!
- Hit him again. Hit him again.

478
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,941
Football.

479
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,446
- I got him!
- Take the case! Take it!

480
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,197
- Take the case!
- Give him the case!

481
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,116
Stop banging the car!

482
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,621
Calm down.

483
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,540
God! God!

484
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,792
Give me the case! Please! Come on!

485
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,931
You... You lose.

486
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:14,898
You lose. You lose, Stark.

487
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:12,122
Pretty decent tech.
Cycles per second were a little low.

488
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:20,798
You could have doubled up
your rotations.

489
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:26,261
You focused the repulsor energy
through ionized plasma channels.

490
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:29,264
It's effective. Not very efficient.

491
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,643
But it's a passable knock-off.

492
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,853
I don't get it. A little fine tuning,

493
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:36,730
you could have made a solid paycheck.

494
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:40,984
You could have sold it
to North Korea, China, Iran,

495
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,695
or gone right to the black market.

496
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,740
You look like you got friends
in low places.

497
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:52,371
You come from a family
of thieves and butchers.

498
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,041
And now, like all guilty men,

499
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,586
you try to rewrite your own history.

500
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:05,259
And you forget all the lives
the Stark family has destroyed.

501
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:09,680
Speaking of thieves,
where did you get this design?

502
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,683
My father. Anton Vanko.

503
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,061
Well, I never heard of him.

504
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,857
My father is the reason you're alive.

505
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,109
The reason I'm alive
is 'cause you had a shot, you took it,

506
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,735
you missed.

507
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,028
Did I?

508
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,033
If you can make God bleed,

509
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,912
the people will cease to believe in him.

510
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:39,585
And there will be blood in the water.
And the sharks will come.

511
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:46,008
The truth,
all I have to do is sit here and watch

512
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,594
as the world will consume you.

513
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,762
Where will you be watching
the world consume me from?

514
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:54,766
That's right. A prison cell.
I'll send you a bar of soap.

515
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,144
Hey, Tony. Before you go,

516
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:00,606
palladium in the chest,
painful way to die.

517
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:21,501
It's just unbelievable. It proves
that the genie is out of the bottle

518
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,046
and this man has no idea
what he's doing.

519
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,883
He thinks of the Iron Man weapon
as a toy.

520
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:32,804
I was at a hearing
where Mr Stark, in fact, was adamant

521
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:36,516
that these suits
can't exist anywhere else,

522
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,144
don't exist anywhere else,
never will exist anywhere else,

523
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,562
at least for five to 10 years,

524
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:45,275
and here we are in Monaco realising,
"These suits exist now."

525
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,526
Mute.

526
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:52,115
He should be giving me a medal.
That's the truth.

527
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:59,456
- What is that?
- This is your in-flight meal.

528
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,628
Did you just make that?

529
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:08,131
Yeah. Where do you think I've been
for three hours?

530
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,300
Tony,

531
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,721
what are you not telling me?

532
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:21,645
I don't want to go home. At all.

533
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,608
Let's cancel my birthday party and...

534
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:29,277
We're in Europe.
Let's go to Venice, Cipriani.

535
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:30,570
- Remember?
- Oh, yes.

536
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,531
It's a great place to

537
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,161
- be healthy.
- I don't think this is the right time.

538
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,497
We're in kind of a mess.

539
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,207
Yeah, but maybe that's why
it's the best time.

540
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,334
- 'Cause then we...
- Well, I think as the CEO,

541
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:45,544
I need to show up.

542
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:49,923
As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.

543
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,341
- A leave?
- A company retreat.

544
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,969
- A retreat? During a time like this?
- Just a ride.

545
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:57,639
Well, I'm just saying, to recharge
our batteries and figure it all out.

546
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,475
Not everybody runs on batteries, Tony.

547
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,568
Hey, there he is.

548
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:16,736
There he is.

549
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,825
What an absolute pleasure. Welcome.

550
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,952
Oh, goodness gracious.

551
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:27,581
Can we get the handcuffs
off my friend here?

552
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,168
Forgive me, I'm sorry.
I'm such a huge fan of yours.

553
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:35,046
I didn't want to make
a first impression like this.

554
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:37,424
He's not an animal. Come on.

555
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:40,969
He's a human being. Thank you.

556
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,434
We're fine.

557
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,770
My name is Justin Hammer.

558
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:54,191
I'd like to do some business with you.
Please sit.

559
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,405
Dig in. What do we have today, Jack?

560
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:03,825
- We have some salmon carpaccio.
- Salmon carpaccio.

561
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:07,120
Anything you want here, we got it.

562
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:11,291
I like my dessert first.
I had this flown in from San Francisco.

563
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,251
It's Italian, though.

564
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:15,128
Organic ice cream.

565
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:19,132
I got a sweet tooth.
Apparently you do, too, for Tony Stark.

566
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,845
What I saw you do to Tony Stark
on that track,

567
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:27,599
how you stepped up to him
in front of God and everybody,

568
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,809
that was... Wow!

569
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,436
You spoke to me with what you did.

570
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,147
And I know that you knew
that I'd be listening.

571
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:35,774
This is why I couldn't bear
to have you shipped off

572
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,652
to God knows where. It would have been
such a waste of talent.

573
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,070
But if I might make a suggestion,

574
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,864
you know,
you don't just go and try and kill the guy.

575
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:47,202
I think, if I may, you go after his legacy.

576
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,371
That's what you kill.

577
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:52,457
You and me,
we are a lot alike in a lot of ways.

578
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:57,170
The only difference between you and I
is that I have resources.

579
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:02,842
I think, if I may, you
need my resources.

580
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,512
Someone behind you, a benefactor.

581
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,681
I'd like to be that guy.

582
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:23,863
Okay. Do you speak English?
Because I can get a translator.

583
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:26,783
I don't know. Have you been
understanding everything I'm saying?

584
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,285
Very good, man.

585
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:31,538
- Very good, man.
- Very good, man.

586
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,747
Hey!

587
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,459
- Hey.
- Yes?

588
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,128
I want my bird.

589
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:43,800
- A bird? You want a bird?
- I want my bird.

590
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,552
I can get you a bird.
I can get you 10 birds.

591
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,178
I want my bird.

592
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:49,806
Well, okay.
Nothing's impossible. I could...

593
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,560
Are we talking about...
Is this a bird back in Russia?

594
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,688
Yes, but the fundamentals
of the company are still very, very strong

595
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,692
- despite the events in Monaco.
- Yes, of course.

596
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:02,235
- The AP wants a quote.
- Don't tell him. Fax them...

597
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,820
Where is he?

598
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,697
- He doesn't want to be disturbed.
- He's downstairs.

599
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,240
- What happened in Monaco?
- Yes, but...

600
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:09,826
But his continuing erratic behaviour

601
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,037
may lead many people
to ask themselves,

602
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,955
"Can this man still protect us?"

603
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,334
Iron Man never stopped protecting us.
The events in Monaco proved that.

604
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:23,006
Query complete, sir.
Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist

605
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,092
who defected to the United States
in 1963.

606
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:30,347
However, he was accused of espionage
and was deported in 1967.

607
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:32,807
His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist,

608
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:37,645
was convicted of selling Soviet-era
weapons-grade plutonium to Pakistan,

609
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:40,231
and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison.

610
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:42,442
No further records exist.

611
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,615
Tony, you gotta get upstairs

612
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,950
and get on top
of this situation right now.

613
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:54,037
Listen. I've been on the phone
with the National Guard all day,

614
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:58,208
trying to talk them out
of rolling tanks up the PCH,

615
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:01,169
knocking down your front door
and taking these.

616
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,296
They're gonna take your suits,
Tony, okay?

617
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,298
They're sick of the games.

618
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:08,593
You said nobody else would possess
this technology for 20 years.

619
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:11,888
Well, guess what?
Somebody else had it yesterday.

620
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,307
It's not theoretical any more.

621
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:17,560
Are you listening to me?

622
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,314
- Are you okay?
- Let's go.

623
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,238
Hey, man. Hey, hey!

624
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,952
- You all right?
- Yeah, I should get to my desk.

625
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,162
- See that cigar box?
- Yeah.

626
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:38,164
It's palladium.

627
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,631
Is that supposed to be smoking?

628
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:51,010
If you must know, it's neutron damage.
It's from the reactor wall.

629
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,850
You had this in your body?

630
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:05,525
And how about the high-tech
crossword puzzle on your neck?

631
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,026
Road rash.

632
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:11,781
Thank you.

633
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,713
- What are you looking at?
- I'm looking at you.

634
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,841
You wanna do
this whole lone gunslinger act

635
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:32,045
and it's unnecessary.
You don't have to do this alone.

636
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,262
You know, I wish I could believe that.
I really do.

637
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,598
But you've gotta trust me.

638
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:40,476
Contrary to popular belief,
I know exactly what I'm doing.

639
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,529
This is where we do it.
This is my humble abode.

640
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:55,074
You can work in absolute peace.
Must be fun to be dead, right?

641
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:56,576
No pressure.

642
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,662
Here they are. I'm very excited.
They're combat-ready.

643
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:01,227
I may have done a few miscalculations

644
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,291
and rushed the prototype
into production.

645
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,251
Sue me, I'm enthusiastic.

646
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:07,629
Go ahead, take a look around.

647
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,344
You don't wanna do that.

648
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,054
You'll be able to access that

649
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,058
as soon as we generate
some encrypted pass codes.

650
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,225
Can we generate
some encrypted pass codes?

651
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:23,436
Get some of those
encrypted pass codes, Jack.

652
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:26,272
Never mind, I...

653
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,818
Wow. Okay. Good stuff.

654
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,615
- Sorry?
- Software shit.

655
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,118
Well...

656
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:42,038
You're good.

657
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:45,458
You really blasted in
past the firewall there.

658
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,587
Let me show you where
you're gonna be working primarily.

659
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:51,631
Go ahead, take a look.

660
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:55,134
Get a good look at that.
That's something, isn't it?

661
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:57,220
You know,
those are really just for show and tell.

662
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:02,308
They're $125.7 million a pop, so...
Wait! Oh, gosh.

663
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:07,313
Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here.

664
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,733
That's where the pilot goes.

665
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:14,862
I'm having a tough time
finding volunteers.

666
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:18,116
I'll take care of that, just leave it.

667
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,701
What you want them do?

668
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:24,998
Well, long term, I want them to put me
in the Pentagon for the next 25 years.

669
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,125
I want to make Iron Man
look like an antique.

670
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,409
I wanna go to that Stark Expo,

671
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:30,336
I wanna take a dump
in Tony's front yard.

672
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:31,838
You know what I'm talking about?

673
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,090
- I can do that. No problem.
- Yeah?

674
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,342
Hey, fabulous! I love it.

675
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:39,137
Hey, this is our guy. Didn't I tell you?
I had a feeling.

676
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:51,190
Do you know which watch
you'd like to wear tonight, Mr Stark?

677
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,526
I'll give them a look.

678
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:57,864
I should cancel the party.

679
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,199
- Probably.
- Yeah.

680
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,910
- 'Cause it's...
- Ill-timed.

681
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,495
Right, sends the wrong message.

682
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,080
Inappropriate.

683
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,213
Is that dirty enough for you?

684
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:18,968
Gold face, brown band.
The Jaeger. I'll give that a look.

685
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:20,928
Bring them over here.

686
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,392
I'll take that. Why don't you...

687
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:40,782
I gotta say it.
It's hard to get a read on you.

688
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:43,242
- Where are you from?
- Legal.

689
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:48,081
Can I ask you a question,
hypothetically?

690
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,457
Bit odd.

691
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:53,127
If this was your last birthday party
you were ever gonna have,

692
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,796
how would you celebrate it?

693
00:52:57,466 --> 00:53:01,636
I'd do whatever I wanted to do
with whoever I wanted to do it with.

694
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,460
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

695
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:37,338
Yes, sir, I understand.

696
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:41,676
No. No, sir, that will not be necessary.
I'll handle it.

697
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:44,095
Sir, I personally guarantee
that within 24 hours,

698
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,013
Iron Man will be back on watch.

699
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,814
Hey, Pepper.

700
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:57,233
I'm going to go get some air.

701
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,693
What's wrong?

702
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,821
- I don't know what to do.
- You gotta be kidding me.

703
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:10,635
- That's it. I'm making... Pepper.
- No, no, no. Don't call anyone.

704
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:12,623
This is ridiculous.
I just stuck my neck out for this guy.

705
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:13,958
I know. I know. I get it.

706
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,293
I'm gonna handle it, okay?
Just let me handle it.

707
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:18,337
Handle it. Or I'm gonna have to.

708
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,174
You know, the question
I get asked most often is,

709
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,759
"Tony, how do you go to the bathroom
in the suit?"

710
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:28,598
Just like that.

711
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:35,188
Does this guy know
how to throw a party or what?

712
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:39,901
I love you.

713
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:42,653
Unbelievable! Thank you so much.

714
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:46,699
Tony, we all thank you so much
for such a wonderful night.

715
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:50,786
And we're gonna say good night now,
and thank you all for coming.

716
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:52,079
No, no, no, we can't... Wait, wait, wait.

717
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:53,956
We didn't have the cake.
We didn't blow out the candles.

718
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:56,834
You're out of control, okay?
Trust me on this one, okay?

719
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:59,253
- You're out of control, gorgeous.
- It's time to go to bed. It's time.

720
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,463
- Give me another smooch.
- You're not going to be

721
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:01,756
- happy about this.
- Come on, you know you want to.

722
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,216
You just peed the suit.

723
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,759
- I know. It has a filtration system.
- It's not sexy.

724
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:06,260
You could drink that water.

725
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,931
Just send everybody home, okay?
It's time to...

726
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:11,766
- If you say so.
- Okay.

727
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:14,060
I'll take this, you take that.

728
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,063
Pepper Potts.

729
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,899
She's right. The party's over.

730
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,944
Then again, the party was over for me,
like, an hour and a half ago.

731
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:26,572
The after-party starts in 15 minutes.

732
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:34,288
And if anybody, Pepper,
doesn't like it, there's the door.

733
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,129
Yeah!

734
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,760
Hit!

735
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:56,612
Pull!

736
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,790
I think she wants the Gallagher!

737
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:29,051
I'm only gonna say this once.

738
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:33,889
Get out.

739
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:43,482
You don't deserve to wear one of these.
Shut it down!

740
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,277
Goldstein.

741
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:48,738
Yes, Mr Stark?

742
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:52,074
Give me a phat beat
to beat my buddy's ass to.

743
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:57,872
I told you to shut it down.

744
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:11,969
Now, put that thing back where
you found it before someone gets hurt.

745
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:19,935
Really?

746
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:31,322
Sorry, pal,
but Iron Man doesn't have a sidekick.

747
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:34,158
Sidekick this!

748
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:44,168
Had enough?

749
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:46,545
- Natalie!
- Miss Potts.

750
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,756
Don't you "Miss Potts" me! I'm on to you.

751
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,883
You know what?
Ever since you came here...

752
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:55,638
Pepper!

753
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,516
Get out of here. Get out of here.

754
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:07,525
You want it? Take it!

755
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:49,984
Put your hand down.

756
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,278
You think you got what it takes
to wear that suit?

757
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,654
We don't have to do this, Tony.

758
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,614
You wanna be the War Machine,
take your shot.

759
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:57,533
- Put it down!
- You gonna take a shot?

760
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:58,868
- Put it down!
- No!

761
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,411
- Drop it, Tony!
- Take it.

762
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,859
Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant
Colonel James Rhodes,

763
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:17,154
inbound from three miles east
at 5,000 feet...

764
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:02,908
Colonel.

765
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:05,119
Major.

766
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:06,996
Wow.

767
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,498
Yeah.

768
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,252
Let's take it inside.

769
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,837
Clear the area.

770
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:38,819
Sir!

771
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:41,363
I'm gonna have to ask you
to exit the doughnut.

772
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,650
I told you I don't wanna join
your super-secret boy band.

773
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:52,124
No, no, no. See, I remember,
you do everything yourself.

774
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:55,419
- How's that working out for you?
- It's... It's... It's...

775
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:58,255
I'm sorry.
I don't wanna get off on the wrong foot.

776
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,132
Do I look at the patch or the eye?

777
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,343
Honestly, I'm a bit hung over.

778
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:04,762
I'm not sure if you're real
or if I'm having...

779
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,931
I am very real.

780
01:02:07,015 --> 01:02:09,016
I'm the realest person
you're ever gonna meet.

781
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:12,770
- Just my luck. Where's the staff here?
- That's not looking so good.

782
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,522
I've been worse.

783
01:02:17,192 --> 01:02:18,312
We've secured the perimeter,

784
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:21,195
but I don't think we should
hold it for too much longer.

785
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:27,618
- You're fired.
- That's not up to you.

786
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:31,538
Tony, I want you to meet
Agent Romanoff.

787
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:32,748
- Hi.
- I'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. shadow.

788
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:35,459
Once we knew you were ill,
I was tasked to you by Director Fury.

789
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,378
I suggest you apologise.

790
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,004
You've been very busy.

791
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:42,341
You made your girl your CEO,
you're giving away all your stuff.

792
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:45,427
You let your friend
fly away with your suit.

793
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:46,887
Now, if I didn't know better...

794
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:48,973
You don't know better.
I didn't give it to him. He took it.

795
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:51,725
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it?

796
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:55,020
You're Iron Man and he just took it?

797
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,905
The little brother walked in there,
kicked your ass and took your suit?

798
01:02:57,983 --> 01:02:59,191
Is that possible?

799
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:01,902
Well, according to Mr Stark's
database security guidelines,

800
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:04,989
there are redundancies
to prevent unauthorised usage.

801
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:10,411
- What do you want from me?
- What do we want from you?

802
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,371
What do you want from me?

803
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:16,125
You have become a problem,
a problem I have to deal with.

804
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:19,461
Contrary to your belief,
you are not the centre of my universe.

805
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:22,589
I have bigger problems than you
in the southwest region to deal with.

806
01:03:22,674 --> 01:03:23,716
Hit him.

807
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:28,262
Oh, God, are you gonna
steal my kidney and sell it?

808
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:31,640
Could you please not do anything awful
for five seconds?

809
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:35,853
- What did she just do to me?
- What did we just do for you?

810
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,355
That's lithium dioxide.
It's gonna take the edge off.

811
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,315
We're trying to get you back to work.

812
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,484
Give me a couple of boxes of that.
I'll be right as rain.

813
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,486
It's not a cure,
it just abates the symptoms.

814
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:47,072
Doesn't look like it's gonna be
an easy fix.

815
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,366
Trust me, I know. I'm good at this stuff.

816
01:03:49,451 --> 01:03:51,827
I've been looking for a suitable
replacement for palladium.

817
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:56,331
I've tried every combination, every
permutation of every known element.

818
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:59,501
Well, I'm here to tell you,
you haven't tried them all.

819
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:04,089
Hey, hey, hey. Special delivery.

820
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:05,716
Candygram.

821
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:11,388
I brought you something.

822
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:13,724
Oh, yeah.

823
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,103
We got you the bird, pal.

824
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:19,521
This is not my bird.

825
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,024
What do you mean?
That's the bird. This is the bird.

826
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:24,902
Yeah. Pulled a lot of strings
to get this bird.

827
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:26,278
This is a great bird.

828
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,989
- It's a beautiful bird.
- We got this all the way from Russia.

829
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:31,533
Hey, man, this not my bird.

830
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:37,790
Well, listen, even if it's not the bird,
I mean, this is a gorgeous bird.

831
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,667
I mean, you know, look,
don't get so attached to things.

832
01:04:40,752 --> 01:04:42,461
Learn to let go.

833
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:47,716
Wait a minute. Jack, what is that?

834
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:51,386
Is that... That's not a helmet.
What is that?

835
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:03,440
Ivan... What's this? Jack.

836
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,520
Is that a helmet?
It doesn't look like a helmet to me.

837
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:09,113
How... How are you supposed
to get a head in there?

838
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:11,037
- Jack, could you put your head in there?
- No.

839
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:14,326
Try to put your head in there.
Go ahead. Try to put your head in there.

840
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,079
See, Ivan?
He can't put his head in there.

841
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:21,542
That's... That's not a helmet. It's a head.
I need to put a guy in there.

842
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:25,003
I need to fit a person in that suit.
You understand?

843
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,464
- Drone better.
- What? Drone better?

844
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:30,134
Why is drone better?
Why is drone better?

845
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:32,010
People make problem.

846
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:33,971
Trust me. Drone better.

847
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:38,600
Ivan, you know, I like you.
I got you the bird.

848
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:41,311
You said, "No problem."

849
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:44,314
That's what you said to me.
You said, "No problem."

850
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:47,192
Now I need suits.
The government wants suits.

851
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:49,278
Like Iron Man. You understand?

852
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:52,489
That's what the people want.
That's what's gonna make them happy.

853
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:54,658
Hey, man.

854
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:58,787
Don't get too attached to things.

855
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,206
Learn to let go.

856
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:07,296
These drones
better steal the show, Ivan.

857
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:11,341
You understand?
Better rock my world, Ivan.

858
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:22,603
Unbelievable.

859
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:25,731
This ought to get the Senate off my ass.

860
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:29,193
- It's functional?
- Fully mission-capable.

861
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:32,946
Good. Get Hammer down here
to weaponize it.

862
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:34,990
Sir?

863
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:37,701
Justin Hammer's making
a weapons presentation at the Expo.

864
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:39,411
We'd like this to introduce it.

865
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:41,079
Sir, I don't believe that the Expo...

866
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:43,957
Colonel, the world needs
to see this fast.

867
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:47,085
- We've got to make this happen.
- Yes, General, but...

868
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:49,171
It's also an order.

869
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:50,881
Yes, sir.

870
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:54,718
Good work, Colonel.
You've made your country proud.

871
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:56,428
Thank you, sir.

872
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:06,313
That thing in your chest
is based on unfinished technology.

873
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:07,439
No, it was finished.

874
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:11,652
It has never been particularly effective
until I miniaturised it and put it in my...

875
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,862
No. Howard said the arc reactor

876
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:15,697
was the stepping stone
to something greater.

877
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:20,285
He was about to kick off an energy race
that was gonna dwarf the arms race.

878
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:21,912
He was on to something big,

879
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:25,457
something so big that it was gonna
make the nuclear reactor

880
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,542
look like a triple-A battery.

881
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:30,128
Just him,
or was Anton Vanko in on this, too?

882
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:33,298
Anton Vanko
is the other side of that coin.

883
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:35,425
Anton saw it as a way to get rich.

884
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:37,886
When your father found out,
he had him deported.

885
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:39,888
When the Russians found out
he couldn't deliver,

886
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:41,515
they shipped his ass off to Siberia

887
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,351
and he spent the next 20 years
in a vodka-fuelled rage.

888
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:46,979
Not quite the environment
you want to raise a kid in,

889
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:51,191
the son you had the misfortune
of crossing paths with in Monaco.

890
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:52,901
You told me I hadn't tried everything.

891
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:55,195
What do you mean I haven't
tried everything? What haven't I tried?

892
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,533
He said that you were the only person
with the means and knowledge

893
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,660
to finish what he started.

894
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,245
He said that?

895
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:06,039
Are you that guy? Are you?

896
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:11,420
'Cause if you are, then you can solve
the riddle of your heart.

897
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:17,175
I don't know
where you get your information,

898
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,511
but he wasn't my biggest fan.

899
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:20,995
What do you remember
about your dad?

900
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:22,764
He was cold, he was calculating.

901
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:25,600
He never told me he loved me.
He never even told me he liked me,

902
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:27,269
so it's a little tough for me to digest

903
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:29,873
when you're telling me he said
the whole future was riding on me

904
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:32,858
and he's passing it down.
I don't get that.

905
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:34,192
You're talking about a guy
whose happiest day

906
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:35,777
was when he shipped me
off to boarding school.

907
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:36,945
That's not true.

908
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:39,698
Well, then, clearly you knew my dad
better than I did.

909
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:43,785
As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of
the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D.

910
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,037
What?

911
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:47,664
- I got a 2:00.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

912
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:49,309
- What's this?
- Okay, you're good, right?

913
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,126
- No, I'm not good.
- You got this? Right? Right?

914
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,086
Got what? I don't even know
what I'm supposed to get.

915
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:56,423
Natasha will remain a floater at Stark
with her cover intact.

916
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:59,426
- You remember Agent Coulson, right?
- Yeah.

917
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:01,345
And Tony,

918
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:05,599
remember, I got my eye on you.

919
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:14,900
We've disabled all communications.
No contact with the outside world.

920
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,360
Good luck.

921
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:21,698
Please.

922
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:25,494
First thing, I need a little bodywork.
I'll put in a little time at the lab.

923
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:27,746
If we could send one of your goon squad
down to The Coffee Bean,

924
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,415
Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run,
or something like that, that'd be nice.

925
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,625
I'm not here for that.

926
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:33,189
I've been authorised by Director Fury

927
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:35,712
to use any means necessary
to keep you on premises.

928
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:38,423
If you attempt to leave
or play any games,

929
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:41,718
I will tase you and watch Supernanny
while you drool into the carpet.

930
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:44,054
- Okay?
- I think I got it, yeah.

931
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:46,014
Enjoy your evening's entertainment.

932
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:14,000
Think this is the power source?

933
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:18,880
Major, this is not a scientific exercise.
Let's just focus on arming it, all right?

934
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:21,341
Yes, sir.

935
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:23,051
Oh, yes!

936
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:25,387
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

937
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:27,222
Is it my birthday?

938
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:30,934
You got it.
What did you do? What did you do?

939
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:36,898
- Is this what I think it is?
- Yes, it is.

940
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:40,068
Hammer, I want to know
what you're gonna do for us.

941
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:41,736
What am I going to do for you?

942
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:44,901
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do for you
is I'm gonna upgrade your software.

943
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:47,951
- And then, second, I think I should...
- That's not what I'm talking about.

944
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:50,370
I'm talking about firepower.

945
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:53,957
Well, you're talking to the right guy.

946
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:58,545
Claridge Hi-Tec,
semi-automatic, 9mm pistol.

947
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,174
Too downtown? I agree.

948
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,968
M24 shotgun, pump action.

949
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:06,887
Five-round magazine.

950
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:08,371
You know what? You're not a hunter.

951
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:10,474
What am I talking about?
I'm getting rid of it.

952
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:13,018
This is the FN-2000 from Belgium.

953
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,395
They do make something
better than waffles.

954
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,356
It's beautiful, but I can tell
this isn't disco enough for you,

955
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:19,733
so I'm gonna put it right here.

956
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:22,861
You're looking at
a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher.

957
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:25,989
Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control.

958
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,574
You're tough.

959
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:30,160
Let me tell you something.
Size does matter.

960
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:31,745
Don't let anyone tell you different.

961
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:35,457
This is an M1347.62 Minigun.

962
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:39,002
Six individual barrels.
The torso taker, powder maker.

963
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:41,213
Our boys in uniform call it
Uncle Gazpacho,

964
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,673
or Puff the Magic Dragon.

965
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:47,761
Okay.

966
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:53,475
These are the Cubans, baby.
This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos.

967
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:57,062
This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle

968
01:11:57,146 --> 01:12:01,441
with a secondary
cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX burst.

969
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:05,529
It's capable of busting the bunker
under the bunker you just busted.

970
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:07,781
If it were any smarter,
it would write a book.

971
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:11,284
A book that would make Ulysses
look like it was written in crayon.

972
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,119
It would read it to you.

973
01:12:13,788 --> 01:12:15,288
This is my Eiffel Tower.

974
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:18,458
This is my Rachmaninoff's Th ird.
My Pietà.

975
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:21,628
It's completely elegant.
It's bafflingly beautiful.

976
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:26,424
It's capable of reducing the population
of any standing structure to zero.

977
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,427
I call it the Ex-Wife.

978
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:36,476
That's the best I got.

979
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:43,233
Are we gonna do this?
Give me something here.

980
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:47,279
- You're like a sphinx. I can't read you.
- I think I'll take it.

981
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:50,240
- Which one?
- All of it.

982
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,243
All of it.

983
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:34,284
Everything is achievable
through technology.

984
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:36,911
Better living, robust health

985
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:42,834
and for the first time in human history,
the possibility of world peace.

986
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:44,586
I'm Howard Stark,

987
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:48,673
and everything you'll need for the future
can be found right here.

988
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:51,801
City of the Future?
City of Tomorrow? City of...

989
01:13:57,641 --> 01:13:58,767
I'm Howard Stark,

990
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:02,771
and everything you'll need in the future
can be found right here.

991
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:05,690
So, from all of us at Stark lndustries,

992
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:08,109
I would like to personally...

993
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,945
Tony, what are you doing back there?
What is that?

994
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:14,657
Put that back.
Put it back where you got it from.

995
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:17,035
Where's your mother? Maria?

996
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,371
Go on. Go, go, go, go.

997
01:14:21,665 --> 01:14:23,875
All right, I think we got...

998
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:26,044
I'll... I'll... I'll come in and...

999
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:31,883
Are you waiting on me?

1000
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:38,306
So, from all of us at Stark lndustries,
I'd like to personally show you

1001
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:40,141
my ass.

1002
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:42,310
I'd like to... I can't... This is...

1003
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:44,729
I can't... We have this, don't we?

1004
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:47,816
This is a ridiculous way...

1005
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:49,734
Everything

1006
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:52,237
is achievable

1007
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,906
through technology.

1008
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:08,503
Tony?

1009
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:10,505
You're too young
to understand this right now,

1010
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:13,591
so I thought
I would put it on film for you.

1011
01:15:15,428 --> 01:15:17,262
I built this for you.

1012
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:20,849
And someday you'll realise
that it represents a whole lot more

1013
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:24,936
than just people's inventions.
It represents my life's work.

1014
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:28,440
This is the key to the future.

1015
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:36,197
I'm limited by the technology of my time,
but one day you'll figure this out.

1016
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:38,783
And when you do,

1017
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:41,786
you will change the world.

1018
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:47,208
What is and always will be
my greatest creation

1019
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:50,962
is you.

1020
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:14,736
- $6. Six.
- I don't have any dough.

1021
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,404
- Here.
- No, sir, that's too much.

1022
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:17,655
No, it's fine. Take that.

1023
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:19,782
- It's fine.
- No, señor.

1024
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:22,994
Take it. Take it.
I don't like people handing me things.

1025
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:24,996
If you just drop that there,
that'd be great.

1026
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,957
- Are you Iron Man?
- Sometimes.

1027
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:29,834
We believe in you.

1028
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:33,004
It was an illegal seizure
of trademark property.

1029
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:34,506
- Miss Potts?
- Relax.

1030
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:35,673
- Mr Stark...
- Is here.

1031
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:37,592
- He refuses...
- I don't. It's fine.

1032
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:40,261
- I'll just be a second.
- Listen, it's our position

1033
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:42,597
that Stark has and continues to maintain

1034
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:45,433
proprietary ownership
of the Mark II platform.

1035
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:48,269
When Mr Stark announced
he was indeed Iron Man,

1036
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:50,522
- he was making a promise to America.
- No, the suit belongs to us.

1037
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:52,524
We trusted that he would look out for us.

1038
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:54,810
- Yeah, but you're not... Burt...
- He obviously did not.

1039
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:57,111
- And now we learn that his secretary...
- Yes, it does.

1040
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:59,531
A woman named
Virginia "Pepper" Potts,

1041
01:16:59,657 --> 01:17:02,367
has been appointed
as CEO of Stark lndustries.

1042
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:03,952
What are her qualifications?

1043
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,119
- No.
- Ms Potts is doing

1044
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:06,371
nothing to manage this terrible...

1045
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:07,956
- Mute.
- No...

1046
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:10,792
Burt... Burt... Burt, listen to me.

1047
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:13,294
Don't tell me that we have
the best patent laWyers in the country

1048
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:15,505
and then not let me pursue this.

1049
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:16,965
I'll get this stuff out of here.

1050
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:19,884
Well, then, tell the President
to sign an order.

1051
01:17:20,678 --> 01:17:22,136
We'll talk about it at the Expo.

1052
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:25,223
Hammer's giving some presentation
tomorrow evening.

1053
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:28,184
- Will Tony Stark be there?
- Will I?

1054
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:31,062
- No, he will not. Bye.
- I would like to be.

1055
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:33,398
- Got a minute?
- No.

1056
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:36,234
Come on, you just got off the phone.
You're fine, 30 seconds.

1057
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:39,988
Twenty-nine. Twenty-eight.

1058
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:41,739
I was just driving over here,

1059
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:44,325
and I thought I was coming
to basically apologise, but I'm not.

1060
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:47,171
- You didn't come here to apologise?
- Look, that goes without saying,

1061
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:48,830
and I'm working on that.

1062
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:52,917
But I haven't been
entirely upfront with you,

1063
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:54,168
and I just want to try to make good.

1064
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,588
Can I move this? This is crazy.

1065
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:57,755
It's like a Ferris wheel going.

1066
01:17:57,881 --> 01:17:59,161
- I'm trying to get some...
- No.

1067
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,095
Do you know how short life is?

1068
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:07,265
And if I never got to express...

1069
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:10,018
And by the way,
this is somewhat revelatory to me.

1070
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:12,520
And I don't care...
I mean, I care. It would be nice.

1071
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:14,272
I'm not expecting you to...

1072
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,523
Look, here's what I'm trying to say.

1073
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:17,442
- I'm just gonna say it.
- Let me stop you right here, okay?

1074
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:20,028
Because if you say "I" one more time,

1075
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:22,905
I'm gonna actually hurl something
at your head, I think.

1076
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:25,366
I am trying to run a company.

1077
01:18:25,451 --> 01:18:28,036
- Do you have any idea what that entails?
- Yes.

1078
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:31,122
People are relying on you to be Iron Man
and you've disappeared,

1079
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:34,542
and all I'm doing is putting out your fires
and taking the heat for it.

1080
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:40,632
I am trying to do the job
that you were meant to do.

1081
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:46,721
Did you bring me strawberries?

1082
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:51,225
Did you know that there's only
one thing on Earth that I'm allergic to?

1083
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:53,603
Allergic to strawberries.

1084
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:57,148
This is progress, Pepper.

1085
01:18:57,274 --> 01:18:59,984
I knew there was a correlation
between you and this.

1086
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:02,223
- I need you...
- I need you, too.

1087
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:04,906
- To leave now.
- That's what I'm trying to...

1088
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,496
Ms Potts?

1089
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:15,458
- Hi, come on in.
- Wheels up in 25 minutes.

1090
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:17,335
Thank you.

1091
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:20,649
- Anything else, boss?
- I'm good, Hap.

1092
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:23,800
No, I'll be just... another minute.

1093
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:26,427
I lost both the kids in the divorce.

1094
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:31,766
No.

1095
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:39,023
Are you blending in well here, Natalie?
Here at Stark Enterprises?

1096
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:42,443
Your name is Natalie, isn't it?

1097
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:45,446
I thought you two didn't get along.

1098
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:48,866
- No. That's not so.
- It's just me you don't care for.

1099
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:51,452
- No? Nothing?
- Actually, while you're here,

1100
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:54,622
maybe you and Natalie could discuss
the matter of the personal belongings.

1101
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:56,165
Absolutely.

1102
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:03,631
I'm surprised
you can keep your mouth shut.

1103
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:04,799
Boy, you're good.

1104
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:07,468
You are mind-blowingly duplicitous.
How do you do it?

1105
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:09,387
You just tear things...
You're a triple impostor.

1106
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,723
I've never seen anything like you.
Is there anything real about you?

1107
01:20:11,849 --> 01:20:12,890
Do you even speak Latin?

1108
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:17,729
Which means? Wait. What?
What did you just say?

1109
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:21,065
It means you can either drive yourself
home or I can have you collected.

1110
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:24,068
You're good.

1111
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:26,506
Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form
a digital wire frame?

1112
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:29,133
I need a manipulatable projection.

1113
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:39,977
1974 Stark Expo
model scan complete, sir.

1114
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:44,023
How many buildings are there?

1115
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:46,567
Am I to include
the Belgian waffle stands?

1116
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:49,195
That was rhetorical. Just show me.

1117
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:06,587
What does that look like to you, Jarvis?
Not unlike an atom.

1118
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:10,174
In which case the nucleus
would be here.

1119
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:13,344
Highlight the unisphere.

1120
01:22:22,145 --> 01:22:27,149
- Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.
- What is it you're trying to achieve, sir?

1121
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:29,068
I'm discovering... Correction.

1122
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:33,155
I'm rediscovering a new element,
I believe.

1123
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:36,951
Lose the landscaping,
the shrubbery, the trees.

1124
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:39,370
Parking lots, exits, entrances.

1125
01:22:44,167 --> 01:22:50,172
Structure the protons and the neutrons
using the pavilions as a framework.

1126
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:54,385
Dad.

1127
01:23:15,616 --> 01:23:20,411
Dead for almost 20 years,
and still taking me to school.

1128
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:31,213
The proposed element should serve
as a viable replacement for palladium.

1129
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:32,381
Thanks, Dad.

1130
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:35,718
Unfortunately, it is impossible
to synthesise.

1131
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:43,809
Get ready for a major remodel, fellas.
We're back in hardware mode.

1132
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:33,442
- I heard you broke the perimeter.
- Yeah.

1133
01:24:34,027 --> 01:24:35,945
That was, like, three years ago.
Where you been?

1134
01:24:36,029 --> 01:24:40,032
- I was doing some stuff.
- Yeah, well, me, too, and it worked.

1135
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:42,118
Hey, I'm playing for
the home team, Coulson,

1136
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:44,286
you and all your
Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.

1137
01:24:44,371 --> 01:24:46,291
Now, are you gonna let me work
or break my balls?

1138
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,501
What's this doing here?

1139
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:53,379
That's it.

1140
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:56,799
- Bring that to me.
- You know what this is?

1141
01:24:56,883 --> 01:24:58,563
It's exactly what I need
to make this work.

1142
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:01,387
Lift the coil.

1143
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:03,222
Go, go. Put your knees into it.

1144
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:05,850
There you go. And...

1145
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:08,811
Drop it. Drop it.

1146
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:15,067
Perfectly level.
I'm busy. What do you want?

1147
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:18,362
Nothing. Goodbye. I've been reassigned.

1148
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:20,489
Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.

1149
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:23,033
- Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.
- So I'm told.

1150
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,202
- Secret stuff?
- Something like that.

1151
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:27,621
- Good luck.
- Bye.

1152
01:25:27,706 --> 01:25:29,790
- Thanks.
- We need you.

1153
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:32,877
- Yeah, more than you know.
- Not that much.

1154
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:53,856
Initialising prismatic accelerator.

1155
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:02,364
Approaching maximum power.

1156
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:51,080
That was easy.

1157
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:09,598
Congratulations, sir.

1158
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:13,811
You have created a new element.

1159
01:27:21,778 --> 01:27:25,573
Sir, the reactor has accepted
the modified core.

1160
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:28,284
I will begin running diagnostics.

1161
01:27:34,165 --> 01:27:35,499
Hey, Ivan.

1162
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,418
I got Senator Stern here.

1163
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:39,942
Thought we'd swing over
and look at some of the drone designs.

1164
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:42,214
The drone is not going to be ready.

1165
01:27:42,507 --> 01:27:43,716
Not ready? What do you mean?

1166
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:47,261
I can make presentation,
not demonstration.

1167
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:49,346
What the hell is the difference?

1168
01:27:49,472 --> 01:27:52,224
Presentation. No fly. No shoot.

1169
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:54,351
Well, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

1170
01:27:54,477 --> 01:27:57,563
What can you make them do? I mean,
this is a weapons demonstration.

1171
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:00,983
- I can make salute.
- You can make salute?

1172
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:02,443
What do you mean, "make salute"?

1173
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:06,614
What the hell does that mean, lvan?
This is not what we agreed to, okay?

1174
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:09,325
You promised me suits
and then you promised me drones.

1175
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:13,537
- Hey, man, everything will be okay.
- This is not what I wanted.

1176
01:28:25,675 --> 01:28:28,260
Hey, there he is. It's the bird man.

1177
01:28:29,846 --> 01:28:35,434
Now you like the bird. Is that right?
Is that your bird? I'm confused.

1178
01:28:36,394 --> 01:28:39,772
You said it wasn't,
but now it looks like you're best of pals.

1179
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:43,776
You love that bird, don't you?
You know what? Take the bird.

1180
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:46,737
Hey!

1181
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:51,450
Take his pillows, too. Both of them.

1182
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:54,662
And his shoes. Take his shoes.

1183
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,417
I took your stuff.

1184
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:03,671
How does that make you feel?
Do you feel bad?

1185
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:07,091
Good. 'Cause that's how I feel!

1186
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:10,928
We had a contract.

1187
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:13,305
I saved your life

1188
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:16,100
and you give me suits.

1189
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:18,352
That was our deal.

1190
01:29:18,436 --> 01:29:20,479
And you did not deliver.

1191
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:25,818
I don't know if you're a genius or a fraud.
I don't know what you are.

1192
01:29:28,154 --> 01:29:31,490
Something really, really great
fell into my lap.

1193
01:29:32,117 --> 01:29:35,327
And if it hadn't,
I'd be at your mercy tonight.

1194
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:39,373
Now I have a piece of Stark tech
that I pimped out myself.

1195
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:41,375
And now your overpriced paperweights

1196
01:29:41,459 --> 01:29:44,044
are gonna look like a backdrop
to my demonstration.

1197
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:46,797
Do you dig what I'm getting at here?

1198
01:29:49,009 --> 01:29:53,303
I don't know if you know this,
but I don't speak Russian!

1199
01:29:56,683 --> 01:29:58,559
I'm gonna leave now.

1200
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:01,729
I'm gonna go to the Expo.
Maybe I'll even get laid.

1201
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,314
You see these guys?
They're your babysitters.

1202
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:06,984
They are not to be trifled with.

1203
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,236
When I get back,
we're gonna renegotiate

1204
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:11,655
the terms of our agreement.

1205
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,324
And you're gonna make good
on our arrangement

1206
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:15,951
because if you don't,

1207
01:30:16,036 --> 01:30:18,454
you're gonna be exactly what you were
when I found you,

1208
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:20,205
a dead man.

1209
01:30:20,331 --> 01:30:21,707
You got that?

1210
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:25,002
Maybe you can watch me on TV.

1211
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:36,805
Dummy, you, can we clean up
this mess? You're killing me.

1212
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:38,330
- You know I don't...
- Incoming call

1213
01:30:38,391 --> 01:30:40,142
with a blocked number, sir.

1214
01:30:40,226 --> 01:30:43,437
My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely.

1215
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:45,041
Coulson.
How's the Land of Enchantment?

1216
01:30:45,065 --> 01:30:47,775
Hey, Tony, how you doing?

1217
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,403
- I double cycle.
- You what?

1218
01:30:52,405 --> 01:30:56,283
You told me double cycle's more power.
Good advice.

1219
01:30:56,618 --> 01:30:58,285
You sound pretty sprightly
for a dead guy.

1220
01:30:58,369 --> 01:30:59,870
You, too.

1221
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:03,791
- Trace him.
- Sir.

1222
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:07,628
Now, the true history of Stark name
will be written.

1223
01:31:07,712 --> 01:31:08,796
Jarvis, where is he?

1224
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:13,008
Accessing the Oracle grid.
Eastern Seaboard.

1225
01:31:13,093 --> 01:31:17,221
What your father did
to my family over 40 years,

1226
01:31:18,056 --> 01:31:20,724
I will do to you in 40 minutes.

1227
01:31:20,892 --> 01:31:22,810
Sounds good.
Let's get together and hash it out.

1228
01:31:23,103 --> 01:31:24,436
Tri-State area.

1229
01:31:24,562 --> 01:31:26,772
Manhattan and outlying boroughs.

1230
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:28,774
I hope you're ready.

1231
01:31:31,569 --> 01:31:33,570
Call trace incomplete.

1232
01:31:44,124 --> 01:31:46,750
- Sir...
- You want to run some tests, run them.

1233
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:49,711
And assemble the suit while you're at it.
Put it together now.

1234
01:31:49,796 --> 01:31:52,636
- We are unclear as to the effects...
- I don't want to hear it, Jarvis.

1235
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:58,720
That tastes like coconut.

1236
01:31:58,805 --> 01:32:00,514
And metal.

1237
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:02,432
Oh, wow, yeah!

1238
01:32:15,029 --> 01:32:16,864
I'll keep the car down here, all right?

1239
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:18,240
Thank you, Happy.

1240
01:32:18,324 --> 01:32:23,120
Justin Hammer. His presentation
will begin shortly in the main pavilion.

1241
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:42,806
Yeah.

1242
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:47,311
That's what I'm talking about.
Thanks for coming.

1243
01:32:47,896 --> 01:32:49,855
Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long,

1244
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:54,484
this country has had to place its
brave men and women in harm's way,

1245
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,278
but then the Iron Man arrived,

1246
01:32:56,362 --> 01:33:00,032
and we thought the days
of losing lives were behind us.

1247
01:33:00,867 --> 01:33:03,619
Sadly, that technology
was kept out of reach.

1248
01:33:03,703 --> 01:33:06,038
That's not fair. That's not right.

1249
01:33:06,122 --> 01:33:08,373
- And it's just too bad.
- Oh, Lord.

1250
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:10,542
Regardless, it was
an impressive innovation,

1251
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:13,545
one that grabbed headlines
the world over.

1252
01:33:13,922 --> 01:33:15,547
Well, today, my friends,

1253
01:33:15,632 --> 01:33:19,092
the press is faced
with quite a different problem.

1254
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:22,095
They are about to run out of ink.

1255
01:33:27,644 --> 01:33:29,603
Get that out of here.

1256
01:33:30,563 --> 01:33:32,439
Ladies and gentlemen,

1257
01:33:33,483 --> 01:33:35,859
today I present to you

1258
01:33:36,152 --> 01:33:39,321
the new face
of the United States military.

1259
01:33:40,698 --> 01:33:41,990
The Hammer drone.

1260
01:33:44,535 --> 01:33:45,953
Army!

1261
01:33:59,092 --> 01:34:00,259
Navy!

1262
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:11,937
Air Force!

1263
01:34:19,821 --> 01:34:21,113
Marines!

1264
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:35,627
Yeah!

1265
01:34:39,298 --> 01:34:42,217
That's a hell of a lot better
than some cheerleaders, let me tell you.

1266
01:34:43,344 --> 01:34:46,221
But as revolutionary
as this technology is,

1267
01:34:46,305 --> 01:34:50,017
there will always be a need for man
to be present in the theatre of war.

1268
01:34:50,601 --> 01:34:53,645
Ladies and gentlemen,
today I am proud to present to you

1269
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:55,480
the very first prototype

1270
01:34:55,565 --> 01:34:58,859
in the Variable Threat Response
Battle Suit

1271
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:02,779
and its pilot, Air Force
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.

1272
01:35:04,323 --> 01:35:05,455
What?

1273
01:35:27,472 --> 01:35:30,640
For America and its allies,
Hammer Industries is reporting for...

1274
01:35:46,783 --> 01:35:48,450
We got trouble.

1275
01:35:48,534 --> 01:35:50,243
Tony, there are civilians present.

1276
01:35:50,328 --> 01:35:52,954
I'm here on orders.
Let's not do this right now.

1277
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:54,331
Give them a wave.

1278
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:56,583
Hey, all right. Yeah.

1279
01:35:56,667 --> 01:35:58,710
All these people are in danger.
We gotta get them out of here.

1280
01:35:58,795 --> 01:36:00,796
You gotta trust me
for the next five minutes.

1281
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,964
Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed
around your house, remember?

1282
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:05,092
Listen, I think he's working with Vanko.

1283
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:06,802
Vanko's alive?

1284
01:36:08,012 --> 01:36:09,179
Yeah.

1285
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:10,514
Where is he?

1286
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:12,891
- What?
- Where's Vanko?

1287
01:36:13,351 --> 01:36:14,643
- Who?
- Tell me.

1288
01:36:15,269 --> 01:36:17,270
What are you doing here, man?

1289
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:19,022
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1290
01:36:23,402 --> 01:36:25,821
- Is that you?
- No, I'm not doing that. That's not me.

1291
01:36:26,906 --> 01:36:29,574
I can't move. I'm locked up.
I'm locked up!

1292
01:36:30,368 --> 01:36:32,649
Get out of here. Go! This whole
system's been compromised.

1293
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:35,831
Let's take it outside.

1294
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:49,219
No. No!

1295
01:36:59,188 --> 01:37:02,399
- Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.
- Yes, sir.

1296
01:37:04,235 --> 01:37:07,154
Tony, Tony, I'm locked on.
I have target lock.

1297
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:08,905
- On what?
- On you.

1298
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:15,745
Tony, on your six!

1299
01:37:33,097 --> 01:37:35,432
- What's going on? What's happening?
- The software's been overridden.

1300
01:37:35,558 --> 01:37:36,766
What? What do you mean
it's been overridden?

1301
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:38,185
- What does that mean?
- I think he slaved the drones.

1302
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:39,352
That's impossible.

1303
01:37:39,437 --> 01:37:41,104
- Call the guards.
- All the phones are down, sir.

1304
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:43,356
Well, then call their... Call their cells.

1305
01:37:43,441 --> 01:37:44,941
Their cell phones
are not working, either, sir.

1306
01:37:45,067 --> 01:37:46,276
He's locked us out of the mainframe.

1307
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:47,527
Who's locked you out of the mainframe?

1308
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:49,196
Please, please, go away. Go away.

1309
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,614
- I've got this handled.
- Have you now?

1310
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:51,781
Yes, I do.

1311
01:37:51,908 --> 01:37:54,367
In fact, if your guy hadn't showed up,
this wouldn't be happening.

1312
01:37:54,452 --> 01:37:56,786
So please, now go away. Thank you.

1313
01:37:57,205 --> 01:37:59,539
Listen, we got to get
these bitches out of here.

1314
01:37:59,749 --> 01:38:01,208
What?

1315
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:02,626
You tell me who's behind this.

1316
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:07,255
- Who's behind this?
- Ivan. Ivan Vanko.

1317
01:38:07,632 --> 01:38:10,258
- Where is he?
- He's at my facility.

1318
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:15,222
- I need NYPD, please.
- No, no, no!

1319
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:16,586
- Command Central.
- No, no, honey.

1320
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:18,475
- Don't call the authorities.
- Okay. Right away. Right away.

1321
01:38:18,601 --> 01:38:20,644
Step aside. Step aside.

1322
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:23,271
Tell me everything you know. Go.

1323
01:38:30,655 --> 01:38:33,657
- How are we doing, Jarvis?
- Remote reboot unsuccessful.

1324
01:38:51,175 --> 01:38:52,676
This way.

1325
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:55,178
Nobody's answering the phone.
What's going on?

1326
01:38:55,263 --> 01:38:57,514
Get in the car.
Take me to Hammer Industries.

1327
01:38:57,598 --> 01:39:00,016
- I'm not taking you anywhere.
- Fine. You want me to drive?

1328
01:39:00,101 --> 01:39:02,644
No, I'm driving. Get in the car.

1329
01:40:01,078 --> 01:40:02,746
Nice work, kid.

1330
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:07,876
- You got multiples coming in on you.
- Let's get this away from the Expo.

1331
01:40:13,257 --> 01:40:15,675
When we arrive,
I need you to watch the perimeter.

1332
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:19,429
I'm gonna enter the facility
and take down the target.

1333
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:24,351
- Watch the road.
- I got it. I got it.

1334
01:40:54,757 --> 01:40:55,799
Listen, listen.

1335
01:40:55,925 --> 01:40:57,926
A pack just peeled off.
They're headed back to the Expo.

1336
01:40:58,010 --> 01:40:59,344
Got it.

1337
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:04,599
I'm closing on you.

1338
01:41:04,683 --> 01:41:07,102
Ordnance coming in hot, Tony. Watch it.

1339
01:41:22,952 --> 01:41:25,620
- Stay in the car.
- I'm not staying in the car.

1340
01:41:25,704 --> 01:41:27,288
I said, stay in the car.

1341
01:41:27,456 --> 01:41:29,457
What are you wearing?

1342
01:41:30,709 --> 01:41:33,002
Look, I'm not letting you
go in there alone.

1343
01:41:33,129 --> 01:41:34,504
You want to help? Keep the car running.

1344
01:41:34,630 --> 01:41:35,880
Okay.

1345
01:41:39,385 --> 01:41:41,678
Hey, hey, hey. You can't come in here.

1346
01:41:42,138 --> 01:41:43,680
Hold on. Hey!

1347
01:42:28,392 --> 01:42:30,310
Each set of drones is communicating

1348
01:42:30,394 --> 01:42:33,146
- in its own unique language.
- Well, choose one and focus on that.

1349
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:35,231
Have you tried Russian?
Why don't you try Russian?

1350
01:42:38,903 --> 01:42:41,279
Attention. We have intrusion on Grid W.

1351
01:42:41,363 --> 01:42:43,615
We got it. We're on our way.

1352
01:43:25,074 --> 01:43:26,491
I got him!

1353
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:43,383
- Rhodey, you still locked on?
- Yeah.

1354
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:46,970
Drop your socks and grab your Crocs.
We're about to get wet on this ride.

1355
01:43:49,139 --> 01:43:50,265
Wait, wait, wait!

1356
01:44:09,827 --> 01:44:11,286
He's gone.

1357
01:44:15,332 --> 01:44:17,375
I'm sorry, buddy.
Had to thin out the herd.

1358
01:44:18,168 --> 01:44:20,003
What's your 20?

1359
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:34,475
- What are you doing?
- I'm rebooting Rhodey's suit.

1360
01:44:40,858 --> 01:44:41,899
Tony!

1361
01:44:58,417 --> 01:45:00,084
Reboot complete.

1362
01:45:00,753 --> 01:45:02,503
You got your best friend back.

1363
01:45:02,588 --> 01:45:05,965
- Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.
- Well done with the new chest piece.

1364
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:09,719
I am reading significantly higher output
and your vitals all look promising.

1365
01:45:09,803 --> 01:45:12,555
Yes, for the moment, I'm not dying.
Thank you.

1366
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:14,724
What do you mean you're not dying?
Did you just say you're dying?

1367
01:45:14,808 --> 01:45:16,559
Is that you? No, I'm not.

1368
01:45:16,644 --> 01:45:18,186
- Not any more.
- What's going on?

1369
01:45:18,270 --> 01:45:20,021
I was going to tell you.
I didn't want to alarm you.

1370
01:45:20,105 --> 01:45:21,606
You were gonna tell me?
You really were dying?

1371
01:45:21,732 --> 01:45:23,441
- You didn't let me.
- Why didn't you tell me that?

1372
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:26,277
I was gonna make you an omelette
and tell you.

1373
01:45:26,403 --> 01:45:29,322
Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon.
You got incoming, Tony.

1374
01:45:29,406 --> 01:45:30,990
Looks like the fight's coming to you.

1375
01:45:31,075 --> 01:45:32,909
- Great. Pepper?
- Are you okay now?

1376
01:45:32,993 --> 01:45:34,202
I am fine. Don't be mad.

1377
01:45:34,286 --> 01:45:35,926
- I will formally apologise...
- I am mad!

1378
01:45:35,954 --> 01:45:38,915
When I'm not fending off
a Hammeroid attack.

1379
01:45:38,999 --> 01:45:40,439
- Fine.
- We could have been in Venice.

1380
01:45:40,501 --> 01:45:41,542
Oh, please.

1381
01:45:44,922 --> 01:45:46,297
Rhodes?

1382
01:45:46,757 --> 01:45:49,425
Snap out of it, buddy. I need you.

1383
01:45:50,177 --> 01:45:52,470
They're coming.
Come on, let's roll. Get up.

1384
01:45:55,766 --> 01:45:57,934
Oh, man. You can have your suit back.

1385
01:46:01,438 --> 01:46:02,772
You okay?

1386
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:04,482
Yeah, thanks.

1387
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:08,444
- Tony, look, I'm sorry, okay?
- Don't be.

1388
01:46:08,529 --> 01:46:09,737
No. I should have trusted you more.

1389
01:46:09,822 --> 01:46:11,406
I'm the one who put you in this position.
Forget it.

1390
01:46:11,490 --> 01:46:13,825
No. It's your fault.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

1391
01:46:13,951 --> 01:46:17,203
Thank you. That's all I wanted to hear.
Partner.

1392
01:46:17,454 --> 01:46:21,040
They're coming in hot, any second.
What's the play?

1393
01:46:21,667 --> 01:46:23,292
Well, we want to take
the high ground, okay?

1394
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:24,961
So let's put the biggest gun
up on that ridge.

1395
01:46:25,045 --> 01:46:26,337
Got you.

1396
01:46:27,172 --> 01:46:28,256
- Where do you want to be?
- Where are you going?

1397
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:29,980
- What're you talking about?
- I meant me.

1398
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:32,051
You have a big gun.
You are not the big gun.

1399
01:46:32,136 --> 01:46:33,511
- Tony, don't be jealous.
- No. It's subtle,

1400
01:46:33,637 --> 01:46:34,762
- all the bells and whistles.
- Yeah.

1401
01:46:34,847 --> 01:46:37,348
- It's called being a badass.
- Fine.

1402
01:46:38,058 --> 01:46:41,436
All right.
You go up top. I'll draw them in.

1403
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,396
Don't stay down here.
This is the worst place to be.

1404
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:44,731
Okay, you got a spot. Where's mine?

1405
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:47,135
It's the kill box, Tony. Okay?
This is where you go to die.

1406
01:47:37,534 --> 01:47:39,243
- See that?
- Yeah, yeah, nice.

1407
01:47:47,252 --> 01:47:48,544
Rhodey?

1408
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,380
Get down.

1409
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:04,060
Wow. I think
you should lead with that next time.

1410
01:48:04,144 --> 01:48:07,480
Yeah. Sorry, boss.
I can only use it once. It's a one-off.

1411
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:12,068
I told you that five minutes ago.

1412
01:48:13,403 --> 01:48:14,779
That's your guy here.

1413
01:48:16,114 --> 01:48:18,115
- Excuse me?
- You're being placed under arrest.

1414
01:48:18,242 --> 01:48:19,659
- Are you kidding me?
- Hands behind your back, sir.

1415
01:48:19,743 --> 01:48:21,410
I'm trying to help here.

1416
01:48:25,499 --> 01:48:29,043
I get it. I see what you're doing.
You're trying to pin this on me, huh?

1417
01:48:29,127 --> 01:48:30,711
That's good. That's good.

1418
01:48:30,796 --> 01:48:33,756
You're starting to think like a CEO,
taking out the competition.

1419
01:48:33,924 --> 01:48:36,300
I like that. You think you're making
a problem for me?

1420
01:48:36,426 --> 01:48:37,468
I'm gonna make a problem for you.

1421
01:48:37,594 --> 01:48:40,596
I'm gonna be seeing you again
real soon.

1422
01:48:44,768 --> 01:48:46,269
When they get here,
I think you should station them

1423
01:48:46,353 --> 01:48:49,188
at the south, east and both west exits.

1424
01:48:49,273 --> 01:48:51,357
We shut down the 7 train
in and out of Willets Point already.

1425
01:48:51,441 --> 01:48:54,235
Well, have city buses there
to ferry people to operating lines.

1426
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:55,820
Yeah. Are you coming with us?

1427
01:48:55,946 --> 01:48:58,530
No, I'm gonna stay
till the park is clear.

1428
01:48:58,542 --> 01:48:59,407
Okay.

1429
01:49:01,159 --> 01:49:03,661
Heads up.
You got one more drone incoming.

1430
01:49:03,787 --> 01:49:05,121
This one looks different.

1431
01:49:05,581 --> 01:49:07,957
The repulsor signature
is significantly higher.

1432
01:49:19,052 --> 01:49:20,720
Good to be back.

1433
01:49:21,305 --> 01:49:22,680
This ain't gonna be good.

1434
01:49:26,226 --> 01:49:28,311
I got something special for this guy.

1435
01:49:28,478 --> 01:49:30,605
I'm gonna bust his bunker
with the Ex-Wife.

1436
01:49:30,689 --> 01:49:32,148
With the what?

1437
01:49:42,534 --> 01:49:45,036
- Hammer tech?
- Yeah.

1438
01:49:46,872 --> 01:49:48,456
I got this.

1439
01:50:41,385 --> 01:50:43,386
Rhodes. I got an idea.

1440
01:50:43,762 --> 01:50:46,263
- You want to be a hero?
- What?

1441
01:50:46,598 --> 01:50:49,558
I could really use a sidekick.
Put your hand up.

1442
01:50:49,643 --> 01:50:51,519
- This is your idea?
- Yep.

1443
01:50:52,229 --> 01:50:54,814
I'm ready. I'm ready. Go, go, go!

1444
01:50:58,610 --> 01:50:59,694
Take it.

1445
01:51:28,265 --> 01:51:29,682
You lose.

1446
01:51:37,232 --> 01:51:39,984
All these drones are rigged to blow.
We gotta get out of here, man.

1447
01:51:40,485 --> 01:51:41,736
Pepper?

1448
01:52:21,902 --> 01:52:23,652
Oh, my God! I can't take this any more.

1449
01:52:23,737 --> 01:52:25,154
- You can't?
- I can't take this.

1450
01:52:25,238 --> 01:52:26,655
- Look at me.
- My body, literally,

1451
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:27,990
cannot handle the stress.

1452
01:52:28,074 --> 01:52:32,578
I never know if you're gonna kill yourself
or wreck the whole company.

1453
01:52:32,662 --> 01:52:34,663
I think I did okay.

1454
01:52:34,831 --> 01:52:36,874
I quit. I'm resigning.

1455
01:52:37,501 --> 01:52:38,876
That's it.

1456
01:52:39,461 --> 01:52:42,046
What did you just say? You're done?

1457
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:46,842
That's surprising.
No, it's not surprising. I get it.

1458
01:52:47,260 --> 01:52:50,554
- You don't have to make any excuses.
- I'm... I'm... I'm not making any excuses.

1459
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:51,764
You actually were just making excuses.

1460
01:52:51,848 --> 01:52:53,349
- But you don't have to.
- No, I wasn't making an excuse.

1461
01:52:53,433 --> 01:52:54,767
- I'm actually very justified.
- Listen. Hey, hey.

1462
01:52:54,851 --> 01:52:57,186
- You deserve better.
- Well...

1463
01:52:57,270 --> 01:52:59,855
You've taken such good care of me.

1464
01:53:00,732 --> 01:53:03,150
I've been in a tough spot,
but you got me through it, so...

1465
01:53:03,235 --> 01:53:04,485
Right?

1466
01:53:04,569 --> 01:53:05,820
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1467
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:09,573
- Thank you for understanding.
- Yeah, yeah. Let's talk clean-up.

1468
01:53:09,658 --> 01:53:11,275
I'll handle the transition.
It'll be smooth.

1469
01:53:11,287 --> 01:53:12,326
Okay. What about the press?

1470
01:53:12,410 --> 01:53:14,286
Because you only had
the job for a week. That's gonna seem...

1471
01:53:14,371 --> 01:53:16,131
- Well, with you it's like dog years.
- I know.

1472
01:53:16,164 --> 01:53:17,564
I mean, it's like the Presidency...

1473
01:53:30,595 --> 01:53:31,846
Weird.

1474
01:53:32,097 --> 01:53:33,617
- No, it's not weird.
- It's okay, right?

1475
01:53:33,682 --> 01:53:35,599
- Yeah.
- Run that by me again.

1476
01:53:35,684 --> 01:53:37,560
I think it was weird.

1477
01:53:37,978 --> 01:53:40,938
You guys look like two seals
fighting over a grape.

1478
01:53:41,481 --> 01:53:43,941
- I had just quit, actually.
- Yeah, so we're not...

1479
01:53:44,025 --> 01:53:46,527
You don't have to do that.
I heard the whole thing.

1480
01:53:46,611 --> 01:53:49,530
- You should get lost.
- I was here first. Get a roof.

1481
01:53:50,448 --> 01:53:52,992
- I thought you were out of one-liners.
- That's the last one.

1482
01:53:53,076 --> 01:53:55,703
- You kicked ass back there, by the way.
- Thank you. You, too.

1483
01:53:55,787 --> 01:53:58,289
Listen, my car got taken out
in the explosion,

1484
01:53:58,373 --> 01:54:01,542
so I'm gonna have to hang on
to your suit for a minute, okay?

1485
01:54:01,626 --> 01:54:03,377
Not okay. Not okay with that.

1486
01:54:03,962 --> 01:54:05,212
It wasn't a question.

1487
01:54:10,802 --> 01:54:14,138
How are you gonna resign
if I don't accept?

1488
01:54:34,618 --> 01:54:36,910
I don't think I want you looking at that.

1489
01:54:37,078 --> 01:54:39,246
I'm not sure it pertains to you any more.

1490
01:54:39,331 --> 01:54:44,585
Now this, on the other hand,
is Agent Romanoff's assessment of you.

1491
01:54:45,837 --> 01:54:46,920
Read it.

1492
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:52,843
"Personality overview. Mr Stark displays
compulsive behaviour."

1493
01:54:52,927 --> 01:54:55,095
In my own defence, that was last week.

1494
01:54:57,140 --> 01:54:59,975
"Prone to self-destructive tendencies."
I was dying.

1495
01:55:00,101 --> 01:55:02,686
I mean, please. And aren't we all?

1496
01:55:03,063 --> 01:55:05,898
"Textbook narcissism"?

1497
01:55:07,942 --> 01:55:09,026
Agreed.

1498
01:55:10,111 --> 01:55:11,487
Okay, here it is.

1499
01:55:11,571 --> 01:55:14,907
"Recruitment assessment
for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes."

1500
01:55:14,991 --> 01:55:17,534
- I gotta think about it.
- Read on.

1501
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:23,248
"Tony Stark not...
"Not recommended"?

1502
01:55:24,459 --> 01:55:25,668
That doesn't make any sense.

1503
01:55:25,752 --> 01:55:28,671
How can you approve me
but not approve me?

1504
01:55:29,339 --> 01:55:30,756
I got a new ticker.

1505
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:33,842
I'm trying to do right by Pepper.

1506
01:55:34,427 --> 01:55:37,346
I'm in a stable-ish relationship.

1507
01:55:38,181 --> 01:55:40,057
Which leads us to believe
at this juncture

1508
01:55:40,141 --> 01:55:43,310
we'd only like to use you
as a consultant.

1509
01:55:50,235 --> 01:55:52,111
You can't afford me.

1510
01:55:54,447 --> 01:55:56,699
Then again,
I will waive my customary retainer

1511
01:55:56,783 --> 01:55:59,660
in exchange for a small favour.

1512
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:05,541
Rhodey and I are being honoured
in Washington and we need a presenter.

1513
01:56:07,377 --> 01:56:08,877
I'll see what I can do.

1514
01:56:10,588 --> 01:56:15,426
It is my honour to be here today
to present these distinguished awards

1515
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:19,513
to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes
and Mr Tony Stark,

1516
01:56:19,597 --> 01:56:22,933
who is, of course, a national treasure.

1517
01:56:25,103 --> 01:56:26,437
Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel,

1518
01:56:26,521 --> 01:56:28,897
for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

1519
01:56:29,190 --> 01:56:31,191
- You deserve this.
- Thank you, sir.

1520
01:56:32,902 --> 01:56:34,194
Mr Stark.

1521
01:56:34,279 --> 01:56:38,365
Thank you for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

1522
01:56:38,450 --> 01:56:40,117
You deserve this.

1523
01:56:41,578 --> 01:56:44,037
Oh, sorry.

1524
01:56:44,122 --> 01:56:47,541
Funny how annoying
