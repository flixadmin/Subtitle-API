1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:05,009
Key of A. Watch me for the changes
and try to keep up.

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:08,885
Gideon and I have calculated
another Aberration in Bhopal, 1912.

3
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:11,053
Why can't it be Aruba, 2016?

4
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,646
PROFESSOR STEIN:
<i>We are history's last line of defense.</i>

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,067
I like the sound of that.

6
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:24,491
Have you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

7
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:26,990
AMAYA: <i>The Spear could alter
reality itself.</i>

8
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,154
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>Changes to history
cause timequakes</i>

9
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,536
<i>and Aberrations which we can undo.</i>

10
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,791
Changes to reality, those are permanent.

11
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,544
You're on the run.
Because you're a time remnant.

12
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,546
<i>And now something's chasing you.
Trying to correct the aberration.</i>

13
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,128
One of history's worst monsters.

14
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:44,921
RIP: <i>The Legion have the Spear of Destiny!
They are like gods now!</i>

15
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:47,552
It appears that after the Legion
got the Spear and changed reality,

16
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,762
<i>they kept us around as their pets.</i>

17
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:59,519
EOBARD: <i>You'll be forced to live your
lives in a reality that I created.</i>

18
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,608
SARA: <i>We go back in time, to 1916,</i>

19
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,446
and we stop the Legion from ever getting
the Spear of Destiny in the first place.

20
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,864
RIP: <i>All right, Gideon, try it now!</i>

21
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,790
GIDEON: <i>All systems nominal, Captain.</i>

22
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,285
That's more like it.

23
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,129
Any luck in contacting
the rest of the team?

24
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,211
GIDEON: <i>Negative. But it stands to reason</i>

25
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:24,377
<i>that they would be facing challenges
of their own in this altered reality.</i>

26
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,963
Indeed. Which is why it falls to us
to rescue them.

27
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,846
Engines to full power.

28
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,849
Can you pinpoint our location, Gideon?

29
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,730
GIDEON: <i>Central City, 2017.</i>

30
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,558
That's odd.
We must be in some sort of hangar.

31
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:41,978
One large enough to accommodate
the <i>Waverider.</i>

32
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,618
Gideon, what is that?

33
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,199
Is that another ship?

34
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,160
GIDEON: <i>Negative. It appears to be</i>

35
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:55,745
<i>a desk lamp.</i>

36
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,371
Oh, bollocks.

37
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,420
Right! Engage our cloak and plot a course.

38
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:05,709
GIDEON: <i>Heading, Captain?</i>

39
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,128
The nearest open window.

40
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,303
Any luck?

41
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,516
You asked me that five minutes ago.

42
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,181
You know, it's not easy
getting a 21st-century radio

43
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,771
to communicate
with a 22nd-century Timeship.

44
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,562
Thawne never told you
what he did with Rip?

45
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,068
No. We weren't close like that.

46
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,733
How you holding up?

47
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,117
Better than Amaya.

48
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,120
I never knew about you guys.

49
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,871
There's nothing to know.

50
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,581
We just...

51
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,500
You know, figuring it out.

52
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,669
I figured it out.

53
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,874
We've been assuming the Waverider

54
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,789
is broadcasting using
a quantum frequency, but...

55
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,583
Only if the quad-band antenna array
was in alignment.

56
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,094
- Ray, you're a genius.
- I guess I am.

57
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,879
I kinda forgot what it was like.

58
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,094
So, can you communicate with Rip or what?

59
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,968
RIP:
<i>Sara? Sara, is that you?</i>

60
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,141
Good job guys, good Job-

61
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,139
We didn't do anything yet.

62
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,474
- Rip?
- RIP: <i>Yes, Dr. Palmer.</i>

63
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,393
<i>I've honed in on your location.</i>

64
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,979
Well, haul ass over here
and come pick us up.

65
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,611
<i>There may be
one small problem with that.</i>

66
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,279
Huh?

67
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,246
Look!

68
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,711
It's the teeny weenie Englishman.

69
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,631
Mr. Rory, will you please stop?

70
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,674
Relax.

71
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,561
Why would Thawne use
the Spear of Destiny to shrink you?

72
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,263
Uh, I don't believe he did.

73
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,058
I'm assuming that he used
Dr. Palmer's exo-suit.

74
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,569
Oh, well, then,
he must still have it in his lab.

75
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,147
We gotta steal it back
and then we can un-shrink the ship!

76
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,314
RIP: <i>And then what?</i>

77
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,447
Rip, we have a plan
to put reality back as it was.

78
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,494
JAX: <i>But you're not gonna like it.</i>

79
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,832
Haircut, where to now?

80
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,796
Uh, I don't know.
I never exactly saw my exo-suit here,

81
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,554
I just figured,
where else would Thawne hide it?

82
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,055
All right, let's split up.

83
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,223
Ray!

84
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,355
Ah! Yes!

85
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,109
I have missed you.

86
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,026
Really, dude?

87
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,689
I will never, ever leave you again.

88
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,148
JAX: <i>Rip, we found the suit.</i>

89
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,487
You need to close in on our position

90
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,868
before I have to watch Ray
do any more weird stuff.

91
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,365
En route.

92
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,238
Weird stuff?

93
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,032
Yeah, you got issues, dude.

94
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,506
We got two more rent-a-thugs
down the hall.

95
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,837
I thought that Thawne should have
killed you morons at the reactor.

96
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,011
Then I realized...

97
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,228
Now I get to kill the Legends myself.

98
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,437
Gideon, fire!

99
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,943
Fire everything!

100
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,814
Aw!

101
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,029
Isn't that adorable?

102
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,325
Is that the best you got?

103
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,906
How about this?

104
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,491
Sara! Reinforcements will be on their way.

105
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:31,173
We're headed to you, Ray.
Let's blow the roof off this place.

106
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,589
All right, Rip, keep the <i>Waverider</i> steady.

107
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,112
GIDEON: <i>We have returned to
the Battle of the Somme in the year 1916.</i>

108
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,073
And apparently we're ready
to destroy time itself

109
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,579
by interfering in events
that we've already participated in.

110
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,206
If that's what it takes to save Amaya,
count me in.

111
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,039
Yeah, there's no way I'm letting Grey
go out as one of Thawne's lackeys.

112
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,626
We can't allow Doomworld to continue,
no matter what the risk.

113
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,424
Okay. Well, look, like time,
reality needs to set.

114
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,927
Essentially, we're in a race,
not against time,

115
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,884
but from a reality wave
initiating from 2017.

116
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,172
All the more reason to get moving.

117
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,843
At the very least, we need to mitigate
the scope of the time-paradox

118
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:29,356
by avoiding contact
with our former selves at all costs.

119
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,021
So, all we have to do is help us.
I mean, them,

120
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,811
destroy the Spear without them knowing
that we're helping.

121
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,271
Kinda like Secret Santa.

122
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,447
We already know
where the blood of Christ is, so,

123
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,109
me, you and Ray,

124
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,492
we go back to the Church of Amiens

125
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,870
and we leave the blood
for our former selves to find.

126
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,531
I've got a question.

127
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,784
What happens to us
when our former selves destroy the Spear?

128
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,709
Oh, we cease to exist.

129
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:56,091
Because we never would have existed
if the Legion hadn't gotten the Spear.

130
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,593
You're saying we are the Aberrations?

131
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,388
In order to save the world,
we have to erase ourselves.

132
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,929
Listen, why don't we just go to Aruba?

133
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,773
Get drunk... What?

134
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:13,817
Sunshine!

135
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,568
Mai Tais!

136
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,192
Girls in bikinis.

137
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,572
All right, Ray. You're up.

138
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:24,907
ATOM: <i>I'm on it.</i>

139
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,115
<i>Pardon me.</i>

140
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,700
<i>Excuse me.</i>

141
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,410
<i>Coming through.</i>

142
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,212
<i>Don't mind the tiny man flying
through the middle of no-man's land.</i>

143
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,460
<i>I'm closing in
on the bloods burial spot, Captain.</i>

144
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:43,968
I'm here.

145
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:04,943
Well...

146
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,579
That was easier the second time around.

147
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,629
I knew you idiots
would come back from 2017.

148
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,591
Apart from being incredibly stupid,
you are just so predictable.

149
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,506
Give me back the vial!

150
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,840
What vial?

151
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,718
Ray... Ray, get out of there!

152
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:35,057
You know, my allies keep giving me
the same, simple piece of advice.

153
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:56,953
EOBARD: <i>They were right.</i>

154
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,624
I should have done that ages ago.

155
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,301
Wait! What are you doing?
You're gonna get yourself killed!

156
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,509
- We have to get him! Gideon!
- Sara, you can't... Sara!

157
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,298
Sara!

158
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,800
He's gone.

159
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,318
So what?

160
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,610
Haircut said it himself.

161
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:32,827
We're all Aberrations living
on borrowed time. Besides,

162
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,208
he's alive and well in 1916.

163
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,702
Mick's right.

164
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,290
The mission hasn't changed.

165
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:41,206
Except we can't destroy the Spear because
we don't have the blood of Christ.

166
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,875
So, we steal the Spear
and get it out of 1916.

167
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,670
Now, you do realize that there's
a big problem with that plan, Sara...

168
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,055
The other us's have the Spear.

169
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:53,768
Uh, never stolen anything
from myself before. Could be interesting.

170
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:58,398
God... Need I remind you that
we cannot interact with ourselves?

171
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:02,652
Which is why the three of you are gonna
sneak into the other <i>Waverider</i>

172
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,404
while the other yous are at the church.

173
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,069
Now, that... That sounds like a plan.

174
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,277
GIDEON: <i>I suggest you hurry.
Events are already in motion.</i>

175
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:14,038
<i>Mr. Rory's earlier self is currently
being contacted by Mr. Snart.</i>

176
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,949
All right. If we're going to go
impersonating ourselves...

177
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,244
- You're gonna need a haircut.
- Yeah.

178
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:23,002
Not for nothing, but Aruba
would have been a better option.

179
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,168
You're not real.

180
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,257
You're an illumination.

181
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,469
- A hallucination.
- Yeah. That's it.

182
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,554
Now, did that feel like a hallucination?

183
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,445
<i>And how was the reunion?</i>

184
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,122
I'm gonna let him uh, spin out for a bit.

185
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,625
Then go in for the kill, so to speak.

186
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,879
- Gentlemen.
- What the hell is going on here?

187
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,293
That's what I was going to ask.

188
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,583
Aren't you supposed to be searching
for the Kalabros Manuscript?

189
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,093
- I was...
- And I found him and brought him here.

190
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,095
We no longer need the manuscript.

191
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,255
We have a different problem.

192
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,221
- The Legends are here.
- We know. I just punched Mick.

193
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,135
Not those Legends.

194
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,396
And I'm not "your" Eobard.
I'm from the future.

195
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:20,847
Yeah, what else is new?

196
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,058
I mean your future.

197
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,942
One where we have the Spear of Destiny

198
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,604
and the Legends from that future
are here now, too.

199
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,397
Wait, there're two sets of Legends?

200
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:30,983
When do I get to rob a bank?

201
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,867
Just deal with them.

202
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,699
Where do you think you're going?

203
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,325
To get backup.

204
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,535
I hate when he does that.

205
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,383
You know what to do.

206
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,719
We'll hang back and make sure
everybody sticks to the script.

207
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,600
Okay, figure we got
about an hour before...

208
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,760
Shut up, Pretty!

209
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,645
I'm calling the shots, I'm the thief!

210
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,726
Englishman, disable Gideon.

211
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,937
We can't risk her blowing our cover.

212
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,732
You round up everyone in the library,
make sure the coast is clear.

213
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,741
Then I can snatch the item.

214
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,866
You know what?
This is gonna be a piece of cake.

215
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,071
Hey!

216
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,241
What are you guys doing?
You just left for the church.

217
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,205
So we did. And now we're back.

218
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,621
The church was a dead end, I'm afraid.

219
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,004
Where's Ray?

220
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,880
He is returning Lieutenant Tolkien
to the field hospital.

221
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,839
- You guys all right?
- Yeah.

222
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,641
- I'm just seeing double.
- We're fine. We're fine.

223
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,223
I just need to get to the library,
so I can, you know...

224
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,392
Locate Christ's blood.

225
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,606
I need to run some repairs on Gideon.

226
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,898
Yeah, and I need to
get the Spear... Beer.

227
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,741
As long as we get it first.

228
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,736
Are you not supposed to be guarding
the Spear of Destiny?

229
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,746
Mr. Rory offered to spell me.

230
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:04,493
I thought you and Lieutenant Tolkien were
going to the Church at Amiens.

231
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,127
Uh, yeah. That didn't work out.

232
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,414
But I did happen to find...

233
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,374
Nate?

234
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:18,974
I... I was just saying
that I believe I've found

235
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,975
the final resting place of Sir Gawain.

236
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,685
So, do you want to tell us?

237
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,683
Tell you?

238
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,568
- Are you feeling all right?
- You look like you've seen a ghost.

239
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,026
No. Yeah, no. I'm... I'm fine. Sorry.

240
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:39,570
I think the location of Gawain and,
you know, the blood of Christ is in the...

241
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,746
Galapagos Islands.

242
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,119
AMAYA: <i>The blood of Christ
is in the Galapagos Islands?</i>

243
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,538
Yeah.

244
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,082
In 1984.

245
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:55,677
How could a relic from the
Crusades wind up on the Galapagos

246
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,221
during the Reagan administration?

247
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,006
Perhaps Gideon can help.

248
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,390
Gideon?

249
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,847
Oh, God, where's Gideon?

250
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:05,974
I'm gonna go and check on her.

251
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,772
I'll come with you.

252
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,024
Why are you looking at me like that?

253
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,943
What's going on?

254
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,855
I missed you so much.

255
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,315
You've been gone for five minutes.

256
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:23,662
RORY: <i>I got it.</i>

257
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:27,830
Where's Pretty?

258
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,169
Away team, what's your status?

259
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,873
RIP: <i>Uh, we have the Spear,
but Dr. Heywood is running behind.</i>

260
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,712
What the hell is he doing?

261
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,639
Where the hell have you been?

262
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,970
Uh, I'm sorry.
I just got... I got distracted.

263
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,136
We gotta get outta here.

264
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,809
SARA: <i>Negative.</i>

265
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,852
We got a new problem.

266
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,813
Your old selves are back.

267
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,820
Hang on.
You mean, we've returned from the church?

268
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:56,979
SARA: <i>Yes.</i>

269
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:00,783
And if you come out of the ship now,
they'll see you and wreck time itself.

270
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,444
<i>You're trapped in there.</i>

271
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,196
Good one!

272
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,581
We have to stop them
from getting to the ship.

273
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:15,790
Yeah.

274
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,084
Guys.

275
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,345
We have a new problem.

276
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,432
The ship, it's broken.

277
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,225
JAX: <i>What Sara means is there's</i>

278
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,636
a radiation leak.

279
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:28,803
Radiation leak?

280
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,187
Yes, and it's very dangerous,

281
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,394
so we need to keep our distance.
If you could just follow me...

282
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,558
Wait. Where's Amaya?

283
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,184
She's safe.

284
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,230
We got everyone off the ship right away.

285
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:42,492
Except Grey... Who's working on
fixing the ship right now.

286
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,786
I thought you said it was
too dangerous to be on board?

287
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,456
What's a little radiation
for one-half of Firestorm?

288
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,005
I assumed we'd be on our way
to 1984 by now.

289
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,165
Yeah.

290
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,460
Rip took Gideon offline,
said something about an efficiency scan.

291
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,088
- Which should have been done by now.
- How strange.

292
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,348
Yeah, like how Nate
was acting in the library.

293
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,760
Shouldn't Raymond be back from
returning Tolkien to his regiment?

294
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,060
Ray?

295
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,311
<i>What's your twenty?</i>

296
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,769
I'm standing right in front of you.

297
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,111
Ray, listen to me.
Whoever that is, she's an imposter.

298
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,612
<i>Take her out!</i>

299
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,113
What about the other Jax?

300
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,779
Oh, wait, there's a fake
version of me, too?

301
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:24,942
Yeah.

302
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,324
Ray, whoever this bozo is, kick his ass!

303
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:28,946
With pleasure.

304
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,831
Okay.

305
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,127
- Sorry, Sara.
- For what?

306
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,080
Listening to you.

307
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,544
Just chill out, bro!

308
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,754
- What are you doing?
- We're not imposters!

309
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,420
This is madness!
What has come over you people?

310
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,883
If you would...

311
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,469
- Ray!
- Just...

312
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,560
let me explain!

313
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,639
If fake me is anything like real me,
Ray's gonna need some help.

314
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,189
Copy that, Captain.

315
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,563
Enough waiting.
We've got to get out of here.

316
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,404
We can't.
Our prior selves are out there right now.

317
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,660
If we leave, they'll see us.

318
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,783
- Then don't go!
- Whoa!

319
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,035
Mr. Jackson. I can explain.

320
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,042
That you're the Legion in disguise?
Yeah, I know.

321
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:20,423
Thawne's face-changing technology
is incredible.

322
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,546
Hang on.

323
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,463
I don't think she's an imposter.

324
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,678
This is the genuine Ms. Lance
and Mr. Jackson.

325
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,884
What?

326
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,891
<i>But you told us never
to revisit our past.</i>

327
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,888
Why would they do that?

328
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,061
You'll have to ask them that.

329
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,026
They almost made it
off the ship with this.

330
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,567
All right. Who's wearing whose faces?

331
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,952
We are not the Legion.

332
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:53,202
Believe it or not, we are actually
future iterations of yourselves,

333
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,789
who have traveled back in time to prevent
some form of calamity.

334
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,290
I don't believe it.

335
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:02,047
Why would Rip Hunter
break the first rule of time travel?

336
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,004
I'm asking myself the very same question.

337
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,179
- Ah! Bollocks.
- Bollocks.

338
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:12,843
What the hell was that?

339
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,135
It's a timequake.

340
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,600
The result of us
interacting with ourselves.

341
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,102
- That wasn't so bad.
- Give it time.

342
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:23,566
And whose bright idea was it to do the one
thing that could jeopardize all of time?

343
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,104
Yours.

344
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:26,613
What the hell are you staring at?

345
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,446
Just imagining what you'd look like
without teeth.

346
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,781
- Knock it off, Rory!
- Knock it off, Rory!

347
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,992
I can't believe even we would do
anything so foolish. Unless,

348
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,908
something went terribly wrong
the first time you were here.

349
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,833
- I can't help but notice...
- Not all of us came back with you.

350
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,749
What happens to us in the future?

351
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:47,969
Well...

352
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,296
<i>Dead.</i>

353
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,306
Dead. Good as dead.

354
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,516
Look, the Spear ended up
in the Legion's hands,

355
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,393
bad things happened and it sucked.

356
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,681
But if we prevent the Legion from ever
getting the Spear in the first place,

357
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,941
everything goes back to normal
and you all get to live.

358
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:08,030
- Where you going?
- To think.

359
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,575
Perhaps you should go with her.

360
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:12,951
Two heads are better than one.

361
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:14,779
Yeah.

362
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,792
In the future you're from,
the Legion gets the Spear?

363
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,498
Yes.

364
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,960
So, this is my fault?

365
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,179
It was more of a team effort, really.

366
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,973
Can I ask you a question?

367
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,018
Do you wish you would have used it?

368
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,478
No.

369
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,389
But you could have stopped all of this.

370
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,851
You could have erased
the Legion of Doom from existence.

371
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,485
Could have kept your team alive...

372
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:50,357
You know why I... We can't use it.

373
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,780
The Spear...

374
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:58,744
It draws on our desires,
our weaknesses...

375
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:00,784
Our hatred...

376
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,243
Our darkness.

377
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,250
We're not strong enough to wield it.

378
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,341
The Spear is a weapon.

379
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,003
And you know what we do with weapons.

380
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,061
Doing some light reading
on Zambesi, I see?

381
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,147
What do you want?

382
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,812
I came here to drop
some future knowledge on you.

383
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:29,396
You need to do yourself a favor and stop
being the Ambassador of Chill

384
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,564
and tell Amaya how you feel about her.

385
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,691
Okay, how do I feel about her?

386
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,744
You're in love with her.

387
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,781
Look...

388
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,331
I really, really like Amaya.

389
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:49,006
I saw Leonard Snart
put a gun to her head and kill her.

390
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,917
I watched Amaya die.

391
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,635
I lost her forever.

392
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,675
Do you understand me?

393
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,017
What do you want me to do?

394
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,519
We all want to change the future...

395
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,849
I'm not talking about the future.

396
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,014
I'm talking about changing
who you are now.

397
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:08,150
I want you to do the things
I wish I would have done,

398
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,982
and say the things
I wish I would have said.

399
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,567
You wanna know why?

400
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,491
Because there's nothing...

401
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:20,075
Nothing worse than
looking back at your life with regret.

402
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,670
Yup, still weird.

403
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,056
Please tell me you two
have figured a way out of this mess?

404
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,467
Clearly not.

405
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,104
- Was that another timequake?
- I don't think so. Someone's firing at us.

406
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,056
GIDEON: <i>Captain,
our shields are nearly depleted.</i>

407
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,520
- Copy that.
- Copy that.

408
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,561
- Sorry, habit.
- Sorry, habit.

409
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,238
That's a bit powerful
for World War I-era artillery.

410
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,330
That would explain it.

411
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,663
Ship's taking too much damage.
We gotta make a time-jump.

412
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,924
I really would not recommend that.

413
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,672
RORY: <i>Out of my way!</i>

414
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,303
<i>- Hey, that's my seat!</i>
- What?

415
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,214
Traveling through time with ourselves
could create a paradox

416
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:23,351
exponentially larger than
the one we've already created.

417
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,643
- What do you think?
- That we have to do whatever it takes

418
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,557
to keep the Spear
out of the Legion's hands.

419
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,062
Hold on!

420
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,067
What's goin' on?

421
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,111
The result of us interacting
with our previous selves.

422
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,737
It's a timestorm.

423
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,555
We're still in World War I.

424
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,637
- Gideon, get us out of here.
- Gideon, get us out of here.

425
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:08,850
GIDEON: <i>Negative, Captains.</i>

426
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,890
<i>The ship has sustained critical damage.</i>

427
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,394
Good news, the timestorm seems
to have caused a temporary ceasefire.

428
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:18,739
The bad news is the Legion of Doom
is still trying to kill us.

429
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:19,990
Wait!

430
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,823
How far do you even think we'll be able
to make it out there?

431
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,079
You only have to make it as far
as the other <i>Waverider.</i>

432
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,740
You want us to time-jump together again?

433
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,412
You saw what just happened.

434
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,835
We won't be time-jumping together.

435
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,712
You're not coming with us.

436
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,626
This has always been
a one-way ticket for us.

437
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:46,304
Your team has to get
the Spear of Destiny away from here.

438
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,771
We won't fail you guys.

439
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,358
- Guys, we've got company.
- I see 'em.

440
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,157
Everybody clear on the plan?

441
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,613
Run like hell.

442
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,118
Try not to die.

443
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,745
What about you guys?

444
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:07,996
You ready?

445
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,578
Other than the fact that I can't
Firestorm and Nate can't Steel?

446
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,868
You bet your sweet ass we're ready.

447
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,233
Damn it!

448
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,398
Damien, I think we should
go back to basics.

449
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,607
You're right.

450
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,944
Killing's gotten so gosh darn
impersonal lately.

451
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,343
No!

452
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:18,684
No.

453
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,275
Jefferson? Please. Please.

454
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,371
Grey!

455
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,202
Come on, Grey.

456
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:39,789
Come on. Come on.

457
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:50,967
SNART: <i>Let him go, Mick.</i>

458
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,019
I'm not listening to you anymore.

459
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:57,273
Come on. Is that any way to talk
to your old partner?

460
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,058
I don't have a partner.

461
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,316
I have a team.

462
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,686
Yeah, Darhk said you'd gone soft.

463
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,773
Let me fix that for you.

464
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,321
Mick! No!

465
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,455
No!

466
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,496
RORY: What's your problem?

467
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:24,299
- You're... You're alive.
- You hug me, I'll kill you.

468
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,754
Okay. Later.

469
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,850
Hey! The <i>Waverider</i> is just around...

470
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,809
I thought you were made of steel.

471
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,683
No!

472
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,102
Get this to the ship.

473
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,773
Oh, I've been waiting for this.

474
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,971
What are you waiting for?

475
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,311
Do it.

476
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,435
Death would be too kind.

477
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:31,112
Nice work. Both of you. Where's the Spear?

478
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,569
You took it to the rendezvous point.

479
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,033
Oh, did I? Right.

480
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:38,699
If you don't want to get stuck in 1916,
get to the ship now.

481
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,830
<i>That means you, Amaya.</i>

482
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,207
Nathaniel...

483
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,754
Don't be a douche.

484
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,176
Excuse me?

485
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:52,675
NATE: <i>I won't, bro.</i>

486
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,030
Can't believe we made it.

487
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:13,067
Don't jinx it.

488
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,699
JAX: Ah, he jinxed it.

489
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,156
I hate that guy.

490
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,249
EOBARD: <i>Not that guy.</i>

491
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,049
These guys.

492
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,427
You traveled back in time
to help yourselves,

493
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:36,886
<i>I figured I could do the same.</i>

494
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,638
<i>You know, it's true what they say,</i>

495
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,680
if you want something done right,
you really have to do it yourself.

496
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,737
Give me the Spear
and I'll spare your team.

497
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,910
You can go to hell.

498
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,323
No, but I'll make a hell for you.

499
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,491
Do you really want to lose another one?

500
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,914
Last chance.

501
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,079
Use the Spear.

502
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,267
It can't be me. Use it.

503
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:25,514
Fix the world.

504
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,354
Just do it, Sara!

505
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,360
Look, I can't, there's too much
darkness inside of me.

506
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,691
I can't control it.

507
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,948
I believe in you.

508
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,113
You're stronger than you know.

509
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,715
DOROTHY:
<i>There's no place like home.</i>

510
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:03,723
WOMAN: The cork broke off,

511
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,138
but I think I managed to salvage it.

512
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,056
Here.

513
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,064
WOMAN: <i>Wake up, honey.</i>

514
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,907
To doing movie night more often.

515
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,240
This never happened.

516
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,623
This is the Spear doing this.

517
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,415
This isn't real.

518
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,502
No, it's not.

519
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,511
But it can be.

520
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,011
You can remake reality

521
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,342
however you see fit.

522
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,688
No, you were always
the better of us, Laurel.

523
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,779
You were the strong one.

524
00:30:58,482 --> 00:30:59,950
I'm damaged.

525
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,657
I know.

526
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,464
The <i>Gambit.</i>

527
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,128
Lian Yu.

528
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,301
The League of Assassins.

529
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,466
You, dying.

530
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,881
I could take it all back.

531
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,051
But you won't.

532
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:30,723
Everything

533
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,896
that has happened to me,

534
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,237
all the suffering that I endured,

535
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,070
it's all led to this moment, hasn't it?

536
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,366
The Spear doesn't need
someone pure of heart.

537
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,916
It needs someone strong enough
to do the right thing.

538
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,669
Sara, it needs you.

539
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,840
Even if doing the right thing

540
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,173
means not having you back?

541
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,429
I'm never too far away.

542
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,688
I love you.

543
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,348
I love you, too.

544
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,616
Too slow, Miss Lance.

545
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,701
Far too slow.

546
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,951
To think, you had

547
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:31,708
actual godhood literally in your grasp.

548
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,704
Well, I'm not going to make
the mistake I made the first time.

549
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:38,715
I'm going to erase you all from existence.

550
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,547
You won't even be dead.

551
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,434
I may have made
one small change to reality.

552
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,936
You de-powered the Spear.

553
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,898
Well, I guess we'll just have to
do this the old-fashioned way.

554
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,243
I'm going to drive this
through your heart.

555
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,865
Yeah, about that.

556
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,248
No.

557
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,959
No!

558
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:21,856
You did it.

559
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,020
You would've done the same thing.

560
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:29,989
<i>Remember,</i>

561
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,325
Legends never die.

562
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,161
Really?

563
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,124
<i>- Goonies?</i>
- What's a Goonie?

564
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,208
Ah...

565
00:34:58,555 --> 00:34:59,556
All right.

566
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:03,227
Malcolm is back in 2016, where he belongs.

567
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,730
- In prison?
- No.

568
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,023
His crappy apartment.

569
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,283
And what are your plans for the two of us?

570
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,036
We're dead in 2017, remember?

571
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,614
I'm not taking you back to 2017.

572
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,045
Should have done this in France, Mick.

573
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,718
Could've saved us both a lot of time.

574
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,422
I didn't bring you here
to kill you, Leonard.

575
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,715
So, what are we doing here?

576
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,056
This is where Thawne
recruited you for the Legion.

577
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:45,193
I'm gonna wipe your memory
and put you on the right path.

578
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:48,572
You mean, the path where I join up
with some Brit twit

579
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,028
and die trying to save the world?

580
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,238
No.

581
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,862
You die trying to save your friends.

582
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,413
Still a death sentence.

583
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,791
You know what your punishment is, Leonard?

584
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,746
You end up being a better man.

585
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:05,289
And so do I.

586
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:06,957
"Better?"

587
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,751
- You mean "softer."
- No.

588
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,887
I mean better.

589
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,812
All right, so let me get this straight.

590
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:32,278
In retaliation for me
helping kill your team,

591
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,113
bending reality and torturing you,

592
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,779
I'm to wear this ridiculous outfit
and shoes without socks?

593
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,789
Just setting things right.

594
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:43,119
You mean setting me on the path
to killing your sister.

595
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,121
I've already made that choice.

596
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:48,256
I'm okay with it.

597
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,167
And so is Laurel.

598
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,802
And how do you know that?

599
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:05,307
Hey. Gideon said we're going back to 1942.

600
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:07,685
The mission's over.

601
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:10,855
The Legion's been put back in their
proper places in the timeline, so...

602
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:12,940
Now it's my turn.

603
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,984
Okay. Um...

604
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,155
Well, if you don't mind,
I'd like to get off at that stop with you.

605
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,373
What?

606
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,497
Look, I lost you once already.

607
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,665
Even though it was a different me
and a different you,

608
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,008
and I don't ever want to do that again.

609
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,626
Or at all.

610
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:37,673
I don't know what to say.

611
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,683
Say, "Nate, come with me to 1942."

612
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,183
I can't say that, Nathaniel.

613
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,682
Because I don't want to go back to 1942.

614
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,398
I know that I'm supposed to.

615
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,237
I know I have a destiny,

616
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:56,741
and that we shouldn't damage time
any more than we already have.

617
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,870
But I have to believe that time
is stronger than that.

618
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,035
And that if I have a destiny,

619
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,701
it will wait for me.

620
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:15,718
Hey!

621
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,174
<i>You goin' on a trip?</i>

622
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,389
Uh, yes, in fact.

623
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,096
I was joking.

624
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:24,052
Right.

625
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:27,063
Yes, well, we both know that I don't have
a sense of humor at times.

626
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:30,567
But, yes, I am taking my leave.

627
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,569
What do you mean "leave"?

628
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,400
This team has functioned far better
in my absence

629
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,405
than it ever did under my leadership.

630
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,192
You saved reality itself.

631
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,576
Well, you were there, too.

632
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:44,911
Yes, but I've realized that there is
nothing further for me to teach you.

633
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,204
Any of you.

634
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:50,712
So, what, you're just going to walk
out of here and not say goodbye?

635
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,914
I was going to borrow
the Jumpship, actually.

636
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:54,879
I think Mick would call that "stealing."

637
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,754
Yes, maybe Mr. Rory has had somewhat
of an effect on me.

638
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,722
And you on me, Captain.

639
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,096
I'm no longer the captain.

640
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:05,768
You are.

641
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,562
And in that spirit...

642
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:13,060
Permission to depart, Captain Lance?

643
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,233
Permission granted.

644
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,651
Stay out of trouble.

645
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:25,910
Well, without you lot, I think
that will actually be quite easy.

646
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,303
Mick, you want to do the honors?
Plot a course?

647
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:46,426
You earned it.

648
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:49,475
Gideon! Set a course for Aruba.

649
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:50,976
GIDEON: <i>Roger that, Mr. Rory.</i>

650
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,983
<i>Setting a course for Aruba, the year 2017.</i>

651
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,527
What was that?

652
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:59,280
This is what happens when you put Mr. Rory
in charge of navigation.

653
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,321
GIDEON: <i>In fact, it was another timestorm.</i>

654
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:05,987
<i>It seems the disruption you created
in 1916 was just the start.</i>

655
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,827
We've been ejected out
of the Temporal Zone.

656
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,789
Get ready for a hard landing.

657
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:20,802
Oh, come on! Can we please go five minutes
without crashing the <i>Waverider?</i>

658
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,983
Is everyone okay?

659
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,564
This ain't Aruba.

660
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,863
GIDEON: <i>No, this is Los Angeles, 2017.</i>

661
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,649
Oh, boy.

662
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,156
- Oh!
- Guys,

663
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,700
I think we broke time.
