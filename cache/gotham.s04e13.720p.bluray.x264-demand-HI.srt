LUCIUS: It's like the tweaker

through the cuts on the neck.

85

If it is the same as the last victim,
the toxin creates vines

The redhead used some kind

94
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,029

wore a leather whip.

Because Sofia Falcone is holding
someone important to me captive.

Wow, what a boring story.

it's someone boring.

The last person who bored me
was Dietrich.

- I had to sneak into his shock therapy

for me to hurt you.

657
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:37,198
Thank you so much for coming.

658
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,624
I thought we were overdue
for a chat.

659
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:42,040
How could I say no
to my sister-in-law?

660
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:46,381
(RAIN PATTERING)

661
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,176
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

662
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,425
JOKER: <i>So I strangled him
with his lower intestines.</i>

663
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,148
Relax, buddy.

664
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,104
You gave me what I needed.

665
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,527
The laugh of the century.

666
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:13,951
Tell me something.

667
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:16,863
You appear to have everyone here
under your thumb,

668
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,619
- the guards, the inmates...
- What can I say?

669
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,371
I'm a charismatic guy.

670
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:25,170
You could escape anytime.

671
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,914
- Why stay?
- Hmm.

672
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,425
Why indeed?

673
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,847
- You're planning something.
- JOKER: Righty, old boy.

674
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:41,267
Something spectacular.

675
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,143
See, I'm in this funny farm

676
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:46,191
'cause I need to find
the <i>crème de la</i> crazy,

677
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,193
which is why I need you.

678
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,195
(BOTH LAUGHING)

679
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,699
Ah, you get it.

680
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,251
But when we're done,

681
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:09,298
the world out there,
that'll be the asylum.

682
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,629
What do you say?

683
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,263
Thank you for your kind offer.

684
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,051
I don't expect
to be here very long.

685
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,728
You'll come around.

686
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,152
They always do.

687
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,121
(WHISTLING)

688
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,120
Nope.

689
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,160
Where did these plants
come from?

690
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:22,575
Get out!

691
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,372
Before we call the police.

692
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,596
(COUGHING)

693
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,815
Oh, friends.

694
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,198
You're all so beautiful.
