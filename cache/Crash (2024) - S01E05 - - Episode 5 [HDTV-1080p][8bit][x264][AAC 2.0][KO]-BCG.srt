1
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,950
CRASH

2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,327
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,955
GROUPS, AND BACKGROUNDS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTIONAL

4
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,875
He was a resident of this
neighborhood named Jung Geunsoo.

5
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,710
<i>There have been many incidents.</i>

6
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,754
<i>When he was found, he reeked of alcohol.</i>

7
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:49,674
At first, we thought it was
a simple death of a drunk person.

8
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,635
I see. It's a pedestrian accident.
You saw the victim yesterday?

9
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,555
<i>He was picking a fight</i>
<i>with a man in a black bucket hat.</i>

10
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:59,059
What? A man in a black bucket hat.
He's the one the woman told us about.

11
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,519
I think he was wandering
around the neighborhood.

12
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,564
<i>He was run over by two cars.</i>

13
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,150
The estimated time of death
is between 2:00 to 4:00 a.m.

14
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,361
The tire mark on the neck
is a product used for medium-sized cars.

15
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,739
The tire mark on the leg
is one used for taxis.

16
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,867
The remaining cars are the black Stinger

17
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,537
and the silver Festa
with the broken brake light on the left.

18
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,872
And this is the only taxi.

19
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,166
Let's catch the taxi first.

20
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,668
<i>A joint investigation unit will be set up.</i>

21
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,212
<i>For the serial robbery and rape case.</i>

22
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,172
You're working hard in an intense team.

23
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,555
Inspector Cha.

24
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,140
Right.

25
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:45,939
All right.

26
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:54,114
CRASH

27
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,408
EPISODE 5

28
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,087
You're working hard in an intense team.

29
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,426
Who is he?

30
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,681
I mean the man we said hello to earlier.

31
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,435
Oh, he's Deputy Commissioner Pyo Myunghak.

32
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,064
He has big ambitions.

33
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,774
I think he'll go to Yeouido.

34
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,818
Why? Are you interested?

35
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,030
I met him a long time ago.

36
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,532
The deputy commissioner? When?

37
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,177
VICTIMS, DATE AND LOCATION

38
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,761
We selected the likely areas

39
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,472
and dispatched officers
to patrol 24 hours a day.

40
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,645
How much time do you need?

41
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,938
You have the DNA.

42
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,732
Will two weeks suffice?

43
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,276
- We'll wrap up the case in ten days.
- Okay.

44
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:17,447
Uh, the public is very much interested
in this case.

45
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,200
It has been all over the news for days.

46
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,620
The higher-ups are
under a lot of pressure.

47
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:25,830
Do you all understand?

48
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,165
Yes, sir.

49
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,709
Do you?

50
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,002
Yes, sir!

51
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,504
Meeting adjourned.

52
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:43,389
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
CONTROL CENTER

53
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:48,019
Between 2:00 to 4:00 a.m. on the 23rd,

54
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,563
this taxi passed through Ansu-dong.

55
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,608
- What's the license plate number?
- Here.

56
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,945
LOCATION TRACKING DATA
DATE AUGUST 23RD, 2024

57
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,863
He called in sick.

58
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,115
It was sudden,
so we couldn't find a replacement.

59
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,660
He's usually diligent.

60
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,287
- The car is here.
- Okay.

61
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,090
Uh, may we check the dashcam of this car?

62
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,591
- Sure.
- Thank you.

63
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,220
Let's see.

64
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,429
PLAY

65
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:24,973
NO VIDEOS

66
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,726
It's already been wiped clean.

67
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:33,356
Okay. We'll return this after we check it.

68
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,233
Okay. But what is this about?

69
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,403
May we check the digital operation record
in the office?

70
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,780
- Sure.
- Thank you.

71
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,411
It used to be your precinct,
so it'd be easy to work.

72
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,205
Isn't that why you gave me this case?

73
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,960
If you get labeled as incompetent,
I'll lose face.

74
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,504
Please save my face this time.

75
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,090
- I promise not to be a detriment.
- Okay.

76
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,592
Are you still trying to win over
Min Sohee?

77
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,594
She wouldn't even meet your eye earlier.

78
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,849
She's stubborn, so it's taking some time.

79
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,810
Gosh, giving up quickly could be
the winning move.

80
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,983
I know you want to take her to HQ,
but she's too unyielding.

81
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,195
What use is a sharp knife
if you don't know whom it's pointing at?

82
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,782
Let's wrap up this case quickly

83
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,410
and get another Mugunghwa badge.

84
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,675
Mr. Yoon Pilsung?

85
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,096
Why are you drinking
when you called in sick?

86
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,391
Who are you?

87
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,605
We're from TCI of Namgang Police Station.

88
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:00,401
The day before yesterday…
…late at night on the 23rd,

89
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,237
you ran over a collapsed man
in Ansu-dong, didn't you?

90
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,532
Me?

91
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,078
No, th-that can't be.

92
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,414
I-If it was late at night
the day before yesterday…

93
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,959
Oh, I think I know
what you're talking about.

94
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,088
After dropping off a passenger
on top of the hill,

95
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:23,466
I ran over a dead cat or something.

96
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:35,186
This is your record
from the taxi operation record device.

97
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,775
If you look here,
at 2:34 a.m. on the 23rd,

98
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,361
you stopped
in front of Ansu-dong 17-gil, 59

99
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,531
for 2 minutes and 19 seconds.

100
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,033
I think 2 minutes and 19 seconds

101
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,870
is enough time to check
whether you ran over a cat or a person.

102
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,833
The deleted dashcam videos
will be restored soon, so cut the act.

103
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,839
Did that man die?

104
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,266
We're here.

105
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,017
- For goodness' sake.
- Already?

106
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,770
<i>I was on my way back</i>
<i>after dropping off a passenger.</i>

107
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,404
What was that?

108
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,624
What's this?

109
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,920
What should I do? What should I do?

110
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,598
<i>Just then,
my daughter's face came to mind.</i>

111
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,146
<i>My daughter is getting married next month.</i>

112
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,774
<i>I worried about what would happen</i>

113
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,320
<i>if people found out
that her father ran over a man</i>

114
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,113
while driving a taxi.

115
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,206
There is a chance
he was already dead.

116
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:22,418
Another car had run over the victim
and fled before you did.

117
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,172
The area that particular car ran over
was the direct cause of death.

118
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,927
By the act of the settlement
of traffic accidents,

119
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,096
you aren't penalized
for running over a dead person.

120
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:39,644
You gave up on
an opportunity to prove your innocence.

121
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,804
Are you okay?

122
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,016
You look upset.

123
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,355
Do you know what the hardest part
of traffic investigation is?

124
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:30,611
It's that, in many cases,
the culprit is often another victim.

125
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,532
Of course, there are many bad ones.

126
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,557
LETTER OF APPRECIATION

127
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,435
AWARD CERTIFICATE

128
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,075
Did you have dinner?

129
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,160
You're not sleeping?

130
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:23,581
If you haven't,
have some doenjang stew I made.

131
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,666
It's okay. Don't worry about me.

132
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,751
Go back to sleep.

133
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:28,961
I'm not going to eat.

134
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,213
I'm full. Go to sleep.

135
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,177
- I'm going to the restroom.
- Okay.

136
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,852
It's tasty.

137
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,816
I thought you were full.

138
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,485
Well,

139
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,945
I was just going to have a taste.

140
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,198
You didn't have dinner until this hour?

141
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,075
I don't need rice. I'll just have--

142
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,536
I'll have some.

143
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,372
It's tasty.

144
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,624
Dad.

145
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,835
You add something to the doenjang stew
in secret, don't you?

146
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,130
Why does mine taste different
when I use the same recipe?

147
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:16,801
A meal someone else makes for you
tastes better.

148
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,305
It's delicious.

149
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,602
The radish kimchi is insane.

150
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,978
- It's insane, right?
- Yes.

151
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,397
The radish was high-quality.

152
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,988
What is it?

153
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,782
Dad.

154
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,243
Promise me one thing.

155
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,872
If you hit someone by accident
while driving,

156
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,916
call the police no matter what.

157
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,544
Don't run away because no one saw you.

158
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,755
I can't believe you.
I'm not the type to do that.

159
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,759
You're right. You'd rather
get arrested than run away.

160
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,095
But promise me just in case.

161
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,514
Stop talking nonsense and eat.

162
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,100
I won't be able to eat
unless you make a promise.

163
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,059
Promise me.

164
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,271
I promise.

165
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,275
- Thank you for the food.
- Okay.

166
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,348
SEOUL NAMGANG POLICE STATION

167
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,357
You've been getting attacked the same way.

168
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,276
Everyone has their own attacking pattern.

169
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,320
You need to remember it well.

170
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:03,032
All right. Attack me this time.

171
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,710
Why can't you land an attack once?

172
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,505
How will you catch the culprit?

173
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,716
What good is being smart
if your body can't keep up?

174
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,468
It's the same with the bicycle.

175
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,346
If the culprit runs off in a car,
will you chase him on a bike?

176
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,389
A police officer shouldn't be slow.

177
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,350
You'll lose the chance to save someone.

178
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,435
Okay.

179
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,658
What are you doing? A shoulder throw?

180
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,159
To do the shoulder throw,

181
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,662
pull the elbow downward with force.

182
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:57,336
For goodness' sake.
I told you not to show me your back.

183
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,716
Do you surrender? Tap out.
Tap out if you surrender.

184
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,804
Tap out.

185
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,181
Tap out.

186
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,813
My goodness.

187
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:18,983
Inspector Cha.

188
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,444
Inspector Cha.

189
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,989
I told you to tap out.

190
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,491
- Inspector Cha. Yes?
- Lieutenant.

191
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,077
Yoon Pilsung's dashcam videos
have been restored.

192
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,664
- Did you kill him?
- No.

193
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,586
He isn't breathing.

194
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,590
What?

195
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,467
Gosh, that startled me.

196
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,554
Please save me.

197
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,097
Gosh, you startled me.

198
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,724
Are you okay?

199
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,563
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

200
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,570
- Tap out like this. Tap.
- Okay.

201
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,877
He was quite visible.
How did he fail to see him?

202
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,671
Since it's a dashcam video,

203
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,215
the field of vision is broader
than of the driver.

204
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,885
He was turning into a narrow alley too.

205
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,762
It's easy to miss what's on the road

206
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,181
when you're steering the wheel.
Let's keep watching.

207
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,983
It's just as he said.

208
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,320
His daughter's wedding
stopped him from calling the police.

209
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,113
Hold on.

210
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,783
Can you rewind it a bit?

211
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,455
Over there.

212
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,418
That's the silver Festa, isn't it?

213
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,712
It has a broken brake light.
It's the suspect.

214
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:08,884
If that's the hit-and-runner,
why did they stay behind and not flee?

215
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,761
Let's keep watching.

216
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,554
- Okay.
- Let's watch.

217
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:15,975
Stop.

218
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,227
Let's watch the rear camera.

219
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,108
Play it one frame at a time.

220
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,779
Stop.

221
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,283
There's someone inside.

222
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,035
Hold on. That's…

223
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,871
It's the man who got in a fight
with the victim, Jung Geunsoo.

224
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,081
What? Then he was there…

225
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,791
He was watching

226
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,711
until a second car showed up.

227
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,340
This is Eo Hyunkyung of TCI.

228
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:50,718
Yes.

229
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,761
Did you find it?

230
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,347
They found the silver Festa.

231
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,394
We received a report about a car
without a phone number

232
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,521
in someone's designated parking spot.

233
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,523
The license plate is fake.

234
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,693
We checked the VIN and
saw it was stolen ten days ago.

235
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,695
Let's see.

236
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,495
- It has been scissored.
- Scissored?

237
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,124
Yes. If you stab the keyhole
with scissors and turn it upward,

238
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,959
it takes less than two seconds.

239
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,088
It's an old-fashioned method.
It doesn't work on modern cars.

240
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,216
A car thief drove around in a stolen car

241
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,218
and killed a man by running him over.

242
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,305
That explains the hit-and-run.

243
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,890
He already removed the SD card.

244
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,436
By the way,

245
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,856
a car was reported stolen last night.

246
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,276
What was the car model?

247
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,403
A Pride. It's an old car.

248
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,073
I got a cheap used car
since I had just gotten my license.

249
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,034
Still, the dashcam and GPS were new.

250
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,912
I see. Were there any valuables
inside the vehicle?

251
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,623
My wallet. I can be quite forgetful.

252
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,750
I see.

253
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,753
Okay, we'll get back to you. Thank you.

254
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,132
Which division received the report?

255
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,259
Namgang Police Station's
Criminal Division.

256
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,386
I see. All right.

257
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,931
We'll go and check. Thank you.

258
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,557
I'll get going then.

259
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:30,109
What's up with Superintendent So?
Why didn't he investigate already?

260
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,402
They're busy catching the serial rapist.

261
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,072
He travels in stolen cars.

262
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:39,159
Then it's likely he will commit crimes
outside of our jurisdiction.

263
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,164
See if there were any car theft cases
targeting old models

264
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,333
- in other precincts.
- Okay.

265
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:51,296
By the way, where are Donggi
and Inspector Cha?

266
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,674
They're checking the surveillance cameras.

267
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,850
Are you okay?
Why didn't you tap out earlier?

268
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:07,104
I wanted to see what would happen.

269
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,188
What?

270
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,154
Here.

271
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,281
Isn't this the man
who killed Jung Geunsoo?

272
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,824
The hit-and-runner.

273
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,952
Is that a cigarette?

274
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,039
A man in a black bucket hat.
He's the one the woman told us about.

275
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,752
A cigarette.

276
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,841
Where are you going?

277
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,889
Ma'am, plastic bags.

278
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,141
Do you have plastic bags? I'll take a few.

279
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,476
I'll take some chopsticks too. Thank you.

280
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,943
What are you doing?

281
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,487
- The man in the bucket hat.
- Yes?

282
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,198
We caught him on the CCTV.

283
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,700
CCTV. And?

284
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,036
He was holding a cigarette in his hand.

285
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,705
Oh! A cigarette.

286
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,082
- Are those chopsticks? Give me.
- Yes.

287
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,584
- And a bag.
- Here it is.

288
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,504
What is it? What's going on?

289
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,092
Here. Cigarettes.

290
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,887
I see. It must be a lead.

291
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,098
Yes, cigarette butts.

292
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,101
They're from a scene
and may have the culprit's DNA.

293
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,396
Yes.

294
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,690
But there are quite a lot.

295
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,194
SEOUL NAMGANG POLICE STATION

296
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,029
<i>Hey, Min Sohee.</i>

297
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,324
See for yourself.

298
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:46,328
My men haven't gone home in days
because of the serial rapist.

299
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,663
A car thief?

300
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,875
Then you should've called for backup
or transferred the case.

301
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,418
Hey, Min Sohee!

302
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,093
Can't you grasp the situation?

303
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,553
Don't you know
what a joint investigation is?

304
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,348
Must I explain every detail to you?

305
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,644
A man was crushed to death by a car.
The culprit is a car thief.

306
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,605
Had we caught the car thief sooner,

307
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,149
no one would've died.

308
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,611
Excuse me?

309
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,038
Superintendent So.

310
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,458
Do you have the eighth victim's statement?

311
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,252
Oh. Yes.

312
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,892
The documents are in the cabinet,
so do whatever you want with them.

313
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,394
Get out of my way.

314
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,835
Let's go.

315
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,136
- What's wrong?
- What do you mean?

316
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,929
Why are you walking so fast?

317
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,931
Don't you know?
I always walk fast.

318
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,016
Min Sohee.

319
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,528
Do you need help?

320
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,364
No, thank you.

321
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:50,077
We met briefly earlier
with Deputy Commissioner Pyo.

322
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:51,953
Yes.

323
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,958
He is Director General Lee Taeju
of Major Crimes Division.

324
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,836
This is Inspector Cha Yeonho,
a new member of my team.

325
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,671
I'm Lee Taeju.

326
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,132
Let's shake hands another time.

327
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,179
Please take good care of Lieutenant Min.

328
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,018
Let's talk as we go.

329
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,365
<i>The number you've dialed…</i>

330
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,866
What are you doing?

331
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,161
So you didn't change your number.

332
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,289
I was checking,
since I couldn't reach you.

333
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,878
Is your father doing well?

334
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,214
Private conversations
are for private occasions.

335
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,973
You must've gotten my text.
Why didn't you reply?

336
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,182
Don't you like the offer?

337
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,934
I don't think it's my place.

338
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,812
You don't think it's your place.

339
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:03,608
Everyone's dying to join
the headquarters' Major Crimes Division.

340
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,693
That's good.

341
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,029
Choose from the ones
who are dying to join.

342
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,865
Such an opportunity is hard to come by.

343
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,242
You should learn to accept a favor.

344
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,704
It's too bad
that I'm not sly like a certain someone.

345
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,165
- Min Sohee.
- And that position

346
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,083
shouldn't be handed over as a favor.

347
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,586
It's the Major Crimes Division.

348
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,797
You should find the most fitting
and responsible person,

349
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,675
not treat it as a stepping-stone
to success, like you do.

350
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:33,763
Such old-fashioned practice should
be eradicated, Director General Lee Taeju.

351
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,562
<i>The doors are opening.</i>

352
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,283
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

353
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,702
Do you have an appointment?

354
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,496
No.

355
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,414
Do you like porgy?

356
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,084
Yes, sure.

357
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,306
It's fine.

358
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,649
Why? What is it?

359
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,777
If you have something to say, go ahead.

360
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,239
Do you have coins?

361
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,334
Let me tell you this just in case.

362
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:50,507
Don't date anyone at your workplace.
If it doesn't work out…

363
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,509
You saw how it was.

364
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,389
Why aren't you going?

365
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,937
Others are dying to join
Major Crimes Division.

366
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,358
It isn't a position I earned
with my talent.

367
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,905
If it's someone's favor, I'll be indebted.

368
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,784
Then I'll be forced to do things
against my will.

369
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,290
I can't do that
since I have a bad personality.

370
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,919
You're right.

371
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,089
What am I right about?

372
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,552
If you're done, let's go.

373
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,263
What am I right about?

374
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:41,558
Answer me, Inspector Cha.
Me having a bad personality?

375
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,143
I'm not done with my beverage.

376
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,728
Why won't you answer me?

377
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,770
Inspector Cha.

378
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:57,407
It must be hard to work
at a police station at the front lines.

379
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,996
It was Deputy Commissioner's request,
so I'll finish it as soon as possible.

380
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,289
Of course.

381
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,837
It's upsetting that such a heinous crime
occurred at our precinct.

382
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,047
For goodness' sake.

383
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,176
In any case, I'm disappointed.

384
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:20,221
You could've given me a heads up
about it to me,

385
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,307
at the very least.

386
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,434
You know the Deputy Commissioner's style.

387
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,146
I can't believe you.

388
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:31,566
I heard that you were very successful
these days.

389
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,861
- My goodness.
- When I look at you,

390
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:38,406
I'm reminded of the Deputy Commissioner
in his younger days.

391
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,534
Shall I say the aura? Or charisma?

392
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:45,163
He seems serious and strict on the outside
but very soft on the inside.

393
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,247
A doppelgänger.

394
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:51,628
You play golf, right?
We should go to the field…

395
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,677
I saw someone new in TCI.

396
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,847
His name is Cha Yeonho.

397
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,849
He joined through special recruitment.

398
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:08,269
He graduated from KAIST
and worked as an insurance investigator.

399
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,563
In any case, he's an eccentric one.

400
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,235
You must be busy being in charge…

401
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,278
…of the joint investigation unit.

402
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,323
Why are you worried about a new recruit?

403
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,741
DEPUTY COMMISSIONER PYO

404
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:22,659
Please excuse me.

405
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,621
Yes, Deputy Commissioner.

406
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:33,378
Has he always been that annoying?
Was he always like that?

407
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,964
Gosh, how obnoxious.

408
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,092
I'm back.

409
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,594
We have the DNA analysis
for the cigarette butts.

410
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,639
There wasn't a match
in the forensic DNA database.

411
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:51,855
Unless he committed
a serious crime like murder or rape,

412
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,607
he was probably exempt
from getting his DNA collected.

413
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,443
He could also be a first offender

414
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,319
- or a minor.
- Right.

415
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,700
Gosh, I can't focus.

416
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:08,246
Give me the files
that are unrelated to the car theft.

417
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,581
I'll return them.

418
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,085
- Here you go.
- Oh, right. That jerk.

419
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,462
What jerk?

420
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,006
It's nothing. I can do it.

421
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,092
I'll go return them.

422
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,987
BURGLARY AND RAPE CASE

423
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,034
JISAN-GU, EUNSEO-GU,
MOONAK-GU, NAMGANG-GU

424
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,376
It's Inspector Cha Yeonho, right?

425
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,798
What brings you here?

426
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,674
I came to return some files.

427
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,512
I'll get going now.

428
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,837
SEO YUJUNG

429
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,919
The wallet came back?

430
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,630
You mean the wallet
that was inside the stolen car?

431
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,716
Yes, it was in the mailbox.

432
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,634
Everything is here, except for cash.

433
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,386
<i>I see.</i>

434
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:31,681
Perhaps the thief threw it away
and someone put it in the mailbox.

435
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,475
Nothing strange happened, right?

436
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,352
<i>Not really.</i>

437
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,521
I see. Okay.

438
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,523
Please call me if anything comes up.

439
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,358
Okay.

440
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,194
The wallet came back?

441
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,697
Yes. It was Ms. Seo Yujung,
the victim whose Pride got stolen.

442
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,407
Everything was there except for cash.

443
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,246
I'll step outside for a short while.

444
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,915
Where are you going?

445
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,709
I'll tell you when I come back.

446
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:04,964
Wait for me.

447
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,969
Whenever you say you'll explain later,

448
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,387
something bad happens.

449
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,222
Let's go.

450
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,102
Lieutenant Min, where are you going?

451
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,355
Ouch!

452
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,689
For goodness' sake.

453
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,042
<i>The number you have dialed…</i>

454
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,128
Seo Yujung isn't answering.
Did she go out?

455
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,639
Stop. If she were home,
she would've answered.

456
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:55,890
Let's go.

457
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,269
Why would the culprit return the wallet?

458
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,855
If he had a conscience,
he wouldn't have stolen the cars.

459
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:03,815
Don't you agree?

460
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:08,820
What is it this time?

461
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,365
Someone smoked here until a moment ago.

462
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,699
Inspector Cha, stay here.
I'll go upstairs and check.

463
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,841
Ms. Seo Yujung.

464
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,102
Ms. Seo Yujung, it's the police.

465
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,187
Ms. Seo Yujung.

466
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,192
Ms. Seo Yujung, it's the police.
Ms. Seo Yujung.

467
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,568
Hold on.

468
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,042
Ms. Seo Yujung.

469
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,796
- Please help me.
- Ms. Seo Yujung, we're the police.

470
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,297
Are you okay?

471
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,735
Ms. Seo Yujung, more officers will come.

472
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,862
- So stay here.
- Please don't go.

473
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,573
I won't go anywhere. I'll stay here.

474
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,117
I'll stay here. Don't worry.

475
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,662
It's okay. Calm down.

476
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,810
What?

477
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,189
Hey!

478
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:02,618
Whoa, whoa.

479
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,097
My goodness.

480
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,640
Who are you guys?

481
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,852
What are you doing?

482
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,812
Are you okay?

483
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,522
Who are you?

484
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,595
- Gosh.
- I'm sorry.

485
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,805
Goodness, what is he doing?

486
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,027
Damn, this cop won't give up.

487
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,287
Let go.

488
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,129
Go on in.

489
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,655
- What happened?
- What's going on?

490
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,657
You get hurt so often.

491
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,201
Where will you get hurt next time?

492
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,536
I almost had him.

493
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,247
Had it been a bit higher,
you could've gone blind.

494
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,959
You should've worn different shoes.

495
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:21,007
Did you see his face?

496
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,675
He was wearing a mask.

497
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:25,970
Coming through.

498
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,432
He's gone. I think he ran away.

499
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,852
- The scissors?
- National Forensic Service took them,

500
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,604
but I doubt we'll get a print.
He was wearing gloves, no?

501
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,398
- Yes.
- How's Ms. Seo Yujung?

502
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,858
She has calmed down a lot.

503
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:42,153
But I don't think it was
a simple burglary.

504
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,155
Was it… …rape?

505
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:47,867
He knew her number and workplace.

506
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,369
That means he did a background check
on the victim.

507
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,496
He probably found out through the wallet.

508
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,539
What?

509
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,499
- Coming through.
- We saw them yesterday.

510
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,293
My goodness.

511
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,711
Over there.

512
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,212
My goodness.

513
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,590
This is TCI's case.

514
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,884
Yes. We'll take over from here.

515
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,553
I'll receive a report at the station.

516
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:08,471
Says who?

517
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,932
It's an attempted rape.

518
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,061
The priority is to check if it's related
to the serial rape case.

519
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,648
By the way,

520
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,819
who's the one
that lost the suspect after a fight?

521
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:26,906
Excuse me.

522
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,992
Excuse me, you cannot film the scene.

523
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,827
Please get going.

524
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,913
Excuse me.

525
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,082
Coming through.
Don't film here.

526
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,463
Excuse me.

527
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,561
Everyone is looking at us.

528
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,524
It isn't like that. Don't worry about it.

529
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,859
What's wrong with them?

530
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,367
Hello.

531
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,453
Are you okay?

532
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,373
Look at his face.

533
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,501
If it was too hard,
you should've asked for backup.

534
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,546
Don't push yourself too hard and get hurt.

535
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,310
Please begin.

536
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:39,854
Okay.

537
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:44,358
On the 23rd of this month,
a hit-and-run occurred late at night

538
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,610
in the alley of Ansu-dong.

539
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:50,781
The victim died and our team put out
a search for the hit-and-run car.

540
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,658
But the car was reported stolen.

541
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:55,494
What do you mean?
The car in a hit-and-run was stolen?

542
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,332
So a car thief drove around
in a stolen car, hit a man, and ran off?

543
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,877
Yes. He used the scissor method.

544
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:08,299
He used scissors to destroy the key box
and stole valuables in the car.

545
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,802
We checked with three close precincts
and found there have been

546
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:15,264
dozens of similar car burglary cases
in the past four months.

547
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:19,643
Seo Yujung's car theft case
has already been reported to our station.

548
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,315
Why did you go
to Seo Yujung's house today?

549
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:28,194
This morning, she called and told us
that her wallet was returned.

550
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:31,572
- It had gone missing with the car.
- So, the thief stole the car

551
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,073
yet returned the wallet.

552
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,533
How kind of him.

553
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,744
And then he went to her house to rape her.

554
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,996
It might be preemptive behavior.

555
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,374
Such behaviors are shown
in serial rapists.

556
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,503
P-- Preemptive behavior?

557
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,421
Preemptive behavior.

558
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,924
To leave a good impression on others,

559
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,886
one may downplay or exaggerate the truth
or fabricates lies.

560
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:58,015
Like you said, it's a common pattern
among serial sexual offenders.

561
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,434
If that's the case,
the man who visited Seo Yujung is--

562
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,936
I can't be certain.

563
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,401
But the car thief we're after

564
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,988
and the serial rapist
the joint investigation unit is after

565
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,699
might be the same suspect.

566
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,035
- What?
- That makes no sense.

567
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,665
- For goodness' sake.
- He's ridiculous.

568
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,291
Geez.

569
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,503
- What's wrong with him?
- Seriously.

570
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,674
On what grounds?

571
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,592
There is no evidence to connect the two.

572
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,679
- It's only a speculation. So far--
- Hold on.

573
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,514
I'd like to hear more.

574
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,983
If it's okay,

575
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:53,195
I'd like to take a look at the map
with the locations of the rape cases.

576
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:21,140
Please take a close look
at the locations and dates.

577
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,065
And…

578
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,985
FAIR AND EFFECTIVE INVESTIGATION

579
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:39,283
…these are the locations and dates
of the car thefts.

580
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,162
Moreover…

581
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,546
as you can see,
the locations and dates of the two cases

582
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,714
are nearly identical.

583
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,053
What's this?

584
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:12,066
Well, it's an interesting theory.

585
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:15,819
But circumstantial evidence isn't enough
to say the two culprits are the same.

586
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,988
We have DNA.

587
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,241
We collected cigarette butts at the scene.

588
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,329
Let's compare it
to the serial rapist's DNA.

589
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,387
What happens

590
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,347
if the two culprits are the same?

591
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,848
One shot, two kills.

592
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,935
Catching one will solve two cases.
It's good for both teams.

593
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,853
It's only good for them, isn't it?

594
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,897
It can't be good for us.

595
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,816
If it's the same person,

596
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,859
the joint investigation unit
will take our case.

597
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,737
We'll just hand over
all our investigation materials.

598
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,366
Let's talk after the results come out.

599
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:03,992
We'll just continue doing our job.

600
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,203
What's this?

601
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:09,248
I have a bad feeling
that they'll take credit for our work.

602
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,541
Haven't you felt it?

603
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,960
We always lose when
Director General Lee Taeju is involved.

604
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,003
That's why his nickname is Black Hole.

605
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,047
Everyone around him get sucked dry.

606
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,633
We bore the brunt of criticism
in the unlicensed taxi case.

607
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,635
- That's why Lieutenant--
- Hey.

608
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:28,976
Hey.

609
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:34,398
Why did Director General Lee
want to see you?

610
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:37,401
- It was nothing. Ma'am, some rice please.
- Okay.

611
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:40,779
Why? Did he set the stage
that he'd take the case?

612
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:47,244
Of course.
He should take it if he needs to.

613
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,497
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

614
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,877
Couldn't you have given me a heads-up?

615
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:02,384
Did you have to bring it up
without consulting with me first?

616
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,971
Oh, things happened so suddenly earlier.

617
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:08,557
I get that it's important to show results,

618
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:13,228
but you shouldn't dishearten
your teammates.

619
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:41,548
Talk to Lieutenant Min
and make up with her.

620
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,509
Lieutenant Min is a nice person,

621
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:46,470
but she doesn't look back
once she cuts someone off.

622
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,310
What was that about?

623
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:57,689
The unlicensed taxi case
involving Director General Lee Taeju.

624
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,901
Oh, that.

625
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,904
Have you heard of an unlicensed taxi?

626
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:07,157
Yes, it's a term
for illegal taxi services.

627
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,369
Entertainment businesses in Gangnam
usually operate them.

628
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:14,331
Last year, we confiscated
the work phone of a top dog boss.

629
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,542
It contained evidence of drug deals

630
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,877
and phone numbers
of high-ranking officials' children.

631
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:23,465
High-ranking police
officers' children were involved too.

632
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,427
Lee Taeju was a superintendent
at Namgang Police Station--

633
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:31,181
When the case got big,
Director General Lee Taeju took over.

634
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,101
- How did it end?
- It ended with

635
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,228
the arrest of 20 taxi drivers. That's all.

636
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:40,816
Director General Lee was promoted
to lead Major Crimes Division at HQ.

637
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,652
You understand the situation, right?

638
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:49,157
Lieutenant Min may seem easy-going,

639
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:54,246
but she loses her mind
when higher-ups mess with a case.

640
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,540
She visited the headquarters to complain

641
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:58,292
and got reprimanded.

642
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:02,212
That ended the relationship
between her and Director General Lee.

643
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:07,467
If it's someone's favor, I'll be indebted.

644
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,429
Then I'll be forced to do things
against my will.

645
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,141
I can't do that
since I have a bad personality.

646
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,277
You're saying that, in this position,
he shook your arm off

647
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,113
and ran away
after kicking your face, right?

648
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:31,283
- Yes.
- Ah, okay. Remember this.

649
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:33,869
When you handcuff a suspect from his back,

650
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,287
do this.

651
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,456
Immobilize the upper body…

652
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:40,000
- …like this, okay?
- Okay.

653
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,210
And let's say he shook off your arm.

654
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:45,088
Then attack the shoulder like this…

655
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:48,967
…or get down and do the triangle choke.

656
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,510
- Okay?
- Okay.

657
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,596
- Shall we take a break?
- Yes.

658
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,349
Okay.

659
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:10,614
Here.

660
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:28,507
I'm sorry.

661
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,178
You taught me the techniques,
but I failed to catch the culprit.

662
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,933
You're apologizing for the wrong thing.

663
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:42,479
I taught you these techniques

664
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,857
so that you can protect yourself.

665
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,944
You sustained many injuries in the past.

666
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:51,279
I see.

667
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,573
Catching the culprit comes next.

668
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,034
So don't get hurt from now on,

669
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,578
even if the culprit gets away.

670
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,919
Weren't you mad at me?

671
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:09,881
Because of what happened at the meeting.

672
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,049
Oh, that.

673
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,969
I mean, it's your first time.

674
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,596
No one does well on the first try.

675
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,059
What's this?

676
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,152
A LATE-NIGHT DRIVER
HITS NEWLYWEDS

677
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,070
RESULTING IN THEIR DEATH

678
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,160
THREE HIGH-SCHOOLERS STATED
THAT THEY WITNESSED THE SCENE…

679
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:23,080
We're still newlyweds.

680
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,386
Who went in my office while I was gone?

681
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,598
Who did it?

682
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,614
If you want to die, die alone.

683
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:00,450
We aren't going to die,
you punk. Don't get scared.

684
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:04,955
Your father must be very angry. Hmm?

685
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,751
Gee, that punk has some serious guts.

686
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:13,255
How did he think
to blackmail your father too?

687
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:15,048
Goodness.

688
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,229
The atmosphere is nice.

689
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:23,533
Han Fatty.

690
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,744
Look at him all surprised.

691
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,997
What are you looking at? Get out.

692
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,672
My goodness.

693
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:42,636
Han Fatty. Long time no see.

694
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,180
You damn pig.

695
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:47,891
Gosh, look at that belly.
You gained even more weight.

696
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,226
You entering a contest?

697
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,853
What are you guys doing here?

698
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:53,980
How did you know I was here?

699
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:57,359
Is that how you greet old friends
you haven't seen in a while?

700
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,527
Have you been well, Kyungsoo?

701
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:04,449
Hey. Don't you have anything to say to us?

702
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:07,535
Like what?

703
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:11,039
Han Fatty.

704
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,209
We know everything.

705
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,254
- You sent it, didn't you?
- Send what?

706
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:20,131
Gosh. Do you need money?

707
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:22,676
Then you should've said so.
We're your friends.

708
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,219
I don't understand.

709
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,265
What did I send you guys?

710
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,102
This.

711
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,857
- Didn't you send this?
- What is that?

712
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,032
A LATE-NIGHT DRIVER
HITS NEWLYWEDS

713
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:46,950
RESULTING IN THEIR DEATH

714
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,164
So, you guys think

715
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,667
that I sent this to you?

716
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,253
Wow,
you're an incredible actor.

717
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:01,673
Hey, you're the only one
who knows about it.

718
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,008
It wasn't me.

719
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,886
Why would I send this to you guys?
Why would I do that?

720
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,096
That's…

721
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:11,933
what the sender should answer.

722
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:15,770
It really wasn't me.

723
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,316
Why would I? Why would I send it?

724
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:22,110
Geez.

725
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,573
Hold on. What are you going to do?

726
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:27,949
Stay still.

727
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,368
- I mean…
- Damn it.

728
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:36,875
Geez.

729
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:05,195
Do you drink while driving?

730
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,616
Gosh. What a dangerous punk.

731
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,242
Like father, like son.

732
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:15,080
Hey. Your father was an alcoholic, right?

733
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,044
What are you looking at?

734
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:23,546
I'm just saying this because I'm worried.

735
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,094
Kyungsoo.

736
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,305
Let's watch what we say.

737
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:36,226
It's all in the past, right?

738
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,524
Gosh, that startled me.

739
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:47,404
Goodness. How dangerous, you punk.

740
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:54,661
I can't believe that jerk. Seriously.

741
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:56,996
Hey, Han Fatty.

742
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,250
Let's meet in Seoul. I'll buy you a drink.

743
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,627
Not soju, but something expensive.

744
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,129
Okay?

745
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,716
We'll get going then.

746
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,011
Hey.

747
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,099
I guess someone else knows

748
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,393
what you guys did back then.

749
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,733
She died because of you guys after all.

750
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,279
- What did you just say?
- It's true.

751
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,407
She could've survived
if it weren't for you guys.

752
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:37,036
Am I wrong, Jungwook?
Or was it your father's doing?

753
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:46,379
Hey, say that again.

754
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,841
I'm right. Because of your father--

755
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:19,787
Geez. It's not Kyungsoo?

756
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,167
Then who is it?

757
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:37,764
A LATE-NIGHT DRIVER

760
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,120

HOW CAN A MURDERER

CRASH

769
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:23,036
You saw a psychiatrist for a long time
after the accident.

770
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,455
It makes no sense
that someone like him is a cop.

771
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:28,207
They want Cha Yeonho expelled.
They want him fired.

772
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:31,294
The car burglar isn't the serial rapist?

773

How did the culprit find
the victims' personal information?

<i>- Why did you lie?</i>

Didn't you think that
your greed could result in another victim?
