1
00:00:00,999 --> 00:00:03,759
<i>There will be a war
in this family,</i>

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,399
<i>and one of you will die.</i>

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:07,999
Please be aware, Mr Shelby,
that the deaths of your people

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,039
<i>are your own responsibility.</i>

5
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:11,999
<i>Since my mother
passed away four years ago,</i>

6
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:13,399
<i>Tommy and I
haven't even spoken.</i>

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,639
I'm very much looking forward

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,759
to working with you again,
Michael.

9
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:19,079
That, my friend, is
the finest opium in the world.

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,079
Why would you sell?

11
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,719
<i>The Irish
are being difficult.</i>

12
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,079
The Italians are not an option.

13
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,999
- You're going to America?
- To Canada,

14
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,239
to collect payment
for the shipment.

15
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,639
Elizabeth,
you are a very lucky woman,

16
00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:30,799
to have each day what
I have only sampled once.

17
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:33,319
<i>Mr Shelby,
your daughter has consumption.</i>

18
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,479
She's gone, Tommy.
She's gone.

19
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:37,719
A daughter lost. A son found.

20
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:39,759
This is my son.
They call him Duke.

21
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:43,519
It is tuberculoma.
I am afraid it is inoperable.

22
00:00:43,639 --> 00:00:45,439
- How long?
- Perhaps 18 months.

23
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:48,039
My associates are going
to take care of Thomas Shelby.

24
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,959
<i>And you are going to give us
his brother.</i>

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,479
What are
Michael's real intentions

26
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:52,559
towards me, Gina?

27
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:54,439
And if you lie, I will know.

28
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,959
It is my intention
to kill Tommy Shelby.

29
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,119
<i>It was the ambitions
and strategies of one man</i>

30
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:26,319
<i>that caused this.</i>

31
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,879
<i>I will take revenge
on Tommy Shelby.</i>

32
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:03,599
Do you want a drink first
or a whore first?

33
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,759
I want to see my wife first.

34
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,439
After you've fucked your wife,

35
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:10,919
you're going to kill a man,
right?

36
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:59,639
The smoke
from your daughter's funeral

37
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,919
is still in your clothes. <i>..</i>

38
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:05,039
<i>..</i> .And you slept with someone.

39
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:09,319
Not just someone.

40
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,039
The enemy.

41
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:16,399
Every enemy we ever had
in one woman.

42
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,199
There are some things
that I do, Lizzie, that I <i>...</i>

43
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,039
You're not so good at lying
any more, Tommy.

44
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:27,599
These days,
the truth gets in your eyes.

45
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,319
I have to go to Canada, Lizzie.

46
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,159
I need to know
where you will go.

47
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:38,399
See? You just accept <i>it.</i>

48
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:41,519
You don'<i>t</i> fight <i>it.</i>

49
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,519
You are cursed, Tommy.

50
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,159
Never to understand the limits
that other people will accept.

51
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:57,199
Never to be allowed in
where everybody else is.

52
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,519
A curse never to be lifted.

53
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,359
I will be away, Lizzie.

54
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,599
And while I'm gone,
I know a place where. <i>..</i>

55
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,319
Always gone, always away.

56
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,439
Well, now your rings are gone,

57
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,719
your rings are <i>away.</i>

58
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,239
I'm already packed.

59
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:29,519
Now leave me
to say goodbye to Ruby.

60
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,119
I have to go away for a bit,
Charlie.

61
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,559
Look at me.

62
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,559
Hey. Look at me.

63
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:03,239
Mum already told me
she's leaving...

64
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:06,119
<i>..</i> .and she told me <i>why.</i>

65
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:19,439
Mum, where are you going?

66
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:24,559
A hotel.

67
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:27,519
And then your father
will get me a house.

68
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,839
Mum, I'll come with you.

69
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,559
I'd rather be with you.

70
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,719
Wherever it is.

71
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,519
You're not my mum. <i>..</i>

72
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,879
<i>...but</i> you're more my mum
than he's my dad.

73
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:50,519
He's never here.

74
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,599
I'd be on my own here.

75
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:57,399
Oh, Charles, love...

76
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:01,719
<i>...</i> I don'<i>t</i> think your father
would allow <i>that.</i>

77
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,559
You can go.

78
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:09,359
You can go, son.

79
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,519
I know a good place.

80
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,119
Lizzie,
I'll arrange that place.

81
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,879
And, Charlie,
you can take him, eh?

82
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,679
They have stables
at this new place.

83
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,959
After a while,
he'll...he'll listen to you.

84
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,159
He'll forget about Ruby.

85
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,839
That's how horses are.

86
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,919
And you'll be here all alone.

87
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,519
I'm buying land, Lizzie.
I'm buying up land.

88
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,359
This place I've bought

89
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,359
I was going to knock down,
but you can go there.

90
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:42,639
Dad...

91
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,719
<i>..</i> .where will you go?

92
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,679
This is
the Peaky Blinders' armoury.

93
00:06:57,799 --> 00:07:00,279
We have
a very good relationship

94
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,719
with the BSA factory
in Armoury Road.

95
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:09,159
Two dozen machine guns,
half a dozen sub-machine guns,

96
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,959
BSA sniper rifles,
three boxes of hand grenades.

97
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,119
For what purpose?

98
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:19,919
For eventualities like
the one that is about to occur.

99
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,639
When men come to us
with bad intentions,

100
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,599
the family come together.

101
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:27,879
Tommy says it's time
you join the family.

102
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,479
But you're not just going to be
a soldier.

103
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,479
You're going to be a general...

104
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:36,319
...some day.

105
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,199
So, I need to ask you
some questions.

106
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,119
What have you ever fired?

107
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,879
Shotgun.

108
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,719
Pistol.

109
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,999
22.

110
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:06,119
What have you ever killed?

111
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:09,319
Few rabbits.

112
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,439
Pheasant, partridge. A stag.

113
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:15,399
Arthur tells me

114
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,799
when they were taking care
of some business

115
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,399
at the betting shop,

116
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,279
you ran away.

117
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:22,599
It was unfair.

118
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:27,679
Fairness is not
a soldier's concern.

119
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:29,919
You do what you do.

120
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,639
I already have done.

121
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,919
Fair and square.

122
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:38,879
I have killed a man.

123
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:42,399
Tommy's always right.

124
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,439
We were outside
a hospital in Bridgnorth.

125
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:53,439
In the Black Country.

126
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,839
My mother was dying.

127
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:59,799
And the orderly
wouldn'<i>t</i> give her a bed

128
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:02,799
cos she was a Gypsy -
she had no insurance.

129
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:07,159
She never saw the sunrise.

130
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,319
Nor did that man
who denied her.

131
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:18,679
Just one more thing
we need to know about you.

132
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,399
Can you keep a secret?

133
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,039
I know, brother.

134
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,759
I know.

135
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,519
I know.

136
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,679
I stole your keys.

137
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:59,039
Tuberculoma.

138
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,599
In your brain.

139
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:06,279
Yeah.

140
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,279
But I still have time
to do what I need to do.

141
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,959
Fuck you, Tommy.

142
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,639
I don'<i>t</i> need anyone to know,
Arthur.

143
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,759
No, you don't, do you?

144
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,919
You don't need anything,
do you?

145
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,359
No, I don't need anything.

146
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:25,479
I don't need anything.

147
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:28,119
How long have we been dead for,
eh?

148
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:30,079
You and me, how long?

149
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:31,959
At least now
I'll have a certificate.

150
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,599
Wherever it is,

151
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:36,999
I'll get the drinks in
and I'll wait for you.

152
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,159
- Fuck's sake.
- Yeah.

153
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,559
All them bullets that missed.

154
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,039
It's funny, Arthur.

155
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:51,039
It's funny is what it is.

156
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,719
So don'<i>t</i> you fucking weep.

157
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,279
Weep!

158
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:03,319
When everyone
is taken care of financially,

159
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:05,239
I will take myself <i>away.</i>
On my own.

160
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,279
I don'<i>t want</i> anyone. <i>..</i>

161
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,839
<i>..</i> .Anyone who may
or may not. <i>..</i>

162
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:17,399
...love me...

163
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,439
<i>...to</i> have to see me crawl. <i>..</i>

164
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,439
...or grow insane and helpless.

165
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,719
It would be a cruelty to me
and to them.

166
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:34,679
By the time people know
the truth, I will be gone.

167
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,159
What about Lizzie?

168
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,079
I have some papers
I need you to sign

169
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:42,479
on behalf of the company.

170
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:44,919
Told Lizzie?

171
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:47,799
I'm working
with the housing minister.

172
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,799
I will be allocating contracts,

173
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:52,279
construction contracts
worth £10 million.

174
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,119
You haven'<i>t</i> told Lizzie?

175
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,959
Some of the contracts
I will be allocating

176
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,599
are with companies
in which we have an interest.

177
00:11:57,719 --> 00:12:00,479
Fuck you and your contracts!

178
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:02,639
So the Shelby Company Limited
will continue

179
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,079
to earn money.

180
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:07,759
But mostly, Arthur, I'm doing
it because it's a good thing.

181
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,079
- Building houses.
- Oh...

182
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:12,799
Yeah, for ordinary
working people...

183
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,559
Oh, yeah, good for you.
Fuckin'...

184
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:17,439
<i>..</i> .in the interests
of a fairer future.

185
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:21,879
And before that,
I will be going to Canada

186
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:24,679
to collect payment
for the shipment - £5 million!

187
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,479
Oh, five fucking million?

188
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:29,959
Which I will share
among the Shelby family.

189
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,679
And that will be my legacy.

190
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,999
Instead of me,
there will be money.

191
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,239
Because for most
of the people

192
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:40,479
who are close to me,
that is what I am!

193
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:43,199
Fucking money.
That is my agency.

194
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:45,439
Is that all you think you are,
eh?

195
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,599
Hmm?

196
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:49,439
Stand up.

197
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:54,479
You heard me.

198
00:12:55,599 --> 00:12:56,639
Stand up.

199
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,759
On your feet.

200
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,599
- On your fucking feet.
- Arthur...

201
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:03,999
On your feet, soldier.
On your feet.

202
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:05,799
Stand the fuck up! Come here.

203
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:10,319
No!

204
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:12,479
No.

205
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,919
You hear me?

206
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,039
Enough.

207
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,639
Enough!

208
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,239
Now you know.

209
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,199
You tell no-one else...

210
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:34,999
...until I am gone.

211
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:36,679
Until you're gone, yeah?

212
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,599
When the time comes,
I'll call you.

213
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,079
I'll tell you where.
It'll be a wagon.

214
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,599
Fuck your wagon!

215
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:53,039
You light the flame.

216
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:56,719
You bring Charlie and Curly
and no-one else.

217
00:13:57,999 --> 00:13:59,599
Get drunk.

218
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:01,559
Rake the ashes
for silver and gold.

219
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,319
Fuck you!

220
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,199
And your fucking plans!

221
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,799
That time,
I did let you fucking win.

222
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:32,759
John...

223
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,239
Fuckin' you, John.

224
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:43,999
Fuckin' both of you.

225
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:46,799
Arthur...

226
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:49,239
Arthur.

227
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:52,399
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

228
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,679
Come here.

229
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,239
Come here.

230
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,199
Come here.

231
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:00,639
Let me see your eyes.

232
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:03,399
I'm clean, man.

233
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,079
The dragon's fucking gone.

234
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:09,999
Thanks to you. Fucking. <i>..</i>
Fucking thanks to you.

235
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:38,519
You all right?

236
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,919
Come on.

237
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,239
Fucking...

238
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,159
Hey, I'm still fucking here.

239
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:45,719
Pull yourself together,
come on.

240
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,039
We have work to do.

241
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,159
Come on!

242
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:16,839
You're sure you want Billy?
I had to shut up the shop.

243
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,519
Yes. We want Billy.

244
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:21,359
Sit down, Billy.

245
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,799
Thank you for inviting me,
Mr Shelby.

246
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:32,639
Good to see you again, Billy.

247
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:43,399
No. Mary says
not until after six o'clock.

248
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:51,999
He said to tell his father
he feels OK about <i>it.</i>

249
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:54,879
Good. Shut the door, Duke.

250
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,519
Now, we are all gathered. <i>..</i>

251
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:08,959
...and those...

252
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:17,799
Apologies, Mr Shelby,
I still don'<i>t</i> speak the lingo.

253
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:21,879
Well, Finn here never even
bothered to learn <i>it.</i>

254
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,199
I heard "tachipen".

255
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:25,159
Truth.

256
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,879
You said something
about the truth.

257
00:17:26,999 --> 00:17:29,879
Truth. The truth is. <i>..</i>

258
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:31,519
...I called men here
that I can trust. <i>..</i>

259
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:34,519
...because
I will be going <i>away.</i>

260
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:39,119
I have to collect payment
for a shipment of goods

261
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:41,079
which left Liverpool
ten days ago.

262
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:42,999
Payment from who?

263
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:45,559
South Boston Irish, Finn.

264
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:47,839
Bootleggers.

265
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,679
Are you going alone?

266
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:55,399
Johnny Dogs has already sailed
for Canada.

267
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,719
Michael will be there.

268
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,239
Michael is family.

269
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,839
Michael will be my guarantee
of safety.

270
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:06,199
But while I'm away,
I have a job for you all.

271
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,719
I need you
to go to Arrow House.

272
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,359
I will be leaving Arrow House
for good.

273
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:13,479
And there are things
that need removing.

274
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:15,599
I need men that I can trust.

275
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,079
There is cash,
there are valuables.

276
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:19,959
There is information
about important people

277
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,999
that has more value than gold.

278
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:27,039
There are also bodies buried
in the grounds

279
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:28,519
which need digging up

280
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:30,479
before the contractors
start moving earth.

281
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:32,839
Isiah, you will be in charge.

282
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,279
In Arrow House,
there is a wine cellar.

283
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:38,279
In that wine cellar,
there are fine French wines

284
00:18:38,399 --> 00:18:41,079
that are worth more than
a man's life.

285
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:44,199
You are welcome to them, boys,
it'll be like a...

286
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,839
<i>..</i> .be like a farewell party.

287
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:49,199
Are you ready for the party,
son?

288
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,959
Tachipen.

289
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:57,639
The fucking truth again.

290
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:00,399
What truth?

291
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,039
You'll need shovels,
you'll need boxes,

292
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:04,319
and you'll take the bones
to Mr Patches

293
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:06,959
to put in the furnace
at Greenham's.

294
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,999
Got it?

295
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,839
Right. Any questions?

296
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:13,399
Yeah. If it's a party,
can we bring girls?

297
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:16,039
No, Billy.

298
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:17,759
All the fun will be laid on
for you.

299
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:21,839
So, when is the party, Tom?

300
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,479
Mr Shelby.

301
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,879
Party's next Sunday, Billy.

302
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,479
You mean this Sunday?

303
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:37,319
Yeah.

304
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:40,439
And while you're
digging fucking holes,

305
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,399
I'll be here drinking
champagne with my wife.

306
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:45,559
It's our wedding anniversary.

307
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,799
Right.

308
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,079
Oh, and Finn,

309
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:49,799
by the way,

310
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,439
please explain to, erm,
what's her name?

311
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,839
- Mary.
- Mary?

312
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,319
- Yes.
- Is it Mary?

313
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:59,999
Please explain to Mary
that you are a Shelby.

314
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,759
It says it here
on the back of your watch.

315
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:03,759
Have a look - Shelby.

316
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:04,919
Look.

317
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,119
This means you own the watch,

318
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:09,959
the watch doesn'<i>t</i> own you.

319
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,039
The clock strikes six
when you fucking tell it <i>to.</i>

320
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:14,719
Have a whiskey.

321
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:17,919
Enjoy the party, boys.

322
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:25,943
http://hiqve.com/

323
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:35,759
Want a drink, baby?

324
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:37,119
No.

325
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:39,439
Drinking water like Tommy, huh?

326
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:44,119
Until this thing is done,
I need a clear head.

327
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,279
Leave it.

328
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,279
Yeah?

329
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:12,999
Good.

330
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,079
That's good.

331
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:18,399
Look, I've got to go.

332
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:22,239
Good news, Michael.

333
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,439
Listen.

334
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:27,959
That was our informant
in Birmingham.

335
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:31,959
The Shelby men will
all be together on Sunday.

336
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,839
But Arthur will be having
dinner with his wife

337
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:36,839
at the bar
of the Garrison Tavern.

338
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:44,159
As I recall,

339
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:46,359
the Shelby table is right next
to the windows, correct?

340
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:48,119
Every table's a Shelby table.

341
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:49,599
Yes, but...

342
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:54,159
<i>..</i> .maybe our people could just
drive by and...

343
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,519
...shoot Arthur
through the glass

344
00:21:55,639 --> 00:21:57,319
without even getting
out of the car.

345
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:01,439
Michael...

346
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:04,959
<i>...we</i>'ve talked about this -
there's no other choice.

347
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:07,599
This business is between me
and Tommy.

348
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:11,159
Yes, and when you kill Tommy,

349
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:13,079
Arthur will come after you.

350
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:15,839
He has to die, too.

351
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,799
If Arthur's in a bar,
he'll be drunk.

352
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:23,559
Or worse.

353
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,559
At least he'll die
without pain.

354
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,119
Who'll do the killing?

355
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:39,919
Tommy's working
with a faction of the IRA.

356
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:42,119
Connor has connections.

357
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:43,559
They made a deal.

358
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:48,239
A favour in return for guns.

359
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:51,239
But, Michael...

360
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,079
<i>..</i> .whilst the assassin's
in this <i>city...</i>

361
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:58,039
...Tommy has a son.

362
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:00,119
He's a kid.

363
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:01,599
Kids grow up.

364
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:05,559
We don'<i>t</i> kill women
and we don'<i>t</i> kill kids.

365
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:09,919
The informant also mentioned
a new boy named Duke.

366
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:11,639
Do you want
a fucking bloodbath, Gina?

367
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,519
I know about the new boy.

368
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,319
I've decided that
the illegitimate son

369
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,399
is not a threat. My decision.

370
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:24,439
Only Arthur.

371
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:27,799
Michael, baby...

372
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:30,519
...everything's been agreed.

373
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:36,119
Everybody wants
the same things.

374
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:42,799
How many men do you think
they killed with bullets

375
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:44,479
and blades?

376
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:47,719
That's how Tommy became king.

377
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,639
And in three days' time...

378
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:54,639
<i>...that</i>'s how
you will become king.

379
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:59,959
Deep down, Arthur and Tommy
want to be dead <i>anyway.</i>

380
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:03,479
On Sunday, we'll just. <i>..</i>

381
00:24:06,439 --> 00:24:07,999
<i>..</i> .Give them what they <i>want.</i>

382
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:37,719
Oswald was called <i>away.</i>
He sent me instead.

383
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:42,079
Actually, that's not true.

384
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:44,319
I sent Oswald away
and elected myself

385
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:45,839
to be his representative.

386
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:48,719
What was it you wanted?

387
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,159
I'm planning on bringing
my housing bill

388
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:53,879
before Parliament.

389
00:24:53,999 --> 00:24:55,919
You'll need to start drawing up
a list

390
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,719
of all your land-owning
families with gambling debts,

391
00:24:58,839 --> 00:24:59,959
drug addictions,

392
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:02,079
any other drain
on their resources.

393
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:05,079
I will deliver offers to buy
the surplus land

394
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,879
using Treasury bonds.

395
00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:08,639
Thomas, <i>why</i> don'<i>t we</i> fuck here,

396
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,159
on these benches?

397
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:12,599
Right now.

398
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:16,359
We wouldn'<i>t</i> be the first.

399
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:20,039
I hear your wife left you.

400
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:29,959
Over the last few months,

401
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:32,839
I've had some associates
of mine...

402
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:36,439
...break into
some of your pals' houses.

403
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,079
They stole paperwork.

404
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:41,079
Letters, bills,
bank statements. <i>..</i>

405
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:43,199
Are you not upset?

406
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:50,439
This is a list
of all land-owning families

407
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,079
facing foreclosure.

408
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:59,319
And to answer your question...

409
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:03,919
...no.

410
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:08,919
No, I'm not upset that
my wife left me.

411
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:13,759
And, yeah,
if you want to fuck, I'll fuck.

412
00:26:13,879 --> 00:26:15,439
But you'll have
to cross the floor

413
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:17,999
cos I refuse to fuck
on Tory benches.

414
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:35,119
Mr Shelby...

415
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:39,679
<i>...</i> I was going to have
this delivered to you,

416
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,359
but I decided to bring it
in person.

417
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:48,319
It's an invitation
to mine and Diana's wedding.

418
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,519
It's in Berlin.

419
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,119
We are going to get married

420
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:54,959
in the presence
of the Führer himself.

421
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,279
Were you having fun?

422
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:04,719
Making paper aeroplanes.

423
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,639
I'm afraid, er...

424
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,719
...I have business.
I will be in Canada.

425
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:14,639
<i>Pity.</i>

426
00:27:19,719 --> 00:27:21,159
Oh, and, er...

427
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:25,799
<i>...the</i> other reason I wanted
to bring this in person

428
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,479
was to tell you that,
after our wedding,

429
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:29,439
you must understand,
Mr Shelby...

430
00:27:30,879 --> 00:27:34,039
<i>...that</i> if you so much as look
in my wife's direction,

431
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,839
I will have you killed.

432
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:40,919
Come, Diana.

433
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:45,199
Just think. <i>..</i>

434
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:49,519
...very soon, crumbling
old institutions like this one

435
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:50,839
will be swept away

436
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:53,039
and become a thing
of ancient memory.

437
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,319
Fly safe.

438
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:06,199
Be careful with this baby.

439
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:11,799
You see any potholes,
you drive round them.

440
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:33,159
Mr Shelby called to say
to expect you.

441
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,319
Yeah, we've come to do
a bit of gardening.

442
00:29:36,439 --> 00:29:37,519
We are hearing so many rumours

443
00:29:37,639 --> 00:29:39,079
about what is happening
to the house.

444
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:42,999
Tommy says your second best
quality after your baking is,

445
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,679
you don'<i>t</i> ask questions.

446
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:50,799
Get everybody away from
the house until Monday.

447
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,919
OK, let's find
these bottles of wine

448
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,639
worth more than a man's life.

449
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,879
There's only one guest here.

450
00:30:52,999 --> 00:30:54,479
The rest of the rooms are free

451
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,559
if you want to use them
while you <i>wait.</i>

452
00:30:56,679 --> 00:30:59,639
Our friend will be here
by the time it gets dark.

453
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,679
There was a storm last night.

454
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:04,999
Last of a hurricane.
Boats all came in.

455
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,839
He's not coming by boat,
he's coming by plane.

456
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:13,079
Then your friend is dead.

457
00:31:13,199 --> 00:31:16,399
Wind was like...

458
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:18,599
Maybe God's done your job
for you, Mickey.

459
00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:20,439
My name is not fucking Mickey,

460
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,079
there is no fucking God,
and Tommy will be here.

461
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,759
Another one.

462
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:42,039
<i>There will be a war...</i>

463
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:45,199
<i>...and one of you will die.</i>

464
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:48,479
Which one I cannot tell.

465
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:50,439
<i>You're a brave man, Mr Shelby.</i>

466
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:52,799
<i>Where the fuck were you?</i>

467
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:56,319
<i>She's gone Tommy.
She's gone.</i>

468
00:31:56,439 --> 00:31:59,439
<i>The devils who did this
will pay, Ruby.</i>

469
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:02,479
<i>Tuberculoma.
I am afraid it is inoperable.</i>

470
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,559
<i>How long?</i>

471
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,119
<i>Perhaps 18 months.</i>

472
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:09,559
<i>I will change.
And change for good.</i>

473
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,759
<i>What is this good
that you have become?</i>

474
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:13,439
<i>Kill...</i>

475
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,039
...and kill.

476
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:49,719
What's going on?

477
00:32:54,479 --> 00:32:55,599
What the fuck is this?

478
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:57,719
I thought it was meant to be
a fucking party, lads.

479
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,159
It is now you're here.

480
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,999
Where's the...
Where's the fucking booze?

481
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,759
In the kitchen.

482
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:05,039
All the booze
is in the kitchen.

483
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:06,279
All right.

484
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:23,359
God gives a man wealth,
possessions and honour,

485
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:25,919
but God steps in and says,

486
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:29,119
"No, this is grievous,
mindless evil! "

487
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:31,559
Where is he, Jeremiah?

488
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,799
In heaven, looking down.

489
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:40,479
God tells us
that blood is given to him

490
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:41,759
from us.

491
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:44,759
Why don'<i>t</i> you turn
the fucking lights on, eh?

492
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:46,759
Well, there's no longer
any power

493
00:33:46,879 --> 00:33:48,399
in the house of Thomas Shelby.

494
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:50,599
Why not?
What do you mean?

495
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:51,799
What happened?

496
00:33:52,879 --> 00:33:54,479
I thought there were
gonna be girls here.

497
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,519
Who need girls

498
00:33:55,639 --> 00:33:57,119
when you're in a house
bound for hell?

499
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:58,559
Fuck d'ya mean?

500
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:02,599
Hey. What the fuck do you mean?

501
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:14,519
Fuck!

502
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,999
Fuck!

503
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:18,559
We can do whatever we want
in this house.

504
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,359
It's got a death sentence.

505
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,559
I don'<i>t want</i> a drink.

506
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,879
I want to go dig up
those fucking bodies, yeah?

507
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:31,559
- Billy?
- Yeah?

508
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,439
Got to wait until
all the bodies are buried

509
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:35,279
before you start digging them
back up.

510
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:38,359
What the fuck does that mean?

511
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,759
I'm a fucking Shelby.

512
00:34:43,439 --> 00:34:44,599
So am I.

513
00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:08,079
He's here.

514
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:53,039
Step back and give me
a bit of light there, boys.

515
00:36:52,399 --> 00:36:54,679
Charge is set to blow
in 30 minutes.

516
00:36:54,799 --> 00:36:56,759
That's at exactly 16.20.

517
00:36:56,879 --> 00:36:57,919
Everybody got that?

518
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:03,599
I'll do it.

519
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:07,279
This is between me and Tommy.

520
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:09,079
I'll do it with my own hand.

521
00:37:10,999 --> 00:37:12,319
I'll come with you.

522
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:20,239
Yeah, don'<i>t</i> slam any doors.

523
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:36,359
Easy.

524
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,679
It's just a pity
you didn'<i>t</i> have the guts

525
00:37:43,799 --> 00:37:45,799
to shoot him face to face.

526
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:49,679
My mother was a Gypsy.
She saw the future.

527
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:52,839
She always said
it won'<i>t</i> be a bullet

528
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:54,319
that'll kill Tommy Shelby.

529
00:37:58,959 --> 00:38:01,519
Hey, lads.

530
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:03,319
Over by the bridge.

531
00:38:03,439 --> 00:38:05,639
Big, big fish.

532
00:38:05,759 --> 00:38:07,679
Poisson. Grande.

533
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:09,239
Go on.

534
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:15,279
Take the gun, Finn.

535
00:38:17,959 --> 00:38:20,119
Arthur says if you don't do it,

536
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:22,279
then you can walk away
from this family for good.

537
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:24,559
What the fuck do <i>you</i> know
about family?

538
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,679
You're not family.

539
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:30,119
You're the son
of a fucking whore!

540
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:35,119
Just take the gun and do it,
Finn.

541
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:37,559
Take the fucking gun.

542
00:38:46,279 --> 00:38:48,679
Now you have the gun, Finn,

543
00:38:48,799 --> 00:38:50,039
you have the gun.

544
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:51,679
Use it on these fucks!

545
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:04,559
Argh!

546
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:09,959
Charlie Strong told me,

547
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,559
"When you give Finn the gun,

548
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:13,439
"make sure the first <i>two</i>
chambers are empty."

549
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:16,919
Good old Uncle Charlie.

550
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:41,439
You are no longer a member
of this Shelby family.

551
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:46,839
By order of
the Peaky fucking Blinders.

552
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:49,959
I will come for you.

553
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,159
I will fucking come for you!

554
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:42,799
<i>..</i> .That find me faulting them

555
00:40:42,919 --> 00:40:46,439
who govern like dogs
in Garrison Lane.

556
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:48,959
Hear this, then came
Jesus forth

557
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,159
wearing the crown of thorns

558
00:40:51,279 --> 00:40:52,839
and the purple robe,

559
00:40:52,959 --> 00:40:56,519
and Pilate said,
"Behold the man,

560
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:57,879
"he is the man."

561
00:40:57,999 --> 00:41:00,559
Not the Peaky Blinders,

562
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:04,519
we see them in the automobiles,
with their whores and their. <i>..</i>

563
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:13,959
Hmm.

564
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:24,679
Order your man to drop <i>it.</i>

565
00:42:24,799 --> 00:42:27,079
Order him.

566
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,679
Empty the fucking gun.
Tell him.

567
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,519
You all right, Charlie?

568
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,079
All good here, Arthur.

569
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:41,199
Let's move.

570
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:45,199
Take you out to the street
cos I don'<i>t</i> wanna spoil my pub.

571
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:58,039
You'd shoot us like dogs?

572
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:02,079
No. I don'<i>t</i> shoot dogs.
I shoot fucking fascists. Move.

573
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:57,319
Fuck! Fuck!

574
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:06,599
Fuck!

575
00:46:19,959 --> 00:46:21,359
Oh, Lord!

576
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:26,359
Time for the chosen one
to reveal himself.

577
00:47:02,959 --> 00:47:05,799
Kids, no, come here.

578
00:47:05,919 --> 00:47:07,079
I said, come here!

579
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,239
What have I told you
about running off?

580
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,439
Don'<i>t</i> pick up things. Don'<i>t.</i>

581
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:13,839
Come here, come on.

582
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,079
Emily! Emily, come on.

583
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:24,479
If you get lost in the fog,

584
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,279
the Peaky Blinders
will get you.

585
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,439
Jeremiah.

586
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,759
Let's charm the old keepsake
from Passchendaele.

587
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,559
Fuck!

588
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,199
Fuck!

589
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:09,919
Come here.

590
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:12,679
Shh... Shh...

591
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,359
Breathe. Breathe.

592
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,039
Her name was Elizabeth Gray.

593
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:30,439
She was my Aunt Polly.

594
00:49:32,279 --> 00:49:33,719
My Aunt Polly.

595
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:38,279
Vengeance is for the...

596
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:45,919
Not in Small Heath,
it ain'<i>t.</i>

597
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:51,799
Rest in peace, Pol.

598
00:50:24,919 --> 00:50:27,079
Leave us, Uncle Charlie.

599
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,559
We're still in France.

600
00:51:10,839 --> 00:51:12,319
OK.

601
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,439
I see him
coming out of the fog.

602
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:37,759
How was the flight?

603
00:51:38,959 --> 00:51:42,039
They say it's the future,
I'm not so sure.

604
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:43,599
Whiskey.

605
00:51:45,879 --> 00:51:47,999
Hello, Michael.

606
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,519
Tommy.

607
00:51:59,879 --> 00:52:01,319
Give me another.

608
00:52:04,519 --> 00:52:05,439
We want you to take us

609
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:07,319
to where the opium
is being stored.

610
00:52:08,799 --> 00:52:11,319
And then we will provide you
with a banker's draft

611
00:52:11,439 --> 00:52:13,039
for the full amount.

612
00:52:14,439 --> 00:52:15,519
$5 million.

613
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:18,919
$5 million.

614
00:52:19,959 --> 00:52:20,959
Let's go.

615
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:30,399
I'll go with Tommy.

616
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:31,919
You boys follow behind.

617
00:52:37,879 --> 00:52:42,199
Ah, shit. Forgot my cigarettes.

618
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:36,519
Mum...

619
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:40,879
...it's done.

620
00:54:43,639 --> 00:54:45,159
It's over.

621
00:54:47,759 --> 00:54:49,439
And may God forgive me.

622
00:55:23,479 --> 00:55:27,239
Johnny! Johnny, where are you?

623
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:31,599
I switched the ticker
like you said, Tom.

624
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,239
Tell me I've done
a good thing here, Tom.

625
00:55:49,439 --> 00:55:51,199
Goodbye, Michael.

626
00:55:51,319 --> 00:55:52,719
Goodbye, Johnny.

627
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,559
You're a good man.

628
00:55:59,919 --> 00:56:03,719
I'm gonna go look at the fog,
Tom.

629
00:56:09,479 --> 00:56:11,159
Speak to me.

630
00:56:12,879 --> 00:56:14,239
Speak to me, Michael.

631
00:56:17,799 --> 00:56:18,999
You killed her.

632
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:20,519
Polly made her own choices,

633
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:21,799
- Michael.
- No...

634
00:56:22,959 --> 00:56:24,239
No-one close to you

635
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:26,559
makes a choice
without your opinion, Tom.

636
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:30,159
Not Arthur,

637
00:56:30,279 --> 00:56:33,239
not me, not Ada.

638
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:37,839
We can'<i>t</i> escape you.

639
00:56:39,999 --> 00:56:42,519
Your lethal hand is always
on our shoulders.

640
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:48,759
Polly was half of me.

641
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:52,079
Still visits me in my dreams.

642
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:56,079
She'll visit me no more.

643
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:11,439
I have no limitations.

644
00:58:16,999 --> 00:58:19,839
I smell the smell
of roasting Irishmen.

645
00:58:19,959 --> 00:58:22,039
Oh, yes, hello.

646
00:58:23,279 --> 00:58:25,359
I also smell
the smell of tobacco,

647
00:58:25,479 --> 00:58:27,039
which is forbidden
in my presence

648
00:58:27,159 --> 00:58:28,319
for all except for one -

649
00:58:28,439 --> 00:58:30,399
my new wife, Edna.

650
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:34,799
With the Irish being rendered
to smoke and fat,

651
00:58:34,919 --> 00:58:37,959
I now own half of Boston, so. <i>..</i>

652
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:42,519
<i>...out</i> of respect
for my restored authority. <i>..</i>

653
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:46,719
<i>...put</i> the fucking cigarette
out now, Tommy.

654
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:50,279
Hello, Alfie.

655
00:58:50,399 --> 00:58:51,799
I heard it was a good wedding.

656
00:58:51,919 --> 00:58:53,999
Yeah, it was, actually.
Thank you.

657
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:56,479
Edna's from a family circus.

658
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:59,119
So, after the ketubah
and the old swapping of rings

659
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:03,279
and the smashing of glass,
we left aboard elephants!

660
00:59:03,399 --> 00:59:04,719
Yeah, it was quite a thing.

661
00:59:04,839 --> 00:59:06,959
They had to shut down
Camden High Street,

662
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:09,239
and even the Gentile
what normally fucking hate me,

663
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:11,119
they waved with their hankies.

664
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,399
Justice.

665
00:59:16,399 --> 00:59:20,679
And housekeeping. Long overdue.

666
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:22,719
Yeah, look at
that little cunt ascending,

667
00:59:22,839 --> 00:59:25,199
he's ascending to the heavens!

668
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:27,639
Right in front of us.
Before our very eyes.

669
00:59:27,759 --> 00:59:29,839
I can see with this eye.
I'm not blind.

670
00:59:29,959 --> 00:59:32,119
This eye is the eye
of a dead man.

671
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:33,799
Dead men can see through life

672
00:59:33,919 --> 00:59:35,719
like it was a curtain
that billows

673
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,439
with the flicker of truth
upon it.

674
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:39,719
And I can see with this eye,
Tommy,

675
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:43,039
that your nephew is ascending,
and he will be forgiven.

676
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:45,599
Unlike you,

677
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:47,839
who, on Judgment Day,

678
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,719
is probably truly fucked

679
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:51,799
when the other shoe drops.

680
00:59:51,919 --> 00:59:53,319
Hmm?

681
00:59:56,999 --> 00:59:58,599
All right, Tommy?
How are you keeping?

682
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:02,199
You know, Alfie...

683
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:06,559
...so many people,

684
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:08,719
so many times

685
01:00:08,839 --> 01:00:10,559
going to so much trouble
to kill me.

686
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:13,319
I'm fucking dying <i>anyway.</i>

687
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:15,239
We're all dying <i>anyway.</i>

688
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,519
No.

689
01:00:17,639 --> 01:00:20,679
Not a bullet, not a bomb,

690
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:22,679
not a knife.

691
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:24,959
Is it clap? Is it clap?

692
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:27,759
No, not even that noble.

693
01:00:28,879 --> 01:00:29,839
What are you trying to say?

694
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,999
I'm about to sign over
half of fucking Camden Town

695
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,239
to you as part of this deal.

696
01:00:34,359 --> 01:00:38,239
Are you saying you're
just gonna die in your bed?

697
01:00:38,359 --> 01:00:41,159
I'm not gonna die in bed,
Alfie. Who fucking dies in bed?

698
01:00:41,279 --> 01:00:43,959
Good people die in their bed,
Tommy. Good people.

699
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:45,519
- Good people, eh?
- Hmm.

700
01:00:46,919 --> 01:00:48,519
Good people.

701
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:50,399
And yet here we are, Alfie.

702
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:53,759
After all this time,
just you and me.

703
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,079
And I crossed the line.

704
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:02,919
Michael.

705
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:06,479
Polly.

706
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:10,479
Ruby.

707
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:18,759
Tommy, if you are about
to express profound emotion,

708
01:01:18,879 --> 01:01:21,039
you might be better served
expressing it

709
01:01:21,159 --> 01:01:23,679
to someone
who gives a fuck

710
01:01:23,799 --> 01:01:26,919
or perhaps to somebody
who is being paid

711
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:28,879
to pretend to have <i>to.</i>

712
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:33,159
Like a fucking nurse.
Or a priest! Someone.

713
01:01:35,479 --> 01:01:37,639
And as for death,

714
01:01:37,759 --> 01:01:40,079
speaking as someone
who has been dead

715
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:42,319
for a number of years,

716
01:01:42,439 --> 01:01:44,359
I can only
heartily recommend <i>it.</i>

717
01:01:45,879 --> 01:01:50,239
Well, Alfie,
your opera is complete.

718
01:01:56,959 --> 01:02:00,239
Shall we go
and witness the final act?

719
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:47,479
Whenever you're ready, boys.

720
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:32,199
That's enough.

721
01:03:33,959 --> 01:03:35,119
Thank you all for coming.

722
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:39,079
Well, at least I can say that,
er...

723
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:42,399
...I am one of those
rare politicians

724
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:44,199
who actually makes good
on his promises.

725
01:03:46,599 --> 01:03:48,359
Country estate -

726
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:52,679
requisitioned to make <i>way</i>
for houses for working people.

727
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:55,839
I improved my own home
with good intentions

728
01:03:55,959 --> 01:03:58,519
and 1,500lb of dynamite.

729
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:04,999
Now I'm back where we began. <i>..</i>

730
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:08,359
<i>...with</i> horses and caravans. <i>..</i>

731
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:12,759
...vagabonds and thieves.

732
01:04:16,279 --> 01:04:18,359
Frances, sit down, please.

733
01:04:27,799 --> 01:04:29,239
I'd like to raise a toast.

734
01:04:30,919 --> 01:04:32,159
A simple toast.

735
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:36,879
To family.

736
01:04:36,999 --> 01:04:38,599
- To family.
- To family.

737
01:04:38,719 --> 01:04:42,919
Sometimes it is shelter
from the storm.

738
01:04:44,679 --> 01:04:46,559
Sometimes it is
the storm itself.

739
01:04:57,919 --> 01:05:00,279
I'm planning on going away
for a bit.

740
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:03,039
After I'm gone...

741
01:05:06,439 --> 01:05:07,519
Ada.

742
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:10,119
<i>..</i> .In this family. <i>..</i>

743
01:05:11,479 --> 01:05:13,839
<i>...it</i> was you who was born
to be a politician, not me.

744
01:05:15,479 --> 01:05:16,919
Remember <i>that.</i>

745
01:05:18,399 --> 01:05:20,839
And if ever a seat
is to become available

746
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:23,279
in this ugly old city,
you should run.

747
01:05:24,919 --> 01:05:25,879
Where's Arthur?

748
01:05:25,999 --> 01:05:29,199
He went for a walk
down the river.

749
01:05:29,319 --> 01:05:31,479
He said he's not good
at farewells

750
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:34,079
so he's decided to go
and catch a trout instead.

751
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:39,199
He told me to tell you <i>that...</i>

752
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:44,519
"Where you're going, Tommy,
there will I be. <i>..</i>

753
01:05:45,719 --> 01:05:48,319
"...very soon. Love, Arthur."

754
01:05:55,479 --> 01:05:57,639
How does Arthur know
where you're going, Tommy?

755
01:05:59,999 --> 01:06:02,639
You watch him, Linda.

756
01:06:02,759 --> 01:06:04,639
You love him.

757
01:06:08,679 --> 01:06:09,719
Charles...

758
01:06:10,879 --> 01:06:12,719
<i>...</i> I want you
to look after your mum.

759
01:06:12,839 --> 01:06:15,999
You tell her I'm sorry,
you hear me?

760
01:06:21,879 --> 01:06:23,399
I want you to be the bes. <i>..</i>

761
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:31,719
Exactly how long
are you going away for, Tommy?

762
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:43,799
Thanks, Curly.

763
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:50,199
I want you to be. <i>..</i>

764
01:07:01,159 --> 01:07:02,759
Tom, the horse.

765
01:07:02,879 --> 01:07:04,479
Shut up, Curly.

766
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:12,719
Is she hitched, Johnny?

767
01:07:14,199 --> 01:07:17,519
Tommy, you tell me right now,
where are you going?

768
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:21,119
You have to carry the bucket
on your own this time, Ada.

769
01:07:21,239 --> 01:07:22,719
Tommy, you come to me
with everything.

770
01:07:22,839 --> 01:07:23,999
You always come to me.

771
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:26,399
Not this time.
Not this one, sister.

772
01:07:26,519 --> 01:07:29,599
What the fuck does that mean?
Where are you going?

773
01:07:31,319 --> 01:07:32,479
Tommy!

774
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:48,719
In the bleak midwinter. <i>..</i>

775
01:11:51,639 --> 01:11:54,079
<i>Dad, come out, come out!</i>

776
01:11:55,359 --> 01:11:56,439
<i>Dad, it's me.</i>

777
01:12:10,999 --> 01:12:12,599
Did Polly send you?

778
01:12:14,479 --> 01:12:15,639
Did Polly send you?

779
01:12:16,959 --> 01:12:18,239
Or am I dead already?

780
01:12:18,359 --> 01:12:19,599
<i>No.</i>

781
01:12:21,919 --> 01:12:23,079
<i>You're not dead.</i>

782
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:26,399
<i>You're not even sick.</i>

783
01:12:26,519 --> 01:12:27,959
But I am, my darling.

784
01:12:29,919 --> 01:12:30,959
I am sick.

785
01:12:32,559 --> 01:12:33,879
Sick like you was.

786
01:12:33,999 --> 01:12:36,079
<i>No. Not true.</i>

787
01:12:36,199 --> 01:12:38,519
<i>I know it.
You've got to live, Daddy.</i>

788
01:12:41,719 --> 01:12:43,759
<i>You let the fire go out.</i>

789
01:12:45,879 --> 01:12:48,399
Light the fire again
and get warm,

790
01:12:48,519 --> 01:12:51,639
and you will see
that you must live.

791
01:13:53,959 --> 01:13:56,639
<i>You're not even sick, Daddy.</i>

792
01:14:33,159 --> 01:14:35,199
Fucking Gypsies.

793
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:45,559
Have you thrown the tinkers off
the top field yet?

794
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:47,319
Well, I went up to the caravan,
sir,

795
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:48,439
but there was no-one there.

796
01:14:48,559 --> 01:14:49,799
Well, go back up there
and set fire

797
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:50,959
to the fucking thing.

798
01:14:51,079 --> 01:14:52,999
Yes, sir.

799
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:00,599
Have you filled the car
with petrol?

800
01:15:08,679 --> 01:15:11,839
I said, have you filled the car
up with petrol?

801
01:15:15,319 --> 01:15:16,559
How was the wedding in Berlin?

802
01:15:19,879 --> 01:15:22,479
I hear Chancellor Hitler
himself was the best man.

803
01:15:25,039 --> 01:15:28,199
You've been my doctor now
for three years.

804
01:15:29,879 --> 01:15:32,279
Never knew you were
so well connected.

805
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:34,719
Oh, and the doctor
at St Thomas's

806
01:15:34,839 --> 01:15:36,799
who you sent me to
for the second opinion,

807
01:15:36,919 --> 01:15:38,359
second set of X-rays?

808
01:15:39,439 --> 01:15:41,439
A maid of honour
at the same wedding.

809
01:15:42,599 --> 01:15:44,479
All so very well
fucking connected.

810
01:15:46,679 --> 01:15:48,359
On your knees, Holford.

811
01:15:54,559 --> 01:15:56,919
I'm guessing you people
all decided

812
01:15:57,039 --> 01:15:59,279
that the only person

813
01:15:59,399 --> 01:16:01,159
who could ever kill
Tommy Shelby. <i>..</i>

814
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:04,279
<i>..</i> .Is Tommy Shelby himself.

815
01:16:07,719 --> 01:16:10,039
You made me believe
death was coming.

816
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:12,639
Let my nature do the rest,
eh?

817
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:20,199
You may not have tuberculoma,
Mr Shelby...

818
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:22,639
<i>...but</i> you are sick.

819
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:25,279
I know you.

820
01:16:26,839 --> 01:16:28,839
You are sick with guilt.

821
01:16:30,639 --> 01:16:33,599
Sick of death at your own hand.

822
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:36,559
Sick of who you were.

823
01:16:39,719 --> 01:16:41,399
You are no longer
the kind of man

824
01:16:41,519 --> 01:16:43,879
who would kill another man
in cold blood.

825
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:53,839
Tommy, you have been
on a journey,

826
01:16:53,959 --> 01:16:56,919
from the backstreets
to the corridors of power.

827
01:17:00,039 --> 01:17:01,199
You cannot go back.

828
01:17:03,039 --> 01:17:04,359
You are a different man.

829
01:17:06,479 --> 01:17:08,639
The gun no longer belongs
in your hand.

830
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:16,959
Oh, but I am back.

831
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:22,559
Back from under the ground.

832
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:25,439
Close your eyes.

833
01:17:28,679 --> 01:17:30,439
Close your eyes.

834
01:17:53,799 --> 01:17:54,839
The eleventh hour.

835
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:58,319
Armistice.

836
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:02,759
Peace at last.

837
01:18:06,199 --> 01:18:07,599
Peace at last.

838
01:18:07,623 --> 01:18:15,623
