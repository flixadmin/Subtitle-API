37
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,580
This is the case of a family
of Birmingham gangsters

38
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,940
on trial for murder and sedition.

39
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,100
Why would the King intervene?

40
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,580
The leader of the gang,
Thomas Shelby.

41
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,180
He claims his family was caught up
in a wider conspiracy.

42
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,020
He names Winston Churchill.
You woke me up for this?

43
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,420
And he also sent us this.

44
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,060
How the fuck did
a Birmingham racketeer

45
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,620
get his hands on a personal letter
written by King George?

46
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,180
During a robbery at Hampton Court,

47
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,580
Shelby discovered
a box of correspondence.

48
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,060
Among the papers he stole was
that letter from the King himself,

49
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,060
which proves
His Majesty was involved.

50
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,060
Oh, utter fuck.

51
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,820
If his family walks free, then he
will burn the papers in my presence.

52
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,140
When are they due to hang? Today.

53
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,460
This morning,
in Winson Green Prison.

54
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,660
Why the hell didn't you
bring it up before?!

55
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,660
The plan was for
the Lord Chamberlain

56
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,100
to intervene at the appeal
but late last night

57
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,300
some local judge brought
the executions forward.

58
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,860
Oh, my giddy aunt!

00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,580

00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,260
No.

182
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,180
Michael?

183
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,100
Look...sometimes I have
a sniff of snow, so what?

184
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,740
How's your mother?

185
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,860
I drove past her house.
The drainpipe was hanging off.

186
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,100
Look, the cocaine keeps me awake.

187
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,860
Very long hours these days,
and when I do sleep,

188
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,140
I dream about what happened.

189
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,340
I wasn't asking
about you, Michael, was I?

190
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,100
I was asking about your mother.

191
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,700
Since she was pardoned,
she's been on these fucking tablets

192
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,860
the doctor gave her
when she was in the prison.

193
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,100
She says that when she was
inside the noose...she saw spirits.

194
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,820
She's running seances,

195
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,980
but people just come into
the house to steal things.

196
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,460
Tommy, it's bad.
All right, all right.

197
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,460
Hm! Now, listen to me, Michael...

198
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,700
..the spirits she sees are real.

199
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,300
Believe they're real.

200
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,100
Believe it with her.

201
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,060
Then eventually...

202
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,140
you can take the remembered noose
from around her neck...

203
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,020
..like a horse that's
been choked off.

204
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,860
Keep her off whisky,
throw away the tablets...

205
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,620
..and stop giving her fucking snow.

206
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,140
Fuck, Tommy, that sounded like
family advice.

207
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,620
Are you coming back?

208
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,740
Nothing to come back to.

209
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,140
Truth is, they're all fucked.

210
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,220
The lot of them. Yeah.

211
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,300
Find out about that woman,
Jessie Eden.

212
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,980
Don't let your mother keep cash
in the house. And, oi!

213
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,060
No cocaine
in my registered premises.

214
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,860
Did you see they all came?

215
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,580
Yeah, I saw you at the back.

216
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,820
It's funny they don't notice.

217
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,860
Oh, my sweet!

218
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,820
Oh, my heart!

219
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,580
Crushed to death in the canal.

220
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,620
But back home again,
and so beautiful!

221
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,900
Oh!

222
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,580
WHISPERS: Inside the loop.

223
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,100
Inside the merry loop.

232
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,060
Come on.

# Alas Salvation

# Gilded lily nest of vipers
Never ever did invite us. #

236
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,820
I thought we'd lost you to
the great white way of Broadway.

237
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:10,260
No. Well, this beats
Watery Lane, John.

238
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,340
Does it?
Take a seat, I'll grab the kids.

239
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,540
Oh, it's all right,
I'm not stopping.

240
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,940
I just want to drop those presents
off for tomorrow.

241
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,140
I don't want words on Christmas Eve.

242
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,900
It's my house. You're welcome.

243
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,180
Hm.
FAINT CHILDREN'S CHATTER

244
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,820
It's OK, I'm staying with Polly.

245
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,860
Yeah. She's in a bad way.

246
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,620
Mm. I'll bring her to her senses.

247
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,300
Michael's already tried that.
I'll get through to her.

248
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,700
You still going to come to
the party on New Year's Eve?

249
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,540
Yeah. Who else is coming?

250
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,060
Arthur, Linda...

251
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,780
Hello, Esme.

252
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,780
Who paid for your car and driver,
Ada?

253
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,060
Shelby Company Limited.

254
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,620
Nice car. He treats you well.

255
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,460
His last little pet.

256
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,820
Look, this visit is meant to be
about making things all right.

257
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,540
John had a rope around his neck.
He shit himself.

258
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,180
All right, Esme, that'll do, yeah?
Go in the kitchen.

259
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,340
Take a curse back to the money.

260
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,300
Anyway, there's your presents.

261
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,940
How's Arthur?

262
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,900
For Christmas,
get him a sewing kit...

263
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,220
..so he can sew
his fucking balls back on.

264
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,060
Oh!

265
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,780
GEESE HONK

266
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,540

00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,900
Maypole 245.

268
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,500
Hello, Esme.

269
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,540
There you go, look. That's a couple
of eggs. Two eggs. There we go.

270
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,380
Arthur?

271
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,820
Be careful with Billy in there,
there's a cock.

272
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,660
Yeah, I will.

273
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,860
And don't smoke that near him.

274
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,900
All right. Get out of it!

275
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,100
Esme called to say
Ada's on her way over.

276
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,020
HE LAUGHS

277
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,060
Did you hear that, Billy boy?

278
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,140
Your Auntie Ada's coming
all the way from America.

279
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,660
Bye, chickens!

280
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,820
Oh! We dropped an egg, look!

281
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,340
We dropped an egg, Billy boy.

283
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,980
Give him the hell he gives us,
Miss Eden.

284
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,980
# Take a little walk
to the edge of town

285
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,700
# And go across the tracks

286
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,620
# Where the viaduct looms
like a bird of doom

287
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,020
# As it shifts and cracks

288
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:25,020
# Where the secrets lie
in the border fires

289
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,540
# In the humming wires...#

290
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,740
Excuse me! This is the gents...

291
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,980
You don't have a women's lavatory
on the second floor

292
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,980
because no women get this far up.

293
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,300
If you don't have a women's
lavatory, I can't go to it, can I?

294
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,180
# On a gathering storm
comes a tall handsome man

295
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:45,100
# In a dusty black coat
with a red right hand. #

296
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,700
You say there is a disparity in pay
based on sex.

297
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,860
The male wire-cutters
in the Rover factory

298
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,340
a mile and a half down the road

299
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,140
are paid ten shillings a week more

300
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,580
than the female wire-cutters here.

301
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,460
Different factories,
different rates.

302
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,460
But both factories
are owned by you, Mr Shelby.

303
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,980
Not in your own name, of course.

304
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,700
In the name of Arrow House Holdings.

305
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,900
You own the Lanchester
car and van factory

306
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,980
in the name
of Tilton Company Limited,

307
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,980
the Billings machine tools factories
at Hay Mills and Greet

308
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,860
in the name of
Stetchford Engineering,

309
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,020
the Bilston Forgings and Pressings
factory in the name of Canalside,

310
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,180
and the canal warehousing
in Gas Street,

311
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,060
Saltely and Cadbury in the name
of Shelby Company Limited.

312
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,820
Also, 255 streets
of back-to-back houses.

313
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,060
Very good.

314
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,940
Very good.

315
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,780
So this isn't about women and men.

316
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,460
It's about me, eh?

317
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,620
Tommy Shelby, OBE.
No, it's not about you.

318
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,300
It's about disparities.

319
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,060
It's about ten shillings a week
for working mothers

320
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,780
so they can buy shoes for their
kids. Never had shoes myself.

321
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,620
So, now you deny others?

322
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,260
And, barefoot, I grew up mean.

323
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,860
Oh, I know.
Oh, yeah, you know everything.

324
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,580
Your turn of phrase...
Is unacceptable?

325
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,500
You grew up mean, you say? A threat
in there, I think, somewhere.

326
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,420
No threats. The whole of
Birmingham knows you, Mr Shelby.

327
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:28,780
Sweetheart...whatever you've heard,
I don't need to make threats.

328
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,140
My comrade brothers and sisters...

329
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,820
Huh! Your brothers and sisters!
All right, listen,

330
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,060
I will conduct myself
as a businessman...

331
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,740
Who says "sweetheart"!

332
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,780
You say there is
a ten-shilling disparity

333
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,740
between male and female cutters
in two of my factories?

334
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,220
Very well.

335
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,100
I will increase the pay of
the female cutters

336
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,740
in this factory by five shillings.

337
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,500
And I will cut the pay

338
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,940
of the male cutters in the Rover
by five shillings...

339
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,260
..thereby achieving
your sacred fucking parity.

340
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,100
And I will tell the men
with families to feed

341
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,820
whose idea it was to cut their pay.

342
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,020
You do that, I will bring
all my members out on strike.

343
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,540
Oh, yeah? The week after Christmas?
You think so?

344
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,460
You know, everything
you've said here today,

345
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,820
and the fact that we're having
this meeting today

346
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,220
tells me that you are
a woman without a family.

347
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,100
And everything I hear about you

348
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,460
tells me you are a man
without a family, as well.

349
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,100
My comrade brothers and sisters
are not afraid of you, Mr Shelby.

350
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,220
I will call an extraordinary meeting
of my executive committee

351
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,100
as soon as Boxing Day.

352
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,860
You will hear the whistles blow
all across Birmingham.

353
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,100
I've heard lots of whistles blow,
sweetheart!

354
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,900
HE EXHALES

355
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,140
FOOTSTEPS

356
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,660
DOOR OPENS

357
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,980
The post has arrived, Mr Shelby.

358
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,540
I'm sorry to keep asking,

359
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,620
but Chef needs to know
how many for dinner tomorrow.

360
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,940
He's new. He's foreign.
He gets very upset.

361
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,980
Right. Well, you tell Chef

362
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,500
there'll be 27 guests
for Christmas dinner tomorrow.

363
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,860
27? Family?

364
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,820
Yep. I thought Charlie
could do with some company,

365
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,900
so I asked Johnny Dogs if he knew
anyone who liked to eat goose...

366
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,620
..and he said he knew 26.

367
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,860
Tell Chef I want ten geese,

368
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,140
a buck cut into steaks,

369
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,140
some trout from the river.

370
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,580
Fetch whisky, brandy and wine
from the cellar. Best we have.

371
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,860
There will be children?

372
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,940
Lots of children.

373
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,460
With Johnny's tribe, new ones
might be born on the floor.

374
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:11,220
So have mops and buckets ready, eh?

375
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,940
And I want you at the table,
Frances, so make it 28.

376
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,020
I will be busy.

377
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,180
You've put up with me
this past year,

378
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,340
looked after Charlie
when I've been on business.

379
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,540
Tomorrow, you will eat at my table.

380
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,460
Things will get better, I think,
next year.

381
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,340
Uh-huh.

382
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,660
HE CLEARS THROAT

383
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,300
HE BREATHES HARD

384
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,940
It gets much warmer
than here in the summer.

385
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,380
Much colder in the winter.
I knew it. Mm.

386
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,500
But parts of it are
just like Birmingham.

387
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,700
Yeah. Shit and smoke
are the same everywhere.

388
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,940
Hm. What about you, Linda?
Are you working?

389
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,540
I've been seeking work as a teacher.
A teacher.

390
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,900
But, you know, it's quite difficult.

391
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,540
The Shelby name,
it's always in the papers.

392
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,420
And, er...what do you
get up to all day, Arthur?

393
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,300
As you know,
Arthur's previous endeavours

394
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,980
have left us with
no need for a salary.

395
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,940
Arthur occupies his time in
the garden, doing voluntary work.

396
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,580
He drives old people and cripples.

397
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,540
Oh. Yeah, well,
it's something to do.

398
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,340
I want to open a garage.

399
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,620
Some day. Fixing cars, you know?

400
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,660
Sometimes cars attract
ambitious men.

401
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,580
Yeah, well...I like fixing cars.

402
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,260
Mm.

403
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,900
PHONE RINGS

404
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,460
I'll go. I got it.

405
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,300
Maypole 245.

406
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,260
Arthur, have you checked your post?

407
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,820
I just got served a black hand.

408
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,220
I just got delivered a black fucking
hand to the house.

409
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,100
From Luca Changretta.

410
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,500
WHISPERS: Jesus!

411
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,620
Jesus Christ!

412
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,620
Wait a minute, John,
which one was Luca?

413
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,220
The old man's oldest son.

414
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,500
He was going to get done for
killing a bank clerk in a robbery,

415
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,460
so his old man sent him
back to New York.

416
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,340
You know what the black hand means
among the wops, Arthur?

417
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,300
It's Mafia shit.

418
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,060
The Sicilian fucking Mafia!

419
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,300
Check your post, Arthur.

420
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,940
Arthur, I was just leaving.
No, you're not.

421
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,700
I need...I need to talk to you.
Arthur?

422
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,700
It's all right, Linda. Stay here.
Ada, please.

423
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,380
Linda? You stay here.

424
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,540
Did you say Mafia?

425
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,220
Esme, I need to make a call. No!

426
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,300
I need to make a fucking call! Give
it here! What the fuck is this?!

427
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,660
Give it here! Not until you tell me
what the fuck it is!

428
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,100
Give it here! What is it?!

429
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,500
It's from Luca Changretta,
all right? We killed his dad.

430
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,900
I remember.
It was Tommy who killed him!

431
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,700
It was fucking Arthur
pulled the trigger!

432
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,500
All right, it was mercy,
but it was Arthur!

433
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,380
Anyway,
it makes no fucking difference!

434
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,660
For the wops, it's family.

435
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,220
The black hand came here.

436
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,980
Everybody will have got one.

437
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,860
They're coming for us all!

438
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,140
We made an agreement.

439
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,860
We made a solemn promise.

440
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,180
We're the family now.

441
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,340
Here, look at that.

442
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,420
That's from Changretta's son, Luca.

443
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:09,140
How the fuck he
knows where I live. Eh?

444
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,540
And why's he waited a year?

445
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,820
I'm going to see Tommy next.
I'll talk to him.

446
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,540
I've been served a black hand
and she won't even let me

447
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,300
keep a fucking
spud gun in the house.

448
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,900
Go to a hotel.

449
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,420
It's Christmas Eve, Ada.

450
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,300
I've got a gun in the glove
compartment. You take that for now.

451
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,180
I'll talk to Tommy
and have him call.

452
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,820
Just make sure you get to the
phone first. Yeah. Now hug me,

453
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,300
like you came out here
because you were emotional.

454
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,140
I am emotional. I just don't know
what fucking emotion it is.

455
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,860
It'll be OK. I'll talk to Tommy.

456
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,500
You talk to him.

457
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,740
GOOSE HONKS

458
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,500
You and me both, brother.

459
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,540
ENGINE STARTS

460
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,020
Ada!

461
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,340
You wait there,
you won't leave empty handed.

462
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,900
Here you go, look, some eggs,

463
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,620
you give them to Polly, all right?

464
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,060
And you, keep your eyes on the road.

465
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,540
Take care.

466
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,340
Who was on the phone, Arthur?

467
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,340
John. Wishing me Merry Christmas.

468
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,140
Come inside. It's getting late.

469
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,780
SHIP'S HORN

470
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,980
Thanks.

471
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,060
HE SPEAKS ITALIAN

472
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,860
Take off the hat.

473
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,900
Are you with those other Italians?

474
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,740
We're Americans.
It says it right there on the paper.

475
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,540
USA.

476
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,180
And what's the purpose
of your visit?

477
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,300
Pleasure.

478
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,020
Mum? It's me.

479
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,460
You left the door open.

480
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,740
To change the air.

481
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,580
I told you I was busy today.

482
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,620
What do you want?

483
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,140
Why haven't you opened your post?

484
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,380
I tidied up.

485
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,020
Ada's coming today.

486
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,060
She's late.

487
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,020
Tommy asked about you today.

488
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,660
I hope Ada's car hasn't broken down.

489
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:47,460
Is Shelby Company Limited
still using Bentleys?

490
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,500
Yeah.

491
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,220
Bentleys are no good in the cold.

492
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,940
You should tell him.

493
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,140
I will.

494
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,300
Any other messages for Tommy?

495
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,660
Yeah. Fuck off.

496
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,900
He saw that your drain pipe
was broken. He was worried.

497
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:12,580
Is that it? Is that all
he asked about? Drainpipes?

498
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,940
No. He said that I'm to accept
that you have a gift.

499
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,420
That you've always had a gift.

500
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,140
What gift?

501
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,900
Second sight.

502
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,260
Spirits. All that gypsy stuff,
he said that I'm to believe you.

503
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,260
You think I don't
hear his voice in yours.

504
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,500
You don't think
I recognise his strategies.

505
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,340
I'm still a match for him.

506
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,380
Yes.

507
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,660
You are. And you still can be.

508
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,900
Me and Lizzie decided that

509
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,460
this New Year
we're all to turn the page.

510
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,180
You can't spend another
year like this, Mum. "Mum."

511
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,220
Mum.

512
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,580
That word is like a bullet to me.

513
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,820
I see your sister in
that chair sometimes...

514
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:19,180
Look, me and Lizzie
have decided.

515
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,340
It's time.

516
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,660
I bought these.

517
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,100
One for you and Ada

518
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,740
and one for you and me.

519
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,980
So Tommy said,
"Keep her off the whisky."

520
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,660
I'll drink Champagne
the day my son leaves

521
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,980
the employment
of Shelby Company Limited.

522
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,700
You tell him that next time
he mentions fucking drainpipes.

523
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:13,540
Right. Now, this is your job,
Charlie. We give those to Santa

524
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,140
and Rudolph.

525
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,220
Good boy. Put this out for Santa,
for his whisky.

526
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,580
Now, night-night. Merry Christmas.

527
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,940
I will see you tomorrow. Sleep well.
Come on, Charlie.

528
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,220
APPROACHING VEHICLE

529
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,060
KNOCKING

530
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,100
Mr Shelby, it's your sister.

531
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,500
I know. Send her in.

532
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,180
I got a card, Ada.

533
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,340
I'm guessing Arthur
and John have had one as well.

534
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:13,780
Hello, Tommy. "Hello, Ada, welcome
home." Thanks, it's nice to be back.

535
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,300
I've spoken to Moss.

536
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,060
Moss said Changretta is a soldier
for the Spinetti family,

537
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,780
which means he will have men
with him, professional men.

538
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,420
They usually operate in
units of around ten.

539
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,740
Moss is checking Cunard records to
see if they're already in England.

540
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,060
This one's for you.

541
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,820
What is it? A time machine?

542
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,980
My God. Tommy Shelby.

543
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,460
Is that regret?

544
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,060
I'll open it tomorrow.

545
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,460
So, boss, in the light of
the changed circumstances,

546
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,020
what are your orders?

547
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,540
Changretta knows where we all live.

548
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,220
If we stay out
in the open, isolated,

549
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,580
he'll pick us off one by one.

550
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,540
We need to be together in a place
even they won't dare to come.

551
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,500
You mean back home?

552
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,460
Within a four-mile radius
of the Garrison,

553
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,460
every man is a guard
and a soldier for us.

554
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:11,740
I'm calling a family meeting.
Charlie Strong's yard, Boxing Day.

555
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,220
Finn's already there.
You tell Polly and Michael.

556
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,620
I'll deal with John and Arthur.

557
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,100
And Esme and Linda?

558
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,980
Anyone who wants to live
to see another Christmas

559
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,340
needs to come to where it's safe.

560
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,500
These bastards
will kill kids as well.

561
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,260
When this business is finished,
we can...go our separate ways.

562
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,580
Go and see Polly and explain.

563
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,100
She'll have had a card as well.

564
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,260
Do you think I'm on the list?

565
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,780
We're all on the list, Ada.

566
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,100
I gave my gun to Arthur.

567
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,500
Welcome home.

568
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:26,500
Holy shit, it's Father Christmas.

569
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:30,860
Yeah, and if you're good...
you get what you deserve.

570
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,540
Fucking come here, you!

571
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:55,340
PHONE RINGS

572
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,460
Fuck.

573
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,900
Yeah, put me through to Maypole 245.

574
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,340
PHONE RINGS

575
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,140
Hello. Arthur, it's Tommy.

576
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,620
Be quick, they're asleep.

577
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:38,340
Family meeting,
Charlie's yard, Boxing Day, midday.

578
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:41,580
I can't raise John but
I'll send Michael to get him.

579
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:46,180
If you have to pull a gun on Linda,
do it. Merry Christmas.

580
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,500
Merry Christmas, Tom.

581
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,220
What did you do with them?

582
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,300
My tablets were in
the bathroom cabinet.

583
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,460
What did you do with them?

584
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,180
I threw them in the lavatory.

585
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,820
Tommy's orders?

586
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,980
No. My own decision.

587
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,940
How am I going to get through
Christmas without them?

588
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,260
They close everything.

589
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,380
How am I going to get through
Christmas without them?

590
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,300
I'll help you.
They don't open anything.

591
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,900
Fucking no apothecary, nothing.

592
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,500
You can move in with me
and I'll help you.

593
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,540
How can I get through
fucking Christmas? Without...

594
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,060
Without anything! How?

595
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,340
SHE BREATHES HARD AND RAPIDLY

596
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,020
You can move in with me
and I'll help you.

597
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,900
Fuck off! Fuck off!
Fuck off, Thomas Shelby!

598
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,380
Fuck off! It's all right it's me.
Mum, this as got to stop!

599
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,580
I don't want you,
I don't want you, Thomas Shelby.

600
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,140
My husband is back and he loves me.

601
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,540
Tommy said to believe in
spirits with you, but I can't.

602
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,660
Hello, Polly. Hello, Michael.
Merry Christmas.

603
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,180
The door was wide open.

604
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,500
Fuck.

605
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:11,780
I spent the whole day tidying up.
I wanted it to be nice.

606
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,340
I wanted it to look nice!

607
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,140
Why, Pol? It's only me.

608
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,380
It's OK. It's OK.

609
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:20,980
We can sit, sit and talk
and put things back together.

610
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,420
It's OK.

611
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,620
I'll leave you two to it.
No, you stay.

612
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:31,620
Now, listen, something's happened.
Things have changed.

613
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:37,260
Today everyone in the family
received one of these.

614
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,900
What does it mean?

615
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,500
Tommy's called a family meeting.
He wants you both to come.

616
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,860
APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS

617
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,220
KNOCKING

618
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,900
Come.

619
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,900
I'm really sorry to
bother you again, sir,

620
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,420
but Chef insists on knowing
what time the guests will arrive.

621
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:26,260
Francis, for the last time,
it's Johnny Dogs. They're gypsies.

622
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,060
They're camped down by the river.

623
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,580
When they're ready
they'll walk up. All right?

624
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:33,100
He says it's about preparation, sir.

625
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,540
What is?

626
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,620
He's asked specifically.

627
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,860
Will they arrive before
the King's speech or after?

628
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,420
You said he was new, this chef.

629
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,780
When did join us?

630
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:50,820
October.

631
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,420
October.

632
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,220
And he's foreign?

633
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,380
He's Italian, sir.

634
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:05,860
Oh. He's the best chef we've
ever had in the house.

635
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,700
No shouting or swearing
or blaspheming.

636
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,100
Do we have his references?

637
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,580
Yes.

638
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,420
The only problem
has been his assistant.

639
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,980
What assistant?

640
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:22,220
He brought an assistant with him.
He calls him his sous-chef.

641
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:29,020
Are they still working, Frances?

642
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,860
They'll be there till midnight, sir.

643
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:37,540
Right, thank you. Good night.

644
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,580
You can go to bed.

645
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:40,980
Merry Christmas, sir.

646
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,860
And I thought about your offer.

647
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,020
I'd be happy to sit at your table.

648
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,460
Right, thank you.

649
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,660
What's your name?

650
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:33,780
Max, Mr Shelby.

651
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:34,980
Max.

652
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,620
It's all right. Don't get up.

653
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,980
Oh. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry, yes.

654
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,500
You're new. I'm Mr Shelby.

655
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,140
Hello, sir.

656
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,060
I haven't taken time to
introduce myself.

657
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,260
Antonio.

658
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,660
What have you done
that's so wrong, eh?

659
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,420
Excuse me?

660
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,420
A sous-chef peeling potatoes.

661
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,980
It's an emergency. Late notice.

662
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,940
Oh. Late notice.

663
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,020
Right, right, carry on.

664
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,420
Antonio...

665
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,980
..here, £10.

666
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,380
For the late notice.

667
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,300
You wanted to know if
my guests would arrive

668
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,900
before or after the King's speech?

669
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,820
Eh? Yes.

670
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,540
It'll be after.

671
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,420
How are you?

672
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,620
Oh, just...worried about tomorrow.

673
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,780
Yeah? I'm worried about Antonio.

674
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,740
You've been here two months
and we've not met before.

675
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,660
It's my fault. I've been busy.

676
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,380
Thomas Shelby.

677
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,900
My hand has blood.

678
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,340
Oh, mine too.

679
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,660
Hey, er, how much do
you pay Antonio?

680
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:15,820
I forget.

681
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,220
Must be a lot.

682
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,380
I just gave him £10.

683
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,460
Didn't mean a fucking thing to him.

684
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,980
Maybe it isn't you that pays him.

685
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,940
I've been reading up on you.

686
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:46,820
Bertorelli. Claridge's.

687
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:51,780
You used to work in a place
called San Marco's,

688
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,140
on...on Fleet Street.

689
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:01,460
I used to know the man
that owned San Marco's.

690
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,100
A man called Darby Sabini.

691
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,220
I never met him. No.

692
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:12,620
Maybe your...assistant, Antonio,
maybe he's met him.

693
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,420
Here's how it is.

694
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:20,260
Antonio was sent from New York.
I don't know. Please...

695
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,700
Darby Sabini facilitated.

696
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,740
He passed him on to you and told
you to bring him into my house.

697
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:28,260
They threatened to kill you
if you didn't do it.

698
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:31,180
You want me to dress you like
you dressed that fucking stag?

699
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,820
Please!

700
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:39,180
You know about me, right? Mm-hm.

701
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,740
You know what I do? Mm-hm.

702
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:45,380
You wanted to know when
my guests would arrive

703
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,020
because Antonio needed me alone.
He's an assassin.

704
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,220
The plan is to kill me tomorrow.

705
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,820
I don't know.

706
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,740
They just said bring him here.

707
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,700
Well, bring him here.

708
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,060
Antonio!

709
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,620
HE CALLS OUT IN ITALIAN

710
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:46,580
HE SPEAKS ITALIAN

711
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,300
Aaaargh!

712
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,060
Aaaargh!

713
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:09,620
You are a black hand!
You are a black hand!

714
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:13,700
How many came from New York?
How many fucking came from New York?

715
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,260
Vaffanculo!

716
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:19,700
What did he... What did he say?
Is that a curse or a number?

717
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,380
What did he fucking say?
What did he fucking say?

718
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,220
He said, "Fuck you." Yeah?

719
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,540
GUNSHOT

720
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,540
The black hand means
kill or be killed.

721
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,340
You go back to London,

722
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:46,180
you tell Darby Sabini he picked
the wrong side in this war.

723
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:50,860
Once we've dealt with the Americans,
we'll come for him.

724
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:52,660
Go on, go.

725
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:53,820
Go.

726
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:58,460
Oi! You tell anyone else,
I'll come and find you.

727
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,740
Harrow 335.

728
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,420
The Hare and Hounds pub.

729
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,100
Robert. Yes, it's Mr Shelby.

730
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,980
Merry Christmas to you too.

731
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,460
Robert, is there a gypsy in
the public bar playing

732
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,460
the fiddle for shillings?

733
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:40,940
Yes.

734
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:44,300
Can you, er, can you tell him
I need to speak to him?

735
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,100
Thank you.

736
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:00,060
Oh, fuck, Tom.

737
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:03,060
I thought these sporting
days were over.

738
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:05,820
Yeah, so did I.
But they keep coming back at us.

739
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,460
There's a black stallion
in the stables.

740
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:11,700
He's invisible at night, use him.

741
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,140
Take the body across the river
to the rough ground.

742
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,300
Burn him? No. This one's a message.

743
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,900
Will there still be
geese for dinner?

744
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:25,300
Only if you can steal them
on the way. On the way where?

745
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:28,140
We're going back, Johnny.

746
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,860
Back to Small Heath.

747
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,420
Back where you belong.

748
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:37,660
HE SPEAKS HIS OWN LANGUAGE

749
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:40,500
Merry Christmas.
You can keep the stallion.

750
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,340
Christ the fucking night.

751
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:02,060
Michael, they're coming today.
Michael, shut up and listen.

752
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:03,620
You've got to get everyone out.

753
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:05,900
Get Polly and Ada to Charlie's yard.

754
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,820
I've told Arthur
but I can't reach John.

755
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,620
When you've dropped Polly and Ada,

756
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:12,100
go out to John's place
and get him out. All right?

757
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:18,740
Is it Christmas?
Not just yet. Let's go, eh? Mummy!

758
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,940
Move!

759
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,020
Hello?

760
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:52,740
GUN COCKS

761
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:57,740
Oh, fuck. It's you. Got nothing
better to do on Christmas morning?

762
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:01,060
Tommy wants everybody at
Charlie's yard now. Come on.

763
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:05,500
Get in. Get in. What's going to
happen? It's fucking Christmas.

764
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,380
Look, John, we don't
have time for this.

765
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:11,220
Come into the house. Just come
to the meeting. Have some food.

766
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,980
Tell Tommy Shelby
we can look after ourselves.

767
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:17,020
Tommy says they could
come for us today.

768
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,100
Tommy says, Tommy says.
Are you his fucking parrot?

769
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,660
Look it's the Mafia, all right.

770
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:23,020
This is the New York Mafia
we're talking about.

771
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:25,140
And we're
the Peaky fucking Blinders.

772
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,420
No, we're not, John.

773
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,180
We're not the Peaky fucking Blinders
unless we're together.

774
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,580
You were together on the gallows,

775
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:33,180
with one man missing.

776
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:38,220
John? John, come to the meeting,
all right? Think about the kids.

777
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,980
Come to the meeting and
if you want to leave then fine.

778
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,540
HORSE HOOVES

779
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,820
No. It's Christmas Day.
We're the family now.

780
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:46,980
We're staying at home.

781
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,700
In the fucking house! Esme...

782
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,340
John!

783
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:59,180
GUNFIRE
