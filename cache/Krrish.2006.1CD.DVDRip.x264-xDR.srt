1
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:35,610
What a mess!

2
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,589
Krishna...Krishna...Krishna...

3
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,588
What am l going to do with this boy...?

4
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:14,220
Krishna...

5
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,716
Yes, grandma?

6
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:17,892
Whose sketch book is this?

7
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:19,721
Mine, grandma.

8
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:22,058
And who made these sketches?

9
00:01:22,264 --> 00:01:26,064
Grandma, why do grown ups sometimes
ask childish questions...?

10
00:01:26,268 --> 00:01:29,237
lf it's my sketch book, obviously,
l've made the sketches.

11
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:34,899
Grown ups talk like children when
children act like grown ups.

12
00:01:35,144 --> 00:01:39,410
Tell me something, how did you make
such beautiful sketches?

13
00:01:39,548 --> 00:01:40,378
With this.

14
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:44,244
Like l've made your
sketch right now. See?

15
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,747
Wow!

16
00:01:47,923 --> 00:01:49,254
Let me see!

17
00:01:52,428 --> 00:01:54,760
Rohit loved drawing too.

18
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,658
Papa made sketches too?

19
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:57,829
Yes.

20
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:04,102
When Rohit was your age and
he used to get tired studying

21
00:02:04,473 --> 00:02:06,600
he used to sketch.

22
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,276
l want to be like my Papa too.

23
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:12,439
You are like your Papa!

24
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,948
Mrs Mehra, l've called you here
to tell you that...

25
00:02:18,587 --> 00:02:20,782
we want to take Krishna's l.Q. test.

26
00:02:21,223 --> 00:02:22,121
l.Q. test...?

27
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:25,117
But why, Father?

28
00:02:25,995 --> 00:02:28,463
Krishna's absolutely normal.

29
00:02:28,664 --> 00:02:29,790
No, Mrs Mehra.

30
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,128
He's not normal.

31
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:34,300
What are you saying, Father?

32
00:02:35,171 --> 00:02:36,297
Are you telling me...

33
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:40,636
that Krishna is the same as
Rohit was in his childhood?

34
00:02:41,343 --> 00:02:42,469
No, Father.

35
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:44,813
Krishna's a very bright child.

36
00:02:45,347 --> 00:02:50,046
He scores very good marks, he
always gets A-plus grades.

37
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:53,788
He even does his homework
without any help.

38
00:02:54,023 --> 00:02:55,718
And that of other children too.

39
00:02:56,392 --> 00:02:57,290
What?

40
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,858
This is the notebook of
a Class 3 student.

41
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,002
This is...

42
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,762
...Krishna's handwriting.

43
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,840
Yes, Krishna has done this
child's math homework.

44
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:22,614
But how's that possible, Father?
Krishna's still in Class 1.

45
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:25,445
That's exactly why we wish to
take Krishna's l.Q. test...

46
00:03:26,422 --> 00:03:33,351
so that we can ascertain just how bright,
sharp and ahead he is...

47
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:35,555
of other children his age

48
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,800
Krishna, how do you define amount?

49
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:43,434
Principle plus interest is equal to amount, sir

50
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:49,710
After what age does the brain
of a person stop growing?

51
00:03:50,446 --> 00:03:53,904
Afterthe age of 15, Father.

52
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:13,965
What happened, Mrs Mehra?

53
00:04:14,537 --> 00:04:19,531
The l.Q. test was going so well, Krishna
was answering all questions right...

54
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,435
That's exactly why l brought him away.

55
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:24,741
But why?

56
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,477
You ought to be proud that
your grandson is so brilliant.

57
00:04:29,785 --> 00:04:32,686
He's a genius, a miracle child.

58
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:39,224
Earlier it was a hunch
but now l'm sure.

59
00:04:39,895 --> 00:04:42,864
The powers that Jadoo
had bestowed on Rohit...

60
00:04:43,365 --> 00:04:48,564
...have been inherited by Krishna.

61
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:53,239
You will see, Mrs Mehra.
Like his father...

62
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:56,878
...Krishna will also achieve
great success.

63
00:04:57,513 --> 00:04:59,140
His name will appear in
the Guinness Book ...

64
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,515
...and the whole world will
speak highly of him.

65
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:07,648
That's exactly what l don't want, Father.

66
00:05:09,658 --> 00:05:11,717
What did Rohit gain, after all?

67
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,398
They gave him medals, applauded him...

68
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:20,565
but everybody only used him..

69
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,470
...took advantage of him, Father.

70
00:05:25,307 --> 00:05:26,604
And then...

71
00:05:29,678 --> 00:05:35,139
...l lost my son and my daughter-in-law.

72
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,987
l don't want to lose Krishna now.

73
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,987
l don't want to lose him.

74
00:05:44,193 --> 00:05:47,356
l can understand your concern and fears.

75
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:51,394
But destiny cannot be changed.

76
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:57,865
And talent is a gift which cannot be hidden.

77
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,967
l will hide it.

78
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:06,444
l'll take Krishna far away...

79
00:06:07,883 --> 00:06:09,407
... very far.

80
00:07:57,593 --> 00:08:05,728
Krishna... Krishna...

81
00:08:08,036 --> 00:08:10,937
Coming, Grandma!

82
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:15,573
Toofan, let's see who gets home first.

83
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,219
Hey... what did you see?

84
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:19,527
As usual, l've seen nothing and
l won't say a word to anyone.

85
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:21,726
But as usual, l'll take
something from you.

86
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:24,862
Take this!

87
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:30,003
l hide all your secrets and you
always give me jaggery?

88
00:10:30,312 --> 00:10:32,542
lt won't work today.

89
00:10:32,748 --> 00:10:35,842
Ok, ok, come home...
l'll give you Bournvita.

90
00:10:35,984 --> 00:10:36,916
Bournvita?

91
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,919
Yes. Don't you want to be like me?

92
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:40,079
Yes!

93
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,917
So go, wear something below and come.

94
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:53,434
Krishna...

95
00:10:56,271 --> 00:10:57,738
You've come?

96
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:01,438
Grandma, how do you know l've come?

97
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,072
l make no sound at all!

98
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:06,577
l can hearyour heartbeats.

99
00:11:06,782 --> 00:11:08,249
But how, Grandma?

100
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:14,378
Your eyes say that you've been
upto mischief again.

101
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:19,060
Mischief? Not at all, Grandma!

102
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:24,225
No mischief? Then why're you hiding
yourface like a thief?

103
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:26,558
Not hiding, just washing my face, Grandma

104
00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:30,067
Ok ok.. lay the breakfast.

105
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,068
l've come!

106
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:02,133
What happened?

107
00:12:03,238 --> 00:12:06,969
Chintu dropped a glass, Grandma...

108
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:08,802
Me?

109
00:12:09,177 --> 00:12:12,146
Chintu! Upto mischief again?

110
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:15,479
Tell herthe truth, Krishna, else l shall.

111
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:17,978
Sure, go ahead

112
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:20,614
l'll tell her since you've asked me to

113
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:24,614
Grandma, Krishna was running faster
than Toofan today

114
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,420
What? Fasterthan Toofan?

115
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:29,723
So? What's the big deal?

116
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:30,932
And how about that?

117
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:32,759
What?

118
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:35,936
You climbed the mountain faster
than the monkeys...

119
00:12:36,571 --> 00:12:40,530
Grandma, you know that tall
mountain by the temple?

120
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:43,869
Krishna jumped from it
into the river.

121
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:46,706
l thought it was all over.
But he came back!

122
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:51,111
Krishna, why do you do such things?

123
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:56,080
l've forbidden you time and again!
Why do you still do such things?

124
00:12:56,324 --> 00:12:57,916
What do l do Grandma?
You tell me!

125
00:13:00,228 --> 00:13:02,025
How do l rid myself of loneliness?

126
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:04,357
Who do l make friends with?

127
00:13:05,867 --> 00:13:09,030
Boys my age have gone away to the city,
to either study or earn a living

128
00:13:10,138 --> 00:13:12,368
And those that are here don't
want be friends with me

129
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:15,877
They say... l'm not like them

130
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:23,549
So l've made friends with
animals and birds

131
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:28,556
Keep myself busy with nature.

132
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:32,886
But even out here in the open,
l sometimes feel stifled

133
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:39,397
l feel like running far away
from here.

134
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:44,902
Will you leave me and go away?

135
00:13:48,877 --> 00:13:52,506
lt's because of you that l don't go!
Else, l'd have left long ago

136
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:09,756
Krishna has grown up, Rohit

137
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:16,598
l'm not sure how long l will be
able to hide him

138
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:22,267
Where is Sonia Mehra and her
grandson Krishna, Father?

139
00:14:23,311 --> 00:14:27,771
lt's the third time in so many years
that l've come to ask you

140
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:30,280
And my answer is still the same.

141
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:35,612
l have no idea where Mrs Mehra is.
l really don't know!

142
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:39,627
Why do you keep coming to me again
and again and waste my time?

143
00:14:40,562 --> 00:14:43,759
Because you are the last link to
Rohit Mehra's family...

144
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,966
and you're the last person Sonia Mehra
met before she went missing

145
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,967
You know where they are,
but you're lying.

146
00:14:53,308 --> 00:14:54,104
What?

147
00:14:55,577 --> 00:14:57,374
You are lying, Father.

148
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,841
When l asked you whether Krishna possessed
the powers Rohit had...

149
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:05,251
you said he didn't.

150
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:09,750
But l was told...that the son was
betterthan his father

151
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:14,959
That he possesses all of Rohit's powers.
So tell me, Father...

152
00:15:15,297 --> 00:15:17,765
l'll pay any price you ask

153
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:20,831
How dare you! Mr Sinha,
this is a school!

154
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:23,163
We don't indulge
in business here!

155
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:25,731
Please leave now!

156
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:31,806
You're making a mistake, Father.
A big mistake.

157
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,319
Krishna! Look!

158
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:48,922
What a huge kite!

159
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:51,091
But where's the string?

160
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:54,094
Must've snapped. Let's get it!

161
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:00,787
Don't scream! You needn't be afraid

162
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:07,131
Close your eyes and hold on to me tightly

163
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:26,312
Stop screaming!

164
00:18:28,256 --> 00:18:29,655
Else, l'll drop you.

165
00:18:31,192 --> 00:18:32,159
Close your eyes

166
00:18:33,595 --> 00:18:35,825
Close your eyes, not widen them.

167
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:37,665
Close them!

168
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:39,500
Close!

169
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,013
The glider came this way!

170
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:02,188
There it is!

171
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:03,850
Where...?

172
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:05,860
Up there!

173
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,194
Oh my God! Where's Priya?

174
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:11,361
There!

175
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:25,041
She's breathing. She must've passed out

176
00:19:25,246 --> 00:19:27,510
Let's take her back to the camp

177
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:38,050
The glider was at such a height,
Priya Ma'am was down here...

178
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:41,387
...and she's still breathing?
Just imagine!

179
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,726
Just imagine.

180
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:47,900
lmagine!

181
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,927
Where am l...?

182
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,925
You're alive and you're with us

183
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,927
Thank God you're alive.

184
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,927
Not God, it's that boy
we ought to thank

185
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,271
That boy...? Which boy?

186
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,104
The one who saved my life

187
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:31,104
A boy saved you?

188
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,444
But there was no one there

189
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:37,448
No sir! He must've been there!
We fell from the tree together.

190
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:42,111
Together...? But you went
in the glider alone.

191
00:20:42,357 --> 00:20:45,121
How did he come on
the tree to rescue you...?

192
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,118
Did he fall from the skies?

193
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:48,955
Yes sir. That's where he came from!

194
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,131
Priya, trust me, you were all alone. Right?

195
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:58,969
Ghost!

196
00:20:59,174 --> 00:20:59,799
What happened?

197
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:01,809
G-H-O-S-T !

198
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:05,971
Komal sir, ghost!

199
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:07,640
Ghost?

200
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:18,055
What are you blabbering, Bahadur?

201
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,060
No blabber, sir. lt's a chant.
To drive the ghost away.

202
00:21:23,264 --> 00:21:26,392
What rubbish, Bahadur?
Ghost in broad daylight?

203
00:21:26,668 --> 00:21:32,072
This is a jungle, sir! Night
and day are all the same here

204
00:21:32,273 --> 00:21:34,241
Priya Ma'am, was he tall?

205
00:21:34,442 --> 00:21:35,409
Yes

206
00:21:36,444 --> 00:21:37,570
Well built?

207
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:38,746
Yes!

208
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,076
Fair-skinned?

209
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:40,906
Yes!

210
00:21:41,282 --> 00:21:41,907
Kalicharan!

211
00:21:42,116 --> 00:21:42,912
Kalicharan...?

212
00:21:44,152 --> 00:21:45,084
Kalicharan...?

213
00:21:45,353 --> 00:21:48,083
Yes, sir! Kalicharan's ghost!

214
00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:51,925
Been wandering in the mountains
for ages... upside down on trees

215
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,422
Just imagine!

216
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:54,424
What nonsense!

217
00:21:55,496 --> 00:21:58,260
A ghost in ourtimes...?
l don't believe all this.

218
00:21:58,466 --> 00:21:59,933
l also don't believe all this!

219
00:22:02,136 --> 00:22:02,932
What happened?

220
00:22:03,304 --> 00:22:04,271
What happened?

221
00:22:04,973 --> 00:22:05,769
Relax...

222
00:22:09,811 --> 00:22:12,939
Sir, it's either a sprain or a fracture

223
00:22:13,147 --> 00:22:14,444
Oh no!

224
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:16,775
We're here on a 10-day
adventure camp...

225
00:22:17,051 --> 00:22:19,611
...and you've already broken yourfoot!

226
00:22:20,154 --> 00:22:23,612
Honey, take her into the tent
and give herfirst-aid

227
00:22:24,158 --> 00:22:24,624
Careful...

228
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:34,895
Bahadur, go to your phone booth
and call for a car

229
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,905
We need to send Priya to
the city fortreatment

230
00:22:38,506 --> 00:22:41,134
l'll go at night, sir.
l feel scared by day.

231
00:22:41,342 --> 00:22:42,138
What?

232
00:22:42,343 --> 00:22:44,140
Yes! Kalicharan's ghost.

233
00:22:44,345 --> 00:22:46,643
Scares people by day
and sleeps at night.

234
00:22:46,914 --> 00:22:47,812
Just imagine!

235
00:22:48,483 --> 00:22:49,450
Easy, easy

236
00:22:49,684 --> 00:22:51,811
Just relax. l'll organise a painkiller

237
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,317
C'mon guys. Let's go

238
00:23:16,477 --> 00:23:19,105
You're always screaming!
Doesn't yourthroat hurt?

239
00:23:20,481 --> 00:23:21,948
Your eyes are widening again!

240
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,281
You must never get scared...

241
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:31,787
What happened, Priya?
Why were you screaming?

242
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:35,622
Honey, he was here! ln this room!
He was here, Honey!

243
00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:38,130
Who...? Who was here?

244
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:40,634
The boy who saved me
on the tree...

245
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:42,462
the one l told you about, sir...

246
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,297
God! What's happened to this girl?

247
00:23:46,507 --> 00:23:50,136
Priya, it's just 2 seconds since l left...

248
00:23:50,411 --> 00:23:53,812
Are you saying that someone came
and even went away in the meantime...?

249
00:23:54,515 --> 00:23:56,312
You must've dozed off and
probably had a dream.

250
00:23:56,517 --> 00:23:59,975
l didn't dream! Why doesn't
someone believe me?

251
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,983
The moment l closed my eyes,
he entered the tent...

252
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,989
he twisted my ankle and the pain...

253
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,324
Hey! The pain in my ankle is gone! See!

254
00:24:11,699 --> 00:24:13,166
The pain has disappeared!

255
00:24:14,102 --> 00:24:16,662
Oh my God sir! My foot is all right!

256
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,836
Look at this... l can jump!

257
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,506
My foot has become all right

258
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,678
Eitherthis girl has really gone mad,
or she's conning us!

259
00:24:27,882 --> 00:24:33,013
No, sir! l'm not conning you! See...
l can jump! Believe me!

260
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:37,351
l believe you! Kalicharan has
cured yourfoot

261
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:38,320
Just imagine!

262
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,528
Kalicharan...? So this ghost
is also a doctor?

263
00:24:41,729 --> 00:24:42,696
Not is, was!

264
00:24:42,897 --> 00:24:46,196
Kalicharan's father, Lalcharan.
Doctor Lalcharan.

265
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:51,868
There's no Kalicharan, there's
no Lalcharan... it's a pack of lies!

266
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,705
lt's some stupid local boy
playing a prank on me

267
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:57,874
l'm going to find him today,
bring him before everybody...

268
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,206
and prove to them that he's
just another boy!

269
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,040
Are you looking for someone?

270
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,216
What...?

271
00:25:04,152 --> 00:25:06,052
You! l'm looking foryou!

272
00:25:07,321 --> 00:25:09,414
Where do you keep disappearing?

273
00:25:09,624 --> 00:25:12,320
Why don't you appear before others
as you appear before me?

274
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:15,885
And that stupid Bahadur keeps telling
them that you're a ghost!

275
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,731
You... you're not Kalicharan, are you?

276
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,565
You're human, aren't you?

277
00:25:26,774 --> 00:25:27,536
Why are you kids giggling ?

278
00:25:27,842 --> 00:25:30,333
Who are you talking to, aunty?

279
00:25:30,678 --> 00:25:34,705
Aunty...? Firstly you call me aunty and
then you ask who l am speaking to?

280
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:36,383
l'm talking to this boy!

281
00:25:36,918 --> 00:25:37,885
Which Boy?

282
00:25:38,753 --> 00:25:42,052
Can't you see this boy here...?

283
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:45,550
That's a lamppost there, not a Boy,

284
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,727
That's a boy

285
00:25:48,596 --> 00:25:49,392
Lamppost

286
00:25:49,597 --> 00:25:50,063
Boy!

287
00:25:50,264 --> 00:25:50,730
Lamppost!

288
00:25:50,932 --> 00:25:51,728
Shut up!

289
00:25:54,769 --> 00:25:56,396
One moment. Please Listen...

290
00:26:00,107 --> 00:26:02,905
What do you see there?
A boy? Or a lamppost?

291
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:07,077
Well... there's neither a boy
there nor a lamppost.

292
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:08,248
Look carefully...

293
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:16,414
What happened...?

294
00:26:18,025 --> 00:26:20,585
l'm feeling giddy.

295
00:26:21,028 --> 00:26:23,087
You seem unwell

296
00:26:23,431 --> 00:26:27,595
My house is nearby...
come rest there for a while

297
00:26:28,302 --> 00:26:29,269
l'll get you a glass of water

298
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:29,936
Okay!

299
00:26:38,613 --> 00:26:41,776
Why's his picture garlanded?

300
00:26:43,651 --> 00:26:48,611
My son. He died 20 years ago

301
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:54,628
But how's that possible...?
Moments ago, l...

302
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,847
lt's a tragic tale that took place
20 years ago

303
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,287
Champa and Kalicharan

304
00:27:24,992 --> 00:27:29,725
Kalicharan and Champa.
Madly in love with each other

305
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:32,397
They were like one soul two bodies.

306
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,897
And then one day...

307
00:27:34,602 --> 00:27:35,398
What happened?

308
00:27:35,603 --> 00:27:38,731
Kalicharan was putting some flowers
in Champa's hair...

309
00:27:39,941 --> 00:27:41,909
Lalcharan happened to see them.

310
00:27:42,443 --> 00:27:45,071
He went red with rage!

311
00:27:45,613 --> 00:27:53,418
And one day, he deceived Champa into
drinking poison, in the name of medicine

312
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:59,423
And poor Champa! She screamed,
''Kali, Kali...''

313
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:03,761
... and died. Just imagine!

314
00:28:04,298 --> 00:28:09,429
Kalicharan just could not bear
the pain of Champa's death

315
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:13,269
Overthere! Look at that peak!

316
00:28:13,474 --> 00:28:20,937
From that very peak, Kalicharan
screamed, ''Champa, Champa...''

317
00:28:21,148 --> 00:28:24,777
... and jumped to his death!

318
00:28:25,152 --> 00:28:32,149
Ever since, Kalicharan's spirit has
been looking for his Champa!

319
00:28:32,493 --> 00:28:35,951
Why're you pointing towards me?

320
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,628
Because you are his Champa

321
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:41,130
Me...? Champa!

322
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:43,296
l mean, you look like Champa

323
00:28:45,072 --> 00:28:48,303
l'm feeling terribly scared. We can't
stay here anymore, please

324
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:49,806
Nobody goes anywhere!

325
00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:55,975
This silly Bahadurtalks a lot of nonsense...

326
00:28:56,217 --> 00:28:57,809
...and you start imagining?

327
00:28:58,686 --> 00:29:03,646
Bahadur, you're not telling these kids
anymore stories. Understand?

328
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:08,821
And now get ready. We're going
mountain-climbing

329
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:19,506
You will use ascenders to climb...

330
00:29:21,108 --> 00:29:23,508
...descenders to come down.

331
00:29:23,778 --> 00:29:24,836
And you will come rappelling, down.

332
00:29:25,212 --> 00:29:26,338
'right sir.ok sir'

333
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:42,188
Ghost!

334
00:29:44,732 --> 00:29:45,198
Priya!

335
00:30:06,754 --> 00:30:07,379
What... what on earth is that?

336
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,887
Kalicharan!

337
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:12,885
Just imagine

338
00:30:14,095 --> 00:30:15,221
Can't imagine

339
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,398
Temperature. 104 degrees

340
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:23,727
We had told you sir.

341
00:30:24,271 --> 00:30:26,398
But you didn't listen.

342
00:30:27,274 --> 00:30:28,241
Sorry, sorry

343
00:30:29,977 --> 00:30:31,945
We're not staying here any more

344
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,408
Bahadur, leave immediately.

345
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:40,076
And arrange for
ourtransportation. Go!

346
00:30:41,856 --> 00:30:43,585
You've snatched my bread and butter.

347
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:46,089
l'm broke even before l could
make some money.

348
00:30:46,293 --> 00:30:47,260
Just imagine!

349
00:30:47,862 --> 00:30:52,458
Why did you climb the mountain
like that, in front of them?

350
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:56,268
What could l do? She screamed
so loudly...

351
00:30:57,471 --> 00:31:00,440
..that l got scared

352
00:31:00,808 --> 00:31:05,768
And now they are so scared,
that they're all going back.

353
00:31:06,247 --> 00:31:10,183
Now keep searching foryour
Champa all your life!

354
00:31:11,385 --> 00:31:14,183
What do we do, Bahadur?

355
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:18,284
How do l know? l did as you said

356
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:20,126
You think of a way now

357
00:31:23,564 --> 00:31:24,462
ldea!

358
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:25,131
What?

359
00:31:25,332 --> 00:31:26,128
Champa-ji...

360
00:31:30,838 --> 00:31:31,964
My name is Priya.

361
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:33,970
ln this lifetime

362
00:31:34,508 --> 00:31:38,467
ln your earlier six births you were
Kalicharan's Champa

363
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:40,146
This is your 7th birth.

364
00:31:40,347 --> 00:31:43,976
lf you leave without meeting him,
he'll be very angry...

365
00:31:44,185 --> 00:31:47,313
And he'll follow you
whereveryou go

366
00:31:47,588 --> 00:31:48,646
Just imagine!

367
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:53,149
How will he follow her?
We're going back to Singapore

368
00:31:53,394 --> 00:31:57,831
He can reach Singapore too!
He doesn't need airtickets

369
00:31:58,032 --> 00:32:01,832
Bahadur, she's not meeting any ghost!
What if something happens to her?

370
00:32:02,603 --> 00:32:07,165
This ghost is a gentleman, ma'am.
He hasn't harmed a soul

371
00:32:07,374 --> 00:32:07,999
Am l right?

372
00:32:08,609 --> 00:32:09,701
Yes

373
00:32:10,277 --> 00:32:12,677
l leave the rest to you

374
00:32:14,882 --> 00:32:15,678
Wait Bahadur!

375
00:32:19,053 --> 00:32:19,678
Honey...

376
00:32:19,887 --> 00:32:20,683
Yes?

377
00:32:21,555 --> 00:32:23,182
l think he's right

378
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,185
You're going to meet him?

379
00:32:25,492 --> 00:32:28,825
Yes. Only then will he find peace

380
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:31,189
And you better not stop her

381
00:32:31,632 --> 00:32:36,331
if Kalicharan gets to know...
just imagine!

382
00:32:36,637 --> 00:32:38,366
No! l wasn't stopping her!

383
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:41,699
l was only advising you, right...?

384
00:32:42,076 --> 00:32:47,036
Listen, you must meet the ghost.
He's such a gentleman!

385
00:32:47,314 --> 00:32:48,713
l'm off to sleep.
Bye, good night!

386
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:59,725
Champa... Champa...

387
00:33:27,821 --> 00:33:31,416
Hello! Kalicharan ji...

388
00:33:32,126 --> 00:33:33,093
Here l am...

389
00:33:33,961 --> 00:33:36,259
... to help you get peace

390
00:33:36,463 --> 00:33:38,931
Please... could you appear
before me?

391
00:33:44,972 --> 00:33:46,940
''l feel scared''

392
00:33:47,975 --> 00:33:50,102
Do ghosts also feel
scared nowadays?

393
00:33:55,149 --> 00:33:57,583
''l'm not a ghost''

394
00:33:58,986 --> 00:34:00,783
You aren't a ghost?

395
00:34:02,323 --> 00:34:04,120
Oh yes, l get it...

396
00:34:04,992 --> 00:34:08,450
it offends you when someone calls
you a ghost, isn't it?

397
00:34:09,163 --> 00:34:14,123
And you're right! You've ended
your life for love

398
00:34:14,401 --> 00:34:18,963
And those who end their lives
for love aren't ghosts...

399
00:34:19,506 --> 00:34:22,134
They are... they are...

400
00:34:23,177 --> 00:34:26,305
They're lovers! You're
a lover, aren't you?

401
00:34:27,348 --> 00:34:28,144
l'm Krishna

402
00:34:39,593 --> 00:34:42,323
Look... stay right there!

403
00:34:42,596 --> 00:34:44,325
Don't come closer, okay?

404
00:34:44,698 --> 00:34:47,326
You sent for me
and here l am.

405
00:34:47,868 --> 00:34:49,665
You'll get peace now

406
00:34:50,204 --> 00:34:51,171
May l go now?

407
00:34:51,538 --> 00:34:54,166
All l want is friendship

408
00:34:55,209 --> 00:34:56,335
Friendship...?

409
00:34:57,945 --> 00:35:01,676
Hey... don't be afraid.
l'm as human as you are

410
00:35:02,316 --> 00:35:04,978
Touch me if you can't
believe that.

411
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:06,677
Touch you?

412
00:35:11,225 --> 00:35:12,021
l'm sorry

413
00:35:14,728 --> 00:35:17,026
See? The colour of my blood
is red, too.

414
00:35:17,398 --> 00:35:19,025
Are you convinced now
that l'm not a ghost?

415
00:35:20,234 --> 00:35:23,863
lf you're not a ghost then
that picture?

416
00:35:24,972 --> 00:35:29,204
That's my father's photograph.
He's no more

417
00:35:29,576 --> 00:35:30,873
l look exactly like him.

418
00:35:31,979 --> 00:35:32,536
l see

419
00:35:33,747 --> 00:35:38,207
But the other day, how did you suddenly
get on that tree to save my life?

420
00:35:38,986 --> 00:35:42,217
And yesterday! How did you climb
that mountain so fast?

421
00:35:43,924 --> 00:35:46,392
Maybe because l've got used to it

422
00:35:48,162 --> 00:35:52,963
Right from my childhood, l've grown up
playing among the trees and mountains...

423
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:55,565
...with the birds and the animals.
l spend most of my time here

424
00:35:55,936 --> 00:35:57,961
l guess that's why they're my friends

425
00:35:59,273 --> 00:36:00,570
Would you like to
meet my friends?

426
00:36:19,793 --> 00:36:23,160
Wow! l still can't believe it!

427
00:36:24,131 --> 00:36:28,397
l won't let you poke that pin again!
lt hurts because l'm not Kalicharan.

428
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,940
See? He's not Kalicharan!
l've always been saying that!

429
00:36:38,178 --> 00:36:39,941
That's what you're still saying.

430
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,180
l'm Right!

431
00:36:49,623 --> 00:36:52,854
Kalicharan! You're so cute!

432
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:57,957
Krishna, you really got us scared.
But that was a nice prank.

433
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:02,298
Boys and girls,
camping continues!

434
00:37:03,003 --> 00:37:05,301
Krishna, you also join the group!

435
00:37:38,205 --> 00:37:39,001
Just imagine!

436
00:37:49,783 --> 00:37:51,011
C'mon! C'mon!

437
00:38:46,773 --> 00:38:47,740
Come

438
00:39:24,878 --> 00:39:27,278
From where are you getting a flower of
a new colour every time, Krishna?

439
00:39:27,481 --> 00:39:28,607
From the rainbow.

440
00:39:29,483 --> 00:39:31,280
The rainbow?

441
00:39:31,652 --> 00:39:32,619
Yes

442
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,946
Look

443
00:39:48,168 --> 00:39:51,968
Wow Krishna! lt's such
a beautiful sight

444
00:39:53,674 --> 00:39:57,633
Had l not come here, l'd really
have regretted it

445
00:39:59,246 --> 00:40:00,304
So would l

446
00:40:04,918 --> 00:40:07,148
l've never seen such a lovely place.

447
00:40:08,922 --> 00:40:15,157
lt's so beautiful. So pure,
so serene, so quiet

448
00:40:16,363 --> 00:40:17,830
You should see this place in autumn.

449
00:40:18,932 --> 00:40:20,331
lt's a riot of colours

450
00:40:21,268 --> 00:40:25,170
When the sunrays touch the
fallen leaves, everything turns to gold

451
00:40:25,706 --> 00:40:26,832
lt's so beautiful

452
00:40:27,874 --> 00:40:30,536
Makes you realise what
a great artist God really is

453
00:40:31,445 --> 00:40:34,744
Krishna, you speak English?

454
00:40:35,382 --> 00:40:36,849
And with such fluency?

455
00:40:37,884 --> 00:40:43,186
Grandma taught me. She's my
school, my college and my university

456
00:40:43,724 --> 00:40:47,683
But you need talent to
learn anything, Krishna

457
00:40:47,894 --> 00:40:49,521
And you possess amazing talent.

458
00:40:49,896 --> 00:40:51,022
You're amazing!

459
00:40:51,965 --> 00:40:55,366
You shouldn't be wasting your
talent in this remote village

460
00:40:55,569 --> 00:40:57,366
You ought to get out of here.

461
00:40:57,738 --> 00:40:59,365
People in the world out there...

462
00:40:59,573 --> 00:41:03,202
...not just need talented people
like you, they appreciate them too

463
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:07,877
But my grandma is my world

464
00:41:09,082 --> 00:41:11,880
l will never leave her.

465
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,547
You love your grandma
very much?

466
00:41:16,556 --> 00:41:17,955
More than very much

467
00:41:18,091 --> 00:41:20,491
Krishna, l want to meet
your grandma

Grandma... this is Priya.

493
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:04,005
Hello, Grandma

494
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,507
We've met before.

495
00:46:05,845 --> 00:46:08,006
l remember. Tell me something...

496
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,983
Why did you go away, the other day?

497
00:46:11,284 --> 00:46:13,184
l fled, grandma! Out of fright

498
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,580
Krishna was playing a ghost
to scare us

499
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:17,757
Ghost...?

500
00:46:23,596 --> 00:46:27,930
And that well-built Komal Sir
was trembling in his boots!

501
00:46:28,101 --> 00:46:30,899
He was down with 104 degrees fever!

502
00:46:31,738 --> 00:46:32,705
What? 104 degrees?

503
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,532
ls that true, Krishna?

504
00:46:35,475 --> 00:46:37,739
You shouldn't play such pranks
on anyone, my son

505
00:46:38,078 --> 00:46:39,568
Why scare someone so much?

506
00:46:39,846 --> 00:46:43,543
Did you apologise?

507
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,048
Yes, Grandma. To everybody

508
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:59,161
Priya ... tell me something about yourself

509
00:46:59,999 --> 00:47:02,627
l live in Singapore with my Mother.

510
00:47:03,636 --> 00:47:05,103
My father is no more

511
00:47:05,705 --> 00:47:07,969
l'm here in lndia on a vacation
with my friend...

512

Priya, for how many more days

516
00:47:48,481 --> 00:47:51,006
Days...? we're leaving today.

517
00:47:51,484 --> 00:47:52,451
ln fact, right now

518
00:47:53,253 --> 00:47:55,312
Oh my God! l must leave now.

519
00:47:55,522 --> 00:47:57,285
Everyone must be waiting for me.

520

to serve you again

523
00:48:05,999 --> 00:48:06,624
Where's Priya?

524
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:07,663
There she is!

525
00:48:07,867 --> 00:48:09,129
Hurry, we've got to leave.

526
00:48:09,402 --> 00:48:10,699
C'mon, everybody! Get in!

527
00:48:11,004 --> 00:48:12,904
Nice meeting you.

528
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,703
we really enjoyed your
company, Krishna.

529
00:48:15,909 --> 00:48:17,137
We'd love to come back.

530
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:18,943
lt was great fun, Krishna.

531
00:48:24,184 --> 00:48:25,242
Thanks, Krishna!

532
00:48:25,852 --> 00:48:27,649
l had a wonderful time with you.

533
00:48:28,555 --> 00:48:31,581
l didn't even realize how ten days
have passed by

534
00:48:31,991 --> 00:48:32,787
Really!

535
00:48:33,526 --> 00:48:35,255
l'm going to miss this place...

536
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,057
And you, too.

537
00:48:39,732 --> 00:48:41,393
Look afteryourself, Kalicharan.

538
00:48:43,203 --> 00:48:44,500
l have to go now.

539
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,807
May l?

540
00:48:51,544 --> 00:48:52,511
May l go?

541
00:48:55,715 --> 00:48:59,708
Krishna, how will she go,
if you don't leave her hand?

542
00:49:04,357 --> 00:49:05,415
Bye, Krishna

543
00:49:06,593 --> 00:49:07,389
Bye

544
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:29,276
Priya... See!

545
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,347
Looks like you're no longer Priya.
You've become Radha.

546
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:08,882
Krishna's Radha.

547
00:50:10,857 --> 00:50:11,585
What?

548
00:50:12,392 --> 00:50:17,022
l seriously think Krishna has
fallen in love with you.

549
00:50:23,803 --> 00:50:24,997
l hope not...

550
00:50:53,566 --> 00:50:57,593
Honey, pray that the boss' mood is ok,
we're five days late.

551
00:51:05,578 --> 00:51:07,136
Hi! Honey. Hi! Priya

552
00:51:09,515 --> 00:51:11,039
We are saying hi to them,

553
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,683
Why're they waving five fingers at us?

554
00:51:12,885 --> 00:51:15,479
Stupid! The five fingers
stand forfive days.

555
00:51:15,688 --> 00:51:17,656
Oh my God! You mean boss too...

556
00:51:22,695 --> 00:51:24,458
You took a leave of 15 days...

557
00:51:24,797 --> 00:51:26,424
...and have come after 20!

558
00:51:26,966 --> 00:51:29,992
So you girls are now fired!

559
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:34,701
Why just lndia?
Go on a world tour! Go!

560
00:51:38,444 --> 00:51:39,308
Stop, Priya.

561
00:51:40,713 --> 00:51:43,739
Sorry boss, but you can't insult us.

562
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:45,642
Yeah?

563
00:51:45,885 --> 00:51:46,715
Yeah!

564
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:52,356
Boss, you can't question
our integrity.

565
00:51:52,558 --> 00:51:54,492
Agreed we were on a leave
of 15 days

566
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:58,790
But on the 16th day we got to work

567
00:51:59,799 --> 00:52:01,767
What amazing work have you done?

568
00:52:01,968 --> 00:52:04,869
We have found an lndian superboy.

569
00:52:05,071 --> 00:52:06,698
Honey! What are you saying?

570
00:52:06,906 --> 00:52:08,464
Let me speak, please.

571
00:52:08,808 --> 00:52:14,269
Boss, this boy scales high mountains
as if they were mere steps for him!

572
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:16,309
He runs fasterthan a horse!

573
00:52:16,582 --> 00:52:17,480
And guess what?

574
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:20,218
He puts his hand in the river
and pulls out fish!

575
00:52:22,989 --> 00:52:28,552
Just think of it, if a boy as talented
as him were to come here...

576
00:52:29,262 --> 00:52:33,221
...your rating's are going to soar!
Just imagine!

577
00:52:35,601 --> 00:52:39,901
l hope you're not trying to make
a fool out of me?

578
00:52:40,606 --> 00:52:45,066
No way, boss!
You will believe it too...

579
00:52:45,278 --> 00:52:49,715
...when you see him doing all those
incredible things here!

580
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:53,750
See him here! How? How's he going
to come here?

581
00:52:54,687 --> 00:52:57,747
l tried to stop you, but you just
wouldn't listen!

582
00:52:58,424 --> 00:53:03,828
Please, Priya! There was no other way
of saving our job.

583
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:07,466
Besides, what's wrong if Krishna
comes here?

584
00:53:07,667 --> 00:53:09,430
There you go again!

585
00:53:09,635 --> 00:53:11,432
Relax! Sit down

586
00:53:11,737 --> 00:53:16,174
lf Krishna's talents are
showcased on our channel...

587
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:19,538
...he'd be the one who'd gain.
Name, fame, money...

588
00:53:19,745 --> 00:53:23,340
He'll have everything!
He'll be a big man!

589
00:53:23,549 --> 00:53:24,675
Just think!

590
00:53:27,753 --> 00:53:29,414
l know you're right, Honey...

591
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:33,488
...but Krishna will never leave
his grandma and come.

592
00:53:34,827 --> 00:53:36,419
She is his world.

593
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:40,299
But now you are a part
of his world too.

594
00:53:41,834 --> 00:53:46,965
l know. Now do as l say.

595
00:53:47,173 --> 00:53:49,573
Call for Krishna!

596
00:53:51,177 --> 00:53:52,474

598
00:53:57,016 --> 00:53:59,484
Krishna, phone

He's coming!

600
00:54:03,556 --> 00:54:04,488
Who's coming?

601
00:54:04,857 --> 00:54:09,089
A boy? ls he an lndian?
Does he live here in Singapore?

602
00:54:09,428 --> 00:54:11,328
Have you finally chosen
someone, Priya?

603
00:54:11,531 --> 00:54:14,227
There you go again, Mom!
l haven't chosen anyone

604
00:54:14,433 --> 00:54:15,525
So choose one!

605
00:54:15,735 --> 00:54:16,394
l will...

606
00:54:16,602 --> 00:54:18,729
...please leave now,

607
00:54:18,938 --> 00:54:19,734
And when will you settle down?

608
00:54:19,939 --> 00:54:20,530
Tomorrow

609
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,105
Call from Priya!

610
00:54:22,808 --> 00:54:23,604
Priya?

611
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:25,338
Hello, Krishna...

612
00:54:25,545 --> 00:54:26,239
Priya...

613
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:28,744
How are you?

614
00:54:29,448 --> 00:54:32,178
l'm fine, but l don't like anything

615
00:54:33,452 --> 00:54:34,350
Me too

616
00:54:35,888 --> 00:54:37,412

Me too

620
00:54:46,933 --> 00:54:49,663
He's not saying anything more than
'' Me too '', so what do l do?

621
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:51,962
You continue reading,
read from here!

622
00:54:52,972 --> 00:54:54,667
Priya, why are you quiet?

623
00:54:55,341 --> 00:54:58,868
Krishna, can't you come here
and meet my mother?

624
00:54:59,312 --> 00:55:00,142
Your mother?

625
00:55:00,346 --> 00:55:03,372
Yes, if you don't meet my mother...

626
00:55:03,583 --> 00:55:06,313
...she'll get me married to
someone else.

627
00:55:07,587 --> 00:55:08,554
Someone else?

628
00:55:09,155 --> 00:55:11,214
No, l won't let that happen!

629
00:55:11,424 --> 00:55:13,858
l'm coming there, Priya!

630

631
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,793
Yes... how will you get here?

632
00:55:23,769 --> 00:55:27,535
Hello, Krishna! Don't worry.
Just give the phone to Bahadur?

633
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:47,924
Krishna! Aircraft! Singapore!
Priya Ma'am!

634
00:55:48,127 --> 00:55:49,958

635

00:58:47,573 --> 00:58:51,771
''The world didn't matterto them
anymore''

649
00:58:53,646 --> 00:58:57,844
''There was a boy
and there was a girl...''

650
00:58:59,618 --> 00:59:04,954
''she smiled, he smiled...''

651
00:59:05,157 --> 00:59:11,528
''little did they know what
was happening''

652
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:16,064
''Come, let me tell you a love story''

653
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:22,630
''There was a boy and there was a girl...''

654
00:59:35,221 --> 00:59:40,887
''There was no yearning,
there was no aching...''

655
00:59:41,093 --> 00:59:47,726
''they came together...
their hearts skipped a beat''

656
00:59:53,205 --> 00:59:58,939
''There was no yearning,
there was no aching...''

657
00:59:59,144 --> 01:00:06,016
''they came together... their hearts
skipped a beat''

658
01:00:08,387 --> 01:00:14,087
''What was destined happened...''

659
01:00:14,293 --> 01:00:22,200
''They got lost in love''

660
01:00:23,235 --> 01:00:26,727
''They got lost in love''

661
01:00:29,842 --> 01:00:33,869
''Oh, how one heart ruled the other!''

662
01:00:35,681 --> 01:00:40,414
''There was a boy and there was a girl...''

663
01:00:49,094 --> 01:00:49,617
Grandma!

664
01:00:49,828 --> 01:00:50,886
l am here

665
01:00:51,096 --> 01:00:52,563
Grandma!

666
01:00:53,766 --> 01:00:55,893
Grandma!

667
01:00:56,101 --> 01:00:56,897
Put me down

668
01:01:00,005 --> 01:01:01,131
What's the matter, Krishna?

669
01:01:01,941 --> 01:01:03,306
You look very happy today.

670
01:01:03,943 --> 01:01:06,070
Grandma, l got a call from Priya!

671
01:01:06,445 --> 01:01:08,413
You told me that she'd forget me?

672
01:01:08,781 --> 01:01:11,579
But it's not true, Grandma!
She misses me every moment.

673
01:01:11,784 --> 01:01:14,912
She's always thinking of me!
And she keeps seeing me everywhere!

674
01:01:17,456 --> 01:01:20,425
And l nevertold you...

675
01:01:23,329 --> 01:01:24,762
...l've been in a similar state.

676
01:01:26,298 --> 01:01:29,324
Ever since Priya has left,
l never liked anything.

677
01:01:31,236 --> 01:01:34,763
But today with her call,
l feel better.

678
01:01:35,574 --> 01:01:37,940
Grandma, Priya has called me
to Singapore

679
01:01:38,143 --> 01:01:39,610
She wants me to meet her mother.

680
01:01:40,145 --> 01:01:40,770
Her mother?

681
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:41,605
Yes

682
01:01:41,814 --> 01:01:42,610
lf l don't go and ask for her hand...

683
01:01:42,815 --> 01:01:45,613
...her mother's going to get her
married to someone else

684
01:01:46,986 --> 01:01:49,113
l said l wouldn't let that happen,
l'm coming.

685
01:01:51,056 --> 01:01:53,957
l did the right thing, didn't l Grandma?
May l go, Grandma?

686
01:02:01,166 --> 01:02:02,793
lt's only a matter of a few days, grandma

687
01:02:03,002 --> 01:02:06,301
l'll ask for Priya's hand in marriage
and bring her back with me

688
01:02:08,841 --> 01:02:09,899
May l go, Grandma?

689
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,204
You're not answering, Grandma

690
01:02:18,951 --> 01:02:21,476
When you've already decided to go...

691
01:02:22,755 --> 01:02:24,882
...why ask me?

692
01:02:25,858 --> 01:02:28,656
Go on. Go.

693
01:02:29,628 --> 01:02:30,822
You aren't happy, Grandma?

694
01:02:32,131 --> 01:02:34,497
Don't you like Priya?

695
01:02:36,301 --> 01:02:37,495
l like Priya...

696
01:02:39,038 --> 01:02:41,404
...but l don't like the idea
of you going so far.

697
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:44,934
lf Priya really loves you...

698
01:02:45,878 --> 01:02:48,506
...she can also come here
with her mother

699
01:02:49,715 --> 01:02:51,239
But you're not going there!

700
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:52,781
Why not?

701
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:58,187
l said you're not going,
it means you're not going

702
01:03:00,225 --> 01:03:00,850
That's it!

703
01:03:01,226 --> 01:03:04,024
But why can't l go?
What's going to happen?

704
01:03:04,897 --> 01:03:06,023
l've been hearing this since l was a child!

705
01:03:06,231 --> 01:03:08,859
Don't go here, don't go there,
don't do this, don't do that...

706
01:03:09,068 --> 01:03:10,535
...don't go to the city with yourfriends!

707
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:13,866
Forget the city, you don't even
allow me to go beyond the river...

708
01:03:14,106 --> 01:03:14,800
Why?

709
01:03:18,077 --> 01:03:23,310
Now you've become so big that
l have to give explanations to you?

710
01:03:28,087 --> 01:03:29,714
You'll have to tell today, Grandma!

711
01:03:30,923 --> 01:03:32,117
Why do you keep stopping me?

712
01:03:32,591 --> 01:03:33,785
Why can't l go anywhere?

713
01:03:36,095 --> 01:03:39,394
Because l don't want to lose you

714
01:03:40,432 --> 01:03:41,729
So what do you want then?

715
01:03:42,101 --> 01:03:45,468
Cut me off from the world and
keep looking at yourface forever?

716
01:03:46,004 --> 01:03:47,904
Bang my head on trees
and mountains all my life...?

717
01:03:48,107 --> 01:03:50,405
You want me to be alone all my life?
ls that what you want?

718
01:03:57,783 --> 01:04:01,412
But l can't do l that, Grandma!
l have my own life too...

719
01:04:01,787 --> 01:04:05,086
...my own dreams. l too want to
achieve something!

720
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:06,757
l want an identity for myself!

721
01:04:11,196 --> 01:04:15,098
You don't want to lose me,
even if l have to lose Priya

722
01:04:16,301 --> 01:04:18,428
You can't see me happy

723
01:04:19,972 --> 01:04:24,432
l have always obeyed you.
And you can't agree to my one request?

724
01:04:25,811 --> 01:04:28,109
Today l realize, how selfish you are!

725
01:04:29,648 --> 01:04:32,617
You only think of yourself!
Only yourself!

726
01:04:33,652 --> 01:04:35,620
You don't care for me!

727
01:04:36,321 --> 01:04:39,950
Had my parents been alive,
they'd have understood my feelings!

728
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:42,127
They'd have let me go,
they wouldn't have stopped me!

729
01:04:52,604 --> 01:04:55,300
l wish your parents were alive.

730
01:04:57,342 --> 01:04:58,639
l wish!

731
01:05:27,372 --> 01:05:28,236
l'm sorry, Grandma.

732
01:05:39,952 --> 01:05:42,011
See these stars, Krishna...

733
01:05:45,023 --> 01:05:49,790
...with these infinite
twinkling stars in the sky...

734
01:05:50,662 --> 01:05:56,623
...you, yourfather, your grandfather...

735
01:05:56,835 --> 01:05:58,769
...and l share a very deep relationship.

736
01:06:01,907 --> 01:06:04,205
Your grandfather was a space scientist

737
01:06:05,344 --> 01:06:11,772
One night, he started receiving a reply
to a signal he had sent to outer space

738
01:06:12,517 --> 01:06:14,610
Suddenly, we saw a flying saucer in the sky...

739
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:16,879
...the car swerved out of control

740
01:06:17,089 --> 01:06:19,887
l survived the accident...

741
01:06:20,259 --> 01:06:21,556
...but your grandfather.

742
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:29,624
l was pregnant with Rohit at that time...

743
01:06:31,536 --> 01:06:34,061
...he had sustained a head injury
in the accident...

744
01:06:35,274 --> 01:06:37,401
...because of which he was born abnormal.

745
01:06:38,877 --> 01:06:43,746
...even when he grew up,
he had the l.Q. of a child.

746
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:49,753
One night, in our small town,
a huge spaceship descended.

747
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:54,249
Some Aliens emerged from it...

748
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,258
...but one could not go back.

749
01:06:58,297 --> 01:07:02,097
And that is how Rohit met Jadoo.

750
01:07:03,468 --> 01:07:06,767
Jadoo had supernatural powers...

751
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,941
...which he passed on to Rohit.

752
01:07:12,044 --> 01:07:14,035
Rohit changed completely.

753
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:17,104
Jadoo eventually went away...

754
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:23,553
...but he did not take back the powers
he had given to Rohit.

755
01:07:24,823 --> 01:07:29,624
And thereafter, everything changed forever.

756
01:07:30,996 --> 01:07:37,902
My son could do things that were impossible
for an ordinary human being.

757
01:07:41,173 --> 01:07:43,835
lt was around then that Rohit
married your mother.

758
01:07:45,277 --> 01:07:50,715
And very soon, his fame spread
across the world.

759
01:07:52,351 --> 01:07:56,481
The chairman of the world's largest
lnformation Technology Company...

760
01:07:57,522 --> 01:07:59,319
...invited Rohit abroad.

761
01:08:07,866 --> 01:08:08,491
Thank You.

762
01:08:15,474 --> 01:08:16,771
Welcome to Technotronics.

763
01:08:17,876 --> 01:08:18,672
Come with me, Sir

764
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:29,847
Dr Arya shall be here shortly

765
01:08:48,407 --> 01:08:49,806
Mr. Rohit Mehra?

766
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:53,537
l'm sorry to keep you waiting

767
01:08:54,246 --> 01:08:55,213
lt's all right, Sir.

768
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:56,547
l was, this book...

769
01:08:56,748 --> 01:09:02,380
Oh yes, that's the first copy of
my latest book.

770
01:09:02,821 --> 01:09:04,789
Please read it and give your opinion.

771
01:09:05,257 --> 01:09:08,124
lt's a wonderful book, Sir.
You've done a lot of research.

772
01:09:08,927 --> 01:09:11,395
How can you say that without reading it?

773
01:09:11,596 --> 01:09:12,654
l've already read it, Sir.

774
01:09:14,766 --> 01:09:15,733
Read it?

775
01:09:17,602 --> 01:09:21,538
There are printing errors on
page 126, 244 and 354

776
01:09:22,174 --> 01:09:23,072
l've marked them.

777
01:09:23,842 --> 01:09:28,472
You've read this 400 page book
in just 10 minutes?

778
01:09:32,451 --> 01:09:35,011
l forgot who l was talking to.

779
01:09:35,153 --> 01:09:39,249
Asking you such questions is
an insult to yourtalent.

780
01:09:40,192 --> 01:09:41,921
lt's an honourto meet you.

781
01:09:43,128 --> 01:09:44,356
The honour is mine, Sir.

782
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:46,924
l still can't believe...

783
01:09:47,299 --> 01:09:50,097
...that l'm standing face to face with a
great scientist and innovator like you.

784
01:09:50,969 --> 01:09:52,937
Your achievements in the field of
wireless communication...

785
01:09:53,138 --> 01:09:54,935
...is no less than a revolution, Sir.

786
01:09:55,373 --> 01:09:58,570
You've invented the palmtop.

787
01:09:59,177 --> 01:10:03,341
People can watch cricket matches
on their phones, thanks to you.

788
01:10:06,818 --> 01:10:10,948
l have a new dream, Rohit. A new vision...

789
01:10:11,823 --> 01:10:19,730
...lf this dream comes true, it could change
the destiny of the world.

790
01:10:21,166 --> 01:10:24,795
And l need your help to realise this dream.

791
01:10:26,505 --> 01:10:32,137
l want to build a computer
that can see the future.

792
01:10:32,344 --> 01:10:33,743
That can see the future.

793
01:10:36,748 --> 01:10:37,476
Future?

794
01:10:39,918 --> 01:10:41,385
What would you like, tea or coffee?

795
01:10:50,095 --> 01:10:53,326
l understand your dream, your vision, Sir.

796
01:10:55,133 --> 01:10:59,661
You want to combine astrology,
astronomy and technology...

797
01:11:00,138 --> 01:11:03,665
...to build a computerthat can see the future.

798
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:07,572
Exactly! That's precisely
why l've called you here.

799
01:11:08,446 --> 01:11:12,007
Because the people l have here are trained...

800
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:15,016
...not gifted like you.

801
01:11:29,501 --> 01:11:30,866
What are you thinking, Rohit?

802
01:11:32,637 --> 01:11:40,134
Sir, if we can really build a computer
that can see the future then...

803
01:11:40,345 --> 01:11:46,215
Then, think of the good we can do
forthis planet and mankind!

804
01:11:46,418 --> 01:11:47,715
Wars can be prevented

805
01:11:47,919 --> 01:11:51,980
Earthquakes, famines, floods,
can be prevented.

806
01:11:52,190 --> 01:11:55,057
Even if we can't prevent them,
we can at least be prepared forthem.

807
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:58,388
You've already started
seeing the future, Rohit.

808
01:11:59,431 --> 01:12:00,227
Welcome!

809
01:12:01,099 --> 01:12:07,060
ln the hope that this union of brilliance
and vision will become history.

810
01:12:07,939 --> 01:12:09,406
Create history!

811
01:12:13,211 --> 01:12:14,974
lt took him two whole years...

812
01:12:16,648 --> 01:12:20,744
...but Rohit achieved the impossible...

813
01:12:22,287 --> 01:12:27,088
...he built a computer
that could see the future...

814
01:12:29,894 --> 01:12:33,421
...lt was around the time
when you were going to be born.

815
01:12:33,798 --> 01:12:36,426
Hello?- Mom?

816
01:12:36,635 --> 01:12:38,262
Rohit, l've brought Nisha to the hospital.

817
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:39,596
That's where l'm calling from.

818
01:12:39,904 --> 01:12:42,873
Congratulations! You're going to
become a father anytime.

819
01:12:44,709 --> 01:12:46,336
Come back soon.

820
01:12:46,544 --> 01:12:48,603
l'm coming, Mom...l'm coming!

821
01:12:50,649 --> 01:12:55,609
Rohit? What's the matter?
You sound tense.

822
01:12:55,887 --> 01:12:59,948
l've been exploited. The world is very selfish

823
01:13:00,325 --> 01:13:03,692
But don't worry! l'll be back soon!

824
01:13:04,996 --> 01:13:07,123
But my son did not come back.

825
01:13:09,901 --> 01:13:14,361
Moments afteryou were born,
we received word

826
01:13:16,775 --> 01:13:18,970
...that a fire broke out in the lab...

827
01:13:20,945 --> 01:13:25,973
...and they couldn't save Rohit.

828
01:13:29,788 --> 01:13:32,313
Your mother couldn't bearthe shock...

829
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:36,916
...and passed away in a few days.

830
01:13:40,699 --> 01:13:42,326
When you were five years old...

831
01:13:44,536 --> 01:13:49,337
...l got to know that you too were
born with extraordinary powers...

832
01:13:49,774 --> 01:13:54,177
...that Rohit had. l got scared.

833
01:13:55,547 --> 01:14:03,352
l didn't want the world to know about you.

834
01:14:04,322 --> 01:14:07,291
And that's why l brought you here...

835
01:14:08,226 --> 01:14:09,853
...a place where nobody knew us.

836
01:14:12,063 --> 01:14:16,523
l didn't want to lose you at any cost, Krishna.

837
01:14:20,438 --> 01:14:22,463
You no longer want to see my face...

838
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:28,868
...but l'm living only foryou, Krishna

839
01:14:33,017 --> 01:14:38,319
Yes, l'm selfish, very selfish.

840
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:16,984
Grandma? What are you doing?

841
01:15:18,396 --> 01:15:20,762
l've taken out some of
yourfather's clothes.

842
01:15:21,966 --> 01:15:25,094
You can't go to Singapore like this!

843
01:15:28,473 --> 01:15:30,771
But Grandma?

844
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:36,606
l could shield you from the world...

845
01:15:37,816 --> 01:15:39,340
...but not your heart.

846
01:15:40,485 --> 01:15:44,785
Go, bring Priya here.

847
01:15:48,827 --> 01:15:50,055
Krishna...

848
01:15:53,164 --> 01:15:54,722
...stay carefully there

849
01:15:55,500 --> 01:16:00,460
Eat and sleep on time,
don't talk too much with anybody.

850
01:16:01,339 --> 01:16:03,136
And don't get into any trouble...

851
01:16:04,075 --> 01:16:08,273
...whateveryou do, make sure you
behave like any other man.

852
01:16:09,681 --> 01:16:15,244
Don't get carried away to do things
that make people realise...

853
01:16:17,288 --> 01:16:20,314
Who l am? Right, Grandma?

854
01:16:21,926 --> 01:16:22,824
Yes, my son.

855
01:16:24,195 --> 01:16:26,163
Don't worry, Grandma.

856
01:16:27,131 --> 01:16:29,497
l won't let anybody know about me.

857
01:16:30,468 --> 01:16:36,168
l'll keep my strength, my abilities
and my talent... hidden.

858
01:16:40,211 --> 01:16:41,678
That's a promise, Grandma.

859
01:17:12,243 --> 01:17:14,211
Welcome to Singapore, Sir.
- Thank you.

860
01:17:15,079 --> 01:17:19,379
Your welcome sounds different...
and nicer, today.

861
01:18:05,129 --> 01:18:05,754
Good afternoon, sir.

862
01:18:05,964 --> 01:18:07,761
A very good afternoon, Dr. Mathur.

863
01:18:10,802 --> 01:18:13,100
But sir...
-Yes, yes, l know...

864
01:18:13,304 --> 01:18:17,331
l've come a few days in advance.
But l couldn't help it.

865
01:18:17,542 --> 01:18:18,531
l've waited so many years...

866
01:18:18,743 --> 01:18:21,371
...but now that we're so close to success...

867
01:18:21,646 --> 01:18:25,776
...being patient is very difficult.

868
01:18:26,317 --> 01:18:29,286
Must say you and yourteam deserve credit...

869
01:18:29,487 --> 01:18:32,285
...for making my dream come true again.

870
01:18:32,991 --> 01:18:35,892
Sir, the credit goes to Rohit Mehra...

871
01:18:36,594 --> 01:18:39,461
lf it wasn't for his notes and research...

872
01:18:39,998 --> 01:18:42,466
...it was impossible to build
that computer again.

873
01:18:43,835 --> 01:18:47,134
Absolute genius!-You're right, sir

874
01:18:48,006 --> 01:18:50,474
The computerthat Rohit made in 2 years...

875
01:18:50,675 --> 01:18:52,802
...has taken us so many years to make.

876
01:18:55,279 --> 01:18:58,146
That's why l still miss him.

877
01:19:00,084 --> 01:19:00,982
Excuse me

878
01:19:19,704 --> 01:19:26,041
People say ''Who has seen the future?''

879
01:19:28,146 --> 01:19:33,049
But in a few days, you and l...

880
01:19:33,885 --> 01:19:38,788
...will change this forever.

881
01:19:40,658 --> 01:19:43,286
Breaking news!

882
01:19:43,528 --> 01:19:46,793
Afteryears of struggle, hard work,
research and patience...

883
01:19:46,964 --> 01:19:52,994
...Dr. Siddhant Arya's most ambitious project
is about to be completed.

884
01:19:53,571 --> 01:19:57,507
According to our correspondent,
in just a few days...

885
01:19:57,709 --> 01:20:01,839
...Dr Arya will be able to predict the future of
individuals, countries and the world!

886
01:20:02,046 --> 01:20:04,105
He'll also be able to change the
course of their destinies.

887
01:20:04,315 --> 01:20:07,751
And the truth is, one who can see
and change the future...

888
01:20:07,952 --> 01:20:10,318
...is considered like God!

889
01:20:12,757 --> 01:20:13,917
Wrong!

890
01:20:15,626 --> 01:20:18,424
Not Like God...

891
01:20:19,197 --> 01:20:22,166
He is God!

892
01:20:23,968 --> 01:20:27,802
l will be God.

893
01:20:28,806 --> 01:20:32,071
Now no one can stop me.

894
01:21:06,978 --> 01:21:09,742
We're already late and then
this is how you park the car?

895
01:21:09,981 --> 01:21:11,881
l can't even open the door!
How am l going to get out?

896
01:21:12,116 --> 01:21:14,050
But neither can l!

897
01:21:14,152 --> 01:21:19,317
Great! Let's just sit in the car
and stare at each other!

898
01:21:19,524 --> 01:21:22,288
You always mess things up!
Krishna's flight must have landed...

899
01:21:22,493 --> 01:21:24,586
...he must be looking for us.

900
01:21:51,122 --> 01:21:52,589
l'm sorry, Sir!

901
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:54,451
You're not hurt, are you?

902
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:16,274
Krishna

903
01:22:24,088 --> 01:22:27,888
Krishna, you're looking
is so good in these clothes.

904
01:22:30,127 --> 01:22:31,253
They are my fathers.

905
01:22:32,597 --> 01:22:36,158
Krishna, welcome to Singapore!

906
01:22:36,567 --> 01:22:39,730
O my god! You look so handsome!

907
01:22:40,771 --> 01:22:42,500
You two have come alone?

908
01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:44,971
How can two people be 'alone'?

909
01:22:45,176 --> 01:22:49,408
No! l mean, hasn't your mother
come with you?

910
01:22:49,614 --> 01:22:50,410
Mother?

911
01:22:50,781 --> 01:22:52,078
ls she also coming here?

912
01:22:52,450 --> 01:22:53,576
lt would've been nice if she were here.

913
01:22:53,951 --> 01:22:58,183
l'd have asked foryour hand and
gone back to lndia immediately.

914
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:00,152
Grandma's all alone, you see.

915
01:23:01,325 --> 01:23:02,758
He's in a tearing hurry!

916
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:05,224
Has he brought a priest along to
solemnise the wedding?

917
01:23:05,429 --> 01:23:06,020
Shut up!

918
01:23:07,064 --> 01:23:07,530
What happened?

919
01:23:07,732 --> 01:23:11,463
Well actually, Mom, you know...

920
01:23:11,669 --> 01:23:13,364
Her mom's gone.

921
01:23:13,571 --> 01:23:14,595
Yeah she's gone...

922
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:15,697
Gone?

923
01:23:16,407 --> 01:23:17,897
To Hong Kong

924
01:23:18,109 --> 01:23:18,871
Yes, Hong Kong!

925
01:23:19,076 --> 01:23:19,770
Hong Kong?

926
01:23:20,511 --> 01:23:22,536
She'll be back in 10-15 days

927
01:23:22,747 --> 01:23:23,873
Yes, she'll come.

928
01:23:24,081 --> 01:23:28,245
10-15 days? But what will l do here
for so many days?

929
01:23:28,486 --> 01:23:32,547
Why Krishna? Didn't you take us around
your village when we came there?

930
01:23:32,757 --> 01:23:34,588
Now we'll show you our city.

931
01:23:38,195 --> 01:23:39,423
This is your apartment.

932
01:23:39,864 --> 01:23:41,627
This is your living room.

933
01:23:41,933 --> 01:23:43,798
This is your bedroom

934
01:23:44,101 --> 01:23:46,126
And these clothes are foryou

935
01:23:46,337 --> 01:23:47,861
This is your cell phone.

936
01:23:48,372 --> 01:23:49,964
lt has all our numbers.

937
01:23:50,341 --> 01:23:52,366
You can call us anytime.

938
01:23:54,845 --> 01:23:58,303
But why can't l live with you
in your house, Priya?

939
01:23:59,717 --> 01:24:00,547
Well...

940
01:24:00,918 --> 01:24:03,318
Because mom...
- ...is not around

941
01:24:03,521 --> 01:24:05,785
Yes! Mom's not around
wouldn't be proper

942
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:10,985
Hey! My phone is ringing!

943
01:24:11,662 --> 01:24:13,493
lt says 'Mama' how do l take the call?

944
01:24:13,931 --> 01:24:16,991
Looks like l gave you my cell phone
by mistake, Excuse me.

945
01:24:17,234 --> 01:24:19,464
Hello Priya, l have good news!

946
01:24:19,870 --> 01:24:21,303
l've found a boy foryou.

947
01:24:21,505 --> 01:24:23,939
l'm busy right now.
l'll call you later, Mama.

948
01:24:24,141 --> 01:24:25,665
lt was your mom's call?
Let me say hello to her.

949
01:24:25,876 --> 01:24:27,434
No, it wasn't mom

950
01:24:27,645 --> 01:24:30,136
lt was my uncle.

951
01:24:30,982 --> 01:24:32,210
l could've said hello to him.

952
01:24:32,416 --> 01:24:33,781
Does he live here too?

953
01:24:33,985 --> 01:24:34,679
Yes...

954
01:24:35,419 --> 01:24:37,819
No! He lives in lndia.

955
01:24:38,022 --> 01:24:39,717
l see, where in lndia?

956
01:24:40,157 --> 01:24:42,455
Krishna, we've got to go to office.

957
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:45,322
We'll give you her uncle's address later.

958
01:24:45,529 --> 01:24:48,259
with pin code. But we've got to leave now. Bye!

959
01:24:49,367 --> 01:24:51,460
Bye!- Bye

960
01:24:53,037 --> 01:24:55,528
How many lies do we have
to speak to cover up one lie?

961
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:58,140
The excuse of an uncle saved us today!
- Tomorrow it'll be an aunt!

962
01:24:58,342 --> 01:25:00,640
There is no dearth of relatives. Relax!

963
01:25:01,445 --> 01:25:03,003
Did you see his eyes?

964
01:25:03,681 --> 01:25:05,672
They were full of love and trust.

965
01:25:06,417 --> 01:25:07,850
Honey, l can't do this!

966
01:25:08,052 --> 01:25:09,815
l can't hurt Krishna anymore.

967
01:25:10,021 --> 01:25:13,422
Hurt? He's going to become a
celebrity thanks to you.

968
01:25:13,624 --> 01:25:15,319
And we'll get a promotion.

969
01:25:15,526 --> 01:25:19,360
And even if he gets to know,
a small lie is not going to hurt him

970
01:25:21,665 --> 01:25:22,495
What happened?

971
01:25:23,034 --> 01:25:27,562
You? How did you get here from the 20th floor?

972

973
01:25:28,606 --> 01:25:30,005
Stairs?

974

01:25:50,995 --> 01:25:52,121
Close your eyes.

978
01:25:54,131 --> 01:25:57,897
Priya, why do you widen your eyes
whenever l ask you to close them?

979
01:26:02,873 --> 01:26:03,737
Open them now

980
01:26:07,845 --> 01:26:10,143
May l put it on yourfinger?

981
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:16,579
Give me your hand

982

01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:03,840
Ten days will go by in no time.

1006
01:30:04,381 --> 01:30:06,941
Tell me how are you finding it there?

1007
01:30:07,151 --> 01:30:08,083
lts very nice, Grandma.

1008
01:30:08,285 --> 01:30:09,718
There are a lot of high rise buildings here.

1009
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:12,411
And my apartment is on the 20th floor...

1010
01:30:12,623 --> 01:30:15,148
And l'm talking to you from the balcony right now.

1011
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:18,128
Ok, ok, take care of yourself.

1012
01:30:18,329 --> 01:30:21,696
And give my love and blessings to Priya.

1013
01:30:22,066 --> 01:30:25,160
Just imagine! That's the
name of our new show.

1014
01:30:25,369 --> 01:30:31,672
Can you imagine a human being
climbing a tree fasterthan a monkey?

1015
01:30:31,875 --> 01:30:35,936
No... isn't it? Well after watching
our show today.

1016
01:30:36,146 --> 01:30:39,638
You won't just imagine,
but also believe that is possible.

1017
01:30:39,850 --> 01:30:44,116
Get set then! On one end is the
world famous orangutan Mao...

1018
01:30:44,688 --> 01:30:47,623
....who in a blink, will climb this pole.

1019
01:30:47,825 --> 01:30:50,487
And on the other side is
lndian superboy Krishna!

1020
01:30:51,895 --> 01:30:52,554
What's happening here, Priya?

1021
01:30:52,763 --> 01:30:53,422
What happened?

1022
01:30:53,630 --> 01:30:55,564
You brought me here to watch a shoot!

1023
01:30:55,766 --> 01:30:59,702
True. But then l thought if you can watch a shoot,
you can even perform in it!

1024
01:30:59,903 --> 01:31:02,235
But how can l climb the pole fasterthan Mao?

1025
01:31:02,439 --> 01:31:05,636
Like you climbed the mountain!
The zigzag manner...remember?

1026
01:31:05,843 --> 01:31:08,073
But what if l lose to Mao?

1027
01:31:08,278 --> 01:31:10,109
l'm sure you won't.

1028
01:31:10,314 --> 01:31:11,338
But what if l do?

1029
01:31:11,949 --> 01:31:12,506
well...

1030
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:14,681
l'll marry Mao then.

1031
01:31:17,354 --> 01:31:19,117
No! l'll never let that happen.

1032
01:31:19,757 --> 01:31:21,588
So do it please! lt'll be great fun.

1033
01:31:28,098 --> 01:31:29,065
Fun it will be.

1034
01:31:30,067 --> 01:31:31,762
Sir we're ready

1035
01:31:31,969 --> 01:31:32,594
Ready is it?

1036
01:31:32,803 --> 01:31:34,270
Chao, is Mao ready?

1037
01:31:34,471 --> 01:31:35,369
Ready

1038
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:38,105
Krishna...Ready?

1039
01:31:40,210 --> 01:31:43,941
Priya, there's just a pole's distance
between us and our success!

1040
01:31:44,148 --> 01:31:45,979
Not a pole, it's just a moment. Stupid!

1041
01:31:46,183 --> 01:31:47,241
Taking

1042
01:31:59,496 --> 01:32:00,428
Roll camera

1043
01:32:02,032 --> 01:32:02,760

1044
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:10,702
Cut!

1045
01:32:14,611 --> 01:32:16,909
What the hell is this?

1046
01:32:17,247 --> 01:32:19,306
Boss, it's all about brotherhood

1047
01:32:19,516 --> 01:32:20,676
Shut up!

1048
01:32:20,851 --> 01:32:21,909
Sorry, Sir

1049
01:32:22,686 --> 01:32:24,153
Come on Mao, come on

1050
01:32:24,388 --> 01:32:26,481
Roll camera... Action

1051
01:32:30,294 --> 01:32:30,953
Cut!

1052
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:37,327
You stupid ape! l've paid a lot
of money foryou, okay?

1053
01:32:37,534 --> 01:32:39,502
And l'm tired of you monkeying around

1054
01:32:39,703 --> 01:32:43,002
You don't get your act together;
you're out of my show. Okay?

1055
01:32:47,044 --> 01:32:49,012
l've straightened a lot of these smart alecs

1056
01:32:59,523 --> 01:33:00,547
Roll camera!

1057
01:33:01,625 --> 01:33:02,319
Action.

1058
01:33:11,168 --> 01:33:12,430
Where is the fish?

1059
01:33:12,936 --> 01:33:13,527
Cut!

1060
01:33:23,514 --> 01:33:24,503
Roll camera!

1061
01:33:25,716 --> 01:33:26,546
Action.

1062
01:33:43,066 --> 01:33:44,693
l'm not going to the circus with you.

1063
01:33:44,901 --> 01:33:47,630
Strange! Why vent your
anger against Mao, on me?

1064
01:33:47,836 --> 01:33:49,770
How can l help it if he refused
to climb the pole?

1065
01:33:50,072 --> 01:33:53,529
And the fish...instead of
coming into my hand...

1066
01:33:53,741 --> 01:33:56,038
They palmed off a can, a shoe and that...

1067
01:33:56,943 --> 01:33:59,070
Wow! Priya smile!

1068
01:34:06,085 --> 01:34:08,575
ln lndia you caught the fish so easily!

1069
01:34:08,786 --> 01:34:11,380
Actually those fish knew me,
they stood by me.

1070
01:34:11,588 --> 01:34:13,681
But you're not standing by me!

1071
01:34:15,626 --> 01:34:17,991
l've come to stand by you for life, Priya.

1072
01:34:18,761 --> 01:34:21,286
For life? When my mother asks
you what you do?

1073
01:34:21,497 --> 01:34:22,793
What will you say?

1074
01:34:22,998 --> 01:34:24,158
l'll tell her what l do

1075
01:34:24,699 --> 01:34:25,666
Love you.

1076
01:34:28,035 --> 01:34:29,024
And...what else will you say?

1077

l'll fulfill all your wishes, look afteryou.

1078
01:34:33,673 --> 01:34:34,469
And...?

1079
01:34:35,942 --> 01:34:38,273
l'll never let a smile leave yourface.

1080
01:34:44,615 --> 01:34:45,377
And..?

1081
01:34:46,117 --> 01:34:47,982
Whethertimes good or bad
we'll always be together.

1082
01:34:49,152 --> 01:34:50,881
just like eyelashes are with the eyes.

1083
01:34:52,789 --> 01:34:53,585
And...?

1084
01:34:54,223 --> 01:34:57,454
You will dream and l'll fulfill them.

1085
01:34:59,994 --> 01:35:00,756
And...?

1086
01:35:01,095 --> 01:35:03,063
ln the scorching heat of the sun,
l'll be your shade.

1087
01:35:04,132 --> 01:35:05,826
and in the cold, l'll give you warmth.

1088
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:09,199
When the rains botheryou, l'll change
the course of the clouds.

1089
01:35:09,876 --> 01:35:12,538
and when a storm blows...
l'll turn the winds away.

1090
01:35:21,954 --> 01:35:24,149
That's how l shall protect
you all my life...

1091
01:35:25,324 --> 01:35:26,291
from every danger.

1092
01:35:27,326 --> 01:35:28,554
from every trouble.

1093
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:37,098
Now l hope your mother will agree?

Who...who are you?

1170
01:45:28,249 --> 01:45:29,079
Krrish

1171
01:45:32,553 --> 01:45:33,247
Friend

1172
01:45:34,755 --> 01:45:35,585
Friend

1173
01:46:48,627 --> 01:46:49,321
Priya!

1174
01:46:51,497 --> 01:46:52,521
Are you all right?

1175
01:46:53,632 --> 01:46:54,758
But how did you get here?

1176
01:46:54,967 --> 01:46:56,127
You had fainted.

1177
01:46:56,869 --> 01:46:58,461
l had gone to get some waterforyou...

1178
01:46:58,971 --> 01:47:00,996
God! What a blaze! Come,
let's go home.

1179
01:47:12,618 --> 01:47:14,677
The most sensational news in
Singapore right now

1180
01:47:14,887 --> 01:47:18,050
is the circus blaze at Marina Bay
which took place last night

1181
01:47:18,257 --> 01:47:22,853
and the daredevil masked man saviour who, in a
flash, rescued many victims trapped in the fire

1182
01:47:23,061 --> 01:47:28,328
and has become every child's hero overnight but
his identity is still shrouded in mystery.

1183
01:47:28,767 --> 01:47:32,533
Till yesterday, we only had a description
and a picture of the masked man.

1184
01:47:33,005 --> 01:47:34,632
Today, we've got to know his name

1185
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:39,072
and also got a piece of his mask.
Let's find out how.

1186
01:47:39,945 --> 01:47:41,468
He said his name is Krrish

1187
01:47:41,679 --> 01:47:44,614
and this piece of the mask broke
from his forehead.

1188
01:47:44,815 --> 01:47:46,077
So his name is Krrish!

1189
01:47:46,284 --> 01:47:47,114
KRRlSH!

1190
01:47:47,318 --> 01:47:50,151
But his identity is still shrouded
in mystery.

1191
01:47:50,354 --> 01:47:57,726
Whoever Krrish is, a bravery award
and cash reward of 25000 dollars...

1192
01:47:57,929 --> 01:47:59,362
has been announced in appreciation
of his courage.

1193
01:47:59,564 --> 01:48:01,691
So how are we going to identify Krrish?

1194
01:48:01,899 --> 01:48:06,097
The one, whose mask this piece matches with,
will be considered to be Krrish.

1195
01:48:06,304 --> 01:48:08,932
And he'll be the one to be rewarded.

1196
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:13,201
Krrish! Krrish! After all who is this Krrish?

1197
01:48:14,312 --> 01:48:17,770
Listen carefully, our priority
at the moment is Krrish.

1198
01:48:17,949 --> 01:48:21,112
Only Krrish! Get that?

1199
01:48:21,385 --> 01:48:23,376
Krrish's identity...

1200
01:48:23,621 --> 01:48:26,886
Our channel should be the
first to reveal him!

1201
01:48:27,091 --> 01:48:28,422
Do you get that?

1202
01:48:37,934 --> 01:48:42,598
Our channel must be the first one to
unmask this masked Krrish!

1203
01:48:43,006 --> 01:48:47,443
Get it? Stop nodding and leave!
Go, get him! Go, go!

1204
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:52,141
Where are the two of you going?

1205
01:48:52,349 --> 01:48:53,509
To look for Krrish.

1206
01:48:53,717 --> 01:48:56,948
Ah, forget Krrish. And look for a new job.

1207
01:48:57,554 --> 01:48:58,384
New job...?

1208
01:48:59,322 --> 01:49:00,448
You both are fired.

1209
01:49:00,657 --> 01:49:01,453
What?

1210
01:49:02,759 --> 01:49:03,748
You better go back to lndia...

1211
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:06,895
and enjoy your Krishna's flute playing.

1212
01:49:07,430 --> 01:49:09,227
Don't waste yourtime, Go, go!

1213
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:11,224
Out!

1214
01:49:12,802 --> 01:49:15,100
Thanks to Krishna we're jobless.

1215
01:49:15,505 --> 01:49:16,904
Now what do we do?

1216
01:49:17,841 --> 01:49:23,643
Honey, l think Krrish is none other
than our own Krishna.

1217
01:49:24,114 --> 01:49:25,012
What?

1218
01:49:25,448 --> 01:49:25,971
Yes, Honey!

1219
01:49:27,383 --> 01:49:30,477
At the circus, l saw Krrish from
such a close distance.

1220
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:34,785
l have a strong feeling that Krishna is Krrish.

1221
01:49:36,025 --> 01:49:38,994
So why didn't you tell this to
boss at the meeting?

1222
01:49:39,194 --> 01:49:43,494
Because l wasn't sure, l need
to confirm it first.

1223
01:49:43,799 --> 01:49:45,494
Confirm? How?

1224
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:49,866
Listen, l have an idea...

1225
01:50:57,538 --> 01:50:58,368
Honey, these guys...?

1226
01:50:58,573 --> 01:51:00,507
Priya! l've hired some actors.
But l'm a bit late...

1227
01:51:00,708 --> 01:51:01,766
l'll be there soon.

1228
01:51:01,976 --> 01:51:02,601
What?

1229
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:06,812
So who are these guys?

1230
01:51:08,216 --> 01:51:11,083
Oh my God! Help!

1231
01:51:31,705 --> 01:51:33,434
This is now mine...bye!

1232
01:51:42,382 --> 01:51:45,874
l'm so sorry, Krishna. l'm so sorry.

1233
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:52,222
l thought you were Krrish and
planned my own kidnapping.

1234
01:51:53,994 --> 01:51:57,794
But then, real goons turned up
instead of the hired ones.

1235
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:00,832
Real goons?

1236
01:52:05,472 --> 01:52:07,405
But why didn't you hit back?

1237
01:52:10,409 --> 01:52:12,639
Why did you quietly take their beating?

1238
01:52:15,414 --> 01:52:16,403
l wanted to see...

1239
01:52:18,551 --> 01:52:23,921
whether it hurts you to see me in pain.

1240
01:52:28,127 --> 01:52:28,923
lt does.

1241
01:52:41,941 --> 01:52:42,930
Where's your ring?

1242
01:52:44,577 --> 01:52:45,942
Maybe they've...

1243
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:39,023
Who's he? Why's he here?

1244
01:53:40,298 --> 01:53:43,165
l think he's the masked man.

1245
01:53:45,303 --> 01:53:47,669
Masked man?

1246
01:54:01,952 --> 01:54:02,816
Get him.

1247
01:55:27,370 --> 01:55:28,769
l'm sorry, sorry.

1248
01:56:09,411 --> 01:56:11,879
My friend Krrish!

1249
01:56:14,749 --> 01:56:19,152
l'll tell everyone, l'll tell my sister.

1250
01:56:19,354 --> 01:56:23,415
No, Kristian. Don't tell anyone.

1251
01:56:23,625 --> 01:56:29,188
Why? You become famous!
You'll get the reward.

1252
01:56:33,701 --> 01:56:37,000
Here, Kristian. You become Krrish.

1253
01:56:40,974 --> 01:56:46,503
Take it. Get the money foryour sister.

1254
01:56:48,148 --> 01:56:49,479
Make her legs good again.

1255
01:56:52,052 --> 01:56:52,848
Take it!

1256
01:57:00,060 --> 01:57:05,020
No, it's yours. You are the hero.

1257
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:10,859
Every human being who fights for a
good cause is a hero, Kristian.

1258
01:57:12,172 --> 01:57:14,663
You... are fighting foryour sister.

1259
01:57:17,344 --> 01:57:18,538
You are a hero.

1260
01:57:23,850 --> 01:57:25,044
The biggest news of today!

1261
01:57:25,251 --> 01:57:28,015
Superhero Krrish has revealed his
identity to the media...

1262
01:57:28,221 --> 01:57:30,485
and the broken piece of the mask
fitting his mask

1263
01:57:30,690 --> 01:57:32,453
has confirmed his identity

1264
01:57:32,692 --> 01:57:36,219
Here today, Hero Honda is honouring
Krrish for his bravery

1265
01:57:38,998 --> 01:57:39,521
Well done young man.

1266
01:57:39,732 --> 01:57:40,289
Thank you

1267
01:57:59,652 --> 01:58:03,748
Not once did it occurto me that
Kristian could also be Krrish!

1268
01:58:03,956 --> 01:58:05,821
He was also there at the circus that night!

1269
01:58:06,893 --> 01:58:09,794
Had it struck me that night

1270
01:58:09,996 --> 01:58:11,520
l wouldn't have got a thrashing!

1271
01:58:13,666 --> 01:58:15,725
l've said sorry, haven't l?

1272
01:58:16,068 --> 01:58:17,261
What else do you want me to do?

1273
01:58:19,704 --> 01:58:20,830
Close your eyes...

1274
01:58:21,973 --> 01:58:23,201
again you...

1275
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:29,778
Now open them.

1276
01:58:31,850 --> 01:58:33,249
How did you get it back?

1277
01:58:33,451 --> 01:58:35,817
Krrish, he's my friend.

1278
01:58:36,221 --> 01:58:37,153
Wouldn't he do this much for me?

1279
01:58:40,926 --> 01:58:42,154
Thank you, thank you

1280
01:58:51,937 --> 01:58:52,460
Take it

1281
01:58:53,839 --> 01:58:56,069
Won't you put it on my finger?

Priya, you're watching TV here and there boss has
ordered to vacate Krishna's apartment.

1337
02:04:43,281 --> 02:04:46,216
Hello! Are you listening?

l am & am not.

1339
02:04:56,093 --> 02:04:57,583
What's this?

02:04:58,529 --> 02:05:00,724
Rememberthe explosion at the circus?

1341
02:05:01,199 --> 02:05:04,293
l had passed out, but l think the
camera was still on.

1342
02:05:05,303 --> 02:05:08,704
Now switch off the TV and think
about Krishna! Please!

1343
02:05:14,045 --> 02:05:15,137
Oh my god!

1344
02:05:17,148 --> 02:05:17,978
What happened?

1345
02:05:18,182 --> 02:05:19,648
l'll rewind and show you.

1346
02:05:37,100 --> 02:05:38,658
Krishna is Krrish!

02:05:47,644 --> 02:05:48,941
Why are you girls screaming?

1349
02:05:50,146 --> 02:05:50,737
Where are you both going?

1350
02:05:50,947 --> 02:05:51,709
Mom Office! l'll see you okay.

02:05:51,915 --> 02:05:52,381
Office?

1352

Come on Honey

1353
02:05:53,650 --> 02:05:54,480
To get our jobs back!

1354
02:05:54,684 --> 02:05:55,514
Ok bye!

1355
02:05:57,420 --> 02:05:59,012
Priya, your mobile.

1356
02:06:00,056 --> 02:06:00,886
Hello Priya?

1357
02:06:01,491 --> 02:06:03,152
No, l'm Priya's mother

1358
02:06:04,761 --> 02:06:07,525
Mother...hello.

1359
02:06:07,998 --> 02:06:09,795
When did you return from Hong Kong?

1360
02:06:10,100 --> 02:06:14,058
Hong Kong? l didn't go anywhere...
l've been right here

1361
02:06:14,270 --> 02:06:16,067
And who are you?

1362
02:06:16,839 --> 02:06:19,774
lt's me, Krishna.

1363
02:06:20,242 --> 02:06:21,402
Krishna, who?

1364
02:06:23,479 --> 02:06:26,642
Priya has told you everything about me,
hasn't she?

1365
02:06:27,249 --> 02:06:30,480
No, Priya has said nothing about you.

1366
02:06:34,857 --> 02:06:36,848
You are Priya's mother aren't you?

1367
02:06:37,293 --> 02:06:39,284
Yes...l'm Priya's mother.

1368
02:06:41,363 --> 02:06:42,295
Where's Priya?

1369
02:06:42,498 --> 02:06:44,227
Priya left for office just now.

1370
02:06:46,535 --> 02:06:47,832
Office...

1371
02:06:48,037 --> 02:06:49,004
Right... Thank you

1372
02:06:53,709 --> 02:07:00,444
Priya, do you realise? Once this
footage is telecast....

1373
02:07:01,950 --> 02:07:06,147
Our Krishna will become a
world famous celebrity!

1374
02:07:07,188 --> 02:07:09,179
There's something about our Krishna!

1375
02:07:09,557 --> 02:07:11,889
He fooled us so convincingly.

1376
02:07:12,093 --> 02:07:15,153
ln lndia, as Kalicharan, and here, as Krrish!

1377
02:07:15,363 --> 02:07:18,457
Didn't l tell you Honey, the truth
always comes out?

1378
02:07:21,302 --> 02:07:24,533
Look Priya, the truth about Krishna
the world is about to discover...

1379
02:07:24,739 --> 02:07:25,899
...is because you lied!

1380
02:07:26,107 --> 02:07:30,373
The lie that you love him brought him
here all the way from lndia.

1381
02:07:30,578 --> 02:07:34,207
And imagine! Now we're going to
create a big sensation!

1382
02:07:35,249 --> 02:07:38,582
You're right. A lie sometimes leads
to very big gains.

1383
02:08:00,173 --> 02:08:02,573
You didn't even tell me!

1384
02:08:04,010 --> 02:08:05,170
What could l say?

1385
02:08:06,947 --> 02:08:11,441
When his honesty turned my feigned
love into a genuine one...

1386
02:08:13,553 --> 02:08:15,020
l didn't even realize

1387
02:08:18,358 --> 02:08:20,053
l'm in love with Krishna, Honey

1388
02:08:29,903 --> 02:08:31,928
Krishna, Krishna

1389
02:08:34,474 --> 02:08:36,101
The culprit has been caught at last!

1390
02:08:37,644 --> 02:08:40,704
He did his best to hide his identity, you know

1391
02:08:41,248 --> 02:08:44,740
But l finally discovered who the real Krrish is!

1392
02:08:46,086 --> 02:08:47,451
Why did you lie to me?

1393
02:08:48,655 --> 02:08:50,282
Why did you keep me in the dark?

1394
02:08:51,791 --> 02:08:54,658
Where was the need to hide behind
a mask, even with me?

1395
02:08:59,432 --> 02:09:00,660
You're asking this Priya?

1396
02:09:02,868 --> 02:09:04,699
Someone who has never been honest with me

1397
02:09:07,072 --> 02:09:09,302
Someone who kept me in the dark till today

1398
02:09:12,445 --> 02:09:14,106
l have been unmasked Priya.

1399
02:09:20,252 --> 02:09:21,219
What about you?

1400
02:09:23,689 --> 02:09:24,713
What do you mean?

1401
02:09:26,459 --> 02:09:28,723
Why did you lie to me that you loved me?

1402
02:09:30,729 --> 02:09:33,289
l took your lies forthe truth and came here.

1403
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:36,061
to ask your motherforyour hand in marriage

1404
02:09:39,338 --> 02:09:41,670
But you lied about hertoo!

1405
02:09:43,642 --> 02:09:44,437
yes, Priya

1406
02:09:46,478 --> 02:09:48,241
l've spoken to your mother

1407
02:09:53,284 --> 02:09:54,012
Krishna...

1408
02:09:56,087 --> 02:09:57,019
l'm sorry

1409
02:09:59,657 --> 02:10:01,921
l admit, l lied to you in the beginning

1410
02:10:02,794 --> 02:10:03,556
But now...

1411
02:10:06,731 --> 02:10:08,528
l really love you Krishna

1412
02:10:08,733 --> 02:10:11,497
Stop it, Priya! Stop it!

1413
02:10:12,837 --> 02:10:14,998
you may have more lies to tell me

1414
02:10:17,008 --> 02:10:19,340
But l don't have the strength to take
them forthe truth anymore!

1415
02:10:19,544 --> 02:10:23,310
Listen to me, Krishna! l've done
all this only foryou

1416
02:10:23,515 --> 02:10:25,676
l wanted to see you become
a very big man

1417
02:10:25,884 --> 02:10:27,715
and that's about to happen in
just a few hours

1418
02:10:27,919 --> 02:10:30,183
the whole world will get to know about
your extraordinary powers and talent

1419
02:10:30,388 --> 02:10:31,753
that's exactly what l didn't want

1420
02:10:32,824 --> 02:10:35,384
Why do you think l wore the mask?

1421
02:10:36,694 --> 02:10:40,459
because l had promised grandma that
l'd keep my identity hidden

1422
02:10:41,331 --> 02:10:43,731
that l would not let anyone know
about my powers

1423
02:10:46,036 --> 02:10:46,934
and you

1424
02:10:52,342 --> 02:10:53,673
grandma was right

1425
02:10:54,778 --> 02:10:58,077
people in the world only use each other
fortheir own selfish reasons

1426
02:11:00,651 --> 02:11:02,016
She tried to stop me, but l...

1427
02:11:02,219 --> 02:11:04,551
But why does your grandmother
want to stop you?

1428
02:11:05,889 --> 02:11:08,756
Why does she always want you
in front of her eyes?

1429
02:11:10,427 --> 02:11:13,328
Why doesn't she want the whole
world to know of yourtalent?

1430
02:11:14,331 --> 02:11:15,093
ls she not being selfish?

1431
02:11:15,299 --> 02:11:15,993
Priya!

1432
02:11:20,470 --> 02:11:21,596
You really want to know?

1433
02:11:23,307 --> 02:11:24,274
Then listen!

1434
02:11:43,159 --> 02:11:47,619
having lost her son, grandma
did not want to lose me

1435
02:11:47,830 --> 02:11:49,263
because l posses the same powers

1436
02:11:56,839 --> 02:11:58,534
but she still let me come here

1437
02:12:00,843 --> 02:12:01,741
foryou

1438
02:12:03,579 --> 02:12:05,843
for my feelings, she gave in

1439
02:12:10,353 --> 02:12:12,150
But what do l tell her now?

1440
02:12:18,527 --> 02:12:20,859
Krishna, listen to me... Krishna!

1441
02:12:21,731 --> 02:12:24,130
Krishna...

1442
02:12:33,141 --> 02:12:34,802
Hello Honey

1443
02:12:34,976 --> 02:12:36,705
We've got to stop the telecast
of Krishna's tape

1444
02:12:36,878 --> 02:12:37,503
Why?

1445
02:12:38,146 --> 02:12:41,172
don't ask questions now, just
stop the telecast

1446
02:12:41,516 --> 02:12:43,575
but the tape is with boss

1447
02:12:45,286 --> 02:12:47,311
My god, where's boss?

1448
02:13:03,004 --> 02:13:07,168
l wish to thank all my investors
in Singapore

1449
02:13:07,909 --> 02:13:10,639
they are the ones who really
deserve this applause

1450
02:13:10,845 --> 02:13:13,439
for having had faith in my
various projects

1451
02:13:15,016 --> 02:13:19,213
l'm delighted to announce that
our company, Technotronics...

1452
02:13:19,453 --> 02:13:23,480
has made a profit of 400 million
dollars this year

1453
02:13:23,791 --> 02:13:27,283
l therefore announce100% dividend

1454
02:13:27,494 --> 02:13:29,485
to all our shareholders

1455
02:13:32,066 --> 02:13:33,658
Any questions?

1456
02:13:36,270 --> 02:13:36,964
Yes?

1457
02:13:39,139 --> 02:13:43,235
Dr. Arya, congratulations on the phenomenal
success of your company

1458
02:13:43,677 --> 02:13:44,837
my question is

1459
02:13:45,279 --> 02:13:48,715
20 years ago, you tried to make a computer

1460
02:13:48,916 --> 02:13:50,645
that could see the future

1461
02:13:52,753 --> 02:13:55,085
What happened to that dream of yours?

1462
02:13:58,892 --> 02:14:02,157
20 years ago, you must have had
a lot of dreams too...

1463
02:14:02,896 --> 02:14:04,363
Did they all come true?

1464
02:14:05,299 --> 02:14:05,856
Pardon me?

1465
02:14:06,967 --> 02:14:09,935
some questions hurt

1466
02:14:11,204 --> 02:14:13,172
the media ought to understand

1467
02:14:15,441 --> 02:14:22,074
that dream died with the death of my
genius friend, Rohit Mehra

1468
02:14:23,483 --> 02:14:26,884
But from what l've read and
heard of you, Dr. Arya...

1469
02:14:27,320 --> 02:14:29,151
you don't ever accept defeat

1470
02:14:29,455 --> 02:14:31,423
l'd have tried to win...

1471
02:14:32,859 --> 02:14:37,057
had my genius friend been alive

1472
02:14:39,665 --> 02:14:40,859
Any further questions?

1473
02:14:42,535 --> 02:14:43,467
excuse me

1474
02:14:43,669 --> 02:14:45,967
sir, l need to speak to that lady
for just one minute

1475
02:14:50,076 --> 02:14:50,804
Please!

1476
02:14:59,051 --> 02:14:59,779
Krishna

1477
02:15:07,692 --> 02:15:09,023
Anything left to say?

1478
02:15:11,930 --> 02:15:16,162
Yes...This gentleman has
something to say

1479
02:15:22,374 --> 02:15:23,102
Who are you?

1480
02:15:24,342 --> 02:15:25,673
My name is Vikram Sinha

1481
02:15:27,445 --> 02:15:28,343
What do you want?

1482
02:15:28,847 --> 02:15:34,342
Don't go back the way you came.

1483
02:15:35,320 --> 02:15:36,116
What does that mean?

1484
02:15:36,321 --> 02:15:38,915
l mean, you came alone

1485
02:15:39,724 --> 02:15:40,884
don't go back alone.

1486
02:15:46,798 --> 02:15:49,926
Krishna, yourfather, Rohit Mehra,
is still alive.

1487
02:16:00,878 --> 02:16:01,742
What did you say?

1488
02:16:09,253 --> 02:16:13,781
This picture was taken when
yourfather worked for Dr Arya

1489
02:16:14,525 --> 02:16:17,323
And l was the Senior Security
Officer at Technotronics.

1490
02:16:18,462 --> 02:16:20,123
He was youngerto me in age,

1491
02:16:20,731 --> 02:16:22,562
and l was a junior in status.

1492
02:16:23,434 --> 02:16:25,095
And yet, we were very close friends.

1493
02:16:26,203 --> 02:16:28,171
not only because we were lndians

1494
02:16:29,340 --> 02:16:31,808
it was because of the sincerity in his smile

1495
02:16:33,544 --> 02:16:35,136
and the honesty in his eyes.

1496
02:16:37,214 --> 02:16:38,681
He was always smiling...

1497
02:16:42,753 --> 02:16:45,813
but someone cast an evil eye on him.

1498
02:16:47,557 --> 02:16:48,854
lt's been so many years,

1499
02:16:50,493 --> 02:16:51,653
but that time...

1500
02:16:53,196 --> 02:16:54,857
seems to have frozen.

1501
02:16:55,899 --> 02:16:58,265
That day, he was working till morning...

1502
02:16:58,801 --> 02:17:01,793
because he had to complete his
project and go back to lndia.

1503
02:17:02,338 --> 02:17:03,396
Good morning, chief

1504
02:17:04,574 --> 02:17:07,099
Mr. Vikram? Welcome!

1505
02:17:07,410 --> 02:17:08,377
How are you this morning?

1506
02:17:08,578 --> 02:17:09,943
l'm doing fine, chief

1507
02:17:10,480 --> 02:17:15,611
but if you keep working round the clock like this,
you're going to get insomnia

1508
02:17:17,053 --> 02:17:19,317
l won't have to do it aftertoday.

1509
02:17:20,356 --> 02:17:22,290
Once the computer is inaugurated today...

1510
02:17:22,558 --> 02:17:27,222
l'll hand it overto Dr Arya and return
to my family in lndia.

1511
02:17:28,932 --> 02:17:30,456
Don't mind, chief...

1512
02:17:30,833 --> 02:17:34,064
but l still can't believe that we
can see the future.

1513
02:17:34,370 --> 02:17:36,838
Not believing does not change
the truth, Mr. Vikram.

1514
02:17:37,807 --> 02:17:39,900
You will believe it, when you see it?

1515
02:17:40,109 --> 02:17:42,542
What? You mean you're going to...

1516
02:17:42,744 --> 02:17:43,733
Of course!

1517
02:17:45,047 --> 02:17:48,539
Come see tomorrow, today

1518
02:17:49,017 --> 02:17:52,043
and tell me how it feels to see the future.

1519
02:17:52,421 --> 02:17:53,285
Please hold this.

1520
02:18:15,877 --> 02:18:18,368
Retina scan, an identification of my eyes

1521
02:18:55,116 --> 02:18:57,641
These 2 identifications of mine are
the password forthis computer.

1522
02:18:57,852 --> 02:18:59,615
Without which, it won't start up.

1523
02:19:00,354 --> 02:19:04,882
But when you're not around, when
you've gone back to lndia?

1524
02:19:05,092 --> 02:19:07,560
l'll change the password before l leave

1525
02:19:07,762 --> 02:19:10,890
Afterthat, only Dr Arya will be able
to start the computer.

1526
02:19:14,035 --> 02:19:14,797
Tell me...

1527
02:19:16,103 --> 02:19:17,502
What would you like to see?

1528
02:19:17,805 --> 02:19:19,466
l...l don't want to see anything, chief!

1529
02:19:20,241 --> 02:19:22,675
But you said your wife is pregnant

1530
02:19:24,045 --> 02:19:28,037
Let's see whether l'm going to be an
uncle to a nephew or a niece?

1531
02:19:30,150 --> 02:19:33,347
Ok then...let's find out.

1532
02:20:01,548 --> 02:20:02,071
Nisha!

1533
02:20:06,186 --> 02:20:06,811
Nisha!

1534
02:20:08,455 --> 02:20:10,150
My darling baby...

1535
02:20:12,826 --> 02:20:16,057
Look, Nisha, your son looks just like Rohit.

1536
02:20:16,262 --> 02:20:23,099
Now go to your Mom. My son's
coming back to me.

1537
02:20:24,970 --> 02:20:29,339
Congratulations, chief! Your wife's
going to deliver a baby boy tomorrow!

1538
02:20:29,675 --> 02:20:32,439
But l'm going to distribute sweets
today! ln fact, right now?

1539
02:20:32,644 --> 02:20:33,542
What did you say?

1540
02:20:34,346 --> 02:20:35,643
What happened to my Rohit?

1541
02:20:36,115 --> 02:20:37,082
What happened, Mom?

1542
02:20:37,616 --> 02:20:40,414
No! That's impossible!

1543
02:20:41,253 --> 02:20:42,811
My Rohit can't be dead!

1544
02:20:44,156 --> 02:20:45,418
My Rohit is alive!

1545
02:20:45,691 --> 02:20:46,248
No!

1546
02:20:47,092 --> 02:20:47,717
No!

1547
02:20:48,827 --> 02:20:49,691
Which means, l...

1548
02:20:50,162 --> 02:20:54,656
Chief, the computer's malfunctioning!
Something's wrong with it!

1549
02:21:22,827 --> 02:21:23,816
Dr Arya!

1550
02:21:25,329 --> 02:21:30,289
lt's 6:40 there, it's 6:30 now!
This means, in just 10 minutes!

1551
02:21:30,501 --> 02:21:31,468
in this very room!

1552
02:21:37,208 --> 02:21:38,505
Look! Dr. Arya!

1553
02:21:39,944 --> 02:21:42,469
Have you heard of Shahjahan, Doctor Mathur?

1554
02:21:42,680 --> 02:21:44,545
Of course! He built the Taj Mahal.

1555
02:21:44,782 --> 02:21:46,443
lncomplete knowledge is always dangerous.

1556
02:21:46,784 --> 02:21:49,548
Shahjahan had the hands of workers
who built the Taj Mahal, chopped off!

1557
02:21:49,754 --> 02:21:52,052
so that there would never be another Taj Mahal.

1558
02:21:52,523 --> 02:21:55,959
Rohit Mehra is a workerfor me
and l'm his Shahjehan.

1559
02:21:56,928 --> 02:21:59,488
You mean, you're also going to
cut off Rohit's hands?

1560
02:21:59,697 --> 02:22:02,598
No...his brain!

1561
02:22:03,501 --> 02:22:09,097
because Rohit's brain will create problems,
for himself as well as for me.

1562
02:22:10,140 --> 02:22:13,507
Actually, l'm going to feel very sorry about
it because Rohit is a very good boy.

1563
02:22:13,710 --> 02:22:17,407
Sincere, honest, intelligent...

1564
02:22:17,614 --> 02:22:19,878
They're coming here, chief. Please leave!

1565
02:22:20,083 --> 02:22:22,608
No, no! l'm won't let this computer
go into the wrong hands.

1566
02:22:22,819 --> 02:22:24,047
l'll destroy everything!

1567
02:22:24,421 --> 02:22:24,944
All right!

1568
02:22:25,155 --> 02:22:27,055
l'll try and stop them!

1569
02:22:31,728 --> 02:22:32,353
Hello!

1570
02:22:32,562 --> 02:22:33,187
Mom?

1571
02:22:33,463 --> 02:22:36,364
Rohit? l've brought Nisha to the hospital.

1572
02:22:36,566 --> 02:22:39,592
Congratulations! You're going to
become a father anytime.

1573
02:22:39,803 --> 02:22:41,600
Come home soon, son

1574
02:22:41,805 --> 02:22:43,932
l'm coming, Mom! l'm coming!

1575
02:22:44,140 --> 02:22:49,373
Rohit...What's the matter? You sound tense?

1576
02:22:49,813 --> 02:22:53,977
l've been exploited, the world is very selfish!

1577
02:22:54,184 --> 02:22:57,778
Don't worry, l'll be back, l'll be back soon.

1578
02:24:01,516 --> 02:24:02,676
Rohit!

1579
02:24:04,152 --> 02:24:05,847
What have you done?

1580
02:24:08,990 --> 02:24:13,950
l've destroyed your dream...
l've destroyed everything!

1581
02:24:16,264 --> 02:24:18,357
because l've got to know of your intentions

1582
02:24:18,700 --> 02:24:25,435
But those who know me also
know that l never accept defeat.

1583
02:24:29,177 --> 02:24:31,042
l'll rebuild this computer

1584
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:34,548
using your research.

1585
02:24:35,683 --> 02:24:38,652
But l don't need you anymore.

1586
02:24:41,689 --> 02:24:44,452
Thank you so much for everything, Rohit

1587
02:24:44,725 --> 02:24:45,555
Good bye

1588
02:24:46,827 --> 02:24:47,725
Hold it, sir!

1589
02:24:51,932 --> 02:24:54,162
Don't kill him, sir

1590
02:24:58,238 --> 02:25:03,540
lf you kill Rohit...then even if you
build the computer again

1591
02:25:03,910 --> 02:25:06,470
you'll never be able to start it

1592
02:25:08,749 --> 02:25:11,547
You need a password to start the computer

1593
02:25:12,119 --> 02:25:14,644
and the password is Rohit himself.

1594
02:25:15,122 --> 02:25:15,781
What?

1595
02:25:16,390 --> 02:25:17,118
Yes, sir

1596
02:25:17,991 --> 02:25:19,549
l've seen it with my own eyes.

1597
02:25:20,494 --> 02:25:25,932
Until scans of his retina and heartbeat
are fed into the computer...

1598
02:25:26,833 --> 02:25:28,562
the computer will not start.

1599
02:25:36,909 --> 02:25:38,809
This means, l'll have to keep you alive

1600
02:25:39,678 --> 02:25:43,239
till l don't build a new computer.

1601
02:25:46,986 --> 02:25:50,080
But die, you will.

1602
02:25:51,390 --> 02:25:52,584
Forthe world.

1603
02:25:57,296 --> 02:25:58,661
Breaking news.

1604
02:25:59,064 --> 02:26:00,793
Tragedy strikes!

1605
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:04,226
Following a fire that broke out in
the lab of Technotronics...

1606
02:26:04,437 --> 02:26:09,170
The famous lndian genius Rohit Mehra
has met with a tragic death.

1607
02:26:10,009 --> 02:26:15,948
Let's observe a 2-minute silence,
so that Rohit Mehra's soul rests in peace.

1608
02:26:27,359 --> 02:26:31,658
Ever since, l had no choice but
to work for Dr Arya.

1609
02:26:33,364 --> 02:26:35,264
l couldn't even go to the police...

1610
02:26:37,702 --> 02:26:42,969
because if Dr Arya doubted me,
he would've killed me.

1611
02:26:44,476 --> 02:26:47,206
And l was the only man who could
get in touch with yourfamily.

1612
02:26:48,813 --> 02:26:52,772
That's exactly why l've been looking foryour
grandma and you for so many years.

1613
02:26:54,219 --> 02:26:56,915
And finally, l met you today, through Priya.

1614
02:27:32,389 --> 02:27:33,549
Dr Arya

1615
02:27:38,428 --> 02:27:39,554
20 years...

1616
02:27:42,733 --> 02:27:45,224
for 20 years, he's kept a
mother away from her son

1617
02:27:46,570 --> 02:27:48,765
and a son away from his father

1618
02:27:51,542 --> 02:27:53,908
lt's because of his lies that l lost my mother.

1619
02:28:03,387 --> 02:28:04,479
Where is my father?

1620
02:28:04,855 --> 02:28:06,186
Here in Singapore.

1621
02:28:06,957 --> 02:28:10,916
For 20 years Dr Arya has used
machines to keep him in a state

1622
02:28:11,161 --> 02:28:14,653
that only his brain is alive,
his body almost dead.

1623
02:28:18,568 --> 02:28:22,231
Good evening, my friend Rohit Mehra

1624
02:28:27,977 --> 02:28:29,945
How are you feeling today?

1625
02:28:32,582 --> 02:28:35,881
Are these machines taking good care of you?

1626
02:28:36,586 --> 02:28:37,450
Yes?

1627
02:28:40,156 --> 02:28:41,088
Good!

1628
02:28:42,258 --> 02:28:45,785
Tomorrow's the glorious and historic day

1629
02:28:45,995 --> 02:28:54,460
when my, sorry, our computer
will be inaugurated.

1630
02:28:55,271 --> 02:29:02,074
Yes! Ours, because nothing
was possible without you

1631
02:29:02,278 --> 02:29:07,147
For so many years, you have
shown such patience and understanding

1632
02:29:07,383 --> 02:29:09,543
and cooperated with me.

1633
02:29:10,285 --> 02:29:14,881
When the computer starts tomorrow

1634
02:29:17,559 --> 02:29:23,930
your utility will come to an end,
and so will your pain.

1635
02:29:29,004 --> 02:29:30,471
See you tomorrow

1636
02:29:40,315 --> 02:29:41,577
Breaking news!

1637
02:29:43,118 --> 02:29:46,087
Dr Arya has suddenly been
reminded of the poet Kabir.

1638
02:29:46,421 --> 02:29:47,945
Do today, what you must do tomorrow...

1639
02:29:48,156 --> 02:29:49,919
and do right now, what you must do today.

1640
02:29:50,125 --> 02:29:56,223
That's why, Dr Arya has decided
to start the computertoday itself.

1641
02:29:57,065 --> 02:30:00,330
and also end Rohit's life.

1642
02:30:01,535 --> 02:30:04,470
ls this where my father is kept?

1643
02:30:05,773 --> 02:30:11,143
Yes! But it's almost impossible
for a strangerto get there...

1644
02:30:11,712 --> 02:30:15,546
Dr. Arya has kept very tight security
everywhere on the island

1645
02:30:15,883 --> 02:30:19,319
So that now no one comes between
him and the computer

1646
02:30:19,553 --> 02:30:22,852
Krishna, if Dr. Arya starts the computer

1647
02:30:23,490 --> 02:30:34,890
how much havoc he can wreak and
the destruction he can cause, is unimaginable

1648
02:30:36,136 --> 02:30:45,340
mine... yours... ours, the worlds
destiny will come in his clutches.

1649
02:30:46,580 --> 02:30:49,378
That's why, Dr Arya has to be
stopped at any cost.

1650
02:30:50,517 --> 02:30:55,579
Now you have to save not only yourfather
but the whole mankind, Krishna.

1651
02:31:01,928 --> 02:31:02,519
Hello.

1652
02:31:02,895 --> 02:31:03,793
Krishna?

1653
02:31:05,331 --> 02:31:06,195
Grandma!

1654
02:31:06,799 --> 02:31:09,791
Krishna, are you okay?

1655
02:31:12,071 --> 02:31:13,095
Yes, Grandma

1656
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:17,799
l don't know why l'm feeling worried.

1657
02:31:18,478 --> 02:31:20,002
When are you coming back?

1658
02:31:20,646 --> 02:31:21,908
Come back soon

1659
02:31:23,483 --> 02:31:30,252
Yourfather's death anniversary is nearing,
you need to be here and fulfill the duties of a son.

1660
02:31:31,791 --> 02:31:36,421
l remember, Grandma. don't worry...

1661
02:31:38,831 --> 02:31:40,856
l'll fulfill all the duties of a son.

1662
02:32:12,063 --> 02:32:13,690
WELCOME TO THE FUTURE

1663
02:32:16,368 --> 02:32:17,630
Congratulations Sir!

1664
02:32:22,307 --> 02:32:26,403
See, Rohit l've won!

1665
02:32:28,847 --> 02:32:34,080
Now if you want you can end your life.

1666
02:32:37,956 --> 02:32:40,446
Or do you want me to help?

1667
02:32:44,995 --> 02:32:55,803
But what's the hurry? At least see how your
invention is going to make me God!

1668
02:33:48,725 --> 02:33:58,191
Rohit, we built this computer
so that we can see ourfuture

1669
02:33:58,401 --> 02:33:59,891
and change it!

1670
02:34:02,438 --> 02:34:08,604
l will also change my future and show you
Today itself!

1671
02:34:17,520 --> 02:34:19,488
Dr Arya's gone to look forthe masked man

1672
02:34:21,457 --> 02:34:22,321
Masked man?

1673
02:34:44,446 --> 02:34:45,242
Kristian!

1674
02:34:51,753 --> 02:34:52,515
Krishna

1675
02:34:54,556 --> 02:34:55,887
Look Dr Arya!

1676
02:34:57,225 --> 02:34:58,055
Come on, let's go!

1677
02:35:13,642 --> 02:35:16,907
What had Kristian done? Why kill him?

1678
02:35:18,313 --> 02:35:22,976
Dr Arya has probably started the
computer and, he must've seen...

1679
02:35:23,184 --> 02:35:24,310
His future!

1680
02:35:25,953 --> 02:35:31,550
lt will be just as Dr Arya has seen.

1681
02:41:50,430 --> 02:41:53,695
l've changed my future!
l've changed my tomorrow!

1682
02:41:53,900 --> 02:41:55,834
There is no mask any longer...

1683
02:41:56,036 --> 02:42:02,271
Henceforth the new face of God is...
Dr Siddhant Arya!

1684
02:42:16,757 --> 02:42:19,021
How is this possible?

1685
02:42:20,327 --> 02:42:25,628
l've killed him with my own hands.
Then...who's this?

1686
02:42:26,932 --> 02:42:31,631
lts 9:15 there and it's 9 here.

1687
02:42:32,838 --> 02:42:35,306
This means, he'll be here in
the next 15 minutes.

1688
02:42:35,908 --> 02:42:38,877
that means he is already on the island!

1689
02:42:55,761 --> 02:42:56,420
Stop!

1690
02:43:00,699 --> 02:43:07,070
To capture him we need
planning not power.

1691
02:44:00,325 --> 02:44:04,318
Dr. Arya has kept very tight security
everywhere on the island.

1692
02:44:33,290 --> 02:44:39,195
You're good! Very good.
But l'm better

1693
02:44:46,703 --> 02:44:49,763
Yes, l am better

1694
02:44:51,308 --> 02:44:54,277
Because l have seen the future.

1695
02:44:59,950 --> 02:45:05,478
But due to lack of time what l
couldn't see is what l want to know...

1696
02:45:07,590 --> 02:45:09,421
Why do you want to kill me?

1697
02:45:11,794 --> 02:45:15,286
And why do you want to rescue Rohit Mehra?

1698
02:45:21,404 --> 02:45:22,632
Who are you?

1699
02:45:24,073 --> 02:45:28,203
Come to me and give me the answer.

1700
02:45:29,078 --> 02:45:29,840
come!

1701
02:45:42,358 --> 02:45:45,589
l've told you, l have seen the future

1702
02:45:46,128 --> 02:45:50,462
And l know who is with me...

1703
02:45:51,467 --> 02:45:52,331
Hello!

1704
02:45:53,035 --> 02:45:55,002
and who is against me

1705
02:45:56,271 --> 02:45:58,535
So...please cooperate

1706
02:47:01,135 --> 02:47:02,295
Who are you?

1707
02:47:05,139 --> 02:47:06,970
We'll get to know right now.

1708
02:49:12,397 --> 02:49:15,195
Who...are you?

1709
02:49:37,154 --> 02:49:39,850
Your son...Krishna!

1710
02:50:49,125 --> 02:50:49,853
Mom.

1711
02:52:26,887 --> 02:52:28,115
Thank you, Jadoo.

1712
02:52:30,224 --> 02:52:31,213
Thank you

1713
02:52:31,249 --> 02:53:30,249
