1
00:00:00,898 --> 00:00:02,257
<i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>

2
00:00:02,329 --> 00:00:03,414
THOMPKINS: What's your record

3
00:00:03,438 --> 00:00:06,338
for how many banks
you've robbed in one day?

4
00:00:06,441 --> 00:00:08,867
GORDON: You can't take ownership
of everyone's problems.

5
00:00:08,945 --> 00:00:10,222
THOMPKINS: We all have our flaws.

6
00:00:10,246 --> 00:00:12,046
But you're still breaking the law.

7
00:00:12,148 --> 00:00:14,966
JEROME: <i>I want you to throw me a wake.</i>

8
00:00:15,044 --> 00:00:16,317
<i>Dig me up.</i>

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,496
NYGMA: I would liberate Lee Thompkins

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,050
with surgical precision.

11
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,620
Dead or alive,

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,360
- Jerome uses distractions.
- Got a plan for that?

13
00:00:27,464 --> 00:00:28,996
Bruce?

14
00:00:29,098 --> 00:00:30,231
Jeremiah.

15
00:00:31,434 --> 00:00:32,867
Oh, God, no.

16
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:33,969
He's still alive.

17
00:00:35,004 --> 00:00:38,139
JEREMIAH: Jerome is dead.

18
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:40,741
Long live me.

19
00:00:40,844 --> 00:00:42,521
I could not have done any of this...

20
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:44,912
without your help.

21
00:00:45,014 --> 00:00:47,081
Those generators that we built...

22
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:50,151
work even better as bombs.

23
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:52,720
(explosion)

24
00:00:52,822 --> 00:00:54,522
(alarms blaring)

25
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,500
<i>Sources tell us Captain James Gordon</i>

26
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,730
<i>was at the scene
and is missing and feared dead.</i>

27
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,910
<i>Investigators are certainly looking into</i>

28
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,510
<i>what could have caused
the sudden explosion.</i>

29
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,180
Harvey.

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,459
I just got off the phone
with Search and Rescue.

31
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,090
Whatever blew Jeremiah's bunker

32
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,250
was catastrophic.

33
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,620
There are no signs of life.

34
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,760
Tell 'em to keep looking.

35
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,006
- Harvey, I think...
- Listen.

36
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,990
Jim found his way out, understand?

37
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,200
NEWSWOMAN: <i>Has dispatched
an investigative unit,</i>

38
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,520
<i>which is currently canvassing the area,</i>

39
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,500
<i>looking for any traces
of Captain Gordon.</i>

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Screw that, and screw her.

41
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,370
Listen, in two minutes, Jim Gordon's

42
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,886
gonna come walking through that door

43
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,140
and chew all your asses out

44
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,780
for standing around
and not doing your job.

45
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,970
Now, first responders
are on the scene. I want CSls

46
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,010
out there pronto, and I want

47
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,519
everyone looking for Jeremiah Valeska

48
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,520
and Bruce Wayne.

49
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,120
That's who Jim was looking for

50
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,136
- when this whole thing went blooey.
- You ain't the captain.

51
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,160
The captain ain't here.

52
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,490
I'm ranking detective.

53
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,960
Last time we followed you,

54
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,730
the Pyg slaughtered us.

55
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,200
All right, look, enough.

56
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,800
Jim trusts him, okay?

57
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,770
So everybody get back to work.

58
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,410
ALVAREZ: Harvey.

59
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,270
Jeremiah Valeska wasn't
inside the bunker when it blew.

60
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,370
How do you know?

61
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,110
'Cause he's outside, and he's not alone.

62
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,620
What the hell?

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,560
You might not recognize
Jerome's followers,

64
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,830
as I've given them
something of a makeover.

65
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,530
But I assure you, they're as loyal to me

66
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,000
as they ever were to him.

67
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,560
More so.

68
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,570
'Cause I accomplished something
my brother never could:

69
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,940
Killing James Gordon.

70
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,186
CULTISTS: Jeremiah! Jeremiah!

71
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,370
You're a liar!

72
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,870
Not so fast.

73
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,710
I have bombs planted around the city,

74
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,710
just like the one
that killed Jim Gordon.

75
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,050
CULTISTS: Jeremiah! Jeremiah!

76
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,530
All you need to know is,
if I hit this detonator,

77
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,920
Gotham is blown back to the Stone Age.

78
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,860
If I pull this trigger,

79
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,000
your brains are blown
through the back of your skull.

80
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,370
Dead man's switch. You're familiar.

81
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,536
It's another little something
I took from my brother,

82
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,270
except mine's a bit more advanced.

83
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,410
You shoot me, my thumb loosens,

84
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,880
and then boom, boom,

85
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,900
boom, boom.

86
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,000
No, you will do what I say.

87
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,100
- You're more sick than your brother.
- (chuckles)

88
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,470
Don't compare me to that
short-sighted psychopath.

89
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,610
He just wanted to destroy things.

90
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,010
Me, I'm a builder.

91
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,320
I'm gonna create
a new Gotham in my image.

92
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,390
But every artist
needs a blank canvas, so...

93
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,050
all of this has to go.

94
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,890
I detonate the explosives in six hours.

95
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,790
I want the city empty when I do.

96
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,530
You need us to evacuate
Gotham in six hours?

97
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,200
That's impossible!

98
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,030
Then everyone who dies screaming,

99
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:59,010
who watches their loved ones
crushed before them,

100
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,370
will have you to thank,
Detective Bullock.

101
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,070
Look...

102
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,880
nobody has to die.

103
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,880
Well,

104
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,480
except for these people.

105
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,550
I know seeing is believing,

106
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,020
and I do want you to believe me, so...

107
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,850
(bystanders screaming)

108
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,260
Oh, my God!

109
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,430
Get officers on the scene now! Go!

110
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,060
Six hours, Detective.

111
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,570
The clock is ticking.

112

113
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,280
Shame. I liked the clock tower.

114
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,630
Jim took me there on a date once.

115
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,220
Now they're both up in smoke.

116
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,920
Good riddance.

117
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,520
He always did want to die a hero.

118
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,980
OSWALD: And that was Jim's problem.

119
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,500
Me? I'd rather live.

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,430
- And live well.
- Hmm.

121
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,370
If it isn't little Penguin.

122
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,130
Oh, and Butch's corpse.

123
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,110
Hey, Tabby.

124
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,680
Butch.

125
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,710
The man responsible
for the recent fireworks

126
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,980
is Jeremiah Valeska.

127
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,840
Twin brother of our old associate.

128
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,720
He has plans for Gotham.

129
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,220
Plans we learned about

130
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,290
courtesy of this gentleman.

131
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,830
They ripped out my fingernails.

132
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,970
I believe that this
is a golden opportunity

133
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,160
for cash and glory.

134
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,830
Normally, I would keep

135
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,730
both of them for myself.

136
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,490
But I find myself a bit short

137
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,090
of the necessary manpower.

138
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,760
- Or womanpower, if you will.
- Hmm.

139
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,310
I'll go fifty-fifty on the take.

140
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,450
An alliance with you?

141
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,350
I'll pass.

142
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,920
Pity. With the money

143
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,090
we were gonna make,
I'd hoped to finally be able

144
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,750
to cure Butch of his condition.

145
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,460
Wait, what do you mean?

146
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,360
Hugo Strange ran Indian Hill.

147
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,770
Indian Hill's toxic sludge
turned Butch into this.

148
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,270
Hugo Strange can fix Butch.

149
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,000
But it won't be cheap.

150
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,110
Strange might be my only hope, Tabby.

151
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,710
Don't look at me like that.

152
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,310
I almost got killed

153
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,450
fighting your ex-boyfriend's
rotting corpse.

154
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,350
I think it's time to return the favor.

155
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,620
Fine. But Swamp Boy keeps his funk

156
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,740
ten feet from me at all times.

157
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,460
What did you have in mind?

158
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,630
Evacuate the city in six hours?

159
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,700
Five and a half hours.
And it will happen,

160
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,840
because this maniac has bombs
hidden all over Gotham.

161
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,540
Think of how many lives are at stake.

162
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,510
And every minute you hesitate

163
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,310
means fewer people get to safety.

164
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,010
We'll need police.

165
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,680
We are police! We're here to help.

166
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,380
Harper, please, will you help the mayor?

167
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,880
HARPER: You got it.

168
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,250
BULLOCK: Holy mother of God.

169
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,990
Bruce Wayne.

170
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,890
Hey. Bruce.

171
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,160
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

172
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,000
I heard about Jim. Is it true?

173
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,260
As far as I'm concerned,
Jim Gordon is alive, kicking,

174
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,170
- and waiting for us to find him.
- Detective.

175
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,840
Don't lie to me.

176
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,740
It's not looking good, kid.

177
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,270
I was hoping you could help me.
Did you see Jim?

178
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,740
How did you get out of the bunker?

179
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,326
Jeremiah and I
had already left the bunker.

180
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,380
Jerome... Jerome sprayed him with a gas

181
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,796
- that drove him insane.
- I'm so sick of that freaking family.

182
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,710
Did you hear about Gotham Clock Tower?

183
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,720
Huh? This guy's got
these massive explosives...

184
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,020
- It's my fault.
- What?

185
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,060
Jeremiah had plans

186
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,760
to create next-generation generators.

187
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,760
I funded him.

188
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,330
Wayne Enterprises built those bombs?!

189
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,070
(exhales)

190
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,770
Listen, the-the schematics
for the batteries

191
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,910
should be in the Wayne
Enterprises R&D lab.

192
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,310
Lucius could take a look at them,

193
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,516
figure out how to disarm the bombs.

194
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,596
- I'm-I'm gonna go get them now.
- No, no, no, no, no.

195
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,410
- You're going home.
- No, I have to do...

196
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,680
Look, I know you feel guilty.

197
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,700
But Jim Gordon was... is... important

198
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,890
to all of us.

199
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,740
And it's my job, so go home.

200
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,290
Be with Alfred. Be safe.

201
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,790
It's what Jim would want.

202
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,400
- Lucius!
- (sighs)

203
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,000
(phone ringing)

204
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,070
Alfred, where have you been?

205
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,310
JEREMIAH: <i>No, not Alfred.</i>

206
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,210
I hope you didn't catch a cold
in my brother's grave.

207
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:36,410
I know those things aren't
exactly designed for the living.

208
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,750
What have you done?

209
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,150
Where's Alfred?!

210
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,750
Such anger.

211
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:46,160
Some people... not me, of course...

212
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,540
might consider that ingratitude,

213
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,320
considering all I've done for you,

214
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,140
<i>all I'm still doing for you.</i>

215
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,760
You mean lying to me?

216
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,260
Using my company to build bombs?

217
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,600
Trying to kill me?

218
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,430
Bruce, let's get something straight.

219
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,930
If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

220
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,870
I'd have put a bullet through your brain

221
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,110
and left you to rot in that grave.

222
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,340
But I meant what I said.

223
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,350
You're my best friend,

224
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,550
and today I'm gonna prove it to you.

225
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,720
You are insane.

226
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,720
You killed Jim Gordon.

227
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,390
<i>And if you don't want
your manservant to die, too,</i>

Be there in an hour.
Tell the police and I'll know.

231
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,970
Just like I know
that's where you are right now.

The Narrows.

242

I was in Jeremiah's bunker.
There was a bomb.

Ed had you followed.

244
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,260
His people found you after the blast.

245
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,690
I'll have to thank him
when I arrest him.

246
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,870
I'm surprised he didn't kill me.

I don't really know.

Lee,

251
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,400
I have to get back to the GCPD.

252
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,330
Jerome's brother Jeremiah...

253
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,630
Blew up the Gotham Clock Tower
about an hour ago.

254
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,400
The city's being evacuated.

255
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,310
I have to... (grunts)

256
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,500
It's just a painkiller.

257
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,110
It does make you easier to handle.

258
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,880
You're not going anywhere.

259
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,120
My jacket. In my jacket...

260
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,930
I got those from Jeremiah's office.

261
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,160
They may give us some clue
as to what he's planning.

262
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,800
- Please, let me take them to Harvey.
- Oh, Jim,

263
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,440
you still think that you're the
only one who can save the city.

264
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,190
Wait.

265
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,560
Get some rest.

266
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,560
Doctor's orders.

00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,930
(door locks)

268
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,820
Jeremiah's followers
must have taken Alfred

00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,240
while I was at the cemetery.

270
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,970
I bet he put up a fight.

271
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,280
Thanks again for meeting me, Selina.

272
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,580
- Sure.
- I didn't have anyone else to call.

273
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,516
I know it's asking a lot, so
I just really appreciate...

274
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,560
Bruce, I'm gonna be here
whenever you need me.

275
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,510
Okay, that's the address.

276
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,430
I don't see anyone, though.

277
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,760
That could be a trap, right?

278
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,800
I don't know.

279
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,040
Jeremiah could've killed me
at the cemetery.

280
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,600
He wants something out of me.

281
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,770
Like what, to be your best friend?

282
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,960
Trap or not, if Alfred's
in there, I need to find out.

Alfred.

You want to help Jim Gordon?

Have you lost your mind?

295
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,586
You brought him here because you thought

296
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,520
it would give us leverage with the GCPD.

297
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,750
Yes. By holding him hostage.

298
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,480
This drawing is the key
to Valeska's plan.

299
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,120
We solve it and we trade
the information for clemency.

300
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,750
Perhaps.

301
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,420
Or...

302
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,960
perhaps there's something more going on.

303
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,160
(sighs)

304
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,100
What happened between Jim and I is over.

305
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,070
I'm trying to protect what we've built.

306
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,640
- I still like my plan better.
- Ed, if this maniac

307
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,550
levels half the city, it's
gonna disrupt food distribution,

308
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,140
water supply, power.

309
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,480
The people of the Narrows
will suffer the most.

310
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,850
We can prevent that,
while, at the same time,

311
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,850
helping us out of this mess we're in.

312
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,590
Please.

313
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,460
Fine.

314
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,960
(sighs)

315
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,530

318
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,410

329

God, what a mess. Just make it happen.

330
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,840

- Excuse me.

00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,156
All right, let's control this...

332
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,710
I got the schematics
from Wayne Enterprises R&D.

333
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,990
The Wayne kid said
the bombs were batteries.

334
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,630
A series of networked
self-perpetuating generators.

335
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,050
But when supercharged,

336
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,190
they contain enough energy
to level a city block.

337
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,860
Got it. Battery bombs from hell.

338
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,420
Just tell me this will help us
find and disable them.

339
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,630
Disable, yes. Find, no. But...

340
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,460
look, look here.

341
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,000
Because they were created
to be networked together,

342
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,546
Jeremiah would have to send the signal

343
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,370
a centrally located core relay in order

344
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,136
to blow all the bombs
from a single detonator.

345
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,940
Lucius, just English, please.

346
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,920
Sorry. The bombs are connected
by a nervous system.

347
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,500
The core relay is the brain.

348
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,856
We find that, we destroy that...

349
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,410
We can stop the bombs from going off.

350
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,550
- Yes.
- But how do we find it?

351
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,720
How do we find this...

352
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,090
brain?

353
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,490
(horns honking in distance)

354
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,430
Oh, Bruce.

355
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:03,130
You are about to have a very
transformative experience.

356
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,800
I envy you.

357
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,410
Call our friend.

358
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,340
Tell him to kill the butler.

359
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,480
He's no longer necessary.

360
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,030
Oswald Cobblepot.

361
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,360
Barbara Kean.

362
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,200
In my stronghold.

363
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,470
Not one step closer, Mr. Valeska.

364
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,450
And is that my dear Jongleur
with my core relay in his hand

365
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,310
and a grenade taped to his mouth?

366
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,040
Indeed, it is.

367
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,390
Huh. Well,

368
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,350
it seems you have the upper hand.

369
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,350
Undoubtedly.

370
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,090
And now...

371
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,760
we have our own demands.

372
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,720
$50 million.

373
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,700
That's what you want.

374
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,500
It's a nice round number.

375
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,900
I don't quite have that on me right now.

376
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:18,200
You gave the mayor six
hours to evacuate Gotham.

377
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,810
An impossible task.

378
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,350
Let him buy another hour.

379
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,470
He will save thousands of lives.

380
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,940
$50 million will seem cheap.

381
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,050
I see.

382
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,560
I play the villain,
you get away scot-free and rich.

383
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,970
I get you the money,

384
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,840
you give me back my core relay.

385
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,490
That is usually how
a handoff works. Yeah.

386
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,580
You drive a hard bargain,
but I'll see what I can do.

387
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,510
BARBARA: Just like that?

388
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,650
After knowing your brother,
I expected something more...

389
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,950
Insane?

390
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:55,080
I'm nothing if not sane. And reasonable.

391
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,850
Two things my brother never valued.

392
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,410
Which is why I'll be successful
where he failed.

393
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,600
Well, that and being...

394
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,330
vastly more intelligent.

395
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,670
Now, to see about your money.

396
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,270
(line ringing)

397
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,580
This is Jeremiah Valeska.

398
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,006
I'd like to speak to the mayor.

399
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,770
I have additional demands.

400
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,810
Yes, really.

401
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,660
$50 million,

402
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,190
unmarked bills.
I'll tell you the location.

403
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,566
We're not just
gonna hand this thing over

404
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,320
and let him destroy Gotham, are we?

405
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,590
Of course not. Once we get the money,

406
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,896
we kill Jeremiah and his people,

407
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,720
give the core relay to the police,

408
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,060
split the $50 million,

409
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,830
and are hailed as the heroes of Gotham.

410
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,700
And we cure Butch.

411
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,400
And that. Certainly.

412
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,680
JEREMIAH: Would you believe it?

413
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,740
They put me on hold.

414
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,470
Well,

415
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,680
there's always plan number two.

416
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,310
- Get down!
- Wait!

417
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,650
(shouting, gasping)

418
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,420
(coughing)

419
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,390
Are you out of your mind?!

420
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,560
Why do you keep insisting I'm insane?

421
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,230
What's insane about
having a backup plan?

422
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,070
Something Jongleur never knew about.

423
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,710
And, so you know, this building
is within the blast radius.

424
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,110
And because of your interference,

425
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,386
I'm gonna detonate the bombs as soon

426
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:28,180
as I'm far enough away to observe
the destruction in peace.

427
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,180
BARBARA: No!
You promised the city six hours!

428
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,420
And whose fault is it
that I changed my mind?

429
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,380
Tell our men to rewire the bombs
to work in direct sequence.

430
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,240
And, the rest of you,

431
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,520
kill these idiots.

432
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,270
Alfred!

433
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,700
JEREMIAH: <i>Hello, Bruce.</i>

434
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,640
Jeremiah!

435
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,070
<i>I imagine you're wondering,</i>

436
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,940
<i>why is Jeremiah doing this?</i>

437
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,790
<i>My brother once said,
"All it takes is one bad day</i>

438
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:04,580
<i>to reduce the sanest man alive
to lunacy."</i>

439
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,220
(Alfred screaming)

440
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,200
<i>Jerome gave me what I thought
was the worst day of my life.</i>

441
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,130
<i>But only by losing everything
was I able to face</i>

442
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,290
<i>what was inside me.</i>

443
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:18,290
<i>And I believe I've seen
something very special</i>

444
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,980
<i>- inside of you as well.</i>
- Alfred.

445
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,100
<i>But to free it, you'll have to lose</i>

446
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,200
<i>everything and everyone you hold dear.</i>

447
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,610
(raspy breathing)

448
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,520
<i>I instructed Scarecrow to mix up
something exceptional.</i>

449
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,940
No!

450
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,150
<i>Your butler is going to
show you the path ahead.</i>

451
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,550
(cackling)

452
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,850
<i>Now watch closely.</i>

453
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,770
(Alfred screaming)

454
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,660
BRUCE: No. No!

455
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,660
Alfred!

456
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,650
Hello, sleepyhead.

457
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,820
You do realize the city
is about to be blown up?

458
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,650
It's an odd time for a nap.

459
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,270
You know that she drugged me.

460
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,790
Yeah. Don't really care.

461
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,450
Thank you, gentlemen.

462
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,690
I want to make one thing very clear.

463
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,710
If Gotham becomes a rock pile,
I mind zero percent.

464
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,500
I'm only helping you

465
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,570
because I'm with Lee now.

466
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,670
Fine. Whatever.

467
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,510
Feign nonchalance. It's very cute.

468
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,340
It's almost convincing.

469
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,240
Ed, Jeremiah Valeska is threatening

470
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,550
to destroy half the city.

471
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,650
You really think I care
if you've deluded yourself

472
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,350
into thinking you and Lee are a couple?

473
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,690
You see...

474
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,720
that is my point.

475
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,320
You don't believe that Lee
could actually love me, do you?

476
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,730
Honestly? No.

477
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,730
- Hmm.
- You're a psychopath and a murderer.

478
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,160
And the fact that you need me

479
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,830
to validate your crazy fantasy

480
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,430
means that you don't believe it either.

481
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,570
That doesn't matter. What matters

482
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,246
is stopping Jeremiah
from killing thousands

483
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,740
of people, so can we...?

484
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,540
Yeah.

485
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,040
- We're gonna settle this.
- Ed.

486
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,110
No, Jim.

487
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,750
This isn't the GCPD.

488
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,410
Here, I make the rules,
so we're not gonna do this

489
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,066
until we talk about
what I want to talk about.

490
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,890
Lee's changed. I accept that.

491
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,350
Maybe she will never be
the person that I knew.

492
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,590
Fine. But she is not
who you think she is.

493
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,590
(scoffs)

494
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,030
The fact that she's with you

495
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,530
in whatever way she's with you...

496
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,960
Oh, Jim.

497
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,970
She's with me in every way.

498
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,740
Means that she wants
something from you.

499
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,610
So when it's done,
she'll get rid of you.

500
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,480
So you're saying that she
wouldn't be with a killer?

501
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,370
And yet... she was with you.

502
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,760
And you, Jim, are ten times
the killer that I ever was.

503
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,510
You have a point.

504
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,800
Maybe that's why she's not with me now.

505
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,300
Can we do this?

506
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,500
Why not?

507
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,470
Just try to keep up. I'll speak slowly.

508
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,740
So, most labyrinths

509
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,110
are constructed as contiguous lines

510
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,940
along concentric circles.

511
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,420
One way in, one way out.
But this one's different.

512
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,850
Undoubtedly.

513
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,420
Those red rectangles...

514
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,590
they're unbound on one side.

515
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,420
And they overlap black lines

516
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,090
which would lead out of the labyrinth.

517
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,770
So maybe we're not looking at plans...

518
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,780
but the end result.

519
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,430
Voilà.

520
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,740
Look familiar?

521
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,780
GORDON: So this...

522
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,380
is Wayne Enterprises.

523
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,850
This would be Gotham Central Bank.

524
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,490
These are the buildings
Jeremiah's planning

525
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,390
to demolish with his bombs.

526
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,360
Once those buildings are blown,

527
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,670
they collapse and create the labyrinth

528
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,060
from the finished drawing.

529
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,790
Jeremiah lived
his entire life in a maze.

530
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,300
Now he's trying to remake the city

531
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,900
into the place he feels most safe.

532
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,900
It's actually rather elegant.

533
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,700
I need to get to the GCPD.

534
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,170
(scoffs): Yeah, no, sorry.

535
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,586
You're not going anywhere until we get

536
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:22,716
this information to the mayor.

537
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,540
Lee and I have some

538
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,680
legal knots we need untangled.

539
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,480
Yeah. Before we spend the rest
of our lives together.

540
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,510
So you're gonna use this
to hold the city hostage?

541
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,680
Time is running out.

542
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,996
Well, then the mayor would be wise

543
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,210
to forgive Lee and I our indiscretions.

544
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,020
Ed, wait.

545
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,390
There's one thing I can't figure out.

546
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,830
One?

547
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,176
You're being a little kind to yourself.

548
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,730
Yeah. I'm sorry.

549
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,070
I think you made a mistake.

550
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,230
Where?

551
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,740
(grunts)

552
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,570
Get the core relay, he says.

553
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,110
Have the upper hand, he says.

554
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,640
(yelling)

555
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,830
Finally.

556
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,230
Let's get the hell out of here

557
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,570
before Jeremiah blows us all
to smithereens.

558
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,840
Ah, this is all your fault, Oswald.

559
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,040
- You'd better...
- Fix it. I know.

560
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,070
(panting)

561
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:24,140
(phone rings)

562
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,020
- What?
- OSWALD: <i>Harvey.</i>

563
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:29,180
Is this Oswald?

564
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,720
I'm, uh, kind of busy.

565
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,210
I have information regarding

566
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,700
- Jeremiah Valeska's plan.
- (groans)

567
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,530
- <i>What information?</i>
- Ah.

568
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,830
Wait a second. Is that gunfire?

569
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,100
<i>Just listen.</i>

570
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,100
Jeremiah is not honoring the six hours.

571
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,450
He will blow the bombs

572
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,946
<i>as soon as he can watch the catastrophe</i>

573
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,840
<i>from a safe distance.</i>

574
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,840
Jeremiah said something
about rewiring the bombs

575
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,016
<i>to communicate with each other.</i>

576
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,940
<i>He called it a direct sequence.</i>

577
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,780
Communicate with each other.

578
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,480
<i>Harvey.</i>

579
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,750
Harvey!

580
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,840
It's a backup system from when
they operated as batteries.

581
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,450
That means we can disrupt them

582
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,420
by disarming the first bomb
in the sequence.

583
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,720
It's like removing one light

584
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,140
from a string of Christmas lights.

585
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,636
If only we knew where the bombs were.

586
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,160
- (door closes)
- MAN: He's back. Hey.

587
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,400
(officers exclaiming)

588
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,630
Jim! Oh.

589
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,140
Oh, buddy.

590
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,700
Oh.

591
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,160
All right, easy there, big fella.

592
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,470
Remember, I just got blown up.

593
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,820
How'd you get out of the bunker?

594
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,000
It's a long story. But what matters is,

595
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,250
I have the locations of every
bomb Jeremiah planted.

596
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,120
BRUCE: Alfred.

597
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,140
(indistinct chatter and laughter)

598
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,950
Alfred.

599
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,100
Alfred.

600
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,240
(both laugh)

601
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,570
Alfred.

602
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:03,520
Jeremiah said Bruce Wayne might
try to bring his friends.

603
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,010
I suppose you're one of them.

604
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,510
What? No. I just wandered in here.

605
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,690
I think our little experiment

606
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,530
is about to get much more interesting.

607
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,210
Jeremiah wasn't bluffing.

608
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,140
There's at least
a dozen bombs on this map.

609
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,600
But you're saying if we disarm
one of them in the sequence,

610
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,210
we'll stop all of them from going off.

611
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,760
And according to this,
the closest one is just a mile away.

612
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,056
I need to look at the schematics

613
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,456
to determine the best
way to neutralize them.

614
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,010
Alert the bomb squad.
Tell 'em to meet me there.

615
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,530
Wait. Harvey.

616
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,680
Let the bomb squad handle this.
You don't have to go.

617
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,790
Yes, I do. I need this, Jim.

618
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,170
Yeah.

619
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:47,630
(grunting)

620
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,900
- (bones crunch)
- (screams)

621
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:54,070
(screaming)

622
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,450
(Selina screams)

623
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,750
It doesn't matter.

624
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,390
The experiment is nearing

625
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,890
its conclusion.

626
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,890
Your friend will soon be driven mad.

627
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,400
(rock music playing)

628
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,210
(screams)

629
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,140
(Bruce screaming)

630
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,980
Stop!

631
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,080
(screaming)

632
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,120
No!

633
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,390
(screaming)

634
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,130
(Alfred laughing)

635
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,260
BRUCE: Alfred.

636
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,270
(laughing)

637
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,450
(Alfred continues laughing)

638
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,380
Alfred, please.

639
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,100
Please stop.

640
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,150
(laughing)

641
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,370
Alfred.

642
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,350
(both grunting)

643
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,370
Alfred. Alfred, stop!

644
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,610
- (laughs)
- Alfred!

645
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,520
Just stop. Alfred. Please.

646
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,260
- (yells)
- (screams)

647
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,890
(Bruce screaming)

648
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,460
(pounding on door, muffled grunting)

649
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,860
What...?

650
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,340
(grunting)

651
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,080
- (groans)
- Oh, come on, Brucie.

652
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,580
Give me a smile.

653
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,620
- Smile.
- (grunts)

654
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,700
Alfred, listen to me.

655
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,420
You can beat this. You can fight this.

656
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,320
(groans)

657
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,420
Alfred, you're stronger than him.

658
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,130
(laughs)

659
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,540
(groans)

660
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,300
Do not let him win!

661
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,160
(laughing)

662
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,300
(gunshot)

663
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:54,670
No! No! Alfred!

664
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:57,470
- Bruce. Bruce. Bruce. Bruce.
- Alfred! Alfred!

665
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,040
Breathe. Look at me.

666
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,650
Scarecrow was just pumping
his fear gas in here.

667
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,110
You were only seeing
what he wanted you to.

668
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,520
No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

669
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,706
ALFRED: No, Bruce, Bruce, Bruce.

670
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,630
Bruce, Bruce!

671
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,460
Listen. Listen to me. Listen.

672
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,700
Look at me, look.

673
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,380
Just look at me.

674
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,450
Look, I'm fine.

675
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,620
It's me.

676
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,160
It's Alfred.

677
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,650
Alfred.

678
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,990
Alfred.

679
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,980
- (car horns honking)
- (indistinct shouting)

680
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,660
(phone ringing)

681
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,260
Hey.

682
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,230
I'm at the site.
Where the hell's the bomb squad?

683
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,700
The evacuation's jamming the
streets. They're still en route.

684
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:56,370
I can't wait. I got to go in.

685
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,340
Do you see the bomb?

686
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,480
I don't know what it's supposed
to look like, but I think

687
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,190
it is exactly what I'm staring at.

688
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:07,840
Oh, Lucius, we got to do this thing.

689
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,510
- Harvey...
- <i>Listen. We can't wait.</i>

690
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,120
We don't know when Jeremiah's
gonna set this thing off.

691
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,966
Then you're gonna have
to unscrew the antenna

692
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,220
- to activate the kill switch.
- <i>Okay.</i>

693
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,220
(panting)

694
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,960
- (whirring)
- Ah, Lucius.

695
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,860
<i>It's making some kind of weird noise.</i>

696
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,070
What kind of a noise?

697
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,480
A bad one, and-and it's-it's, uh,

698
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,070
getting all glow-y.

699
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,740
Then you are going to have
to work quickly.

700
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,940
<i>Okay.</i>

701
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:46,620
CULTISTS: Jeremiah! Jeremiah!

702
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:51,890
- (beep)
- All my life,

703
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,460
I spent by myself.

704
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:57,000
Hidden away.

705
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:01,290
I am so glad
to be sharing this happy moment

706
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,470
with all of you.

707
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,300
Today marks the dawning
of a new Gotham City.

708
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,080
One where we will all be free.

709
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,310
Now...

710
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,120
shall I do the honors?

711
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,350
<i>Once you unscrew the antenna,</i>

712
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,960
<i>a kill switch breaker should pop out.</i>

713
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,206
<i>Destroying it should stop
the signal from the detonator</i>

714
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,260
<i>to all the bombs.</i>

715
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,660
(whirring)

716
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,770
Which breaker is it?

717
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,370
What?

718
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,446
- What do you mean, which breaker?
- <i>There are two of 'em.</i>

719
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:42,600
Jeremiah must've changed them since
making these schematics.

720
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,710
- Okay. I'll break both of 'em.
- <i>No, wait, Harvey,</i>

721
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,940
one of the breakers could be
the supercharge fail-safe.

722
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,526
Whatever you do, do not touch that one.

723
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,710
Or?

724
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,520
Or all the bombs will blow.

725
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,160
Lucius, they're identical.

726
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,270
Then, Harvey, I don't know.

727
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,560
MAN: <i>We interrupt this program...</i>

728
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,890
- WOMAN: That's Jim Gordon!
- He's not dead.

729
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,280
GORDON: <i>This is a message
to the followers of Jeremiah Valeska.</i>

730
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,510
<i>Jeremiah claims to have killed me.</i>

731
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,500
<i>Well, bad news,</i>

732
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,300
<i>I'm alive.</i>

733
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,570
(murmuring)

734
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,870
No. No, no, it's a trick.

735
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:19,210
- I killed him.
- <i>So, just know</i>

736
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,510
<i>you're worshipping a fraud.</i>

737
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,150
<i>A pale imitation of Jerome.</i>

738
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,150
<i>You did your worst, Jeremiah,</i>

739
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,520
<i>and I'm still here.</i>

740
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,300
- You lied to us.
- Gordon's alive.

741
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,920
What does it matter whether he's alive?

742
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,990
When I hit this switch,

743
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:41,400
we will hear the sounds
of a new world being born.

744
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,540
(muttering)

745
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,710
Our world.

746
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,490
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

747
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,880
Which of you will make it blow?

748
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,820
Now,

749
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,880
listen.

750
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,360
(chuckles)

751
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,760
(pants)

752
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,310
- He's a liar!
- He's a fake!

753
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,440
- Liar!
- (shouting)

754
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,710
- Stop!
- (shouting stops)

755
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,150
(chuckles quietly)

756
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,920
I want you all to know

757
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,130
I find your fickleness

758
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,730
quite hurtful.

759
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,600
And more so,

760
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,410
very predictable.

761
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,610
(shouting)

762
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:11,590
(screaming)

763
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,250
Well, that is disappointing.

764
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,190
If you'd ask me this morning

765
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,980
how many people I was gonna kill today,

766
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,770
I would've been way off.

767
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,180
Perhaps the outcome was
not what we had hoped,

768
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,640
- but it was worth the risk.
- Ozzie,

769
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,880
if I were you, I would limp out
of here while you still can.

770
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,110
Fine.

771
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,550
Let's go, Butch.

772
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,790
Nope.

773
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:40,720
I'm done.

774
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,350
Ever since we teamed up,

775
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,630
everything's gone to crap.

776
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,490
Hell, we don't even
know where Strange is.

777
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:49,220
Except I do know where Strange is.

778
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,770
You mean to tell me
you've known where he is

779
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,086
the whole time and haven't told me?!

780
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,010
(strained): I just got word.

781
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,350
No more excuses!

782
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:58,570
He fixes me now!

783
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,550
And how exactly do we pay him?

784
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,660
I can be very persuasive.

785
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,700
Think. Think.

786
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,176
Think, think, think,
think, think, think.

787
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,130
How did they beat you, huh?

788
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,570
How did they figure you out?

789
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:20,280
Hmm, Gordon must've stolen
the blueprints to the maze,

790
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,040
found one of the bombs,
and sabotaged the sequence.

791
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,880
Hmm.

792
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,320
I'll have to start again.

793
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,460
RA'S AL GHUL: You're tenacious.

794
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,770
I like that.

795
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,120
Who are you?

796
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,320
What do you want?

797
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,320
I had a vision.

798
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,260
Of Gotham in flames.

799
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,300
Together, we can make that happen.

800
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,730
Well, I appreciate the offer,

801
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,630
but recent events have convinced me

802
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,340
of the benefits of working alone.

803
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,170
Don't be so rash.

804
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,110
Your dream of a new Gotham
will come to be.

805
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,430
With my help.

806
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,120
(sighs)

807
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:07,090
You're behind me, aren't you?

808
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,910
I can conquer Gotham on my own.

809
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,580
What makes you think I need your help,

810
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,210
whoever you are?

811
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,110
Because, my boy,

812
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:23,150
all this is not just about Gotham.

813
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:28,660
This is about Bruce Wayne.

814
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:44,740
You here to arrest me?

815
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,140
To thank you.

816
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:50,480
And to present you with an offer.

817
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,800
Leave Gotham.

818
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,350
Start a new life somewhere else.

819
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,190
Alone.

820
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:01,460
(sighs)

821
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,530
And if I don't?

822
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,220
I know we can't change the past.

823
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,640
What we've done.

824
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,310
Or done to each other.

825
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:23,580
I can't pretend to recognize
the person I see before me.

826
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:31,590
But whatever happens
