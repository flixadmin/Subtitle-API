1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,140
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,550
Shut up and Die!

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,119
Say hello to Butch.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,400
No!

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,240
She's paralyzed and has
lost the will to live.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,120
If Selina ingests this,
it'll find its way

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,140
to her wound.

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,360
I'm better.

9
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,460
So now I have to find
the freak who shot me.

10
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,060
Welcome to the Church of Jeremiah.

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,900
Selina!

12
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,540
This time, woke up on a rooftop.

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,620
No idea how I got there

14
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,150
or what happened during
the preceding hours.

15
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,150
- Who the hell are you?
- You don't remember?

16
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,780
What is happening to me?

17
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,200
Gonna need people I can trust
watching over this place.

18
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,979
You could be my deputy here in Haven.

19
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,989
Thanks.

20
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,460
Well, if it isn't my old friend

21
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,560
Mr. Penn.

22
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,170
You shouldn't have come here, Oswald.

23
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,060
Perhaps you shouldn't
have stolen my people.

24
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,319
- Hi, Pengy.
- Jim!

25
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,330
Barbara, no.

26
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,720
Over here!

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,540
Over here!

28
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,999
Over here!

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,400
This woman needs medical attention.

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,760
Find a doctor. Go. Hey, hey!

31
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,760
You! Hey, listen up.

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,079
Pair up.

33
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,999
I need teams going in
looking for survivors.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,250
Go. Get those people back!

35
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,480
Hey. You.

36
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,450
Set up a triage over here.

37
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,580
Hey. Hey, come on. Snap to.

38
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,960
Focus. There's gonna
be a lot of wounded.

39
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,890
Look at me. Look at me.

40
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,280
All right. Find all the
medical supplies you can. Go.

41
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,340
You did this. You
brought the gangs here!

42
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,220
No! I would never allow that.

43
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,369
None of them had explosives,
that I know of.

44
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,380
Jim!

45
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,800
We need to get these fires out, Harvey.

46
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,560
We got nothing to put hoses on.

47
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,810
Use the drinking water. Do it.

48
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,919
Hey. Hey!

49
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,240
Get those hoses over here now!

50
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,320
Jim.

51
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,080
Harvey. Flames are dying.

52
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,380
We can get more teams inside.

53
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,820
- There have to be survivors.
- I know.

54
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,980
It's just, an officer just found this.

55
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,500
It's yours.

56

57
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,260
As of now, the death toll stands at 311.

58
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,300
49 injured.

59
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,559
More than two dozen unaccounted for.

60
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,560
I'm so terribly sorry, Captain.

61
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,360
Do you have any idea who's responsible?

62
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,700
There was an incursion
by several of the gangs.

63
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,620
Any one of them could've done it.

64
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,500
Right now, it's impossible
to rule anyone out.

65
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,460
I'm working on getting you help.

66
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,740
You've been promising me help for weeks.

67
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,580
I have bodies lined up in the streets.

68
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,279
You have every right
to be upset, Captain.

69
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,080
- But I'm doing everything I can...
- Yeah.

70
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,980
... to make sure that you and your...

71
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,660
Let them through.

72
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,860
- There he is!
- Let them through!

73
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,300
Let them through. It's
okay. It's all right.

74
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,540
When are you gonna
find out who did this?

75
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,970
My family was in there.

76
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,620
How do we know we're safe here?

77
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,960
I know...

78
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,740
I know each one of you
lost someone you care for.

79
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,460
I share your grief.

80
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,880
I share your anger.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,750
But whoever destroyed that building

82
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,980
can't destroy the hope we've built.

83
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,960
Not unless we let them.

84
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,180
I swear,

85
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,280
I promise I won't stop until
I find those responsible.

86
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,240
Justice will be done.

87
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,680
How are you gonna stop
it from happening again?

88
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,550
It was a nice try.

89
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,260
Can you blame them? They're angry.

90
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,750
It's gonna take more than words.

91
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,360
Someone has to pay for this, soon.

92
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,020
Well, the department's not
exactly firing on all cylinders.

93
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,199
We got more men than bullets,

94
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,679
and we ain't got that many men.

95
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,400
Lucius, I need something.
Comb through every piece

96
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,480
of evidence you can find.

97
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,860
I need to know who did this, and how.

98
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,830
It's not gonna be easy. The size
of the crime scene alone...

99
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,080
Do whatever you have to
do. The clock is ticking.

100
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,280
More than you know.

101
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,659
When Barbara and I showed up,

102
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,609
that's when the building blew.

103
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,080
She vanished right after.

104
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,900
This doesn't make sense.
Not even for her.

105
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,239
Nothing makes sense anymore.

106
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,380
You're in charge, Harvey.

107
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,500
Selina!

108
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,140
Oh.

109
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,440
Hey.

110
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,860
I was afraid you didn't get my signal.

111
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,460
Lucius said the range was
only a couple miles.

112
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,579
Oh, you know me,

113
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,580
Master Bruce, I managed
to muddle through.

114
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,200
So go on, then. How did that happen?

115
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,980
I let my guard down.

116
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,700
You're telling me that
your captors shackle you,

117
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,940
they leave a radio transponder

118
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,940
in your pocket and... and your weapons?

119
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,480
Really?

120
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,680
I think you're telling porkies.

121
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,820
It was Selina.

122
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,080
She's gone after Jeremiah, alone.

123
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,160
You want to follow her, do you?

124
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,060
She's not herself, Alfred.
She's desperate for revenge.

125
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,100
She's gonna get herself hurt, or killed.

126
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,260
Seems to be a little bit
of a recurring theme

127
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,320
with madam, isn't it?

128
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,040
You know, one of these
days you're gonna realize

129
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,940
you can't save her from herself.

130
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,020
Until that day comes...

131
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,180
... I think we should go
and find her, don't you?

132
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,740
Let him in.

133
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,300
You're either here for information,

134
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,460
or you somehow think I
might've had something to do

135
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,580
with that atrocity.

136
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,360
Penguin murdered Tabitha.

137
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,500
You knew he was at Haven.

138
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,900
You would've done anything for revenge.

139
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,440
And I could've killed
him then and there.

140
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,580
So why didn't you?

141
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,260
Because the person who blew
up Haven has to be stopped.

142
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,760
That's all that matters now.

143
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,560
You're worried Sirens could be next.

144
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,730
I've been putting out feelers.

145
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,940
Is that what that was?

146
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,900
He heard people talking
about a shady guy

147
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,040
lurking around Haven before it blew.

148
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,900
This is Gotham. You're
gonna have to do better

149
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,260
than "shady guy."

150
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,040
How about a location?

151
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,850
A building in the northeast
corner of Harlow Park.

152
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,100
He says the guy's holed up there.

153
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,590
How much is this gonna cost me?

154
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,560
Just do your job.

155
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,280
Get the bastard.

156
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,620
Did you really think I could've
murdered all those people?

157
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,280
I don't know.

158
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,740
I guess I deserve that.

159
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,900
Jim.

160
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,740
Jim.

161
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,980
Jim, you read me?

162
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,320
Yeah.

163
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,140
We got a problem.

164
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,920
On my way.

165
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,940
Oswald?

166
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,740
What are you doing here?

167
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,630
Jim, it has become woefully apparent

168
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,380
that you are outmanned,

169
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,880
outgunned and out of options.

170
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,400
So I'm here to help.

171
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,080
That's generous of you.

172
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,340
I'm just getting started.

173
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,340
Well.

174
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,020
Ain't you just Saint Nick
on a Christmas morning?

175
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,680
Don't be shy. Go. Take
all you can carry.

176
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,680
I'm guessing there are strings attached?

177
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,920
No strings.

178
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,750
Save for the one that we will cinch

179
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,400
around the neck of the Haven bomber.

180
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,420
I lost people, too, Jim.

181
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,730
People you lured with promises
of safety and security,

182
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,560
only to have them incinerated.

183
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,740
But let's just hold that in
abeyance for the moment.

184
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,240
I would rather we put aside
our considerable differences,

185
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,660
and go get the people some justice.

186
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,820
What do you say, partner?

187
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,090
Apparently,

188
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,440
I've been on a trip,
or I'm going on one.

189
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,720
I've also left myself a message.

190
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,260
"In A-T number 1215 knows."

191
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,280
In... nate?

192
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,770
In... grate? Inflate?

193
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,600
In... mate?

194
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,760
"Inmate number 1215 knows."

195
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,480
Inmate number 1215 knows!

196
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,900
Knows what?!

197
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,180
Okay. Okay, think.

198
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,240
Prison records. Where do
I get prison records?

199
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,120
Right.

200
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,860
To hell with Penguin.

201
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,419
Haven wasn't your fault.

202
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,140
I told the people it was safe.

203
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,460
I made them into a target.

204
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,490
Jim, you gave 'em...

205
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,300
Don't tell me I gave 'em
hope. They're dead.

206
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,400
All right, fan out.

207
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,360
We go building to
building, door to door.

208
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,160
Our source said this is where
we'll find the bomber.

209
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,740
He's here somewhere.

210
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,920
Alvarez, take a squad, grab
the north side of the street.

211
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,230
The rest of you, cover the south.

212
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,520
To the vile miscreant

213
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,620
who murdered those innocent Havenites,

214
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,120
you have nowhere to run!

215
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,140
There goes the element of surprise.

216
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,900
We will root you out

217
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,820
like the vermin you are!

218
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,640
Two forces united in one purpose!

219
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,620
- Get back! Get back!
- Get down!

220
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,820
Elevated position, back to the sun.

221
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,840
Looks like we found our guy, huh?

222
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,440
- We're sitting ducks out here.
- And one Penguin.

223
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,980
Hey, Oswald, why don't
you crawl out there,

224
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,080
grab that bullhorn and tell
him to come down quietly?

225
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,159
Put your weapons down!

226
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,160
We have the building surrounded.

227
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,940
And we have more ammo than you!

228
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,560
Come out now with your hands in the air.

229
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,239
Pretty cozy up here.

230
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,720
Thanks, guys.

231
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,660
I know that voice.

232
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,819
Zsasz?

233
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,260
Oh, hey, guys. What's up?

234
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,100
Oh.

235
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,620
It's impolite to sneak up on people.

236
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,100
So is breaking and entering.

237
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,790
Heard you were dead, Ed.

238
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,340
Now what are you looking for?

239
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,520
I am given, and I am taken.

240
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,620
I was there from your first breath,

241
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,760
and I will follow you until your death.

242
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,860
A name.

243
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,260
So...

244
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,610
you're looking for the name
of a prisoner at Blackgate.

245
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,220
Call it a personal matter.

246
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,680
- This folder's quite valuable.
- Right.

247
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,140
What is the going rate on dust bunnies?

248
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,420
What I mean to say is,
this folder seems to be

249
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,520
quite valuable to you.

250
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,940
Well...

251
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,050
I'm guessing you don't want money,

252
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,000
because, uh, it's worthless.

253
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,400
I don't tend to carry snacks on me.

254
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,430
And if I had any bullets,

255
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,800
I would just shoot you
and take the folder.

256
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,580
So what is it that you would like?

257
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,720
Your expertise.

258
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,540
Surely you've noticed

259
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,460
the giant plume of smoke in the sky?

260
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,920
Someone blew up a building we
were using to house refugees.

261
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,510
We need to figure out how they did it,

262
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,750
so we can prevent them
from doing it again.

263
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,100
So, the second smartest man in Gotham...

264
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,640
needs my help.

265
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,720
Explosives are not my expertise.

266
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,960
Didn't realize you had one.

267
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,390
Hmm.

268
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,360
Just... Why?

269
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,940
Do we have a deal or not?

270
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,920
Fine.

271
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,580
I did not make that
building go boom, Jim.

272
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,360
Oh, please!

273
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,840
You gave up any shred of honor long ago!

274
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
Why should we believe a snake like you?!

275
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,120
Because I would never take
credit for somebody else's work.

276
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,600
Oh, no, you'd just betray
anyone and everyone

277
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,340
for the right price!

278
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,300
Is this about Sofia Falcone?

279
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,800
Because you should
really move past that.

280
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,840
It's not healthy.

281
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,240
Oswald, concentrate.

282
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,800
Do you and your men have enough ammo

283
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,020
to keep Zsasz pinned down
for a couple of minutes?

284
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,680
For you, Jim, let's
say... two and a half.

285
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,000
Concentrate all your fire
on that window up there.

286
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,860
Give me everything you got,
then abruptly cease fire.

287
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,660
You can count on me.

288
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,120
Spread the word.

289
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,610
All right, guys, gather around,

290
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,000
we got new orders.

291
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,480
All right.

292
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:29,640
Ready?

293
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,060
Yeah.

294
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,180
Now!

295
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,840
Fire!

296
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,140
Keep it coming!

297
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,140
Cease fire!

298
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,880
Cease fire!

299
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,560
Cease fire!

300
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,820
Glad to see you're still with us.

301
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,820
Thank you. Thank you. You were great.

302
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,040
Glad there's no hard feelings.

303
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,920
Day's not over yet. Come on.

304
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,480
Well done, Jim.

305
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,100
We make a hell of a team.

306
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,550
That man is a menace.

307
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,180
Allow me to deal with him.

308
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,640
This is about more than just
your vendetta against Zsasz.

309
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,020
If he did this, I need to know

310
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,980
if it was a part of something larger.

311
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,000
My point exactly.

312
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,200
One of the areas in which I excel

313
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,430
is the loosening of tongues.

314
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,460
No. He's mine.

315
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,220
You're pushing my men way too hard.

316
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,480
We're not gonna break through

317
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,550
for at least a couple more days.

318
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,660
There is absolutely no way
to make it on schedule.

319
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,040
Well, not with that
attitude, you're not.

320
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,920
Now...

321
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,710
everyone...

322
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,580
let's reach inside and dig...

323
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,320
a little deeper, shall we?

324
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,380
'Cause that's the only way

325
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,420
you're all making it out of this hole.

326
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,100
Come on, put this on.

327
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,280
Are these all the recruits?

328
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,590
Well, I thought you would want quality

329
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,790
over quantity.

330
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,520
Not everybody can pass a
.38 caliber test of faith.

331
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,660
Yes...

332
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:25,140
you certainly have set a very high bar

333
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,140
for devotion.

334
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,540
Oh. Almost forgot.

335
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,240
Bruce Wayne and his sidekick Curls...

336
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,780
Or is he the sidekick?

337
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,680
Anyway, they tried to infiltrate
our little operation here.

338
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,720
- Oh?
- Oh.

339
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,460
And Curls can walk, really well,

340
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,760
especially...

341
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,560
for a paraplegic.

342
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,660
Ah. And she wants to kill you.

343
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,080
A lot, FYI.

344
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,420
If I see her, I'll give you a shout.

345
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,940
Oh... and kill her.

346
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,640
Mm.

347
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,780
Okay, recruits,

348
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,660
let's do like my daddy did

349
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,380
before my sixth birthday and move out.

350
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,920
Ed?

351
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,160
The building's superstructure
is largely intact,

352
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,320
which would rule out C-4 and Semtex.

353
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,360
Evidence of deflagration
would suggest something

354
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,700
with a slower burn rate, like gunpowder

355
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,160
or nitroglycerin.

356
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,680
But for this level of destruction,

357
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,939
that would require a bomb that's...

358
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,880
20 cubic feet of explosive material.

359
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,459
There's no way you could
sneak something that size

360
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,720
into the building. All the
entrances were guarded,

361
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,640
which suggests maybe that
this was an inside job.

362
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,420
Or...

363
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,690
... a classic locked-room mystery.

364
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,359
Man walks into a room, alone,

365
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,980
and is later found murdered.

366
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,500
There are no windows, and one door,

367
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,340
which is locked from the inside.

368
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,730
The killer was already inside the room.

369
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,080
So, the bomb was already
inside the building?

370
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,600
No.

371
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,900
The bomb was the building.

372
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,500
You don't need to smuggle in explosives

373
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,840
when you can detonate 250 gallons

374
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,880
of highly pressurized heating oil

375
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,650
that's coursing through all the floors.

376
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,940
True, but that doesn't explain this.

377
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,020
Glass?

378
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,580
Presumably from there.

379
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,820
No, there's no way that that

380
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,900
would blast in with that explosion.

381
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,900
That would make all of that
glass go out onto the street.

382
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,400
Unless whatever ignited
those heating oil tanks...

383
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,060
Smashed through that window.

384
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,670
Ow.

385
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,570
This is a really nice table.

386
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,650
We got a dozen witnesses that saw you

387
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,120
walk out of that building
before it went kabooey.

388
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,850
Yeah. I heard some gangs had taken over.

389
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,980
Figured, with you guys occupied,

390
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,320
I might help myself to
some of your supplies.

391
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,240
Hey, do you guys have
any canned peaches?

392
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,390
Man, I'd trade an arm and
a leg for that right now.

393
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,480
Not mine, somebody else's.

394
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,380
If you're innocent, why shoot up

395
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,960
a city block full of cops?

396
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,920
Because it was full of cops,

397
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,219
who were also trying to shoot me.

398
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,040
And, guys, those were warning shots.

399
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,820
I mean, if I really
wanted to kill you...

400
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,260
you'd be dead. You got a pen?

401
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,460
I want to write this guy
a thank-you letter.

402
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,500
Do the math.

403
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,690
If I blew up a building full of people,

404
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,120
I would have covered
every inch of my body

405
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,520
in sweet, sweet scars.

406
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,999
You guys want to do a strip search?

407
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,800
Got Lucius on the horn for you, Cap.

408
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,530
Stay on him.

409
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,000
I'd let Alvarez do it.

410
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,520
He's handsome.

411
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,020
Lucius, talk to me.

412
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,810
Haven wasn't destroyed by a bomb.

413
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,440
It was an RPG, like the one
that took down the chopper.

414
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,720
You sure?

415
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,980
I'm holding what's left of
it in my hand right now.

416
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,500
We found pieces of it in the rubble.

417
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,420
It was fired through
the basement window,

418
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,220
detonated the fuel oil tank.

419
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,800
And we're still trying
to figure out exactly

420
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,460
which rooftop it was fired from.

421
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,260
- Rooftop?
- Yes.

422
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,860
The only angle you could hit
this tank from is above.

423
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
Our only suspect was on the ground.

424
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,540
Zsasz was seen leaving the building

425
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,120
moments before it blew.

426
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,220
Looks like you need a new suspect.

427
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,480
Jim!

428
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,440
Ah. I know the wheels of justice

429
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,680
turn slowly, so I'm here to provide

430
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,750
- a modicum of grease.
- Oswald,

431
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,700
you need to leave right now.

432
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,060
Still claiming he's innocent, is he?

433
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,700
Yes. And as much as I hate to admit it,

434
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,160
the evidence is backing him up.

435
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,320
What the hell's going on?

436
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,760
Harvey, according to Lucius,

437
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,660
Zsasz couldn't have done it.

438
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,240
I did not expect you to go soft, Jim.

439
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,140
Actually, I did.

440
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,280
Which is why I didn't come alone.

441
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,460
Bring me Victor Zsasz.

442
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,360
Torturing...

443
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,060
Torturing Zsasz into confessing
won't give the people justice.

444
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,730
As misguided as he is,

445
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,360
my old friend Jim is
correct in this instance.

446
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,460
Despite our enflamed passions,

447
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:59,500
we cannot rush to judgment.

448
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,060
- There will be a trial.
- Yeah!

449
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,720
And we will let the people decide.

450
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,280
Yeah!

451
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:11,300
Good to know who's really
in charge here, Jim.

452
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,880
This is it, the exact place

453
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,380
where the RPG was fired.

454
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,710
Impressive.

455
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,440
Calculated the angle of incident

456
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,140
to follow the trajectory
through the window,

457
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,649
into the fuel oil tanks.

458
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,320
Yep.

459
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,640
That, and the RPG case
is right over there.

460
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,660
So, now we know how it was done;

461
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,780
hopefully this holds
some clues as to who.

462
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,500
I should get this back to the lab.

463
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,810
Doubtful that someone who could pull off

464
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:13,160
such an intricate plot would
forget to wear gloves.

465
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,380
True, but it's all I've got to go on.

466
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,840
Well, maybe I'm wrong.

467
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,860
I hope so.

468
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,760
I truly hope that you
find whoever did this...

469
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,620
and you make them pay.

470
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,670
As promised.

471
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,420
I appreciate your help, Ed.

472
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,820
Couldn't have done it without you.

473
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,980
And if you tell anyone I
said that, I will deny it.

474
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:53,240
"Inmate number 1215. Frank McCann."

475
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,430
Frank McCann.

476
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,060
Deceased? No!

477
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,920
No! No, you can't be dead!

478
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,599
No!

479
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,000
Lucius! Hey!

480
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,620
Di... Did you see who
blew up this building?

481
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,850
Hey!

482
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,960
Deaf old bat.

483
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,580
Hopefully she's not blind, too.

484
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,240
There he is.

485
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,320
I got no love for Zsasz,

486
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,500
but are we really gonna let this happen?

487
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,140
Look at them, Harvey.

488
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,579
If we try to stop it,

489
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,580
they'll turn that anger against us.

490
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,700
- We've got to do something.
- Yeah?

491
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,620
Like what?

492
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,820
I make another speech?

493
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,920
Maybe this is what the people need.

494
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,930
Order in the court!

495
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:16,000
So, um, will I be appointed a lawyer?

496
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,580
I feel like my rights
are being violated.

497
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,740
Not your right to
remain silent. Bailiff.

498
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,360
No, no, no, no, no...

499
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:32,000
And where exactly did
you see the defendant

500
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,460
minutes before the explosion?

501
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,460
Coming out of the building.

502
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:40,240
The very building that
mere moments later

503
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,200
was engulfed in flames that would claim

504
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,540
so many beloved souls?

505
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,380
Are there any other witnesses

506
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,650
who can back up this man's claim? Oh.

507
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,880
- Here.
- Yep. Here.

508
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,350
Captain Gordon would
have this court believe

509
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,460
that all of you fine
citizens are mistaken.

510
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,580
He claims that Mr. Zsasz is not
responsible for the bombing.

511
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,100
Captain Gordon, if you would
like to say something,

512
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,500
now is the time.

513
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,420
Tell us something.

514
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,120
It wasn't a bomb.

515
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,640
It wasn't a bomb.

516
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,900
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

517
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:53,420
A rocket-propelled grenade,
fired from a rooftop.

518
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,480
If Zsasz was on the ground,
as your witnesses claim,

519
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,640
he couldn't have done it.

520
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,780
I know you all want justice.

521
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,520
So do I.

522
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,880
You're angry.

523
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,700
You're scared.

524
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,040
For months now, you've
been hearing me say

525
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,100
help is coming.

526
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:26,140
Truth is, we may be on our own.

527
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,420
And if that's true,

528
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,380
what we do now is more
important than ever.

529
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,440
This...

530
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,560
This is not justice.

531
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,620
This is not justice.

532
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,740
It's not who we are.

533
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,100
I'll consider that

534
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,780
your closing argument.

535
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,040
Now that the defense has rested,

536
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,480
let's put it to the crowd.

537
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:10,040
What say you, jury?

538
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,920
Guilty!

539
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:23,500
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

540
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,720
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

541
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,560
By the power vested in me

542
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,840
by... well, me,

543
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,840
I sentence you, Victor Zsasz,

544
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,730
to die.

545
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,660
Any last words?

546
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,460
Well said.

547
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,800
Get him out of there.

548
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,600
Overruled!

549
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,300
What the hell are you doing?!

550
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,720
Trying to keep you all from
making a terrible mistake.

551
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,860
See?

552
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:41,000
Jim Gordon cares more about
protecting a murderer

553
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,620
than he does about protecting you!

554
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,620
You've lost them, Jim.

555
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,720
They don't believe in you anymore.

556
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,580
They're mine now.

557
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,760
I got to be honest, Jim,

558
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:11,200
I don't know how safe Zsasz
will be at the GCPD.

559
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,700
There's more than a few cops
that want to see him on a slab.

560
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,560
That's why we're not taking him there.

561
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,579
Wait.

562
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,620
Tell me this is not a catch and release.

563
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,580
What choice do I have?
Either I let him go,

564
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,940
or he's dead for something he didn't do.

565
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,620
Thank you, Jim.

566
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,990
I'm not doing this for you.

567
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,459
Of course not.

568
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,660
This city will never be what
you want it to be, Jim.

569
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:48,100
It's always gonna belong
to the bad guys, like me.

570
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,360
Give him your gun, Harvey.

571
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,840
What?

572
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,440
Yeah. What?

573
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,880
Give him your gun.

574
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,760
Jim.

575
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,919
Do it!

576
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,240
You got a death wish, Jim?

577
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,020
'Cause I'll kill you.

578
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,990
Harvey, too.

579
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,580
Maybe.

580
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,840
Maybe I'm just tired of
listening to you, Victor.

581
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,000
Do it.

582
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,200
You know what? You seem tired.

583
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,110
Maybe we should do this

584
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,960
another day, yeah?

585
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,180
People like you are always
trying to own this city.

586
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,460
But you never will.

587
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:50,220
Now get the hell out of my face.

588
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,660
See you around, Jim.

589
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,900
A shoot-out?

590
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,360
- Are you serious?
- What? I could've taken him.

591
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,910
That's not the point. Never...

592
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,060
ever ask me to do
anything like that again.

593
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,740
Pull yourself together.

594
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,519
You see,

595
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,920
a river cuts through rock
not because of its power,

596
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,720
but because of its persistence.

597
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,180
So what do we do when
we feel like giving up?

598
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,840
Dig a little deeper.

599
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:08,400
And what do we do when we can't
possibly go on any longer?

600
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,540
Dig a little deeper.

601
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,480
And what do we...

602
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,320
Deep enough?

603
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,610
Well, Selina,

604
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,220
I must say...

605
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:36,850
Don't say anything.

606
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,560
Selina!

607
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,720
- Selina!
- Let me go!

608
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,740
It's done! It's over.

609
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,480
Jeremiah!

610
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,680
We need to get out of here, now.

611
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,600
I hate stairs.

612
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,860
Oh, God.

613
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,700
Oh, no! Go away!

614
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,780
No... hey, wait. I need
to know what you know.

615
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,590
Oh, please. Oh, oh,
please don't hurt me.

616
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,520
Listen, lady, I'm not gonna hurt you.

617
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,380
I just want to know what you saw.

618
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,740
Uh, uh, the-the roof.

619
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,670
You, you were on the roof.

620
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:08,360
And you had some kind of a, uh,

621
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,540
you had some kind of a, of a rocket.

622
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,680
Mm.

623
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,440
That's, that's not possible.

624
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:19,720
Uh, and-and you shot it
at-at-at that building.

625
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,590
Oh!

626
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,000
Oh!

627
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:59,740
_

628
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,380
Oh, I'm sorry.

629
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,240
I promise,

630
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:10,660
I won't tell anybody.

631
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:13,020
I know you won't.

632
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,910
You said you wouldn't hurt me.

633
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,910
I'm really very sorry.

634
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,859
Oh, no! Oh, no!

635
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,460
Spotlight's off.

636
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:53,000
You forget to pay the electric bill?

637
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,580
What do you want, Barbara?

638
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,240
Same as you.

639
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,300
To protect my people.

640
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,160
Your tip didn't pan out.

641
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:06,260
Well, I've got another one.

642
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,340
A lead on a guy selling RPGs.

643
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,000
He moves about, but...

644
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,400
That all?

645
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,860
I heard some of your people
went over to Penguin.

646
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,840
Yeah.

647
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,760
Well, you can't win them all.

648
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,920
Poor Jim.

649
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,000
All alone again.

650
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,320
Get out of here, Barbara.

651
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,730
No one knows what it's like to be him.

652
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,780
To carry the weight.

653
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,680
I told you to leave.

654
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,380
I heard you.

655
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:26,240
