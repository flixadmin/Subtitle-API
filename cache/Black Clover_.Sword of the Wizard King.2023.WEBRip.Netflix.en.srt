1
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:28,963
Tell me!

2
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,133
Why are you standing in my way, Julius?

3
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,720
'Cause the calamity you’re attempting
to bring about is unjust, Conrad.

4
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,680
Can’t you see that?

5
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:42,727
You need to give up. You don’t have
enough magic left in you to resist us.

6
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,354
You’re the one who’s wrong.

7
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,817
I still have plenty of power!

8
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,385
Pow!

9
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:26,563
It can’t be!

10
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,649
The Sword, Elsdocia!

11
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,663
He chose
to throw his life away for this?

12
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,464
My duty is to herald a new world.

13
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,970
A society where people respect each other.

14
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:02,223
Where they can laugh together as equals.

15
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,975
Why would you oppose this?

16
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,478
How can you justify
getting in the way of my noble dream

17
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,479
for our world?

18
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,195
Really?

19
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,470
Mmm.

20
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,931
I'm afraid the future's something
you won't see!

21
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,238
You're a fool, Julius.

22
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,615
You know this nation must change.

23
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,326
Besides, if you seal me away,

24
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,371
you won't have access
to the Imperial Sword anymore!

25
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,124
You’re right.
It pains me to lose such a treasure.

26
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,417
Truth is,

27
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:15,171
we no longer possess enough power
to wrest it away from your hand.

28
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,174
I take full responsibility for this

29
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,510
as the next Wizard King!

30
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,600
This isn’t over!

31
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,560
I will bring about a new world!

32
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,855
My magic is 'never giving up'!

33
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:31,873
BLACK CLOVER: SWORD OF THE WIZARD KING

34
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,551
CLOVER KINGDOM

35
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,672
It's my pleasure
to welcome you to The Triumph.

36
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:25,218
A grand festival of magic battles
that takes place every ten years.

37
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,556
I hope you’re prepared for a show
because this tournament

38
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,353
will decide the strongest Magic Knight
out of the many competitors here today.

39
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,815
It's long been said that the mage
who claims victory here today,

40
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,110
will eventually be chosen
as the next Wizard King!

41
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,363
For those of you who may be unaware,

42
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,116
the Magic Knights comprise
nine elite squads of mages

43
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,617
who specialize in battle.

44
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,078
The Wizard King
sits at the top of the ranks,

45
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,913
overseeing their duties.

46
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,249
Together they protect
the peace and happiness

47
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,752
we're lucky enough to enjoy
in the Clover Kingdom every day!

48
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,631
Soon we’ll determine who the strongest
member of the Magic Knights is.

49
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:07,093
Whatever happens, we're certain to be in
for a memorable time!

50
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,220
Thank you for waiting so patiently.

51
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,805
Here we go!

52
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:17,270
The Triumph starts now! Hurray!

53
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,783
-Hmm. By the way, Klaus…
-Mm-hmm?

54
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,328
I was wondering if you knew why
we were chosen as masters of ceremony?

55
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,582
Uh! 'Cause we're members
of the strongest Magic Knights Squad,

56
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,041
the Golden Dawn, naturally!

57
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,462
And turn off
your Amplification Magic before sidebar--

58
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,338
It totally slipped my mind!

59
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,298
Oh well!

60
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:48,551
Pardon the belated introductions!
I’m Mimosa Vermillion,

61
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,803
and I’ll be commentating alongside Klaus.

62
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,390
Introductions now?!
We should have done that at the beginning!

63
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,310
Who in their right mind
would choose Mimosa for this job?

64
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,437
Man, look at all these people!

65
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,814
The stands are packed!

66
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,901
Mmm… Yes, of course, they're full.
He's first.

67
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,119
We love Yuno!

68
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:22,460
The-- The first mage in the arena
is the vice captain of the Golden Dawn.

69
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,213
Please welcome Yuno!

70
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:30,051
Woo-hoo! Hooray!
Go, go, Yuno! Steal the show…

71
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:33,387
The first round
features everyone's favorite Pretty Boy.

72
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,974
People came from all over
to watch him fight. See?

73
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:40,937
My only interest is in seeing
my dearest little sister, Marie.

74
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,564
Exactly what I’d expect from you, Gauche.

75
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,067
Ah, jeez,
I can’t wait to get in there and brawl.

76
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,152
I just wish Asta was here to join us.

77
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:52,406
Yeah, too bad. He’s still in exile,
thanks to the judgment at the devil trial.

78
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,410
Man, what a bummer! Let's hope
the rest of the roster's interesting.

79
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,497
Look, someone’s coming!

80
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,666
Where?

81
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,460
-Wait a second.
-Who the hell is that?

82
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,796
-Is that…?
-Hmm?

83
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,216
Yuno’s initial opponent is, uh…

84
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,719
-Hmm.
-“The Masked One”?

85
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,640
Surely nobody entered the tournament
with such a ridiculous name?

86
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,308
-Oh, they did!
-Take off the mask!

87
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,435
Are you kidding me
with this getup?

88
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,313
You dressed like this
to make fun of Yuno, didn’t you?!

89
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:25,690
Hmm.

90
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,317
The Triumph
will now officially commence.

91
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,654
Our first round
is Yuno versus The Masked One.

92
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,697
You may begin!

93
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,253
Wow!

94
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,842
Hey, Asta. Nice counter.

95
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,223
The first move
in the tournament came from Yuno!

96
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,808
He used strong Wind Magic.

97
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,394
But The Masked One
countered with a big sword,

98
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,479
which completely neutralized the attack!

99
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,940
It appears they started without us.

100
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,917
The time has come, Julius.

101
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,628
Shall we join them?

102
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,004
Oh yeah!

103
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,174
Barrier Magic: Voodoo Shangri-la!

104
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,561
I’m sensing enormous magical power.

105
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,023
You’ve no idea
how long I’ve waited for this day to come.

106
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,858
Change is finally at hand.

107
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,944
I will fix this country!

108
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:20,888
I’m surprised to find you
looking so feeble in your old age, Julius.

109
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,140
I only absorbed
the tiniest amount of magic,

110
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,434
yet it’s taken this great a toll on you?

111
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,772
I thought I wouldn’t see you again.
What a shame.

112
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,857
Must have been then.

113
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,528
Yes! I hope you don’t mind
that I broke your seal.

114
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,949
You were distracted for just a moment.
But that moment was all I needed.

115
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,952
You're going to try again.

116
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,454
My ambitions have not changed
in the slightest

117
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,415
since we last faced each other here.

118
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,418
Today I will create the ideal world.

119
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,045
Where citizens have respect
for one another.

120
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,548
A nation built on joy and laughter.

121
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,258
And I brought help.

122
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:01,095
Come forth, my soldiers.
Time for domination.

123
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,473
Tomorrow this corrupt country
will be no more!

124
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,893
Legion Magic: Gehenna Game.

125
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,540
Conrad, stop this! Just--

126
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,313
You gonna be good, old man?

127
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,274
Oh, thanks! I-- I’ll be fine.

128
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:00,529
Hmm.

129
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,864
Quickly! Exit this way!

130
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,658
Steel Magic: Fierce Spiral Lance!

131
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,748
Klaus! Leave this to me.

132
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,226
What the heck?
Why is everyone targeting me?

133
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:35,731
Yuno!

134
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,693
Ugh, these guys are the worst!
They ruined my awesome disguise!

135
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:43,405
And here I thought you were a lost child
who wandered onto the field.

136
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,990
What did you call me?!

137
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,244
Water Creation Magic:
Sea Dragon's Roar!

138
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:53,374
You dummy. You could've told me
you were going to be participating.

139
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,500
Noelle!

140
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,418
You probably can’t feel it,

141
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,880
but I think something is absorbing
magical power from everyone here.

142
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,842
Those with not much to begin with,
can’t even move now!

143
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,719
Wait, really? That’s bad. Are you okay?

144
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,097
Of course. I’m a royal. I'm fine.

145
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,349
I have more than enough to spare, moron.

146
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,017
Right. Got it.

147
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,104
Guess I’ll have to work harder
to make up for everybody else.

148
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:19,191
Make sure you don’t get too carried away.
And don’t worry, I’ve got your back.

149
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,902
Just keep focusing
on what’s in front of you.

150
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,904
Great. Then let’s do this!

151
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,767
Is this some kind of a trick?

152
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,395
Those three?
How could they possibly be here?

153
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,481
Given your title, you must recognize them.

154
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,901
Three Wizard Kings
stripped of their titles.

155
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,653
Maligned because of their cruelty
and severe natures.

156
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,823
Hey, you floating guys! Did you do this?

157
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,784
Such an insolent boy. How is he moving?

158
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:11,952
Good question.

159
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,456
From what I can tell, he didn't have
any magical power to begin with.

160
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,208
Fighting without any juice?
Buzz off.

161
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,502
There’s no way
that my soldiers were defeated

162
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,422
by a peon
with no magical power to speak of.

163
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,215
Something strange is going on.

164
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,760
It was a fairly simple task
to revive them,

165
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:32,014
given my magic combined
with the power of the Imperial Sword.

166
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,727
You doubted me,

167
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,230
but these three are loyal supporters
of my cause.

168
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,360
And together we will forge a new reality.

169
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,988
You heard the man.
Now let’s get you out of the way!

170
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,158
Oh, shut up!
I don’t know what you’re up to,

171
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,786
but it’s pretty obvious
that you’re the bad guys!

172
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,329
I’m gonna take you down!

173
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,289
My, aren’t you a lively one?

174
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,834
Barrier Magic: Voodoo Regalia!

175
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,342
He destroyed my magic?

176
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,388
Hey, Conrad!

177
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,224
I found a fun new toy
you might find amusing.

178
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,643
Why don’t you take a turn with him, hmm?

179
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,144
Hmm.

180
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,479
Hmm?

181
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,901
Wizard King! Have you been hurt?

182
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,237
No, Marx, stay back! Get out of here!

183
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,825
Well, well.
That’s interesting magic.

184
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,620
How rude! No acknowledgement?

185
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,831
I suppose that means
I get to take my time.

186
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,250
Stop playing around with your prey.

187
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,836
Have the decency
to finish him off quickly.

188
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,337
Hey! My toy!

189
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,803
-Asta!
-Yeah!

190
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,722
Ah yeah! Thanks, guys!

191
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:06,108
Wow! That’s some beautiful magic
you’re working with.

192
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,362
It’s hopeless.
They can’t defeat Wizard Kings.

193
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,573
No matter how many stand against us.

194
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,701
Besides, these are your Magic Knights?

195
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,120
A peasant child with no magic?

196
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,498
How far this country has fallen
under your watch.

197
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,084
You underestimate them.

198
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,919
Come again?

199
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,131
You may think we’re trash,
but none of us is weak.

200
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,176
Not me or my Magic Knights.

201
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,890
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked
Lightless Blade Storm!

202
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,488
-Hmm!
-Yeah!

203
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,447
Huh!

204
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,910
Sorry we’re late!

205
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,829
But now some mighty mages
have arrived to save the day!

206
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,249
Wait, wait!
What is this sinister magical power?!

207
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:08,629
This may turn
into my best masterpiece yet!

208
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:12,883
I’ll take you on and turn you to ash
with the flames of justice!

209
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,012
No, that silhouette. It can’t be.

210
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,015
Hello, Kaiser.

211
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,392
It’s been a long time.

212
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,270
-Captain Yami!
-My bad.

213
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,982
I’m late 'cause I was takin’ a dump.
Couldn't get off the pot sooner.

214
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,442
So, who are these guys?

215
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:34,071
Not totally sure.
But I do know they’re super bad.

216
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,448
And strong.
Things aren’t looking good for us!

217
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,784
"Super bad"?
That’s how you describe a threat?

218
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,953
In this case, he isn't wrong.

219
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,872
I don’t see a way
to defeat them with our current forces.

220
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,166
There is one option though.

221
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,835
Please.

222
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:51,713
Head to Magic Tool Research Lab,
Branch Zero right away, Yami.

223
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,634
I need you to bring back the special tool
we’ve been co-developing with Nero.

224
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,053
-Uh, pass.
-"Pass"?

225
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,264
I go and you’re screwed.

226
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,016
You need me.
Someone’s gotta watch your back.

227
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,770
And I've got zero interest
in reliving my past failures.

228
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,189
Uh-- Yami…

229
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,359
Look, if you need an errand boy,
just send this dope.

230
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,194
-Kid? You're on.
-Me?

231
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,239
Finral, you heard your king.

232
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,949
Join him. Go to Branch Zero.

233
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,159
Sir! Right away.

234
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,536
Hey, wait! I should be helping out here!

235
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,495
Uh!

236
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,583
So this is where you were hiding?

237
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,710
I'd suggest you stay put.

238
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,129
Otherwise, I can't guarantee
a swift death.

239
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,517
Well.

240
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,562
Stop your stalling,
and get the hell outta here!

241
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,772
You better make it snappy, all right, kid?

242
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,025
-Or I'll kill them without you!
-Sir!

243
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,697
Captain Yami!

244
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,616
Asta, quick. Go through!

245
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:04,286
I can’t maintain Spatial Magic for long
because of that barrier!

246
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,372
You’re a member
of the Black Bulls, aren’t you?

247
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,166
Then follow your captain’s orders!

248
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,667
Thanks, Noelle.

249
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,294
Whaddaya know?

250
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,255
I didn't expect
to see fancy magic like this today.

251
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,133
Well, I’ll have to analyze it later.

252
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,718
Oh my!

253
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,848
Vouivre's Roar!

254
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,940
Okay, not too shabby.
You've got my attention.

255
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,527
Dark Magic:
Dark Cloaked Black Blade!

256
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:41,240
Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

257
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,250
Their defenses
keep getting tougher and tougher.

258
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,752
The kids have greatly improved though.

259
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,463
Maybe. They've still got plenty to learn.

260
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:00,550
It’ll be awhile before they can
hold their own without holding me back.

261
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,474
My apologies
for not being able to contain them.

262
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,018
Please. You’re doing the best you can.

263
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,021
Thanks to you, I had time
to send my guys out on an errand.

264
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,275
You’re wasting energy
trying to oppose me.

265
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,860
When the Imperial Sword’s magic
is activated,

266
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,862
the Clover Kingdom will be gone.

267
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:24,283
Haven’t you had
any better ideas in the last ten years?

268
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:28,287
So the Imperial Sword? That's the one
that can absorb magic power.

269
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,123
Stores it 'til the wielder’s
ready to release it, right?

270
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,501
Is it really possible
to destroy a country with it?

271
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:39,131
Certainly. If he unleashes
all the stored-up magic at once.

272
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,635
He’s already collected power
from every person who was at this stadium.

273
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,637
The blade must be humming with it.

274
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,806
And with his magic,

275
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:51,560
he can misuse the sword's ability
to no end, bringing ruin to our kingdom.

276
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,270
"Misuse"?

277
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,772
I'm using the sword
to save this broken world.

278
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,900
I'd say it's the perfect use, myself.

279
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,244
I'm here now, Wizard King.

280
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,331
We successfully evacuated
everyone in the audience.

281
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,916
Now we can safely defeat them.

282
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,421
Fuegoleon and Nozel.
I do hope you’ve gotten stronger.

283
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,591
I never expected
I’d be in a situation

284
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,052
where I’d have to fight
this monster again.

285
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,430
Ah, I almost forgot
how Nozel got so spooked the last time

286
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,432
that he cried and crapped his pants.

287
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,642
Another word
and I’ll drown you in mercury.

288
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:36,188
So who're the friends
he brought along this time? They’re new.

289
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:39,441
The woman is capable
of producing magic soldiers.

290
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,277
My grandfather’s journal
spoke of this power.

291
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,530
I remember it well because my sister
found it captivating.

292
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,784
-Not good.
-They’re figures from the past.

293
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,202
Leaders who died long ago.

294
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:54,706
Wait. You're tellin' me some actual
Wizard Kings have come back to life?!

295
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,419
In that case, I bet I could make a killing
selling their autographs.

296
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,089
Former Wizard Kings
have been revived?!

297
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,425
I’m awake for a change,
but this feels like a dream.

298
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,843
It’s way too crazy!

299
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:10,430
This is filling
my brush with inspiration.

300
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,266
Then again, maybe now’s not the time
to be painting.

301
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:21,066
You’ve managed to gather
a formidable force, but this ends here.

302
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:34,621
There are countless points
across the land where veins of mana

303
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,998
intersect and interact with each other.

304
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,334
This location happens to be one of them.

305
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,129
Ten years ago, I altered the arena

306
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:45,257
and turned it into a weapon
of my own design.

307
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,301
But you people interrupted me
before I could activate it.

308
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,214
Festival Stadium.

309
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:30,552
Also known as Triumph, my flying fortress.

310
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,015
There’s no way for you to escape now.

311
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:40,228
Julius, it’s time I make up for the years
you stole when you sealed me away.

312
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,738
We made it.
Welcome to Branch Zero.

313
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,825
Hey!

314
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,119
What's up?
This is Asta from the Black Bulls!

315
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,579
The Wizard King sent me!

316
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,165
-Let's get these doors open!
-It’s not gonna work.

317
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,292
This lab is a well-kept secret.

318
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,295
Only a handful of nobles
even know it exists.

319
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,049
To enter, you have to spell out
a secret password with your magical power.

320
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,387
And you are?

321
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,557
Ah, you must be the Black Bulls.

322
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:22,479
I'm branch coordinator Millie Maxwell.
It’s a pleasure to meet you.

323
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:23,772
Come. This way.

324
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,399
-Right!
-We've been briefed.

325
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,901
It's quite the situation.

326
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,904
I'm going to let
someone else take it from here.

327
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,574
She’ll be happy
to show you around.

328
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,534
Nero!

329
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,579
The magic tool Julius needs
is down below.

330
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,582
Stored in the depths
of this facility for safe keeping.

331
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,834
Sally is making some adjustments to it.

332
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,546
This could be my greatest experiment!

333
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,298
So Sally's here too.

334
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,969
Nero, you’ve been observing
the Clover Kingdom for centuries, right?

335
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,179
At least 500 years if I'm not mistaken.

336
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,809
So does that mean you recognize
the people who attacked the stadium?

337
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,438
I don’t know the details,
but I can confirm a few things for you.

338
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,900
-The mastermind is Conrad Leto.
-Huh?

339
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,653
I assume
you’ve at least heard his name before.

340
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,488
Conrad was the--

341
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,448
-Wait, you don’t mean…
-Uh-huh.

342
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:18,868
Yes.

343
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,122
He was once a Magic Knight
of the Clover Kingdom.

344
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,750
And Julius Novachrono’s predecessor.

345
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,253
The previous Wizard King.

346
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,297
Hold on.

347
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,426
Didn't that guy get sick?
He's been dead for almost ten years.

348
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,887
I’ll explain what I can. Get on.

349
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:43,602
Conrad Leto was the 27th Wizard King.

350
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,104
Even before he was chosen for this role,

351
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:49,357
he was known as one of
the most powerful men in the kingdom.

352
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,235
He quickly became
a captain in the Magic Knights.

353
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:56,990
And, as you might expect,
his squad was praised for their successes.

354
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,701
The citizens of the land trusted him.

355
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,412
And given his abilities
and the respect he garnered,

356
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,873
it was no surprise
he was named the Wizard King.

357
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:09,085
However, something changed inside him.

358
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:14,382
He rebelled against the kingdom and,
as a result, was stripped of his title.

359
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,093
What do you mean, "he rebelled"?

360
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,222
He tried to destroy the nation.

361
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:25,018
No way! The Wizard King’s job
is to protect peace!

362
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,979
Why would he try
to do something so terrible?

363
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,606
I have no idea.

364
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,483
What we do know is this.

365
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,611
His plan relied
on the Imperial Sword, Elsdocia.

366
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:38,907
A magic item that belonged
to Lord Lumiere, the first Wizard King.

367
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,451
When Julius and the others
learned of this plot,

368
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,286
they stopped Conrad by sealing him.

369
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,121
Intense.

370
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,624
They then announced
that he died of an illness,

371
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,125
so the kingdom wouldn't panic.

372
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,170
Keep in mind
that Julius couldn't defeat him,

373
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:55,173
even with the help
of the most elite Magic Knights.

374
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:59,344
As such, he had no choice
but to use his Time Magic on Conrad

375
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:02,972
to keep him locked away and out of sight
so he couldn’t harm anybody.

376
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:06,768
I get it, he's incredibly strong.
What magic does he use?

377
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,144
Key Magic.

378
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,355
It grants him the ability to create keys

379
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:13,274
that can open or close rifts
out of thin air.

380
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:18,571
The magic space behind these doors
is able to absorb whatever Conrad wishes.

381
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,907
Tools, grimoires…

382
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:22,659
Magic itself.

383
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,660
Seriously?

384
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,787
Wait, wait. You mean…

385
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,913
Correct.

386
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,041
He has the ability
to steal a person’s magic.

387
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,795
And after, he can use it
however he pleases.

388
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,842
Sealing Magic: Release!

389
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:55,442
So how far down are we going?

390
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,901
Their security is extreme.

391
00:28:56,985 --> 00:29:00,405
Yes. Patience. We're almost there.

392
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,713
This is the innermost part
of Branch Zero.

393
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,548
Here we store and research

394
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,509
the most important
magic tools in our catalog.

395
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,180
I get the feeling we were asked
to bring back something pretty rare, huh?

396
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,892
Indeed. It's something
Prince Lumiere was developing

397
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:31,478
to control the power
of the Imperial Sword.

398
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,564
You could think of it
as a sheath for Elsdocia.

399
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:38,818
It’s still a prototype, but with any luck,
we can use it to seal Conrad again.

400
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,118
He's here?

401
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,080
When I heard you were
after something Lumiere worked on,

402
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,582
my interest was piqued.

403
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,293
But this is a useless trinket.

404
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,755
-No, don't!
-Sally!

405
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,383
Demon Slayer!

406
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,431
-No!
-Oh?

407
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,146
Finral?!

408
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,151
I know you.

409
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,532
How did you find us?

410
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,326
Secré Swallowtail.

411
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:31,037
Yet another Mage
from the Black Bulls Squad.

412
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:37,418
Your fellow members are Asta,
Noelle Silva, and Finral Roulacase.

413
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:43,424
Memory Exchange Magic makes it easy
to see what other people have experienced.

414
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,594
Invading a person's privacy
is a bit distasteful,

415
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,013
but it allowed me to locate this place.

416
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,765
Marx’s magic!

417
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,017
Shall I show you
what's happening?

418
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,981
Citizens of the Clover Kingdom,

419
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,732
surrender immediately,

420
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:04,320
and offer your magical power as a tribute.
Resistance is futile.

421
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,822
My Legion Magic soldiers

422
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:10,076
will keep on fighting
until their last bit of energy is spent!

423
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,621
One of the former
Wizard Kings, Princia.

424
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,667
The Imperial Sword is supplying her
with the magical power it has stored

425
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,711
meaning she essentially has no limits.

426
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,047
The Magic Knights
have been completely wiped out.

427
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:27,260
And we’ve taken control of every citizen
and strategic facility in the kingdom.

428
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,012
It can't be.

429
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,930
Impressive, no?

430
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,141
So many. So fast.

431
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:37,562
Don't imagine that you're being invaded
by a paltry swarm of magic soldiers.

432
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:41,399
Princia can summon armies comparable
to those of even the strongest nations.

433
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,903
As for those powerful mages
who helped you escape…

434
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,780
Captain Yami!

435
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:55,121
They're resting now, fast asleep.
They’ll resist no more.

436
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,707
All those people at the stadium.

437
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,043
Nozel. Brother?

438
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:03,338
That's right.
You're the youngest Silva daughter.

439
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,381
Progeny of Acier Silva,

440
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,717
the renowned Steel War Princess.

441
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,970
What a pathetic turn of events
for your brother to fall

442
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,764
before his little sister.

443
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,849
To think that such a coward

444
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,352
was allowed to be a captain
of the Magic Knights!

445
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,730
Sea Dragon’s Roar!

446
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,241
Noelle! Dammit, I'm coming!

447
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,411
You’ve much yet to learn,

448
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,747
but the purity
of your magic is impressive.

449
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,123
I believe I’ll take it.

450
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,174
Hmm. The profound difference
in our abilities

451
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:50,426
makes this such an easy task.

452
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,224
I can feel my magic flowing out.

453
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,857
Bastard. What did you do to her?

454
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,485
Perhaps it's better to show you.

455
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:11,406
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

456
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,582
It's true, he stole Noelle's magic.

457
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,835
Give it back!

458
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,934
You're gonna wish you'd stayed sealed!

459
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,438
Fascinating. So this is Anti-Magic
in action, is it?

460
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,319
Hmm.

461
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,659
Uh!

462
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,150
Demon Destroyer!

463
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,363
What a wonderful power you possess!

464
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,949
It can nullify not only magic

465
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,369
but also any phenomena
that is derived from magic.

466
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,830
I’d like to take this ability as well,

467
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,416
but perhaps I’ll refrain
for the time being.

468
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,003
I wouldn’t want it
to affect anything I have stored.

469
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,630
Let’s have a little chat.

470
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:53,216
After all, you and I
are walking a similar path.

471
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:56,427
You really are nuts.
I am nothing like you!

472
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,264
The Imperial Sword, Elsdocia
is a magic tool

473
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,392
that was developed
by Lumiere a long time ago.

474
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:06,938
It happens to be perfectly compatible
with my Key Magic.

475
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,024
The sword was created
to preserve exceptional magic

476
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:14,362
of great mages and heroes
as a legacy for future generations.

477
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,823
You see, it has not only
the power and wisdom

478
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:21,452
of every Wizard King stored inside it
but a piece of their souls as well.

479
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,412
Are you starting to understand?

480
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:26,040
This weapon can absorb,
stockpile, and unleash

481
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,627
an absurd amount
of magical power all at once.

482
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,172
With it, I will combine
the generations of Wizard Kings' magic

483
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:39,262
with the various types of magic I stole
and create a Gargantuan Compound Magic!

484
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,013
Once that power is in my hands,

485
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:45,059
I'll drive it into one of the mana veins
pulsing throughout this land.

486
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,645
Disaster will be magnificent!

487
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,189
The foundation of the continent
will be destroyed,

488
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,859
and every single citizen will perish.

489
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,236
But don't you worry yourself,

490
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,739
the Imperial Sword
can also store the souls of the departed.

491
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,366
I will select the worthy

492
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:05,204
and bring back only those who deserve
to inherit the world that I have created!

493
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,915
I know people loathed me
because of my magic,

494
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,959
I’ve seen it in their memories.

495
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:12,712
Trust me when I say
I know what you must feel.

496
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,965
Those with magical power
own everything in this society,

497
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:18,843
and those without it die in the squalor.

498
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,429
Isn’t this world unbearable, Asta?

499
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,223
Shouldn’t we destroy it and start anew?

500
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,685
Join me, and we’ll shape
a new reality together.

501
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:30,479
One where people have esteem
for their fellow man.

502
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,732
Where they can't help but smile.

503
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:37,612
Everyone should respect each other
and get along great and laugh together.

504
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,823
One day, when I become the Wizard King,
I’ll create that world.

505
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,200
Shut up!

506
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,952
That's bullshit!

507
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,163
The Wizard King
is supposed to protect his people!

508
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:50,458
To make sure
everyone in the nation is safe and happy.

509
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,127
I will not let you destroy this world!

510
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,463
It’s not something
a real king would ever do!

511
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,757
You cannot stop me.

512
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,469
The dregs of this society
are forced to lead lives devoid of worth.

513
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,595
You’ve seen it.

514
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,306
But I can give meaning to their existence.

515
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,183
Why can't you see that?

516
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,437
Every single thing you've said is crazy.

517
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,940
I don't understand any of it at all!

518
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,027
You don't realize
how broken this civilization is.

519
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,528
What a pity.

520
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:24,867
I said, "Shut up!"
How can anyone be so selfish?

521
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,130
Why can’t you understand?!

522
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,135
I know the things you’ve experienced.

523
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:47,223
The inequality. The betrayal.
The country is against you.

524
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,188
You must choose, Asta.

525
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,315
You can walk this path with me…

526
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,777
…or disappear forever.

527
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,050
Give up this fight already.

528
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:27,513
We are alike.
Accept that, and stand at my side.

529
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,350
The fusion of magic
will be completed by dawn tomorrow.

530
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,770
That’s your deadline. Your last chance.

531
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:39,483
You have to give Noelle

532
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,028
her magic back

533
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,157
That’s your concern?

534
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,160
Know that
I will truly regret your death.

535
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,455
I'll fight.

536
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,166
I will not back down.

537
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,461
That's because my magic is

538
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,672
'never giving up.'

539
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,433
That’s the last of my power.

540
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,518
Uh… Hm. What now?

541
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:17,438
We’re not done. We'll try whatever we can.

542
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,910
Yuno? When'd you get here?

543
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,912
And Millie too?

544
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:36,332
He made it very clear that
he wouldn’t leave until he’d helped you.

545
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:39,293
-Drink up, Sally.
-Okay!

546
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:44,173
There's no plan.
We’ll just have to play this one by ear.

547
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:47,176
That sounds like a fun time!
Like we’re experimenting.

548
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,636
No. Not fun.

549
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,639
I truly loathe improvisation.

550
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,707
Yu… no.

551
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:26,382
Never thought I’d be using this
in such a way, but here we are.

552
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:30,261
Come on, quickly! Let’s try to activate it
with the magic we have!

553
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,637
This will not work.

554
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,888
Maybe not,

555
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,850
but thanks to their help,
we have a chance!

556
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,770
Sealing Magic: Eternal Prison!

557
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,571
He's too strong!

558
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,198
We will retreat for now!

559
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:15,347
Jester, what’s the status
of the magic fusion?

560
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:18,809
Hey you. We’re at about 20% complete.

561
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,020
Generally speaking, we're golden.

562
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,899
It should be finished by dawn,
right on schedule.

563
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,442
That’s good to hear.

564
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,068
And I want to thank you

565
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,613
for fighting the good fight with me.

566
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,741
It’s finally happening!
A brand-new nation!

567
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,535
No one will ever cry
or have joy taken from them again.

568
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:37,995
We’ll triumph.

569
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:41,415
These poor lost souls
will be saved and born again.

570
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,335
What I seek
is a society free from oppression,

571
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:47,129
where no one
seeks to lord over another individual.

572
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:51,550
I trust that you can achieve that
as part of your plan, Conrad?

573
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:53,636
Yes.

574
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,971
How about the mana veins?

575
00:41:56,055 --> 00:42:00,059
Don’t worry,
I managed to find the perfect one.

576
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:03,979
It's at a village called Hage
in the Forsaken Realm,

577
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,856
where a demon skeleton rests.

578
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,368
On its own,
my Key Magic is practically useless.

579
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,995
I have to borrow power from other mages.

580
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,124
Kinda goes hand in hand with the future
I'm fighting for, like it's my destiny.

581
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:28,003
One day soon,
I’m going to change this whole country.

582
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,758
I like to think that my real magic

583
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,468
is 'never giving up.'

584
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,603
I told you that we were alike.

585
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,665
Where am I?

586
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,835
Noelle!

587
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,796
I’m so happy you're awake!

588
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:13,173
I’m sorry. I healed you as best I could.

589
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,508
Mimosa…

590
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,720
I’m glad you made it out.

591
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:25,603
We should be safe here.
This is a Golden Dawn emergency shelter.

592
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:29,356
It's still under construction,
so only a few members know about it.

593
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,985
They tried to capture everyone
at the arena to steal our magic,

594
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,778
but the captains stopped them.

595
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,780
They bought us time to escape.

596
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,247
Take care of the kid, you hear me?

597
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,835
I don’t know
what happened to them afterwards,

598
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:52,338
but they’re not here yet, so, you know…

599
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,009
Hey, are you okay?

600
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,345
Asta’s up? Excuse me!

601
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:04,808
Asta, please! You need to rest
until your body's fully healed!

602
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,978
Conrad… must be stopped.

603
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:12,274
He’s gonna destroy the kingdom
and everybody in it.

604
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,527
If we don’t do something,
the world ends tomorrow at dawn!

605
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:16,737
Dawn?!

606
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,031
How are we supposed to fight such enemies?

607
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:21,283
Is it really
a former Wizard King?

608
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,786
There's no way
we can do anything ourselves.

609
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:26,080
-We’re not strong enough--
-Come on!

610
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,831
We could just hide--

611
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,792
-We can't hide forever.
-Hey! Listen!

612
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,503
There’s nothing we can do
with these numbers.

613
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,797
It probably won’t be long
before they find us here,

614
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,884
so we should pack and run while we can.
We’ll move out and settle somewhere else.

615
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:42,137
Maybe the Heart Kingdom will take us in.
We’ll be safe there.

616
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,848
This isn’t a fight
we’re going to be able to win!

617
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,559
Not a bad idea
to ask other nations for help.

618
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,853
We’re talking about
a massive undertaking.

619
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,647
It’d be difficult
to move the injured safely.

620
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,732
If this Conrad’s
really a former Wizard King,

621
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,150
do we have any choice but to flee?

622
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,652
And Lord Julius gone…

623
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:59,321
Why get hurt fighting
when we know we’ll fail?

624
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,283
What the crap
are you talkin' about?!

625
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,536
Running away? No!

626
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,287
We have to do something.

627
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,956
We have to at least try!

628
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,292
We’re the Magic Knights
of the Clover Kingdom, aren’t we?

629
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,210
Not cowards!

630
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,214
We've been able
to live happily and peacefully

631
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,466
thanks to the Wizard King
and the past mages

632
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,969
who looked out for us our entire lives.

633
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,513
They protected us
before we joined our squads,

634
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:27,433
when we were kids,
heck, before we were even born!

635
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:30,477
They fought for us no matter the odds
and never backed down!

636
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:33,397
And the Wizard King led the way!

637
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,359
Making sure that the country was safe!
That we could live our lives!

638
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:41,572
It's thanks to the sacrifices they made
that the Clover Kingdom exists now!

639
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:45,409
Without them and their passion,
we wouldn’t be who we are today!

640
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,493
Asta…

641
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,246
I won't turn my back
on this country.

642
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,081
It's my turn to look after

643
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:54,084
everything the Wizard King
and the captains have protected.

644
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,335
To take a stand!

645
00:45:56,044 --> 00:46:00,466
But it’s not just me. It’s your turn too!
This is our chance to make a difference!

646
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:04,219
I'll heal up using my fighting spirit!

647
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:07,973
And I’ll face Conrad again
and kick his butt for real this time!

648
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,569
We can stop him if we work together.

649
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:24,740
We may not be strong enough
to win against him by ourselves,

650
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:28,827
but if we join forces,
we'll turn into something unstoppable.

651
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,955
Isn’t that the point
of being Magic Knights?

652
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,749
Why we’re here in the first place?

653
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,002
If all of us join together
and pool our power,

654
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,838
there's no enemy anywhere
who could stop us!

655
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,758
I’m not forcing anyone to come with me.

656
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,345
Sekke made a good point.
You can still escape.

657
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:48,597
Hide out in the Heart Kingdom
or somewhere.

658
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,266
But please, stay!

659
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:54,603
Some of you have to be willing
to lend me your strength in this fight!

660
00:46:56,688 --> 00:47:00,025
Sounds good. But it's not much of a plan.

661
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:04,029
Well, I suppose that’s to be expected
from a reckless fool.

662
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,113
So I’ll lend a hand.

663
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,379
I’m not gonna let you do this alone.

664
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:21,338
Not a chance.

665
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:30,180
King Julius isn’t here to lead the way.

666
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,349
And we can’t rely on our captains either.

667
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:34,977
But that shouldn't make a difference
to any of you.

668
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,603
We’ll battle on their behalf.

669
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,439
Now’s our chance
to prove that we have what it takes

670
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,233
with everything on the line!

671
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,359
I’ll say it again.

672
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:46,488
Look around. You’re the Magic Knights
of the Clover Kingdom.

673
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,866
We’ll fight as one.
Save the whole country.

674
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,159
And surpass all our limits!

675
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,619
Yeah!

676
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,997
So! What are we gonna do first?

677
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,957
I’m gonna figure that out,
right now!

678
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,125
You’re what?!

679
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,545
I can’t take this anymore.

680
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:05,299
They’re gonna get themselves killed.
But not me. I’m escaping.

681
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:07,634
Wha-ha?

682
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,052
Ha-ha!

683
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,934
What’s all this shouting?

684
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:21,940
Now’s not the time for empty words,
you hot-headed imbecile!

685
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:34,453
Lady Big-sis-leon! And more captains!

686
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,956
I didn't know you were alive--
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

687
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,960
Who are you calling,
"Big sis," huh? And don't assume I'm dead.

688
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,672
I’ve been on my own
doing some intense training.

689
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,093
Ah. Guests.

690
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,347
I hope you’re here to tell me
we're gonna have some fun.

691
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,932
I also have been away.

692
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,975
On a mission with Jack.

693
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,939
Fortunately, that means
I wasn’t caught up in the initial attack.

694
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:07,152
The same goes for me. Now that we’re here,
we must rescue the others.

695
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:11,114
We brought some other people
back from our mission.

696
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,950
They should come in handy.

697
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,202
They're already out there,
pulling their weight,

698
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,329
surveilling the giant flying arena.

699
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:21,708
According to them, it looks like Yami
and the other captains are still with us.

700
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:25,212
However, they’re currently trapped
inside the barrier.

701
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:26,672
Captain Yami.

702
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,256
Nozel is alive.

703
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,009
Thank goodness, Yami,
I couldn’t handle your dying!

704
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,220
There’s something I don’t get.

705
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,262
They're captured.

706
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,765
Why hold such powerful
Magic Knights captive?

707
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:41,019
-Wouldn't killing them be easier?
-Because Conrad needs them alive.

708
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,271
He's wielding the Imperial Sword.

709
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,190
With it, he can absorb their power,

710
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:47,526
giving him and his friends
unlimited strength.

711
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:50,445
Que, que!
So they’re his livestock!

712
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:54,116
Oh! Earlier he said something
about needing a ton of power.

713
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,618
His plan depends on
sucking it out of them!

714
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:59,454
So that’s what we’re dealing with.

715
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,040
But if he siphons off
their magical powers, then…

716
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,167
We don’t have much time.

717
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:07,087
Asta, knights, gather all your courage.

718
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,964
We're taking back the kingdom!

719
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,007
Right!

720
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:14,219
Before you run into battle,
I wanna get those tummies full.

721
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:16,596
Open wide!

722
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,732
Whoa! Charmy, you’re okay!

723
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,734
-I was worried.
-That’s right.

724
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:31,653
Rouge and Captain Yami
gave us the opportunity to escape.

725
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:34,740
-You're safe!
-Hmm.

726
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,242
Noelle, it’s good to see you.

727
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:41,246
Unfortunately, our base was trapped
inside one of their barriers.

728
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:45,042
Henry and Gordon are there now.
I'm sure they're holding up.

729
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,209
Good.

730
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:50,130
Then our first objective
is to break them out, right?

731
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,008
The Black Bulls' base.

732
00:50:57,095 --> 00:51:00,098
The Imperial Sword
has absorbed tremendous amounts of power.

733
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:02,809
They'll drive it into a vein of mana
called a singular point.

734
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:07,022
Que! Well, that will spell
the end of this kingdom. Toodle-oo!

735
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:10,400
Given all that we know
it’s safe to assume the Wizard Kings

736
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,819
were revived with Conrad’s magic
and the sword.

737
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,572
So what if we break the sword?

738
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:18,325
Would that take their power away?
Make 'em dead again?

739
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:22,829
Given the precautions they’re taking,
I’d say that’s highly likely.

740
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:27,209
Right. Our goal's to destroy
the Imperial Sword.

741
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:29,044
Cut off their power source.

742
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:32,130
Do whatever you need
to prepare for the battle ahead of us.

743
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,800
Dawn is fast approaching,

744
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,635
and that's our deadline!

745
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:49,064
I still can't use
the powerful spells in my grimoire,

746
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:51,608
but thanks to Charmy,
my magic has returned.

747
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:55,070
For now, I’ll focus on what I can do!

748
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:03,829
Hmm?

749
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:11,586
Wait up!

750
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,343
Hmm. I take it you're healed. You ready?

751
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,220
Oh yeah!

752
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:26,893
THE BASE OF THE BLACK BULLS SQUAD

753
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,312
This is strange.

754
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,815
When I got back from training,
Henry was the only one here.

755
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,567
It appears the former Wizard Kings

756
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,735
were somehow revived
and have taken over the capital.

757
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,165
No barrier's gonna stop me!

758
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:51,626
First, we go and rescue those
at the base of the Black Bulls.

759
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,629
Wha-- I’m glad,
but are you sure?

760
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,089
This'll be difficult.

761
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,884
Our success hinges on us
preserving our fighting power.

762
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,178
Plus, we're in need of transport.

763
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,930
Something that will allow us
to move everyone safely.

764
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,724
I understand.

765
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:10,312
Don’t you get it, kid? We'll tick off
some important boxes if we have your base.

766
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,022
-Oh.
-That's true.

767
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:16,568
But don't forget that Conrad has stolen
many types of magic he can use against us.

768
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:19,988
It’s safe to assume he’ll easily
be able to counter normal attacks.

769
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:22,282
That’s where you come in, Asta.

770
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:25,952
Anti-Magic neutralizes every type
of magic power.

771
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,746
And since that’s what you wield,

772
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:30,707
you will be
our only hope of defeating Conrad.

773
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,918
We’ll work to give you that opportunity.

774
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,879
So what do you say? Are you in?

775
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:37,839
Yes, sir!

776
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:48,433
All right!

777
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:53,438
Welcome back, everyone.
Oh, wow, we have so many guests!

778
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:56,358
What’s the story, Henry?
Can you get us off the ground?

779
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,359
Let's get goin'!

780
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:01,696
I've got you covered!

781
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:06,368
Quickly! Replenish your energy
by stuffing those faces!

782
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:16,253
I've never felt
so much magic power before!

783
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,610
So cool!

784
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,655
The Black Bulls
are really flying in style now!

785
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:46,533
Hold on.
This thing is gonna fly?

786
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:50,954
If there's enough power,
I think it will!

787
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,874
You should hold on.

788
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:01,256
More resistance than expected. Damn.

789
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,051
Que, que! Severing Magic…

790
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:10,223
…Death Scythe: Lunatic Slash!

791
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:13,143
Briar Magic…

792
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,562
Crimson Vine Spear!

793
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:29,117
-Barely a dent in them.
-Que, que! How annoying!

794
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,036
Huh? Argh!

795
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,621
Argh! Argh!

796
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,046
Que, que!

797
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,923
Perfect opportunity to slice and dice!

798
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,509
We’ll stop them
from interfering with our mission.

799
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,928
The rest of you go on ahead!

800
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,431
-Captain Jack! Captain Charlotte!
-Hold on!

801
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,683
-If you go, we can’t defeat Conrad.
-Uh--

802
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,353
Yeah, but-- There's only two of 'em.

803
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,730
Two don't stand a chance.

804
00:55:58,813 --> 00:55:59,647
Three…

805
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,733
is a better number.

806
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:13,328
World Tree Magic:
Great Mistilteinn Tree!

807
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,005
Go. While you have an opening.

808
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,340
Captain Vangeance!

809
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:27,801
Are you ready?

810
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:36,893
Hey.

811
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:51,991
Yuno.

812
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,035
I leave the Wizard King to you.

813
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:59,124
Well, I’d say it’s as good a time as any
to ask our barbarous guests to leave.

814
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,798
Listen closely.

815
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:10,218
We may be out three captains now,
but we’re still goin' in!

816
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,011
-Hey, Asta.
-Hmm?

817
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,930
-Handle the pep talk.
-Huh?

818
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:22,897
Right! We got this, you guys!
We'll give 'em everything we've got

819
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:26,025
and take the Clover Kingdom back
from these losers!

820
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,862
Yeah!

821
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,452
I've received an update from my soldiers.

822
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,454
The rebels have begun countermeasures.

823
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,414
How shall we proceed?

824
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:41,958
They decided to resist.

825
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,628
As I know you would
if you were in their shoes.

826
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,424
The grand finale is upon us.

827
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:51,676
I’ve saved you
the best seat for the climax.

828
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,721
Is that why you kept me alive until now,

829
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,931
even after you took
almost all of my power?

830
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,435
Those you love,
those you want to protect,

831
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:04,939
I want their agonizing final breaths
to haunt your remaining hours.

832
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:08,485
They will die
in front of their powerless false king.

833
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:12,822
Only then will the new era
of the Clover Kingdom begin.

834
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,700
I hope you’re ready
for a stunning show.

835
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:32,425
Huh? What is that?!

836
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,722
Is that an enormous barrier?!

837
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:40,308
It's far more powerful
than the one at our base.

838
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,393
This will be tough to break through.

839
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:43,311
Oh, hey! Look!

840
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:52,862
Well, well, one last desperate attempt
to stop us.

841
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,365
I'm gonna be totally honest with you.

842
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:56,574
This is hopeless!

843
00:58:57,325 --> 00:59:01,579
You see, a Wizard King
never leaves his blind spot open!

844
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,506
What’ll you do now?

845
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:16,469
Our enemy's working with this much power?!

846
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,264
He’s in a totally different league!
What should we do?

847
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,224
Stay back!

848
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,183
Huh?

849
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,727
It’s not your time to shine yet.

850
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:27,355
We’ll handle this guy. No sweat.

851
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:31,109
We just gotta surpass our limits
like we always do. Right?

852
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:39,576
You ready, guys?
Show 'em what we're made of!

853
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:40,493
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

854
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:44,414
Flame Magic:
Gargantuan Exploding Fireball!

855
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:47,417
Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!

856
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,420
Poison Magic: Forbidden Fruit!

857
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:52,547
O… kay.

858
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:55,008
Everyone ready?

859
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,510
Yeah!

860
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:05,059
Mirror Magic:
Large Reflect Refrain!

861
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:10,565
Let's go!

862
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:26,914
Bwa-ha! Crap!Two more!

863
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:29,250
All right! This is it!

864
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:32,003
Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel Gate!

865
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:35,506
Huh.

866
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:40,345
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
We're going to run right into the barrier!

867
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,930
That shield is interfering
with my magic.

868
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,932
There’s no way I can get us inside.

869
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:46,934
But…

870
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:47,894
you can.

871
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:56,444
Asta, I know you can do this.

872
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:12,377
Face us, so we can get this over with.

873
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,839
That was easy.

874
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,926
Thanks for walking into our trap,
ya walking corpses.

875
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,053
Magic like this is of no consequence--

876
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:24,972
Sealing Magic: Eternal Prison!

877
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:29,435
-Finral! Now! Don’t let them fight back!
-Right! Here goes.

878
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,562
Also, don't forget I am your superior!

879
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,357
Got 'em! We’re good.

880
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:45,952
Didn't I tell you?
I don't have a weak spot!

881
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:50,957
Argh!

882
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:01,300
Whoa! Thanks for the assist!

883
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:10,476
You do realize
that this barrier has been fortified

884
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,936
with the Imperial Sword?

885
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:15,690
Even if you did break through,
it would quickly regenerate. No problem.

886
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:18,860
Now, in order to ensure our perfect world,

887
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:21,237
I should get rid of
any flies in our ointment!

888
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:23,489
This is the end!

889
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,325
Yeah, for you!

890
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:34,792
Oh, that was nice!
Show me what else ya got!

891
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:38,212
Mana Zone: Tornado Fang Double Attacks!

892
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,300
Was that supposed to hurt?

893
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,677
Now! Fire at will!

894
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:53,519
One more time!

895
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,354
Ah.

896
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,317
Let's go!

897
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:06,532
Nice. I'm loving this. Don't stop!

898
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:21,422
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

899
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:33,601
Ha! Color me shocked!

900
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:35,686
You guys are kind of amazing!

901
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:37,396
Too bad.

902
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:39,941
Hold on!

903
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:44,529
I'm counting on you, Asta!
You better take that maniac down!

904
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:45,780
Yes, ma’am!

905
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:48,074
Conrad, here I come!

906
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:51,702
Hey, look!

907
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,080
It’s him!

908
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:55,915
Why’s he out here?

909
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:59,460
That's the vein. Right there!

910
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:02,713
It’s in the skeleton of that demon!

911
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:08,511
Oh no!

912
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:12,974
This is as far as you go!
I’ll handle you!

913
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,484
Asta! Leave him to me,
and take care of Conrad!

914
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,489
Give 'im everything you’ve got.

915
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:30,491
Yeah!

916
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,122
Ugh.

917
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,297
It's time. Bell?

918
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,882
Thought you’d never ask!

919
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:47,842
Let’s go all out!

920
01:04:56,976 --> 01:05:00,021
Spirit Assimilation: Spirit Dive!

921
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,068
All units! Get into positions!

922
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:09,363
Our plan worked,
and we were able to split up our enemies!

923
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:14,702
Now, each of you will take
your places and fight to your death!

924
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:16,704
Show them the pride of a Magic Knight!

925
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,291
Fail and you will answer to me!

926
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:24,045
Not one of you
is allowed to get killed, you hear me?!

927
01:05:24,962 --> 01:05:28,299
If you don’t prevail
or you suffer mortal injuries,

928
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:30,509
I’ll burn you to death myself!

929
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:32,929
Understand?

930
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:35,806
If you don’t wanna die, then win!

931
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,308
Even if it kills you!

932
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:39,310
We won't lose.

933
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:40,561
Right!

934
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:44,315
You aren’t pulling out
any special tricks

935
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:46,067
to use in your fight against me?

936
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:50,321
How unfortunate that I find myself saddled
with such a boring opponent.

937
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:52,490
You expected tricks?

938
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:55,326
I'm not some weakling
who can’t win an honest fight.

939
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,536
Princia Funnybunny.

940
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:01,832
A feared warrior with a combat strength
of a thousand soldiers.

941
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,418
Mighty even among Wizard Kings.

942
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:06,921
According to the history books,

943
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:11,175
no matter how bad a fight might've looked,
you always came out on top!

944
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:16,097
No tricks here. Just me.
A fair fight to see how we compare.

945
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:19,850
Very well, then. I take back my comments.

946
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:23,354
Legion Magic: Endless Domination!

947
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:28,985
If you want the honor of playing with me,
you need to prove you’re worthy first.

948
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:37,618
Challenge happily accepted!

949
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:39,370
But…

950
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:42,957
you better not hold anything back,
you hear me?!

951
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,387
Where is he?

952
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:59,140
Were you even trying to aim?

953
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:00,182
Load out!

954
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:08,315
You’re a fool if you think
you managed to lure me into a snare.

955
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:11,152
It's quite the opposite, you silly boy.

956
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:14,155
I’m the one who lured you
into what will soon be your tomb!

957
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:19,660
All that absorbed magical energy
isn’t just powering this flying fortress,

958
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:23,330
we’re able to tap into
as much of it as we want as well.

959
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:26,459
Which means as long as I’m here,
the well of my power

960
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:29,045
doesn’t have any risk of running dry!

961
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:35,092
Ha. You’re dense enough to believe
that means you’ve won?

962
01:07:35,676 --> 01:07:36,719
Against us?

963
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:37,970
Wait. "Us"?

964
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:41,265
Not too shabby, Pretty Boy.

965
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:44,226
But points docked for being so rough.

966
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:47,480
You’re supposed to be gentle
with a damsel in distress.

967
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:50,775
I am a Virgo, after all. Poor form!

968
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:54,028
You mean, those earlier attacks…

969
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:56,906
He wasn’t aiming for me.

970
01:07:58,115 --> 01:07:59,533
I’ll do better next time.

971
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:01,452
Are you good?

972
01:08:01,535 --> 01:08:03,954
Of course, it’s my duty as a captain.

973
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:07,708
Can’t have you kids risking your lives
without surpassing my limits.

974
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,210
Agreed, fellas?

975
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:12,379
Undoubtedly.

976
01:08:14,548 --> 01:08:18,219
We will show you our power!
What makes us Magic Knights!

977
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:20,221
Yuno! We’ve got your back covered.

978
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:24,183
You stay focused on attacking.

979
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:34,610
Oh yeah?

980
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:38,697
Well, at least you'll talk less
when I've killed you.

981
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:41,033
This so-called backup of yours?

982
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:44,745
They’ve been chained up all day
while we siphoned off their magical power

983
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:46,831
to fuel our magnificent fortress.

984
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:50,334
These guys are beat. I’m surprised
they can even stand at this point!

985
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:54,338
What good are these empty vessels
gonna do you?Oh, don’t tell me!

986
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:57,883
You think you can stand against me
'cause you've got nerve?

987
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,344
Fine! Go ahead and try it!

988
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:03,347
But nobody can bounce back
from being drained that quickly!

989
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:09,478
You call yourself a Wizard King,
but you know so little.

990
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:11,355
Not a chance!

991
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:15,860
Come at me, you bastards!

992
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:20,322
Flame Magic: Explosive Scattershot!

993
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:46,182
Your turn! Grey!

994
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:48,893
Okay!

995
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:51,562
Magic Conversion!

996
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:11,248
Thank you
for getting me out of the way!

997
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:13,876
I may not be able
to use strong magic,

998
01:10:13,959 --> 01:10:16,045
but I can still help without my grimoire.

999
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:18,797
Looks like we’ll be able to handle him.

1000
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:23,219
Yes, if Asta's successful,
the Wizard Kings will be felled.

1001
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:26,222
If he touches their sword
with his Demon-Slayer Sword,

1002
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:27,681
this will all be over.

1003
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:30,684
All we have to do
is keep him occupied here

1004
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:32,478
until he’s able to do that.

1005
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:35,105
What a pathetic showing.

1006
01:10:36,106 --> 01:10:39,109
Take heed of my words. For your sake.

1007
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:41,070
Turn your tails and run.

1008
01:10:41,153 --> 01:10:43,572
Hide somewhere
our eyes will not reach you.

1009
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:47,451
Wow. Nice of you to warn us, grandpa.

1010
01:10:47,534 --> 01:10:49,203
Gotta say I’m confused.

1011
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:51,538
I thought your whole goal
was to kill us off.

1012
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:54,166
If you were
corrupt nobles and royals

1013
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,961
who only thought of
what would benefit yourselves,

1014
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:58,921
then I would take no mercy on you.

1015
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,757
But you’re not.

1016
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:05,678
I can tell from where I stand
that you possess hearts that are pure.

1017
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:07,054
Retreat!

1018
01:11:07,137 --> 01:11:08,973
If you swear to stay out of our way,

1019
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:11,475
I give you my word
that I'll allow you to escape.

1020
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:14,144
Are you for real?

1021
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:17,648
You want us to do nothing
while the bad guys ruin everything?

1022
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:19,233
Don't you know?

1023
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:22,736
We wouldn't retreat
if our lives depended on it!

1024
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:28,659
Such foolishness is pitiful.

1025
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:34,039
Ice Wedge Magic: World End Church!

1026
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:44,508
You honestly thought
you could beat me

1027
01:11:44,591 --> 01:11:48,721
when you attack with such
insignificant levels of magical power?

1028
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:54,393
My Mana Zone lowers the temperature
of this environment far below freezing!

1029
01:11:56,103 --> 01:12:01,025
Amateurs like you won’t be able to breathe
on the battlefield I have created.

1030
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:07,531
Move, dang it!

1031
01:12:08,198 --> 01:12:09,700
I don’t understand,

1032
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:12,536
were you not all so oppressed
by this society?

1033
01:12:12,619 --> 01:12:15,539
Why do you reject our goal
of a fairer world?

1034
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:18,042
-Yeah, you don’t get it.
-Hmm?

1035
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:21,545
Magic Knights
will give their all to survive.

1036
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:25,049
Even if it’s hard,
there’s no way we’re giving up.

1037
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:28,552
You have no right
to take a person's life away from them.

1038
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:30,054
Who do you think you are?!

1039
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:31,013
Hmm.

1040
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:33,515
Indeed.

1041
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:36,518
No man has that right.

1042
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:39,897
That’s exactly why things must change.

1043
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:42,858
I’ll do what I must to create a society

1044
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:46,362
where outsiders and the powerless
can lead happy lives.

1045
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:47,488
Empty words.

1046
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:49,990
You can’t justify it--

1047
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:52,618
Weakness is also pitiable.

1048
01:12:57,581 --> 01:12:59,792
Legion Magic: Blink Castling.

1049
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,424
You’re wearing yourself out.

1050
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:10,302
And without ever coming close
to striking me.

1051
01:13:14,264 --> 01:13:15,682
Sleep now.

1052
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:17,684
I refuse.

1053
01:13:18,268 --> 01:13:21,688
Not 'til I've incinerated
everything in sight!

1054
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:25,692
Mana Zone: Full Release!

1055
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:27,569
Flame Magic…

1056
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:30,864
Calidos Brachium…

1057
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:33,492
Purgatory!

1058
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,999
Oh yes!

1059
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,585
Now the fun really begins!

1060
01:13:55,013 --> 01:13:58,600
"Mereoleona."
Is that what you said your name was?

1061
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:01,937
You made me raise my fist against you.

1062
01:14:03,063 --> 01:14:04,898
Interesting.

1063
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:05,858
I like it!

1064
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:23,709
It's not often
that I get to use this on someone!

1065
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:26,253
You make for a suitable dance partner.

1066
01:14:26,336 --> 01:14:28,380
I'm pleasantly surprised.

1067
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,798
You’re a strong one.

1068
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:33,218
But you still don't compare to me.

1069
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:34,178
Round two!

1070
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:39,349
What are we gonna do, Yuno?

1071
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:41,894
At this rate,
Yami and the others won't last long!

1072
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:42,895
I know that.

1073
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:52,446
Captain Nozel!

1074
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:59,077
Yuno, don't attempt something
beyond your power.

1075
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:00,746
Know your strengths.

1076
01:15:01,246 --> 01:15:03,832
Focus on what
you're capable of achieving right now.

1077
01:15:06,084 --> 01:15:08,587
And don’t bother worrying
about the rest of us.

1078
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:20,349
If possible, can you buy me
a little more time?

1079
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:25,604
I’ll finish him with my next blow!

1080
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:35,531
What’s the matter, Captain Macho Scruff?

1081
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:37,950
Don’t tell me
you’ve run out of fight already?

1082
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:43,330
You have terrible taste
in nicknames.

1083
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:47,584
Look closer, and you'll find that
underneath this scruff,

1084
01:15:47,668 --> 01:15:49,836
I'm a blushing maiden. You see?

1085
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:24,746
Don’t you know any other moves?

1086
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:31,837
This kid…

1087
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:36,466
he’s pouring every bit
of his magical power into a single strike!

1088
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:48,103
You pushed your way through
with sheer power after all.

1089
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:51,565
Pretty unrefined for someone like you.

1090
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:05,704
Fine.Now you’ve got
my full attention!

1091
01:17:20,385 --> 01:17:22,012
For hundreds of years…

1092
01:17:23,597 --> 01:17:26,266
you’ve continued to protect this land.

1093
01:17:29,102 --> 01:17:30,354
Watch, Lumiere.

1094
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:32,814
The world you envisioned
will come to pass.

1095
01:17:33,857 --> 01:17:36,318
I will bring your dream into existence.

1096
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:41,531
Conrad!

1097
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:43,492
There you are.

1098
01:17:43,575 --> 01:17:46,078
Asta!

1099
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:51,166
I'm afraid you’re a little late
to stop me.

1100
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:54,920
For this world…

1101
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:56,296
No, don’t!

1102
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,798
…is finished.

1103
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:10,352
And in its place,
a new reality will thrive!

1104
01:18:36,461 --> 01:18:37,796
Stand down, Asta.

1105
01:18:38,296 --> 01:18:41,967
I’ve driven the Imperial Sword’s magic
into the singular point.

1106
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:44,803
No one can stop
the fall of the Clover Kingdom.

1107
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:46,805
The fate of this land is sealed!

1108
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:53,812
No, it’s not!

1109
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:58,525
I’m gonna pull that sword out
and make you eat your words!

1110
01:18:58,608 --> 01:19:00,527
Because I don't even know how to quit!

1111
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:03,238
I’ll follow through even if it kills me!

1112
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:05,490
Hear me? You're the one
who should back off!

1113
01:19:06,324 --> 01:19:10,245
Poor child. You should take
what I’m about to say to heart, Asta.

1114
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:17,252
-My magic is 'never giving up'!
-My magic is 'never giving up'!

1115
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:27,763
If I’d had someone like you
around in my day,

1116
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:31,099
perhaps my loneliness
wouldn’t have been so all-consuming.

1117
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:34,770
Goodbye, Mereoleona.

1118
01:19:40,984 --> 01:19:42,402
Round three.

1119
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:44,780
Huh.

1120
01:19:46,907 --> 01:19:48,158
This battle…

1121
01:19:50,744 --> 01:19:52,746
…isn’t over yet!

1122
01:19:57,501 --> 01:19:59,669
Wait. Her power increased?!

1123
01:20:00,545 --> 01:20:01,421
Explain!

1124
01:20:02,005 --> 01:20:03,757
How can you still move?

1125
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:07,427
Uh. Hey there.

1126
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:09,012
Sup, Lady Mereoleona?

1127
01:20:09,095 --> 01:20:10,555
Good morning, big sis!

1128
01:20:11,264 --> 01:20:13,725
Good morning, Lady Mereoleona!

1129
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,727
Big sister.

1130
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:21,983
'Cause I've got grit!

1131
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:24,110
Also…

1132
01:20:25,028 --> 01:20:27,948
if I kick the bucket in a place like this…

1133
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:32,369
…those idiots
will think they can laugh at me!

1134
01:20:50,303 --> 01:20:52,222
And there’s another thing.

1135
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:55,851
If I’m not the strongest,

1136
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:59,020
then I can't call a certain someone…

1137
01:20:59,104 --> 01:21:01,773
…my rival anymore!

1138
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:06,862
You draw strength
from your comrades, aye?

1139
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:08,655
Not bad.

1140
01:21:08,738 --> 01:21:11,867
But I must admit it’s not my style.
Still…

1141
01:21:15,745 --> 01:21:17,622
You’ve done well, Mereoleona!

1142
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:21,459
Honestly,
I think you could beat me in a fistfight.

1143
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:22,878
So let’s see!

1144
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:27,841
Are you powerful enough
to best me when I go all-out?!

1145
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:30,635
Oh jeez.

1146
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,096
You’re really feisty for a baby knight.

1147
01:21:33,179 --> 01:21:35,640
You even made me use my trump card.

1148
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:39,144
If I had met you
when I was still the Wizard King,

1149
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:41,897
I might have made you one of my advisers.

1150
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,148
Maybe!

1151
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:49,404
What you’re doing is not right!

1152
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:51,907
Don’t gimme that.

1153
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:55,076
No one actually knows
what’s right and what’s wrong,

1154
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,913
so you don't get to make that judgment!

1155
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:00,290
We’re basically the same!

1156
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:03,043
Conrad and I have big dreams,

1157
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:07,130
and there's nothing we won't do
to bring those dreams to life!

1158
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:14,012
I get you. In a battle like this, the idea
of right and wrong kinda falls apart.

1159
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:17,807
So we’ll have to protect
what matters to us!

1160
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:21,436
Until we have nothing left to give!

1161
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,438
-Combo Spell…
-Combo Spell…

1162
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:25,440
Dimension Slash…

1163
01:22:25,523 --> 01:22:27,233
-Scorching Light!
-Scorching Light!

1164
01:22:40,664 --> 01:22:42,248
You haven't won.

1165
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:45,835
A little scratch
isn’t enough to take me out.

1166
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:47,587
That’s a shame.

1167
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:49,589
Asta, I’m borrowing your move.

1168
01:22:51,174 --> 01:22:54,844
Here’s where we are alike.
I hate losing more than anything too!

1169
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:13,363
Whatever.

1170
01:23:13,446 --> 01:23:17,117
I don’t care about saving power
for the fortress anymore.

1171
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:20,286
I’ll pour everything we’ve got…

1172
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:23,873
…into crushing you fools!

1173
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:33,967
Why can’t you accept
that I’m right?

1174
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:37,345
There's not a single part
of this unjust world

1175
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:38,888
worth protecting, boy!

1176
01:23:39,472 --> 01:23:43,226
Join me!
Let us build a new reality together!

1177
01:23:47,731 --> 01:23:51,401
I don’t care about you
or your insane ideas.

1178
01:23:51,484 --> 01:23:54,988
My dream is to become the Wizard King!

1179
01:23:55,071 --> 01:23:55,905
What nonsense.

1180
01:23:56,531 --> 01:24:00,660
Becoming a Wizard King changes nothing
in this kingdom, believe me.

1181
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:02,996
No.

1182
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:04,164
Nothing.

1183
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,289
I have you completely surrounded.

1184
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:49,959
That sword of yours will never touch me!

1185
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:54,881
No matter how much fire is in your heart,
this is beyond you!

1186
01:24:56,299 --> 01:24:58,468
I’ll make you an offer one last time.

1187
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:01,471
Stand beside us, Asta.

1188
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:05,558
I'll even name you as my successor.

1189
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:08,978
The new world will need a new king.

1190
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:17,487
You’re crazy! Hell, no!

1191
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:20,740
You don’t ask someone
to make you the Wizard King!

1192
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:23,368
You earn the title
through your own merits!

1193
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:26,746
And you’re wrong. I can stop you.

1194
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:29,874
If there isn’t a way…

1195
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:33,128
…I’ll make one!

1196
01:25:37,257 --> 01:25:39,300
Y’know what this world taught me?

1197
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:42,262
To go harder and surpass my limits!

1198
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:52,230
Good.
That was an impressive attack.

1199
01:25:52,313 --> 01:25:55,150
And out of respect, I didn’t parry it.

1200
01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:58,611
But I tire of hearing your naïve notions.

1201
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:02,615
And I'm done
playing pointless games.

1202
01:26:03,283 --> 01:26:05,785
If we cannot walk this path together,

1203
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:08,371
there’s no point in holding back anymore.

1204
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:12,625
Asta, I didn’t ask you
to join our cause because of your power.

1205
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:16,504
That would be welcome
but wholly unnecessary.

1206
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:19,716
Nor was it because you know
this nation’s inequalities.

1207
01:26:20,216 --> 01:26:23,928
I simply wanted someone
with the same determination as me

1208
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:25,805
to be rewarded in life.

1209
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:30,852
Unfortunately, you chose
to keep your eyes clenched firmly shut!

1210
01:26:31,978 --> 01:26:33,396
What a shame.

1211
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:16,689
I'm neutralizing him
with my Anti-Magic,

1212
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:18,524
but I can't keep up!

1213
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:24,530
That's it!

1214
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:29,577
Finally, let's go.

1215
01:27:30,203 --> 01:27:33,581
I’ve been waiting
for him to think he could go easy on us.

1216
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:36,376
Exploding Fireball!

1217
01:27:37,543 --> 01:27:41,214
From there, Flame Bondage Formation!

1218
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:45,593
Full Reflection!

1219
01:27:52,558 --> 01:27:56,104
Ice Wedge Magic: World End Martyr!

1220
01:28:03,861 --> 01:28:08,491
To be clear, this is me going easy on you.

1221
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:15,748
Consider that to be a lesson,
young soldier.

1222
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:18,751
You think way too highly of yourself,
you old fart.

1223
01:28:19,502 --> 01:28:21,504
Come on, Asta. Hurry it up!

1224
01:28:22,088 --> 01:28:24,382
Our magic isn’t going to hold out
much longer!

1225
01:28:25,591 --> 01:28:27,385
Black Hurricane!

1226
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:33,141
It's admirable that you still manage
to keep your spirits high.

1227
01:28:33,224 --> 01:28:36,185
but your movements are slowing down!

1228
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:41,190
One Horn Bull Thrust!

1229
01:28:48,031 --> 01:28:51,200
No matter
how much you struggle against me,

1230
01:28:51,284 --> 01:28:53,536
you’ll never bridge the gap between us!

1231
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:57,957
Behold!
The power of the Wizard King!

1232
01:29:03,755 --> 01:29:05,506
You can tell yourself that.

1233
01:29:06,424 --> 01:29:07,425
But…

1234
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:10,470
I’ll never call
someone like you the Wizard King.

1235
01:29:11,262 --> 01:29:15,600
Crap. If I let my guard down,
my black form is done for.

1236
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:18,811
I need to land a solid hit
with everything I’ve got left.

1237
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:22,065
You have a skewed idea
of what a king is capable of.

1238
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:24,817
You think the Wizard King's all powerful.

1239
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:28,821
But none were able to bring revolution
to this nation, including the first!

1240
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:33,451
In fact, Julius did quite the opposite
when he was beaten by the elves.

1241
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:35,828
Or have you forgotten?!

1242
01:29:35,912 --> 01:29:39,791
Because of him,
the Clover Kingdom almost met its doom!

1243
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:42,210
Changing nothing! Protecting nothing!

1244
01:29:42,293 --> 01:29:45,713
Every Wizard King
has been effectively useless.

1245
01:29:47,006 --> 01:29:49,801
-It's not like that.
-Hmm?

1246
01:29:50,301 --> 01:29:52,637
You're forgetting
that the current Wizard King

1247
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:55,681
gave his own life to protect his citizens.

1248
01:29:56,599 --> 01:29:58,351
Exactly like the first one did.

1249
01:29:59,268 --> 01:30:02,688
And even after he’d given everything
to keep the kingdom safe,

1250
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:03,981
he kept on sleeping,

1251
01:30:04,565 --> 01:30:06,859
waiting for hundreds of years.

1252
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:08,986
And do you know why?

1253
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:11,781
All so when we needed him again,
he’d be there!

1254
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:19,831
The leaves of a clover
are said to each contain one thing.

1255
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:23,668
In the first three
dwells integrity, hope, and love.

1256
01:30:24,168 --> 01:30:26,754
The fourth leaf
is given over to good luck.

1257
01:30:27,296 --> 01:30:30,425
And in the fifth, there lives the devil.

1258
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:36,639
Is he seriously about to die again?

1259
01:30:36,722 --> 01:30:38,683
This kid's such a piece of work.

1260
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:43,187
I suppose I’ll help, and then later,
I'll collect my payment in full.

1261
01:30:46,607 --> 01:30:47,525
Enough talk.

1262
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:49,610
You were able to become the Wizard King

1263
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:52,280
because a bunch of people
recognized your virtues!

1264
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:56,284
And betraying those people
makes you unfit to carry the title!

1265
01:30:57,869 --> 01:30:58,995
You’re just a fake!

1266
01:31:00,955 --> 01:31:05,334
'Cause a real Wizard King
inspires the people he protects!

1267
01:31:05,835 --> 01:31:08,588
He gives them a dream to chase after.

1268
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:11,507
He's the opposite of useless!

1269
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:17,555
You still don’t understand
the true nature of the place you live.

1270
01:31:18,222 --> 01:31:21,642
Discrimination and prejudice run rampant.
You know that!

1271
01:31:21,726 --> 01:31:26,063
Haven’t you seen people’s hopes and dreams
crushed over and over again in this land?

1272
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:29,692
Without my help,
this country will never change!

1273
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:32,945
Our future
is not for you to decide!

1274
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:37,533
Right now, no matter how rich
or royal someone is,

1275
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:41,245
everybody works together
to make sure we all live a better life!

1276
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:43,122
So stay out of our way!

1277
01:31:43,206 --> 01:31:46,959
Such insignificant improvements
will never break the cycle.

1278
01:31:47,043 --> 01:31:50,004
You’re the one
in the way of progress!

1279
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:57,595
There you are.
Took long enough, but I feel like

1280
01:31:57,678 --> 01:32:01,140
I'm finally getting a taste
of what the real you is all about!

1281
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:03,351
Shut up!

1282
01:32:03,893 --> 01:32:06,437
I will no longer suffer
the fantasies of a child

1283
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:10,608
who knows nothing
of the real world!

1284
01:32:12,735 --> 01:32:15,112
Not good.

1285
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:17,156
My black form is coming undone!

1286
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:21,786
I admit, there was a time
I trusted this country and its citizens.

1287
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:25,915
When I was the Wizard King, I championed
the incremental changes you speak of.

1288
01:32:25,998 --> 01:32:28,668
But people are always bound to betray you.

1289
01:32:28,751 --> 01:32:31,170
I’m sure you know something about that.

1290
01:32:31,254 --> 01:32:35,299
So a small portion of your community
has changed for the better,

1291
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:37,593
do you honestly think
the rest of the country

1292
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:39,554
will alter their behavior as well?

1293
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:42,306
It’s not about change.

1294
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:46,310
It’s about coming together!
You wanna world in your own image!

1295
01:32:46,894 --> 01:32:50,773
A place where you’re actually the only one
with the freedom to be happy.

1296
01:32:50,856 --> 01:32:52,858
Well, I wanna laugh with everyone!

1297
01:32:52,942 --> 01:32:55,570
I want my friends to smile, always.

1298
01:32:56,070 --> 01:33:00,241
That’s why we're gonna bring change
to this country together!

1299
01:33:00,324 --> 01:33:04,161
You’ll all form a nation
full of citizens who respect each other.

1300
01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:06,330
One where laughter is everywhere!

1301
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:09,542
That’s the kind of world
I’m gonna make a reality!

1302
01:33:20,553 --> 01:33:22,722
My magic! It’s back!

1303
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:26,851
Noelle!

1304
01:33:32,231 --> 01:33:35,359
Water Creation Magic:
Valkyrie Armor!

1305
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:37,111
Yeah!

1306
01:33:37,194 --> 01:33:38,946
You struggle in vain.

1307
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:42,366
This defiance only keeps you
from living in an ideal world.

1308
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:44,910
Why fight against me?

1309
01:33:46,954 --> 01:33:49,123
A truly ideal world,

1310
01:33:49,206 --> 01:33:52,126
isn’t something
you have to force on other people!

1311
01:33:52,209 --> 01:33:54,629
It’s something
we have to earn ourselves!

1312
01:33:55,212 --> 01:33:57,340
Noelle! Here! Look at me!

1313
01:33:58,966 --> 01:34:02,345
Mirror Magic: Mirror Brigade!

1314
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:09,143
The truth is
I used to resent this life as well.

1315
01:34:09,226 --> 01:34:10,978
I was abandoned by my family

1316
01:34:11,062 --> 01:34:13,731
because I couldn't learn
to control my magic powers.

1317
01:34:14,231 --> 01:34:17,234
For a while,
I thought I was alone in this world.

1318
01:34:17,735 --> 01:34:21,030
But now, I have amazing friends!

1319
01:34:21,614 --> 01:34:24,325
Ones who make sure I know that I belong.

1320
01:34:24,867 --> 01:34:27,620
They accepted me and my shortcomings.

1321
01:34:27,703 --> 01:34:29,246
And they support me!

1322
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:32,541
They stand beside me
as I race forward toward my dreams!

1323
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:35,169
Combo Spell…

1324
01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:37,672
Mirror Meteo…

1325
01:34:40,966 --> 01:34:42,301
Dragon!

1326
01:34:45,888 --> 01:34:47,556
Magic Conversion!

1327
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:50,101
Turn the ice into water!

1328
01:34:51,102 --> 01:34:52,436
Yeah, here we go!

1329
01:34:54,271 --> 01:34:56,816
Fate Manipulation:
Absolute Evasion!

1330
01:34:56,899 --> 01:35:00,027
Spatial Magic:
Fallen Angel's Wingbeat!

1331
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:02,071
Let's surpass…

1332
01:35:02,154 --> 01:35:03,197
…our limits!

1333
01:35:07,034 --> 01:35:09,537
Jeez. Just go already!

1334
01:35:10,037 --> 01:35:13,290
Leave it to me!

1335
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:21,549
This kingdom can get better.
We’re not fated to stay as we are now.

1336
01:35:22,925 --> 01:35:26,011
We will not let you
take that chance away from us!

1337
01:35:26,595 --> 01:35:27,722
Hear me?!

1338
01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:29,807
It’s our world.

1339
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:33,144
And we’ll change it……not you!

1340
01:35:49,201 --> 01:35:50,786
Do you give up?

1341
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,788
Because I’m not finished yet.

1342
01:35:52,872 --> 01:35:54,874
I can do this all day if you like.

1343
01:35:56,333 --> 01:35:58,085
-However…
-Hmm?

1344
01:36:00,796 --> 01:36:04,008
A better choice would be to work together.

1345
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:06,927
I don’t mean to brag.

1346
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:09,722
I can’t do anything
without the help of my friends.

1347
01:36:10,848 --> 01:36:13,809
I nearly died a bunch of times,
but with them at my side,

1348
01:36:13,893 --> 01:36:16,604
I’ve been able to come
further than I thought possible!

1349
01:36:16,687 --> 01:36:18,898
Stop talking!

1350
01:36:21,901 --> 01:36:25,237
I wanna world
of acceptance and happiness,

1351
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:28,282
where people are glad
to wake up and start a new day!

1352
01:36:29,116 --> 01:36:32,787
You don't make something like that
by killing a bunch of people!

1353
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:36,207
No one will accept your world
if that's the price!

1354
01:37:06,403 --> 01:37:08,572
Tell me. What’s your name?

1355
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:11,075
It’s Noelle. Noelle Silva.

1356
01:37:11,158 --> 01:37:14,370
A noble? Yes, of course.

1357
01:37:14,453 --> 01:37:15,371
I see now.

1358
01:37:16,580 --> 01:37:18,791
You're a good girl, Noelle.

1359
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:23,003
You're a royal,
and yet you can empathize with the weak.

1360
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:28,217
If a person like you exists in this era,
there is still hope.

1361
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:32,596
C'mon, now of all times?

1362
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:36,350
You gotta be kidding me. What a joke.

1363
01:37:37,142 --> 01:37:40,855
Well, I, for one,
can still keep fighting.

1364
01:37:42,231 --> 01:37:44,108
For many more rounds, I bet.

1365
01:37:45,067 --> 01:37:47,903
But unfortunately, it’s my turn to sleep.

1366
01:37:48,737 --> 01:37:51,740
I had an excellent time though.

1367
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:57,705
I did it.

1368
01:37:58,205 --> 01:38:00,082
I took him out, everyone!

1369
01:38:02,251 --> 01:38:05,004
I am not finished!

1370
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:07,756
No. Not yet.

1371
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:12,636
This is a forbidden spell.

1372
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:16,015
One activated in exchange for my life!

1373
01:38:17,516 --> 01:38:19,268
Doom’s Gate!

1374
01:38:25,107 --> 01:38:26,400
Argh!

1375
01:38:28,652 --> 01:38:30,237
One more chance.

1376
01:38:30,321 --> 01:38:34,241
I will not give up
on achieving my goal, Asta!

1377
01:38:48,255 --> 01:38:52,426
That’s fine.
'Cause I’m not done yet either.

1378
01:38:53,677 --> 01:38:54,970
I’m gonna be

1379
01:38:55,512 --> 01:38:56,430
the Wizard King.

1380
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:58,933
So I’ll keep standing.

1381
01:38:59,016 --> 01:39:00,643
No matter what.

1382
01:39:03,103 --> 01:39:04,438
Just watch me!

1383
01:39:05,272 --> 01:39:07,274
Come on!

1384
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:09,026
Let’s finish this!

1385
01:39:09,526 --> 01:39:10,861
Asta!

1386
01:39:17,034 --> 01:39:18,869
I've got something for you.

1387
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:22,247
What do you mean?

1388
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:25,709
You won't need an explanation.

1389
01:39:25,793 --> 01:39:27,711
That sword will lead the way.

1390
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:30,965
-The future of this nation…
-This magic…

1391
01:39:31,674 --> 01:39:32,841
…lies with you.

1392
01:39:38,305 --> 01:39:39,181
I feel it.

1393
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:42,643
This power is coming from everyone!

1394
01:39:43,268 --> 01:39:45,437
It's their hopes and dreams.

1395
01:39:49,733 --> 01:39:53,070
I feel your spirits flowing through me!

1396
01:39:54,822 --> 01:39:57,741
Stop, Master Nacht! What are you doing?

1397
01:39:58,409 --> 01:39:59,660
You've gotta slow down.

1398
01:39:59,743 --> 01:40:03,247
You’ve worked yourself ragged
since you got back to the Clover Kingdom.

1399
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:07,918
If you give up any more magical power,
you're gonna pass out for sure!

1400
01:40:08,002 --> 01:40:10,879
A nice long nap
doesn’t sound like the worst idea.

1401
01:40:11,672 --> 01:40:15,801
Especially if it means someone who’s doing
a good thing gets rewarded.

1402
01:40:19,013 --> 01:40:19,972
Right here.

1403
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:22,016
Right now.

1404
01:40:22,599 --> 01:40:23,851
Everyone.

1405
01:40:27,104 --> 01:40:30,524
We'll all surpass our limits.

1406
01:40:34,361 --> 01:40:35,779
The Imperial Sword?

1407
01:40:36,572 --> 01:40:39,033
What good do you think that will do you?

1408
01:40:42,119 --> 01:40:44,038
Asta. Do it.

1409
01:41:01,638 --> 01:41:04,266
I will stop you!

1410
01:41:14,693 --> 01:41:15,819
Come on!

1411
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:18,822
Why are you so hell-bent on destruction?

1412
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:20,866
I see things as they are.

1413
01:41:20,949 --> 01:41:22,326
This country must burn!

1414
01:41:23,118 --> 01:41:25,579
The nation is rotten to the core!

1415
01:41:25,662 --> 01:41:29,249
Its very foundation
must be razed and rebuilt anew!

1416
01:41:29,333 --> 01:41:32,461
Stand aside! I have to save everyone!

1417
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:34,088
I'm back

1418
01:41:34,171 --> 01:41:39,384
Who exactly do you mean by "everyone"?
Those you deem worthy?

1419
01:41:39,468 --> 01:41:42,679
No! Those who are oppressed
and without hope in their lives.

1420
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:45,516
For their sake, I will create--

1421
01:41:57,528 --> 01:41:58,612
I…

1422
01:42:00,155 --> 01:42:01,865
I… will…

1423
01:42:04,952 --> 01:42:07,955
Even if you’re a peasant
and don’t have magical power,

1424
01:42:08,038 --> 01:42:11,375
you can still be
the strongest person in the world.

1425
01:42:11,458 --> 01:42:13,794
You can be everyone’s hope.

1426
01:42:14,711 --> 01:42:17,548
You’ll see. I’ll prove it to you, Conrad!

1427
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:22,845
One day…

1428
01:42:22,928 --> 01:42:25,514
…I’ll be the Wizard King!

1429
01:42:51,540 --> 01:42:52,958
Did that boy

1430
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:55,043
just defeat me?

1431
01:42:56,753 --> 01:42:58,255
How strange.

1432
01:42:59,506 --> 01:43:00,632
If that’s the case,

1433
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:02,676
why do I feel so at ease?

1434
01:43:05,929 --> 01:43:07,389
Ah.

1435
01:43:08,432 --> 01:43:10,058
Now it’s making sense.

1436
01:43:11,226 --> 01:43:14,605
Asta. Become the Wizard King.

1437
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:19,443
And then share the warm world
you hold in your heart

1438
01:43:19,526 --> 01:43:21,361
with every citizen in this nation.

1439
01:43:22,321 --> 01:43:24,531
Your magic is 'never giving up.'

1440
01:43:25,407 --> 01:43:26,617
So I know you can do it.

1441
01:43:28,702 --> 01:43:31,371
You are here too?

1442
01:43:42,925 --> 01:43:44,176
I see.

1443
01:44:07,532 --> 01:44:10,035
Conrad used to be
cheerful and honest.

1444
01:44:10,118 --> 01:44:12,913
When he saw people struggling,
he empathized with them.

1445
01:44:13,705 --> 01:44:14,998
Everyone loved him.

1446
01:44:15,082 --> 01:44:16,917
He was strong and kind.

1447
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,502
A man not unlike Asta.

1448
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:22,047
But he was framed by the royalists.

1449
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:25,425
His wife and his comrades
were slaughtered as a result, and after…

1450
01:44:26,176 --> 01:44:27,886
he was never the same again.

1451
01:44:30,055 --> 01:44:32,933
Asta, thank you for stopping him.

1452
01:44:34,476 --> 01:44:35,727
I’m confused.

1453
01:44:35,811 --> 01:44:38,981
Why was I able to tap into
the Imperial Sword there at the end?

1454
01:44:39,064 --> 01:44:39,940
What do you mean?

1455
01:44:40,524 --> 01:44:43,527
When we were fighting,
I hit him with my Demon-Slayer Sword.

1456
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:46,154
Its magic must have been neutralized.

1457
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:48,240
So what happened?

1458
01:44:50,158 --> 01:44:52,119
Ah, that’s simple.

1459
01:44:56,248 --> 01:44:58,500
Generations of Wizard Kings.

1460
01:45:01,378 --> 01:45:03,255
They watch these events unfold,

1461
01:45:03,338 --> 01:45:05,632
and they lent
their miraculous power to you.

1462
01:45:05,716 --> 01:45:08,969
Whoa! That’s, like,
the coolest thing I’ve ever heard!

1463
01:45:09,052 --> 01:45:11,388
Oh, calm down.
He’s just teasing you, dummy.

1464
01:45:11,471 --> 01:45:12,764
No, it’s true. I swear!

1465
01:45:12,848 --> 01:45:15,058
Rest assured, predecessors,

1466
01:45:15,142 --> 01:45:19,396
the clovers who will carry this kingdom
into the future, are growing up nicely.

1467
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:21,398
Are you mocking Prince Lumiere?

1468
01:45:21,481 --> 01:45:25,319
What do you think, Asta?
Aren’t Wizard Kings incredible?

1469
01:45:25,402 --> 01:45:26,445
Yes, sir!

1470
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:29,531
And one day,
I’ll be an incredible person too.

1471
01:45:29,614 --> 01:45:32,284
When I’m the Wizard King!

1472
01:49:30,939 --> 01:49:33,149
What a surprise, I caught you slacking.

1473
01:49:33,233 --> 01:49:35,277
Do you have any idea how hard I fought?!

1474
01:49:37,028 --> 01:49:37,862
Mmm?

1475
01:49:39,239 --> 01:49:40,574
The place was in shambles,

1476
01:49:40,657 --> 01:49:43,577
but it looks like it’ll get rebuilt
faster than I expected.

1477
01:49:44,244 --> 01:49:45,287
Yeah.

1478
01:49:50,083 --> 01:49:50,959
Conrad.

1479
01:49:51,501 --> 01:49:52,961
He was a Wizard King.

1480
01:49:54,796 --> 01:49:55,797
-Ouch!
-Mm-hmm.

1481
01:49:56,506 --> 01:49:57,757
Forget about him.

1482
01:49:59,217 --> 01:50:01,553
Good call.

1483
01:50:01,636 --> 01:50:04,306
I'll be a proper Wizard King,
so it's fine.

1484
01:50:04,389 --> 01:50:07,309
Not so fast! We both know
I'll be the one calling the shots--

1485
01:50:07,392 --> 01:50:09,811
-Can't hear you.
-Don't ignore me!

1486
01:50:09,894 --> 01:50:13,148
You wanna go? Let's do it!
The Triumph may have been canceled,

1487
01:50:13,231 --> 01:50:16,818
but I can still beat you in a one-on-one
match to prove I'm strongest.

1488
01:50:18,194 --> 01:50:19,321
Not a chance.

1489
01:50:26,911 --> 01:50:30,081
I'm going to be the Wizard King!
