1
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:30,088
Well, we've come a long way, Walt.

2
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:31,847
Here at the end of round one

3
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:34,301
I'm gonna recommend cautious optimism.

4
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:37,762
We'll check back in two months,
see how you've responded

5
00:02:37,846 --> 00:02:40,682
reassess and decide our next move,
if any.

6
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:43,643
That's right around the time
the baby's due, correct?

7
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:46,688
Yeah.

8
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:48,940
Well, try to think of this
as good timing.

9
00:02:49,024 --> 00:02:51,624
You'll start feeling better soon,
more like yourself.

10
00:02:51,777 --> 00:02:53,777
And your hair should start to come back.

11
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,366
Kind of gotten used
to the old cue-ball look.

12
00:02:58,575 --> 00:03:02,913
- I prefer to think of it as streamlined.
- Right. Aerodynamic.

13
00:03:03,121 --> 00:03:07,501
So no more confusion?

14
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:12,214
- No more...?
- No. No. Absolutely none.

15
00:03:13,381 --> 00:03:14,841
How are you two holding up?

16
00:03:17,135 --> 00:03:18,136
Fine.

17
00:03:18,345 --> 00:03:21,473
I mean, you know, we're busy,

18
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:24,351
but we're good. Absolutely.

19
00:03:25,894 --> 00:03:27,354
It's all good.

20
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:35,320
So we're not going through an insurer.
Is that correct?

21
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:37,406
Yes. Direct bill.

22
00:03:37,614 --> 00:03:40,075
Just need to print it out for you.

23
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:08,103
Thank you.

24
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:20,282
I thought we had discussed
a cash discount.

25
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,118
Absolutely. It's included.

26
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:26,121
Just a reminder.

27
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:30,083
We do have a payment plan available,
should you be interested.

28
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:32,586
Oh, yeah.

29
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:34,296
Okay.

30
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:38,300
Congratulations.

31
00:04:39,676 --> 00:04:41,303
Thank you.

32
00:04:54,316 --> 00:04:56,116
Okay, well, then what about the MRI?

33
00:04:56,318 --> 00:04:58,368
Can you...?
Can you please explain to me

34
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,783
the distinction between
diagnostic and exploratory?

35
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:09,164
Yeah, but either way,
his doctor ordered it.

36
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:14,002
Okay, you know, it should be covered.

37
00:05:14,753 --> 00:05:17,005
You bet I will. Yeah, in triplicate.

38
00:05:17,214 --> 00:05:21,676
Okay. Well, I'm sorry
you couldn't be of more help too.

39
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:23,887
Yeah. Okay.

40
00:05:25,222 --> 00:05:26,681
Bitch.

41
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:28,558
Hi.

42
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:33,188
Been around someone who smokes?

43
00:05:33,397 --> 00:05:34,648
No.

44
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:36,858
The hospital bill came.

45
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:39,027
- That was fast.
- Yeah.

46
00:05:39,236 --> 00:05:43,323
Three-day stay, 13,000 and counting.

47
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:54,292
Is this something that
Gretchen and Elliott might cover?

48
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:57,212
I mean

49
00:05:57,421 --> 00:06:01,550
I know it's strictly your domain, but...

50
00:06:01,758 --> 00:06:03,844
They will. I'm sure they will.

51
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:05,679
I'll handle it.

52
00:08:00,377 --> 00:08:02,504
Oh, God.

53
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:47,591
Bring me up to speed on Tuco Salamanca.

54
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,842
- Dead.
- Still?

55
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,261
- Completely.
- Okay, then.

56
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,014
- Well, thanks for stopping by.
- Okay.

57
00:08:55,932 --> 00:08:59,310
So things are quiet, you know.
Not a lot of crystal on the streets now.

58
00:08:59,394 --> 00:09:01,730
- Good.
- Of course, that's not gonna last.

59
00:09:01,938 --> 00:09:05,024
Wait to see who rallies the roaches
now that turf's up for grabs.

60
00:09:05,108 --> 00:09:06,526
No takers so far?

61
00:09:06,735 --> 00:09:10,072
Well, we keep hearing a name.
Heisenberg.

62
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,824
Lately pretty much every dime-bagger
we come across.

63
00:09:12,908 --> 00:09:15,202
- Heisenberg?
- Yeah, I know.

64
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,080
Maybe it's a tweaker urban legend.

65
00:09:18,288 --> 00:09:22,417
Still, somebody somewhere is cooking
that big blue we keep finding.

66
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:25,087
Anyway, we'll stay on it.

67
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:29,674
Know why sharks are at the top
of the food chain, Hank?

68
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:36,264
Because they have three sets of teeth
and will take a bite out of anything?

69
00:09:36,473 --> 00:09:38,975
Some of those suckers
travel thousands of miles

70
00:09:39,184 --> 00:09:41,269
in pursuit of their prey.

71
00:09:41,478 --> 00:09:43,438
Yeah, I think I heard that.

72
00:09:44,981 --> 00:09:47,609
You, my friend, are a great white.

73
00:09:48,902 --> 00:09:50,737
How does Albuquerque liaison

74
00:09:50,946 --> 00:09:54,282
Tri-State Border Interdiction
Task Force sound?

75
00:09:55,242 --> 00:09:56,692
Like one hell of a promotion.

76
00:09:56,827 --> 00:10:00,497
As of the 1st, I want you to split
your time between here and El Paso.

77
00:10:00,705 --> 00:10:03,125
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

78
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:05,467
What you gonna do without me, Gomey?

79
00:10:05,585 --> 00:10:09,172
Celebrate. I won't have to look
at your ugly mug six days a week.

80
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:12,175
Hey, buddy,
I am the brains and the brawn.

81
00:10:12,384 --> 00:10:14,927
- I'm the whole package.
- I'm glad I didn't just eat.

82
00:10:15,011 --> 00:10:17,561
I'm surprised your head still fits
through the door.

83
00:10:17,681 --> 00:10:20,475
- You wanna grab lunch?
- Hell, yeah. Because you're buying.

84
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,311
Done.
I'll meet you morons downstairs.

85
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,480
Try not to get lost on the way.

86
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:27,691
Schrader.

87
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,025
Yeah. Hey, Ricky.

88
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:31,862
How you doing?
Yeah, I'm stoked too.

89
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,739
Yeah, El Paso.

90
00:10:36,032 --> 00:10:37,284
Here's the man.

91
00:10:39,995 --> 00:10:42,497
- Hey, congratulations, Hank.
- Thanks.

92
00:11:41,678 --> 00:11:45,849
Gets two in the sand,
two in the forest, you know?

93
00:11:46,057 --> 00:11:49,352
And then he says,
"Give me a four," you know?

94
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:51,188
Hey. Hey.

95
00:12:23,553 --> 00:12:27,015
- Hey.
- Got some nerve coming back here.

96
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:29,142
Or you're even dumber than I thought.

97
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:31,478
Yeah, well, maybe both.

98
00:12:39,653 --> 00:12:42,656
Balance for the tow, the repairs,

99
00:12:42,864 --> 00:12:47,661
and extra for damages and stuff, the gate

100
00:12:47,869 --> 00:12:50,664
the toilet.

101
00:12:52,165 --> 00:12:54,209
Look, like I said

102
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:57,295
my word is my bond.

103
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:14,813
What would you charge me
to store this here?

104
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:17,941
- A million-five.
- Come on, yo.

105
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,360
- Your sister.
- Dog, I'm serious, all right?

106
00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:25,198
I got storage needs.
And I got scratch up front.

107
00:13:25,407 --> 00:13:27,826
We could, you know, negotiate.

108
00:13:33,123 --> 00:13:34,332
Five hundred.

109
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,834
- A month?
- A week.

110
00:13:38,336 --> 00:13:39,796
For real?

111
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:41,631
- See you.
- Wait, wait, wait.

112
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,050
Just hold on. Just chill.

113
00:13:45,886 --> 00:13:48,764
Okay. Sounds good. Totally doable.

114
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:51,057
- Outside.
- Inside.

115
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:52,893
- Forget it.
- Man, come on.

116
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:56,146
Your fence is too easy to climb.

117
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:58,899
Inside, padlocked, plus gate privileges.

118
00:13:59,107 --> 00:14:03,069
- Come again?
- Gate, in and out, privileges.

119
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:07,991
Month to month. Cash up front.
Inside.

120
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,744
And I don't know you.
I don't know jack.

121
00:14:10,952 --> 00:14:12,245
Yeah.

122
00:14:24,716 --> 00:14:26,885
You selling?

123
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:29,012
I'll let you take it for nine Gs.

124
00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:38,897
What about that one?

125
00:14:42,818 --> 00:14:44,361
Serious?

126
00:15:06,007 --> 00:15:08,718
It's Jane, right?

127
00:15:08,927 --> 00:15:12,389
Well, Jane, I gotta say,
this place is awesome.

128
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:16,601
- Really? Does it inspire awe?
- No. I mean, you know, it's great.

129
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,354
Just what I've been looking for.
That's what I meant.

130
00:15:19,438 --> 00:15:22,315
I had an entire house before,
detached and all,

131
00:15:22,524 --> 00:15:26,862
but I was just tired of the lawn care,
upkeep and whatnot. You know?

132
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,073
Well, the blinds are new.
Everything's been painted.

133
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,993
Jesus.

134
00:15:35,245 --> 00:15:37,622
Utilities are included.

135
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:39,624
Stacking. Sweet.

136
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,583
- You got cable?
- Already wired. Just call to activate.

137
00:15:42,752 --> 00:15:44,379
High speed, whatever.

138
00:15:44,588 --> 00:15:47,257
Bathroom, cool tile.

139
00:15:47,632 --> 00:15:49,301
Bedroom.

140
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:50,635
Nice.

141
00:15:50,844 --> 00:15:54,014
I'm a fan of the hardwood.

142
00:15:55,223 --> 00:15:58,477
- So you're interested?
- Definitely. Definitely, yeah.

143
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:00,645
And you're good with NP, NS?

144
00:16:03,315 --> 00:16:04,399
Sorry. What?

145
00:16:04,608 --> 00:16:07,902
In the ad? No smoking, no pets.
You wanna smoke, you do it outside.

146
00:16:07,986 --> 00:16:10,906
No. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.
It's cool. No worries.

147
00:16:11,114 --> 00:16:15,214
All right, the usual drill. I'll need a
W-2 or recent pay stub, current employer

148
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,996
former address, you know,
the yadda yadda.

149
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:21,875
And if it's all copacetic, I'll call.

150
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:25,712
Yeah. Look

151
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:27,380
the thing is

152
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:29,216
I can...

153
00:16:29,424 --> 00:16:30,884
Unbelievable.

154
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:34,743
- I'm just currently between situations.
- Then I'm currently not renting.

155
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,558
Look, look, I got the money and
I'm totally good for it for, like, ever.

156
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:42,229
Come on, yo, can you please,
please just help a brother out?

157
00:16:42,437 --> 00:16:45,087
Yo, my dad's not really
a make-exceptions kind of guy.

158
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:47,400
- Trust me.
- Your dad?

159
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:50,403
Owns the place. I manage it.

160
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:52,823
Pen on paper. That's what I need.

161
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:54,781
Or go run your game somewhere else.

162
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,160
Dude, I got nowhere else to go.
This is it.

163
00:16:57,369 --> 00:16:59,746
And I got no game, all right?

164
00:16:59,955 --> 00:17:02,582
I just need a chance.

165
00:17:05,794 --> 00:17:09,214
Look, my folks, they kicked me out.

166
00:17:09,422 --> 00:17:12,384
I'm a disappointment, apparently.

167
00:17:12,592 --> 00:17:15,470
Didn't meet their expectations again.

168
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,473
So you know, now
I'm persona non gratis or whatever.

169
00:17:18,682 --> 00:17:22,811
But you know what?
I'm a good person and I work hard.

170
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:25,563
I will pay you every month
and I will pay you on time.

171
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:28,608
I will not mess this up, okay?
I swear.

172
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:38,785
Rent just went up.

173
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:41,788
A hundred more a month.
That's the cash price.

174
00:17:41,997 --> 00:17:43,540
Yes.

175
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,792
Okay. Yes.

176
00:17:46,001 --> 00:17:48,836
Hey, you rock. Thank you.
Thank you. You won't regret this.

177
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,756
And in addition to first and last,
I want two more months.

178
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,301
DBAA fee, non-refundable.

179
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:59,055
Yeah, of course. No problem.
DBAA. Obviously, yeah.

180
00:18:01,016 --> 00:18:04,978
All right. So, what's DBAA?

181
00:18:05,187 --> 00:18:07,522
- Don't be an asshole.
- Gotcha.

182
00:18:07,731 --> 00:18:10,275
- I live next door.
- Really?

183
00:18:10,484 --> 00:18:13,945
Don't think for one second you have
squatter's rights, because you don't.

184
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:15,697
If you blow this, I want you gone.

185
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:18,991
I know guys that'll have your skinny
ass out back by the Dumpster

186
00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:20,525
faster than you can blink.

187
00:18:22,996 --> 00:18:24,998
I'll fill it in. Just sign your name.

188
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:26,507
Which is what, by the way?

189
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,002
It's Jesse.

190
00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:33,006
Jesse Jackson.

191
00:18:34,174 --> 00:18:35,175
Seriously?

192
00:18:36,885 --> 00:18:38,053
What?

193
00:19:27,102 --> 00:19:29,812
- What are you doing?
- Beating off. What's it look like?

194
00:19:29,896 --> 00:19:33,358
That is in fact exactly
what it looks like to me.

195
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:36,778
Brewing is an art form, Marie.
I think you'd appreciate that by now.

196
00:19:36,862 --> 00:19:39,865
Christmas, batch of '06? Come on.

197
00:19:40,073 --> 00:19:42,242
So let me get this straight.

198
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:47,038
You call in sick the day after
receiving a long-awaited

199
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:49,583
career-boosting promotion,

200
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:54,087
so you can play Oktoberfest
in your man cave?

201
00:19:54,963 --> 00:19:56,673
I don't get it. Really, I don't.

202
00:19:56,882 --> 00:19:58,842
Babe, relax.

203
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:02,387
- Please, don't tell me to relax.
- Sorry, I forgot.

204
00:20:02,596 --> 00:20:04,598
- You know I hate that.
- Right.

205
00:20:04,806 --> 00:20:06,558
Dave said I should express that.

206
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:09,478
All I'm saying is everything's fine.

207
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:12,022
I can take a day.

208
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,940
No big deal.

209
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:20,155
Now get that sweet ass out of here
so I can concentrate.

210
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:09,723
<i>Okay, so, what's the plan?</i>

211
00:22:09,931 --> 00:22:12,225
The plan is we cook.

212
00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:16,855
Why are we cooking when we can't
even move what we cook?

213
00:22:26,865 --> 00:22:29,465
Well, how much do you think
you can sell on your own?

214
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:32,370
Say if I cook during the days
and you work the nights.

215
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:34,372
- Dude.
- What?

216
00:22:35,123 --> 00:22:37,417
Prior to Tuco,
that was your plan, wasn't it?

217
00:22:37,626 --> 00:22:41,046
I understand it'll be a fraction
of what we brought in before,

218
00:22:41,254 --> 00:22:44,590
- but still, what choice do we have?
- First of all, there's no we.

219
00:22:44,674 --> 00:22:48,762
Okay? You're talking me, solo,
busting hump slinging shards.

220
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,180
I got profile now.

221
00:22:50,388 --> 00:22:53,600
Don't you get that?
DEA's up my ass.

222
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:57,187
No, I'm not exposing myself
to that level of risk for chump change.

223
00:22:57,395 --> 00:22:59,940
- No way.
- Then what do you suggest?

224
00:23:00,148 --> 00:23:05,028
I don't think either of us are eager
to jump into bed with another Tuco.

225
00:23:09,825 --> 00:23:12,452
I got bills, man.

226
00:23:12,661 --> 00:23:13,954
You've got bills?

227
00:23:14,162 --> 00:23:15,997
Rent, yo. Responsibilities.

228
00:23:16,206 --> 00:23:18,124
I've already lost more than I've made,

229
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,877
and I am tired
of dicking around out here.

230
00:23:21,086 --> 00:23:24,131
You wanna know how much I've got left?

231
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:26,549
After completing
my first round of treatment,

232
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:30,137
and financing
the world's most expensive alibi?

233
00:23:30,345 --> 00:23:32,305
Zero. Zip. Nothing.

234
00:23:32,514 --> 00:23:35,725
I've got nothing to show for all of this.
Nothing for my family

235
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:39,229
which, as you might remember,
was the whole damn point.

236
00:23:42,983 --> 00:23:46,736
But seeing as throwing in the towel
is not an option

237
00:23:46,945 --> 00:23:49,990
that leaves us with a total
of two choices.

238
00:23:50,198 --> 00:23:53,243
We go into business
with yet another homicidal lunatic,

239
00:23:53,452 --> 00:23:55,495
or you and I start...

240
00:23:55,704 --> 00:23:59,458
You selling whatever you can.

241
00:24:02,544 --> 00:24:04,463
There's a third way.

242
00:24:06,047 --> 00:24:07,841
And what would that be?

243
00:24:09,718 --> 00:24:12,763
We got to be Tuco.

244
00:24:12,971 --> 00:24:15,471
All right? Cut out the middleman.
Run our own game.

245
00:24:15,557 --> 00:24:19,394
So you're going to what?

246
00:24:19,603 --> 00:24:21,772
Snort meth off a bowie knife?

247
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:25,025
You gonna beat your homeys to death
when they "dis" you?

248
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:29,780
Look, I know some guys.
All right? I can create a network.

249
00:24:29,988 --> 00:24:33,867
Look, we control production
and distribution.

250
00:24:34,075 --> 00:24:37,412
That way, we stay off the front lines
while moving some serious glass.

251
00:24:37,496 --> 00:24:40,540
I mean, the point here is
to make money, right?

252
00:24:40,749 --> 00:24:42,042
Sky-high stacks.

253
00:24:44,085 --> 00:24:45,879
- No.
- No? That's not the point?

254
00:24:46,088 --> 00:24:48,673
No, I am not willing to do that.

255
00:24:49,591 --> 00:24:51,510
Who said anything about you?

256
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:56,681
I don't vote for this plan.

257
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:01,061
I'm not comfortable bringing in
unknown entities into our operation.

258
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:03,814
Yeah? Well, you don't get to vote.

259
00:25:06,441 --> 00:25:08,568
I beg your pardon?

260
00:25:08,777 --> 00:25:12,572
- This is a partnership, remember?
- I rem... Oh, I remember.

261
00:25:12,781 --> 00:25:14,908
Yeah, you cook, I sell.

262
00:25:15,117 --> 00:25:18,411
That was the division of labour
when we started all this.

263
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,870
And that's exactly
how we should have kept it.

264
00:25:20,997 --> 00:25:23,958
Because I sure as hell didn't
find myself locked in a trunk,

265
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:26,253
or on my knees with a gun to my head

266
00:25:26,461 --> 00:25:29,423
before your greedy old ass
came along. All right?

267
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:39,766
All right, I will admit
to a bit of a learning curve.

268
00:25:40,308 --> 00:25:42,894
And perhaps I was overly ambitious.

269
00:25:43,728 --> 00:25:46,272
In any case, it's not gonna happen
that way anymore.

270
00:25:46,356 --> 00:25:48,024
Yeah, damn straight.

271
00:25:48,233 --> 00:25:50,235
Know why?

272
00:25:50,444 --> 00:25:53,238
Because we do things my way this time,

273
00:25:53,447 --> 00:25:55,282
or I walk.

274
00:25:58,785 --> 00:26:03,123
You need me more than I need you, Walt.

275
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,834
<i>Yo, enter my casa.
Yo, Skinny Pete. What's up, brother?</i>

276
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:26,044
What up with it, yo?

277
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:29,506
Hey, Combo. Good to see you.
Welcome to my humble abode.

278
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:32,467
Good deal, mover. Good deal.

279
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:37,680
- Yo, Badge, hey.
- Cool crib, man.

280
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:39,516
Hey, it echoes.

281
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:41,351
Hello.

282
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,520
Hello. Hello, hello, hello.

283
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:45,563
Let me give you the virtual tour, okay?

284
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:48,191
So plasma is gonna go right here.

285
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,568
Probably like 50-inch,
you know, wall-mounted.

286
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,862
Plasma rocks it over LCD, yo.

287
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,739
No. They burn in, yo.

288
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:58,076
But the picture's, like, way sharper.
Blacks are deeper too.

289
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,870
They got 3-D coming out,
like, any day now.

290
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,747
That's what I'm waiting for.

291
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:05,166
- Porn, coz. You know?
- Jesus.

292
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:07,877
Like 3-D tatas, like right in your face.

293
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:11,088
Yeah. So, I'm gonna get a couple
of those zero-gravity chairs,

294
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:14,122
for, like, right here,
for your ultimate viewing comfort.

295
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:15,343
Those are buck.

296
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:18,555
It's gonna be pretty much sparse.
Very Asiany, modern stuff.

297
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:20,890
- Feng shui, yo. I can dig it.
- Yeah.

298
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:23,434
I'm thinking, you know,
just a bunch of candles

299
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:26,062
maybe one of those
little fountain jobs right here.

300
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:27,996
- It's gonna be chill.
- The ladies

301
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:31,901
they cream up real nice for,
like, candles and shit.

302
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:35,238
You are going to score, big time.

303
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:39,909
All right, so how about we get,
you know, down to it?

304
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:43,246
There's some refreshments over here
if you wanna partake.

305
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:47,083
You got any other refreshments?

306
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:50,170
- I could kick it. It's been a while.
- Yes, yes.

307
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:52,797
I could totally go for a loving spoonful.

308
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:55,383
No, no, no.
No bomb, no beer, no weed. All right?

309
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:59,095
You smoke it up on your own time.
We're talking business here.

310
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:01,931
Okay? So listen up.

311
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,810
This is how it goes.
I front each of you an ounce.

312
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:09,939
You sell it for 2,500.
I keep the two, you keep the five.

313
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:12,901
No cutting it.
You sell it as is, all right?

314
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:15,570
Twenty-five hundred an ounce?

315
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:17,280
That's kind of hopeful, bro.

316
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:20,950
- Yeah, Jesse, street's maybe 17, 18.
- Seventeen.

317
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:24,871
Okay, A, this is the best shiz ever.

318
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:28,624
All right? Everybody and their mother's
gonna want a taste. And second

319
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,794
who else is selling right now, huh?

320
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:34,047
- It's dry out there, that's for sure.
- Church.

321
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:37,605
So you point it how you want, okay?
Quarter, half, teener, whatever.

322
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:40,887
But I make what I make.
Two large. No exceptions.

323
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:43,306
Short me, you're out.

324
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:45,099
Cut it, you're out.

325
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:46,935
Period.

326
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:51,064
This is a big opportunity
I am giving you.

327
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:52,816
Understand?

328
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:55,652
Badger, what is this?

329
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:59,447
A big opportunity.

330
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:03,118
Exactly. All right?
This is the ground floor.

331
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:06,830
Gentlemen, how far you go is up to you.

332
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:08,498
So bring out the product, yo.

333
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:11,459
No, no, no. Not here, all right?
Not ever.

334
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:15,630
Blind drop. I will let you know
when and where.

335
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:21,469
All right?
So you'll be hearing from me.

336
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:23,471
Now, I got mad volume.

337
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,350
So you move it quick, you move it right

338
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:30,687
there is always more.

339
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:35,400
Okay, DBAA, mofos. All right?

340
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:37,819
Apply yourselves.

341
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:39,112
Hell, yeah.

342
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:41,322
Hell, yeah.

343
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:14,813
Hey, there's the big guy.

344
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:17,233
- Congratulations, Uncle Hank.
- Hey, Hank.

345
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:18,610
It's an armpit.

346
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:20,570
It's not an armpit.

347
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:22,405
Oh, excuse me.

348
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:25,158
You're right.
It's the Paris of the Southwest.

349
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:27,744
Please, it's Texas, for God's sake.

350
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:31,331
Right on the border
of lawless Mexican hell.

351
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,625
Human heads, they leave.

352
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:37,921
The cartels, they litter the place
with human heads.

353
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:40,629
Yeah, well, pretty sure
that's why I'm going there.

354
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:45,345
It's like a calling card
or a shoutout or something.

355
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:48,431
Now, D.C., on the other hand,
I could get behind.

356
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,267
You just do your time like a good boy,

357
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:54,476
and I could see us
in a cute little condo in Georgetown

358
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:56,397
in a couple of years.

359
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:16,668
I went online to this fantastic

360
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:19,796
real estate website for D.C.

361
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:24,801
There's just so much,
I don't know, culture there.

362
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:27,178
I was talking to Melinda,
Hank's boss's wife.

363
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:30,431
I told you about the one with
helmet hair and permanent lip liner.

364
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:33,015
Anyway, she was saying that
when they were there...

365
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:40,108
Apologise.

366
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:43,862
What?

367
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:50,535
I will not listen to one more word
until you apologise.

368
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,332
- For?
- You know perfectly well, Marie.

369
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:59,544
- Well, obviously I don't...
- Your lies.

370
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,337
To me.

371
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,883
The shoplifting.

372
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:06,676
All of it.

373
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:11,347
Did you really think it was all just
neatly gonna go away?

374
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:14,642
Well, if you hadn't tried to return it...

375
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:16,686
Apologise.

376
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:22,192
Now or never. I mean it.

377
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,861
Or it'll never be the same.

378
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:30,658
Why are you punishing me?

379
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:37,957
If you don't respect me enough to
apologise, to tell me the truth, then...

380
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:48,885
I need my sister back.

381
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:04,567
I'm sorry.

382
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:09,906
I'm sorry.

383
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:24,087
- What, do you want the gory details?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

384
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:26,089
No, you don't.

385
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:28,174
Keep you up at night.

386
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:34,055
So was it scary?

387
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:36,808
Hell, yeah, it was freaking scary,
you little punk.

388
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:38,059
Jesus.

389
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:41,146
But you were way faster than him.

390
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:43,731
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

391
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:46,651
Yeah. Hell, yeah.

392
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,194
Kick ass and take names.

393
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:51,197
- Son.
- No, it's fine.

394
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:54,242
You know what it is?

395
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:58,121
A cockroach comes out
from under a fridge, what do you do?

396
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:00,248
I mean, you don't think about it.

397
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:03,126
You stomp them down.

398
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:06,296
Where do they come from?

399
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:10,383
Criminals, like the one you...

400
00:34:10,592 --> 00:34:14,304
I mean, what do you think it is
that makes them who they are?

401
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:18,975
Buddy, you might as well be
asking me about the roaches.

402
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:24,397
All I know is there's a whole world
of them out there.

403
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,986
Man, I gotta piss like a racehorse.

404
00:36:41,922 --> 00:36:42,923
Cops.

405
00:36:43,423 --> 00:36:45,217
Cops!

406
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:45,277
Wasn't sure it was you.

407
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,529
New car?

408
00:37:47,737 --> 00:37:51,533
Yeah, keeping things on the DL.

409
00:37:51,741 --> 00:37:54,870
I'm guessing this one doesn't bounce.

410
00:38:02,085 --> 00:38:04,004
Your half.

411
00:38:04,212 --> 00:38:06,673
Fifteen K.
That's what I'm talking about.

412
00:38:10,385 --> 00:38:11,928
You're welcome.

413
00:38:12,137 --> 00:38:13,180
Jesus.

414
00:38:15,724 --> 00:38:17,851
Help me understand the math, okay?

415
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:19,936
I gave you 1 pound, correct?

416
00:38:20,145 --> 00:38:23,064
You and I split $2,000 per ounce.

417
00:38:23,273 --> 00:38:25,066
$1,000 each.

418
00:38:25,275 --> 00:38:27,194
One pound, that's 16 ounces.

419
00:38:27,402 --> 00:38:32,240
Sixteen ounces should net to me $16,000.

420
00:38:32,449 --> 00:38:35,410
Sixteen. Not 15.

421
00:38:36,953 --> 00:38:38,413
Something came up.

422
00:38:39,915 --> 00:38:41,249
Something came up?

423
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:44,544
One of my guys got held up
by a couple junkies.

424
00:38:44,753 --> 00:38:49,341
Lost an ounce. But it's cool, okay?
Skinny Pete's cool.

425
00:38:51,134 --> 00:38:54,095
So you're saying
that your guy got robbed...

426
00:38:54,304 --> 00:38:59,643
- Or rather you got robbed.
- -but it doesn't matter.

427
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,355
Dude, it's called breakage, okay?

428
00:39:03,563 --> 00:39:05,273
Like Kmart. Shit breaks.

429
00:39:05,482 --> 00:39:07,442
And you're thinking this is acceptable?

430
00:39:07,651 --> 00:39:10,737
It's the cost of business, yo.

431
00:39:10,946 --> 00:39:12,530
You're sweating me over a grand?

432
00:39:12,614 --> 00:39:17,035
Hey, look, I'm just the chemist here.
I'm not the street guy, yo.

433
00:39:17,244 --> 00:39:19,620
But it seems to me
that what you call breakage

434
00:39:19,704 --> 00:39:22,791
is just you making a fool of yourself.

435
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:25,836
I've got another technical term for you.

436
00:39:26,628 --> 00:39:28,797
Non-sustainable business model.

437
00:39:29,005 --> 00:39:31,258
You're focusing on the negative.

438
00:39:31,466 --> 00:39:35,053
Six grand a day we're making.
What's your problem?

439
00:39:36,012 --> 00:39:38,098
What happens when word gets out,

440
00:39:38,306 --> 00:39:41,726
and it's open season
on these clowns you've hired?

441
00:39:41,935 --> 00:39:44,855
Once everyone knows that Jesse Pinkman

442
00:39:45,063 --> 00:39:49,151
drug lord, can be robbed with impunity.

443
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,652
Man, come on.

444
00:39:50,861 --> 00:39:54,322
You think Tuco had breakage?

445
00:39:55,323 --> 00:39:57,159
I guess it's true, he did.

446
00:39:57,367 --> 00:39:58,493
He broke bones.

447
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:02,664
He broke the skull of anybody
who tried to rip him off.

448
00:40:02,873 --> 00:40:05,375
You want another grand?
Is that it?

449
00:40:05,584 --> 00:40:07,836
- That's not my point.
- Take it. Here.

450
00:40:11,673 --> 00:40:14,593
Look, you got 15,000
you didn't have yesterday.

451
00:40:14,801 --> 00:40:16,970
Hey, we're making bank.
Shit happens.

452
00:40:17,179 --> 00:40:19,929
My guys get what they're up against
and they're careful.

453
00:40:20,015 --> 00:40:21,349
So am I.

454
00:40:21,558 --> 00:40:24,394
And you're all tucked in at night
with your precious family.

455
00:40:24,478 --> 00:40:27,480
So why don't you just stop being
such a freak about everything?

456
00:40:27,564 --> 00:40:30,442
You've made
the division of labour very clear.

457
00:40:31,902 --> 00:40:35,322
Yo, I mean, seriously

458
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:39,034
what the hell do you want me to do, huh?

459
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:07,270
Hey.

460
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:08,730
Sorry.

461
00:41:08,939 --> 00:41:10,690
Wow, you snuck in.

462
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:12,984
Didn't even know you were home.

463
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,320
What you eating?

464
00:41:15,529 --> 00:41:18,573
A panini. There's another one
in the freezer if you want it.

465
00:41:19,783 --> 00:41:21,493
I thought we nixed those, huh?

466
00:41:21,701 --> 00:41:23,411
Did we?

467
00:41:24,496 --> 00:41:29,084
Yeah. I mean, aren't those the ones
with the off-the-chart sodium?

468
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,795
I had a craving.

469
00:41:32,003 --> 00:41:34,172
Once in a while is no big deal.

470
00:41:40,303 --> 00:41:41,888
So where's Jr.?

471
00:41:42,806 --> 00:41:44,057
Out.

472
00:41:45,475 --> 00:41:47,602
With whom?

473
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:49,271
Louis.

474
00:41:53,233 --> 00:41:55,360
Out where?

475
00:41:56,862 --> 00:41:59,781
Somewhere. I don't know.

476
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:02,784
- He'll be back by 9.
- Okay.

477
00:42:04,661 --> 00:42:08,331
Yeah, I just thought you might
have a clue where your son is.

478
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,125
Why don't you?

479
00:42:11,501 --> 00:42:15,630
Why am I the only one who needs
to keep track of our son?

480
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,383
I'll tell you what.
Wanna know where he is, ask him.

481
00:42:18,467 --> 00:42:20,719
Just pick up the phone like I do.

482
00:42:32,314 --> 00:42:33,857
Great.

483
00:42:37,611 --> 00:42:40,822
Perhaps you might know something

484
00:42:41,031 --> 00:42:42,199
about this.

485
00:42:46,036 --> 00:42:47,120
Perhaps.

486
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:50,165
And then again

487
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:53,418
perhaps I don't, Walt.

488
00:42:53,627 --> 00:42:57,088
Perhaps I smoked them in a fugue state.

489
00:43:00,217 --> 00:43:02,177
I'd like an explanation, please.

490
00:43:02,385 --> 00:43:05,385
- You don't wanna go down that road.
- Why would you do this?

491
00:43:05,472 --> 00:43:08,641
- You're pregnant, for God's sakes.
- Three and a half cigarettes

492
00:43:08,725 --> 00:43:10,309
won't do a thing to the baby.

493
00:43:10,393 --> 00:43:12,593
- Nothing.
- I'm glad you're so sure, doctor.

494
00:43:12,729 --> 00:43:15,315
Three and a half. That was it.
I tossed the rest.

495
00:43:15,524 --> 00:43:21,488
And I'm sure you'll be very glad
to hear that, yes, I feel ashamed.

496
00:43:23,115 --> 00:43:27,410
Skyler, this...
I mean, this is something that...

497
00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:30,872
- This is so unlike you. Why...?
- Really?

498
00:43:31,081 --> 00:43:32,999
How would you know?

499
00:43:35,752 --> 00:43:37,838
No, thank you.

500
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,026
Hank.

501
00:44:28,472 --> 00:44:29,764
Jesus.

502
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:13,809
Yo.

503
00:45:22,192 --> 00:45:25,487
You asked me what I want you to do.

504
00:45:35,747 --> 00:45:38,333
I want you to handle it.
