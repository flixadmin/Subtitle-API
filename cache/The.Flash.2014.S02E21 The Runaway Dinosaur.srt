00:00:00,909 --> 00:00:03,077
(Barry) My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,079 --> 00:00:05,829
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,646 --> 00:00:09,697
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:09,732 --> 00:00:12,515
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,826
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:18,311
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

7
00:00:18,346 --> 00:00:21,411
but in doing so, I opened
up our world to new threats,

8
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:24,781
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:24,783 --> 00:00:27,167
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:27,668 --> 00:00:29,719
Previously on "The Flash"...

11
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:31,888
Barry, what you're seeing
is the Speed Force...

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,390
Your past, your present, your future.

13
00:00:34,392 --> 00:00:36,860
Say, Iris, you look amazing.

14
00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:38,061
Thanks, Tony.

15
00:00:38,063 --> 00:00:40,864
His skin changed. It turned to metal.

16
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:44,067
Tony might have been a bully,
but he didn't deserve to die.

17
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:46,619
Barry, you've always had
someone to come home to.

18
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:49,656
I can't help but wonder... Maybe
we were meant to be together.

19
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:50,874
You lost your powers?

20
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:52,692
I gave them up to save Wally.

21
00:00:52,727 --> 00:00:56,412
I can re-create the circumstances
to get you your speed back.

22
00:00:56,414 --> 00:00:58,498
Let's set up the particle accelerator.

23
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:03,086
[screaming]

24
00:01:05,228 --> 00:01:07,724
Barry... he's gone.

25
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:08,758
[sparks popping]

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,510
This wasn't su...

27
00:01:10,512 --> 00:01:12,011
I didn't...

28
00:01:12,298 --> 00:01:14,481
I'm so sorry.

29
00:01:14,483 --> 00:01:16,850
We lost him.

30
00:01:16,852 --> 00:01:18,268
No, no, no, no, he...

31
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,103
He could've got knocked somewhere

32
00:01:20,105 --> 00:01:21,821
or maybe even run there.

33
00:01:21,823 --> 00:01:24,824
[melancholy music]

34
00:01:25,026 --> 00:01:26,442
Nothing on the GPS.

35
00:01:26,444 --> 00:01:28,027
There were strikes
all over the building.

36
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:29,779
Jesse, come down here, please.

Wally?

[tense music]

41
00:01:42,344 --> 00:01:43,710
Oh, God, Wally!

42
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:45,545
No, no!

43
00:01:45,547 --> 00:01:47,263
Wally! Wally, wake up!

44
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:48,536
- No!
- Can you hear me?

45
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:50,133
- Wally!
- Jesse, Jesse!

46
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:51,601
- Jesse!
- Wally!

47
00:01:51,603 --> 00:01:52,969
Jesse!

00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:54,220
[grunts]

49
00:01:54,222 --> 00:01:56,856
Stop yelling, please.

50
00:01:56,858 --> 00:01:58,141
Her heart stopped.

51
00:01:58,143 --> 00:01:59,726
Her heart stopped!

52
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,613
Jesse...

53
00:02:03,615 --> 00:02:04,990
Are you okay?

54
00:02:06,985 --> 00:02:09,152
Jesse!

55
00:02:09,154 --> 00:02:11,821

56
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:14,824
[panting]

57
00:02:14,826 --> 00:02:16,485
It's beating. Her heart's beating.

58
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,544
[sighs]

59
00:02:17,546 --> 00:02:19,546
Henry's a doctor. He should see her.

60
00:02:19,548 --> 00:02:22,749
I'm so glad you're okay.

61
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:24,918
Hey, what's with him?

62
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,220
It's Barry.

63
00:02:27,222 --> 00:02:29,589
Barry's gone.

64
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:31,090
Are you good, Wally?

65
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:33,009
Okay, we should get you
home, get some rest, okay?

66
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:36,846
- I don't understand.
- No, it's okay. Let's go.

67
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:39,232
Jesse.

68
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:43,736
Henry, Wells' daughter is upstairs.

69
00:02:43,738 --> 00:02:45,355
The energy hit her too.

[melancholy music]

Henry!

73
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:53,663
All right.

00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:14,100
I saw him!

78
00:03:14,102 --> 00:03:15,935
I saw Barry.

79
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:17,849
He's alive.

Joe?

85
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:36,466
Good to see you, Barry.

86
00:04:39,854 --> 00:04:41,721
But I'm not Joe.

87
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,361
- You're not?
- No.

88
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:48,444
And all of this?

89
00:04:50,865 --> 00:04:53,649
It's not real?

90
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:56,084
How do you feel, being back here?

91
00:04:57,822 --> 00:04:59,528
I feel awful.

92
00:05:03,044 --> 00:05:06,329
We thought you'd be more comfortable

93
00:05:06,331 --> 00:05:08,715
talking to someone who looked familiar

94
00:05:08,717 --> 00:05:10,500
and in a place you knew.

95
00:05:11,342 --> 00:05:13,302
"We"?

96
00:05:13,304 --> 00:05:16,139
Who's "we," exactly?

97
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:18,558
That's a little hard to explain.

98
00:05:20,678 --> 00:05:22,438
Sit, Barry.

99
00:05:24,482 --> 00:05:27,016
Sit.

100
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,112
How much do you know
about the Speed Force?

101
00:05:39,624 --> 00:05:42,698
It's the source of my power.
It's what makes me a speedster.

102
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,534
Yes...

103
00:05:44,536 --> 00:05:46,536
and no.

104
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:48,871
When the first subatomic particle

105
00:05:48,873 --> 00:05:51,124
sprang forth from the Big Bang

106
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:54,594
to form reality as you know it,

107
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:56,262
we were there.

108
00:05:56,264 --> 00:06:00,633
When the last proton
decays, stops vibrating,

109
00:06:00,635 --> 00:06:04,887
and plunges the
universe into heat death,

110
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:07,390
we'll be there too.

111
00:06:07,392 --> 00:06:10,526
I'm talking to the Speed Force?

112
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:17,950
Isn't that like saying I'm having a
conversation with gravity or light or...

113
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:27,543
You need a minute.

114
00:06:28,963 --> 00:06:30,413
It's okay if you do.

115
00:06:30,415 --> 00:06:32,582
It's a lot to take in.

116
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,968
So you're saying I'm... I'm
talking to the source of my power,

117
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,972
which just so happens to look like...

118
00:06:39,974 --> 00:06:43,342
my adoptive dad?

119
00:06:43,344 --> 00:06:45,761
That's trippy. [laughing]

120
00:06:45,763 --> 00:06:48,681
We pretty much invented trippy here.

121
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:51,684
Look, I'm... I'm not sure
why you brought me here,

122
00:06:51,686 --> 00:06:53,435
but you need to send me back.

[dramatic music]

127

You're not going back.

Not until...

129
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:11,700
Till what?

130
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:18,678
Until you catch that.

131
00:07:36,698 --> 00:07:38,814
Cisco says Barry's still alive.

132
00:07:38,816 --> 00:07:40,616
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

133
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:43,202
Harry, I vibed him in
the center of a storm.

134
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:45,581
It was, like, in, like,
a vortex or something.

135
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,791
He's in...

136
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:50,626
He's in the Speed Force.

137
00:07:50,628 --> 00:07:52,161
- Get him out, damn it.
- I...

138
00:07:52,163 --> 00:07:54,191
- You can get him out, can't you?
- I don't know if I can.

139
00:07:54,363 --> 00:07:56,582
Henry, come here.

140
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:06,392
Listen, you are the only
one that can help Jesse.

141
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,594
Let me sit on Wells

142
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:11,013
till he figures out what
the hell he did to Barry.

143
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:12,644
I think we can get him back.

144
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:15,351
Joe, I know you love Barry, okay?

145
00:08:15,353 --> 00:08:19,355
But you have Iris, and you have Wally.

146
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:21,574
Barry's all I have left.

147
00:08:21,576 --> 00:08:23,359
I promise.

148
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:25,945
We'll find him.

149
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,288
Thank God you're here.

150
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,874
Caitlin's usually the
one doing this, but...

151
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:40,543
Heart rate's normal.

152
00:08:40,545 --> 00:08:42,712
Reflexes and breathing are fine.

153
00:08:42,714 --> 00:08:44,430
She should be waking up.

154
00:08:44,432 --> 00:08:47,049
She's just not.

155
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:49,185
It was the same with Barry.

156
00:08:49,187 --> 00:08:51,687
Um, after the first accident,

157
00:08:51,689 --> 00:08:54,109
he was in a coma that
no one could explain.

158
00:08:54,144 --> 00:08:55,391
What did you do with him?

159
00:08:55,393 --> 00:08:57,944
So they brought him here...
Well, Wells brought him here.

160
00:08:57,946 --> 00:08:59,228
The other Wells.

161
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,697
Right, the Wells who
was actually Thawne.

162
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:03,065
- Eobard, not Eddie.
- Right.

163
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:04,650
It's... it's complicated.

164
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:07,119
Anyway, we took care
of Barry while Wells...

165
00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:09,405
Thawne... treated him.

166
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:11,157
Are there any records of that treatment?

167
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,459
We might find clues how to help Jesse.

168
00:09:13,461 --> 00:09:16,245
Uh, yeah, they'd be
downstairs in the storage room,

169
00:09:16,247 --> 00:09:17,580
in the morgue.

170
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,498
Ew, you guys have a morgue?

171
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,417
Well, it's not like a morgue morgue.

172
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:24,974
It's not... it's like a poor
man's morgue, really. Morgue-ish.

173
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:27,011
Would one of you go get them, please?

174
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:29,842
Okay, well, I'm not going alone.

175
00:09:29,844 --> 00:09:31,844
[sighs]

176
00:09:31,846 --> 00:09:33,624
Thank you.

177
00:09:35,099 --> 00:09:37,850
Okay, so it's a morgue morgue.

178
00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:42,021
But, you know, we had to keep
the dead meta-humans somewhere.

179
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:45,941
Yeah, looks like you did a
lot more than just store them.

180
00:09:45,943 --> 00:09:49,612
Fake Wells might've done a few
dissections for study purposes.

181
00:09:49,614 --> 00:09:52,748
And this didn't tip any of you
off that he might be secretly evil?

182
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,200
It was a crazy time, okay?

183
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:55,951
We had a lot going on.

184
00:09:55,953 --> 00:09:57,453
I'll tell you what...

185
00:09:57,455 --> 00:09:59,455
It's a good thing
Thawne was so organized.

You stop. I didn't touch anything.

189
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:07,179
Okay, whatever you say.

190
00:10:07,181 --> 00:10:10,383

Nope, not Tony... Not anymore.

We're glad you made it, Barry.

[sighs]

215
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,862
Not Iris.

00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,230
It's just you again.

You're always on your feet.

220
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,998
You remember this place,

221
00:11:57,234 --> 00:11:59,000
where we first kissed?

222
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,137
Yeah, of course, except that wasn't you.

223
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:08,689
We thought you'd find this place
and our appearance less upsetting.

224
00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:13,648
Yet you seem upset.

225
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,235
My friends, my city...

226
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,271
my whole world is in danger.

227
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:23,241
Zoom is on a rampage with the
power that he stole from me,

228
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,943
and you are keeping me here.

229
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:28,246
You were given a rare and precious gift,

230
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,165
and you rejected it.

231
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,200
No, I did not reject it.

232
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:34,869
I gave up my powers to
save someone's life...

233
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:36,204
To be a hero.

234
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:38,840
I nearly killed myself
trying to get them back,

235
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:42,111
when you brought me
here, wherever here is.

236
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:45,797
- That's not what we meant.
- Okay.

237
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,550
If you would rather
have given these powers

238
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:50,185
to somebody else,

239
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,353
why did you give them to me?

240
00:12:53,116 --> 00:12:55,857
Because you're The Flash, Barry.

241
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,112
[sighs] We got a new problem.

242
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,982
Our accelerator experiment
seems to have reanimated

243
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,900
one of the dead metas in our morgue.

244
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:08,236
"Reanimated," like brought back to life?

245
00:13:08,238 --> 00:13:09,988
Life-ish. You ever
seen "The Walking Dead"?

246
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,239
It's "The Walking Dead,"

247
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:14,659
but without higher brain function
and with major rage issues.

248
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,294
Still unsure if our brains
are on the menu, though.

249
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,163
- Which one?
- Tony Woodward.

250
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:21,666
The bully from school who
turned into the metal man?

251
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,334
That's not good, Cisco.

252
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,336
History repeats itself.

253
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,589
First as tragedy

254
00:13:27,591 --> 00:13:29,674
and then as farce.

255
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:32,644
[tense music]

256
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:35,513
Wells, as a parent, believe me,

257
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:38,233
I have nothing but sympathy
for what you're going through.

258
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,518
Listen to me closely when I say to you,

259
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,770
we got a lot of fires
burning at the same time,

260
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:44,189
and if we all work together,

261
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:47,025
we just might be able to put them out.

262
00:13:47,295 --> 00:13:49,527
Let Henry take care of your daughter.

263
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,696
Me and Iris will handle
this Girder situation,

264
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:54,082
but you and Cisco are the scientists.

265
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,867
You're the only one
who can bring Barry back

266
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,809
from wherever the hell he is right now.

267

Ramon...

268
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,457
give those medical records to Henry,

269
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:05,510
and meet me in the Breach
Room in five minutes.

270
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,763
We've got work to do.

271
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,882
Now we just need to find Tony.

272
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:13,518
Yeah, hopefully before he kills someone.

So how do we know this is safe?

00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,432
Well, define "safe."

Safe, as in my brain's not gonna melt.

287
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:06,988
No. It's a simple feedback
loop, Ramon, all right?

288
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,158
When you vibe on Barry, your brain
waves send me the necessary data

289
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,776
to pinpoint whatever dimensional pocket

00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,945
or corner of the universe
that Barry is stuck in.

291

And then we electrically stimulate

your prefrontal cortex
while opening a breach,

293
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,586
which gives you physical access to Barry

294
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,956
and lets you be the
beacon to guide him home.

Simple feedback loop.

I'm sorry. Did you say
electrically stimulate?

297
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:33,598

bring Barry back or not?

If I'm The Flash, then why
are you doing this to me?

Why do I have to catch
this... this thing

before you let me go back?

Please, look, I will
do whatever you want.

309

now, so I can help my friends.

They want you to come back.

Can I?

Of course.

336
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:55,784
I saw him.

337
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,159
Barry... he turned to me.

338
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,111
[sighs]

339
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,362
I'm sorry.

340
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,331
I lost him.

341
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,284
[melancholy music]

342
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,704

[computer beeping]

344
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:19,261
Whoa, Cisco's meta-human
alert app is going crazy.

345
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:23,799
Oh, Tony just trashed
the hell out of Jitters.

346
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:26,051
[scoffs] Now, that is strange.

347
00:18:26,053 --> 00:18:28,420
He knocks over a hydrant
on 4th and Stevenson,

348
00:18:28,422 --> 00:18:30,139
doesn't go in the building,

349
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:32,641
then smashes a Humvee in
front of the Big Belly Burger,

350
00:18:32,643 --> 00:18:34,226
but doesn't go in the building.

351
00:18:34,228 --> 00:18:36,261
Gets to CC Jitters...
He actually goes in.

352
00:18:36,263 --> 00:18:40,065
Yeah, it's like Jitters
was his target, but why?

353
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:43,686
When I was in Iron
Heights awaiting trial,

354
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:46,939
I had a cellmate who always
swore he was gonna break out.

355
00:18:46,941 --> 00:18:49,108
At a pre-trial hearing,
he stole a deputy's gun

356
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,993
and escaped in a police cruiser.

357
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:52,778
There's a point to this, Joe, I promise.

358
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,997
Now, the poor, dumb bastard
could have gone anywhere, right?

359
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:58,367
But he was apprehended two
hours later. Do you know why?

360
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:01,420
'Cause he went to his old
girlfriend's house looking for her.

361
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:02,871
So you think that's what Tony's doing,

362
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:04,456
even in the state he's in now?

363
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,291
I think people are creatures of habit,

364
00:19:06,293 --> 00:19:08,961
sometimes at a level stronger
than conscious thought.

365
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:10,629
No, I don't think that
Tony had a girlfriend.

366
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:14,349
I mean, not the way that he
was hitting on me when he...

367
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:16,635
He came into Jitters.

368
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:19,221
He's after me again.

369
00:19:19,223 --> 00:19:22,391
So, when he was after
you the first time,

370
00:19:22,393 --> 00:19:25,978
where'd you see him next, after Jitters?

371
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,980
Home.

372
00:19:27,982 --> 00:19:29,648
He came to our house when he took you.

373
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,150
Wally's there now.

374
00:19:31,152 --> 00:19:32,651
No, no, Dad, this is good.

375
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:34,653
We know where he is, and
we know what he wants.

376
00:19:34,655 --> 00:19:36,488
That means we know how to beat him.

377
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,157
How do you propose we do that?

378
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:41,293
We use me as bait to lure
him back to S.T.A.R. Labs,

379
00:19:41,295 --> 00:19:44,163
where Cisco and Wells can kill him...

380
00:19:44,165 --> 00:19:46,882
again.

381
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:50,169
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

[panting]

383
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:08,988
Who are you pretending to be now?

384
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:13,242
I don't have time for this.

385
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:15,244
Yes, you do, Barry.

386
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:18,747
You have all the time in the universe...

387
00:20:19,262 --> 00:20:21,244
- literally.
- No, I don't.

388
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,753
And how can you stand there in judgment
and accuse me of rejecting my gift?

389
00:20:24,755 --> 00:20:28,390
Do you have any idea how much I've done
since I was first struck by lightning,

390
00:20:28,392 --> 00:20:31,644
how many people I've helped with
the power that you gave me...

391
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:34,063
what I've sacrificed?

392
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:36,348
Of course we do.

393
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,684
You've saved countless lives.

394

[dramatic music]

395
00:20:41,188 --> 00:20:43,355
And now you're the only thing

396
00:20:43,357 --> 00:20:48,562
standing in between your
world and unspeakable evil.

397
00:20:49,363 --> 00:20:51,747
And yet, for all of that,

398
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:54,667
you've never been here.

Wally. Thank you.

402
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:15,054
Don't mention it.

403
00:21:16,557 --> 00:21:18,807
Wait.

404
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:21,894
I've been meaning to ask you. Uh...

405
00:21:21,896 --> 00:21:23,779
How are you feeling?

406
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:26,231
Tired, but fine, I guess.

407
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:30,736
So you don't notice anything different?

408
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:33,789
Uh, no.

409
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:37,576
I mean, I want you to know you can come
and talk to me if you're scared or...

00:21:37,578 --> 00:21:42,831
you have questions about
how your body's changing.

Oh.

I think you're a little late
for the puberty talk, Dad.

do this the old-fashioned way.

that he's a meta-human?

Well, he got zapped by
the particle accelerator,

and he was unconscious.
It was worth a shot.

Why did you bring me here?

Your mother's death
happened to you, Barry.

444
00:23:11,505 --> 00:23:14,556
It made who you are,
but have you accepted it,

couldn't come here...

No, no. This is good. Okay, sidenote...

The stray energy from the accelerator

Well, parts of it, anyway.

Girder walks through that door

[distant clatter]

497
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:02,835
Not safe enough.

498
00:26:02,837 --> 00:26:05,004
Plans A through G did not work.

499
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:10,225
Do we have anything in
here that can stop him?

500
00:26:10,227 --> 00:26:12,144
Barry could stop him if
we could bring him back.

501
00:26:12,146 --> 00:26:13,623
We tried that already, Dr. Allen.

502
00:26:13,658 --> 00:26:15,442
We need to try it again.

503
00:26:17,149 --> 00:26:20,073
Somebody needs to try something.
That door's not gonna hold.

504
00:26:27,161 --> 00:26:29,528

[chuckles]

507
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,357
Mom.

508
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,109
Hi, Barry.

509
00:27:05,816 --> 00:27:08,367
You're not my mother.

510
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:13,572
Why are you doing this to me?

511
00:27:13,574 --> 00:27:17,826
We're not doing anything
to you, sweetheart.

512
00:27:17,828 --> 00:27:20,712
You're just so tired.

513
00:27:20,714 --> 00:27:23,465
Sit, Barry. Sit.

514
00:27:36,847 --> 00:27:38,430
You were right all along.

515
00:27:38,432 --> 00:27:40,482
I haven't accepted it...

516
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:43,435
not for a second.

517
00:27:43,437 --> 00:27:46,105
I don't think I ever will.

518
00:27:50,611 --> 00:27:52,611
My beautiful boy...

519
00:27:54,248 --> 00:27:56,999
You have to find a way.

520
00:27:57,001 --> 00:27:58,584
How?

521
00:27:58,586 --> 00:28:00,202
I don't know.

522
00:28:00,204 --> 00:28:02,538
But I know this.

523
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,458
What you've become... It's wonderful...

524
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,210
a miracle even,

525
00:28:08,212 --> 00:28:12,798
but it won't make bad
things stop happening to you.

526
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,967
Even the Flash can't
outrun the tragedies

527
00:28:14,969 --> 00:28:17,970
the universe is gonna
keep sending your way.

528
00:28:17,972 --> 00:28:20,305
You have to accept that.

529
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:23,105
And then you can truly run free.

530
00:28:24,945 --> 00:28:27,863
[voice breaking] I know.

531
00:28:27,865 --> 00:28:29,948
I just miss her.

532
00:28:32,403 --> 00:28:34,903
I miss you so much.

533
00:28:36,824 --> 00:28:39,825
What if I told you
that she's proud of you?

534
00:28:40,995 --> 00:28:43,829
And of the man that you've become?

535
00:28:43,831 --> 00:28:46,632
Who's telling me that...

536
00:28:46,634 --> 00:28:49,835
the Speed Force or my mother?

537
00:28:49,837 --> 00:28:51,587
Both.

538
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:12,800
Is there any other way out of here?

539
00:29:12,802 --> 00:29:15,136
No, the Breach Room was
designed to be sealed off.

540
00:29:15,138 --> 00:29:17,805
All right, look, if
it's me that he wants,

541
00:29:17,807 --> 00:29:19,640
- I'll just lead him away.
- No, you won't.

542
00:29:19,642 --> 00:29:21,192
You'll never even
make it past that door.

543
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:22,810
If he came back from the
dead and still wants you,

544
00:29:22,812 --> 00:29:24,562
what makes you think
he's gonna let you go now?

545
00:29:24,564 --> 00:29:26,147
Wait.

546
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:30,718
I saw Barry. He had this look.

547
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,353
What if we couldn't get
him out of the Speed Force

548
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:34,855
because he didn't want to come back?

549
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,307
Do you remember this book?

550
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:38,960
It was always your favorite.

"Once there was a little
dinosaur called a Maiasaur,

Any of you got a better idea?

579

When you look into the Speed Force,

580
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:34,842
can someone else see into it too?

Well, as long as you're
in physical contact

yes.

- Girder.

Girder came back to life, and
he's all Young Frankenstein now,

so we could demagnetize him,
but the machine shorted out,

605
00:33:53,316 --> 00:33:54,698
so he's about to come through that door

606
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,812
and smush us all into chunky salsa
and possibly eat our brains out.

00:33:56,847 --> 00:33:58,721
- I don't know. Jury's still out on that.
- All right, I got it.

608
00:33:58,756 --> 00:34:00,151
I-I will lure him to your workshop,

609
00:34:00,186 --> 00:34:02,130
and we figure out a way to
turn the power back on, okay?

He's taking him the long way. Come on!

I hope you're ready. He's almost here.

Nope, not ready.

Power needs at least
two electromagnets...

Too much for this wiring to handle.

00:34:42,031 --> 00:34:44,114
We're gonna need a
really big extension cord!

620
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:46,867
All right, I'll...
I'll see what I can do.

621
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:05,686
Ugh!

look, you were never my favorite person,

He's using spin to charge the magnets.

You should rest. You
don't need to be here.

No, that's just it. I think I do.

How did you do that?

Are you, like, magic now?

647
00:36:59,574 --> 00:37:02,575
Did you know that was gonna happen?

648
00:37:02,577 --> 00:37:06,162
Maybe. It's hard to explain. It's...

649
00:37:06,164 --> 00:37:08,498
It's the Speed Force.

It's been quite a day, huh?

Not so much "one damn
thing after another"

653
00:37:22,564 --> 00:37:25,500
as "every damn thing all at once".

654
00:37:26,068 --> 00:37:27,767
It all worked out okay in the end.

655
00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:31,771
No, you worked it out okay in the end.

656
00:37:31,773 --> 00:37:35,275
It's funny. I never really understood

where you were coming from
with your whole "fate"

and "everything happens
for a reason" point of view.

00:37:43,118 --> 00:37:46,586
I think that maybe I was wrong.

661
00:37:46,588 --> 00:37:51,124
Everything that's happened to us...

662
00:37:51,126 --> 00:37:53,343
Good and bad...

663
00:37:53,345 --> 00:37:55,795
It made us who we are.

664
00:37:55,797 --> 00:38:00,074
And I don't think that I would
change it even if I could.

665
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,136
Does that make any sense?

666
00:38:03,138 --> 00:38:05,188
Perfect sense.

667
00:38:07,192 --> 00:38:08,975
And since we're on the subject

668
00:38:08,977 --> 00:38:13,313
of changing our minds
about important things,

669
00:38:13,315 --> 00:38:15,692
you know that part where I told
you I was gonna leave Central City

670
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:19,329
so that you could be the Flash without
being concerned about me all the time?

671
00:38:19,821 --> 00:38:23,740
Forget all of that.
You're stuck with me.

672
00:38:23,742 --> 00:38:25,492
I'm not going anywhere.

673
00:38:25,494 --> 00:38:27,327
[chuckles]

674
00:38:40,342 --> 00:38:43,893
Joe offered to take me so many times.

675
00:38:43,895 --> 00:38:47,013
I always found an excuse to say no.

676
00:38:47,015 --> 00:38:49,933
[melancholy music]

677
00:38:53,355 --> 00:38:56,406
My mom and I read
this when I was little.

678
00:38:58,527 --> 00:38:59,909
Do you know it?

679
00:38:59,911 --> 00:39:03,913
Yeah. I-I never really liked that book.

680
00:39:03,915 --> 00:39:05,498
Why?

681
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,700
Because it was about a
mother who was always there

682
00:39:07,702 --> 00:39:09,285
for her child, no matter what,

683
00:39:09,287 --> 00:39:12,922
and that wasn't my mom...

684
00:39:12,924 --> 00:39:15,124
or yours.

685
00:39:15,126 --> 00:39:20,129
We never had anyone who
was "just right" for us.

686
00:39:25,687 --> 00:39:28,054
Didn't we?

687
00:39:29,641 --> 00:39:32,725
I'm seeing things a lot differently now.

688
00:39:32,727 --> 00:39:35,395
I wasted so much time being angry

689
00:39:35,397 --> 00:39:38,615
about what I'd lost,
when I had so much...

690
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:43,653
My dad, Joe, and you.

691
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,907
The truth is, Iris, I
don't know what this is

692
00:39:47,909 --> 00:39:50,910
between us or where we go from here.

693
00:39:50,912 --> 00:39:53,963
All I know is you're everything to me,

694
00:39:53,965 --> 00:39:56,382
and you always have been.

695
00:39:56,384 --> 00:39:59,969
And the sound of your voice
will always bring me home.

696
00:39:59,971 --> 00:40:02,889
[upbeat music]

697
00:40:09,347 --> 00:40:12,765
[ominous music]

698
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:13,983
Cait, please.

699
00:40:13,985 --> 00:40:16,352
I asked you not to call me that.

700
00:40:16,354 --> 00:40:17,820
Caitlin...

701
00:40:17,822 --> 00:40:21,107
we've been through this again and
again, and we've gotten nowhere.

702
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:24,444
Now, I need to know... Are you
with me, or are you against me?

703
00:40:24,446 --> 00:40:27,614
Don't answer that yet.

704
00:40:29,868 --> 00:40:31,451
I'm gonna go out there,

705
00:40:31,453 --> 00:40:33,586
spend a moment speaking to my friends,

706
00:40:33,588 --> 00:40:36,089
and when I come back,
you'll give me your answer.

707
00:40:36,091 --> 00:40:39,626
If you're still here, I'll know
you've chosen to stay with me.

708
00:40:39,628 --> 00:40:42,962
But if you're not here...

709
00:40:42,964 --> 00:40:46,633
I'll know you've chosen
your friends instead.

710
00:40:46,635 --> 00:40:50,136
And I will show you
exactly as much mercy

711
00:40:50,138 --> 00:40:55,141
as I will show them when
we next see each other.

712
00:40:55,143 --> 00:40:57,694
So there you have it.

713
00:40:57,696 --> 00:41:00,863
[sighs]

714
00:41:04,486 --> 00:41:06,786
I need to go.

715
00:41:16,047 --> 00:41:19,999
[demonic voice] My
brothers and sisters...

716
00:41:20,001 --> 00:41:23,169
my friends...

717
00:41:23,171 --> 00:41:26,506
I've brought us to this new world

718
00:41:26,508 --> 00:41:28,841
which lay before us,

719
00:41:28,843 --> 00:41:33,680
defenseless, ours for the taking.

720
00:41:33,682 --> 00:41:37,100
The humans think that this planet

721
00:41:37,102 --> 00:41:40,069
belongs to them.

722
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:42,021
Whose world is this?

723
00:41:42,023 --> 00:41:44,691
All: [chanting] Our world! Our world!

724
00:41:44,693 --> 00:41:46,624
Our world! Our world!

725
00:41:46,801 --> 00:41:49,021
Our world! Our world!

726
00:41:49,179 --> 00:41:51,301
Our world! Our world!

727
00:41:51,478 --> 00:41:53,659
Our world! Our world!

728
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:55,833
Our world! Our world!
