00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:57,269
Ha Ha Ha

4
00:03:22,884 --> 00:03:26,084
Three weeks, and we're
still no close to cracking this.

5
00:03:26,803 --> 00:03:29,002
Right! Bring him in!

6
00:03:29,003 --> 00:03:30,228
Yes, sir.

7
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:56,484
This is the best party ever!

8
00:04:25,202 --> 00:04:26,401
Oh, no!

9
00:04:26,402 --> 00:04:28,027
A dragon is approaching!

10
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:32,727
Ahhh!!

11
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:36,869
Fear not, for here come
the valiant knights to save us!

12
00:04:55,494 --> 00:04:57,794
What do you mean
she's not coming?

13
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,519
I have a backyard full of these little girls who are
counting on the visit from the Fairy Princess!

14
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:17,839
Listen! I do not want a refund! I want the
Fairy Princess! Please, please, I'm begging you!

15
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,920
You know what? I hope you can sleep at night,
you crusher of little girls' dreams!

16
00:05:24,046 --> 00:05:26,246
Oh, oh, when's the
Fairy Princess coming?

17
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,570
Any minute now!

18
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:30,269
Yayy!

19
00:05:31,563 --> 00:05:32,763
Stall them!

20
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,815
<font color="#ff0080">Pertunjukan Sulap</font>

21
00:05:47,772 --> 00:05:49,472
Whoa, whoa, okay, okay...

22
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:52,060
Alright, that's enough
of the magic show!

23
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:53,286
Aww!

24
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:57,498
Wait, did you hear that?

25
00:05:57,499 --> 00:06:01,323
It sounded like the twinkling
sounds of magical fairy dust.

26
00:06:01,324 --> 00:06:02,654
It's the Fairy Princess,

27
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:03,879
She's coming!

28
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:05,705
Look!

29
00:06:33,336 --> 00:06:36,536
It is I, GruTinkerbell!

30
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,909
The most magical Fairy
Princess of all!

31
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:46,134
I am here to
wish Princess Agnes,

32
00:06:46,135 --> 00:06:47,860
A very happy birthday!

33
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:50,119
How come you're so fat?

34
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:52,112
Because...

35
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:54,671
My house is made of candy!

36
00:06:54,672 --> 00:06:58,597
And sometimes, I eat instead
of facing my problems!

37
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:00,558
How come you ha---

38
00:07:02,094 --> 00:07:03,294
Okay, time for cake!

39
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:04,979
Yay!

40
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:09,888
Thank you, GruTinkerbell!

41
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:11,912
You're the best Fairy
Princess ever!

42
00:07:11,913 --> 00:07:14,138
You are welcome, little girl!

43
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:18,289
I know it's really you, Gru.

44
00:07:18,714 --> 00:07:20,614
I'm just pretending
for the other kids.

45
00:07:25,823 --> 00:07:28,023
Hey there, Gru, Mister
Life of the party!

46
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,210
Hello, Jillian!

47
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:35,534
So, I'm gonna go out on a
limb here, but my friend Natalie,

48
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:38,460
is recently single, and...

49
00:07:39,986 --> 00:07:42,185
No, no, no! Get off
the limb, right now!

50
00:07:42,186 --> 00:07:43,410
No limb.

51
00:07:43,411 --> 00:07:45,335
Come on! She's a riot!

52
00:07:45,336 --> 00:07:48,560
She sings karaoke, she
has a lot of free time,

53
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:50,186
looks aren't that
important to her!

54
00:07:51,422 --> 00:07:53,421
Look, Jill, it's not happening.

55
00:07:53,422 --> 00:07:55,046
Seriously, I'm fine.

56
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:57,771
Okay, fine, forget Natalie.
How about my cousin Linda?

57
00:07:57,772 --> 00:07:58,996
No.

58
00:07:58,997 --> 00:08:01,201
Oh, I know someone whose
husband just died...

59
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:06,403
I'm sorry, I did
not see you there.

60
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:09,645
Or there.

61
00:08:20,326 --> 00:08:21,926
Kyle, Kyle,

62
00:08:22,504 --> 00:08:25,304
Kyle, stop! Stop doing your
business on the Petunias!

63
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:29,769
There you go, go
to Fred's. Go crazy.

64
00:08:34,073 --> 00:08:35,272
Good boy.

65
00:08:35,273 --> 00:08:36,497
Mr. Gru?

66
00:08:36,498 --> 00:08:37,723
Wha, I didn't, wha.. Yes?

67
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:42,583
Hi! Agent Lucy Wilde
of the AVL.

68
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:44,941
Oh... oops!

69
00:08:45,682 --> 00:08:46,882
Sorry.

70
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:48,507
You're gonna have to
come with me.

71
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:50,432
Oh, sorry, I'm--- Freeze Ray!

72
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:58,366
You know you really should announce your
weapons after you fire them, Mr. Gru.

73
00:08:59,323 --> 00:09:00,323
For example...

74
00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:05,001
Lipstick taser!

75
00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:07,949
Oh, it works so good.

76
00:09:20,157 --> 00:09:21,357
Ouch... Where is it...

77
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:30,285
Oh.. Sorry.

78
00:09:32,483 --> 00:09:33,683
Ughh.. arghhh..

79
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,020
Get, in, there, you, big...

80
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:39,811
Whoa, curses...

81
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:43,438
Cannot feel...

82
00:12:44,684 --> 00:12:45,884
Good afternoon, Mr. Gru.

83
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:47,509
Yeah...

84
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,234
I apologize for our
methods in getting you here.

85
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,759
I don't!

86
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:54,483
I'd do it again in a heartbeat!
I am not gonna lie,

87
00:12:54,484 --> 00:12:57,708
I enjoyed that. Every second of it,
Gave me bit of a buzz, actually...

88
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,548
That's enough, Agent Wilde.

89
00:12:59,798 --> 00:13:00,697
Sorry.

90
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:02,623
Okay, this is bogus!

91
00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:06,972
I don't know who you
think you people are, but...

92
00:13:06,973 --> 00:13:08,898
We are the Anti-Villain League.

93
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:14,723
An ultra secret organization dedicated
to fighting crime on a global scale.

94
00:13:15,148 --> 00:13:19,848
Rob a bank, we're not interested.
Kill someone, not our deal.

95
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:25,190
But you were to melt the polar
ice caps, or vaporize Mount Fuji,

96
00:13:25,191 --> 00:13:26,415
or even,

97
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,241
Steal the moon...

98
00:13:29,355 --> 00:13:30,355
Then, we notice.

99
00:13:31,714 --> 00:13:34,513
First of all, you got no
proof that I did that.

100
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:37,739
Second, after I did do
that, I put it back.

101
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:41,864
We're well aware of that, Mr. Gru.
That's why we brought you here.

102
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:45,589
I am the league director,
Silas Ramsbottom.

103
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,690
Heehee... Bottom.

104
00:13:50,503 --> 00:13:51,503
Hilarious.

105
00:13:53,142 --> 00:13:54,342
Agent Wilde...

106
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:56,477
Oh, me now?

107
00:13:56,478 --> 00:14:00,802
Recently, an entire top secret lab
disappeared from the Arctic Circle.

108
00:14:00,803 --> 00:14:03,428
Yeah. The entire lab, just...

109
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,430
Gone. Where did it go?

110
00:14:06,755 --> 00:14:07,954
I don't care.

111
00:14:07,955 --> 00:14:08,978
Hmm...

112
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:11,979
The lab was devoted to
experiments involving PX-41.

113
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,505
A transmutation serum.

114
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:15,566
What is PX-41, you ask?

115
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:17,491
Hmmm... it's pretty bad.

116
00:14:17,492 --> 00:14:18,217
Look.

117
00:14:38,234 --> 00:14:40,234
You usually don't see
that in bunnies.

118
00:14:40,624 --> 00:14:41,824
As you could see,

119
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:44,348
In the wrong hands,
the PX-41 serum,

120
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:46,874
could be the most
devastating weapon on Earth.

121
00:14:49,143 --> 00:14:50,343
Fortunately,

122
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:53,629
it has a very distinct
chemical footprint.

123
00:14:54,054 --> 00:14:57,053
And, using the latest
chem tracking technology,

124
00:14:57,054 --> 00:15:00,278
we found traces of it
in the Paradise Mall.

125
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,503
Huh.. A Mall.

126
00:15:01,504 --> 00:15:02,728
Precisely.

127
00:15:02,729 --> 00:15:06,954
And we believe that one of these
shop owners is a master criminal.

128
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,479
And that's where you come in. As an ex-villain,
you know how a villain thinks, and acts.

129
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:16,403
The plan is, to set you up
undercover at a shop in the mall,

130
00:15:16,404 --> 00:15:17,429
where hopefully,
you'll be able to...

131
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,653
Okay! I see where
this is going!

132
00:15:19,654 --> 00:15:21,778
impossible stuff,

133
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:23,617
But no, no.

134
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:27,223
I'm a father now. And,
a legitimate businessman.

135
00:15:27,224 --> 00:15:31,448
I am developing a line of
delicious jams and jellies.

136
00:15:32,653 --> 00:15:33,855
"Jams and jellies".

137
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,280
Oh, attitude!

138
00:15:36,805 --> 00:15:38,004
That's right!

139
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,930
So thanks, but no thanks.

140
00:15:40,414 --> 00:15:44,313
instead of tasing people,

141
00:15:44,314 --> 00:15:45,539
and kidnapping them,

142
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,363
maybe you should just
give them a call!

143
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,188
Good day, Mr. Sheepbutt!

144
00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:51,413
Ramsbottom.

145
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:53,639
Oh, yeah, like I
said it better!

146
00:16:08,004 --> 00:16:10,204
Look, I probably shouldn't
be saying this, but...

147
00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:12,429
Your work as a villain,
was kind of, amazing.

148
00:16:12,954 --> 00:16:16,554
So if you ever wanna get back
to doing something awesome...

149
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:18,991
Give us a call.

150
00:16:39,323 --> 00:16:41,522
Hey, I told you
guys to get to bed!

151
00:16:41,523 --> 00:16:42,747
Oh, sorry.

152
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:44,273
So, when are you
going on your date?

153
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:45,197
What?

154
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:48,022
Remember? Ms. Jillian said she
was arranging a date for you.

155
00:16:48,023 --> 00:16:51,848
Yeah, well, she is a nutjob
and I'm not going on any date.

156
00:16:52,073 --> 00:16:53,072
Why not?

157
00:16:53,073 --> 00:16:54,298
Are you scared?

158
00:17:01,385 --> 00:17:03,385
Hey, did you guys see the
moon landing on TV?

159
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,223
Can you believe
it? It's so cool!

160
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:08,150
- Yeah, and you know what?
- Excuse me...

161
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:09,175
Lisa?

162
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,659
Hmmm.. Hey, Lisa,

163
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,685
I was wondering,

164
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,180
Gru touched Lisa!

165
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:23,460
Lisa's got Gruties!

166
00:17:31,023 --> 00:17:32,422
Scared? Of what?

167
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:33,647
Women? No!

168
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:34,673
That's bonkers!

169
00:17:34,898 --> 00:17:38,097
I just, I've no interest in going
on a date, that's all!

170
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,122
Case closed!

171
00:17:39,123 --> 00:17:40,148
I'm not scared!

172
00:17:40,149 --> 00:17:41,272
Of women.

173
00:17:41,273 --> 00:17:42,298
Or dates.

174
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:43,764
Let's go to bed.

175
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:46,519
Goodnight, Edith.

176
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:48,871
Goodnight, Margo.

177
00:17:48,872 --> 00:17:51,196
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Whoa, hold the horses,

178
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:52,619
who are you texting?

179
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,846
No one! Just my friend Avery.

180
00:17:54,584 --> 00:17:56,784
Avery... Eh? Avery?

181
00:17:57,129 --> 00:17:58,929
Is that a girl's name
or a boy's name?

182
00:17:59,554 --> 00:18:00,754
Does it matter?

183
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,678
No! No, it doesn't matter,

184
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:03,904
unless it's a boy!

185
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,100
I know what makes you a boy.

186
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,260
Uhh, you do?

187
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:11,517
Your bald head.

188
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,241
Ohh. Yes.

189
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:15,966
It's really smooth.

190
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:18,133
Sometimes I stare at it,

191
00:18:18,134 --> 00:18:20,459
and imagine a little
chick popping out.

192
00:18:21,405 --> 00:18:22,605
Peep-peep-peep!

193
00:18:23,575 --> 00:18:24,775
Goodnight, Agnes.

194
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:28,059
Never get older.

195
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:42,061
Hey, yo!

196
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:41,639
Hey, Tim, nice haircut!

197
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:44,163
Tommy, hang in there, baby!

198
00:19:44,164 --> 00:19:45,389
It's almost Friday!

199
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:48,799
So, how's today's
batch, Dr. Nefario?

200
00:19:49,161 --> 00:19:55,361
I developed a new formula which allowed me to
get every known kind of berry in a one flavor of jelly.

201
00:19:56,966 --> 00:19:58,766
Arghhh... Ugh...

202
00:19:59,444 --> 00:20:01,043
That is good!

203
00:20:01,044 --> 00:20:03,069
Love the flavor of...

204
00:20:03,817 --> 00:20:04,817
It's horrible, isn't it?

205
00:20:04,818 --> 00:20:06,042
No, no!

206
00:20:06,254 --> 00:20:08,354
Oh, we're making
great progress!

207
00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:10,179
Here, try some.

208
00:20:22,034 --> 00:20:23,634
Whoa... Okay,

209
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,258
Just because
everybody hates it,

210
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:27,484
doesn't mean it's not good!

211
00:20:28,734 --> 00:20:29,734
Listen, Gru...

212
00:20:30,658 --> 00:20:33,358
There's something I've been meaning
to talk to you about for some time now.

213
00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:34,683
What, what's wrong?

214
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,370
I miss being evil.

215
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:43,770
Sinister plots,
large-scale crimes,

216
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:44,996
It's what I live for!

217
00:20:44,997 --> 00:20:49,621
I mean, don't you think there's
more for our future than... jelly?

218
00:20:50,243 --> 00:20:52,943
Well, I'm also considering
a line of jams.

219
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:56,467
Umm... The thing is, Gru...

220
00:20:58,307 --> 00:21:00,307
I've now been
recruited elsewhere.

221
00:21:00,882 --> 00:21:02,282
Dr. Nefario!

222
00:21:02,507 --> 00:21:03,506
Oh, come on.

223
00:21:03,507 --> 00:21:04,732
You're kidding, right?

224
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:06,757
This is a great
opportunity for me...

225
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,622
More evil...

226
00:21:18,672 --> 00:21:19,872
Ah...

227
00:21:20,397 --> 00:21:21,396
Very well...

228
00:21:21,397 --> 00:21:24,622
Let us give you,
the proper send-off.

229
00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:26,247
Minions!

230
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,980
The highest honor awarded,

231
00:21:33,738 --> 00:21:34,938
to Dr. Nefario,

232
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:38,219
for your years of service,

233
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,779
the 21 Fart Gun Salute!

234
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:52,859
Uhh, I counted twenty-two.

235
00:21:59,699 --> 00:22:01,299
Farewell, my friends.

236
00:22:20,398 --> 00:22:22,198
This may take a while.

237
00:22:22,857 --> 00:22:23,957
Go about your business!

238
00:22:27,204 --> 00:22:29,004
I miss you already!

239
00:22:59,744 --> 00:23:01,444
Ehh? Oh, Hello!

240
00:23:24,912 --> 00:23:26,911
Are you sure we
can be doing this?

241
00:23:26,912 --> 00:23:28,492
Yes, it's for his own good.

242
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,207
Okay, we need to
choose a picture.

243
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:32,858
No.

244
00:23:33,136 --> 00:23:34,136
Scary.

245
00:23:34,902 --> 00:23:35,802
Weird.

246
00:23:36,027 --> 00:23:37,026
Ahh!!

247
00:23:37,027 --> 00:23:38,252
What is that?

248
00:23:38,477 --> 00:23:41,476
Good morning, girls, I have
an announcement to make!

249
00:23:41,477 --> 00:23:43,002
Hey, what celebrity
do you look like?

250
00:23:43,427 --> 00:23:44,626
Yuhh...

251
00:23:44,627 --> 00:23:45,652
Bruce Willis.

252
00:23:45,977 --> 00:23:47,077
Hmmm. No.

253
00:23:47,807 --> 00:23:48,807
Humpty Dumpty!

254
00:23:49,032 --> 00:23:50,232
Oooh, that one!

255
00:23:50,457 --> 00:23:51,657
Ha .. ha...

256
00:23:52,046 --> 00:23:53,646
Okay, what are you doing?

257
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:55,771
We're setting you
off for online dating!

258
00:23:55,772 --> 00:23:57,095
Oh. Okay, what!?

259
00:23:57,304 --> 00:23:58,704
No, no, no, no, no, no.

260
00:23:59,129 --> 00:24:00,128
Oh, come on.

261
00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:01,153
It's fun.

262
00:24:01,154 --> 00:24:03,077
And it's time for you
to get out there.

263
00:24:03,078 --> 00:24:04,904
No, stop. No one is ever
getting out there!

264
00:24:05,129 --> 00:24:06,328
Ever!

265
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:07,353
Okay...

266
00:24:07,354 --> 00:24:08,879
Now, for the announcement.

267
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:11,527
I have accepted a new job!

268
00:24:12,154 --> 00:24:13,153
Wow, really?

269
00:24:13,154 --> 00:24:15,095
Yes, I have been recruited,

270
00:24:15,096 --> 00:24:16,820
by a top secret agency

271
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:19,146
to go undercover
and save the world.

272
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:20,571
You're gonna be a spy?

273
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:22,696
That's right, baby!

274
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:24,521
Gru's back in the game!

275
00:24:24,846 --> 00:24:27,846
Gadgets, and weapons
and cool cars!

276
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:29,768
Awesome!

277
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:31,594
Are you really
gonna save the world?

278
00:24:32,683 --> 00:24:34,883
Yes. Yes, I am.

279
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:07,691
Hmm ..

280
00:25:08,997 --> 00:25:10,197
"Bake My Day".

281
00:25:11,438 --> 00:25:12,638
Bleh..

282
00:25:20,608 --> 00:25:23,908
Alright, here is the cupcake
recipe I got on the internet.

283
00:25:29,092 --> 00:25:30,392
And don't go nuts
with the sprinkles!

284
00:25:40,545 --> 00:25:41,243
Ahh!

285
00:25:41,244 --> 00:25:41,970
Ahh!

286
00:25:44,268 --> 00:25:45,467
Hiyatt .. hah

287
00:25:45,468 --> 00:25:47,092
huh ..huh... huh...

288
00:25:47,093 --> 00:25:48,316
huh ..huh... huh...

289
00:25:48,317 --> 00:25:49,543
huh ..huh... huh...

290
00:25:50,485 --> 00:25:51,685
Hiya ..hiya... hiyaa
Hiya ..hiya... hiyaa

291
00:25:53,565 --> 00:25:54,764
Whooh!

292
00:25:54,765 --> 00:25:56,163
Wasn't expecting that!

293
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:57,821
Or was I?

294
00:25:58,146 --> 00:25:59,945
Oh, you, you got, you got...

295
00:25:59,946 --> 00:26:01,071
Umm..Umm... A little...

296
00:26:03,788 --> 00:26:04,788
Here, I'll get it.

297
00:26:06,013 --> 00:26:07,813
Uhmm, it's spreading.

298
00:26:08,338 --> 00:26:09,538
Alright, alright. I got this.

299
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:10,763
I got this.

300
00:26:12,694 --> 00:26:13,694
I'll let you get it.

301
00:26:15,668 --> 00:26:20,067
What you just saw there was a little something
new I've been working on. It's a combination of

302
00:26:20,068 --> 00:26:21,992
Jujitsu, Krav maga,

303
00:26:21,993 --> 00:26:25,218
Aztec warfare, and Krumping.

304
00:26:25,443 --> 00:26:26,643
Okay, that's weird.

305
00:26:26,644 --> 00:26:28,267
Why are you here?

306
00:26:28,268 --> 00:26:29,591
On assignment from Silas.

307
00:26:29,592 --> 00:26:30,818
I'm your new partner!

308
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:32,043
Yay!

309
00:26:32,468 --> 00:26:33,667
What? No!

310
00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:34,893
No, "Yay!".

311
00:26:35,118 --> 00:26:37,717
Ramsbottom didn't say
anything about a partner.

312
00:26:37,718 --> 00:26:41,343
Well, seems that because of your checkered
past, everyone else refused to work with you.

313
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:42,599
But not me!

314
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,824
I stepped up!

315
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:46,549
And I'm new. So I'm gonna have to
do what they tell me anyway.

316
00:26:48,335 --> 00:26:49,235
<i>Voila!</i>

317
00:26:54,996 --> 00:26:55,996
You know this guy?

318
00:26:55,997 --> 00:26:57,521
Yes, he's one of my minions.

319
00:26:57,746 --> 00:26:59,146
Ohh... I'm sorry.

320
00:27:00,295 --> 00:27:01,495
I should have known.

321
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,220
You are free to go!

322
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,336
Earth to Dave!

323
00:27:42,092 --> 00:27:43,292
You can leave now.

324
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,318
So, what do we got?

325
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:54,545
Who's on the list?

326
00:27:54,546 --> 00:27:55,770
Fire Romantic

327
00:27:55,995 --> 00:27:57,195
First suspect,

328
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,920
The head of Bloom and Top,
proprietor of the floral shop.

329
00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:02,445
No, not her.

330
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:03,969
Okay.

331
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:04,895
Moving on...

332
00:28:04,896 --> 00:28:07,020
Chad Kenny, owner
of "Stuff-a-Bear".

333
00:28:11,026 --> 00:28:12,226
I don't think so.

334
00:28:12,927 --> 00:28:14,127
Hello?

335
00:28:17,427 --> 00:28:19,327
Buenos Dias, my friends!

336
00:28:20,215 --> 00:28:21,014
I am,

337
00:28:21,015 --> 00:28:22,240
Eduardo Perez.

338
00:28:22,565 --> 00:28:24,564
Owner of "Salsa
Y Salsa" restaurant,

339
00:28:24,565 --> 00:28:25,790
across the mall.

340
00:28:26,015 --> 00:28:27,815
Now open for breakfast.

341
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,040
And you are?

342
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,465
Gru! And this is Lucy,

343
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,188
and we are closed.

344
00:28:32,189 --> 00:28:33,907
This is just gonna
take un memento.

345
00:28:34,132 --> 00:28:36,182
I am throwing a big
Cinco De Mayo party.

346
00:28:36,957 --> 00:28:40,457
And I am going to need
200 of your best cupcakes.

347
00:28:40,982 --> 00:28:42,382
Decorated with,

348
00:28:43,007 --> 00:28:44,506
the Mexican Flag.

349
00:28:44,507 --> 00:28:46,432
It looks something like this.

350
00:28:48,439 --> 00:28:49,439
What do you think?

351
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:51,783
Ughh...

352
00:28:55,007 --> 00:28:58,806
Anyway, I have to go. It's all settled.
I'll pick them up next week.

353
00:28:58,807 --> 00:29:00,032
Have a good day!

354
00:29:00,575 --> 00:29:02,275
Come by if you get
a chance, okay?

355
00:29:04,068 --> 00:29:05,268
Ahh...

356
00:29:06,627 --> 00:29:09,527
And welcome, to
the Mall family.

357
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:18,536
El Macho!

358
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,499
What?

359
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,323
This couldn't be!

360
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:22,550
Wha-- what couldn't be?

361
00:29:24,706 --> 00:29:28,705
That guy, looks exactly
like the villain named,

362
00:29:28,706 --> 00:29:29,930
"El Macho".

363
00:29:29,931 --> 00:29:31,456
From about 20 years ago...

364
00:29:38,192 --> 00:29:39,392
He was ruthless...

365
00:29:39,713 --> 00:29:40,913
He was dangerous...

366
00:29:41,454 --> 00:29:42,654
And as the name implies...

367
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:44,619
Very macho!

368
00:29:55,122 --> 00:29:56,322
He had a reputation

369
00:29:56,547 --> 00:29:59,847
Of pulling a heist, using
only his bare hands!

370
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:04,666
Ah, but sadly,
like all the greats,

371
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:07,192
El Macho was gone, too soon...

372
00:30:08,127 --> 00:30:10,826
He died in the most
macho way possible.

373
00:30:10,827 --> 00:30:12,051
A shark,

374
00:30:12,052 --> 00:30:15,977
with 250,000 dynamites
strapped to his chest,

375
00:30:16,402 --> 00:30:19,602
into the mouth,
of an active volcano!

376
00:30:22,944 --> 00:30:24,144
It was glorious!

377
00:30:26,236 --> 00:30:29,436
Yeah, sounds like
El Macho's pretty dead?

378
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,260
They never found the body.

379
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:32,285
Oh, no.

380
00:30:32,286 --> 00:30:33,611
All that was ever retrieved,

381
00:30:33,936 --> 00:30:35,135
was a pile,

382
00:30:35,136 --> 00:30:37,161
of singed chest hair.

383
00:30:37,486 --> 00:30:38,686
That face!

384
00:30:39,311 --> 00:30:40,911
It has got to be El Macho.

385
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,300
So what do you say, you and
I break into his restaurant.

386
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:45,624
Tonight.

387
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:46,850
Yes, that's good.

388
00:30:47,075 --> 00:30:52,275
Because I'm telling you, if anybody in
this place has the PX-41 serum,

389
00:30:53,531 --> 00:30:54,531
it's him!

390
00:30:57,528 --> 00:31:01,427
Alright, alright, homework done,
pyjamas on, teeth brushed, time for bed.

391
00:31:01,428 --> 00:31:02,651
What's the big hurry?

392
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,476
I just, I have a
lot of work to do.

393
00:31:04,477 --> 00:31:05,103
Work?

394
00:31:05,428 --> 00:31:06,426
What kind of work?

395
00:31:06,427 --> 00:31:07,853
Very important business.

396
00:31:08,235 --> 00:31:09,635
So hugs, kisses.

397
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:12,434
Good night, sleep tight,
don't let the bed bugs...

398
00:31:12,435 --> 00:31:13,361
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...

399
00:31:13,686 --> 00:31:14,386
Wha...?

400
00:31:14,387 --> 00:31:17,511
But you said you'd help me practice
my part for the mother's day show.

401
00:31:18,445 --> 00:31:19,644
Ahhh...

402
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:20,929
Fine, fine.

403
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,455
Let me hear it, quickly.

404
00:31:23,078 --> 00:31:24,278
"She kisses my boo-boos."

405
00:31:24,903 --> 00:31:26,203
She braids my hair.

406
00:31:26,828 --> 00:31:29,428
My mother is beyond compare.

407
00:31:29,653 --> 00:31:31,853
We love you,
mothers everywhere...

408
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:35,738
Wow, that was, something else!

409
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,800
I really like the way
you smiled at the end.

410
00:31:39,433 --> 00:31:45,332
Let's try this one more time but
a tinsy-bit less like a zombie.

411
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:46,357
Okay?

412
00:31:46,358 --> 00:31:47,582
Okay.

413
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:48,808
"She kisses my boo-boos.

414
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:50,632
She braids my hair..."

415
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:51,858
Perfect! Time to go.

416
00:31:52,652 --> 00:31:53,852
I don't think I should do this.

417
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,013
Wha... what do you mean?

418
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,237
Why not?

419
00:31:57,238 --> 00:31:58,663
I don't even have a mom.

420
00:31:59,942 --> 00:32:01,340
Well, you don't need one

421
00:32:01,341 --> 00:32:02,367
to do the show.

422
00:32:02,368 --> 00:32:03,391
I mean,

423
00:32:03,392 --> 00:32:04,817
you did the parents'
day pageant.

424
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:07,042
You haven't been in combat.

425
00:32:08,127 --> 00:32:09,327
This is different.

426
00:32:09,752 --> 00:32:14,252
Okay, well, then, maybe you
can just use your imagination.

427
00:32:14,939 --> 00:32:17,238
You mean, I pretend
I have a mom?

428
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:17,739
Yes.

429
00:32:18,589 --> 00:32:20,289
Right? You can do
that, can't you?

430
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,513
Yeah! I do that all the time.

431
00:32:22,514 --> 00:32:23,739
Thanks, Gru!

432
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:57,808
Okay,

433
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,287
No, hey...

434
00:32:59,288 --> 00:33:00,312
Please...

435
00:33:00,313 --> 00:33:03,038
Kevin, Jerry, watch the
girls for me, okay?

436
00:33:03,379 --> 00:33:06,379
Dave, Stewart, come this
way, with me. Come on!

437
00:33:09,439 --> 00:33:10,638
Come on!

438
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:11,864
Yeah, yeah!

439
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:20,189

We're stealth ninjas.

441
00:35:05,031 --> 00:35:06,231
We make no sound.

442
00:35:06,456 --> 00:35:07,656
Right.

443
00:35:09,372 --> 00:35:10,972
Hiyah!!

444
00:35:13,326 --> 00:35:15,926
Alright, El Macho,
you're going down.

445
00:35:16,151 --> 00:35:17,150
Wait! Wait.

446
00:35:17,151 --> 00:35:18,376
What?

447
00:35:19,508 --> 00:35:20,708
What are you doing?

448
00:35:20,933 --> 00:35:23,433
Checking for laser
beam alarm triggers.

449
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:25,954
It's a restaurant!

450
00:35:25,955 --> 00:35:28,381
You never know what kind of
booby traps this guy could've set.

451
00:35:28,382 --> 00:35:29,606
Huh? Come on.

452
00:35:29,831 --> 00:35:31,231
There are no booby traps.

453
00:35:33,244 --> 00:35:34,244
Hah! Booby!

454
00:35:35,195 --> 00:35:36,195
Ugh...

455
00:35:45,128 --> 00:35:47,028
Huh... it's a chicken.

456
00:35:47,999 --> 00:35:49,499
Are you lost, little guy?

457
00:35:50,129 --> 00:35:51,329
You must be lost.

458
00:35:52,105 --> 00:35:53,805
Hah! Some guard dog!

459
00:35:56,374 --> 00:35:57,374
No, no, no!

460
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,918
Get it off of me!

461
00:35:58,919 --> 00:36:00,145
Get it off of me!

462
00:36:03,066 --> 00:36:04,266
Uh..uhh

463
00:36:04,591 --> 00:36:05,791
uh... ah...

464
00:36:08,087 --> 00:36:09,086
I got you!

465
00:36:09,087 --> 00:36:10,312
Ohhh..oh

466
00:36:11,137 --> 00:36:12,337
ahhhh... ahh...

467
00:36:15,046 --> 00:36:15,946
I got it!

468
00:36:15,947 --> 00:36:17,171
Ah...

469
00:36:28,012 --> 00:36:29,212
Oh..

470
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:37,219
What is wrong
with that chicken?

471
00:36:38,503 --> 00:36:40,903
Hey, that Pollo is Loco.

472
00:36:43,176 --> 00:36:44,375
No?

473
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:45,401
Okay, let's go.

474
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:54,772
You getting anything?

475
00:36:54,773 --> 00:36:55,596
No.

476
00:36:55,597 --> 00:36:56,422
Not yet.

477
00:36:56,423 --> 00:37:00,047
But hey, maybe you can find
something with these X-ray goggles!

478
00:37:02,432 --> 00:37:03,332
Aww.

479
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:09,729
How is it working,
tell me, tell me!

480
00:37:10,424 --> 00:37:11,423
Ahh!

481
00:37:11,424 --> 00:37:12,093
Ooh!

482
00:37:12,094 --> 00:37:12,818
What's wrong?

483
00:37:12,819 --> 00:37:13,745
Something wrong?

484
00:37:13,746 --> 00:37:15,970
That is an image I'll
never get out of my brain!

485
00:37:16,195 --> 00:37:16,995
Blechh!

486
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:26,533
I knew it!

487
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:28,644
The serum's in here!

488
00:37:28,645 --> 00:37:29,871
Ooh, then let's get it!

489
00:37:32,182 --> 00:37:33,982
This is going to be good!

490
00:37:34,407 --> 00:37:35,607
Ah...

491
00:37:40,207 --> 00:37:41,407
A-ha!

492
00:37:41,784 --> 00:37:42,983
What?

493
00:37:42,984 --> 00:37:44,208
<font color="#ff0080">Secret Salsa Recipe</font>

494
00:37:44,209 --> 00:37:45,435
This is, Salsa?

495
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,060
Aww, man...

496
00:37:53,561 --> 00:37:56,261
Somebody is going
to die tonight.

497
00:38:02,498 --> 00:38:03,798
Oh.. Paulito!

498
00:38:04,601 --> 00:38:05,501
Paulito,

499
00:38:05,502 --> 00:38:07,065
Paulito, can you hear me?

500
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:11,319
Who would do this to
such a sweet little chicken?

501
00:38:12,702 --> 00:38:13,902
Who's there?

502
00:38:14,247 --> 00:38:15,445
Uh-oh!

503
00:38:15,446 --> 00:38:17,372
You coming out, or
am I gonna go in?

504
00:38:27,729 --> 00:38:28,729
Stop!

505
00:38:29,942 --> 00:38:31,142
My eyes!

506
00:38:32,165 --> 00:38:33,665
Gru, call in your munchkins!

507
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,310
Get it started, come get us!

508
00:38:49,095 --> 00:38:50,395
Oooh. So long.

509
00:38:54,654 --> 00:38:55,552
Over here!

510
00:38:55,553 --> 00:38:56,479
Over here.

511
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,150
Over...

512
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,880
Here.

513
00:39:06,437 --> 00:39:07,437
Hold tight!

514
00:39:18,534 --> 00:39:20,534
I have you now!

515
00:39:56,304 --> 00:39:58,004
Yay! Ice cream!

516
00:40:55,473 --> 00:40:56,673
Gru! There he is.

517
00:40:57,365 --> 00:40:58,363
Suspect number 8.

518
00:40:58,364 --> 00:40:59,590
Floyd Eagle-san.

519
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,315
Well, Okay.

520
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,640
See if you can get closer.

521
00:41:02,641 --> 00:41:03,664
Go.

522
00:41:03,665 --> 00:41:04,590
Go!

523
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:16,131
Alright.

524
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:17,807
What the...

525
00:41:18,641 --> 00:41:19,541
Oh, no...

526
00:41:19,766 --> 00:41:20,766
That's not good!

527
00:41:24,043 --> 00:41:25,043
Hey, wait!

528
00:41:32,607 --> 00:41:33,607
Hi, Gru!

529
00:41:34,017 --> 00:41:34,915
Oh, girls!

530
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:36,248
What are you doing here?

531
00:41:36,249 --> 00:41:37,975
Well, we thought we'd
come visit you at work!

532
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:41,169
So, you're saving the world
in a garbage can?

533
00:41:42,894 --> 00:41:43,718
Funny.

534
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:45,344
Hey! There you are!

535
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:47,069
Oh, who's this?

536
00:41:47,494 --> 00:41:48,994
Lucy, these are my girls.

537
00:41:49,419 --> 00:41:51,019
Margo, Edith and Agnes.

538
00:41:51,644 --> 00:41:52,844
Girls, Lucy.

539
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,380
Lucy, Girls.

540
00:41:54,605 --> 00:41:55,504
Hello.

541
00:41:55,505 --> 00:41:56,330
Hi.

542
00:42:04,844 --> 00:42:06,044
Are you single?

543
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,310
Oh.. Goodness.

544
00:42:08,535 --> 00:42:10,434
Oh, hey! I have an idea,

545
00:42:10,435 --> 00:42:12,660
Since Lucy and I have
lots of work to do,

546
00:42:12,985 --> 00:42:14,985
Why don't you girls go
and explore the mall?

547
00:42:15,542 --> 00:42:18,241
Here is some money, go buy
some useless mall junk.

548
00:42:18,242 --> 00:42:19,966
Some headbands...

549
00:42:19,967 --> 00:42:21,592
Are you gonna marry Lucy?

550
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:23,516
Are you out of your gorf?

551
00:42:23,517 --> 00:42:25,542
No! She just works with me.

552
00:42:25,867 --> 00:42:27,065
Plus you love her.

553
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:27,890
You love her!

554
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:28,717
You love her!

555
00:42:28,942 --> 00:42:30,841
You really, really love her!

556
00:42:30,842 --> 00:42:32,067
Okay, stop.

557
00:42:32,292 --> 00:42:33,990
These are sordid lies.
I don't even like her.

558
00:42:33,991 --> 00:42:35,117
Now go have fun.

559
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:38,997
Almost forgot!

560
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:41,469
Good luck saving
the world! Bye!

561
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,694
Bye, Gru!

562
00:42:46,757 --> 00:42:48,457
Kids, right?

563
00:42:48,782 --> 00:42:50,381
They're, funny.

564
00:42:50,382 --> 00:42:52,307
Those girls totally adore you.

565
00:42:52,732 --> 00:42:53,932
I think you're a fun dad.

566
00:42:55,387 --> 00:42:57,587
Huh. I'm pretty fun.

567
00:43:07,708 --> 00:43:08,806
That's stealing.

568
00:43:08,807 --> 00:43:11,033
Not if my wish was to ever
get a hundred free coins.

569
00:43:15,008 --> 00:43:18,008
<font color="#00ff40">? This rainy day is temporary?</font>

570
00:43:18,233 --> 00:43:21,432
<font color="#00ff40">? The contrast is why we got him?</font>

571
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:26,757
<font color="#00ff40">? Cause sunshine due is just a cloud?
? away way way way way way?</font>

572
00:43:40,557 --> 00:43:42,683
<font color="#00ff40">- ? The day could change?
- ?  change  change  change?</font>

573
00:43:42,684 --> 00:43:43,908
Cool glasses.

574
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:45,233
Thanks.

575
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:47,370
I'm Antonio.

576
00:43:47,795 --> 00:43:48,695
I'm Margo.

577
00:43:49,841 --> 00:43:51,341
I was just going
to get a cookie.

578
00:43:52,124 --> 00:43:53,322
Care to join me?

579
00:43:53,323 --> 00:43:54,549
Uhh... sure...

580
00:43:56,211 --> 00:43:57,411
I'm, Margo.

581
00:44:04,152 --> 00:44:05,352
Uh-Ahemm!

582
00:44:06,065 --> 00:44:08,265
Umm... I'll catch up
with you guys later.

583
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:09,890
Bye!

584
00:44:11,711 --> 00:44:14,111
Can I be the first
to say, "Eww"!

585
00:44:14,336 --> 00:44:15,636
We got to go tell Gru!

586
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,149
Alright, I'm going in.

587
00:44:22,603 --> 00:44:25,602
<i>If it picks up any traces of the
serum, the center of your belt buckle</i>

588
00:44:25,603 --> 00:44:28,827
will make a sound like this.

589
00:44:28,828 --> 00:44:31,053
Okay. I get it. I get it.

590
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:39,409
Welcome,

591
00:44:39,867 --> 00:44:41,067
to "Eagle Hair Club".

592
00:44:42,028 --> 00:44:43,228
It's about time you showed up.

593
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,720
Mr. Gru.

594
00:44:47,163 --> 00:44:48,363
You know my name?

595
00:44:50,365 --> 00:44:53,165
When someone moves into the
mall who is follically challenged,

596
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:56,924
I make it my business
to know all about them.

597
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:58,078
You're bald.

598
00:45:01,302 --> 00:45:02,502
I know you don't
want to say it.

599
00:45:03,272 --> 00:45:04,870
<i>I'm getting nothing so far.</i>

600
00:45:04,871 --> 00:45:06,097
I think you need
to look around.

601
00:45:14,361 --> 00:45:16,160
Wow, this looks interesting.

602
00:45:16,161 --> 00:45:17,385
What is it?

603
00:45:17,386 --> 00:45:19,012
I take it you're an art lover?

604
00:45:19,013 --> 00:45:19,836
<i>No serum.</i>

605
00:45:19,837 --> 00:45:20,763
Yeah, not so much.

606
00:45:24,927 --> 00:45:27,527
Oh, how about this
impressive trinket?

607
00:45:28,395 --> 00:45:31,294
- I hardly call it trinket, Mr. Gru. International...
- No, thank you.

608
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:32,320
Yeah, I don't care.

609
00:45:40,063 --> 00:45:41,261
<i>Hold on, I'm
picking up something.</i>

610
00:45:41,262 --> 00:45:42,288
<i>Behind that wall!</i>

611
00:45:42,289 --> 00:45:44,012
Ahh... What do we have here?

612
00:45:44,013 --> 00:45:46,138
These are my trial wigs.

613
00:45:46,463 --> 00:45:47,463
You should take one.

614
00:45:47,464 --> 00:45:48,487
No, thanks.

615
00:45:48,488 --> 00:45:49,913
So what's on the other side

616
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,037
of the wall?

617
00:45:51,038 --> 00:45:52,363
You are! Look at me! Focus!

618
00:45:52,788 --> 00:45:53,488
<i>Gru?</i>

619
00:45:53,489 --> 00:45:56,412
I promise, that this
wig will transform you,

620
00:45:56,413 --> 00:46:00,438
from ugly, to irresistible.

621
00:46:01,729 --> 00:46:03,328
Margo has a boyfriend!

622
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:04,854
And they're going on a date!

623
00:46:05,479 --> 00:46:07,679
Date?! Boyfriend?! What?!

624
00:46:20,513 --> 00:46:21,713
There she goes!

625
00:46:33,768 --> 00:46:35,268
Oh, you're so funny.

626
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:36,293
Gross!

627
00:46:36,718 --> 00:46:38,317
Look, they're in love!

628
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:40,600
Oh, no, no. Do not say that
they're--- no, no, no!

629
00:46:41,404 --> 00:46:46,003
And my dream, is to one day,
play video games for a living.

630
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:47,029
Wow!

631
00:46:47,717 --> 00:46:48,917
You're so complicated.

632
00:46:50,025 --> 00:46:51,025
Margo.

633
00:46:51,465 --> 00:46:52,665
What is going on here?

634
00:46:53,252 --> 00:46:54,451
Oh, Gru.

635
00:46:54,452 --> 00:46:56,018
Sellama, Antonio.

636
00:46:56,243 --> 00:46:57,443
Mellamo, Margo.

637
00:46:57,868 --> 00:46:59,467
Mellamo Lama Ding Dong.

638
00:46:59,468 --> 00:47:00,293
Who cares.

639
00:47:00,294 --> 00:47:01,518
Let's go.

640
00:47:32,118 --> 00:47:33,818
Get it free on Tuesdays.

641
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:45,359
Papa!

642
00:47:48,913 --> 00:47:52,113
So good to see you
again, mi compadre!

643
00:47:52,438 --> 00:47:54,838
Oh.. I see you have
already met my father.

644
00:47:55,653 --> 00:47:57,152
What the... father?

645
00:47:57,153 --> 00:48:01,022
Si! Look at this crazy small
world we live in, eh?

646
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:03,348
Come, sit! Let me get
you something.

647
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,280
Oh, look at you!

648
00:48:07,339 --> 00:48:08,138
Ha ha!

649
00:48:08,139 --> 00:48:09,764
He likes me!

650
00:48:11,017 --> 00:48:13,816
Oh... I'm sorry.
Paulito is usually,

651
00:48:13,817 --> 00:48:14,742
very friendly.

652
00:48:15,485 --> 00:48:16,185
He had a rough night.

653
00:48:19,052 --> 00:48:20,251
Ha ha ha...

654
00:48:20,252 --> 00:48:22,076
Well, we really
should be going.

655
00:48:22,077 --> 00:48:23,002
Girls, come on.

656
00:48:23,003 --> 00:48:24,327
That is a pity.

657
00:48:24,752 --> 00:48:27,651
Young love, is beautiful, no?

658
00:48:27,652 --> 00:48:28,896
No!

659
00:48:29,221 --> 00:48:32,221
They are not in love. They
hardly know each other.

660
00:48:33,541 --> 00:48:35,041
You are right,
cabeza del nuevo.

661
00:48:35,466 --> 00:48:37,965
They must get to
know each other better.

662
00:48:37,966 --> 00:48:39,190
Antonio,

663
00:48:39,191 --> 00:48:42,116
Why don't you invite your
girlfriend? And her family.

664
00:48:42,541 --> 00:48:44,240
To our Cinco De Mayo party.

665
00:48:44,241 --> 00:48:45,265
No, no...

666
00:48:45,266 --> 00:48:46,491
Si!

667
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:02,905
I'm sorry, El Macho?

668
00:49:03,452 --> 00:49:07,651
Haven't we eliminated him as a
suspect after the whole "salsa" incident?

669
00:49:07,652 --> 00:49:09,876
Yes, but there has been a new

670
00:49:09,877 --> 00:49:13,102
development, and I'm telling
you, this is the guy.

671
00:49:13,327 --> 00:49:15,527
You need to arrest
him immediately.

672
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:16,951
And!

673
00:49:16,952 --> 00:49:19,176
His deviously charming son.

674
00:49:19,177 --> 00:49:21,902
I'm pretty sure that
the son is involved too.

675
00:49:22,558 --> 00:49:23,758
The son, also!

676
00:49:23,983 --> 00:49:24,983
You got to get the son!

677
00:49:25,308 --> 00:49:28,807
I think that the son
is the mastermind.

678
00:49:28,808 --> 00:49:32,933
There's a look, there's a devilish
look in his eyes, and I don't like it!

679
00:49:33,158 --> 00:49:35,157
Yes, but I don't believe
seeing any evidence...

680
00:49:35,158 --> 00:49:38,382
Evidence, schmevidence, I go with
my gut, and my gut tells me,

681
00:49:38,383 --> 00:49:40,707
that this guy is El Macho.

682
00:49:40,708 --> 00:49:41,633
Lock him up,

683
00:49:42,058 --> 00:49:43,258
lock up the son,

684
00:49:43,683 --> 00:49:44,883
don't forget about the son!

685
00:49:44,884 --> 00:49:47,408
The kid, gives me the creeps!

686
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,880
Oh, dear, oh dear, oh dear...

687
00:49:50,124 --> 00:49:54,324
But, on the less
crazy side of things,

688
00:49:55,321 --> 00:49:58,321
Gru discovered traces of the
serum at Eagle Hair Club!

689
00:49:58,915 --> 00:50:00,514
Hmm. Interesting.

690
00:50:00,515 --> 00:50:02,138
Yeah! And you know who
made that happen?

691
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:02,865
Huh?

692
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:04,690
This guy. Nailed it.

693
00:50:04,915 --> 00:50:05,815
Amazing, right?

694
00:50:05,816 --> 00:50:06,839
No, I mean...

695
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,065
Sure, but it's not him!

696
00:50:08,066 --> 00:50:09,889
It is El Macho...

697
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:11,114
Mr. Gru,

698
00:50:11,115 --> 00:50:12,139
Please...

699
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:14,365
No, it is him and
I will prove it.

700
00:50:16,461 --> 00:50:17,661
Gru, come on.

701
00:50:21,136 --> 00:50:22,936
He really thinks it's El Macho.

702
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:25,533
Can you tell him?

703
00:50:44,188 --> 00:50:47,187
<font color="#00ff40">? In the summer time when the weather is high?</font>

704
00:50:47,188 --> 00:50:50,413
<font color="#00ff40">? You can stretch right up and touch the sky?</font>

705
00:50:51,319 --> 00:50:54,019
<font color="#00ff40">? We go fishin' or go swimmin' in the sea?</font>

706
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,640
<font color="#00ff40">? We're always happy?</font>

707
00:50:57,065 --> 00:50:59,465
<font color="#00ff40">? Life's for livin' yeah, that's our philosophy?</font>

708
00:51:01,696 --> 00:51:02,994
<font color="#00ff40">? Sing along with us?</font>

709
00:51:02,995 --> 00:51:04,219
<font color="#00ff40">? Dee dee dee-dee dee?</font>

710
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,744
<font color="#00ff40">? Dah dah dah-dah dah?</font>

711
00:51:05,745 --> 00:51:06,971
<font color="#00ff40">? Yeah we're hap-happy?</font>

712
00:51:07,196 --> 00:51:08,896
<font color="#00ff40">? Dah dah-dah?</font>

713
00:51:08,897 --> 00:51:12,121
<font color="#00ff40">? Dee-dah-do dee-dah-do dah-do-dah?</font>

714
00:51:13,267 --> 00:51:15,467
<font color="#00ff40">? Dah-do-dah-dah-dah?</font>

715
00:51:29,145 --> 00:51:29,945
Give me that!

716
00:51:37,443 --> 00:51:37,943
Huuu...

717
00:51:37,944 --> 00:51:38,867
Kevin,

718
00:51:38,868 --> 00:51:40,093
the wi-fi's out!

719
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:42,579
Kevin?

720
00:51:43,104 --> 00:51:44,303
Hey, Lex,

721
00:51:44,304 --> 00:51:45,529
Where the heck is Kevin?

722
00:51:47,065 --> 00:51:51,364
Alright, we need to revisit the
number of vacation days you guys get.

723
00:51:51,365 --> 00:51:53,290
I can't find anybody anymore!

724
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:56,390
Gru, it's Jillian!

725
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:59,310
I've got good news!

726
00:51:59,735 --> 00:52:01,834
I have my friend
Shannon here with me.

727
00:52:01,835 --> 00:52:04,059
I was thinking you two
could get some grub.

728
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:05,283
You know, tear it up,

729
00:52:05,284 --> 00:52:06,510
see what happens.

730
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,360
Open up!

731
00:52:09,885 --> 00:52:11,684
Agnes! Agnes,

732
00:52:11,685 --> 00:52:13,510
tell Jillian, I'm not here.

733
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:15,501
Gru's not here!

734
00:52:15,502 --> 00:52:17,126
Are you sure?

735
00:52:17,351 --> 00:52:19,051
Yes, he just told me!

736
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:23,471
I mean no, he
didn't just tell me.

737
00:52:24,796 --> 00:52:26,513
Agnes, where is Gru?

738
00:52:28,255 --> 00:52:29,655
He's, putting on lipstick.

739
00:52:31,531 --> 00:52:32,931
He's, swatting a fly.

740
00:52:34,403 --> 00:52:36,303
He's, chopping a head off!

741
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:40,001
He's... pooping?

742
00:52:41,331 --> 00:52:43,230
I know you're in there, Gru.

743
00:52:43,231 --> 00:52:45,256
There's no way you're
getting out of this.

744
00:52:51,886 --> 00:52:55,085
I have to tell you I was
so nervous about tonight.

745
00:52:55,086 --> 00:52:58,011
I mean there's just so
many phonies out there.

746
00:52:59,372 --> 00:53:00,572
Yes, I hear you.

747
00:53:00,573 --> 00:53:01,797
Ha..ha..ha..

748
00:53:03,351 --> 00:53:04,950
So, do you work out?

749
00:53:04,951 --> 00:53:05,674
Well...

750
00:53:05,675 --> 00:53:06,901
I mean, obviously you don't.

751
00:53:06,902 --> 00:53:08,626
But would you consider it?

752
00:53:08,851 --> 00:53:09,551
Huh?

753
00:53:09,552 --> 00:53:12,076
Physical fitness is very
important to Shannon.

754
00:53:12,401 --> 00:53:14,101
As you can tell, right?

755
00:53:16,104 --> 00:53:17,304
Ah, I can tell.

756
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,060
Call it!

757
00:53:19,061 --> 00:53:20,342
We are in a restaurant,

758
00:53:20,567 --> 00:53:21,767
you know?

759
00:53:23,577 --> 00:53:24,777
Hi, take out for Lucy.

760
00:53:25,115 --> 00:53:26,115
Sure, just a sec.

761
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,819
Ah..well, thank you very much.

762
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:44,443
I was...

763
00:53:44,444 --> 00:53:45,970
I know someone who
can fix that for you.

764
00:53:45,971 --> 00:53:48,195
And you'll be talking
normal in no time!

765
00:53:50,845 --> 00:53:53,045
Whew... Is it hot in here?

766
00:53:55,282 --> 00:53:56,982
How's the food?

767
00:53:58,114 --> 00:53:59,214
Wait a minute, wait a minute...

768
00:53:59,215 --> 00:54:01,739
Are you wearing a wig?

769
00:54:02,102 --> 00:54:02,901
What?

770
00:54:02,902 --> 00:54:05,026
Ah, I don't think so.

771
00:54:05,027 --> 00:54:06,251
I knew it.

772
00:54:06,252 --> 00:54:07,475
You're a phony.

773
00:54:07,476 --> 00:54:08,502
I hate phonies.

774
00:54:08,503 --> 00:54:10,526
Oh... what? No, these
locks are all mine!

775
00:54:10,527 --> 00:54:11,752
No, they're not!

776
00:54:12,324 --> 00:54:13,524
You know what I'm gonna do?

777
00:54:13,525 --> 00:54:15,548
I'm gonna rip that
thing off your head

778
00:54:15,549 --> 00:54:16,774
and show everyone what

779
00:54:16,775 --> 00:54:18,598
a bald-headed phony you are.

780
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:19,866
I don't think so, Miss Lady.

781
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:30,910
Hello?

782
00:54:31,154 --> 00:54:32,052
Hello...

783
00:54:32,053 --> 00:54:32,577
Are you...

784
00:54:32,578 --> 00:54:33,504
Hey, Gru.

785
00:54:33,505 --> 00:54:34,328
Hello!

786
00:54:34,329 --> 00:54:35,353
Lucy.

787
00:54:35,354 --> 00:54:36,579
How are you doing?

788
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:38,704
Wow, looks like your
date's out for the count.

789
00:54:39,266 --> 00:54:41,566
It's like she's been shot
with a mild tranquilizer.

790
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:44,033
Noooo...

791
00:54:48,257 --> 00:54:50,257
Yeah, I'm winking 'cause
that's what actually happened.

792
00:54:51,169 --> 00:54:53,168
Excusi, what's happening here?

793
00:54:53,169 --> 00:54:54,193
She no like?

794
00:54:54,194 --> 00:54:55,419
Oh, she's just, uhh...

795
00:54:57,608 --> 00:54:59,308
Oh.. Oh-ho-ho.. Si! Si.

796
00:55:00,846 --> 00:55:02,046
Shall we take her home?

797
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:45,839
Yeah, I think you did it.

798
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,766
You just officially had
the worst date ever.

799
00:55:48,295 --> 00:55:49,495
Ohh. Tell me about it.

800
00:55:49,966 --> 00:55:51,165
Don't worry.

801
00:55:51,166 --> 00:55:52,891
It can never get
better from here, right?

802
00:55:53,403 --> 00:55:55,501
But if it doesn't, you can
always borrow my dart gun.

803
00:55:55,502 --> 00:55:57,428
I do use it on, one
or two dates myself.

804
00:55:57,949 --> 00:55:59,749
Yeah, you know
as far as dates go,

805
00:56:00,548 --> 00:56:02,448
I think I'm good
with just, one.

806
00:56:06,409 --> 00:56:07,609
Well...

807
00:56:08,328 --> 00:56:09,228
Good night, partner.

808
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:13,058
This was fun.

809
00:56:13,059 --> 00:56:15,284
Yes, surprisingly, it was.

810
00:56:16,621 --> 00:56:17,519
Oh, and, uhh...

811
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,807
Just between you and me,

812
00:56:19,664 --> 00:56:20,864
You look much better bald.

813
00:56:23,886 --> 00:56:25,086
See you tomorrow!

814
00:56:28,574 --> 00:56:31,274
<font color="#00ff40">? It might seem crazy what I'm about to say?</font>

815
00:56:34,484 --> 00:56:37,184
<font color="#00ff40">? Sunshine she's here, you can take away?</font>

816
00:56:40,372 --> 00:56:42,970
<font color="#00ff40">? I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space?</font>

817
00:56:42,971 --> 00:56:44,197
So, I take it the
date went well?

818
00:56:44,198 --> 00:56:46,322
No, it was horrible.

819
00:56:46,647 --> 00:56:48,847
<font color="#00ff40">? Like I don't care baby by the way?</font>

820
00:56:51,463 --> 00:56:52,463
<font color="#00ff40">? Because I'm happy?</font>

821
00:56:52,464 --> 00:56:56,687
<font color="#00ff40">? Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof?</font>

822
00:56:56,688 --> 00:57:02,912
<font color="#00ff40">? Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth?</font>

823
00:57:02,913 --> 00:57:09,137
<font color="#00ff40">? Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you?</font>

824
00:57:09,138 --> 00:57:15,363
<font color="#00ff40">? Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do?</font>

825
00:57:16,746 --> 00:57:20,946
<font color="#00ff40">? Bring me down Bring your Mocking
Bring me Down?</font>

826
00:57:27,246 --> 00:57:33,445
<font color="#00ff40">? Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof?</font>

827
00:57:33,446 --> 00:57:39,671
<font color="#00ff40">? Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what's best what you wanna do?</font>

828
00:57:44,362 --> 00:57:46,261
Mr. Ramsbottom?

829
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:47,487
Oh, hello.

830
00:57:47,712 --> 00:57:48,912
What are you doing here?

831
00:57:48,913 --> 00:57:50,036
We got him.

832
00:57:50,037 --> 00:57:51,279
Got who?

833
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,505
Floyd Eagle-san.

834
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:55,729
Our agents located a secret
room in his shop last night,

835
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:56,553
and, uh,

836
00:57:56,554 --> 00:57:57,780
discovered this.

837
00:57:57,781 --> 00:58:01,205
It's empty but we found
traces of the PX-41 serum in it.

838
00:58:02,321 --> 00:58:03,521
He is our man.

839
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:07,745
So, somehow, in spite of your
incompetence, we solved this one.

840
00:58:07,746 --> 00:58:08,971
I was framed!

841
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:10,950
You won't get away with this!

842
00:58:11,175 --> 00:58:12,375
Get your mitts off of me!

843
00:58:13,874 --> 00:58:14,474
AH..

844
00:58:15,308 --> 00:58:16,208
Alright, so...

845
00:58:16,209 --> 00:58:17,432
What now?

846
00:58:17,433 --> 00:58:20,457
Well, now, you're free to
go back to your business.

847
00:58:20,458 --> 00:58:22,983
Hmmm! Jams and jellies.

848
00:58:23,554 --> 00:58:27,254
And it looks like Agent Wilde will be
transferring to our Australian branch.

849
00:58:28,434 --> 00:58:29,633
Australia?

850
00:58:29,634 --> 00:58:30,359
Yes.

851
00:58:30,684 --> 00:58:32,184
But thank you, for everything.

852
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:34,709
And by everything, of
course I mean, nothing.

853
00:58:35,724 --> 00:58:37,524
Toodles and cheerio, Mr. Gru.

854
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,519
Hey there.

855
00:58:43,844 --> 00:58:44,544
Hey.

856
00:58:44,545 --> 00:58:45,968
So, we got him.

857
00:58:45,969 --> 00:58:46,894
Yay!

858
00:58:47,219 --> 00:58:48,419
That's great.

859
00:58:49,487 --> 00:58:50,987
And now you're
going to Australia?

860
00:58:51,563 --> 00:58:52,761
Well, it's not definite yet.

861
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:53,988
I'm still figuring it out.

862
00:58:54,413 --> 00:58:56,113
Already been working
on my accent.

863
00:59:01,773 --> 00:59:03,373
So, umm...

864
00:59:04,228 --> 00:59:05,428
Pretty excited.

865
00:59:06,145 --> 00:59:07,345
Great.

866
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:09,870
Well, good luck.

867
00:59:10,195 --> 00:59:11,095
Thanks.

868
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,520
You, too.

869
00:59:14,022 --> 00:59:16,522
Oh, here. I wanted
to give you this.

870
00:59:16,847 --> 00:59:18,047
Your lipstick taser?

871
00:59:18,372 --> 00:59:20,272
Yeah, it's just a memento.

872
00:59:20,497 --> 00:59:22,296
Just.. you know.

873
00:59:22,297 --> 00:59:24,122
From, the first time we met.

874
00:59:24,739 --> 00:59:26,939
Oh. Thank you, Lucy.

875
00:59:27,998 --> 00:59:29,198
Agent Wilde?

876
00:59:29,936 --> 00:59:32,135
Well, it looks like
they need you.

877
00:59:32,136 --> 00:59:33,060
So...

878
00:59:33,061 --> 00:59:33,985
Yeah...

879
00:59:33,986 --> 00:59:35,211
I better go.

880
00:59:36,942 --> 00:59:38,142
Bye, Gru.

881
01:00:14,852 --> 01:00:16,052
I brought you an umbrella.

882
01:00:20,786 --> 01:00:21,584
Ah, thank you.

883
01:00:21,585 --> 01:00:22,811
What are you doing out here?

884
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:27,321
Remember when you
said that I liked Lucy?

885
01:00:28,763 --> 01:00:30,963
Well, it turns out...

886
01:00:32,181 --> 01:00:33,381
You are right.

887
01:00:33,806 --> 01:00:34,805
Really?

888
01:00:34,806 --> 01:00:36,231
Yes, but...

889
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,600
Well, she's moving away.

890
01:00:39,648 --> 01:00:41,448
I'm never going to
see her again.

891
01:00:46,121 --> 01:00:47,921
Is there anything
I can do to help?

892
01:00:48,825 --> 01:00:50,025
I don't...

893
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:52,050
I don't think so, sweetheart.

894
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:55,518
Well is there anything
you could do?

895
01:00:57,753 --> 01:00:59,653
Hello, Lucy. This is Gru.

896
01:01:00,582 --> 01:01:01,382
I know...

897
01:01:01,383 --> 01:01:05,107
Up to this point, our relationship
has been strictly professional.

898
01:01:06,137 --> 01:01:08,736
And you're leaving
for Australia and all...

899
01:01:08,737 --> 01:01:09,962
But...

900
01:01:10,826 --> 01:01:13,026
Okay, here is the question.

901
01:01:13,748 --> 01:01:14,948
Would you like to...

902
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:19,220
To go out on a date...

903
01:01:20,557 --> 01:01:21,757
Ayyy... No.

904
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:23,819
Okay, that's not helping.

905
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:25,810
Alright. Here we go.

906
01:01:26,035 --> 01:01:27,235
For real this time.

907
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:38,939
I can do this.

908
01:01:57,624 --> 01:01:58,824
I hate you.

909
01:02:11,457 --> 01:02:12,655
Be... Dow Be... Dow
Be... Dow Be... Dow

910
01:02:12,656 --> 01:02:13,880
Be... Dow Be... Dow
Be... Dow Be... Dow

911
01:02:13,881 --> 01:02:15,107
Be... Dow Be... Dow
Be... Dow Be... Dow

912
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,878
Be... Dow Be... Dow
Be... Dow Be... Dow

913
01:02:23,879 --> 01:02:25,605
Be... Dow Be... Dow
Be... Dow Be... Dow

914
01:02:28,822 --> 01:02:30,322
Be... Dow Be... Dow
Be... Dow Be... Dow

915
01:02:30,323 --> 01:02:31,547
Be...

916
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:43,999
This place is awesome!

917
01:03:47,082 --> 01:03:48,282
Okay, let's party!

918
01:03:49,754 --> 01:03:51,654
But, first, let us go
over the rules!

919
01:03:52,167 --> 01:03:55,066
Because, what is fun
without the rules.

920
01:03:55,067 --> 01:03:57,077
Agnes, easy on the chocolate.

921
01:03:57,502 --> 01:03:59,402
Edith, try to not kill anyone.

922
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:00,826
Margo,

923
01:04:00,827 --> 01:04:02,052
Hello, Mr. Gru.

924
01:04:02,053 --> 01:04:03,277
Argh.. okay.

925
01:04:04,498 --> 01:04:05,697
Gru!

926
01:04:05,698 --> 01:04:07,923
There must be a
standard 6 feet of space,

927
01:04:08,248 --> 01:04:09,947
between you and boys.

928
01:04:09,948 --> 01:04:11,773
Especially this boy.

929
01:04:13,604 --> 01:04:15,303
Ah, you are a funny man.

930
01:04:15,304 --> 01:04:16,828
There are no rules, seor.

931
01:04:16,829 --> 01:04:18,154
It's Cinco De Mayo!

932
01:04:18,379 --> 01:04:19,779
Come on! Let's party and relax!

933
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:22,782
So glad you could
make it, mi compadre!

934
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:25,490
Hey, what's wrong?

935
01:05:25,491 --> 01:05:27,714
Oh, nothing. Nothing's wrong.

936
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:28,940
I'm just chilling.

937
01:05:28,941 --> 01:05:30,165
With the guac,

938
01:05:30,667 --> 01:05:31,867
from my chip hat.

939
01:05:34,987 --> 01:05:36,186
Gru, please.

940
01:05:36,187 --> 01:05:37,412
I know that look

941
01:05:37,413 --> 01:05:40,637
all too well. It is the
look of a broken heart.

942
01:05:41,436 --> 01:05:42,634
How did you know?

943
01:05:42,635 --> 01:05:43,861
Believe me, my friend.

944
01:05:44,153 --> 01:05:46,053
I, too, have spent many nights

945
01:05:46,278 --> 01:05:48,577
trying to drown my sorrows,

946
01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:49,803
in Guacamole.

947
01:05:50,128 --> 01:05:51,327
You?

948
01:05:51,328 --> 01:05:51,828
Yes.

949
01:05:53,178 --> 01:05:53,778
But,

950
01:05:54,203 --> 01:05:55,403
we are survivors.

951
01:05:56,496 --> 01:05:57,696
There is much more to us,

952
01:05:58,021 --> 01:05:59,221
than meets the eye.

953
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:02,190
Enjoy the party.

954
01:07:41,755 --> 01:07:42,955
What?

955
01:07:55,785 --> 01:07:58,485
Would you like some
peanuts or pretzels?

956
01:08:01,871 --> 01:08:03,071
Ha..ha..ha...

957
01:08:03,396 --> 01:08:05,296
That's a good joke.

958
01:08:09,644 --> 01:08:11,244
I just did a boom-boom.

959
01:08:13,515 --> 01:08:15,615
I really need you to
make a choice now.

960
01:08:17,092 --> 01:08:18,592
I choose Gru.

961
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,570
I choose Gru!

962
01:08:25,409 --> 01:08:27,209
Thank you, Gru stewardess!

963
01:08:27,434 --> 01:08:29,234
You're welcome!

964
01:09:02,329 --> 01:09:05,129
You have not lost
your touch, my friend.

965
01:09:05,884 --> 01:09:06,883
Ah-ha!

966
01:09:06,884 --> 01:09:08,109
I knew it!

967
01:09:08,772 --> 01:09:09,972
You are El Macho.

968
01:09:09,973 --> 01:09:11,497
That's right!

969
01:09:12,506 --> 01:09:13,905
Nobody believed me!

970
01:09:13,906 --> 01:09:16,031
But I knew you weren't dead.

971
01:09:17,559 --> 01:09:18,558
Of course not.

972
01:09:18,559 --> 01:09:20,384
I merely faked my death.

973
01:09:21,629 --> 01:09:22,828
But now...

974
01:09:22,829 --> 01:09:23,954
It's time for me,

975
01:09:23,955 --> 01:09:26,678
to make a spectacular return

976
01:09:26,679 --> 01:09:27,904
to evil.

977
01:09:28,619 --> 01:09:29,418
Doctor!

978
01:09:29,419 --> 01:09:30,644
I think it's time,

979
01:09:30,869 --> 01:09:32,069
to show Gru,

980
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:33,700
what we're up to here?

981
01:09:34,138 --> 01:09:35,338
Dr. Nefario?

982
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:37,409
Nice to see you, Gru!

983
01:09:39,013 --> 01:09:42,613
Whaaa... So this is
your new job opportunity?

984
01:09:43,271 --> 01:09:44,470
Absolutely.

985
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:45,696
You're gonna like this.

986
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:54,070
Sorry. I had to borrow
some of your minions,

987
01:09:54,395 --> 01:09:55,995
but it was for a worthy cause.

988
01:09:56,645 --> 01:09:57,845
Oooh.. Kevin!

989
01:09:59,335 --> 01:10:01,335
No, he is not Kevin anymore!

990
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:02,809
Now...

991
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:04,535
He is an indestructible,

992
01:10:04,773 --> 01:10:05,573
mindless,

993
01:10:05,898 --> 01:10:07,098
killing machine!

994
01:10:08,505 --> 01:10:09,705
Just watch this.

995
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:26,390
And here's the best part:

996
01:10:26,715 --> 01:10:29,215
I got an army of them!

997
01:10:42,843 --> 01:10:43,642
Soon,

998
01:10:43,643 --> 01:10:44,868
I will unleash them,

999
01:10:44,869 --> 01:10:46,093
on the world!

1000
01:10:46,418 --> 01:10:47,618
And if anyone,

1001
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:49,943
anyone tries to stop them...

1002
01:10:52,216 --> 01:10:54,416
The city gets eaten!

1003
01:10:55,059 --> 01:10:56,758
We can do it together!

1004
01:10:56,759 --> 01:10:57,983
Together?

1005
01:10:57,984 --> 01:10:59,209
Together!

1006
01:10:59,534 --> 01:11:02,533
I have admired your
work for years, amigo.

1007
01:11:02,534 --> 01:11:04,458
Stealing the moon?

1008
01:11:04,459 --> 01:11:05,684
Are you kidding?

1009
01:11:05,909 --> 01:11:07,609
We would be unstoppable.

1010
01:11:08,352 --> 01:11:09,552
Men like you,

1011
01:11:09,777 --> 01:11:10,977
men like me...

1012
01:11:11,178 --> 01:11:14,178
We, should be ruling the world!

1013
01:11:15,454 --> 01:11:16,654
So, are you in?

1014
01:11:17,627 --> 01:11:18,826
Woo-hoo!

1015
01:11:18,827 --> 01:11:20,652
Oh, yeah! Probably.

1016
01:11:21,673 --> 01:11:22,872
Probably?

1017
01:11:22,873 --> 01:11:25,597
I mean, yes! Yes,
Of course, yes.

1018
01:11:25,598 --> 01:11:27,623
I just, have a lot
going on right now.

1019
01:11:28,475 --> 01:11:30,974
I just need to get
some things off my plate,

1020
01:11:30,975 --> 01:11:34,200
before we start taking
over the world, that's all.

1021
01:11:34,736 --> 01:11:35,636
Excuse me?

1022
01:11:35,637 --> 01:11:39,661
No, no, forget it.
100%, I am in.

1023
01:11:40,086 --> 01:11:42,185
I think, what is that?
Do you hear that?

1024
01:11:42,186 --> 01:11:46,397
I do. That's Agnes
calling me, from undis---

1025
01:11:49,582 --> 01:11:50,782
Totally in!

1026
01:11:52,707 --> 01:11:55,907
You know what? I am not
so convinced that he is in.

1027
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:10,640
Edith, Agnes, come on!

1028
01:12:10,641 --> 01:12:11,665
Oops, sorry!

1029
01:12:11,666 --> 01:12:12,789
You need to go home now!

1030
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:14,016
Where is Margo?

1031
01:12:21,953 --> 01:12:23,152
Margo!

1032
01:12:23,153 --> 01:12:24,378
Come on! We're...

1033
01:12:25,926 --> 01:12:26,926
Hey, what's wrong?

1034
01:12:27,246 --> 01:12:28,446
I hate boys.

1035
01:12:31,904 --> 01:12:33,104
Yes, they stink.

1036
01:12:33,707 --> 01:12:35,907
Now, sorry, honey,
you got to go.

1037
01:12:59,454 --> 01:13:00,253
Oops...

1038
01:13:00,254 --> 01:13:01,479
Sorry.

1039
01:13:12,467 --> 01:13:13,667
Hey, Paulito.

1040
01:13:13,992 --> 01:13:15,190
What's the matter?

1041
01:13:15,191 --> 01:13:16,417
Oh, hey, Eduardo.

1042
01:13:16,418 --> 01:13:17,241
Lucia.

1043
01:13:17,242 --> 01:13:20,567
I apologize. Paulito, is
usually not like this.

1044
01:13:21,229 --> 01:13:23,729
The same thing happened
the other day with...

1045
01:13:24,747 --> 01:13:25,947
With Gru...

1046
01:13:27,785 --> 01:13:28,684
Oh...

1047
01:13:28,685 --> 01:13:29,510
Speaking of Gru,

1048
01:13:29,511 --> 01:13:31,034
have you seen him?

1049
01:13:31,035 --> 01:13:32,260
I really need to talk to him.

1050
01:13:32,585 --> 01:13:35,285
Yes, I think he's
somewhere around here.

1051
01:13:35,969 --> 01:13:37,469
You two are close, no?

1052
01:13:37,694 --> 01:13:38,894
Oh... I don't know.

1053
01:13:39,514 --> 01:13:42,813
I mean, close,
I wouldn't say we're, "close".

1054
01:13:42,814 --> 01:13:44,037
Why, did he say we're close?

1055
01:13:44,038 --> 01:13:45,064
Did he say that?

1056
01:13:45,065 --> 01:13:46,989
It's not what he did say.

1057
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:48,998
For instance,

1058
01:13:49,509 --> 01:13:50,709
he never mentioned...

1059
01:13:50,710 --> 01:13:53,434
That you were both working
for the Anti-Villain League!

1060
01:13:55,323 --> 01:13:56,523
You're coming with me.

1061
01:13:59,273 --> 01:14:00,473
Funky.

1062
01:14:07,055 --> 01:14:09,255
So Eduardo's actually El Macho?

1063
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,479
Cool!

1064
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,004
No, it is not cool!

1065
01:14:12,005 --> 01:14:14,230
Once I pretty much knew
it was him all along,

1066
01:14:14,539 --> 01:14:16,139
so if anyone's cool, it's me.

1067
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:19,759
Gru!

1068
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,385
Well, Dr. Nefario.

1069
01:14:21,810 --> 01:14:22,810
El Macho's onto you.

1070
01:14:23,035 --> 01:14:24,435
He knows you're
working for the AVL.

1071
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:26,260
And, he's got your partner.

1072
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,254
Lucy?

1073
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:30,179
Well, that's, impossible.

1074
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:31,804
She's on her way to Australia.

1075
01:14:31,805 --> 01:14:33,029
Nefario!

1076
01:14:33,030 --> 01:14:34,255
Sorry, got to go.

1077
01:14:35,981 --> 01:14:37,181
He's got Lucy?

1078
01:14:38,667 --> 01:14:39,867
Not for long.

1079
01:14:40,092 --> 01:14:40,890
Come on.

1080
01:14:40,891 --> 01:14:42,117
We're getting her out of there.

1081
01:16:23,777 --> 01:16:24,977
I don't see anything.

1082
01:16:40,821 --> 01:16:42,020
My unicorn!

1083
01:16:42,021 --> 01:16:43,246
Agnes, run!

1084
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:18,750
Come on! Hurry!

1085
01:17:18,751 --> 01:17:19,975
Move!

1086
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,560
What's the matter?

1087
01:17:44,741 --> 01:17:45,941
Kevin!

1088
01:17:48,674 --> 01:17:50,174
Dr. Nefario! You're back!

1089
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:51,799
In the flesh!

1090
01:17:53,038 --> 01:17:54,237
Behold...

1091
01:17:54,238 --> 01:17:55,463
The Antidote.

1092
01:17:58,818 --> 01:17:59,718
Come on.

1093
01:17:59,719 --> 01:18:02,243
It's time we put this horrible
jelly to some good use.

1094
01:19:02,152 --> 01:19:03,351
Curses!

1095
01:19:03,352 --> 01:19:04,576
Foiled again!

1096
01:19:04,577 --> 01:19:06,902
These guys captured me!

1097
01:21:00,826 --> 01:21:02,025
Hello, Gru!

1098
01:21:02,026 --> 01:21:05,251
Hey! Nice work, Dr. Nefario!

1099
01:21:06,368 --> 01:21:07,768
All antidote in the jelly can.

1100
01:21:08,953 --> 01:21:11,953
I mean, I'm happy to create an
evil army to destroy the world...

1101
01:21:12,278 --> 01:21:14,878
But nobody messes
with my family.

1102
01:21:15,641 --> 01:21:16,841
Thank you, Doctor.

1103
01:21:17,764 --> 01:21:19,264
Now let's go get the...

1104
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:21,949
Hi!

1105
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:23,613
You brought the girls?

1106
01:21:24,336 --> 01:21:24,836
Yes.

1107
01:21:25,561 --> 01:21:27,761
Oh. Is that wrong?

1108
01:21:43,557 --> 01:21:45,857
You guys, take care of the rest
of the minions. I'm going to find Lucy.

1109
01:21:58,745 --> 01:22:01,245
Eat jelly, you furry freaks!

1110
01:22:30,833 --> 01:22:32,033
It's over, El Macho.

1111
01:22:32,731 --> 01:22:33,931
Now where is Lucy?

1112
01:22:35,406 --> 01:22:36,606
Let me show you.

1113
01:22:49,344 --> 01:22:50,543
Oh. Hey, Gru!

1114
01:22:50,544 --> 01:22:53,669
Turns out you were right
about the Polo Macho thing, huh?

1115
01:22:55,863 --> 01:22:57,787
One push of this button,

1116
01:22:57,788 --> 01:23:00,012
and I send that rocket,

1117
01:23:00,013 --> 01:23:03,838
straight into the same volcano
where I faked my death.

1118
01:23:04,539 --> 01:23:05,739
Only this time...

1119
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:06,963
It's for real.

1120
01:23:06,964 --> 01:23:08,189
No!

1121
01:23:19,137 --> 01:23:22,337
We coulda ruled the
world together, Gru.

1122
01:23:23,281 --> 01:23:24,481
But now...

1123
01:23:24,843 --> 01:23:26,043
You're gonna die.

1124
01:24:38,989 --> 01:24:41,189
Lipstick taser!

1125
01:24:41,915 --> 01:24:43,815
Aww. He copied me.

1126
01:24:50,236 --> 01:24:52,236
I am not afraid,

1127
01:24:52,789 --> 01:24:53,989
of your jelly guns.

1128
01:24:54,514 --> 01:24:56,714
Oh, this ain't a
jelly gun, Sunshine.

1129
01:25:11,903 --> 01:25:13,703
Don't worry about
me, Gru, I'll be fine!

1130
01:25:14,482 --> 01:25:16,282
I have survived locks
worse than this.

1131
01:25:17,126 --> 01:25:18,224
Okay, that's not entirely true.

1132
01:25:18,225 --> 01:25:19,651
Actually I'm kinda
freaking out up here!

1133
01:25:20,322 --> 01:25:22,322
Don't worry. I will get
you out of this.

1134
01:25:28,148 --> 01:25:29,348
Hah! Hah!

1135
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:32,625
I really hate that chicken.

1136
01:25:54,418 --> 01:25:55,618
Yoohoo!

1137
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:00,350
Is that a red one?
It's definitely the red one!

1138
01:26:02,945 --> 01:26:03,844
Gru!

1139
01:26:03,845 --> 01:26:05,070
Any time now!

1140
01:26:07,963 --> 01:26:09,863
Lucy, we may not
get out of this alive.

1141
01:26:09,864 --> 01:26:11,987
So, I need to ask
you a question.

1142
01:26:11,988 --> 01:26:13,213
Uhh... Better make it quick!

1143
01:26:14,216 --> 01:26:15,915
If I asked you out on a date,

1144
01:26:15,916 --> 01:26:17,141
What would you have said?

1145
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:19,290
Are you kidding me?

1146
01:26:19,291 --> 01:26:20,515
Yes!

1147
01:26:22,688 --> 01:26:23,888
Jump!

1148
01:26:36,596 --> 01:26:37,796
Lucy?

1149
01:26:38,629 --> 01:26:40,129
Lucy, where are you?

1150
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:44,970
Ah... Lucy!

1151
01:26:45,908 --> 01:26:47,108
Gru!!

1152
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:52,399
Sorry.

1153
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,525
Guess you, kinda need your
arms to tread water, huh?

1154
01:27:03,666 --> 01:27:04,866
They'll be back.

1155
01:27:06,910 --> 01:27:10,210
<b><i>147 dates later...</i></b>

1156
01:28:10,425 --> 01:28:12,325
Oh...!

1157
01:28:16,824 --> 01:28:18,024
Can I be the first to say,

1158
01:28:18,249 --> 01:28:19,449
Eww!

1159
01:28:39,184 --> 01:28:40,384
Okay.

1160
01:28:41,670 --> 01:28:42,870
Excuse me!

1161
01:28:44,841 --> 01:28:46,041
Hi, excuse me.

1162
01:28:55,636 --> 01:28:56,836
Hi, everybody.

1163
01:28:57,061 --> 01:28:58,261
I'd like to make some toast...

1164

01:29:04,316 --> 01:29:05,515
