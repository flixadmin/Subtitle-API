1
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,440
ANCIENT ONE: Master Kaecilius.

2
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,360
That ritual will bring you only sorrow.

3
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,600
Hypocrite!

4
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,360
Challenge round, Billy.

5
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,400
Oh, come on, Billy, you've got
to be messing with me.

6
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,920
No, doctor.

7
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,040
Feels So Good, Chuck Mangione, 1977.

8
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,800
Honestly, Billy, you said
this one would be hard.

9
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,920
-Ha! It's 1978.
-No, Billy.

10
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,520
While Feels So Good
may have charted in 1978...

11
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,120
the album was released
in December of 1977.

12
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,880
No. Wikipedia says it's a nineteen...

13
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Check again.

14
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,240
DOCTOR GARRISON:
Where do you store

15
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,360
all this useless information?

16
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
DOCTOR STRANGE: Useless?

17
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,200
The man charted a top 10 hit
with a flugelhorn.

18
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
Status, Billy?

19
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,480
BILLY: 1977.

20
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,840
DOCTOR GARRISON: Oh, please.
BRUNER: I hate you.

21
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,120
DOCTOR STRANGE: Oh!

22
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,120
Feels so good, doesn't it?

23
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,320
Oh, I got this, Stephen.

24
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,240
You've done your bit.
Go ahead. We'll close up.

25
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,320
What is it?

26
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,600
GSW.

27
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,160
It's amazing you kept him alive.

28
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,800
Apneic, failed the brain stem test...

29
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,280
and the apnea reflex test.

30
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,000
I think I found the problem,
Doctor Palmer.

31
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,720
You left a bullet in his head.

32
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,400
Thanks. It's impinging on the medulla.

33
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,000
I needed a specialist.
Nic diagnosed brain death.

34
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,840
Something about that
doesn't feel right to me.

35
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,960
We have to run.

36
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,480
CHRISTINE: Doctor West.

37
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,000
What are you doing? Hey.

38
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,480
Organ harvest. He's a donor.

39
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,080
Slow down. I did not agree to that.

40
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,280
I don't need you to.
We've already called brain death.

41
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,440
Prematurely.
We need to get him prepped

42
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,560
for sub-occipital craniotomy.

43
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,480
Not gonna let you operate
on a dead man.

44
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,000
What do you see?

45
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,040
-A bullet?
-A perfect bullet.

46
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,960
It's been hardened. You harden a bullet
by alloying lead with antimony.

47
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,760
A toxic metal. And that's leeched
directly into the cerebral spinal fluid.

48
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,600
Rapid onset central
nervous system shutdown.

49
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
We gotta go.

50
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,280
The patient's not dead, but he is dying.

51
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,760
Still want to harvest his organs?

52
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,200
-I'll assist you.
-DOCTOR STRANGE: No.

53
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,320
Doctor Palmer will assist me.

54
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,120
Thank you.

55
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,400
Image guidance, stat.

56
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,040
We don't have time for that.

57
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
You can't do it freehand.

58
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,200
I can and I will.

59
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,120
This isn't a time
for showing off, Strange.

60
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
How about 10 minutes ago

61
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,040
when you called
the wrong time of death?

62
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,560
Cranial nerves intact.

63
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,880
Doctor West, cover your watch.

64
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,240
You know, you didn't have to
humiliate him in front of everyone.

65
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,800
I didn't have to save his patient, either.

66
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,600
But I sometimes just can't help myself.

67
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,080
Nic is a great doctor.

68
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,320
You came to me.

69
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,800
Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.

70
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,960
You had a second opinion.

71
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,440
What you needed was a competent one.

72
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,600
Well, all the more reason

73
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,760
why you should be
my neurosurgeon on call.

74
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,280
You could make such a difference.

75
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,960
I can't work in your butcher shop.

76
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,120
Hey!

77
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,280
I'm fusing transected spinal cords.

78
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,560
I'm stimulating neurogenesis
in the central nervous system.

79
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,920
The work I'm doing is gonna save
thousands for years to come.

80
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,440
In ER, you get to save
one drunk idiot with a gun.

81
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,560
Yeah, you're right.

82
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,080
In ER, we're only saving lives.

83
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,960
There's no fame, there's no, uh,

84
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,720
-CNN interviews.
-

85
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,680
I guess I'll just have to stick with Nic.

86
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,800
Whoa, wait a minute.

87
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,160
You're not... You guys aren't...

88
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,480
What?

89
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,320
Sleeping together? Sorry, I thought
that was implicit in my disgust.

90
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,920
Explicit, actually.

91
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,280
No, I have a very strict rule
against dating colleagues.

92
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
Oh, really?

93
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,520
I call it the "Strange Policy."

94
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,120
Oh, well, good, I'm glad
something's named after me.

95
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,560
I invented a laminectomy procedure.

96
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,360
And yet, somehow no one seems to want
to call it the "Strange Technique."

97
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,080
We invented that technique.

98
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,640
Regardless, I'm very flattered
by your policy.

99
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm talking tonight
at a Neurological Society dinner.

100
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,440
Come with me.

101
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,280
Another speaking engagement?

102
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
So romantic.

103
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,400
You used to love coming
to those things with me.

104
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,720
-We had fun together.
-

105
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,480
No! You had fun.

106
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,320
They weren't about us,
they were about you.

107
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,520
Not only about me.

108
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,600
Stephen. Everything is about you.

109
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,120
Maybe we could hyphenate.

110
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,280
Strange-Palmer Technique.

111
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,240
CHRISTINE: Palmer-Strange.

112
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,560
-Billy.

113
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,920
What have you got for me?

114
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,280
BILLY: I've got a 35-year-old
Air Force Colonel...

115
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,560
crushed his lower spine
in some kind of experimental armor.

116
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,000
Mid-thoracic burst fracture.

117
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,560
Yeah, well, I could help...

118
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,840
but so could 50 other people.

119
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,480
Find me something worth my time.

120
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,880
I have a 68-year-old female
with an advanced brain stem glioma.

121
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,760
Yeah, you want me to screw up
my perfect record?

122
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,320
Definitely not.

123
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,520
How about a 22-year-old female...

124
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,960
with an electronic implant in her brain
to control schizophrenia...

125
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,280
struck by lightning?

126
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,880
Mmm. That does sound interesting.

127
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,200
-Can you send me the...
-

128
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,080
Got it.

129
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,920
CHRISTINE: Hey.

130
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,720
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

131
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,720
What did they do?

132
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,160
They rushed you in a chopper.

133
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,360
But it took a little while to find you.

134
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,600
The golden hours for nerve damage
went by while you were in the car.

135
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,360
What did they do?

136
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,240
11 stainless steel pins in the bones.

137
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,280
Multiple torn ligaments...

138
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,480
severe nerve damage in both hands.

139
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,960
You were on the table for 11 hours.

140
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,960
DOCTOR STRANGE:
Look at these fixators.

141
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,560
No one could have done better.

142
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,920
I could have done better.

143
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
No.

144
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,280
DOCTOR WEST:
Give your body time to heal.

145
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
You've ruined me.

146
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,200
DOCTOR STRANGE:
How long until I can take...

147
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
DOCTOR WEISS: Doctor Strange.

148
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,080
Those tissues are still healing.

149
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,200
So, speed it up.

150
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,040
Pass a stent down the brachial artery
into the radial artery.

151
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,120
It's possible.

152
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,160
Experimental and expensive,
but possible.

153
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,160
All I need is possible.

154
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,720
PHYSICAL THERAPIST: Up.

155
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Up.

156
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,680
Show me your strength.

157
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,440
This is useless.

158
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,760
It's not useless, man. You can do this.

159
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,240
All right, answer me this,
bachelor's degree.

160
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,000
Have you ever known anyone
with nerve damage

161
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,640
this severe to do this...

162
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,000
and actually recover?

163
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,640
One guy, yeah.

164
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,160
Factory accident, broke his back...

165
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,640
paralyzed, his leg wasted away.

166
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,000
-He had pain in his shoulder,

167
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,080
from the wheelchair.

168
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,720
He came in three times a week.

169
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,040
Then one day he stopped coming.

170
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,040
I thought he was dead.

171
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,280
A few years later, he walked
past me on the street.

172
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,840
-DOCTOR STRANGE: Walked?
-Yeah, walked.

173
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,800
DOCTOR STRANGE: Bullshit.
Show me his file.

174
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,600
It'll take me a while to
pull the files from the archive.

175
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,120
But if it proves
your arrogant ass wrong...

176
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,840
Worth it.

177
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,800
ETIENNE: I looked
at all your research...

178
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,080
I read all the papers you've sent.

179
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,960
It's not gonna work.

180
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,560
I don't think you realize...

181
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,240
-how severe the damages are.
-Here's the thing...

182
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,360
The best have tried and failed.

183
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,320
I understand. Here's the thing.

184
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,520
What you want from me
is impossible, Stephen.

185
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,920
Come on.

186
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,680
I've got my own reputation to consider.

187
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,600
-Etienne, wait. No.
-I can't help you.

188
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,960
-No, no, wait!

189
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,160
CHRISTINE: Hey!

190
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,120
He won't do it.

191
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,080
He's a hack.

192
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,720
There is a new procedure in Tokyo.

193
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,320
They culture donor stem cells...

194
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,640
and then harvesting them

195
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,200
and then 3D printing a scaffold.

196
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,360
If I could get a loan together...

197
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
Stephen.

198
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,240
A small loan, just $200,000.

199
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,400
You've always spent money
as fast as you could make it...

200
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,520
but now you're spending money
you don't even have.

201
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,320
Maybe it's time to consider stopping.

202
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,720
No, now is exactly the time not to stop...

203
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,600
because, you see,
I'm not getting any better!

204
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,600
But this isn't medicine anymore.

205
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,440
This is mania.

206
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,200
Some things just can't be fixed.

207
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,840
-Life without my work...
-Is still life.

208
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,040
This isn't the end.

209
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,000
There are other things that
can give your life meaning.

210
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,880
Like what? Like you?

211
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,600
This is the part where you apologize.

212
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,600
This is the part where you leave.

213
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,160
Fine, I can't watch you
do this to yourself anymore.

214
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,440
Oh, too difficult for you, is it?

215
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,800
Yes, it is.

216
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,160
It breaks my heart to see you this way.

217
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
-No, don't pity me.
-I'm not pitying you.

218
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
Oh, yeah?
Then what are you doing here...

219
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,080
bringing cheese and wine
like we're old friends going for a picnic?

220
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,440
We are not friends, Christine.

221
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,920
We were barely lovers.

222
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,800
But you just love a sob story, don't you?

223
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,280
Is that what I am to you now?

224
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,040
"Poor Stephen Strange, charity case."

225
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,240
"He finally needs me."

226
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,040
Another dreg of humanity
for you to work on.

227
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,480
Patch him up and send him
back into the world...

228
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,040
heart's just humming.

229
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,520
You care so much, don't you?

230
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,000
Goodbye, Stephen.

231
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,520
-MAN: All the way. Here we go.
-

232
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,800
Let's go! All day! All day!

233
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,880
Yeah! All day.

234
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,240
Come on, man!
Where's the competition?

235
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,680
Talk a lot.

236
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,960
DOCTOR STRANGE:
Jonathan Pangborn...

237
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,120
C7-C8 spinal cord injury, complete.

238
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,840
Who are you?

239
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,920
Paralyzed from the mid-chest down.

240
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,720
Partial paralysis in both hands.

241
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,880
-I don't know you.
-I'm Stephen Strange.

242
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,040
I'm a neurosurgeon.
Was a neurosurgeon.

243
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,800
Actually, you know what, man,
I do know you.

244
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,680
I came to your office once.
You refused to see me.

245
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,280
I never got past your assistant.

246
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,440
You were untreatable.

247
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,920
No glory for you in that, right?

248
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,200
You came back from a place
there's no way back from.

249
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,880
I'm trying to
find my own way back.

250
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,880
MAN: Pangborn, are you in or you out?

251
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,480
All right.

252
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,760
I'd given up on my body.

253
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,080
I thought my mind's
the only thing I have left...

254
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,160
I should at least try to elevate that.

255
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,760
So, I sat with gurus...

256
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,600
and sacred women.

257
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,600
Strangers carried me to
mountaintops to see holy men.

258
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,800
And finally...

259
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,600
I found my teacher.

260
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,280
And my mind was elevated...

261
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,640
and my spirit deepened.

262
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
And somehow...

263
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,760
Your body healed.

264
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
Yes.

265
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,600
There were deeper secrets
to learn there...

266
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,280
but I didn't have the strength
to receive them.

267
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,400
I chose to settle for my miracle
and I came back home.

268
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,880
The place you're looking for
is called Kamar-Taj.

269
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,280
But the cost there is high.

270
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,280
How much?

271
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,040
I'm not talking about money.

272
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,480
Good luck.

273
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,800
Let's ball. All right, ball up!

274
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,000
Uh, Kamar-Taj?

275
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,800
You know where Kamar-Taj is?

276
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,200
Kamar-Taj?

277
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,080
Kamar-Taj.

278
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,640
Okay.

279
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,280
Look, guys, I don't have any money.

280
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,040
Your watch.

281
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,320
No, please. It's all I have left.

282
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,520
Your watch.

283
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,120
All right.

284
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,480
You're looking for Kamar-Taj.

285
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,360
DOCTOR STRANGE: Really?

286
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,440
Sure we got the right place?

287
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,680
That one looks
a little more Kamar-Tajey.

288
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,240
I once stood in your place.

289
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,840
And I, too, was disrespectful.

290
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,200
So, might I offer you some advice?

291
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,600
Forget everything you think you know.

292
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,600
All right.

293
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,200
MORDO: The sanctuary of our teacher.

294
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,360
The Ancient One.

295
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,360
DOCTOR STRANGE: The Ancient One?

296
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,520
What's his real name?

297
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,280
Right.

298
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,920
Forget everything I think I know. Sorry.

299
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,440
Um, thank you for... Whoa!

300
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,800
Okay, that's a thing.

301
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,040
Thank you for...

302
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,280
Hello.

303
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,640
Oh, thank you.

304
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,600
And thank you.

305
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,720
-Uh, thank you...

306
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,560
Ancient One, for seeing me.

307
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
You're very welcome.

308
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,480
The Ancient One.

309
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,480
Thank you, Master Mordo.
Thank you, Master Hamir.

310
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,240
Mr. Strange.

311
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,480
Uh... Doctor, actually.

312
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,120
Well, no, not anymore, surely.

313
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,360
Isn't that why you're here?

314
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,920
You've undergone many procedures.

315
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,360
-Seven, right?
-Yeah.

316
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,120
It's good tea.

317
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,400
Yes.

318
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,440
Did you heal a man named Pangborn?

319
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,680
A paralyzed man?

320
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,840
In a way.

321
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,920
DOCTOR STRANGE:
You helped him to walk again.

322
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,080
Yes.

323
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,840
How did you correct a complete
C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

324
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,760
Well, I didn't correct it.

325
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,280
He couldn't walk.

326
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,760
I convinced him that he could.

327
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,840
You're not suggesting
it was psychosomatic?

328
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,920
When you reattach a severed nerve...

329
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,440
is it you who heals it
back together or the body?

330
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
It's the cells.

331
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,200
The cells are only programmed...

332
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,320
to put themselves back together
in very specific ways.

333
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,400
Right.

334
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,000
What if I told you that
your own body could be convinced...

335
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,320
to put itself back together
in all sorts of ways?

336
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,480
You're talking about
cellular regeneration.

337
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,840
That's bleeding edge medical tech.

338
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,800
Is that why you're working here?

339
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,200
Without a governing medical board?

340
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,280
Just how experimental
is your treatment?

341
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,320
Quite.

342
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,160
So, you've figured out a way...

343
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,520
to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?

344
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,080
No, Mr. Strange.

345
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,560
I know how to reorient the spirit...

346
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,360
to better heal the body.

347
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,880
-The spirit to heal the body?
-That's right.

348
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,000
No. All right.

349
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,160
How do we do that?

350
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,840
Where do we start?

351
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,360
-Don't like that map?
-Oh, no.

352
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,600
It's really good. It's just,
I've seen it before...

353
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,960
in gift shops.

354
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,080
And what about this one?

355
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,680
-Acupuncture, great.
-Yeah?

356
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,840
What about that one?

357
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,720
Showing me an MRI scan.
I do not believe this.

358
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,400
Each of those maps
was drawn up by someone...

359
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,200
who could see in part, but not the whole.

360
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,680
I spent my last dollar getting here,
one-way ticket...

361
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,000
and you're talking to me
about healing through belief?

362
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,520
You're a man looking at the world
through a keyhole.

363
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,120
-You've spent your whole life

364
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,560
trying to widen that keyhole...

365
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,240
to see more, to know more.

366
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,400
Now, on hearing that it can be widened...

367
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,440
in ways you can't imagine...

368
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,040
you reject the possibility.

369
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,680
No, I reject it because
I do not believe in fairy tales...

370
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,400
about chakras or energy...

371
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,160
or the power of belief.

372
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,360
There is no such thing as spirit!

373
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,960
We are made of matter
and nothing more.

374
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,320
You're just another tiny,
momentary speck

375
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,720
within an indifferent universe.

376
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,440
You think too little of yourself.

377
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,640
Oh, you think
you see through me, do you?

378
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,800
Well, you don't.

379
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,720
But I see through you!

380
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,880
What did you just do to me?

381
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,120
I pushed your astral form
out of your physical form.

382
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,840
What's in that tea?

383
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,600
Psilocybin? LSD?

384
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,440
It's just tea...

385
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,560
with a little honey.

386
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,360
What just happened?

387
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,840
For a moment, you entered
the astral dimension.

388
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
The what?

389
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,080
A place where the soul exists
apart from the body.

390
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,080
Why are you doing this to me?

391
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,600
To show you
just how much you don't know.

392
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,800
Open your eye.

393
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,120
Oh, shit!

394
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,640
Oh, God! Oh, God, no!

395
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,200
No, no, no!

396
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,360
What's happening?

397
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,640
This isn't real!

398
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,160
MORDO: His heart rate
is getting dangerously high.

399
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,520
He looks all right to me.

400
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,880
ANCIENT ONE: You think
you know how the world works?

401
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,240
You think that this material universe
is all there is?

402
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,000
What is real?

403
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,760
What mysteries lie beyond
the reach of your senses?

404
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,240
At the root of existence...

405
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,520
mind and matter meet.

406
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,560
Thoughts shape reality.

407
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,160
This universe is only one
of an infinite number.

408
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,880
Worlds without end.

409
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,120
Some benevolent and life giving.

410
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,720
Others filled with malice and hunger.

411
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,640
Dark places...

412
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,600
where powers older than time
lie ravenous...

413
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,520
and waiting.

414
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:03,360
Who are you
in this vast Multiverse, Mr. Strange?

415
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,560
ANCIENT ONE: Have you seen
that before in a gift shop?

416
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,760
Teach me.

417
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,520
No.

418
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,360
No.

419
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,440
No!

420
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,600
No, no, no!

421
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,880
No!

422
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,280
Open the door! Please!

423
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,840
ANCIENT ONE: Thank you, Masters.

424
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,320
You think I was wrong to cast him out?

425
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,760
MORDO: 5 hours later,
he's still on your doorstep.

426
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,560
There's a strength to him.

427
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,360
Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition.

428
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,080
I've seen it all before.

429
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,320
He reminds you of Kaecilius?

430
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,240
I cannot lead another
gifted student to power...

431
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,560
only to lose him to the darkness.

432
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,000
You didn't lose me.

433
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,720
I wanted the power
to defeat my enemies.

434
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,400
You gave me the power
to defeat my demons.

435
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,440
And to live within the natural law.

436
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,760
We never lose our demons, Mordo.

437
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,880
We only learn to live above them.

438
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,320
Kaecilius still has the stolen pages.

439
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,800
If he deciphers them,
he could bring ruin...

440
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,320
upon us all.

441
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,120
There may be dark days ahead.

442
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,040
Perhaps Kamar-Taj
could use a man like Strange.

443
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
Don't shut me out.

444
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,840
I haven't got anywhere else to go.

445
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,760
Thank you.

446
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,120
Bathe.

447
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,480
Rest.

448
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,800
Meditate...

449
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,800
if you can.

450
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,000
The Ancient One will send for you.

451
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,120
What's this? My mantra?

452
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,400
The Wi-Fi password.

453
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,640
We're not savages.

454
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,120
ANCIENT ONE: The language
of the mystic arts...

455
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,760
is as old as civilization.

456
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,360
The sorcerers of antiquity...

457
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,280
called the use of this language "spells."

458
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,400
But if that word offends
your modern sensibilities...

459
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,080
you can call it a "program."

460
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,240
The source code that shapes reality.

461
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,200
We harness energy...

462
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,800
drawn from other dimensions
of the Multiverse...

463
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,920
-to cast spells...
-

464
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,160
to conjure shields...

465
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,200
and weapons...

466
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,360
to make magic.

467
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,240
But even if my fingers could do that...

468
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,000
my hands would just be
waving in the air.

469
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,240
How do I get from here to there?

470
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,880
How did you get
to reattach severed nerves...

471
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,560
and put a human spine
back together bone by bone?

472
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,120
Study and practice, years of it.

473
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,680
Hey.

474
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,760
Mr. Strange.

475
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,800
Uh, Stephen, please.

476
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,040
-And you are?
-Wong.

477
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,360
Wong.

478
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,320
Just Wong?

479
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,160
Like Adele?

480
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,720
Or Aristotle.

481
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,480
Drake.

482
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,960
Bono.

483
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
Eminem.

484
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,680
The Book of the Invisible Sun.

485
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,080
Astronomia Nova.

486
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,800
Codex Imperium.

487
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,800
Key of Solomon.

488
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,400
You finished all of these?

489
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,720
Yup.

490
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,480
Come with me.

491
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,680
All right.

492
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,640
WONG: This section
is for masters only...

493
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,200
but at my discretion, others may use it.

494
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,760
You should start with Maxim's Primer.

495
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,200
How's your Sanskrit?

496
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,240
I'm fluent in Google Translate.

497
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,160
Vedic, classical Sanskrit.

498
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,160
What are those?

499
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,920
WONG: The Ancient One's
private collection.

500
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,320
So, they're forbidden?

501
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,920
No knowledge in Kamar-Taj
is forbidden.

502
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,920
Only certain practices.

503
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,760
Those books are far too advanced

504
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,920
for anyone other than
the Sorcerer Supreme.

505
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,000
This one's got pages missing.

506
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,440
WONG: That's The Book of Cagliostro.

507
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,280
A study of time.

508
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,240
One of the rituals was stolen
by a former master.

509
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,040
The Zealot, Kaecilius.

510
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,080
Just after he strung up
the former librarian...

511
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,680
and relieved him of his head.

512
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,240
I am now the guardian of these books.

513
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,040
So if a volume from this collection
should be stolen again...

514
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,480
I'd know it...

515
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,920
and you'd be dead before
you ever left the compound.

516
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,680
What if it's just overdue?

517
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,000
Any late fees I should know about?
Maiming, perhaps?

518
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,720
People used to think that I was funny.

519
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,080
Did they work for you?

520
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,360
All right. Well, it's been
lovely talking to you.

521
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,280
Thank you for the books...

522
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,600
and for the horrifying story...

523
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,520
and for the threat upon my life.

524
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,600
We will now receive the power

525
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,600
to destroy the one who betrayed us.

526
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,200
The one who betrays the world.

527
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,440
MORDO: Mastery of the sling ring
is essential to the mystic arts.

528
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,120
They allow us to travel
throughout the Multiverse.

529
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,640
All you need to do is focus.

530
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,720
Visualize.

531
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,120
See the destination in your mind.

532
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,280
Look beyond the world in front of you.

533
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,280
Imagine every detail.

534
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,560
The clearer the picture,
the quicker and easier...

535
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,000
the gateway will come.

536
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,760
And stop.

537
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,480
I would like a moment alone
with Mr. Strange.

538
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,280
-Of course.
-

539
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,680
My hands.

540
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,960
It's not about your hands.

541
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,160
How is this not about my hands?

542
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,840
Master Hamir.

543
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,640
Thank you, Master Hamir.

544
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,760
You cannot beat a river into submission.

545
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,800
You have to surrender to its current...

546
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,160
and use its power as your own.

547
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,520
I control it by surrendering control?

548
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,000
That doesn't make any sense.

549
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,600
Not everything does.
Not everything has to.

550
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,840
Your intellect has
taken you far in life...

551
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,480
but it will take you no further.

552
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Surrender, Stephen.

553
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,200
Silence your ego...

554
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,360
and your power will rise.

555
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,360
Come with me.

556
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,640
DOCTOR STRANGE: Wait.

557
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,680
-Is this...
-Everest.

558
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,280
-Beautiful.
-

559
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,920
DOCTOR STRANGE:
Yeah, right, beautiful.

560
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,520
Freezing but beautiful.

561
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,760
ANCIENT ONE: At this temperature...

562
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,160
a person can last for 30 minutes...

563
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,840
before suffering permanent
loss of function.

564
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,040
Great.

565
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,640
But you'll likely go into shock
within the first two.

566
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,080
-What?
-Surrender, Stephen.

567
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,240
No!

568
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,080
MORDO: How's our new recruit?

569
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,400
We shall see.

570
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,920
Any second now.

571
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,280
Oh, no, not again.

572
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,640
Maybe I should...

573
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,840
Stephen.

574
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,080
Wong.

575
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,160
What do you want, Strange?

576
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,680
Books on astral projection.

577
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,760
You're not ready for that.

578
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,160
Try me, Beyoncé.

579
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,640
Oh, come on. You've heard of her.

580
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,080
She's a huge star, right?

581
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,000
Do you ever laugh?

582
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,920
Oh, come on, just give me the book.

583
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,040
No.

584
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,160
ANCIENT ONE: Once, in this room,

585
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,560
you begged me to let you learn.

586
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,600
Now, I'm told
you question every lesson...

587
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,280
preferring to teach yourself.

588
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,280
Once, in this room,
you told me to open my eye.

589
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,240
Now, I'm being told
to blindly accept rules...

590
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,760
that make no sense.

591
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,920
Like the rule against
conjuring a gateway in the library?

592
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,520
Wong told on me?

593
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,160
You're advancing quickly
with your sorcery skills.

594
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,920
You need a safe space
to practice your spells.

595
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,440
You are now inside
the Mirror Dimension...

596
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,280
ever present but undetected.

597
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,480
The real world isn't affected
by what happens here.

598
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,600
We use the Mirror Dimension
to train, surveil...

599
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,720
and sometimes to contain threats.

600
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,880
You don't wanna be stuck in here
without your sling ring.

601
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,840
Hold on. Sorry.
What do you mean, "threats?"

602
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,640
Learning of an infinite Multiverse
includes learning of infinite dangers.

603
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,880
If I told you everything else
that you don't already know...

604
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,560
you'd run from here in terror.

605
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,960
So just how ancient is she?

606
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,720
No one knows the age
of the Sorcerer Supreme.

607
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,640
Only that she's Celtic
and never talks about her past.

608
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,680
You follow her, even though
you don't know?

609
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,800
I know she's steadfast...

610
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,440
but unpredictable.

611
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,920
Merciless, yet kind.

612
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,520
She made me what I am.

613
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,480
Trust your teacher...

614
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,400
and don't lose your way.

615
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,720
Like Kaecilius?

616
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,120
That's right.

617
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,080
-You knew him.

618
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,360
When he first came to us...

619
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,720
he'd lost everyone he ever loved.

620
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,720
He was a grieving, broken man
searching for answers in the mystic arts.

621
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,720
A brilliant student,
but he was proud, headstrong.

622
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,760
He questioned the Ancient One,
rejected her teaching.

623
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,320
-

624
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,280
He left Kamar-Taj.

625
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,960
His disciples followed him like sheep.

626
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,000
Seduced by false doctrine.

627
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,440
And he stole the forbidden ritual, right?

628
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,520
Yes.

629
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,880
What did it do?

630
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,600
No more questions.

631
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,160
What's that?

632
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,480
That's a question.

633
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,040
This is a relic.

634
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,040
Some magic is too powerful to sustain...

635
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,200
so we imbue objects with it...

636
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,720
allowing them
to take the strain we cannot.

637
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,760
This is the staff...

638
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,560
of the Living Tribunal.

639
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,480
There are many relics.

640
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,400
The Wand of Watoomb.

641
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,080
The Vaulting Boots of Valtorr.

642
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,080
Really just roll off
the tongue, don't they?

643
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,760
-When do I get my relic?
-When you're ready.

644
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,280
I think I'm ready.

645
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,080
You're ready when the relic
decides you're ready.

646
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,040
For now...

647
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,040
conjure a weapon.

648
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,800
All right.

649
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,320
Fight!

650
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,920
Fight like your life depended on it.

651
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,520
Because one day...

652
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,000
it may.

653
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,400
Wong?

654
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,080
Okay.

655
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:47,280
"First, open the Eye of Agamotto."

656
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,680
All right.

657
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,320
Oh, my.

658
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:48,960
What if...

659
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,240
"Dormammu."

660
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,120
"The Dark Dimension."

661
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,560
Eternal life?

662
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,880
-What the...
-MORDO: Stop!

663
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,360
Tampering with continuum probabilities
is forbidden.

664
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,960
I was just doing
exactly what it said in the book.

665
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,400
What did the book say

666
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,800
about the dangers
of performing that ritual?

667
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,640
I don't know.
I hadn't gotten to that part yet.

668
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,720
Temporal manipulations
can create branches in time.

669
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,160
Unstable dimensional openings.

670
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,520
Spatial paradoxes! Time loops!

671
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,640
You wanna get stuck
reliving the same moment

672
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,040
over and over forever...

673
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,440
or never having existed at all?

674
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,120
Really should put the warnings
before the spell.

675
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,160
Your curiosity could have
gotten you killed.

676
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,560
You weren't manipulating
the space-time continuum...

677
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,640
you were breaking it.

678
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,040
We do not tamper with natural law.

679
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,120
We defend it.

680
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,680
How did you even do that?

681
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,040
Hmm?

682
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,200
Where did you learn the litany of spells
required to even understand it?

683
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,480
I've got a photographic memory.

684
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,320
That's how I got my M.D.
and Ph.D. at the same time.

685
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,000
What you just did...

686
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,480
takes more than a good memory.

687
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,480
You were born for the mystic arts.

688
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,720
And yet my hands still shake.

689
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,080
For now, yes.

690
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,360
Not forever?

691
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,680
We're not prophets.

692
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,560
When are you gonna start
telling me what we are?

693
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,640
WONG: While heroes like the Avengers

694
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,040
protect the world
from physical dangers...

695
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,560
we sorcerers safeguard it
against more mystical threats.

696
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,120
The Ancient One
is the latest in a long line

697
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,360
of Sorcerers Supreme...

698
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,200
going back thousands of years
to the father of the mystic arts...

699
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,560
the mighty Agamotto.

700
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:56,680
Same sorcerer who created the eye
you so recklessly borrowed.

701
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,680
Agamotto built three Sanctums
in places of power...

702
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,840
where great cities now stand.

703
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,080
That door leads to
the Hong Kong Sanctum.

704
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,720
That door to the New York Sanctum.

705
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,640
That one to the London Sanctum.

706
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,800
Together...

707
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:16,520
the Sanctums generate
a protective shield around our world.

708
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,680
MORDO: The Sanctums
protect the world...

709
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,080
and we sorcerers...

710
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,040
protect the Sanctums.

711
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,160
From what?

712
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,960
Other dimensional beings
that threaten our universe.

713
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,760
Like Dormammu.

714
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,680
Where did you learn that name?

715
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,560
I just read it in
The Book of Cagliostro. Why?

716
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,320
WONG: Dormammu dwells
in the Dark Dimension.

717
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,480
Beyond time.

718
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,280
He is the cosmic conqueror...

719
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,320
the destroyer of worlds.

720
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,160
A being of infinite power
and endless hunger...

721
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,640
on a quest to invade every universe...

722
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,440
and bring all worlds
into his Dark Dimension.

723
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,280
And he hungers for Earth most of all.

724
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,640
The pages that Kaecilius stole.

725
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,240
A ritual to contact Dormammu

726
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,840
and draw power
from the Dark Dimension.

727
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,880
Uh... Okay...

728
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,480
Um... I'm out.

729
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,800
I came here
to heal my hands.

730
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,880
Not to fight in some mystical war.

731
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,160
London.

732
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,000
WONG: Kaecilius!

733
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,320
MORDO: No!

734
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,400
DOCTOR STRANGE: Wong? Mordo?

735
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,440
Hello?

736
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,800
Hello?

737
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,120
Daniel, I see they made you
master of this Sanctum.

738
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,280
You know what that means?

739
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,480
That you'll die protecting it.

740
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,720
Stop!

741
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,400
How long have you been
at Kamar-Taj, Mister...

742
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,840
Doctor.

743
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,280
Mister Doctor?

744
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,320
It's Strange.

745
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,320
Maybe. Who am I to judge?

746
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,120
-

747
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:55,800
Ha!

748
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,480
You don't know how to use that, do you?

749
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,640
Uh...

750
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,080
What?

751
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,480
Oh, stop it.

752
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:57,600
I said stop it.

753
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,120
You cannot stop this, Mister Doctor.

754
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,760
I don't even know what "this" is.

755
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:02,960
It's the end...

756
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,960
and the beginning.

757
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,880
The many becoming the few
becoming the One.

758
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,080
If you're not gonna start making sense...

759
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,760
I'm just gonna to have to
put this thing back on.

760
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,040
Tell me, Mister Doctor...

761
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,440
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange.

762
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,280
-You are a doctor?
-Yeah.

763
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,440
A scientist.

764
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,600
You understand the laws of nature.

765
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,120
All things age. All things die.

766
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,720
In the end, our sun burns out.

767
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,080
Our universe grows cold and perishes.

768
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:31,960
But the Dark Dimension...

769
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,800
it's a place beyond time.

770
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,560
That's it. I'm putting this thing back on.

771
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,040
This world doesn't have to die, doctor.

772
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,880
This world can take its rightful place
alongside so many others...

773
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,320
as part of the One.

774
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,800
The great and beautiful One.

775
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,320
We can all live forever.

776
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,840
Really?

777
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:54,120
What do you have to gain
out of this New Age dimensional utopia?

778
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,200
KAECILIUS: The same as you.

779
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,160
The same as everyone. Life. Eternal life.

780
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,680
People think in terms of good and evil...

781
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,640
when really time
is the true enemy of us all.

782
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,480
Time kills everything.

783
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,320
What about the people you killed?

784
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,720
Tiny.

785
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,240
Momentary specks within
an indifferent universe.

786
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,240
Yes. You see.

787
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,080
You see what we're doing.

788
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,440
The world is not what it ought to be.

789
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:23,040
Humanity longs for the eternal...

790
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,840
for a world beyond time,
because time is what enslaves us.

791
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,160
Time is an insult.

792
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,880
Death is an insult.

793
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,560
Doctor...

794
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,040
we don't seek to rule this world.

795
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,360
We seek to save it...

796
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,960
to hand it over to Dormammu,
who is the intent of all evolution...

797
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,760
the why of all existence.

798
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,680
The Sorcerer Supreme
defends existence.

799
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:51,480
What was it that brought you
to Kamar-Taj, doctor?

800
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,000
Was it enlightenment?

801
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,000
Power?

802
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:59,240
You came to be healed, as did we all.

803
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,600
Kamar-Taj is a place
that collects broken things.

804
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,680
We all come with the promise
of being healed...

805
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,560
and instead The Ancient One
gives us parlor tricks.

806
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:12,440
The real magic she keeps for herself.

807
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:15,840
You ever wonder
how she managed to live this long?

808
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,440
I saw the rituals
in The Book of Cagliostro.

809
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,960
So, you know.

810
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,880
The ritual gives me the power

811
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,280
to overthrow The Ancient One...

812
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,120
and tear her Sanctums down.

813
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,840
To let the Dark Dimension in.

814
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,960
Because what The Ancient One hoards,

815
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,680
Dormammu gives freely.

816
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,000
Life everlasting.

817
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,120
He's not the destroyer of worlds, doctor.

818
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,120
He's the savior of worlds.

819
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,440
No. I mean, come on.

820
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,360
Look at your face.

821
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,880
Dormammu made you a murderer.

822
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,200
Just how good can his kingdom be?

823
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,680
You think that's funny?

824
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,800
No, not that.

825
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,400
What's funny is that
you've lost your sling ring.

826
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:11,840
Sir, can I help you?

827
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,120
Doctor Palmer, where is she?

828
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:14,800
-Sir. We need to get...
-Where is she?

829
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,400
The nurse's station.

830
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,560
Christine!

831
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,720
-Stephen?
-

832
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:21,880
Oh, my God.

833
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,560
Get me in an operating theater now.
Just you.

834
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,760
Now! I haven't any time.

835
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,480
What happened?

836
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:30,520
I was stabbed. Cardiac tamponade.

837
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,040
What are you wearing?

838
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:40,720
Chest cavity is clear.

839
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,560
No, the blood is in the pericardial sac.

840
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:47,680
No, no, no.

841
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:48,760
Stephen?

842
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:51,560
Come on, come on.

843
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,480
-Just a little higher.
-

844
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:21,960
Please be careful with the needle.

845
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,040
Stephen?

846
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:28,800
What am I seeing?

847
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,840
My astral body.

848
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,120
Are you dead?

849
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,000
No, Christine. But I am dying.

850
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:39,120
Right.

851
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:41,560
Yeah. All right.

852
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,320
Okay.

853
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,560
Oh, wow.

854
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,040
I've never seen a wound like this.

855
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:57,000
What were you stabbed with?

856
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,760
I don't know.

857
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,280
I'm gonna have to vanish now.

858
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:21,720
What?

859
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,360
Keep me alive, will you?

860
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,920
Huh?

861
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,480
Okay.

862
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,000
Uh-huh.

863
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,000
Oh, shit.

864
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,840
-Come on, come on.
-

865
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,000
Stephen, come on.

866
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,120
-Hit me again.
-

867
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:44,800
Stop doing that!

868
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,760
Up the voltage and hit me again.

869
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:47,880
No, your heart's beating!

870
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,320
Just do it!

871
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,800
Oh, my God.

872
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,760
-

873
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,880
Oh, God! Oh, God!

874
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,080
-Are you okay?
-

875
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,320
Yeah.

876
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,480
-Okay.

877
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,960
CHRISTINE: After all this time...

878
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,960
you just show up here...

879
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,560
flying out of your body.

880
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,440
Yeah, I know.

881
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,120
I missed you, too, by the way.

882
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,120
Ha ha.

883
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,840
I wrote you emails,
but you never responded.

884
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:50,120
Why would I?

885
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,360
Christine, I am so, so sorry.

886
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,280
For all of it. You were right.

887
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:00,040
I was a complete asshole.
I treated you so horribly.

888
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,600
And you deserved so much more.

889
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,240
Stop. You're clearly in shock.

890
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:08,480
What the hell is happening?

891
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,920
Where have you been?

892
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:14,040
Well, after Western medicine failed me...

893
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:17,080
I headed east,
and I ended up in Kathmandu.

894
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,320
Kathmandu?

895
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,640
Yeah.

896
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:21,880
Like the Bob Seger song?

897
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,960
1975, Beautiful Loser, side A. Yeah.

898
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:27,840
I went to a place called Kamar-Taj...

899
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,680
and I talked to someone
called "The Ancient One."

900
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,760
Oh. So you joined a cult.

901
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,480
No, I didn't. No, not exactly. No.

902
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:39,360
They did teach me to tap into powers
that I never even knew existed.

903
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,800
Yeah. That sounds like a cult.

904
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,200
It's not a cult.

905
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,680
Well, that's what a cultist would say.

906
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:48,000
Wait. Stephen, wait.
What do you think you're doing?

907
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,840
I'm late for a cult meeting.

908
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:54,760
This is insane.

909
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:55,920
Yeah.

910
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,040
-Where are you going?
-Um...

911
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,000
Can you tell me the truth?

912
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,600
Well, a powerful sorcerer

913
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,440
who gave himself over
to an ancient entity...

914
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,120
can bend the very laws of physics,
tried very hard to kill me.

915
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,040
But I left him chained up
in Greenwich Village...

916
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,480
and the quickest way back there
is through a dimensional gateway...

917
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:12,800
that I opened up in the mop closet.

918
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,760
Okay. Don't tell me. Fine.

919
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:26,880
Really do have to go.

920
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,040
Yeah.

921
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,400
-

922
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:15,920
MORDO: Strange!

923
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:19,680
You're okay.

924
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,040
A relative term. But yeah, I'm okay.

925
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,560
The Cloak of Levitation.

926
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,080
It came to you.

927
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,280
ANCIENT ONE: No minor feat.

928
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,600
It's a fickle thing.

929
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,840
-He's escaped.
-ANCIENT ONE: Kaecilius?

930
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,120
Yeah.

931
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,920
He can fold space and matter at will.

932
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:41,560
He folds matter
outside the Mirror Dimension...

933
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:42,800
in the real world?

934
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:43,960
Yeah.

935
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,960
-How many more?
-Two.

936
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,040
I stranded one in the desert.

937
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,240
And the other?

938
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,720
His body's in the hall.

939
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,640
Master Drumm is in the foyer.

940
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,520
He's been taken back to Kamar-Taj.

941
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,960
ANCIENT ONE:
The London Sanctum has fallen.

942
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,480
Only New York and Hong Kong
remain now...

943
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,760
to shield us from the Dark Dimension.

944
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:05,400
You defended the New York Sanctum
from attack.

945
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,400
With its master gone, it needs another.

946
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:09,080
Master Strange.

947
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:12,960
No.

948
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:16,160
It is Doctor Strange.

949
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:18,920
Not Master Strange. Not Mister Strange.

950
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,160
Doctor Strange.

951
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:25,080
When I became a doctor,
I swore an oath to do no harm.

952
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:26,520
And I have just killed a man!

953
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,440
I'm not doing that again.

954
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:30,960
I became a doctor
to save lives, not take them.

955
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,400
You became a doctor
to save one life above all others.

956
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:35,480
Your own.

957
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,680
Still seeing through me, are you?

958
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:42,520
I see what I've always seen:
your over-inflated ego.

959
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,280
You want to go back to the delusion
that you can control anything...

960
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,760
even death...

961
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,520
which no one can control.

962
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,360
Not even the great
Doctor Stephen Strange.

963
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,720
Not even Dormammu?

964
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,200
He offers immortality.

965
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,400
It's our fear of death
that gives Dormammu life.

966
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:01,800
He feeds off it.

967
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:04,200
Like you feed off him?

968
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,120
You talk to me about controlling death?

969
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,280
Oh, I know how you do it.

970
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,160
I've seen the missing rituals
from The Book of Cagliostro.

971
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:14,080
Measure your next words
very carefully, doctor.

972
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,040
Because you might not like them?

973
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,200
Because you may not know
of what you speak.

974
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:20,920
What is he talking about?

975
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:24,400
I'm talking about her long life,
the source of her immortality.

976
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,800
She draws power
from the Dark Dimension

977
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,440
-to stay alive.
-

978
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,520
That's not true.

979
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,920
I've seen the rituals. Worked them out.

980
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,200
I know how you do it.

981
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,320
ANCIENT ONE: Once they regroup...

982
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,080
the Zealots will be back.

983
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,600
You'll need reinforcements.

984
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,600
She's not who you think she is.

985
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,600
You don't have the right to say that.

986
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:58,480
You've no idea the responsibility
that rests upon her shoulders.

987
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,440
No, and I don't want to know.

988
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:01,920
You're a coward.

989
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,360
Because I'm not a killer?

990
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,120
These Zealots will snuff us all out...

991
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,760
and you can't muster the strength
to snuff them first?

992
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,280
What do you think I just did?

993
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,680
You saved your own life!

994
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,600
And then whined about it
like a wounded dog.

995
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,080
Oh, you would have done it so easily?

996
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:18,960
You've no idea the things I've done.

997
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,040
And the answer is yes.

998
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,840
Without hesitation.

999
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,160
Even if there's another way?

1000
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:28,160
There is no other way.

1001
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,640
You lack imagination.

1002
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:30,800
No, Stephen.

1003
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:34,520
You lack a spine.

1004
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:40,800
They're back.

1005
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:48,960
We have to end this.

1006
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:50,240
Now!

1007
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:56,560
Strange!

1008
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,400
Get down here and fight!

1009
01:16:58,760 --> 01:16:59,840
No!

1010
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,520
The Mirror Dimension.

1011
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:08,520
You can't affect the real world in here.

1012
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,320
Who's laughing now?

1013
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:11,680
Asshole.

1014
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:14,600
I am.

1015
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:29,840
I've got his sling ring.

1016
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:30,960
They can't escape, right?

1017
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:33,440
Run!
-

1018
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,240
MORDO: Their connection
to the Dark Dimension

1019
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,240
makes them more powerful
in the Mirror Dimension.

1020
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,640
They can't affect the real world,
but they can still kill us.

1021
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:59,560
This wasn't cleverness. It was suicide!

1022
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,400
That is hilarious.

1023
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,360
This was a mistake.

1024
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,280
Whoa.

1025
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:10,800
Oh!

1026
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:39,960
MORDO: It's true.

1027
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:44,200
She does draw power
from the Dark Dimension.

1028
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:48,800
Kaecilius.

1029
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,440
I came to you broken...

1030
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,400
lost, in need.

1031
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:00,440
Trusted you to be my teacher,
and you fed me lies.

1032
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,400
I tried to protect you.

1033
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,920
-From the truth?
-From yourself.

1034
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,280
I have a new teacher now.

1035
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:08,800
Dormammu deceives you.

1036
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,080
You have no idea what he truly is.

1037
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:16,080
His eternal life is not paradise,
but torment.

1038
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,520
Liar.

1039
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:14,360
DOCTOR STRANGE: Christine!

1040
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:16,760
Are you kidding me?

1041
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:18,920
Oh, my God.

1042
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:23,680
It's not fibrillation.
She has a stunned myocardium.

1043
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:24,880
-CHRISTINE: Neurogenic?
-Yes.

1044
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,200
NURSE: Someone get the swabs.

1045
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:34,720
Nic?

1046
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,680
We need to relieve
the pressure on her brain.

1047
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,560
-MAN: She's still dropping.

1048
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:45,680
We're losing her!

1049
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,000
We need to increase her oxygen!

1050
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,160
I need a crash cart!

1051
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,280
NURSE 1: Her pupils have dilated!

1052
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
NURSE 2: No reflexes.

1053
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,520
We're not reading any brain activity.

1054
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,680
DOCTOR STRANGE:
What are you doing?

1055
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,360
Come on, you're dying!

1056
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:19,600
You have to return to your body now.
You don't have time.

1057
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,360
Time is relative.

1058
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,760
Your body hasn't even hit the floor yet.

1059
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,480
I've spent so many years...

1060
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,240
peering through time...

1061
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,920
looking at this exact moment.

1062
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,640
But I can't see past it.

1063
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,800
I've prevented countless,
terrible futures.

1064
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:40,480
And after each one,
there's always another.

1065
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,960
And they all lead here...

1066
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:44,080
but never further.

1067
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,240
You think this is where you die.

1068
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,560
You wonder what I see in your future?

1069
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:50,800
No.

1070
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:54,160
Yes.

1071
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,760
I never saw your future.

1072
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,400
Only its possibilities.

1073
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,200
You have such a capacity for goodness.

1074
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,240
You always excelled...

1075
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,840
but not because you craved success...

1076
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,400
but because of your fear of failure.

1077
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,240
That's what made me a great doctor.

1078
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:13,040
It's precisely what kept you
from greatness.

1079
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:16,160
Arrogance and fear still keep you...

1080
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:17,680
from learning the simplest

1081
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,800
and most significant lesson of all.

1082
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:20,880
Which is?

1083
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:25,360
It's not about you.

1084
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:30,440
When you first came to me...

1085
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:33,680
you asked me how I was able
to heal Jonathan Pangborn.

1086
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,000
I didn't.

1087
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:42,120
He channels dimensional energy
directly into his own body.

1088
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:44,080
He uses magic to walk?

1089
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,280
Constantly.

1090
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,760
He had a choice...

1091
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,520
to return to his own life...

1092
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:53,400
or to serve something
greater than himself.

1093
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:56,120
So I could have my hands back again?

1094
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:57,640
My old life?

1095
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:59,560
You could.

1096
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:03,440
And the world would be
all the lesser for it.

1097
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:08,320
I've hated drawing power
from the Dark Dimension.

1098
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,560
But as you well know...

1099
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,040
sometimes one must break the rules...

1100
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:13,920
in order to serve the greater good.

1101
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:16,080
Mordo won't see it that way.

1102
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,760
Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable...

1103
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:21,080
forged by the fires of his youth.

1104
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:23,080
He needs your flexibility...

1105
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,160
just as you need his strength.

1106
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:30,000
Only together do you stand a chance
of stopping Dormammu.

1107
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,680
I'm not ready.

1108
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,160
No one ever is.

1109
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,040
We don't get to choose our time.

1110
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:45,400
Death is what gives life meaning.

1111
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:49,120
To know your days are numbered.

1112
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,240
Your time is short.

1113
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,480
You'd think after
all this time, I'd be ready.

1114
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:58,160
But look at me.

1115
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:01,240
Stretching one moment out
into a thousand...

1116
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:03,840
just so that I can watch the snow.

1117
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,000
Are you okay?

1118
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,920
I don't understand what's happening.

1119
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,160
I know.

1120
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,840
But I have to go away now.

1121
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,640
You said that losing my hands
didn't have to be the end.

1122
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,400
That it could be a beginning.

1123
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:09,640
Yeah.

1124
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:13,840
Because there are other ways
to save lives.

1125
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,480
A harder way.

1126
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:23,000
-A weirder way.
-

1127
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:25,000
Doctor Palmer
to the ER, please.

1128
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:26,720
Doctor Palmer to the ER.

1129
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,840
I don't want you to go.

1130
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:22,080
Stop!

1131
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Choose your weapon wisely.

1132
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:59,520
No one steps foot in this Sanctum.

1133
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:02,800
No one.

1134
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:19,920
Kaecilius.

1135
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,560
You're on the wrong side
of history, Wong.

1136
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,840
She's dead.

1137
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:38,120
MORDO: You were right.

1138
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:41,360
She wasn't who I thought she was.

1139
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,240
She was complicated.

1140
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,320
Complicated?

1141
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,920
The Dark Dimension is volatile.

1142
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:57,320
Dangerous.

1143
01:29:58,120 --> 01:29:59,360
What if it overtook her?

1144
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,600
She taught us it was forbidden...

1145
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:08,360
while she drew on its power
to steal centuries of life.

1146
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:10,320
She did what she thought was right.

1147
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,120
The bill comes due.

1148
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,440
Don't you see?

1149
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,400
Her transgressions
led the Zealots to Dormammu.

1150
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:22,960
Kaecilius was her fault!

1151
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:24,880
And here we are...

1152
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,200
in the consequence of her deception.

1153
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:31,920
A world on fire.

1154
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:34,480
Mordo, the London Sanctum has fallen.

1155
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,440
The New York one
has been attacked twice.

1156
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:38,120
You know where they're going next.

1157
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:39,640
Hong Kong.

1158
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:42,040
You told me once to fight
like my life depended on it...

1159
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:43,120
because one day, it might.

1160
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:44,880
Well, today is that day.

1161
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:48,080
I cannot defeat them alone.

1162
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:06,880
The Sanctum's already fallen.

1163
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:16,680
The Dark Dimension.

1164
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:19,920
Dormammu is coming.

1165
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:23,560
It's too late.

1166
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:25,360
Nothing can stop him.

1167
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:29,000
Not necessarily.

1168
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:34,360
No.

1169
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,600
-

1170
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:17,080
The spell's working.

1171
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:20,840
We've got a second chance.

1172
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:30,600
Whoa!

1173
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:01,440
No!

1174
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:13,040
Wong.

1175
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,120
Breaking the laws of nature. I know.

1176
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:26,800
Well, don't stop now.

1177
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:29,840
DOCTOR STRANGE:
When the Sanctum's restored,

1178
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,080
they'll attack it again.

1179
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:32,320
We've got to defend it.

1180
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:33,840
Come on!

1181
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:03,120
Get up, Strange.

1182
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:04,640
Get up and fight.

1183
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:06,480
We can finish this.

1184
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,800
You can't fight the inevitable.

1185
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:14,920
Isn't it beautiful?

1186
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,880
A world beyond time.

1187
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:22,800
Beyond death.

1188
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:29,480
-Beyond time...
-Strange.

1189
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:03,680
He's gone.

1190
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:08,320
Even Strange has left you
and surrendered to his power.

1191
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:43,520
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1192
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:46,040
You've come to die.

1193
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:50,480
Your world is now my world...

1194
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:53,200
like all worlds.

1195
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:26,520
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1196
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:29,520
You've come to die.

1197
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:32,600
Your world is now my...

1198
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,240
What is this?

1199
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:37,280
Illusion?

1200
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:38,720
No. This is real.

1201
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,360
Good.

1202
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:53,680
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1203
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:57,160
You've... What is happening?

1204
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:00,560
Just as you gave Kaecilius
powers from your dimension...

1205
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:03,120
I brought a little power from mine.

1206
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:05,640
This is time.

1207
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:09,280
Endless looped time.

1208
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,720
You dare!

1209
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:13,200
Oh...

1210
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:17,760
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1211
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:21,120
You cannot do this forever.

1212
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:22,800
Actually, I can.

1213
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:25,440
This is how things are now.

1214
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:28,640
You and me, trapped in this moment...

1215
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:29,840
endlessly.

1216
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:33,600
Then you will spend eternity dying.

1217
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:37,960
Yes. But everyone on Earth will live.

1218
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:39,720
But you will suffer.

1219
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,840
Pain's an old friend.

1220
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:43,840
-

1221
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,120
I've come to bargain.

1222
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:48,360
DORMAMMU: End this!

1223
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:51,200
Dormammu... Dormammu...
Dormammu...

1224
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:10,440
DORMAMMU: You will never win.

1225
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:12,840
No...

1226
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:15,000
but I can lose...

1227
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,480
again and again...

1228
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:20,240
and again...

1229
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
and again, forever.

1230
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:26,000
And that makes you my prisoner.

1231
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:27,440
No!

1232
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:28,520
-Stop!

1233
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:31,760
Make this stop!

1234
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:34,040
Set me free!

1235
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,040
No.

1236
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:38,520
I've come to bargain.

1237
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:42,560
What do you want?

1238
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:46,400
Take your Zealots from the Earth.

1239
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:49,040
End your assault on my world.

1240
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:51,120
Never come back.

1241
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:52,720
Do it...

1242
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:55,440
and I'll break the loop.

1243
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:06,040
Get up, Strange!

1244
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:07,520
Get up and fight.

1245
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:09,720
We can finish this.

1246
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:11,280
KAECILIUS: Isn't it beautiful?

1247
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:16,040
A world beyond time.

1248
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:20,240
Beyond death.

1249
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,400
What have you done?

1250
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:35,160
DOCTOR STRANGE: I made a bargain.

1251
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:39,120
What is this?

1252
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:43,040
Well, it's everything you've ever wanted.

1253
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:46,280
Eternal life as part of the One.

1254
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:50,680
You're not gonna like it.

1255
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:11,920
Yeah, you know, you really should have

1256
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,920
stolen the whole book
because the warnings...

1257
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,240
The warnings come after the spells.

1258
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:28,280
Oh, that's funny.

1259
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:57,160
We did it.

1260
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,680
Yes, we did it.

1261
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:06,120
By also violating...

1262
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:07,840
the natural law.

1263
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:11,360
Look around you. It's over.

1264
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:14,320
You still think there will be
no consequences, Strange?

1265
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:17,480
No price to pay?

1266
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,000
We broke our rules, just like her.

1267
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:25,520
The bill comes due.

1268
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:27,320
Always!

1269
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:29,720
A reckoning.

1270
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:35,640
I will follow this path no longer.

1271
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:11,040
Yeah, okay.

1272
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:21,680
WONG: Wise choice.

1273
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:24,480
You'll wear the Eye of Agamotto...

1274
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,840
once you've mastered its powers.

1275
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:28,080
Until then...

1276
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:31,840
best not to walk the streets
wearing an Infinity Stone.

1277
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:33,000
A what?

1278
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,440
You might have a gift for the mystic arts,

1279
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:38,400
but you still have much to learn.

1280
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:43,520
Word of the Ancient One's death
will spread through the Multiverse.

1281
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:46,080
Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme
to defend it.

1282
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:47,640
We must be ready.

1283
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:48,800
We'll be ready.

1284
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:38,640
THOR: So Earth has wizards now, huh?

1285
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:41,600
Tea?

1286
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:43,640
I don't drink tea.

1287
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:44,720
What do you drink?

1288
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:47,440
Not tea.

1289
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:52,440
So, I keep a watch list...

1290
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:54,480
of individuals and beings
from other realms

1291
01:46:54,640 --> 01:46:55,920
that may be a threat to this world.

1292
01:46:56,120 --> 01:46:59,760
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

1293
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:03,840
Worthy inclusion.

1294
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:05,080
Yeah.

1295
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:10,280
So why bring him here to New York?

1296
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:11,880
It's a bit of a long story.

1297
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:14,000
Family drama, that kind of thing.

1298
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:15,800
But we're looking for my father.

1299
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:19,560
Oh, okay. So if you found Odin...

1300
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:22,680
you'd all return to Asgard promptly?

1301
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:24,160
Oh, yes. Promptly.

1302
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:25,720
Great!

1303
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:28,640
Allow me to help you.

1304
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:31,000
Can I help you?

1305
01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:35,360
They carried you into Kamar-Taj
on a stretcher.

1306
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:38,880
Look at you now, Pangborn.

1307
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:41,280
Mordo.

1308
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:45,960
So what can I do for you, man?

1309
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:47,880
MORDO: I've been away
for many months now,

1310
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:49,720
and I've had a revelation.

1311
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:53,120
The true purpose of a sorcerer...

1312
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:56,040
is to twist things out of
their proper shape...

1313
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:58,480
stealing power...

1314
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:00,800
perverting nature.

1315
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:02,800
Like you.

1316
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:06,080
I've stolen nothing. This is my power.

1317
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:08,960
-Mine.
-Power...

1318
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:11,760
has a purpose.

1319
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:27,920
Why are you doing this?

1320
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:31,320
Because I see, at long last,
what's wrong with the world.

1321
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:38,760
Too many sorcerers.
