Well, you see, tomorrow would have
been my son's 21 st birthday.

And, as a gesture,

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,240
I thought I would
invite your brother, Arthur.

29
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,760
A gesture of what, Mrs Ross?

30

Not exactly forgiveness.

31

But something like that.

32
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,880
And also it's a way of saying
thank you to the Shelby family

33
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,760
for helping me and my children get by

That's very kind.
Well, I will let Arthur know.

Distilled for the eradication
of seemingly incurable sadness.

327
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm going to put that on the label.

328
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,440
I'll book myself a room.

329

Already done. The Midland. Suite.

330
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,760
I stay there myself sometimes.

331
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,800
Sometimes, it's where you stay.

332
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,280
But not tonight, it would seem.

333
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,240
Well, since I'm stuck here,
maybe I should try your gin.

334
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,200
-4:00 then.
-Where?

335
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,480
I'll find you.

336
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,800
What the fuck
was that about, Lizzie? Eh?

337
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,640
Have a guess.

338
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,560
You know what,
I can't even guess any more.

339
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,120
I'll be back at 4:00.

340
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,200
Why is she still here?

341
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,720
Something to do
with the coal miners, apparently.

I wanted to illustrate to you

that at any time,
we can reach your son.

350

And we will kill your son

as you promised. Huh?

00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,640
Fucking.

357
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,160
-Fucking what?
-Fucking her.

358

Ten thousand pounds?

359
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,160
She left it blank,
so I filled it in for her.

360
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,160
What's Tommy's diary looking like
for the rest of the week?

361
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,240
Fuck Tommy and his cock and his gin.

362
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,240
And his stuck-up whore.

363
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,680
I saved this.

364
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,040

You haven't done my leaves in ages.

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,840
Swirl the teacup.

Think about the man you love.

Fuck him.

372
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,680

Now pour the tea back into the pot.

Okay, I'll read your tea leaves
if you go and get Tommy's diary.

376
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,240
See if Tommy's got a free afternoon
in the next seven days.

377
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,840

Now, read my future
and make it fucking good.

Make sure Tommy
keeps that Friday free.

Tell him I have an
appointment for him.

387

And then go and see a doctor
about that baby in your tea leaves.

You're not at the fucking
fairground now, son.

391
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,360
Get down and skip me 200

KING MAINE:
He's got a head on him, that boy.

394
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,600
ABERAMA: And a fist.

395
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,400
So what do you say, Mr Maine?

396
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,520
He works hard. He's game.

397
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,680
I'll need to work on his defence.

398
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,680
Right now, his left hand
is just good for wanking

399
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,440
You don't have to earn your money.

400
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,280
We're paying you anyway. Is he ready?

401
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,440
Is he even registered?

402
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,120
I put him down as a welterweight,
Midlands division.

403

Amateur turning pro.
Just need your counter signature.

(SCOFFS) What?
Like I'm going to say no to you boys?

405
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,480
Just tell us, is he ready?

406
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,560
In 30 years, I've never seen
a raw boy so ready.

That's 200, Mr Maine.

408
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,840
So who am I fighting first, Mr Shelby?

409
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,520
When you step in the ring, Bonnie,
who do you see across the canvas, eh?

410
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,800
I see myself.

411
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,840
Forty years old having done fuck all,
except tramping the lanes.

412
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,360
I see my life wasted.

413
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,800
I won't let it happen.

414
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,040

417
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,320
Boy's name is Goliath.

418
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,240
He said he's at a meeting.

419
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,280
Yes, I was wondering,

420
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,840
do you have any boots
that I could borrow?

421
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,680
Why do you need boots?

422
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,280
Well, no one here will speak to me,

423
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,800
so I thought I'd take a walk
by the canal.

424
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,240
Is he really making gin?

425
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,040
He's going mad cooped up here
is what he is.

426
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,000
Like a wasp in a beer glass.

-Oh.
-Thank you, Curly.

430
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,520
If you're going to take
a walk along the canal,

431
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,800
you'll also need this.

432
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,400
Are you serious?

433
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,320
Italians north, Italians south.

434
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,480
He makes gin to take his mind off
being stuck inside a prison.

If you had any sense, Mrs Car let on,
you'd get out of here now.

437

Curly can sail you

The man you're waiting for
doesn't exist.

(STUTTERING) While you're waiting
for the man who doesn't exist,

00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,720
They were busy.

447
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,440
Apparently, there was a report
of armed men in the Small Heath area.

448
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,680
And there was a murder
at the Summer Lane hospital.

And something happening
on the Stratford Road.

The strikers threatened
the men's families.

451
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,160
They said, come the revolution,
their names would be on a list.

452
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,200
Like in Russia.

453
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,240
And the buses turned round?

454
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,080
Yes. They turned round.

455
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,440
Mr Shelby, factories are shut,

456
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,480
mines are shut, coal's running out.

457
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,680
Did you ever consider the possibility
that the communists might win?

And you and me, traitors to our class,

459
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,840
will be put up against a wall
and shot.

460
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,160
As a businessman,
I consider all possibilities.

I'm not a traitor to my class.

No. I don't really have time
for hobbies.

This is more of a...

More of a place
where I try things out.

478

I've decided, if I'm gonna be
stuck here in Small Heath,

00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,840
I might as well do something useful.

Less of a hobby.

481

More of a venture.

Since the start of prohibition,

483
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,520
I've been sending

00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,600
But my supply lines from Scotland
have been unreliable.

487
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,000
There's been a lot of thefts.

488
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,240
And in this modern age, American women
drink as much booze as the men.

489
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,240
And women, apparently, prefer gin.

490
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,040
So with the help of a friend of mine
in Camden Town,

491
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,160
I've set up my own source of supply.

492
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,480
Junipers, potatoes, sugar and water,

493
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,600
all turned into US dollars.

494
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,720
When we're up and running,
we'll produce over 200 gallons a week.

495
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,600
But before then,
I need to get my recipe right.

496
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,720
So tell me the truth.

497
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,320
-The truth?
-Mmm-hmm.

498
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,480
You're unlike any man I've ever met.

499
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,720
-And the gin?
-Too sweet.

500
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,800
You said you'd booked a room.

501
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,400
No, I booked a suite.

502
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,760
Thank you.

503
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,040
If you book a taxi, I'll go.

504
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,760
You're a businessman, Tommy.
A good one.

505
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,520
-If only you could...
-If only I could what?

506
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,520
If only you could change?

507
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,840
Go on, say it.
If only you could change the bad.

508
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,480
And "the good" is laying off
a thousand men, which I do.

509
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,440
Like a good businessman,
and I do it like that. (SNAPS FINGERS)

510
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,960
And people go hungry.

511
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,360
And the bad, the bad's
a fucking win on the horses

512
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,040
and a gun
and some fucking self-respect.

513
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,000
You fucking people...

514
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,960
You bite like your horse.

515
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,000
I don't trust taxis any more.

516
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,720
Come with me.

517
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,880
ARTHUR: There we go, brother.

518
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,080
Home sweet home.

519
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,560
A place for you to bring women back,
bring your mates.

520
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,320
Play games, gamble, cards,

521
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,600
and you keep an eye on our backyard.

522
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,560
It's Artillery Square, the place
is full of communists and strikers.

523
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,520
Having a Shelby round here
will keep them in order.

524
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,800
Light the fucking fire.
Take some of this shit off the walls.

525
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,560
Curly'll be over later
with some poison for the rats.

526
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,680
-Arthur?
-Huh?

527
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:31,600
This morning, I wouldn't
have been able to pull that trigger.

528
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,240
I know I wouldn't.
They would have just walked past.

529
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,120
I'm not John.

530
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,040
-I know I'm not.
-All right.

531
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,080
All right, brother.

532
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,000
I know you're not.

533
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,120
I know.

534
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,920
In the end, it's God who pulls
that fucking trigger anyway.

535
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,280
We don't get to decide
who lives and who dies, Finn.

536
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,440
Not us.

537
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:11,520
You just have to flick a switch
in your head.

538
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,280
Charlie said it wasn't safe
to walk by the canal.

539
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,920
And he's right.

540
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,400
Italians north and south, he said.

541
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,840
No, it's mostly chancers.

542

Local kids trying to get famous.

543

Sabini's boys. Sheffield boys.

544
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,640
Manchester, Glasgow.

545
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,600
They all know we're on the ropes.

546
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,840
-And that's not including the mafia.
-Yup.

547
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,360
Here's your carriage.

548
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,600
You can catch the 7:15 train.

549
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,040
I thought there was a strike.

550
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,640
What gave you that idea?

551
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,320
My God.

552
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,040
I know.

553
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,720
The bad I can't help.

554
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,880
I wanted you to stay.

555
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,880
And normally, I get my own way.

556
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,800
Losing occasionally makes me worse.

557
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,480
MAY: Thank you, Curly.

558
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,600
She looks a picture in my boots,
doesn't she, Tom?

559
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,240
-Walk her to the train, Curly.
-Yeah.

560

JESSIE: <i>"Not a minute on the day,
not a penny off the pay."</i>

561
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,720
This talk of national austerity,

562
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:51,440
this talk of tightening our belts
must be met with a resolute certainty.

563
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,360
We will not accept any cuts in pay.

564
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,160
We will not accept working
longer hours for the same wage.

565
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,840
Shoulder to shoulder
with the coal miners,

566
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,840
dock workers, railway men
and steel workers,

567
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,720
we will stand united

568
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,040
through the storm
that is surely coming to our city!

-Yes?

572
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,360
I'd like to buy you a drink.

573
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,920
I'm afraid the pubs round here

574
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,840
don't allow unaccompanied
female drinkers.

575
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,520
I'm sure we'll be fine.

576
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,160
I know you from somewhere.

579
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,880
I have a settlement proposition

580
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,520
that my brother's too arrogant
and proud to offer you in person.

00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,720
Don't what?

00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,440
It's all right. I'm sorry. I didn't...

"What are you drinking, ladies?"

-That's what you're supposed to say.
-Yes.

Sorry. Er, what are you drinking?

Beer. Pint.

590
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,800
And a whisky on ice.

591
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,000
I'm afraid we don't have ice.

592
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,280
Next time, make sure you have ice.

593
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,400
This pub's come to our attention
for its lack of ice.

to achieve equality.

Before you begin to
congratulate yourself,

596

I'm not impressed with your power
to terrify people.

Hmm.

598
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,440
Whereas, I am impressed
by your ability

599
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,640
to stand up in front of an audience
and speak.

600
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,080
I was never able to do it.

601
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,520
I've heard people talk about you.

602
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,040
You used to advocate armed revolution.

is prepared to offer parity

for male and female workers across
all the factories in our ownership.

605

And withdraw the pay cut for men.

606
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,640
In return for what?

607
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,640
In return for something very unusual.

608
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,120
But very typical of my brother.

609
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,920
-What does he want?
-To sit down with you and talk.

610

If he withdraws his pay cut,
we have no need to talk.

611
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,760
He wants to talk about socialism
and revolution.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

613
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,560
Dear God, are you serious?

614
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,280
My brother's a bookmaker.

615
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,760
Bookmakers hedge their bets.

616
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,160
Sometimes, long shots come in.

617
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,040
And because we emptied
his buses today,

618
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,680
he thinks we are among
the runners and riders.

619
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,520
Beneath it all,
my brother is a very rational man.

620
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,960
Beneath all what?

621
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,640
You mean, beneath the beatings,
the cuttings,

622
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,920
-the shootings, the murders.
-Yeah. Beneath all that.

623
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,480
Tell your brother
that when we take power,

624
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,920
all means of production
will be owned by the workers.

625
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,040
Essential industries
will be taken into state control.

626
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,160
Birmingham Town Hall
is a rather beautiful building

627
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,040
and we plan to preserve it.

628
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,560
What else does he need to know?

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

630
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,640
It's going to happen.

00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,440
Aren't you a bit sorry
you jumped ship too soon?

632
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,880
He wants to take you for dinner.

633
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,680
I really have nothing to wear.

634
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,560
You'd need to wear boots.

635
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,400
He's suggesting dinner
in a scrap metal yard.

636
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,520
He said you'd appreciate
the sentiment.

637
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,240
If you don't show up,
the offer of parity is withdrawn.

638
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,560
This is not how you conduct
union business.

639
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,200
Well, we must all make
personal sacrifices

00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,080
for the good
of the good old cause. Right?

641
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,360
DRIVER: All right.

Fucking hell, it smells
of pig round here, doesn't it?

644
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,080
Definitely not kosher.

Come to Small Heath,
you will go to hell

646
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,520

649
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,080
Fuck me, he looks like he's grown
since we left London.

650
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,440
He's like a mushroom, isn't he?
He grows in the dark.

651
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,320
-I need a piss.
-Do ya?

652
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,440
Yeah? Well, the place is a shit hole.

653
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,400
Yeah? So why don't you
just knock yourself out.

654
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,920
Where is everyone?

655
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,480

will you hit the call to prayer?

-Yeah, it is. It is.

663
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,400
So how come
everybody's in fucking bed?

664
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,680
TOMMY: So this must be Goliath.

665
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,920
Right.

666
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,760
Let me introduce you to David.

667
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,840
This way, boys.

668
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,520
I assume that David's out of bed?

Oh, right, the problem, right,
between rum and gin

671
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:05,480
is that gin, right,
it leads to the melancholy,

672
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,880
whereas rum incites violence.

673
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,440
You know, it also allows you
to be liberated from your self-doubt.

674
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:16,240
I hear you're probably
more in need of the old rum

675
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,240
at the moment
rather than gin, mate. Hmm?

(BIRD FLAPPING)

Oh, dear. Tommy,
you've got fucking starlings, mate.

678
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,320
Oh, yeah.
That shit will rot your pipework.

679

Those bastards only
understand one language.

680
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,200
It's all right, Alfie.
There's no need.

681
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,640
It's all right, I'm, er...
I'm getting a kestrel.

682
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,200
I hear that you've got Italians, mate.

683
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,200
You've got a kestrel for them and all?

684
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,720
-Yes.
-Hmm.

685
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,400
I have a kestrel for them as well.

686
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,040
Well, everything is confirmed, innit?

687

Yeah. Weakness behind the eyes,
didn't blink too much. All right.

You smell of smoke and coal
and horses. Hmm?

You are back where you belong, Tommy.

690
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,680
I know you don't touch it,
but you have a good nose.

691
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,800
Right. Well,
you've got to ask yourself,

692
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,160
seriously though, you know,

693
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,920
did I even want to
piss and shit indoors?

694
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,160
Or was I actually born that I were to
defecate in fields and the outhouses?

695
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,560
This is a serious issue,
though, Tommy,

696
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,720
'cause your people, your class

697
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,120
and my religion
is quite similar, actually,

698
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,440
because you just cannot
wash it out, right?

699
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,560
Because it come out
of your mother's tits.

700
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,480
Hmm. No.

701
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,240
The Americans want it sweeter.

702
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,600
What have you heard, Alfie?

703
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,800
I heard a copper got shot.
Who shot him?

704
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,040
-My kestrel.
-Right, oh, up the stakes, very good.

705
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,800
Where are the Sicilians?

706
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:50,200
They're still using Sabini
for vehicles and for places to stay.

707
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,520
Mmm-hmm. And reinforcements?

708
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,280
Ah, they know the Sicilians,
don't they?

709
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,840
They don't trust nobody who ain't
fucked a goat on the morning

710
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,240
of their first pubic hair.
They've got traditions.

711
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,520
-How many are here?
-Eleven.

712
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,040
Enough to drop a man
who wrapped his balls in an OBE,

713
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,600
till they fell off.

714
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,240
Well, the real question is, Alfie,

715
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,640
which side are you playing for, eh?

716

to bring up children

718
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,640
when your own mate
can ask you that question, eh?

719
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,360
But the truth is, Tommy,

720
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,000
you're going to be
fucking dead soon, yeah.

721
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,120
Then your starlings, right,

722
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,360
they will peck out
your blue eyes, won't they?

723
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:34,000
And the jackdaws, they will steal
your gold and your medals

724
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,160
and pretty soon it'll be as if

725
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,480
it never even
fucking happened, mate.

726
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,920
Tommy, there are men approaching.

727
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,520
Yeah, let 'em pass.

728
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,760
Right. You tell Darby Sabini from me,

729
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,440
that if the Italians win,
they're not planning on leaving.

730
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,120
And after me, it'll be him,
and then you, then the Titanic.

731
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,560
They're the fucking mafia, Alfie.

732
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,400
They've come here and can't believe
our coppers are unarmed.

733
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,120
They can distil their liquor
and it's against the law.

734
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,400
They've come here
and they like what they see.

735
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,680
They're coming
and they're here to stay.

736
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,240
ABERAMA: Mr Shelby?

737
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,520
We've come to talk purse
for the fight.

738

Your kestrel?

739
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,600
Tommy, when a pikey walks in
with hair like that,

740
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,680
you've gotta ask yourself,
"Have I made a mistake?"

741
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,680
-Who the fuck are you?
-Who the fuck am I?

742
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,160
-Who the fuck is this?
-I, my friend,

743
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,040
I am the uncle,

744
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,200
I'm the protector
and the promoter,

745
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,080
of that fucking thing right there
in whose shadow

746
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,440
nothing good nor godly
will ever fucking grow.

747
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:36,760
That there, right, is the Southern
Counties welterweight champion.

748
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,400
He is of mixed religion,
therefore he is godless,

749
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,400
he was adopted by Satan himself,

750
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,960
before he was returned
out of fear of his awkwardness.

751
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,080
He is impossible to marry off
due to his lethal dimensions,

752
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,840
his mother terrified,
she's fucking abandoned him.

753
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,960
And there he is stood before you

754
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,080
like the first of some
brand new fucking species.

755
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,280
Any man that you put before him,

756
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,480
right, it'd be like entering
a fucking threshing machine, mate.

757
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,480
Now, will you offer your son?

758
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,240

That's me finished
for the weekend, Tommy?

760
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,160
Yeah. Your mother wants me to go
to the Foundation... Prize giving.

761
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,280

No reason.
